Sign up here to receive The Windup directly in your inbox.\n\nIt only took 149 years, but Major League Baseball will finally have its first female umpire this weekend.\n\nPlus: the Red Sox continue their parade of extensions, Andrew Vaughn is a new man in Milwaukee and we ask: Who has the best bullpen in baseball? I\u2019m Levi Weaver, and Ken Rosenthal is off this week \u2014 welcome to The Windup!\n\nAbout Time: A very brief history of women in umpiring\n\nIn March of 1988, the Sports Illustrated cover hit mailboxes across the country, with the words in bold across the cover: \u201cThe Lady is an Ump.\u201d\n\nThe lady in question: Pam Postema, who became the first woman to umpire an MLB spring training game. Postema spent 13 years in the minor leagues, and was highly regarded among her peers, but never made it to a regular-season MLB game.\n\u2022 It was 19 years before the next woman \u2014 Ria Cortesio \u2014 worked another MLB spring training game. She had been the top-rated umpire in Double-A the previous year, but 2007 would be her last. She was released after nine seasons of umpiring.\n\u2022 It only took 17 more years for a third woman to work a spring training game. That was last year, when Jen Pawol (who had been umpiring professionally since 2017) worked select Grapefruit League games. She was also elevated to Triple-A crew chief that year, becoming the first woman to do so. (Britt Ghiroli\u2019s story from then, also detailing the history of women in umpiring, remains a must-read.)\n\u2022 This weekend, Pawol will \u2014 finally \u2014 become the first woman to umpire in a regular-season MLB game. She\u2019ll suit up for Saturday\u2019s doubleheader between the Marlins and Braves. She is then scheduled to work home plate on Sunday\u2019s series finale.\n\nTo be frank, it\u2019s about time. The first woman to referee an NBA game was Violet Palmer in 1997. The first female NFL official: Sarah Thomas in 2015. There have been qualified candidates \u2014 Postema and Cortesio chief among them \u2014 and it\u2019s good to see one of them finally get a shot.\n\nYes, the Red Sox were perhaps a bit too timid at the trade deadline. But over the last two years, they\u2019ve been fairly aggressive in locking down some of the building blocks of their core.\n\u2022 March 2024: Brayan Bello \u2014 6 years, $55 million after two seasons in the big leagues\n\n April 2024: Ceddanne Rafaela \u2014 8 years, $50 million after just 28 games played\n\u2022 April 2025: Garrett Crochet \u2014 6 years, $160 million, the largest contract ever given to a player with just over four years of service time\n\u2022 April 2025: Kristian Campbell \u20148 years, $60 million after five days of big-league service time\n\nThe trend continued yesterday. Roman Anthony \u2014 who came into this season as Keith Law\u2019s No. 1 prospect in the sport, just turned 21 and is now hitting .276/.392/.417 (.809 OPS) after his first 47 games in the big leagues \u2014 signed an eight-year extension worth $130 million (plus a club option for 2034).\n\nThe Red Sox might not be done, either. When they signed Campbell this spring, they expressed an interest in extending 22-year-old infielder Marcelo Mayer (who is currently on the IL with a wrist injury).\n\nAs Jen McCaffrey writes, it wasn\u2019t always this way in Boston. After all, this is the franchise that has spent the last five-plus years hearing the critiques for trading away Mookie Betts.\n\nMore Anthony: From McCaffrey, back in March: Inside the rise of Anthony.\n\nReset: Who has baseball\u2019s best bullpen?\n\nI tried to count all the big-league relievers who changed teams at this year\u2019s deadline, but it\u2019s complicated: What counts as a deadline deal? Is Dustin May considered a reliever? Do we count Taylor Rogers twice, since he was a Pittsburgh Pirate for about one day?\n\nAnyway, the number I landed on was a lot. A bushel of relievers. A cornucopia of bullpen arms, if you will.\n\nToday, Eno Sarris endeavors to answer the question: After all those trades, who has the best bullpen in baseball?\n\nI won\u2019t spoil Eno\u2019s conclusion, but I did find the Mets section interesting. Check this out:\n\nYeah, the Mets are mired in a slump right now \u2014 they\u2019ve followed a seven-game winning streak in late July by going 1-8 in the nine games since \u2014 but that\u2019s heck of a stat to define their bullpen upgrades.\n\nIt was a good move, even before we could know the full context. The Milwaukee Brewers called up 23-year-old pitching prospect Jacob Misiorowski in mid-June, and he went on an absolute tear, making the All-Star Game after just five starts.\n\nObviously, the Brewers had no choice but to keep him in the rotation.\n\nThat was only a problem for \u2014 well, aside from the rest of the NL Central \u2014 one guy: Aaron Civale, who lost his spot in the rotation to the rookie. Rather than be relegated to the bullpen, he requested a trade, and the team obliged, sending him to the Chicago White Sox. (Sometimes, even acquiescence can be punitive.)\n\nIn return, the Brewers received Andrew Vaughn, 2019\u2019s No. 3 draft pick. At the time of the trade, the 27-year-old first baseman was watching his big-league dreams slip through his fingers. Following four years of more or less average production in Chicago from 2021-24 (0.3 bWAR, total), his 2025 had been an abject disaster. After he hit .189/.218/.314 (.531 OPS) in 48 games, the team optioned him to Triple-A Charlotte.\n\nHe was only marginally better there, hitting .211 with a .679 OPS). Vaughn remained in Triple A after the trade, yet the change of scenery paid dividends almost immediately. He hit .259 (.838 OPS) in 16 games with the Nashville Sounds, and when Rhys Hoskins hit the IL with a sprained thumb on July 7, Vaughn\u2019s second chance had arrived.\n\nIn 22 games, Vaughn is hitting a hilarious .377/.444/.701 (1.145 OPS) with seven home runs. He\u2019s on a 12-game hitting streak. The Brewers are 70-44, which is the best record in the league.\n\nMore Brewers: Andy McCullough dives deep to explain how the Brewers (yes, the Brewers) built one of baseball\u2019s best teams (again).\n\nWhen the Blue Jays ascended to first place in the AL East in early July, their run differential was only +10. After three blowout wins in Colorado (including a 20-1 beating yesterday), they\u2019re at +55. Mitch Bannon tells us about the dominant series, while Britt Ghiroli has a bigger-picture look at how the Blue Jays have finally overcome a multi-year reputation as underachievers.\n\nThe Yankees salvaged a game in Texas to stay 1.5 games up on the Rangers for the last AL playoff spot. They may have found their new closer in the process.\n\nThe Guardians almost got their first no-hitter in 44 years yesterday, as Gavin Williams went 8 1/3 innings of no-hit ball before Juan Soto\u2019s solo shot ended the bid.\n\nThe Cubs didn\u2019t get a third top-of-the-rotation starter at the deadline. Is that because Cade Horton is that guy?\n\nThe Tigers lost again. They\u2019re 7-12 since the All-Star break. Cody Stavenhagen breaks down the breakdown.\n\nIn Philadelphia, Zack Wheeler\u2019s shoulder is barking. Jordan Romano is struggling with David Robertson and Jose Alvarado close to returning. Matt Gelb has more here. while Charlotte Varnes checks in on Andrew Painter as he continues to work his way back from Tommy John surgery.\n\nShohei Ohtani struck out eight in four innings on the mound, then hit a two-run home run. Classic Ohtani.\n\nOn the pods: Eno Sarris is back on Rates & Barrels, and the crew discusses the Anthony extension, the Yankees defense, and the Brewers\u2019 success with Vinny Rottino of FSNWI.\n\nMost-clicked in our last newsletter: Doug Haller\u2019s great story about the famous rookie-year meeting between Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer.\n\n\ud83d\udceb Love The Windup?

      "text": "DENVER \u2014 It took 27 whole innings for the home crowd to finally boo. Even then, the Coors Field groans were filled with a sort of amusement, laced with an appreciation of just how much things had gotten out of hand.\nThe Toronto Blue Jays made history in the final frame of a 20-1 victory on Wednesday, tacking on the last few runs of a third consecutive blowout. With Toronto now sporting a 68-48 record, best in the American League, here are five numbers that distill the Jays\u2019 three-game dominance in Denver.\nAdvertisement\n63: Blue Jays hits\nThe Jays found seemingly every inch of outfield grass across three games in Colorado. As position player Austin Nola lobbed in pitches to mercifully end Wednesday\u2019s finale, the Jays surpassed the 1950 St. Louis Browns for most hits in a three-game series by any squad in the modern era (since 1901).\nVladimir Guerrero Jr. recorded eight hits in the series. Ernie Clement notched five in the first game and four in the finale. Newly-acquired infielder Ty France, who also reached base with two hit-by-pitches on Wednesday, collected more hits in Colorado (five) than in his previous seven games combined. France\u2019s big day was one thing Jays manager John Schneider said he will remember most about the series.\n\u201cIt was everyone, literally, on the roster, doing something,\u201d he said.\nThe Jays surpassed the franchise\u2019s previous record for hits in a three-game series by 12, set in July 2022 at Fenway Park.\n45: Blue Jays runs\nCoors Field is often a launching pad for opposing lineups. Colorado entered Wednesday\u2019s finale with a 6.44 ERA at home, more than a half-run higher than the second-worst squad. But perhaps more than any other team, the 2025 Blue Jays were built for the Rockies\u2019 home park.\nPer Baseball Savant park factors, Coors Field produces 16 percent more hits than the league average. The outfield is massive and the thin air adds additional flight to line drives. For a Toronto team that entered the series with baseball\u2019s best batting average (.264) and lowest strikeout rate (17.3 percent), Coors was a run-scoring haven.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big outfield,\u201d Bo Bichette said. \u201cJust put the ball in play, give yourself a chance. Obviously, we did that.\u201d\nDespite ranking around the league average in home runs, Toronto\u2019s contact-dominant offence ranks fifth in baseball with 576 runs. At Coors, that contact ability helped them set another record. With at least 10 runs across all three games and 45 runs total, the Jays set a franchise benchmark for most runs in a three-game series.\nAdvertisement\n.301: Bo Bichette\u2019s new batting average\nFor the first time since April, Bichette\u2019s batting average pushed over .300. The shortstop tallied seven hits, three homers and 10 RBI across the three games in Colorado. It was his first time playing at Coors Field, where his father, Dante, hit 111 homers.\nEverything about Bichette is consistent. Each at-bat features the same calculated aggression. Every batting practice showcases the same sprayed line drives. Every word he speaks slowly trickles out in the same calm, quiet tone.\nIn 2024, hamstring strains and a finger fracture halted that consistency. But this year, with Bichette in what could be his final season with the Jays, the dependability returned. He once again owns the most hits in the league (145) and his .815 OPS is above his career average. Bichette is now on pace to lead his league in hits for a third time, surpassing his father, who led the National League in hits twice.\n\u201cI just feel like I have a pretty good understanding of who I want to be as a hitter right now,\u201d Bichette said.\nThe Blue Jays\u2019 early offensive success came on the back of endless contributions across the lineup. But when Bichette and Guerrero Jr. are in peak form, as they were in Colorado, the offence can hang with the best in baseball.\n2: Vladimir Guerrero Jr. opposite-field homers\nGuerrero Jr. met a fastball at the top of the zone, launching the 99 mph pitch deep to right field in Wednesday\u2019s eighth inning. As he connected, the franchise first baseman started into a certain slow trot.\nVladimir Guerrero Jr. makes it 11 runs on the day for the @BlueJays! pic.twitter.com/F6M5wQchnU\n\u2014 MLB (@MLB) August 6, 2025\nThat deep drive was Guerrero\u2019s second opposite-field homer of the series \u2014 and just his second on the season. Those power drives to the opposite power alley are the hits that tell Guerrero that his swing is truly locked in. In the first half of the season, Toronto\u2019s offence performed just fine without a truly dominant stretch from Guerrero. But if it wasn\u2019t already clear, the Colorado homers prove that Toronto\u2019s franchise player has found his hot streak.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt feels good,\u201d Guerrero said of his swing, through team interpreter Hector Lebron. \u201cThings, I know, are going to happen. Good things are going to happen.\u201d\nIn 20 games since the All-Star break, Guerrero is hitting .378 with six homers and 16 RBI. He\u2019s now on pace for 25 homers and rides a 23-game on-base streak to Los Angeles, with matchups set against the Dodgers\u2019 Clayton Kershaw, Blake Snell and Yoshinobu Yamamoto.\n5: Earned runs allowed by Blue Jays\u2019 starting pitchers\nLost in Toronto\u2019s endless offence was surprisingly stable starting pitching. Battling the altered environment of Coors Field, Eric Lauer, Jos\u00e9 Berr\u00edos and Kevin Gausman each adjusted their usual plans to quell the Rockies\u2019 lineup.\nAll three starters allowed early hits and made quick arsenal tweaks. After allowing a first-inning run, Gausman spent the rest of Wednesday\u2019s contest attempting to bounce his signature splitter to avoid hanging pitches. Lauer and Berr\u00edos stayed away from their breaking balls. All three starters mentioned an added focus on pitching down in the zone as the game went on.\nWith the Rockies on pace for fewer than 50 wins, the Jays won\u2019t have to face the Colorado conditions again this season. But this series tested the starters\u2019 ability to make rapid, in-game adjustments \u2014 and they passed.\nEven if Toronto\u2019s pitching stumbled at Coors Field, the lineup could\u2019ve won the series all on its own. But in a high-stakes environment like the postseason, with opposing lineups concocting ultra-focused game plans, those quick shifts on the mound can be the difference between crucial wins and brutal losses.\n(Top photo of Vladimir Guerrero Jr.: Justin Edmonds/Getty Images)"

      "text": "FORT MYERS, Fla. \u2014 Todd Fitz-Gerald coached Eric Hosmer as a kid. He also coached Nick Castellanos and Jes\u00fas Luzardo. As one of the most decorated high school coaches in the country, Fitz-Gerald wasn\u2019t just guessing about what big-league talent looked like at 13 years old. He knew it. He\u2019d coached it. And he saw it in Roman Anthony.\nAdvertisement\nAs a middle schooler, Anthony joined Fitz-Gerald\u2019s Florida Pokers travel ball team. Not long after his 13th birthday, Anthony was the talk of an annual summer tournament in Cooperstown, N.Y. His sweet left-handed swing pummeled homers left and right, including grand slams in three straight at-bats in one game, a Cooperstown record that still stands.\nThat third at-bat is what Fitz-Gerald remembers most. When Anthony stepped to the plate, the pitcher called his coach to the mound and refused to pitch to Anthony. Despite a lopsided score, the opposing coach gave the OK to Fitz-Gerald to let Anthony make an attempt at Cooperstown history and convinced his pitcher to face him. Even with a large crowd watching, anticipating more heroics, he slammed the first pitch he saw over the fence.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just really good,\u201d Fitz-Gerald said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s always been really good.\u201d\nSeven years later, Anthony is baseball\u2019s No. 1 prospect, and not many in his circle are surprised by his success or how he\u2019s handled the pressure and expectations that come with the lofty title. At 20, the outfielder is likely to open this season in Triple A for the Boston Red Sox, but the big leagues are close. Very close.\nHe\u2019s on a path to be the rare major leaguer to debut during his age-21 season. But arriving early is nothing new for Anthony, who has been excelling against older competition all of his life.\nAnthony grew up in West Palm Beach, the youngest of Tony and Lori\u2019s three kids. Though he played multiple sports, baseball was always his passion and he often played with older kids, young for his grade with a May 13 birthday.\n\u201cI was always playing with my brother and his friends, who were four years older. Always the young guy that kind of got pushed around with my brother,\u201d Anthony said with a laugh.\nAnthony\u2019s dad coached him in youth baseball from ages 7 to 11, and even then, Anthony\u2019s talent was recognizable. His dad was an intense coach, and while well-meaning, didn\u2019t have a baseball background. Anthony needed more structure and guidance to reach his potential. That\u2019s when he met Fitz-Gerald.\nAdvertisement\n\u201c(His parents) weren\u2019t really sure what he was going to be, but I knew what he was going to be from the first time I saw him,\u201d Fitz-Gerald said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it. I know what it looks like.\u201d\nIn addition to the Florida Pokers, Fitz-Gerald was head coach of a top Florida program at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland. He\u2019d previously coached at another Florida powerhouse, American Heritage High. During his three-decade career, he guided teams to multiple state championships and was the first person ever to be named Florida Coach of the Year three consecutive times.\nA coach with that much success has seen plenty of talented young ballplayers. Anthony reminded Fitz-Gerald of one of his young pupils in particular.\n\u201cWhen I had Eric Hosmer, the third overall pick in 2008, they\u2019re two really similar kinds of players, different positions but you can see the skill set, the hit tool, the way they went about their business, the way they did their things. They never short changed the game, they never cheated the game and always gave it their best,\u201d he said.\nRoman Anthony blasted a 110 mph exit velocity double, along with a homerun in his 2-4 performance yesterday! pic.twitter.com/3yBCRs7nlZ\n\u2014 Red Sox Player Development (@RedSoxPlayerDev) August 12, 2024\nWhile Anthony played for Fitz-Gerald\u2019s Pokers through middle school, he started high school at home in West Palm Beach at Cardinal Newman. But he soon realized the less competitive league was holding him back. He begged his parents to let him play for Fitz-Gerald in Parkland, about an hour south, but his parents wanted him to focus on his education, realizing a career in baseball was a rarity.\n\u201cThey said if it\u2019s pretty real by the time you\u2019re a junior, you can go down there and play and we\u2019ll make the transition work,\u201d Anthony said.\nAdvertisement\nJust before his junior year, two years after the tragic shooting at Stoneman Douglas that killed 17 people and injured 17 more, Anthony transferred to the school to play for Fitz-Gerald. He and his dad, a financial advisor, moved into an apartment near the school, while his mom, a physician\u2019s assistant who owns an aesthetics practice in West Palm Beach, visited for games and on the weekends. It wasn\u2019t a cross-country move, but it was still life-altering and showed the Anthonys\u2019 commitment and trust in Fitz-Gerald.\n\u201cTodd was an old-school, old-fashioned, hard-ass guy,\u201d Tony Anthony said. \u201cHe had made some comments to us, too, that weren\u2019t salesy in nature, like \u2018Just bring me your kid because I want to win.\u2019 He really was invested in Roman.\n\u201cIt cost me a small fortune renting a place down there. But at the end of the day, he won a couple state championships, two national championships and Gatorade Florida Player of the Year. So it worked out.\u201d\nStoneman Douglas\u2019 success meant scouts were regular fixtures at all of Anthony\u2019s games before he was even draft-eligible. As he watched his older teammates go through the draft process, he promised himself he wouldn\u2019t stress about it. He\u2019d been playing on the summer showcase circuit for Canes National, had committed to play at Mississippi and was excited about his plan for college, even taking classes the summer before his senior year in high school.\nBut then he met Willie Romay, a longtime South Florida amateur scout for the Red Sox who was responsible for signing Triston Casas and Kutter Crawford. Like Fitz-Gerald, Romay knew MLB-caliber talent when he saw it, but he carried himself differently than other scouts and it stood out to Anthony.\n\u201cWillie was one of the few scouts that didn\u2019t really give me a scout vibe, which sometimes can be very robotic,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cYou feel like somebody is always interviewing you, and for me, Willie was like a friend and somebody who was super honest to me from Day 1 and wasn\u2019t really blowing smoke (up) my a\u2013. Told me what I needed to work on, told me what I could get better at, and almost felt like a coaching relationship with Willie and I loved that about him.\u201d\nFor Romay, the feeling was mutual. While he saw immense talent in Anthony, the high schooler was not without flaws. Sometimes, star players in big programs can think they\u2019re infallible. Not Anthony.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cA sign of a good player is they\u2019re able to get critiqued and work at it, not everybody does that,\u201d Romay said. \u201cI remember having a conversation with Roman and he\u2019s like, \u2018Willie, what do I need to work on that I can be better at? What\u2019s good in my game and what needs to be better?\u2019\u201d\nRomay was impressed and told the teenager to work on driving the ball to all parts of the field. He\u2019d seen Anthony\u2019s pull-side power on inside pitches, but warned him that would get exposed as he advanced. A few weeks later, Romay returned and Anthony pulled him into the cage to show him drills he\u2019d been doing to take advantage of the advice.\n\u201cYou could tell he really put in the time to work on his swing and he\u2019s like \u2018What do you think?\u2019\u201d Romay said.\nWhen the draft came around in 2022, Romay pushed hard for Anthony. He was coming off a summer where he\u2019d shown a lot of swing-and-miss in his game, but turned that into a standout senior season, one of the best Fitz-Gerald had seen. Anthony didn\u2019t turn 18 until May and won Florida\u2019s Gatorade Player of the Year, but he wasn\u2019t on any major publications\u2019 first-round mock draft predictions.\nAt the start of the draft, the Red Sox had a strategy in place, thinking Anthony would fly under the radar. They selected California high school shortstops Mikey Romero and Cutter Coffey with their first two picks. The Red Sox had an additional pick after the second round at No. 79 as compensation for losing starter Eduardo Rodr\u00edguez to free agency.\nWith that pick, they drafted Anthony and signed him for $2.5 million, well above the $820,000 projected value for the pick and a higher signing bonus than they gave to either Romero or Coffey. They knew it would require that kind of money to pry Anthony away from Mississippi.\nFive of Anthony\u2019s teammates from the Canes National showcase team were taken in the first two rounds of that draft. Another one of Anthony\u2019s closest friends, Jackson Holliday, went No. 1.\nAdvertisement\nHolliday grew up in Jupiter, Fla., while his dad, Matt, played for the St. Louis Cardinals. The younger Holliday squared off against Anthony throughout his youth before his family moved to Oklahoma when he was in high school. Anthony and Holliday stayed close, often working out over the winters together at the Hollidays\u2019 facility in Oklahoma.\nThough they began their pro careers at the same time, Holliday got a bit of a head start on Anthony, rocketing through the Orioles\u2019 system, entering the 2024 season as MLB\u2019s top prospect and debuting last April. But he struggled in his debut.\n\u201cHe was so good in the minor leagues and never really struggled, and people were like, wait, why is he struggling?\u201d Anthony said. \u201cThis is a failure game, right? So, (Holliday\u2019s experience is) really just putting things into perspective and not having expectations for myself.\u201d\nAnthony took over for Holliday as baseball\u2019s No. 1 prospect this spring, but at the outset of his minor-league career, Anthony had his own struggles. In 2023, he began the year at Low-A Salem and hit .228 with a .693 OPS in 42 games. Though those numbers were underwhelming, he drew 38 walks compared to 38 strikeouts, and was working hard with hitting coach Nelson \u201cPepe\u201d Paulino, so the Red Sox wanted to keep challenging him.\n\u201cTowards the end of that Low-A run, things started to click and the swing started to feel a little bit more polished,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cI was making good swing decisions. The results on the scoreboard weren\u2019t really there, but there were a lot of good signs, and credit to the Red Sox for promoting me when a lot of people are like, how the heck did you just get promoted? They trusted what was going on behind the scenes.\u201d\nAnthony rewarded their decision, tearing up High-A Greenville at 19 with a .294 average, .981 OPS and 12 homers in 54 games, earning him a promotion to Double A for the final 10 games of the season, where he collected 12 hits and posted a 1.020 OPS.\nHe was the first 19-year-old to reach Double A for the Red Sox since Xander Bogaerts in 2012. Anthony finished the year as Boston\u2019s Minor League Offensive Player of the Year. He had started out the 2023 season unranked by Baseball America and was their No. 19 prospect by the season\u2019s end.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t put any expectations on myself,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cI obviously always have confidence in myself and am pretty competitive and I wanted to do what I did in Greenville and in Double A that year, all year, but I think just not really like looking at it and just trusting in myself.\u201d\nWhen Anthony began 2024 in Double-A Portland, he was yet again the youngest player, not just in the Eastern League but all of Double A.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where I would say I definitely learned the most about myself, spending the most time there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d face a guy and the next week he\u2019d be in the big leagues. That\u2019s the first level where it kind of hits you that you\u2019re real close. And for us, being in Maine, getting the fans from up north, that\u2019s the first real feeling of like, \u2018OK, this is closer than I think.\u2019\u201d\nLike the previous year, he started off slow but stuck to his routine and found his rhythm, hitting .269 with an .856 OPS and 20 doubles and 15 homers in 84 games. Manager Chad Epperson had a team loaded with prospects and implored them to watch the big-league club, in particular players like Red Sox leadoff hitter Jarren Duran and his aggressiveness out of the box, putting pressure on the defense.\n\u201cHe\u2019d say, that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to help you get to the majors the fastest, is to emulate what those guys are doing,\u201d Anthony recalled. \u201cIt made us better, and it made the transition to Triple A easier because those are the things you\u2019re expected to do, right?\u201d\nAnthony, catcher Kyle Teel and shortstop Marcelo Mayer, his roommate in Portland, represented the Red Sox at the Futures All-Star Game last summer. A few weeks later, all three were promoted to Triple-A Worcester, roughly 50 minutes west of Boston. Infielder/outfielder Kristian Campbell, who was having a monster season of his own, followed the trio to Worcester a few weeks later, turning Boston\u2019s Big Three into the Big Four. All ranked within the top 50 in baseball across most publications by season\u2019s end.\nAnthony, the youngest player in Triple A, hit .344 with a .983 OPS in 35 games to close out the year.\nIt took Roman Anthony 7 games to record his first 4-hit game at Triple-A.\nOne of those 4-hits: his first Triple-A home run. pic.twitter.com/RRZpfVlUIF\n\u2014 Red Sox Player Development (@RedSoxPlayerDev) August 21, 2024\n\u201cWe\u2019re all so close. We all spend so much time together and I think when you have guys going through it with guys like Marcelo and Campbell and Teel (before he was traded this past winter for Garrett Crochet), it makes transitions a lot easier,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cIt makes going out and taking the field a lot easier. It makes blocking the noise and the expectations from everyone easier.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThough the title of \u201cbaseball\u2019s top prospect\u201d sounds impressive, Anthony downplays his status, often pointing out he hasn\u2019t earned anything yet.\n\u201cQuite honestly with all the fanfare from the rankings and all that stuff he ignores it,\u201d Tony Anthony said. \u201cHe always says, \u2018It\u2019s great to be where I am and get the accolades, but I\u2019ve never taken an at-bat in the big leagues so it really doesn\u2019t mean anything in the clubhouse.\u2019 I think he truly believes that and I think that motivates him.\u201d\nThis spring marked Roman Anthony\u2019s first as a non-roster invitee to big-league camp, meaning he had a locker in the main clubhouse, naturally alongside Campbell and Mayer, the No. 9 and No. 28 prospects in The Athletic\u2019s ranking, respectively.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something at this point that I feel like I\u2019m just like a part of this clubhouse and the goal is obviously to really be a part of this clubhouse now, as soon as I can,\u201d Anthony said.\nIn six spring games, he\u2019s gone 4-for-13 with a double, four walks and just one strikeout. He is tantalizingly close to the majors.\n\u201cSometimes, you\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t believe this kid is 20 years old,\u2019\u201d senior director of player development Brian Abraham said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s a surprise, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s unique for sure. Not all 20-year-olds act that way, but also not all 20-year-olds have the talent that he has.\u201d\nAnthony is realistic about what big-league life might entail, though, particularly having seen Holliday endure such a tough time in his first stretch.\n\u201cI\u2019ve struggled before,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cObviously, I don\u2019t know what Boston\u2019s like. I haven\u2019t struggled up there. I know it\u2019s going to be different than struggling in Portland. But it\u2019s something that they do a good job here of kind of giving you a heads-up and (preparing you for).\u201d\nWhat\u2019s been harder to prepare for is Boston\u2019s rabid fan base. Having played on the national stage for a while, Anthony is accustomed to attention, but this will be a little different. He was in Boston earlier this winter for the team\u2019s rookie development camp and went to a Celtics game with Campbell. Fans recognized him on the streets and in the airport.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of funny because I go home in the offseason and I\u2019m in West Palm and it\u2019s a big city but I\u2019m not really like anyone there, I\u2019m a normal kid,\u201d he said. \u201cI go and do normal things with my friends and then you kind of come here and from Day 1 there are cameras everywhere and it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh wow I forgot about this.\u2019\n\u201cBut to me, that\u2019s just awesome. I\u2019m excited to take it on. I\u2019m excited to play for a big market. I\u2019m excited to take the challenge and play for these fans and try to win in Boston. It\u2019s going to be fun.\u201d\n(Top photo: Danielle Parhizkaran / The Boston Globe via Getty Images)"

      "text": "CHICAGO \u2014 As the Cubs were searching for an impact starting pitcher who was under control beyond this season, one name kept coming up in trade talks: Cade Horton. But team president Jed Hoyer just wasn\u2019t willing to part with the rookie pitcher, especially since those asks included other top prospects.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cHe came up in some trade discussions,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cTo trade a guy (like) him with his amount of control to get a guy with less control, it didn\u2019t make a lot of sense, along with a bunch of other pieces as well.\u201d\nGetting two-plus years of MacKenzie Gore or Joe Ryan would have been huge for this team. But would subtracting Horton, for not only this season but a half decade beyond, been worth it? The Cubs clearly didn\u2019t think so.\nHow does Horton internalize the fact that the Cubs weren\u2019t willing to part with him at the deadline?\n\u201cIt means a lot,\u201d Horton said. \u201cI feel like I just wanna go out there, do my job and help this team win. We got a really good group in there. Just being able to do my part, whatever\u2019s asked of me, is the big thing.\u201d\nHorton is doing more than his part.\nIn a rotation that\u2019s lost Justin Steele for the season, was missing Shota Imanaga for nearly two months, hasn\u2019t had Javier Assad all year and has been without Jameson Taillon since late June, Horton has been a rock.\nIn Wednesday\u2019s 6-1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds, Horton was dominant. The rookie tossed 5 2/3 scoreless frames, striking out six and walking none, having allowed just two hits. He needed just 67 pitches to get through his start and was pulled because the Cubs continue to monitor what\u2019s already a career-high workload.\n\u201cWe want a healthy Cade Horton,\u201d manager Craig Counsell said. \u201cWe want a strong Cade Horton for the rest of the season. So we\u2019re going to have to make some tough decisions, that\u2019s just part of it. It\u2019s the right thing to do for the team and for Cade.\u201d\nHorton understands the thinking, and while he said he feels good, he knows there\u2019s more at stake to consider. His focus is just taking the ball when it\u2019s given to him and attacking hitters while he\u2019s on the mound.\nAs a former top prospect, Horton has had pressure on him to produce for a while. He entered last season as arguably the best pitching prospect in baseball. But a shoulder injury cut his season short, limiting him to just 34 1/3 innings.\nAdvertisement\nThis spring, he came into camp determined to stay healthy with a cleaned-up delivery and a focus on getting back to the pitcher he\u2019d been early in his professional career. The one who showed enough promise to get drafted by the Cubs seventh overall in 2022. His previous success is what he draws upon to build himself up and make sure he believes he can always get the job done.\n\u201cThere has to be a level of confidence just to have success in this league,\u201d Horton said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really hard league. If you don\u2019t believe in yourself, then it\u2019s going to be even harder.\u201d\nRecently, Horton has made this \u201creally hard league\u201d look easy. The righty hasn\u2019t allowed a run in 23 1/3 innings. Over his last six starts, he has a 1.05 ERA. The Cubs clung to Horton because they see him as someone who continues to improve as the season has gone along.\n\u201cCade\u2019s done a great job for us,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cHe\u2019s developed really well and I think he\u2019s going to get better. I think even from start to start, you see him make adjustments and make changes, you\u2019re going to continue to see that improvement.\u201d\nTeammates and coaches have been most impressed by Horton\u2019s poise. Near the end of June, Horton had his worst start of his career in Houston. He gave up seven earned runs in four innings, allowing a pair of homers and walking four. He\u2019s made six starts since, with five of them being scoreless outings.\n\u201cI feel like that terrible start in Houston made him better,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t scare him off, it didn\u2019t bother him. I feel like he has the make up to handle big starts and big moments and he has the athleticism and feel to get better.\u201d\nHorton\u2019s mental toughness is rare for a rookie. Pitchers are going to have bad outings. They\u2019re going to give up home runs and they\u2019re going to walk batters. What you do next is how you\u2019ll be judged. Horton is able to control the moment and not let the bad take over in his mind or on the field.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThere\u2019s a discipline to Cade about what\u2019s important to him,\u201d Counsell said. \u201cAnd that also means what\u2019s not important to him, blocking out the stuff that\u2019s not important. You\u2019re a little stubborn about the things that matter to you. That\u2019s how you keep clear-headed and don\u2019t let outside things or smaller things get in your way. That\u2019s what Cade is good at.\u201d\nCounsell has repeatedly compared Horton to Steele as someone who is able to flush mistakes almost immediately and move on to the next moment. For Steele, it was a process to find that mindset. For Horton, he\u2019s seemingly had it since the moment he arrived in the big leagues.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really impressive,\u201d catcher Carson Kelly said. \u201cThe first time he got called up and threw his first game, you could just see he was in control of everything. Even when guys are on base, the poise that he had, you\u2019re seeing that play right now as well.\u201d\nHoyer didn\u2019t make the splashy addition at the trade deadline. There\u2019s no ace being brought in to team up with Imanaga and Matthew Boyd. But there seems to be a belief in Horton right now that he can do special things. That\u2019s partly why Hoyer was unwilling to part with him at the deadline.\nAfter dominating in the College World Series with Oklahoma, the Cubs became enamored with Horton. Despite a brief college career due to injury, they were betting on the flashes he showed during those final months when he stepped up in the biggest moments. Now they\u2019re hoping he can continue to deliver over the final two months of the season and into October.\n\u201cHe\u2019s making a big impact right now,\u201d Counsell said. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s important. We got a long way to go.\u201d\n(Photo: Justin Casterline / Getty Images)"

      "text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 If there were any lingering concerns about Shohei Ohtani\u2019s health, his most emphatic two-way performance in a Los Angeles Dodgers uniform might have put that to bed.\nOhtani flashed a fastball against the St. Louis Cardinals that exceeded 100 mph six times and topped out at 101 while completing four innings for the first time in his gradual build-up after his injury. The only hits he allowed did not leave the infield; Miguel Rojas lost Jordan Walker\u2019s pop-up in the sun, with Walker later scoring on an Alec Burleson bunt single.\nAdvertisement\nOhtani struck out eight, including the last four batters he faced, while throwing a season-high 53 pitches. At the plate, he belted a two-run homer.\n\u201cI thought it was a big day for me personally,\u201d Ohtani said through interpreter Will Ireton.\nIn all, the reigning National League MVP did his best to buck the notion he was ailing. Ohtani exited his most recent start on the mound with right hip cramps, a startling sight amid his rehab from a second major elbow ligament reconstruction.\nSo this was a welcome sight all around, save for the result. Ohtani stood in the on-deck circle representing the winning run when Alex Freeland grounded out to finish a 5-3 loss as the Dodgers dropped another series in an uneven start to the second half.\nSince RBI became official in 1920, Shohei Ohtani is the only MLB player to:\n\u2013 hit a home run\n\u2013 strike out 8+ batters\n\u2013 drive in more runs (2) than he allowed (1)\n\u2013 draw more walks (1) than he allowed (0)The Dodgers still ended up losing. pic.twitter.com/xZgfIkTmRh\n\u2014 OptaSTATS (@OptaSTATS) August 7, 2025\nStill, Ohtani got through the outing healthy, inching towards the five-inning threshold that the Dodgers want to get him to before October. He also continued to show life with the bat, even on a day when he pitched. Since June 1, when his pitching rehab really ramped up, he has an .896 OPS. It was 1.062 before that. It\u2019s a slight downturn, but with Ohtani, even the slightest dip matters so much.\nWith his third-inning homer, he swung the Dodgers\u2019 one-run deficit into a one-run lead. Matthew Liberatore left a belt-high sinker over the plate and Ohtani punished it, driving it 109.5 mph off his bat to the opposite field to give the Dodgers a 2-1 lead.\nWednesday was a full manifestation of what Ohtani can do that no one else can. It marked the fourth time in his major-league career (and first since his second surgery) that he hit 100 mph on the mound and hit a home run at least 100 mph in the same game. It\u2019s the type of fun fact you know he\u2019s done more than anyone else without even having to look it up. Because it\u2019s Ohtani.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d Miguel Rojas said. \u201cHe was in the game late last night, running the bases, then he comes in today and pitches like he did, hits a homer. It\u2019s crazy what he can do.\u201d\nOhtani\u2019s homer was his 1,000th hit since arriving in the majors in 2018. He\u2019s been a unicorn in the sport ever since. Ohtani remains alone among two-way players, but even Ohtani hasn\u2019t done this during a pennant race for a team actively trying to map out how to best utilize him in October. That adds something every time Ohtani takes the mound, which is why the Dodgers are being so cautious. If he gets hurt, it impacts their lineup even more than it does their rotation.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing right now is essentially house money,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cIt\u2019s additive, being a two-way player. So then, we got to be mindful of Shohei, now and also going forward.\u201d\nOhtani said he is considering adjusting his workout schedule to accommodate his added workload. He is human, even when what he\u2019s doing doesn\u2019t seem so. This time, he even accepted some water from Will Ireton after finishing the top of the first inning and before leading off the bottom half. Most times, he\u2019s declined to take a sip.\nBefore making his return from an injury he feared would cost him his season, Max Muncy forgot to check a box. He never slid, never tested out his injured knee by pounding it into the dirt to see how it would feel.\nHe passed that test in the eighth inning of Tuesday night\u2019s 12-6 win, going from first to third on a Michael Conforto single and sliding with his left knee down to beat the throw. He did so mere feet away from where he was crumpled in a heap just 34 days earlier when Michael A. Taylor crashed into his leg.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to know that nothing\u2019s going to break when you slide,\u201d Muncy said.\nHe already knew his swing was in a good place. As soon as he could, Muncy began tracking pitches on the team\u2019s Trajekt Arc pitching machine, hoping to keep his timing from the torrid two months that preceded his injury. He still went hitless in the first nine at-bats of his rehab assignment.\nAdvertisement\nCoaches at Triple-A Oklahoma City deduced that his hands were too far from his body. The correction worked. He homered on the first pitch he saw on Tuesday, his second game off the injured list. That was a good sign. An even better sign came in his next at-bat, when he met a Miles Mikolas fastball at the top of the zone and sent it over the fence for his second home run of the game.\n\u201cI was getting to the pitches at the top of the zone. As long as I\u2019m doing that, I feel like my swing is in a really good spot,\u201d Muncy said.\nThe four-hit night came amid the largest Dodgers offensive eruption since before Muncy\u2019s five-week absence. They hadn\u2019t scored double-digit runs in a game since June 22 before romping, 12-6. It turns out, the Dodgers\u2019 offense looks a lot better with Muncy, Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez (three extra-base hits Tuesday, including a home run) and Mookie Betts (who had his first three-hit night since June 7) all going in it.\nIt is perhaps most true about Muncy. He is the Dodgers\u2019 metronome, even when he scuffles. His propensity to work counts is a tone-setter. His presence makes a talented group appear deeper. It\u2019s not an exact science, but the Dodgers have simply done a better job of scoring runs with Muncy in the lineup than they have without him.\nIn the 89 games he\u2019s started, the Dodgers have scored 5.64 runs per game. In the 40 games Muncy hasn\u2019t started, the Dodgers have averaged just 3.95 runs per game.\n\u201cThat presence in the lineup is so additive and just makes everyone around him better,\u201d Roberts said.\nAlex Vesia has represented rare stability in the Dodgers\u2019 bullpen for much of this season. But his stuff wasn\u2019t crisp in the eighth inning on Wednesday when he was tasked with a one-run lead. No pitcher in baseball is better at getting induced vertical break \u2014 or \u201chop\u201d to his fastball to get swing-and-miss.\nAdvertisement\nIt wasn\u2019t there as the Cardinals built an inning off of him with a pair of singles. Brock Stewart had been warming in the bullpen. The trade deadline acquisition was acquired for his ability to silence right-handed hitters like Walker, but he remained in the bullpen as Vesia looked to wriggle his way out of the frame.\nWhen Vesia left a two-out, 1-1 slider to Walker, the batter laced it to left for a game-tying single. Freeland\u2019s ensuing throw from third base trickled into the outfield, allowing the go-ahead run to score.\n\u201cJust rushed it,\u201d Freeland said.\nRoberts had to gamble. This would\u2019ve been Stewart\u2019s third outing in four days, and he likely wouldn\u2019t be available for the ninth if used in the eighth. That would\u2019ve entrusted the ninth to Blake Treinen, who has had a shaky return off the injured list and was the lone reliever left available.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to kind of try to figure out,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIf I could guarantee that Brock would have got the guy, got (Masyn) Winn out, or Walker out, and then I could guarantee that Blake doesn\u2019t give up a run in the ninth inning. Then it\u2019s a no-brainer. But I can\u2019t live in that world.\u201d\nThe ninth inning revealed other land mines. For as much as Stewart has dominated righties, left-handed hitters had opened the day with a .928 OPS against him. The veteran continued that trend in the ninth, when he allowed a leadoff single to the left-handed hitting Brendan Donovan (after hitting the right-handed hitting Iv\u00e1n Herrera) and allowed a run-scoring double off the wall to lefty Lars Nootbaar.\n\u201cJust haven\u2019t been very sharp,\u201d said Stewart, who has allowed runs in two of his three appearances since the trade.\nIt\u2019s still far from a complete unit right now, even as the Dodgers project optimism for what it could look like in October.\n(Photo of Shohei Ohtani: Luke Hales / Getty Images)"

      "text": "ALLENTOWN, Pa. \u2014 He turned to face the outfield from the mound and adjusted his sleeves, waiting as the batter reached for his gear and placed it on the ground before heading to first base.\nAndrew Painter had just issued a four-pitch walk, with none of his offerings near the zone. He seemed unruffled. As J.C. Escarra made his way to first, Painter was looking at the defensive alignment behind him and getting ready to do it all over again. More pitches. More chances for redemption.\nAdvertisement\nSuch has been life for Painter, the Philadelphia Phillies\u2019 top prospect, who is riding the ups and downs of returning from Tommy John surgery with Triple-A Lehigh Valley this season.\n\u201cPart of the fun of this year has been, when I\u2019ve gotten knocked down, it\u2019s like \u2014 you still have another start,\u201d Painter told The Athletic. \u201c(It\u2019s) not confirmed when my next start is, but if I do go Sunday, that\u2019s another time against the same lineup. I can\u2019t do anything about what happened tonight. That\u2019s in the past. But what are the adjustments I need to make and how can I overcome that in my next start?\u201d\nAgainst the New York Yankees\u2019 Triple-A affiliate Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders, Painter went four innings, allowing five hits, five earned runs, four walks and striking out four at Coca-Cola Park on Tuesday. He had limited feel for the zone, throwing 90 pitches and 47 for strikes. He struggled to make adjustments. Two years removed from surgery, the right-hander is struggling the most he has, on the greatest stage he\u2019s played on.\nPainter had excelled at each stop before now. He finished his senior year of high school in 2021 with a 0.31 ERA in 45 1/3 innings. He sailed from Low-A Clearwater to High-A Jersey Shore to Double-A Reading in 2022, ending with a combined ERA of 1.56 and 155 strikeouts in 103 2/3 innings.\nHe was on a seemingly straightforward, lightning-fast path to the majors until he was diagnosed with a UCL sprain in March 2023. Then came the operation in July, leading to a shutdown of more than a year.\nNow, Painter owns a 4.88 ERA across 72 innings pitched with Lehigh Valley this season. He has struck out 71 and walked 29. Struggles have come in waves: giving up six runs then putting together a scoreless, a 100-pitch outing with one run on July 30 before getting dinger for a four-run first inning on Tuesday.\nIt took Andrew Painter 34 pitches to get through the first inning. The fastball location was unideal. 4-0, RailRiders. pic.twitter.com/fth6EuIvLh\n\u2014 Charlotte Varnes (@charlottevarnes) August 5, 2025\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a rollercoaster this year,\u201d Painter said. \u201cThere\u2019s times where I feel great, and I can\u2019t miss the strike zone. There\u2019s other times where I don\u2019t know where the ball is going.\u201d\nTuesday was one of those nights. The RailRiders loaded up on lefties, playing eight against Painter. Southpaws are among his biggest problems; entering Tuesday, lefties batted .311 with an .881 OPS against him.\nAdvertisement\nThe pitches Painter trusts against lefties did not deliver. He could not locate his fastball, which spun arm-side up. The changeup, he thought, wasn\u2019t competitive. The curveball was off.\nPainter had multiple four-pitch walks where his fastball was not near the zone. He threw 11 first-pitch strikes while facing 21 batters, an advantage he could not build on. But, for the most part, he lived in hitter\u2019s counts.\n\u201cFirst inning, four (runs) came through,\u201d Painter said. \u201cTwo of them were from walks. At that point, you\u2019re just kind of handing it to them. Being in the zone \u2014 that\u2019s something I usually pride myself on, is the command, and being in the zone early. I just kind of didn\u2019t have it tonight.\u201d\nCommand can sometimes take the longest to return after Tommy John surgery. And recovery from the procedure, of course, is not linear. That is reality, one that does not square neatly with the \u201cJuly-ish\u201d timeline the Phillies initially set for Painter\u2019s MLB debut.\nWhen the calendar flipped to July and Painter struggled, the tone changed.\n\u201cWill we see him (within a month)?\u201d president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski said last Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\nThe Phillies knew he would struggle at points. They\u2019re impressed with what he\u2019s done \u2014 throwing 100 pitches, how he\u2019s handled adversity.\nBut the club has backed away from its previous timeline for MLB arrival. There are logistics involved. Should Painter debut this season, it would most likely be after Aaron Nola\u2019s return to the rotation and Taijuan Walker\u2019s to the bullpen. That would mean the Phillies would have to utilize a six-man rotation. Adding a sixth man is not a conversation the Phillies are having now, manager Rob Thomson said Sunday, but one they could have with a long stretch of games without a day off coming up. But Walker, who pitched six scoreless innings against the Baltimore Orioles on Tuesday, could be a better fit for a sixth spot given Painter\u2019s progression.\nAdvertisement\nStill, Painter\u2019s stuff is solid. The fastball sat around 96.4 on Tuesday, just below his Triple-A average of 96.8, and is strong when located. His curveball has a whiff rate of 28.6 percent. There has been work on his slider, catcher Garrett Stubbs said, because the previous version wasn\u2019t the \u201cwipeout pitch\u201d Painter wanted it to be.\nBut there is still much to learn about pitching. He often comes up to coaches during games, manager Anthony Contreras said, asking questions about what to do and when.\nOne conversation in early June entailed how to pitch with the infield in, depending on whether he wanted a strikeout, lazy pop-up or a ground ball.\n\u201cWe start talking about like, \u2018Hey, what pitches and what sequence would get those results?\u2019\u201d Contreras said. \u201cThings like that \u2014 controlling the running game, understanding what the game and the score is telling us. Because when you have a good understanding of what the game is telling you to do, you can slow a lot of things down.\u201d\nPitching coach Matt Ellmyer said he and colleague Phil Cundari brainstorm what to talk about with Painter, whether it\u2019s a specific fastball location or executing a slider or changeup.\n\u201cAnd he\u2019ll beat us to the jump,\u201d Ellmyer said, \u201cBecause he\u2019s thinking about it himself. He\u2019s thinking with us. He\u2019s very curious. I think he\u2019s doing a great job, narrowing those blinders when he needs to, but he\u2019s also very open to finding out what we can do to get him to the next place that he needs to be to continue to be successful.\u201d\nCommand has been the pitching core\u2019s biggest focus since Painter arrived in Allentown, Ellmyer said. Even the conversations have taken a step forward since then, he said, going from Painter \u201ckind of having an idea of how he wants to attack guys and where he wants to go with it, to really owning that process.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nBeing competitive has been an emphasis, too, especially when things spiral like they did on Tuesday. There have been flashes of a competitive pitcher on the mound, Painter said. Other times, he said, \u201cstuff goes downhill, and it goes downhill quick.\u201d\n\u201cSo, just trying to figure out how to make those adjustments and prevent that from happening, and pick up on it earlier,\u201d he said.\nPainter left the mound after four innings on Tuesday, his teammates high-fiving him as he walked back into the dugout. He was done pitching around 8:15. About two hours later, after the 7-1 Lehigh Valley loss, Painter and his coaches huddled to review the performance.\nThere was a lot to talk about.\nThere will continue to be ups and downs for Painter as the recovery process continues. He is working hard to figure out what\u2019s next, what he can do to become better. Each start is an opportunity.\n\u201cHe\u2019s getting wrapped up in the game,\u201d Phillies pitching coach Caleb Cotham said.\n(Photo of Painter in May: Olivia Damato / MLB Photos via Getty Images)"

      "text": "One of the many things front office executives accomplish at the general managers\u2019 meetings is to meet with their counterparts and learn each team\u2019s needs and goals for the offseason. They also share which players they have interest in trading for, which players they are trying to move and which other players from their team are potentially available.\nAdvertisement\nBefore this week\u2019s GM meetings in San Antonio, Texas, I reached out to decision-makers in all 30 MLB front offices to get their team\u2019s offseason needs and goals directly from them. I\u2019ve listed their responses below. I\u2019ve also included my thoughts on areas some teams need to improve and what I\u2019ve been hearing about free agency from people in the game this offseason.\nAmerican League East\nBaltimore Orioles\nBring back or replace Corbin Burnes, Anthony Santander and James McCann; add pitching and depth\nThe Orioles are going to do everything they can to re-sign Burnes, whom I ranked as the No. 2 free agent in this class. If they can\u2019t, they\u2019ll pivot to the next best starting pitchers on the market such as Max Fried, Blake Snell and Nathan Eovaldi. They also want to bring back Santander, who won\u2019t be easy to sign with so many teams looking to add corner outfield power. And finally, they\u2019ll look to improve their pitching staff overall.\nBoston Red Sox\nStarting pitching, relief pitching and a right-handed hitter\nThe Red Sox want to improve their rotation and bullpen this winter and I expect them to land at least one impact starter in free agency. They\u2019d also like to add a right-handed hitter to their lineup and are flexible on the position.\nNew York Yankees\nRe-sign Juan Soto, upgrade first base, address second base, third base and left field\nRe-signing Soto is the top priority but the Yankees have a long laundry list of areas to improve, from base running to team defense. If Soto departs, they\u2019ll move Aaron Judge back to right field and then decide if they view Jasson Dom\u00ednguez as their next center fielder or left fielder. They have to decide whether Jazz Chisholm Jr. will stay at third base or move to second base, depending on whether they bring back second baseman Gleyber Torres. They have to solve first base with Anthony Rizzo\u2019s departure; if they don\u2019t re-sign Soto, both Pete Alonso and Christian Walker become first-base alternatives to consider. It will be an interesting and eventful offseason for the AL champions.\nGO DEEPER\nTop 45 MLB free agents for 2024-25 with contract predictions, team fits: Will Soto get $600M+?\nTampa Bay Rays\nA place to play; catcher and a left-handed hitter\nTropicana Field\u2019s roof was blown off during Hurricane Milton and the field has no drainage system \u2014 it never needed one because it had a roof and features turf, not real grass. The team would either have to install a drainage system or fix the roof, and both options might be too costly considering the Rays are supposed to move into a new stadium in 2028. They could consider playing at spring training complexes in Dunedin, Clearwater or the Disney complex in Orlando; the league would prefer the Rays stay within their market in Florida. In terms of player personnel, the Rays will be searching for a long-term answer at catcher or another stopgap and also will be pursuing inexpensive left-handed hitters to complement their roster.\nAdvertisement\nToronto Blue Jays\nSign their stars, trade for or sign complementary impact players\nOnce again, the Blue Jays need to try to re-sign their young stars, shortstop Bo Bichette and first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr., who both will be eligible for free agency after next season. Then, through free agency or trades, they need to surround them with at least two more impactful players. The areas of focus are corner outfield, second base and third base, in that order. The Blue Jays also need to upgrade their pitching staff. They have a lot of work to do this offseason, and no front office in the sport is under more pressure.\nAmerican League Central\nChicago White Sox\nImprove the entire organization, from top to bottom\nThe 2024 White Sox were one of the worst major-league teams ever. But the team got off to a strong start this offseason, hiring Will Venable as its new manager. Venable was the Rangers\u2019 associate manager under Bruce Bochy the past two years and will be able to handle the 100-loss seasons his new team could be dealing with for the next few years.\nNo team needs to improve more \u2014 in absolutely every area \u2014 than the White Sox. Their two biggest trade assets on the major-league roster are lefty ace Garrett Crochet and center fielder Luis Robert Jr. The White Sox don\u2019t have to trade either one, but to get better in the long run, it makes sense to deal them in separate trades, especially if they can get three to five legit prospects for each to help expedite their rebuild. The White Sox have made it clear to opposing GMs that they\u2019ll at least listen on both players.\nCleveland Guardians\nImprove starting pitching and add a bat, likely in the outfield\nThe Guardians made it to the ALCS with the youngest roster in the major leagues, which bodes well for the future. Cleveland is loaded with players who aren\u2019t yet eligible for arbitration, making a splash move much easier than in prior years. They will focus on improving the starting rotation and will pursue former Guardians Shane Bieber and Matthew Boyd in free agency. They\u2019d also like to add an impact bat; in all likelihood, it will be an outfielder.\nAdvertisement\nDetroit Tigers\nPitching and a right-handed bat\nThe Tigers made great progress this year and finally got a taste of a pennant race and the postseason. They are expected to be aggressive this offseason as they look to improve their starting rotation and add a right-handed bat. Because their roster has significant flexibility, that bat could come from almost any position.\nKansas City Royals\nTop-of-the-lineup on-base player, a middle-of-the-order bat and bullpen depth\nThe Royals\u2019 offseason got off to an auspicious start with the signing of Michael Wacha to a three-year, $51 million deal that allows them to run back the same starting rotation they rode to the playoffs this past season. They have made it clear they\u2019re looking for a leadoff hitter who is an on-base machine and can create traffic for Bobby Witt Jr., Vinnie Pasquantino and Salvador Perez in the middle of their lineup. They also want to lengthen that part of the lineup by adding another bat. GM J.J. Picollo will look to add more bullpen depth as well.\nMinnesota Twins\nPitching and right-handed outfield corner bat\nThe Twins ended the season with a 12-27 thud after struggling all year to keep their star players \u2014 including shortstop Carlos Correa, center fielder Byron Buxton and third baseman Royce Lewis \u2014 healthy. They will need the trio to stay on the field more in 2025 if they want to return to the postseason. They\u2019ll spend the winter trying to add more pitching depth and a complementary right-handed-hitting corner outfielder, likely without adding to the team\u2019s payroll. Don\u2019t expect huge moves from the Twins this offseason; rather, they will be tinkering in those areas.\nAmerican League West\nAthletics\nUpgrade starting pitching and third base\nThe Athletics are no longer shopping players on their major-league roster after making significant progress last season, improving from 50-112 in 2023 to 69-93 in 2024. Instead, they are offering to trade prospects from their farm system to address their biggest needs, which they believe are starting pitching and third base. The A\u2019s feel they are getting closer to contending \u2014 by 2024 or 2025, while the team is playing in Sacramento and before it relocates to Las Vegas. Their moves will reflect that organizational timetable.\nHouston Astros\nRe-sign Alex Bregman, add a left-handed-hitting outfielder and a depth starter and improve the bullpen\nIt will be interesting to see if the Astros\u2019 contract offer to Bregman is for more years than they were willing to give Carlos Correa and George Springer, both of whom previously left in free agency after receiving shorter-term offers from Houston. They have made Bregman their top offseason priority, but will they do enough to keep him?\nAdvertisement\nLos Angeles Angels\nImprove second base, third base and center field; add pitching\nThe Angels have already added a power bat, acquiring outfielder/designated hitter Jorge Soler from the Braves in a swap for righty Griffin Canning. They also are finalizing a one-year deal with righty Kyle Hendricks, according to sources briefed on the negotiations. Now they\u2019re focused on improving at second and third base and in center field. General manager Perry Minasian always looks to add pitching at every level \u2014 and will do so again. The Angels are making organizational progress, but at a turtle\u2019s pace; a good offseason could expedite their timeline.\nSeattle Mariners\nSolidify the corner infield spots\nThe Mariners had the best rotation in baseball and still didn\u2019t make the postseason because of a weak offense that led the majors in strikeouts. They\u2019re looking to put the ball in play more and are focused on improving the infield corners. Several strong corner infielders \u2014 including Pete Alonso and Christian Walker at first base and Alex Bregman and Willy Adames at third base \u2014 are free agents. (Adames is a shortstop but can play third base.)\nTexas Rangers\nAdd starting pitching, multiple relievers and a left-handed hitter\nThe Rangers want to improve their starting pitching via free agency and/or trades and plan to add multiple relievers. They\u2019re also looking for a left-handed hitter to better balance their lineup. General manager Chris Young and manager Bruce Bochy are obsessed with getting back to the World Series and Texas will be aggressive this winter in pursuit of that goal.\nNational League East\nAtlanta Braves\nStarting pitching\nThe Braves could lose both Max Fried and Charlie Morton in free agency this offseason. They\u2019ve made several offers to Fried and will continue trying to re-sign him and hoping Morton decides to hold off on retirement. They\u2019re also hoping Spencer Strider returns early next season from internal-brace elbow surgery and pitches like himself. More questions than answers though. Therefore, a key focus this winter will be to bring back those pitchers or replace them via free agency or trade. I also think the Braves could use an upgrade in left field.\nAdvertisement\nMiami Marlins\nImprove offense; continue building all aspects of the organization\nThe Marlins are building their organization from scratch under the leadership of president of baseball operations Peter Bendix, who is doing it with the same model that he followed as a member of the Tampa Bay Rays. Miami\u2019s major-league team desperately needs upgrades on offense and the Marlins prefer to find those via trade rather than free agency. However, the most daunting task facing them is the revamping of their front office and various departments (scouting, player development, analytics) after widespread staff changes; they\u2019ve gotten a head start but have a long way to go to become the Miami version of the Rays.\nNew York Mets\nStarting pitching, signing a star position player\nPut your seat belt on: Steve Cohen is the wealthiest of the 30 MLB owners and he\u2019s ready to spend. Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns has the keys and ample funds to work with. The Mets will be chasing Corbin Burnes and every other top starting pitcher on the market. They\u2019ll be involved in the Juan Soto sweepstakes. They\u2019ll look to bring back Pete Alonso while pursuing similar talents on the open market. If you\u2019re a Mets fan, the second half of the season and the playoff run were fun \u2014 a lot of fun \u2014 but this offseason has a chance to be even better.\nPhiladelphia Phillies\nRight-handed reliever and impact outfielder\nHigh-leverage relievers Carlos Est\u00e9vez and Jeff Hoffman have hit free agency and the Phillies are unlikely to re-sign both, though a reunion with one is still possible. They will be aggressive in trying to sign a reliever in free agency. In addition, don\u2019t be surprised if they make a stealth run at Juan Soto. Dave Dombrowski\u2019s calling card has always been to pursue the biggest stars on the market \u2014 and with J.T. Realmuto and Kyle Schwarber coming off the books after 2025 and Nick Castellanos coming off after 2026, the Phillies have plenty of future payroll space to shock the world and sign him. Soto is close friends with shortstop Trea Turner and Dombrowski has done many big deals with Soto\u2019s agent, Scott Boras, over the years.\nWashington Nationals\nTwo power bats to surround their developing young hitters and a depth starter; improve team defense\nAdvertisement\nThe Nationals are making progress as an organization and are ready to make a splash signing or two this offseason. Their top priority is to add middle-of-the-order impact bats \u2014 and free agents such as Anthony Santander, Pete Alonso, Willy Adames and Alex Bregman would fit that bill and be significant upgrades. The last time the Nationals were building a world championship club, they overpaid for free-agent outfielder Jayson Werth. It won\u2019t surprise me if history repeats itself and they sign one of the four aforementioned hitters \u2014 even if an overpay is the only way to land them. The Nationals also want to add starting pitching depth and improve their team defense. (They were third in the majors with 109 errors this past season.)\nNational League Central\nChicago Cubs\nAdd two star players\nThe Cubs have built a competitive team but now need to build a contending team \u2014 and that will mean adding stars to their roster this winter. This offseason has started well for them: Center fielder Cody Bellinger opted into his contract for 2025 and manager Craig Counsell is upgrading his coaching staff. Now the Cubs must focus on adding a star player to the middle of the lineup and improving their bullpen with more quality and depth. They have some leeway on the position area of a star because so many of their players have positional flexibility.\nCincinnati Reds\nAdd a starter, bullpen upgrades, a bat (either 3B or corner OF) and a backup catcher; improve overall defense\nThe Reds have already had a successful offseason after hiring manager Terry Francona, who knows how to win the World Series and, more importantly, how to develop young players. This team will be vastly better with Francona at the helm. In terms of their roster, the Reds want to add a starter if they can\u2019t re-sign Nick Martinez. They want to add another hitter, preferably a corner outfielder, but acquiring a third baseman is also on the table. They need to improve their team defense after committing the fifth-most errors in baseball last season and would like to add a backup catcher too.\nMilwaukee Brewers\nBring back Willy Adames or replace his offensive production if he signs elsewhere\nThe Brewers\u2019 goal is to run it back with basically the same group that won the NL Central. Willy Adames was a key part of that team and they\u2019re trying to convince the free-agent shortstop to stay. If he departs, they will need to trade or sign an above-average bat to replace his offense. The Brewers are comfortable moving second baseman Brice Turang to shortstop if needed, which would give them positional flexibility in picking a replacement bat.\nGO DEEPER\nMLB GM meetings: Willy Adames open to Brewers reunion, Blake Snell back on the market\nPittsburgh Pirates\nAn everyday bat\nThe Pirates feel confident about the progress of their rebuild and believe their rotation is good enough for them to contend next season. However, they know they need to improve their offense and will look to add an everyday bat this winter.\nSt. Louis Cardinals\nConsistent offense and bullpen arms\nIn his final year of running St. Louis\u2019 baseball operations, John Mozeliak will look to tweak, not overhaul the roster, but this is a team in transition. The Athletic\u2019s Katie Woo reports that the Cardinals will look to trade some of their top talent for prospects to restock their farm system. They want to rebuild through player development and scouting under Chaim Bloom, who will take over as their president of baseball operations in 2026. In terms of the major-league roster, they\u2019ll try to build a more consistent offense and improve their bullpen this offseason.\nAdvertisement\nNational League West\nArizona Diamondbacks\nOffense and bullpen help\nThe Diamondbacks hope to re-sign first baseman Christian Walker, but if they can\u2019t, they\u2019ll look to replace his bat. They\u2019ll seek to upgrade at designated hitter after Joc Pederson declined his mutual option and became a free agent. Like most teams, they\u2019ll add depth to their bullpen as well.\nColorado Rockies\nExperienced relievers and bench depth\nThe Rockies aren\u2019t expected to sign or trade for any big free agents (pitchers or position players). Instead, they are looking to add veteran relievers and bench depth to their young roster.\nLos Angeles Dodgers\nAddress shortstop, left field and right field; build organizational depth\nFirst up for the Dodgers this offseason: Design their World Series ring. But don\u2019t expect the defending champs to rest on their laurels; their goal is to build a dynasty. If Japanese star pitcher Roki Sasaki reaches free agency, it\u2019s expected he will be the Dodgers\u2019 first offseason signing. They could use an upgrade at shortstop and free agent Willy Adames would fit perfectly. President of baseball operations Andrew Friedman had Adames in his organization when he was GM of the Rays and loves him as a player and person.\nMookie Betts is expected to move back to the infield, probably to second base, which would open up right field; the Dodgers could make a run at Juan Soto to play in right and try to re-sign Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez for left field. (They made Hern\u00e1ndez the qualifying offer, which he is expected to decline.) They would like to re-sign starter Walker Buehler, who came out of the bullpen to close out their World Series win, but surprisingly didn\u2019t give him the QO. In addition, they\u2019re hoping to extend manager Dave Roberts and are expected to make him the highest-paid manager in MLB history.\nAdvertisement\nSan Diego Padres\nLeft field, shortstop and pitching\nLeft field and shortstop will be the Padres\u2019 two biggest needs if they are unable to re-sign Jurickson Profar and Ha-Seong Kim in free agency. They have a strong roster but of course with president of baseball operations A.J. Preller, anything is possible in terms of trades and signings. He\u2019s always looking for ways to improve his team, as we witnessed last season with his trades for Luis Arraez and Dylan Cease. He will be active.\nSan Francisco Giants\nAdd a middle-of-the-lineup star player, upgrade at shortstop, improve pitching staff\nThe Giants have new leadership with president of baseball operations Buster Posey and general manager Zack Minasian and it will be interesting to see if they can make a splash. Expect them to focus on free-agent starting pitchers and middle-of-the-order impact bats. Posey would like the Giants to improve at shortstop and I\u2019m hearing they\u2019re going to make a run at Willy Adames and Ha-Seong Kim in free agency. The Giants have the resources to sign top free agents (and did so last offseason), but can they convince any of them to come play in San Francisco?\n(Top image: Meech Robinson / The Athletic.

      "text": "Jen Pawol, a minor-league umpire since 2016, is set to make her major-league debut on Saturday, making her the first female umpire in regular-season MLB history.\nPawol is being called up for the Miami Marlins-Atlanta Braves doubleheader on Saturday, when she will work the bases for those two games. For Sunday\u2019s series finale, she is slated to be behind the plate\nAdvertisement\nPawol, a graduate of Hofstra University, called MLB spring training games in 2024, becoming the first female umpire to do so since 2007. She was only the third woman to ever umpire a major-league spring training game.\nMLB rules require a fifth member to be added to an umpiring crew when there is a doubleheader, as is the case for the Marlins and Braves on Saturday, because each home-plate umpire skips the game they aren\u2019t calling.\nPawol has been umpiring in the Triple-A International League since 2023 and was the first woman to umpire the International League championship game. She was the first woman to umpire a game at that level in 35 years.\nIn addition to making her MLB spring training debut last season, Pawol became a Triple-A crew chief, another significant step toward reaching the major leagues. Those who have worked with her in the minor leagues predicted she\u2019d one day reach the sport\u2019s upper echelon.\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to make it,\u201d Jonathan Ortega, who served as Pawol\u2019s crew chief in 2023, told The Athletic\u2019s Brittany Ghiroli last summer. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it will be one year or two years from now, but I think she\u2019s going to do it.\u201d\nOrtega called Pawol one of the hardest workers he\u2019s ever seen.\nA native of New Jersey, Pawol, 48, was a three-time Colonial Athletic Association All-Conference softball player while at Hofstra, where she was a catcher. After attending Southern Umpires Camp in Atlanta in January 2015, she was noticed by longtime MLB umpire Ted Barrett, who suggested she attend a one-day MLB umpiring camp. Coming out of that camp, Pawol won a scholarship to MLB\u2019s umpire academy. She officially began her umpiring career in the then-Rookie level Gulf Coast League in 2016 and since then has steadily climbed the minor-league ranks.\nThe NBA had its first female referee debut 28 years ago, while the NFL has had female officials for the past 10 years.\nAdvertisement\nThere have been only a handful of female umpires in the minor leagues, and only a few have gotten close to reaching the big leagues. Pam Postema was the first woman to umpire a big-league spring training game in 1989. She spent 13 seasons as a minor-league umpire and six years at Triple-A level but had her contract canceled before getting a chance to umpire a regular-season MLB game.\nRia Cortesio was the second woman to umpire an MLB spring game. But despite being rated the top-ranked umpire in Double-A Southern League, she was let go after nine seasons, with five spent at Double A.\nPawol has said that both Postema and Cortesio have been mentors.\n(Photo of Pawol from a spring game in 2024: Rich Storry / Getty Images)"

      "text": "The game took place nearly 17 years ago, yet it still pops up on social media.\n\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Toronto Blue Jays right-hander Max Scherzer said before a recent game in Detroit. \u201cPeople are constantly sending me that meme. I get a good chuckle out of it.\u201d\nClayton Kershaw isn\u2019t so sure. As the Los Angeles Dodgers left-hander walked into the dugout in Cincinnati, he shook his head when the subject was raised. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of that\u2019s true,\u201d he said.\nAdvertisement\nIn Kershaw\u2019s defense, it is hard to believe. But it is true. As Scherzer and Kershaw get set to square off Friday for the fifth time in their illustrious careers, it\u2019s the first matchup between the pitching stars that attracts attention.\nIn September 2008, two future Hall of Famers \u2014 Arizona\u2019s Randy Johnson and Los Angeles\u2019 Greg Maddux \u2014 were slotted to pitch the third game of a three-game series. Both were bumped in the days leading up to the contest. Johnson because of back issues. Maddux for matchup reasons.\nOn Sept. 7, the Diamondbacks\u2019 Scherzer and the Dodgers\u2019 Kershaw replaced them on a Sunday afternoon at Dodger Stadium. Both were MLB first-round draft picks. Both were in their rookie seasons. And as the years unfolded, both became among the best of their generation.\nSymmetry like this is what makes baseball so great and memorable. In this case, two future Hall of Famers replaced two future Hall of Famers.\nThat Scherzer and Kershaw faced each other as rookies is noteworthy in itself. Per STATS Perform research, the last time eventual Hall of Fame pitchers started against each other as rookies took place in the 19th century. On Sept. 22, 1890, Cy Young of the Cleveland Spiders started against Kid Nichols of the Boston Beaneaters in Ohio.\nImagine going to the ballpark to see a game between Greg Maddux and Randy Johnson, but get disappointed they get scratched for a young Max Scherzer and a young Clayton Kershaw. pic.twitter.com/gSvAt35sP8\n\u2014 BaseballHistoryNut (@nut_history) November 12, 2024\nMore than a century later, 54,000 fans watched Scherzer and Kershaw, not fully understanding what they were seeing. Famed broadcaster Vin Scully brought up the pitching switch in the bottom of the first inning. After Dodgers catcher Russell Martin flew out to right, a graphic flashed on the FSN Prime Ticket broadcast showing Johnson and Maddux.\n\u201cWell, supposedly, we were going to have two veterans, a 44-year-old Randy Johnson \u2026 with all of his victories, 294. (And) 42-year-old Greg Maddux with 354 victories. But under the headline and heading of the best-laid plans of mice and men, we have a 24-year-old Scherzer with no wins and a 20-year-old Kershaw with three. What a difference a day makes.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThat graphic has since turned into a meme, one Scherzer first noticed a couple years ago when he pitched for the Texas Rangers. Scherzer asked Mike Maddux, the Rangers\u2019 pitching coach and Greg\u2019s older brother, an impossible question.\n\u201cRandy and me vs. Maddux and Kershaw \u2014 who you got?\u201d\n(Without missing a beat, Scherzer recalled, Mike Maddux delivered the perfect response. \u201cWho are you guys\u2019 closers?\u201d)\nSometimes baseball games go beyond the final score. This is one. The masterful Maddux was in his final season. The intimidating Johnson chased 300 wins. Fresh-faced Scherzer and Kershaw were just getting started.\nOn a muggy afternoon in Cincinnati, Kershaw, 37, sat at his locker after a workout, sweat dripping from his face. The veteran left-hander looked at a photo taken from his major-league debut. Short hair. No beard. Almost half a lifetime ago.\n\u201cFifty-four,\u201d Kershaw said of his jersey number, which he modeled for just one game before switching to the 22 he has worn the rest of his career.\nKershaw doesn\u2019t have many memories from his rookie season, but he has no problem recalling his greatest hurdle. \u201cI was just trying to figure out how to throw strikes more than anything,\u201d he said.\nThe Dodgers had selected Kershaw out of Dallas Highland Park High School with the seventh overall pick in 2006, an MLB Draft stocked with pitching talent. At No. 10, the San Francisco Giants took University of Washington right-hander Tim Lincecum. At No. 11, the Diamondbacks picked Scherzer from the University of Missouri.\n\u201cA lot of Cy Youngs in that little group, isn\u2019t there?\u201d said former Dodgers general manager Ned Colletti, referring to baseball\u2019s top pitching award.\nEight total. Three each from Kershaw and Scherzer. Two from Lincecum. But excellence usually takes time, especially on the mound. As veteran pitcher Tom Gordon once explained to a young Scherzer, no one walks into this game an ace.\nIn 2008, Kershaw, only 20, was the youngest player in the big leagues. He had a strong fastball and a curveball that seemed to bend from the heavens. But he was a year from developing his devastating slider, and he had not yet mastered his command. This became troublesome, especially against disciplined opponents.\nAdvertisement\n\u201c(Hitters) knew he had a good fastball,\u201d then-Dodgers pitching coach Rick Honeycutt said, \u201cbut they also knew the curveball was always going to be thrown pretty much with two strikes or when he was ahead in the count. They were able to eliminate pitches, and that\u2019s what good hitters do.\u201d\nKershaw said he didn\u2019t pitch horribly as a rookie, but he also did not pitch to his standard. After one uneven start, he told reporters it\u2019d be nice if the Dodgers won \u201cnot in spite of me but because of me.\u201d In July, he was demoted to Double-AA Jacksonville, where he dominated. But in his first start back with the Dodgers, he was rocked in a 10-1 loss to the Colorado Rockies.\nStill, the flashes of greatness were impossible to ignore.\nBackup catcher Danny Ardoin said Kershaw looked like he had just stepped off his high school ball field. He teased him for trying to grow a beard. But Ardoin noticed a fearlessness from the rookie. He recalled a June game in Detroit when Kershaw\u2019s fastball was so sharp he didn\u2019t need to throw anything else.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even remember if we threw a breaking ball,\u201d Ardoin said. \u201cI mean, this is how electric his fastball was. He had command on both sides of the plate \u2014 up and down, in and out. We had gone four innings and then we had a rain delay, and it went too long to run him back out. Man, it was like, \u2018Gosh dang, what could\u2019ve happened that day?'\u201d\nAgainst the Diamondbacks, Kershaw battled. He needed 31 pitches to escape the first inning. In the second, he gave up a home run to Arizona catcher Chris Snyder. In the third, he gave up a home run to outfielder Adam Dunn.\nAfter striking out Stephen Drew to end the fourth, Kershaw walked off the mound and lowered his head. He had thrown 92 pitches. Of the 19 batters he faced, nine had worked three-ball counts. The Dodgers trailed 3-2, and his day was done.\n| Stat | Scherzer | Kershaw |\n|---|---|---|\nIP | 5 | 4 |\nER | 3 | 3 |\nHits | 4 | 6 |\nKs | 11 | 4 |\nBatters faced | 21 | 19 |\nPitches | 94 | 92 |\nIn 2008, the best years of Randy Johnson and Greg Maddux were behind them. Johnson had won five Cy Young Awards. Maddux, four. One was ready for life\u2019s next chapter. Another still had something to prove.\nJohnson the previous season had undergone back surgery for the second year in a row. He knew his skills had diminished. He knew he had to pitch to contact instead of trying to strike out everyone as he had done in his prime. Six wins from the 300-career milestone, he was not ready to retire.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt was such a pivotal year for me,\u201d Johnson said one morning at Arizona\u2019s spring-training complex in Scottsdale. (He would secure his 300th win the next season, his last, with the San Francisco Giants). \u201cI needed to prove to people that I was healthy. That I could still pitch.\u201d\nMaddux was in a different place. By Sept. 7, he had already decided that 2008 would be his final season. Although he felt fine, his fastball had lost some zip. More concerning, Maddux felt his competitive edge slipping.\nHe had not announced this publicly \u2014 Maddux had no interest in a farewell tour \u2014 but he had started to say goodbye in his own way. At each stop late in the season, he took time to acknowledge familiar faces, the ushers and security guards. Before taking the mound, Maddux paused to absorb his surroundings.\n\u201cI was just trying to make the most of it,\u201d he said in a phone conversation. \u201cI was very happy with the career I had had up to that point, and I knew I had like a month left. I was going to just try to suck in every moment that I possibly could.\u201d\nThe Dodgers had acquired Maddux from the San Diego Padres in August. Colletti knew what the future Hall of Famer brought. He had been in the Chicago front office when Maddux had broken in with the Cubs. He considered Maddux a genius. Someone who understood pitching better than anyone he had known. And although his Cy Young years were long gone, Colletti knew Maddux could help his pitchers, particularly Kershaw.\n\u201cWas he throwing 96? No. And probably never did,\u201d Colletti said. \u201cBut he knew how to pitch. He knew how to compete. And he knew how to talk to people and give them a piece of wisdom without really trying to do it.\u201d\nLike he did with his pitches, Maddux picked his spots. Former Dodgers relief pitcher Cory Wade, then in his rookie season, recalled an outing in Colorado during which he had not pitched well.\nAdvertisement\nIn the clubhouse, Maddux and Wade discussed Wade\u2019s pitch sequence. Maddux listened as Wade explained his thought process. He responded: \u201cThe next time, what if you thought about it this way?\u201d\n\u201cHe could\u2019ve just said, \u2018What the hell are you doing? You should\u2019ve thrown this,'\u201d Wade said. \u201cBut he wanted to figure out what I was actually thinking.\u201d\nMaddux learned how highly Kershaw was regarded almost immediately. While throwing his first side session with the Dodgers, Honeycutt had mentioned that the young left-hander was going to be special. Not much later, Maddux was spotted sitting next to Kershaw in the dugout during a game.\n\u201cThe way Greg watched games was impressive,\u201d Kershaw said. \u201cIt was fun to sit next to him in the dugout, and just kind of see it happen. That\u2019s why I still like to watch the game from the dugout, feel things happening, see things happening, and over time you can almost start to predict stuff. Greg was really good at that.\u201d\nMaddux takes no credit for helping Kershaw. More than anything, he simply understood what Kershaw experienced as a rookie, trying to find his way.\n\u201cI mean, you\u2019re 20 years old,\u201d Maddux said. \u201cYou\u2019re learning how to control your nerves. And really you\u2019re just brain-dead chucking. You haven\u2019t even got to the pitching part of it. Eventually, you settle down and realize that changing speed and locating fastballs is how you win.\u201d\nOf everyone at Dodger Stadium on Sept. 7, Blake DeWitt might have best understood Kershaw and Scherzer. As a rookie infielder with the Dodgers, DeWitt had teamed with Kershaw in the minors, and as a native of Sikeston, Missouri, he had played high school summer ball with Scherzer.\n\u201cTwo pretty similar people,\u201d said DeWitt, who had two hits that afternoon, one off Scherzer. \u201cThey have fun off the field, kind of joking, and all of a sudden, they\u2019re both kind of known for it, that game-day routine. There\u2019s nothing false about it. They just have an ability to lock in at another level that most people are not able to get to.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe Diamondbacks initially weren\u2019t sure if they wanted to use Scherzer as a starter or back-end relief pitcher. After starting the 2008 season at Triple-A Tucson, the intense right-hander made his major-league debut April 29 against the Houston Astros. Out of the bullpen, Scherzer threw 4 1/3 hitless innings, striking out seven.\n\u201cI remember we weren\u2019t really sure how long we were going to use him that night,\u201d said Bob Melvin, the former Diamondbacks manager who today manages the Giants. \u201cAnd he just started cutting through the lineup, and it was like, the longer we can take a look at this guy, the better.\u201d\nAt the time, Scherzer said he did not mind pitching in relief \u2014 he just wanted the ball. As he stood at his locker last month in Detroit, the 41-year-old had a different opinion. Starters are starters and relievers are relievers, he said. After his big-league debut, Scherzer started three games before pitching in relief for six. Then he missed a month because of shoulder fatigue.\n\u201cIt can really jack up your arm,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cIt\u2019s an experience I refer back to for young guys. Hey, let\u2019s break in a young guy in the pen. No! They did that to me. I understand why there\u2019s that thought. But when you condition your arm to pitch as a starter and have routines, to flip the script on that and try to go back to being a reliever in short bursts, and then convert back to being a starter, that can really do a number on your shoulder.\u201d\nScherzer had a 97-mph fastball that had \u201cspecial jump,\u201d former Diamondbacks pitching coach Bryan Price said. He mixed in a slider and changeup. But from the time Price first saw Scherzer on video, what stood out most was his presence. Scherzer had unusual confidence and competitiveness. His Arizona teammates noticed it as well.\n\u201cSometimes I would mess around with him the way he walked around the mound after he struck guys out,\u201d said former pitcher Dan Haren, a teammate of Scherzer\u2019s for two seasons in Arizona. \u201cHe kind of strutted, a little bit on his tiptoes with his shoulders up. \u2026 He had that swagger from the get-go.\u201d\nBut it wasn\u2019t all adrenaline. Former Arizona closer Brandon Lyon recalled Scherzer analyzing advanced stats on team flights, which wasn\u2019t as common as it is today. Scherzer told him he was studying the percentages of strikes he threw with each pitch, wondering if those rates were too high or too low.\nAdvertisement\nThought Lyon, then in his seventh season: \u201cWow, I just try to throw a strike every time.\u201d\nOn Sept. 7 against the Dodgers, Scherzer pitched five innings, giving up three runs on three hits and striking out 11. He produced 21 swings and misses. Price, who still has notes from the outing, had the rookie throwing first-pitch strikes to 9 of 21 batters. He had the fastball clocked at 91 to 97 mph, the slider at 82 to 87, and the changeup at 81 to 86.\nEven though Los Angeles won 5-3, it was the best outing of Scherzer\u2019s season, the first double-digit strikeout contest of his career. And it did not affect his confidence.\n\u201cYou walk into this clubhouse, either you\u2019re confident or you\u2019re not,\u201d Scherzer said in Detroit. \u201cYes or no. I\u2019m not going to let the results determine whether that changes on or off. From Day 1, it\u2019s always been the exact same.\u201d\nOn a recent day at Great American Ball Park, Kershaw walked into left field, carrying a bucket of baseballs. The grounds crew had not yet set up the cage for batting practice. No other player was on the field.\nDressed in workout shorts and a muscle T-shirt, Kershaw played catch with his oldest son, Charley. Then he threw batting practice, Charley swinging an aluminum bat and taking aim at the left-field fence not far away.\nPing.\n\u201cGet out of here!\u201d\nThump.\nOff the wall.\nKershaw and Scherzer are a long way from their rookie showdown. In their 18th seasons, they are aging pitchers on one-year contracts, trying to help their respective first-place teams win a championship. Kershaw this season is coming off toe and knee surgeries. Scherzer has battled thumb issues.\nTheir careers are remarkably similar. Aside from the Cy Young Awards, Scherzer has 218 wins, Kershaw 217. Both have topped 3,000 strikeouts. Scherzer has led the league in strikeouts three times, Kershaw has five ERA titles. Both are World Series champs. They even spent half a season together in 2021, Scherzer, then with the Washington Nationals, getting dealt to the Dodgers before the trade deadline.\n| Stat | Scherzer | Kershaw |\n|---|---|---|\nSeasons | 18 | 18 |\nStarts | 465 | 442 |\nW-L | 218-113 | 217-96 |\nERA | 3.18 | 2.52 |\nKs | 3,451 | 3,010 |\nIP | 2,919 | 2,808.1 |\nAll-Star Games | 8 | 11 |\nCy Young Awards | 3 | 3 |\nWorld Series titles | 2 | 2* |\n*Kershaw was not on the postseason roster for the Dodgers\u2019 2024 title due to injuries but still received a ring\n\u201cThe thing that people don\u2019t really see is just the battling back from injuries, not only physically, but the mental part,\u201d said Haren, who also teamed with Kershaw for a season in Los Angeles. \u201cAll the setbacks and issues, the bad backs, the shoulders, the hip, everything. It takes an absolute toll on you mentally, too. \u2026 They\u2019re guys, if you played with them, against them, when they\u2019re pitching, you\u2019re on the top step watching.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe intensity may not rage as it once did, but it\u2019s still there. In Detroit, Toronto southpaw Eric Lauer showed up for a postgame interview with a fat lip, explaining, jokingly, that he broke the cardinal rule of messing with Scherzer on a day Scherzer was scheduled to pitch. In Cincinnati, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said Kershaw still works and prepares as always, but \u201clike most things, there\u2019s been an adjustment period\u201d as he\u2019s aged.\nThat\u2019s normal.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between being thankful and being satisfied,\u201d said Kershaw, who\u2019s 5-2 with a 3.29 ERA this season. \u201cI\u2019m super thankful for everything this game has given me. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really ever changed, but there\u2019s a fine line you walk between being grateful and appreciative and being content. You got to keep getting better because everybody else is. You just got to keep going. I try to walk that line. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t always work, but I try the best I can.\u201d\nOn the day Scherzer made his seventh start of the season, one in which he pitched seven innings and struck out 11, the Baseball Hall of Fame inducted its 2025 class. Asked if he ever allowed himself to think about his day in Cooperstown, the veteran ace stayed firmly in the present.\n\u201cI\u2019m not here for my personal accomplishments,\u201d said Scherzer, 2-1 with a 4.39 ERA this season. \u201cI throw all that out the window. I\u2019m here to win the World Series. There\u2019s nothing else. I just want to be one of the guys. Having fun with everybody, competing with everybody, trying to win ball games. And just soak it all in.\u201d\nKershaw agreed. He said when he thinks of Cooperstown, the first thing that pops to mind is the Cooperstown All-Star Village, a popular U-12 national baseball tournament. Maybe one day one of his boys will want to play in it, Kershaw said. That\u2019s as far as he allows himself to go. Kershaw has never even visited the Hall of Fame, which inducted Maddux in 2014 and Johnson in 2015, the first step of completing the unique story from 2008.\nKershaw\u2019s excited to check it out.\n\u201cHopefully, some day,\u201d he said.\n(Top illustration: Kelsea Petersen / The Athletic; photos: Justine Willard / Getty Images, Rob Leiter / Getty Images)"

      "text": "ARLINGTON, Texas \u2014 Aaron Boone wasn\u2019t going to do it. The New York Yankees\u2019 manager left the dugout intending to remove reliever David Bednar, who was struggling and had already thrown a season-high 35 pitches. But when Boone reached the mound, he looked Bednar in the eyes.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take you here,\u201d Boone said.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bednar said, \u201cyou\u2019re not.\u201d\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s go. I got this guy.\u201d\nIt was all Boone needed to hear.\nAs he left the mound, the Yankees\u2019 infielders surrounding Bednar were fired up. Shortstop Anthony Volpe pounded his glove and yelled. It worked.\nBednar worked Adolis Garc\u00eda to a 2-2 count and then forced him to swing over a splitter near the bottom of the zone and over the plate. It was a clutch five-out save for Bednar, and for the Yankees, it was a 3-2 win over the Rangers at Globe Life Field, snapping their five-game losing streak and freeing them from a general malaise that appeared to be hanging over the club.\nAnd it signaled to the Yankees that they should seriously consider giving the ninth inning to Bednar for the rest of the season.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a dawg effort right there,\u201d Boone said.\n\u201cThat was awesome,\u201d first baseman Paul Goldschmidt said.\n\u201cTakes some grit to finish it off,\u201d starting pitcher Carlos Rod\u00f3n said.\nYankees Win \ud83d\udea8 Postgame coming up next on YES and The Gotham Sports App: https://t.co/sWMqNZ0hci pic.twitter.com/bJ7Qo6iqg8\n\u2014 YES Network (@YESNetwork) August 6, 2025\nThe victory meant the third-place Yankees would remain 6 1/2 games back of the first-place Toronto Blue Jays in the American League East.

But as I\u2019ve said, it\u2019s there for us. We\u2019ve got to go take this thing. I\u2019m steadfast that I believe that we\u2019ve got a great run in us. (I) believe in those guys in the room. But as we\u2019ve been saying kind of everyday, right, we\u2019ve got to go do it. This is just one win, definitely a little settling going into an off day, but we start a big home stand where we\u2019ve got to (put the) pedal down.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nIt also came after the Yankees watched Devin Williams \u2014 whom they hoped would finally seize the job \u2014 crumble in consecutive losses in Arlington. On Monday, Williams gave up a solo homer to blow a save and a one-run lead in the ninth inning. On Tuesday, he failed to protect a scoreless tie in the eighth inning, giving up two runs as the Yankees lost 2-0.\nThe Yankees acquired a trio of relievers at the deadline, two of whom had closer experience in Bednar and Camilo Doval. The moves were clear signs of the Yankees\u2019 shaky confidence in the bullpen in general, but also in Williams, who lost the role earlier in the year to Luke Weaver, only for the Yankees to give it back to him when Weaver went on the injured list.\nWilliams, one of the best relievers in the National League the last few years, has a 5.44 ERA in 47 games.\nBednar, meanwhile, had a 2.37 ERA and 17 saves in 42 appearances with the Pittsburgh Pirates before the Yankees traded for him at the deadline Thursday, and before he gave up two runs in his first appearance in his first day with the team Friday. Bednar bounced back with a scoreless frame Monday against the Rangers. He struggled in 2024, but he led the league with 39 saves in 2023. The job wouldn\u2019t be new to him.\nAll five of Bednar\u2019s outs came via strikeout on Wednesday. His 42 pitches were the most he\u2019d thrown in a game since 2022. The five-out save was his first since 2023.\nBednar fanned ex-Yankees Kyle Higashioka and Josh Smith in the eighth, and in the ninth, he struck out Rowdy Tellez and Sam Haggerty. Then he narrowly walked Corey Seager on a breaking ball that just missed the plate, and then Marcus Semien singled to right field.\nMeanwhile, in the bullpen, Doval was warming up. Boone didn\u2019t want to use him, since Doval had pitched in the previous two games. But he was getting desperate, having already used Mark Leiter Jr., Tim Hill and Yerry De Los Santos after Rod\u00f3n lasted five innings, giving up two runs.\nAdvertisement\nBednar said he didn\u2019t even see Boone leave the dugout. He saw catcher Ben Rice walking toward the mound for what he thought would be a visit to prepare for Garc\u00eda. He was straightforward with Boone.\n\u201cI told him I wanted (Garc\u00eda), and he agreed, and I just wanted to bear down and get that last one,\u201d Bednar said.\nThough Boone intended to pull Bednar, after the game, he suspected that maybe, in his heart, he wanted Bednar to make him change his mind. After all, he didn\u2019t signal to the bullpen immediately upon leaving the dugout. He let Bednar have a word.\n\u201cI mean, that\u2019s fair,\u201d Boone said. \u201cSo I was going out to make the move, but you\u2019re right. I didn\u2019t go right to it right away. So, maybe I did want to get a little feel from him.\u201d\nBoone trusted Bednar with the game on the line. He should do it again the next time there\u2019s a save opportunity.\n(Photo: Ron Jenkins / Getty Images)"

      "text": "On April 30, the Toronto Blue Jays\u2019 odds to win the American League East were at 7 percent. Now, with less than eight weeks remaining in baseball\u2019s arduous 162-game schedule, Toronto\u2019s odds of taking its first division title in a decade are nearly 70 percent.\nThe AL is wide open, and first-place Toronto is a legitimate candidate to play deep into October. It\u2019s a shift for a talented club that for years has fallen short of expectations but is now finally exceeding them. The Jays, who told free agents all winter they were all-in on the 2025 season, were still projected by FanGraphs to win 82 games and finish fourth in the AL East when the season began. Since May 1, they\u2019ve surged to a 53-32 record, a complete turnaround from a last-place finish in 2024 in which manager John Schneider acknowledged \u201ceverything went to sh\u2013.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nToronto \u2014 which has the benefit of deep-pocketed ownership in Rogers Communications Inc. \u2014 boasted a record payroll last year only to flounder and sell off expiring contracts at the trade deadline. The front office\u2019s message then wasn\u2019t that the team was giving up on its core group. Instead, they insisted, the trades were designed to bolster the farm system and turn things around quickly. Still, the wait-and-have-faith approach didn\u2019t exactly sit well with a restless Toronto fan base that hasn\u2019t seen a playoff series win since 2016.\nThe Jays \u2014 who stayed aggressive with last week\u2019s trade deadline additions \u2014 seem to have unlocked the promise of a talented core, which is playing with an exuberance that eluded previous iterations.\n\u201cIt mostly comes down to me not putting the pieces together appropriately,\u201d said general manager Ross Atkins, who wasn\u2019t quite on the hot seat this winter but was the source of significant fan frustration. \u201cWe needed to make an adjustment. We thought long and hard about our process and the alignment we had.\u201d\nIn 2021, Toronto scored 846 runs (5.22 runs a game). By last year, a team built more on run prevention scored just 671 runs (4.14 per game). Small tweaks, Atkins acknowledged, weren\u2019t working. The 2024 Jays featured a middling offense that hit the fifth-fewest home runs in baseball and ran the bases terribly. Only the Yankees (-16 runs) got less out of their legs than the Jays (-14), according to Statcast.\nThe offseason overhaul began with the hiring of hitting coach David Popkins, who made such an impression during his interview that he was offered the job that night. \u201cEasiest hire of my managerial career,\u201d said Schneider, who felt like his players were eager for more information and a modernized approach. Popkins and assistant hitting coaches Lou Iannotti and Hunter Mense have received rave reviews for overhauling pregame and in-game prep and taking a creative approach to scoring. The Jays put the ball in play more than anyone in baseball (they entered Wednesday with an MLB-best 17.1 percent strikeout rate), and the trio of hitting coaches emphasize each player\u2019s strengths.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cBe who you are,\u201d is one of Popkins\u2019 popular phrases, which has resulted in Myles Straw bunting, contact master Ernie Clement tapping out 112 hits in his first 112 games and George Springer being on track to have his best offensive season since joining Toronto before the 2021 season. The Jays were a good contact team last year (20.3 percent K-rate), but they\u2019re better this year, with improved power and a deeper, more multi-faceted lineup. The Jays have scored the sixth-most runs in baseball (556) this year with an MLB-best .267 batting average. They could be the first team to finish a season with a sub-18 percent strikeout rate since the 2017 Houston Astros.\nThe Jays have won thanks to multi-homer games by Springer (who is rehabbing from a concussion). They\u2019ve also won with small ball. In keeping strikeouts low and the ball in play, there\u2019s constant pressure on opposing teams. \u201cKnow what club to take out of the bag,\u201d is another Pop\u2019ism, an ode to golf and a directive toward situational hitting. If a spot calls for a bunt, take out your putter. If it calls for a home run, get the driver. Players have bought into that approach, one made considerably easier on a team that uses its whole roster to mix and match and maximize every game.\n\u201cThat was the message from Day 1 of spring training,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cEveryone is going to be a part of this.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re not starting for the Jays, you\u2019re probably still playing. Toronto routinely uses 11 or 12 of its 13 position players in games, with 15 players who have at least 100 at-bats. The roster is built for flexibility. Nathan Lukes, Joey Loperfido and Straw can handle all three outfield spots, Addison Barger moves between third base and right field, Davis Schneider (no relation to John) bounces from left field to second base to designated hitter, and Clement can pretty much slot in anywhere on the dirt.\n\u201cHis glove is one of the best infielders I\u2019ve been around,\u201d marvels Jays starter Kevin Gausman.\nAdvertisement\nRegulars like Bo Bichette \u2014 who leads the team with 74 RBIs \u2014 call the Jays\u2019 part-time players the heartbeat of the team. Bichette, who homered twice in Monday\u2019s rout of the Rockies, has done his part too. He leads baseball with 143 hits, 10 more than the next closest player (Manny Machado) as of Wednesday. Bichette\u2019s renaissance after his career-worst season in 2024 has been one of the biggest storylines of the season. His pending free agency could be the biggest story of the team\u2019s offseason.\nOn the baserunning side, the Jays were abysmal in an 11-14 April that looked like 2024 all over again. The coaches challenged the players to improve. The Jays don\u2019t have the pure speed of a team like the Milwaukee Brewers, but they can \u2014 as assistant manager DeMarlo Hale points out \u2014 make smart decisions. And they started to. In June, the Jays were among the league\u2019s best baserunning teams and, according to Schneider, the top team on advancing on hits. Toronto has its own internal baserunning scoring system (they rank 20th on the season by Statcast) that has helped foster players\u2019 competitive spirit.\n\u201cWhen a guy scores from first on a double and they know what it means, they know what that does for your score,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cIt\u2019s cool, you know? And then it gets a little contagious.\u201d\nThe Jays take the season in two-week bites, called \u201cState of the Squad,\u201d where they look at what the team is doing well over the previous 14 days and what it can do to improve. Players and coaches alike have commended this year\u2019s group on the ability to live in the moment, good or bad. The last two weeks have been a mixed bag, with series wins against the Tigers and Rockies and losses to the Orioles and Royals, as well as some personnel upgrades. In need of pitching help, Toronto added relievers Seranthony Dom\u00ednguez and Louis Varland, starting pitcher Shane Bieber, first baseman Ty France and catching prospect Brandon Valenzuela at the deadline, losing three of their top five pitching prospects in return.\nBieber, who is rehabbing back from Tommy John surgery, has the highest upside of the additions, as the former AL Cy Young award winner could give the rotation a potential ace down the stretch if he can regain his past form. The Jays\u2019 current group features Gausman, Eric Lauer (who has been a revelation), Jos\u00e9 Berr\u00edos, Chris Bassitt and Max Scherzer, who has looked more like a future Hall of Famer in each of his last two outings.\nScherzer, who turned 41 last month, signed with the Jays because of their aggressiveness in wanting to win. Despite significant financial resources that put them in baseball\u2019s upper payroll tier, recent offseasons have often been defined by their failure to sign big free agents. Last winter, they missed on superstar Shohei Ohtani. This winter, the pursuits of Juan Soto, Corbin Burnes and Roki Sasaki were futile. Signing outfielder Anthony Santander (who has been injured since May) and Scherzer helped shift the narrative.\nSo did keeping Vladimir Guerrero, Jr. On April 9, the Jays agreed to a 14-year, $500 million extension with their homegrown slugger. It was one of the biggest moves in franchise history, and declared Toronto\u2019s intention to stay competitive for the foreseeable future. But trying to win and actually winning are two very different things. It\u2019s fair to wonder if Toronto\u2019s style of play is sustainable and if the Jays \u2014 the only team with an entire country behind them \u2014 can finally avenge their October woes, which include playoff losses in 2020, \u201822 and \u201823.\nAdvertisement\nThe Jays players believe this year\u2019s team can do it, with some spotlighting their fundamentals (they also rank eighth in defense runs saved) and others highlighting how low-strikeout lineups tend to fare well in the postseason. Almost everyone mentioned team chemistry as evidence that this season is more than a hot streak. There is something about this team, players and coaches believe. Gausman said they haven\u2019t had to force any team bonding. Guys want to be around each other, and the younger guys are so into the game\u2019s minutiae and improving on the margins that Gausman endearingly calls them baseball rats. Ask Schneider \u2014 at the helm since he was named interim manager in 2022 \u2014 what stands out about this group, and he mentions the same thing.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no jerks,\u201d said Scherzer, who balks at the question of whether the Jays can sustain their torrid pace. To him, it\u2019s not about the results. It\u2019s about the process, both in getting to October and playing your best baseball.\n\u201cGreat teams are a sum of their parts. \u2026 Here, everybody recognized their (past) mistakes in this whole organization,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201c(The front office) upstairs, coaches, players \u2014 everybody really wanted to fix everything, and they wanted a total overhaul of operations. It\u2019s tough to know how bad the past was. I just get to see what the changes are, and right now this is a well-functioning team in every facet.\u201d\n(Top photo of Lukes and Clement: Duane Burleson / Getty Images)"

      "text": "NEW YORK \u2014 Thousands of people at Citi Field, many wearing orange and blue, offered Gavin Williams a standing ovation when the Cleveland Guardians right-hander left Wednesday\u2019s game with two outs in the ninth inning.\nWilliams had fallen just shy of recording Cleveland\u2019s first no-hitter in 44 years when he allowed a solo home run to Juan Soto with one out in the ninth in an eventual 4-1 Guardians win. At a time of angst in the world of the New York Mets, the cheers were a sign of respect. Nearly every other scene at the ballpark was met with boos.\nAdvertisement\nThat\u2019s because the Mets never made an adjustment at the plate. It\u2019s not the first time this season that\u2019s happened. Just the worst example to date.\nAfter allowing Soto\u2019s home run, Williams stayed in the game for two more batters, leaving one out shy of a complete game. He finished his outing following a two-out walk to Brandon Nimmo. Williams threw 126 pitches in total, allowing four walks and registering six strikeouts. Reliever Hunter Gaddis recorded the final out to earn the save.\nWilliams befuddled New York\u2019s lineup with a consistent game plan. He fed left-handed batters a steady diet of high four-seam fastballs and low curveballs, usually out of the strike zone. To right-handed batters, Williams relied on sinkers inside. It all worked. Over \u2026 and over \u2026 and over again.\n\u201cAs a team, you gotta be able to recognize how they are attacking us,\u201d Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said, \u201cand we haven\u2019t been able to do that.\u201d\nSoto\u2019s home run was the Mets\u2019 first hit since the fourth inning of Tuesday night\u2019s game. The 13 consecutive innings without a hit tied the longest such streak in franchise history (the other instance was April 4, 2024, between two games of a doubleheader against the Detroit Tigers).\nThe Mets\u2019 offensive woes stretch beyond the last couple of days. New York (63-52) has lost eight of its past nine games, including four straight. Over the nine-game period, the Mets have averaged 3.8 runs per game. Since a malaise set in for the Mets on June 13, they\u2019ve produced just a .674 OPS (heading into Wednesday\u2019s game), third-worst in MLB during the stretch behind only the Pittsburgh Pirates (.655) and the Guardians (.665), who just swept them in a three-game series.\nFor the Mets, who boast a lineup containing the likes of Soto, Francisco Lindor, Pete Alonso and Nimmo, their struggles have puzzled them. Like all teams, the Mets hold a hitters\u2019 meeting every day. The Mets communicate during games and after at-bats. It is common to see players like Lindor pass along tidbits of information to whoever is in the on-deck circle. In the dugout, they go over scouting reports, offering reminders. It\u2019s not translating to results.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know,\u201d Soto said. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what is going on. But definitely, we have the talent and guys who are capable of doing damage here. One day, it\u2019s going to turn around.\u201d\nWhen asked how much of the inability to make adjustments falls on the coaching staff, including hitting coaches Jeremy Barnes and Eric Chavez, Mendoza directed the blame toward himself.\n\u201cIt falls on all of us,\u201d Mendoza said. \u201cIt falls on me, as the manager. But we are in this together. I\u2019m not going to point fingers here. I know \u2014 we know \u2014 that we got really good players. I\u2019m going to point (at) myself. I\u2019m the manager and I am responsible. I know how hard those guys are working, but it starts with me.\u201d\nIn the postgame news conference, Mendoza also said that \u201cgood hitting teams are able to make those adjustments,\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s where I think is the next step for us, being able to recognize that.\u201d\nBut a lack of adjustments isn\u2019t the Mets\u2019 only problem. They also lack conviction. At times, they\u2019re too passive. Before the game, Mendoza cited a tendency over the last week to take too many fastballs for called third strikes.\nOnce the game started, it was more of the same. Williams limited the Mets to just five hard-hit balls. Before Soto\u2019s home run, there were just two instances where the Mets appeared closest to recording a hit. Lindor led off the bottom of the first inning with a hard-hit comebacker carrying an exit velocity of 107.2 mph that knocked Williams\u2019 glove off. But the pitcher never lost composure, picked up the ball and made the throw to first base for an out. In the seventh inning, Mark Vientos hit a line drive to right field, but C.J. Kayfus made a diving catch.\nWilliams, who lowered his ERA to 3.17, was damn good. But he didn\u2019t appear to be invincible. He did a good job of mixing things up with his five pitches. At times, though, he hung curveballs and sweepers over the middle of the plate. The Mets either hit foul balls or stared at them.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cHe was really good today, using all of his pitches, but we also know we are better than that,\u201d Mendoza said. \u201cThey know we are better than that. We just couldn\u2019t make any adjustments. A lot of empty at-bats there. As good as he was, I feel like he gave us a few pitches to hit. We missed them.\u201d\nMore history: Soto\u2019s long ball ensured that Cleveland\u2019s no-hitter drought, the longest in the majors, continued. The franchise hasn\u2019t had one since Len Barker\u2019s perfect game on May 15, 1981. Nonetheless, Cleveland leaves New York on the upswing with seven wins in its last 10 games and only one game out of the final American League wild-card spot.\n(Photo: Al Bello / Getty Images)"

      "text": "On the day after the MLB trade deadline, Milwaukee Brewers manager Pat Murphy uncapped a pen and scribbled notes for himself.\nQuiet, he wrote. Less is more.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing the deadline all year,\u201d he said, and so opted against blustering into his clubhouse to cajole or commiserate with the team about the lack of major acquisitions. There was no need to call a meeting with a group that has become, improbably, the owners of the best record in baseball. Instead, he used the same pen to write out his lineup.\nAdvertisement\nAt the top of the order, he inked the name of the day\u2019s only active addition, Brandon Lockridge, a 28-year-old outfielder with a little more than 100 big-league plate appearances and one career home run. \u201cHe seems like our kind of player,\u201d Murphy said. What Murphy meant offered insight into how the Brewers view themselves as they chase yet another National League Central title: players who demonstrate skill with their glove, ability on the base paths, and a willingness to sublimate their ego to serve the greater good.\n\u201cYou have to be hyper-vigilant about who you are,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThe awareness of who you are and how you impact the game.\u201d\nWhen the Brewers host the New York Mets this weekend, it will be a rematch of one of last year\u2019s most riveting postseason faceoffs and a potential preview for this coming October. A return to the postseason was expected for the Mets, who spent $750 million on outfielder Juan Soto. It was far less of a given for Milwaukee, whose front office lobbied owner Mark Attanasio not to cut payroll.\nFor the Brewers, last October ended with the heartbreak wrought by Pete Alonso\u2019s home run off closer Devin Williams. The offseason was almost as dispiriting. The team traded Williams, a two-time All-Star, just as they traded away former National League Cy Young Award winner Corbin Burnes the year before. Shortstop Willy Adames departed in free agency. They watched from afar as the Chicago Cubs loaded up to chase them.\nYet here the Brewers are, back in first place, confounding skeptics and offering a blueprint for success on a shoestring budget. At this point in the season, outsiders tend to get dispatched to explain how the team \u2014 residents of baseball\u2019s smallest market, financed by a payroll in the sport\u2019s bottom third \u2014 are doing it again. The questions amuse those who have heard them before, having made the postseason in six of the past seven seasons.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cSame way we do it every year,\u201d said outfielder Christian Yelich, the team\u2019s longest-tenured position player and the only Brewer inked to a nine-figure contract. \u201cWe just find ways to win games.\u201d He added, \u201cWe have a standard, like, an identity of how we play. And everyone who comes in here slots into that.\u201d\nThe formula this season reflects the composition of the roster, a team with lackluster power but superlative fundamentals. Murphy and the coaching staff emphasize team-wide execution. No hitter feels burdened with carrying the lineup. The offense places the opponent in a nine-inning pressure cooker; no team has been more valuable on the bases, according to FanGraphs. The development staff has created a pipeline of pitchers who trust the organization\u2019s ability to guide them. The players operate without the pressure of the big-city microscope.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a weird storm of all these different things coming about,\u201d said pitcher Brandon Woodruff.\nAt the center of the storm is Murphy, the 66-year-old former college baseball coach who moved into the manager\u2019s office when Craig Counsell decamped for the Chicago Cubs before last season. Murphy applies the same principles of selflessness to his staff through a makeshift, ego-deflating exercise he calls \u201cthe check game,\u201d which is designed to prevent people from puffing themselves up.\nMurphy devised the system during eight seasons as Counsell\u2019s bench coach. He kept tallies on a whiteboard. When former bullpen coach Steve Karsay referred to his Yankees teammate Derek Jeter as \u201cJetes,\u201d that was a check. When Counsell brought his glove to the ballpark, that was a check. And then there was the time former hitting coach Andy Haines attempted to solicit insight from former president of baseball operations David Stearns, who left to run the Mets in 2023.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in the coaches\u2019 room,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cSo Haines goes to Stearns, \u2018David, I\u2019ve been wanting to know the answer to this, and I figured I\u2019d bring it right to the top.\u2019 And then Stearns goes, \u2018Well, what do you got, Andy?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Hold on a sec. That\u2019s a check, Stearnsy. So you\u2019re the top? Mark doesn\u2019t own this team?\u201d\nMurphy maintains the same rigor with the Ivory Tower, the name he has given for members of general manager Matt Arnold\u2019s front office. \u201cAn Ivory Tower check is when they come swooping in, like, \u2018Hey, why don\u2019t you \u2014\u2019 and give us a suggestion,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThat\u2019s a f\u2014ing check.\u201d\nSo if someone in the scouting department bragged about bird-dogging flame-thrower Jacob Misiorowski, that would be a check. If someone in the analytics department claimed credit for seeing a path to success in first baseman Andrew Vaughn\u2019s minor-league batted ball data, that would be a check. And if anyone crowed about the wisdom of trading a competitive-balance draft pick for starter Quinn Priester? Yep, that\u2019s a check.\nThe Brewers added all those players weeks before the deadline. The deal for Priester demonstrated the team\u2019s ability to utilize its market size to its advantage. The club received two compensatory draft picks last winter, one for losing Adames, who signed a seven-year, $182 million contract with the San Francisco Giants, and another as part of an initiative in the collective bargaining agreement to aid teams that draw the least revenue.\nIn April, Arnold bundled that second pick, which was No. 33 overall, along with two prospects to acquire Priester, a first-round pick in 2019 who had not made Boston\u2019s Opening Day roster.\n\u201cYou have a lot of guys in our clubhouse who have been overlooked for a long time,\u201d Arnold said.\nUpon arrival, Priester recalled, he received a series of specific but simple instructions. The team wanted him to focus on pounding his 94-mph sinker down and away to generate groundballs. He needed to learn to spot his 92-mph cutter for back-door strikes. A lack of control in the running game was not acceptable. The little things, he was told, count around here.\n\u201cThose little things keep the game simple, keep the game fun, keep the game loose,\u201d Priester said. \u201cAnd you realize you\u2019re only one simple play away from doing something great.\u201d\nPriester stabilized a starting rotation that has improved as the season progressed. Woodruff returned in July after missing last season following shoulder surgery. Freddy Peralta made his second All-Star team last month. He was joined at the Midsummer Classic by Misiorowski, a 6-foot-7 rookie taken in the second round of the 2022 draft who throws so hard his changeup clocks at 92 mph.\nAdvertisement\nThe team also possesses the depth to protect the group. When Misiorowski took a ball off his shin in late July, the team was able to put him on the injured list rather than risk him damaging his arm while compensating for the discomfort.\nThe Brewers also had a ready-made replacement when first baseman Rhys Hoskins injured his thumb last month. Milwaukee called up Vaughn, the No. 3 overall pick in the 2019 draft, whose career had sputtered with the Chicago White Sox. Vaughn was languishing in the minors in June when Brewers pitcher Aaron Civale, after being moved to the bullpen, asked to be traded. Soon after, Arnold exchanged Civale for Vaughn, who remained in Triple A until Hoskins went down.\n\u201cJust getting him in a different environment, with a different level of pressure, we thought would be a good change of scenery for him,\u201d Arnold said.\nWhen Vaughn received his promotion, the staff provided marching orders, just as they did for Priester. If he did not swing at strikes, he would not stick around. The message left little room for interpretation, which is one of Murphy\u2019s hallmarks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s professional baseball, at the end of the day,\u201d Yelich said. \u201cI think people lose sight of that sometimes. Like, wanting it to be like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re doing great and it\u2019s OK.\u2019 Sometimes, it\u2019s not OK. It\u2019s the big leagues. There\u2019s a league for other s\u2014, and it\u2019s not this one.\u201d\nVaughn responded to the ultimatum. In his first 20 games as a Brewer, he batted .371 with six home runs and a 1.118 OPS. He is far from the only new face thriving in the lineup. Outfielder Isaac Collins might win National League Rookie of the Year. Caleb Durbin, one of the players acquired from the New York Yankees in exchange for Williams, has emerged as a solid regular at third base.\nThe presence of Vaughn adds more power potential for a lineup that will need it in October. A recent hot streak from slugging catcher William Contreras also provides optimism. The franchise has not won a postseason series since 2018. Yelich believes this group could be different.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cOur culture here brings the best out of players,\u201d Yelich said. \u201cBecause you feel comfortable when you don\u2019t have to put the team on your back, all by yourself. Just compete your ass off and have fun. Just give it hell. That\u2019s all you can do.\u201d\nThe next few months will determine if a team stocked with their kind of player can win it all.\n(Illustration: Kelsea Petersen / The Athletic; Photos: Patrick McDermott / Getty Images, Matthew Grimes / Getty Images, Jess Rapfogel / Getty Images)"

      "text": "Deciding how good a player really is one of those enterprises that happens equally often in barrooms and front offices, with just the same amount of agreement by all involved. But when it comes to bullpens, it\u2019s even more difficult to pin down a player\u2019s true talent. Relievers give us the smallest bits of production by which we could judge them, and yet those looks come in moments that are incredibly important to the outcome of the game.\nAdvertisement\nFor example, ask Yankees fans right now, and you might not get the sense that their team\u2019s bullpen is any good. And yeah, going into Tuesday\u2019s games, Yankee relievers had an ERA over five and were the second-worst unit in baseball over the last seven days. Woof.\nThat can\u2019t really be the right way to figure this out, though.\n\u201cWhat have you done for me lately?\u201d is a fine question for a fan to ask, particularly when they are reacting to a poor run of play, but the Angels \u2018pen is not twice as good as the Yankees \u2018pen simply because they have been that good over the last seven days.\nLooking backwards has its limits, but let\u2019s at least acknowledge that some of these bullpens have changed a ton since the trade deadline, and that seven days is not enough data to determine which bullpens are the best. Here are three bullpens that are candidates for the best in baseball, with their five best relievers listed, and their full-season numbers. These \u2018pens stocked up at the deadline and they are loaded when you look at them this way.\nFirst, let\u2019s start with the Yankees.\n| Name | ERA | K% | BB% | Stuff+ | Location+ |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n5.44 | 29.9% | 10.3% | 114 | 98 | |\n2.89 | 26.5% | 7.1% | 97 | 97 | |\n2.66 | 32.5% | 6.0% | 107 | 108 | |\n3.12 | 25.1% | 12.3% | 105 | 100 | |\n2.66 | 13.1% | 6.6% | 122 | 97 | |\n3.33 | 25.1% | 8.6% | 109 | 101 |\nFour guys who were primary closers for their teams in the past calendar year, two of whom sit in the high-90s with their fastballs, and pretty much all of them have nasty stuff.\nOf course, their collective ERA would look a lot better if it wasn\u2019t dragged down by a 5 in the Devin Williams\u2019 column, so it\u2019s always worth wondering what\u2019s happened to the Yankees\u2019 big offseason acquisition. It\u2019s possible the answer is not much \u2014 his stuff, command and fastball velocities are all in-line with his norms, and those are generally predictive. But with a season this bad it\u2019s probably worth pointing out that he\u2019s throwing the changeup as slowly as he\u2019s ever thrown it, and with more drop than ever, and it\u2019s being hit harder than ever. Maybe throwing that thing harder is the answer.\nAdvertisement\nYou can look to David Bednar to see how a small problem can rob a full season from a reliever and yet not change their career trajectory too much. Bednar didn\u2019t have a great Yankees debut, but he\u2019s a big stuff pitcher who made a couple small adjustments to get his curveball command back. He can be a great closer for them, but he\u2019s given up more homers away from Pittsburgh so far in his career and if that becomes an issue, Camilo Doval has the kind of stuff that will stay in the ballpark (though he might give up more hits).\nTim Hill\u2019s peripherals don\u2019t scream sustainability, but he\u2019s so funky that he\u2019s kind of the Tyler Rogers of this crew. And Luke Weaver\u2019s stuff is down, but with a changeup like he has, he can get lefties out almost easier than righties.\nThis is a good bullpen, even if it does have some warts.\nNow, let\u2019s move cross-town to the Mets.\n| Name | ERA | K% | BB% | Stuff+ | Location+ |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n1.41 | 37.9% | 9.6% | 106 | 93 | |\n1.87 | 19.2% | 2.0% | 126 | 104 | |\n2.77 | 27.1% | 8.8% | 128 | 94 | |\n2.56 | 28.0% | 11.6% | 113 | 97 | |\n3.63 | 27.4% | 10.3% | 113 | 87 | |\n2.39 | 27.7% | 8.3% | 117 | 95 |\nThey had one of the best closers in the game and then they added one of the other best closers in the game in Ryan Helsley, and then they added the funkiest submariner in baseball in Tyler Rogers. According to the Stuff+ leaderboard, which looks at the physical characteristics of a pitch, they added two of the three best relievers in baseball at the deadline.\nIs there a weakness? Maybe. This group has a 95 Location+, meaning they have worse-than-average command, even among the reliever population. Edwin D\u00edaz can get a wild hair up his nose, Helsley has the odd struggle with the strike zone, and Gregory Soto has improved over the years, but still has a mediocre walk rate. But if a team takes too many pitches against the Mets, they might just bring in Rogers, who has the best walk rate among qualified relievers in baseball this year.\nThis a great \u2018pen with lots of different looks, which seems important come playoff time.\nThe Padres made arguably the biggest deadline splash in trading for Mason Miller. Let\u2019s now dive into their \u2018pen.\n| Name | ERA | K% | BB% | Stuff+ | Location+ |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n4.02 | 38.8% | 11.9% | 123 | 91 | |\n2.61 | 34.9% | 11.9% | 112 | 111 | |\n2.13 | 25.8% | 5.1% | 120 | 99 | |\n3.17 | 25.9% | 6.9% | 112 | 105 | |\n1.82 | 24.7% | 10.6% | 103 | 92 | |\n2.68 | 29.6% | 8.4% | 113 | 100 |\nThey took the No. 1 reliever in terms of 100+ mph fastballs and added him to a \u2018pen with the 10th-place guy, so you know this \u2018pen will do well by stuff metrics. They have the highest strikeout rate of these three bullpens, and the second-lowest walk rate, and strikeout-minus-walk rate is one of the best predictors of future pitching success.\nAdvertisement\nIs there anything wrong with Miller? While Williams with the Yankees has a seen a large downturn in strikeout rate, Miller is still striking out nearly 40 percent of the batters he sees, with more velocity this year than last though, and a better shape on his fastball. His inflated ERA compared to last year might carry a relatively simple explanation: ERA is not predictive, and he\u2019s doing everything else well, and if there\u2019s anything he can do to be better, it\u2019s to cut down on waste fastballs. He\u2019s nearly doubled his rate from last year, and those pitches are easy to take.\nWell, relatively easy to take. He still sits 101 mph. Add him to what might have been the best bullpen in baseball before the deadline, and you\u2019ve got your presumptive answer on the titular question.\nBut hold on. We\u2019re still looking backwards, to some degree \u2014 we are trying to look backwards at predictive numbers, but we are still looking backwards. The best way to sum up the true talent of a player is actually to look at their projections and look forward. After all, if we\u2019re asking how good a player is right now we are really asking how good he\u2019ll be the next time out. And projections weigh all the different stats we are looking at and try to make the best sense of them in terms of weighing the most predictive elements of their stat lines, so that\u2019s another reason to use them.\nUsing the OOPSY projections on FanGraphs that incorporate all the stats we\u2019ve seen above, and only for the top five relievers, so that we compare only the \u201cA\u201d bullpens, here are the best bullpens in baseball going forward, sorted by ERA.\nGotta love a good surprise result. The Mariners have elite relievers in Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz and Matt Brash, some underrated ones in Gabe Speier and Caleb Ferguson, but that\u2019s only part of why the end up ranked first by projected ERA. Of course some part of it is the park, as they play in the No. 1 pitchers\u2019 park in baseball, according to Statcast park factors.\nWins Above Replacement has its flaws, particularly for pitchers, but it does account for this sort of thing. So once you consider park factors and look at the projected WAR category, you\u2019re probably circling the Mets or Padres for the best bullpen in baseball despite this ranking by projected ERA. And fans in Philadelphia (1.3 projected WAR) and Houston (1.2) can enter the chat if they\u2019d like.\nBut all this is in the end is a fun way to waste time until the next game. Then we\u2019ll find out which bullpen really shuts them down, and which one melts down and loses the game. And then we can start arguing all over again.\n(Top photo: Sean M. Haffey / Getty Images)"

      "text": "BOSTON \u2014 Roman Anthony hurried through an otherwise empty clubhouse. A custom suit hung in his locker.\nThis wasn\u2019t a typical Wednesday for a franchise that\u2019s become well aware of the cost that comes with letting homegrown stars get away.\nNinety minutes before first pitch \u2013 when Anthony is usually just finishing up batting practice \u2013 he sat in that navy blue suit between Red Sox CEO Sam Kennedy and chief baseball officer Craig Breslow, the latest recipient of a long-term contract extension in Boston. Anthony signed an eight-year, $130 million deal, the largest for any player on the team with fewer than 150 at-bats. Laden with escalators, a league source said, the deal can reach a total value of $230.2 million.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWhen the offer came through, it was something that I wanted to move quick on,\u201d Anthony said with teammates, coaches, family, front office members and ownership, including team owner John Henry, packed into the press conference room. \u201cThere was no doubt that this is where I wanted to play baseball for a long time.\u201d\nThe Red Sox were cognizant of their botched negotiations with homegrown players. Not signing Mookie Betts to a long-term deal is something that will hang over the club for years to come. When the opportunity presented itself to secure Anthony at an unusual time in the season, they made it a priority.\n\u201cIn the past, when we haven\u2019t signed homegrown players, it\u2019s hurt,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t found a way to a deal. So thanks to the Bres for being so aggressive (on Anthony).\u201d\nAnthony, 21, has the potential to be the next homegrown franchise cornerstone.\nHe will earn $2 million next season and $29 million in his final year of the deal, with a $30 million team option in 2034, according to a source. He\u2019ll earn an extra $1 million this season if he finishes first or second in Rookie of the Year voting. The deal includes escalators for top-10 finishes in MVP voting, including $2 million if he wins. He\u2019ll earn an extra $200,000 for any year he\u2019s named an All-Star. Anthony would have become a free agent after 2031; now he\u2019s secured through at least 2033 and potentially 2034.\nThe Red Sox were the first to reach out to Anthony\u2019s camp shortly after the trade deadline, a league source noted. During a quiet period days after the trade deadline, Breslow saw a window to re-engage and jumped at it.\nAnthony\u2019s camp knew his value. The top prospect in baseball has hardly struggled at all since his debut on June 9. His camp knew Rookie of the Year was in play and that he held future All-Star and MVP potential. While the Red Sox had signed Kristian Campbell for six years, $60 million earlier this season and Ceddanne Rafaela for eight years, $50 million last year, Anthony\u2019s agents were adamant about a much larger deal.\nAdvertisement\nInitial contract talks in spring training were exploratory, according to a source, and did not come close to any real negotiations. This second round of talks became serious quickly and Anthony expressed a desire to remain in Boston.\n\u201cBack in the spring, I hadn\u2019t had any experience playing here yet,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what to expect yet. It was just more wanting to be here and getting a feel for the everyday lifestyle here\u2026when I got to experience it, even being just 150 at-bats in, I can tell this is where I want to be. There\u2019s no doubt.\u201d\nIn roughly 20 months leading the Red Sox, Breslow has made a priority of securing several players to long-term deals including Rafaela and Brayan Bello last season and Garrett Crochet and Campbell this year. But all of those deals came in spring training or right at the start of the season.\nTwo months after trading Rafael Devers, freeing up $254 million in salary, the Red Sox reinvested some of that money in Anthony. Though Breslow said the moves were \u201clargely independent,\u201d the signing came on the heels of a trade deadline in which the club didn\u2019t take on significant salary.\n\u201cI guess the beauty of the trade deadline is that it is a true, rigid deadline,\u201d Breslow said. \u201cOnce it passes, we can comfortably shift our priorities to other things. We wanted to kind of strike up these conversations immediately.\u201d\nBreslow described a number of \u201cspirited and passionate\u201d conversations he and the front office had with Anthony\u2019s group about the player\u2019s potential future earnings, particularly in regards to his current Rookie of the Year status. If Anthony won the award before signing the deal, he would have gained an extra year of service time, allowing him to reach free agency sooner. The Red Sox needed to add a similar provision to the deal.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI think it clearly didn\u2019t become this prohibitive element or factor, but it was something that both sides needed to get comfortable with in terms of how we were going to address it,\u201d Breslow said. \u201cIt\u2019s real. We can\u2019t ignore it. But at the same time, the overriding overarching themes here, where Roman wants to be a Red Sox deep into the future, and we want Roman to be a Red Sox deep into the future.\u201d\nOne close comparison that was likely used in negotiations is Arizona\u2019s Corbin Carroll. Carroll signed an eight-year, $111 million deal ahead of the 2023 season, before he went on to win NL Rookie of the Year. Carroll had compiled 1.4 fWAR in 32 games at the time he signed the deal; Anthony had a 1.6 fWAR in 46 games at time of his deal.\nLess than two months into his major-league career, Anthony hasn\u2019t felt overwhelmed. He isn\u2019t surprised with how he\u2019s performed, carrying a quiet confidence that\u2019s neither boastful nor cocky. He knows how good he is; the escalators give him a chance to prove it.\n\u201cFor me, it was a deal that was obviously more than enough for me and for my family and a place that I want to be,\u201d he said. \u201cThose escalators just give me a chance to continue to grind every day and help this team win and be the best version of myself that I can be each and every day.\u201d\nBreslow had high praise for Anthony\u2019s impact in a short amount of time on one of the more exciting Red Sox teams in the past few years.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s special. I think it\u2019s remarkable,\u201d he said of Anthony\u2019s impact on the team. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that there\u2019s a metric that we should look at uniquely and believe that it perfectly captures the impact that he\u2019s had.\n\u201cIf you look at the success that the team has enjoyed, that kind of lines up almost perfectly with his debut, then you start to see a clearer picture of the impact that he\u2019s had.\u201d\nNow Anthony has a chance to impact the club for the better part of the next decade.\n(Top photo of Roman Anthony: Brian Fluharty / Getty Images)"

      "text": "Welcome to this year\u2019s ranking of the top 100 prospects in baseball. I\u2019ve been compiling and writing such rankings for 18 years now, and those of you who\u2019ve read them before will find the format here similar to those from the recent past.\nMy farm reports covering at least 20 prospects in each team\u2019s system, plus notes on prospects who might appear in the majors this year or might be breakout prospects for the 2026 rankings, will appear the week of Feb. 3.\nAdvertisement\nFor the second year in a row, the most recent draft class is well-represented in the top 100; last year\u2019s list had 20 players from the 2023 draft class, and this year\u2019s list has 15, with more appearing on the \u201cprospects who just missed\u201d column that will run on Wednesday. The 2024 draft was not very good, but the minors right now \u2026 the minors are not good, my friends. It\u2019s just not very deep, and getting to 100 names I felt good about was as hard as it has ever been.\nSome of it is the increasing pace with which teams are calling up top prospects, as 12 of my top 20 prospects from last year\u2019s list have graduated, but the bigger cause, in my opinion, is the forced contraction of the minor leagues back in 2021, which has rushed more players to Low A before they were ready and generally shrunk the time teams are giving to prospects who need more development.\nEven guys who struggle in A-ball tend to move up because players are coming right behind them who need those at-bats or innings, and the result is more guys stalling out or regressing or just never taking the step forward that scouts and/or analysts expected. With continued rumors that MLB wants to cut yet another entire rung from the minors, this year\u2019s top 100 should be a stark warning that the league is trying its best to strangle the goose that lays the golden eggs.\nTo be eligible for this list, a player must still retain Rookie of the Year eligibility for 2025, and have no experience in NPB/KBO, as those are major leagues and calling, say, Roki Sasaki a \u201cprospect\u201d is pretty silly (not to mention it takes up the space I\u2019d rather use on an actual prospect).\nI also don\u2019t include the international free agents who just signed in January, since in nearly all cases those guys haven\u2019t been scouted by other teams in a year or more. I know of one such guy who was under a verbal agreement with the team that signed him before he turned 13. No one has an up-to-date scouting report on him. That\u2019s just not happening.\nAdvertisement\nI tend to favor upside in prospects more than certainty, but there is value in both. A player who is all ceiling and no floor isn\u2019t as valuable, in the trade market now or in considering his expected value in the long term, as one who has a somewhat lower ceiling but a much higher floor. I want players who might be stars. After that, I want players who might be above-average big leaguers \u2014 but I also try to keep in mind that many of these prospects won\u2019t reach their ceilings, and to consider what other scenarios exist for their futures.\nI use \u201cseasonal age\u201d for players, which is their age on July 1, 2025, the midpoint of the calendar. I use the 20-80 scale for tools (or 2-8 \u2014 same scale, different dialect), where 50 is average, 60 is plus, 40 is well below average, 80 is Pete Crow-Armstrong\u2019s defense, and 20 is Yasmani Grandal\u2019s foot speed. I try to discuss players\u2019 tools, their frames, their level of athleticism and other physical attributes, as well as their skills, their aptitude, and other mental or intellectual attributes as well.\nThis is comparable to how major-league teams evaluate players, although they will always have the advantage of access to more and better data than those of us on the outside can get. The least I can do is try to reflect how the industry thinks about players, and give you the most accurate possible picture of the prospects in these rankings through both the lens of my own evaluations and those of the people within the industry whom I most trust.\nWhen referring to starting pitchers, I acknowledge that that role is still evolving and we don\u2019t have 200-inning guys anymore, with a lot of \u201cfive-and-dive\u201d (throw five innings and hit the showers) or twice-through-the-order guys, but I will still talk about league-average starters and sometimes refer to back-end (fourth or fifth starters) or above-average (ace, No. 2, and some No. 3) starters. Bear in mind that there is a range around any projection or prediction for a player \u2014 if I say I think someone\u2019s a No. 4 starter, he might have a ceiling as a No. 3 or more, and the floor of a middle reliever or a bulk reliever, where the No. 4 starter projection is the most likely or median outcome I see.\nAnd now, on to the rankings \u2026\nRoman Anthony\nAnthony has shot through the minors, reaching Triple A in his second full pro season out of high school, thanks to one of the best swings in all of the minors and an extremely advanced approach for a hitter so young. A 2022 second-round pick, Anthony changed his setup that offseason, freeing up his hands to loosen his whole swing through contact while also getting his hips and legs more involved to help him hit the ball harder, and it paid off almost immediately. Since his early 2023 promotion to High A, he\u2019s hit .294/.405/.521 across three levels, finishing last season in Triple A with as many walks as strikeouts at that stop. His average exit velocity for Triple-A Worcester was 88 mph, although he did start to hit the ball on the ground more (52 percent) in that brief stint, not a major concern but something to watch as he gets so close to a promotion to the majors. He\u2019s very disciplined for his age, chasing just 20 percent of the time in Triple A, with a whiff rate under 9 percent, picking up spin very well even at a level when he was facing guys who\u2019d pitched in the majors. Anthony has mostly played center in the minors, but he\u2019s not very rangy and he\u2019s maybe an average runner, so he\u2019s much more likely to end up in a corner, supplanted in center by someone with plus range. He\u2019s got a chance to be a 30-homer, high-average, high-OBP guy in right field, maybe with plus defense there, which is a \u201cbest player in the league\u201d profile.\nSebastian Walcott\nWalcott started the year in High A as an 18-year-old, joining Ethan Salas as the only players that young to start 2024 anywhere above Low A, and he started very slowly, hitting just .196/.326/.315 through the end of May. From then on, he cooked, hitting .296/.351/.511 until a late-season promotion to Double A, so that on the whole he ended the year with an OBP 17 points above the Sally League average and a slugging percentage 78 points above it \u2014 all as the league\u2019s youngest regular. The Bahamian-born Walcott looks like a man among boys, as he\u2019s 6-foot-4 or 6-foot-5 and clearly more than his listed 190 pounds, with a wide frame that\u2019s going to let him pack on some upper body strength. He\u2019s an excellent athlete with above-average speed and gets very high marks for his feel for the game, including his ability to make in-game and in-season adjustments. He\u2019s got tremendous bat speed and already produces hard contact at a very high rate, so there\u2019s every reason to hope he can be a 30-homer guy with a high average even if his strikeout rate remains in the 24-25 percent range. Walcott is a shortstop now, and not bad there, but he\u2019s extremely likely to outgrow the position \u2014 he\u2019s going to be larger than Carlos Correa or Corey Seager, two bigger guys who defied expectations to remain at short. At worst, you\u2019ve got a right fielder who hits for average and power. He won\u2019t even turn 19 until the first week of March, so he has plenty of time to keep turning these immense physical gifts into baseball skills. I think he\u2019s underrated already, and he\u2019s my pick to be the No. 1 prospect a year from now.\nSamuel Basallo\nBasallo might be hopelessly blocked at the moment by Adley Rutschman, but he\u2019s the best catching prospect in baseball right now, having produced at every level up through Double A before his 20th birthday while showing enough tools and athleticism to project as an above-average defender. Signed for a $1.3 million bonus in January 2021, Basallo has a fantastic swing that\u2019s short to the ball but hard enough to produce plus power already, with more to come as he matures. He\u2019s shown excellent plate discipline so far, and has hit left-handed pitching extremely well throughout his career, avoiding the platoon concerns that bedevil so many left-handed hitting prospects. Even in a tough debut in Triple A, where he really struggled to adjust to changeups, he still topped 110 mph (off a lefty!) and averaged 91 mph across all balls he put into play. He\u2019s got at least a 70 arm and is athletic enough to become a 55 receiver and blocker, although right now he\u2019s succeeding more on his pure physical ability and needs more polish on the finer points of catching. Basallo will probably be ready for a big-league role by the end of 2025, which will present a big dilemma for the Orioles, as they\u2019re one of the only teams in baseball for whom he wouldn\u2019t be a huge upgrade behind the plate \u2014 and if Rutschman is \u201cjust\u201d a 3-4 WAR player, as he\u2019s been the last two years, I\u2019m not so sure that he\u2019s the better option.\nWalker Jenkins\nJenkins has earned comparisons to Larry Walker since he was a high school junior, which I always suspected was at least a little bit driven by his first name, but there are more similarities than that. Jenkins is also a tall, athletic, and very strong left-handed-hitting corner outfielder, and he\u2019s advanced quickly through the low minors when healthy by showing exceptional swing decisions \u2014 he seldom swings and misses (just 17.5 percent last year) and doesn\u2019t chase pitches out of the zone very often (24.6 percent), unusual for a hitter of his size and power potential. He has a fantastic left-handed swing that gets him to the ball quickly and puts the ball in the air more often than on the ground, while he\u2019s shown the ability to go the other way when pitchers try to attack him on the outer third. That feel to hit as a 19-year-old who\u2019s already reached Double A is part of what makes him so exciting as a prospect; he already can hit, and there\u2019s size and strength here for plus power as he continues to grow and develop. He\u2019s mostly played center in the minors, but I still think he\u2019s heading to right field between his size and just average speed so far. He also missed almost two months to start 2024 with a hamstring injury, so he hasn\u2019t played a full season yet. He should return to Double A to start 2025, and if he stays healthy, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all to see him get a call-up in September given how much hard contact he\u2019s already making as a teenager.\nColt Emerson\nIf Emerson had stayed healthy all year, he would have been close to the very top of this list, just based on how good he looked and how well he performed when he was able to take the field. The 22nd pick in 2023, Emerson went to Low A to start last year as an 18-year-old \u2014 his birthday is in late July \u2014 and hit .293/.440/.427 in 40 games, walking more than he struck out. The Mariners bumped him up to High A in early August, and he hit .225/.331/.317 in 29 games there \u2014 but still made plenty of contact \u2014 and then hit .370/.436/.537 as one of the youngest players in the Arizona Fall League. The bad news is that he played a total of 83 games between the regular season and the AFL, hitting the IL in April with an oblique strain, breaking a bone in his foot by fouling a ball off it in mid-May, and then leaving Arizona in early November after straining a hamstring. He\u2019s played about 80 percent of his pro innings at shortstop and has shown the range and instincts to stay there, even though he\u2019s just an average runner; if his propensity to get hurt continues as he matures, he may be better served moving to third or second, but he's so much more valuable at short that he\u2019ll probably stay there at least through the high minors. He has all of the ingredients to be a hitter for a high average and OBP, with a short path to the ball, excellent bat speed and a strong approach for his age. He might only lack the power to get to the upper echelons of MLB position players, but he also has an extra year (so to speak) to develop that when compared to other elite shortstop prospects.\nMax Clark\nClark was the third pick in the loaded 2023 draft, and while I know some Tigers fans gnashed their teeth when Wyatt Langford (taken fourth) reached the majors last spring, Clark is one of the very best prospects in the minors and still projects as a star, especially coming off a very strong 2024. Playing at just 19 the entire season, Clark hit .286/.386/.421 in the pitcher-friendly Florida State League, then hit .264/.344/.421 after a July promotion to High A, while stealing 29 bases in 33 attempts on the year. His pitch recognition and selection remain very strong \u2014 he whiffed just 8.1 percent of the time he swung in Low A, and chased just 22.6 percent of the time, per Statcast data from that level \u2014 and he topped out at 106 mph in exit velocity, but he hit the ball on the ground a ton, as he can get too firm on the front side and ends up on top of the ball too often. He\u2019s a true center fielder who was a 55 runner last year, down from 70 speed in high school, and showed just an average arm, all of which was also a bit down from high school, possibly just the result of a much longer season and more frequent play than he\u2019d experienced before as an amateur in Indiana. His floor is a regular in center with high on-base percentages and plus defense; his ceiling, if the Tigers help him regain some speed and get him to loosen up his front side to drive the ball more, is a 25-homer/40-steal on-base machine.\nDylan Crews\nCrews was the second pick in the 2023 draft and made his major-league debut about 13 months after signing, advancing quickly through the minors as expected but without the dominance that most people anticipated. Crews hit .274/.343/446 in Double A, in a good hitters\u2019 park in Harrisburg, and .265/.340/.455 at Triple-A Rochester. It was a solid performance, boosted by above-average defense in center field, but he\u2019s not just any prospect \u2014 he won the 2023 Golden Spikes award after starring at LSU and beating up on SEC pitching for three years. The good news is that his batted-ball data points to better results going forward, as he ran into some bad luck in the majors despite hitting the ball pretty hard in a small sample; his hard-hit rates in Triple A (43.3 percent) and the majors (44.7 percent) were both above the median, even though he was just 22 and young for both levels. He\u2019s closed off some of the trouble he had in 2023 with fastballs up in the zone, and missed just 10 percent of the fastballs he swung at in the majors. He hit lefties fine in his brief sample in the big leagues as well, struggling mostly against breaking stuff from righties, especially down and away. Even with the tepid performance in the high minors, he still shows the underlying characteristics of an above-average hitter in the big leagues, and that coupled with what is probably grade 55 defense in center \u2014 or plus if he moves to a corner at any point \u2014 would still make him at least a consistent 3-4 WAR player right now. I\u2019m still hopeful there\u2019s more upside here with the bat than he\u2019s demonstrated in his year-plus in pro ball.\nCarson Williams\nWilliams is the most enigmatic prospect in the minors to me: He does absolutely everything you\u2019d want a position-player prospect to do, except he strikes out way too often \u2014 he does all of those other things despite a 28.5 percent strikeout rate in Double A last year that should be, if not disqualifying, a major demerit on his scouting report. Williams is a plus defender at short with an easy plus arm. He has 70 speed and shows above-average to plus power, hitting 20 homers for the second year in a row. He doesn\u2019t chase pitches out of the zone much at all \u2014 his chase rate last year was 22 percent according to Synergy Sports, which puts him well below the overall MLB rate, but when he does chase, he nearly always whiffs, and he also misses pitches in the zone more than you\u2019d like. It\u2019s a decision issue rather than a mechanical one, but Williams performs so well in spite of the whiffs that changing his approach risks taking away some of the production as well. His 2024 season may also undersell his abilities, as he was hit on the hand by a pitch in June, missed just six days, and wasn\u2019t the same hitter afterward. He was hitting .294/.376/.552 with a 27.1 percent strikeout rate at the time of the injury, then hit .220/.324/.382 with a 29.4 percent strikeout rate after his return, which makes me suspect he was more hurt than he let on and just played through it. At worst, he\u2019s a shortstop with plus power, defense, and baserunning value who might just hit for a lower average because of the strikeouts. That\u2019s a 4-WAR player in a full season because of the value of the position, and I wouldn\u2019t rule out him getting beyond that with even tiny adjustments to his swing choices.\nKristian Campbell\nCampbell was my minor league player of the year for 2024 after he posted a .330/.439/.558 line across three levels, from High A through Triple A, in his first full year in pro ball. The Red Sox took him in the fourth round in 2023 as a redshirt freshman at Georgia Tech, betting on the makeup and the athleticism, and that good scouting work paid off as he not only hit at every level but did so while playing four positions \u2014 second, short, third, and center. He\u2019s a plus runner who\u2019s fast enough to play any of those spots, but his fringy arm probably limits him to second or center, with second his best position right now and in the long run as well. His swing has a little funk to it and he can get flat through contact, resulting in a 60 percent groundball rate in his brief time in Triple A, but he has an incredible eye at the plate and gets the bat to the ball consistently enough for hard contact. He does have some holes he\u2019ll have to work on, including four-seamers up and anything moving down and in under his hands or at his front hip, some of which may just be a function of his limited experience before getting to Triple A. He\u2019s also already gained 10-15 pounds of further muscle this winter, which could help with bat control and getting some more loft through contact. He could easily be a plus defender at second and at worst should post high OBPs with 20-30 steals and 50+ extra-base hits a year.\nJordan Lawlar\nThe 2024 season was a lost year for Lawlar, who tore a ligament in his right thumb in March, then hurt his left hamstring twice while on rehab assignments, limiting him to just 104 regular-season PA and keeping him out of the majors entirely after he debuted in 2023. He did go play for Licey in the Dominican Winter League and doubled his playing time for the calendar year, although he didn\u2019t hit as well there, leaving him probably no further along than he was this time last year. He\u2019s a really athletic shortstop who has shown he can make hard contact to hit for high averages, hitting more line drives to the gaps than balls into the seats, only getting to more power when he played in the hitters\u2019 havens of Amarillo and Reno in 2023. His swing is pretty short to the ball, with good follow-through that\u2019s on a lower plane for line drives, and his wrists are so strong that he\u2019s going to at least get to a high doubles total and probably still hit 15-20 homers at his peak. He didn\u2019t run much last year but has plus speed and good instincts on the bases, all of which could also help him if he ends up moving to center field in deference to a plus defender at shortstop. If left at the position, he could be a 50/55 defender, thanks to some strong work by Arizona\u2019s player development crew. I did note some concerns about him lunging out of his swing in 2023, but that\u2019s all on the back burner now as we wait to see the healthy version of him return this spring training. He's got a strong floor as an everyday guy, at short or center or maybe even second, but if he can stay healthy and push that power to more like 20 homers or 60+ extra-base hits, he\u2019d be more of an All-Star.\nJackson Jobe\nJobe is the best pitching prospect in the minors right now, although every candidate for that list has missed some time with injuries in the past two years, Jobe included, so buyer beware. He\u2019s got a four-pitch mix highlighted by a high-spin four-seamer that sits 94-98 when he\u2019s starting and an elite changeup, one of the best in the minors, that has tremendous late tumble, and that he can throw to both sides of the plate and uses against left- and right-handed batters. He\u2019s also got a sweeper-slider and a hard slider, both of which are more weapons against righties, although the sweeper is probably going to be the fourth pitch in his arsenal in the majors. He has cleaned up his delivery somewhat since 2023, so he should be better positioned to repeat it and throw both more strikes and better strikes going forward, as high walk rates have been one of the only negatives on his report to date \u2014 he walked 12.6 percent of batters he faced in Double A and Triple A last year, which is a giant gift to batters given how hard his stuff is to hit. He\u2019s also had a lot of non-arm injuries, missing the first half of 2023 with a lower back injury and two months of 2024 with a hamstring strain, so he\u2019s thrown just 252 2/3 total innings in three full pro seasons, including time in the AFL in 2023. That may point to a limited workload in 2025, especially since he\u2019s likely to spend most or all of it in the majors. It\u2019s No. 1 starter upside if he can go from 45 control to 55, which he certainly should given his athleticism and where the delivery stands now.\nAndrew Painter\nPainter was supposedly on the bubble to make the Phillies out of spring training in 2023, when he was still 19, but ended up with a UCL tear that required Tommy John surgery and wiped out that season and all of 2024 as well. He returned during the Arizona Fall League this offseason and threw 15 2/3 innings over six outings, still pumping 96-98 with good carry, showing a plus curveball and slider, with only the changeup lagging behind. He\u2019s built like a workhorse starter at 6-foot-7 and a listed weight of 215 that\u2019s probably out of date by 10-plus pounds, although the elbow tear and two lost years at least push his timetable to take 30 turns in a big-league rotation back a bit. He\u2019s probably going to demolish Triple-A hitters this year and end up in the majors in some kind of relief or swing role as the Phillies manage his innings and try to develop his changeup and his command, especially coming off a layoff where he\u2019s likely to still have some rust. The healthy version of Painter should be a 200-inning, No. 1 starter.\nAidan Miller\nMiller was the Phillies\u2019 2023 first-round pick, coming off a senior season at J.W. Mitchell High School north of Clearwater that ended for him in early March when he broke a hamate bone. Between the injury and the fact that he was 19 at the draft, he slid down some teams\u2019 draft boards, which was the Phillies\u2019 windfall when they selected him with the 27th pick, as he\u2019s quickly become their best position-player prospect. Last season, he ripped through Low-A Clearwater with a .275/.401/.483 line in 39 games where he topped out at 108 mph, then started slow in High A before taking off in his last month and a half there, ending up with a .258/.353/.444 line before a final-week promotion to Double A, all very impressive for a player in his first full year in the minors. He has exclusively played shortstop since he signed, and contrary to predraft reports, he\u2019s played it really well, to the point where no one seems to question whether he can stay at the position. He\u2019s got very good instincts and shows above-average range in both directions, with a plus arm, playing defense like he wants to make every play. I saw him right after the promotion to High A and noted an overly aggressive approach and tendency to get on top of the ball; within about two weeks, he\u2019d already adjusted and was seeing more pitches and driving the ball again. He\u2019s even a plus runner now who stole 23 bases in 28 attempts last year, likely adding even more value to his game. Miller has played just 122 games in pro ball, and won\u2019t turn 21 until June, so he\u2019s still got time on his side and I think more power to come. With Trea Turner\u2019s defense slipping \u2014 his Runs Above Average on defense hasn\u2019t been positive since 2021 \u2014 Miller might be the Phillies\u2019 future at shortstop, and sooner than you think.\nMatt Shaw\nShaw might be the Cubs\u2019 starting third baseman this April, and he\u2019s earned the shot after reaching Triple A in his first full pro season and hitting better as the season progressed. Shaw started 2024 in Double A, where he overcame some bad luck on balls in play to hit .279/.373/.468 with just a 17.5 percent strikeout rate, and then bumped up to Triple A and hit .298/.395/.534 with a 19.7 percent strikeout rate. He makes very consistent hard contact, averaging 89.3 mph in Triple A with a 90th percentile exit velocity of 106. He utilizes a very rotational and clean swing that tends to put the ball in the air. He\u2019s a shortstop by trade but has played second and third as well in the minors, a reflection of the Cubs\u2019 needs, with second base probably his best position and his third-base defense playable if not quite average yet. He\u2019s a 55 runner with excellent instincts and could probably handle center or left if needed. Shaw is one of the best bets to hit for a high average of any prospect in the minors, and should add another half-grade of power to get last year\u2019s 21 homers up into the 25-30 homer range in his best years. Depending on his position and how much he can improve his defense, he could be a 5-WAR player at his peak.\nJeferson Quero\nQuero was No. 12 on last winter\u2019s top 100, but had just one regular-season plate appearance in 2024 before he tore the labrum in his throwing shoulder, eventually undergoing surgery to repair it that ended his season. He\u2019s supposedly on track to be ready for spring training, so in theory he\u2019s still just as good of a prospect as he was a year ago, with his throwing probably the biggest question, although the loss of a year of at-bats also hurts just about any prospect this side of Chipper Jones. It was particularly a shame for Quero after he worked to improve his conditioning the prior year so he could hold up under a full year of catching duties. As a hitter, he shows a short swing with strong follow-through, hitting 16 homers in 90 games in 2023 and projecting to 20-plus homers in his peak years in the majors. He had shown a tendency to swing too hard, mitigating it so far because he has strong hands and wrists to control the bat through the zone. He\u2019ll have to shake off the rust from the layoff, and then can resume working on recognizing changeups from lefties and spin from righties, both of which were vulnerabilities for him in 2023. Assuming his arm is OK \u2014 it was probably a 70 on pure arm strength, so he has some wiggle room \u2014 and the surgery hasn\u2019t adversely affected his swing, he still projects as a star who\u2019s a plus defender and a very strong hitter for the position.\nDalton Rushing\nRushing bounced back from a concussion he suffered in 2023 that impacted his performance, putting together a superb 2024 season that has him banging on the door of Chavez Ravine, hitting .271/.385/.512 between Double A and Triple A with solid defense and improved performance against velocity. Rushing has shown excellent zone awareness since his debut, with a chase rate of just 21 percent across both levels last year, and his hard-hit rate in Triple A was 44 percent, comparable to Alec Bohm and Kyle Tucker in the big leagues. He can overstride a little and get off balance, especially given how hard he swings, but when it\u2019s all synced up his swing is geared to produce hard contact in that ideal zone of angles off the bat for power. He\u2019s a solid receiver who threw out 30 percent of runners last year, and might be underrated as a defender because he\u2019s such a good hitter (something baseball fans who were online in the 1990s might know as Nichols\u2019 Law of Catcher Defense \u2014 a catcher's defensive reputation is inversely proportional to their offensive abilities). The Dodgers just gave Will Smith a mammoth contract, but he\u2019s also been banged up quite a bit the last two years, so Rushing\u2019s imminent arrival in the majors might be right on time. If he\u2019s even a .340 OBP, 20-homer guy, which seems reasonable given his production and underlying data from 2024, that would make him one of the most valuable catchers in baseball.\nEthan Salas\nSalas was one of two 18-year-olds to start 2024 above Low A, along with Walcott. Salas\u2019 season was very good in context, but didn\u2019t quite live up to the hype or the scouting reports coming into the year. He hit .208/.288/.311 for High-A Fort Wayne, with just a 21 percent strikeout rate; his .256 BABIP does point to some bad luck, but his contact quality went backwards as well, and the easy power he showed in 2023 \u2014 or can show in BP \u2014 was absent in games most of the regular season. He was better in the Arizona Fall League, hitting as many homers there (4) in 23 games as he did in 111 games for Fort Wayne, which plays in a bad hitters' park. He\u2019s still a plus defender and earns praise for his work with pitchers and coaches, giving him a very high floor as a catcher who has shown great contact skills and at least shown plus power in BP. He won\u2019t turn 19 until June 1, so he has a ton of time to bring all of this together. However, at the very least there\u2019s a lot more skepticism about his probability to become a star among other scouts and execs than there was a year ago.\nCoby Mayo\nThe Orioles went under-slot with their top pick in the abbreviated 2020 draft so they could go over slot for two players in the fourth and fifth rounds, and Mayo, the fourth-rounder, has more than justified their approach, as he\u2019s already reached the majors at age 22 after hitting well at every stop in the minors. Mayo spent most of 2024 in Triple A, hitting .287/.364/.562 there with 22 homers in just 89 games around an IL stint (he broke a rib trying to catch a foul ball). His batted-ball data from that level was just as impressive \u2014 his exit velocity topped out at 114.9 mph, his 90th percentile EV was 107.2 mph, and his hard-hit rate was 41 percent, all of which would be above the major-league medians for those figures. His Barrel rate was over 12 percent, which would have ranked in the top 50 had he done it in the big leagues. He's 6-5 and does have long levers so his swing can get big, some of which is the natural tradeoff for the kind of power he displays, but may also point to a longer adjustment period in the majors as pitchers exploit that length. He hasn\u2019t swung and missed excessively in the minors, however, and he has made small adjustments to his approach and his mechanics as he\u2019s moved up, so there\u2019s every reason to think he\u2019ll do so in the majors. He\u2019s played third and first in pro ball and has made himself into a capable defender at the hot corner, but first base will always be the easiest option \u2014 or possibly right field, as he has plenty of arm and moves well enough for a corner outfield spot. His bat looks like it\u2019ll play anywhere, with 30-35 homer upside and a good enough plan at the plate to eventually get to league-average or better OBPs.\nBubba Chandler\nChandler was part of the Pirates\u2019 2021 draft class, where they took Henry Davis with the first pick and went well under slot so they could sign several other first-round talents to over-slot deals \u2014 with Chandler by far the best of the group to date. The former quarterback-shortstop-pitcher is now exclusively on the mound, and 2024 was a big step forward for him, as he moved through Double A to Triple A and cut his walk rate from 10.9 percent in 2023 to 8.6 percent across all of last year. Chandler has one of the best four-seamers in the minors, 94-99 with exceptional shape and life, giving it the illusion of rise, and hitters just can\u2019t do anything with it: Triple-A batters whiffed on it 27 percent of the time they swung, and when they did hit it they were more likely to go the other way because they couldn\u2019t pull it. He\u2019s mostly fastball-slider-changeup now, barely using the curveball, so he can focus on improving just one breaking ball. It\u2019ll probably always be his third-best pitch, but it was effective against righties last year, and his changeup is still a plus pitch for him that he can use against both sides. The Pirates let him work a little deeper into games in 2024 and he showed no loss of stuff, while this was the second year in a row that he pitched a full season, so he should be ready to step into the big-league rotation by midyear. He only became a full-time pitcher in 2023, so he may still have more growth ahead of him on the mound than the typical 22-year-old, and he\u2019s every bit the athlete you\u2019d expect from someone who was committed to Clemson for two sports. Even if the slider is never more than a fringe-average pitch, he looks like he\u2019ll at least be a No. 2 starter with the two elite weapons and the potential for above-average command as he matures.\nNoah Schultz\nSchultz has gone from barely pitching as a senior at Oswego East High School outside Chicago as he was dealing with mono to becoming the best left-handed pitching prospect in baseball just two years later. He\u2019d made only 16 appearances in the minors coming into 2024, having missed time the year before, but spent most of his season in Double A as a 20-year-old and dominated, striking out 32 percent of batters he faced and posting a 1.48 ERA. He\u2019s 6-9 and really uses the height to his advantage, coming at hitters from a low slot with good extension so that hitters make weak contact on his fastball even though it doesn\u2019t miss many bats. He\u2019ll sit 93-96 as a starter, with high spin rates but not a ton of life to it, a plus-plus slider as his out pitch, along with a high-spin curveball and perhaps too-firm changeup, although so far he\u2019s had no issues with platoon splits. He\u2019s going to earn comparisons to Chris Sale as another lanky low-slot lefty, but he\u2019s a different animal; he might never miss bats at the same rate, but will generate a lot of weak contact and keep the ball in the park instead. As long as he stays healthy \u2014 and that\u2019s not guaranteed, as the history of 6-9 or taller pitchers is pretty grim \u2014 he\u2019s going to have a long run of giving hitters nightmares as a top-end starter.\nEmmanuel Rodriguez\nRodriguez had a typical year for himself \u2014 he walked and struck out a lot, made very hard contact, and got hurt. In 47 games total across four levels, he hit .280/.459/.567 with a 24.4 percent walk rate and 29.7 percent strikeout rate, hitting nine homers in that span, or roughly a 31-homer pace. He injured his right thumb while stealing a base in April, tried to come back and play through it, but reinjured it in September and ended up having a \u201ccleanup procedure\u201d on it after the season. He makes extremely hard contact when he\u2019s healthy, though. Even in his brief time in Triple A, he put 13 balls in play, peaking at 114.6 mph and averaging 90.1. And his knowledge of the strike zone is real; he even brought his chase rate down from about 14 percent last year to 11 percent this year and just 8 percent in his brief time in Triple A. Rodriguez calmed down his leg kick a little bit last year, although it doesn\u2019t seem to have made much difference in his results, and he still probably needs to swing more often at pitches in the zone. If he stays in centerfield, with this power and patience he could be a better Mike Cameron (46.7 career WAR, so don\u2019t scoff). It\u2019s more likely Rodriguez ends up in right field, where his unusual profile as a hitter will still make him an above-average regular, and there\u2019s the potential for more if he gets a little more aggressive at the plate \u2014 and can stay on the field for a full season.\nJasson Dom\u00ednguez\nDom\u00ednguez may never quite be the Mickey Mantle-esque star that the earliest hype around him indicated, but he\u2019s going to be a very good player \u2014 more so if the Yankees just leave him in center field and let him hit. Signed for a $5 million bonus as a 16-year-old in 2019, Dom\u00ednguez was very physically mature for his age then, and showed plus power early on in his career as a result. He\u2019s also a 70 runner and has 30/30 upside if he hits enough to get to it, and so far, he has hit for contact and average up through Triple A, hitting .287/.363/.465 there last year in his return from 2023 Tommy John surgery. He\u2019s a switch-hitter with really good swings from both sides of the plate, but has always been better from the left side and has struck out 29.3 percent of the time when batting right-handed over the last two years, one thing that bears watching as he moves to the majors. He\u2019s a natural center fielder and a good one, with range from that plus speed along with solid instincts to read balls off the bat. There\u2019s some hit tool risk, especially against southpaws, and he doesn\u2019t have the same room for physical projection that most prospects his age still do. I see enough present strength and power \u2014 his EV50 in Triple A was 101.6 mph, which would have ranked fourth on the Yankees last year \u2014 to project him as a 25-30 homer guy as is, and with the speed and defense that still makes him a well above-average regular and occasional All-Star.\nKevin McGonigle\nMcGonigle was the Tigers\u2019 second pick in 2023, but took home a first-round bonus to buy him away from a scholarship to Auburn, and his pro debut made that look like a screaming bargain for Detroit. (It helps that the current draft bonus system wildly undervalues the best players.) His 2024 was bookended by injuries, but after recovering from a hamstring strain, he hit .326/.407/.470 in his 60-game stint in Low A, then got off to a solid start in High A before he broke the hamate bone in his right hand, ending his season. The middle infielder from a small private school outside of Philadelphia has a very clean, simple swing with good hip rotation to drive the ball to the gaps, and the excellent ball-strike recognition he showed as an amateur has certainly carried over \u2014 he walked more than he struck out at Low A and at High A, with 11 walks and just four strikeouts in 14 games at the latter stop. He\u2019s played short and second in pro ball but doesn\u2019t have the range or quickness for shortstop, profiling much better at second and perhaps ending up a 55 defender there. If there\u2019s a knock on his game, it\u2019s that he\u2019s not as projectable physically as most of the guys ahead of him on this list; he makes plenty of hard contact now, but there\u2019s not much room on his 5-10-ish frame to get stronger, so any further power gains (he had five homers in 74 games, although the Florida State League is bad for power hitters) will have to come from swing tweaks. He\u2019s probably going to have a very long career as an above-average regular who ranks among the league leaders in OBP with just average or fringy power and solid defense at second \u2026 and, if he hits what I\u2019d arbitrarily call a 95th percentile outcome, retire with 2,500 hits.\nFelnin Celesten\nCelesten might be a superstar, if he can stay on the field and make the most of his prodigious physical abilities. Signed in January 2023 for a $4.2 million bonus, Celesten missed all of the 2023 complex season with a hamstring strain, then went to the Arizona Complex League (skipping the DSL) to start 2024 and hit .352/.431/.568, which put him in the top 10 in the league in average and slugging among all players with at least 100 PA. He missed a month with wrist pain, returned for one game in late July, and then shut it down, eventually undergoing surgery to repair a broken hamate bone. The team said it was an old injury, so he did all that at the plate while playing through an injury that typically saps a ton of power from a hitter. He\u2019s a true switch-hitter with plus speed, an above-average to plus arm, and good actions at shortstop, lagging behind in some of the less tangible aspects like his internal clock and getting better reads off the bat. If he has the work ethic to match his tools, he\u2019s going to be a superstar.\nTravis Bazzana\nBazzana was the first pick in the 2024 draft out of Oregon State, where the Australian infielder had starred for three seasons as the Beavers\u2019 second baseman, finishing with a .407/.568/.911 line as a junior. Cleveland sent him right to High A, where he struggled a little out of the gate, enduring a five-game hitless stretch in his second week there before warming up for his last month-plus at the level and ending with a .238/.369/.396 line in his pro debut. He\u2019s a very polished WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) player, offering little in the way of physical projection but also earning plaudits everywhere for his acumen for the game, leading evaluators to believe he will be able to make adjustments as he faces better pitching. He has an odd start to his swing with the bat back behind his rear shoulder and pointing down, but he\u2019s ready when it matters and has a short path to the ball once his hands get started. He showed incredible plate discipline in college and most of that carried over into the minors, as he still didn\u2019t chase much (22 percent) and only struggled against sliders in that brief stint, particularly left on left. Bazzana is limited to second base or possibly left field. Cleveland\u2019s trade of Andr\u00e9s Gim\u00e9nez clears the keystone for him, and there\u2019s every reason to expect him to see the majors some time this year given his advanced approach and present power/strength. Even if he\u2019s just average on defense, his propensity to hit for high averages and get on base with probably 20ish-homer upside should still make him an All-Star.\nJosue De Paula\nDe Paula is one of the best pure offensive prospects in the minors right now, with an incredible approach at the plate that resulted in a .268/.404/.405 line between Low A and High A with 84 walks (good for 14th in all of the minors) and just 95 strikeouts. He makes hard contact right now, with strong exit velocities that you might not infer from his power output (just 10 homers, 17 doubles, three triples), as he doesn\u2019t get the ball in the air as often as you\u2019d like just yet. He\u2019s a 40 runner and isn\u2019t a great defender anywhere, so the hope is he ends up a 45 defender in an outfield corner, while the fear is he ends up at first base or at DH. The bat will play anywhere, especially if his power emerges with age and more muscle on his 6-3 frame, particularly in his wrists and forearms, allowing him to control the bat head better through contact to hit the ball on a line. I\u2019m betting on that happening given his age, physique, and exceptional command of the strike zone.\nDrake Baldwin\nBaldwin is such a good defender behind the plate that he\u2019s almost certainly going to be someone\u2019s everyday catcher, and if his raw power keeps showing up in games as it did after a midseason promotion to Triple A, he\u2019s going to make some All-Star teams. He was Atlanta\u2019s third-round pick in 2022 out of Missouri State, where he wasn\u2019t a full-time player until his draft year, and he\u2019s improved substantially as a hitter since entering pro ball, loosening up at the plate to try to get to more of that plus power. He had a slow start in Double A but Atlanta promoted him to Gwinnett in early June, after which he took off, hitting .298/.407/.484 at the higher level with 12 homers in 72 games. He hits the ball extremely hard \u2014 his average exit velocity in Triple A was 92 mph, his EV50 was 103, and his 90th percentile EV was 107 \u2014 so there\u2019s every reason to think the power is real. He whistles the bat through the zone with excellent bat speed, and even with a pretty high starting position he hasn\u2019t had trouble getting to pitches at the bottom of the strike zone so far. He\u2019s an outstanding blocker and receiver with plus arm strength but just fringy accuracy so far, leading to a career 20 percent caught stealing rate in the minors. A 20-homer catcher with plus defense will rank among the best backstops in the majors, and Baldwin looks like he can be at least that, and probably will debut this year.\nMarcelo Mayer\nMayer looked like he was on track to be the top prospect in baseball around midyear, but he got hurt yet again, with his last game in 2024 coming on July 30, further underscoring his history of missing time with injuries. He was in the midst of a bounce-back season at the plate, returning to Double A and hitting .307/.370/.480 there while cutting his strikeout rate from 26 percent to just under 20 percent, when the injury struck, although he was promoted on paper to Triple A after he hit the injured list. Mayer has a very pretty left-handed swing with good loft in his finish, projecting to plus power down the road, probably 25-30 homers a year. He\u2019s a strong athlete and has the arm and hands to be a plus defender, flashing that range at times but needing to be more consistent on routine plays. He murders fastballs, with the bat speed to catch up to top-end velocity, while offspeed stuff gave him more trouble than ever in 2024. It may be mechanical, as he\u2019s locking his front knee very early and trying to hit with a completely firm front side, leaving him vulnerable to stuff down at or below his knees; if that\u2019s the issue, it\u2019s also fixable, and he hasn\u2019t always hit this way. More concerning is that Mayer has yet to play in 100 games in a pro season, topping out at 91 in 2022, missing time due to a lumbar strain (2024), shoulder inflammation (2023), a sprained wrist (2022), and \u201cback issues\u201d (2022). He\u2019s 22 now and still has superstar potential \u2014 a 30-homer shortstop with plus defense and what should be above-average OBPs is going to be the best player on his team in most cases. He has to show he can play 140 games in a year and get back to hitting offspeed stuff to be that kind of prospect again.\nBryce Eldridge\nEldridge played as much as any prospect in 2024, with 565 total plate appearances across four levels of the minors and a stint in the Arizona Fall League, where he was understandably gassed. He performed well at the first three stops as a 19-year-old in his first full pro season. He was a two-way player in high school who had arm strength as a pitcher but no breaking ball to speak of, so while the Giants sort of said he\u2019d continue to pitch when they drafted him, everyone wised up and told him to go hit. He\u2019s 6-7 but has a short swing for someone that size, one that\u2019s far more geared towards contact than the kind of big-fly, loft-oriented swing you might expect from such a tall hitter, and he kept his strikeout rate to just 25 percent until he got to Triple A, which is always the biggest concern with any hitter his height (or taller). He looks like he\u2019ll be a huge power hitter, but while he makes hard contact, I\u2019m expecting higher averages and doubles totals but a more modest home run output in the 20-25 homer range. He has played some right field but it\u2019s apparently an Eldridge horror show out there, so first base it will be. He still has work to do there, but there\u2019s really nothing stopping him from becoming at least a 55 defender at the position, and he does give fielders a big target for their throws. The Giants pushed him very hard last year, so 2025 should be a consolidation year for him, where perhaps he starts in Double A and gets a long run there before moving up to the hitter-friendly PCL. He\u2019s their next franchise player, but needs time to be ready to deal with major-league pitching, especially as he had more trouble with offspeed stuff as he moved up the ladder last year.\nBrandon Sproat\nThe Mets wanted Sproat so badly, they drafted him twice. He decided not to sign in 2022, choosing instead to return to Florida to try to improve his draft stock, and he did, going a round higher in 2023 and probably making another $500,000 in the process. He reached Triple A in his first full pro season, dominating High-A and Double-A hitters with a five-pitch mix. He had a 2.05 ERA on the season and 110 Ks with 31 walks in 87 2/3 innings when he was promoted to Triple-A Syracuse. He struggled in seven starts there, allowing 36 hits, including seven homers, in just 28 innings, as his fringy command came back to bite him, with too many fastballs left about belt-high and more experienced hitters better able to pick up some of his offspeed stuff. He works heavily off a four-seamer that\u2019s been up to 99-100 and sits 96-97, while his best pitch is a slider that\u2019s above-average to plus depending on the day; he\u2019ll throw a decent change, a curve, and a two-seamer as well. It\u2019ll always be control over command, as he\u2019s so aggressive that it\u2019s hard to foresee him ever toning it down enough to be precise with his locations. He\u2019ll have to do a little bit of refinement to make the last leap to the majors, as hitters will hit your stuff, no matter how good it is, if you put it on a tee for them. He has some similarities to Edwin Jackson, a huge stuff guy who was more of a No. 4 starter for most of his career, although I think Sproat has better control than Jackson did at the same age.\nLeodalis De Vries\nDe Vries signed last January for $4.2 million, the second-biggest bonus in the 2024 international free agent class, and the Padres were unusually aggressive with him \u2014 who am I kidding, they always do this \u2014 in sending him not to the DSL, not to the Arizona League, but to Low A, making him the only 17-year-old regular anywhere in full-season ball last year. He more than held his own, hitting .237/.361/.441 with a very respectable 23.3 percent strikeout rate that was slightly better than the Cal League average. He has a real knack for centering the ball and as he gets stronger his batting average is going to climb very quickly, since he already has the contact skills. He knows the strike zone extremely well for someone so young, and he rarely misses fastballs; he had more trouble with other pitch types, unsurprising given his complete lack of prior experience anywhere in pro ball, but didn\u2019t panic with two strikes and only swung and missed slightly more often in those spots. His regular season ended in mid-August when he strained his right shoulder on a diving play, but in a sign that the injury wasn\u2019t too serious, the Padres sent him to the Arizona Fall League, where he was, of course, the youngest player. He turned 18 in October, so he\u2019s younger than some high school players who\u2019ll be drafted on Day 1 this upcoming July. De Vries was already showing signs of adjustments when he got hurt, cutting his whiff and chase rates on various pitch types in the second half, and he has barely begun to grow into his 6-2 (actual height) frame. He\u2019s got a chance to stick at shortstop, he\u2019s a plus runner, and he might end up with 20+ homer power. Give him a full, healthy year along with the benefit of all the experience he got in 2024 and he might be a top 10 prospect by next January.\nJJ Wetherholt\nWetherholt might have gone No. 1 in last year\u2019s draft had he had a full, healthy spring for West Virginia, but a hamstring injury limited him to 36 games for the Mountaineers, just 27 of them in the field, so he ended up going No. 7 to the Cardinals \u2014 and that looks like a steal for St. Louis. Wetherholt had one of the best swings in the draft class and a long track record of hitting for average and high contact rates, hitting .449/.517/.787 as a sophomore and then .331/.472/.589 despite clearly playing hurt for some of his junior year. He\u2019s not very physical, but makes plenty of hard contact \u2014 his hard-hit rate in Low A after the draft was 55 percent, exactly the same as his hard-hit rate from the spring, and he topped out at 109 mph in Palm Beach \u2014 thanks to a short, efficient swing that gets the most from his lower half (when his lower half is intact). He moved to shortstop from second and third as a junior, but of course never played it at full strength after the first weekend, so while the safe bet is that he ends up at second base, he hasn\u2019t had a chance to show much at shortstop yet. Regardless of his position, his swing mechanics and his approach at the plate point to high averages and a lot of doubles power, enough to make him a long-time regular who might challenge for some batting titles.\nKevin Alcantara\n\u201cThe Jaguar\u201d made his big-league debut in September, just over three years after the Cubs acquired him from the Yankees for Anthony Rizzo in a trade that worked out well for both clubs. Alc\u00e1ntara started slowly in 2024 and hit the injured list in early June with an injury to his left shoulder, but after he returned, he took off at the plate, hitting .292/.388/.459 between Double A and Triple A in 63 games before the callup. He\u2019s 6-6 and lanky, with a ton of room to keep filling out and adding power beyond what he already shows \u2014 nearly half of his balls in play in Triple A were hard-hit (95 mph or better exit velocities) \u2014 while he's still developing the wrist and forearm strength to stay on plane through contact and get the ball in the air more, with a 51.7 percent groundball rate in the minors last year. Alc\u00e1ntara has worked his way up to become a plus defender in center as he\u2019s improved his focus and his reads on balls off the bat. He\u2019s not ready for the majors yet, between the tendency to get on top of the ball and some real trouble with sliders once he reached Triple A (he whiffed at just over half of the ones he swung at there), but with his plus defense and speed and the 30-40 homer potential, he has the most upside of anyone in the Cubs system.\nCharlie Condon\nCondon was the No. 1 player on my predraft rankings last year and went to Colorado with the third pick, but his post-draft performance couldn\u2019t have differed more from what he did in the spring for Georgia. Condon won the Golden Spikes Award with a .433/.556/1.009 line for the Dawgs, hitting 37 homers in 60 games, setting the school\u2019s career home run record and the NCAA\u2019s single-season record since they switched to BBCOR bats. In 109 PA for High-A Spokane, however, Condon hit .180/.248/.270, struck out 34 times (31.1 percent), and walked just four times. Pitchers saw a 6-6 hitter with long levers in the box and went after him hard in with fastballs and soft away with sliders and changeups. Condon is an impressive athlete who made extremely hard contact as an amateur, ranking among the leaders in Division 1 with a 90th percentile exit velo of 111.8 mph, and he did adjust in the spring when pitchers went after him with breaking stuff, forcing them to come back to the fastballs on which he feasted. He\u2019s played third base and all over the outfield, playing passably at the hot corner and in center, but the broad consensus is that he\u2019s going to end up in right given his frame and likely eventual size. He did have a lingering hand injury when he first signed that may have affected him at the plate, but that can\u2019t explain away all of the struggles. Perhaps he was pressing; perhaps he just hadn\u2019t seen breaking stuff of that quality before; perhaps it\u2019s just a tiny sample. I don\u2019t think his ceiling has changed at all \u2014 he\u2019s a 30-homer bat with the kind of contact quality that leads to high BABIPs and averages, and he should be a plus defender in an outfield corner \u2014 but there\u2019s more uncertainty here than there was on draft day.\nNick Kurtz\nKurtz was the best hitter in a loaded Wake Forest lineup last spring, leading the team formerly known as the Oakland A\u2019s to take him with the No. 4 pick, after which he continued to rake in his pro debut. He hit .368/.520/763 in 50 PA between High A and Double A, hurt his hamstring, then hit .353/.450/.608 in 60 more PA in the Arizona Fall League. He\u2019s limited to first base \u2014 the horror \u2014 so he needs to hit, but so far he\u2019s hit everywhere, and it\u2019s especially promising that he\u2019s been swinging the bat more since he signed, as he walked a ton in college (78 times last spring) and could look passive at the plate. He\u2019s up from swinging 33 percent of the time in college to 38 percent in the minors, and that\u2019ll probably increase a little more as pitchers realize just how good his ball/strike recognition is. When he does swing, he makes extremely hard contact; his 90th percentile exit velocity at Wake Forest was over 111 mph, and he continued to hit the ball hard in his brief time in the minors. There\u2019s a good chance for 30-homer power with 70-80 walks or more per season, and that\u2019s going to make him a star and possibly the best player in the Sacra \u2026 er, the Athletics lineup.\nDemetrio Crisantes\nArizona took Crisantes in the seventh round in 2022 out of Nogales (Ariz.) High School, just a few minutes from the U.S.-Mexico border, but the infielder didn\u2019t debut until 2023 or play a game in the field until 2024 after he underwent two Tommy John surgeries \u2014 the second to repair the first \u2014 as a high schooler. Through 121 games in the minors, however, he\u2019s hit .342/.427/.486 with a really mature approach and enough hard contact to project him to a 60 or better hit tool in the majors. It\u2019s a really simple, clean swing with a little loft in its finish, producing a 27.4 percent line-drive rate in 2024, and he\u2019s strong enough already for well above-average contact quality for a teenager. (The MLB average line-drive rate in 2024 was 19.6 percent.) His defense is a work in progress between his recovering arm and several years off the field; he probably fits best at second base, as he\u2019s athletic enough for the position and it doesn\u2019t require a ton from his arm, while he lacks the range for short or the twitchiness for third. There\u2019s always a lot of risk in prospects whose value is primarily tied up in their hit tool \u2014 not to be too obvious, but if they don\u2019t hit for high averages, they have nothing to fall back on \u2014 which is why Crisantes isn\u2019t even higher on this list. Everything about Crisantes, from the swing to the batted-ball data to the performance, says he\u2019s going to hit a ton.\nKyle Teel\nTeel was part of the four-player package that Boston sent to the White Sox for lefty Garrett Crochet, and right now he seems like the best bet to be Chicago\u2019s primary catcher this year after he finished 2024 in Triple A. The Red Sox 2023 first-round pick out of Virginia, Teel started his first full pro season in Double A, hit .299/.390/.462, then moved up to Triple A with Kristian Campbell and hit .255/.374/.343 in 28 games at that last stop. He\u2019s an excellent athlete who moves very well behind the plate and has a plus arm, with solid-average speed that\u2019s more evident underway than out of the box. He's got quick hands at the plate and a short path to the ball with a little loft in his finish, way more likely to hit for average than for power given his good-not-great contact quality and the way his swing works. He has had some trouble with lefties in pro ball, striking out 31 percent of the time he\u2019s faced them in only about 130 PA, and he\u2019ll need more reps against southpaws to avoid becoming a platoon player. His glove is ready, and his bat is at least ready enough to make contact against righties. The White Sox have the luxury of time to let him continue to develop in the majors and hope he reaches his upside of a solid-average or better regular behind the plate.\nBraden Montgomery\nMontgomery was No. 4 on my predraft board last year, but slipped to the No. 12 pick after he broke his ankle in Texas A&M\u2019s Super Regional series in June. The Red Sox drafted him, although that will become a point of trivia since he never played a single game for Boston before they traded him this offseason to the White Sox in the Garrett Crochet deal, giving Chicago two of the top six players from my 2024 draft board along with their own first-round pick, lefty Hagen Smith. Montgomery is a switch-hitter with power both ways, hitting much, much better from the left side, making consistently hard contact \u2014 his hard-hit rate last spring for Texas A&M was a nice 69 percent, putting him in the top 1 percent of all Division 1 hitters. He was a two-way player through his sophomore year at Stanford before he transferred to College Station, so of course he has a plus-plus arm and is at least a 55 defender in right. The two big questions around Montgomery are whether the ankle injury will affect him at all going forward and whether he should give up hitting right-handed, as he struck out 29 percent of the time that way last spring with just a .227/.395/.485 line (versus .355/.465/.819 left-handed). It\u2019s 30-homer upside with strong defense and the hard contact to keep his batting average above the median as long as he comes back at 100 percent.\nTink Hence\nHence would be one of the absolute best pitching prospects in baseball if he showed he could stay on the mound for a full season of work, but the 2020 draftee has yet to reach 100 innings in any one season \u2014 just pitching extremely well when he is on the mound. He\u2019s small, listed at 6-1, 195, but very, very athletic, and his arm is electric. He\u2019ll touch 98 and sit 94-95 as a starter with a 70 changeup and a slider that\u2019s at least average and plays up because it\u2019s a different look and shape than the other two pitches. He\u2019s never had a serious arm injury, missing most of 2021 with shoulder discomfort that never required surgery, losing about a month of 2024 with some kind of strain or pull in his side. He did go 90+ pitches in several starts for the first time last year, and posted his best strikeout rate (34.1 percent) and ERA (2.71) of any stint he\u2019s had in full-season ball. He might be a guy who pitches like a No. 1 or a No. 2 but only does so on the workload of a swingman or a back-end starter, although I never like to underestimate a player who\u2019s this athletic.\nChase Burns\nBurns was the No. 2 pick in the 2024 draft and the first pitcher taken, coming off a dominant spring at Wake Forest that saw him strike out more than 40 percent of opposing batters. His fastball has been up to 100 and sits 96-98 with big induced vertical break, and his slider is a 70 with late, tight break along both axes. College hitters couldn\u2019t touch the slider, whiffing two-thirds of the time they tried (so the lesson is never try). He has a 55 curveball and a straight changeup with some tumble to it that is his weakest pitch, probably his main area for work going forward now that he\u2019s in pro ball. He has some effort to his delivery, including a slight head-snap, but so far he hasn\u2019t had any trouble throwing strikes or locating his main two pitches. If his command and control hold up, he\u2019s a potential No. 2 starter, and could follow another former Wake Forest pitcher, Rhett Lowder, in reaching the majors inside of 15 months of his draft day.\nJustin Crawford\nCrawford held serve last year, continuing to hit the ball hard and get on base at a high clip (.360 overall between High A and Double A), but also continuing to put the ball on the ground 60 percent of the time because his swing has him coming down at the top of the ball. He\u2019s a 70 defender in centerfield and an 80 runner who swiped 42 bags in 51 attempts last year and probably could steal 60 without breaking a sweat. He overstrides at the plate, so he\u2019s frequently off-balance, and doesn\u2019t load his hands at all from a high setup, resulting in a bat path that often has him coming down towards the zone. Some of this is a matter of strength, as Crawford was all projection when the Phillies drafted him in the first round in 2022, and he still has a lot of physical growth ahead of him, but some is mechanical and it\u2019s time for him to make some real adjustments to get in better position to drive the ball. He\u2019s going to have plus raw power, and that combined with elite defense and speed will make him an impact player for a long time if he can change his swing to get that raw power into games.\nFranklin Arias\nArias destroyed the Florida Complex League last season as an 18-year-old, hitting .355/.471/.584 to win MVP honors and earn a bump up to Low A, where he more than held his own with a .257/.331/.378 line and just a 17.4 percent strikeout rate. He\u2019s got tools and athleticism to spare, showing excellent bat speed and wrist strength already, along with a fantastic swing that has great rhythm to it and lets him get his lower half involved for more power. He\u2019s a true shortstop with soft hands and solid instincts already, showing a plus arm and above-average speed on both sides of the ball. Arias just turned 19 in November and probably gets to High A at some point this year, given how good his contact skills are already. He has the upside of a plus defender at short with above-average OBPs and 20 homers a year, with the only major risk just his age and the distance he has to travel to get to the majors.\nCam Smith\nSmith was a draft-eligible sophomore last year who reworked his swing and his body to surge to a .387/.488/.654 line in his sophomore year at Florida State, raising his average by over 100 points, and landing with the Cubs at the No. 13 pick. He then had the best pro debut of any prospect in the draft, hitting .313/.396/.609 across three levels and finishing up in Double A. That ended his Cubs career, as they traded him to Houston in the Kyle Tucker deal this offseason, immediately making him the Astros\u2019 No. 1 prospect. Smith\u2019s swing gets the bat to the zone quickly, and he makes a lot of very hard contact, topping out over 115 mph in the spring for Florida State, and the Cubs already managed to get him to lift the ball more often to turn that loud contact into more power. He\u2019s only played third base since signing and that\u2019s his best long-term outcome; that seemed like wishful thinking as recently as 2023, but his improved conditioning gives him a chance to stay there, with first base or right field also possibilities. He looks like he can flat-out hit, and might get to 25 homers too. If he does that as a third baseman, he might be able to fill Alex Bregman\u2019s shoes in Houston and make a few All-Star teams.\nCooper Pratt\nThe Brewers went over slot in the sixth round in 2023 to sign Pratt, who was 40th on my draft board (so an early second round talent), and his first full season was a rousing success. Pratt played at least 55 defense at short, with some scouts saying it\u2019s already plus, and he showed a way better approach at the plate than just about any high school hitter from Mississippi I can remember. He hit .295/.394/.395 in Low A last year, with a 12.2 percent walk rate and just an 18.3 percent strikeout rate in a league where the overall strikeout rate was 25.3 percent. He moved up to High-A Wisconsin for the playoff run and had a harder time \u2026 except that he launched five homers in 23 games there, more than he had hit in 73 games in Low A. There\u2019s power in there, maybe 15-20 homers a year, although even if he\u2019s more in the 10-12 category, plus defense and really strong on-base skills will make him a solid or better regular at shortstop. If his power output does keep improving as he gets a little older and stronger, he\u2019s got a chance to be a 4-5 win player.\nCole Young\nYoung had another very solid year at the plate while being young for his level, hitting .271/.369/.390 as a 20-year-old in Double A, all comfortably above the averages for the Texas League (.240/.327/.374), even though he was the fourth-youngest regular at the level. He\u2019s always been an advanced hitter for his age with exceptional feel for contact; data from Synergy Sports show him with a whiff rate of just 19 percent last year, and nothing over 22 percent on any of the big four pitch types. His swing is handsy and doesn\u2019t generate much power, although he does make hard enough contact to keep his average up, and gets the ball in the air enough to maybe see him as a 40-doubles, 10-homer guy in the majors. He can play shortstop but probably will end up superseded by a plus defender, while he\u2019s played extremely well at second and might be a plus defender himself at that spot. He\u2019s a no-doubt big leaguer, with the floor of a very good platoon infielder who can play multiple spots but maybe sits against good lefties, and a strong probability that he\u2019s at least a solid-average regular at one of the two middle infield positions.\nMoises Ballesteros\nBallesteros is one of the best pure hitters in the minors, and if you really believe he can catch, he\u2019s a top 20ish prospect \u2014 but his body is less than ideal for the position and he\u2019s probably going to end up somewhere else. Ballesteros played all of 2024 at age 20 and hit well at three stops, .299/.372/.495 in Double A, .281/.340/.454 in Triple A, and then .317/.376/.557 in 19 games in the Arizona Fall League. He doesn\u2019t miss pitches in the zone, although to be fair, his strike zone isn\u2019t very big, but does get overly aggressive with two strikes and expands the zone significantly. He may always just be a \u201cswing first, ask questions later\u201d hitter, since he can make contact with so many pitches, and he\u2019s got grade-55 power already. He\u2019s heavy, even after losing some weight (and keeping it off) in the last year, and that\u2019s going to make it hard for him to handle everyday catching duties, as he\u2019s not very agile behind the plate, and his just-average arm doesn\u2019t help matters. He could be an occasional backstop who mostly handles first base and/or DH, gaining a lot of value from the games he does catch and from what should be consistently high batting averages with 15-20 homers a year.\nThayron Liranzo\nDetroit picked up Liranzo along with Trey Sweeney in the trade that sent Jack Flaherty to the Dodgers, only to go on an improbable run to the playoffs after the deadline, which seems like a win-win to me. Liranzo started the year slowly for High-A Great Lakes, and was hitting .220/.344/.356 at the time of the deal, but then somewhat inexplicably took off with the change of scenery \u2014 he hit .315/.470/.562 in 26 games for the Tigers\u2019 affiliate in West Michigan, then went to the AFL and hit .375/.492/.667 in 15 more games, walking more than he struck out at both spots. He\u2019s pretty mobile behind the plate and has a 70 arm, needing to work more on receiving to remain a full-time catcher. His bat is special \u2014 he\u2019s got a quiet, easy swing that still produces plus raw power because he\u2019s so strong to begin with, and his ball/strike recognition is excellent already. He had no trouble adjusting to offspeed stuff in the AFL, in contrast to much of the regular season where he ran into some difficulty with sliders and changeups. He was on the younger side for High A at age 20 and probably should spend all of this year in Double A to work on his catching and keep tightening up that pitch recognition. It\u2019s 25-homer, .350+ OBP upside in a switch-hitter, and if he\u2019s even a 45 catcher, he\u2019ll be a 4-5 win player in his peak years.\nRhett Lowder\nLowder reached the majors just over a year after the Reds took him with the No. 7 pick out of Wake Forest, showing three pitches with a ton of movement albeit a little less velocity than he had shown in college. His best pitch as an amateur was his changeup, which is hard to pick up out of his hand and has both fading and tumbling action to it, but it was actually less effective at generating whiffs than his 92-95 mph four-seamer or his high-spin slider in his six big-league starts, even just against lefties. All three of his pitches should be above-average, with the run helping the fastball play up and sharp downward break to the slider, so it was surprising that he gave up so much contact, with a 41 percent hard-hit rate, in his debut. Even with that high contact rate, Lowder was very lucky in the majors, with a 1.17 ERA but a 3.10 FIP, and even that latter figure doesn\u2019t adjust for the improbability of allowing 0 homers in 30 innings. He\u2019s major-league ready and probably a league-average starter given his current velocity and what looks like 55 control and maybe 45 command, with of course the chance to get beyond that if he starts working less in the heart of the zone with his fastballs. (You may not give a damn, but he\u2019s the first player named Rhett in big-league history.)\nHagen Smith\nThe top lefty in the 2024 draft class, Smith got better every year at Arkansas, culminating in a year where he struck out 17 batters in his second outing against an Oregon State lineup that featured eventual No. 1 pick Travis Bazzana. Smith worked at 92-97 with a plus slider and gets some added deception from a funky delivery and a starting position on the extreme first-base side of the rubber, although that latter point makes it harder for him to locate his fastball or changeup to his glove side (which would be inside to righties). He takes a huge stride towards the plate and generates a ton of arm speed, coming from a slot below three-quarters which, given who drafted him, brings the name \u201cChris Sale\u201d to mind. He had Tommy John surgery in high school, missing his senior year, but has been healthy ever since and saw his velocity and results creep up each year. He\u2019s a potential No. 2 starter, although I\u2019d like to see him move a little more towards the middle of the rubber so he can work more effectively to both sides of the zone.\nNick Yorke\nBoston shocked everyone in 2020 when they took Yorke, a high school second baseman who had to move off shortstop after shoulder surgery, in the first round, but his first full pro season in 2021 appeared to vindicate them when he hit .325/.412/.516 at both A-ball levels. His follow-up in 2022 was marred by multiple injuries, including a nagging left wrist issue that interrupted his stint in the Arizona Fall League, and his 2023 fell somewhere in between, so it seemed like he\u2019d settled in as a future regular but one without much upside. He did nothing after returning to Double A to start 2024, but from the moment Boston promoted him to Triple A, he turned into Rogers Hornsby, hitting .333/.420/.498 even through a trade to the Pirates for Quinn Priester. Those numbers came with tons of hard contact: He peaked at 111 mph, half his balls in play were hard hit (95 mph+), and the average velocity of that upper half (his EV50) was 101.9 mph, all of which were comfortably above the MLB medians. His swing is very simple and direct; it doesn\u2019t have a ton of loft, so he\u2019s probably not going to be a big power guy (barring a swing change), and instead should run high BABIPs and averages, maybe challenging for the league lead in doubles. He\u2019s a solid-average defender at second and his throwing has improved enough that he\u2019s not going to have any trouble staying there, although the left side of the infield is probably out of the question. My evaluations of Yorke have been all over the place since he was drafted, so take this with even more grains of salt than usual, but I\u2019m buying Yorke now as a future 55, an above-average regular who\u2019ll have some years when he's an All-Star because he hits for such a high batting average.\nKumar Rocker\nRocker\u2019s road to the majors was \u2026 uh, rocky? Sorry, I\u2019ll work on that. He was the No. 10 pick in 2021, but the Mets didn\u2019t like something in his post-draft physical, so he went to indy ball and pitched well enough to go No. 3 to Texas in 2022, but blew out his elbow six starts into his pro debut the next year. He returned in 2024 and the Rangers kept moving him up as he kept posting, eventually getting him three starts in the majors in September where he looked as good as he had since his freshman year at Vanderbilt. He had lowered his arm slot back in 2022, but it\u2019s back to its original position, which allows him to get more depth on his slider. The slider is easily plus and might be a 70 once again, and keeps him on top of his 94-97 mph four-seamer. His path from here is largely about him \u2014 he has succeeded in the past by out-stuffing guys, and being very aggressive with those two main pitches (he has a curve and changeup, but uses them less), but in the big leagues he\u2019s going to have to show better command to get ahead of hitters and to avoid a lot of four-inning, 85-pitch starts. This is a bet that he\u2019ll make those adjustments and end up at least a mid-rotation starter, perhaps someone who pitches at a higher level than that but needs to skip some starts here and there to keep him healthy.\nRiver Ryan\nRyan\u2019s 2024 season featured his big-league debut, so yay, but it was bookended by two injuries, the latter of which probably will keep him out until 2026 as he underwent Tommy John surgery in August. He started the year on the shelf with a sore shoulder, but did reach the majors for four starts where he showed electric stuff, sitting 96-98 with ride on the four-seamer and both the slider and cutter flashing 55 or better. The cutter was new for him in 2024 and gives him another weapon for lefties, as it looks just like his four-seamer but has a little last-second break downward to fool hitters, although in the majors he leaned on the changeup more than the cutter. He\u2019s a converted infielder who\u2019s very athletic on the mound and has already made incredible progress in command and control and has shown the ability to make adjustments from one year to the next. The injury and the lost time do hurt his overall outlook. He's a No. 2 starter if he comes back at 100 percent and can hold up for a full season.\nEdgar Quero\nQuero came to the White Sox in the 2023 deadline deal that sent Lucas Giolito (briefly) to the Angels. He reached Triple A last year in his first full year in Chicago, hitting well at two levels with very strong OBPs. He\u2019s an advanced hitter for his age, which balances out some of the lack of projection in his body, as he\u2019s not likely to get that much stronger and further improvements will have to come from tweaks to his mechanics or swing decisions. He\u2019s a switch hitter who\u2019s definitely better from the right side, with large platoon splits the last two years \u2014 in that span, he hit .342/.440/.510 against lefties, and .242/.351/.370 against righties. His biggest area of improvement last year was using his strong ball/strike recognition to swing more \u2014 he swung at 39 percent of pitches he saw in 2023, then upped that to 47 percent last year, and, lo and behold, he hit better across the board, including boosting his slugging percentage against right-handed pitchers by 111 points. He hit 16 homers last year, but doesn\u2019t project to produce much if any more power than that; he\u2019s more likely to be a high-doubles guy with strong on-base skills. Quero remains a solid-average defender with an average arm, still working on some of the finer points of the position but also a no-doubt catcher whose bat looks like it\u2019ll make him a regular there. He may be better off in some kind of soft platoon role, depending on how much of the improvement against righties was real, but there\u2019s still everyday ceiling here.\nAngel Genao\nGenao had a disappointing year in 2023 in Low A, hitting .263/.345/.385 in 72 games after missing the first two months with a torn meniscus, but he went back to Low A to start 2024 and hit all year long \u2014 .341/.383/.553 repeating Low A, then .322/.377/.463 after a June promotion to High A. He\u2019s grown substantially since he was first measured at his \u201cofficial\u201d height and weight of 5-9, 150, gaining significant strength but also getting to the point where he might end up outgrowing shortstop. He\u2019s a switch-hitter who\u2019s better from the left side but capable enough from the right side to keep it up, actually hitting with more power right-handed in each of the last two years. He\u2019s an average runner and not terribly twitchy, with second or third base more likely than shortstop, but his bat should still make him an above-average regular at either spot.\nQuinn Mathews\nMathews was a senior sign out of Stanford in 2023 who succeeded with a plus changeup and above-average command but worked at 90-92 when going once a week. He gained a ton of velocity last offseason, however, working 92-97 on the four-seamer, with a slider that\u2019s more effective now in the mid-80s despite low spin rates and soft break. The result was that he raced from A-ball through four levels and led all minor-league pitchers with 202 strikeouts, only running into some trouble when he got to Triple A. His arm speed on the changeup is just like it is on the fastball, but the pitch comes out 10 mph or more slower and has some tumble as well, flummoxing hitters who think it\u2019s coming in at 94, and the funk in his delivery further adds to the deception of the pitch. That said, I don\u2019t love the delivery; there\u2019s a lot of effort behind the funkiness, and he takes a modest stride with some head-snap at release. He was badly overworked as a college senior, especially in the postseason, and then saw his velocity jump up very rapidly inside of a year, which seems in my experience to often precede elbow injuries (this is based on anecdotal evidence, to be clear). He\u2019s clearly passed most of the Cardinals\u2019 other pitching prospects and is probably the best guy called up for a rotation spot in the majors if there\u2019s an injury \u2014 or if they move one of their veterans in a trade before Opening Day.\nTyler Black\nI wish the Brewers would just give Black the first-base job and call it a day; he should outperform Rhys Hoskins\u2019 2024 line quite handily after hitting .258/.375/429 in Triple A last year. Black is extremely disciplined at the plate and already has a reputation for fighting for every strike; his chase rate is good at 20 percent (just in Triple A), not exceptional, but he connected with those in some way more half of the time, either fouling them off or putting them in play. He rarely whiffs and has shown he can hit lefties up through the top levels of the minors. He doesn\u2019t throw well enough for the left side of the infield after shoulder surgery, although he runs well enough to maybe play center and certainly could play second if the Brewers didn\u2019t already have Brice Turang there. He\u2019s a very capable first baseman, if an untraditional one, with average power and his real strength in getting on base. Black would be more valuable at another spot, which is why he\u2019s in this place in the rankings, but for his current team he\u2019s also their best internal option at a less-valuable position he can play.\nThomas White\nWhite was the Marlins\u2019 second pick in the 2023 draft, a huge high school lefty out of Massachusetts who had big stuff but questions around his long arm swing and present command. He turned a lot of that on its head in spring training last year, showing up in incredible shape and with a clear determination to get better any way he could, and ended up pitching better after a midyear promotion to High A. White topped out at 97.6 mph in the Florida State League last year and sat 94-96 with his high-spin four-seamer, getting good ride at the top of the zone, along with an easily plus changeup and a slider that looked about average but played exceptionally well even at a relatively low velocity for the pitch (mostly 78-82). His delivery is pretty easy, perhaps still lacking deception \u2014 a concern scouts raised when he was an amateur \u2014 but it didn\u2019t affect him anywhere in A-ball and I wouldn\u2019t change anything right now. If he gets more power to the slider, which at least has above-average spin rates to work with, he could easily have three plus pitches, with a 200-inning starter\u2019s build and what now looks like at least average command. White did a great job preparing himself for the season last winter and the Marlins might have a future ace.\nZyhir Hope\nHope was part of the four-player trade that sent Michael Busch and Yency Almonte to the Cubs, bringing Hope and Jackson Ferris to the Dodgers, a deal that got the Cubs their best season from a first baseman since 2019, but that has also given the Dodgers two of their top six prospects. Hope seemed like a longshot when the Cubs took him in the 11th round in 2023 out of a small high school in central Virginia; he was a tremendous athlete with plus speed but no history of hitting even decent pitching and poor instincts in the outfield. Fast forward a year and he\u2019s become a much, much better hitter in every way, improving his pitch selection and recognition, getting stronger (to the point where he probably doesn\u2019t have a lot of physical projection left), and becoming at least an average defender in an outfield corner. He doesn\u2019t chase pitches out of the zone and he really doesn\u2019t miss anything inside, regardless of pitch types. He is more vulnerable to velocity up and/or away and pitchers are going to try to attack him there or down with offspeed stuff, but he\u2019s made so many adjustments already it seems reasonable to bet he\u2019ll adjust again as needed. He\u2019s every bit of a 70 runner and shows plus power already, and you can project 30/30 on him pretty easily if he continues to hit and control the zone as he moves up the ladder. He did have some more trouble with better pitching in the AFL, and the move up to High A and a worse hitter\u2019s environment this year will tell us more about just how advanced he is and how much time he might need to get to the majors. Hope\u2019s upside is enormous, with a wide variance in potential outcomes.\nJosue Briceno\nBrice\u00f1o signed with the Tigers in January 2022 for $800,000 as a catcher with some offensive potential, but at this point it looks like he\u2019s just going to be a first baseman who mashes. He had played only 11 games above the complex leagues coming into 2024, then got hurt 28 games into the Florida State League season, missing three months with a strained PCL in his right knee. To make up for some of that lost time, he went to the Arizona Fall League, where he was one of the youngest players at 19 and one of a very small number of players there who hadn\u2019t played above Low A yet. In 25 games, he hit absolutely everything. It\u2019s a hitter\u2019s environment out in the desert, sure, but his .433/.509/.867 line was good enough to lead the league in average and slugging. He\u2019s a big guy, listed at 6-4, 200, and probably stronger than that, but his swing is very easy and quiet, and he\u2019s reached 109 mph in each of his two stints in Low A already, with an EV50 just over 100 mph. He also showed strong pitch recognition in the Florida State League and in Arizona, and rarely swung and missed; if there\u2019s a knock on his offense, it\u2019s that he\u2019s a little too pull-heavy now, although he\u2019s also hardly had the need to try to do anything else. He only played first base in Arizona with Thayron Liranzo there, and Brice\u00f1o was already iffy as a catcher even before the knee injury. I think his future is at first, and it might behoove the Tigers to just put him there now and let him go rake rather than slow his development or risk further injury at a position he\u2019s already unlikely to play. He might be a top 20 prospect in a year from his bat alone.\nJac Caglianone\nCaglianone was a two-way star at Florida, hitting 35 homers as a junior while also making 16 starts, although his future is much brighter as a hitter than on the mound. He has 80 raw power and did work to cut his strikeout rate from his sophomore year (18.1 percent) to his junior year (8.2 percent), missing less often on pitches in the zone. He still chases pitches out of the zone way too often, doing so nearly 40 percent of the time last spring, and needs to develop more of a two-strike approach and work on going the other way on pitches outside, as he\u2019s very pull-heavy. As a pitcher, has been up to 99 and shows at least an average changeup, but it\u2019s a cross-body delivery with a lot of effort to it, resulting in well below average control (15.4 percent walk rate in two years for the Gators), and he\u2019s already had one Tommy John surgery in high school. The Royals have said so far that they intend to let him hit and pitch, which probably means he\u2019s going to stay at first base to protect his arm; I\u2019d love to see him just focus on hitting, given the 40-homer upside and the need for some big adjustments, which might also let him handle right field.\nJett Williams\nWilliams had a breakout year in 2023, but he started to feel pain in his right wrist during an awful start in April last season and eventually had surgery that kept him out for exactly four months, limiting him to 30 total games including his rehab assignment. He didn\u2019t hit well anywhere except for the one six-game series he spent in Triple A, still drawing plenty of walks but without any impact when he did make contact \u2014 which could easily be a result of the wrist injury. He went to the Fall League to pick up some more at-bats, and was a 45 defender at short there and running closer to average than plus, and might be better suited to second base regardless of the presence of Francisco Lindor at shortstop in Queens. It\u2019s a compact swing combined with very good ball/strike awareness, and he could be a high-average/high-OBP second baseman with 55-60 defense, which would make him a solid or better regular. His 2024 season was just a lost year, and while he can\u2019t get those at-bats back, it\u2019s also possible that we\u2019ll have to just disregard what he did do when he played because he wasn\u2019t 100 percent.\nLuke Keaschall\nKeaschall was the Twins\u2019 second-round pick in 2023 out of Arizona State and finished his first full pro season in Double A, hitting well at two levels with very high contact rates and some surprising power. Keaschall has always shown good awareness of the strike zone and that carried over into pro ball, with a chase rate under 20 percent on the season, and excellent pitch recognition to go along with it. He\u2019d had issues with fastballs up in college, but he\u2019s looser at the plate now and gets to those pitches more often. He\u2019s also staying back longer before transferring his weight to his front side, allowing him to get more power from his lower half and helping him swat 15 homers in 102 games last year. He\u2019s close to a 60 runner and should end up a 55 or better defender at second, just lacking the arm to move to short or third, and range-wise he looks more than capable of handling centerfield. He played with a torn UCL last year and ended up undergoing Tommy John surgery in August, so we\u2019ll have to see what his arm strength looks like on his return. He\u2019s a very likely regular as long as he can still handle the throws from second base, and his bat might even profile if he has to move to left in the worst case scenario.\nCaden Dana\nDana did not belong in the big leagues last season, and his 9.58 ERA in three starts shouldn\u2019t be held against him. He had a wildly successful year as a 20-year-old in Double A with just 76 innings of previous pro experience. He posted a 2.52 ERA in the minors, striking out 27.2 percent of batters and walking just 7.2 percent, making 23 starts for Rocket City and then the three more for the Angels to make for about as full a season of work as you\u2019ll find for a 20-year-old pitching prospect. Dana mostly works with a 92-95 mph fastball and an above-average slider, with an occasional changeup that has good deception and a little tumble, and a curveball that\u2019s not bad but that he barely uses. He\u2019ll have to use the changeup more to continue to keep lefties in check, as he did in Double A, but otherwise he has a good pitch mix and his delivery should get him to at least above-average command. He\u2019s got a solid floor as a No. 4 starter and is young enough to keep refining his pitches and his overall pitching plan and get to a No. 2.\nAlejandro Rosario\nRosario posted a 7.11 ERA in his draft year for the University of Miami, and a 7.05 ERA as a sophomore, despite a good arm and a potential out pitch in his splitter that he barely used, as Miami had him working more sinker/changeup. The Rangers took him in the fifth round for the quality of his stuff \u2014 obviously not for the quality of his results \u2014 and told him to throw the splitter and go with a four-seamer up, and voila!, instant prospect! He works from the extreme third-base side of the rubber, getting some more deception against righties, as he has the splitter for lefties and can still be effective against them even without throwing offspeed stuff on the inner third to them. He has elite control already, pounding the strike zone with his fastball and walking just 3.7 percent of batters he faced at both levels of A-ball last year, although that\u2019s likely to go up as older hitters lay off the splitter when it\u2019s out of the zone. He repeats his delivery to keep up the control, and while he\u2019s not very tall he looks strong enough to handle a starter\u2019s workload. Even as is, sitting 92-95 with the plus splitter and a maybe-average slider, he should be a mid-rotation starter and get to the majors this year.\nRyan Waldschmidt\nWaldschmidt got first-round buzz for much of the spring of 2024 but ended up sliding to the No. 31 pick, possibly because teams had concerns about the ACL tear he suffered a year prior. Right now that looks like a boon for the Diamondbacks, who took him with their second selection of the draft. He had one of the best pure hit tools in the draft, rarely missing a fastball and generally not chasing much on any pitches. He hit .370/.500/.653 for Kentucky despite a wide setup and no stride, which limited how much he could generate power from his lower half and resulted in a swing that could get too steep as he tried to loft the ball. He does have room to add 20-25 pounds, and has already made some small mechanical adjustments to try to loosen up his hips and keep his swing in that optimal range for power. In instructional league, the DBacks tried him at third base, where he last played as a freshman at Charleston Southern before he transferred to Kentucky, but the results weren\u2019t good and he should just go to an outfield corner and stay there. He has .300 average/25-homer upside if he can loosen up those hips.\nLazaro Montes\nMontes is a huge, lumbering prospect from Cuba who hits the ball exceptionally hard, so the natural comparison is to a young Yordan Alvarez, who was older than Montes when he first played in full-season ball but reached the majors days before his 22nd birthday. Montes is extremely strong and has produced exit velocities well north of 110 mph, with clear 40 homer upside as long as he hits enough to get to it. He\u2019s not as natural of a hitter as Alvarez, although the Mariners worked with him on pitch selection and a two-strike approach last year and he did see better swing decisions overall. He raked in Low A as a 19-year-old, hitting .309/.411/.527 with just a 19.1 percent strikeout rate, then moved up to High A around the midpoint and hit .260/.378/.427 there with a 29.6 percent strikeout rate, still making hard contact but a lot more whiffs on stuff in the zone. He\u2019s going to end up at first base, as he\u2019s already really big for an outfield corner and doesn\u2019t have much range, but there\u2019s a pretty good chance he hits for enough power and takes enough walks to be an above-average regular there. I don\u2019t think Montes is really the next Yordan; he doesn\u2019t have the same kind of hit tool, but he also doesn\u2019t have Yordan\u2019s knees, which both required surgery when he was 23 and made him even less mobile than he was before.\nCooper Ingle\nIngle was a part-time catcher at Clemson when Cleveland took him in the fourth round in 2023 and announced him as a catcher, a project that of course would make his high-contact, low-power bat a lot more viable. A year and a half later, the project looks like a resounding success, as Ingle reached Double A last year, has walked more than he\u2019s struck out as a pro, and has improved his defense to the point where he\u2019s clearly going to stay at catcher. Ingle knows the strike zone extremely well, and he whiffed just 14 percent of the time he swung last year, with a short, quick swing that has a little more lift in its finish than it did in college, bringing his groundball rate down from 55 percent as a college junior to 45 percent last year. His defense isn\u2019t pretty but he can catch and block, and a quick transfer helps his fringy arm play up to the point where he\u2019s adequate against the running game. He hit 11 homers last year between High A and Double A, all off right-handed pitchers, and he\u2019ll have to show he can make better quality contact against lefties, whereas now he just walks against them. He\u2019s small but well put together, and with his contact and on-base skills he could be a .375 OBP/.400 SLG guy, which is a heck of a regular behind the plate even if he\u2019s just fringy defensively.\nAlex Freeland\nFreeland broke his hamate bone in his draft year in 2022, then struggled in his full-season debut in 2023, hitting .240/.345/.362 in High A while dealing with some minor injuries. His production took off last year after getting fully healthy and making some small adjustments to his swing. He ripped through High A and hit .245/.370/.422 in half a season in Double A before a promotion to Triple A to finish the season, where he hit .243/.335/.396 but had some excellent underlying data. Born with a clubfoot that required several surgeries, Freeland runs close to average and plays an average-ish shortstop now with a plus arm. He\u2019s dabbled a little at second and third, playing about 50 innings at each spot last year, and the odds are he\u2019ll end up at one of those spots in the long run. He\u2019s a switch-hitter who doesn\u2019t post huge exit velocities but also doesn\u2019t post a lot of low ones either, averaging over 91 mph in his brief Triple-A time despite never hitting anything above 107. He\u2019s also a very disciplined hitter who doesn\u2019t chase or whiff very often, and has shown above-average power already, with 53 extra-base hits last year, including 18 homers. There isn\u2019t really any projection here beyond further developing the hit tool against better pitching. He doesn\u2019t really need to do anything more to be a solid regular at second or third, or an above-average one if he does manage to stick at shortstop.\nJaison Chourio\nChourio spent all of 2024 in Low A as a 19-year-old and ended up ranking 10th in all of the minors with 86 walks, the most drawn by any teenager in minor league baseball last year. Jackson\u2019s younger brother is also a centerfielder and an excellent athlete, a switch-hitter and centerfielder right now who could end up in a corner as he continues to fill out and who may end up just hitting left-handed. He\u2019s a strong defender right now up the middle with above-average speed, so if he can maintain that even with the physical projection he has left, he could remain in center in the long term. His plate discipline and hand-eye are outstanding, leading to chase and whiff rates well above (better than) average, although he needs to add some hand strength to get some more consistent loft in his finish. His groundball rate in 2024 was 49.3 percent, which was actually his lowest rate at any stop in pro ball. He\u2019s been much better from the left side; batting right-handed last year, he hit just .245/.409/.283, with more walks (16) than total bases (15). It might be a bat speed question, as his right-handed bat path looks fine and he actually gets a little more loft than he does left-handed. He doesn\u2019t have Jackson\u2019s ceiling, but there\u2019s a scenario here where Jaison stays in center and figures out hitting against lefties enough to be a grade 60 player, with 20ish homers and very high OBPs, and the floor is really solid given his very real patience and likelihood of plus defense in a corner. His 2024 did end with a broken wrist, so it\u2019s possible he won\u2019t get all the strength back until some time this summer.\nBryce Rainer\nRainer was the second high school player taken in the 2024 draft and the top high schooler on my draft board, ranking highly as a true shortstop with a plus arm and sneaky power that gives him the chance to be a two-way impact player. He\u2019s a plus defender with great instincts, showing real leadership on his high school team on the field (such as directing other players on positioning) and a plus arm that\u2019s been up to 95 on the mound. He\u2019s power-over-hit right now, with a lot of leverage in his swing and good loft to drive the ball to all fields, but his bat speed is just fair and when he saw good velocity as an amateur he struggled. He\u2019s still pretty raw, especially for a California high school kid, with a lot of room for physical and skills improvements, and the Tigers will probably be able to help him tighten up the swing to be shorter to the ball. It\u2019s 20-homer upside in a plus defensive shortstop as long as he hits enough to get to it.\nArjun Nimmala\nNimmala was one of the youngest draftees in 2023, turning 18 four months after he was picked, and as such should have started 2024 in the complex league rather than Low A, but after a torrid spring training the Jays sent him to the Florida State League \u2026 and he struggled, hitting .167/280/.306 with a 34 percent strikeout rate before the Jays sent him back to the complex to reset. After three weeks there, he went to the complex league for a few games, then returned to Low A and hit .265/.331/.564 the rest of the way. He ended up leading the Florida State League in slugging (.476) and finished fifth in the league with 15 homers, all as the league\u2019s youngest qualifying hitter. He\u2019s a true shortstop with good actions and a plus arm, and the power he showed on the field is legit, as he\u2019s got very strong hands and wrists, with a swing that\u2019s very rotational and puts the ball in the air a ton \u2014 his groundball rate in Low A last year was just 31.4 percent. He\u2019s still only 19 and remains projectable enough to end up a 30-homer bat in a few years; right now it\u2019s more consistently hard contact (his 90th percentile EV in Low A was 102.3 mph, and his EV50 was 99.0 mph on the dot) than huge top-end EV (peak was 107). He\u2019s still a high-risk, high-reward player, as he continued to strike out 29.7 percent of the time in his second go-round in Low A, and generally needs to tighten up his pitch recognition and bring his chase rate (31 percent) down at least a little. I keep coming back to his results for his age, though \u2014 he was younger than Dante Nori, the Phillies\u2019 first-round pick in 2024, for one example \u2014 and the potential for big power at a position up the middle. He\u2019s still every bit the prospect that made him a first-rounder in the 2023 draft \u2014 and a top-10 talent on my own board.\nStarlyn Caba\nCaba was the centerpiece of the trade that sent Jes\u00fas Luzardo to the Phillies, as the Marlins went for some ceiling by adding the young shortstop, who is one of the best defensive infielders in the minors. Caba might be an 80 defender already, with a plus arm, incredible instincts, and quick actions at the position. He played all of 2024 at age 18 and hit .254/.427/.335 in the Florida Complex League, walking 51 times and striking out just 34, before a late-season promotion to Low A, where he still made contact but only hit .179/.304/.190. His approach is real \u2014 rather than that of someone who is up there to walk \u2014 and now he needs to get stronger to be able to do more when he does put the ball in play. His swings are good from both sides of the plate; he can open his hips too early from either side, robbing him of some of the power he might get from his lower half. He only turned 19 in November, so he\u2019s going to get stronger from here. He doesn\u2019t need plus or even average power to be a quality regular given his defense and his on-base skills.\nRalphy Velazquez\nCleveland drafted Velazquez in the first round in 2023 and immediately moved him out from behind the plate to allow him to develop his bat and perhaps reach the majors more quickly than he otherwise would have. His first full pro season was a promising sign in that direction. He got off to a great start as a 19-year-old in Low A, hitting .261/.371/.441 in the first half, before wearing down in the second half. He\u2019s a big, strong kid, but a better hitter than you might expect at first glance, striking out just 20.1 percent of the time in Low A even as one of the youngest players in full-season ball, and he does make hard enough contact to project to 25 homers at his peak. He hits with a wide stance and no stride, just a toe-tap for timing, so he doesn\u2019t get all the power he could out of his lower half and his swing can flatten out because he doesn\u2019t fully rotate his hips. The Guardians tried him in left field last year as well as at first base, and he was capable enough that they\u2019ll probably keep that alive as a possibility for him going forward. His future is in his bat, with contact skills and zone awareness that set him up very well for future success, and cleanup-hitter upside if he loosens up a little to drive the ball more easily.\nCade Horton\nHorton was getting close to a big-league callup last year when he suffered what was first called a lat strain in his start on May 29. It turned out to be a Grade 2 strain of the subscap muscle in his rotator cuff, and his season was over. He\u2019s still rehabbing and should be good to go for spring training, although the Cubs may choose to keep him on a pitch or innings limit as he builds back up. Horton has two plus pitches in his wipeout slider, which he added near the end of his last year at Oklahoma, and a changeup that\u2019s improved substantially since the Cubs got their hands on him. His fastball is 92-96 but plays down from it because he doesn\u2019t have a lot of deception. It has a little cut and pitch models like it, but hitters like it too, hitting it hard when it\u2019s in the zone. He\u2019s probably going to have to be a 40 percent fastball guy and work more to the edges of the zone with it, as it\u2019s not a high-ride pitch for the top of the zone and definitely not one he can use in the heart to get whiffs, but he has the two real weapons to get guys out and has shown above-average control up through Double A. He\u2019s a starter as long as he\u2019s healthy, maybe a No. 3 who takes a little while to figure out his optimal pitching plan. We\u2019ll know a lot more once he gets into a game in Arizona.\nChase Dollander\nDollander\u2019s 2024 season was sort of a consolidation year for him, as he got some of his slider back but doesn\u2019t have it as a consistent plus pitch as it was back in 2022. As a sophomore at Tennessee, he had a wipeout slider, easily a grade 70, and may have been the best college pitcher in the country that spring, but that offseason he went to some sort of self-styled expert and switched to a sweeper that was ineffective \u2014 although it helped the Rockies get him at the ninth pick in the 2023 draft. His changeup has improved significantly in the last two years to be a solid-average pitch, with a little wiggle at the end to help but mostly deceiving hitters from how he throws it. The slider is the key; when it\u2019s on, it\u2019s 85-87 with hard tilt and a big move away from right-handers. It can end up more cutter-like at 89-90, still effective but with a different shape that makes it look more like the fastball, and could even be his best approach to lefties rather than the changeup. The Rockies have already helped him get part of the way back to his 2022 form, and if they can get that slider to be more consistent, it\u2019ll be a real out-pitch, and the weapon he\u2019ll need given his just average command and control. He has a fourth starter floor, but more upside as the slider develops or recovers.\nBlake Mitchell\nMitchell\u2019s first year in a full-season league was a mixed bag, a net positive at the end that didn\u2019t answer some of the concerns that dated back to when the Royals first drafted him at No. 8 in 2023. He\u2019s got power, nearly getting to 20 homers as a teenager in Low A, and the Royals have helped loosen him up a little by reducing the very wide stance he used in high school to a more typical one that has him back in the box to start, giving him lots of room to stride forward and get his hips rotating. He showed excellent ball-strike recognition last year as well, and while he had some difficulty with offspeed stuff, he\u2019s laying off more of those pitches when they\u2019re not strikes than he did before. He seemed to wear down by the summer; he hit .257/.391/.468 in the first half, striking out too often (31.2 percent), then hit .195/.338/.372 from the All-Star break until a promotion to High A for the last two weeks of the season. Mitchell isn\u2019t much of a runner, at least not by the stopwatch, but he\u2019s improved his baserunning significantly and stole 25 bags in 32 attempts. He has a cannon of an arm, with average to above-average receiving and blocking skills now that could end up plus. Mitchell has already made some big adjustments since he signed, which is the best harbinger of a player\u2019s ability to make further adjustments. I\u2019m encouraged by the progress in his swing decisions; if he continues that trend, he\u2019s going to end up an above-average regular, even if it takes him another three or so years to get to the majors.\nEdwin Arroyo\nArroyo missed all of the 2024 regular season after tearing the labrum in his left shoulder in March, undergoing surgery that kept him out until the Arizona Fall League, where he played 18 games but looked understandably rusty. He has the tools to be a plus defender at short, with excellent range and a strong arm, but remains very inconsistent in the field, lacking great timing, dropping his arm on a lot of throws, and otherwise making scouts question whether he\u2019ll have the skills to stay there long term. He has bat speed and has shown he can handle good fastballs, still needing to get stronger and to improve his breaking-ball recognition. He\u2019s also an above-average to plus runner who should add value on the bases. He\u2019s still just 21 and has time to add that strength and work on the pitch recognition, although he\u2019s lost probably 400 or so at-bats that he can\u2019t easily recover due to the injury. Arroyo has everyday ceiling as a shortstop if he can bear down and get more consistent on defense, or he could be a solid regular at second base if he fills out some more and starts hitting the ball harder.\nJesus Made\nI very rarely put international free agents on my top 100 before they\u2019ve played a game in the U.S. complex leagues, but two things worked in Made\u2019s favor this year: the minors are as thin as ever in elite prospects, and he\u2019s really *&^ing good. Made signed for just $950,000 in January 2024 and had a reputation as a power-over-hit guy, but instead he showed up in the DSL and showed a way more mature approach at the plate than expected, walking more than he struck out \u2014 that\u2019s not that hard to do in the DSL, just don\u2019t ever swing \u2014 and making very good swing decisions. He\u2019s barely begun to fill out but already makes hard, loud contact from both sides of the plate, getting compared to Jackson Chourio at the same age, but with better batted-ball data. He\u2019s a shortstop now with a plus arm that will help him with a likely move to third base once he\u2019s a little older, and the Brewers have already given him time at third and second, so they may be thinking along the same lines. He could easily be a top 20 prospect at this time next year if the approach and the loud contact carry over to the ACL or even Low A.\nHarry Ford\nFord had a mixed year in 2024, moving up to Double A and continuing to get on base, albeit with slightly worse results across the board at the plate, while his defense behind the plate was worse and there\u2019s more chance now that he ends up at DH than there was a year ago. He still has very strong plate discipline, chasing pitches out of the zone just 19 percent of the time, about one-third of those were pitches just one ball\u2019s width outside of the zone. He has shown he can lay off many right-handers\u2019 sliders down and away. He has more raw power than his .367 slugging percentage would imply, but last year he just didn\u2019t square the ball up anywhere near as consistently has he had before, and his tendency to pop up pitches a little above the belt got worse. He\u2019s a plus runner and great athlete who moves well behind the dish, but he\u2019s a 45 receiver right now and his plus arm hasn\u2019t translated into even average caught-stealing rates. The Mariners did try him a few games in left field this year, but the early returns weren\u2019t promising. He\u2019s 21, knows the strike zone, has untapped power, and is very athletic, all reasons to still believe there\u2019s upside here, but Ford\u2019s 2024 season was kind of a disappointment, and if he doesn\u2019t stay behind the plate I\u2019m not sure the bat will profile as a regular at any other spot.\nSeaver King\nKing spent two years at Division II Wingate University, then transferred to Wake Forest for his junior year and excelled for the Deacons despite the huge jump in competition, hitting .308/.377/.577 with just a 12 percent strikeout rate. He mostly played third base and centerfield for Wake, occasionally moving to shortstop when Marek Houston was hurt or needed a day off, but the Nats took King with the No. 10 pick and only played him at short in his pro debut. He\u2019s a 55 defender there now and could still improve given his lack of experience and limited instruction there. He\u2019s got a quick bat and is very aggressive at the plate, especially early in counts, because he can put so many pitches in play, even ones out of the zone \u2014 for now, at least, as that doesn\u2019t always work as you get further up the ladder. He\u2019s got sneaky pop, maybe good for 15 homers a year, but his game is going to be much more about hitting for contact and average, since his current swing doesn\u2019t get a ton of lift on the ball. His 55/60 speed makes him a solid defender in center if shortstop doesn\u2019t work out, but he\u2019s most valuable at short and I think he\u2019s going to hit more than enough to be a very good regular there.\nMichael Arroyo\nArroyo needed to get to more power, and he did in 2024, repeating Low A and boosting his slugging percentage by 127 points, then heading up to High A and hitting .290/.397/.519 \u2014 all before his 20th birthday. He signed in January 2022 with the reputation of being an advanced hitter, and that\u2019s been true, as he has a great approach that has him aggressive within the strike zone without expanding outside of it too often. He\u2019s short with a stockier build, with really no chance to stay at shortstop, so there was more pressure on him to hit the ball harder, and he did so, with big improvements in his batted-ball data and his power output. He hit five homers total in 61 games in 2023, then hit 23 in 120 games last year. He barrels the ball very consistently and puts it in the air over 60 percent of the time. In the field, he has a plus arm and good enough hands to stay on the dirt somewhere, playing almost all of his reps at second base last year but with third base also a possibility as long as he doesn\u2019t get much bigger from here. We\u2019ve seen plenty of undersized infielders become All-Stars in recent years because they could square the ball up for frequent hard contact, including Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez and Alex Bregman. That\u2019s Arroyo\u2019s absolute best-case scenario, of course, but as long as he stays on the dirt he should be at least an everyday player.\nEnrique Bradfield, Jr.\nBradfield\u2019s full-season debut went pretty much as expected, as he continued to play elite defense in center and show 80 speed, but he hasn\u2019t made any changes at the plate to try to drive the ball more consistently. He\u2019s one of the best defensive centerfielders in the minors, with huge range thanks to his speed and good reads off the bat, and that and his speed give him a pretty clear floor as a fourth outfielder. That\u2019s buttressed by his high-contact approach; he whiffed only 15 percent of the time he swung last year, according to data from Synergy Sports, and chased pitches out of the zone only 17 percent of the time. He\u2019s still got an overly complicated swing that results in a lot of groundballs, although the Orioles are working with him to try to get him to hit more line drives to the outfield, even just over the infielders\u2019 heads, and let his legs do their thing. He\u2019s slight and not likely to ever hit for more than below-average power, but he\u2019s strong enough to ambush the occasional pitch and pull it out to right. He started 2024 slowly but improved as the season went on, finishing with a month in Double A where he hit .287/.395/.396, which I think is probably his best-case scenario in the majors. Add defense that could be +15 runs in a full season in center and you\u2019ve got a 5-WAR player. He just has to keep progressing at the plate, mechanically and in production, to get there.\nCam Collier\nCollier\u2019s 2024 season was a mixture of some very good stuff and some bad as well, as he mashed as a 19-year-old in High A but also showed up way bigger than he had the year before and he needs to get his conditioning under control. He was one of only nine teenagers to play all of 2024 at High A or above, only turning 20 in November, and hit .248/.355/.443 with 20 homers, tying for second in homers in the Midwest League behind a 23-year-old. He continued to improve his swing decisions, cutting way down on his chase rate from 2023 and picking up pitch types better, even as he was very young for his level. The bad is that Collier has let his body get away from him, as he\u2019s gotten so heavy that he might end up at first base, which is a waste of his athleticism and raises concerns about his makeup and work ethic. There\u2019s just no reason for a 19-year-old with his frame to get this heavy \u2014 he\u2019s listed at 210, but I\u2019d guess he\u2019s closer to 240 \u2014 this soon. His 30-homer upside would still make him a regular at first or DH, and he\u2019s probably to end up with 60+ walks a year. He\u2019s more valuable at third base, of course, with a strong enough arm for it, and he\u2019s also going to put himself at risk of back and knee problems if he doesn\u2019t manage his size.\nKonnor Griffin\nGriffin was the best tools prospect in the 2024 draft class \u2014 meaning he had the best overall combination of physical tools, with potential 60 or 70 grades in power, speed, arm, and fielding in centerfield, but no one seems to know if he\u2019s going to hit. The Pirates took a shot with the No. 9 pick in the draft and will have to be patient, as the history of high school hitters from Mississippi is pretty dismal because of the caliber of competition those hitters face as amateurs. He\u2019s played short and center but looks much better in the outfield, with pro reports on his shortstop defense from instructs not especially glowing, and he\u2019s got a 70 arm that produced low-90s velocity when he pitched. It\u2019s also huge raw power with a swing that generates a ton of leverage, both good from his hip rotation and bad from his deep hand load that creates a longer path. He does have quick hands and should be able to adjust to a shorter swing without sacrificing much power if any, assuming the Pirates decide to go that route. There\u2019s a ton of risk here \u2014 multiple scouts have seen him, raved about the tools, and told me \u201cI just don\u2019t know if he can hit\u201d \u2014 but Griffin offers 30/30 upside with plus defense in center.\nTravis Sykora\nSykora was the first pick on Day 2 of the 2023 draft, and signed with Washington for a first-round bonus. All he did in 2024 was pitch like a first-rounder, as he struck out 39.2 percent of Low-A hitters he faced and walked just 8.2 percent in 85 innings across 20 starts, posting a 2.33 ERA. He\u2019s a giant already, and his delivery has arms and legs flying everywhere, so it must be terrifying for hitters to see all of that mass coming towards them, followed by a small projectile that might be moving at 99 mph. He sits more 93-96, with a slider that ranged from the upper 70s to the mid-80s with short but abrupt downward break, and a heavy split-change around 83-85, with both of the offspeed pitches missing a ton of bats this year. The arm is still kind of late relative to his front leg, and all the moving parts in the delivery make me suspect it\u2019ll always be more control than command for him. He also doesn\u2019t seem to pitch down with his four-seamer at all, which might not be an issue but just strikes me as unusual. Sykora pitched like a future ace last year, and he has two pitches that could get him there. He may have simply out-stuffed Low-A hitters, however, and I would like to see him do it against more advanced hitters before buying in completely.\nSlade Caldwell\nCaldwell would have been a top-10 pick in the 2024 draft if he were 6-1 rather than his actual height, which is definitely less than his listed 5-9 and might be as little as 5-6. No one doubts that he can play, though \u2014 it\u2019s potentially three plus tools in his hit, run, and field grades, with an average-ish arm and below-average power. He\u2019s got a compact swing and excellent plate discipline, approaching at-bats like a leadoff hitter whose job is to get on base any way he can. There\u2019s definite bat speed here, enough to turn on good velocity, but there isn\u2019t average power now and he doesn\u2019t have the projection to get there. His best route to becoming a regular \u2014 or even an above-average one \u2014 is to be a high-OBP, high-contact hitter who steals bases and plays plus defense in center, even with six-to-eight homers a year. He\u2019s not the next Corbin Carroll, another undersized outfielder who the Dbacks selected and developed into a superstar, but he could move quickly through A-ball if his plate discipline is really as good as advertised.\nJacob Misiorowski\nI still believe Misiorowski is 100 percent a reliever, but I also think he\u2019s going to be one of the best relievers in baseball once he gets accustomed to the role. His stuff is so good that he punched out 30 percent of batters he faced in Double A and then again in a brief stint in Triple A, even though he\u2019s got maybe 40 command if you\u2019re kind. He averaged 98 on his four-seamer in Nashville, topping out at 100.7 mph, and his slider sits 90-93, with both pitches easily grading out at 70 and possibly 80. His low- to mid-80s curveball gives him a different look, with some sharp downward break, although his command of that pitch is the worst of the three. He routinely gets more than 7 1/4 feet of extension, so hitters really have no chance, and given how wild he is anyway, who can blame them for standing there and not swinging? He walked 14.3 percent of batters he faced last year, with maybe the best two-pitch combo in the minors, where he could send hitters a telegram to tell them what\u2019s coming and they still couldn\u2019t hit it. It\u2019s a very high-effort delivery and he hasn\u2019t toned it down at all since he signed, which further points to a relief role. If he moves to the bullpen, I think he\u2019ll strike out 40 percent of batters or more and continue to limit hard contact, and become one of the best relievers in the majors. I just do not see any way that delivery and command could work in a rotation.\nAdrian del Castillo\nNo player on this list surprised me more by making the cut than del Castillo, who didn\u2019t make my Arizona top 20 last year, when I said he \u201ccould surface as a capable backup, with some on-base skills and enough defense to catch once or twice a week.\u201d Oops. He hadn\u2019t hit much at all in a stint in Triple-A Reno, one of the minors\u2019 best hitters\u2019 parks, in 2023, but returned there in 2024 and hit .311/.392/.597 with a career-high 26 homers, hitting well on the road as well. He was originally drafted in 2021 as a below-average defensive catcher who could hit but didn\u2019t show much power. He\u2019s worked to improve his receiving and blocking to the point that he\u2019s an average defender with a 45 arm who can really hit and probably has 20-homer power. He barreled up 10 percent of balls he hit while in Triple A, and his EV50 there was 101 mph, with a swing geared to produce hard line drives. He\u2019s best suited to a hybrid role where he catches some of the time and plays first or DHs the rest of the time to get him into the lineup as much as possible. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a star, but I do think he\u2019s an everyday player right now.\nBrayden Taylor\nTaylor had a weird first full year in pro ball in two ways \u2014 he ended up hitting for more power with less contact than I think anyone reasonably expected, and the way he got to all those strikeouts (24.8 percent in High A, 36.8 percent in Double A) was kind of unusual as well. Taylor hits the ball hard and ended up with a great line in High A beyond the strikeouts, hitting .269/.389/.513 with 44 extra-base hits in 84 games, before struggling in 30 games in Double A, where he hit .194/.290/.435 \u2014 still showing power, but of course with way too many Ks. He did raise his bat path a little, making it steeper to manufacture some more lift, which might explain the increase in strikeouts \u2014 he actually doesn\u2019t chase much at all, and he doesn\u2019t miss a ton in-zone, but when he does expand, it\u2019s kind of disastrous for him.\nChase DeLauter\nRegular readers of mine know I don\u2019t like DeLauter\u2019s swing \u2014 at all, really. It\u2019s the worst-looking swing on this list. I\u2019m not even sure who\u2019s second. But DeLauter has also had success everywhere he\u2019s played so far in the minors, and the biggest knock on him right now isn\u2019t the fact that looking directly at his swing will turn you to stone, but that he hasn\u2019t been able to stay on the field for a full season. Since the Guardians took him with the No. 16 pick in 2022, at which point he was already out with a broken bone in his left foot, DeLauter has played in just 96 regular-season games, plus two stints in the AFL. The original fracture cost him the remainder of 2022. He required surgery in that winter after he re-fractured it, then suffered another fracture in that foot in April 2024, then developed turf toe in his first game back from that injury. He strained his hamstring in late August and missed another month. On the plus side, he\u2019s hit very well when he\u2019s been able to play. He destroyed A-ball pitching, hit .271/.353/.436 in 36 games in Double A across two years, and went 7-for-23 with two homers in Triple A this year, followed by his second straight year of excellent production in the AFL. As for the swing, he opens his hips very early and then almost drags the bat through the zone, with a swing that looks like he\u2019s trying to scoop the ball and pull it out to right. As a result, he doesn\u2019t hit anything on the outer third for any power at all, and in a small sample so far lefties have really crushed him, especially with breaking stuff. He\u2019s going to have to make some adjustments to get him on time to the zone more consistently, and I think major-league pitchers are going to attack that front hip with velocity up and in, which he can only hit on the ground, and then go soft away to exploit the swing. Nobody has really done that effectively so far in his career, however, so maybe he\u2019s just good enough to work around them and use his high contact skills to force pitchers to pitch to his strengths \u2014 Dustin Pedroia did something similar, and he had a very unorthodox swing as well. DeLauter\u2019s also a 55 runner and might be a plus defender in a corner, although I think his propensity to get hurt probably makes centerfield a non-starter.\nRonny Mauricio\nMauricio missed all of 2024 after tearing his ACL while playing winter ball, then had a minor setback in his rehab that might delay his return further, although right now he\u2019s expected to be ready for the start of the regular season. Prior to the injury, he was the Mets\u2019 top prospect, with lightning in his wrists that produces grade-70 power, peaking at 117 mph in his brief major-league debut. He\u2019s just way too aggressive at the plate, chasing offspeed stuff out of the zone at a rate that\u2019s not going to be sustainable for a major-league regular \u2014 which is why the loss of a year-plus of plate appearances was so damaging for him, as he needs to work on ball/strike and pitch recognition, and the best way to do that is by playing. I\u2019ve said before he reminds me a ton of Alfonso Soriano, who had similarly electric wrists, never figured out shortstop, and wasn\u2019t anything close to \u201cpatient\u201d at the plate, but improved his approach enough to hit 412 homers and play 16 years in the majors. That\u2019s a best-case scenario for Mauricio, and probably more unlikely after the injury. We\u2019ll have to see where he is on his return, what he\u2019s swinging (or not swinging) at, and how he moves in the field.\nTermarr Johnson\nThis is the, uh, get off the pot year for Johnson, as it is for several of his classmates from the 2022 draft (Druw Jones, Cam Collier). He\u2019s entering his age-21 season and still hasn\u2019t shown the plus hit tool everyone seemed to think he had as an amateur. Johnson failed to post a .250 batting average for the second year in a row and hit for even less power in 2024 than he had in 2023, again drawing a ton of walks while hitting too many groundballs and pop-ups. Johnson has excellent bat speed and clearly knows the strike zone, and he showed real progress during the season as the Pirates worked with him on his swing decisions to get him to do more damage on pitches on the inner half. He also moved further back in the box, and as a result of those adjustments, he cut down on his whiff and chase rates after the All-Star break and pulled the ball more often. Unfortunately, none of it translated into more hits or more power. A .237/.367/.386 season line isn\u2019t going to make him more than an extra guy in the majors. He has too good of a swing and too much plate discipline to not hit at least in the high .200s.\nNoble Meyer\nMeyer was the No. 10 pick in the 2023 draft, far and away the best high school pitching prospect in that draft class, but he showed up for his first spring training behind his peers, with his fastball velocity down several ticks after his personal offseason program. While his velocity did eventually improve, it was a harbinger of a first year that was a mixed bag, to put it mildly. He\u2019d touched triple digits in high school with high spin rates on his fastball and two breaking balls, but in his first outing in the regular season last year he was just 90-93, building up to 93-97 in his final outing in Low A on May 25. He\u2019s got a very long arm swing and his arm can be a little late, despite which he still shows a plus slider that generated a 41 percent whiff rate in Low A. His changeup continued to improve and it\u2019s plus when he lands it, with too many finishing out of the strike zone right now, while his curveball backed up and wasn\u2019t the same plus weapon it was for him in high school. His control overall was nowhere near where it should be, as he walked 16.3 percent of batters he faced in Low A and 17.9 percent in High A, approaching a level where it\u2019s fair to question if he\u2019ll ever have the control to be a major-league starter. Meyer showed No. 1 starter stuff in high school and he flashed some of it last year, but this wasn\u2019t the same guy the Marlins drafted. I\u2019m not giving up on him as a future above-average starter, to be clear, as the stuff is too good, but am acknowledging that his odds of ending up a reliever went up even as he got through his age-19 season without injury.\nJaden Hamm\nHamm was Detroit\u2019s fifth-round pick in 2023 after his first full year as a starter for Middle Tennessee State. He had an unusually high arm slot \u2014 nearly over the top \u2014 for a starting pitcher but a real weapon in his curveball. He went to High A last year and cut his walk rate from 10.4 percent in 2023 before the draft to 7.8 percent in the minors this past season, striking out 30.6 percent of batters with a full assortment of pitches. His curveball is still plus, his slider is at least solid-average, and his straight changeup is surprisingly effective \u2014 it\u2019s hard to throw a changeup from that high of a slot, but he does it, and hitters don\u2019t especially care for it. He\u2019s working much more to his glove side now than he did in college, using the fastball and slider that way, since the slider is his only pitch with much horizontal movement, and he had no platoon split at all in High A last year. The knock on Hamm is that he didn\u2019t hold his velocity all season, and he got hit a little more as the fastball velo declined over the course of the summer. It was his first full pro season, and he only spent one spring as a full-time starter in college, so this was the most he\u2019d ever pitched without some kind of break or layoff, which is the only reason I\u2019m willing to cut him some slack on the velo dip. If that happens again, he\u2019s probably a reliever, and has the weapons to be a good one. His spot on the top 100 is a bet that he\u2019ll stay a starter with more experience and perhaps a little work with the Tigers\u2019 strength and conditioning team, ending up a solid No. 3 or more. If that doesn\u2019t work, he could be a bulk reliever given how many effective offspeed pitches he has, just working less than a starter to try to keep his velocity up.\nDruw Jones\nJones\u2019 second full year in the minors went a lot better than his first. For one thing, he stayed healthy all year, playing 109 games after playing just 41 (including rehab games) the year before. For another, he started to produce for the first time in pro ball, hitting .275/.409/.405, tying for 12th in all of the minors with 85 walks \u2014 same as his draft classmate Termarr Johnson. It\u2019s not all good news, as he still hit the ball on the ground way too often (57.2 percent of the time) for a guy with plus raw power, and his defense in center was more often grade 60 than 70 \u2014 or grade 80, like his father\u2019s. He\u2019s shown more in-game power the other way than to his pull side, and doesn\u2019t really try to turn on stuff on the inner third yet. His ball/strike recognition turned out to be much more advanced than expected, and the fact that he came back as well as he did from a 2023 season that was ruined by multiple injuries and some visible uncertainty at the plate is a positive sign. He could still end up just an extra outfielder but I think it\u2019s too soon to assume that, given the power and plus defense he showed as an amateur.\nTrey Yesavage\nThe Jays\u2019 2024 first-round pick at the No. 20 pick was ranked 13th on my own board, and the No. 3 starter in the class (again, my rankings), coming off a dominant year for East Carolina where he struck out 145 in 93 innings (40.3 percent) and posted a 2.03 ERA \u2014 and didn\u2019t turn 21 until two weeks after the draft. He has one of the shortest arm actions I\u2019ve ever seen on a prospect of his caliber, but the stuff that comes out is undeniable, as he has a 91-96 mph four-seamer and a plus splitter with huge bottom and even some lateral movement, along with a decent slider in the mid-80s he uses mostly versus right-handers. His short arm stroke and the shape of his stuff make him much more of a north-south pitcher and I think he\u2019ll have to find something to work a little more east-west, just to keep hitters honest on both sides of the zone. The delivery does worry me, because it\u2019s unusual, and short arm actions like this generally end up in the bullpen. He\u2019s been healthy the last two years as a starter for ECU, however, and I wouldn\u2019t change anything given how good the stuff is. I\u2019d move him as quickly as possible, as you\u2019re not waiting for any projection on the current pitches, and see a potential No. 3 starter in the near future.\nYoeilin Cespedes\nCespedes\u2019 stateside debut was limited to 25 games and 105 PA before he broke a hamate bone, but he flashed some of why he earned a $1.4 million bonus in January 2023. He\u2019s small but strong, with a powerful swing for someone his size that backs up the numbers he\u2019s produced so far, with 11 homers in 71 career games between the DSL and Florida Complex League. He hit .319/.400/.615 in that brief stint in Florida last year, striking out just 19 times in the 105 PA, showing strong command of the strike zone already. He\u2019s not going to stick at shortstop, however, and might end up at third base rather than second given his frame and how his body looks now at age 19. He\u2019ll move to Low A this year and may take some time to get all his hand strength back; beyond that, he looks like a hitter who could move quickly through the low minors because he\u2019s stronger and more polished than the typical teenaged hitter, with the upside of an above-average regular at third with fringy defense but a strong all-around offensive game.\nGeorge Lombard\nLombard was the Yankees\u2019 first-round pick in 2023 out of a South Florida high school, and he spent all of 2024 in full-season ball when he would previously have spent it at the now-defunct short-season level \u2014 yet another example of a player hurt by the contraction of the minors. His overall line of .231/.338/.334 is unimpressive, but under the hood there\u2019s quite a bit to like. Lombard injured his hamstring in April, spending two weeks on the injured list but apparently battling it on and off throughout the year even after he returned. He did make some hard contact that didn\u2019t show up in his stat line, topping out at 110 mph, and there is still a ton of projection on his 6-2 (or taller) frame to come into more bat speed and eventually in-game power. He just wasn\u2019t ready for full-season ball; he could pick up offspeed stuff pretty well but had a hard time catching up to plus fastballs and ended up behind in the count too often. When healthy, he\u2019s a plus runner, which might slide down towards 55 speed as he gets bigger. He\u2019s also likely to move off shortstop but end up a plus defender at third or second, probably third given his above-average arm and eventual size. There\u2019s a lot of maybes here, and the surface numbers aren\u2019t impressive; just bear in mind that, like a lot of teenagers, he didn\u2019t belong in whatever the heck Low A is at this point, and that he got on base as well as he did, flashing some very hard contact for a teenager, is actually very promising.\nJoe Mack\nMack was the No. 31 pick in the 2021 draft, then missed most of 2022 with injuries and had a disappointing 2023 in High A, hitting .218/.295/.287, although he did stay healthy enough to get 503 plate appearances. He returned to High-A Beloit to start 2024 and took off, hitting so well in 13 games that the Marlins very wisely bumped him up to Double A, where he hit .241/.322/.456 with 22 homers in 112 games and a 25.7 percent strikeout rate as a 21-year-old. Only four minor-league catchers hit more homers than Mack did last year; two are on this list, one can\u2019t really catch, and the last is 33 years old. It\u2019s all-fields power \u2014 nine of his 24 total homers on the season were to left or centerfield. He\u2019s improved behind the plate to become an above-average receiver and maybe even a plus framer, while he\u2019s always had a plus arm and threw out 34 percent of runners last year. He still has to work on some pitch recognition, as he was way better against fastballs and his inexperience against pitchers who could really spot a slider or drop a changeup away showed. The bar to be an everyday catcher in the majors is so low, however, that even if Mack ends up a .290 OBP guy with 20 homers and 55 defense, he\u2019d be a very good regular, and that\u2019s well within his reach.\nSal Stewart\nStewart moved up to High A last year and hit .279/.391/454 in 80 games for Dayton as a 20-year-old before suffering an \u201coff-field\u201d injury, tearing a tendon in his wrist. It required surgery and ended his season. He continues to show a very advanced approach, recognizing all pitch types and commanding the strike zone, and has tweaked his swing since he first signed to hit far more line drives and fewer groundballs. He had a 27.8 percent line-drive rate in 2024, which would have ranked third in the Midwest League if he\u2019d qualified, and he makes hard contact, just without enough loft or huge exit velocities to put the ball in the seats. It\u2019s a short path to the ball with some lift to it, but with more doubles power that puts a lot of line drives into the gaps. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s got the projection left to end up a 20-homer guy, but he has a reputation as both a hard worker and a guy who likes to work out, so I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s impossible. He\u2019s a fringy defender at third and played some second as well in 2024, probably a 45 defender at either spot, with first base the default option if he can\u2019t stay elsewhere on the dirt. The worst-case scenario is he\u2019s a 10-homer first baseman with above-average OBPs, a regular on some teams but not all; the best-case one is where he sticks at third, gets stronger for 20+ homers, and has OBPs close to .400 \u2026 which would probably make him an MVP candidate, now that I spell it out.\nAdditional top prospect coverage\nGO DEEPER\nMLB prospects who just missed Keith Law\u2019s top 100 ranking: Caissie, Saggese and more\nGO DEEPER\nMLB 2025 farm system rankings: Keith Law ranks all 30 teams, Mariners are new No. 1\nGO DEEPER\nA list of every MLB team\u2019s top 20 prospects for 2025 by division\n(Top photo illustration by Demetrius Robinson / The Athletic; Photos from left to right \u2014 Jackson Jobe, Samuel Basallo, Roman Anthony, Sebastian Walcott: Tim Warner, Christopher Pasatieri / Getty Images; Brace Hemmelgarn / Minnesota Twins / Getty Images; Chris Bernacchi / Diamond Images via Getty Images)"

      "text": "DETROIT \u2014 For the Detroit Tigers, a concerning trend has emerged since the All-Star break. It has carried on even after they ended their July losing streak, even as they stacked a few wins and got back to some semblance of normalcy.\nSince the break, the Tigers lead MLB with a 25.9 percent strikeout rate. Worse, they also have the lowest walk rate of any team at only 4.7 percent.\nAdvertisement\nThose numbers were entering Wednesday\u2019s game against the Twins. Detroit proceeded to strike out seven times and walked only once.\nIn a series where the Tigers dropped two of three to a Twins team that traded 11 players at the deadline, Detroit batters walked only three times.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do too much,\u201d Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to hit every pitch for damage. We\u2019re trying to cover all sorts of shapes. When you try to do too much, it\u2019s not a great recipe against any pitching that you face.\u201d\n\u201cDominate the strike zone\u201d was the first mantra of the Scott Harris era. The Tigers have not quite done that to the extent one might expect given their first-place status.\nFor the year, the Tigers have the fourth-highest strikeout rate in the league. They rank 20th with an 8 percent walk rate.\nEven with a bullpen that struggles to generate strikeouts, Detroit has fared better in the pitching department. Fueled largely by Tarik Skubal, Tigers pitchers rank eighth in K percentage and have the fifth-lowest BB percentage in the league.\nBut at the plate, the swing-and-miss and punchouts are a real concern. Riley Greene is the Tigers\u2019 best position player but has also been the face of these issues. After striking out three times on Wednesday, Greene leads MLB with 153 Ks. Mark Reynolds holds the single-season record for most strikeouts at 223. There are 46 games to play, and if Greene continues to strike out at his current clip, he could threaten to break that unfortunate mark.\nOverall, the Tigers\u2019 propensity to whiff and inability to draw walks is the type of issue that could threaten this team\u2019s longevity in October.\nAs they fight through a difficult stretch after a sterling first half, that\u2019s only one of the issues plaguing this team.\nThe Matt Vierling factor\nThe Tigers\u2019 AL Central lead is down to six games. They still have a cushion. But things are getting too close for comfort.\nAdvertisement\nOne thing that would help the Tigers immensely? Getting improved production from a key member of last year\u2019s playoff team.\nMatt Vierling, a heartbeat of the Tigers who missed most of the first half because of a shoulder injury, misplayed two balls in center field Tuesday night. He stood at his locker the next morning, explained the plays and owned it, professional as ever.\n\u201cI\u2019m not making excuses, but for a center fielder, those low liners can be tough to read,\u201d Vierling said. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell how hard they\u2019re exactly hit. They just keep going, and I probably cut it off just a little too much.\u201d\nVierling responded with a couple of stellar plays in Wednesday\u2019s game at Comerica Park, including a fifth-inning diving catch that likely saved a run.\nWith Parker Meadows still on the injured list, the Tigers are trusting Vierling to keep center field on lock. But they are also waiting on his bat to get going. Vierling\u2019s two hits Tuesday marked his first two-hit game of the season. Vierling followed that by going 1-for-3 on Wednesday, bumping his average up to .224.\nIt has been a difficult year for Vierling since he hurt his shoulder in spring training. Hinch has cited the difficulties of ramping up in-season. Vierling had a combined 74 plate appearances over two rehab assignments. He now has more than a spring training\u2019s worth of MLB plate appearances this season. Vierling, though, has yet to hit a home run and has only two extra-base hits, both doubles. He has yet to tap into the timing and pull-side power that helped him hit 16 home runs and post a 3.0 bWAR season last year.\nThe Tigers have felt a jolt from the return of Kerry Carpenter. Players like Spencer Torkleson and Dillon Dingler continue to hit well. But it\u2019s undoubtedly time for Vierling to get going. He could be one of the Tigers\u2019 most crucial players from now to the end of the season.\nAdvertisement\nTommy Kahnle\u2019s woes\nWhen the calendar hit July 1, Tommy Kahnle had been a terrific signing for the Tigers. But life in the bullpen is not for the faint of heart.\nKahnle has since lost a touch of depth on his changeup. The pitch has been moving less both vertically and horizontally since July 1. His walk rates have jumped. He has allowed hard contact in bunches.\nAn ERA that sat at 1.77 entering July is now 4.87. And with Kahnle currently not pitching like a high-leverage option, it has had a downstream effect on the rest of the Tigers\u2019 bullpen.\nKahnle could certainly right the ship and reassert himself as a reliable back-end bullpen arm. But as his struggles continue \u2014 he walked three batters and surrendered an earned run Wednesday \u2014 he is teetering toward going down as a miss in the list of Tigers\u2019 offseason signings. While Gleyber Torres has been a clear victory, John Brebbia was designated for assignment on June 19, and Jack Flaherty has a 4.56 ERA after a difficult start on Wednesday. The Tigers entered the season returning every member of their playoff roster. But they needed additions like Kahnle to help take them to a higher level.\nIn the first half, it was working.\nNow, Kahnle is at the forefront of bullpen issues that don\u2019t yet show signs of improving.\nPaul Sewald waits patiently\nDeadline acquisition Paul Sewald is in Detroit, continuing his rehab from a shoulder injury in hopes he can help the Tigers in September and October.\n\u201cWe do things day-by-day in rehab,\u201d Sewald said Tuesday. \u201cI felt great today after my first day of catch yesterday. I\u2019ll let you know tomorrow how it feels after my first day of rehab.\u201d\nBad as this stretch has been for the Tigers \u2014 they have dropped six of their past seven series \u2014 the reality is that the Tigers still are the overwhelming favorites to win the division. They can, at least theoretically, afford more bullpen experimentation in August. And they could welcome a new addition in September.\nAdvertisement\nPerhaps part of the team\u2019s thinking in trading for Sewald was that relievers are volatile commodities. Rather than pay a hefty prospect price to acquire a frontline closer, they were able to send cash or a player to be named later to Cleveland and get a pitcher who could end up being just as good in October, when things really matter.\nIt\u2019s hard to say whether the season will actually work out that way. Sewald is on the 60-day injured list and isn\u2019t eligible to be activated until Sept. 10 at the earliest.\nBut Sewald has closer experience. He averages 10.8 K/9 for his career. He fits the profile of a pitcher who could help this team.\nOnly two years ago, Sewald was traded from the Mariners to the Diamondbacks. Sewald ended up saving six postseason games as the underdog D-Backs made a run to the World Series.\nIf he gets healthy, could the Sewald trade be more shrewd than it first appeared?\nFor now, it\u2019s a thought to chew on.\n\u201cI\u2019ve only been traded once, and we went to the World Series,\u201d Sewald joked. \u201cThat\u2019s my standard around here, so no pressure. I\u2019m excited for this team.\u201d\n(Top photo: Junfu Han / USA Today Network)"

      "text": "Jen Pawol, the first female umpire to reach Triple A in three and a half decades, is another step closer to the big leagues. Pawol will umpire major-league spring training games in Florida this season, becoming just the third woman to do so, and the first since 2007.\nPawol, who will also be elevated to the role of Triple-A crew chief, is aiming to become the first woman to umpire a regular-season MLB game, which could come as early as 2024.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI\u2019ve put the gas to full throttle and we are going for it full speed,\u201d Pawol said on Monday. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable in my own shoes, I\u2019ve grown into my wings so to speak and this is the narrative, this is the storyline, the plot. And people are excited and encouraging. And when it comes down to it I just have to get my next play right.\u201d\nPawol was one of 24 umpires announced Monday to do big-league spring training games. She will be based in the Jupiter area and is tentatively scheduled for her first game in West Palm Beach on Feb. 24. The 47-year-old Pawol, who was promoted to Triple A last spring, started her career in the Gulf Coast League in 2016 and has been steadily working her way up.\n\u201cI hear a lot of, \u2018You\u2019re going to do it, you\u2019re going to be the first one, keep going,\u201d Pawol said of the reaction she\u2019s gotten from fans. \u201cI get asked a lot for my autograph\u2026it\u2019s been very positive for sure.\u201d\nPawol said any autograph requests always come with the caveat that everyone on the crew has to sign.\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting all four of us or none of us,\u201d she said. \u201c(We) spread the love around there.\u201d\nBaseball\u2019s history with female umpires hasn\u2019t always been so rosy. Pam Postema spent 13 seasons in the minor leagues, becoming the first woman to umpire a big-league spring game in her final season in 1989. After six years at Triple A, Postema had her contract canceled.\nTeresa Cox was another early pioneer (1989-91). She tried to alter her voice and received criticism for her appearance. Both women filed lawsuits, Postema alleging sex discrimination and Cox (who now goes by Fairlady) alleging harassment and abuse within the umpiring community; both suits were eventually settled out of court.\nRia Cortesio was the second woman to umpire a major-league spring training game. She was released in 2007 after nine years, the last five at Double A, following a season in which she started as the top-ranked umpire in the league.\nAdvertisement\nPawol has cited Cortesio and Postema, who wrote a tell-all book on her experiences, as mentors. She said Monday she\u2019s been texting with both women since the news that she\u2019d be umpiring in big-league camp. Pawol got word of her promotion in a phone call last week.\nWhile other major professional sports, like the NFL and NHL have had female officials, Pawol is baseball\u2019s best shot. There were five female umpires in professional baseball last year, but she was the only one above Class A.\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to make it,\u201d said Pawol\u2019s crew chief Jonathan Ortega last summer, who called Pawol one of the hardest workers he\u2019s ever seen. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it will be one year or two years from now, but I think she\u2019s going to do it.\u201d\nPawol, a former catcher at Hofstra, got a masters degree in painting from Hunter College. She umpired fastpitch softball on the weekends to help pay her tuition. Pawol rose through the levels of fastpitch, and a colleague snuck her into some amateur baseball tournaments, but the presence of a woman umpire rocked the boat and, Pawol says, was always met with resistance by tournament administrators.\nIn January 2015, Pawol attended Southern Umpires Camp in Atlanta, Ga. Baseball clinics offered more drills and skills than softball and she was looking to be more well-rounded after a dozen softball clinics and nearly 2,000 amateur games under her belt. Longtime MLB umpire Ted Barrett was among the instructors and was impressed by Pawol. He told her about MLB\u2019s free one-day umpiring camp in Cincinnati, which was open to everyone.\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m a woman, right?\u201d Pawol quipped.\nIntrigued by Barrett\u2019s offer, Pawol booked a one-way ticket to Cincinnati for Aug. 15, 2015. She wasn\u2019t planning on returning to her day job: She wanted to win a coveted scholarship to the league\u2019s umpire academy. And that\u2019s exactly what she did. Pawol made her debut in the Gulf Coast League the following year.\nAdvertisement\nIn some ways, the crew chief promotion is just as important as big-league spring training. Pawol will now be responsible for the logistics of her crew\u2019s schedule, as well as be the leader on and off the field. As a Triple-A crew chief, Pawol is considered to be in a small group of call-ups should there be any injury or illness to current big-league umpires.\nEvery spring in her eight-year career, Pawol would be on the backfields at the minor league games, hoping, praying she\u2019d get a chance at the big-league spring stadium. This year, that dream has come true. While it\u2019s still a stepping stone to where she wants to go, \u201cfor any umpire in the pro system this is a big, big deal,\u201d said Pawol, who estimated she probably has 1,000 pro games under her belt.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of innings, a lot of work to get there, it\u2019s very humbling because it\u2019s need-based, there\u2019s only so many slots\u2026As far as the other meaning that it has (getting the chance to be the the first woman in MLB), I feel like I need to keep getting the next play right and I try not to let that or other distractions get in.\u201d\nRequired reading\n(Photo courtesy of Jen Pawol)"

      "text": "Veteran right-hander Aaron Civale, bumped from the Milwaukee Brewers\u2019 rotation by top prospect Jacob Misiorowski, has asked for a trade.\nCivale\u2019s agent, Jack Toffey, said he made the request to Brewers general manager Matt Arnold after the team informed the pitcher he was moving to the bullpen.\n\u201cThe conversation was very professional,\u201d Toffey said Thursday. \u201cI just very respectfully said that Aaron would really like an opportunity to continue his career as a starter. He\u2019s going to be a free agent at the end of the year.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe Brewers are one of the few clubs with a seeming surplus of starting pitching. Toffey said Arnold told him the team was \u201cexploring options.\u201d\nArnold did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the Brewers did wish Civale, who turned 30 on Thursday, a happy birthday.\nHappy birthday @AaronCivale #DeltaDentalBirthdays pic.twitter.com/LFG8ApTrf1\n\u2014 Milwaukee Brewers (@Brewers) June 12, 2025\nCivale has made all 122 of his regular-season appearances as a starter. He did pitch in relief in Game 1 of last year\u2019s wild-card series against the New York Mets, working three scoreless innings to close out an 8-4 defeat.\nThe Brewers acquired Civale from the Tampa Bay Rays last July 3 in a trade for minor-league infielder Gregory Barrios. Civale pitched well in 14 starts after joining Milwaukee, going 6-3 with a 3.53 ERA. He strained his left hamstring in his first outing of 2025, but produced a 3.32 ERA over 19 innings in four starts after returning on May 22.\nThe promotion of Misiorowski, who will make his major-league debut against the St. Louis Cardinals on Thursday night, left the Brewers with a decision. Civale was the odd man out in a rotation that includes Freddy Peralta, Chad Patrick, Quinn Priester and Jos\u00e9 Quintana \u2014 and other options at Triple A and on the injured list.\nOn May 26, the Brewers demoted right-hander Logan Henderson after he produced a 1.71 ERA in his first four major-league starts. Right-hander Tobias Myers, a stalwart in the rotation last season, is also at Triple A, while left-hander Nestor Cortes Jr. and righty Brandon Woodruff are working their way back from injuries.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard from other teams, through their channels of communication, that they have a plethora of starting pitching and are looking for trade partners, maybe not just on Aaron, but maybe another pitcher,\u201d Toffey said. \u201cThat\u2019s my understanding.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nCivale is earning $8 million, matching Peralta for the highest salary among Brewers pitchers. The Brewers, operating with the game\u2019s 24th-highest Opening Day payroll, often seek to create opportunities for less expensive options. And Misiorowski is the game\u2019s No. 87 prospect, according to The Athletic\u2019s Keith Law.\n\u201cAaron is not angry or banging his fist on the table,\u201d Toffey said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a little confusing because he did not pitch his way out of the rotation whatsoever. It\u2019s more of a subjective choice the organization is making.\u201d\n(Photo: Benny Sieu / Imagn Images)"
