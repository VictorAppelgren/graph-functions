The Tinley Park Jazz Band, directed by Robert Good was formed around 1990.\n\nThe Tinley Park Community Band and Jazz Band are active year-round sharing their talents and bringing the sound of live concert band and jazz music to Tinley Park and surrounding communities. The band was established in 1987 and performs throughout the Chicagoland area. Many of these concerts are free or have a very low admission fee, making an afternoon or evening of live music affordable and family-friendly. The band performs a wide ranging repertoire, including marches, show tunes, popular songs, contemporary compositions and classical band literature. Members come from all over the Chicagoland suburbs.\n\nThe Concert Band also represents the Village of Tinley Park. It made successful tours to Germany in 1994 and 2000 as part of the Tinley Park-B\u00fcdingen Sister Cities cultural exchange program. In 2004, the band represented the State of Illinois at ceremonies surrounding the dedication of the National World War II Memorial in Washington D.C.
