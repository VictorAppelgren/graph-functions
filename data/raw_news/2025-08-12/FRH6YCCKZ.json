  "description": "Former \u201cSuperman\u201d actor Dean Cain took a shot at \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d host John Oliver after he mocked him and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in a segment on his s\u2026",
  "content": "Former \u201cSuperman\u201d actor Dean Cain ridiculed \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d host John Oliver on Monday over his monologue claiming Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was \u201cf\u2014ed\u201d if they let the actor join its ranks.\n\nNear the end of his show on Sunday, Oliver mocked both ICE and Cain over news that ICE had removed its age limits and would be swearing in the \u201cLois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman\u201d star as an \u201chonorary ICE officer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, there\u2019s an old saying in Hollywood: \u2018If all you can get is Dean Cain, you are f\u2014ed,\u2019\u201d Oliver said on his show.\n\n\u201cNow, I\u2019m not saying that ICE isn\u2019t finding people. I\u2019m just saying, when you are reduced to pinning a badge on the 59-year-old star of \u2018The Dog Who Saved Christmas,\u2019 \u2018The Dog Who Saved Christmas Vacation,\u2019 \u2018The Dog Who Saved the Holidays,\u2019 \u2018The Dog Who Saved Halloween,\u2019 \u2018The Dog Who Saved Easter,\u2019 and \u2018The Dog Who Saved Summer,\u2019 maybe you are in trouble.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAlthough, on the plus side, no need for that guy to wear a mask because the chances of anyone recognizing him are f\u2014ing zero.\u201d\n\nCain mocked the HBO host in kind on X the next morning.\n\n\u201cHe stole that mask joke from the internet \u2014 and he also laughed hysterically when Trump said he was going to run for President. Case closed. (and those movies were sweet, by the way!),\u201d Cain wrote.\n\nDuring the show, Oliver also gave advice to viewers on how to interact with ICE agents, telling them to only say \u201cAm I free to leave?\u201d and \u201cI want to speak to a lawyer.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I recognize that in some cases you may be unable to help yourself from saying, \u2018Didn\u2019t you used to be Superman? I thought you died. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m meeting a filmmaker,\u2019 but that really is it,\u201d Oliver joked.\n\nCain will be sworn in as an honorary officer in the coming month, assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s spokesperson, said. Although it wasn\u2019t immediately clear what his duties as an honorary officer would entail.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News Digital, Cain described joining ICE as a way to show support for the officers that he believes were being \u201cvilified\u201d for doing their jobs.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a legal citizen here in this country, no worries, you\u2019re great, but if you\u2019re here illegally, you\u2019ve broken the law to begin with, whatever the circumstances are. You had multiple opportunities to self-deport, and the fact that these men and women who are doing their jobs are getting vilified, I had to stand up with them and for them, because I think it takes people standing up to change the culture,\u201d Cain said.\n\nCain also defended joining ICE during a heated debate with anti-Trump The Bulwark host Tim Miller on \u201cPiers Morgan Uncensored\u201d on Monday.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019ve got ICE agents \u2014 and, apparently, former \u2018Superman\u2019 actors \u2014 who are going to jump out of vans and nab them and hold them in deportation cells. That\u2019s insane. Like, that\u2019s not how you act in a free country,\u201d Miller mocked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not untrained,\u201d Cain shot back, bringing up how he became a deputy sheriff and a reserve police officer nearly a decade ago.\n\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re saying untrained. And by the way, when you join ICE, they train you. So, to say that and try to denigrate because I\u2019m an actor, I shouldn\u2019t be able to be concerned about what\u2019s going on with our borders or with our law enforcement agencies is denigrating. It\u2019s ridiculous. Should I say because you\u2019re a former Republican strategist, you have no say on anything? That\u2019s baloney,\u201d he added.",

And they're black, and they are brown and green and yellow and Japanese and whatever. They're a cross-section of Americans,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"They are doing their job, the job that Congress wrote the laws for them to support and uphold, and they're doing the job of deporting people who are here illegally.\n\"If you're a legal citizen here in this country, no worries, you're great, but if you're here illegally, you've broken the law to begin with, whatever the circumstances are. You had multiple opportunities to self-deport, and the fact that these men and women who are doing their jobs are getting vilified, I had to stand up with them and for them because I think it takes people standing up to change the culture,\" Cain said.\n\"I had to stand up with them and for them because I think it takes people standing up to change the culture.\"\nCain said he considers Daniel Penny, the former Marine acquitted of negligent homicide in the death of Jordan Neely on a New York subway in 2023, and Dan Bongino, United States deputy director of the FBI, to be American heroes.\nHe was inspired by their stories and decided to film a recruitment video for ICE since it was looking for agents, and he \"supports it.\"\nWATCH: 'SUPERMAN' ACTOR DEAN CAIN BECOMES ICE AGENT TO SUPPORT 'VILIFIED' OFFICERS ENFORCING IMMIGRATION LAW\n\"I know it's controversial, but I support what they're doing. It's controversial because people look at it emotionally as opposed to what the law is and what we're trying to do here. And then they don't look at it critically and think, you know, \u2018What does allowing 20 million people into this country illegally do to voting, to our services, our health support services, our social services?\u2019 It destroys it,\" he said.\n\"Social Security, Medicaid, it just destroys everything that we have worked for and built in this country for American citizens. As compassionate as we wanna be, we can't take in everybody.\"\nWATCH: DEAN CAIN 'PROUD' TO BE AMONG THE 'PATRIOTS' WHO STEPPED UP TO JOIN ICE\nCain will be sworn in as an \"honorary ICE Officer\" in the coming month, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s spokesperson, said Thursday. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what his duties as an honorary officer would entail.\nCain told Fox News Digital he's just happy to be showing his support to the \"brave\" men and women tackling immigration issues in America.\nThe actor has his own opinions on how he wants to see the immigration system in America evolve.\n\"So, first of all, we can expand the number of people who come in. We have a million people who are allowed in every year. We could expand that number and change the criteria,\" he said.\nCain pointed out that America's current immigration system is full of \"weird programs,\" including a lottery, and praised President Donald Trump's $5 million gold card that streamlines American citizenship as a good option for the country.\nWATCH: DEAN CAIN SHARES WHAT HE WANTS TO SEE CHANGE IN IMMIGRATION POLICY\n\"I think merit is a huge part of it. What do you bring to the United States? How do you make this country better? What are you going to bring? What are you going to do? It's like that $5 million gold card or whatever that is that President Trump put through.\nLIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\"Those people will contribute to everybody, and that does flow to everybody. When that money is here in the United States and those jobs are here in the United States, that flows to everybody. So, I would like to see that open up, that meritocracy open up, and I would like to see a more streamlined process where it doesn't take someone seven years to come over legally,\" Cain said.\nCain noted that a major point in Trump's presidential campaign was immigration. He ran on deporting illegal immigrants, and Cain is pleased with how his administration has been handling the issue, but he would like to see legislation passed.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\"I'm very happy with what's going on in this administration. I'd like to see them fix the immigration situation. That would be great if someone introduced legislation to change our immigration system, to fix it. I would love to see that. I don't see that.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"All I hear is, I see people running away from Congress, getting on a plane so they don't have to vote, screaming at this, screaming at that, but not doing anything. So, I'd like to see some immigration reform take place,\" Cain said.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."
