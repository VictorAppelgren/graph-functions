  "description": "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser and Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan met with President Trump on Wednesday to discuss how to relinquish the government\u2019s grip over two housing giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, according to people familiar with the matter.",
  "content": "Citigroup (C) CEO Jane Fraser and Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan met with President Trump on Wednesday to discuss how to relinquish the government\u2019s grip over two housing giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe president has been inviting the chiefs of big Wall Street banks one by one recently to discuss what such a deal could look like, which would include an initial public offering (IPO), Bloomberg first reported last Thursday. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon also met with Trump for such discussions last week.\n\nSome of these discussions have revolved around how the banks value these organizations, how they think they could sell them, and how this wider privatization effort could be structured, according to one person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe over-the-counter shares of Freddie Mac (FMCC) and Fannie Mae (FNMA) both fell more than 3% Wednesday. They are up 101% and 147%, respectively, year to date.\n\nSpokespeople for the banks declined to comment.\n\nFannie and Freddie play integral roles in the US housing market by purchasing mortgages and repackaging them as securities. Both fell under government conservatorship during the 2008 financial crisis when mortgage defaults soared and the US Treasury Department injected over $180 billion into the mortgage lenders.\n\nA combined stock offering of these two mortgage giants could mean one of the world\u2019s largest public deals, which would result in a major payday for the stock underwriting desks of these big banks. The president vowed in late May to take the mortgage giants public in a post on Truth Social.\n\nHowever, pulling off such a move would be far from a simple feat.\n\nThe challenge with relinquishing the government\u2019s conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie is that turning these massive institutions into private businesses could drastically impact access to affordable credit in the housing market, which has steadily relied on these institutions to fund 30-year mortgages for over a decade.\n\nRead more: Best low- and no-down-payment mortgage lenders of 2025\n\nFor these reasons, Democratic politicians, civil rights organizations, and some housing experts have been critical of the effort.\n\n\"This could mean stricter lending requirements, higher interest rates, and even higher guarantee fees to reflect greater risk. This could mean higher costs for credit unions to sell these loans,\" Kelsey Nelson, federal regulatory compliance counsel for the credit union advocacy group America's Credit Unions, wrote in June.",

A down payment is the money you pay at loan closing to reduce the principal of your mortgage. Some loans call for a certain amount of cash upfront; others have no down payment requirement. However, the more money you put down, the lower your mortgage interest rate and monthly mortgage payment will likely be.\nHow much down payment do you need to buy a house?\nThe minimum down payment needed depends on the type of mortgage you\u2019re getting. A 20% down payment has been the traditional standard, and it's the minimum required to avoid paying private mortgage insurance (PMI) \u2014 an up-front and ongoing fee on conventional loans that protects the lender. However, loan programs have been launched in recent years that allow much lower down payments, from 0% to around 3%.\nAverage down payment on a house\nAccording to Realtor.com, in Q4 2024, the average down payment was 14.4%. This is lower than earlier in in the year but up from Q4 2023. The median down payment amount was $30,250. Keep in mind that these are national averages and medians, so the data may be different if you live in a lower- or high-cost-of-living area.\nZero-down-payment mortgage options\nThe holy grail of home loans: mortgages with 0% down payment. Yes, they do exist, and as you might imagine, they're quite popular. Two government loans are the primary 100% financing options: VA loans and USDA-backed mortgages.\nVA loans\nIt's the military benefit that has allowed generations of service members to buy a home. Backed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA loans usually require no down payment and put a cap on closing costs. There is a funding fee but no upfront or ongoing mortgage insurance. And while the VA has no minimum credit score, lenders do \u2014 and it varies from lender to lender.\nUSDA loans\nMortgages backed or issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA loans, are another 100% financing option. You don't have to be in a farming or ranching business, but the property has to be located in a rural or suburban area approved by the USDA. The loans are specifically designed to meet the housing needs of low- and moderate-income households.\nLow-down-payment mortgage options\nComing up with 20% down is a financial leap many first-time buyers just can't make. But something around 3% \u2014 now that's a hurdle worth taking a run at. Three low-down-payment programs are worth considering.\nFHA loans\nThe venerable FHA loan has been around for nearly a century. An initiative of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the FHA mortgage offers a down payment option as low as 3.5%. Your credit score can be as low as 580, though some lenders will set a higher limit.\n3%-down conventional loans\nA relative newcomer in the low down payment arena, the conventional loan requiring only 3% down is offered by two government-sponsored companies that provide financial backing to lenders. Known as Fannie Mae HomeReady and Freddie Mac Home Possible loans, the programs open the door for more mortgage makers to offer a low-down-payment option.\n1%-down programs\nA creative solution offered by just a few lenders, this loan wraps a 2% lender grant into a 3% down mortgage. The result: You pay 1% down. There may be loan limits or household income caps for these mortgages, but each lender offering such a loan will have its own eligibility requirements.\nHow to save for a down payment\nNo matter how much down payment you plan to make on buying a home, saving for a house is no easy feat. Besides the cash down, there are closing costs, perhaps an earnest money deposit \u2014 and even things as mundane as moving expenses. First, set a goal for how much you want to save, then automate money transfers to get it done.\nDown payment assistance programs\nYou may have heard of down payment assistance and wondered: Who is it for, and how does it work? The programs usually offer grants or forgivable loans and can be sponsored by local and state agencies. Eligibility may be determined by where you live, your income, and whether you are a first-time home buyer.\nUsing gift money for a down payment\nIn 2023, more than one-third of borrowers used gifts to help come up with the down payment. How does that work? Well, first, you have to hunt down a benevolent relative, friend, or charity. Different types of loans \u2014 such as conventional, FHA, and VA loans \u2014 have separate restrictions on who can donate the money to you and how it can be used.\nBest low- and no-down-payment mortgage lender FAQs\nWhat credit score is needed for a no-down-payment mortgage?\nThe minimum credit score required to qualify for no-money-down financing will depend on the type of loan you are getting and the lender. USDA loans with 100% financing may require a 580 score or higher. VA loans have no minimum credit score requirements, but lenders often call for a 620 FICO or better.\nWhich type of mortgage does not require a down payment?\nIf you want 100% financing, a VA loan is often the best option for qualified buyers. However, you'll need to be an active-duty servicemember or a veteran. You could also consider a USDA loan, which usually has no down payment requirement. To qualify, you must meet income restrictions and buy a house in a USDA-approved rural area.\nWhat is the lowest down payment for a mortgage?\nThe lowest down payment on a mortgage is 0%. For that, you must be eligible for a VA or USDA loan, which requires having a military affiliation \u2014 or a modest income and a property to buy in a rural and USDA-approved area. Some mortgage lenders also offer 1%-down conventional loans, which can be good deals if you don't qualify for a USDA or VA loan.\nIs it dumb to buy a house with no down payment?\nNo \u2014 buying a house with no down payment can help you get your foot in the door as a homeowner, start building equity, and maybe even land a lower interest rate if you get a VA or USDA loan. However, you should be aware of the cons. No down payment means your mortgage payments will be higher, and you\u2019ll start out with 0% equity in your home.\nMethodology:\nYahoo Finance reviews and scores mortgage lenders with quintile scoring in five primary categories: 1) Interest rates. Using 2024 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data from almost 5,000 mortgage companies, we score mortgage lenders on issued mortgage rates below or above the annual median of reporting lenders. 2) Affordability. A measure of loan product availability and the willingness of a lender to offer government-backed loans, low down payments, down payment assistance, and consideration of nontraditional credit. 3) Loan costs. HMDA data is again analyzed, and lenders are rated based on total loan costs compared to the annual median. 4) Rate transparency. The ability of a website user to obtain a mortgage interest rate estimate. We score lenders based on whether rates are enhanced with discount points or high credit score requirements, disclaimers revealing rate assumptions, sample advertised rates, and whether adjustable or no discount point rate estimates are available. 5) Online features. An analysis of the educational material, calculators, and additional resources available to users.\nReview of Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS) data on regulatory actions can trigger a penalty to the score of any lender with a consumer mortgage-related administrative or enforcement action within the past five years.\nAdvertisers or sponsorships do not influence ratings.\nEditorial disclosure for mortgages:\nThe information in this article has not been reviewed or approved by any advertiser.
