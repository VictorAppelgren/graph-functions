      "text": "As of Aug. 21, 2025, two stocks in the industrials sector could be flashing a real warning to investors who value momentum as a key criteria in their trading decisions.\nThe RSI is a momentum indicator, which compares a stock\u2019s strength on days when prices go up to its strength on days when prices go down. When compared to a stock\u2019s price action, it can give traders a better sense of how a stock may perform in the short term. An asset is typically considered overbought when the RSI is above 70, according to Benzinga Pro.\nHere's the latest list of major overbought players in this sector.\nGMS Inc GMS\n- On June 30, GMS announced it will be acquired by a Home Depot subsidiary for $5.5 billion. John J. Gavin, Chair of GMS, added, \u201cFollowing careful consideration of The Home Depot\u2019s proposal, along with other potential opportunities for the Company, our Board determined that this transaction is in the best interests of GMS and all of our shareholders. Not only does this outcome deliver significant and certain value to our shareholders, but it also has the added benefit of bringing GMS together with The Home Depot and SRS, where we are confident our employees will flourish, our customers and suppliers will benefit from our increased offerings and resources, and we will honor the legacy of our founders who made all of this possible.\u201d The company's stock jumped around 40% over the past six months and has a 52-week high of $110.28.\n- RSI Value: 71.6\n- GMS Price Action: Shares of GMS rose 0.1% to close at $109.54 on Wednesday.\n- Edge Stock Ratings: 82.64 Momentum score with Value at 0.77.\nBloom Energy Corp BE\n- On July 31, Bloom Energy posted better-tahn-expected quarterly earnings. KR Sridhar, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Bloom Energy said, \u201cAs onsite power becomes increasingly self-evident, given rapid AI growth, there has never been better market pull for the Bloom products. Unlike alternatives, our products are purpose-built for the digital revolution. I am delighted to engage with our direct hyperscale partner, Oracle, with whom we can collaborate to optimize the watts to flops ratio.\u201d The company's stock gained around 76% over the past month and has a 52-week high of $47.21.\n- RSI Value: 72.7\n- BE Price Action: Shares of Bloom Energy gained 3.3% to close at $44.51 on Wednesday.\nUnlock the rest of the BZ Edge Rankings and see how top stocks stack up.\nRead This Next:\nPhoto via Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "- A more conservative goal of $100 monthly dividend income would require 288 shares of Intuit.\n- An investor would need to own $1,008,174 worth of Intuit to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\n- Get the exact trades and sectors to target before August\u2019s biggest earnings-driven market moves. Details here \u2192\nIntuit Inc. INTU will release earnings results for the fourth quarter after the closing bell on Thursday, Aug. 21.\nAnalysts expect the Mountain View, California-based company to report quarterly earnings at $2.66 per share, up from $1.99 per share in the year-ago period. Intuit projects to report quarterly revenue of $3.75 billion, compared to $3.18 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\nWith the recent buzz around Intuit, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. As of now, Intuit offers an annual dividend yield of 0.60%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of $1.04 per share ($4.16 a year).\nSo, how can investors capitalize on its dividend yield to earn a regular $500 monthly?\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,008,174 or around 1,442 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $201,355 or around 288 shares.\nTo calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($4.16 in this case). So, $6,000 / $4.16 = 1,442 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $4.16 = 288 shares ($100 per month).\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nHow that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock\u2019s current price.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\nINTU Price Action: Shares of Intuit fell 0.3% to close at $699.15 on Wednesday.\nOn Aug. 15, Citigroup analyst Steven Enders maintained Intuit with a Buy and raised the price target from $789 to $815.\nRead More:\nImage: Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
