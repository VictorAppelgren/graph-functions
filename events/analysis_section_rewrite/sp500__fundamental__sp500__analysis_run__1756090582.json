      "feedback": "The draft has a coherent intuition but it falls short of a world-class, regime-driven, multi-year framework. Actionable edits: (1) drop or explicitly justify non‑relevant sources (BS3876D03 on radar/aircraft safety is not needed for a macro-capital framework); replace any placeholder citations like (ID: 4) with the actual IDs (PA57YBYVQ, W2622L6WW, 22PL3Q360) and harmonize numeric anchors drawn from those sources. (2) Establish a first-principles regime map: define invariant anchors (real policy rate differentials, terms of trade, productivity, BoP/net external position, and policy reaction functions) and articulate regimes (Baseline: Japan’s overseas asset-management push gains traction and global cross-border flows normalize; Upside: overseas AUM accelerates and ROIC/WACC spreads widen; Downside: reforms stall, ROIC compresses, cross-border fee growth stalls or reverses). (3) Build a formal transmission chain: regime shift → cross-border deal activity and overseas AUM growth → higher management-fee revenue and diversification of fee mix → ROIC relative to WACC improves or deteriorates → risk premium/price discipline in markets adjusts asset prices. Tie each link explicitly to numbers in PA57YBYVQ (overseas AUM ~20% of MUFG/AM One total; overseas deals are potential catalysts) and 22PL3Q360/W2622L6WW (Ford as cyclical proxy: 5.1% dividend yield, forward P/E around 10, Q2 EV losses ~$1.3B) to quantify rough sensitivity (e.g., base-case overseas AUM growth 3–5% annually; EV profitability path: return to breakeven in EV segment by mid-cycle). (4) Construct explicit scenarios with triggers and invalidation: Base case, Upside, and Downside; triggers include a successful sequence of overseas asset-management deals and ROIC>WACC realization; invalidation if MUFG AM/AM One fails to translate AUM growth into sustained fee income or if US/Europe market access tightens and ROIC remains below cost of capital. (5) Quantify the base case with clear numbers: overseas AUM ≈ $260B (20% of $1.3T), MUFG AM outside-Japan share trajectory, and Ford metrics (EV loss ~$1.3B in Q2; dividend yield ~5.1%; forward P/E ≈10) to anchor cyclical risk and income thesis; show how these feed into equity risk premia and credit/liquidity conditions under cross-border finance channels. (6) Strengthen the causal chain by naming catalysts/triggers and their time‑to‑impact: regulators’ reforms to position Japan as an asset-management hub; Nomura/MUFG/AM One/MIFID-style distribution expansion; the pace of EV profitability improvements for Ford or its peers; tariff/policy-inflation dynamics; (7) tighten ROIC/CF framework: compute ROIC vs. WACC for the capital-intensive overseas platforms, using real-world numbers where possible (e.g., ROIC discussion in ROIC articles, and MUFG/AM scale from PA57YBYVQ) and show what ROIC>WACC would imply for market pricing in a multi-year horizon. (8) Align length/style to SECTION FOCUS by delivering a clean base-case narrative first, followed by risks and watch items; present a concise, multi-year narrative rather than a single paragraph of narrative—then condense into the required compact summary with explicit regime labels. (9) Ensure numerical consistency across Ford references (consistently report Ford’s dividend yield around 5.1% and forward P/E near 10 from W2622L6WW/22PL3Q360) and cite them at each data point. (10) Finally, recast the conclusion into a crisp, forward‑looking verdict: base case underpinned by regime anchors; enumerate the principal risks (tariff shocks, EV profitability path, execution risk in Japan’s expansion); specify what to watch (cadence of overseas deals, AUM growth, ROIC/WACC convergence, Ford’s EV economics); and attach a calibrated confidence level. This will elevate depth, causal coherence, and quantitative discipline to world-class standards.",
