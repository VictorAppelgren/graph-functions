      "summary": "Hormel Foods reported Q2 revenue of $3.03 billion, up 4.6% YoY and beating estimates, but its non‑GAAP EPS of $0.35 fell 15% short of expectations and its Q3 revenue guidance of $3.2 billion is below analyst forecasts. Operating margin stayed at 7.9% while free‑cash‑flow margin dropped to 2.8% from 5.3% a year earlier, and sales volumes rose 2.7% YoY after a recent decline. Management has lowered full‑year EPS guidance to $1.44 and emphasized a need to restore profitable growth amid weak demand and low pricing power. Analysts remain cautious, citing declining sales, modest margins, and a lack of compelling growth prospects, suggesting better investment opportunities may exist elsewhere.",
