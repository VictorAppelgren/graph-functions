  "translation": "Madrid, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Spanish football could finally cross the Atlantic, after the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) approved a request so that Barcelona and Villarreal play their December LaLiga match in Miami, a measure that has been taking almost a decade.\n\nThe Board of Directors of the RFEF gave the green light on Monday that the game of the 17th day is played at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami on December 20, in the first step for the competition to play an official party abroad abroad for the first time in its history.\n\nThe proposal is now addressed to the governing body of European football, UEFA, before requiring the final approval of FIFA, the last obstacle in the American dream of the president of LaLiga, Javier Tebas.\n\n\"At its meeting of August 11, 2025, the RFEF Board of Directors has known the application of Villarreal CF and FC Barcelona clubs to hold the game of First Division Day in the United States,\" said the RFEF in a statement.\n\n\"... The Royal Spanish Football Federation will elevate UEFA the petition for the start of the procedures for the subsequent authorization for the FIFA of the game dispute at the 'Hard Rock Stadium' stadium in Miami on December 20, 2025,\" he added.\n\nLaLiga has been chasing its transatlantic vision for almost a decade, emulating the strategy used by the NFL and the NBA to establish themselves in other markets.\n\nThebas's first attempt came in the 2018-19 season with a Girona-Bar\u00e7a party proposal in the United States that never materialized. A Villarreal-Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid also failed for the 2019-20, which ended in the courts after the denial of authorization by the RFEF.\n\nThe courts were right to the Federation, then under the command of Luis Rubiales, which was dismissed in 2023 for kissing the player Jenni Hermoso celebrating the victory of Spain in the Sydney Women's World Cup.\n\nLast season a Barcelona-Atl\u00e9tico was about to be held, but LaLiga backed down at the last moment to better structure the project.\n\nNow, once the regulatory barriers are clear and internal conflicts, the Villarreal-Bar\u00e7a seems to be about to finally bring the long-awaited American adventure of Spanish football.",

      "text": "The Trust Principles\nThomson Reuters is dedicated to upholding the Trust Principles and to preserving its independence, integrity, and freedom from bias in the gathering and dissemination of information and news.\nTrust Principles \u2013 the history\nThe Trust Principles were created in 1941, in the midst of World War II, in agreement with The Newspaper Proprietors Association Limited and The Press Association Limited (being the Reuters shareholders at that time). The Trust Principles imposed obligations on Reuters and its employees to act at all times with integrity, independence, and freedom from bias.\nReuters Directors and shareholders were determined to protect and preserve the Trust Principles when Reuters became a publicly traded company on the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. A unique structure was put in place to achieve this. A new company was formed and given the name 'Reuters Founders Share Company Limited', its purpose being to hold a 'Founders Share' in Reuters.\nThe legal structure has evolved over time and the Founders Share and other contractual arrangements now confer a number of special rights upon the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company. For example, (i) the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company has enhanced voting rights in circumstances where someone is seeking to obtain a significant shareholding in, or acquire control of, Thomson Reuters and (ii) the prior consent of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company must be sought prior to undertaking any sale of, or other material transaction involving, the Reuters news business unit.\nThomson Reuters itself is obliged and committed to apply the Trust Principles to its operations. The charter documents of Thomson Reuters Corporation include provisions to safeguard the Trust Principles as they apply to the Thomson Reuters business and require Thomson Reuters Directors, in the performance of their duties, to have due regard to the Trust Principles, by the proper exercise of their powers and in accordance with their other duties as Directors.\nThe Trust Principles are:\n- That Reuters shall at no time pass into the hands of any one interest, group, or faction;\n- That the integrity, independence, and freedom from bias of Thomson Reuters shall at all times be fully preserved;\n- That Reuters shall supply unbiased and reliable news services to newspapers, news agencies, broadcasters, and other media subscribers and to businesses, governments, institutions, individuals, and others with whom Reuters has or may have contracts;\n- That Thomson Reuters shall pay due regard to the many interests which it serves in addition to those of the media; and\n- That no effort shall be spared to expand, develop, and adapt the news and other services and products of Thomson Reuters so as to maintain its leading position in the international news and information business\nThomson Reuters Founders Share Company was established in 1984 when Reuters became a public company. The directors of Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company (known as \u2018Trustees\u2019) have a duty to ensure, to the extent possible, that the Trust Principles are complied with.\nThe Trustees are experienced and eminent people from diverse arenas in politics, diplomacy, media, public service and business. The Trustees are selected by a nomination committee and proposed to the board of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company for appointment. The nomination committee assists in scrutinizing candidates\u2019 suitability and its members include two persons appointed by the chairman after consultation with the European Court of Human Rights and representatives of certain press associations. The Thomson Reuters Corporation board has two representatives on the nomination committee. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company Board are members of the nomination committee, and the Chairman appoints three other directors of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company as members of the nomination committee. The Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company acts as chairman of the nomination committee.\nThe number of Trustees has to be at least 14 and not more than 18. Trustees have a minimum of two meetings per year, and receive reports on our activities in the different fields in which we operate (including Reuters news). The Trustees meet with both the Thomson Reuters Board and representatives of senior management. Through Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company's Chairman, regular contact is maintained with our company. The relationship is one of trust and confidence.\nIndependence of Thomson Reuters\nCustomers across the world depend on us to provide them with reliable and objective news and information.\nThis means that we have a special need to safeguard our independence and integrity and avoid any bias which may stem from control by specific individuals or interests.\nThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles were adopted in 1941 and include the preservation of integrity, reliability of news, development of the news business, and related principles.\nToday, the Trust Principles are fundamental to our entire business.\nMore information\nContact us\nBrian Moss\nFor inquiries pertaining to Reuters reporting standards and the Trust Principles please email: brian.moss@thomsonreuters.com."
