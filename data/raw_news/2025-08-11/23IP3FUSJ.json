  "description": "Key Insights Significant control over Aurelia Metals by individual investors implies that the general public has more...",
  "content": "\u2022 Significant control over Aurelia Metals by individual investors implies that the general public has more power to influence management and governance-related decisions\n\u2022 44% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Aurelia Metals Limited (ASX:AMI), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are individual investors with 56% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nIndividual insiders, on the other hand, account for 24% of the company's stockholders. Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies, and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Aurelia Metals, beginning with the chart below.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Aurelia Metals\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Aurelia Metals?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Aurelia Metals. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Aurelia Metals' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nWe note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Aurelia Metals. Franklyn Brazil is currently the largest shareholder, with 20% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 5.3% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 3.1% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.",

The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling.
