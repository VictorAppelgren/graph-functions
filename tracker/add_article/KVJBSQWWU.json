The rally was supported by analyst Ming‑Chi Kuo’s upgraded iPhone Fold shipment outlook and reports of increased automation in Apple’s supply chain. While the gain reflects positive sentiment, it is unlikely to materially alter Apple’s long‑term fundamentals, which remain driven by its services segment and ongoing AI investments.",
