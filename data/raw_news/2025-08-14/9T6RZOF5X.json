  "title": "George Lucas Reminded Ron Howard Ahead of 'Solo' That 'Star Wars' Is for 12-Year-Olds",
  "description": "Howard shared some memories of being brought in as a replacement director for 2018's 'Solo: A Star Wars Story.'",
  "content": "Howard shared some memories of being brought in as a replacement director for 2018's 'Solo: A Star Wars Story.'\n\nStar Wars fans have become accustomed to cinematic reshufflings in the years since 2019\u2019s The Rise of Skywalker. But even before the sequel trilogy concluded, there were hints that Lucasfilm\u2019s confident plans were subject to shake-ups. There were the notorious reshoots attached to 2016\u2019s Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, but even more dramatically, there was the director switcheroo that happened with 2018\u2019s Solo: A Star Wars Story. In a new interview, Ron Howard talked about being hired as a replacement on the film.\n\nSpeaking to Vulture in a piece that examines his long career, he said it all happened sort of casually. Howard didn\u2019t have a next project set up yet; in fact, he was on vacation when Lucasfilm\u2019s Kathleen Kennedy invited him \u201cto breakfast\u201d with Solo co-writer Jonathan Kasdan and co-producer Allison Shearmur. There was a motive to this meal, he recalled.\n\n\u201cThey basically said, \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a creative impasse with [Phil] Lord and [Christopher] Miller. Would you ever consider coming in?\u201d\n\nThe next step, Howard said, involved watching some of the edited footage from Solo. \u201cI saw what was bothering them. There was a studio that liked the script the way it was and wanted a Star Wars movie, but there was a disconnect early on tonally, and they weren\u2019t convinced that what Phil and Chris were doing was working effectively,\u201d Howard said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t judge that because I didn\u2019t see enough of it to know. But they were sure.\u201d\n\nWhen Howard agreed to come aboard, he said, \u201cPhil and Chris were incredibly gracious throughout that process. They were just seeing two different movies. So I came in, I had a blast, but there\u2019s nothing personal about that film whatsoever. It\u2019s still just a shame. I can\u2019t wait for Phil and Chris\u2019s next movie.\u201d\n\nHoward also revealed he chatted with his pal George Lucas while he was still mulling over the gig and got some telling advice: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t active on the films, but he said, \u201cJust don\u2019t forget\u2014it\u2019s for 12-year-old boys.\u201d\n\nHead to Vulture to read the full interview, including a section where Howard said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t do a slasher movie\u201d but is open to bringing more supernatural elements into his filmography, preferably in the form of a \u201ccontemporary sci-fi fantasy, like Cocoon or Her or The Shape of Water.\u201d",

      "text": "When talking about his time in Star Wars, Rian Johnson often says that he\u2019d like to return to that world one day, at least once he stops making murder-mystery movies and TV shows. But while fans continue to hope he\u2019ll make that once-planned trilogy one day, others can\u2019t quite get past the seeming disappointments contained in his franchise entry, The Last Jedi. In a new interview, Johnson recalls what he was told when he came aboard the Lucasfilm project.\nSpeaking to Rolling Stone, Johnson addressed the notion that he and J.J. Abrams\u2014who made the first and third films in the sequel trilogy, The Force Awakens and The Rise of Skywalker\u2014didn\u2019t communicate enough about their 2015 and 2017 Star Wars films, leading to a disjointed feeling between the two.\nThat\u2019s not the case, Johnson said. \u201cWe met and I spent days with him and was able to get into his head and all the choices he had made. That having been said, I communicated and I went and made the movie. And he was in the middle of Force Awakens. Ultimately, I feel like the choices in it, none of them were born out of an intent to \u2018undo\u2019 anything. They were all [born] out of the opposite intent of, how do I take this story that J.J. wrote, that I really loved, and these characters he created that I really loved, and take them to the next step?\u201d\nAn authority stepped in for some guidance at this point, Johnson said. \u201cKathy [Kennedy, the president of Lucasfilm] said, \u2018We\u2019re looking at someone to do the Empire [Strikes Back] of this series.\u2019 I took that assignment very seriously. Maybe more seriously than someone would have liked. I guess to me that didn\u2019t mean making something that just had nods to Empire\u2014that meant trying to genuinely do what Empire did.\u201d\nWhether or not Johnson\u2019s interpretation of Empire pleased fans (some people don\u2019t mind The Last Jedi!), it\u2019s clear that coming into the franchise to make the middle film in the series was no easy task. That became even tougher when Johnson tried to put his own stamp on the story so far\u2014including, as Rolling Stone uses as an example, doing away with Snoke, the big bad set up with much fanfare in The Force Awakens. Turns out Johnson just thought Kylo Ren was a \u201cmore compelling and complicated villain.\u201d\n\u201cTo me, I didn\u2019t easily dispense with Snoke. I took great pains to use him in the most dramatically impactful way I could, which was to then take Kylo\u2019s character to the next level and set him up as well as I possibly could. I guess it all comes down to your point of view.\u201d\nAnd really, what would Star Wars be without heated fan debates over the choices made, on-screen and off?\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "Guten tag, my\u2026 uh\u2026 gang, I guess? Please enjoy a bit of \u201cPostal Apocalypse\u201d calm before the storm of San Diego Comic-Con! This week: Disney\u2019s Star Wars problem, whether Secret Empire will come to the MCU, and how to show someone you love something that\u2019s become problematic over time. Also, I, uh, write a Transformers movie.\nA Solo Low\nTim M.:\nI have a bad feeling about this\u2026 thing being Ron Howard directing the Han Solo movie. It\u2019s been a long time since he made Willow.\nYour question is actually a two-parter: 1) Will Ron Howard direct a crappy Han Solo movie? And 2) is Disney\u2019s switch from Lord and Miller to a much less\u2026 distinct filmmaker emblematic of future issues with the Star Wars films?\nLook, whether Han Solo is good or not, it won\u2019t be because of Ron Howard. He wasn\u2019t hired for his brilliant, distinctive style, but rather because Disney thought Lord and Miller had too much style, and their goals for the movie were what Disney considered \u201coff-brand\u201d for their vision of the Star Wars movie franchise. Meanwhile, Howard doesn\u2019t really have a distinctive style of filmmaking, not even in his Apollo 13 glory days.\nSo Ron Howard\u2019s direction of Han Solo will be fine, which I mean more as \u201cacceptable\u201d than \u201cactively good.\u201d He\u2019s not going to do anything crazy or shocking with it, which is just what Disney wants. So the film will live and die by Alden Ehrenreich\u2019s performance (which, hoo boy) and the script, which was written by The Empire Strikes Back\u2019s Lawrence Kasdan and his son Jake, so that should be good. Plus, they\u2019re on set supervising the production; if you were worried that Howard wouldn\u2019t necessarily have the mindset for putting the fantasy of the Star Wars universe on screen, they\u2019ll be there to help.\nI think Han Solo will be good but not great, but again, that\u2019s essentially what Disney wants. They don\u2019t particularly want to take risks with the franchise, they don\u2019t want to try something new (which is why both standalone movies, and probably the third as well, are prequels to the original trilogy set long after the prequel trilogy).\nAnd there\u2019s your answer to the second question, that Disney is so focused on making \u201csafe\u201d Star Wars films that the chances of them making a great one are incredibly low. A slew of good but not great films may sound good to you, but the more homogenized the movies get, the less good they\u2019ll become, as they grow staler and more boring. Eventually, that will lead to less people seeing the films, which will lead to less profits, which means Disney will have to make some decisions.\nSo it\u2019s a small problem now, but it\u2019s eventually going to become a big problem. Honestly, at the moment, I\u2019m way more worried about Mark Hamill\u2019s problems with Luke Skywalker in The Last Jedi than anything else.\nAging and Enlightenment\nGary O.:\nGreetings! Long time reader, first time time-bending-writer!\nSo, some beloved and generally great movies have really bizarre, horrible moments hidden in them \u2013 many of which usually involve some outdated misogyny / racism / homophobia / etc., especially if it\u2019s an older film. My question is:\nAssuming the movie isn\u2019t completely ruined by these glaring problems, what do I do when I want to share it with friends / romantic interests / the peoples I love and care about, most of whom are socially aware and damned vocal about it.\nLike, do I try to sell them with a \u201cHey, so one of my favorite movies when I was a youngun was Once Bitten, starring super young Jim Carrey in a stupid but charming \u201880s vampire comedy! But\u2026 it\u2019s kind of got a bunch of homophobic parts in it, which is obviously bad, so\u2026 you\u2019ve been warned, but I swear you should watch it because reasons!\u201d\nOr do I wait until the offense(s) occur(s), and then cringe and hope they wait until the end to mention it / they aren\u2019t too offended immediately? Or let the movie get paused so we can discuss the problem in it, derailing the movie night forever?\nWhat say ye, wise one?\nBefore, always before. It\u2019s not like being surprised by a bad scene makes it any more palatable, and you run the risk of your companion accidentally believing you don\u2019t see the problems (or worse, that you endorse the horribleness onscreen).\nIf you find yourself having to give someone a large pile of warnings about a certain elder work of art, well, that\u2019s a very clear sign that it\u2019s almost certainly too problematic to show somebody. You may love it dearly, but if the chances of the other person are going to dislike it are that great, why risk it? If they\u2019re invariably going to hate it, what\u2019s the point of showing it to them? Why make them endure it when the end result is you being extremely disappointed that they don\u2019t share your affection?\nEven beyond media that has become problematic through years of social awareness and basic decency, I\u2019ve shown plenty of loved ones movies, shows, and books because of how much I personally love them, without worrying about whether my loved one will like them. IT\u2019S NOT WORTH IT. AT BEST ONE OR BOTH OF YOU WILL BE IRRITATED, UPSET, OR EXTREMELY BORED. FROM ONE WHO KNOWS.\nIn Which I Write a Transformers Movie\nRobot Jox:\nDear Mr. Postman,\nNobody doubts that Michael Bay\u2019s \u201cTransformers\u201d movies make a ton of money at the box office. But let\u2019s say Bay himself has Donald Trump-levels of the skin. Specifically, he has a hissy fit any time a certain post-Apocalyptic postman makes fun of his newest Autobot clash.\nSo let\u2019s say Bay uses some of his millions of \u201cTransformers\u201d payday money to shoot a time-message into your post-Apocalyptic future. Leaving out all the curse words (io9 is a family-friendly site), Bay challenges you to put up or shut up. Basically, the \u201cTransformers\u201d director challenges you to come up with a \u201cTransformers\u201d idea that you could declare \u201cHell yeah, I\u2019d watch that!\u201d How would you respond?\nI appreciate your thinking that if my FAQs somehow finally appeared on his radar, Michael Bay would challenge me to come up with a better story and not just tie me to pile of explosives and film the detonation in slow-motion.\nI\u2019ll be fully honest and admit I\u2019m no fiction writer. It\u2019s hard for me to think up characters and dialogue and plot beats, although that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t easy for me to say when they\u2019re terrible. But saying \u201cI would write a Transformers film where the story makes A LICK OF SENSE\u201d feels like cheating.\nSo I\u2019d begin just like the \u201880s series\u2014not out of pure nostalgia, but because it was so damn efficient. The Decepticons have all but won the war on Cybertron, and some of the last remaining Autobots make a desperate attempt to escape into space. Megatron and his minions follow them and attack, wrecking both their ships, and they all crash land on Earth. Eons pass, and the ship is eventually obscured by dirt, rock, and time.\nEventually a young but not immensely annoying Spike Witwicky stumbles upon a cave that ends up leading to the ship\u2019s interior. An accidental button press turns the ship back on, and it revives the Autobots. With Spike there to explain some Earth basics, Optimus quickly realizes humans would be freaked out to see large alien robots among them, and orders the Autobots to use their natural ability to transform to disguise themselves as Earth vehicles as they explore the planet and hopefully discover where the Decepticons landed.\nExcept! The Decepticons have been awake and hiding themselves already! (It\u2019s later revealed that Decepticon emissary Soundwave, after searching for them for eons, discovered the ship and revived them.) They\u2019ve been waiting to see if the Autobots would show up. They follow their foes outside of the city and launch a surprise assault. There\u2019s a big awesome battle involving robots who are visually unique and have actual personalities, and there are no humans involved other than perhaps a few astounded bystanders. After Optimus and Megatron inevitably wound each other, both sides leave to fight another day.\nAh, but an Autobot scientist\u2014maybe Perceptor? But he doesn\u2019t turn into a tiny microscope?\u2014figures out how to monitor the Decepticons\u2019 transmissions to Cybertron, where they learn Earth\u2019s natural energy\u2014solar power, wind power, water power, etc.\u2014is especially potent for Transformers, and thus Cybertron. If the Decepticons can figure a way to harness it and get it home, the Autobots will absolutely be annihilated\nOf course the Decepticons do figure out a way (Energon cubes!) which of course causes a great deal of destruction to create and process. So the Autobots have to stop the Decepticons, but are faced with the dilemma of whether they should take the Energon themselves, endangering an alien planet and its inhabitants, to fight their own war.\nShocker! The Autobots decide to protect Earth and then hopefully find another way. They track the Decepticons to Hoover Dam and attack. Yes, I know Hoover Dam was briefly featured in the first live-action movie, but that was a meaningless setting to reintroduce Megatron and then immediately move the big fight to a city; I mean this more like the Sherman Dam scene in the very first animated Transformers miniseries (that\u2019s it above), where the Autobots and Decepticons had a pitched battle and Optimus and Megatron dueled on top of the dam. Honestly, I\u2019m not trying to just pour love on the original cartoon, so I don\u2019t actually care about the setting. What I love about the scene is that the duel really showed how personal the stakes were for the two leaders, and how closely their identities were tied to each other.\nEssentially, I want a movie that actually makes the Transformers the stars, gives them a reason for fighting that isn\u2019t just a random doohickey every single time, and yes, has a plot that is at least coherent. Perchance to dream, my friends.\nPlan of Steel\nRon T.:\nDear Postal Survivor of the Apocalypse, after seeing Wonder Woman, and re-watching the upcoming Justice League trailer, I\u2019m wondering: were the Snyder Superman movies deliberately bad? As in, maybe Man of Steel set us up with an unsympathetic, mass-killer Superman deliberately, so that no one would care that he was killed off in Batman v Superman.\nNow that he\u2019s gone, Justice League movies can be more interesting. Let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s always hard to find a challenge that\u2019s the right level of difficulty for Superman without resorting to options that nerf him, and it\u2019d be harder to find a right-sized challenge for the entire Justice League if Superman\u2019s with them. Also, Wonder Woman can take his place.\nWhat do you think? Was Supes killed off as part of a long-term plan to let Wonder Woman finally take her rightful place as the most bad-ass of the JL bad-asses?\nOh, wouldn\u2019t that be delightful? I mean, it\u2019s so untrue I\u2019m actually in pain writing this response, but it would certainly be delightful.\nWarner Bros. had no idea the Wonder Woman movie would be a success until it was released and made an invisible jet-full of money. After all, it starred a female woman who was a superhero yet bizarrely not a man, a concept so bewildering that it took until 2017 for a studio to try it. Given the worries WB seems to have about its DC films generally\u2014the constant announcing and shelving of films, all that mucking about with Suicide Squad, the many Justice League reshoots\u2014there\u2019s just no way anyone there could have been counting on Wonder Woman being a smash hit.\nEven if WB had been all-in on WW from the beginning, Superman was ignoring civilian casualties way back in 2011, when Zack Snyder started filming it. It\u2019s unknown when Allan Heinberg turned in his script for the film, but come on: Do you really think anyone at the studio had the foresight to actually plan Wonder Woman\u2019s ascendancy six full years ago? Me neither.\nAs for your point about Superman\u2019s absence making Justice League more interesting, it\u2019s really just the latest example of a decades-long problem with Superman, which is that too many writers can\u2019t figure out a way to use him in a Justice League story. He\u2019s so powerful he should be able to defeat any problem the writer can come up, so the writer\u2019s solution is to somehow incapacitate Superman until the final scene, at which point he shows up and saves the day.\nThis is by all accounts what\u2019s happening in Justice League, by the way, which makes sense in as much Superman starts the movie dead, and is rumored to be staying dead\u2014or, rather, unavailable\u2014until the final act. But this has nothing to do with giving Wonder Woman the spotlight as much as it does giving everyone who isn\u2019t Superman a bit of the spotlight.\nSome Secrets Should Never Be Told\nNick:\nHey Postman, gonna keep this one short and sweet: Do you think they\u2019d ever do Secret Empire in the MCU?\nNo, thank god. Between the comics\u2019 extremely controversial plot, the outcry it caused, and its general grossness, there\u2019s no way Marvel Studios would chance the PR shitstorm it would create by choosing to adapt it. Kevin Feige is not a dumb guy, and there are dozens of great, non-toxic Cap stories for the movies to adapt before taking an enormous risk on Secret Empire. And even if Feige had some kind of horrible brain lesion that made him think it was a good idea, I am fully confident his bosses at Disney proper would say, \u201cYou want to make who a Nazi? Hahaha wait you aren\u2019t joking okay you\u2019re fired.\u201d\nThere\u2019s also my sneaking suspicion that Chris Evans will leave the role sooner rather than later, which means Bucky or Falcon would take over the mantle. Turning either one of them into pure evil doesn\u2019t have anything close to the narrative impact of Steve Rogers\u2019 heel turn, which is about the only non-awful thing you can say about the storyline.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U39SOkkQoA4\nUncooly\nJames the Librarian:\nHowdy and greetings Postman! With the announcement this week that the long-rumored FLCL sequels are finally coming to pass next year, I\u2019m at odds with myself.\nI\u2019m really excited for there to be MORE within the universe, but at the same time the original story is about Naota growing up and so much of the symbolism and subtext is directly related to his coming-of-age.\nIt appears that now Naota is grown up and Haruko is back for\u2026 some undisclosed reason. But you can\u2019t just take the characters and add in some Pillows tracks and capture the same feeling and emotion the OVA had.\nSo what\u2019s your overunder on this being good? I\u2019m extremely skeptical (and not just because the FLCL t-shirts I bought back in 2004 and 2005 are fitting less well than they did a decade ago), but at the same time\u2026 I\u2019m excited because it\u2019s MORE FLCL!\nI\u2019ll give it a five percent chance as being as great as the original, a 10 percent chance of being pretty good, a wildly optimistic 35 percent chance of being merely okay, and a full 50 percent chance of being bad to soul-crushingly awful.\nFLCL was lightning in a bottle. It was an intensely personal project from a single director who is now only producing, made by an idiosyncratic studio at the top of their game, made without the expectation or burden of being a major success. It also had a story\u2014Naota\u2019s coming-of-age\u2014that pretty much precludes a sequel. About the only story I can think of that would be thematically match the original would be if Haruko returns to similarly guide Naota into true adulthood, but that is absolutely not a story most FLCL fans are going to want to see, and that\u2019s assuming the studio managed to recapture the artistry of the original.\nI\u2019d love to be proven wrong, but I don\u2019t expect to be. At least the soundtrack by the Pillows will still be great, though.\nDisagree to Agree\nJonah B:\nDear postman, I\u2019m going to say up front that I really enjoyed Spider-man: Homecoming. It was a fun summer movie, though not genre shaking, and I loved seeing a Spider-man who was terrible at being a superhero. I also, however, wasn\u2019t that impressed with Vulture, nor was I surprised by the shocking reveal of who he actually is. To me, I felt like having a villain who has making money as his main motivation is a bit boring. I ultimately felt like Michael Keaton was wasted, other than the scene in the car where he seemed like a genuine threat.\nNow this didn\u2019t take away from my enjoyment of the movie. However, I expressed these views in the comments section here at io9 on a spider-post, and immediately got a bunch of spider-hate back. Essentially, I was told that my opinion was flat out wrong (despite it being an opinion) as though there was only one right response. This is a long winded way of getting to my question: why is it so hard for people to accept opinions other than their own about movies, books, etc? Why can\u2019t they be like \u201cI disagree with you and here\u2019s why, but your opinion is also legitimate?\u201d\nIt\u2019s the same reason people do it in real life. When you present an opinion that differs from theirs, many\u2014too many\u2014people feel attacked, as if you\u2019re somehow saying, \u201cI\u2019m right and you\u2019re dumb.\u201d So they attack your opinion, either to strike first or because they\u2019ve mistakenly assumed you were insulting them. The fact that many people, when announcing their opinion, are actually preemptively insulting anyone who disagrees with them only exacerbates people\u2019s sensitivity to any and all aggression, real or perceived. I wish I had a solution, but I don\u2019t; you can\u2019t convince someone to be confident enough in their own opinions to not feel the need to attack yours.\nAnd for the record, the fact that the Vulture is Liz the Love Interest\u2019s father did not impress me, given that both of the inaugural Spider-Man movies have hinged on the bad guy being suddenly revealed to have an immensely close relationship to someone Peter cares about. To me, it\u2019s the Norman Osborn/Harry Osborn/Green Goblin reveal again. However, I do welcome dissenting opinions in the comments below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2r9-RcKSSDM\nAvoid the Droid\nAdam P.:\nGiven the countless number of times he\u2019s saved the day, is R2-D2 a Jedi? Can droids even be Jedis?\nI know that General Grievous trained in the Jedi arts but he clearly wasn\u2019t one. And I think he was technically a cyborg\u2026\nThe Force is in all living things, but a droid has nothing living inside it. It may have a personality and incredible individuality and what seems to be for all intents and purposes a soul, but it\u2019s the fleshy bits that have access to the Force. R2-D2 is just very good at what he does, and what he does is everything, with a specialty in murdering droids he doesn\u2019t like.\nLike Vader, Grevious was a cyborg, meaning he had a bunch of fleshy bits augmented by mechanical and robot parts. This is what allowed Vader to keep channeling the Force after having been toasted on Mustafar. The same deal would apply to Grevious\u2014he would technically be able to use the Force if he had the ability, but he didn\u2019t have the ability to use it (there are no scenes in Revenge of the Sith or Clone Wars that show him using any Force powers). He was just really good at lightsaber combat, which doesn\u2019t require using the Force, although it certainly helps. But it turns out having four cyborg arms that can all hold lightsabers and attack simultaneously is arguably even more of an advantage.\nThere\u2019s almost no chance in hell that a \u201cPostal Apocalypse\u201d will arrive next week during San Diego Comic-Con, so your emotionally withdrawn post-apocalyptic fake mailman will see you on July 27. In the interim! Send me those burning questions, nagging mysteries, desperate pleas for advice, and everything else to [email protected]. See you soon!"

      "text": "The DC Extended Universe is finally giving Marvel a run for its money\u2014something that\u2019s bound to increase now that James Gunn is running the show. The DCEU\u2019s myriad projects stretch far beyond superhero mainstays Batman, Superman, and the Justice League, promising to include new and interesting takes on DC Comics\u2019 enormous stable of characters.\nWhat follows is an up-to-date list of everything DCEU-related that\u2019s on the way: DC movies heading to theaters, as well as DC streaming movies and shows coming to Max.\nLast updated 8/23/2023.\nWhat\u2019s the next DC Movie?\nAquaman and the Lost Kingdom\nRelease date: December 20 (in theaters)\nDirector James Wan returns for the next adventure following Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) as the newly crowned King of Atlantis. Now in his new role, Arthur will explore more of the world under the sea while also dealing with new threats from Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and others. Like Shazam 2, Aquaman 2 has endured its share of release-date changes, with its new Christmas 2023 date designed to give Wan and company ample time to complete all the necessary special effects.\nUpcoming DC Movie Release Dates\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\nRelease date: October 4, 2024 (in theaters)\nTodd Phillips never saw his Joker movie as anything but a singular film. But over a billion dollars at the box office and an Oscar for Best Actor (for star Joaquin Phoenix) obviously changed things. We have a few nuggets of info so far: the title is Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux(French for \u201cshared madness\u201d), Phoenix is returning and will co-star with Lady Gaga (who\u2019s playing Harley Quinn), Zazie Beetz is probably returning as Arthur Fleck\u2019s neighbor, and\u2026 it\u2019s likely going to be a musical? Filming wrapped in early April 2023.\nThe Batman 2\nRelease date: 2025 (in theaters)\nHot off the success of Matt Reeves\u2019 long-awaitedThe Batman, everyone involved made it clear that wasn\u2019t a one-and-done. Robert Pattinson\u2019s Batman will be back. Will he face off with the Joker? It\u2019s possible but not definitive. You\u2019d imagine the Penguin and Catwoman could be back too. We don\u2019t know much yet about this one, but we do know it won\u2019t be arriving until 2025.\nCurrent DC Shows\nDoom Patrol Season 4, Part 2\nRelease date: TBD 2023 (on Max)\nThe fourth and final season of Doom Patrol\u2014starring Brendan Fraser, Matt Bomer, Diane Guerrero, April Bowlby, Joivan Wade, Timothy Dalton, Skye Roberts, and Michelle Gomez\u2014already aired its first batch of episodes; the remaining six will return later this year.\nUpcoming DC Movies and Shows Without Release Dates\nThe Penguin\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nYou saw him in The Batman and now, Colin Farrell\u2019s Penguin is getting his own Max series. As of April 2023, the show is in production, with a cast that also includes Cristin Milioti, Rhenzy Feliz, Michael Kelly, Shohreh Aghdashloo, and Deirdre O\u2019Connell, with Clancy Brown and Michael Zegen recurring.\nPeacemaker Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nFrom the instant that opening credits scene rolled for the first time, DC fans and non-fans alike fell in love with Peacemaker. Well, he\u2019s coming back, still played by John Cena and still from the twisted mind of James Gunn. There\u2019s no word on when it\u2019ll happen but we\u2019re guessing 2024.\nSuperman: Legacy\nRelease date: July 11, 2025\nJames Gunn will write and direct this Superman movie, which is touted as not being an origin story. Casting announcements started with Clark Kent/Superman and Lois Lane, who\u2019ll be played by David Corenswet and Rachel Brosnahan. We also know Isabela Merced will play Hawkgirl, Edi Gathegi is Mister Terrific, and Nathan Fillion is a Green Lantern (Guy Gardner), as well as Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho.\nMore Upcoming DC Movies and Shows Announced for the Gunn/Safran Era\nThe shake-up at DC Studios got a huge zap of energy at the end of January, when James Gunn and Peter Safran announced their massive slate of planned projects. Little is known about most of these projects so far in terms of cast and crew and even release dates\u2014but we do have a few tidbits for each.\nCreature Commandos (An animated Max show) \u2013 A seven-episode animated series written by James Gunn himself. It stars Indira Varma (Obi-Wan Kenobi, Game of Thrones) as the Bride, who\u2019s the lead character, and Marvel veteran Frank Grillo as Rick Flagg Sr.\u2014father of Rick Flagg, played by Joel Kinnaman in The Suicide Squad. The rest of the cast includes David Harbour (Stranger Things) as Eric Frankenstein, Sean Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) as G.I. Robot, Zoe Chao (The Afterparty) as Nina Mazursky, Alan Tudyk (Star Wars: Rogue One) as Dr. Phosphorus, Maria Bakalova (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) as new character Princess Ilana Rostovic, and Peacemaker\u2019s Steve Agee and Sean Gunn returning as John Economos and Weasel, respectively.\nWaller (A live-action Max show) \u2013 Viola Davis will reprise her Suicide Squad character; the story will bring back characters from the Peacemaker show and tell a story with events set between Peacemaker seasons one and two.\nLanterns (A live-action Max show) \u2013 Set on Earth, this mystery series will follow Hal Jordan and John Stewart doing their thing as DC\u2019s \u201csuper cops.\u201d\nThe Authority (Theatrical film) \u2013 The Wildstorm superhero characters will make their big-screen debut in a film co-written by Gunn.\nParadise Lost (A live-action Max show) \u2013 How did Wonder Woman\u2019s world, Themyscira, come to be? Find out in this Game of Thrones-ish tale set before her birth.\nThe Brave and the Bold (Theatrical film) \u2013 Based on the acclaimed Grant Morrison comic run, this will explore the story of Batman\u2019s son, Damien Wayne, and will feature \u201cother members of the extended Bat-family.\u201d\nBooster Gold (A live-action Max show) \u2013 The \u201closer from the future\u201d superhero character gets his own series.\nSupergirl: Woman of Tomorrow (Theatrical film) \u2013 Based on Tom King\u2019s comics run, this movie will explore how Supergirl is different from Superman. It\u2019s not yet certain if Sasha Calle, who plays Supergirl in The Flash, will reprise the role here.\nSwamp Thing (Theatrical film) \u2013 The character\u2019s \u201cdark origins\u201d will be the focus of this one. DC does horror! Rumored but not yet confirmed to be directing, James Mangold (Indiana Jones 5) told Collider that he\u2019s slated to write the script.\nUpcoming DC Movies and Shows That Were Once in Development, But Whose Fate Is Unclear in the Gunn/Safran Era\nTa-Nehisi Coates and J.J. Abrams\u2019 Superman movie\nRelease date: Unknown (in theaters)\nThe news of Superman: Legacy cast uncertainty on this project from writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and producer J.J. Abrams. There hadn\u2019t been an update on this one in a while, but in late April, James Gunn himself told io9 that the two films don\u2019t necessarily cancel each other out: \u201cThat\u2019s an exciting movie \u2026 if it comes in and it\u2019s great \u2026 and if the timing is right, that could absolutely happen. That\u2019s totally unrelated. It would be an Elseworlds tale like Joker.\u201d\nMichael B. Jordan Superman Series\nRelease date: Unknown (for Max)\nMichael B. Jordan was once developing a Superman take for Max as a limited series that would feature Val-Zod as opposed to Clark Kent. Again, there hasn\u2019t been an update in a while.\nStatic Shock\nRelease date: Unknown\nPart of the relaunch of the Milestone comic brand is this adaptation produced by, once again, Michael B. Jordan. A writer was hired back in 2021 to come up with a script and we haven\u2019t heard much since.\nJustice League Dark\nRelease date: Unknown (for Max)\nJ.J. Abrams was among the people involved with bringing this evil super-team to life and while there hasn\u2019t been a ton of movement on the project of late, it\u2019s been around long enough that we\u2019d imagine it happens eventually.\nMetal Men\nRelease date: Unknown\nOne of the more recent pre-Gunn/Safran DC films to go into development, this is this tale of six beings based on various powerful metals. It\u2019s from directors Ron Clements and John Musker (Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and Moana), so if it happens, it\u2019ll have an incredible pedigree.\nZatanna\nRelease date: Unknown\nLast year, Emerald Fennell won an Oscar for writing Promising Young Woman. She followed that up landing the job to write this DC superhero flick about the young magician. Like most of the films in this section, there hasn\u2019t been movement in a while.\nHourman\nRelease date: Unknown\nYes, the hero who takes a drug that makes him a hero for an hour was, back in 2021, rumored to be in development. Whether or not that\u2019s still the case is unknown but we figured it was worth noting.\nUntitled Arkham Show\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nIn addition to The Penguin, Matt Reeves has said he plans to expand the world of The Batman into Max shows. At one point, a series about Gotham PD was in the works, but now he says it might be more about the inner workings at Arkham Asylum. On October 25, The Staircase\u2019s Antonio Campos came aboard as a writer\u2014the third to hold that position on the potential series so far\u2014and may direct and serve as showrunner if the show happens, according to a report in Variety.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "Trying to keep track of what\u2019s coming in the realm of Star Trek feels like trying to stop a tribble from procreating. Before even more new series are announced, here\u2019s our guide of when to expect all the new Star Trek shows, as well as returning familiar favorites, and what else is in the works right now. Engage!\nThis post was last updated 7/14/23.\nCurrently Airing: Star Trek: Strange New Worlds Season 2\nThe Enterprise is back after a successful first season, and this time Captain Kirk will be along for the ride with another appearance by Paul Wesley after his surprise finale role in season one. Not much else is known about the season so far, other than one episode will see the show crossover with Star Trek: Lower Decks in a live-action/animated hybrid directed by The Next Generation\u2019s Jonathan Frakes. The show has also been renewed for a third season.\nSeason two recaps:\n\u201cTomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow\u201d\n\u201cCharades\u201d\nUpcoming: Star Trek: Lower Decks Season 4\nThe third season of the animated series following the misfit crew of the USS Cerritos\u2014and in particular its cadre of ensigns, Mariner (Tawny Newsome), Boimler (Jack Quaid), Tendi (No\u00ebl Wells), and Rutherford (Eugene Cordero)\u2014once again followed our heroic ensigns and the remaining bridge officers aboard the Cerritos. Season four will be arriving in late summer. The show has also been renewed for a fifth season.\nUpcoming: Star Trek: Discovery Season 5\nExpected in early 2024, Discovery\u2019s fifth season will be 10 episodes long, down from the 13 of prior seasons. In the wake of season four\u2018s climax earlier this year, Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green) led her crew in a desperate attempt to save the galaxy from a mysterious anomaly created by an extra-galactic race, ensuring peace and stability for the Federation once more\u2026 for now. As her romantic partner Book (David Ajala) pays time for his own role in a campaign to surreptitiously destroy that anomaly, we\u2019re not sure what awaits Burnham and Discovery\u2019s crew just yet, but given this show, we\u2019re sure it\u2019ll be very, very dramatic.\nIn Flux: Star Trek: Prodigy Season 2\nThe animated series aimed at younger Trek fans (and Janeway fans!) and kids at heart can be found on both Nickelodeon and Paramount+. The first season was divided into two parts, with part two wrapping up at the end of 2022; after Paramount+ announced it would not move forward with the show\u2019s already greenlit season two, it was removed from the service. (A home release of the complete first season is still possible; the first 10 episodes are still available for purchase.) Fans are still waiting to hear if Prodigy season two will surface on a different outlet.\nUpcoming: Starfleet Academy\nIt\u2019s really happening! After a long tease, filming on this series will begin in 2024. Here\u2019s the official announcement from co-showrunners and executive producers Alex Kurtzman and Noga Landau:\n\u201cAdmission is now open to Starfleet Academy! Explore the galaxy!

The coursework will be rigorous, the instructors among the brightest lights in their respective fields, and those accepted will live and study side-by-side with the most diverse population of students ever admitted. Today we encourage all who share our dreams, goals and values to join a new generation of visionary cadets as they take their first steps toward creating a bright future for us all. Apply today! Ex Astris, Scientia!\u201d\nUpcoming (movie): Star Trek: Section 31\nAnnounced as a TV series back in 2019 as a spinoff for fan-favorite Discovery guest star Michelle Yeoh, this plunge into the seediest side of Starfleet\u2014the shadowy spy organization Section 31 first introduced in Deep Space Nine\u2014is now planned as a Paramount+ film.\nNewly minted Oscar winner Yeoh will return as former emperor of the Mirror Universe\u2019s Terran Empire, Phillipa Georgiou, now turned into a kinder, but still kickass person by her time with Michael Burnham. \u201cI\u2019m beyond thrilled to return to my Star Trek family and to the role I\u2019ve loved for so long,\u201d Yeoh said in a statement. \u201cSection 31 has been near and dear to my heart since I began the journey of playing Philippa all the way back when this new golden age of Star Trek launched. To see her finally get her moment is a dream come true in a year that\u2019s shown me the incredible power of never giving up on your dreams. We can\u2019t wait to share what\u2019s in store for you, and until then: live long and prosper (unless Emperor Georgiou decrees otherwise)!\u201d\nWritten by Craig Sweeny and directed by Olatunde Osunsanmi, Star Trek: Section 31 will start production later this year, and eventually come to Paramount+.\nWhere Can I Stream Classic Star Trek Shows?\nThat\u2019s all the new bits of Star Trek coming. But what about the old Star Trek? In the U.S. at least, the vast majority of classic Star Trek shows are available exclusively to stream on Paramount+ (albeit not without issues), although some holdouts remain on other streaming services.

      "text": "There\u2019s a new Star Wars movie out this week! The Last Jedi might still feel fresh in your mind, but Solo: A Star Wars Story hits theaters in just two days. Not been following all the news and reveals from the young Han Solo biopic? We\u2019ve compiled all of the officially released info (no spoilers!) so you\u2019re fully prepped to visit the seedier side of a galaxy far, far away this weekend.\nA Wretched Cast of Scum and Villainy\nThere are a few familiar faces in Solo (well, familiar characters with new, younger faces, really), but most of the cast we\u2019re meeting are intriguing new additions to the Star Wars universe. Say hello to the most notable shady scoundrels and smugglers of the Solo lineup:\nHan Solo (Alden Ehrenreich)\u2014The man, the myth, the legend, just before he was either the myth or the legend. A young ruffian from the planet Corellia, Han Solo is a wide-eyed adventurer dreaming of getting his big break, and the chance to make a living flying ships any way he can. He finds himself thrust into the life of cons and smugglers after a chance encounter with some smugglers in search of a new crew.\nChewbacca (Joonas Suotamo)\u2014Of course, he\u2019s Han\u2019s future co-pilot, but we don\u2019t actually know much about how Han and the young Wookiee meet in Solo (outside of the fact that Han rescued Chewie from slavery at the hands of the Empire), just that he\u2019s along for the ride as Han finds himself pulled into the smuggling life.\nQi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke)\u2014A cryptic woman who grew up with Han on Corellia, Qi\u2019ra is a major player in the galactic underworld by the time she meets Han again during the events of Solo. The trailers have teased her knowing some mysterious secrets about who Han really is, so she\u2019ll likely hold some intriguing leverage over him during the course of the movie.\nTobias Beckett (Woody Harrelson)\u2014A die-hard rogue, Beckett recruits Han on the planet Mimban for a series of heists, becoming the young man\u2019s mentor in the ways of the galaxy\u2019s best criminals.\nVal (Thandie Newton)\u2014A close Beckett associate, she\u2019s one of the most mysterious characters in the film, if only because we\u2019ve barely seen her in any footage released so far.\nLando Calrissian (Donald Glover)\u2014Captain of the Millennium Falcon, master Sabacc player, and owner of multiple suave capes, Lando Calrissian is a hotshot smuggler introduced to Han and the crew by Qi\u2019ra as they hunt for a pilot to join their heist. Also, he\u2019s apparently Star Wars\u2019 first officially pansexual character, but whether or not that actually gets acknowledged in the film remains to be seen.\nL3-37 (Phoebe Waller-Bridge)\u2014Lando\u2019s droid accomplice and the current co-pilot of the Falcon. A quirky, female-pronouned droid with a dry British accent, L3 is a \u201cself-made\u201d droid\u2014literally, as in she built herself out of the random parts of other droids. She\u2019s very excited about beating people up and taking dangerous jobs.\nRio Durant (Jon Favreau)\u2014A multiple-armed alien who joins Beckett\u2019s crew for a train heist on the snowy planet Vandor-1. We\u2019ve not seen Rio anywhere beyond this, so maybe something rather unfortunate happens to the poor little guy.\nDryden Vos (Paul Bettany)\u2014A sinister gangster once set to be played by Michael K. Williams, Vos is a swanky, face-scarred criminal who is the leader of the Crimson Dawn crime organization. Vos hires Beckett\u2019s crew for a big job, and at some point after she left Han on Corellia, Qi\u2019ra became one of his top lieutenants.\nEnfys Nest\u2014An alien leader of a swoop bike gang called the Cloud-Riders, who are a deep cut reference to some of the earliest Marvel Star Wars comics. Nest hounds Han and the crew across multiple worlds over the course of the movie.\nThe Backwater Worlds of a Galaxy Far, Far Away\nSolo will take Han and the crew to a whole bunch of worlds never seen on screen. A lot of names are pretty familiar from Star Wars history, though.\nCorellia\u2014The homeworld of Han (and presumably Qi\u2019ra), Corellia is a major source of ship manufacturing for the Empire during Han\u2019s youth, and the Imperial presence on the world is severe.\nMimban\u2014A swamp world that is the site of major conflicts for the Empire and local rebel forces, Mimban is the dreary locale where a young Han Solo serves as an Imperial serviceman. This is not only where he meets Chewbacca, but also Val and Beckett, who give him a chance to escape the monotonous life of a soldier and follow his dreams. Before Solo, Mimban was best known as the planet Luke and Leia visit during the infamous Splinter of the Mind\u2019s Eye, the first ever original Star Wars novel, published in 1978.\nVandor-1\u2014A snowy world that\u2019s been a huge part of the trailers as the site of a big heist on an Imperial freight train called the Conveyex, where Beckett plans to test Han\u2019s worthiness to join his crew.\nKessel\u2014The infamous home of the mines which hold the illicit, deadly drug Spice, and the slaves used to harvest it. Kessel will be a major location in Solo partially because it gives its name to the legendary Kessel Run, an act of speedy piloting Han will spend the rest of his life claiming he completed in under 12 parsecs.\nThe Life and Times of Han Solo\nHan Solo is one of the most iconic Star Wars characters around\u2014and Solo is not the first time his backstory has been delved into in either the old Expanded Universe or Disney\u2019s revamped canon (it will also likely not be the last piece of media to explore his pre-A New Hope days). But the more things have changed since the Expanded Universe came to a close with Disney\u2019s acquisition of Lucasfilm, the more things have stayed the same when it comes to certain aspects of young Han\u2019s life. Here\u2019s just a few of the big details from Han\u2019s formative years in the EU that are going to be making their way into Solo.\nHan\u2019s going to have some Imperial entanglements. In the old EU, Han escaped a hellish childhood on Corellia and found himself accepted into the Imperial Academy at Carida, graduating as a junior officer (thanks to his success in flight training more than his academic ability). In Solo, he still signs up with the Empire, but gets a much more Han Solo-suitable position: a lowly grunt serving on a hellhole backwater world. Just like in the EU, though, it\u2019s his Imperial service that sees Han\u2019s path cross with the enslaved Chewbacca.\nWe get to see Han win the Millennium Falcon. Lando notes in Empire Strikes Back that he lost his beloved freighter to Han in a game of cards, and while the EU had its own versions of the tale, Solo will give us the \u201cofficial\u201d version of that moment, during what appears to be during the first encounter between Han and Lando. Bold play, Mr. Solo, but apparently it works out?\nThe infamous Kessel Run will finally be shown. Despite Han\u2019s boisterous claims to Luke and Obi-Wan about the speed\u2014well, a parsec is a measure of distance, but let\u2019s not go into that\u2014with which he completed the legendary run, we\u2019ve never actually seen or learned just what the Kessel run actually was, or even if Han really completed it. In the EU, the run was a well-known smuggler route from the spice world to the planet Formos, but if the trailers are anything to go by, in Solo it looks to be a major chase sequence as the Falcon escapes Imperial forces.\nThere Was Some Behind-the-Scenes Drama You May Have Heard About\nBeyond the fictional world of Solo, some of the biggest news stories that have surrounded the movie are about what happened on the other side of the camera.\nSolo was originally to be directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the duo behind The Lego Movie and 21 Jump Street. Months into production, it was abruptly announced that the pair had been let go from the film, and Ron Howard came aboard. Rumors about just why the duo had left the film flared up almost as quickly as Lord and Miller were replaced, alleging disagreements in style and production speed between the directors and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, which became so severe that she made the unorthodox decision to fire the directors mid-production. While the details will likely never be truly known, it\u2019s a story that\u2019s hung over Solo for almost a year now\u2014leading to a lot of concern from fans about how the film would turn out, given that the previous Star Wars Story film, Rogue One, also went through some behind-the-scenes issues.\nDespite the focus on the drama, it doesn\u2019t appear to have particularly damaged the final product, if early reviews of the film are anything to go by. Unlike Rogue One, which had a bunch of reshoots, it seems like the differences in what was left of Lord and Miller\u2019s movie in the final cut and what was reshot by Howard will be less noticeable. This is perhaps because, despite scriptwriters Jon and Lawrence Kasdan insisting the DNA of Lord and Miller\u2019s vision is still a major part of the film, Howard allegedly shot around 70 percent of the final film."

      "text": "This article was featured in One Great Story, New York\u2019s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.\nRon Howard began his Hollywood career in 1959, appearing in Anatole Litvak\u2019s Cold War drama The Journey, his first credited role, when he was 4 years old. In the 1960s, he became a TV star as Opie Taylor, the young son of Sheriff Andy Taylor on The Andy Griffith Show. As the old studio system was dying, the New Hollywood era was emerging; Howard found himself in the middle of it with a starring role in George Lucas\u2019s 1973 sleeper hit American Graffiti. By that point, Howard had already set his sights on directing and helmed his first feature, 1977\u2019s Grand Theft Auto for producer Roger Corman, while acting as Richie Cunningham on TV\u2019s Happy Days.\nSince then, he has made many enduring movies, among them comedies Splash and Parenthood; blockbusters Cocoon, Backdraft, How the Grinch Stole Christmas, and The Da Vinci Code; and award-winning hits Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, Frost/Nixon, and Cinderella Man. His new film, Eden, an intense epic set in the 1930s about a group of people trapped on an inhospitable island in the Gal\u00e1pagos, tells a crazy story full of terror, bloodlust, and sexual abandon. You\u2019ll find all the things Howard excels at as a director: an immersive sense of place, a fascination with extreme real-life personalities, and a nose for tales about families struggling under unimaginable pressure. As a director, a producer, and an actor, he probably understands the film business as well as anyone. \u201cI do have commercial instincts and tastes,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I\u2019ve never really been driven by that.\u201d\nI\u2019m sure everyone says this to you, but it is funny meeting you because I feel like I grew up with you.\nSometimes parents will want to introduce me to their kids and are kind of perplexed because they can\u2019t really put it together.\nBecause the kids don\u2019t necessarily \u2014\n\u201cOh, he was Opie when he was your age.\u201d Well, that doesn\u2019t mean anything to them. \u201cHe directed The Grinch.\u201d \u201cOh, okay. The Grinch.\u201d They keep fishing for some degree of connection.\nMy family came to the U.S. in 1980 from Turkey, and by that point, you had left Happy Days or were about to. But both that and The Andy Griffith Show were in heavy syndication. The early \u201980s is also when the films you were directing were starting to come out. I was like 10 or 11, making the connection between somebody who was a little kid on a show, who was a teenager, and is now a director.\nAs a little kid, it didn\u2019t take me long to realize that the director was the one who was hanging out with everybody. And a lot of our directors on The Andy Griffith Show had been actors, and I think Andy liked that. In fact, Howard Morris was the first one who said to me, \u201cI think you\u2019re going to wind up being a director because I see the way you\u2019re curious about it all.\u201d But I was 10, and I didn\u2019t think much about it. It was really falling in love with movies that made me excited about being a director \u2014 The Graduate, Bonnie and Clyde, Guess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner, In the Heat of the Night, Romeo & Juliet \u2014 those movies just captivated me.\nIn fact, when my co-star Charlie Martin Smith and I were doing American Graffiti, one night we found out that The Graduate was on the second bill of the local drive-in. We went to get our Graduate fix and imitate Dustin Hoffman and look at all the shots. It felt accessible.\nYou\u2019ve worked with so many different actors and gotten so many great performances out of them. And you obviously were an actor yourself for a long time.\nCurrently Emmy nominated!\nEach actor has a different process. So how do you find the triggers to get the performances you need?\nI can read them pretty quickly. Some actors want to be analytical; some don\u2019t want to overthink it. Some love rehearsal; some don\u2019t. The most extreme version of this I learned very early on Cocoon because I had seven veterans. Among the men, four different working styles. Wilford Brimley was totally improvisational. He was a younger guy and much more independent in his spirit and tone and sensibilities. He was more like Duvall or De Niro and wanted to be in the moment. And Don Ameche was an old-school Hollywood guy: \u201cTell me my lines, show me my mark, and I will deliver what the script suggests should be delivered and do what the director wants.\u201d The other two guys were in between. Jack Gilford was a comedian. Hume Cronyn was a playwright as well as an actor. They could riff with Wilford a little bit. And it elevated the tone of this genre movie. There was an honesty to these guys that I really liked. But Don could not keep up with Wilford\u2019s improvisational vibe. In rehearsal, he tightened up because he didn\u2019t understand how to do that. And the writer and I started slipping him jokes and lines, things he could pretend were ad-libs. He started to feel so much better, and he wound up winning an Oscar as supporting actor.\nWhen I had the script for A Beautiful Mind, I knew how strong it was, but I hadn\u2019t yet done a full-on drama. We were getting ready to rehearse. And this is really name-dropping, but it was an act of giving and support I will never forget: I was in the production offices in New Jersey and got on the phone, and in one day I got through to Martin Scorsese, Mike Nichols, and Sidney Lumet and asked what they do in rehearsal periods. I said, \u201cThis is my first full-on drama, and I like to rehearse, but how do you use the time?\u201d Mike Nichols said, \u201cYou want enough anecdotes so that maybe at three in the morning you can reference some anecdote that\u2019s going to trigger something when they\u2019re tired and really wish the night were over.\u201d Lumet was more about freeing the actors by having enough preparation; he did a lot of mechanical blocking, but he said it was so that on the shoot day, it was all creativity. And Scorsese was more about finding each actor and understanding who could improvise, who needed the script, and somehow pulling all that together.\nWhat\u2019s the biggest disagreement you\u2019ve had with an actor?\nOn Splash, there were a lot of choices I didn\u2019t really buy, and I let them do it and then we did another take my way. But on the edit, I remember saying to Dan Hanley on the editing team, \u201cIf I ever get to work with Hanks again, I\u2019m going to give him his head. He knows something.\u201d And Russell Crowe is very much one of those actors where you may not recognize a nuance in the moment. Ana de Armas is also like that. You see it, you think it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s fine, maybe you try another couple of takes \u2014 you don\u2019t see it advancing. But then on film, the nuance is there in a powerful way.\nOh God, I remember another one: Brimley in Cocoon. He hated coverage, and he didn\u2019t like close-ups. He especially didn\u2019t like having to repeat a scene. One scene, we did the wide shot, and he said, \u201cWhy do you need a close-up here?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I need coverage to be able to control the rhythm of this scene.\u201d He said, \u201cThey\u2019re not going to let you control it anyway; you\u2019re young. Those producers are going to take this movie away from you.\u201d I said, \u201cThat hasn\u2019t happened to me on any of my movies so far.\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s going to happen on this one.\u201d And I said, \u201cLook, I need you to do this close-up, but I\u2019ll bet you. If they force me to make even one cut, I\u2019ll pay you $1,000. But if I can control the movie to the end, you owe me $1,000.\u201d He said, \u201cOkay.\u201d And he still did the close-up in a pouty, shitty way, but I got what I needed, and we moved on. The studio, Zanuck/Brown, loved it. Then I screened it for Barry Diller, who is famously critical. I thought, Well, I\u2019m going to lose the bet today. But he loved it. And I realized when I locked the movie, I\u2019d gotten no notes. Everybody liked what I did! By the way, that would never happen today with all the executives determined to give you notes, but it was a much leaner operation in those days.\nI wrote Wilford a letter that said, \u201cWilford, I want to thank you for all you contributed to this movie. Your improvisations elevated this movie in a way that I could not have dreamed of. But I do feel I should let you know that I won the bet, and I\u2019d like you to make a donation.\u201d I won\u2019t say what it was, but I chose a charity that I knew he wouldn\u2019t approve of. I said, \u201cSo please send it to X, Y, and Z address.\u201d All I got back was an envelope with a $1,000 check and no note. He left it to me to make the donation.\nThe characters in Eden feel larger than life, and you get pretty extreme performances out of your actors. I could easily see another filmmaker asking them to rein it in. To what extent did you feel you had to push them?\nNot much. Because we thought we were reining it in based on the real people. These were wild-ass characters most of them are playing. I cast actors who I knew had a kind of courage. One of the gutsiest things I\u2019ve ever seen, especially once I met Ana de Armas, is that she did Blonde and pulled it off so beautifully. In conversation, she\u2019s anxious; she was creatively anxious about the baroness. But when it came time to roll cameras, she was brave. And I felt that about everybody involved but especially the three women. Vanessa Kirby is very creative, and her character is the most mysterious in terms of what was written about her. But she was brilliant at piecing together a journey for Dore Strauch that I don\u2019t necessarily think even Noah Pink and I understood. And Sydney Sweeney\u2019s a little bit more that throwback kind of \u201cLet\u2019s just do it. Okay, I got it. Let\u2019s not overthink it.\u201d\nEden premiered at Toronto last year. It\u2019s got big stars, it\u2019s got your name on it, but it\u2019s just now being released by a small distributor. This comes on the heels of 2022\u2019s Thirteen Lives, which was also well reviewed and star-studded. That came out on Prime Video and had a very small theatrical release.\nThat was a disappointment to me. Thirteen Lives would have been a theatrical feature. But COVID played hell. And in uncertain times, it is good just to get your movie out there. You make them for that theatrical experience, all of us do, even if that winds up being only the premiere and a handful of theaters. Eden was made as an indie. I had a script people liked. There was a SAG strike, and we got a waiver. We had to shoot fast. It was miserable. Everything\u2019s an exterior set. If it rained, we had to stop, and we were getting these thunderstorms almost every day. My running gag was \u201cThe only cover we have is to shoot real fucking fast when the weather\u2019s with us.\u201d I\u2019m glad it\u2019s getting a theatrical release because I still think that gives every movie an imprint, almost like a hardcover publication of a book.\nDo you feel your place in the industry has changed as a director?\nSure. It\u2019s always been a changing thing in my mind. I\u2019ve never felt like, Oh, this is it; I have to maintain this, because you\u2019re only as good as your last film, even if you have a bank account and a good r\u00e9sum\u00e9. It\u2019s much narrower now in terms of what\u2019s proven to deliver an audience. But as a storyteller, streamers are fine too. So is longform television. I thought about trying to sell Eden as a six-hour miniseries or something, and I felt like, No, there\u2019s enough of a thriller in there that I think you want to transport people and hold them.\nWould you do a horror film?\nI would do a psychological thriller. I loved The Exorcist. I wouldn\u2019t do a slasher movie; that\u2019s a little too real to me. But I would do supernatural if I could find the right story. I\u2019m dying to find a contemporary sci-fi fantasy, like Cocoon or Her or The Shape of Water.\nThe Shape of Water, by the way, is a film not unlike Splash in some respects.\nI haven\u2019t found it, but I\u2019m actively searching for something like Big Fish \u2014 that tone, that style. I love doing movies based on real events, but that pushes the aesthetic of the film into a more naturalistic vein. And if I could find a good fantasy where I connected with the themes and the character, it would open the door to something a little more visually poetic.\nYour episode of The Studio, in which you play a fictional version of yourself as you\u2019re given upsetting studio notes about a very personal film, was hilarious. Obviously, it\u2019s a satire \u2014 but how accurate is it?\nThe neurosis and the strategic thinking, manipulation, lying, and hedging \u2014 all that stuff is 1,000 percent accurate. It doesn\u2019t play out at that hyperspeed or with that intensity. But Anthony Mackie has a line in our episode where he talks about some neurotic back-and-forth, and he says, \u201cShit\u2019s real.\u201d I feel like shit\u2019s real in the show. People don\u2019t go at that pace, and they don\u2019t wear their craziness on their sleeves quite that much, but there are plenty of war stories that would line up with what they\u2019re writing.\nWhat would you say is the worst note you\u2019ve ever gotten?\nThere was a note that nearly prevented us from getting Splash made. There was this movie that Herb Ross was going to direct called Mermaid with Jessica Lange in the prime of her career as the mermaid and Warren Beatty as the human, the above-grounder. And the tremendous Ray Stark was the producer, and he was trying to kill our movie. In fact, this was a galvanizing moment in my relationship with Brian Grazer that ultimately would lead us to launch a company. We were taking the movie around everywhere, and they were all turning it down and they kept saying, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t know what tone it is. It\u2019s fantasy, it\u2019s verbal comedy, it\u2019s physical comedy.\u201d And I kept thinking, What the hell is wrong with that? That\u2019s a blend that works. It\u2019s Frank Capra. Are you kidding me? I think they were all just looking for an excuse to pass because no one wanted to compete. Disney was on its ass at that point. They\u2019d been making movies like Gus, about a field-goal-kicking mule. They were willing to take on the challenge, and Stark tried to bully Brian. He said, \u201cI\u2019m going to ruin you,\u201d literally. And then he said, \u201cTell you what \u2014 I\u2019ll let you be in my movie. You can co-produce it with me. Drop yours.\u201d Brian, without a lot of money in his bank account, had the courage and fortitude to stay with it, even though Disney was a real B-studio at the time.\nSomething I noticed rewatching your films is that they have an interesting relationship with the female characters. There are a lot of characters in your films who could easily become just the spouse. But rewatching A Beautiful Mind, the second part of that movie is her movie.\nI have three daughters and a very intelligent, thoughtful wife. I\u2019m interested in women. I also like to get smart actors, and they all want to flesh things out. This movie wasn\u2019t highly successful, but I\u2019m so proud of Cate Blanchett\u2019s performance in The Missing. Tommy Lee Jones was great too, but her character was the reason I wanted to make that movie.\nAnother reason I ask this is because I read the memoir you wrote with your brother, Clint, The Boys. You talk about how you guys gained a new appreciation for your mom much later in life.\nI underestimated her. I put my dad on such a pedestal, and he deserved it, hell of a guy, but I realized that she was the reason the course of the family history changed. She was the one with the clarity and the vision. I totally missed that as a young man.\nMy dad said she was the best actor at the University of Oklahoma when they went to school there after World War II. She had come to New York and gone to the Academy of Dramatic Arts as a 17-year-old. Her parents, from small-town Duncan, Oklahoma, had enough money to let her go. But she got hit by a truck somewhere here in New York, and she then shied away. She went back to drama school in Oklahoma, where my parents met. The business was not kind to her. Later, after Clint and I left, she started acting again, dabbled, and went zero for 100 on auditions. She then went to an audition-scene study class and slowly but surely started getting work. She wound up in a few little things and started getting more confidence. She had a silent role, did some work on Cocoon, and really appreciated that, hanging around with Cocoon actors Jessica Tandy and Maureen Stapleton.\nOne day, Dad, who had never hocked me for work at all, called me when we had just gotten John Sayles\u2019s rewrite on Apollo 13. He said, \u201cI wanted to talk to you about that latest draft.\u201d He said, \u201cYour mother would knock that new Jim Lovell\u2019s mother part out of the park.\u201d And I said, \u201cOh, Dad. She\u2019s just gotten back to doing it. I don\u2019t know. I mean, that\u2019s a pretty important role.\u201d But he said, \u201cOh, she could do it.\u201d \u201cWell, she\u2019s a little too young.\u201d \u201cOh, you could age her easily.\u201d \u201cOkay. Well, I\u2019d have to audition her.\u201d But I didn\u2019t want to bring her into the office. So I went to the house and I said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s read through the scenes.\u201d She was good. And I said, \u201cBut Mom, the thing is, you\u2019re really too young to be this woman, to be Mrs. Lovell in an old folks\u2019 home.\u201d Mom was 62 or something. She said, \u201cI could dye my hair, and they can increase my wrinkles.\u201d And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d And then she turned away and took her false teeth out and said, \u201cWould this help?!\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, okay, okay! You got the part!\u201d\nI was very moved by the last thing she said to you guys.\nAt the end of her life, she couldn\u2019t talk. I said, \u201cMom, do you want to write something?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d She wrote it in this tiny squiggling, \u201cRance loves to act.\u201d I\u2019m getting a little bit emotional because it\u2019s just \u2026 their relationship sums it up. She liked it enough to want to do it, but she knew that for him it was his lifeblood.\nI was intrigued to learn that when The Andy Griffith Show first started, it was your dad\u2019s idea to change the relationship between Opie and Andy into what it turned out to be.\nDad never said anything about that to me. Many years later, when we were doing a Return to Mayberry TV movie or reunion special or something, Andy told me that my dad had come to him very early on in the show and said, \u201cYou\u2019re writing Opie the way most sitcom kids are written. They\u2019re wiseasses and smarter than the dad.\u201d And he said, \u201cRonnie can do that, but what if Opie actually respected his dad?\u201d Now, I don\u2019t know if Dad was just worried about me getting into bad habits, or I think he was, in his own very simple way, actually teaching me Actors Studio stuff. It was the simplest version of Method acting, finding the truth in moments. I think maybe he felt like there was a lot of artifice in these punch-line-driven deliveries that would be required.\nIn an excellent book from last year, Looking for Andy Griffith, by Evan Dalton Smith, he talks about Griffith\u2019s legacy and how he became a surrogate father for so many people, starting in the \u201960s and up to today. But if your dad doesn\u2019t make that suggestion, this doesn\u2019t happen.\nWell, I think a lot doesn\u2019t happen if he doesn\u2019t make that suggestion. But look, I tried not to screw things up, and I was given a lot of advantages, including growing up on that show. The environment was super-creative. The show looks so simple, but it was all about this very precise problem-solving. I would see scenes suddenly become funny or work. Because it wasn\u2019t done in front of an audience, and even though we were working quickly, what Andy wanted was a truthfulness. But it still required perfect timing and exactly the right tone. Andy was always annoyed that the media didn\u2019t really embrace the show. In season five, I remember him saying, \u201cHow long do we have to be in the top ten for them to understand why this show works?\u201d And then he started reading the Variety review out loud, and it wasn\u2019t very flattering.\nEarly on in Happy Days, they wanted to change the title to Fonzie\u2019s Happy Days after Henry Winkler\u2019s initially supporting character proved so popular. But you really stood up for yourself and wouldn\u2019t let them.\nI never, ever challenged what they were doing creatively. It made perfect sense that you\u2019d build this Fonzie character and maximize that. But the optics of now being in a show called Fonzie\u2019s Happy Days, my ego wouldn\u2019t allow for that. I wasn\u2019t bluffing. I would\u2019ve left. And my contract, I\u2019m sure, had no clause connected to titles. They could have said, \u201cFuck you. We changed the title, and we expect you to show up Monday morning.\u201d But thank God for great bosses. Garry Marshall said, \u201cIf you\u2019re not cool with it \u2026\u201d I later found out Henry himself thought it was a terrible idea. I think the position I took made it easy for both Garry and Henry to also say, \u201cNo, let\u2019s not do that.\u201d Years later, Henry said they were ready to do a spinoff and other things for Fonzie and he just said, \u201cWhy fix it if it\u2019s not broken? My success depends on the ensemble I\u2019m in.\u201d\nIn your transition from Happy Days actor to director, you grew a prominent mustache in the 1980s. Tell me about shaving it off.\nOh, you heard about that? Brian Grazer got to know Andy Warhol, and Warhol said, \u201cRon Howard has grown this mustache.\u201d He replied, \u201cYeah, well, he\u2019s a director. He is trying to have more authority, look a little older.\u201d Warhol said, \u201cI\u2019d like to photograph him and paint him, but I\u2019d like to photograph him and paint him before with the mustache and then I\u2019d want to shave the mustache and photograph and paint him again. But I\u2019d want to shave it.\u201d And I said, \u201cYou know, Warhol\u2019s a really interesting guy, but I\u2019m not letting Andy Warhol shave my mustache.\u201d Pretty stupid. I think I could have a couple of original Warhols right about now.\nBut what really made it stupid was one night we opened a movie we had both produced: John Waters\u2019s Cry-Baby. We loved everything about Cry-Baby, and we were so excited. We knew from test screenings it wasn\u2019t for everybody. But we felt like, in a sort of niche way, that an audience is going to come charging out for this. In those days, opening nights would be a bit of an event. You could see the lines. We went to two or three theaters, and literally there were like three people, four people. It was shattering.\nSo we went back to Brian\u2019s house. He had a tape of Drugstore Cowboy. We sat there having margaritas and watching Drugstore Cowboy and then we had maybe another margarita or two, and for some reason, we watched Drugstore Cowboy again. We loved the movie, but it\u2019s the most depressing movie. We were depressed. And I literally went straight to the airport because it was now almost 3 a.m., 4 a.m., and I had to take a morning flight to San Francisco to meet with Industrial Light & Magic, George Lucas\u2019s visual-effects studio, on something. I\u2019d heard the Andy Warhol story, and truth be told, I was getting a little sick of my mustache. I just didn\u2019t want somebody shaving it off and photographing it. That notion creeped me out. I had my overnight bag, and I went into the men\u2019s room of the airport and shaved my mustache. I got back from ILM a day or two later. I\u2019m in the office, and Brian says, \u201cWhat happened to your mustache?\u201d I said, \u201cI shaved it.\u201d \u201cYou shaved it?\u201d I said, \u201cI was so depressed after the movie, and I was a little drunk. I don\u2019t know \u2014 I just said \u2018Fuck it\u2019 and I shaved it.\u201d He said, \u201cYou idiot! You didn\u2019t even want the mustache!\u201d I think maybe Brian had a deal that he could have gotten a copy of the Warhol.\nWhat would you say is the most personal film you\u2019ve made?\nParenthood was just overtly personal. My kids were young. With Ganz and Mandel and Brian, I think there were 15 kids between all of us, and everybody contributed stories that were personal to them. I get so many screenwriters who come up and want to talk to me about Parenthood. Frost/Nixon screenwriter Peter Morgan once said to me, \u201cIt\u2019s American Chekhov.\u201d I mean, this is not somebody who throws compliments around. I passed that along to Ganz and Mandel right away. There were aspects of Hillbilly Elegy that were personal because I wanted to do something about the heartland that wasn\u2019t a bank-robbing story or about farming.\nWhat do you think the legacy of Hillbilly Elegy is now? Do you think about it?\nI don\u2019t think about it. I know it\u2019s a mixed bag and probably quite culturally divided. I also know that reviews were bad and the audience-reaction rating was pretty good.\nYou obviously spent a lot of time with J. D. Vance back then; you did press together. Are you able to reconcile the person you knew and the character in the movie with the person you see now?\nAm I able to reconcile? Well, it\u2019s happened, so I know what I\u2019ve observed. It remains a bit of a surprise to me. I would not have seen it coming, and I wouldn\u2019t have expected his rhetoric to be as divisive as it sometimes is. By the way, I\u2019m not following him or listening to every word.\nI remember reading that the response to the film had really shocked him. [A spokesperson for Vance did not respond to requests for comment.] Did you get that sense at the time?\nYes, I did. He was frustrated by that. He loved Glenn Close\u2019s performance and Amy Adams\u2019s performance and liked the film. And he felt that, just as reviews had kind of turned on the book, his involvement was in some way tainting or coloring the critical response, and he resented it.\nI remember some suggested the response to the film might have turned him even more to the right.\nI can\u2019t speak to that. When I was working with him, all his quotes about the administration were very public. He was trying to run an investment fund. So the run for Senate and the strategy he\u2019s chosen to follow are not what I would\u2019ve expected.\nHave you had any interactions with him since then?\nI did one text, after the election, which was just sort of \u201cGodspeed. Try to serve us well.\u201d\nYou are one of the only working filmmakers now who straddled a few different eras of Hollywood. Maybe Clint Eastwood is the other.\nI worked with people from the studio system, but I never was a part of it. That wasn\u2019t much around, though Harrison Ford told me he had a contract at Universal for a while before Graffiti that had expired. I asked Don Ameche a million questions about the studio system when I was doing Cocoon, just as I had asked Bette Davis, who I directed a few years before. Bette Davis implied it, but Don Ameche said, \u201cDon\u2019t romanticize that. That\u2019s a trap.\u201d He said, \u201cIt was socially a trap because we felt like we couldn\u2019t go outside our bubble, because movies were the biggest thing in the world at that point.\u201d They would tell you what to do every fucking time. And Bette Davis told me it took her 14 years to work off her seven-year contract because she was constantly being suspended for declining projects. Don didn\u2019t; he played ball and regretted it. He became a massive star, but he said, \u201cThey relegated me to a lot of romantic comedies where I was this loopy second banana or something. Be glad you\u2019re in a period where you decide what you want to do.\u201d\nWhat was Bette Davis like?\nShe was tough on me. She was in her 70s. She was not real happy with this 25-year-old guy from a sitcom directing this TV movie, but she really wanted the part. Then I cast someone who had never acted before in the role of a girl confined to a wheelchair. The actress was paraplegic, and I felt like she could bring a level of authenticity to it. Bette Davis was very upset about this. She said, \u201cI have all my scenes with this girl. She\u2019s 14 years old and has never acted.\u201d She nominated several other candidates. I met them, auditioned them, didn\u2019t feel they were a better way to go. I hadn\u2019t met Bette Davis yet, but I called her and said, \u201cI know you\u2019re concerned about this, but I just want you to know I\u2019ve made the decision to cast Suzy Gilstrap. I\u2019m going to have a dialogue coach with her constantly, and I will protect you and make sure that your performance is excellent.\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, Mr. Howard, I really disagree with this decision.\u201d I said, \u201cI understand, but the network supports my choice, and I think it\u2019s going to be right for the spirit of this film.\u201d She said, \u201cWell, Mr. Howard, I suppose we\u2019ll have to see.\u201d And I said, \u201cMs. Davis, please just call me Ron.\u201d And she said, \u201cNo, I will call you Mr. Howard until I decide whether I like you or not,\u201d and hung up.\nSo now I\u2019m really thrown. I\u2019m not far from shooting, I\u2019m not sleeping well, and I mention it to my dad. He said, \u201cLook, she\u2019s an Oscar-winning actress. She\u2019s a tremendous talent. She therefore knows she needs to be directed. Every great actor knows they need help. And so do your job. Don\u2019t overcompensate. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d I did a little research and saw that William Wyler was her favorite director. He wore a suit and tie on the set every day, so even though we were shooting in Plano, Texas, in August, I showed up in a corduroy sport coat and a tie. Man, that was fucking hot. Anson Williams was producing, and he fought to send a limo to pick her up at the airport. She said, \u201cThat\u2019s the first time anyone\u2019s sent a limo for me in 15 years.\u201d She appreciated that. She had her whiskey and her unfiltered Camels. That was her whole perk package.\nIt\u2019s the first day we\u2019re shooting, and she\u2019s playing an aerobatic pilot. We have a mock-up, and I\u2019m going to twist the camera the opposite way, and she\u2019ll lean a little, and it\u2019ll look like she\u2019s inverted. She\u2019s not really getting it, so I give her a bit of guidance. I walk up to her, and she reacts: \u201cOh my God!\u201d Loud enough for the whole crew to hear. \u201cOh, you frightened me! I saw this child walking toward me, and I couldn\u2019t help but wonder, What of any consequence could this child possibly have to say to me? \u201d And she does the Bette Davis laugh with the Camel: \u201cHahahahahahaha.\u201d So I laughed and leaned in and said, \u201cWhen the camera goes this way, if you lean the other way, it helps with the illusion.\u201d She said, \u201cOkay, fine, fine.\u201d\nSo I go back, and I\u2019m popping Tums and wondering what this will be like. Through the whole day, she\u2019s very tense, doesn\u2019t talk to me much. We get to one scene, we\u2019re blocking; she has to make an exit, but it\u2019s a little awkward. I said, \u201cOh, Ms. Davis, try that again, and I would try leaving the line earlier, then maybe do the second line on the walk and then maybe just try the last line at the door.\u201d She said, \u201cOh, that won\u2019t work.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, just try it for me. Let me see.\u201d She said, \u201cSure, of course I\u2019ll try it. That\u2019s me, I\u2019m always the director\u2019s kid! Hahahahaha!\u201d So we did the little rehearsal, and even before she got through the door, she said, \u201cI see what you mean. That works. Okay, let\u2019s shoot it.\u201d So we did it. We went through the rest of the day. Now, it\u2019s about 4:30, and I said, \u201cMs. Davis, that\u2019s a wrap for you. Great first day. Thank you so much.\u201d And she said, \u201cOkay, Ron, see you tomorrow,\u201d and slapped me on my ass. From that point, she was okay. She was great with Suzy, by the way \u2014 not icy with her for a heartbeat.\nYou resisted sequels and franchises for a while but did eventually do the Robert Langdon films. I liked The Da Vinci Code, but by Inferno, which didn\u2019t do as well and whose release was delayed by almost a year, were you tired of making these?\nI loved doing those, especially The Da Vinci Code. All three of those movies tested really well with audiences in our preview process. I was reluctant with Inferno. Hanks wanted to do it. He said at one point, \u201cCome on, we don\u2019t want to break in another director on this, do we?\u201d And he cajoled me. It was lucrative, and it was going to be another great adventure. I mean, my God, we wound up living in Florence, shooting in Venice, Istanbul. So I went into it pretty clear-eyed. And I also felt, Well, we all agreed it was going to be a trilogy, and we\u2019d close it out with that one.\nI liked Solo a lot, too, but that also underperformed and was affected by the behind-the-scenes drama.\nI\u2019d always been curious about Star Wars, and Solo landed in my lap when I didn\u2019t have another movie set to go. My wife, Cheryl, and I were vacationing in Paris. I went to London to see Hans Zimmer play at the O2, and I reached out to Kathy Kennedy just to say \u201chi.\u201d And she said, \u201cDo you want to come to breakfast?\u201d I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d Also the late Alli Shearmur, who I had worked with before, and Jon Kasdan eventually showed up. They basically said, \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a creative impasse with Lord and Miller. Would you ever consider coming in?\u201d\nI looked at some edited footage, and I saw what was bothering them. There was a studio that liked the script the way it was and wanted a Star Wars movie, but there was a disconnect early on tonally, and they weren\u2019t convinced that what Phil and Chris were doing was working effectively. I couldn\u2019t judge that because I didn\u2019t see enough of it to know. But they were sure. Once I said, \u201cOkay, I think I can do this script, and I think I understand what you want of this script,\u201d they said, \u201cWe\u2019d want to reshoot a lot.\u201d I looked at the whole movie and then pointed out some things that I thought were great. And Phil and Chris were incredibly gracious throughout that process. They were just seeing two different movies. So I came in, I had a blast, but there\u2019s nothing personal about that film whatsoever. It\u2019s still just a shame. I can\u2019t wait for Phil and Chris\u2019s next movie.\nWhat did George Lucas tell you?\nI talked to him once early, when I was just thinking about doing it. He wasn\u2019t active on the films, but he said, \u201cJust don\u2019t forget \u2014 it\u2019s for 12-year-old boys.\u201d\nEarlier, you directed Willow for him. What kind of latitude did you have on that?\nGeorge really made it a collaboration. I always felt, at the end of the day, This is George\u2019s movie. It\u2019s his idea. He\u2019s putting his money into it, even though he didn\u2019t talk about it. He was the first to give me final cut, but I knew I would never exercise it.\nThere\u2019s a monster in Willow called the Eborsisk \u2014 after critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel \u2014 and one of the main bad guys is called General Kael, after Pauline Kael. How has your relationship to criticism changed over the years?\nThe Eborsisk and Kael! They were more Lucas\u2019s idea. But I was upset at that time with Siskel and Ebert. They\u2019d given Night Shift and Splash two thumbs-down. George was upset with Pauline Kael. So we got giddy with the idea of poking a little fun at the critics. Later, I got to know Siskel and Ebert both and liked them. In the year Apollo 13 was nominated, I actually won the Directors Guild but was not nominated as a director at the Oscars, and Siskel on the red carpet went off mic and leaned into me and said, \u201cI think you make it look a little too easy.\u201d I took that as flattery of the best kind.\nIs there a film from your career that you wish more people would\u2019ve appreciated?\nI love The Paper. But it never got a foothold outside of six or seven cities that still had major newspapers. That was already a dying idea \u2014 small towns had lost their papers and so forth. It played like a $100 million movie in New York and Boston and Toronto and San Francisco and L.A. and Chicago. Everywhere else, it was a disaster.\nDo you consider any of your films a disappointment?\nThe Dilemma. It\u2019s the last comedy I made, and I liked doing comedies. But it was a shocker, and from the test audiences, you could just see it didn\u2019t have it. Vince Vaughn, Kevin James, Brian Grazer, Universal, people who do a lot of comedies, we all thought we had something here. And it turned out that infidelity was not funny to people. We were pretty smugly certain that it was. And it had some sequences I was really proud of. Channing Tatum gives me credit for teaching him and the world that he could be funny because he was great in this one sequence. Everybody worked real hard on it and believed in it. But it was an interesting example of being tone-deaf at that time.\nDo you want to go back to comedy? You were good at it.\nI\u2019m not sure that my tone is in alignment with what is commercial in terms of comedy. That\u2019s what I loved about being around Arrested Development. Those are ways for me to exercise the comedy muscles in a way that works. Live-action comedy is demanding something that isn\u2019t necessarily in my wheelhouse. And it doesn\u2019t travel very well, and global audiences mean more than ever. Physical comedy can travel. But not the kind of character comedies I like to do.\nDo you ever find yourself thinking in \u201cthe Ron Howard voice\u201d from Arrested Development?\nNo, I don\u2019t! But I love it when I bump into it online or as a meme. And that was so fun because I had always had the idea of a narrator, but Mitchell Hurwitz hadn\u2019t written it in the initial script. The visual style and the cutting pace and so forth had been born out of a project we had with Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg called Pop.com in \u201999 and 2000. We were trying to do shortform entertainment on the web. It was too early, the bandwidth wasn\u2019t there, and we spent on the wrong things. But we thought a lot about shortform entertainment. I was trying to think about the new grammar of reality television, and I thought that could be applied to a sitcom. I pitched that to Mitchell, and he said, \u201cI love that.\u201d\nDo you feel you\u2019ve been properly appreciated in your career as a director?\nYes. If you put on a lie detector, there might be a little squiggle because I sometimes feel that my origin story has caused some people to fold their arms and say, \u201cColor me skeptical.\u201d But I don\u2019t actually believe that\u2019s true because I think expectations are pretty high for me. My tone and voice might not be for everybody, but for a lot of people, it works.\nMore Conversations\n- Jason Isaacs Might Say Too Much\n- \u2018What You Think About Me Is None of My Business\u2019\n- David Lynch on His Memoir Room to Dream and Clues to His Films"

      "text": "Filled with excellent action and a lot of emotion, Solo: A Star Wars Story is going to surprise a lot of people. Despite its troubled production, it\u2019s ended up being incredibly fun and funny, with great characters, performances, and a huge range of Star Wars references to delight fans and non-fans alike.\nThe film follows the young Han Solo (Alden Ehrenreich), stuck on his homeworld Corellia, desperate to get away and explore the galaxy. Soon he teams up with a smuggler named Beckett (Woody Harrelson) to pull off a heist, which starts a chain reaction of events that lead him to Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover), the Millennium Falcon and, eventually, to becoming the Han Solo we see in A New Hope.\nThe key word is \u201ceventually.\u201d The whole film hinges on Ehrenreich\u2019s portrayal of a younger, still-developing version of the legendary character, and I\u2019m happy to report he nails it. The performance balances the wide-eyed wonder of a kid finally exploring the galaxy, Han\u2019s complex internal struggles, and the knowledge that this character will evolve into Harrison Ford\u2019s 1977 portrayal. To do all of that, Ehrenreich presents a version of Han that feels nuanced, measured, and starts a little shaky. Whether that\u2019s on purpose or not, it works because he\u2019s always growing at the same time Han is. There are times Ehrenreich is unrecognizable as Han Solo. Other times, he\u2019s the living embodiment of Harrison Ford. It\u2019s an impressive, slightly choppy performance, but one that wins you over quickly and smooths out over the course of the movie.\nThe rest of Solo follows that formula, too. Things start quickly, with an action scene of Han being chased on the streets. Then we\u2019re slammed with a lot of information about his upbringing, home planet, love life, and more before being whisked off to the next thing. It\u2019s a bit off-putting, but once the film solidifies and settles in, it\u2019s off to hyperspace.\nIt helps immeasurably that Solo is about more than just Han. Thankfully, writers Jon and Lawrence Kasdan, as well as director Ron Howard, make sure the film goes deeper than the title character. In addition to Han, every key character is given some kind of crucial emotional grounding. There\u2019s a reason for everyone to be there. For some it\u2019s love, for others it\u2019s freedom, but everyone has really strong, understandable motivations that somehow make them exist beyond what\u2019s on screen. The supporting characters in Solo give the film real heart and stakes, which in turn makes the action sequences more intense and exciting.\nBesides Chewbacca, of course, the most important characters to Han\u2019s journey are Beckett, and Qi\u2019ra, played by Emilia Clarke. Qi\u2019ra grew up with Han and though we only see a little of that, their extensive, complex relationship comes through. Beckett, on the other hand, is kind of everything Han wants to be: a worldly, gunslinging smuggler with a crew that respects him. As Han\u2019s tale weaves between both of those characters, they\u2019re practically both a devil and an angel on his shoulder, slowly molding him into the mix of hero and scoundrel that he\u2019ll one day become. As for Chewie, his blossoming friendship with Han is basically the heart of the movie; before Han meets his Wookiee friend, the movie doesn\u2019t feel\u2026 right. It\u2019s after the two pair off that the good-natured humor and tone of Star Wars truly begins to permeate the film.\nThere\u2019s also, of course, Lando. Going into the film, Donald Glover\u2019s take on the iconic Billy Dee Williams character was almost the only thing people wanted to talk about and, thankfully, he doesn\u2019t disappoint. It\u2019s obvious Glover is having a blast as Lando, oozing with confidence and humor. His role isn\u2019t as large as one might hope, but it\u2019s crucial, especially when combined with L3-37, a new droid played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge. L3 is an entirely new kind of droid, and one we haven\u2019t seen before in the franchise. She\u2019s self-aware, self-built, very helpful, very blunt, and incredibly hilarious (she has the best jokes in the movie). She\u2019s not only a worthy match with Lando, she changes how fans will think about droids in all of Star Wars as a whole.\nThe person responsible for bringing all this together is, of course, director Ron Howard. Much has been made about how Howard was a very safe choice after the firing of Phil Lord and Chris Miller, and that certainly shows in Solo. And the movie absolutely plays things very safe; it\u2019s rarely about more than what\u2019s on screen. There\u2019s very little cross-cutting between different places. The narrative isn\u2019t altogether predictable, but it\u2019s structured so you know a twist is coming, etc. However, by keeping all of those things relatively basic, Howard allows the characters to drive the action and story. And when the characters are this good, it works like a charm.\nTechnically, the creature and set design in Solo are some of the best we\u2019ve ever seen in Star Wars. Every single frame makes you want to pause and take it all in, thanks in part to cinematographer Bradford Young, who gives Solo a unique and almost sumptuous look to distinguish it from the rest of the franchise. There\u2019s the score by John Powell which, while not instantly recognizable as a classic, makes some bold, exciting new choices. Then, for fans, it\u2019s packed with Star Wars references. And I mean packed. Some are big and obvious, others are small and subtle, but it\u2019s a film that will make anyone who has studied Star Wars happy in one way or the other.\nBut even the prettiest, best sounding, most heartfelt movie ever wouldn\u2019t be a Star Wars movie without a few other things: huge action, high drama, and big surprises, and Solo has each of those in spades. The action scenes in Solo\u2014the Kessel Run in particular\u2014are edge-of-your-seat exciting, because they have real consequences. It\u2019s obvious why this specific story began to shape Han into the person he would become.\nThere\u2019s a moment in Solo where Han sits in the Falcon for the first time and the ship jumps to lightspeed. In a tight close-up from the side, we see his face light up with an infectious, palpable glee. For that moment, Han isn\u2019t Han, he\u2019s just a young kid getting to fly in space for the first time. I mention that shot because moments like it are what makes Solo so wonderful. This is a coming-of-age Star Wars movie.\nLet me be clear: Solo has flaws. But those flaws pale in comparison to the rest of it. This may not be your favorite Star Wars movie, and it definitely won\u2019t change what you think Star Wars can be. It will, however, remind you of everything you love about it and, hopefully, have you grinning like Han the first time he jumps to hyperspace.\nSolo: A Star Wars Story opens May 25."

      "text": "Earlier this year, you couldn\u2019t say the words \u201cRogue One\u201d without hearing the word \u201creshoots.\u201d The fact the filmmakers were going back to remake large scenes of the movie sparked massive debate and controversy online. But now, after months of silence, the director of the film has finally given his side.\nThat would be Gareth Edwards, the man who\u2014if you believed some of the more wild rumors\u2014nearly lost control of his very own movie. A quick recap: The prevailing rumor was the studio felt an early version of the movie was too dark, so they reshot a massive chunk of it, at least tens of millions of dollars worth, to give the film a more typical Star Wars feeling. This reportedly meant changing the ending, bringing in new people, and more, all of which went beyond the more typical reshoots on a Hollywood movie. Again, little of this was ever officially confirmed. (Read a full account in the stories linked at the bottom of this article.)\nWell, now that Rogue One is a done and week away from release, Edwards spoke to the Los Angeles Times and gave his own account of what went down.\nWhat happened was that I\u2019d say a third of the movie or more has this embedded documentary style to it, and as a result we shot hours and hours and days and days of material. Normally when you put a film together it goes together like A-B-C-D-E and you move on. Whereas we had so many permutations, so many different ways it could be constructed, it took longer in the edit to find the exact version.\nWe\u2019d always planned to do a pickup shoot but we needed a lot of time to figure out all this material and get the best out of it. So that pushed the entire schedule in a big way. Then Disney saw the film and reacted really well and they said, \u201cWhatever you need, we\u2019re going to support you.\u201d Our visual-effects shot count went from 600 to nearly 1,700, so suddenly we could do absolutely anything we wanted. To design 1,000 visual effects shots should take a year, so it was all hands to the pump and we never came up for air really until about a week ago.\nWhen asked about Tony Gilroy, the Oscar-nominated screenwriter and director who was rumored to be a major presence during the reshoots (ultimately he was given co-writing credit on the film with Chris Weitz), Edwards only said this:\nThings kept improving constantly and the film was getting better and better \u2014 and if you\u2019re improving it, you don\u2019t stop. I think any other movie you would say, \u201cThat\u2019ll do. We\u2019re going to get a hit.\u201d But \u201cStar Wars\u201d is going to live forever if you do it properly. We just can\u2019t let it go. You\u2019ve got keep going until they prise it out of your hands.\nMaking \u201cStar Wars\u201d is a team sport, really. You can\u2019t make these massive movies completely on your own. Even from the costumes to the guns to the ships to the VFX, it\u2019s a real team effort.\nThe Times also spoke to Rogue One star Riz Ahmed, who put things quite nicely:\nThere were a ton of reshoots. But if people want to read anything into that, I\u2019d encourage them to read into it the guts it takes to unpick stitching rather than just try to embroider over it, to make it right. I admire [Lucasfilm President] Kathleen [Kennedy] and Gareth and the whole team for having the guts to go, \u2018Let\u2019s reopen this. Let\u2019s do some of this again.\u2019 I think it\u2019s because they really care \u2014 and hopefully that\u2019s something that shows when people see the film.\nAnd ultimately, that\u2019s going to be the big test. If the movie is good and audiences like it, no matter how much was changed, by whom, or how much it cost, it won\u2019t matter. We\u2019ll find out next week if it was all worth it when Rogue One: A Star Wars Story hits theaters. And read more of the great interview below."

Hiddleston confirmed \u201cthe whole cast\u201d of Loki\u2019s first season will return for season two on an episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live. In December, we got a very, very brief tease of season two.\nEcho\nRelease date: November 29, 2023 (On Disney+)\nThis spinoff from the Hawkeye series will follow Echo, a deaf martial artist, as played by actress Alaqua Cox. Devery Jacobs (Reservation Dogs) co-stars. Echo officially began filming on May 24, according to a tweet by series creator Marion Dayre.

X-Men \u201897 is a revival of the classic \u201890s animated show, bringing back the same style, stories and yes, theme song, of the iconic series. (See more: X-Men \u201897 Looks Like a Nostalgic Blast From the Past)\nIronheart\nRelease date: 2024 (On Disney+)\nWith Tony Stark gone, the MCU needs a new super-genius inventor. Enter teenage prodigy Riri Williams (played by Dominique Thorne), who creates a brand new, ultra-advanced armored suit. Other cast members include Anthony Ramos (In the Heights) as the villain the Hood and Lyric Ross (This Is Us). Chinaka Hodge (TNT\u2019s Snowpiercer) is attached as the head writer, and Black Panther director Ryan Coogler is an executive producer alongside Marvel\u2019s Kevin Feige and others. Manny Montana (Good Girls) has joined the cast of Marvel\u2019s Ironheart in an undisclosed role as well as Han Solo himself, Alden Ehrenreich.\nAgatha: Coven of Chaos\nRelease date: Winter 2024 (On Disney+)\nThis spinoff from WandaVision will star Kathryn Hahn as her fan-favorite character Agatha Harkness. Joe Locke (Heartstopper) and Aubrey Plaza (Hahn\u2019s Parks and Recreation co-star, among her other many credits) are also in the cast, as is Patti LuPone. (A second WandaVision spin-off, this one focusing on Paul Bettany\u2019s Vision, is also reportedly in the works.)\nCaptain America: Brave New World\nRelease date: August 26, 2024 (in Theaters)\nWe\u2019ve got a new Captain America, so it was inevitable that we\u2019d be getting a new Cap movie. Anthony Mackie will appear in the title role. Harrison Ford was announced to take over the role of General Thaddeus Ross and will make his debut in this release.\nDaredevil: Born Again\nRelease date: Spring 2024 (On Disney+)\nCharlie Cox and Vincent D\u2019Onofrio will return as Daredevil and Kingpin for an 18-episode Disney+ series. Jon Bernthal has signed on to reprise his role as the Punisher. Things remain uncertain for Foggy and Karen.\nThunderbolts\nRelease date: December 20, 2024 (In theaters)\nMarvel Studios is readying a movie based on the comic Thunderbolts and director Jake Schreier has been tapped to bring it to life. This film marks the end of Phase Five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Steven Yeun (Nope) signed on for an undisclosed role\nBlade\nRelease date: February 14, 2025 (In theaters)\nDisney hasn\u2019t revealed much about this reboot of the franchise that features a badass vampire-hunter who is also a vampire, but we know that it stars two-time Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali, who also played Cornell \u201cCottonmouth\u201d Stokes in Netflix Marvel series Luke Cage. We also know Blade appeared (or at least his voice did) in the end credits of The Eternals. After losing director Bassam Tariq, who would have been the first U.S.-Pakistani person to helm a Marvel Studios film, Blade was put on pause, and its release date was shifted. But now it has a new director in place: Lovecraft Country\u2019s Yann Demange, as well as a writer in Michael Starrbury, so the September 2024 date looks ever more likely.\nDeadpool 3\nRelease date: May 3, 2024 (In Theaters)\nRyan Reynolds\u2019 \u201cmerc with the mouth\u201d is set to appear in Disney\u2019s first R-rated film following the company\u2019s completed acquisition of Fox assets. Oh, and did you happen to hear that Hugh Jackman\u2019s Wolverine is also appearing in this one? Unless you are cut off from all social media, you no doubt caught that announcement.\nDeadpool 3 writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wenick spoke with Den of Geek about how Deadpool\u2019s move to the MCU will not affect the feel of the movie. Or, in Wernick\u2019s words: \u201cDeadpool\u2019s gonna be Deadpool.\u201d Reese also said that Disney has been more than willing to ensuring the franchise keeps its core identity. Shawn Levy (Free Guy) is directing.\nFantastic Four\nRelease date: May 2, 2025 (In theaters)\nPhase Six of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, kicks off with the MCU debut of Marvel\u2019s most famous family. Jon Watts was scheduled to directbut he is no longer doing that\u2014Matt Shakaman of WandaVision is now in the chair\u2014and though we saw John Krasinski as Mr. Fantastic in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, there\u2019s no guarantee he returns.\nAvengers: The Kang Dynasty\nRelease date: May 1, 2026 (In theaters)\nSince neither Phase Four or Phase Five ended with Avengers movies, Phase Six will end with two, back to back. The first is The Kang Dynasty, a title which heavily suggests that Kang (Jonathan Majors) will play a major role. Destin Daniel Cretton (Shang-Chi) will direct.\nAvengers: Secret Wars\nRelease date: May 7, 2027 (In theaters)\nIt all comes down to this. Phase Six, and the whole Phase 4-6 arc of the Multiverse Saga, ends with Secret Wars. We don\u2019t know anything about the plot other than the comics that the title is based on; Marvel veteran Michael Waldron (Loki, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness) is writing the script.\nArmor Wars\nRelease date: Unknown (In theaters)\nThis project\u2014originally slated for a Disney+ series, but now getting the feature film treatment\u2014will follow James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) as he tracks down stolen tech that allows criminals to replicate Iron Man technology.\nAlso: Marvel slotted several other projects for Phase Six that take place alongside Fantastic Four and the Avengers films. There are two in fall 2024, two in winter 2024, one in winter 2025, two in spring 2025 and two in summer 2025. Some of those are probably\u2026\nUnscheduled But Probably Still Happening Shows & Movies\nMoon Knight Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nMoon Knight himself, Oscar Isaac, was recently spotted in Egypt and teased that a second season of his show could be on the way. Marvel and Disney have yet to confirm.\nMarvel Zombies\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nThis new animated show is loosely spun out from a breakout episode of What If? that saw MCU heroes battling a zombie apocalypse.\nSpider-Man: Freshman Year\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nDisney says this new animated series follows Peter Parker \u201con his way to becoming Spider-Man in the MCU, with a journey unlike we\u2019ve ever seen and a style that celebrates the character\u2019s early comic book roots.\u201d\nWhat if\u2026? Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nThe speculative animated series and its omnipresent narrator the Watcher will return with an all-new season. The show\u2019s creators say next season will focus on new stories, new heroes, and \u201clots of fun.\u201d Though the trailer still hasn\u2019t been released, the Marvel Animation Panel at San Diego Comic Con revealed some Phase 4 characters that will be in the show.\nUntitled Wakanda Series\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nNot much is known yet about this show set in Black Panther\u2019s home country.\nUntitled Shang-Chi sequel\nRelease date: Unknown (In theaters)\nShang-Chi\u2019s debut movie was compelling, exciting and fun. It also made a ton of money, so a sequel is inevitable. That the film\u2019s director is making Avengers: The Kang Dynasty does throw it into limbo a bit.\nUntitled Wonder Man series\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nMarvel Studios has announced that it\u2019s moving ahead with a Wonder Man series. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings director Destin Daniel Cretton is attached to helm and Brooklyn 99 writer Andrew Guest (who also produced Hawkeye) is on board to showrun the series. On October 31, the title star was announced: genre favorite Yayha Abdul-Mateen II.\nUntitled mutants movie\nRelease date: Unknown (In theaters)\nNow that Disney owns the old Fox assets that included all the \u201cmutant\u201d Marvel superheroes, you can very likely count on characters like the X-Men making an MCU debut.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "At a Glance:\nDoctor Who ended the eras of both Chris Chibnall as series showrunner and Jodie Whittaker as the 13th Doctor in 2022 with \u201cThe Power of the Doctor,\u201d bringing to a close a three-season, three-special run.\nWhittaker\u2019s replacement is returning star David Tennant. He will play the official 14th incarnation of the Doctor under returning showrunner Russell T. Davies, who revived Doctor Who in 2005 and managed the series until 2009.\nTennant will appear in three specials in November 2023 to coincide with the 60th anniversary of Doctor Who on November 23.\nHe\u2019ll be joined by returning characters Donna Noble and Wilfred Mott, who were played by Catherine Tate and Bernard Cribbins in season four of Doctor Who. Neil Patrick Harris will play a new villain, while Heartstopper\u2019s Yasmin Finney will play a character named Rose.\nTennant will be succeeded by Sex Education\u2019s Ncuti Gatwa as the 15th Doctor. His announcement in May 2022 makes him the first Black male actor to play the character on-screen.\nGatwa will star in Doctor Who\u2019s 14th season, set to air some time in 2024.\nMillie Gibson will co-star as the 15th Doctor\u2019s companion.\nGame of Thrones star Indira Varma will play a mysterious character known as \u201cthe Duchess.\u201d\nDoctor Who\u2019s beloved tradition of doing a Christmas Special\u2014no more New Year\u2019s Day Specials, in other words\u2014will return in 2023, with another confirmed for 2024.\nComedian Sooz Kempner will star in Doom\u2019s Day, a new transmedia Doctor Who campaign tied into the anniversary. She\u2019ll play Doom, the titular intergalactic assassin, who has found herself hunted by Death itself\u2014and must use a purloined vortex manipulator with a day\u2019s worth of time-jumping charge to find the Doctor and save herself.\nThis post was last updated 5/30/23.\nWhat\u2019s Been Going on in Doctor Who?\nThree Doctor Who specials aired out the last days of Jodie Whittaker\u2019s time as the Doctor in 2022. \u201cEve of the Daleks\u201d saw the Doctor and her companions Dan (introduced in the prior 13th season, known as Doctor Who: Flux) and Yaz facing the titular iconic monsters in a time loop paradox. \u201cLegend of the Sea Devils\u201d revived the classic \u201870s monsters for a new adventure, while \u201cPower of the Doctor\u201d saw the 13th Doctor face off against the Master in an adventure that ultimately saw her mortally wounded, returning her companions to contemporary Earth while she regenerated into a new body.\nWhy Is David Tennant the Doctor Again? Is David Tennant Playing the 10th Doctor?\nWhittaker regenerated not into previously announced new Doctor Ncuti Gatwa, but David Tennant, who played the official 10th incarnation of the Time Lord from Christmas 2005 to New Year\u2019s Day 2010, before reprising the role for Doctor Who\u2019s 50th anniversary special, \u201cThe Day of the Doctor,\u201d in 2013.\nWhile this marks his first return on-screen in the series since then, Tennant will not be playing the 10th Doctor, but the official 14th incarnation\u2014and the character will be aware that they are both using a familiar form and are a new entity. Aside from the fact that Tennant is arguably the most popular actor to take on the role, so bringing him back for the 60th anniversary makes sense, there\u2019s plenty of reasons Doctor Who can come up with as to why the Doctor\u2019s regenerative process decided to re-use an old identity, more of which you can read about here.\nWhen Will Doctor Who Return in 2023?\nDoctor Who will return for three special episodes in November 2023, set to air in celebration of the series\u2019 60th anniversary.\nWhat Is Doctor Who\u2019s 60th Anniversary Special About?\nAside from Tennant returning as the Doctor, he\u2019ll be joined by former companions Donna Noble and Wilfred Mott, played by Catherine Tate and Bernard Cribbins (the actor\u2019s last role prior to his passing in July 2022) in Doctor Who\u2019s fourth season. Donna exited the series as a regular character after an adventure lead to her needing to have her memory wiped by the 10th Doctor, forgetting her time alongside him lest her mind face grievous harm, so just how Donna will play into the the story remains to be seen.\nThe Doctor and Donna will face a mysterious new adversary, played by Neil Patrick Harris, and will be joined in the specials by Yasmin Finney as a new character named Rose. How Finney\u2019s Rose might connect to the other famous Rose of Doctor Who, Billie Piper\u2019s Rose Tyler, also remains to be seen.\nIs There a Trailer for Doctor Who\u2019s 60th Anniversary?\nThe first premiered at the end of \u201cThe Power of the Doctor,\u201d and you can watch it above. The second premiered in December and you can watch it here:\nWhen Will Ncuti Gatwa Become the Doctor?\nGatwa is briefly seen in the trailer for Doctor Who\u2019s 60th anniversary, so will presumably follow the long tradition of new Doctors appearing in the final moments of their predecessor\u2019s last episodes to become the 15th Doctor. The BBC has announced that Gatwa will appear as the Doctor first \u201cover the festive season\u201d in 2023, before he takes over full-time in a new season of the show after that.\nIs There a Doctor Who Season 14 Release Date?\nThere\u2019s no current release date for season 14 of Doctor Who, but it is expected to be broadcast some time in 2024.\nWhere Is Doctor Who Streaming in the U.S. and UK?\nCurrently, the first 13 seasons of the revived Doctor Who are streaming on the BBC iPlayer in the UK; in the U.S., the revived series streams exclusively on HBO Max. In both countries, episodes from the classic era of the show are available through Britbox.\nThis will change in 2023, at least in the U.S. The BBC and Disney have announced that as part of a new deal, Doctor Who will stream exclusively worldwide on Disney+, except for in the UK and Ireland, where it will still stream on the BBC iPlayer and BBC One. It\u2019s currently unknown if this will affect Doctor Who\u2019s place on BBC America, where it currently airs in the U.S..\nDoes Disney Co-Own Doctor Who Now?\nA report in the wake of the BBC/Disney announcement from British paper the Telegraph alleged that the deal will also see Disney contribute finances to help create the show, and while the series\u2019 creative team will still hold control of the series primarily, the deal will allow Disney some level of say in the creative decisions for the series\u2014as well as allowing access to talent or \u201ccinematic production moments\u201d previously inaccessible due to the BBC\u2019s budget for the show.\nNone of this has been confirmed by the BBC, however. The announcement strictly focused on Disney\u2019s acquisition of Doctor Who\u2019s streaming rights, and did not mention any co-owning. The new era of the series will be made for the BBC by Bad Wolf Studios, created by former Doctor Who producer Julie Gardner and former BBC Controller of Fiction Jane Tranter\u2014which is now owned by Sony Pictures Television, after the studio took a majority stake in Bad Wolf in December 2021. The series was previously made by BBC Studios directly.\nIn January, Davies did say that Doctor Who is now working with a bigger budget, telling GQ that Disney\u2019s involvement came about as part of \u201cthe BBC\u2019s notion to go for a streamer to invest in the show worldwide \u2026 We\u2019re not on the budget level with Star Wars and the Marvel shows, [but] it\u2019s better than it was \u2026 We\u2019re not allowed to talk about budget\u2026 but it\u2019s more than I\u2019ve ever had to work with.\u201d\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "Until Daisy Ridley picks up her yellow lightsaber once again, any time she releases a movie, she\u2019s going to be asked about Rey. She can play a swimmer, she can play a window cleaner, it doesn\u2019t matter. People want to know what\u2019s going on with Star Wars.\nRidley is currently promoting a movie called Cleaner (where she literally plays a window cleaner who just so happens to be ex-military) and so she\u2019s once again having to provide an update on the Rey movie. First announced back in 2023, the Lucasfilm project is set after Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and brings back Ridley as Rey, who\u2019ll work to create a new Jedi order. Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy is directing and while several writers, and we do mean several, have tackled the project, the latest one to come on board is George Nolfi (The Bourne Ultimatum, The Adjustment Bureau, Ocean\u2019s 12, Elevation).\nSpeaking to ComicBook, Ridley had nothing but praise for Nofli, though she hasn\u2019t read his work yet. \u201cI have not read the latest script, but I know what\u2019s happening, and I know the story, and I think what feels really good is that George is a phenomenal writer,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we\u2019re making sure that this story is the best way, this script is the best way to tell the story, and I think it will be worthwhile for everyone watching it, and I am very excited, yeah.\u201d\nThat sounds good! The story is good, the writer is good, they\u2019re taking their time, and that\u2019s the deal. She added another wrinkle talking to Screenrant, revealing she\u2019s got another movie coming up so the Rey movie isn\u2019t the next thing she\u2019s working on. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be the next thing I go to production on because I\u2019m supposed to be doing\u2014oh no, it\u2019s not, because I\u2019m doing something next month, very excitingly,\u201d Ridley said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not the next thing production-wise, but the script is being written and I\u2019m very excited.\u201d\nDid you hear she\u2019s excited? We\u2019re excited too! Collider took a slightly different spin with the star, asking about how involved she is behind the scenes with the film. This is a little less on message but, can you blame her? She\u2019s doing a fantastic job talking about something she contractually shouldn\u2019t be talking about.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019d be a producer on it, but I certainly have been very involved,\u201d Ridley said. \u201cI\u2019m involved in, well, not very involved, but I\u2019m involved in as much as I know what\u2019s going on, I know the story, I know what\u2019s going on with the script, so I\u2019m aware of all that. And I think what\u2019s been really wonderful over the last few years is being more involved from the start to finish, really coming to set knowing this is the absolute best way we can tell this story. These are the best actors for the job. This is the best crew for the job. Having that confidence is so lovely. And it\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t have that before, but I\u2019m much more cognizant of it now. So in that way, I\u2019m looking forward to turning up, really knowing the ins and outs of what the journey has been, and we\u2019re arriving at the absolute best place to tell this particular story.\u201d\nAnd, really, all jokes aside, that\u2019s all we want. The best possible movie. And if the movie isn\u2019t going to be great, then don\u2019t make it. Don\u2019t further tarnish any Star Wars legacies. It certainly sounds like Ridley is aware of all that and trying her hardest to be\u2014 yes\u2014excited about the possibilities.\nThe next Star Wars movie to hit theaters will be The Mandalorian and Grogu in summer 2026. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s next after that, though it could be this movie, it could be Shawn Levy\u2019s movie, or something else. Unclear, the future is.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "\u201cStar Wars! Nothing but Star Wars! Give me those Star Wars! Don\u2019t let them end\u2026\u201d Just as Bill Murray said it in 1978, we\u2019re still saying it today. Star Wars is everywhere these days, with multiple movies and TV shows in the works from Disney and Lucasfilm. This article will give you the most up-to-date Star Wars release dates so you know exactly when every new Star Wars movie or Disney+ show will arrive.\nWhat are the next three movies? What TV shows are coming up? Have any TV shows or movies been canceled? What are people saying about what\u2019s next? We\u2019ve got you covered on all things in a galaxy far, far away.\nThis post was last updated on 9/13/2023.\nWhat\u2019s the next Star Wars movie?\nSharmeen Obaid-Chioy\u2019s New Jedi Order Film Film\nRelease Date: TBD, but May 26, 2026, December 18, 2026 or December 17, 2027 (In Theaters)\nAt Star Wars Celebration 2023 in London, Lucasfilm announced that three Star Wars movies are now in the works.\nJames Mangold (Indiana Jones 5) will direct a film 25,000 years before any known Star Wars timeline about the first Jedi to use the Force.\nDave Filoni will direct a film that\u2019s kind of the Star Wars Disney+ Avengers, telling the story of a climactic event meeting the stories of The Book of Boba Fett, The Mandalorian, Ahsoka and more in the time between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens.\nAnd Sharmeen Obaid-Chioy will direct a film set 15 years after the events of The Rise of Skywalker following Rey (Daisy Ridley) as she creates a New Jedi Order.\nThis last one, we think, is the film that Damon Lindelof (Lost, The Leftovers, Watchmen) was co-writingwith Justin Britt-Gibson before departing the project. Steven Knight is now reportedly writing.\nA week after the news of these films first broke, it began to seem like the Rey project by Obaid-Chioy could be the first one out of the gate. However, in June, Disney shuffled its release schedule and moved its December 2025 Star Wars movie to May 2026, and added a third Star Wars movie to the schedule in December 2026. So maybe these three movies are on those dates. We\u2019ll see.\nUpcoming Star Wars release dates\nThese shows and movies have all been officially announced and are in various stages of production, even if we don\u2019t know when they will definitely come out.\nStar Wars: Ahsoka\nRelease Date: Now Playing (On Disney+)\nThe first full live-action Ahsoka Tano show from co-creator Dave Filoni is finally here. Rosario Dawson is, of course, returning. And our first look at footage confirmed that actress Natasha Liu Bordizzo has been cast as Sabine Wren; more recently, Eman Esfandi was confirmed as Ezra Bridger. At Star Wars Celebration this year we learned Mary Elizabeth Winstead is playing Hera Syndulla, Lars Mikkelsenis playing Grand Admiral Thrawn and Wes Chatham is his right-hand man.\nWhat does that all mean? Well, in the first teaser trailer, you can see she\u2019ll make good onthe Star Wars Rebels finale and go after Thrawn. And what about the fact she knows Luke Skywalker now? And how does Ray Stevenson\u2019s lightsaber-wielding character fit in?\nThe show is now airing on Disney+ and here you can read our weekly recaps:\nEpisode 1, \u201cMaster and Apprentice: and Episode 2, \u201cToil and Trouble\u201d\nEpisode 6, premiering September 19\nEpisode 7, premiering September 26\nEpisode 7, premiering October 3\nStar Wars: Skeleton Crew\nRelease Date: 2023 (On Disney+)\nCreated by Spider-Man Homecoming/Far From Home/No Way Home director Jon Watts along with writer Chris Ford, this mystery Star Wars show is now currently in development. The title for the show was released during the Star Wars Celebration, and was previously internally referred as \u201cGrammar Radio.\u201d Celebration also revealed its headlining star, Jude Law.\nSet after the events of Return of the Jedi, Skeleton Crew is described as an adventure in the mold of Amblin adventures of the 1980s. The show will be about seeing the galaxy through the eyes of children (but it is not a kids show), and will follow a group of children who get lost in the galaxy and try to find their way home. Jon Watts explained that the series will take place during the same time period as the upcoming Ahsoka series and The Mandalorian.\nFilming on the series began in 2022 and ended in early 2023. And though not much is know about what happens on the show,it has been revealed that The Daniels, the Oscar-winning directors of Everything Everywhere All At Once, directed an episode. Ditto David Lowery, who did the film The Green Knight. Read more about the show here.\nio9 saw the first footage at Star Wars Celebration 2023 and you can read about it here. Three of the main stars of the show are played by Ravi Cabot-Conyers, Kyriana Kratter, and Robert Timothy Smit. Rumors suggest it could debut in November or December 2023.\nStar Wars: The Acolyte\nRelease Date: 2024 (On Disney+)\nRussian Doll co-creator Leslye Headland will be the first person to bring the excellent High Republic timeline into live-action with this show, long rumored to star Amandla Stenberg before an actual confirmation finally arrived at San Diego Comic-Con 2022\u2014one of few Star Wars bits of news to emerge from the convention.\nIn an interview in 2022, Headland revealed the show would be about 100 years before the events of The Phantom Menace. \u201cA lot of those characters haven\u2019t even been born yet,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a look at the political and personal and spiritual things that came up in a time period that we don\u2019t know much about. My question when watching The Phantom Menace was always like, \u2018Well, how did things get to this point?\u2019 How did we get to a point where a Sith lord can infiltrate the Senate and none of the Jedi pick up on it? Like, what went wrong? What are the scenarios that led us to this moment?\u201d\nIn an interview released later, Headland spoke about her goals for the series. For Headland, above all else The Acolyte is a mystery, and that mystery is figuring out what is going on in this peak period. It was also suggested that The Acolyte will bring more elements from the Expanded Universe to canon, but what parts that will be incorporated will remain to be seen.\nIn September 2022, both Jodie Turner-Smith and Squid Game\u2019s Emmy-winning Lee Jung-Jae joined the cast, with an official announcement in November adding Carrie-Anne Moss, Manny Jacinto, and others to the roster. The first image, which you see above, was released in November and you can read about the first footage here, which was shown at Star Wars Celebration 2023.\nAnd no, despite what bullcrap rumors you may have been reading online, the show has not been canceled.\nAndor: Season 2\nRelease Date: August 2024 (On Disney+)\nSeason one of Tony Gilroy\u2019s Rogue One prequel starring Diego Luna showed an excitingly different side of Star Wars. Season two will reportedly be spread across the four years leading up to Rogue One, with four episodes covering each year in Cassian Andor\u2019s life until that fateful point. Filming began in late 2022.\nAt Star Wars Celebration 2023, Gilroy announced the show should be out in August 2024 and showed fans the first footage from the season. Read about it here. Plus, the final episodes of the season/series will take place just days before Rogue One, leading right into that story.\nOne minor hiccup though, due to the Writer\u2019s Guild strike, showrunner and head writer Tony Gilroy left his duties show in May 2023. He\u2019s unlikely to return until the Writer\u2019s Strike is over, which could cause a delay.\nStar Wars: A Droid Story\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nLucasfilm Animation is teaming up with Industrial Light and Magic for this streaming show that will \u201cintroduce us to a new hero, guided by legendary duo R2-D2 and C-3PO.\u201d We don\u2019t know anything beyond that and there hasn\u2019t been a significant update in years, which could be a good thing or bad thing.\nStar Wars: Lando\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nWay back in December 2020, Disney announced a bunch of Star Wars TV shows. Among them was a Lando show which, at the time, was going to be made by Dear White People creator Justin Simien. After that, things went quiet for about three years. Then,in an April 2023 article, Donald Glover hinted that he\u2019s still interested and it\u2019s still possible in the works. A May 2023 interview with Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy confirmed it\u2019s still in the works.\nThe first significant update in almost three years came in July when news broke that Simien has been off the project since he started working on Haunted Mansion, and not only is Donald Glover going to star in the series, he\u2019s co-writing it with his brother Stephen.\nUntitled Taika Waititi Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nIn May 2020, news broke that Oscar-winning director of Thor: Ragnarok would be helming and co-writing along with Krysty Wilson-Cairns. \u201cTaika\u2019s approach to Star Wars will be fresh, unexpected, and \u2026 unique,\u201d Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said. \u201cHis enormous talent and sense of humor will ensure that audiences are in for an unforgettable ride.\u201d\nThere was a time when this was likely to be the next Star Wars film but, after Star Wars Celebration 2023, it seems like it\u2019s now on the back burner. That was confirmed by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy who said the Oscar-winner is still working on the film, it\u2019s just going slowly.\nIn the past, Waititi has discussed some broad ideas of what he wants to do with his upcoming film. Read those below.\nTaika Waititi Doesn\u2019t Want Star Wars to Rely on Legacies\nAre You as Confused About Taika Waititi\u2019s Star WarsMovie as We Are?\nUntitled Dave Filoni Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nWe mentioned this one above but, at some point, Dave Filoni will be directing a film that is meant to be a climactic event wrapping up stories that have begun on shows he\u2019s involved with such as The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, The Book of Boba Fett, Skeleton Crew and others.\nUntitled James Mangold Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nThis was one of the three films announced at Star Wars Celebration but, like Filoni\u2019s, isn\u2019t likely to be next. This one is set 25,000 years before the original trilogy and tells the story of the first person to use the Force.\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s about, I want to be part of the saga, but I also don\u2019t want to be holding so much lore in the air that you can hardly tell a story,\u201d Mangold told io9 when asked about this film. \u201cAnd what I really wanted to do\u2026was just can we make a kind of the Ten Commandments of the Force, you know? A kind of origin story of how the Force came to be known, understood, wielded, and harnessed.\u201d We love this idea so much we even wrote about it.\nStar Wars Movies and TV Shows That Are Currently Unscheduled and Haven\u2019t Been Officially Announced, But We Think Are Still Happening\nThe Mandalorian Season 4\nRelease Date: TBD\nWith The Mandalorian Season 3 now in the books, all eyes look ahead to season 4. However, the season has not yet been officially announced. Unofficially though, series creator Jon Favreau said he\u2019s already written a fourth season which he probably wouldn\u2019t have done just for fun. It\u2019s coming. It\u2019s just a matter of when, especially with writers and actors on strike.\nThe Book of Boba Fett Season 2\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nThe Book of Boba Fett season one ended with the implication that we\u2019d see more of these character in the future. But alas, there has been no official announcement\u2026 yet. Dive into the making-of season one while we wait and ponder the words of executive producer Robert Rodriguez who said he knows when the character is coming back, but he can\u2019t say when.\nUntitled Shawn Levy Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nShawn Levy, the prolific director and producer behind Stranger Things, Night at the Museum, and Free Guy is gearing up to develop a film in a galaxy far far away. He\u2019ll focus on that after completing Deadpool 3, which stars Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman.\nStar Wars Movies and TV Shows That Are Currently Unscheduled and Probably NOT Going To Happen\nStar Wars: Rangers of the New Republic\nOriginally announced alongside shows like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ahsoka, and Andor, Rangers of the New Republic was rumored to be Cara Dune\u2019s show which would tie into The Mandalorian and Book of Boba Fett. However, with actress Gina Carano no longer a part of Star Wars, word on the street is this will no longer be happening. Nothing is official though.\nUntitled Rian Johnson Trilogy\nLet\u2019s be honest. Do we think this is happening anymore? Probably not. Rian Johnson has moved on to other things. But, until we hear otherwise (and no one is officially saying), we\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t mention that before the divisive release of The Last Jedi, Lucasfilm officially said Johnson would make his very own trilogy. It hasn\u2019t officially been canceled yet but, in a new interview, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy suggested that it\u2019s been placed on the back burner as Johnson does other things. With Johnson\u2019s next film, Glass Onion, set for release in late 2022 though, he\u2019s been quoted saying he still hopes these movies happen. So do we.\nStar Wars: Rogue Squadron\nFor several years, Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins\u2019 film about pilots in the Star Wars universe has been earmarked as the next film. Well, that\u2019s no longer the case. After months of rumors suggesting it might move off its 2023 release date, Disney officially took it off the schedule. On December 13 2022, Jenkins said the movie is still in \u201cactive development\u201d but recent news suggests it\u2019s dead. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy disagrees, saying in May 2023 it\u2019s still on the books.\nUntitled Kevin Feige Movie\nMarvel Studios President Kevin Feige is best known for helping create the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But as much as he loves Marvel, he loves Star Wars even more. And so it was exciting to hear that he was producing a Star Wars movie and even recruited Loki and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness writer Michael Waldron to help him. Feige doesn\u2019t like to even acknowledge this project though and in a 2022 interview, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy also tiptoed around the project\u2019s existence. Then, a few weeks before Star Wars Celebration 2023, we learned the project is likely dead.\nFor more, check out io9\u2019s list of every canceled (or re-worked) Disney Star Wars project.\nWant more io9 news?
