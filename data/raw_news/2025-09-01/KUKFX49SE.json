  "title": "New Galaxy S26 Edge battery leak keeps piling on the bad news",
  "description": "We've heard plenty of claims regarding the Galaxy S26 Edge's battery. Now, a regulatory filing hints at more battery capacity details.",
  "content": "The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge might be the most polarizing Android phone of 2025. The device has a very slim and light design, but this form factor comes at the expense of battery life. We\u2019re expecting a bigger battery in the Galaxy S26 Edge, but it sounds like those expecting a huge upgrade might be disappointed.\n\nSamLover and SamMobile report that the apparent Galaxy S26 Edge battery has passed through the website of China\u2019s 3C regulatory body. A screenshot posted by SamLover reveals a 4,078mAh rated capacity. This hints at a typical capacity of 4,200mAh.\n\nThis listing comes some time after we heard conflicting rumors about the Galaxy S26 Edge battery, pointing to either a 4,200mAh or 4,400mAh capacity. However, this latest leak suggests a modest upgrade.\n\nColleague Ryan Haines wasn\u2019t very happy with the Galaxy S25 Edge battery life in his review. Ryan said the phone had \u201cmediocre\u201d endurance, and that battery life \u201cdropped like a stone\u201d when the device was subjected to slightly more demanding workloads. So a ~300mAh increase would be welcomed, even if it isn\u2019t a big upgrade.\n\nThese aren\u2019t the only Galaxy S26 Edge leaks we\u2019ve heard in recent months. The device is also tipped to be 5.5mm thick (0.3mm thinner than the current model), so we could be getting a larger battery in an even slimmer form factor. Coincidentally, the iPhone 17 Air is also rumored to be 5.5mm thick. Nevertheless, I can\u2019t help but wonder how much more capacity you could squeeze into the S26 Edge if it retained the same thickness as the current Edge phone.",

Learn more.\nGalaxy S26 Edge leak reveals just how thin Samsung's next Edge could be\nAugust 6, 2025\n- A leaker has claimed that the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge will be 5.5mm thin.\n- This means it could be as thick as the rumored iPhone 17 Air and slightly thinner than the Galaxy S25 Edge.\n- The leaker also reiterated that the phone could have a 4,200mAh battery.\nNumerous leaks suggest that Samsung will replace the Galaxy S26 Plus with the Galaxy S26 Edge. This phone is expected to offer a thin form factor similar to that of the Galaxy S25 Edge, and we\u2019ve now got a better idea of what to expect.\nLeaker Ice Universe has claimed on Twitter that the Galaxy S26 Edge will be 5.5mm thick. That would make it 0.3mm thinner than the Galaxy S25 Edge, which measures 5.8mm thick. It would also be on par with the iPhone 17 Air\u2019s rumored thickness.\nThe tipster also reiterated previous claims that the new phone would have a 4,200mAh battery. That would be a small but welcome boost over the Galaxy S25 Edge\u2019s 3,900mAh battery. It would also be a notable achievement given the apparent thinner design. This capacity would also be notably bigger than the iPhone 17 Air\u2019s rumored ~2,900mAh battery.\nColleague Ryan Haines praised the current model\u2019s slim and light design, build quality, and \u201csolid\u201d main camera in his Galaxy S25 Edge review. However, Ryan criticized the phone\u2019s \u201cmediocre\u201d battery life, poor thermals, slow charging, and lack of a tele camera. It\u2019s no wonder that he gave the device three out of five stars. So we really hope the Galaxy S26 Edge isn\u2019t a repeat performance.\nThis news also comes after we recently discovered evidence that Samsung could shake up the Galaxy S26 series branding. The evidence suggests we could see a Galaxy S26 Pro, Galaxy S26 Edge, and Galaxy S26 Ultra. The Pro model would replace the base S26, while the S26 Edge would apparently replace the S26 Plus.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

Galaxy Fold 7, Flip 7, S25 Ultra and Watch Ultra 2025\nLast updated: August 30th, 2025 at 11:59 UTC+02:00\nSamMobile has affiliate and sponsored partnerships, we may earn a commission.\nDon't hold hope for a silicon-carbon battery.\nReading time: 2 minutes\nSamsung launched the super-slim Galaxy S25 Edge with a 3,900mAh battery this year. Rumors have since emerged that the company may not just increase the capacity on its successor but also go with a silicon-carbon battery.\nNew information has surfaced that reveals this highly anticipated upgrade isn't happening, and that Samsung will stick with a lithium-ion battery for the Galaxy S26 Edge.\nSamsung's battery for the Galaxy S26 Edge, bearing part number EB-BS947ABY, has been certified by China's 3C body. The certification listing reveals some key details about this component.\nIt has a rated capacity of 4,078mAh which will be marketed as 4,200mAh. The 4,200mAh figure has been rumored several times already, so it's nicely to see that customers who were waiting for a larger battery on the device before they decided to pick one up will finally have one more reason to drop cash on Samsung's slim flagship.\nThe listing also reveals that this is a lithium-ion battery, not silicon-carbon. Samsung is yet to make a transition to this technology for its smartphones, which would allow for higher capacities without requiring more space inside the shell. The Edge series would be the perfect starting point as Samsung's aim is to make this lineup as slim as possible.\nPerhaps the company wishes to play it safe and if it can deliver a respectable increase in capacity while sticking with the tried and tested lithium-ion technology, it may be enough to push the transition to silicon-carbon down the road for a little while longer.\nAdnan Farooqui is a long-term writer at SamMobile.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nI test all the best Android phones every year, and these are the ones you should buy in 2025\nAugust 20, 2025\nIt\u2019s a funny thing, this idea of calling something the best. After all, everyone wants to think that their favorite of anything is the best \u2014 the best album, book, or cup of coffee \u2014 but that can\u2019t always be true. And, when you apply the idea of being the best to a category as wide open as Android phones, which can come in different shapes, sizes, and prices, the task becomes even greater.\nHowever, I think I have a pretty good idea of what makes an Android phone great. I test and review dozens of them every year, and I\u2019ve spent time with just about every phone you can get your hands on in the US (and even some that you can only buy elsewhere). And, across my many Android-fueled adventures, I\u2019ve learned to pick the qualities that make a phone worth buying. So, with that in mind, here\u2019s what I think are the best Android phones you can buy in 2025.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL: The best Android phone overall\n- Excellent build quality, refined design\n- Stunning display\n- Extensive update policy\n- Sharp, powerful cameras\n- Improved wired charging\n- Clever Gemini features\n- Tensor still runs warm\n- Confusing charging situation\n- Only 128GB base storage\nI remember when Google\u2019s Pixel phones felt like niche picks for the most dedicated Android fans. They paired clean, simple software with brilliant cameras and added a dash of fun Google design to the mix, and I always felt clever spotting one out in the wild. These days, the Pixel 9 Pro XL hangs its hat on many of the same features as its predecessors, but it\u2019s no longer a pick for those in the know \u2014 it\u2019s just the best Android phone that money can buy.\nI\u2019ve spent perhaps more time with the Pixel 9 Pro XL (and its smaller Pixel 9 Pro sibling) than anyone else at Android Authority, and it continues to find new ways to impress. Its updated design with smooth, shiny side rails and a camera bar that\u2019s become more of an island feels a little bit Apple-inspired, but in a way that makes me think the student has become the master. Granted, I\u2019ve always been a fan of Google\u2019s camera bar design, but it now feels polished and premium in a way that can stand with any other phone on the market.\nAnd, since we\u2019re already on the topic of the camera bar, let\u2019s dig into Google\u2019s impressive hardware a little further. The Pixel 9 Pro XL packs a 50MP primary sensor that\u2019s simply excellent, capturing plenty of detail and processing images with a very natural color profile thanks to the Tensor G4 chipset. Google\u2019s ultrawide and 5x optical telephoto sensor help to round out the setup with up to 30x zoom, while tricks like a revamped panorama mode and Add Me helped to earn the phone the title of best Android camera phone, too.\nWith an updated design, improved Tensor G4 chipset, and tons of AI features, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is Google's most complete phone to date.\nUpdates under the hood have helped to keep Google\u2019s top-end flagship at the front of my mind since it launched last fall. Its 16GB of RAM (with 4GB reserved for Gemini) and up to 1TB of storage space feel like clever future-proofing methods that will keep the Pixel 9 Pro XL near the top of the list as Google rolls out new AI-powered features like updates to the Pixel Studio, better support for Pixel Screenshots, and new capabilities for Gemini Live over the course of seven years of updates.\nEven the Pixel 9 Pro XL\u2019s battery and charging setup have taken a step forward, thanks in no small part to the combination of the more efficient Tensor G4 chipset and upgraded 37W wired speeds. I don\u2019t even mind that I needed to pick up Google\u2019s new USB-C Pixel charger, as I\u2019m still achieving close to two days of battery life between charges. And, with a starting price of $1,099 (or $999 for the Pixel 9 Pro), Google\u2019s best Pixel to date is a little more approachable than rivals from Samsung and Apple.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: The best ultra-tier Android phone\n- Premium materials\n- Great battery life\n- Solid cameras\n- Top-tier Snapdragon performance\n- Brilliant display\n- Excellent software policy\n- Downgraded S Pen\n- Mostly AI-based upgrades\n- Still no full Qi2 support\n- Can be uncomfortable to hold\n- Very expensive\nAs a Pixel fan, it\u2019s easy for me to hype up the Pixel 9 Pro XL as the best Android phone, but for many Samsung diehards, it\u2019s Galaxy or nothing. And, with the amount of power packed into the Galaxy S25 Ultra, I can see where they\u2019re coming from. If there\u2019s a spec you\u2019re looking for \u2014 solid charging, flexible cameras, ample RAM and storage \u2014 I\u2019d be willing to bet that Samsung\u2019s top-end option checks that box, which is why we\u2019re calling it the best ultra-tier Android phone.\nFrom the minute you take it out of the box, the Galaxy S25 Ultra feels like a tool that\u2019s ready to work. Its massive titanium frame protects panels of Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on both the front and back, and it continues to house the S Pen that\u2019s boosted productivity users since the days of the Galaxy Note lineup. Yes, Samsung simplified its built-in stylus a bit this year and took away a few features, but it remains the easiest way to take notes and doodle your way into Sketch to Image on the gorgeous 6.9-inch AMOLED panel.\nTo me, though, the Galaxy 25 Ultra stands out because of its four rear cameras. Like the previous generation, the start of the show is a huge 200MP sensor that covers much of the short-range zoom until the dual 3x and 5x optical telephoto sensors take over to push to 100x Space Zoom with a bit of help from some Galaxy AI processing. I prefer the Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s shots up to about the 10x zoom length, as there\u2019s barely any drop in quality, and the built-in camera filters make it easier to put some personality into your images right off the bat.\nSamsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra remains a productivity powerhouse with four rear cameras and a built-in S Pen.\nThe rest of Samsung\u2019s internals keep the Galaxy S25 Ultra well-positioned for the future, even if they come at a cost. Yes, this ultra-tier flagship starts at $1,299 \u2014 more than any of our other primary picks \u2014 but that\u2019s what you pay for an \u201cUltra\u201d phone, and for your money, you get an overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, 12GB of RAM across most configurations, frequently updated Galaxy AI features, and the fastest charging that you\u2019ll currently find on a Samsug phone at 45W. But, with seven years of updates, you can stretch your time with the Galaxy S25 Ultra further than most of its rivals.\nGoogle Pixel 9a: The best Android phone under $500\n- Solid, reliable cameras\n- Excellent update commitment\n- Clever AI-powered features\n- Great battery life\n- New, streamlined design\n- Excellent price\n- Relatively slow charging\n- Aging Gorilla Glass 3 (again)\n- Missing Pixel Screenshots\nAlthough I love spending time with the biggest, most expensive flagship Android phones, I think I\u2019m ready to tell you a little secret: They\u2019re not my favorites. Instead, I think the mid-range is the best section of the Android market right now \u2014 the phones that pick up a few flagship-level features without the painful price tag. There\u2019s no better example than the slimmed-down, sped-up Pixel 9a.\nIn almost every way, the Pixel 9a is just the type of addition the larger Pixel 9 series needed. It carries over most of the great AI-powered features I mentioned falling in love with on the Pixel 9 Pro XL, like access to the Pixel Studio, using Gemini to multitask across apps, and receiving the same regular Pixel Drops as its flagship siblings. It\u2019s a bummer to see Pixel Screenshots wind up on the cutting room floor, but I\u2019ve always found screenshot management in Photos good enough that I don\u2019t mind too much.\nI love the Pixel 9a's slimmed-down design and flagship-tier features at the $500 price point.\nPerhaps the one thing that initially surprised me about the Pixel 9a was its updated design. I\u2019d seen leaks and rumors that the camera bar was going away, and I didn\u2019t want to believe it. However, since spending time with Google\u2019s most affordable model, I\u2019ve come around to the benefit of simplicity. Google didn\u2019t just axe its iconic camera bar for fun, but instead found ways to slim the internal components to free up the space to embed its cameras deeper into the body. The result is a phone that doesn\u2019t collect dust around its cameras, but still manages to have the same Google-y personality I love about Pixels.\nAlong with that refreshed design, Google gave its mid-ranger several other updates to make the $500 price tag feel like even more of a bargain. It carries the same Tensor G4 chipset as its flagship siblings, and has swapped to a wider 48MP primary camera that lets in more light for Google\u2019s brilliant image processing to play with, and it\u2019s all topped off with the largest battery on any Pixel at 5,100mAh. I called it the best $500 phone I\u2019ve ever used, and I\u2019ll stand by that until the Pixel 10a comes around.\nCMF Phone 2 Pro: The best Android phone under $300\n- Incredibly low price\n- Amazing design and display\n- Cool modular features\n- Primary, ultrawide, and telephoto lenses\n- Good update commitment\n- Not good for a US-based buyer\n- Controversial Essential Key\nMoving down another step, it\u2019s remarkable to see how far the budget Android segment has come in just a few years. I remember bashing cheap options for their lame cameras, underwhelming charging, and bland designs, and now the CMF Phone 2 Pro feels like a breath of fresh air by comparison. It\u2019s the personality-packed follow-up to one of the most interesting phones of 2024, the CMF Phone 1, and it improves on almost every aspect of the modular design without jumping the price too much.\nOf course, I should point out that it still doesn\u2019t work well in the US. Yes, you\u2019ll get some band support, but it won\u2019t completely cover any of the big three networks. That said, if you live in a supported market, or can live with some signal inconsistency, there is absolutely no better phone under $300.\nThe modular design is the most fun I\u2019ve had with a phone since Samsung brought back the flip phone with its Galaxy Z Flip lineup. The design still works the same as it did on the first CMF Phone, having you release the back panel with a series of screws before attaching different accessories like a lanyard, card holder, or a kickstand.\nCMF's Phone 2 Pro builds on a quirky, modular design in a way that's still fun to switch up every day.\nI think the coolest accessory that the team at CMF has cooked up is one that\u2019s out for Moment\u2019s lunch. The Phone 2 Pro supports new external camera lenses, which you can screw on and off the updated 50MP sensors to give them macro and fisheye functionality. It\u2019s perhaps a slightly old-fashioned take on what\u2019s usually done with software or a dedicated sensor, but I like that it means you don\u2019t have to worry about macro mode turning on and off as it senses you nearing a subject. Oh, and have I mentioned that you can give this quirky pick a try for less than $300?\nAt that price, we usually expect some pretty significant cuts to budget phones, but I think the Phone 2 Pro has managed to avoid most of the pitfalls. Its Dimensity 7300 Pro is up for most tasks, and adding the Essential Key allows the budget pick to tap into the same convenient AI journal that Nothing introduced on its recent Phone 3a duo. The upgraded IP54 rating (up from IP52) is also a nice touch, but it falls slightly behind the IP68 protection that Samsung and Motorola have started adding to their affordable options.\nSamsung Galaxy A16 5G: The best Android phone under $200\n- Stellar software update promise\n- Solid primary camera\n- Decent battery life\n- Great price\n- Good charging\n- Just-okay build quality\n- Aging performance\n- Weak peripheral cameras\n- Bland design\nThe last of our budget picks, the Galaxy A16 5G, somehow manages to dance within one of the tightest categories of Android phones. When launching for less than $200, you have to make some serious concessions on the spec sheet, yet this cheap Android option manages to check off quite a few boxes with a decent IP54 rating (matching the CMF Phone 2 Pro above), an AMOLED panel with a 90Hz refresh rate, and an in-house Exynos 1330 processor in the US. It also looks the part of a more expensive Galaxy device, pulling heavily from Samsung\u2019s streamlined flagship style.\nI spent a fair portion of my winter with the Galaxy A16 5G in my pocket, and I came away impressed more often than not. Yes, I have to put it into the context that this is merely a $200 Android phone, but sometimes good enough is all you need. Its display is bright enough in most conditions, its primary camera is flexible enough to cover day-to-day shooting in decent lighting, and its battery life is pretty solid because of the power-sipping processor. However, one thing truly adds a mountain of value to a phone that costs little more than a mole hill.\nSamsung's Galaxy A16 5G is a fine value pick boosted by an incredible update commitment.\nYes, it\u2019s Samsung\u2019s downright remarkable commitment to software updates. Despite costing about the same as a premium pair of running shoes, the Galaxy A16 5G is on tap for six years of updates across major Android patches and regular security coverage. That puts this budget option at more updates than either the OnePlus 13 or Motorola Razr Ultra can match, despite both flagships costing at least four times more.\nUltimately, that mix of value and long-term support makes the Galaxy A16 5G great for a few particular groups of people, like kids or grandparents. It makes sense for the former as you won\u2019t have to worry too much about the phone picking up scuffs or scrapes since it doesn\u2019t cost too much to repair or replace, while it makes sense for the latter as One UI probably won\u2019t change too much over the course of its many updates, making it easy for you to lend a hand as the go-to tech support person in your family.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro: The best Android camera phone\n- Impressive Gemini-powered features\n- Excellent build quality\n- Gorgeous display\n- Flexible, capable cameras\n- Reliable update commitment\n- Tensor G4 still runs hot\n- Charges slower than 9 Pro XL\n- Limited base storage\nA lazier guide would tell you to scroll back up to the Pixel 9 Pro XL \u2014 our pick for the best overall Android phone \u2014 skim that entry, and then come back here to understand why the Pixel 9 Pro also makes this list, as both phones share the same camera specs and smarts. But I\u2019d much rather take this chance to hype up one of the best pocket-sized phones you can still get your hands on. After all, this is the one phone that\u2019s made its way back into my pocket more than any other whenever I find myself between reviews, and if you don\u2019t care about having a larger screen for snaps, the Pixel 9 Pro gets you that same industry-leading camera package for under $1,000, so it\u2019ll save you some cash, too.\nGoogle\u2019s 6.3-inch flagship packs the same hardware \u2014 50MP primary, 48MP periscope telephoto, and 48MP ultrawide sensors \u2014 as the Pixel 9 Pro XL, but the smaller body makes it much easier to pull out of your pocket and grab a photo before you miss the moment. On top of that, the Pixel 9 Pro still supports all of the same AI-powered shooting modes like Add Me, the refreshed Panorama mode, and the ability to edit your shots after the fact with Magic Editor.\nWant to see the proof for yourself? You can check out a whole bunch of our camera test samples in this Google Drive.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro takes everything we loved about the XL and, well, shrinks it.\nOf course, to make its compact Pro model run smoothly, Google had to make a cut or two. Thankfully, it didn\u2019t follow the path of Apple\u2019s previous Pros, putting different telephoto sensors on each size, but instead opted for a smaller battery. The Pixel 9 Pro packs a still-solid 4,700mAh battery with 27W wired charging from the same USB-C Pixel charger I\u2019ve mentioned once or twice and 21W wireless charging from the in-house Pixel Stand. Otherwise, though, everything from the combination of aluminum and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 to the top-notch build quality and the still-questionable Temperature Sensor is a perfect match for the full-sized flagship.\nMotorola Razr Ultra: The best flip-style Android foldable\n- Blisteringly fast charging and excellent battery life\n- Ultra-flagship-tier performance\n- Solid dual camera setup\n- Top-notch materials and eye-catching Pantone colors\n- Two very vibrant displays\n- Clean, simple software\n- Moto AI feels half baked\n- Limited software commitment\n- Long-range zoom kinda stinks\n- Expensive\nIt\u2019s tough to pick a flip phone as my favorite overall Android phone, but I think the Motorola Razr Ultra is about as close as any has come. After all, it\u2019s the first of its form factor to truly take the training wheels off, packing its spec sheet with Ultra-grade decisions while carefully dancing within its limits. It takes almost everything I loved about the previous flagship Razr foldable, fixes the odd camera decision I thought I\u2019d like, and then adds an extra dose of power in the form of additional RAM and Qualcomm\u2019s top-tier chipset.\nMore specifically, the Razr Ultra packs an impressive 16GB of RAM in its base configuration with 512GB of storage by default, both of which are more than any of Samsung\u2019s foldables can match. It then pairs them up with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and a 4,700mAh battery that towers over that of most flip phones I\u2019ve reviewed. Not only that, but Motorola\u2019s top-tier flip phone also packs a charging setup worth writing home about. The Razr Ultra ships ready to handle up to 68W wired TurboPower speeds with 30W wireless charging as a backup, at least as long as you have a capable charger. That\u2019s fast enough to run circles around everyone but OnePlus in the US, and makes an already great phone feel even better.\nThe Razr Ultra is by far the best-looking, most powerful flip phone I've ever used.\nPerhaps what wins the Razr Ultra the most points over Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Flip lineup is that I still prefer its cover screen experience. There are no hoops to jump through, no extra software to install, and no weird layouts to avoid. Yes, your apps use the entire display by default, meaning they might get cut off by the camera cutouts, but you can quickly fix that with a press of the gesture pill to compact the interface into a smaller square. On top of that, AI companions like Perplexity, Gemini, and Moto AI come optimized for the cover screen, making it easy to ask for help when needed.\nWhile I don\u2019t usually like to put too much stock into the way a phone looks \u2014 especially if I\u2019m going to put it into a case \u2014 there\u2019s no way around it on the Razr Ultra. Every colorful finish that Motorola offers comes from its close partnership with Pantone, and the different back panels offer more personality than the usual mix of Gorilla Glass can match. I reviewed the Mountain Trail version, which comes with a wooden back and a bronzed aluminum frame, but Motorola\u2019s Scarab finish is an eye-catcher with its deep green color and slightly fuzzy Alcantara back panel. I might be concerned about how it\u2019ll age in the coming years, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve seen anyone use materials quite like Motorola.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold: The best tablet-style Android foldable\n- Impressively thin design that opens completely flat\n- Excellent displays with high brightness\n- Thoughtful enhancements to Android for foldables\n- Lots of Gemini-powered AI features\n- Seven years of update support\n- Camera setup weaker than other Pixel 9s\n- Sluggish, frustrating charging\n- Tensor G4 behind the competition for power\n- Buttons too low\n- Extremely high price\nAt long last, there\u2019s a new king of the tablet-style Android foldable phones. Yes, this was Samsung\u2019s spot to lose for a long time \u2014 partly because it was the only real option in the US for several years \u2014 and now it\u2019s happened. After an original Pixel Fold that felt like a bright idea with classic prototype flaws, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold feels ready to stand on its own two feet, or at least two sides of its hinge. Google took everything we liked about its original form factor, ironed out the quirks, and then completely reimagined its internal display for a more comfortable experience.\nWhat surprised me most about coming to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold a little late in the game is that it doesn\u2019t feel too different from the small Pixel 9 Pro, at least not when closed. As a result, I\u2019m much more willing to pull it out of my pocket for casual tasks like streaming, social media, and updating my Strava activities without feeling like I\u2019m trying to type on a knife\u2019s edge. Then, when I\u2019ve found whatever show I\u2019m desperately trying to keep up with, I\u2019m perfectly comfortable opening the nearly bezelless internal display and only losing a bit of space to letterboxing.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold feels like a much larger upgrade than simply a second-year refresh.\nAlthough it\u2019s a massive leap forward for Google\u2019s foldables overall, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold isn\u2019t without its quirks. Its slim form factor means the Tensor G4 chipset has to work a little harder to vent heat, while the 4,650mAh battery is held back by just 21W wired charging \u2014 barely faster than what you get from the Pixel 9a for a third of the cost. Google\u2019s peripheral cameras feel like odd choices, too, with just a 10.8MP telephoto and 10.5MP ultrawide to hold down the newly square camera bump.\nAnd yet, I still feel like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the best tablet-style foldable you can get your hands on. Maybe it\u2019s because many of the Android Authority crew are Pixel fans by nature, but I feel like Google\u2019s approach to Android remains one of the cleanest and easiest to navigate, with the right mix of optimizations for the internal display. You\u2019ll also get the full suite of AI-powered features like Call Screen, Pixel Studio, and Gemini Live, just with far more real estate on which to explore them.\nOnePlus 13: The best Android phone for battery life\n- Gorgeous design\n- Incredible camera zoom and overall photography\n- Helpful AI integration\n- Excellent charging options\n- Simplified Oxygen OS experience\n- Great performance\n- Magnetic charging requires accessories\n- Fewer updates than Samsung or Google\nThese days, 5,000mAh batteries have almost become the standard on large Android flagships. Everyone is using them, from Google to Samsung to Motorola, and it\u2019s made life hard when hunting for the phone with the best battery life. However, whenever everyone seems to catch up, there\u2019s always one brand ready to jump ahead again. To nobody\u2019s surprise, it\u2019s once again the flagship killer, OnePlus. Its OnePlus 13 is a shoo-in for the best battery life, and it comes down to a no-limits combination of capacity and charging speed. Plus, it also helps that it\u2019s generally one of the best phones OnePlus has ever made.\nUp first, the cell that keeps the lights on. The OnePlus 13\u2019s 6,000mAh cell is large enough to make all but the most dedicated gaming phones feel inadequate. It\u2019s a full 1,000mAh larger than the battery Samsung tapped for its Galaxy S25 Ultra or Google chose for its Pixel 9 Pro XL, yet the OnePlus 13 is no thicker than either one. It can achieve such a remarkable capacity thanks to its switch from lithium-ion technology to silicon-carbon, a move that we\u2019d love to see the likes of Samsung copy the next time it tries an ultra-thin Edge model.\nBetter, our objective drain testing showed that the OnePlus 13 can go on and on thanks to its impressive cooling setup and efficient Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. It does experience some pretty extreme throttling here and there, occasionally quitting out benchmarking tests in the name of thermal management, but I\u2019ve always been able to go two days between charges, so I\u2019m not complaining.\nOnePlus's 6,000mAh battery looms large over most other Android flagships.\nAnd, when you inevitably drain your OnePlus 13, SuperVOOC charging is some of the best in the business. You\u2019ll need to keep the included USB-A charger close at hand since SuperVOOC is a much different standard than USB PD PPS in terms of support, but when you watch the OnePlus 13 fly back to a 50% charge in just 13 minutes, you probably won\u2019t have an issue with it. OnePlus\u2019s latest flagship also supports 50W wireless charging through a brand-new magnetic charger with a built-in fan, though you\u2019ll need a magnetic charger and might have to use a special plastic panel to protect the Arctic Dawn finish should you choose that colorway \u2014 it\u2019s a bit of a confusing mess, and the only blot on an otherwise near-perfect package.\nASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro: Best Android phone for gaming\n- Overkill performance\n- Outstanding battery life\n- Fast, universal charging\n- Super-stable video\n- Handy AI tools\n- Expensive Pro model\n- Poor software commitment\n- Inconsistent cameras\n- No 4K recording on all lenses\nThe last of our main selections for this list of the best Android phones is one for the gamers, literally. ASUS\u2019s ROG Phone 9 Pro is about as close to a gaming laptop as you can get, at least if you can ignore that it doesn\u2019t fold in half. It has a frankly ridiculous spec sheet, offering up to 24GB of RAM with a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip under the hood and 65W wired charging that\u2019s much faster than the MacBook Air I\u2019m using to assemble this list.\nOf course, those features aren\u2019t completely unheard of in the flagship Android segment \u2014 well, 24GB of RAM is a lot \u2014 but its clever gaming tweaks set the ROG Phone 9 Pro apart. It pulls the programmable matrix from the back of the ROG Zephyrus and pairs it with pressure-sensitive triggers dotted around the frame to help you draw some of the controls off the 6.78-inch AMOLED itself. Those features, combined with the improved efficiency of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, had my colleague Rob Triggs gaming with a smile, pushing the ROG Phone 9 Pro as hard as he wanted to find out where its throttling point lay.\nFor what might be the first time, though, Rob also declared this to be a gaming phone he might not mind using every day. See, a lot of gaming-specific devices fall into the common trap of being too big, too edgy, and too expensive for casual usage, not to mention the fact that camera hardware almost always comes last. On the ROG Phone 9 Pro, however, you get an updated 50MP LYTIA 700 sensor for the bulk of your photography, and ASUS has reimagined its stabilization for better video shooting. The display is also brighter and smoother than before, topping out at a 185Hz refresh rate and 2,500 nits of brightness, which is more than enough for a bright, sunny day.\nThe ROG Phone 9 Pro is an elite gaming phone that's flexible enough for everyday usage.\nAlso, if you\u2019re serious about pushing the ROG Phone 9 Pro to its gaming limits (and why wouldn\u2019t you be?), ASUS has several accessories worth checking out. Rob got plenty of mileage out of the detachable controller below, though he also mentioned the external cooling setup as a helpful option when trying to game and charge simultaneously. And, if you\u2019re not set on the customizable LED matrix on the back, you can also check out the ROG Phone 9 to save a couple of bucks.\nHonorable mentions\nIf the Xiaomi 15 Ultra were just a little bit easier to access in the US, it might have earned a full spot on our list rather than simply an honorable mention, and I think it still has a legitimate claim to being the best Android camera phone. Like the last few Ultras, it\u2019s practically a mirrorless camera with a phone on the back, pairing a trio of 50MP sensors with a 200MP telephoto camera and sporting an overall design that\u2019s reminiscent of a Leica mirrorless camera to go along with Xiaomi\u2019s Leica-tuned color science.\nMaking its first full appearance on this list (CMF Phone 2 Pro not withstanding), the Nothing Phone 3a Pro is one of the most fun mid-rangers I\u2019ve reviewed in a while. Yes, it suffers from the same limited US band support as its siblings, but it\u2019s easy to fall in love with the dot-based Nothing OS skin, the light-up Glyph Interface, and the snappy 50W wired charging. I might like the more subtle camera bump on the Nothing Phone 3a a little better, but the extra zoom flexibility is a worthy tradeoff.\nOnePlus\u2019s proper 2025 flagship is more than deserving of its place as our battery king, but its mid-range option isn\u2019t far behind. Some might say that the OnePlus 13R is a bit of a 2024 flagship in disguise, and I think they\u2019d be right \u2014 in the best of ways. It pairs a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset with a OnePlus 13-esque design, housing a trio of camera sensors in its circular bump. I\u2019ll never complain about a phone with a 6,000mAh battery capacity, though it\u2019s a bit of a bummer that the included SuperVOOC charger will only get you to 55W.\nAlthough I\u2019m happy to call Motorola\u2019s latest Razr Ultra the best flip phone, it\u2019s also the most expensive. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Flip 6, on the other hand, picks up right where the Galaxy Z Flip 5 left off, with two capable cameras, a folder-shaped Flex Window, and nabs a chipset upgrade to keep things interesting. You\u2019ll have to get used to having two app drawers if you want more than Maps, YouTube, and Google Messages at your disposal, but Samsung\u2019s full-screen widgets are simply excellent.\nIn that same vein, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 has gone from setting the standard for book-style foldables to playing second fiddle to the Pixel. It\u2019s still an excellent foldable, and its taller, thinner internal display sometimes makes a bit more sense than Google\u2019s wide aspect ratio, but it hasn\u2019t changed too much outside of a chipset upgrade in recent years, still sporting the same battery, charging setup, and cameras as the Folds that came before it.\nIf you\u2019ve spent any time looking for a great Android phone, you\u2019ll know there aren\u2019t many small ones left. Somehow, 6.5-inch or larger displays have become the standard, leaving those of us with smaller hands relegated to a precious few picks. Thankfully, the Pixel 9 is one of those, offering quite a lot of the Pro-level experience in a slightly more comfortable form factor. Its 6.3-inch display is easy to reach across yet doesn\u2019t feel so tiny that you\u2019re missing out on real estate. If we hadn\u2019t already put every other Pixel 9 device on this list, this one might have earned more than an honorable mention.\nMany of Samsung\u2019s best offerings lay it on pretty heavy with the focus on power users, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. However, it also has the unintended benefit of making Samsung\u2019s budget-conscious picks stand out slightly more. The Galaxy S24 FE is one such option, landing just below the flagship tier with a display that nearly matches the Galaxy S25 Plus, materials like aluminum and Gorilla Glass Victus Plus that I\u2019d trust without a case, and just enough of a dip into Galaxy AI to give more users a taste of Chat Assist, Note Assist, and better photo editing tools.\nWhat to look for in a good Android phone\nWe could sit here and list the best Android phones all day \u2014 we\u2019re phone nerds, it\u2019s our job. We\u2019ll sit here and reminisce on some of the best phones from yesteryear, too, looking for any excuse to pull something fun out of the closet. However, just because we like one or two or ten things about a phone doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right for you. There\u2019s much more to consider before you splash the cash, especially if you plan to have this phone for several years.\nWe have our favorite Android phones, but the best way for you to pick one is to break it down into the features you really want.\nFor example, if you want a small, super-portable phone, something like the Galaxy S25 Ultra simply won\u2019t work, no matter how you try to wrangle it. That 6.9-inch display will always feel too big for your pocket. At the same time, it\u2019s a great phone that packs flexible cameras, a powerful chipset, and a convenient S Pen, so it\u2019s all about deciding what features you absolutely must have in a device.\nSo, with that in mind, here are a few things I always tell people to look for when buying a new phone:\n- Software updates: A phone is only as good as the number of software updates it will receive. You won\u2019t be able to change your battery, display, or camera hardware over time, so most of the value you\u2019ll pull from a phone comes from keeping it for years and years after you\u2019ve paid it off. The best way to guarantee some of that value is with a Pixel or Galaxy device set for seven years of patches, though Motorola and OnePlus are catching up with four and five years of support at their flagship levels.\n- Camera flexibility: If you\u2019re after one of the best Android phones on the market, you probably have high camera expectations. It\u2019s perfectly understandable \u2014 you\u2019ll probably capture your life with this device for several years. And, as you might have noticed, single-camera Android phones aren\u2019t a thing anymore. So, if you prioritize a great camera phone, you\u2019ll want to keep an eye on things like sensor size, telephoto focal length, and how your phone processes images after the fact.\n- Display size: As mentioned above, finding a small Android phone is easier said than done these days. There aren\u2019t many 6.1-inch or 6.2-inch options left, with premium picks like the Pixel 9 Pro XL and Galaxy S25 Ultra measuring close to 7 inches, and many budget to mid-range options measuring 6.5 inches or larger. Also, if display size is no issue (or you want a phone that can check two boxes at once), you might consider a foldable that can take over for a tablet, too.\n- RAM and storage options: Depending on your needs, you might also want to monitor the RAM and storage that your chosen Android phone comes with. At one point, 8GB of RAM was enough to tackle everything from web browsing to gaming to streaming a full season on Netflix, but no longer. With the explosion of AI-powered features, 12GB is closer to the bare minimum for flagships, while the Pixel 9 Pro series feels even more capable with 16GB across the board.\n- To fold or not to fold: Foldable Android phones remain one of the most exciting categories in tech, at least to me. They\u2019ve improved by leaps and bounds in recent years, picking up better cameras, thinner hinges, and better protection against water and dust. However, you\u2019ll still have to weigh out whether or not you have the budget to try something new and if you can live with a spec sheet that hasn\u2019t caught up just yet.\n- Durability: These days, phones feature more premium materials than ever, sometimes pairing aluminum and titanium frames with advanced glasses like Panda Glass and Gorilla Glass or interesting textures like vegan leather and, in the case of the Razr Ultra, Alcantara. My advice would be to think about what materials you want and whether or not you plan to put your phone in a case. Also, keep in mind that IP68 ratings against water and dust have become the standard for many flagships, so think twice before settling for a lower rating, even if it saves money.\n- Charging speed: It\u2019s no longer a surprise to see phones ship with 5,000mAh batteries \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s expected on phones of a certain size. However, with great power capacity comes great responsibility, so you\u2019ll want to keep an eye on the charging speeds that your new phone supports. Some, like OnePlus, offer up to 80W speeds with the correct charger, while others, like the Galaxy S25, won\u2019t go above 25W no matter how hard you try. Also, if you opt for something like the Pixel 9 Pro XL, you\u2019ll need Google\u2019s in-house USB-C charger to guarantee the best speeds, so you might need to budget for some extra charging accessories.\n- AI features: One last thing worth watching \u2014 and probably the least essential of my picks \u2014 is the list of AI features your new phone will support. If you opt for a flagship Pixel or a Galaxy S25, you\u2019ll get a pretty solid set of Gemini and Galaxy AI picks, while the OnePlus 13 and Motorola Razr lineup might lag behind just a bit. Then again, you might find that the available features don\u2019t quite mesh with your usage or don\u2019t feel quite polished enough, so you may also be able to get by with Circle to Search and some of the other features that have made their way to lower price points.\nWhy you should trust me\nI\u2019m a phone guy \u2014 always have been. I can still rattle off every device I\u2019ve ever purchased with my own money, and I continue to hold the LG G3 as one of my favorite phones of all time. I stayed almost perfectly true to Android ever since my parents got me my first smartphone after I made it to high school, at least as long as you\u2019re willing to forgive the few years I spent with an iPhone 7 when I let green bubble bullying get the best of me.\nSince then, I\u2019ve made my love of phones into my day job, shifting my personal SIM more times than I can count and spending time with everything from the Motorola Moto G Play (2021) to the OnePlus Open to the Galaxy S25 Ultra in my pocket. I won\u2019t pretend to have loved every phone I\u2019ve reviewed \u2014 you have to break a few eggs to make an omelet \u2014 but I\u2019ve taken highlights away from each one and come to appreciate Android options both high and low.\nI review dozens of Android phones every single year, and my personal SIM moves around enough to qualify for frequent flyer status.\nFurther, my opinions come from more than simply running around with a new phone in my pocket. Part of my role as a reviewer is to work closely with my colleague, and our resident testing expert, Rob Triggs, to come up with objective metrics by which we can compare devices. We\u2019ve worked closely to cook up tests for battery life and charging, along with a nicely standardized set of ways to put CPUs and GPUs through their paces long before I ever sit down to write a review. Do I still count my hands-on experience? Of course I do, but I also like to ensure that data backs them up. If you want more information on our testing procedures, you can read our full methodology at the link.\nWhat do you look for in an Android phone?\nSometimes, my need to be thorough means that I\u2019m not the first reviewer to press the publish button, and I\u2019m rarely the shortest and sweetest among my peers, but I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019ll happily cause a little bit of a headache for my editor (shout out to you, Ollie) if it means I know I\u2019m being as thorough as possible. Besides, with how far phones have come in just the last few years, I\u2019m not sure how anyone could put together a review without stopping and taking a few stretch breaks.\nThank you for being part of our community.

The lineup will include three models, including the Galaxy S26 Pro, Galaxy S26 Edge, and Galaxy S26 Ultra.\nA few weeks ago, it was reported that the Galaxy S26 Edge will have a 4,200mAh battery packed into an ultra-slim 5.5 mm profile. However, some battery rumors suggest that it will have a 4,400mAh battery.\nSamsung Galaxy S26 Edge Battery to Get Massive Upgrade Over S25 Edge\nMeanwhile, the Galaxy S26 Edge\u2019s battery has now been spotted on the 3C certification, which revealed that the rated battery capacity of the device is 4,078mAh. This hints that the typical capacity could be 4,200mAh.\nHowever, there\u2019s no official statement regarding the battery capacity of the Galaxy S26 Edge, so it remains to be seen whether the typical capacity will be 4,200mAh or 4,400mAh. According to the previous report, the Galaxy S26 Edge could feature a 50MP camera from Sony. Recently, the device appeared on Geekbench\u2019s database, which confirmed that it will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset."

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nThe Galaxy S26 Edge battery rumors just got even more promising\nAugust 4, 2025\n- A new leak suggests the Galaxy S26 Edge will have a 4,400mAh battery.\n- That\u2019s noticeably up from 3,900mAh in the S25 Edge and slightly more than a previous 4,200mAh claim.\n- Both leaks point to Samsung addressing one of the biggest complaints about the S25 Edge.\nThe Galaxy S25 Edge was one of Samsung\u2019s most criticized flagships of recent years, and much of that frustration rightly centered on battery life. Now, we have a second clue that Samsung may address that with a beefier battery for its successor.\nAccording to a new Weibo post from leaker Setsuna Digital, the Galaxy S26 Edge will feature a 4,400mAh battery. That\u2019s notably higher than the 3,900mAh cell in the S25 Edge, and slightly more than the 4,200mAh figure suggested by a previous leak last week.\nThe difference between the two leaks isn\u2019t huge, but they both reinforce the same message: Samsung is taking battery concerns seriously this time around. The S25 Edge combined a sharper display and higher-resolution camera with a smaller battery than the base S25, so it wasn\u2019t surprising to see worse battery life in our testing \u2014 though the drop-off was bigger than you might expect from a 100mAh difference.\nIf this latest number holds, the S26 Edge would slot between the S25 and S25 Plus in terms of capacity, rather than still being lower than the cheapest of those two models. Indications are that we won\u2019t get a Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus next year anyway, with them both to be ditched for an S26 Plus model, but it\u2019s a decent benchmark nonetheless.\nIt\u2019s nice to see Samsung responding positively to the constructive feedback of the fans, especially concerning an area of the specs that a large proportion of users care about.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nIf ultra-thin phones are the future, I hope they learn from the Galaxy S25 Edge's biggest mistakes\nMay 31, 2025\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge\nWhat we like\nWhat we don't like\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge\nThere\u2019s something to be said for throwing an idea at the wall and seeing if it sticks. Sometimes, it gives us something brilliant, like HTC introducing dual camera setups to the world or Samsung resurrecting the foldable phone. Other times, like with the LG Wing, it leaves us scratching our heads, wondering how an idea ever grew the wings it needed to fly \u2014 pun intended.\nSo, when Samsung teased the Galaxy S25 Edge at the end of its first Unpacked event of 2025, I figured it could go one of two ways: we could have a new standard for ultra-slim smartphones on our hands, or we could have a one-off design that reminds us why innovation isn\u2019t always progress. Unfortunately, I think this is a case of the latter, and here\u2019s why.\nIt\u2019s a design marvel\u2026\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 the Galaxy S25 Edge looks impressive. It even feels impressive. Every time I pick it up, I\u2019m in awe of how Samsung managed to make something with such a large display so thin and feel so light. Whenever I hand it off to a friend, they seem to heft it once in their hands before immediately pulling out their iPhone for a side-by-side comparison. Every time, the Galaxy S25 Edge is thinner and lighter, at least for its size.\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s most exciting about the Galaxy S25 Edge: Every time someone holds it, you get to see the look of surprise on their face. It\u2019s the Galaxy S25 Edge\u2019s entire bit \u2014 at just 5.8mm thick from top to bottom, it\u2019s probably the thinnest device most people have held in a long time, unless they\u2019re dedicated iPad Pro users. And yes, there\u2019s a bit more of a bump around the cameras, because there\u2019s no way a 200MP primary sensor would fit directly into the body, but it certainly doesn\u2019t break the illusion of top-to-bottom thinness.\nSeeing my friends' faces as they hold a phone this thin and light is almost worth the price of admission... almost.\nHowever, it also takes just a few seconds of holding the Galaxy S25 Edge for the questions to start rolling in. I\u2019ve been peppered with everything from \u201cHow do you hold it comfortably?\u201d to \u201cDo you think you could bend it?\u201d to \u201cWhy are you using it without a case?\u201d\nHonestly, the answers to all three of those questions are pretty much the same \u2014 you just have to trust Samsung a little bit. It decked out the Galaxy S25 Edge in its best materials, sandwiching a titanium frame between Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 on the front and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. If you find a way to bend it in your pocket or your backpack, then you\u2019re probably going to destroy a thicker, less expensive phone, too.\nOf course, that level of faith in the top-tier materials doesn\u2019t make the Galaxy S25 Edge any more comfortable to hold. It feels like picking up a vinyl record to put it on your turntable, by which I mean you hold it so carefully by the frame because you\u2019re worried about smudging the front by accident. I know I\u2019m not going to damage the 6.7-inch AMOLED by touching it \u2014 it\u2019s a phone, it\u2019s meant to be touched \u2014 but I\u2019m more worried about accidentally opening an app, pressing on my home screen to edit the layout, or launching Circle to Search via the gesture pill, because all three of those things have happened thanks to my stocky little fingers.\nOh, and I simply refuse to use the Galaxy S25 Edge with a case, because that would essentially make it as thick as any other phone, which I would also prefer to use caseless. You could argue that it\u2019s better to have a protected thin phone that\u2019s only as thick as an unprotected regular phone, but I still think it defeats the point of buying the Edge. Besides, the phone is already IP68 protected, so I shouldn\u2019t have a problem letting it stand up to the elements while the glass and titanium defend it in case I take a tumble.\nUnfortunately, to go back to that vinyl record metaphor I used, that\u2019s my biggest problem with the Galaxy S25 Edge. Even though I know it\u2019s durable, just like I know that lightly touching a vinyl record won\u2019t cause irreparable harm, I can\u2019t bring myself to use it like I would another phone. I\u2019m still determined to treat it like a work of art that\u2019s to be handled as if it were about to break, and that makes me not want to use it at all. I\u2019m too nervous to simply toss it in a backpack or leave it on the couch when I dash out for a couple of morning miles, all because I\u2019m not sure what would happen if I were a little too rough.\nEven worse, by treating the Galaxy S25 Edge with such care, I feel like I\u2019m depriving myself of one of Samsung\u2019s best features: its excellent display. The Galaxy S25 Edge packs a nearly identical 6.7-inch LTPO AMOLED panel to the one on the Galaxy S25 Plus, right down to the variable 120Hz refresh rate. We loved the display on that phone (even though the phone itself was a bit of a meh-burger), and it\u2019s just as good this time, too.\nThe colors are rich and vibrant, the refresh rate is buttery smooth, and the nearly nonexistent bezels make the Edge feel like all content, all the time. It was the perfect display for checking the finales of Andor and The Last of Us off my list, and I propped it up next to my laptop to watch Chelsea lift the UEFA Conference League trophy, completing world football before Arsenal has won any European silverware (whoops, sorry, stream of consciousness there\u2026 moving on).\nOne thing I didn\u2019t expect from the Galaxy S25 Edge\u2019s display, though, is just how dim it can get. Sure, it\u2019s fun to brag about peak brightness, and reaching 2,600 nits in bright sunlight is great, but I wasn\u2019t expecting Samsung\u2019s ultra-thin flagship to go the other way, too. While testing the camera, I watched the phone overrule me, kicking into the most extreme form of battery saver and dropping the panel to what I can only guess was one nit. At the time, I was annoyed, as it was a bright, sunny day, so I could no longer see the camera interface itself, but I\u2019ve since come around to the idea that it was doing everything possible to stretch its battery just a little bit further.\n\u2026with performance pitfalls\u2026\nAlthough most of the questions I\u2019ve fielded about the Galaxy S25 Edge have been about its eye-catching, barely there design, one more comes up just as often: Does its performance keep up? After all, with such a slim body, there\u2019s only so much room for cooling technology and to fit a battery, so something has to give, right? Unfortunately, yes.\nBefore we talk about shortcomings, though, we should touch on the Edge\u2019s chipset and storage combos \u2014 they do everything they can to set the phone up for success. It picks up where its siblings left off, pairing a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor with 12GB of RAM and up to 512GB of fixed storage. That\u2019s more than good enough for day-to-day tasks, and sets the Galaxy S25 Edge up to make a solid run at our gauntlet of benchmarks.\nAt first, the Edge\u2019s performance backed up exactly what I thought it would. My colleague Rob Triggs and I put it up against its fellow Galaxy S25 models across our pair of CPU-intensive tests, and it hung right with its counterparts. It only came up shy of the Galaxy S25 Ultra in single-core Geekbench 6 performance, and barely edged the crowd on the more comprehensive PCMark Work test. Unfortunately, as Rob noted in his head-to-head\u2026 -to-head-to-head comparison, that\u2019s where the good news runs out.\nWhen we flipped our testing to the more graphically intensive Wild Life stress tests, the Galaxy S25 Edge was quick to throw in the towel. Both times, it started out running like an Olympic sprinter, only to drop below even the smallest Galaxy S25 model by the fourth or fifth run. At its worst, the Edge scored about 8.5% slower than the Galaxy S25 and a painful 24.8% behind the Galaxy S25 Ultra \u2014 no small margin when spending over $1,100 on a new phone.\nIt\u2019s pretty straightforward to figure out why the Galaxy S25 Edge stumbles when it does, though: Its thermal regulation isn\u2019t there. It peaks at the same internal temperature as Samsung\u2019s other flagships, but when it hits that temperature, it has to throttle its performance much harder to compensate for the condensed cooling setup. Unfortunately, that means cutting its performance in half by the end of our testing \u2014 something we haven\u2019t seen since the Galaxy Z Flip 6 with its equally tricky cooling setup.\nThe Edge has trouble keeping up with non-Samsung devices, too. We\u2019ve already established that it starts sky-high, just about matching the OnePlus 13\u2019s peak despite the latter having a massive cooling chamber, before dropping much closer to the performance of the iPhone 16 Pro Max and Pixel 9 Pro XL just a few runs later. It\u2019s not bad company to keep \u2014 both Apple and Google make great flagships \u2014 but you get more out of both in terms of battery life and camera flexibility to make up for whatever performance woes pop up. The Galaxy S25 Edge has no such luck. Oh, and the Galaxy S24 FE puts up similar final numbers despite costing nearly $500 less.\nNow, this is where you might hope I\u2019ll swoop in and say the Galaxy S25 Edge\u2019s day-to-day performance is different from its controlled benchmarks. It\u2019s not.\nThe phone runs fine under casual load but stumbles when you ask it to work a little harder. The Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset heats up, the battery drops like a stone, and you start to get battery anxiety in a hurry. I can make do if I\u2019m just walking around my neighborhood, listening to Spotify and scrolling social media, but when I was home for Memorial Day Weekend, I decided to work the Edge a bit harder. I took it for the photo walk I mentioned in the design section above, and it showed me just where its weaknesses lie.\nWhen I started my trip around town, the phone was at a comfortable 25% charge \u2014 perfectly reasonable, and no battery saver was needed yet. I put my trusty CMF Buds Pro 2 in my ears and fired up my daylist while looking for interesting scenes worth shooting. After about 20 minutes in the sun, opening and closing the camera as needed, the battery dropped to a mere 3%, and the titanium frame felt uncomfortably warm in my hand. This is when Samsung hacked its brightness down to just one nit, marking the end of my adventure because I couldn\u2019t see the screen any longer.\nOf course, I wasn\u2019t in an emergency, so I just shrugged and went back to my parents\u2019 house to look for a charger. However, that poor battery return has stuck with me to the point where I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d leave home with anything less than a 30% charge and expect to have any juice left by the time I get back.\nThe Galaxy S25 Edge is great in short bursts, but like a sprinter, it runs out of energy in a hurry.\nThen again, I can\u2019t imagine that many people will be using the last 20% of their phone\u2019s battery to take photos of the place where they grew up, but I prefer to think of it as a warning. The stakes were very low for me, but if you were out on a hike and got lost or got into a car accident and needed to call for help, I\u2019m worried that you wouldn\u2019t be able to trust the Galaxy S25 Edge like you could another phone. And, if you can\u2019t trust your phone when you need it most, you\u2019re probably not going to have that phone for very long.\nGranted, the Galaxy S25 Edge is much more reliable for casual workloads. It soared through the last few episodes of some of my favorite shows, as mentioned above, and it\u2019s been perfectly happy to load up Pok\u00e9mon TCG Pocket while I waste time opening pack after pack looking for a few more shinies. More graphically intensive titles like Call of Duty Mobile and even Warhammer 40,000 Tacticus would probably turn the Galaxy S25 Edge into a small neutron star, though \u2014 either that, or it would throttle to the point where they became unplayable.\nAnd, since I\u2019ve opened the door of complaining about the Galaxy S25 Edge\u2019s tiny battery, let\u2019s stay a while. Personally, I think this is the biggest thing that would make me nervous about keeping and using this phone in the long term. Due to size constraints, Samsung could only fit its flagship with a 3,900mAh battery, making it smaller than the cell inside the base Galaxy S25. Had Samsung adopted a silicon-carbon battery, it probably could have bumped that capacity by a few hundred milliamp-hours, much like OnePlus did with the OnePlus 13, but it didn\u2019t. It settled for less, and our controlled battery drain test shows why that was probably a bad idea.\nOn the left side, we have the Edge\u2019s performance against its fellow Samsung models, discounting the Galaxy S25 Ultra to keep the graph legible. Across four of the first five categories, the ultra-slim Galaxy S25 Edge comes up short. Sure, it ties the Exynos-toting Galaxy S24 on a simulated Zoom call, and it\u2019s right in the mix for camera performance, but everywhere else, it\u2019s hovering around fifth place out of five. It, of course, has the fifth-largest battery out of the five, so there\u2019s not much for the Galaxy S25 Edge to hang its hat on here.\nThe problems get worse on the right side when we put the Edge up against similarly priced competition, including the beefed-up Motorola Razr Ultra and the iPhone 16 Pro. Yes, the Edge generally stays ahead of its iOS-powered rival, but it falls far behind the other three Snapdragon 8 Elite flagships, stopping hundreds of minutes short of the rest in terms of 4K video playback, web browsing, and even a simulated Zoom call. Mix in the fact that the rest of these phones have much larger batteries for not much more money (or sometimes less), and it becomes tough to reach for the Galaxy S25 Edge.\nSwapping over to charging, the Galaxy S25 Edge once again takes after Samsung\u2019s smallest flagship. It packs the same 25W wired and 15W wireless charging options as the base Galaxy S25, ignoring that Samsung\u2019s more expensive options bump the rate to 45W with a compatible USB PD PPS block. This strict limitation means that although it has the smallest battery of the phones I compared it to on the right side, it charges second-slowest, only finishing faster than Apple\u2019s turtle-esque iPhone 16 Pro.\nAnd yes, I\u2019ll admit that it\u2019s probably unnecessary to complain about a phone that can fill its battery in just about an hour, but when options like the Razr Ultra and OnePlus 13 can fill their much larger cells in as little as half the time, I\u2019m going to pick them whenever I get the chance.\n\u2026and inflexible cameras\u2026\nWhile I can understand Samsung stripping back the battery capacity on its slimmest flagship to date, it\u2019s tougher for me to understand a few other limitations, including the dual camera setup. Yes, for the first time since the Galaxy S10e (which cost a fraction of what the Galaxy S25 Edge does), we have a flagship Samsung phone with only two rear cameras. Granted, the primary camera is an absolute beast \u2014 the same 200MP sensor from the Galaxy S25 Ultra \u2014 but it feels like Samsung has given up one of the things I\u2019ve always trusted to keep it among the best camera phones you can buy.\nTo me, when you pick up a traditional Samsung flagship, you expect a pretty flexible triple camera setup. You expect a solid primary camera, a telephoto sensor set to 3x optical zoom, and an ultrawide sensor that rounds things out. That\u2019s not the case with the Edge. It\u2019s content to pair its Ultra-tier primary sensor with a Plus-tier 12MP ultrawide shooter, creating a camera duo that\u2019s equally excellent and just kind of everyday average. It could have pulled over the 50MP ultrawide sensor from the Galaxy S25 Ultra, giving the Edge more megapixels and cropping ability than it could know what to do with, but instead went the more pedestrian route while stripping most of the zoom capability.\nThere are plenty of megapixels here, I'm just not sure they're in the right place.\nOf course, I can only imagine that Samsung decided to axe the telephoto sensor in order to limit the size of its camera bump, thus keeping the Edge, well, edgy. Engineers probably already took exception because the bump is just as thick as the rest of the phone, and maybe they put their foot down at the extra space the hardware would have required. Unfortunately, that means the zoom on the Galaxy S25 Edge is all digital and tops out at just 10x zoom \u2014 the same as an iPhone 16 or a base Pixel 9. You could technically get creative and shoot full 200MP images from the primary camera only to crop them in tighter afterwards, but otherwise, there\u2019s no way to push the default interface further. In practice, that makes the Galaxy S25 Edge feel like a Fiat with the engine of a Ferrari \u2014 you know it could probably do more, it just won\u2019t.\nLet\u2019s get to some camera samples, and you\u2019ll see what I mean.\nI don\u2019t have too many issues with any of the shots I picked for this first row \u2014 they show the Galaxy S25 Edge\u2019s strengths pretty nicely. The subjects in all four samples are clean and sharp, with pleasant natural fall-off behind the sign in my hometown and good shadows below the rail car to the far right side. If I had to pick out a hiccup from the bunch, it would be that Samsung\u2019s heavily saturated red and green color profile is back with a vengeance. I know it was a sunny day, but the caboose that sits in the park in my hometown hasn\u2019t been that red for a few years, nor is the grass usually quite so lively at this point in the spring. Also, for being a mostly digital crop, the shot of the blue crab holds pretty solid detail.\nMoving on, Samsung\u2019s dedicated portrait mode is just as reliable as its natural bokeh, if a bit sharper. I like that it was able to pick out the entire lion sculpture against the white fence, as I\u2019ve had other experiences where a phone will isolate the lion\u2019s head and then call it a day. The massive 200MP sensor had no troubles with the slightly lower lighting conditions in the shot to the right, either. It correctly exposed the ice cream sign while keeping accurate shadows in the doorway and on the ivy-coated building in the background. The macro-like shot of the succulent on the left-hand side brought one of Samsung\u2019s other quirks to my attention, which is the way it handles Focus Enhancer in close-ups.\nNow, I didn\u2019t think to snap two shots of the first succulent, so I went back out to find a hydrangea on my street back home in Baltimore. I grabbed two photos \u2014 one with Focus Enhance active and one with it turned off. After a glance between the two, I think I\u2019ll be turning Focus Enhancer off for the foreseeable future. Although it cleverly adjusts for macro-like detail, Samsung\u2019s artificial sharpening is just too much for me to think the image is natural.\nAlso, while I gave Samsung some heat for picking the lower-resolution ultrawide sensor over the 50MP option on its Ultra, I still think it\u2019s a good camera. I love the colors in the shot of the town hall to the far left, and I think the camera does a great job of showing the scale of the church tower on the right side. It\u2019s a little tougher to get a look I like when trying to capture street art up close, referring to the mosaic on the far side, but the colors are still spot-on given the gray, overcast day when I was walking around.\nAlright, here\u2019s where I get to illustrate the problem with Samsung ditching the telephoto sensor. Despite having a monstrous 200 megapixels to work with, the Galaxy S25 Edge is happy to stick with just 10x zoom. That\u2019s a fraction of what the smaller Galaxy S25 models can achieve at 30x and hardly compares to the 100x Space Zoom of the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Yes, I will admit that limiting the zoom ensures better finished photos across the entire range \u2014 everything below is plenty sharp enough for me to share it, though, because it\u2019s digital, you can\u2019t pixel peep without things getting dicey \u2014 but it feels like an artificial limitation on such an expensive smartphone.\nThe last piece of Samsung\u2019s premium camera setup is its 12MP selfie camera. This time, I have to give it some credit for matching the Galaxy S25 Ultra \u2014 even if a 12MP sensor isn\u2019t a high bar in a punch hole. Either way, I think the colors and details are good enough, and the artificial bokeh does a pretty good job of capturing all of my hair without putting too sharp a line around my head. I\u2019m not entirely sure why my white shirt has such a blue cast, but I\u2019m much happier with the tones in my face, even if I got a little burnt over the holiday weekend.\nIf high-quality video is what you\u2019re after, you can probably guess what I\u2019m about to say. Yes, the Galaxy S25 Edge shoots great footage at 1x or 2x zoom. Yes, the stabilization is excellent, and the ability to shoot 8K at 30fps or 4K at up to 120fps means you have plenty of options. I like how a few of my simple clips around town came out, but like above, the lack of zoom flexibility means there are scenes you just won\u2019t be able to dial in closely enough.\nOn the bright side, some of Samsung\u2019s latest software wrinkles make it more enjoyable to use the cameras overall. The Edge supports a smooth zoom slider when shooting videos, which makes clips, well, smoother. It also lets you save exposure settings when you flip between camera modes so that you don\u2019t have to raise and lower your exposure and risk missing a shot. Perhaps the coolest trick in the Galaxy S25 Edge\u2019s camera book, though, is its ability to shoot Log format videos from both the front and rear sensors, meaning that you can easily hop in and color grade your footage later on.\nYou can also check out full-resolution versions of these camera samples and several more at this Google Drive link.\n\u2026but I do like One UI 7!\nDespite everything that\u2019s let me down about the Galaxy S25 Edge, there\u2019s one bright spot to the phone that didn\u2019t used to be one. For a long time, I ranked Samsung\u2019s One UI as one of my least favorite Android skins, complaining that it\u2019s too cluttered and forces me through too many menus to get my phone feeling just right. I begged to spend time in Pixel UI or on Nothing OS, only dipping back into One UI for major updates or while writing a review. Now, though, I feel at least a little bit more at home, and will probably like it even better once I get to try a stable build of One UI 8.\nFor starters, Samsung has simplified its customization options \u2014 or at least made them look better. It\u2019s improved the color-matched theme options, added the ability to resize and reshape your widgets to break up the traditional home screen grid, and cooked up a little thing called DIY Home. Personally, I don\u2019t think I could ever use the wide-open chaos of DIY Home, which allows you to put apps anywhere on your home screen and overlap them with stickers and doodles, but I respect what Samsung is going for. I\u2019ve seen a few very creative layouts floated across the One UI subreddit, and I would steal them if I didn\u2019t have to recreate them by hand.\nDIY Home is chaos, but I like that Samsung is embracing its wild side.\nThe Now Bar is also an essential part of One UI 7, and one of the better Dynamic Island clones I\u2019ve ever used. It\u2019s not exactly like Apple\u2019s implementation in that it\u2019s invisible most of the time, but I appreciate that it pops up with timely notifications on my lock screen before shuffling off to the top right corner when I open my phone. I\u2019ve used it for everything from stacking an endless rotation of kitchen timers to monitoring the Europa League final so that I didn\u2019t have to watch Tottenham take on Manchester United \u2014 a pairing that would have put me to sleep by halftime. I\u2019m less sold on Samsung\u2019s Now Brief, which updates you on the weather, upcoming events, and news headlines every few hours, but only because I already get those things from the widgets on my home screen.\nThis is also where I should take a second to acknowledge Galaxy AI. There\u2019s not much new on this front, at least not if you read our Galaxy S25 reviews, but the overall experience keeps getting smoother. I\u2019ve started to find more and more uses for things like Photo Assist and its generative edits, and I\u2019m glad that Drawing Assist finally feels more like an image generator than the original Portrait Studio. Samsung\u2019s Call Assist and Chat Assist are pretty good, too, now that they have built-in translation features that make it easier to tolerate my younger brother when he busts out one of the many languages he studied in college. I\u2019m not sold on everything yet \u2014 you won\u2019t find me using Writing Assist to punch up paragraphs when I already wordsmith for a living, but who knows, even that might change over the impressive seven years of updates that the Edge is due.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge review verdict: Who\u2019s buying this?\nWhen I started this review, I wondered which side of the innovation line the Galaxy S25 Edge would fall on. I pondered whether it would feel like a stroke of genius, beating Apple to the ultra-thin punch and becoming one of the best Android phones, or if it would feel more like LG\u2019s famous (or infamous) Wing \u2014 a bold idea that didn\u2019t work how we\u2019d hoped. Now, after about two weeks with the phone, I have my answer: I hope the Galaxy S25 Edge is a one-and-done.\nI know, I know, that sounds dramatic. In fact, in a vacuum, the Galaxy S25 Edge probably does everything Samsung hoped for. It\u2019s powerful in small doses, feels durable to carry through a busy day, and is about as slim as my mind can comprehend. If those were the only criteria I had to grade it on, it would pass with flying colors. I would even be willing to give it some of the same grace that I give flip phones, acknowledging their hardware limitations without giving them a total pass.\nThe Galaxy S25 Edge banks on being thin, but that's not enough of a reason for me to recommend it.\nMost of the time, the Galaxy S25 Edge is even more limited than a Galaxy Z Flip 6 ($1099.99 at Samsung). Yes, they\u2019re both ambitious form factors, and yes, they both have just two rear cameras compared to Samsung\u2019s usual three, but that feels more like a perk of the Flip and a drawback of the Edge. See, I like the fact that I can grab Samsung\u2019s most recent flip phone, slip it into my pocket, and go about my day. When I need to check on something, I can usually do it from the power-sipping Flex Window, which helps ease my inevitable battery anxiety. I can let the two rear cameras do more than their usual workload, doubling as high-resolution selfie shooters with reliable wide and ultrawide fields of view. I can even tap into most of the Galaxy AI features I\u2019ve come to rely on, all without ever unfolding the hinge.\nHowever, when I need to check something on the Galaxy S25 Edge, I may as well check it on the Galaxy S25 Plus ($999.99 at Amazon). I have to pull the big 6.7-inch slab out of my pocket, fire up its entire display, and hope that I\u2019m done before the battery starts to tick away too quickly. And, if I\u2019m doing all that, I may as well do it on the Galaxy S25 Plus itself since the battery life is better, the charging is faster, and the cameras are more flexible thanks to the 10MP telephoto sensor. On top of it all, the Galaxy S25 Plus is cheaper \u2014 and if you don\u2019t care about the latest chip, the very similar Galaxy S24 Plus is likely available for even less on sale.\nHonestly, for the money, I think I\u2019d even take Samsung\u2019s smaller Galaxy S25 ($809.99 at Amazon) over the Edge. No, that phone might not be as technically impressive \u2014 if we\u2019re still going to give being thin that much credit \u2014 but it once again comes out ahead on battery life and camera flexibility. It\u2019s also quite a bit cheaper than the Edge, and I think its more traditional cooling setup gives me hope that it\u2019ll age better than the twice-as-bright, half-as-long Edge might. If you want to spend a little more money, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 Ultra ($1299.99 at Amazon) is probably its best flagship phone to date, even though the design remains a bit played out. It has all of the camera flexibility that the Edge lacks, and the S Pen is a go-to for power users, even if it\u2019s been simplified to little more than a basic stylus.\nLooking outside the Samsung bubble, I think most of the Edge\u2019s rivals offer better bang for about the same number of bucks, too. Google\u2019s Pixel 9 Pro XL ($1099 at Amazon) and Apple\u2019s iPhone 16 Pro ($999 at Amazon) or Pro Max ($1199 at Amazon) won\u2019t be as thin or as light, and they\u2019ll offer differing slates of AI-powered features, but they have many of the same strengths as the other Galaxy S25 options. In Google\u2019s case, we continue to fall in love with its clever camera tricks, prompt software updates, and the fact that its hardware has improved by leaps and bounds over the previous generation. The Pro Pixels also charge faster than the Galaxy S25 Edge and have bigger batteries, so even though the Tensor G4 still tends to run warm, it still manages to counteract most of my battery anxiety.\nThin phone obsession isn't going anywhere, but I hope the next generation doesn't require quite so many crucial sacrifices.\nI also want to throw the OnePlus 13 ($899.99 at OnePlus) out as a competitor. Where Samsung decided to make cuts to make its Galaxy S25 Edge as slim as possible, OnePlus chose to pack its latest flagship with more and more. It has sharper, more flexible cameras that zoom to 120x, and the Hasselblad color profile is among my favorites. OnePlus earns points for its massive 6,000mAh battery and 80W wired charging, too, along with 50W wireless charging and a cool new magnetic charger that works with compatible cases. It\u2019s not quite the same as Qi2, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction.\nDespite my vain hopes that the Edge will be a one-off, it\u2019s pretty clear the thin phone obsession isn\u2019t going anywhere. With the long-rumored iPhone 17 Air on the way and various concepts in the works at other Android OEMs, the S25 Edge is the dawn of a new form factor for larger display smartphones (we\u2019ve seen plenty of thin phones before, after all). I just hope the next generation doesn\u2019t require quite so many crucial sacrifices for the sake of the undeniable wow factor.\n- Incredibly slim design\n- Impressively lightweight\n- Great materials\n- Improved One UI experience\n- Solid primary cameras\n- Poor thermals\n- Mediocre battery life\n- No telephoto camera\n- Slow wired charging\nThank you for being part of our community.

  "argos_summary": "Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S26 Edge battery capacity has been confirmed by a 3C certification listing, showing a rated 4,078\u202fmAh cell that will be marketed as 4,200\u202fmAh. The leak confirms a modest upgrade over the 3,900\u202fmAh S25\u202fEdge, but falls short of the 4,400\u202fmAh figure floated by some rumors. Samsung remains committed to lithium\u2011ion chemistry rather than silicon\u2011carbon, and the new battery will fit into the 5.5\u202fmm ultra\u2011thin chassis expected for the S26\u202fEdge. The certification also signals Samsung\u2019s intent to address battery\u2011life complaints while keeping the device\u2019s slim profile.",
