  "content": "Several senior Federal Reserve officials on Friday characterized the labor market as \"solid\" even after a poor July jobs report, and appeared in no rush to lower U.S. interest rates.\n\n\"I would say the state of the labor market is one ... I would describe as solid, but we're definitely seeing a slowing of job growth,\" said John Williams, president of the New York Fed, in an interview Friday with the Wall Street Journal.\n\nCleveland Fed President Beth Hammack and Atlanta Fed chief Raphael Bostic on Friday also called the labor market solid, indicating the Fed is going to wait for more information on employment and inflation before deciding to cut interest rates again.\n\nWall Street bettors raised the odds of a Fed rate cut in mid-September after the July employment report on Friday showed a rapid slowdown in hiring during the late spring and summer.\n\nWilliams said he would keep an \"open mind\" about cutting rates, but he said the Fed still has to ensure that inflation remains contained. The latest reading of the Fed's favorite inflation gauge showed an uptick in inflation in June that appeared to be partly fueled by tariffs.\n\nThe 12-month rate of inflation based on the Fed's preferred core PCE price index stood at 2.8% in June, well above the bank's 2% target.\n\nA pair of Williams' colleagues, Fed governors Chris Waller and Michele Bowman, dissented in Wednesday's 9-2 vote to leave a key interest rate unchanged. They contended the labor market was weaker than other Fed officials believed, and said any inflation from the tariffs would not prove to be long-lasting.\n\nWilliams said he thinks inflation will gradually move down to the Fed's 2% target over the next year, but he took more of a wait-and-see attitude.\n\n\"Inflation will pick up some this year due to the effects of tariffs. Then we'll see inflation coming down next year and reaching our 2% goal in 2027,\" he said.\n\nWilliams also stuck to his view that the labor market was in pretty good shape, pointing to low unemployment and a low rate of layoffs.\n\n\"We're having the low-hire, low-fire economy now,\" he said.\n\nBefore cutting interest rates, Williams said, the Fed has to be convinced it's achieving both of its legally mandated goals of low inflation and a healthy jobs market.\n\n\"We're in a situation where inflation is above our target, labor market is still solid, but there are risks to those and we want to get that balance,\" he said.\n\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

New York Fed President John Williams noted a slowdown in job growth but emphasized the need to monitor inflation, which remains above the Fed's 2% target. While some officials expressed concerns about the labor market's strength, Williams maintained that inflation could gradually decline to the target by 2027, suggesting the Fed will wait for more data before making any rate adjustments.",
