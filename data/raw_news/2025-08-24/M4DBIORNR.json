  "description": "Going gave Southwest Airlines and Salt Lake City International Airport the top spots for travel deals in their first ever awards.",
  "content": "\u2022 Going.com ranked the best value airports and airlines based on their proprietary deal data.\n\u2022 Salt Lake City, Tampa, and Atlanta airports offer the best domestic deals, while Orlando, Newark, and JFK offer the best international deals.\n\u2022 Southwest, American, and United are the top three airlines most likely to offer flight deals.\n\nAirfares are famously opaque, but the experts at Going.com unveiled new rankings that can help you feel assured you're getting a good deal the next time you fly.\n\nIn their first-ever Flight Deal Awards, the airfare booking and deals site released a list of the top airports and airlines for value airfares.\n\n\u201cThe reason why I really love these awards is because a lot of the focus has been looking at airlines by quality, looking at how much they\u2019re flying, what\u2019s the biggest airport, or very easily quantifiable categories,\" Scott Keyes, the founder and chief flight expert at Going.com, told USA TODAY in an interview. \"What matters (to consumers) is how much the ticket costs, that\u2019s what matters at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nWith these awards, Keyes said, Going was able to put that cost principle front and center.\n\nAccording to Going, the rankings were compiled using \"proprietary deal data across thousands of routes.\"\n\nAccording to Going.com, these are the top three airports for domestic travel deals:\n\nAnd these are the departure points for the best international fares:\n\nAccording to Keyes, the average prices at each airport represent airfares that Going members book through the site. The percentage \"off\" means how much less those prices are than the overall average for airfares out of that airport.\n\nGoing.com also examined airlines and their likelihood of offering flight deals. Here were the rankings:\n\nAccording to Going, these airline rankings are based on the company's proprietary data which factors in deal frequency, quality and average savings compared to typical market fares.\n\nKeyes acknowledged that airfares can be hard to predict, but said there are some good rules of thumb for general booking.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the million-dollar question because airfare is the most volatile purchase that people regularly make,\" he said. \u201cWe have this misconception that there\u2019s a singular price, but in reality, that price is constantly changing, not just by the week, but it\u2019s changing by the day, sometimes by the hour, so it\u2019s no surprise that it\u2019s extremely difficult.\u201d\n\nTypically, travelers should expect to spend about $550 for a round-trip flight to Europe in economy, and slightly more to Asia, so long as they're not planning to travel during a peak period, for example. Anything less than that, Keyes said, is usually a pretty good deal.\n\nKeyes said for travelers with some planning flexibility, the best idea is to search for airfare first.\n\n\u201cThe way that most people plan their vacations, they do a three-step process, they decide where they want to go, they decide when they want to go there, and then only in step three do they look at flights. Take that same three-step process and just flip it on its head,\" he said. \u201cBy setting price as the top priority rather than the last priority, that\u2019s how people are able to get really cheap flights for their vacations and take three or four trips for the price of what they used to pay for one.\u201d\n\nKeyes added that the cheapest fares are usually available 1-3 months before departure for domestic flights and a little bit longer ahead of international flights, though it's best to book even earlier for peak travel periods.\n\nIt also helps to be flexible in your travel plans. If you're not married to a particular time of day or day of the week for your departure, you may be able to unlock lower airfares. Traveling during off-peak seasons can help you find deals as well.\n\nBeing willing to try secondary airports can be a good way to find lower airfares, too.\n\n\u201cThe only other thing that I would say is we talk about keeping an eye on nearby airports. I think people\u2019s initial tendency is to think of that as a sacrifice,\u201d he said. \u201cFor some trips, it can actually end up not just saving you a lot of money, it can actually save you time.\u201d",
