  "title": "UCLA Bruins Coach Blasts Reporters in Most Polite Way Possible",
  "description": "UCLA Bruins coach Deshaun Foster took aim at the media, but did it politely.",
  "content": "Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nThe UCLA Bruins' football program has long been a struggling entity, participating in just two bowl games since 2018. Last year, UCLA went just 5-7 in Deshaun Foster's debut as head coach, so now, Foster is attempting to change things up.\n\nFoster has taken a rather firm stance in limiting media availability to his team this season, restricting reporters from access to Bruins practices and even player interviews.\n\nMore news: Deion Sanders, Colorado May Have Found Their Travis Hunter Replacement\n\nRecently, the former NFL running back was asked about his policy in a press conference, and he took the media to task in the most polite way you can imagine.\n\n\"Yeah, you guys film our practice and put it online,\" Foster said. \"If I was an opponent for another team, I'd look right at your guys' stuff and see what's going on. ... That's why it's closed.\"\n\nFoster added that player interviews are \"the same thing\" because it would lead to reporters then asking Foster follow-up questions on what the players said. He also said that he isn't worried about the marketing side of things because \"if you win games, you're marketed.\"\n\nWinning games isn't something UCLA did a whole lot of last year, but the Bruins did post three straight winning campaigns between 2021 and 2023. However, UCLA has not recorded a double-digit win season since 2014, and the school has only finished the season ranked in the top 25 once in the last decade.\n\nObviously, the Bruins are more known for their historic basketball program, but it's not like they are complete lightweights on the football circuit.\n\nUCLA made the jump to the Big Ten last year, so the Bruins certainly have a tough 2025 schedule ahead of them. They currently have three ranked opponents on their slate, including matchups with No. 2 Penn State and No. 3 Ohio State.\n\nWe'll see if Foster's media strategy will end up paying off for UCLA.\n\nFor more on college football, head to Newsweek Sports.",

They are ranked No. 1 in the AP poll, and many are deeming them national championship favorites thanks much in part to Arch Manning's presence under center.\nBased on the talent-laden roster, it's hard not to like Texas right now, but is it possible we are overrating the Longhorns?\nMore news: Clemson's Frustrating Transfer Portal Stance Lands Harsh Reality Check\nThe Athletic recently ran projections using a statistical model to determine how the college football landscape will shape up this year, and it does not seem to like Texas as much as you would think.\nThe Longhorns are the ninth-ranked team in the projections and are being predicted to finish with a record of 9-3. Two SEC teams \u2014 Georgia and Alabama \u2014 are ranked ahead of Texas, and the Longhorns are only being given a 64 percent chance of making the College Football Playoff.\nWe have seen this type of thing happen plenty of times before. Teams do get overhyped, and there actually are reasons to be worried about Texas going into the new campaign.\nOne of the biggest causes for concern is the Longhorns' offensive weapons, particularly in the receiving corps. Both Matthew Golden and Isaiah Bond made the jump to the NFL during the offseason, as did running back Jaydon Blue.\nFor as talented as Manning may be, it could be difficult for the young quarterback to overcome a dearth of proven weapons at his disposal, although there is also reason to believe that Texas may have a diamond in the rough. Stanford transfer Emmett Mosley V, for example, could comprise a breakout talent in Austin.\nMore news: Insider Reveals Major Red Flag for Clemson QB Cade Klubnik\nRegardless, the Longhorns are certainly no shoo-in to make a deep playoff run, and they are not quite as loaded as last year's Ohio State Buckeyes squad, who defeated Texas in the Cotton Bowl en route to a national championship.\nIronically enough, the Longhorns will face Ohio State in their season opener next Saturday.\nFor more on college football, head to Newsweek Sports.\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nAbout the writer\nMatthew Schmidt is a sportswriter who covers NFL, MLB, NBA and college football and basketball.

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nDeion Sanders and the Colorado Buffaloes were lucky enough to have a generational talent in their employ over the last couple of seasons, but now, Travis Hunter has departed for the NFL, leaving a gaping hole for Colorado on both sides of the ball.\nHunter played wide receiver and cornerback for the Buffaloes and managed to play both positions at an elite level, leading to the phenom being crowned the Heisman Trophy winner last year.\nMore news: Texas Longhorns Receive Concerning Prediction\nBut what will Sanders and Colorado do now that Hunter is no longer in Boulder? The Buffaloes will have to find a solution somewhere, but the good news is that they already may have an answer on their roster.\nThe Athletic recently published a piece in which it raved about a couple of transfers Colorado landed this offseason: running back Dekalon Taylor and wide receiver Sincere Brown. Both are viewed as explosive weapons, and while neither may exactly be as good as Hunter (few are), they could at least help fill the void.\n\"With projected starter Dallan Hayden expected to miss the game with a hand injury, Taylor, a 5-9, 165-pound former slot receiver from Incarnate Word, will get more work alongside sophomore Micah Welch,\" The Athletic wrote. \"Taylor's breakaway speed has caught the attention of teammates in camp.\"\nTaylor rushed for 909 yards and nine touchdowns on six yards per carry during his final season at Incarnate Word in 2024.\n\"Brown, a 6-5, 190-pound target, had a breakout 1,000-yard season at Campbell last fall and is expected to see a lot of snaps alongside Dre'lon Miller and Omarion Miller with three former starting receivers including Hunter off to the NFL,\" The Athletic concluded.\nMore news: Clemson's Frustrating Transfer Portal Stance Lands Harsh Reality Check\nTaylor and Brown are certainly players to watch heading into the regular season and will be called upon to uplift a Colorado offense that not only lost Hunter, but also quarterback Shedeur Sanders and fellow receiver Jimmy Horn Jr.\nOf course, Hunter is the most prominent weapon to replace, but perhaps someone like Taylor can step in and provide the Buffaloes with that game-breaking option. Then there is Brown, who should present a great red-zone target for Colorado this fall.\nFor more on college football, head to Newsweek Sports.\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nAbout the writer\nMatthew Schmidt is a sportswriter who covers NFL, MLB, NBA and college football and basketball.
