  "description": "McDonald's has added many new items to the menu over the summer including the return of the Snack Wrap and Spicy McMuffins to entice customers.",
  "content": "McDonald's is serving up a summer of new menu items, plus specials \u2013 and is loving the results.\n\nThis summer, McDonald's has leaned into new and limited-time menu items, as a move to attract more customers \u2013 returnees, as well as new and lapsed ones. Spring brought offerings such as McCrispy Strips (now part of the permanent menu) and limited-time items including Squishmallows Happy Meals, \u201cA Minecraft Movie\u201d Happy Meals and the Hershey's S\u2019mores McFlurry.\n\nSince late June, McDonald's released a quintet of new menu items including a new double cheeseburger, the Daily Double (to be on the menu through 2025), and the return of Snack Wraps after a nine-year absence.\n\nMcDonald's chairman and CEO Chris Kempczinski hopes the wave of new items \u2013 along with its popular $5 Meal Deal and McValue Menu, both expected to run through the end of the year \u2013 will lead to another successful sales boost, similar to the 5% boost in revenue and 2.5% increase in same-store U.S. sales McDonald's saw from April 1-June 31.\n\nThose financial results, released Aug. 6, represent an improvement from McDonald's sluggish start in 2025, which brought a 3% revenue decline and 3.6% dip in U.S. sales during the company's first quarter (Jan. 1-March 31).\n\n\u201cCompelling value, standout marketing, and menu innovation\" helped drive the second quarter performance, Kempczinski said in the report.\n\nHere's what you need to know about McDonald's menu newest offerings.\n\nThe Snack Wrap, made up of one of McDonald's new all-white chicken meat McCrispy Strips, lettuce and cheese in a flour tortilla, returned to the menu July 10 (available in Ranch and Spicy flavors).\n\nThe first weekend it hit the menu, Snack Wraps brought in diehard McDonald's fans \u2013 many who had already visited the restaurant 56 times in 2025, more than two times the average McDonald's customer \u2013 according to a July 14 survey of 206 verified receipt-based early buyers of McDonald\u2019s Snack Wraps conducted by market research firm Numerator.\n\nAs for Snack Wraps, 90% of buyers would be willing to buy them again, according to the survey. \"For McDonald's, (limited time offerings) function as much a loyalty driver as they do an acquisition tool,\" Mitch Louch, principal strategist at Numerator, told USA TODAY.\n\nThe $2.99 a\u0300 la carte price is expected to remain throughout 2025, Kempczinski said Aug. 6 during a conference call with investment analysts, according to a transcript from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nYou can also order a combo meal with two Snack Wraps, a medium fry and a drink of choice.\n\nThe Blueberry & Cre\u0300me Pie, which hit the menu on June 27, is served warm and described as \"a twist on the classic McDonald\u2019s sleeved pie,\" according to the fast food chain's online menu spotter.\n\nThe pie will remain available nationwide through most of the summer (expected departure date is Sept. 1).\n\nAt the end of June, McDonald's made the Daily Double cheeseburger available nationwide. Previously only available in limited markets the burger will be available nationally through 2025, the company says.\n\nThe burger, made with two beef patties, a slice of American cheese plus shredded lettuce, slivered onions, mayo and two tomato slices, is a bit different from the McDouble. The McDouble cheeseburger also has two patties and just one slice of cheese, plus pickles, diced onions, ketchup and mustard \u2013 no lettuce, tomato or mayo \u2013 and can be ordered as a Bacon McDouble, too..\n\nAs of July 22, you could order a Daily Double McValue Meal Deal ($6 or $7; pricing depends on your restaurant) with a 4-piece order of Chicken McNuggets, small fries, and a small soft drink.\n\nMcDonald's added three spicy breakfast menu items as of July 8: the Spicy McMuffin, Spicy Sausage McMuffin, and Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg. The spicier take on the dish is part of the fast food chain's 50th anniversary celebrations for the McMuffin.\n\nThis limited-time dessert offering, which arrived on the menu June 10, blends pieces of Hershey's Milk Chocolate, graham crackers, and marshmallows with McDonald's vanilla soft serve.\n\nLil McDonald's Happy Meals: also still on McDonald's menu\n\nLil McDonald's Happy Meals remain available for a limited time, while supplies last, following their July 1 arrival. Among the 21 toys are miniature versions of food plates, ordering kiosks, delivery trucks, checkout registers, french fries, soft drink machines, and restaurant seating booths.\n\nA month ahead of summer, McDonald's brought back Squishmallows Happy Meals, which come with one of a dozen plush toys, for the first time since December 2023. The meals became available May 13 and have left the menu.\n\nA sign of their popularity? Individual toys are still priced as high as $50 on eBay and complete sets of the Squishmallow toys are priced at about $70.\n\nNew Happy Meals coming soon to McDonald's: McDonaldLand Meals, as soon as Aug. 12, with collectible tins filled with postcards, stickers and more items paying tribute to a McDonald's fantasy world introduced in 1971, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles x Hello Kitty and Friends Happy Meals, each with the figurine of a mashed-up Turtles and Kitty character (starting Aug. 12).\n\nAnother summertime move by McDonald's: a majority of U.S. locations are staying open until midnight or later throughout the summer, the company announced in May.\n\nWhile McDonald's is pleased with the spring and early summer, Kempczinski said during the Aug. 6 earnings call he wasn't ready to claim a victory in the current three-month period, saying \"we remain cautious about the overall near-term health of the U.S. consumer.\"\n\nMike Snider is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

McDonaldland shake, a side of fries, and a customer's choice of either a Quarter Pounder with Cheese or 10-piece McNuggets, according to an Aug. 5 news release. The shake pays ode to a volcano from McDonaldland with the vibrant drink representing blue \"lava\" and pink clouds.\nThe company also announced the launch of limited-edition merch inspired by McDonaldland through collaborations with clothing brand Pacsun and accessories retailer Away.\nThe Pacsun collaborations will feature sweat sets and graphic tees available as soon as Aug. 12, while the Away collaboration will include luggage tags and bag charms available starting Aug. 18 while supplies last, McDonald's said.\nWhat is McDonaldland?\nMcDonaldland is McDonald's promotional fantasy world that debuted in 1971 and was featured in games and movies.\nThe fictional world is home to quirky landmarks from Apple Pie Trees and Hamburger Patches to the volcanic yet vibrant Mt.

The Meal Deal has set off a value meal war among competitors.\nMcDonald's $5 Meal Deal hit the fast food chain's menu this summer as a limited-time offer, but now it's staying on the menu into the fall.\nBack in June, McDonald's debuted the $5 Meal Deal: You get a McDouble or McChicken sandwich, a four-piece order of Chicken McNuggets, small fries and a small soft drink. The bargain combo \"is sticking around, with a majority of local markets extending into December,\" the company said in a news release Thursday.\nThe $5 Meal Deal, along with Wendy's breakfast bundles, set off a value meal war, which escalated over the summer with fast-food chains including Jack in the Box and White Castle joining in, as did restaurants like Chili's and Olive Garden.\nWhy McDonald's Meal Deal took off\nFor McDonald's, the meal's arrival helped boost the chain's approval among lower-income customers hit hardest by higher food prices, and helped shift \"sentiment towards the brand around value and affordability,\" McDonald's USA President Joseph Erlinger said in July.\nMcDonald's sold tens of millions of $5 Meal Deals over the summer, he said in a statement.\n\u201cTogether with our franchisees, we're committed to keeping our prices as affordable as possible, which is why we\u2019re doubling down with even more ways to save,\" Erlinger said.\nFun fast food fact: 67% of $5 Meal Deals were ordered with McDoubles, while 33% had a McChicken, McDonald's says.\nShake Shack: Football season is back and the chain is giving away chicken sandwiches to celebrate\nMcDonald's deals beyond the $5 Meal Deal\nMcDonald's has more deals planned for the coming weeks. One that's still ongoing is Free Fries Fridays, a deal that gets you a free medium order of fries with any purchase of $1 or more.\nFor National Cheeseburger Day, a made-up holiday observed on Sept. 18, McDonald's will have 50-cent Double Cheeseburger deal.\nCustomers should also check out the McDonald's app because additional local deals may be found there. Among the recent offers: two for $3.99 choice of Chicken or Sausage McGriddle, Sausage Biscuit or Any Size Iced Coffee (in Southern California) or a $5 20-piece order of McNuggets (in Dallas).\n\"Whether you\u2019re stopping by for breakfast, lunch, dinner or a late-night snack, we want everyone to find the food they love at a price that hits the spot,\" Erlinger said. \"The extension of the $5 Meal Deal, and the other offerings we\u2019re announcing for our fall line-up, are just a few of the ways we\u2019re working hard to offer great meals at a fair price.\u201d\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\nWhat's everyone talking about?

Yes, you read that right \u2012 breast milk.\nFrida launched its breast milk-flavored ice cream earlier this year and, understandably, the limited-edition item got a lot of attention. Now, the viral flavor is available for purchase online, with shipping available nationwide.\nFor the past few days, Frida and OddFellows have been promoting the ice cream flavor on social media and the internet is going crazy, with countless users confused about the ice cream's ingredients.\n\"Taste it for yourself,\" reads the caption on Frida's post showing a tank truck with \"Breast Milk Ice Cream\" emblazoned on the side.\nHere's what to know about Frida and OddFellows' Breast Milk Ice Cream:\nIs it really made of breast milk?\nTo address the elephant in the room, no, Frida and OddFellows' Breast Milk Ice Cream is not made of real, human breast milk. The flavor of the ice cream is supposed to mimic it.\nHere's the full ingredient list, per a Frida's statement: milk, heavy cream, skim milk powder, sugar, dextrose, egg yolks, invert sugar, guar gum, salted caramel flavoring, honey syrup, liposomal bovine colostrum, yellow food color, 0.1% propylparaben (preservative), and FD&C Red 40.\nWhat does breast milk ice cream taste like?\nThe breast milk ice cream is \"sweet, a little salty, smooth, with hints of honey and sprinkles of colostrum, and features a distinct colostrum yellow tinge,\" according to Frida's statement.\nWhere to buy breast milk ice cream\nThe breast milk ice cream is available, while supplies last, on the Frida website.\nThe flavor will also be available at a pop-up event at OddFellows' location in Dumbo, Brooklyn, New York, from Aug. 5-10. Free scoops of the flavor will be offered between noon and 1 p.m. local time on Aug. 6 and Aug. 10.\nHow much is a pint of breast milk ice cream?\nOne pint of Frida and OddFellows' Breast Milk Ice Cream is $12.99, according to a Frida's statement. Customers must purchase two pints when making an order online.\nWhy breast milk?\nTrying one's breastmilk isn't a new concept and several celebrities have had viral moments for trying their own, including Kourtney Kardashian, Ashley Graham and Coco Austin. This widespread love for breastmilk is what inspired the ice cream flavor, a Frida's statement says.\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to add clarifying information.\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

      "text": "The Snack Wrap is back at McDonald's: What to know, when you can order it\nThe wait is over.\nAfter months of teasing from McDonald's, the day has arrived for the Snack Wrap to return. Customers can order the much-anticipated menu item starting Thursday, July 10.\nThe item is available in two flavors:\n- Spicy: The Spicy Snack Wrap brings the heat with a habanero kick that fans know and love from the Spicy McCrispy sandwich.\n- Ranch: The Ranch Snack Wrap delivers a satisfying burst of cool ranch goodness, with hints of garlic and onion.\nThe Snack Wrap is available a la carte or as a combo meal, which includes two Snack Wraps, a medium fry and a drink of choice. The item costs $2.99 a la carte.\nCustomers can order the Snack Wrap after breakfast hours. Breakfast hours differ by McDonald's location, although most locations typically stop serving breakfast at 10:30 or 11 a.m. local time.\nWhen was the Snack Wrap discontinued?\nThe Snack Wrap first hit the McDonald's menu in 2006. Over the next decade, it appeared on the menu in several different iterations, according to the Food Network, but with the same main ingredients of chicken breast meat (grilled or crispy), lettuce, cheese and sauce in a soft flour tortilla.\nAccording to McDonald's, the Snack Wrap was phased out nationally in 2016, but it \"never left fans\u2019 hearts.\"\n\"From countless social media posts to full-fledged petitions, they never gave up on their favorite menu item. They\u2019re the ones who inspired us to make its return to the menu happen,\" McDonald's said.\nWhat is in a McDonald's Snack Wrap?\nThe Snack Wrap features one of McDonald's new McCrispy Strips, topped with shredded lettuce and shredded cheese and wrapped in a soft flour tortilla, according to the chain.\nMcDonald's also adds new spicy breakfast items to menu\nIn addition to the Snack Wrap, McDonald's has unveiled a series of new options to \"spice up\" its breakfast menu as part of the chain's 50th anniversary celebrations for the McMuffin.\nThe three new spicy breakfast menu items include the Spicy McMuffin, Spicy Sausage McMuffin and Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg. The items feature the traditional ingredients of cheese, egg, Canadian bacon or sausage and a buttered English muffin, but are topped with a new Spicy Pepper Sauce, according to McDonald's.\nThe new breakfast items dropped in stores on 8 and will be around for a limited time at participating locations, according to the fast food chain.\nMcDonald's launched the Egg McMuffin in 1975. The breakfast item was the brainchild of Herb Peterson, a McDonald's franchisee in Santa Barbara, California.\nContributing: Greta Cross, USA TODAY\nGabe Hauari is a national trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

      "text": "McDonald's suffers decline in US sales amid volatile economy, worst since 2020\nA reduction of low and middle-income customers is one of the main reasons for the drop in sales, Chris Kempczinski, McDonald's chairman and CEO, said during an earnings call.\nMcDonald's is the latest fast food chain to report a decrease in sales amid a turbulent and volatile U.S. economy impacted by tariffs and inflation.\nThe Chicago, Illinois-headquartered chain announced the decline on May 1 in an earnings report that shared results of its first quarter, which ended on March 31. According to the report, McDonald's had a 3% drop in revenue, and same-store sales in the U.S. dropped 3.6% from the prior year, marking the most significant decline since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\u201cMcDonald's has a 70-year legacy of innovation, leadership, and proven agility, all of which give us confidence in our ability to navigate even the toughest of market conditions and gain market share,\" Chris Kempczinski, McDonald's chairman and CEO, said in the report. \"Consumers today are grappling with uncertainty, but they can always count on McDonald\u2019s for both exciting new menu items and delicious favorites for exceptional value, from a brand they love.\u201d\nLike McDonald's, other fast food chains are experiencing similar economic issues, with some even closing or considering closing locations, such as Jack in the Box, Wendy's and Burger King. The number of struggling chains could grow as they begin to feel the effects of President Donald Trump's tariffs, which are expected to make ingredients even more pricey over time.\nWhy is McDonald's experiencing a decline in sales?\nDuring an earnings call, Kempczinski attributed the decrease in sales to the volatility of the fast food industry and a drop in lower and middle-income customers compared to a year ago.\nMeanwhile, higher-income traffic remains steady, which the McDonald's CEO said illustrates \"the divided U.S. economy where low and middle-income consumers in particular are being weighed down by the cumulative impact of inflation and heightened anxiety about the economic outlook.\"\nWhat is McDonald's doing to increase sales?\nAccording to Kempczinski, McDonald's is \"expanding and refining\" its value items to meet the needs of low and middle-income customers. He added that McDonald's now has \"everyday affordable price menus\" and \"entry-level meal bundles\" in each of its big five internationally operated markets.\nThe fast food chain does offer a McValue menu, which includes items like the McDouble, McChicken and 4-piece Chicken McNuggets at discounted prices. Additionally, McDonald's $5 Meal Deal offers a variety of classic meals.\n\"These are the building blocks of what good value means to us,\" Kempczinski said.\nKempczinski also said McDonald's intends to continue introducing \"innovative new products\" like the McCripsy Strips, and executing \"world-class promotional and marketing campaigns\" to bring customers back. He referenced the partnership McDonald's did in conjunction with the \"Minecraft Movie,\" which included in-store collectibles for \"fans young and old.\"\nAre all fast food chains experiencing a decline in sales?\nWhile McDonald's and others are feeling the weight of the struggling U.S. economy, some other fast food chains are not, including Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC). The chains reported an increase in guest traffic due to recent promotional deals they've been pushing.\nYum! Brands, Inc., which owns KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and The Habit Burger Grill, reported its first quarter ended (March 31) with an overall 13% increase. Taco Bell U.S. same-store sales growth was 9%, while KFC International's same-store sales grew 7%."
