Brenden Queen, driver of the #1 Best Repair Company Toyota, waves to fans as he walks onstage during driver intros before the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series Rackley Roofing 200 at Nashville Superspeedway on June 28, 2024 in Lebanon, Tennessee.\n\nHow to Watch General Tire 100 at The Glen\n\nLawless Alan is second in the points standings, 33 points behind Queen. Lavar Scott sits in third, 46 behind Queen. It's been a close championship battle, but Queen is starting to create a bit of separation between himself and the others.\n\nThis is the second road course race of the season for ARCA. Back in June, the series visited Lime Rock Park in a race that saw Nitro Motorsports part-time driver Thomas Annunziata win over Alon Day, with Alan coming in third among the full-time drivers. Queen finished fourth in that race.\n\nIn addition to the full timers, Day is back this weekend, although Annunziata is not racing this weekend. One name to keep an eye on is Brent Crews in the Joe Gibbs Racing No. 18 car, while 15-year-old Tristan McKee is set to make his series debut for Spire Motorsports in the No. 77.\n\nYou can live stream all the best racing action from around the world on Fubo, from stock car leagues like NASCAR and ARCA to open-wheel leagues like Formula 1 and IndyCar.
