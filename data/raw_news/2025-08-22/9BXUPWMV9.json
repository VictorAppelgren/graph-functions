  "title": "Armitage Shanks kiln closure 'a body blow' as 100 jobs at risk",
  "description": "Union members shocked after plans to close a ceramics factory's tunnel kiln in Rugeley are announced.",
  "content": "The planned closure of a kiln at a ceramics factory and the potential loss of about 100 jobs has come as a \"body blow\" to workers, a union has said. Chris Hoofe, of GMB, said staff were shocked at the announcement to close one of Armitage Shanks's tunnel kilns - a large continuous firing kiln through which products are transported on conveyors \u2013 in Rugeley, Staffordshire. It was the latest setback in the county's ceramics industry, which has seen the collapse of Stoke-on-Trent firms Royal Stafford and Heraldic Pottery in 2025. The Villeroy & Boch Group, which owns Armitage Shanks, said it was a \"difficult decision\" taken as part of a wider strategic realignment of its operations.\n\nMr Hoofe told BBC Radio Stoke: \"This is a body blow to everybody working at Armitage Shanks.\" He said 85 of the 100 potential redundancies were on the manufacturing side of the business, and the firm would also be reducing its product range. \"The high cost of energy makes decisions like this all the easier for businesses,\" he added. He said he spoke to someone at the site and they told him it had come as a \"bolt from the blue\" for the staff there.\n\nDave Robertson, Labour MP for Lichfield, said he was concerned about the potential impact on the people who worked at the site. \"Ceramics production in Armitage Shanks is not just livelihoods,\" he added, \"it's part of the heritage of our area.\" He said it would \"undoubtedly\" be a difficult time for anyone involved, and he would work with the company and trade unions to safeguard ceramics production at Armitage. Cannock Chase MP Josh Newbury, Labour, described it as \"worrying\" news and echoed previous comments from the GMB union, which said it would be \"bad for business and bad for Staffordshire\". \"Alongside my three Stoke-on-Trent colleagues, I will continue to advocate for a sector deal from the government for our ceramics industry,\" he added.\n\nArmitage Shanks was founded in 1817 and specialises in providing ceramics, fittings and other products to non-residential markets, including to the NHS and private hospitals. Villeroy & Boch Group confirmed the unions and employee representatives would be consulted on the planned closure of the kiln over a minimum 45-day period. \"This is an incredibly difficult announcement to make,\" said UK managing director Lisa Whitfield. \"We recognise the impact this proposal will have on our employees, their families and the community, and we are grateful for the dedication and hard work of our site manufacturing team.\"",

      "text": "How pottery sector reacted to industrial strategy\n- Published\n\"Pathetic\", \"a missed opportunity\", \"a four out of 10 at best\" \u2013 these were some of the phrases used by the pottery industry to describe the government's industrial strategy.\nThe 10-year plan announced on Monday confirmed 7,000 businesses would see electricity bills slashed by up to 25% from 2027, while 500 firms would get a 90% cut in network charges from 2026 under the British Industry Supercharger scheme.\nWhile some in Stoke-on-Trent and Staffordshire \u2013 the heart of the UK ceramics industry \u2013 cautiously welcomed it as a \"start\", many have been left disappointed.\nBusiness Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the sector was \"foundational\" to the UK and would benefit from the measures.\nThree firms in Stoke-on-Trent have collapsed since the start of 2025 \u2013 Royal Stafford, Heraldic Pottery and Moorcroft, though the latter was recently bought by the founder's grandson.\nMPs, companies, workers and unions have been calling on the government to support the industry, which has become beset by rising energy prices and falling sales.\nAfter the spending review came and went, ministers including Ed Miliband said support would be revealed in the Industrial Strategy.\nBut following its announcement, many questioned why ceramics was barely mentioned in the document and wondered where the actions were regarding the cost of gas \u2013 the dominant energy source in the industry.\nTrade association Ceramics UK accused the government of misleading and misunderstanding the sector.\nCeramics UK chief executive Rob Flello said: \"This represents a missed opportunity to back one of the UK's most enduring and strategically important manufacturing industries.\"\nFifth-generation ceramicist Emily Johnson, owner of Barlaston-based 1882 Ltd, had previously described the industry as being \"on its knees\".\nOn the industrial strategy, she said: \"Pathetic, is a word. I think that we've been let down again.\n\"But you know what, Stoke is resilient and we are not going to get the support that we need from them so we're just going to have to do it ourselves.\"\nBeverley Berry was one of the 57 workers at Moorcroft who lost her job, and she has been campaigning for government help ever since.\nShe said she was left \"disappointed\" by the strategy and questioned whether it was all worth it.\n\"I feel quite pessimistic about it. When I first heard the news and thought it was imminent that we were going to help, I thought it wasn't all in vain,\" she added.\nRachel Laver, CEO of Staffordshire Chamber of Commerce, gave the strategy a \"four out of 10 at best\" and said businesses needed support \"now\".\n\"Stoke-on-Trent is only mentioned once on page 41 \u2013 that's it,\" she said. \"If we were the steel industry, I think we would have had much more support thrown at us and we don't want to see more businesses go to the wall.\"\nThere were those who were cautiously optimistic, including Portmeirion boss Mike Raybould, who said the measures were \"a start\" but called for faster action.\n\"It's good that they're recognising and finally talking about the UK ceramics industry,\" he told BBC Radio Stoke.\n\"But we need to see the detail, we need to see faster action and I suspect we probably need to see more support as well.\"\nWhile the support with electricity bills was welcome, Mr Raybould said firms wanted to see support with gas prices too, describing it as the more \"dominant\" form of energy in the industry.\nMoorcroft's new owner Will Moorcroft, grandson of founder William Moorcroft, also said the measures were \"a start\" but were unlikely to make a huge difference.\n\"There's still a lot of work to be done and, without getting political, there could be quicker decisions that could be made to help business, whether it's national insurance or business rates,\" he said.\n'Foundational sector'\nIn his statement in the House of Commons, Reynolds said ceramics was \"recognised as a foundational sector\" in the strategy,\n\"Its principal request is about energy prices. There are some ceramics businesses - I accept not that many - that get the supercharger [discount] and will get the more generous rate.\"\nHe said, however, the costs of a lot of those businesses did not match the intensity test the supercharger discount was based on.\n\"That is exactly why the British industrial competitiveness scheme has been designed in such a way that they will benefit from it, and that will be a game-changer for them,\" he added.\nOn gas prices, he said they were projected to fall \"from the very significant level that they have been at\" in future financial years.\nGet in touch\nTell us which stories we should cover in Staffordshire\nFollow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.\nRelated topics\n- Published24 June\n- Published23 June\n- Published23 June\n- Published19 June\n- Published12 June"
