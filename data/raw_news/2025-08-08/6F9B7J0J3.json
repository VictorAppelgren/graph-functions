  "content": "Pip Edwards made a bold statement at an exclusive Ksubi event in Sydney on Thursday night.\n\nThe fashion designer, 44, treated party guests to a platter of cigarettes and endless booze during the glitzy launch of her new capsule collection with UK influencer Alicia Roddy.\n\nPip, who is known for her bold sense of style, shared a photo dump from the night to Instagram, showing her mingling with the socialite set and letting her hair down in true party-girl fashion.\n\nIn one photo, a chic tray stacked with cigarettes and matches was seen being offered at Paddington eatery 10 William St \u2013 a decadent nod to old-school party glamour.\n\n'It\u2019s been a whirlwind, crazy busy few days \u2026 but we are soooooo excited that our @ksubi x @lissyroddyy capsule has finally arrived... with the Queen herself in town!!! We love you Lissy!!!!!' Pip wrote alongside the photos.\n\nThe P.E Nation founder turned heads at the event in a white Ksubi crop top paired with an unbuttoned pinstriped jacket and matching wide-leg pants.\n\nPip wore her blonde hair tied in a bun and accessorised with statement jewellery.\n\nShe was all smiles as she posed with fashion insiders and influencers, including Ksubi fashion collaborator Alicia Roddy, cricket WAG Erin Holland and influencer Elle Ferguson.\n\nBut while the fashion set turned out in full force, there was one notable absence - Pip's best friend Jackie 'O' Henderson was nowhere to be seen.\n\nThe 50-year-old radio queen was missing from the stylish soir\u00e9e despite the pair being virtually inseparable in recent months.\n\nPip and Jackie have been close friends for years.\n\nThe fashion designer shared a sweet tribute to her bestie in January as the radio queen marked her 50th birthday milestone.\n\nPip took to Instagram to share two photos commemorating her friendship with the KIIS FM star.\n\nThe first image showed the pair huddling close as they happily enjoyed a drink.\n\nThe pair looked to be having a great time at what appeared to be Bondi hotspot Icebergs.\n\nCaptioning the sweet photo, Pip gave her close friend some high praise.\n\n'Wishing this Wonder Woman a very happy birthday,' Pip wrote. '50 has never looked so good!'\n\n'A true inspiration, the best supportive friend, and someone I love exploring and living life with! Happy birthday @jackieo_official.'\n\nPip followed up the sweet post with a second celebratory image showing the pair together.\n\nCaptioning the photo, Pip offered another round of best wishes with: 'happy birthday Jackie.'",
