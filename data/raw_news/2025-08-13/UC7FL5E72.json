  "content": "Vestas Wind Systems A/S (OTCPK:VWDRY) Q2 2025 Earnings Conference Call August 13, 2025 4:00 AM ET\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Vestas' Q2 investor presentation. And also here, let me start by extending a huge thank you to our customers, other stakeholders and, not least, colleagues around the globe. It has been busy and also a quarter with a certain degree of uncertainty in policy, not least for our more than 5,000 dear colleagues in the U.S.\n\nIt's also a warm welcome to Jakob, and you will have to bear a bit of patience until the financials before you listen to him. So welcome, Jakob.\n\nAnd with that, let's go to the key highlights of the quarter. So the quarter ended with a revenue of EUR 3.7 billion. That's an increase of 14% year-on-year. The EBIT margin ended at 1.5%. Onshore -- improved onshore project performance, lower warranty costs, offset by the offshore ramp-up cost, we'll speak more about that.\n\nThe order intake ended at 2 gigawatt, lower order intake year-on-year as customers have been awaiting policy clarity, particularly in the U.S. And definitely, we'll talk more about that. And then manufacturing ramp up, driving costs and investments. Onshore and offshore ramp-up is",
