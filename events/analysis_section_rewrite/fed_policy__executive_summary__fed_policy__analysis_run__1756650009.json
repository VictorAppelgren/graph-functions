      "feedback": "The draft fails to meet the Argos criteria: it lacks explicit canonical‑handle mapping (e.g., “DXY” → dxy, “10‑yr yield” → ust10y, “mortgage rates” → us_mortgage_rates), omits sign/magnitude ranges for each view, and does not tie every claim to a dated catalyst window with a clear causal path. Replace vague phrases (“could climb to roughly 97.0–97.5”) with precise ranges (e.g., “DXY 97.0–97.5, +200 bp from 95.8”), and attach the corresponding IDs (Z7O1DCHS7, 7XH2DKEKV). Add a bullet‑style, 4–6 sentence brief: 1) DXY is poised to rise 200 bp over 3–6 mo if CPI > expected on 2025‑08‑15, tariffs remain, and war risk persists (dxy +200 bp, catalyst 2025‑08‑15 CPI, 2025‑08‑11 tariffs, 2025‑08‑11 Zelenskiy). 2) A Fed cut on 2025‑09‑17 would compress the term premium, pushing DXY down 50–100 bp (dxy –50 bp, catalyst 2025‑09‑17 Fed). 3) A 2‑yr/10‑yr spread < 30 bp would add another 50–100 bp decline (dxy –50 bp, catalyst 2025‑09‑01 spread). 4) Watch CPI, Fed minutes, 2‑yr/10‑yr spread; invalidate if CPI < 2 % for two quarters or tariffs are lifted. Ensure each sentence ends with a single inline citation (e.g., (XTQIQRP5K), (Z7O1DCHS7)). Remove any mention of mortgage rates unless directly linked to DXY via term premium; if kept, state the mapping (us_mortgage_rates ↔ ust10y) and its effect on DXY. This will satisfy the handle, catalyst, and magnitude requirements while keeping the brief concise and decision‑useful.",
