      "feedback": "The draft is solid overall but needs a few tightening edits to meet the “truth‑over‑verbosity” and 3‑6‑month horizon requirements:\n\n1. **Dollar & Yield Ranges** – The 3 % dxy decline and 40 bp ust10y fall are too large for a 3‑6‑month view. Tighten to a 1–2 % dxy drop and 30–50 bp ust10y fall, citing the historical Fed‑cut‑yield relationship (e.g., add a generic assumption or cite a relevant source such as 7GU5QDMM4 if it discusses Fed policy impact on rates).  \n2. **Volatility** – The 15‑point VIX jump is aggressive; revise to 10–20 pts and note it as an assumption based on past Fed‑cut uncertainty.  \n3. **Horizon Consistency** – Remove the “through the first quarter of 2026” wording for the dollar; instead state “by December 2025” to stay within the 3‑6‑month window.  \n4. **Source Alignment** – Ensure every claim has a matching source:  \n   - Labor‑market → GK86UUQPN  \n   - Fed cut → 7GU5QDMM4 (policy stance)  \n   - Tariff ruling → B50S2PG8O (inflationary pressure)  \n   - Dollar/Yield/Vol assumptions → add a brief “Assuming historical correlation” note.  \n5. **Causal Chain Clarity** – Explicitly link each step: “Weak labor → Fed cuts → lower 10‑year yields → dollar weakness → equity decline → VIX rise.”  \n6. **Watch‑List** – Keep the August jobs, September PCE, Fed minutes, and Oct 14 tariff ruling as key catalysts; add a note that the tariff ruling is a catalyst window that could delay the Fed cut.  \n\nApply these edits to keep the analysis concise, defensible, and fully mapped to canonical handles with clear catalysts and magnitude ranges.",
