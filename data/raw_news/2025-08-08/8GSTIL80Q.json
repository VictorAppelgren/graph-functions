The tiny Kelly bag retailed for about $2,500 and was produced in eight colors including Orange H, Rouge H, Black, Noisette, Blue Saphir, Vert Olive, Vert Cru, and Rouge Vif. Orange H and Black are the most common colors available on the secondary market.

The bags have been regularly discontinued and then released in new limited edition colors and materials.\nHerm\u00e8s discontinued the Kelly Doll in 2005 and then started producing limited edition bags in 2008. These Herm\u00e8s Kelly Doll were mostly to mark the opening of new boutiques around the world. Through 2010 a number of new colors came out of the Pantin ateliers including Blue Jean, and Vermillion. For the 2010 opening of the Sogo boutique in Hong Kong a Kelly Doll was produced in 5P pink. After 2010 the Herm\u00e8s Kelly Doll was retired again, resulting in renewed interest from collectors and greater demand in the secondary market.\nIn 2015 Herm\u00e8s debuted a set of five unique Kelly Dolls Quelle Idole bags at the Leather Forever exhibition in Singapore to represent each decade of Singapore's independence. The pieces featured embroidery, beading, exotic skins and other unique elements and took months to complete. While these bags are though to have sold in a private auction, these bags haven't resurfaced on the secondary market. Beginning in 2017 the Herm\u00e8s Kelly Doll was no longer produced just for store openings or special events. Herm\u00e8s now offers the Kelly Doll to its top clients, including the ability to purchase special order bags in a range or colors and exotic leathers.\nHerm\u00e8s Kelly Doll Picto\nHerm\u00e8s introduced the newest Kelly Doll as part of its Spring/Summer 2022 collection. The new Herm\u00e8s Kelly Doll Picto is a completely redesigned and re-imagined take on the Herm\u00e8s Kelly Doll. The new design comes with a shoulder strap and has a pixel art style complete with a little backpack. The new Herm\u00e8s Kelly Doll Picto comes in Epsom leather and was initially released in three colors: Mauve Sylvestre, Nata and Bleu Saphir. It retailed for about $15,600 when it was first released in 2022 and now retails for $17,600 at Herm\u00e8s boutiques in the US (updated in 2025).\nHerm\u00e8s Kelly Doll Picto Price\nThe most expensive Herm\u00e8s Kelly Doll Picto sold for 571,500 HKD ($74,000) in 2023. It was the first Blue Saphir Kelly Doll Picto sold at Sotheby's. The first Kelly Doll Pictos to sell at Sotheby's in June 2023 sold for between $53,000 - $57,000 and where a Kelly Doll Picto Nata and Kelly Doll Picto Mauve Sylvestre. Prices for the Kelly Doll Picto have remained around $50,000 to $60,000 in 2024.

By Shelby Comroe Shelby Comroe Shelby Comroe is a New York City-based fashion editor and writer. InStyle's editorial guidelines Updated on March 31, 2024 @ 10:52AM In This Article View All In This Article Origins of the Kelly Bag Grace Kelly's Influence Breaking Down the Bag Variations of the Kelly Bag The Takeaway Close Credit: Getty Images Trends come and go, but a select few iconic pieces have consistently stood the test of time. Consider the Herm\u00e8s Birkin (introduced in 1984), the Chanel Classic Flap (1955), the Gucci Jackie (1961), and The Lady Dior (1995); these are not merely accessories, but pieces of fashion history. These handbags routinely appear on lists highlighting \u201cit-bags,\u201d \u201cbest investment bags,\u201d and \u201cmost classic bags\u201d a testament to their unwavering popularity and iconic status. However, it's important to acknowledge the original that set the stage for all others: the Herm\u00e8s Kelly. Introduced in 1935, the Kelly bag pioneered the concept of the luxury \u201cit-bag.\u201d Origins of the Kelly Bag Let\u2019s do a brief deep-dive on the history of Herm\u00e8s. The brand was established in 1837 by Thierry Herm\u00e8s, initially starting as a harness workshop (hence the ever-present equestrian influence.) In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, under the leadership of Thierry's son, Charles-\u00c9mile Herm\u00e8s, the company expanded its product range to include saddlery and began retailing at 24 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 in Paris, which remains its flagship store today. The 1930s marked a pivotal period for Herm\u00e8s, with \u00c9mile Herm\u00e8s\u2019 son-in-law, Robert Dumas, joining the business. Dumas was instrumental in diversifying the brand's offerings, introducing some of Herm\u00e8s' most iconic creations, like the silk scarf, Cha\u00eene d\u2019Ancre bracelet, and the revolutionary Sac \u00e0 D\u00e9p\u00eaches, later known as the Kelly bag. His vision and creativity during this period significantly shaped the brand's identity, cementing its status in the luxury goods market. The introduction of the Sac \u00e0 D\u00e9p\u00eaches was revolutionary for the time. Drawing inspiration from the Haut \u00e0 Courroies (HAC) bag, designed for equestrian gear, Dumas reimagined it into the more compact Sac \u00e0 D\u00e9p\u00eaches. Known for its distinctive trapezoid shape, single handle, and strap closures with a center toggle, the Kelly bag represented a significant departure from the era's smaller purses, essentially creating the first modern \"handbag\" as we know it. Each Kelly bag, handcrafted by a single artisan over 18 to 25 hours, showcases Herm\u00e8s' commitment to exclusivity and craftsmanship, available in various sizes, colors, and materials, including luxurious leathers and exotic skins. SEBASTIEN BOZON/AFP via Getty Images Grace Kelly's Influence Twenty years after the Herm\u00e8s Sac \u00e0 D\u00e9p\u00eaches was first designed, it landed the role of a lifetime in the glamorous world of cinema. The 1955 Alfred Hitchcock classic, \"To Catch a Thief,\" featured this iconic piece, thanks to 8-time Academy Award-winning costume designer, Edith Head. The film, starring Hollywood legends Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, became a backdrop for showcasing luxury and style. Grace Kelly's character, Frances Stevens, a wealthy American heiress vacationing on the French Riviera, epitomized 1950s glamor. Her wardrobe, filled with stunning gowns and chic ensembles, mirrored her sophisticated and affluent lifestyle, attending high-society events and staying at the finest hotels. Understanding the need for Frances's accessories to reflect her status, Edith Head selected the Hermes Sac \u00e0 D\u00e9p\u00eaches to complement Kelly's character. This decision not only highlighted Frances's wealth but also marked the beginning of the bag's journey into fashion history. At the time, Grace Kelly was one of the most famous figures worldwide. Her fondness for the Sac \u00e0 D\u00e9p\u00eaches was so great that rumors swirled about her refusal to part with the bag even after filming concluded. In a turn of events mirroring a story straight out of Hollywood, Kelly transitioned from the silver screen's royalty to actual monarchy by marrying Prince Rainier III of Monaco in 1956. The world was captivated by this real-life fairy tale, with the paparazzi desperate to capture every moment of the couple's life. The fascination with Kelly's new royal life reached a peak when she was photographed in 1956 using the Herm\u00e8s Sac \u00e0 D\u00e9p\u00eaches bag to hide her pregnancy bump. This iconic image graced the cover of Life magazine and catapulted the bag to unprecedented fame, marking its evolution into the world's first \"it-bag.\" Women worldwide flooded Herm\u00e8s boutiques looking for the \u201cKelly Bag.\u201d Herm\u00e9s officially renamed the bag in 1977. Keystone-France/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images Breaking Down the Bag Now that we\u2019ve gone over the history behind the bag let\u2019s break things down even further. First things first, the Kelly Bag has two different styles: Sellier and Retourne. The Herm\u00e8s Kelly Sellier, the bag's original style, pays homage to the brand's equestrian heritage with its name, \"Sellier,\" meaning saddler in French. Characterized by its visible stitching and pronounced edges, the Kelly Sellier showcases the meticulous craftsmanship synonymous with Herm\u00e8s. Artisans stitch the bag from the outside in, finishing it with a resin edge coat that ensures sharp, clean lines and a polished finish. The Sellier's distinct structure and rigidity are attributed to the use of hard leathers, such as the durable Epsom leather or the classic Box leather. These materials not only contribute to the bag's longevity but also help maintain its iconic trapezoidal shape. The Kelly Retourne is the more relaxed version of the Kelly bag. The term \"Retourne,\" meaning \"to turn over\" in French, aptly describes the bag's construction process. In contrast to the Sellier, the Retourne is crafted with the stitching on the inside before being turned outward, meaning the stitching is not visible. As opposed to the resin edges on the Sellier, the Kelly Retourne has leather piping along the sides, and the edges are rounded giving it a more relaxed shape. The leather used for the Retourne is softer and more supple, such as the Togo or the Clemence. Due to the softness in the leather Retourne Kelly bags tend to be or become slouchier and have a more casual look. The sizing of the Herm\u00e8s Kelly bag is determined by the length of its base, for example, the Kelly 32, which measures 32 centimeters across. The sizes range from 15 to 50. The Kelly 15 and 20 are categorized as mini bags, ideal for evening wear or light day use. On the other end of the spectrum, the Kelly 40 and 50 serve as large travel bags. For daily use, the Kelly 25 and 28 are the most sought-after sizes, striking a balance between functionality and elegance. Each Kelly bag is thoughtfully equipped with a matching crossbody strap, enhancing its utility and offering varied ways to wear it. Each style is available in an array of colors, leathers, and hardware\u2014classic Kelly\u2019s are made with either gold or palladium hardware. Of course, this is Herm\u00e8s and there is the option (if you\u2019re lucky) to special order. Which opens up a whole other world of hardware options, leathers, colors, and sizes. Now that we've explored the distinct styles, construction methods, and sizing options of the Herm\u00e8s Kelly bag, it's clear that this iconic piece is more than just an accessory. With such a wide array of choices, selecting the perfect Kelly bag can seem daunting. To aid in this decision, we turned to an expert in the field. Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images We asked Kelly McSweeney, Senior Merchandising Manager at The RealReal, to share her thoughts on the different sizes, extensive leather, and hardware combinations. McSweeney shares, \u201cI think the size 25 is the perfect size. It's still a smaller bag, but fits all of your daily necessities and can comfortably be worn crossbody, so one could argue that this is a \u2018practical\u2019 purchase. The mini size 20 is definitely the most sought after and the prices reflect that. For leathers, they really are all beautiful and of the highest quality, but Togo and Epsom leathers would be more durable and resistant to scratches, so would give me peace of mind for everyday wear. For hardware, I would say that gold is most often in the highest demand. And for leather color, I think brown (named Gold) is the chicest classic option, and you can of course never go wrong with black. Hermes makes such beautiful rich colors that the pinks and greens/blues are often quite sought after as well. Lastly, I would also recommend vintage! The vintage Kelly bags are unbelievably special and showcase how iconic and long-standing this style really is.\u201d Variations of the Kelly Bag Herm\u00e8s, a brand synonymous with unparalleled luxury and exclusivity, has crafted an array of iterations of the iconic Kelly bag. Below, we will explore the diverse range of Kelly styles that continue to captivate fashion lovers and collectors, including those still in production and highly sought-after limited-edition pieces that have become coveted treasures. To kick off this list we turned to our favorite \u201cchief bag officer\u201d and the brains behind @y2kbags on Instagram about their favorite version of the Kelly Bag. \u201cI love the Hermes Kelly Lakis Bag! Introduced in 2004, it comes in 4 different sizes which include 28, 32, 35, and 40. The Kelly Lakis came to fruition after a VIP customer, Lakis Gavalas, requested the iconic bag with external pockets featured in the front and back. Fast forward 2 years, and with Jean Paul Gaultier as creative Director, the bag was released to the public! I love this design because I think of it as utilitarian chic. I've been so obsessed with the concept of the cargo bag, and this style of the Kelly serves exactly that purpose! This style comes in an array of colors and materials, including leather and toile. This is definitely a Kelly to covet and fetches a fairly high resale value in the secondary market depending on condition.\u201d The Kelly Pochette Edward Berthelot/Getty Images The Herm\u00e8s Kelly Pochette, a hallmark of Jean Paul Gaultier\u2019s first collection for Herm\u00e8s in 2004, is considered the original Mini Kelly. This elegant clutch differentiates itself with a less structured silhouette compared to its Mini Kelly counterpart, offering a more relaxed take on the iconic design. Unlike the Mini Kelly, which serves dual purposes as both a clutch and a shoulder bag thanks to its removable strap, the Kelly Pochette is designed exclusively as a clutch. It's one of Herm\u00e8s' most sought-after pieces. The Kelly Cut Christian Vierig/Getty Images Introduced in 2008, the Kelly Cut presents a sleek silhouette with its 31cm length, setting it apart from the more compact 22cm Kelly Pochette. This elongated design is the defining characteristic of the Kelly Cut, adding a sense of drama and sophistication. Its distinctive shape makes it an ideal evening option. The Kelly Elan Peter White/Getty Images Introduced in the early 2000s as an elegant clutch, the Hermes Kelly Elan swiftly emerged as a sought-after item. Its initial production lasted just two years, making it a coveted and incredibly rare piece among fashion lovers. Despite this brief production period, the allure of the Kelly Elan endured, leading to its re-release in 2023, now designed with a detachable shoulder strap for added versatility. The Kelly Danse Claudio Lavenia/Getty Images The Kelly Danse was designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier in 2013, it was discontinued in 2013 and then reintroduced in 2019 as the Kelly Danse II. The Kelly Danse is a more laidback take on the classic bag due to its versatility and elongated top strap. This bag can be worn in many different ways such as crossbody, belt bag, shoulder bag, clutch, and even a backpack thanks to its adjustable straps. The So Kelly Stephane Cardinale/Corbis via Getty Images Another gem designed in 2008 by Jean-Paul Gaultier is The So Kelly. It\u2019s a blend between a hobo bag and a bucket bag. The Osier Wicker Picnic Kelly Edward Berthelot/Getty Images The Osier Wicker, or \"Picnic Kelly,\" debuted on the runway in 2011, drawing inspiration from the quintessential picnic basket with its Osier woven wicker body and Bar\u00e9nia leather trim. Wicker's challenging and delicate nature highlights the extraordinary skill of Herm\u00e8s artisans in creating this bag. Over the years, Herm\u00e8s has revisited the Picnic concept with limited editions, including a Mini Picnic Kelly 20 and reissues of the original Kelly 35 size, all in very limited quantities. This rarity has made the Picnic Kelly highly sought after among collectors. The Kelly Doll Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images The Kelly Doll was originally designed by Herm\u00e8s' then-creative head Jean-Louis Dumas in 2000. Characterized by its whimsical design that incorporates elements of the classic Kelly bag into a doll-like figure, the Kelly Doll quickly captured the hearts of Herm\u00e8s enthusiasts. However, in 2005, Herm\u00e8s discontinued the production of the Kelly Doll, only to reintroduce it in 2008 as a series of limited edition releases. These special editions were often linked to the celebration of new boutique openings, each marked with a foil stamp indicating the specific store the bag was designed for. Transitioning from its initial role in commemorating store openings and special events, from 2017 onwards, the Kelly Doll became an exclusive offering to Herm\u00e8s' top clients. The Kelly Doll Picto Edward Berthelot/Getty Images Herm\u00e8s created an updated version of the Kelly Doll in 2022: The Kelly Doll Picto. The Teddy Kelly Giovanni Giannoni/Getty Images The Teddy Kelly, was first introduced by Jean Paul Gaultier for the Fall/Winter 2005 collection, and it made a reappearance on the Fall/Winter 2011 runway. Crafted in luxurious Doblis suede, this bag was offered in larger sizes including the 32 and 35. Herm\u00e8s introduced a limited-edition Mini Teddy Kelly 20 bag in Grizzly Suede in 2023. This smaller version, with its rich texture and compact size, quickly became one of the most coveted and rarest Mini Kelly bags in the Herm\u00e8s collection. The Sterling Silver Mini Kelly Giovanni Giannoni/Getty Images Among the most exclusive and sought-after Herm\u00e8s pieces is the Sterling Silver Mini Kelly. This exquisite bag distinguishes itself with a striking chrome finish and a detachable Cha\u00eene d'Ancre strap. Unlike its traditional leather counterparts, the Sterling Silver Mini Kelly features a unique hinged opening at the top, setting it apart in both functionality and design. Its rarity is underscored by the limited number of pieces available worldwide, making each one a treasured collector's item. One of these bags was auctioned at Christie\u2019s online in December 2023 and sold for $214,000. The Kelly en D\u00e9sordre Victor VIRGILE/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images The Kelly en D\u00e9sordre made a memorable appearance on the runway at the Herm\u00e8s Women's Fall/Winter 2022 show, captivating onlookers with its innovative double-sided design. This distinctive feature allows for openings on both sides of the bag, each sealed with its own angled flap, sangle, and iconic turn lock. One flap opens to the main compartment while the other flap opens to a small pouch. Adding to its practicality, the bag is equipped with a non-detachable shoulder strap. The Takeaway For over eight decades, the Herm\u00e8s Kelly bag has epitomized classic elegance and luxury at its finest. Its journey from a practical accessory to the first \"it-bag\" is a testament to its timeless design and the profound impact of Grace Kelly's iconic moment. This evolution not only cemented the Kelly bag's place in fashion history but also paved the way for the emergence of must-have accessories in the luxury domain. In tribute to its lasting legacy, we've spotlighted a list of modern moments that reaffirm the Kelly bag's unwavering status. Read more: Fashion Accessories Bags"

      "text": "12 of Kylie Jenner\u2019s Most Iconic Hair Moments You\u2019ll Want to Recreate By Elise Tabin Elise Tabin Elise Minton Tabin is an award-winning beauty journalist, editor, and expert with more than 16 years of experience. InStyle's editorial guidelines Published on December 9, 2024 @ 06:30PM Close Credit: Getty Images Kylie Jenner is a true hair chameleon. Whether rocking a pink shaggy wig, waist-length extensions, or a sleek bob in an array of rainbow colors, the beauty entrepreneur can pull off an array of different styles and colors. \"From bold, dramatic transformations to sleek, minimalist looks, Kylie Jenner's hair is an integral part of her fashion evolution,\" says Jerome Lordet, owner and director of Jerome Lordet Salon. While Jenner may be embracing her natural hair more these days, we're taking a trip down memory lane and revisiting some of her best hair moments, past and present. Meet the expert Andrew Fitzsimons is a celebrity hairstylist who has worked with Jenner and is also the founder of Andrew Fitzsimons Hair and creator of BELLAMI x Andrew Fitzsimons ponytail. Jerome Lordet is the owner and director of Jerome Lordet Salon. 01 of 12 An Avant-Garde Updo Getty Images Never afraid to take risks with her hairstyles, Jenner paired a feather-covered dress with a unique take on her classic slicked-back ponytail. Instead of letting the hair flow freely from the pony, she wore a dramatic blunt-cut hairpiece that covered the back of her head, giving way to an asymmetrical bob-like look. A good smoothing product like Andrew Fitzsimons Fantasy Curl Serum helps to tame flyaways and frizz. 02 of 12 Old Hollywood Glam Getty Images Here, Jenner takes a page out of the old Hollywood glam playbook with sculpted waves cascading across one eye and a deep side part. Fitzsimons says she has the perfect features of high cheekbones, a sharp jawline, and bright eyes for an old Hollywood look. \"When creating these styles for her, the goal is to honor the classic elements while giving them a fresh, modern twist. Adding extra texture, a sleek hairline, or pairing the look with a bold lip is Kylie's signature style.\" 03 of 12 Soft and Sexy Waves @kyliejenner/Instagram This Kylie Jenner hairstyle is a nod to beach waves but done with more softness and sex appeal, which she wears frequently. \"A blown-out, sultry look for Kylie is about creating volume, movement, and just the right amount of polish to make it effortlessly cool,\" Fitzsimon says. \"For added dimension, I love using BELLAMI Silk Seam Clip-ins, which blend seamlessly into the hair.\" He adds that the foundation of her style is everything, which starts with a proper blow dry with a round brush followed by either a large barrel curling iron or rollers to create her soft, natural-looking waves. 04 of 12 Cropped Blonde @kyliejenner/Instagram For Kylie's return to her King Kylie persona (when she constantly changed her hair), she sported a platinum blonde curly bob that suited her skin tone and made her dark eyes pop. However, pulling off a platinum blonde crop isn't for everyone, and considering your skin tone is key. To prevent cool-toned blonde hair, like Kylie's, from falling flat and looking brassy, Lordet recommends maintaining the hair regularly to prevent the color from turning yellow and the hair from becoming damaged. 05 of 12 The Wet Hair Look Getty Images With her \"wet\" hair falling over one eye and a deep side part, Jenner's sultry hairstyle is a sleek trend that she pulls off well. Although the dripping wet look takes a lot of time to create and requires a hefty serving of either hair oil or gel, Fitzsimons says the key to Jenner's wet hair look is the perfect balance between polished and edgy. \"This style is perfect for her because it emphasizes her beautiful bone structure. The sleekness of her hair draws attention to her cheekbones and jawline in a way that makes her look perfectly sculpted.\" 06 of 12 Extra Long Length Jenner always dresses the part when she's in Paris. At the 2024 Acne Studios Spring runway show, she debuted a wispy French fringe and raven-toned hair. According to Lordet, her return to long, jet-black hair was an ultra-glamorous moment that created a high-contrast look, evoking both mystery and elegance. \"This is one of her most glamorous looks because it offers sophistication and maturity.\" Extra-long shaggy extensions give the perfect amount of drama and glam. 07 of 12 Barbie Pink @kyliejenner/Instagram Of all the hair colors that Kylie sports, pink is her go-to. Her bright, bubblegum-pink strands are likely courtesy of a wig (she's also known to slip on rose gold and other cotton candy-hued wigs). Lordet says her pink hair features hints of warm tones for a bold choice that suits her evolving style perfectly. \"This color is flattering against her skin, creating a balanced, vibrant look.\" 08 of 12 Baby Blue Bob Getty Images Both dusty and more vibrant shades of blues and teals are one color family that Kylie returns to over and over. As a teenager, she wore blue hair frequently and kept the root heavy for a more lived-in, low-maintenance look. If you're considering a color like this one, Lordet says there are a few things to keep in mind to make it work. \"With any vibrant color, the key to maintaining it is healthy hair. Start with strong, well-moisturized hair and use deep conditioning masks or oil treatments regularly to keep the strands smooth and shiny.\" 09 of 12 Platinum Blonde Getty Images In the past, Jenner has achieved her icy blonde platinum color with seamless-looking wigs, although she also bleached her hair to a lighter shade of pale. Since bleached blonde hair can lose its luster and shine, wigs are a far safer choice, but choosing one with the right tone of blonde is key. \"Her platinum blonde hair contrasts beautifully with her skin tone, and the blunt bob shape accentuates her strong jawline and cheekbones,\" Lordet says. \"This hairstyle gives an almost futuristic, high-fashion edge that felt very much in line with the bold, boundary-pushing persona she was cultivating at the time.\" 10 of 12 Brow-Skimming Bangs Getty Images In true Jenner fashion, she always keeps her looks fresh and unexpected. At the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, she sported a classic blowout with some bend on the ends and loads of shine throughout. A heavy jet-black fringe hits right at her eyebrows, creating the perfect eye frame. For added dimension, Fitzsimons recommends clip-ins like the BELLAMI Silk Seam Clip-ins, which he says can be used to achieve all types of long and short styles. 11 of 12 Mermaid Vibes @kyliejenner/Instagram When Jenner wears her hair super long, courtesy of extensions, she often relies on a loose, wavy, mermaid-inspired style. With her waist-skimming strands that have a polished yet bohemian feel to them, her down-to-there style evokes a moment of true sophistication. \"Kylie's return to long, jet-black hair with a deep part offers a sense of maturity while still being fresh,\" Lordet adds. 12 of 12 Bun Babe Getty Images Kylie loves to wear her hair in a m\u00e9lange of different bun styles, from an overly sized one, as shown here and adorned with a diamond-encrusted headpiece fit for royalty, to smaller top knots and messy chignons. Pulling her hair up and off her face allows her facial features and perfectly defined cheekbones and jawline to take center stage. Read more: Beauty Hair"
