  "content": "The Justice Department is bristling at the idea of providing toothbrushes to jailed migrants at a Manhattan ICE facility \u2014 claiming the detainees could use the teeth-cleaning tools as dangerous \u201cweapons.\u201d\n\nManhattan US Attorney Jay Clayton\u2019s claim came after a judge ordered Wednesday that conditions in a makeshift jail at 26 Federal Plaza be improved, acting on complaints that asylum seekers have been kept in dirty, overcrowded cells.\n\n\u201cToothbrushes can readily be improvised as weapons,\u201d Clayton\u2019s office wrote, adding that ICE agents would prefer to continue providing migrants with \u201cteeth-cleaning wipes\u201d instead.\n\nThe feds did not provide an example of a migrant using a toothbrush as a weapon.\n\nJail inmates have fashioned the products into sharp tools in the past by shaving down the handle, but it\u2019s unclear how serious of a threat toothbrushes are, given that they can be purchased at Brooklyn\u2019s infamous Metropolitan Detention Center jail for 85 cents.\n\nJudge Lewis Kaplan ruled Thursday to ban toothbrushes from the site for now, pending further argument.\n\nThe migrants\u2019 lawyers shot back in court papers that \u201cthere is no basis to deny individuals detained at 26 Federal Plaza basic hygiene products\u201d that detainees can access at other ICE sites in the US.\n\nThe toothbrush debate comes as ICE agents have been photographed arresting migrants almost daily outside their mandated immigration court hearings in the same federal building.\n\nThe aggressive tactics drew criticism Thursday from a separate federal judge, who accused the government of playing an unconstitutional \u201cgame of detention roulette\u201d with human beings.\n\n\u201cTreating attendance in immigration court as a game of detention roulette is not consistent with the constitutional guarantee of due process,\u201d Judge Dale Ho wrote.\n\nThe jurist issued the ruling to describe why he ordered that Carlos Javier Lopez Benitez, a Paraguay native who works in construction and has no criminal record, be released from ICE custody after his arrest outside immigration court in July.",

  "summary": "The US Justice Department is concerned that toothbrushes may be used as weapons by detainees at a New York ICE facility. This comes after a judge ordered improvements to conditions at the facility following complaints that asylum seekers have been kept in dirty, overcrowded cells. Manhattan US Attorney Jay Clayton stated that ICE agents would prefer providing migrants with \"teeth-cleaning wipes\" instead. The government did not provide an example of a migrant using a toothbrush as a weapon. The toothbrush debate comes as ICE agents have been photographed frequently arresting migrants outside their immigration court hearings.",
  "shortSummary": "The Justice Department is opposing providing toothbrushes to jailed migrants at 26 Federal Plaza, arguing they could be dangerous weapons and should be replaced with \u201cteeth-cleaning wipes\u201d instead.",

      "text": "Accused Venezuelan thief begs NYC judge to lock him up to avoid being nabbed by ICE as it rounded up illegal immigrants making court appearances\nAn accused Venezuelan bike thief asked a New York City judge to lock him up in Rikers Island to evade arrest by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents \u2014 whose efforts to detain him were blocked when the desperate plea was stunningly granted by a judge.\nNolveiro Vera Ordonez, 30, was arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court on charges for fourth-degree criminal mischief, petit larceny and fifth-degree criminal possession of stolen property while five masked ICE agents waited outside the heavily secured courtroom to take him into custody Wednesday afternoon.\nHis lawyer, Elizabeth Fischer of the Neighborhood Defender Service of Harlem, said her client was \u201cvoluntarily\u201d requesting to be jailed on $100, on charges that typically do not require bail to be set.\nThe attorney citied an obscure bail law where a defendant can request bail at any time and that if the judge is \u201csatisfied\u201d that the bail is voluntary, \u201cthe court shall set such bail in such amount.\u201d\nJudge Rachel Pauley, who noted the request was \u201chighly unusual,\u201d agreed to set Ordonez\u2019s bail at $100 \u2013 effectively blocking the federal arrest and prompting ICE agents to scatter out of the courthouse.\n\u201cMr. Rivera Ordonez, at your request \u2026 I\u2019m setting bail on what is otherwise a bail-ineligible offense,\u201d she told him.\nThe judge, however, remanded Ordonez on the federal warrant.\nJust a few blocks away, masked federal agents were seen detaining at least four other illegal immigrants who were summoned for appointments near Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan, photos showed.\nThe individuals had apparently reported to the nondescript building for scheduled appearances with Homeland Security\u2019s Intensive Supervision Appearance Program when they were arrested.\nThe program targets immigrants at various stages of deportation proceedings and typically requires check-ins every few weeks or months \u2013 with several weeks\u2019 notice given in advance.\nOne photo captured a distraught woman collapsed on the ground, crying, as the raid unfolded around her. Another photo showed a father kissing his daughter on the forehead as he is hauled away by agents.\nAdditional footage showed a distressed woman looking back at her daughter as she was being placed into a vehicle by agents.\nThe large-scale roundups outside federal courts and offices have become a regular occurrence nationwide as the Trump administration hones in on migrants with final removal orders, sources told The Post.\nLast week, as many as 10 migrants were detained while leaving the federal immigration courthouse at 26 Federal Plaza.\nAnother 16 immigrants were detained from a nondescript office building in the same area Tuesday afternoon, The City reported.\nThe outlet reported that masked agents placed the handcuffed individuals into SUVS parked in a garage across the street from the federal courthouse approximately 15 minutes past each hour throughout the day.\nThe sweeping arrests come after President Trump instructed ICE agents to wait outside federal immigration courts across the country to handcuff illegal migrants as soon as they receive a deportation order from a judge, sources told The Post.\nICE shares an office with the immigration court in downtown New York City, allowing federal agents to make such arrests easily."

      "text": "Virginia inmates use toothbrush to dig tunnel out of jail, head to IHOP\nTwo Virginia inmates busted out of jail and headed to a local IHOP after using a toothbrush to dig a tunnel through their cell wall Monday.\nThe prisoners, 37-year-old John Garza and 43-year-old Arley Nemo, were captured at the pancake joint\u2019s location about seven miles away from the Newport News jail they escaped from hours earlier, the Newport News Sheriff\u2019s Office said.\nGarza and Nemo used \u201cprimitive-made tools constructed from a toothbrush and metal object\u201d to break open their cell wall and access unsecured rebars between the walls. They then used a rebar to break a small hole in the wall and climbed through, the sheriff said.\nOnce out of their jail cell, the men scaled the containment wall and made a run for it. They ended up at the International House of Pancakes in Hampton, where police arrested them in the early morning hours Tuesday.\nBystanders at the IHOP had noticed the two inmates and had called police, the sheriff\u2019s office said.\n\u201cI extend my gratitude to the Newport News Police Department, the Hampton Police Department, and the James City County Police Department for their assistance in our attempt to recapture these inmates,\u201d Sheriff Gabe Morgan said. \u201cMoreover, I\u2019m thankful for the citizens who observed Garza and Nemo at the IHOP and notified law enforcement. It reinforces what we always say \u2018see something, say something.\u2019\u201d\nGarza, of Hampton, was being held on charges including contempt of court, probation violations and failure to appear. Nemo, of Gloucester, was in custody for charges including credit card fraud, credit card larceny, forgery, possession of burglary tools, grand larceny, contempt of court and probation violation.\nThe sheriff said the inmates exploited \u201ca construction design weakness\u201d to make their escape. A Newport News facility management and engineering team are reviewing the facility\u2019s security and will ensure the building is shored up, according to the office.\nThe sheriff\u2019s office is also conducting an internal investigation to prevent future escapes, as well as a criminal investigation.\nBoth escapees are expected to be hit with additional charges for their IHOP trip."

I\u2019m not getting out of this car. It\u2019s time to go to bed,\u201d he shouts at the officer, before being forcibly removed and booked into the jail shortly before 1 a.m., according to an arrest report retrieved by WCBD.\nMcLeod\u2019s eyes were \u201cextremely bloodshot and highly dilated \u2026 typical of an individual under the influence of a stimulant narcotic,\u201d according to the report.\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether McLeod \u2014 who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2010 and served two terms as Charleston County Democratic Party chairman \u2014 was tested for drugs during his arrest.\nHe is facing misdemeanor charges for disorderly conduct.\nHis party leadership is calling on him to step down from the gubernatorial race, in which he is currently the party\u2019s only candidate.\n\u201cAfter reviewing the transcript of the dash cam footage from his recent arrest, it is clear that Mr. McLeod is navigating profound challenges and should focus on his mental and emotional well-being instead of a campaign for governor,\u201d the chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party, Christale Spain, said in a statement Wednesday.\nEvery morning, the NY POSTcast offers a deep dive into the headlines with the Post\u2019s signature mix of politics, business, pop culture, true crime and everything in between.

Not only is he FIRED, he has been charged with a felony.\u201d\n\u201cThis is an example of the Deep State we have been up against for seven months as we work to refocus DOJ,\u201d she added. \u201cYou will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement.\u201d\nDunn worked as an international affairs specialist in the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division \u2014 which handles cases of fugitives abroad and helps foreign countries on extradition matters with their own fugitives, according to the DOJ.\nDunn appeared to have been similar to a paralegal \u2014 assisting attorneys in handling a \u201clarge volume of cases, including the litigation of those matters,\u201d according to the DOJ\u2019s job listing for the position.\nHe does not appear to be an attorney as his name isn\u2019t listed on the DC bar\u2019s website.\nAn attorney for the suspect did not immediately respond to requests for comment and attempts to contact Dunn directly were unsuccessful.\nDunn was allegedly caught on camera berating a group of federal officers as \u201cfascists\u201d before lobbing his deli sandwich and hitting a US Customs and Border Protection agent in the chest.\n\u201cF\u2014 you! You f\u2014ing fascists! Why are you here? I don\u2019t want you in my city!\u201d Dunn allegedly fumed within inches of an officer\u2019s face, per a criminal complaint.\nAccording to the complaint, Dunn successfully attempted to flee on foot, telling a local cop while he was being processed: \u201cI did it. I threw a sandwich.\u201d\nFootage of the incident went viral against the backdrop of President Trump\u2019s deployment of hundreds of federal law enforcement personnel to assist DC police in cracking down on crime.\nDunn faces one count of assaulting, resisting or impeding a federal officer and faces up to one year in prison if convicted.\n\u201cThe police are not out there to get pushed around or beat up,\u201d DC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro declared in announcing the case against Dunn. \u201cHe thought it was funny. Well, he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s funny today because we charged him with a felony: Assault on a police officer.\u201d\n\u201cSo there, stick your Subway sandwich somewhere else!\u201d\nOn Monday, Trump federalized the DC Metropolitan Police Department for 30 days and activated the National Guard to patrol the District\u2019s streets.\nSince then, hundreds of federal officials have arrested more than 100 suspects, with 23 collared on Monday, 43 nabbed on Tuesday and 45 apprehended on Wednesday, according to data from the Trump administration.\nTrump\u2019s crackdown comes after former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee Edward Coristine \u2014 aka \u201cBig Balls\u201d \u2014 was beaten up while intervening to prevent a carjacking last week."

      "text": "Mayor Eric Adams says he\u2019ll \u2018look into\u2019 NYC ICE facility after advocates complain of \u2018inhumane treatment\u2019\nMayor Eric Adams said Wednesday he would \u201clook into\u201d conditions at 26 Federal Plaza after advocacy groups and local pols complained of \u201cinhumane treatment\u201d at the ICE facility.\nVideos released by the New York Immigration Coalition Tuesday showed a crowded holding cell at the federal immigration offices in Lower Manhattan, with over a dozen asylum seekers using thermal blankets as makeshift beds.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to look into it. It was brought to our attention yesterday and I spoke with the chief of staff and the team to find out exactly what\u2019s going on there based on the videos that were presented,\u201d the mayor said at an unrelated news conference.\nIn a letter sent later Wednesday to the General Services Administration, Adams requested the agency, which is responsible for managing federally owned buildings, conduct an inspection to ensure proper procedures were being followed.\n\u201cThe lack of clarity and transparency surrounding the facility\u2019s current use raises serious concerns,\u201d reads the letter, shared with The Post.\n\u201cWe urge your office to conduct a thorough inspection and share your findings with the public immediately so that all parties may have a clear understanding of how this space is being used \u2014 and whether it aligns with its intended purpose under federal law.\u201d\nThe GSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe NYIC alleges that people being held are going \u201cdays and week at a time\u201d without showers, medication and only receiving minimal food.\n\u201cThe conditions on the 10th floor of 26 Federal Plaza are a blatant violation of human rights and due process, and I was deeply alarmed by recently uncovered video footage showing immigrants detained by ICE forced to sleep on filthy floors, share a single bathroom among nearly 30 people, and endure inhumane treatment,\u201d said Rep. Adriano Espaillat in a statement accompanying the NYIC press release.\nThe mayor, when initially asked about the footage on Tuesday, said his hands were tied because the city might not have oversight of the facility. He responded to questions from a reporter by asking, \u201cDo you realize that\u2019s a federal building?\u201d\nLefty pols like Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and Comptroller Brad Lander are calling on the city\u2019s Buildings and Fire departments to inspect conditions in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement building, according to The City.\nWhile the DOB told the outlet that its inspectors don\u2019t have authority to inspect federal buildings, the department did check on an elevator-related complaint there last year.\nDOB spokesperson Andrew Rudansky said he was unsure why that inspection, which did not result in a violation being issued, was conducted last year.\nWilliams and Lander maintain that the city still does have authority to inspect the federal building, firing off a letter to the commissioners of the DOB and FDNY.\n\u201cGiven the clear risk that conditions on the 10th floor may pose a danger to human life and be in violation of City zoning, buildings, and fire codes, DOB and FDNY must urgently apply their authority here to ensure compliance with the law and protect the public,\u201d their letter reads.\nAdvocates claim the building is being used more like a detention facility than a \u201cprocessing center,\u201d which is what the feds describe it as.\nIf the facility was classified as a detention center, members of congress would have legal authority to inspect it under a 2019 law. Lawmakers, including New York Reps. Dan Goldman and Jerry Nadler, have tried to get access to the facility and been turned away several times in recent weeks.\n\u201c26 Federal Plaza is not a detention center. It is a processing center where illegal aliens are briefly processed to be transferred to an ICE detention facility,\u201d Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.\n\u201cAny claim that there is overcrowding or subprime conditions at ICE facilities are categorically false. All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with their family members and lawyers.\u201d"
