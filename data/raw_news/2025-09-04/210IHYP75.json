(TSXV: AMX) (FSE: MX0) (OTCQX: AMXEF) ( \"Amex\" or the \"Company\" ) is pleased to announce the results of an updated Preliminary Economic Assessment (the \"PEA\") for its wholly-owned Perron gold project (the \"Project\"), located near the towns of Norm\u00e9tal and Valcanton in the province of Quebec, Canada. The PEA was prepared in collaboration with independent engineering and geological firms Evomine, Bumigeme, P&E Mining Consultants, Norda Stelo, and Laurentia Exploration.\n\nVictor Cantore, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMEX Exploration commented, \"This PEA is based on our latest Mineral Resource Estimate and reflects our new vision for developing the Perron Project. Our staged approach to production and construction is both fiscally and technically prudent, minimizing permitting and technical risk, reducing upfront capital and enabling early cash flow.\"\n\nCantore continued, \"The economics of this project are incredibly strong and with gold prices at record highs, quick time to production allows us to capitalize on current market conditions. Our cost structure is one of the lowest globally and reflects the benefits of having a project with high grade, easily mined gold ounces that is surrounded by infrastructure and mining expertise.\"\n\nNotes:\n\n1 Growth CAPEX is attributed to Phase 2, even if incurred prior to Year 5 \n\n2 Initial capital expenditure estimate of $146.1M is partially offset from pre-production revenues of $68.6M for a net initial CAPEX of $77.5M.\n\nNotes:\n\n3 Initial capital expenditure estimate of $146.1M is partially offset from pre-production revenues of $68.6M for a net initial CAPEX of $77.5M.\n\n- The PEA is preliminary in nature and is based, in part, on Inferred Mineral Resources. Inferred Mineral Resources are considered too geologically speculative to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves. There is no certainty that the economic forecasts on which the PEA is based will be realized.\n\n- The economic analysis of the project was carried out using a discounted cash flow approach on a pre-tax and after-tax basis with a discount rate of 5%.\n\n- Revenue was based on a long-term gold price of $2,500/oz in USD.\n\u2022 Underpinned by world class infrastructure, the Perron PEA demonstrates a top-tier high margin gold mining operation in the stable jurisdiction of Quebec, Canada. The Project is located within the Abitibi region, one of the most prolific gold belts in the world.\n\u2022 The PEA results confirm that Perron has the potential to be a stand-alone and highly profitable operation with an excellent internal rate of return (IRR) and after-tax net present value (NPV) at a range of gold prices.\n\u2022 The PEA shows that Perron has the potential to be a mine with limited environmental impact, utilizing the mined out open pits to store tailings and therefore avoiding the construction of a tailings management facility.\n\nThe mine will be operated as a mechanized underground operation, which will be complemented by open pit production. The mine will have an overall average production rate of 1,000 tpd of mineralized material during Phase 1 and a capacity of 2,000 tpd of mineralized material during Phase 2. Production is preceded by a 21-month pre-production period.\n\nThe selected underground mining method is longitudinal longhole stoping with cemented rockfill. Stope dimensions average 17.5 m in length, 25 m in height, and 4.7 m in width (LOM average) with a minimum mining width of 3.0 m. The different sectors of mine will be accessed via ramps and drifts to allow the efficient circulation of mobile mining equipment and to satisfy ventilation and emergency egress requirements. Pre-production and Phase 1 mining activities will mostly be done by a contractor, while Phase 2 considers a fleet of owner-operated equipment that includes 10 tonne LHDs and 42 tonne haul trucks.\n\nSeven open pits are included in the mine plan and utilize conventional truck and shovel mining that will be executed by a contractor. The pits will begin to be mined at the beginning of Phase 1, with material completely extracted by year 13 as the pits are sequenced such that they can be used to manage all tailings generated by the on-site mill during Phase 2 of the Project.\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/2667/265097_2e5fd6dcc4235a69_002full.jpg\n\nPhase 1 representing a 4-year 1,000 tpd contract mined, toll-milling operation in the Abitibi region, where numerous processing plants are in operation. Mineralized material will be loaded at the project site and transported by truck to the processing destination.\n\nTo date, AMEX has not entered into a toll milling arrangement with any third-party owner of a processing facility to treat its material. However, discussions were initiated and there are several parties that own processing facilities within the Abitibi region, with some permitted for toll milling and others that could be permitted upon arrangement, that could potentially treat the Perron mineralized material. Bumigeme inc., a mineral processing consultant based in Montr\u00e9al (Canada), reviewed the flowsheets of these mills which are similar to the flowsheet developed in the PEA study for treating the Perron mineralized material. Bumigeme is confident that the recoveries anticipated from the toll treatment of ore from the Perron deposit will reach 94-95%, matching the expectations for the on-site processing plant (Phase 2). The Toll milling assumptions used in the PEA consists of an cost of CA$102.00 per tonne, covering for on-site crushing, transport and toll milling cost. A sensitivity analysis has been done on this cost and is presented in the Financial Analysis section.\n\nPhase 2 consists of the construction and commissioning of a 2,000 tpd processing plant on-site at the Perron project. The plant will be in operation from year 5 to the end of the LOM. The flowsheet consists of primary crushing, followed by a grinding circuit consisting of a semi-autogenous grinding mill of 5.5 m diameter x 1.8 m long in an opened circuit and a ball mill of 4.0 m diameter x 6.7 m long in a closed circuit with cyclones - SABC circuit. A gravity circuit followed by leaching will recover coarse gold from the cyclone underflow, while the cyclone overflow, at a P80=74 microns, is treated in a six (6) tank carbon-in-leach circuit, followed by SO2/air cyanide destruction. Gold will be recovered in an adsorption-desorption-recovery circuit and electrowinning cells, with gold room recovery and production of bullion bars. The CIL tailings after the cyanide destruction will be pumped to a high-rate thickener to increase the slurry density to 62-64 % solid and pumped to empty pits.\n\nTests conducted in 2020 and 2024 on Perron ore achieved gold recoveries exceeding 95% using a gravity/cyanidation process. Based on these results and the treatment processes studied for four potential toll milling plants, an average recovery rate of 95% was considered for both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the LOM. The process plant building will include a laboratory, mill offices, a dry and an electrical and mechanical shop.\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/2667/265097_2e5fd6dcc4235a69_003full.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/2667/265097_figure3.jpg\n\nThe Project is approximately 6.5 kilometers from the town of Norm\u00e9tal, Quebec and is accessible via a well-maintained forestry road. The Project will require construction of the supporting infrastructure items, such as:\n\n\n\n- Gatehouse and service and haulage roads;\n\n- Temporary buildings to be used by the mining contractor (maintenance shop, warehouses, offices, dry, etc.);\n\n- 6.5 kilometers of 25kV transmission line and an on-site substation;\n\n- Surface water management facilities including final effluent water treatment plant, ditches, pond and pumping stations;\n\n- Underground mine portal, mine ventilation systems (intake and exhaust) and waste dump and overburden storage facilities;\n\n- Mineralized material loading facilities;\n\n\n\n- 2,000 tpd process plant complex;\n\n- Required infrastructures to pump the plant tailings to emptied open-pits; \n\n- Maintenance shop; \n\n- Administration building;\n\n- Warehouse\n\n- Additional surface water management facilities;\n\n- Additional service and haulage roads;\n\nThese infrastructures and facilities will require different authorizations and permits prior to being built and operated. No camp will be required considering the nearby qualified labor pool.\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/2667/265097_2e5fd6dcc4235a69_005full.jpg\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/2667/265097_2e5fd6dcc4235a69_006full.jpg\n\nDuring steady state operations, the number of employees (mine, process plant and G&A) is expected to peak at 272 people during Phase 1 of mine operation and at 335 people during Phase 2, including contractors (open pit mining, underground mining, contract services, etc.).\n\nDuring Phase 1, the tailings will be managed off-site at the toll mill facility. During Phase 2, the tailings storage plan will take advantage of open pits that will be mined in the first 13 years of mine operations. Process plant rejects will be thickened and pumped to the mined-out pits sequentially for permanent storage. Tailings will then consolidate over time and excess water will either be used for processing requirements or discharged to the environment once quality conditions are met. This concept aims to limit the environmental impact of the Perron Project, to limit the risks related to traditional Tailings Management Facility (TMF) stability, to simplify short-term and long-term monitoring and to greatly reduce the capital and operating costs related to tailings management.\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/2667/265097_2e5fd6dcc4235a69_007full.jpg\n\nThe total initial construction capital expenditure (\"Initial CAPEX\"), which is to bring Phase 1 of the Project into operation, is estimated at $146.1M, which will be partially offset from $68.6M in pre-production gold sales credits for an initial net CAPEX of $77.5M. It accounts for site development, the construction of a 25kV powerline connecting to the existing electrical substation in Norm\u00e9tal and the initial development of the underground mine. The Initial CAPEX estimate includes $7.4M of EPCM and indirect costs and a contingency of $9.2M.\n\nThe total growth capital expenditure (\"Growth CAPEX\"), to bring Phase 2 of the Project into operation, is estimated at $191.6M. It includes the costs of building a 2,000 tpd mill on site and acquiring an underground mobile equipment fleet. It also accounts for further site development, including a truck shop, warehouse and an administration facility. Additionally, the Growth CAPEX estimate includes $30.5M of EPCM and indirect costs and a contingency of $22.3M.\n\nThe Sustaining CAPEX (\"SUSEX\") is estimated to be $386.3M, including $11.4M of closure and rehabilitation costs. Underground mining SUSEX is earmarked for mining development, additional equipment, replacement units, and major repairs. Other SUSEX captures in-pit tailings storage, infrastructure and G&A.\n\nQuotations from reputable suppliers were obtained for most of the large and high-cost equipment required for the plant, mine and site infrastructure. For other equipment and supplies, cost estimates were based on comparable projects, historical data or derived through consultants' in-house databases.\n\nNotes \n\n1 Consists of mineralized material mined and sold during the pre-production period, ie., before the mined is developed at a point where a constant mining rate of 600 tonnes per day is sustainable (60% of the planned rate of 1,000 tonnes per day).\n\n2 Phase 2 CAPEX represents the investment needed to build a processing plant on site and to increase the mining rate at 2,000 tonnes per day.\n\u2022 As per the CIM Estimation of Mineral Resources & Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines, working capital is reported separately to CAPEX in the economic model.\n\nLOM total operating cost is estimated at US$891 per ounce of gold produced, as summarized below. The LOM total AISC is estimated to be US$1,061 per ounce of gold produced based on a total gold production of 1,660,000 ounces over the 17.5 years of mine life. This cost structure places the Project in the bottom quartile of the global gold cost curve, which is mostly due to the high-grade nature of the mineralized material and to the simplicity of mining.\n\nAt base case gold price of US$2,500/oz and exchange rate of 1.38, the Project generates a post-tax Net Present Value (\"NPV\") of $1,085M using 5% discount rate and a post-tax Internal Rate of Return (\"IRR\") of 70.1% with a payback period of 1.4 years from the commencement of commercial production. The Project generates cumulative post-tax free cash flow of $1,768M over the 17.5-year production period. Total taxes payable over LOM at the base case gold price is $1,243M.\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/2667/265097_figure7.jpg\n\nThe PEA financial economic analysis is significantly influenced by gold prices. At spot prices of US$3,400/Au oz and exchange rate of 1.38, the Project generates an after-tax NPV of $1,841M and an after-tax IRR of 107.6% with a payback period of 0.4 years. A sensitivity analysis was performed on the gold price, operating costs, total CAPEX and Phase 1 off-site transport and processing.\n\nAccording to the Regulation respecting the environmental impact assessment and review of certain projects (chapter Q-2, r. 23.1, last updated on April 1 2025), work required for the operation of a new mine is included in the list of projects subject to the environmental impact assessment and review procedure (Schedule 1). In the regulation, a \"mine\" is defined as all the surface and underground infrastructures forming part of a mineral substance operation, except surface mineral substances within the meaning of the Mining Act (chapter M-13.1). The scope of the environmental impact assessment will be defined by the directive (guideline) issued by the Minist\u00e8re de l'Environnement, de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques, de la Faune et des Parcs (MELCCFP) subsequent to the filing of the Project Notice by Amex, in accordance with section 31.2 of the Environment Quality Act (EQA).\n\nAn environmental and social scoping study is currently underway to identify the key environmental and social risks and issues associated with the project construction and operation and to more accurately define the scope of the environmental baseline studies required. The acquisition of baseline environmental knowledge on the Perron property began several years ago and is still ongoing today. The environmental baseline studies and early public consultations, help characterize the receiving environment and identify areas that are more ecologically or socially rich or sensitive. This information will be used as part of the environmental assessment process and the feasibility studies to further develop and optimize the project with the objective of ensuring the project environmental and social acceptability.\n\nOnce the environmental assessment and review procedure is completed and the project is approved, the various project components will require specific provincial and federal permits and authorizations. At the provincial level, this will include ministerial authorizations that must be electronically filed with the appropriate forms to comply with the EQA and the Regulation respecting the regulatory scheme applying to activities on the basis of their environmental impact (REAFIE) (Q-2, r. 17.1), the Mining Act (chapter M-13.1), as well as other provincial acts and regulations. At the federal level, some project components and impacts may require specific authorizations according to federal legal and regulatory framework, including authorizations under the Fisheries Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. F-14, the Metal and Diamond Mining Effluent Regulations (SOR/2002-222) and other federal acts and regulations.\n\nThe aboriginal community affected by Amex's activities is the Abitibiwinni First Nation which is an Algonquin First Nation residing primarily in the community of Pikogan in the Abitibi-Temiscamingue region. The Pikogan community, also called Abitibiwinni, is located three (3) kilometers from the town of Amos on the west bank of the Harricana River. The Perron project is located on a part of the ancestral territory of the Algonquin Anishinabeg Nation. A relationship of trust and respect has been built with the Abitibiwinni First Nation Council over the years through consistent transparency and consultation. With respect to local communities near the project, Norm\u00e9tal, Valcanton and Saint-Lambert are the main municipalities surrounding the Perron project.\n\nAmex has always prioritized engaging stakeholders and implementing communication and consultation plans. Communication plans include a summary of the work completed on the property every six months as well as the company's exploration and development plans for the coming months. Active community participation in the development and implementation of the project is one of Amex's core values and aids in fostering good long-term relationships. Amex will continue consulting, supporting and informing all stakeholders at all stages of the project development. With this in mind, Ames aims to establish various working and consultation committees by the end of 2025.\n\nWith the recent acquisition of the Perron West property (see press release dated March 25, 2025) quadrupling Amex's land holdings along the Norm\u00e9tal-Burntbush greenstone belt, the Company's exploration plans are significantly expanding to cover the vast, new area of prospective geology. Amex's constant evolution of knowledge of the mineralization styles and structures with the Beaupr\u00e9 Block on Perron will provide invaluable insight into guiding exploration on the Company's expanded land package.\n\nCurrently, Amex has multiple teams conducting surface exploration work on the 15,192-hectare Perron West project. Teams of technicians are completing large and widespread soil sampling programs to find and/or further define gold-in-soil anomalies, while teams of geologists are completing surface prospecting work, including mapping, grab sampling, structural measurements of outcrops, etc. The work is expected to be completed in the coming weeks, with the results to help further define the existing anomalies on the property and further solidify drill planning for a maiden program on Perron West in 2026.\n\nIn addition, structural geology specialists from consultant Norda Stelo are continuing work on a thoroughly detailed 3D lithostructural model on the Perron property. This project is nearing completion and will help guide drill planning for the remainder of the year and into 2026 at Perron. The outcomes from this model will also improve Amex's understand and build upon a larger scaled regional structural framework, that will aid drill planning efforts on the Perron West property.\n\nThe Company will update the market with more in-depth details on drill planning for Perron in the near future.\n\nThe updated PEA was based on the NI 43-101 compliant Perron Project MRE, with an effective date of May 21, 2025 (please see the linked press release). The mineral resources that have flowed to the mine plan at Perron come from multiple zones, with major contributions from the Champagne, Denise, Team, Grey Cat and Gratien zones.\n\nTable 1: Summary of total Mineral Resources at the Perron Project\n\u2022 The Mineral Resource Estimate is compliant with CIM 2019 Best Practices Guidelines for reporting Mineral Resources and Reserves.\n\u2022 Mineral Resources are presented undiluted and in situ and are considered to have reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The Mineral Resources near surface are constrained by pit optimization surfaces and the underground Mineral Resources are constrained by potentially mineable stope shapes.\n\u2022 The database is comprised of a total of 1,807 drill holes for 608492.30 metres of drilling (which includes historical drilling completed by previous operators, abandoned and exploration holes) in the extent of the Mineral Resource, of which (359 087.40 metres) 305,523 samples were assayed as of March 31, 2025, grid spacing is variable.\n\u2022 All NQ core assays reported by Amex were obtained by analytical methods described below under \"QA/QC\".\n\u2022 Geological interpretation of the zones was based on lithologies, mineralized zones orientation and cut-off grade considerations. Each zone has its own characteristic of mineral occurrence and amount of recoverable gold.\n\u2022 Geological wireframe interpretation was initially made from cross-sections at intervals in GEMSTM, and then completed in LeapfrogTM where selections of mineralized intervals were combined to generate mineralized wireframes. Wireframes are generally subvertical with various plunges.\n\u2022 The Mineral Resource Estimate encompasses a total of 115 wireframes, sub-vertical gold-bearing domains, each defined by individual wireframes with a minimum downhole width of 2.0 m.\n\u2022 Assay Samples were composited within the mineralization envelopes into 1.0 m length composites. A value of 0.001 g/t Au was applied in cases of drill core not assayed.\n\u2022 High-grade capping was done on composite data and established using a statistical analysis on a per-zone basis for gold. Capping varied from 5 g/t Au to 500 g/t Au and was applied on composites within each specific wireframe.\n\u2022 Bulk density values were applied on the different mineralized zones varied from 2.7 to 2.8 t/m3 based on site drill core measurements.\n\u2022 Grade estimates are based on a parent block dimension of 5m x 5m x 5m with sub-cells down to 1m x 1m x 1m. Search parameters were determined by variography.\n\u2022 The Perron Mineral Resource Estimate is classified as Measured, Indicated and Inferred as follows:\n\u2022 The Measured Mineral Resource classification is defined by areas where drill hole sample spacing is less than 10 m, blocks are informed by a minimum of three drill holes, and reasonable geological and grade continuity is shown.\n\u2022 The Indicated Mineral Resource classification is defined by areas where drill spacing is less than 30 m (except Champagne Zone at 40 m), blocks are informed by a minimum of two drill holes, and reasonable geological and grade continuity is shown.\n\u2022 The Inferred Mineral Resource classification is defined by the limits of the constraining wireframes, blocks are informed by a minimum of one drill hole, and reasonable, however, not verified, geological and grade continuity is observed.\n\u2022 Grade estimates use metric units (metres, tonnes and g/t). Metal contents are presented in troy ounces (metric tonnes x grade / 31.10348).\n\u2022 The QPs are not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-political or marketing issues, or any other relevant issues that could materially affect the Mineral Resource Estimate.\n\nFurther details regarding the 2025 updated Mineral Resource Estimate, key assumptions, parameters and methods used to estimate the Mineral Resources of the Perron Gold Project are available on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) under the Corporation's issuer profile in accordance with NI 43-101.\n\nThe qualified persons independent of the issuer, responsible for the technical information in this Press Release are Stephen Coates, P.Eng. of Evomine, Alexandre Burelle, P.Eng. of Evomine, Florent Baril, P.Eng. of Bumigeme, Antoine Yassa P.Geo. of P&E, Charles Spath, M.Sc., P.Geo. of P&E, Yungang Wu, M.Sc., P.Geo. of P&E, Eugene Puritch, P.Eng., FEC, CET of P&E, Denys Vermette, P.Geo. of Norda Stelo and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Augustin, Ph.D., P.Geo. of Laurentia Exploration. They declare that they have read this press release and that the scientific and technical information relating to the resource estimate and preliminary economic assessment presented therein are correct.\n\nThe Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures in this document. These financial measures are not defined under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation. The Company believes that these financial measures, together with financial measures determined in accordance with IFRS, provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. The inclusion of these financial measures is meant to provide additional information and should not be used as a substitute for performance measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. These financial measures are not necessarily standard and therefore may not be comparable to other issuers.\n\nAll in sustaining cost is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated based on guidance published by the World Gold Council (\"WGC\"). The WGC is a market development organization for the gold industry and is an association whose membership comprises leading gold mining companies. Although the WGC is not a mining industry regulatory organization, it worked closely with its member companies to develop these metrics. Adoption of the all-in sustaining cost metric is voluntary and not necessarily standard, and therefore, this measure presented by the Company may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. The Company believes that the all-in sustaining cost measure complements existing measures and ratios reported.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost includes both operating and capital costs required to sustain gold production on an ongoing basis. Sustaining operating costs represent expenditures expected to be incurred that are considered necessary to maintain production. Sustaining capital represents expected capital expenditures comprising mine development costs, including capitalized waste, and ongoing replacement of mine equipment and other capital facilities, and does not include expected capital expenditures for major growth projects or enhancement capital for significant infrastructure improvements.\n\nAmex Exploration Inc. has made significant high-grade gold discoveries, along with copper-rich volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) zones, at its 100%-owned Perron Gold Project, located approximately 110 kilometres north of Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec. The Project comprises 117 contiguous claims (45.18 km\u00b2) and hosts both bulk-tonnage and high-grade gold mineralization styles.\n\nWhen combined with the adjacent Perron West Project, which includes 48 claims (17.37 km\u00b2) in Quebec and 35 claims (134.55 km\u00b2) in Ontario, the consolidated land package spans a district-scale 197.52 km\u00b2. This extensive property lies within highly prospective geology favourable for both high-grade gold and VMS mineralization.\n\nThe Project benefits from excellent infrastructure: it is accessible by a year-round road, located just 20 minutes from an airport, and approximately 8 km from the Town of Norm\u00e9tal. It is also in close proximity to several process plants owned by major gold producers.\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nTo view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/265097",

Inferred Mineral Resources are considered too geologically speculative to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves. There is no certainty that the economic forecasts on which the PEA is based will be realized.\n- The economic analysis of the project was carried out using a discounted cash flow approach on a pre-tax and after-tax basis with a discount rate of 5%.\n- Revenue was based on a long-term gold price of $2,500/oz in USD.\nUnderpinned by world class infrastructure, the Perron PEA demonstrates a top-tier high margin gold mining operation in the stable jurisdiction of Quebec, Canada. The Project is located within the Abitibi region, one of the most prolific gold belts in the world.\nThe PEA results confirm that Perron has the potential to be a stand-alone and highly profitable operation with an excellent internal rate of return (IRR) and after-tax net present value (NPV) at a range of gold prices.\nThe PEA shows that Perron has the potential to be a mine with limited environmental impact, utilizing the mined out open pits to store tailings and therefore avoiding the construction of a tailings management facility.\nMining\nThe mine will be operated as a mechanized underground operation, which will be complemented by open pit production. The mine will have an overall average production rate of 1,000 tpd of mineralized material during Phase 1 and a capacity of 2,000 tpd of mineralized material during Phase 2. Production is preceded by a 21-month pre-production period.\nThe selected underground mining method is longitudinal longhole stoping with cemented rockfill. Stope dimensions average 17.5 m in length, 25 m in height, and 4.7 m in width (LOM average) with a minimum mining width of 3.0 m. The different sectors of mine will be accessed via ramps and drifts to allow the efficient circulation of mobile mining equipment and to satisfy ventilation and emergency egress requirements. Pre-production and Phase 1 mining activities will mostly be done by a contractor, while Phase 2 considers a fleet of owner-operated equipment that includes 10 tonne LHDs and 42 tonne haul trucks.\nSeven open pits are included in the mine plan and utilize conventional truck and shovel mining that will be executed by a contractor. The pits will begin to be mined at the beginning of Phase 1, with material completely extracted by year 13 as the pits are sequenced such that they can be used to manage all tailings generated by the on-site mill during Phase 2 of the Project.\nFigure 1: Mine Design\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/2667/265097_2e5fd6dcc4235a69_002full.jpg\nTable 4: Mine Physicals\n| Total | Yr -2 | Yr -1 | Yr 1 | Yr 2 | Yr 3 | Yr 4 | Yr 5 | Yr 6 | Yr 7 | Yr 8 | ||\n| Mineralized material UG | kt | 9,534 | 0 | 89 | 211 | 346 | 377 | 383 | 541 | 592 | 578 | 625 |\n| Waste rock mined - UG | kt | 4,346 | 75 | 159 | 205 | 229 | 220 | 211 | 339 | 292 | 258 | 293 |\n| Subtotal - UG | kt | 13,881 | 75.6 | 248 | 417 | 575 | 597 | 594 | 880 | 885 | 835 | 917 |\n| Mineralized material OP | kt | 1,308 | - | - | 0 | 64 | 144 | 153 | 10 | 105 | 36 | 122 |\n| Waste rock mined OP | kt | 11,044 | - | - | 0 | 745 | 1,067 | 980 | 133 | 924 | 366 | 1,033 |\n| Overburden mined OP | kt | 7,298 | 28 | - | 1,087 | 762 | 529 | 316 | 1,305 | 736 | 1,428 | 666 |\n| Subtotal - OP | kt | 19,651 | 28 | 0 | 1,087 | 1,571 | 1,741 | 1,448 | 1,448 | 1,764 | 1,830 | 1,821 |\n| Strip ratio - OP | - | 14.0 | - | - | - | 23.5 | 11.1 | 8.5 | 143.2 | 15.9 | 49.7 | 13.9 |\n| Total mining | kt | 33,531 | 104 | 248 | 1,503 | 2,146 | 2,337 | 2,042 | 2,328 | 2,649 | 2,665 | 2,739 |\n| Total mineralized material | kt | 10,843 | 0 | 89 | 211 | 410 | 521 | 536 | 551 | 697 | 614 | 747 |\n| Total | Yr 9 | Yr 10 | Yr 11 | Yr 12 | Yr 13 | Yr 14 | Yr 15 | Yr 16 | Yr 17 | Yr 18 | ||\n| Mineralized material UG | kt | 9,534 | 564 | 535 | 650 | 653 | 626 | 658 | 660 | 658 | 647 | 141 |\n| Waste rock mined - UG | kt | 4,346 | 236 | 204 | 280 | 302 | 275 | 252 | 257 | 189 | 71 | 0 |\n| Subtotal - UG | kt | 13,881 | 800 | 739 | 930 | 955 | 901 | 910 | 916 | 847 | 718 | 141 |\n| Mineralized material OP | kt | 1,308 | 71 | 115 | 201 | 191 | 96 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Waste rock mined OP | kt | 11,044 | 1,284 | 1,659 | 1,545 | 1,049 | 259 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Overburden mined OP | kt | 7298 | 425 | 16.3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Subtotal - OP | kt | 19,651 | 1,781 | 1,791 | 1,746 | 1,240 | 355 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Strip ratio - OP | - | 14.0 | 24.1 | 14.6 | 7.7 | 5.5 | 2.7 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Total mining | kt | 33,531 | 2,581 | 2,530 | 2,676 | 2,196 | 1,256 | 910 | 916 | 847 | 717 | 140 |\n| Total mineralized material | kt | 10,843 | 635 | 650 | 851 | 844 | 722 | 658 | 660 | 658 | 647 | 141 |\nProcessing\nPhase 1 representing a 4-year 1,000 tpd contract mined, toll-milling operation in the Abitibi region, where numerous processing plants are in operation. Mineralized material will be loaded at the project site and transported by truck to the processing destination.\nTo date, AMEX has not entered into a toll milling arrangement with any third-party owner of a processing facility to treat its material. However, discussions were initiated and there are several parties that own processing facilities within the Abitibi region, with some permitted for toll milling and others that could be permitted upon arrangement, that could potentially treat the Perron mineralized material. Bumigeme inc., a mineral processing consultant based in Montr\u00e9al (Canada), reviewed the flowsheets of these mills which are similar to the flowsheet developed in the PEA study for treating the Perron mineralized material. Bumigeme is confident that the recoveries anticipated from the toll treatment of ore from the Perron deposit will reach 94-95%, matching the expectations for the on-site processing plant (Phase 2). The Toll milling assumptions used in the PEA consists of an cost of CA$102.00 per tonne, covering for on-site crushing, transport and toll milling cost. A sensitivity analysis has been done on this cost and is presented in the Financial Analysis section.\nPhase 2 consists of the construction and commissioning of a 2,000 tpd processing plant on-site at the Perron project. The plant will be in operation from year 5 to the end of the LOM. The flowsheet consists of primary crushing, followed by a grinding circuit consisting of a semi-autogenous grinding mill of 5.5 m diameter x 1.8 m long in an opened circuit and a ball mill of 4.0 m diameter x 6.7 m long in a closed circuit with cyclones - SABC circuit. A gravity circuit followed by leaching will recover coarse gold from the cyclone underflow, while the cyclone overflow, at a P80=74 microns, is treated in a six (6) tank carbon-in-leach circuit, followed by SO2/air cyanide destruction. Gold will be recovered in an adsorption-desorption-recovery circuit and electrowinning cells, with gold room recovery and production of bullion bars. The CIL tailings after the cyanide destruction will be pumped to a high-rate thickener to increase the slurry density to 62-64 % solid and pumped to empty pits.\nTests conducted in 2020 and 2024 on Perron ore achieved gold recoveries exceeding 95% using a gravity/cyanidation process. Based on these results and the treatment processes studied for four potential toll milling plants, an average recovery rate of 95% was considered for both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the LOM. The process plant building will include a laboratory, mill offices, a dry and an electrical and mechanical shop.\nFigure 2: Flowsheet\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/2667/265097_2e5fd6dcc4235a69_003full.jpg\nTable 5: Gold Production by Source (Underground (UG) and Open Pit (OP))\n| Total | Yr -2 | Yr -1 | Yr 1 | Yr 2 | Yr 3 | Yr 4 | Yr 5 | Yr 6 | Yr 7 | Yr 8 | ||\n| UG Grade Processed | g/t | 5.5 | - | 14.5 | 8.1 | 10.8 | 9.6 | 11.3 | 10.8 | 6.6 | 5.6 | 5.8 |\n| UG Gold Recovered | oz | 1,593 | - | 20 | 63 | 113 | 107 | 126 | 190 | 120 | 99 | 110 |\n| OP Grade Processed | g/t | 2.2 | - | - | - | 5.0 | - | - | 2.7 | 2.9 | 2.8 | 2.2 |\n| OP Gold Recovered | oz | 87 | - | - | - | 0 | - | - | 2 | 12 | 13 | 7 |\n| Total Grade Processed | g/t | 5.1 | - | 14.5 | 8.1 | 10.7 | 9.6 | 11.3 | 10.5 | 5.9 | 5.0 | 5.3 |\n| Total Gold Recovered | oz | 1,680 | - | 20 | 63 | 113 | 107 | 126 | 191 | 132 | 112 | 117 |\n| Total | Yr 9 | Yr 10 | Yr 11 | Yr 12 | Yr 13 | Yr 14 | Yr 15 | Yr 16 | Yr 17 | Yr 18 | ||\n| UG Grade Processed | g/t | 5.5 | 4.6 | 3.2 | 3.6 | 4.7 | 3.1 | 2.8 | 3.5 | 4.3 | 3.1 | 3.3 |\n| UG Gold Recovered | oz | 1,593 | 80 | 52 | 71 | 94 | 60 | 57 | 71 | 87 | 62 | 14 |\n| OP Grade Processed | g/t | 2.2 | 2.3 | 2.0 | 1.8 | 1.2 | 1.9 | 1.9 | 1.9 | 1.9 | 1.9 | - |\n| OP Gold Recovered | oz | 87 | 12 | 12 | 5 | 3 | 6 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | - |\n| Total Grade Processed | g/t | 5.1 | 4.1 | 2.9 | 3.4 | 4.3 | 3.0 | 2.8 | 3.3 | 4.1 | 3.0 | 3.3 |\n| Total Gold Recovered | oz | 1,680 | 91 | 64 | 75 | 97 | 66 | 61 | 75 | 91 | 65 | 14 |\nFigure 3: Gold Production per Year\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/2667/265097_figure3.jpg\nInfrastructure\nThe Project is approximately 6.5 kilometers from the town of Norm\u00e9tal, Quebec and is accessible via a well-maintained forestry road. The Project will require construction of the supporting infrastructure items, such as:\nPhase 1\n- Gatehouse and service and haulage roads;\n- Temporary buildings to be used by the mining contractor (maintenance shop, warehouses, offices, dry, etc.);\n- 6.5 kilometers of 25kV transmission line and an on-site substation;\n- Surface water management facilities including final effluent water treatment plant, ditches, pond and pumping stations;\n- Underground mine portal, mine ventilation systems (intake and exhaust) and waste dump and overburden storage facilities;\n- Mineralized material loading facilities;\nPhase 2\n- 2,000 tpd process plant complex;\n- Required infrastructures to pump the plant tailings to emptied open-pits;\n- Maintenance shop;\n- Administration building;\n- Warehouse\n- Additional surface water management facilities;\n- Additional service and haulage roads;\nThese infrastructures and facilities will require different authorizations and permits prior to being built and operated. No camp will be required considering the nearby qualified labor pool.\nFigure 4: Suggested Infrastructure Arrangement\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/2667/265097_2e5fd6dcc4235a69_005full.jpg\nFigure 5: General site arrangement\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/2667/265097_2e5fd6dcc4235a69_006full.jpg\nWorkforce\nDuring steady state operations, the number of employees (mine, process plant and G&A) is expected to peak at 272 people during Phase 1 of mine operation and at 335 people during Phase 2, including contractors (open pit mining, underground mining, contract services, etc.).\nTailings\nDuring Phase 1, the tailings will be managed off-site at the toll mill facility. During Phase 2, the tailings storage plan will take advantage of open pits that will be mined in the first 13 years of mine operations. Process plant rejects will be thickened and pumped to the mined-out pits sequentially for permanent storage. Tailings will then consolidate over time and excess water will either be used for processing requirements or discharged to the environment once quality conditions are met. This concept aims to limit the environmental impact of the Perron Project, to limit the risks related to traditional Tailings Management Facility (TMF) stability, to simplify short-term and long-term monitoring and to greatly reduce the capital and operating costs related to tailings management.\nFigure 6: Visual of in-pit tailings disposal\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/2667/265097_2e5fd6dcc4235a69_007full.jpg\nCapital Expenditure\nThe total initial construction capital expenditure (\"Initial CAPEX\"), which is to bring Phase 1 of the Project into operation, is estimated at $146.1M, which will be partially offset from $68.6M in pre-production gold sales credits for an initial net CAPEX of $77.5M. It accounts for site development, the construction of a 25kV powerline connecting to the existing electrical substation in Norm\u00e9tal and the initial development of the underground mine. The Initial CAPEX estimate includes $7.4M of EPCM and indirect costs and a contingency of $9.2M.\nThe total growth capital expenditure (\"Growth CAPEX\"), to bring Phase 2 of the Project into operation, is estimated at $191.6M. It includes the costs of building a 2,000 tpd mill on site and acquiring an underground mobile equipment fleet. It also accounts for further site development, including a truck shop, warehouse and an administration facility. Additionally, the Growth CAPEX estimate includes $30.5M of EPCM and indirect costs and a contingency of $22.3M.\nThe Sustaining CAPEX (\"SUSEX\") is estimated to be $386.3M, including $11.4M of closure and rehabilitation costs. Underground mining SUSEX is earmarked for mining development, additional equipment, replacement units, and major repairs. Other SUSEX captures in-pit tailings storage, infrastructure and G&A.\nQuotations from reputable suppliers were obtained for most of the large and high-cost equipment required for the plant, mine and site infrastructure. For other equipment and supplies, cost estimates were based on comparable projects, historical data or derived through consultants' in-house databases.\nTable 6: Capital Expenditures\n| Item | Unit | Phase 1 | Phase 22 | Sustaining | Total |\n| Site Preparation | CA$M | 3.0 | 5.7 | - | 8.7 |\n| Infrastructure | CA$M | 6.0 | 13.2 | 0.6 | 19.8 |\n| Power & Electrical | CA$M | 6.7 | 4.3 | - | 11.0 |\n| Water Management | CA$M | 9.6 | 6.0 | - | 15.6 |\n| Process Plant | CA$M | - | 61.8 | - | 61.8 |\n| Mining Fleet | CA$M | 5.1 | 44.8 | 47.3 | 97.2 |\n| Underground Development | CA$M | 46.4 | - | 316.2 | 362.7 |\n| Tailings Management | - | 3.0 | 10.8 | 13.8 | |\n| Closure and Rehabilitation | CA$M | - | - | 11.4 | 11.4 |\n| Pre-production OPEX | CA$M | 52.6 | - | - | 52.6 |\n| Indirects | CA$M | 7.4 | 30.5 | - | 40.9 |\n| Contingency | CA$M | 9.2 | 22.3 | - | 42.3 |\n| Sub-Total | CA$M | 146.1 | 191.6 | 386.3 | 724.0 |\n| Pre-Production Revenues1 | CA$M | -68.6 | -68.6 | ||\n| Total | CA$M | 77.5 | 191.6 | 386.3 | 655.4 |\nNotes\n1 Consists of mineralized material mined and sold during the pre-production period, ie., before the mined is developed at a point where a constant mining rate of 600 tonnes per day is sustainable (60% of the planned rate of 1,000 tonnes per day).\n2 Phase 2 CAPEX represents the investment needed to build a processing plant on site and to increase the mining rate at 2,000 tonnes per day.\n- As per the CIM Estimation of Mineral Resources & Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines, working capital is reported separately to CAPEX in the economic model.\nOperating Costs\nLOM total operating cost is estimated at US$891 per ounce of gold produced, as summarized below. The LOM total AISC is estimated to be US$1,061 per ounce of gold produced based on a total gold production of 1,660,000 ounces over the 17.5 years of mine life. This cost structure places the Project in the bottom quartile of the global gold cost curve, which is mostly due to the high-grade nature of the mineralized material and to the simplicity of mining.\nTable 8: Operating Costs\n| Item | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | LOM | |||\n| CA$M | US$/Au oz | CA$M | US$/Au oz | CA$M | US$/Au oz | |\n| Mining Cost (UG + OP) | 318.2 | 567 | 927.5 | 540 | 1,245.6 | 547 |\n| Off-Site Transport | 53.2 | 95 | - | - | 53.1 | 23 |\n| Off-Site Processing | 82.4 | 147 | - | - | 82.4 | 36 |\n| On-Site Processing | - | - | 277.9 | 162 | 277.9 | 122 |\n| Water Management | 1.3 | 2 | 7.1 | 4 | 8.4 | 4 |\n| General and Administration | 50.6 | 90 | 217.8 | 127 | 268.4 | 118 |\n| Selling Costs | 2.3 | 4 | 6.9 | 4 | 9.2 | 4 |\n| Royalty (1.5%) | 21 | 37 | 64.2 | 37 | 85.3 | 37 |\n| Total Operating Costs | 529.0 | 943 | 1,501.4 | 874 | 2,030.4 | 891 |\n| Sustaining Capital | 125 | 222 | 261.7 | 152 | 386.3 | 170 |\n| All-in Sustaining Costs (''AISC'') | 653.6 | 1,165 | 1,763.1 | 1,027 | 2,416.7 | 1,061 |\nTable 8: Unit Operating Costs\n| Item | Unit | Phase 1 | Phase 2 |\n| Underground Mining | CA$t/mined | 199.1 | 97.2 |\n| Open-Pit Mining | CA$t/mined | 9.6 | 10.0 |\n| Off-Site Transport | CA$t/milled | 40.0 | - |\n| Crushing & Off-Site Processing | CA$t/milled | 62.0 | - |\n| On-Site Processing | CA$t/milled | - | 29.4 |\n| Water Management | CA$t/milled | 1.0 | 0.8 |\n| General & Administration | CA$t/milled | 38.1 | 23.0 |\n| Selling Costs | CA$t/milled | 1.7 | 0.7 |\n| Royalty (1.5%) | CA$t/milled | 15.8 | 6.8 |\nFinancial Analysis\nAt base case gold price of US$2,500/oz and exchange rate of 1.38, the Project generates a post-tax Net Present Value (\"NPV\") of $1,085M using 5% discount rate and a post-tax Internal Rate of Return (\"IRR\") of 70.1% with a payback period of 1.4 years from the commencement of commercial production. The Project generates cumulative post-tax free cash flow of $1,768M over the 17.5-year production period. Total taxes payable over LOM at the base case gold price is $1,243M.\nFigure 7: After-Tax FCF\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/2667/265097_figure7.jpg\nThe PEA financial economic analysis is significantly influenced by gold prices.

In the regulation, a \"mine\" is defined as all the surface and underground infrastructures forming part of a mineral substance operation, except surface mineral substances within the meaning of the Mining Act (chapter M-13.1). The scope of the environmental impact assessment will be defined by the directive (guideline) issued by the Minist\u00e8re de l'Environnement, de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques, de la Faune et des Parcs (MELCCFP) subsequent to the filing of the Project Notice by Amex, in accordance with section 31.2 of the Environment Quality Act (EQA).\nAn environmental and social scoping study is currently underway to identify the key environmental and social risks and issues associated with the project construction and operation and to more accurately define the scope of the environmental baseline studies required. The acquisition of baseline environmental knowledge on the Perron property began several years ago and is still ongoing today. The environmental baseline studies and early public consultations, help characterize the receiving environment and identify areas that are more ecologically or socially rich or sensitive. This information will be used as part of the environmental assessment process and the feasibility studies to further develop and optimize the project with the objective of ensuring the project environmental and social acceptability.\nOnce the environmental assessment and review procedure is completed and the project is approved, the various project components will require specific provincial and federal permits and authorizations. At the provincial level, this will include ministerial authorizations that must be electronically filed with the appropriate forms to comply with the EQA and the Regulation respecting the regulatory scheme applying to activities on the basis of their environmental impact (REAFIE) (Q-2, r. 17.1), the Mining Act (chapter M-13.1), as well as other provincial acts and regulations. At the federal level, some project components and impacts may require specific authorizations according to federal legal and regulatory framework, including authorizations under the Fisheries Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. F-14, the Metal and Diamond Mining Effluent Regulations (SOR/2002-222) and other federal acts and regulations.\nStakeholder Engagement\nThe aboriginal community affected by Amex's activities is the Abitibiwinni First Nation which is an Algonquin First Nation residing primarily in the community of Pikogan in the Abitibi-Temiscamingue region. The Pikogan community, also called Abitibiwinni, is located three (3) kilometers from the town of Amos on the west bank of the Harricana River. The Perron project is located on a part of the ancestral territory of the Algonquin Anishinabeg Nation. A relationship of trust and respect has been built with the Abitibiwinni First Nation Council over the years through consistent transparency and consultation. With respect to local communities near the project, Norm\u00e9tal, Valcanton and Saint-Lambert are the main municipalities surrounding the Perron project.\nAmex has always prioritized engaging stakeholders and implementing communication and consultation plans. Communication plans include a summary of the work completed on the property every six months as well as the company's exploration and development plans for the coming months. Active community participation in the development and implementation of the project is one of Amex's core values and aids in fostering good long-term relationships. Amex will continue consulting, supporting and informing all stakeholders at all stages of the project development. With this in mind, Ames aims to establish various working and consultation committees by the end of 2025.\nExploration Update\nWith the recent acquisition of the Perron West property (see press release dated March 25, 2025) quadrupling Amex's land holdings along the Norm\u00e9tal-Burntbush greenstone belt, the Company's exploration plans are significantly expanding to cover the vast, new area of prospective geology. Amex's constant evolution of knowledge of the mineralization styles and structures with the Beaupr\u00e9 Block on Perron will provide invaluable insight into guiding exploration on the Company's expanded land package.\nCurrently, Amex has multiple teams conducting surface exploration work on the 15,192-hectare Perron West project. Teams of technicians are completing large and widespread soil sampling programs to find and/or further define gold-in-soil anomalies, while teams of geologists are completing surface prospecting work, including mapping, grab sampling, structural measurements of outcrops, etc. The work is expected to be completed in the coming weeks, with the results to help further define the existing anomalies on the property and further solidify drill planning for a maiden program on Perron West in 2026.\nIn addition, structural geology specialists from consultant Norda Stelo are continuing work on a thoroughly detailed 3D lithostructural model on the Perron property. This project is nearing completion and will help guide drill planning for the remainder of the year and into 2026 at Perron. The outcomes from this model will also improve Amex's understand and build upon a larger scaled regional structural framework, that will aid drill planning efforts on the Perron West property.\nThe Company will update the market with more in-depth details on drill planning for Perron in the near future.\nMineral Resource Estimate\nThe updated PEA was based on the NI 43-101 compliant Perron Project MRE, with an effective date of May 21, 2025 (please see the linked press release). The mineral resources that have flowed to the mine plan at Perron come from multiple zones, with major contributions from the Champagne, Denise, Team, Grey Cat and Gratien zones.\nTable 1: Summary of total Mineral Resources at the Perron Project\n| Zone | Class | OPEN PIT (CoG 0.40 gpt Au) | UNDERGROUND (CoG 1.40 gpt Au) | TOTAL | ||||||\n| Tonnes | Au | Au | Tonnes | Au | Au | Tonnes | Au | Au | ||\n| k | g/t | koz | k | g/t | koz | kt | g/t | koz | ||\n| Total | Meas | 48 | 1.1 | 2 | 333 | 14.2 | 152 | 382 | 12.54 | 154 |\n| Ind | 2,520 | 3.16 | 256 | 5,281 | 7.1 | 1,205 | 7,801 | 5.83 | 1,461 | |\n| M&I | 2,569 | 3.12 | 258 | 5,614 | 7.52 | 1,357 | 8,183 | 6.14 | 1,615 | |\n| Inf | 1,044 | 2.02 | 68 | 4,000 | 4.9 | 631 | 5,044 | 4.31 | 698 |\nPerron Gold project Mineral Estimate notes:\n- The Mineral Resource Estimate is compliant with CIM 2019 Best Practices Guidelines for reporting Mineral Resources and Reserves.\n- Mineral Resources are presented undiluted and in situ and are considered to have reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The Mineral Resources near surface are constrained by pit optimization surfaces and the underground Mineral Resources are constrained by potentially mineable stope shapes.\n- The database is comprised of a total of 1,807 drill holes for 608492.30 metres of drilling (which includes historical drilling completed by previous operators, abandoned and exploration holes) in the extent of the Mineral Resource, of which (359 087.40 metres) 305,523 samples were assayed as of March 31, 2025, grid spacing is variable.\n- All NQ core assays reported by Amex were obtained by analytical methods described below under \"QA/QC\".\n- Geological interpretation of the zones was based on lithologies, mineralized zones orientation and cut-off grade considerations. Each zone has its own characteristic of mineral occurrence and amount of recoverable gold.\n- Geological wireframe interpretation was initially made from cross-sections at intervals in GEMSTM, and then completed in LeapfrogTM where selections of mineralized intervals were combined to generate mineralized wireframes. Wireframes are generally subvertical with various plunges.\n- The Mineral Resource Estimate encompasses a total of 115 wireframes, sub-vertical gold-bearing domains, each defined by individual wireframes with a minimum downhole width of 2.0 m.\n- Assay Samples were composited within the mineralization envelopes into 1.0 m length composites. A value of 0.001 g/t Au was applied in cases of drill core not assayed.\n- High-grade capping was done on composite data and established using a statistical analysis on a per-zone basis for gold. Capping varied from 5 g/t Au to 500 g/t Au and was applied on composites within each specific wireframe.\n- Bulk density values were applied on the different mineralized zones varied from 2.7 to 2.8 t/m3 based on site drill core measurements.\n- Inverse distance cubed grade interpolation was used.\n- Grade estimates are based on a parent block dimension of 5m x 5m x 5m with sub-cells down to 1m x 1m x 1m. Search parameters were determined by variography.\n- The Perron Mineral Resource Estimate is classified as Measured, Indicated and Inferred as follows:\n- The Measured Mineral Resource classification is defined by areas where drill hole sample spacing is less than 10 m, blocks are informed by a minimum of three drill holes, and reasonable geological and grade continuity is shown.\n- The Indicated Mineral Resource classification is defined by areas where drill spacing is less than 30 m (except Champagne Zone at 40 m), blocks are informed by a minimum of two drill holes, and reasonable geological and grade continuity is shown.\n- The Inferred Mineral Resource classification is defined by the limits of the constraining wireframes, blocks are informed by a minimum of one drill hole, and reasonable, however, not verified, geological and grade continuity is observed.\n- Grade estimates use metric units (metres, tonnes and g/t). Metal contents are presented in troy ounces (metric tonnes x grade / 31.10348).\n- The QPs are not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-political or marketing issues, or any other relevant issues that could materially affect the Mineral Resource Estimate.\nFurther details regarding the 2025 updated Mineral Resource Estimate, key assumptions, parameters and methods used to estimate the Mineral Resources of the Perron Gold Project are available on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) under the Corporation's issuer profile in accordance with NI 43-101.\nQualified Persons\nThe qualified persons independent of the issuer, responsible for the technical information in this Press Release are Stephen Coates, P.Eng. of Evomine, Alexandre Burelle, P.Eng. of Evomine, Florent Baril, P.Eng. of Bumigeme, Antoine Yassa P.Geo. of P&E, Charles Spath, M.Sc., P.Geo. of P&E, Yungang Wu, M.Sc., P.Geo. of P&E, Eugene Puritch, P.Eng., FEC, CET of P&E, Denys Vermette, P.Geo. of Norda Stelo and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Augustin, Ph.D., P.Geo. of Laurentia Exploration.

These financial measures are not defined under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation. The Company believes that these financial measures, together with financial measures determined in accordance with IFRS, provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. The inclusion of these financial measures is meant to provide additional information and should not be used as a substitute for performance measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. These financial measures are not necessarily standard and therefore may not be comparable to other issuers.\nAll-in sustaining cost\nAll in sustaining cost is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated based on guidance published by the World Gold Council (\"WGC\"). The WGC is a market development organization for the gold industry and is an association whose membership comprises leading gold mining companies. Although the WGC is not a mining industry regulatory organization, it worked closely with its member companies to develop these metrics. Adoption of the all-in sustaining cost metric is voluntary and not necessarily standard, and therefore, this measure presented by the Company may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. The Company believes that the all-in sustaining cost measure complements existing measures and ratios reported.\nAll-in sustaining cost includes both operating and capital costs required to sustain gold production on an ongoing basis. Sustaining operating costs represent expenditures expected to be incurred that are considered necessary to maintain production. Sustaining capital represents expected capital expenditures comprising mine development costs, including capitalized waste, and ongoing replacement of mine equipment and other capital facilities, and does not include expected capital expenditures for major growth projects or enhancement capital for significant infrastructure improvements.\nAbout Amex Exploration Inc.\nAmex Exploration Inc. has made significant high-grade gold discoveries, along with copper-rich volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) zones, at its 100%-owned Perron Gold Project, located approximately 110 kilometres north of Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec. The Project comprises 117 contiguous claims (45.18 km\u00b2) and hosts both bulk-tonnage and high-grade gold mineralization styles.\nWhen combined with the adjacent Perron West Project, which includes 48 claims (17.37 km\u00b2) in Quebec and 35 claims (134.55 km\u00b2) in Ontario, the consolidated land package spans a district-scale 197.52 km\u00b2. This extensive property lies within highly prospective geology favourable for both high-grade gold and VMS mineralization.\nThe Project benefits from excellent infrastructure: it is accessible by a year-round road, located just 20 minutes from an airport, and approximately 8 km from the Town of Norm\u00e9tal. It is also in close proximity to several process plants owned by major gold producers.\nFor further information, please contact:\nVictor Cantore\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nAmex Exploration: +1-514-866-8209\nTo view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/265097"

With a land package increase from 45.6 to 197.5 square kilometers (\"km2\") providing additional new targets to be explored. See press release dated March 25, 2025.\n- Infrastructure: The excellent nearby infrastructure continues to play a vital role at the Perron Project. The Company plans to complete an updated Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) utilizing the 2025 Mineral Resource Estimate, expected later this year.\nVictor Cantore, President and CEO, Director of Amex Exploration commented, \"We are thrilled to announce an updated Mineral Resource Estimate which shows an increase in contained ounces as well as grade. The high-grade, continuous nature of the Champagne Zone in particular, puts Amex in a unique position with exceptional flexibility for the development of the Project, which will be analyzed in detail for an updated PEA. This Mineral Resource Estimate demonstrates the team's ability to identify and grow the Perron Project into a world class gold asset.\"\nCantore continued, \"Given the quality of the project, we are pursuing a dual pathway of development and continued exploration at Perron. In today's gold price environment, these ounces are extremely lucrative, however, are also highly resilient to fluctuations in gold prices and I expect our upcoming PEA to reflect very positive economics. I look forward to updating all stakeholders in the coming weeks.\"\nJacques Trottier, PhD, Executive Chairman of Amex Exploration added, \"I believe the 2025 Mineral Resource Estimate clearly illustrates that the Perron Project is a tier one asset, when one takes into consideration the grade and continuity of gold mineralization along with the location and supporting infrastructure. We have yet to fully explore the Perron Project and with the addition of the Perron West, we have a district scale property for exploration and blue-sky upside. I would like to thank everyone involved in updating this Mineral Resource Estimate.\"\nMontreal, Quebec--(Newsfile Corp. - May 21, 2025) - Amex Exploration Inc. (TSXV: AMX) (FSE: MX0) (OTCQX: AMXEF) (\"Amex\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that it has completed an updated Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\") on the company's flagship Perron Project in the northwestern Abitibi region of Quebec. The Company engaged P&E Mining Consultants Inc. (\"P&E\"), established in 2004 and having produced more than over 450 NI 43-101 Technical Reports, to construct a 2025 MRE using 46,355 m of new drilling data as well as 562,137 m of previous drill data and a renewed focus on grade with tighter wireframe modelling (see below for further details). Consistent with the 2024 Mineral Resource Estimate, the majority of gold ounces come from the Company's newly renamed Champagne Zone (\"Champagne Zone\") (previously named the High Grade Zone), with important contributions from the Denise (\"Denise\"), Gratien (\"Gratien\"), Grey Cat (\"Grey Cat\") and Team Zones (\"Team\"). Geologic reinterpretation of some zones has allowed for more realistic high-grade, narrow vein potentially mineable stope shapes that are expected to have a positive impact on an updated PEA to be released later this year. All zones on the Property remain open for further expansion. With the Company's recent land acquisition (see Press Release dated March 25, 2025), Amex is positioned to make further discoveries and transform Perron to a potential district sized mining camp.\nAmex will be hosting a webinar Thursday, May 22, 2025 with Victor Cantore, CEO and Aaron Stone, VP Exploration at 10:00 am EDT to discuss the updated MRE in more detail. Please register here:\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_wqObmM3NRCqvKxZKSBO_Ag\n2025 MRE Highlights:\n- Open pit and underground stope constrained Mineral Resources of 1.615 Moz Measured and Indicated at 6.14 g/t in 8.183 Mt Au and 698 koz Inferred at 4.31 g/t Au in 5.044 Mt.\n- Underground stope constrained Mineral Resources of 1.357 Moz of Measured and Indicated at a grade of 7.52 g/t Au in 5.614 Mt and 631 koz of Inferred at a grade of 4.90 g/t Au in 4.000 Mt.\n- Open pit constrained Mineral Resource s of 258 koz of Measured and Indicated at a grade of 3.12 g/t Au in 2.569 Mt and 68 koz of Inferred at 2.02 g/t Au in 1.044 Mt.\n- Excellent continuity throughout the Project with exceptional high grade throughout, specifically in the Champagne Zone which alone hosts 831 koz Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources at 16.20 g/t Au in 1.594 Mt and 128 koz Inferred at 9.83 g/t Au in 406 kt.\n- Grade increases with added confidence in the Champagne Zone, as drill spacing is tightened to upgrade Mineral Resources from Inferred to Measured and Indicated which speaks to the exceptional continuity of the Champagne Zone. See Table 2\n- The 2025 MRE better reflects the high-grade nature of mineralization at Perron. By constraining the sample grade assays to selective narrow veins and structures, improved confident and higher-grade ounces have been realized in multiple zones, significantly reducing MRE modelling dilution.\n- All zones remain open at Perron, providing excellent future Mineral Resource expansion potential.\n- Metallurgical test work by SGS Canada achieved an overall gold recovery of up to 99% in the Champagne Zone and better than 95% in the Denise, Team, Gratien and Grey Cat Zones.\n- The excellent nearby infrastructure including housing, roads, electricity and labour continues to play a vital role at the Perron Project. The Company plans to complete an updated Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) utilizing the 2025 MRE, expected later this year.\n- The Perron Project also hosts VMS (copper-zinc) mineralization that has not been included in the updated MRE nor has any of the silver credits that exist in some zones of the Property. These remain an added upside value at the Project that the Company can decide to include and expand on at any time.\nSee Figure 1 for the location of the Perron Project, Figure 2 for a plan view of modelled wireframes in the 2025 Mineral Resources on the Property, Figure 3 for a longitudinal projection view of 2025 Mineral Resources constrained within open pits and underground stopes, and Table 1 for a summary of total Mineral Resources, Table 2 for summary of total Mineral Resources by zone and Table 3 for parameters used to constrain the 2025 Mineral Resources at Perron.\nFurther Details of 2025 MRE\nPerron's 2025 Mineral Resource increase in overall grade, tonnage and therefore ounces has been realized due to multiple factors including:\n- Data Analysis\n- An additional 46,355 m of drilling containing 30,114 assay results since the completion of the 2024 MRE were included, providing further levels of geologic detail on the Property.\n- Revision of the capping threshold for certain zones where statistically viable and coefficient of variation confirms.\n- Geologic Interpretation\n- Revised modelling interpretations resulting in a high-grade, narrow vein/structure approach versus large, massive mineralized zones formerly for Denise and Team Zones. This method takes away tonnage in certain areas of the project (see Figure 4 for an example in the Champagne Zone), however, focuses on quality grade and is therefore expected to have a positive impact on an updated PEA. Amex and P&E consider that this is a more accurate representation of the mineralization at Perron, where the majority of a future mining operation would be focused on high-grade, narrow vein material.\n- Mineralized wireframes have been refined and filled in along strike and extended down dip, thus explaining the increase in overall tonnage.\n- Geologic Modelling\n- Reinterpretation has resulted in improved continuity restricting data and modelling to narrow veins and structures.\n- Optimization of search ellipses in accordance to vein and structure orientations has resulted in more realistic grade propagation within block models which has had an overall positive impact on grade and ounces (see Figure 5).\nThe 2025 MRE has also realized a significant increase in the amount of Measured and Indicated (\"M&I\") Mineral Resource ounces on the Project, due to factors including:\n- Additional Data\n- A further 46,355 m of drilling across multiple zones containing 30,114 samples has provided significantly more geological information therefore improving the confidence and quality of the MRE.\n- Geological Interpretation\n- The additional data and improved geologic understanding of the zones has allowed for improved continuity within veins and their structures therefore increasing the confidence and quality of grade estimates.\n- Geological Modelling\n- Using variable orientation to guide search ellipses has resulted in more potentially mineable stope shapes.\n- Systematic review of classification resulted in manually smoothing classification solids after performing algorithmic classification (see Figure 6).\nAaron Stone, P.Geo, Vice President Exploration of Amex Exploration continued, \"This updated Mineral Resource proves that as we improve our geological understanding of the mineralization at Perron and the structures in which they are hosted, we can continue to unlock significant value in the Project. A renewed focus on grade has removed unnecessary modelling dilution in many areas of the Project, which in turn has increased the grades of many zones, highlighted by the exceptional Champagne Zone. With the additional data received since the 2024 Mineral Resource and an increased level of geological confidence, the mineralized wireframes in many areas have been better filled and expanded, resulting in overall increases in total tonnage and ounces. With the recent addition of the Perron West Project to our portfolio, I am excited by the prospect of making further discoveries along the Norm\u00e9tal-Burntbush Greenstone Belt, which remains highly unexplored in comparison to other greenstone belts in the Abitibi region.\"\nFigure 1: Location of the Perron Project, central Abitibi, 4km to the east of the Quebec-Ontario border.

An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applied to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to a Mineral Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with continued exploration. Totals may not sum due to rounding of numbers.\nFigure 4: Example from the Champagne Zone displaying the renewed focus on grade, removing internal modelling dilution with the vision of a rich, narrow vein mining operation.\nFigure 5: Another example of the renewed focus on grade vs volume. Additionally, two important changes for the Denise Zone were 1) increased tonnage of high-grade blocks by using variable orientation instead of search ellipses against the grain of domain and 2) based on geological understanding, wireframes we made sub-vertical which will allow for more cost-effective long hole stoping.\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/2667/252854_b85e380d74c5c873_006full.jpg\nFigure 6: Image to display the classification process for the Champagne Zone.

The Mineral Resources near surface are constrained by pit optimization surfaces and the underground Mineral Resources are constrained by potentially mineable stope shapes.\n- The database is comprised of a total of 1,807 drill holes for 608492.30 metres of drilling (which includes historical drilling completed by previous operators, abandoned and exploration holes) in the extent of the Mineral Resource, of which (359 087.40 metres) 305,523 samples were assayed as of March 31, 2025, grid spacing is variable.\n- All NQ core assays reported by Amex were obtained by analytical methods described below under \"QA/QC\".\n- Geological interpretation of the zones was based on lithologies, mineralized zones orientation and cut-off grade considerations. Each zone has its own characteristic of mineral occurrence and amount of recoverable gold.\n- Geological wireframe interpretation was initially made from cross-sections at intervals in GEMSTM, and then completed in LeapfrogTM where selections of mineralized intervals were combined to generate mineralized wireframes. Wireframes are generally subvertical with various plunges.\n- The Mineral Resource Estimate encompasses a total of 115 wireframes, sub-vertical gold-bearing domains each defined by individual wireframes with a minimum downhole width of 2.0 m.\n- Assay Samples were composited within the mineralization envelopes into 1.0 m length composites. A value of 0.001 g/t Au was applied in cases of drill core not assayed.\n- High grade capping was done on composite data and established using a statistical analysis on a per-zone basis for gold. Capping varied from 5 g/t Au to 500 g/t Au and was applied on composites within each specific wireframe.\n- Bulk density values were applied on the different mineralized zones varied from 2.7 to 2.8 t/m3 based on site drill core measurements.\n- Inverse distance cubed grade interpolation was used.\n- Grade estimates are based on a parent block dimension of 5m x 5m x 5m with sub-cells down to 1 x 1 m x 1 m. Search parameters were determined by variography.\n- The Perron Mineral Resource Estimate is classified as Measured, Indicated and Inferred as follows:\n- The Measured Mineral Resource classification is defined by areas where drill hole sample spacing is less than 10 m, blocks are informed by a minimum of three drill holes, and reasonable geological and grade continuity is shown.\n- The Indicated Mineral Resource classification is defined by areas where drill spacing is less than 30 m (except Champagne Zone at 40 m), blocks are informed by a minimum of two drill holes, and reasonable geological and grade continuity is shown.\n- The Inferred Mineral Resource classification is defined by the limits of the constraining wireframes, blocks are informed by a minimum of one drill hole, and reasonable, however, not verified, geological and grade continuity is observed.\n- Grade estimates use metric units (metres, tonnes and g/t). Metal contents are presented in troy ounces (metric tonnes x grade / 31.10348).\n- The QPs are not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-political or marketing issues, or any other relevant issues that could materially affect the Mineral Resource Estimate.\nFurther details regarding the 2025 updated Mineral Resource Estimate, key assumptions, parameters and methods used to estimate the Mineral Resources of the Perron Gold Project will be available on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) under the Corporation's issuer profile within 45 days of this news release in accordance with NI 43-101. This updated Mineral Resource Estimate will be the basis for an updated PEA.\nIndependent Qualified Persons\nThe Mineral Resource Estimate was prepared for Amex Exploration Inc. under the supervision of P&E Mining Consultants Inc.

Ph.D., (OGQ 2134), an independent \"Qualified Person\" as defined in National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (the \"Qualified Person\"), has reviewed and approved the geological information reported in this news release. The drilling campaign and the quality control program have been planned and supervised by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Augustin. Drill core logging and sampling were completed by Laurentia Exploration. The quality assurance and quality control protocols include insertion of blank or certified reference materials every 10 samples on average, in addition to the regular insertion of internal blank, duplicate, and certified reference materials provided by Laboratoire Expert during the analytical process.\nFor all analyses targeting gold mineralization, gold values are estimated by fire assay with finish by atomic absorption. Values greater than 3 ppm Au are reanalyzed by fire assay with gravimetric finish by Laboratoire Expert Inc, Rouyn-Noranda. Samples containing visible gold mineralization are analyzed by metallic sieve. For additional quality assurance and quality control, all samples were crushed to 90% less than 2 mm prior to pulverization, in order to homogenize samples which may contain coarse gold.\nFurthermore, gold mineralization associated with base metals were sent to ALS Canada Ltd., Rouyn-Noranda with the same quality assurance and quality control protocol to LabExpert. Gold values are estimated by fire assay with finish by atomic absorption. Zinc, copper and silver values are estimated by four acid digestion multi elements Inductively Coupled Plasma - Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES), ME-ICP61. Zinc values over 1%, copper values over 1% and silver values over 100 g/t are estimated by four acid digestion ICP-AES, OG62.\nAbout P&E Mining Consultants Inc.\nP&E Mining Consultants Inc., established in 2004, provides geological and mine engineering consulting reports, Mineral Resource Estimate technical reports, Preliminary Economic Assessments and Pre-Feasibility Studies.
