  "content": "TOM: GOOD MORNING THIS IS BLOOMBERG DAYBREAK: EUROPE I'M TOM MACKENZIE IN LONDON THESE ARE THE STORIES THAT SITE YOUR A 10 -- AGENDA. U.S. AND ALLIES PROMISED SECURITY GUARANTEES FOR UKRAINE. EUROPEAN FUTURES ARE HIGHER WITH GLOBAL STOCKS CLOSE TO RECORD HIGHS AND TREASURIES HOLD STEADY AFTER S & P CONFIRMS ITS LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING, CITING HIGHER TARIFF REVENUES. INTEL SOARS ON A $2 BILLION INVESTMENT BY SOFTBANK AND BLOOMBERG LEARNS THE U.S. IS CONSIDERING A 10% STAKE IN THE CHIPMAKER, WE BRING YOU OUR SCOOP. IT'S TUESDAY 19TH OF AUGUST LET'S CHECK ON THESE MARKETS. THE FOCUS ON THE MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE, THERE IS PROGRESS AND EU FUTURES ARE HIGHER BY 2/10 OF 1%, S & P DOWN 1/10 OF 1% AND NASDAQ LOWER BY 17 POINTS. JACKSOON HOLE IS COMING UP ON FRIDAY. THERE IS A REVENUE INCREASE FROM TARIFFS WITH PRESSURE ON TREASURIES AS MARKETS ADJUST THEIR VIEWS OF WHAT POWELL MAY SAY. GOLD IS UP JUST 5 POINTS. UBS RAISING THEIR GOLD FORECAST IN 2026 ON INCREASED FED CUTS AND WEAKER USD. CHINESE STOCKS CLOSE TO HIGHS, MINMIN LOW STANDING BY IN HONG KONG. MINMIN: A SEA OF RED, INVESTORS ON EDGE, BUT TODAY WAS A BIG DAY WITH AN AUCTION FOR THE ONE AND TWENTY YEAR BOND AND THE DEMAND IS TEPID BELOW AVERAGE, FLIP THE BOARD AND YOU CAN SEE. POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY AND FISCAL SPENDING HAS INVESTORS CONCERNED AND DRAG THE MARKET. FLIP THE BOARD, LOOK AT CHINA, A SEA OF GREEN AND A SLOW BURN AND SURGE IN THE CHINESE MARKET. THE MARGIN BALANCES IS CLOSE TO LEVELS FROM 2015 AND A LOT OF INTEREST FROM INVESTORS, TRADERS SAY THIS BOOM IS DIFFERENT FROM THE BOOM AND BUST OF LATE, A SLOW BURN THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN WANTING, TO CREATE A WELATH CREATION EFFECT. SO YES, KEEPING AN EYE ON THIS RALLY IN CHINA. TOM: SHANGHAI COMP UP, TO YOUR POINT. THANK YOU, INDED. ED. TRUMP ITCHED A MEETING BETWEEN PUTIN AND ZELENSKYY, FOLLOWED BY A TRILATERAL SUMMIT. TRUMP: PUTIN AGREED RUSSIA WOUL D ACCEPT GUARANTEES FOR UKRAINE AND WE ARE CONSIDERING WHO WILL DO WHAT AND COLLECTIVELY, WE CAN AGREE TO DETER AGRESSION AND THE EU NATIONS WILL TAKE THE BURDEN. WE WILL HELP MAKE IT SECURE. TOM: OLIVER CROOK JOINS ME NOW. REMARKABLE, WE SEE THIS REGULARLY, BUT TO SEE LEADERS AT THE TABLE WITH TRUMP, FLATTERY WAS A WIN FOR EUROPEAN LEADERS. OLLIE: IT IS RARE TO SEE THEM IN ONE PLACE, WHETHER THE WHITE HOUSE -- THIS WAS WAS A G7 MEETING. THEY DROPPED EVERYTHING TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH TRUMP TO VALIDATE HIS EFFORT. THERE IS A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE TRUMP TRAIN IS LEAVING AND IF YOU ARE NOT SURE OF THE PATH, THE ONLY THING WORSE IS NOT HAVING INFLUENCE. THAT'S WHY THEY SPOKE TO TRUMP AND TOOK QUESTIONS, MADE STATEMENTS TO OUTLINE THE PROGRESS THEY WANT. WHAT ARE THESE SECURITY GUARANTEES, WHAT IS EVERYONE'S ROLE IN THAT? TRUMP REITERATED THE U.S. IS COMMITTED TO THE SECURITY, A LOT WE DON'T KNOW. AND THE CEASE FIRE WAS PUSHED FOR AND THIS IDEA OF A TRILATERAL, AN ABSOLUTE PRIORITY. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT OR DETAILS ON SECURITY. WILL THE U.S. ENGAGE IF RUSSIA IMPOSES ON UKRAINE? THERE IS IMPETUS TO MOVE QUICKLY. TOM: OKAY, SO THE DETAILS STILL TO BE WORKED OUT. ON THE NEXT STEPS, YOU TOUCHED ON SOME OF THIS, BUT WHAT ABOUT A MEETING BETWEEN UKRAINE AND PUTIN, WHAT DO WE KNOW? OLLIE: SO WHAT THE EU LEADERS LIKE IS A TRILATERAL MEEETING. WE HEARD FROM TRUMP THAT AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE MEETING, HE CALLED PUTIN FOR A MEETING BETWEEN PUTIN AND UKRAINE. THEN THERE WILL BE A TRILATERAL MEETING WITH TRUMP. ZELENSKYY TALKED ABOUT THE MEETING AND CONCLUDING THE WAR. ZELENSKYY: WE NEED TO STOP THIS WAR, TO STOP RUSSIA AND WE WILL DO OUR BEST TO SHOW WE ARE STRONG AND SUPPORT THE U.S. TO STOP THE WAR. TO MAKE DIPLOMATIC WAY OF FINISHING THIS WAR AND WE ARE READY FOR TRILATERAL, THIS IS VERY GOOD. OLLIE: THE IMPETUS FROM THE EU LEADERS IS FULL FAITH IN TRUMP, BUT IF IT FAILS, THEY WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THEIR SIDE WAS NOT THE IMPEDIMENT TO PEACE AND GUARANTEES NEED TO BE SOLD DOMESTICALLY IF WE ARE DEPLOYING TROOPS IN UKRAINE, THAT'S NOT A DONE DEAL SO THAT IS PART OF THE WORK. TOM: REALLY IMPORTANT, OLIVER WITH THE LATEST. FISCAL PICUTTURE IN THE U.S. A DOUBLE A RATING WITH TARIFFS OFFSETTING TRUMP'S BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL. VAL, IS THIS A WIN FOR TRUMP? VAL: THE SPENDING IN THR BILL IS LOOKED AT AND RATED OKAY, OFFSET BY TARIFFS REVENUE AND AMID THE RISE IN TARIFFS, WE EXPECT REVENUE TO OFFSET THE WEAKER FISCAL OUTCOMES FROM THE BILL. TARIFFS' REVENUE WAS 30 BILLION USD AND SCOTT BESSENT EXPECTS REVENUE TO EXCEED 1% OF GDP, 30 BILLION USD THIS YEAR, SO THE BOTTOM LINE LOOKS BETTER. BUT LONG END YIELDS CREEP HIGHER, MAYBE IT IS WORRIES ABOUT INFLATION AFTER THE HOT PPI PRINT OR BOOSTED EXPECTATIONS OF GROWTH, TRADING OFF GROWTH AND THE DEFICIT. A BETTER BACKDROP. TOM: UK TRADERS BET THE BOE WILL HOLD RATES FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR. THEY DID BET ON A CUT, BUT NOW IT'S 50/50, WHY? VAL: THE GDP WAS BETTER AND WE HAVE UK CPI AND THE BACK END OF GILTS SAY GROWTH BOOSTS YIELDS AND YES, THAT MEANS HIGHER YIELDS AND REDUCES HEADROOM AND THE UK IS TRADING AT HIGHS SURPASSING LIZ TRUSS' HIGHS. 25% OF THEIR DEBT PILE IS IN INFLATION LINKED BONDS, SO FINANCING COSTS RISES AND COMPLICATES THIS DOOM LOOP. TOM: WOW, THAT IS CHUNKY, INNIT? VALERIE TYTEL WITH THE DETAILS, THANK YOU. GET A ROUNDUP IN DAYBREAK ON THE TERMINAL, OF COURSE FOR THE DETAILS AND FALLOUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE MEETING YESTERDAY WITH EU LEADERS, ZELENSKYY AND TRUMP REPORTED. COMING UP, END TO THE WAR IN UKRAINE SEEING ADDITIONAL GAS ON THE MARKET? CAN MORE BE DONE? EU GAS MARKETS IN FOCUS, COMING UP. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a \u266a > > WE NEED TO STOP THIS WAR, TO STOP RUSSIA AND WE NEED SUPPORT. TRUMP: WE WILL HAVE A TRILATERAL. > > A COALITION OF 30 COUNTRIES WILL WORK WITH THE U.S. TOM: ZELENSKYY, TRUMP AND STARMER. EU NATURAL GAS PRICES FELL TO A FRESH LOW. WE ARE NOT THERE, BUT AGREEMENT TO END THE WAR COULD EASE SUPPLY. LET'S GET MORE WITH ISABELLA. WHAT'S BEHIND THE PRICE FALL? NO ADDITIONAL RUSSIAN GAS, BUT THEY HAVE FALLEN. PRISCILLA: THERE WILL BE MORE RUSSIAN GAS IN THE GLOBAL MARKET. THAT MEANS SINCE RUSSIA'S INVASION OF UKRAINE, EU HAS RELIED ON GLOBAL MARKET, COMPETING WITH OTHER COUNTRIES FOR CARGOS. WITH RUSSIAN GAS, THERE WILL BE LESS COMPETITION. WHY? URSULA SAID THE EU WILL PROGRESS WITH SANCTIONS AND THE EU AGREED TO BUY U.S. ENERGY, SO IT IS NOT LOOKING LIKE RUSSIAN GAS WILL COME TO EUROPE. TOM: OKAY, SO NO RUSSIAN GAS, BUT IF THERE WAS A PEACE DEAL, WHAT -- WHAT KIND OF TIMEFRAME ARE TRADERS THINKING ABOUT FOR RUSSIAN GAS ON THE GLOBAL MARKET? > > LET'S SAY IF THERE IS AN AGREEMENT, IF AND WHEN, THERE IS EXPECTATIONS THE U.S. COULD LIFT SANCTIONS ON SIBERIA, WHICH WA S SANCTIONED BY BIDEN. IF THEY ARE LIFTED THOSE VESSELS ARE READY TO GO, SO WE COULD SEE MORE LNG IF THEY ARE LIFTED. IN THE PIPELINE, SUPPLY WILL BE COMPLICATED. THERE WAS THE END OF AN AGREEMENT AND THE PIPELINE IS CLOSED. THEY COULD RETURN IF THEY AGREE WITH UKRAINE. BUT LNG WILL MATTER MORE BECAUSE CARGOS CAN MOVE TO MEET DEMAND, WHILE PIPELINES ARE RESTRICTED. TOM: OKAY, EU ENERGY REPORTER PRISCILLIA ON RUSSIA GAS. INTEL SHARES SOAR AFTER SOFTBANK BUYS A STAKE, THAT STORY NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a \u266a TOM: WELCOME BACK. SOFTBANK AGREED TO BUY $2 MILLION OF INTEL STOCK TO SHORE UP THE CHIPMAKER AND BLOOMBERG LEARNED TRUMP MAY TAKE A STAKE OF ABOUT 10%. LET'S GET MORE WITH ANNABELLE DROULERS STANDING BY. WHAT IS THE MOTIVE? ANNABELLE: THAT IS UNCLEAR, BOTH COMPANIES ECHOED THE STRENGTH OF EACH OF THEM BUT TIMING IS INTERESTING WITH THE MEETING WITH TRUMP AND WHETHER THIS IS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED, QUESTIONS IN SHARE PRICE WITH SOMETHING PRESSURE. WE SAW THEM CLOSING DOWN MORE THAN 4% AND SOFTBANK IS LOOKING AT A $2 BILLION INTEL INVESTMENT AND A SMALL DISCOUNT ESSENTIALLY BUILDS INVESTMENT INTO THE AI STORY, SOFTBANK IS A LACQUERED BUT SOME STOCKS INCLUDE NVIDIA AND TSMC AND PROJECT STARGATE. TOM: THIS HAD BEEN REPORTED LAST WEEK AND NOW WE HAVE DETAILS OF 10%, WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE THINKING OF TRUMP'S POSITION AROUND INTEL? ANNABELLE: THIS IS INTERESTING. THEY WERE FACING PRESSURE BUT THEN TRUMP REVERSED HIS THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE UNDERSTAND, THOSE FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER THINK THAT INTEL WAS SET TO RECEIVE FUND CONVERTED INTO A NEAR 10% STAKE FROM TRUMP AND IT COULD CHANGE BUT YOU DO HAVE THE U.S. SHORING UP THAT ON SHORING AND BRINGING BACK THAT PRESENTS TO THE U.S.. TOM: OK, ANNABELLE, THANK YOU FOR THE LATEST. U.S. GOVERNMENT LOOKING TO TAKE 10%. ENJOYED ANNABELLE AND SHERY AHN FOR BLOOMBERG TECH ASIA ON FRIDAY, LOOKING AT HUMANOID ROBOTS. BLOOMBERG UNDERSTANDS SHEIN MAY MOVE TO CHINA. THEY ARE DOMICILED IN SINGAPORE BUT CONSULTED LAWYERS ABOUT A PARENT COMPANY IN BEIJING TO SWAY CHINESE AUTHORITIES TO SIGN OFF ON THE HONG KONG LISTING. THEY ARE RUNNING OUT OF PLACES TO FLOAT AFTER FAILING TO GET NEW YORK AND LONDON APPROVAL. COMING UP, TRUMP'S ONE-ON-ONE MEETING BETWEEN VLADIMIR PUTIN AND ZELENSKYY, WE DISCUSSED WITH HANNAH FROM THE THINK TANK UKRAINIAN PRAISE THEM. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a TOM: GOOD MORNING THIS IS BLOOMBERG DAYBREAK: EUROPE. I'M TOM MACKENZIE IN LONDON. THESE OF THE STORIES THAT SET YOUR AGENDA. TABLE FOR THREE. DONALD TRUMP PUSHES FOR A TRILATERAL MEETING WITH UKRAINE AND RUSSIA WITH THE U.S. AND HIS ALLIES NOW PROMISING FUTURE SECURITY GUARANTEES FOR KYIV. EUROPEAN FUTURES TICK CAIRO WITH GLOBAL STOCKS CLOSE TO RECORD HIGHS. HOLDING STEADY AFTER S & P CONFIRMS ITS LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING FOR THE U.S. CITING HIGHER TARIFF REVENUES. INTEL SOARS ON NEWS OF THE $2 BILLION INVESTMENT BY SOFTBANK. BLOOMBERG LEARNS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS CONSIDERING TAKING A 10% STAKE IN THE CHIPMAKER. TO THE MARKETS, EUROPEAN STOCKS MODEST GAINS OF ABOUT .10% BY THE CLOSE LOOKING TO BUILD ON THAT TODAY JUST BUY A 1.0 -- .10. EQUITIES AS THEY LOOK FOR THE NEXT MAJOR CATALYST. IT WAS FROM THAT MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE. POSSIBLY IT WILL BE JAY POWELL. WE KNOW THE FOCUS IS THERE PURE WITH THAT SPEECH ON FRIDAY AT JACKSON HOLE. S & P FUTURES AFTER CLOSING FLIGHT YESTERDAY POINTING A LITTLE LOWER DOWN .3%. NASDAQ 100 FUTURES LOOKING TO DROP .2 PERCENT. LOSING 55 POINT SO FAR IN A SESSION. AS YOU LOOK AT THE FUTURES PICTURE FOR THE NASDAQ 100. LOOKS ACROSS ASSET. SELLING ACROSS U.S. TREASURIES IN THE LAST FEW DAYS. THAT'S MODERATED TODAY. STABILITY ACROSS U.S. TREASURIES IN SESSION THIS TUESDAY. 433 ON THE BENCHMARK U.S. 10 YEAR. EURO-DOLLAR AT 116. THE SINGLE CURRENCY TRADING FIRST IS THE U.S. DOLLAR IN CHANGE. A LITTLE BIT OF WEAKNESS FOR THE OIL PRICES ON THE BACK OF THOSE MEETINGS AT THE WHITE HOUSE BETWEEN THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT AND HIS U.S. COUNTERPART. EUROPEAN LEADERS DOWN. BRENT DOWN .7% AND GO HIGHER UP .2%. UBS SEES HIGHER PRICES FOR GOLD WITH A VIEW THAT YOU COULD GET TO AROUND 3700 BY JUNE OF NEXT YEAR. PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE HAS CALLED VLADIMIR PUTIN TO URGE HIM TO BEGIN MAKING PLANS FOR A SUMMIT WITH VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY. BECAUSE AFTER HIS MEETING WITH THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT AND SEVERAL EUROPEAN LEADERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE ON MONDAY. U.S. SEC. OF STATE MARCO RUBIO SAYS WASHINGTON IS WORKING ON SECURITY GUARANTEES FOR KYIV. > > UKRAINE POST-CONFLICT HAS A RIGHT TO ENTER INTO SECURITY AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. WE WILL WORK WITH OUR EUROPEAN ALLIES AND NON-EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO BUILD A SECURITY GUARANTEE. WE ARE WORKING ON THAT NOW. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT. THAT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE IN PLACE AFTER A PEACE DEAL SO THAT UKRAINE CAN FEEL SAFE MOVING FORWARD. TOM: LET'S BRING IN BLOOMBERG'S OLIVER CROOK IN BRUSSELS WAS FOLLOWING ALL OF THIS FOREST YESTERDAY. WE WERE HEARING FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE TALKING ABOUT THOSE SECURITY GUARANTEES. THAT DID SEEM TO BE ONE OF THE CLEAR TAKEAWAYS FROM THE MEETINGS AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THERE WOULD BE A SECURITY GUARANTEE FOR KYIV, FOR UKRAINE. THE QUESTION IS WHAT FORM THAT TAKES, WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. ALL: THERE ARE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS ARTICLE FIVE STYLE SECURITY GUARANTEE THAT THE UNITED STATES WAS TALKING ABOUT OVER THE WEEKEND WITH THE MEETING WITH TRUMP. THE FIRST POINT TO MAKE IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT THE UNITED STATES SEEMS TO SUGGEST CAME OUT OF THE BOOT AND-TRUMP MEETING. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE UNILATERALLY APPLIED BY THE UNITED STATES. POTENTIALLY ITSELF WILL TO GET IT BECAUSE IT MEANS THE RUSSIANS HAVE COME TO AN AGREEMENT BUT IT'S SOMETHING UNITED STATES COULD HAVE COMMITTED TO IN THE PAST. REGARDLESS OF THAT FACT -- FACT, I THINK EUROPEAN LEADERS WILL LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE REASSURED BY THE FACT THAT TRUMP HAS NOT TALKED ABOUT TERRITORIAL CONCESSIONS WITHOUT UKRAINE AS THE MAIN DECIDER. SECONDLY, IT SEEMS A REAL COMMITMENT TO BEING A PART OF THE SECURITY ARCHITECTURE IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER POST PEACE DEAL. YOU STILL NEED TO GET TO THE PEACE DEAL. THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES THERE. CASTING OUR DAYS FORWARD, THEY WILL BE PLEASED TO HAVE GOTTEN THE REASSURANCES FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE IS AMBIGUITY ABOUT WHAT THE MEANS. DOES IT MEAN THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN DEFENDING MILITARILY UKRAINE IF THERE WERE ANOTHER INVASION, ANOTHER INCURSION ON SOVEREIGNTY BY RUSSIA AFTER A PEACE DEAL? DOES IT MEAN THERE WILL BE EUROPEAN TROOPS STATIONED WITHIN UKRAINE? THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WHEN WE CAST OUR MINDS FORWARD ALL OF THESE EUROPEAN LEADERS HAVE COME TO THE TABLE UNIFIED IN THEIR APPROACH WITH DONALD TRUMP. THEY STILL NEED TO SELL THIS AT HOME. I'M GIVING YOU THE EXAMPLE OF FREDERICK MIRSKY IN GERMANY. I SPOKE WITH GERMAN POLITICIANS ABOUT THIS IDEA OF POTENTIALLY DEPLOYING GERMAN TROOPS AS PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS WITHIN UKRAINE. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT HAS GREAT TRACTION EVEN IN MAINSTREAM GERMAN POLITICS TO SAY NOTHING OF THE FACT THAT THE AFD, THE FAR RIGHT WITHIN GERMANY HAS OVERTAKEN THE CDU IN POPULARITY IN RECENT POLLING AND THEY ARE OPPOSED TO THESE THINGS. THERE'S ALSO A DOMESTIC AUDIENCE TO SELL THIS CONVERSATION TO ON THE EUROPEAN SIDE. THAT BEING SAID, THIS IS A FAR CRY FROM THE DISASTROUS MEETING YOU SAW SIX MONTHS AGO AS WE ALSO SAW OUR ZELENSKY WAS WEARING HIS BLACK SUIT AND THEY JOKED ABOUT THAT IN THE OVAL OFFICE. IN A MORE POSITIVE CONVERSATION THAT OCCURRED BETWEEN TRUMP SIX MONTHS AGO AND I THINK CONSTRUCTIVE. THAT BEING SAID THERE ARE OPEN QUESTIONS THAT WILL HAVE TO BE CAST FORWARD TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THERE WILL BE A TRILATERAL MEETING WHICH ALL THE EUROPEAN LEADERS HAVE BEEN PUSHING FOR. TOM: OLIVER CROOK ON THE GROUND IN BRUSSELS WITH THE LATEST. LET'S GET MORE NOW AND BRING IN SECURITY STUDIES PROGRAM DIRECTOR AT THE THINK TANK UKRAINIAN PRISM. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. GIVEN WHAT YOU SAW AND HEARD YESTERDAY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE IN THESE MEETINGS, DO YOU ASSESS NOW THAT UKRAINE POTENTIALLY IS A STEP CLOSER TO SOME KIND OF DEAL WITH RUSSIA? > > THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT WE CAN'T BE CLOSER TO THE DEAL BECAUSE ARE WE CLOSER TO THE PEACE AND THAT IS THE MAIN QUESTION THAT ALL UKRAINIANS ARE ASKING. WASHINGTON MEETING WENT BETTER THAN EVERYBODY EXPECTED. AT LEAST THE FIRST IMPRESSION THAT THERE WAS LESS PRESSURE THAN EXPECTED FOR THE PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY AND PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN AFTER THE MEETING WITH A MUCH BETTER MOOD, IF YOU COMPARE THE PICTURES FROM THE WHITE HOUSE YESTERDAY AND FROM ALASKA A FEW DAYS AGO, HE WAS DEFINITELY DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT. BUT IS IT JUST THE MOOD OF THE FIRST EMOTIONS OR DOES IT MEAN ALSO THAT WE HAVE A SET OF SUBSTANCE AND AGREEMENT BETWEEN UKRAINE AND OUR EUROPEAN ALLIES IN THE UNITED STATES? DOES THE OPEN QUESTION? TOM: ON THE QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE WHEN IT COMES TO SECURITY GUARANTEE FROM THE U.S. AND EUROPEAN ALLIES, WHAT IS THE MINIMUM THAT THE U.S. WOULD NEED TO PROVIDE IN TERMS OF THAT SECURITY GUARANTEED TO REASSURE AND SATISFY? QUAKES UKRAINE ALREADY HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE WITH WHAT WE CONSIDERED AS GUARANTEES BECAUSE IN 1994, UKRAINE REJECTED THE THIRD IN THE WORLD ARSENAL OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS WHERE EXACTLY THAT BUDAPEST MEMORANDUM IT WAS STATED THE SECURITY ASSURANCES FROM UKRAINE AND THEN LATE IN 2003 AND 2014 THE U.S. SAID SORRY, THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES, THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES, THEY ARE JUST ASSURANCES. EVEN IN THE RUSSIAN AND UKRAINIAN LANGUAGE IT WAS TRANSLATED AS GUARANTEES AND IN THAT MEMORANDUM THERE WAS PROMISES ABOUT UKRAINE NOT ATTACKING UKRAINE AND HELPING UKRAINE IN CASE IT IS NECESSARY. SO NOW UKRAINE HAVING THAT EXPERIENCE OF 1994 IS MUCH MORE CAREFUL ABOUT ANY TYPE OF THE GUARANTEES THAT ARE BROUGHT. THAT THEY SHOULD BE BINDING. NOT JUST LEGALLY BINDING, BUT TO BE SURE THAT THE POLITICAL WILL WILL NOT PREVENT NOT ONLY THE U.S. PRESIDENT BUT DEPENDING ON WHO WILL JOIN ME AS GUARANTEES TO IMPLEMENT THAT. BECAUSE AFTER THE LATEST EVENTS THE LAST YEAR, IN MANY COUNTRIES WHERE THERE HAD BEEN GUARANTEES LIKE SOUTH KOREA, ISRAEL, JAPAN I HEARD FROM MANY EXPERTS AND POLITICIANS CAN WE REALLY NOW JUST THE U.S. GUARANTEES IF THE POLITICAL WILL CAN CHANGE ANY TYPE OF THE SUPPORT OR PROMISES THAT THEY MADE BEFORE. THAT'S WHAT UKRAINE FEARS AS WELL. TOM: THAT'S AN IMPORTANT HISTORICAL CONTEXT IN TERMS OF WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. IN TERMS OF THOSE POTENTIAL SECURITY GUARANTEES TAKING AN EYE BACK TO 1990 FOUR. WHEN IT COMES TO TERRITORY, IS IT FAIR TO ASSUME THAT THE PRESIDENT -- THAT THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT WILL HAVE TO CONCEDE THAT SOME TERRITORY WILL REMAIN IN RUSSIAN HANDS, DOMESTICALLY, POLITICALLY WHAT IS ZELENSKY ABLE TO DO IN TERMS OF THAT QUESTION? HOW FAR IS HE ABLE TO GO IN TERMS OF EXCEPTING THAT SOME TERRITORY WILL NEED TO REMAIN IN RUSSIAN HANDS? QUAKES WE SAY THAT THE CHANGE OF THIS IN UKRAINE IS ENFORCEABLE WITHOUT ONLY CHANGE OF THE CONSTITUTION, WHAT IS ALREADY A VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS ACCORDING TO OUR CONSTITUTION THAT SHOULD GO THROUGH THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT WITH THE TWO HEARINGS IN THE PARLIAMENT SO HE COULD TAKE ONE AND A HALF YEARS AT LEAST. BUT WITHOUT REFERENDUM IT'S CLEARLY STATED IN THE CONSTITUTION IS FOR NOW AND WE SEE THAT THERE IS NO SUPPORT IN UKRAINE AMONG THE POPULATION FOR THE CHANGES FOR THE INTEGRITY OF UKRAINE. WE ARE NOT SPEAKING ABOUT THE TERRITORY. WE ARE SPEAKING ABOUT UKRAINIAN PEOPLE. THERE IS NO RUSSIAN TERRITORIES. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN UKRAINIAN. BY THE WAY IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE BRITISH, NOT EVEN BY THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE. SO IN THIS WAY, THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT WITH ZELENSKY TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT PROMISES, BUT ALSO, LET'S REMEMBER WE HAVE LEGAL CHANGES AND WE HAVE X-ACTO'S THAT THE CERTAIN TERRITORIES ARE REMAINING UNDER THE RUSSIAN TERRITORIES. PROBABLY WHAT THEY COULD DISCUSS YESTERDAY IT IS THE SECOND VARIANT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT SOME OF THESE TERRITORIES WOULD REMAIN UNDER THE RUSSIAN CONTROL. BUT THEN THERE WOULD BE ALL THE QUESTIONS TO THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION THAT THEY NEED TO PROVIDE HUMAN RIGHTS WITH UKRAINIANS LIVING IN THESE TERRITORIES. AND IF WE TAKE CRIMEA, RUSSIA HAS CLOSED ALL UKRAINIAN SCHOOLS AND CHURCHES. IF YOU GO TO THEM, JUST FOR A HAVING YOUR TELEPHONE, STUDENTS CAN BE ARRESTED. IN WEEKLY SEARCHES AT THE EDUCATIONAL SECURITY'S. EVEN THE UKRAINIAN KEYBOARD AND THEIR TELEPHONES. THAT'S WHY UKRAINIANS WOULD NOT AGREE TO ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN RUSSIA WOULD CONTROL OVER HERE BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT WOULD BE A VERY STRONG SUPPRESSION OF THE UKRAINIAN POPULATION. TOM: SECURITY STUDIES PROGRAM DIRECTOR AT THE THINK TANK YOU CARE -- UKRAINIAN PRISM ON THE CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF MOVING THE NEEDLE ON THESE CONVERSATIONS IN THE TAKE ON WHAT WE SAW AT THE WHITE HOUSE YESTERDAY. THANK YOU. DANG ON GEOPOLITICS, SHIFTING TO INDIA-CHINA RELATIONS. NARENDRA MODI HAS HELD RUSSIAN LEADER VLADIMIR PUTIN -- IT DOES TIE INTO CHINA, AS A FRIEND AND DISCUSS BILATERAL COOPERATION WITH THEM IN A PHONE CALL. THE CALL COMES AS THE GOVERNMENT USED TO BOLSTER RELATIONSHIP. THEY ARE DUE TO MEET WITH CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTER TODAY HAS BOTH NATIONS NATION'S PUSH TO NORMALIZE RELATIONS AMID DIPLOMATIC TENSIONS WITH THE U.S. QUAKES TO LET THEM CONSOLIDATE THE MOMENT OF THE CHINA-INDIA RELATIONS. WE ARE PURSUING OUR RELATION WE COULD CONTINUE EACH OTHER'S SUCCESS. QUAKES RELATIONSHIP YOUR EXCELLENCY. QUAKES OUR TWO NATIONS NOW SEEK TO MOVE AHEAD. THIS REQUIRES A CANDID AND CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH FROM BOTH SIDES. TOM: LET'S BRING IN BLOOMBERG GOVERNMENT REPORTER IN NEW DELHI. WHAT COULD WE EXPECT FROM THE MEETING WITH NARENDRA MODI LATER TODAY? QUAKES WE ARE NOT EXPECTING MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENTS BUT IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THIS MEETING IS GOING TO SET UP THE BILATERAL MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT XI JINGPING AND PRIME MINISTER MODI LATER IN THE MONTH. AND THIS ALSO SHOWS IN A WAY HOW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDIA AND CHINA FROM A COMPLETE FREEZE AND A VERY BAD ACRIMONIOUS RELATIONSHIP IS TURNING THE OTHER WAY AROUND. THE CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTER YESTERDAY MET WITH THE INDIAN FOREIGN MINISTER. HE IS NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR. IT SEEMS TO BE GOING ON IN A VERY POSITIVE MODE. SO ALL IN ALL, WHAT WE CAN EXPECT IS A GRADUAL BUT A DEFINITIVE CALL AND WARMING OF RELATIONS BETWEEN INDIA AND CHINA. TOM: A THOUGHT -- A THAW AND WARMING OF RELATIONS. WE LOOK AHEAD TO THAT BETWEEN THE INDIAN PRIME MINISTER IN THE FOREIGN MINISTER OF CHINA. BLOOMBERG GOVERNMENT REPORTER, THANK YOU ON THE DETAILS ON THE CONTEXT AROUND THAT IN LIGHT OF THE PRESSURE THAT BOTH COUNTRIES ARE COMING UNDER FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THAT ADMINISTRATION. WE WILL SWITCH FOCUS INTO NEW HUMANOID ROBOT BUILT TO TACKLE INDUSTRIAL LABOR GAPS HEAD-ON. WE WILL SPEAK TO THE COMPANY BEHIND THE ROBOTS. THAT IS COMING UP NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a TOM: WELCOME BACK TO BLOOMBERG DAYBREAK: EUROPE. HUMANOID ROBOTS BECAUSE THEY HAVE RELEASED THEIR NEW HUMANOID BOT. THE TECH COMPANY SAYS IT IS BUILT TO TACKLE LABOR SHORTAGES USING AI DRIVEN MISSION CONTROL. THEY HOPE THEY WILL BE USED ACROSS MULTIPLE SECTORS INCLUDING TRANSPORTATION, MANUFACTURING AND LOGISTICS. BECAUSE AS ELON MUSK DOUBLES DOWN ON TESLA'S AMBITIOUS BET ON ROBOTICS WITH THE COMPANY'S UPCOMING OPTIMIST THREE MODEL. JOINING ME NOW IS THE PRESIDENT OF HEXAGONS ROBOTICS DIVISION. GOOD MORNING. TALK TO US ABOUT WHAT ARE ITS CAPABILITIES AND WHAT ARE THE GAPS THAT IT MAY BE ABLE TO FILL FOR SOME OF YOUR CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS. QUAKES THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME AND GOOD MORNING. IT IS REALLY A HUMAN ROBOT BUILT SPECIFICALLY FOR INDUSTRIAL USE CASES, AS YOU MENTIONED IN THE ONE OF THE KEY THINGS IS AUTONOMY. SO WHAT CAN DO PART OBJECT MANIPULATION REFERRED TO AS TAKEN PLACE AND SORTING. IT COULD DO MACHINE TENDING HAVE PARTS OF THE CERTAIN MACHINE IN THE LINE. IT CAN ALSO DO AN INSPECTION OF EITHER THE SPACE IT WORKS IN OR THE PARTS IT DEALS WITH. IT CAN DO REALITY CAPTION, SO THE DIGITAL TWINNING OF YOUR ENVIRONMENT. IT COULD DO OPERATION. ONE OF THE KEY DIFFERENTIATING FACTORS WE HAVE IS WE USE A LOT OF AI BUT FUNDAMENTALLY IT'S A VERY SOPHISTICATED SENSOR SCREEN SO WE HAVE OVER 22 SENSORS IN THE ROBOT THAT ENABLES ALL THE USE CASES THAT I JUST MENTIONED. TOM: AND HE PARTNERED WITH NVIDIA. YOU'VE WORKED CLOSELY WITH NVIDIA THE MAKER OF THOSE AI ACCELERATORS AND OTHER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ON THIS PROJECT. WHAT IS THE BIGGEST ROADBLOCK TO ROLLING THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY OUT, IS IT THE HARDWARE OR THE SOFTWARE, IS THE AI? QUAKES IT'S A BIT OF BOTH. IN TERMS OF DEXTERITY THINK OF REPLICATING HUMAN MOVEMENTS WITH AGILITY. WE STILL HAVE A BIT OF CHALLENGES WITH THE ACTUATORS, THE MOTORS THE ROBOT USES. THE SECOND ON AI IS REALLY HOW YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE CHANGING ENVIRONMENT IN COMPLETING THIS SAME TASK WITH THE ENVIRONMENT CHANGING, WHICH IS A LOT OF AI BEHIND IT, AS YOU MENTION. SO THINGS THAT ARE VERY SIMPLE FOR US AS HUMANS, A SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF PUTTING A NAIL IN THE WALL. HAMMERS ON THE LEFT ON THE RIGHT AND THEN ABLEISM -- THE NAIL IS ON THE TABLE AND NOT ON THE TABLE. WE FIGURE IT OUT IN SECONDS THAT WE NEED THE HUMANOID TO DO THE SAME AND THAT'S ALL THROUGH SPATIAL INTELLIGENCE AND ALSO SEMANTIC INTELLIGENCE. TOM: WHAT KIND OF DEMAND ARE YOU SEEING FOR THESE ROBOTS? OUR ORDERS BEING PLACED ALREADY, ARE YOU GETTING CUSTOMERS LINING UP TO BUY THESE THINGS WERE IS THERE A BIT OF CAUTION AND SKEPTICISM STILL AMONGST POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS? QUAKES I THINK THIS SKEPTICISM IS MOSTLY BEHIND US, TO BE HONEST. WE'VE ANNOUNCED IN JUNE 2 PILOT CUSTOMERS. VERY PROUD OF THOSE PARTNERSHIPS. WE ANNOUNCED A FEW MORE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS. I THINK WE ARE SEEING DEMAND PICKUP QUITE WELL. FRANKLY, AS YOU MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEGMENT, THE LATER -- LABOR SHORTAGE HAS BECOME VERY REAL IN THE U.S. AND IN EUROPE, SO WE NEED THOSE HUMANOIDS TO COME TAKE PART IN THE FACTORIES. TOM: WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST BARRIERS TO ADOPTION AT THIS POINT? QUAKES I WOULD SAY BIG BARRIERS OF ADOPTION, AS I MENTIONED, IS THE PRECISION OF SOME OF THE MOVEMENTS. YOU COULD IMAGINE THE FOUNDRY LINE IS VERY PRECISE. THIS SECOND ONE IS THAT THE HUMAN IMMUNITY OPERATES FULLY AT THOMAS LEE AND THE ENVIRONMENT. SO MOST OF THE HUMAN DEPLOYMENTS ARE WITHIN CONSTRAINED ENVIRONMENTS AND WE NEED THAT TO BE IN AN OPEN FACTORY. THERE'S A LOT OF SAFETY CONCERNS THAT WE ARE OBVIOUSLY ADDRESSING. THE LAST ONE IS THE MULTIPURPOSE SIDE OF IT. THAT'S THE MAIN ADVANTAGE OF A HUMANOID OVER MANY FORMS OF ROBOTS CURRENTLY USED IN FACTORIES IS THAT THEY CAN DO MANY THINGS THROUGH AI LEARNING. SO WE NEED THAT RANGE TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND WITH CUSTOMER NEEDS, AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH 20 CUSTOMERS AT THE MOMENT. TWO PILOTS. 18 THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE MULTI-IS REALLY MEAN. TOM: PRESUMABLY IF YOU ARE A FACTORY WORKER YOU SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS TECHNOLOGY. > > WE HEAR THAT QUITE A BIT. OUR GOAL IS TO COMPLEMENT THE WORKFORCE. THERE ARE TWO MAIN DRIVING FACTORS. ONE IS LABOR CHALLENGES, AS I MENTIONED BEFORE. ALSO SAFETY CONCERNS. TASKS IN THE FACTORIES ARE REPETITIVE AND TEDIOUS. SO WE ARE TRYING TO TACKLE THIS. AND IT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE WHERE THE WHOLE STRUCTURE OF THE HUMANOID WOULD BE TO COMPLEMENT THE WORKFORCE AND ALLOW THE WORKERS THAT ARE THE SPECIALIST, EFFECTIVELY IN THOSE LINES, TO REALLY MOVE TOWARDS HIGHER VALUE WORK, SOLVING TRUE ENGINEERING PROBLEMS, OPTIMIZATION, THINGS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TIME TO DO TODAY AND SO ON. SO WE REALLY FEEL STRONGLY THAT THE HUMANOIDS WILL COMPLEMENT THE WORKFORCE BOTH FOR NECESSITY, LABOR SHORTAGE, BUT ALSO ALLOWING THEM TO WORK ON HIGHER VALUE WORK. TOM: PRESIDENT OF HEXAGONS ROBOTICS DIVISION ON THE RELEASE OF WHAT IT COULD MEAN FOR FUTURE WORK AND FOR ENTERPRISES ADOPTING HUMANOID ROBOTS. THANK YOU. AND ONE EARNING STORY TO BRING YOU THIS MORNING, FULL YEAR UNDERLYING PROFIT OF BHP HAS FALLEN BY MORE THAN A QUARTER. THE RESULTS FROM THE LARGEST MINOR WERE BROUGHT IN LINE WITH MARKET EXPECTATIONS AND CAME AS PRICES OF BHP'S KEY EARNERS, IRON ORE AND COKING COAL CAME UNDER PRESSURE FROM SOFT DEMAND FROM CHINA. TAKE A LISTEN. QUAKES EVERYBODY IS CHASING HIGHER STANDARDS OF LIVING. TO FEED THAT GROWTH, TO FEED THOSE HIGHER STANDARDS OF LIVING THE REALITY IS THE WORLD WILL NEED MORE OF THE COMMODITY -- COMMODITIES THAT BHP PRODUCES. MORE STILL NEEDED TO PRODUCE CITIES. MORE COPPER NOT ONLY TO ELECTRIFY THE WORLD BUT FOR DATA CENTERS. FOR AI. SO WE'VE TRIED TO ORIENT THE BHP OF PORTFOLIO TOWARDS THOSE COMMODITIES THAT THE WORLD IS GOING TO NEED MORE. TOM: PLENTY MORE IS COMING UP WE WILL GIVE YOU THE UPS FORECAST ON GOLD AND WHY TRADERS ARE FADING THOSE BETS ON BOE RATE CUTS. STAY WITH US. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a TOM: WELCOME BACK, THE RALLY THAT GOLD HAS HAD YEAR TO DATE HAS BEEN PRONOUNCED. WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN TERMS OF EQUITIES, 27 PERCENT YEAR-TO-DATE. UBS SAYS THERE'S FURTHER TO GO AS YOU LOOK AT IN JUNE OF 2026 THEY PROJECT OUT TO NEXT YEAR THEY ARE SETTING A TARGET OF 3000 $700 PER TROY OUNCE AND THEY SAY THAT WILL COME DOWN TO CUTS FROM THE FED, A WEAKER U.S. DOLLAR IN QUESTION MARKS ABOUT FED INDEPENDENCE. THE CALL FROM UBS. LET'S FLIP THE BOARD AND HAVE A LOOK, TALKING ABOUT CENTRAL BANKS THE BOE AND MONEY MARKETS PAIRING THEIR BETS IN TERMS OF THE BOE. NOT EXPECTING THE BANK OF ENGLAND TO GO AGAIN THIS YEAR. KEEPING RATES AT 4%. THAT IS THE EXPECTATION. A TURNAROUND FROM EARLIER THIS MONTH WHEN ANOTHER CUT OF 25 BASIS POINTS HAD BEEN PRICED IN. IT'S US IN 50%. THAT'S ON THE BACK OF STICKY INFLATION AND SLIGHTLY BETTER GROWTH. INFLATION DATA DROPPING TOMORROW WITH THE HEADLINE NUMBER EXPECTED TO SEE AN INCREASE OF 3.7%. WELL ABOVE THE BANK OF ENGLAND'S TARGET. BLOOMBERG TERMINAL USERS CAN ACCESS THESE CHARTS BY GOING TO GTV  ON THE BLOOMBERG TERMINAL. STAY WITH US, WE WILL SPEAK WITH THE SPANISH FOREIGN MINISTER. THAT'S AT 8 A.M. U.K. TIME. FOR MORE ON THE EUROPEAN RESPONSE THAT WE SAW YESTERDAY ON UKRAINE AND EUROPEAN DEFENSE, THE OPENING TRADE IS UP NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a",
