      "feedback": "The draft correctly uses a regime framework and anchors (balance, refinery utilization, sanctions risk) but must be reformatted into the exact SECTION FOCUS four-line Swing/Outlook structure and tightened for world-class clarity. Actionable edits: 1) reformat into exactly four lines, two Up and two Down, with the required fields: Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %, anchoring each probability to explicit evidence (e.g., J99EM2TPZ, T1QE6JPIX) and using precise bands (e.g., 40–60%, 25–45%, 20–40%); remove any 0–3 week content from the four-line block or relocate it as a catalysts note. 2) Choose a single dominant cause per line (Regime C shock; base-case balance near capacity; Regime A overhang; demand/sanctions dynamics) and ensure each line ends with a concrete invalidation trigger (e.g., credible de-escalation, unexpected demand revision, or sanctions shift) and a narrow “watch” item. 3) Tighten the probability distribution and reconcile conflicts by presenting a clear base case with guarded upside/downside bands tied to observed balance signals (12–24 month) and refinery utilization (e.g., 85.6 mbpd in 2025; 83.6–84.0 mbpd 2025–26) and price anchors (Brent mid-$60s; bands mid-$50s to mid-$70s) cited to the IDs. 4) Add a concise, first-principles causal map (oil balance -> capex/policy -> refinery throughput -> equity cash flow) and explicitly map each regime transition to the 12–24 month balance signals; 5) if SLB (or another tradable proxy) is used, supply a Swing Trade line with Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence, grounded in the material (cash-return framing, 65% signal; 19.5% annualized) and regime outcomes; otherwise provide a one-line Outlook (6–12 months) with Expected path and a single invalidation trigger. 6) Ensure all assertions use IDs only when asserting facts/numbers, avoid generic platitudes, and keep the watch-list to 2–3 concrete catalysts; 7) eliminate mixed content (policy commentary vs market lines) unless integrated as catalysts, and verify every fact against the source IDs to avoid conflicts.",
