  "title": "Trump admin stops illegal freeze of $5B EV charger funds after losing in court",
  "description": "The money is on the table again, but with fewer requirements for proving out safety, environmental impacts, and inclusion of minority- and women-owned businesses.",
  "content": "The Trump administration has finally issued new guidance that states can use to dole out $5 billion in funding for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, after spending months withholding the money.\n\nA coalition of states sued over the funding freeze in the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, which was one of the administration\u2019s many attempts to stop funding appropriated by Congress at the start of Donald Trump\u2019s second term. A judge ruled in June that those states were likely to succeed and issued an injunction against the administration\u2019s spending freeze.\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT), led by former MTV personality Sean Duffy, has criticized the states for taking too long to spend the money. As of May, around 84% of the $5 billion (authorized as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law) was still waiting to be obligated and only a few dozen chargers had been built.\n\nDuffy and the DOT also claimed the funding was only halted while a \u201creview process\u201d was performed to ensure the NEVI program aligned with the administration\u2019s priorities. A new press release issued Monday reveals what that entails.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the new guidance focuses on simplifying the review process for the charging stations. This means states will no longer have to consider consumer protections, emergency evacuation plans, environmental siting, and other previously required steps before construction can begin. The DOT has also removed requirements that a certain percentage of the charging stations be built in rural, underserved, or disadvantaged communities.\n\nThe DOT further removed language from the guidance requiring that proposals for the funding \u201cdemonstrate how the implementation will promote strong labor, safety training, and installation standards.\u201d And the DOT struck language that required applicants to provide opportunities for minority- and women-owned small businesses to become involved.",

      "text": "A US district judge has blocked the Trump administration from withholding funds previously awarded to 14 states for electric vehicle charger infrastructure.\nSeattle-based judge Tana Lin, who was appointed to the bench by Joe Biden in 2021, granted a partial injunction to the states that filed suit against Trump\u2019s Department of Transportation.\nShe ruled that the states\u2019 lawsuit \u2013 led by attorneys general in California, Colorado and Washington \u2013 would likely succeed. Her ruling did not apply to the District of Columbia, Minnesota and Vermont, which she found did not provide evidence that they would suffer immediate harm. The injunction will go into effect on 1 July, unless the Trump administration files an appeal blocking it.\nIn February, the Trump administration ordered states not to spend $5bn in funds allocated under the Biden administration as part of the national electric vehicle infrastructure (Nevi) program.\nThe program provided up to 80% of eligible project costs to deploy electric vehicle charges. Currently, 16 states have at least one operational EV station, according to EV States Clearinghouse.\n\u201cThe new leadership of the Department of Transportation \u2026 has decided to review the policies underlying the implementation of the Nevi formula program,\u201d Emily Biondi, associate administrator for planning, environment and realty at the transportation department\u2019s Federal Highway Administration, wrote in a memo.\n\u201cAs result of the rescission of the Nevi formula program guidance, the FHWA is also immediately suspending the approval of all state electric vehicle infrastructure deployment plans for all fiscal years. Therefore, effective immediately, no new obligations may occur under the Nevi formula program until the updated final Nevi formula program guidance is issued and new state plans are submitted and approved,\u201d she added.\nIn May, the Government Accountability Office found that the Trump administration violated the law when it withheld the funding. The administration \u201cmust continue to carry out the statutory requirements of the program\u201d, it said.\nThe White House challenged those findings, which it called \u201cwrong and legally indefensible\u201d, and ordered the transportation department to ignore them. The department is expected to release a draft of its updated electric vehicle guidance this month.\nDuring a hearing before the Seattle judge earlier this month, Leah Brown, of Washington\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office said, \u201cThis passing reference to revised guidance and to changed priorities is simply insufficient to override congressional intent.\u201d She added that the states aren\u2019t \u201cchallenging the ability to revise guidance, but we are arguing that doing so simply is not a sufficient explanation for the actions that they\u2019ve taken,\u201d the Washington State Standard reported.\n\u201cThe agency has no intent to withhold funds from the states,\u201d justice department attorney Heidy Gonzalez said. \u201cIt just wants the opportunity to review past guidance and to promulgate guidance that comports with the current administration\u2019s policies and priorities.\u201d\nDuring his campaign for the presidency, Donald Trump voiced a hatred for electric vehicles that ran counter to his growing friendship with Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\nAt one point in the campaign, Trump said supporters of the vehicles should \u201crot in hell\u201d and that Biden\u2019s support of EVs would bring a \u201cbloodbath\u201d to the US\u2019s automotive industry.\nAlthough he later appointed Musk to serve as head of the \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d, Musk and Trump have since parted ways."

But I pushed myself to go to an English-speaking university, and that opened up a door. Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead? Whenever I interview people, I ask about those key moments in somebody\u2019s life where they\u2019ve made career decisions. And I think about companies in the same way\u2014there are these crucible moments that have an enormous bearing on ultimate outcomes.\nRoelof's Sessions\nWhat Sequoia Sees Coming Next\nAs one of the most influential VCs of the modern era, Roelof Botha has seen it all; booms, busts, and billion-dollar breakout bets.
