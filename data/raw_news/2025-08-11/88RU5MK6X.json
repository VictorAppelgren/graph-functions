  "description": "Netflix star Malin Ackerman compared her politician's wife character to Melania Trump and high-society games in an interview about her hit show \"The Hunter Wives.\"",
  "content": "Actress Malin Ackerman said in an interview last week that her new Netflix show \"The Hunter Wives\" used first lady Melania Trump as a main reference point for her role where she plays a manipulative, affair-having politician\u2019s wife.During an interview with pop culture outlet Vulture, the actress claimed the creative team behind Netflix\u2019s pulpy show told her to think of Trump when playing Texas housewife, Margo, whose character is the wife of a rich wannabe politician and has a sordid past that includes murder, adultery and abortion.\"During filming, she says, the series\u2019 creative team described Margo as a bit like Melania Trump, someone who \u2018came into a marriage to this rich man as one woman,\u2019 then finds the expectations for her have shifted once he becomes politically ambitious,\" the outlet stated.TRUMP ACTIVATES NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS TO ADDRESS \u2018TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL\u2019 CRIME IN WASHINGTON\"That was the only reference, really,\" Ackerman added.Her character's background comes to light during the show and includes a poor upbringing, sex work, and a series of affairs.\"But once her husband, Jed (Dermot Mulroney), decides to run for governor on a pro-gun, anti-abortion, happy-marriage platform, Margo realizes the increased public scrutiny could threaten everything she has built for herself, exposing elements of her life Jed\u2019s voters won\u2019t like,\" Vulture stated.Among the things she's hiding are \"the abortion she just had after her boyfriend, a high-school student, got her pregnant; the murder she committed to cover up that fling; and the affair she\u2019s currently having with new-to-town Sophie (Brittany Snow).\"TRUMP VOWS TO MAKE DC 'SAFER' AND 'BEAUTIFUL' AS CAPITAL BATTLES CRIME AND HOMELESSNESSAckerman mentioned that in addition to Trump, she tried to emulate her impression of \"high society\" types in her portrayal, a set of people she doesn\u2019t see as too genuine.\"Other than that, it\u2019s just high society. I\u2019ve mingled with aristocrats and high-society people and seen the games that go into it. For lack of a better word, I wouldn\u2019t say \u2018authenticity\u2019 is how those people lead,\" she told Vulture.The actress noted Margo\u2019s character is a \"survivor\" who acts out of necessity in everything she does to get ahead.CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTUREMelania Trump has often been a target of the media since her husband first ran for president in 2016. However, she hasn\u2019t taken harsh media treatment lying down.The first lady\u2019s lawyer last week forced Democratic strategist James Carville and the crew of his \"Politics War Room\" podcast to remove comments from a recent episode that suggested that Trump met her billionaire real estate mogul husband through a modeling agency connected to sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein.At the outset of the episode, Carville said, \"After the episode, we received a letter from Melania Trump's lawyer. He took issue with our title of one of those YouTube videos from that episode and a couple of comments I made about the first lady. We took a look at what they complained about, and we took down the video and edited out those comments from the episode. I also take back these statements and apologize.\"The White House did not immediately reply to Fox News Digital's request for comment.",

Before the tents, squalor, filth, and crime, it was the most beautiful Capital in the world.

The American Public is not going to put up with it any longer,\" Trump added.\nTrump wrote in a separate Truth Social post that he wants the homeless to \"immediately\" move \"far from\" the nation's capital. \"The criminals, you don\u2019t have to move out.

      "text": "President Donald Trump announced Monday that he is activating approximately 800 National Guard troops and is taking over the Metropolitan Police Department to tackle crime in Washington, after beefing up federal law enforcement presence in the nation's capital Saturday.\n\"I'm deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in Washington, DC,\" Trump told reporters at a Monday press conference. \"And they're going to be allowed to do their job properly.\"\nTrump also said that he would federalize the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington to respond to crime, placing it under the authority of Attorney General Pam Bondi.\nNational Guard troops are reserve forces that are mobilized in response to state and federal operations, including natural disasters, and are typically overseen by their respective state governments. However, Trump controversially deployed National Guard troops from California to respond to immigration riots in June, bypassing California Gov. Gavin Newsom to dispatch the troops.\nThe federal government oversees the District of Columbia National Guard.\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said that Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll will operationalize the D.C. National Guard, and signaled that more National Guard troops could be roped into the deployment down the line.\n\"You will see them flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week,\" Hegseth told reporters Monday. \"At your direction as well, sir, there are other units we are prepared to bring in. Other National Guard units, other specialized units. They will be strong, they will be tough, and they will stand with their law enforcement partners.\"\nTrump\u2019s remarks come just after he promised Washington would be \"LIBERATED\" from \"Crime, Savagery, Filth, and Scum\" in a post on Truth Social Monday morning. He said in the post that the \"days of ruthlessly killing, or hurting, innocent people, are OVER!\"\nTrump floated the idea of taking over Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department and utilizing National Guard troops to manage crime in Washington Wednesday, following the assault of a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer on Aug. 3 in Washington\u2019s Logan Circle.\nTRUMP THREATENS TO FEDERALIZE DC AFTER EX-DOGE EMPLOYEE 'BIG BALLS' VIOLENTLY BEATEN\n\"What a shame \u2013 rate of crime, the rate of muggings, killings and everything else, we\u2019re not going to let it, and that includes bringing in the National Guard, maybe very quickly, too,\" Trump told reporters Wednesday at the White House.\nTrump also told reporters at the time he was open to taking over Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department because crime in the nation\u2019s capital is \"ridiculous.\"\nWhile a temporary federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department is justified in cases of emergency, Trump's move will likely be challenged in court over whether the situation in Washington qualifies as an emergency.\nTrump has historically railed against violence in Washington, and said Tuesday that crime is \"totally out of control\" in the nation's capital.\nMeanwhile, crime in Washington is on the decline. Violent crime is down 26% this year, in comparison to the same timeframe in 2024, according to Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department. Likewise, assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 20%, and homicides are down by 12%.\nWATCH: TRUMP HINTS HE WILL FEDERALIZE DC SOON, BRING IN NATIONAL GUARD AFTER \u2018BIG BALLS\u2019 ATTACK\nWashington\u2019s Mayor Muriel Bowser challenged Trump\u2019s description of the city during an interview with MSNBC Sunday, and voiced concerns about the possibility of activating the National Guard to tackle the city\u2019s crime.\n\"Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false,\" Bowser said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"I\u2019m concerned about them not being used efficiently, and I just think that\u2019s not the most efficient use of our Guard,\" Bowser said.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nThis is a breaking news story and will be updated."
