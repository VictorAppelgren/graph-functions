  "description": "BBC Breakfast viewers issued the same complaint during an interview on Tuesday's show",
  "content": "BBC Breakfast viewers claimed to \"switch off\" as they fumed over a controversial interview on Tuesday (August 12). During today's edition of the hit morning programme, hosts Jon Kay and Sarah Campbell updated viewers with the latest news from across the UK and around the world. John Watson was also in the studio to present the sports segment, while Carol Kirkwood delivered regular weather updates live from a sunflower field in Milton Keynes. Ahead of the publication of her new memoir, Jon and Sarah welcomed former First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon to the studio. During the interview, Nicola reflected on the day of her arrest in 2023, as well as her sexuality, miscarriage, and past handling of legislation.\n\nHowever, several BBC viewers weren't impressed with the length of the interview, with many taking to X (formerly Twitter) to share their frustration. \"Just turned #BBCBreakfast off. Why are they giving more airtime to Sturgeon?\" one person wrote, with another adding: \"This interview with Sturgeon is a waste of time #BBCBreakfast. Apart from the break for the 'local' news, we've had 30 mins of in studio interviews... No news?\" A third said, \"Seriously, that's enough now.\" This is a breaking showbiz story and is being constantly updated.
