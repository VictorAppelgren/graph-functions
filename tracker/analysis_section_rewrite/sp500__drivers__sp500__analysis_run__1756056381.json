      "feedback": "Strong cross‑topic framing is evident, but the analysis lacks a crisp first‑principles causal chain, a fully testable three‑regime scenario, and tightly quantified links to the sources; to upgrade, anchor a clear base‑case Regime A to NL5YYTLF2 with explicit regime transitions to Regimes 2 and 3 and concrete triggers (37UZC9X8I), then lay out a principled causal chain: AI uptake boosts productivity (TFP), raises capex discipline and pricing power, expands margins and ROIC, while retraining/UBI stabilizes demand; quantify the long‑horizon frame with numbers tied to sources (ACMR 2025 revenue ~$900m, GM ~4% anchored to 22PL3Q360, Ford Q2 metrics: EV losses ~$1.3B, adj. EBIT ~4.3%, ROIC ~10.1%, 2014–2024 revenue CAGR ~2.5% from 22PL3Q360), and map FX/valuation drivers to the four‑regime EURUSD spine (5S9GJV2O3; UVEQ2SJ0W; HWGNUP2XG) while clarifying how regime shifts alter risk premia and exit terms; explicitly reconcile conflicting directional signals by stating where Regime A would be invalidated (persistent inflation/wage momentum vs cooling payrolls vs growth deceleration) with the same source anchors, and build a tight watch‑list of decisive signals: inflation‑wage momentum, payroll trajectory, automation capex cadence, EV‑cycle pricing, governance/exits risk, and episodic shocks; ensure every assertion is sourced to an ID and consistently tied to the regime framework, and remove repetition to preserve a concise, macro‑to‑valuation flow. These edits will yield a testable, world‑class narrative that clearly delineates drivers, mechanisms, fragilities, and actionable signals.",
