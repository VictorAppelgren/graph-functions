      "feedback": "**Edit Summary (focus on ust10y):**  \n1. **Remove** the mortgage‑rate paragraph (sentence 4) and the DXY paragraph (sentence 5) – they discuss downstream assets and dilute the Treasury focus.  \n2. **Remove** the SPX paragraph (sentence 6) – equity valuation is a secondary channel; keep the brief on the Treasury itself.  \n3. **Add** an explicit handle mapping in the opening sentence: “ust10y +5–10 bp (3–6 mo)”.  \n4. **Add** a short causal chain in the risk paragraph: “Fed tightening → term‑structure compression → ust10y –5 bp; recession‑triggered easing → ust10y +10 bp” with citations (GK86UUQPN).  \n5. **Ensure** every remaining sentence ends with an inline citation that ties the stated effect directly to ust10y (e.g., (O6LHRBLFM)(GK86UUQPN) for the base‑case lift, (GK86UUQPN) for Fed‑tightening risk, (Z7O1DCHS7) for the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread watch).  \n6. **Trim** the confidence sentence to a single clause: “Confidence is moderate, contingent on defense‑bill passage and Fed‑policy trajectory (GK86UUQPN).”  \n7. **Re‑phrase** the watch‑signals list to emphasize ust10y‑specific catalysts: “Watch the July / August Fed minutes, Q4 2025 defense‑bill funding, 2‑yr/10‑yr spread, and CPI/PCE releases (GK86UUQPN)(O6LHRBLFM)(Z7O1DCHS7)(LF0UUL917).”  \n\nThese edits keep the brief tightly scoped to the 10‑year Treasury, satisfy the handle‑mapping and catalyst‑window requirements, and eliminate extraneous asset references.",
