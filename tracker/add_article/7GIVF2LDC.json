      "summary": "A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking the FTC’s civil investigative demand against Media Matters, ruling that the agency’s actions were likely retaliatory and violated the First Amendment. The demand, sent by FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson, sought information on Media Matters’ contacts with advertising groups after the watchdog published a 2023 piece on antisemitic posts next to ads on Elon Musk’s X. The judge noted that the demand had already deterred Media Matters from reporting on the FTC, Musk, and the agency’s leadership, and that the timing and comments by Ferguson suggested pretext. Media Matters, already strained by legal costs and staff layoffs, has considered shutting down, underscoring the broader impact of the investigation on press freedom.",
