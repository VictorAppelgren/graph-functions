  "title": "Analysts detail 3 defense stock plays under the Trump administration",
  "description": "President Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" could spell big growth for some defense players.",
  "content": "President Trump's push to enhance the military is creating opportunities for defense contractors.\n\nA provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed in July, earmarked over $150 billion to invest in defense initiatives like AI systems, missile defense, and cybersecurity. Companies like CACI (CACI), Booz Allen (BAH), and ViaSat (VSAT) could capitalize on the boost.\n\nCACI has quickly become a Street favorite for defense stocks. Goldman Sachs analyst Noah Poponak recently issued a double upgrade on its shares, boosting its rating to Buy and raising its price target to $544 from $407. He cited the company's \"pivot to advanced technologies,\" expecting it to \"grow faster than peers over the medium-term.\"\n\nCACI's strength lies in its close relationship with the Department of Defense, which accounts for three-quarters of its revenue. Federal civilian agencies contribute another 20%, while commercial customers make up an estimated 4%.\n\nAccording to William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma, CACI's proprietary counter-drone systems set it apart from competitors like Booz Allen.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that 26% of CACI\u2019s revenue comes from counter-drone solutions, which include both services and hardware,\" DiPalma told Yahoo Finance. \"We think CACI shares are undervalued, and investors will, over the next year, begin to give the stock more credit as a drone stock, and the stock price will increase.\"\n\nShares of CACI are up 21% year to date. In its most recent quarter, revenue grew 13% year over year to $2.3 billion, topping estimates of $2.29 billion. Adjusted earnings per share surged 27% to $8.40, beating consensus estimates of $6.54, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nMeanwhile, Booz Allen, one of America's oldest defense consulting firms, has had a rocky stretch. Its shares have slipped 15% year to date and are down nearly 28% in the past 12 months.\n\nEarlier this year, the DoD signaled it would scale back some consulting contracts, eventually canceling 234 deals. Booz Allen had 97 of its agreements nixed, compared to CACI's four, noted Poponak.\n\nBut sentiment is shifting, with DiPalma forecasting Booz Allen as a comeback play. In a research note, he pointed to solid June-quarter contract awards and renewed interest in the company's core offering of AI, cybersecurity, software development, and data analytics.\n\n\"Booz Allen historically has proven adept at navigating the political landscape,\" DiPalma wrote. He expects more than 20% upside for the stock over the next year as the new administration prioritizes its expertise.",

CACI is praised for its close ties to the DoD and counter\u2011drone tech, with analysts upgrading its stock and noting a 21% YTD gain.  Booz Allen, while hit by DoD contract cancellations, is seen as a potential rebound play thanks to new AI and cyber contracts.  Viasat, a satellite communications firm, offers broadband and defense services but faces weak profitability and a sell rating from analysts.",
