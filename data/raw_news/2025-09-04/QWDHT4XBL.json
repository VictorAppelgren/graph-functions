Regional work continues in the gold district, and we are developing additional targets and making new discoveries while advancing the bulk sample at the Jaclyn Main Zone, which remains our primary focus,\" stated Anderson, CEO. Four trenches were excavated during June within the southwest region of the Golden Promise Property in an area of gold anomalies (soil and rock samples). Initial 2024 trenching in this area uncovered bedrock anomalous for gold and copper. The Golden Promise Property hosts gold bearing quartz veins in various regions of the property including the Jaclyn Zone quartz vein systems, Shawn's Shot quartz vein, Otter Brook occurrence, Linda / Snow White quartz vein system and the Gabbro Zone occurrence. The 2025 trenches were excavated within the southwest region of the property within Mineral Licence 036105M, approximately 4 kilometers northeast of Linda / Snow White gold bearing quartz vein system.

Golden Promise Mines Inc. collected rock samples anomalous for gold +/- anomalous copper from two trenches in this area during 2024 (see Company News Release of February 12th, 2025), including:\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/3027/265010_93088b2f142d4b80_004full.jpg Trench No. 1 of the 2025 program was excavated between the two 2024 trenches. Trench No. 2 of 2025 program was excavated west \u2013 southwest of 2024 Trench No. 2. The third and fourth 2025 trenches were excavated approximately 200 meters and 160 meters southwest and south of the second 2025 trench in an area of gold soil anomalies (identified during Great Atlantic's 2018 and 2020 exploration programs).

Most of the samples contain quartz veining (with +/- metasedimentary host rock) and / or sulfide mineralization consisting mainly of pyrite. Chalcopyrite is present in some samples collected from 2025 Trench No. 2. All samples have been submitted to an independent, certified laboratory for gold and multi-element analysis. The analytical results are pending. Five additional rock samples were collected during the June program from the area of 2024 Trench No. 1 which has been backfilled. Three of these samples were collected from a near surface bedrock exposure at this trench site (same location as 2024 sample no. 309469 which yielded 0.481 g/t gold, >6.0 g/t silver and >1% copper). The three 2025 grab samples were collected from the same narrow (up to approximately 0.4 meters wide) silicified, sheared and sulfide bearing (pyrite and chalcopyrite) zone as sample 309469. These samples have also been submitted to an independent, certified laboratory for gold and multi-element analysis.

(TSXV: GR) (the \"Company\" or \"Great Atlantic\") is pleased to announce its wholly owned subsidiary, Golden Promise Mines Inc., has completed a trenching program at its Golden Promise Gold Property, located in central Newfoundland.\n2025 Trench No. 2 \u2013 Golden Promise\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/3027/265010_93088b2f142d4b80_002full.jpg\n\"Great Atlantic has assembled a prolific and diverse portfolio of 100% owned properties assembled in both NB & NFLD. Regional work continues in the gold district, and we are developing additional targets and making new discoveries while advancing the bulk sample at the Jaclyn Main Zone, which remains our primary focus,\" stated Anderson, CEO.\nFour trenches were excavated during June within the southwest region of the Golden Promise Property in an area of gold anomalies (soil and rock samples). Initial 2024 trenching in this area uncovered bedrock anomalous for gold and copper.\nThe Golden Promise Property hosts gold bearing quartz veins in various regions of the property including the Jaclyn Zone quartz vein systems, Shawn's Shot quartz vein, Otter Brook occurrence, Linda / Snow White quartz vein system and the Gabbro Zone occurrence. The 2025 trenches were excavated within the southwest region of the property within Mineral Licence 036105M, approximately 4 kilometers northeast of Linda / Snow White gold bearing quartz vein system.\nGolden Promise Mines Inc.

Golden Promise Mines Inc. collected rock samples anomalous for gold +/- anomalous copper from two trenches in this area during 2024 (see Company News Release of February 12th, 2025), including:\n2024 Trench #1:\n- 309464 (float): 0.964 grams / tonne (g/t) gold\n- 309466 (subcrop): 0.463 g/t gold and 4,287 ppm copper (0.428% Cu)\n- 309469 (bedrock): 0.481 g/t gold, >6.0 g/t silver and >10,000 ppm copper (> 1% Cu)\n2024 Trench #2:\n- 309472 (float): 0.420 g/t gold\n- 309473 (bedrock): 0.323 g/t gold\n- 309474 (float): 0.196 g/t gold and 5,370 ppm copper (0.537% Cu)\nGolden Promise 2024 \u2013 2025 Trench Map\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/3027/265010_93088b2f142d4b80_004full.jpg\nTrench No. 1 of the 2025 program was excavated between the two 2024 trenches. Trench No. 2 of 2025 program was excavated west \u2013 southwest of 2024 Trench No. 2. The third and fourth 2025 trenches were excavated approximately 200 meters and 160 meters southwest and south of the second 2025 trench in an area of gold soil anomalies (identified during Great Atlantic's 2018 and 2020 exploration programs).\n2025 Trench No. 3 \u2013 Golden Promise\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/3027/265010_93088b2f142d4b80_005full.jpg\nThirty-eight samples were collected during June at the four 2025 trench sites with samples collected from glacial float boulders excavated from the trenches and from subcrop and outcrop within the trenches. Most of the samples contain quartz veining (with +/- metasedimentary host rock) and / or sulfide mineralization consisting mainly of pyrite. Chalcopyrite is present in some samples collected from 2025 Trench No. 2. All samples have been submitted to an independent, certified laboratory for gold and multi-element analysis. The analytical results are pending.\nFive additional rock samples were collected during the June program from the area of 2024 Trench No. 1 which has been backfilled. Three of these samples were collected from a near surface bedrock exposure at this trench site (same location as 2024 sample no. 309469 which yielded 0.481 g/t gold, >6.0 g/t silver and >1% copper). The three 2025 grab samples were collected from the same narrow (up to approximately 0.4 meters wide) silicified, sheared and sulfide bearing (pyrite and chalcopyrite) zone as sample 309469. These samples have also been submitted to an independent, certified laboratory for gold and multi-element analysis.\nSheared, Silicified and Sulfide Bearing Zone\n(2024 sample 309469: 0.48 g/t Au, >6.0 g/t Ag & >1% Cu)\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/3027/265010_93088b2f142d4b80_006full.jpg\nThe Golden Promise Property is the largest and most advanced of six central Newfoundland gold properties owned by Golden Promise Mines Inc. and located within the Exploits Subzone of the Newfoundland Dunnage Zone. One of these properties (Golden Trust) is located within one kilometer of the Valentine Gold Mine of Equinox Gold Corp. which is also located within the Exploits Subzone.
