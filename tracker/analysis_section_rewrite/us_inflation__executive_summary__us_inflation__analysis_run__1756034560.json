      "feedback": "Strong start, but tighten for a world‑class, decision‑ready brief. Actionable edits: (1) Condense to 4–6 crisp lines in a Base Case / Bull Case / Bear Case + Watch/Invalidation format, and drop the long prose and non‑core macro/weather detours to fit the 4–6 sentence/bullet constraint. (2) Build a single, explicit first‑principles causal chain: cloud/AI capex → durable platform moats and ecosystem leverage (cite 0G3A676BP) → higher revenue visibility and operating leverage (cite QFDWCTAYB) → premium multiples as moat growth persists (cite 0G3A676BP/4LQD15CFU); ensure every link is visibly tied to a source and avoid non‑core digressions. (3) Sharpen scope to core signals around Shopify and Microsoft; prune private‑market and weather/policy overlays unless used as explicit near‑term triggers, and label any such items as optional macro overlays with a single source set (prefer 0G3A676BP, QFDWCTAYB, 4LQD15CFU, GX057ADL7, J99EM2TPZ, U1KRCQOYR, S7M6BJSRT). (4) Add concrete, source‑anchored triggers and invalidations: e.g., specify a base‑case cadence from Shopify/H1 data (GMV, revenue, op income) and Microsoft cloud growth; define bear triggers as a material GMV/margin deceleration or lasting cloud‑growth disappointment; define bull triggers as sustained above‑base growth and margin expansion; attach the relevant citations to each trigger (e.g., QFDWCTAYB, 0G3A676BP, GX057ADL7). (5) Make valuation logic explicit and concise: frame the thesis as a durable AI/cloud cash‑flow re‑rating under a lower discount rate (cite GX057ADL7, SK994CBWR) and quantify where possible via observed margins/backlog, while avoiding hedged, non‑core assumptions. (6) Tighten citation hygiene and conflict reconciliation: ensure every claim has a cited source, reconcile any conflicts between macro/sector signals (policy, oil, tariff) and the base case by labeling them as upside/downside risks rather than core drivers, and limit to the most critical IDs (0G3A676BP; QFDWCTAYB; 4LQD15CFU; GX057ADL7; SK994CBWR; J99EM2TPZ; U1KRCQOYR; S7M6BJSRT). (7) Proofread for consistency and avoid repetition; ensure every data point supports the decision thesis and that “what to watch” and “invalidations” are explicit with clear, source‑backed hooks.",
