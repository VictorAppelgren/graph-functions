  "description": "FBI searches home of former Trump adviser John Bolton",
  "content": "Investing.com -- The FBI is conducting a search at the Maryland home of John Bolton, who served as national security adviser during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration, as part of an investigation into the handling of classified documents, according to reports from AP and Axios, citing sources.\n\nBolton has not been detained or charged with any crimes, the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly.\n\nBolton served as Trump\u2019s third national security adviser for 17 months before becoming critical of the president. Their relationship deteriorated as they disagreed on policy matters related to Iran, Afghanistan, and North Korea.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Bolton has faced scrutiny over sensitive information. During Trump\u2019s first term, Bolton wrote a book about his time in government that officials claimed disclosed classified information. However, the Justice Department abandoned its lawsuit against him in 2021 and dropped a separate grand jury investigation.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.
