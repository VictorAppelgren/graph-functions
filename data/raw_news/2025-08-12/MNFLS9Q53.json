We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Your support makes all the difference.\n\nLas Vegas\u2019s oldest hotel is replacing all of its tables using real cards and dealers and replacing them with electronic gaming versions.\n\nThe Golden Gate Hotel & Casino is \"reimagining\" its casino floor and, in a Downtown Vegas first, removing live dealers, according to Circa Resort & Casino CEO Derek Stevens.\n\n\"Big changes are coming to the Golden Gate, and we couldn\u2019t be more excited. As the oldest hotel in Las Vegas, we\u2019ve always embraced the future, and now we\u2019re reimagining our casino floor with a high-energy electronic table games pit unlike anything downtown has seen,\" Stevens said in his statement.\n\nThe workers who will be displaced by the change are being offered roles at other company casinos, or the chance to try something new within the organization.\n\n\"All of our table games team members at the Golden Gate are being offered roles at Circa or the D, or the opportunity to explore new departments within the company,\" Stevens wrote.\n\nHe promised \"more excitement, faster gameplay, and all the newest machines\" on the 118-year-old casino\u2019s floor.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly when the change will go into effect.\n\nWhile casinos have long featured electronic games like slot machines and video poker, most major venues also have live tables for poker, blackjack, roulette, craps, and other games.\n\nMost casinos \u2014 if they have electronic table games at all \u2014 have them alongside traditional tables with human dealers. Last year, the Silver Sevens, which is an off-Strip Vegas casino, moved to hybrid tables that have a human dealer but do not use chips and use a terminal for placing bets.\n\nIn 2021, the Resorts Casino & Hotel in Atlantic City introduced a slew of electronic table games to its floor, though those games exist alongside other live casino games.",

He was shot by officers who responded to the scene, but survived. He remains in critical condition. The extent of his injuries remains unclear. Police have not stated whether he has been charged.\nThe suspect was armed with a 9mm handgun when he fired roughly 80 rounds outside the casino, police said.\nThe shooting occurred around 7:30 a.m. when the gunman walked up to the casino-hotel\u2019s valet parking area, pulled out a handgun and pointed it at the bachelor party group, police said.\nHis gun initially malfunctioned, but he was quickly able to get it to shoot multiple times before fleeing on foot through the parking lot, where he encountered an armed casino security guard. Crawforth said the gunman opened fire on the guard, who returned fire as the shooter fled again.\nThe suspect later shot at Martinez as he was driving by in the parking lot, striking and killing him before officers arrived on the scene within three minutes of the first shots being fired, Crawforth said.\nHe allegedly \u201cshot Martinez several times.\u201d\nAccording to a GoFundMe that has been set up for Martinez, his \u201cgreatest joy was being a father and grandfather.\u201d\nThe senior citizen came from \u201ca large loving family, one of eleven siblings... loved cooking,\u201d in addition to spending more than three decades working in restaurants and casinos throughout Reno, Nevada, his family shared.\nFurther information has also emerged about the other victims.\nAndrew Canepa was a co-owner of Side Street Caf\u00e9 in the Newbury Park community, about 40 miles west-northwest of downtown Los Angeles, Ventura County Supervisor and former deputy mayor of Los Angeles, Jeff Gorell, said in a Facebook post.\nGorell described Canepa as \u201ca loving father to his young son.\u201d\n\"We will miss seeing his warm presence at the restaurant and are deeply saddened by this loss,\" he said.\nA GoFundMe page has also been launched in his memory.\nDylan McLean, who was shot in the shoulder, managed to jump into a nearby truck and asked the driver to take him to a hospital, friends told The Los Angeles Times.\nWhile en route, he called Matt Harper Sitler, a friend who was shot multiple times and was also hiding from the gunman. He was hospitalized, listed in critical condition, and placed on life support Monday, said The Times.\nThe same evening, after receiving surgery to remove his spleen, Sitler was able to breathe on his own, his friends told The Times. His first words after the attack were, \u201cIs Andrew OK?\u201d\nJustin Aguila\u2019s loved ones have also set up a GoFundMe page, which has raised nearly $50,000 at the time of writing.\n\u201cJustin was so much to so many\u2014an incredible fiance, a loving son and brother, and a truly loyal friend. He had the kindest heart, a vibrant spirit, and a way of making everyone feel welcome, seen, and loved. His laughter, generosity, and authenticity will be deeply missed by all who knew him,\u201d one section of the page reads.\nThe page goes on to mention that Aguila is survived by his fianc\u00e9e, his parents, brother, and sister.\nPolice say two people remain hospitalized \u2013 both are expected to make a full recovery.\nHawver was able to buy his firearm two years ago and recently bought ammunition, police said.\nHe does not have a criminal history, nor has he been found to have suffered from any mental health conditions.\nAt present, investigators say \u201chis motive is unknown\u201d as he did not have any known connection to the Grand Sierra Resort or any of the victims.\nAn investigation is ongoing."

      "text": "All major Las Vegas Strip casinos are now unionized in historic labor victory\nThe Culinary Workers Union representing 60,000 hospitality workers in Nevada has achieved a historic victory on the Las Vegas Strip\nWhen Susana Pacheco accepted a housekeeping job at a casino on the Las Vegas Strip 16 years ago, she believed it was a step toward stability for her and her 2-year-old daughter.\nBut the single mom found herself exhausted, falling behind on bills and without access to stable health insurance, caught in a cycle of low pay and little support. For years, she said, there was no safety net in sight \u2014 until now.\nFor 25 years, her employer, the Venetian, had resisted organizing efforts as one of the last holdouts on the Strip, locked in a prolonged standoff with the Culinary Workers Union. But a recent change in ownership opened the Venetian\u2019s doors to union representation just as the Strip\u2019s newest casino, the Fontainebleau, was also inking its first labor contract.\nThe historic deals finalized late last year mark a major turning point: For the first time in the Culinary Union's 90-year history, all major casinos on the Strip are unionized. Backed by 60,000 members, most of them in Las Vegas, it is the largest labor union in Nevada. Experts say the Culinary Union\u2019s success is a notable exception in a national landscape where union membership overall is declining.\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve shown that change can be a positive force, and I\u2019m confident that this partnership will continue to benefit us all in the years to come,\" Patrick Nichols, president and CEO of the Venetian, said shortly after workers approved the deal.\nPacheco says their new contract has already reshaped her day-to-day life. The housekeeper no longer races against the clock to clean an unmanageable number of hotel suites, and she\u2019s spending more quality time with her children because of the better pay and guaranteed days off.\n\u201cNow with the union, we have a voice,\u201d Pacheco said.\nUnion strength is fading nationally\nThese gains come at a time when union membership nationally is at an all-time low, and despite Republican-led efforts over the years to curb union power. About 10% of U.S. workers belonged to a union in 2024, down from 20% in 1983, the first year for which data is available, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics.\nPresident Donald Trump in March signed an executive order seeking to end collective bargaining for certain federal employees that led to union leaders suing the administration. Nevada and more than two dozen other states now have so-called \u201cright to work\u201d laws that let workers opt out of union membership and dues. GOP lawmakers have also supported changes to the National Labor Relations Board and other regulatory bodies, seeking to reduce what they view as overly burdensome rules on businesses.\nRuben Garcia, professor and director of the workplace program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas law school, said the Culinary Union's resilience stems from its deep roots in Las Vegas, its ability to adapt to the growth and corporatization of the casino industry, and its long history of navigating complex power dynamics with casino owners and operators.\nHe said the consolidation of casinos on the Las Vegas Strip mirrors the dominance of the Big Three automakers in Detroit. A few powerful companies \u2014 MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment and Wynn Resorts \u2014 now control most of the dozens of casinos along Las Vegas Boulevard.\n\u201cThat consolidation can make things harder for workers in some ways, but it also gives unions one large target,\" Garcia said.\nThat dynamic worked in the union's favor in 2023, when the threat of a major strike by 35,000 hospitality workers with expired contracts loomed over the Strip. But a last-minute deal with Caesars narrowly averted the walkout, and it triggered a domino effect across the Strip, with the union quickly finalizing similar deals for workers at MGM Resorts and Wynn properties.\nThe latest contracts secured a historic 32% bump in pay over the life of the five-year contract. Union casino workers will earn an average $35 hourly, including benefits, by the end of it.\nThe union's influence also extends far beyond the casino floor. With its ability to mobilize thousands of its members for canvassing and voter outreach, the union's endorsements are highly coveted, particularly among Democrats, and can signal who has the best shot at winning working-class votes.\nThe union has \u2014 and still \u2014 faces resistance\nThe union's path hasn't always been smooth though. Michael Green, a history professor at UNLV, noted the Culinary Union has long faced resistance.\n\u201cHistorically, there have always been people who are anti-union,\u201d Green said.\nEarlier this year, two food service workers in Las Vegas filed federal complaints with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing the union of deducting dues despite their objections to union membership. It varies at each casino, but between 95 to 98% of workers opt in to union membership, according to the union.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Culinary Union bosses deserve my support,\u201d said one of the workers, Renee Guerrero, who works at T-Mobile Arena on the Strip. \u201cTheir actions since I attempted to exercise my right to stop dues payments only confirms my decision.\u201d\nBut longtime union members like Paul Anthony see things differently. Anthony, a food server at the Bellagio and a Culinary member for nearly 40 years, said his union benefits \u2014 free family health insurance, reliable pay raises, job security and a pension \u2014 helped him to build a lasting career in the hospitality industry.\n\u201cA lot of times it is an industry that doesn't have longevity,\" he said. But on the Strip, it's a job that people can do for \u201c20 years, 30 years, 40 years.\u201d\nTed Pappageorge, the union's secretary-treasurer and lead negotiator, said the union calls this the \u201cLas Vegas dream.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been our goal to make sure that this town is a union town,\" he said."

      "text": "Why don\u2019t Texans want a casino? It\u2019s not the law, it\u2019s the principle\nResidents of a Texas town said no to a multi-billion dollar company that wanted to open a casino. They have won for now, Rhian Lubin reports\nOne by one, residents of the Texas city of Irving stood up to voice their opposition to controversial plans for a new casino complex to open in their own backyard.\n\u201cWe do not live in Las Vegas because we do not want to live in Las Vegas,\u201d one man who described himself as a local educator said at the city\u2019s planning and zoning commission meeting last Monday.\n\u201cThis deal is a bad deal for Irving and what happens in Vegas has to stay in Vegas,\u201d said another resident, during the six-hour-long meeting that rolled into the early hours Tuesday.\nAt a separate heated town hall event the week before, others held up signs saying \u201cDon\u2019t Vegas my Irving\u201d as a casino lobbyist was booed and jeered for nearly two hours.\nDespite the protests, at around 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, planning commissioners voted to recommend approval of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation\u2019s plans to install a \u201cdestination resort\u201d with a casino to the city council.\nBut ultimately the residents prevailed \u2014 at least for now.\nFollowing immense public pressure, Sands announced Thursday it had removed the casino element from their proposal.\nFor the last month, Irving has been embroiled in a scrappy public fight over the proposal put forward by Sands, owned by Trump megadonor Miriam Adelson, who also has a majority stake in the Dallas Mavericks.\nSands bought the property and the land where the Texas Stadium used to stand in 2023. Now it wants to rezone it to be home to a new casino.\nBut aside from fierce opposition from many Irving residents, Sands has another major battle on its hands: gambling is illegal in the state of Texas.\nThe casino behemoth has been lobbying hard for gambling legalization in the state for years.\n\u201cY\u2019all can relax,\u201d casino lobbyist Andy Abboud, the company\u2019s senior vice president of government relations, told the unimpressed town hall last week. \u201cIt\u2019s not even legal yet!\u201d\nBut campaigners believe Sands is biding its time in order to achieve its end goal.\n\u201cThey're facing some challenges at the state level, but they are playing the long game,\u201d Irving city councilman Luis Canosa told The Independent. \u201cThey are lobbying very hard, spending tens of millions every year. And it doesn't matter for them if it gets legalized in 10 or 15 years, they still want to have the security that they have the rezoning, which once it's given, cannot be taken away.\u201d\nTexas has some of the most restrictive gaming laws in the U.S. and campaigners argue that greenlighting casinos would lead to a rise in domestic violence, gambling addiction and human trafficking.\nTo build its casino in Texas, Sands needs a Constitutional Amendment legalizing gambling at state level to pass and it needs Irving City Council to approve the zoning entitlements.\n\u201cThey want to leave gaming open to establish a full predatory casino that extracts money from the working class, from hurting families, from addicts, from older people in Social Security checks that cannot afford to lose anything,\u201d Canosa said. \u201cIt's going to be a machine to extract money from the working class people for the exclusive benefit of billionaire special interests.\u201d\nCanosa described Irving, a suburb of Dallas, as a place where people \u201cfrom different walks of life coexist peacefully\u201d and where many Texans have moved to raise a family.\nAt the tense town hall last week, Abboud from Sands was asked by a resident whether the company was considering alternative cities, such as Frisco, Arlington or Dallas, for its $4 billion development.\n\u201cI hate to disappoint everybody\u2026but we're focused on Irving right now,\u201d he replied.\nAbboud tried to bill the complex as a \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d destination.\n\u201cIt would become another spectacular entertainment option for people that are living here,\u201d he said, as some people in the crowd shouted. \u201cIt'd be more restaurants, it would be an arena. It would be family-friendly entertainment with bowling alleys, movie theaters\u2026an arena where you can see everything from Coldplay to Lady Gaga to Disney on Ice.\u201d\nAbboud, who was hit with questions for over an hour, was honest that Sands is not interested in opening the development without a casino.\n\u201cCan you please do a destination tourist place but without a casino?\u201d Sister Mary Angelica asked. \u201cThis would show that the Sands company really cared about the people who live here and are not only profit-minded.\u201d\nBut Abboud\u2019s answer was all business.\n\u201cThe bottom line is that if we're going to build a $4 billion facility and build an arena and build all the other amenities, the gaming component helps us subsidize and build all of the other amenities that make it great,\u201d he said, to a chorus of booing.\nFor now, the company says it will proceed with the complex without the casino.\n\u201cTeam Sands will now pretend they don\u2019t want gaming in Irving until they get a friendlier council,\u201d Canosa said after Thursday\u2019s win. \u201cIf their pro-casino candidates get across the finish line, they\u2019ll bring it back in a heartbeat.\u201d\nThe councilman was the first to bring the city\u2019s intention to fast-track the plans to the public at the end of February and claimed the company \u201ctried to go behind residents\u2019 backs\u201d with the negotiations.\n\u201cWe don't want it here, and the residents don't want it. There's massive opposition,\u201d he told The Independent.\nNot everyone agrees. City council member Dennis Webb said it was a loss of opportunity for Irving.\n\u201cI am sad that people keep wanting to come to Irving wanting to do something for us, and we keep losing all of these opportunities to get some great amenities for our citizens, who constantly tell me there is nothing in Irving to do,\u201d he said, according to the Dallas News.\nSands executive Mark Boekenheide reinforced Abboud\u2019s message that the company \u201ccannot commit\u201d to the project without the casino element. \u201cThe economics will not work without a casino piece,\u201d Boekenheide told city council members Thursday.\nThe executive said that the complex is projected to create 9,000 jobs for the community and could generate millions in tax revenue for the city.\nSpeaking before Thursday\u2019s meeting, Canosa told The Independent he would be \u201cproud\u201d if his fellow council members stood up to Sands.\n\u201cIf the gaming piece gets delayed or taken out, that will mean that at least enough of the representatives listened to the people and stood strong in in, frankly, a heroic act,\u201d Canosa said. \u201cBecause whenever people see in Texas that Miriam Adelson is showing up with an interest, everybody bends over backwards.\n\u201cThese people are very powerful. It does take a lot of integrity to stand up.\u201d\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

  "argos_summary": "The Golden Gate Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas is transitioning from live dealers to electronic gaming tables, marking a significant change for the city's oldest hotel. This shift aims to enhance the gaming experience with faster gameplay and modern machines, while displaced workers are offered roles at other company casinos. Meanwhile, the Culinary Workers Union has achieved a historic milestone by unionizing all major casinos on the Las Vegas Strip, securing better pay and working conditions for hospitality workers amid a national decline in union membership. In Texas, residents of Irving successfully opposed a proposed casino by the Las Vegas Sands Corporation, reflecting local resistance to gambling expansion despite the company's lobbying efforts.",
