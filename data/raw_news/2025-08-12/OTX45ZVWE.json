  "description": "I'm a huge fan of dual monitor setups, but recently, I find myself more and more tempted by ultrawides.",
  "content": "I\u2019ve been a fan of dual monitor setups for well over a decade. While my colleagues here at Digital Trends argued about the benefits of the best gaming monitors that were ultrawide vs. using a dual 16:9 setup, I never doubted \u2014 two monitors for me, please and thank you.\n\nBut lately, my resolve has been melting, and with good reason, too. Here\u2019s why I\u2019m hanging on to my dual monitors by a thread, and why I might ultimately make the switch to a single ultrawide in the near future.\n\nAm I getting old?\n\nRight, so, just to reiterate \u2014 I love dual monitor setups. If I ever have to work on my laptop, I\u2019m suffering due to the lack of a second screen.\n\nWhether I\u2019m working or gaming, I always, always, always want to have a second monitor to throw all kinds of things onto. When I work, it\u2019s my notes or a million tabs with research; when I game, it\u2019s Netflix, Discord, or Chrome. In any case, there\u2019s almost never a time when I don\u2019t actively use both of my monitors.\n\nAnd yet, I feel like I might have to change my mind soon.\n\nOver a year after I finally decided to stop neglecting my second monitor and bought two of the same screens, I can feel my resolve to stick to a dual-monitor setup melting away, and I can\u2019t help but wonder \u2026\n\n\u2026am I just getting old?\n\nHaving to constantly crane my neck left and right never used to bother me before. I also never used to care much that my two monitors don\u2019t have the exact same colors, despite hours of meticulous calibration. The viewing angles being different were alright, too, as my second monitor was never the one I actively stared at while sitting at my desk.\n\nBut, I have to say, it\u2019s starting to bug me a little bit now. Perhaps my biggest problem are the bezels \u2014 while my monitors have super-thin bezels, they\u2019re still there, and it\u2019s hard to push them together perfectly when one is at an angle.\n\nI also wear glasses, and I use progressive lenses, which have different strengths across the lens. This means that at the sides and near the top, the prescription is weaker, which makes looking at my second monitor a little tiring at times.\n\nPut together, it\u2019s fair to say that I see the problem with dual monitor setups \u2014 and unfortunately, ultrawides are starting to look tempting.\n\nUltrawides are better and cheaper than ever\n\nWe\u2019ve reviewed a bunch of excellent ultrawides, including some of the best ultrawides on the market. Some were expensive, and some were rather affordable. Many were tempting to me even when my dual-monitor resolve was stronger than it is now.\n\nHowever, ultrawides are getting harder to resist because they\u2019ve become much more commonplace. You don\u2019t need to drop $1,000 to get a decent ultrawide; there are plenty of options that are more affordable than my dual setup ever was \u2014 and they don\u2019t suffer from the same problems that my setup is plagued by.\n\nTake the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9, which blew us away in a slightly different iteration. It\u2019s not cheap, but this is a 49-inch ultrawide monitor with a 144Hz refresh rate; it looks like a dream, and it now costs $879. That\u2019s more than I spent on my two monitors, but only just, and it\u2019s a whole new category of display. Check it out \u2014 it\u2019s gorgeous.\n\nStill, you don\u2019t need to spend a fortune to buy a solid ultrawide. Samsung\u2019s ViewFinity costs $269 right now (I found it on sale), and it\u2019s still superb. It\u2019s 34 inches, which is a lot more manageable if you sit by the desk, and it\u2019s still optimized for gaming thanks to the 100Hz refresh rate.\n\nThe cheapest ultrawide I\u2019d reasonably buy is this Sceptre model at $199. It actually costs less than one of my monitors in my dual setup, and it has everything most gamers could possibly ask for.\n\nYeah, these prices aren\u2019t helping, and I\u2019ve had more than one friend try to convince me to just go for it. But, there are things I\u2019d miss if I switched to an ultrawide.\n\nI\u2019m tempted, but I\u2019m staying strong for now\n\nThere are many good reasons why I stayed true to my dual setup over the years, and despite the neck pain and the lens-induced frustration, I\u2019m not ready to jump ship just yet.\n\nFor starters, I still believe (and yes, I\u2019ve used ultrawides too for testing purposes) that dual (or multi) monitor setups are second to none for productivity. I love having two entirely independent screens where I don\u2019t risk using the wrong app at the wrong time, and can have everything organized the way I like it.\n\nNext, gaming. Ultrawides make many games look outstanding, but the downside is that many games aren\u2019t optimized for them. If you play indies or older titles, you\u2019ll be left with ugly black bars on the sides of your game, or, at best, suboptimal pixel distribution if you brute-force the title into fitting the 21:9 or 32:9 aspect ratio.\n\nLastly, proximity to the screen. I sit by my desk, which is stupidly small (the joys of having a tiny apartment), so those 34-inch or 49-inch ultrawides wouldn\u2019t work for me. I\u2019m already pushing it with two 27-inch monitors.\n\nUltimately, the satisfaction from using two fantastic monitors still outweighs the annoyances that plague me on a daily basis. If you\u2019re curious which ones I own, they\u2019re the LG 27GP850-B, and I couldn\u2019t recommend them enough if I tried \u2014 so I\u2019m sticking to them, through thick and thin. Please don\u2019t try to tempt me otherwise.",

  "summary": "Digital Trends's Digital Trends writer, Rick Steves, has been a fan of dual monitor setups for over a decade and has been using them for over ten years. However, he has been feeling increasingly tempted to switch to a single ultrawide, citing the lack of a second screen as a key issue. Steves argues that dual monitors are more compact and more affordable than their dual setup, and that ultrawides are becoming more common. He criticizes the bezels on his dual monitors, which cause them to be squeezed between them at an angle, and their viewing angles are also causing him to have to crane his neck left and right. However he remains hopeful about switching to a more affordable, more affordable model. Despite these challenges, Steves remains committed to staying with the dual-monitor setup.",

Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nSamsung\u2019s current slate of QD-OLED monitors are among the best gaming monitors you can buy, so it\u2019s no surprise that the Odyssey OLED G9 is a great gaming display. What I didn\u2019t expect going into this review is that I\u2019d actually be considering adopting the unique 32:9 aspect ratio that I wrote off for so many years.\nAt 49 inches diagonally and occupying the space of two 27-inch monitors, the Odyssey OLED G9 seemed too impractical to be usable, and I was certain that it would be hard to recommend alongside the best monitors. After spending some time with it, however, it\u2019s clear that the monitor provides unrivaled productivity prowess and one of the most immersive gaming experiences money can buy. It won\u2019t be easy to go back to even a standard ultrawide monitor.\nVideo review\nSamsung Odyssey OLED G9 specs\n| Samsung Odyssey OLED G8 | |\n| Screen size | 32:9 49 inches |\n| Panel type | OLED |\n| Resolution | 5,120 x 1,440 |\n| Peak brightness | 250 nits (SDR) |\n| HDR | DisplayHDR True Black 400 |\n| Local dimming | 7,372,800 dimming zones |\n| Contrast ratio | 1,000,000:1 |\n| Response time | 0.03ms (GtG) |\n| Refresh rate | 240HzHz |\n| Curve | 1,800R |\n| Speakers | Yes |\n| Inputs | DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.1, Micro HDMI 2.1 |\n| Ports | 3x USB-C |\n| List price | $1,800 |\nStill stunning\nThe Odyssey OLED G9 looks amazing. The screen looks brilliant, as I\u2019ll get to later, but the design of the monitor overall is stunning. I\u2019m a huge fan of Samsung\u2019s Odyssey design this year, which combines a stark silver frame with just enough flair to let you know that it\u2019s a gaming monitor.\nIt\u2019s an entirely metal design with a slim silver frame. That\u2019s a huge plus over Samsung\u2019s previous version of this monitor, which had a chunky plastic back that made the display feel extra large. This is still a very big monitor, but the slim frame, along with the subtle 1800R curve, makes it feel more manageable on a desk compared to the previous version.\nSomething Samsung carried over from the previous version is the CoreSync ring. There\u2019s a layer of diffused plastic around where the stand connects to the monitor that holds RGB lighting. You can set this as a static color, but you can also sync it with what\u2019s on the screen. In a dark room playing Alan Wake 2, the extra bit of lighting did a ton to draw me into the game. Still, the CoreSync ring is fairly dim, so you won\u2019t notice the effect in brightly lit rooms.\nSamsung includes a hefty metal stand in the box that doesn\u2019t take up too much extra desk space. The stand is great, but unsurprisingly, it doesn\u2019t offer a ton of room for adjustment. You have a narrow window for height adjustment and about 15 degrees of tilt, but that\u2019s it. Thankfully, Samsung includes a VESA adaptor in the box, allowing you to mount the monitor for more flexibility in positioning.\nDeath to mini ports\nI was a little worried about the Odyssey OLED G9 after reviewing the Odyssey OLED G8, which exclusively relied on mini connections for the HDMI and DisplayPort cables. That\u2019s not the case here. You have full-size HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4 ports, alongside a single Micro HDMI 2.1 port. These are all recessed on the back, too, making cable management easy.\nThe same isn\u2019t true for the integrated USB hub. You have three USB ports, but they\u2019re all USB-C. Most peripherals aren\u2019t using USB-C cables just yet, so a single USB-A port would\u2019ve gone a long way here. It\u2019s certainly better than the Micro HDMI and Mini DisplayPort connections on the OLED G8, but it\u2019s still something to note.\nImage quality\nAfter reviewing Samsung\u2019s Odyssey OLED G8 earlier this year, I wasn\u2019t surprised to see the Odyssey OLED G9 provide jaw-dropping image quality. This is one of the best QD-OLED displays you can buy, with fantastic color coverage, great color accuracy, and the deep contrast and inky blacks that OLED panels are known for.\nLet\u2019s get some numbers out of the way. In SDR, the monitor covered 100% of sRGB, 98% of DCI-P3, and 95% of AdobeRGB. For those unfamiliar with color spaces, those are some of the highest numbers we\u2019ve ever recorded, showcasing excellent coverage. The color error was a bit higher than the Odyssey OLED G8 we reviewed earlier this year, coming in a 1.36. That\u2019s fine for color work, though you\u2019d want to put the monitor through calibration for any more serious work.\nContrast is infinite due to the fact that OLED produces perfect black levels, but as we\u2019ve seen with displays like the LG UltraGear OLED 27, the trade-off is peak brightness. For a 10% window, the Odyssey OLED G9 peaked art 237 nits, which is a hair below what we\u2019ve seen with displays like the Alienware 34 QD-OLED. I was able to hit 283 nits in HDR with a smaller 5% window, thankfully.\nSwitching over to HDR, color accuracy unsurprisingly takes a dip with an average error of just over 4. That\u2019s not the worst we\u2019ve seen for HDR color accuracy, but there\u2019s no doubt that the HDR experience is for media consumption, not creation. Contrast was once again excellent, though peak brightness just barely scratched 200 nits for a 10% window on-screen.\nA productivity monster\nThe image quality on the Odyssey OLED G9 is stunning, but you can get that with 16:9 monitors like the Asus ROG Swift PG27AQDM. The unique aspect ratio is where the Odyssey OLED G9 really shines. It\u2019s a productivity machine, giving you ample screen real estate to multitask.\nMy preferred way to work is on a 21:9 display where I can have two windows side of side, but the Odyssey OLED G9 takes that idea to the extreme. You\u2019re essentially getting two 27-inch, 16:9 displays. It\u2019s two monitors, just without all of the problems of multi-monitor setups.\nYou can expand this idea further, stacking up windows horizontally to have three or four large views at once. The Odyssey OLED G9 is a massive display, sure, but it actually saves you some space compared to a traditional multi-monitor setup, all while providing the same level of screen space for productivity.\nPeak gaming (when it works)\nI\u2019ve never had a more immersive gaming experience than on the Odyssey OLED G9. The massive 32:9 aspect ratio captures your peripheral vision and doesn\u2019t let you go. Even at a solid viewing distance, you have no other option but to absorb the game world you\u2019re experiencing. One of the first games I booted up was the recent Alan Wake 2, which I had to turn off after about half an hour because it was too scary in that format.\nIt\u2019s not remotely close to VR, but it provides that same feeling of immersion. The Odyssey OLED G9 wrestles your senses away, sucking you into games in a way that even 21:9 monitors can\u2019t manage. I spent nearly an hour just driving around Night City in Cyberpunk 2077, ignoring all of my various objectives, riding high on the feeling of living in this dense futuristic world.\nThe aspect ratio is what matters most, but the Odyssey OLED G9 has plenty of gaming grunt otherwise. The 240Hz display delivers incredible motion clarity with the ultra-low response times of OLED, making titles like Doom Eternal feel ruthlessly responsive. FreeSync Premium Pro is also here, giving you variable refresh rate regardless of your graphics card.\nYou should keep in mind how demanding this resolution is, though. The monitor has a 5,120 x 1,440 resolution, and if you do the math, that\u2019s not far off of 4K. It has 7.3 million pixels, while 4K has 8.3 million. For reference, a 21:9 monitor with a 3,440 x 1,440 resolution has just shy of 5 million, while a 1440p monitor has about 3.6 million. You\u2019ll want a PC equipped for 4K gaming if you plan on picking up the Odyssey OLED G9.\nEven some popular games like Overwatch 2 don\u2019t support the 32:9 resolution.\nWhen the Odyssey OLED G9 is in prime form, there isn\u2019t any else that\u2019s close to it. The problem is that it often won\u2019t be in its prime form. The unique aspect ratio leads to consistent immersion-breaking scenarios where it becomes clear just how silly playing games with a 32:9 monitor is. Playing Alan Wake 2 was terrifying while I was actually playing, but the moment a cutscene started and the sides of the display became massive black voids, I was brought back down to earth.\nIt\u2019s not just cutscenes, either. Every time I opened the menu in Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man, the UI looked cramped on the screen as it quickly adjusted its typical 16:9 aspect ratio. There are also plenty of games that simply won\u2019t support the 32:9 aspect ratio. Indie games like Tunic are almost universally locked to 16:9, forcing you to either run the game in windowed mode or sacrifice about half of your screen real estate to the black bars. This can come up in larger games, too, such as Overwatch 2, where 32:9 resolutions aren\u2019t supported.\nThe wide field of view can work against the gaming experience, too. Again, this isn\u2019t VR, but the Odyssey OLED G9 can give you some motion sickness depending on the game. This particularly comes up in games with extreme motion blur and heavy vignetting, where long gameplay sessions can cause some queasiness. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve never encountered with another monitor.\nFor gaming, the Odyssey OLED G9 is an experience monitor. Spend a few hours with it, and you\u2019ll be floored by the immersion and quality. It\u2019s tougher to settle in for long gaming sessions, though. The black bars for games that don\u2019t support 32:9 are very distracting, much more so than on a 21:9 monitor, so you\u2019ll often have to settle for playing games in windowed mode.\nThat said, the worst experience you\u2019ll find on the Odyssey OLED G9 is simply what you get on a 16:9 monitor, while the best experience is far ahead what you\u2019ll find with a standard display. And, as I\u2019ll get to next, there are plenty of ways to take advantage of the extra screen real estate.\nWhen 32:9 becomes practical\nI just spent a lot of time writing about how 32:9 is impractical for gaming, but with a little bit of effort, it can actually become a huge asset. A lot of that comes down to Samsung Multi View, which lets you split the screen to display different sources. It works great on the Odyssey OLED G9, and it\u2019s a feature you\u2019ll want to take advantage of in a lot of cases.\nThe main draw here is streaming, of all things. Especially if you hook a console up to the monitor, you can use Multi View to see your game on one half of the screen while your PC occupies the other half, allowing you to see your stream information, capture card details, and more. You don\u2019t have to worry about tabbing out of your game, either; these are two separate sources.\nSamsung thankfully allows you to mirror the screen on your phone or laptop.\nEven if you\u2019re not streaming, you can connect a console to one half of the screen while your PC occupies the other half with Discord, a video, or Spotify (or anything else you want to run on your PC at the same time). The only downside here is that Samsung doesn\u2019t support a ton of apps from the built-in OS for Multi View. You\u2019re mainly limited to YouTube and Samsung TV Plus. Thankfully, you can add the built-in web browser as a source for Multi View, unlocking basically any app you want.\nThe biggest problem with this setup is finding something to occupy the rest of the screen with. In those situations where you can\u2019t fill the full 32:9 aspect ratio, you\u2019ll want something else to fill the remainder of the screen, and it\u2019s possible you won\u2019t have a second source (like a console and PC). Samsung thankfully allows you to mirror the screen on your phone or laptop (Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows are all supported), giving you more options to take advantage of the massive display.\nSmart TV in your monitor\nThe Odyssey OLED G9 isn\u2019t just a monitor. It includes Samsung\u2019s Tizen OS TV operating system, giving you access to streaming apps like Netflix and Hulu, Samsung Game Hub for Xbox Game Pass and GeForce Now, and even some live TV with Samsung TV Plus. That\u2019s not really what\u2019s important here, though.\nYou probably won\u2019t use the built-in apps much \u2014 this is a high-end gaming monitor that you\u2019ll probably connect to a high-end gaming PC \u2014 but the OS opens up Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections. A monitor update is just an option in the menu, not a frustrating process involving a USB drive. And Bluetooth allows you to connect a controller, or a keyboard and mouse, if you want to navigate the OS without the included remote.\nIt opens up a ton of display options,as well. You can quickly access things like Samsung Multi View with the remote through the quick access menu, as well dig into picture settings that you wouldn\u2019t normally find on a monitor\u2019s on-screen display (OSD). Even without features like color calibration with supported smartphones, controlling the monitor this way is leagues ahead of using a traditional OSD.\nSamsung built some hardware for this experiencem as well. The built-in speakers are surprisingly loud, and they do a great job at positioning audio in games with surround sound. You\u2019ll still want dedicated speakers or headphones for the best audio experience, but the speakers sound excellent compared to what you normally find on gaming monitors (if they have speakers at all).\nThe price matters\nThe Odyssey OLED G9 isn\u2019t for everyone. It\u2019s for the most intensive PC gamers, who want peak immersion in games, ample room for productivity, and a feature set that you can\u2019t find anywhere else. The Odyssey OLED G9 delivers on all fronts, all while producing one of the best images you can find on a gaming monitor.\nThose looking for those types of PC experiences know that they usually carry some unforeseen quirks, and the Odyssey OLED G9 is no different. As mentioned, 32:9 doesn\u2019t play nicely with all games, and the deep immersion can quickly be thrown off when a cutscene plays. Still, when the baseline experience is simply what you get with a 16:9 monitor, and the Odyssey OLED G9 can scale so much higher, it\u2019s still a remarkable screen.\nSamsung asks for $1,800 at list price for the display, but I wouldn\u2019t buy it for that much. It\u2019s not so much that it\u2019s overpriced \u2014 there isn\u2019t another monitor quite like this one \u2014 but that it frequently goes on sale. At the time of publishing, it\u2019s available for $1,400, putting it in range of some of the 21:9 QD-OLED monitors we\u2019ve seen. At that price, it\u2019s a steal for high-end PC gamers."

      "text": "You need more than a high refresh rate to earn a spot among the best gaming monitors. There's no shortage of displays that want to hop on the gaming monitor bandwagon, but you shouldn't pick up any display that slaps \"gaming\" on its product packaging. From budget showstoppers to the latest high-end OLED options, we're hear to help you navigate the sometimes murky waters of gaming monitors.\nWe didn't just look at a couple of displays and throw them into a list. Testing gaming displays involves dozens of hours of testing, validation, and comparison to other options, and that's before digging into additional features. Not only have we reviewed countless gaming monitors over the years, we've also used them day in and day out to see if they hold up over time.\nInvesting in one of the best gaming monitors will not only level up your PC or console gaming experience; it'll also set you up for years of upgrades in the future. Your gaming monitor is the last line of defense for a fantastic gaming experience, so carefully consider the options here before making a decision.\nThe best gaming monitor\nHP Omen Transcend 32\n- Fantastic color quality\n- Multi-purpose KVM switch\n- Up to 140W of power delivery\n- Robust on-screen display\n- High peak HDR brightness\n- Massive power brick\n- Poor cable management solution\n| Specification: | |\n| Screen size | 32 inches |\n| Panel type | QD-OLED |\n| Resolution | 3,840 x 2,160 (4K) |\n| Refresh rate | 240Hz |\n| HDR | DisplayHDR True Black 400 |\nThere's no monitor that does it all quite like the HP Omen Transcend 32, and that's why it's the gaming display I recommend most. It's not inexpensive, but HP goes out of its way to pack the Omen Transcend 32 with so many features that the price is easily justified. I've reviewed dozens of monitors packing this same panel, and the fact that this monitor manages to stand out at all is a feat.\nFor the panel itself, it's just about perfect. The monitor produces the widest color coverage I've ever measured, and flew just short of 1,000 nits for the brightest highlights. I was a bit disappointed in the out-of-box color performance, where I measured a color error of just over 1. Still, that's totally usable for most situations, and if you perform some basic calibration, the Omen Transcend 32 can even put extremely color accurate displays like the Alienware 32 QD-OLED to shame.\nBut really, it's everything outside of the panel that makes this monitor stand out. A massive 480-watt power brick offers up 140W through the USB-C input, as well as power to the five additional USB ports available as a hub. This USB hub is incredible. With it, you can use Omen Gear Switch, which allows you to transfer your peripherals between inputs instantly. You can even transfer files between two PCs, which is handled entirely inside the monitor.\nMy favorite feature of the monitor is actually the menu. Seriously. HP gives you a gaming menu and a creator menu, and it allows you essentially store two separate presets on the display. Moreover, it offers some specific settings for each of these use cases, such as the HDR clipping level in creator mode.\nThe best value gaming monitor\nGigabyte M27Q X\n- Excellent price\n- Speedy 240Hz refresh rate\n- 1440p is the sweet spot for PC gaming\n- HDR isn't great\n- Edge-lit lighting can cause some inconsistency\n| Specification: | |\n| Screen size | 27 inches |\n| Panel type | Super Speed IPS |\n| Resolution | 2,560 x 1,440 (1440p) |\n| Refresh rate | 240Hz |\n| HDR | DisplayHDR 400 |\nPrior to upgrading to an OLED display, I used the Gigabyte M27Q, and even now, it remains a secondary monitor that I constantly use. The newer M27Q X takes what made Gigabyte's value-focused 1440p and makes it much better with a speedy 240Hz refresh rate and a Super Speed IPS panel. You really can't ask for much more at this price.\nThe colors and contrast won't blow you away, but the M27Q X goes beyond being just a reasonably-priced monitor. My favorite feature is the KVM switch, which allows you to switch between your PC and the included USB-C input without changing over your peripherals. If you have something like a Steam Deck, the inclusion of a KVM is huge for managing your handheld.\nMy only reservation with the M27Q X is its HDR performance. The monitor comes with a DisplayHDR 400 certification, but it just doesn't get bright enough for proper HDR. You're getting highlights around 400 nits, and a fairly weak contrast ratio. However, if you're willing to sacrifice HDR in games, you're getting an inexpensive monitor that crushes the competition.\nThe best ultrawide gaming monitor\nAlienware 34 QD-OLED\n- QD-OLED contrast is unbeatable\n- Fantastic HDR performance\n- Excellent color saturation\n- Attractive, minimalist design\n- Surprisingly affordable\n- SDR brightness is a bit low\n- Color accuracy isn't perfect\n| Specification: | |\n| Screen size | 34 inches |\n| Panel type | QD-OLED |\n| Resolution | 3,440 x 1,440 |\n| Refresh rate | 175Hz |\n| HDR | DisplayHDR True Black 400 |\nThe Alienware 34 QD-OLED is a certified legend. Our senior editor Luke Larsen was blown away when we first reviewed the monitor, writing that it represented the \"final frontier\" for gaming displays. And even close to two years after the monitor hit store shelves, and even after plenty of alternatives have cropped up, the Alienware 34 QD-OLED remains one of the best gaming displays on the market.\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise, but our testing results were basically perfect. Contrast was infinite, and our tools measured peak brightness well above 1,000 nits. But for me, it really comes down to the color. A glossy coating combined fantastic out-of-the-box color makes for one of the most immersive gaming experiences money can buy, even today. That's why I personally used an Alienware 34 QD-OLED display for so long. It's just tough to beat.\nNow, it's not perfect. Our testing revealed rather weak brightness in SDR, as well as a bit of a color shift toward green, though those are relatively minor issues in the grand scheme of things. The biggest issue with buying the Alienware 34 QD-OLED today is text clarity. It's not bad, but we spotted a touch of color fringing around text when viewed with a microscope. You may not notice it at all, but if you're highly sensitive to those details and plan on viewing a lot of text documents, one of the other options here is a better fit for you.\nEven with those downsides, the Alienware 34 QD-OLED has managed to maintain a spot here over newer OLED displays like the Sony InZone M10S. A big reason for that is that the Alienware 34 QD-OLED is fairly affordable. You can snag it for about $650 on sale, which is unheard of for an OLED gaming display.\nThe best 4K HDR gaming monitor\nSamsung Odyssey Neo G8\n- Fantastic HDR performance\n- 240Hz is great for 4K gaming\n- Solid stand and adjustments\n- Moody CoreSync lighting\n- Vibrant colors, if a little inaccurate\n- FreeSync Premium Pro and unofficial G-Sync support\n- Lazy cable management solution\n- Few gaming PCs can take advantage of refresh rate\n- A few random flickers on Windows desktop\n| Specification: | |\n| Screen size | 32 inches |\n| Panel type | VA |\n| Resolution | 3,840 x 2,160 |\n| Refresh rate | 240Hz |\n| HDR | DisplayHDR 1,000 |\nThe Samsung Odyssey Neo G8 is a monitor that lets you have your cake and eat it, too. While most displays sacrifice image quality for refresh rate, or resolution for price, the Odyssey Neo G8 ticks every box. It's 4K, 240Hz, and comes with some of the best HDR you can get on a gaming monitor short of OLED.\nLocal dimming in over 1,000 zones creates inky blacks and blinding highlights, providing dynamic range that most monitors can't handle. That makes it great for cinematic experiences like Cyberpunk 2077 and Horizon Zero Dawn, pushing HDR to the forefront. It's that \"moody contrast,\" as I called it in my review, that sells the Odyssey Neo G8.\nIt can do competitive games, as well. The 240Hz refresh rate provides better motion clarity than the stock 144Hz refresh rate most gaming monitors offer. It's not the highest refresh rate you can get on a gaming monitor, but considering the resolution and HDR performance, it's an incredible feat. I tested the monitor with Overwatch 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and Rainbow Six Siege, and the display held up well in even the most competitive games.\nWhile this monitor usually costs around $1,500, it is currently selling at a discounted price of $900, which is a deal you shouldn't miss out on.\nThe best mini-LED gaming monitor\nCooler Master Tempest GP27Q\n- Fantastic color performance\n- 576 full-array local dimming zones\n- Wide range of stand adjustments\n- 165Hz refresh rate\n- Adaptive Sync support\n- Weak cable management solution\n- Poor black levels\n| Specification: | |\n| Screen size | 27 inches |\n| Panel type | IPS w/ mini-LED backlight |\n| Resolution | 2,560 x 1,440 (1440p) |\n| Refresh rate | 165Hz |\n| HDR | Yes |\nA few years ago, I would've told you that the Cooler Master Tempest GP27Q is impossible. Flagship HDR performance, G-Sync and FreeSync support, and a 1440p resolution for under $600? The Tempest GP27Q is able to deliver all of that for a low price given emerging mini-LED tech.\nThe smaller lights allow the Tempest GP27Q to deliver 576 full-array local dimming zones, nearly six times as many as the Sony InZone M9. The high local dimming zone count leads to exceptional HDR performance that's normally reserved for monitors that cost over $1,000.\nMy testing revealed excellent performance across the board, offering some of the deepest black levels and brightest highlights you can get in a gaming monitor right now. Cooler Master combines that fantastic HDR performance with a low response time and 165Hz refresh rate, making it a solid, if not perfect, option for competitive games that require lots of motion clarity.\nThere are some trade-offs, though. Most notably, the Tempest GP27Q isn't the most color-accurate monitor I've tested. It's fantastic with HDR turned off, offering world-class color coverage and performance, but color accuracy takes a nosedive with HDR turned on.\nThe best 32:9 gaming monitor\nSamsung Odyssey OLED G9\n- One of the best OLED displays we've tested\n- Unmatched immersive gaming experience\n- Speedy 240Hz refresh rate\n- Dense settings options\n- Full Tizen operating system\n- Massive and expensive\n- 32:9 doesn't play nicely with everything\n| Specification: | |\n| Screen size | 49 inches |\n| Panel type | QD-OLED |\n| Resolution | 5,120 x 1,440 |\n| Refresh rate | 240Hz |\n| HDR | Yes |\nI've never used a monitor quite like the Odyssey OLED G9, and as someone who's reviewed dozens of monitors, that's saying something. The massive 32:9 screen is hard to describe. It wrestles away your senses in games like Alan Wake 2 and Cyberpunk 2077, nearly forcing you to become fully engrossed in whatever game you're playing.\nThe form factor is enough to sell the Odyssey OLED G9, but my testing showed that the panel itself puts out an excellent image. The brightness reaches above 1,000 nits for the brightest highlights, and the colors are great with a color error of just over 1. This is peak OLED image quality, despite the insane aspect ratio.\nI wouldn't recommend the Odyssey OLED G9 for everyone, though. The 32:9 aspect ratio is tough to manage, particularly with 16:9 content. Something like the Omen Transcend 32 is around the same price and better if you don't want to deal with the hassle. For those who liking living on the edge of the best gaming displays, though, the Odyssey OLED G9 is where you want to be.\nThe best budget 1080p gaming monitor\nAsus TUF Gaming VG249Q1A\n- FreeSync Premium Support\n- Fast refresh rate and response time\n- Affordable price\n- Good viewing angles\n- Not the best image quality\n- Basic ergonomics\n| Specification: | |\n| Screen size | 24 inches |\n| Panel type | IPS |\n| Resolution | 1,920 x 1,080 (Full HD) |\n| Refresh rate | 165Hz |\n| HDR | N/A |\nIf you're looking for your first gaming monitor, I'd point you toward the Asus TUF Gaming VG249Q1A. At its current price of $190, you get a 24-inch Full HD panel with a 144Hz refresh rate that can be overclocked to 165Hz. The monitor comes with built-in speakers and also supports FreeSync Premium, enabling adaptive refresh with both Nvidia and AMD GPUs.\nThe monitor also boasts low input lag and excellent response time of 1ms, which are vital for precise aiming and quick reactions in games. The IPS panel ensures good color accuracy right out of the box, though it falls short in brightness and contrast.\nWhile the TUF Gaming VG249Q1A lacks HDMI 2.1 support for the latest consoles, its impressive gaming performance, affordable price, and a three-year warranty make it a compelling choice.\nWhat to consider\nThere are a few areas where gaming monitors differ from other displays, including traditional monitors and TVs. Here are some important areas to pay attention to.\nWhat type of monitor is best for gaming?\nThis very much depends on the type of games you want to play. If you play competitive, fast-paced games, high-refresh-rate monitors are a must as they can reduce input lag and give you a smoother gaming experience. Higher resolutions and HDR are great for more cinematic, AAA experiences, while larger, curved screens add immersion for all sorts of titles.\nWhat is a good size monitor for gaming?\nThe size of your monitor largely depends on what resolution it is. As the screen size gets larger, lower resolutions will become more pronounced. For gaming, we recommend a 24-inch monitor for 1080p, a 27-inch monitor for 1440p, and a 27-inch or larger monitor for 4K.\nKeep in mind the aspect ratio, as well. Ultrawide monitors are wider, and the screen size isn't comparable to a standard 16:9 display. A 34-inch ultrawide monitor isn't as large as a 34-inch 16:9 one.\nDoes response time matter for gaming monitors?\nYes, but not in the way you might assume. Response time on a monitor measures how long it takes from one pixel to transition to a different color, not the input lag. Faster response times provide clearer motion, so a low response time is ideal for gaming.\nCan I use my TV as a gaming monitor?\nYes, you can use a TV as a gaming monitor. TVs have similar options for refresh rates, resolutions, HDR support, and connections like HDMI \u2014 plus, HDMI 2.1 added support for the open Adaptive Sync technology, and some TV brands, like Samsung, support FreeSync as well.\nHowever, TVs are generally much more expensive than monitors, so you will likely end up paying a lot more for similar specifications. TVs may also lack certain modes, menu options, and customization features that monitors have for gaming.\nHow we tested\nWe've reviewed hundreds of monitors over the years, trying to find the best of the best. This involves an in-depth process of not only using the monitor but also pushing it to the limits with various forms of testing. Make sure to read our roundup of how we test monitors for a closer look. This process ensures that when we come out of a monitor review, we know with certainty if it's a product you should buy or not.\nAfter carefully unboxing the monitor, we put it through rigorous color and brightness tests. This process includes looking at both HDR and SDR brightness, total contrast, and color coverage in various color spaces. This pile of data gives us a baseline to compare the monitor with other options, particularly when it comes to multiple monitors using the same panel.\nData isn't everything, though. After digging through the numbers, our process involves using the monitor for everything from gaming to productivity work for about a week. Outside of just coming out with subjective notes, we also engage with the various features available in a display to see if they're worth the price.\nWhy you should trust us\nWe test dozens of gaming monitors each year, most of which are headed up by our lead reporter Jacob Roach. As someone who has spent literally thousands of hours looking at gaming monitors, Jacob knows what separates the wheat from the chaff, as well as how new monitors stand up to the display offerings of years past.\nInstead of just reviewing whatever is the most popular, we try to cover displays from as many brands as possible. Most monitors use only a small set of the same panels, so testing displays from a large variety of brands allows us to close in on what each company offers from its on-screen display to customer service."

      "text": "There are a ton of exciting monitors launching in 2024, and we already have a first taste of them. Following a string of announcements at the beginning of the year, we know about monitors coming from LG, Asus, Acer, MSI, and more, all of which are slated to launch soon.\nWe\u2019re still waiting on pricing and release details for most of these displays, but they\u2019re going to release at some point in 2024. Here are the monitors we\u2019re most looking forward to this year.\nAsus ROG Swift OLED PS27AQDP\nWe\u2019re seeing a slate of new OLED gaming monitors this year, but the ROG Swift OLED PG27AQDP truly stands out. It\u2019s the first OLED display we\u2019ve seen that can hit 480Hz. Even more impressive, the monitor manages to do that at 1440p, doubling the refresh rate of OLED monitors we saw last year like the LG UltraGear OLED 27.\nOn top of the searing refresh rate, Asus claims the monitor can hit 1,300 nits of peak brightness. That\u2019s the highest brightness claim we\u2019ve seen from an OLED monitor \u2014 by far \u2014 and it would be a great step toward changing the narrative around the brightness of OLED displays.\nIt seems Asus has some sort of exclusivity on the display as well. The monitor uses an LG Display OLED panel \u2014 that\u2019s WOLED \u2014 and we haven\u2019t seen another brand leveraging the same panel yet. This one is still a few months out, according to Asus, and it will likely cost a pretty penny. But as far as monitors to get excited about in 2024, this one tops the list.\nLG UltraGear 32GS95UE\nThe ROG Swift OLED PS27AQDP may be the first 480Hz OLED we\u2019re seeing with a 1440p resolution, but the LG UltraGear 32GS95UE can hit that refresh rate, too. This is a 32-inch OLED monitor that tops out at a 4K resolution. It packs LG\u2019s interesting dual refresh rate feature, however, allowing you to change the resolution and refresh rate of the display with a single button.\nIf you need the resolution, you can run the monitor in its native mode. There, you get the full 4K resolution at a speedy 240Hz refresh rate. It\u2019s the OLED monitor gamers have been begging for, with great HDR, low response times, and a full 4K resolution. That\u2019s enough to get excited about, but LG goes further. When you want to sit down and sweat in some Overwatch 2 or Rainbow Six Siege, you can toggle the monitor to 1080p, which boosts the refresh rate to a staggering 480Hz.\nIt\u2019s like having two monitors in one, finally eliminating the trade-off most gamers need to make between resolution and refresh rate. LG has made some bold claims about the panel quality as well. We\u2019re getting OLED, but LG says the monitor can hit 1,300 nits of peak brightness, and that\u2019s seriously impressive.\nHP Omen Transcend 32\nHP isn\u2019t known for high-end gaming monitors, but the Omen Transcend 32 is an impressive first step in that direction. It\u2019s a 32-inch QD-OLED monitor that packs a 4K resolution and 240Hz refresh rate. It\u2019s very similar to Samsung\u2019s 2024 Odyssey OLED G8 \u2014 it even has the same panel \u2014 but the HP stands out with one unique feature: USB-C power delivery.\nThe Omen Transcend 32 supports up to 140 watts over the USB-C connection. That\u2019s huge, and it\u2019s a feature we don\u2019t see often enough in gaming monitors. With it, you can run a gaming laptop to the display with a single cable, providing power to the laptop and data to the display without a cable mess. It\u2019s not enough power to run high-end games, but it\u2019s enough for browsing and lighter titles.\nPower delivery over USB-C is the standout feature here, but it\u2019s important to remember that this is still a 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. We\u2019ve already seen how impressive this panel is in our Alienware 32 QD-OLED review, and I suspect the Omen Transcend 32 will deliver similarly impressive quality.\nMSI MEG 321URX\nThe MSI MEG 321URX is similar to the other monitors we\u2019ve already talked about. It\u2019s a 32-inch, 4K, QD-OLED monitor with a refresh rate of 240Hz. It\u2019s the Samsung QD-OLED panel, just inside an MSI wrapper. That\u2019s not what makes this an exciting monitor, though. MSI packed in an AI processor that can help give you an edge \u2014 you might replace that with \u201ccheat\u201d \u2014 in games like League of Legends.\nIt\u2019s a two-part system. First, there\u2019s a light bar that runs under the front lip of the display. Currently, this uses AI to detect your health in League of Legends, so you\u2019ll see the light slowly drain as your health runs out. Nifty! The more game-breaking application of AI comes with enemy markers, though. The AI processor will track and alert the player of enemy positions off-screen, helping you either track down an enemy or escape to safety.\nAlthough you\u2019re technically not running a cheat, it\u2019s pretty darn close to one. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if it becomes a problem in League of Legends, but MSI is already pushing ahead. The company tells me it plans to train the AI on other competitive titles and to the AI processor to display helpful information on-screen. We won\u2019t have to wait long to see this display in action, either. MSI says it launches in February for $1,200.\nAsus ZenScreen Fold OLED MQ17QH\nWe\u2019ve seen OLED monitors, but have you ever seen a foldable OLED monitor? That\u2019s what Asus is cooking up with the ZenScreen Fold OLED MQ17QH. It\u2019s a 17-inch OLED display, but you can fold it in half into a 12.5-inch package. And, coming in at just 2.5 pounds, it\u2019s easy to slot into a backpack and take on the go with you.\nThere are plenty of portable monitors, but none with the quality of OLED backing them up. This display comes with 100% coverage of the DCI-P3 color space, according to Asus, and it\u2019s certified with DisplayHDR True Black 500. Asus also offers auto rotation through the DisplayWidget Center app, so you can use the monitor as one large portable display, or two smaller displays for multitasking.\nAs for actually setting up the monitor, Asus includes a hefty kickstand that\u2019s built into the display, which lets you set it up either vertically or horizontally. The display also comes with a tripod mount built in, letting you either set it up on a tripod or on Asus\u2019 own ZenScreen Stand.\nAcer Predator SpatialLabs View 27\nAttempts at glasses-free 3D monitors have fallen flat over the last several years, but Acer has something seriously special on its hands with the Predator SpatialLabs View 27. It\u2019s the result of the SpatialLabs feature Acer has been working on over the past year for some gaming laptops, and the tech is finally at a point where it\u2019s usable.\nUnlike most glasses-free 3D monitors, this one has a wide sweet spot. You don\u2019t have to hunt for the 3D. That\u2019s likely due to how large the screen is, and the fact that Acer implements head and eye tracking to perform the 3D calculation. In addition, Acer is working with game developers to add support for the 3D tech. Currently, 113 games are supported, and the number is growing.\nWe\u2019re looking forward to this display because it\u2019s an impressive demonstration of tech that\u2019s been around for years, but it\u2019s definitely not the screen for everyone. Acer says it\u2019s launching in the first half of this year, but at $2,000, making it\u2019s a tough sell for such niche tech."

      "text": "If you\u2019ve been shopping the best laptop deals and want to add some screen real estate to your new setup, or if you otherwise have a need to expand your digital workspace, you\u2019re going to need a new monitor. The best monitors always make great options, but if you want something ultimate yet efficient when it comes to screen space, you\u2019re going to want an ultrawide monitor. There are a lot of ultrawide monitors available, each built to be suitable for different needs and for different price points. We\u2019ve tracked down what we feel are the best ultrawide monitors for 2024. Our selections include the best ultrawide monitor for gaming, the best ultrawide monitor for work, and the best ultrawide monitor on a budget, so read onward for more details.\nDell is one of the most popular names in computing. It\u2019s almost always one of the best laptop brands, and this Dell utlrawide monitor makes a good pairing with any of the best laptops. It comes in at 34-inches and QHD resolution, which is halfway between Full HD and 4K resolution. It offers a ton of screen real estate for multitasking and watching content at a price point that falls in the price range of many of the best budget monitors. We think this is the best ultrawide monitor for work because of its versatility and range of features, but with a 144Hz refresh rate it could sneak in some gaming between meetings.\nIf you\u2019re here because you\u2019re looking to take on some of the best PC games with a new display, the best ultrawide monitor for gaming is the ASUS ROG Strix. This 34-inch model offers a super fast 180Hz refresh that ensures your gameplay won\u2019t be interrupted by image tearing or lag, and the display checks in at 400 nits of brightness, whicih will allow you to see the display even in bright rooms. This monitor has a USB-C hub that supports both video transmission and charging, which makes it a great monitor to pair with one of the best gaming laptops.\nWith ultrawide monitors 4K resolution can be a little more difficult to come by, as their expansive width doesn\u2019t always make the appropriate dimensions for high quality 4K. The LG 40WP95C-W, however, offers both 4K resolution and screen real estate, as it comes in at 40 inches. It\u2019s also capable of producing colors across the DCI P3 color gamut with HDR10 technology built in, so you\u2019ll be getting a premium visual experience with this monitor. It has Thunderbolt 4 connectivity with 96-watt power delivery, making it an excellent option for pairing with both laptops and desktop computers.\nASUS\u2019s lineup of ProArt monitors are incredibly popular among artists and other creators. They offer a great price point for a high quality image, and with this 34-inch ultrawide you\u2019re getting the same. You\u2019ll be getting a lot of features that are highly sought after by creatives with this ultrawide monitor, including P3 color, wide viewing angles, Calman Verified factory calibration, and USB-C connectivity with 90 watts of power delivery. It comes with a huge variety of ports, including DisplayPort, HDMI, and USB, so you should be able to connect all of your creative peripherals with no issues.\nIf you\u2019re simply looking to get into the ultrawide game and don\u2019t have much need for the highest screen resolution or ultimate connectivity, the LG 29WQ600-W is the ultrawide for you. It\u2019s the best ultrawide monitor for a budget, yet still has a lot to offer. It doesn\u2019t have 4K resolution, but it still comes in at Full HD resolution, which has been the standard for nearly two decades, and will hold up awhile longer, particularly for office and school uses. The screen comes in at 29 inches, which still makes it larger than most monitors on the market, and it even has a 100Hz refresh rate, which should come in handy if you\u2019re looking to do a little gaming on the cheap as well.\nFrom researching to writing and with some of our own hobbyist gaming adventures in between, we often find ourselves with a lot of tabs, programs, and windows open. This has given us a lot of experience using ultrawide monitors, as their general nature comes in handy for our daily computer interactions. This gives us a leg up when it comes to the terrain, and all of our selections for the best ultrawide monitors have been made utilizing that advantage.\nWe\u2019ve chosen the best ultrawide monitors while considering price and our own expertise from both using and writing about utlrawide monitors, with preference given to more recent releases. Screen resolution isn\u2019t as important in an ultrawide monitor as it might be fore some of the best monitors in general, as you\u2019re getting a lot of screen real estate no matter the display\u2019s pixel dimensions. But a sharp image is important, so our selections have also been made with an attempt at harmony between picture quality, refresh rate, connectivity options, and affordability.\nThis article is managed and created separately from the Digital Trends Editorial team.\nIf you accidentally delete important files or photos, your hard drive crashes, or some glitch damaged data on your SSD, all hope is seemingly lost. Fortunately, advanced data recovery software exists that may help get your data back.\nIt's important to stop using the faulty drive, if possible. The only time you should use it is during the recovery process. After you've extracted as many files as you can, you can try reformatting the drive to test if it's still usable.\nEaseUS Data Recovery Wizard\nThese were the 5 most exciting monitors I saw at Computex 2024\nAlthough Computex 2024 was focused on groundbreaking CPU announcements like Intel's Lunar Lake and AMD's Ryzen 9000 CPUs, there were plenty of other things to see at the show. Among the most prominent were gaming monitors, with brands like Cooler Master, Acer, and Asus showing off some stunning new displays.\nI've been wandering the streets of Taipei, Taiwan, looking for the best gaming monitors of Computex 2024.
