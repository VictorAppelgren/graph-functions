  "content": "Home Assistant 2025.9 has been released with an experimental new home dashboard. The update is also coming with a reimagined automation editor and a bunch of new features for the versatile tile card, like trends and temperature monitoring in graphs.\n\nOne of the most significant changes in this release is the introduction of a sidebar for the automation editor. As part of a larger roadmap to make automations easier to create, this new interface lets you maintain a full overview of your automation on the left side of the screen while a sidebar on the right provides a dedicated space to tweak the settings of a selected item.\n\nThis change comes with a bottom-up sheet on mobile devices, which makes it much easier to read and simplifies the process of building complex automations. The automation editor has also received other quality-of-life improvements, including subtle styling changes with lines and borders to better group elements, as well as the addition of drag-and-drop support on mobile devices.\n\nAnother major development in 2025.9 is a new experimental Home dashboard. It has quick navigation to summaries for lights, climate, security, and media devices, as well as the ability to browse through home areas. I like the new \"Favorites\" feature that lets you pin any entity, from a light to a person, to the top of the dashboard for quick access. It also includes basic insights such as weather and energy cards, with plans to expand its functionality to help users create their first automations or discover new devices.\n\nDon't worry if you don't want this feature until it's ready. The home dashboard is an experimental opt-in feature, so when it finally becomes the new default dashboard, it should be a polished experience.\n\nThe tile card's features are also getting a lot of new options. A standout addition is the trend chart feature, which shows a quick graph of an entity's history over the past 24 hours directly on the tile. Other new features are media player controls for volume and playback, a bar gauge for entities with a percentage unit of measurement, and controls for fan direction and oscillation.\n\nThere are also buttons for automation, script, and button entities that have been added, so you can customize text display. You can now control the open/close and position of valves and even set the date for date and time entities directly from a tile card. It's a real improvement for anyone who uses Home Assistant to the fullest. Besides all these core features, the Home Assistant 2025.9 comes with many new integrations, like Aladdin Connect for garage doors, SEKO PoolDose for water treatment systems, Sleep as Android for alarm clock automations, and ToGrill Bluetooth BBQ thermometers.\n\nIf you're interested, the update is available now for Home Assistant servers, and you can check the official website for instructions on new installations.",

      "text": "2025.9: Features for tiles and automations for miles\nHome Assistant 2025.9! \ud83c\udf89\nBut before we dive into this release: Did you see we launched a new product? \ud83d\udc40\nWe\u2019ve introduced the Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2, the ultimate way to connect Z-Wave devices to Home Assistant. You can read all about it in our announcement blog \ud83d\udcf0 or re-watch the product launch live stream on YouTube \ud83d\udcfa\nIt was a busy month, as we also had two new Works with Home Assistant\nWhile the above was happening this month, as if the project wasn\u2019t already busy enough, we kept on pushing to prepare for this release; and it is an absolute massive one! \ud83e\udd2f\nThis month introduces a new experimental Home dashboard, which aims to become the new default dashboard for Home Assistant in a future release. A first iteration, of which we love to see your feedback and input on. As you know, we develop and iterate in the open. Give it a shot and let us know what you think!\nTalking about dashboards, my personal favorite card is definitely the tile card; it is just so versatile. And this release brings in a staggering amount of new features for it! Most notably, the ability to add a trend graph to the tile card! \ud83d\udcc8\nI\u2019m the most excited about the visual changes to the automation editor this release brings: a sidebar. It is a huge and very visible change, that just makes so much sense. This release denotes the start of a whole series of improvements to the automation editor in this, and upcoming releases. As automations make a smart home feel magical, I personally can\u2019t wait to see how this evolves. \ud83e\udd16\nEnjoy the release!\n../Frenck\n- Automation editor sidebar\n- Introducing the Home dashboard\n- New tile card features\n- Integrations\n- Other noteworthy changes\n- Need help? Join the community!\n- Backward-incompatible changes\n- All changes\nAutomation editor sidebar\nOn this year\u2019s Home Assistant roadmap, we have set the goal of making automations easier to create. We have big plans, all based on tons of research, and with this release\u2026 we are shipping the first part of all this work, with the intent to gradually add more improvements over multiple releases!\nThis release tweaks the automation editor user interface experience by introducing a sidebar! If you select an item in your automation, instead of that item expanding, it will open a new sidebar to the right with the settings for that selected item.\nThis allows you to keep an overview of your automation on the left side of your screen, while you can tweak its behavior on the right. Of course, we have thought of smaller screens as well. On mobile, instead of the sidebar, a sheet will pop up at the bottom of the screen. This pop-up is also resizable, making it easier than ever to edit an action while reviewing your triggers.\nBesides the sidebar, we have made tons of other little improvements as well. Tiny layout and styling changes that you will definitely notice as they really help with the overall readability. For example, small lines and borders around grouped elements have been added, making it easier to distinguish between different parts of your automation. Oh! And drag-and-drop support is now available on mobile! \ud83c\udf89\nOne of Home Assistant\u2019s greatest strengths is our community. We\u2019re building the changes to our automations together, and your input will shape where it goes next. There are two ways to get involved:\nIntroducing the Home dashboard\nOver the past year, we have focused on dashboards and their capabilities a lot. We\u2019ve looked at a lot of your dashboards you\u2019ve shared on socials, and talked to many of you about how you organize all your smart home devices and services. The goal? Making dashboards faster and easier to create, while still making them very customizable.\nWith this release, we\u2019re introducing a brand-new Home dashboard. The purpose is simple: to give you easy access to the right information at the right time.\nThe dashboard adapts to your Home Assistant experience level: powerful enough for advanced users, yet approachable for newcomers. We\u2019re working to have it earn its name, and hope it will eventually become your new Home page. As always, it\u2019s optional; you can always pick your own dashboard. This is the first iteration, and we\u2019ll continue developing it in the open.\nWhen you first open the Home dashboard, it gives you a quick way to navigate to useful summaries for your light, climate, security, and media devices. You can also browse by areas, getting an overview of all the devices and services associated with that part of your home.\nWe\u2019re also introducing Favorites. You can pin any entity to the top, whether it\u2019s a light, climate, or a person. We\u2019d love to see what you choose (more on this in the future).\nThe Home dashboard is not just about quick control. It also brings insights and information about your home. This first release includes weather and energy cards. It\u2019s a simple start, and we have a lot of ideas to explore with you. For example, helping you create your first automation, or show discovered devices.\nFor now, the Home dashboard is considered experimental. Configuration options are limited, and it\u2019s guaranteed to evolve. It won\u2019t appear automatically, and if you want to try it you\u2019ll need to add it manually in the dashboard settings, by adding a new \u201cHome\u201d dashboard.\nOne of Home Assistant\u2019s greatest strengths is our community. We\u2019re building this dashboard together, and your input will shape where it goes next. There are two ways to get involved:\nNew tile card features\nThe tile card is the most versatile card we have in our arsenal of cards for our dashboards.\nOne superpower of the tile card is its \u201cfeatures\u201d, which are small additions where you can add quick interactions to these cards. For example, a slider to control the brightness of a light or buttons for the speed presets of a fan. Features have been extended quite a bit in this release by a dedicated group of community members.\nTrend chart\nThis release, an absolute banger is the addition of the trend chart features for tile cards created by @MindFreeze\nThis feature adds a handy quick graph to the tile card, showing the history of a specific entity over time. For this initial version, the time window shown is 24 hours.\nMedia player controls\n@timmo001\nBar gauge\nA new tile card feature, made by @MindFreeze\nFor this initial version, it works with sensors that use a percentage (%\n) for their unit of measurement.\nThis makes the card great, for example, for a battery overview dashboard. Nice work!\nFan direction and oscillation controls\nThanks to @pcan08\nButtons\nThanks to @dhoeben\nValve open/close and position controls\nThanks to @timmo001\nSetting the date\n@timmo001\nIntegrations\nThanks to our community for keeping pace with the new integrationsIntegrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.

Sign up for the Open Home Foundation Newsletter to get the latest news about features, things happening in our community, and other projects that support the Open Home straight into your inbox.\nBackward-incompatible changes\nWe do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes, it is inevitable.\nWe always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:\nEncoding units containing the \u03bc character\nThe encoding for some units that contain the \u03bc character has been changed. Users that consume state data from sensors that have changed units will be impacted (such as exported state data to InfluxDB). The units with a changed encoding are:\n-\n\u03bcSv/h\nfor thearanet\nintegration as a unit for radiation rate -\n\u03bcS/cm\nforUnitOfConductivity.MICROSIEMENS_PER_CM\n-\n\u03bcV\nforUnitOfElectricPotential.MICROVOLT\n-\n\u03bcg/ft\u00b3\nfor concentration in micrograms per cubic foot -\n\u03bcg/m\u00b3\nfor concentration in micrograms per cubic meter -\n\u03bcmol/s\u22c5m\u00b2\nfor thefyta\nintegration as a unit for light -\n\u03bcg\nforUnitOfMass.MICROGRAMS\n-\n\u03bcs\nforUnitOfTime.MICROSECONDS\n1-Wire\nThe raw_value\nattribute was previously deprecated and has now been removed.\nAlexa Devices\nThe sound list has been updated to match the one used by the Alexa Mobile app.\nThe variant\nparameter is no longer required.\nCheck your automations to ensure the selected sound is still present.\n(@chemelli74\nHusqvarna Automower BLE\nThe integration now requires the Automower PIN when being set up. This ensures Home Assistant can communicate with more models of mowers and with higher security levels.\n(@alistair23\nKNX\nKNX scene entities now also change their state when a scene was activated externally (from bus). Previously they only updated when activated from within Home Assistant.\n(@farmio\nSIA Alarm Systems\nSIA alarm status code CF (armed with malfunctions) is now mapped to armed_away\ninstead of to armed_custom_bypass\n.\n(@etnoy\nSwitchBot Bluetooth\nThe battery property on vacuum entities is being removed in Home Assistant. Therefore, this property is now removed from this integration and is replaced by a battery level sensor.\nPlease review your automations, scripts, and dashboards using the battery property and update the code to use the battery sensor instead.\nYale August\nThe August integration now uses OAuth authentication with Yale August\u2019s official API. This is a required one-time breaking change as the unofficial authentication method will stop working soon. This migration helps reduce unnecessary load on Yale August\u2019s servers while ensuring continued access for all users.\nWhen you update Home Assistant, you\u2019ll be prompted to re-authenticate your August account:\n- Select the notification or go to Settings \u2192 Devices & Services \u2192 August\n- Select \u201cReconfigure\u201d and follow the OAuth flow to sign in\n- Once authenticated, your devices will work exactly as before\nWe\u2019re grateful to Yale August for officially supporting Home Assistant with dedicated API access!\n(@bdraco\nIf you are a custom integration developer and want to learn about changes and new features available for your integration: Be sure to follow our developer blog. The following changes are the most notable for this release:\n- Standardize encoding of \u03bc in units of measurement\n- The DeviceEntry.suggested_area attribute is deprecated and will be removed\nAll changes\nOf course, there is a lot more in this release.
