  "content": "Wolves are still looking for their first points and goals of the Premier League season ahead of their meeting with Everton at Molineux on Saturday (kick-off, 3pm). But their wait may continue, with the visitors tipped to record a victory on the road.\n\nOdds courtesy of Paddy Power.

That scoreline was repeated against Mansfield Town four days later, a result that booked another visit to Molineux in the third round of the EFL Cup.\n\nThe club also secured the signing of talented winger Tyler Dibling from Southampton, while left-back Vitalii Mykolenko returned from injury. Along with the attacking impetus already evidenced by Jack Grealish and Iliman Ndiaye, there are already more reasons to be cheerful than fearful.\n\nUnfortunately for Wolves fans, the same can\u2019t be said for their side. They\u2019re goalless and pointless in the league after defeats by Manchester City and Bournemouth, and a dramatic 3-2 comeback win over West Ham United in the League Cup isn\u2019t likely to brighten the mood too much.\n\nDefensive frailties from the previous campaign have resurfaced, with five goals shipped \u2013 a tally that could easily have been more, while centre-back Toti was sent off against Bournemouth. Vitor Pereira saw his team concede 69 goals last term, the highest tally of the non-relegated clubs.\n\nIt\u2019s not just at the back where there\u2019s cause for concern. Last season\u2019s top scorer Matheus Cunha was sold to Manchester United and striker Jorgen Strand Larsen looks set to follow. He scored 14 goals last term and has been the subject of several bids from Newcastle United.\n\nNow winless in six games dating back to the end of last season, Wolves host an Everton side who have won five of their 10 away league games since Moyes\u2019 return. They have suffered just three defeats in that time, two of which were against Liverpool and Chelsea.\n\nEverton appear overpriced at 15/8 to exploit the problems at Molineux and we\u2019re backing them to take all three points.\n\nDewsbury-Hall in the thick of the action\n\nKiernan Dewsbury-Hall looks set to be central to Everton\u2019s ambitions this season. The midfielder moved from Chelsea in the summer and has had a key impact on the Toffees\u2019 two games so far.\n\nThe former Leicester City man was deployed in a more advanced role on Sunday against Brighton, against whom he played four key passes and had 58 touches of the ball, both of which improved on the figures for his debut at Leeds.\n\nAt the same time, he lost possession on 10 occasions, conceded a penalty, gave away two fouls and was booked late on by referee Stuart Attwell. What\u2019s very clear for all to see is that Dewsbury-Hall is going to be heavily involved at both ends of the pitch.\n\nAs Everton are likely to field an unchanged team from the win over Brighton, the 2/1 on offer for Dewsbury-Hall to commit two fouls again is interesting.\n\nWith 19 losses of possession over two games and 12 ground duel involvements, you can be sure he won\u2019t be far from the centre of the battle.\n\nAll odds courtesy of Paddy Power.
