  "title": "WWE Clash In Paris 2025: Winners And Losers From A Full Week",
  "description": "After a full week of international shows, who walked away from WWE Clash in Paris and TV with the most momentum?",
  "content": "WWE took over Paris, France for a full slate of shows, from Raw to live events, headlined by the city\u2019s first-ever Premium Live Event, Clash in Paris.\n\nWhile a raucous crowd was arguably the highlight of the weekend, plenty of matches stood out and made waves across WWE\u2019s landscape as the company shifts PLEs to ESPN\u2019s streaming service and braces for the end of the road of one of its greatest stars.\n\nAs Clash in Paris brought its share of highs and lows, here\u2019s a look at the biggest winners and losers from a landmark week for WWE.\n\nSince returning to WWE, the Bulgarian Brute had been meandering. He struggled to find his place with the upper card already solidified and the midcard crowded and with minimal matches on PLEs that limited his opportunities.\n\nBut Rusev has special chemistry with Sheamus, two of WWE\u2019s hardest hitters. They\u2019ve delivered almost every match they\u2019ve wrestled, so WWE booked them in a blowoff match at Clash in Paris, a Donnybrook Match, which is essentially a No Disqualification match.\n\nRusev is definitely on the upswing entering the fall. The question now is how high WWE will let him climb, and whether championship gold could be in his future.\n\nNot long ago, the Street Profits were tag team royalty in WWE. Together for nearly a decade, Montez Ford and Angelo Dawkins have consistently been one of the company\u2019s most popular and entertaining duos. But on SmackDown, seeds have been planted in their feud with the Wyatt Sicks that could drive a wedge between them.\n\nAt Clash in Paris, things looked off as they lost a WWE Tag Team Championship opportunity, further cementing their place outside the top of the division. Right now, they\u2019re a few steps back from true contender status given recent booking.\n\nThere\u2019s no clear heat yet for a Dawkins vs. Ford singles feud, but if the split isn\u2019t amicable, it could evolve into a compelling rivalry. Still, Ford has long been pegged as the breakout star, thanks to his charisma and in-ring ability. The bigger question is how WWE will handle both men as singles competitors, a story that could become one of the year\u2019s most intriguing.\n\nWWE\u2019s weekend in Paris was arguably the Becky Lynch show, and for good reason. From her full day at the PLE, which included defeating Nikki Bella, to being the cause for the main event finish to rekindle her on-screen alliance with her real-life husband, Seth Rollins, Lynch made her presence felt. She then appeared on Raw to go face-to-face and mic-to-mic with CM Punk, seemingly teasing the long-awaited return of AJ Lee.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of the refresh for Lynch since returning to WWE earlier this year after a hiatus, when she was in need of something new. Her previous alignment with Rollins didn\u2019t create much fanfare, but it\u2019s now clear that WWE is building Monday nights around the husband-and-wife duo. And if WWE is setting up a showdown between Lynch and Lee, the Irishwoman will have her plate full for the rest of 2025 and into the new year.\n\nJey Uso and LA Knight remain deeply embroiled with the Vision, continuing the story built before Clash in Paris and likely leading into Wrestlepalooza. Uso seems headed toward reuniting with his brother, Jimmy, for a match against Bronson Reed and Bron Breakker.\n\nKnight\u2019s direction is less clear. He\u2019s been edging toward a heel turn over the past month, from tense interactions with CM Punk to being left laid out after declaring he was tired of that very outcome. It\u2019s movement, but more of a mixed bag than a clear trajectory.\n\nIf WWE does pull the trigger on turning Knight heel, though, they risk undercutting one of their most popular babyfaces. The crowd could be left uncertain whether to boo or continue cheering, creating an awkward dynamic. It\u2019s been a slow-burn build rather than an overnight shift, but it\u2019s still a risky move that could derail the momentum of one of WWE\u2019s consistently over stars.\n\nIt\u2019s a no-brainer to include John Cena as a \u201cwinner\u201d of the weekend in Paris. He essentially bullied Logan Paul on the microphone leading up to their match, proving his gift of gab hasn\u2019t gone anywhere. That edge was missed during much of his heel run, aside from his version of the \u201cpipe bomb\u201d promo on CM Punk earlier this summer.\n\nThe 17-time world champion then delivered a strong match with the social media star, marking his second consecutive standout PLE performance after it once seemed like he had lost a step. The bout even included an homage to one of his greatest rivals, AJ Styles, a clash fans may never see again before Cena retires, barring a surprise development.\n\nAll signs point to Brock Lesnar being next for Cena, but the long-term direction remains unclear. With December approaching and Wrestlepalooza looming, WWE could use another loss to set up an undefined feud. For now, Cena is undoubtedly a winner, but the rest of his run feels very much up in the air.",

      "text": "WWE Clash in Paris 2025 put four of Raw\u2019s biggest stars in the ring at once, with Seth Rollins laying his World Heavyweight title on the line against CM Punk, Jey Uso and LA Knight.\nOver the past several weeks, Rollins has emerged as the target of three of WWE\u2019s most popular babyfaces. In addition to rekindling his epic rivalry with Punk, he suffered a loss to Knight at Saturday Night\u2019s Main Event and then found himself targeted by Uso, the former World Heavyweight Champion.\nThat led to a rare Fatal 4-Way at WWE Clash in Paris 2025, where less than a month after becoming world champion once again, Rollins had to defend his title against a trio of fellow main eventers.\nWWE Clash in Paris 2025 Results for Seth Rollins vs. Jey Uso Vs. CM Punk vs. LA Knight\nAt WWE Clash in Paris 2025, the odds were seemingly stacked against Rollins. Or so we thought.\nRollins had to overcome Punk, Knight and Uso, and earlier in the night, Raw General Manager Adam Pearce banned Bronson Reed and Bron Breakker, Rollins\u2019 stablemates from The Vision, from the arena. Still, Rollins was able to use the numbers game to his advantage to secure the win in Paris. \u201cThe Visionary\u201d pinned Punk after a shocking reveal from Becky Lynch, who showed up with a huge assist in the main event.\nAmong the biggest highlights of his World Heavyweight Championship defense at WWE Clash in Paris 2025 were:\n- Punk immediately hit Uso with a kick to the jaw to start the match. Knight tried to steal the victory on Punk with a quick roll-up.\n- Uso nailed a crossbody block on Rollins off the top rope, then ran into a clothesline by Punk. Rollins pulled Punk out of the ring and tossed him into the barricade. Rollins hit a running knee on Uso, then got hit by a series of punches from both Uso and Knight.\n- Uso hit a Samoan drop on Knight, then Rollins hit a running hip splash on Knight as well. The three babyfaces took turns working over Rollins with a barrage of running attacks in the corner before agreeing to try to put Rollins through a table on the outside. Before they could, Uso hit a Superkick on Punk out of nowhere, and Knight clotheslined Rollins. Uso then superkicked Knight as well.\n- They all battled into the crowd before returning into the ring, where Punk mounted his typical comeback on Rollins. Uso entered the ring and took out both men. Knight entered last and hit Uso with a burning hammer before taking a shining wizard from Punk, who found himself on the receiving end of a Pedigree from Rollins.\n- Rollins hit a buckle bomb on Knight and a frog splash on Jey, taking control of the match. Knight turned things around with a comeback on Rollins, capped off with a leg sweep on Rollins, a backbreaker on Uso and a bodyslam on Punk. Knight hit a huge flying elbow off the middle rope onto Rollins.\n- Knight then ate a Superkick from Uso. Moments later, Knight sent Punk crashing through a table, avoided a Stomp by Rollins and nearly won the match with a BFT on Rollins before Uso broke up the pin. Uso and Knight exchanged punches as the crowd erupted in chants of \u201cYeet\u201d and \u201cYeah!\u201d\n- Knight was able to take out both Uso and Rollins on the outside. Knight set up Rollins on the announce table and went for a flying elbow dropped, but Rollns moved out and Knight went crashing through the table. Uso hit a dive on Rollins, then got hit with a Superkick. Uso hit Rollins with a Superkick and went for a spear, but Rollins reversed into a Pedigree for a two-count.\n- Rollins went for a Phoenix Splash, but Uso moved and hit Rollins with a Superkick and a spear. Uso went up top for a plash and nailed it. Punk broke it up with a top rope elbow drop and hit Uso with a GTS. Rollins broke it up with a Stomp on Punk, who shockingly kicked out, and then he nailed both Uso and Knight with Stomps on the outside.\n- Back in the ring, Rollins went for a Stomp on Punk on a chair, Punk moved and hit Rollins with a GTS. Rollins collapsed onto Punk\u2019s shoulder, and Punk went for another GTS. Suddenly, a masked person came out of nowhere and low-blowed Punk. It turned out to be none other than Becky Lynch, who took off her mask.\n- That allowed Rollins to hit Punk with a Stomp and pin him for the 1-2-3.\nRollins was widely expected to leave Clash in Paris as World Heavyweight Champion after winning the title less than one month ago, and that\u2019s precisely what he did.\nWWE Clash in Paris 2025 Results: What\u2019s Next for Seth Rollins and CM Punk?\nWith Rollins pinning Punk at WWE Clash in Paris 2025 following the interference from Lynch, all three of Rollins\u2019 opponents can lay claim to another match with Rollins. In reality, though, that outcome means that the World Heavyweight Champion likely isn\u2019t done with two superstars: Knight and Punk.\nFor much of the past two years, Rollins and Punk have seemingly been attached at the hip. Prior to Clash in Paris, Rollins ruined Punk\u2019s storybook world title win at SummerSlam when he cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase on Punk mere minutes later. Technically, Punk got his rematch at Clash in Paris, but it wasn\u2019t a standard singles match.\nOf course, WWE is clearly building toward another singles bout between Punk and Rollins. That could come as soon as at WrestlePalooza next month, a returning event that is expected to be a massive spectacle on ESPN. Punk vs. Rollins would fit the bill as a main event level match on a show that is also expected to feature John Cena vs. Brock Lesnar as well as a WWE Championship match between Cody Rhodes and Drew McIntyre.\nLikewise, Knight has a legitimate gripe to push for another World title match himself. He beat Rollins in non-title action just a couple of months ago, and he only lost his recent World Heavyweight Championship match against Rollins via disqualification after Punk attacked Rollins. In other words, Knight should get a third and final rubber match, too.\nAlthough Rollins left Clash in Paris with his title, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s put either Knight or Punk in the rearview mirror. In fact, they probably aren\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon. Rollins vs. Punk may very well extend into 2026 and WrestleMania season while Knight shouldn\u2019t be cast aside either.\nAfter Lynch\u2019s shocking alignment with Rollins at Clash in Paris, the dream scenario is for Rollins and Lynch to take on Punk and a returning AJ Lee, Punk\u2019s real-life wife, but a dream scenario is all that is. At least for now."
