  "content": "China dialed up its injection of longer term liquidity into its financial system in a move that\u2019s likely intended at easing the selloff in bonds and ensuring adequate funding for the flailing economy.\n\u2022 We Need a Reality Check on Crime, Safety and Transit\n\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China added a net 600 billion yuan ($84 billion) via its one-year medium-term facility as well as three and six-month outright reverse repos this month, the most since January, as per Bloomberg calculations. China\u2019s overnight money market rate fell while bond futures rose in response to the move.\n\nThe measures underscore Beijing\u2019s desire to retain stable funding conditions and facilitate government borrowing, after investors demanded the highest yields since December at a 30-year auction. It could also cool any redemption pressure on bond funds and avert spiraling losses as investors rush to buy stocks.\n\nThe PBOC will keep up its longer-term liquidity injections to ensure smooth issuance of government bonds and to foster an increase in bank loans, said Wang Qing, chief macro analyst at Golden Credit Rating Co. It \u201creassures market of a growth-supportive monetary policy stance.\u201d\n\nThe PBOC indicated it\u2019s holding back from aggressively easing monetary policy with moves such as interest-rate cuts, but pledged targeted support for the economy. Policymakers have also been cautious of using more forceful easing measures like \u2014 cutting the amount of cash banks need to keep as reserve, or purchasing government bonds \u2014 amid its efforts to quell deflation.\n\nThat along with a tax on bonds\u2019 interest income has weighed on investor appetite for sovereign debt. However, the central bank has been making a steady stream of short-term cash infusions to support the market.\n\nLiquidity injections via MLF and outright reverse repo, the main instruments in PBOC\u2019s toolkit after an overhaul earlier this year, are likely to help the central bank maintain ample cash conditions to support growth. That\u2019s especially at a time when the relentless rally in stocks threatens to draw funds from household savings at banks and induce liquidity stress.\n\nChina\u2019s overnight repo rate fell seven basis points to 1.35% on Monday. Futures on 30-year bonds rose as much as 0.7%, their biggest gain since April.\n\u2022 Taco Bell\u2019s Not-So-Secret Sauce: An Endless Stream of New Stuff\n\u2022 Staff Cuts and Turmoil Hit the CFTC While the Crypto It Oversees Booms\n\u2022 Foreigners Are Buying US Homes Again While Americans Get Sidelined\n\u2022 Women\u2019s Earnings Never Really Recover After They Have Children",
