  "title": "Florida and Texas could see more Congressional seats if Trump census order moves forward",
  "description": "President Donald Trump said he is calling for another census amid heated state vs. state battles on Congressional maps. What would happen in Florida?",
  "content": "\u2022 Trump wants a new census conducted before the next scheduled one in 2030, citing the need for updated data and the exclusion of undocumented immigrants.\n\u2022 Florida, among other states, was undercounted in the 2020 Census and has experienced significant population growth since then.\n\u2022 A mid-decade census could impact congressional redistricting, potentially benefiting states like Florida and Texas.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said on Aug. 7 that he wants his administration to run a new census, which usually only happens at the turn of the decade.\n\nStates around the country are in a bit of a standoff over Congressional districts after the Texas legislature sought to redraw their maps to add more Republican seats, causing Democratic officials to flee the state to prevent a vote on the map. Democratic heavy-weight states like California and New York have said they are poised to counter with their own redistricting if Texas moves forward.\n\n\"I have instructed our Department of Commerce to immediately begin work on a new and highly accurate CENSUS based on modern day facts and figures and, importantly, using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024,\" Trump said in the post. \"People who are in our Country illegally WILL NOT BE COUNTED IN THE CENSUS.\"\n\nAs previously reported by USA TODAY, Florida could gain Congressional seats if a mid-decade census moves forward. Here is what to know:\n\nHow often is the census taken normally?\n\nThe U.S. Constitution calls for the census to be conducted every 10 years, and in years that end in zero, most recently in 2020. The U.S. Census Bureau, part of the Commerce Department, carries out these resource-intensive surveys and hires temporary staff to conduct outreach to count as many people as possible.\n\nThe survey results are used to decide how seats in the U.S. House of Representatives are distributed to each state based on its population, a process called apportionment. Those processes usually take place in the first two years of a decade.\n\nThe survey results are also used to determine how much federal funding is distributed to states, and researchers widely cite the demographic research to understand the country.\n\nFlorida and 5 other states undercounted in the 2020 Census\n\nA 2022 report from the U.S. Census Bureau found that 14 states had statistically significant differences between the bureau's count and the actual population. States that were undercounted were:\n\nFlorida gained one Congressional seat after the 2020 Census.\n\nBy how much was Florida undercounted in the 2020 Census?\n\nIn the 2020 Census, the bureau estimated it undercounted the population by 3.84%, the fourth most drastic undercount of all of the states. WUSF reported that about 750,000 residents went uncounted statewide.\n\nPlus, Florida has seen rapid population growth in recent years. Since 2020, Florida's population has grown by approximately 1.8 million from July 2020 to July 2024, an increase of 8.24%, according to the Census Bureau Vintage 2024 data.\n\nFlorida moves to prep for redistricting following Trump's call\n\nHans Von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow for the conservative Heritage Foundation, believes maps should be redrawn more frequently. He said a mid-decade census could result in more congressional seats for Texas and Florida. Both are red states with rapidly increasing populations, and both were undercounted in the 2020 Census. Texas was undercounted by almost 550,000 in 2020 and added another 2 million people by 2024. By comparison, an average of 760,000 people live in each congressional district.\n\nWithin hours of Trump's statement, Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez, a Republican, said he's setting up a new redistricting committee.\n\nMichael P. McDonald, a political science professor at the University of Florida, said the congressional maps are the fairest they've been in about 40 years because of redistricting reform efforts across the country to prevent unfairly drawn districts. He said that the congressional maps are already drawn in a way that there are more Republican-leaning districts than Democratic-leaning ones, despite the practice of including undocumented immigrants in the count.\n\nMcDonald pointed to South Florida, where he said the current lines place right-leaning Cuban Americans with high voter turnout rates in the same districts as lower-propensity, Democratic-leaning Hispanic voters. If the maps were redrawn to not include undocumented immigrants, as Trump has suggested, he said there would likely be only two congressional seats in the area.\n\n\"Who\u2019s going to be on that game of musical chairs?\" he asked.\n\nWhy would Trump want to conduct a new Census?\n\n\"The Republicans are so desperate at this point to forestall what\u2019s likely going to happen in 2026,\" McDonald said.\n\nDemocrats are widely expected to win seats in the House of Representatives in next year's congressional elections because the party that occupies the White House usually does poorly. Trump also has low approval ratings. That blue wave could flip control of the House, in which Republicans hold a 219 to 212 majority.\n\nMcDonald said if Republicans draw new congressional districts, they might be able to mitigate the number of seats they lose.\n\nAre immigrants counted in the census?\n\nYes. The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says Representatives shall be apportioned according to the \"whole number of persons in each State.\" This ended the long-standing practice of counting three-fifths of enslaved people for purposes of representation. There is no language in the 14th Amendment that restricts these counts to citizens or people with legal presence in the country.\n\nDuring his first term in June 2019, Trump attempted to add a question to the 2020 Census asking if the person completing the survey was a citizen. The Supreme Court struck that down. The following year, Trump issued a memorandum saying undocumented immigrants should not be included in counts that determine congressional representation.\n\nKinsey Crowley is the Trump Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

      "text": "DeSantis may call special session to redraw congressional districts before next census\n'I think there's ample justification to do it,' the governor said.\n- Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is considering a special legislative session to redraw congressional districts mid-decade.\n- DeSantis believes Florida should have received more congressional seats after the 2020 census.\n- Republicans currently hold a significant advantage in Florida's congressional delegation (20-8).\nGov. Ron DeSantis is considering calling a special session of the Legislature to rearrange Florida's congressional districts.\n\u201cI do think it would be appropriate to do a redistricting here in the mid-decade. So we\u2019re working through what that would look like,\u201d DeSantis told reporters July 24 at an event in Bradenton.\nThe remarks come as Texas is engaged in a highly unusual redistricting session years before the next U.S. census in 2030. President Donald Trump has also said he wants four other GOP-held states to join Texas in redrawing U.S. House district lines to help Republican keep control of the chamber after the 2026 midterm elections.\nRepublicans currently hold a 220-212 advantage over Democrats in the U.S. House. Three Democrats have died in office since March. If Democrats hold those seats in special elections, they would need to net three districts in the November 2026 elections to take control of the chamber.\nOn July 17 the Florida Supreme Court upheld Florida\u2019s congressional maps and DeSantis said his office is reviewing the decision to see whether to call the Legislature in for a special session on redistricting.\nHe reiterated previous comments, bemoaning how unfair it was that Florida only received one additional congressional seat after the 2020 census. DeSantis believes if non-citizens weren\u2019t counted, Florida would get another district.\n\u201cI think there's ample justification to do it,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cMy guys are going through the court's opinion to look at different avenues but I think that\u2019s something that I certainly would look favorably on.\"\nBut short of another federal census, Florida won\u2019t gain an extra U.S. House seat ahead of the 2026 elections. That would make it tricky to slant the maps to advantage Republicans even more.\nGOP bests Dems in state's congressional contingent\nRepublicans already have a 20-8 advantage over Democrats in Florida\u2019s congressional delegation.\nEven with the GOP\u2019s surging lead in active registered voters, it could be difficult to draw another Republican district, which would likely require splitting a heavily-Democratic district into other GOP districts. Drawing new maps to favor your party but ultimately helping the opposing party is called a \u201cdummymander.\u201d\nIt's unclear whether the Legislature would go along with any DeSantis push to redraw the maps, however. DeSantis has feuded with lawmakers for much of the year, particularly with House Speaker Daniel Perez, R-Miami.\nPerez initially resisted DeSantis\u2019 call for an illegal immigration crackdown earlier this year, offering his own alternative before reaching a compromise, and his move to enact a sales tax cut was slammed by DeSantis as crowding out his push for property tax cuts.\nThis story contains previously published material.

Earlier this year, other fake stories were spread saying Trump only had a few days to live (he is still alive), and he had approved a $1,200 payment for stay-at-home moms (he didn't).\nHere is what to know:\nIs Trump making school 6 months long?\nNo, Trump has made no announcements indicating he intends to shorten the school year.\nWhat has Trump done with education so far?\nIn March, Trump signed an executive order aimed at closing the U.S. Department of Education, though fully dissolving the department would take Congressional action. However, the U.S. Supreme Court in July allowed the administration to fire hundreds of workers in its efforts to scale back the department. While K-12 curricula is largely under the purview of local governments, the Department of Education plays a supporting role in K-12 schools through funding. The agency also oversees colleges to ensure legal compliance and federal student aid.\nThe Trump administration has also taken aim at higher education, threatening to withhold funding from several universities in the U.S. if they do not follow federal directives, all under the banner of fighting antisemitism. He has alleged the institutions did not do enough to combat antisemitism during the protests against the war in Gaza, which brought allegations of both antisemitism and Islamaphobia. Some universities like Brown and Columbia have reached unprecedented deals with the Trump administration to end the freeze.\nTrump also restored the presidential fitness test for students in public schools.\nContributing: Zachary Schermele, Maureen Groppe, USA TODAY\nKinsey Crowley is the Trump Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

      "text": "As Trump calls for new census, Florida House moves to create special redistricting panel\nHouse Speaker Perez's announcement came after President Trump ordered a new census that did not tally illegal immigrants.\n- Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez is forming a committee on congressional redistricting following a Florida Supreme Court ruling and President Trump's call for a new census.\n- Trump's call for a census excluding undocumented immigrants and DeSantis' support for redistricting raise legal and logistical questions.\nHours after President Donald Trump called for a new census, Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez said he\u2019s setting up a new redistricting committee.\nThe moves could be the first steps towards an unprecedented mid-decade redrawing of congressional maps in Florida \u2013 something Democrats say is a naked power grab designed to generate more Republican seats in the U.S. House.\nIn an Aug. 7 memo, Perez said he\u2019s setting up a \"Select Committee on Congressional Redistricting\" in light of the decision from the Florida Supreme Court last month upholding the current congressional maps.\nThe 5-1 ruling held that the anti-gerrymandering Fair Districts amendments in the state constitution, which prohibit the reduction of seats where racial and ethnic minorities can choose their preferred candidate, run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause in the 14th Amendment.\nThat ruling \u201craises important and distinct questions about the applicability and interpretation of certain provisions of the so-called \u2018Fair Districts\u2019 provisions of the Florida Constitution and their intersection with Federal law,\u201d Perez wrote.\n\u201cExploring these questions now, at the mid-decade point, would potentially allow us to seek legal guidance from our supreme court without the uncertainty associated with deferring those questions until after the next decennial census and reapportionment.\u201d\nYet the ruling didn\u2019t entirely knock down the Fair District amendments, which also ban the Legislature from drawing districts to favor or disfavor incumbents or political parties.\nPerez said members looking to run for a U.S. House seat won\u2019t be part of the committee, and neither will anyone who makes remarks showing they intend to favor or disfavor a political party or incumbent.\nThe memo came after Trump earlier in the day ordered a new census that did not count illegal immigrants.\n\u201cI have instructed our Department of Commerce to immediately begin work on a new and highly accurate CENSUS based on modern day facts and figures and, importantly, using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024. People who are in our Country illegally WILL NOT BE COUNTED IN THE CENSUS,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social.\nThe announcement came after Gov. Ron DeSantis said in recent weeks he\u2019d like to see a redo of the 2020 census, suggesting Florida missed out on an additional seat in the reapportionment process. After the Florida Supreme Court decision, he said there was \u201cample justification\u201d for a mid-decade redistricting.\nTrump has already called for GOP-controlled states to redo their congressional boundaries to get more Republican seats in the U.S. House \u2013 a chamber that impeached him twice during his first term in office when it was under Democratic control. He was acquitted in the U.S. Senate each time.\nTexas is already engaged in a redistricting effort, which has pushed Democrats in control of other states \u2013 including California Gov. Gavin Newsom \u2013 to consider their own mid-decade redraw.\nEven before the census and committee announcements, Florida Democrats were decrying the potential redistricting maneuver.\n\u201cGov. DeSantis is publicly calling for new Congressional maps to be drawn in Florida \u2014 again,\u201d the Florida Democratic Party posted on X. \u201cThis anti-democratic power grab is designed to silence Florida voters, all while working families and seniors are suffering from an affordability crisis.\u201d\nIn pressing forward with an unprecedented mid-decade census and potential congressional redistricting, Trump and Florida Republicans would likely face several legal and logistical hurdles.\nThe regular census takes more than a year, and typically requires a large ramp-up of hiring federal workers. It\u2019s unlikely any census would be completed and in time for the Legislature to draw new lines ahead of the November 2026 election. The qualifying deadline for candidates in that election is in June 2026.\nThere\u2019s also the question of whether not counting illegal immigrants in any new census would be constitutional.\nThe U.S. Constitution calls for all \u201cfree persons\u201d to be counted. Trump issued an executive order in July 2020 attempting to remove undocumented immigrants from the census count, but it was blocked by the courts.\nGray Rohrer is a reporter with the USA TODAY Network-Florida Capital Bureau.

      "text": "See how Texas redistricting maps could gain Trump more Republican seats in the House\nAt least 51 of 67 Texas Democratic lawmakers have fled the state, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has ordered their arrests, and the Legislature has ground to a halt in a partisan dispute that could decide political control of Congress in 2026.\nRepublicans have proposed redrawing congressional districts in a way that could help the GOP gain five more House seats in the midterm election.\nDemocrats left to prevent a quorum, the minimum number of lawmakers needed to legally meet and enact legislation. The arrest warrants apply only within state lines.\nThat political move has spilled over state lines and ignited legislative disputes across the nation. That includes Illinois, New York and California, where governors are threatening to redraw their own maps to add Democratic-majority districts.\nHere's what\u2019s happening in Texas.\nHow Texas districts could change\nHere's a before-and-after look at how Republicans propose to redraw Texas districts. Many changes are to districts democrats won in the 2024 election including those near El Paso, Austin, San Antonio, Houston and Dallas.\nCan't see our graphics? Click here to reload the page.\nRight now there are 219 Republicans and 212 Democrats in the 435-seat U.S. House of Representatives. Trump\u2019s political operatives fear Democratic victories in 2026 could hamper his final two years in office.\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana said Democrats would impeach Trump for a third time if they gained the majority in 2026. Trump is the only president to be impeached twice, both times when the Democrats held the majority in the House.\nTrump has said his margin of victory in Texas in 2024 justifies changing the maps, which were introduced by a Texas legislative committee Aug. 2.\nTrump would have won more districts in 2024 with proposed maps\nTexas has 38 seats in the U.S. House, with 25 currently held by Republicans. According to reporting from the The Texas Tribune, the newly proposed maps would have allowed Trump to racked up victories in 30 Texas districts in the 2024 election \u2014 three more than the 27 districts he actually won.\nHere's a closer look at how key districts could change. The first map shows how current districts voted. The second map shows how the proposed new boundaries might perform based on the Texas Tribune analysis.\nHave voting district changes been disputed before?\nTexas Democrats left the state capitol in May 2003 to prevent Republicans from redrawing congressional districts. The lines eventually were redrawn, the Tribune reported.\nWhen do states draw new voting maps?\nBy law, state governments draw new congressional voting districts \u2013 geographic areas in which voters choose their representatives to Congress \u2013 every 10 years.\nThe districts are created using population changes from the Census Bureau, which updates the information every decade.\nSome Democratic governors are pledging to counter Texas by creating maps in large blue states that would offset GOP gains by targeting Republican members of Congress, USA TODAY said.\nContributing: Aysha Bagchi, Savannah Kuchar, Philip M.

Castellanos-Sosa, Texas Census Institute, Senior Research Associate\nResearch Overview\nU.S. Census Bureau estimates suggest the 2020 Census undercounted 547,968 Texans. While these state-level numbers are informative, little is known of how this undercount is distributed across its counties. To inform this issue, we estimate the 2020 county-level net undercount in Texas counties and study its spatial distribution using data from the 2020 Census and the Texas Demographic Center 2020 Population Projections. This study aims to build on the work of Eric Jensen and Sandra Johnson and their use of demographic benchmarks to assess the 2020 Census by developing a projections benchmark to assess the 2020 Census at the county level.\nMain Findings\nFigure 1.b\nNet undercount rate in Texas counties.\nNote: A darker red color indicates a higher negative net undercount. A darker blue color indicates a higher positive net undercount (or net overcount). Loving, Kenedy, and King are excluded from the analysis due to the differential privacy approach used to estimate their populations.\nIntroduction\nAn accurate census in the U.S. is paramount as census data serve as the foundation for informed decision-making across various sectors. The Census provides a comprehensive and up-to-date population demographic profile, offering crucial insights into the distribution, composition, and characteristics of communities. These data are instrumental in shaping public policies, allocating government resources, and ensuring fair political representation by apportioning congressional seats. The Project On Government Oversight (POGO) recently found that census-derived data were instrumental in distributing $150.3 billion to Texas in Fiscal Year 2020.1 Overall, a reliable census is the cornerstone of a well-informed and equitable society.\nAfter 2020 Census data collection was complete, the U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) performed a Post-Enumeration Survey (PES) to assess the quality of the 2020 Decennial Census.2 It concluded that six states, including Texas, experienced an undercount in the 2020 Census. The PES suggests the 2020 Census missed 547,968 people (1.92% of its 28,540,000-household population). According to the PES, the Texas population should have been 29,693,473 rather than the 29,145,505 recorded from the 2020 Census.\nThe undercount of Texas is the second-largest numerical undercount during the 2020 Census, and Texas is the second-largest state in terms of its population. On top of that, Texas is the state with the most counties: 254. However, there is no official information about total population undercounts at the county level, as PES\u2019 results \u201c\u2026are not broken down by demographic characteristics or geographic areas within the state given the sample size for the PES and the assumptions required to make substate geographic estimates\u201d.2\nDespite the undercount seen in the 2020 Census, the Census count remains the most accurate source of total population for U.S. geographies. To increase our understanding of the undercount at the county level, the Texas Census Institute (TxCI) uses the counties\u2019 population projections from the Texas Demographic Center (TDC) as a source of secondary information on how the population might be distributed across the 254 Texas counties. Our study distributes Texas statewide undercount of 547,968 people across its counties using the TDC projections as a benchmark. This approach builds on the work of Eric Jensen and Sandra Johnson from the U.S. Census Bureau, and their use of demographic benchmarks to assess the 2020 Census.3\nJensen and Johnson\u2019s approach is most accurately performed for children and young children since those populations are typically counted by birth registration data, which is considered highly accurate.4\u20139 A similar approach is not appropriate for the entire population since people born in one place often move to another during their lifetime. The closest approach to the demographic benchmark, in our opinion, is to use a county-level population estimate or projection that considers multiple different population gain and loss patterns across age groups and demographic categories.\nIn 2018, The Texas Demographic Center\u2019s projection for the Texas population in 2020 was 29,677,668 (just 0.05% below the 29,693,473 estimated by the PES). This close correlation between counting efforts suggests our projection benchmark approach works within an accepted range of reliability. Since the TDC projection is broken down to the county level, it is an important resource to approximate undercounting at a county level. We use the Texas Demographic Center\u2019s projection for the 2020 Texas population released in 2018 as TDC\u2019s projections are estimated every two years in non-census years, and the 2018 version is the one that occurred closest to the 2020 Census and contains most of the updated data used to generate it.\nBuilding on the differences between census counts and TDC projections, we strive to identify the potential undercount at the county level, understand why the differences exist, and support initiatives that can improve the accuracy of the population count in Texas, either through improving self-response, advocating for measures that will remove structural barriers to an accurate count (such as the Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP), the Local Update of Census Addresses (LUCA), among other initiatives), or raising awareness around the importance of a complete count. Having the data disaggregated in this way will enable stakeholders to address localized challenges effectively, identify disparities, and implement interventions catering to diverse community needs.\nData\nThis brief uses TDC\u2019s Projections of Texas counties\u2019 population and the U.S. Census Counts.10,11\nTo keep county-level data accuracy within a high-quality standard, we do not study counties with data that could have been compromised by the 2020 Census\u2019 new differential privacy approach, which is designed to protect respondent\u2019s identity in compliance with Title 13 and Title 26. For instance, for the 2010 Census, studies suggest that this new privacy protection came at the expense of data accuracy, and some counties experienced a high loss of data accuracy.12 For instance, Loving County, the county with the smallest population in Texas, had a 17.1% difference due to differential privacy when comparing the 2010 Census count and the new Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) used in the 2020 Census. This phenomenon also occurred with the next two smallest counties, King and Kennedy County, with a 5.2% and 4.6% difference. We excluded these counties from our study to avoid inaccuracies related to DAS. For reference, their combined population represents 0.002% of Texas\u2019 population and reduces the sample to 251 counties.\nMethodology\nThe Census count remains the most accurate source of total population for U.S. geographies. To approximate the undercount or overcount at the county level in Texas, we \u2018spread\u2019 the 547,968-people undercount obtained by the Post-Enumeration Survey across its counties.\nTo geographically distribute the official undercount of Texas, we use an adjusted difference between the Census count and the TDC projections as weights to disperse the official state measure across counties.\nIn doing so, we first estimate the difference between the 2020 Census count and the TDC projections. TDC projections are subtracted from census counts to determine whether the difference is positive or negative. A negative value indicates net undercount, and a positive value indicates net overcount. The sum of the differences is -532,163. So, we adjust counties\u2019 differences by 1.0296996 (the ratio between -547,968 and -532,163) to make counties\u2019 differences add up to the PES\u2019 Net Coverage Error. We then estimate the share these differences represent from the TDC Projections to estimate undercount rates. We acknowledge that this method is different from the procedure performed by the U.S. Census Bureau when estimating net coverage errors (the PES); however, it allows us to identify the potential undercount at the county level. The similarities in outcomes give us confidence in the reliability of our numerical and rate undercount for Texas counties.\nGiving special attention to counties with high undercounts and overcounts allows us to identify counties with a meaningful undercount or overcount. We classify counties\u2019 differences as high or low based on four thresholds: undercount rate above 5.0% or below -5.0% and numerical undercount above 500 or below -500 people. This approach has become a standard in other research studies comparing census counts to other benchmarks.3,8,9,13 Given the potential small random errors in the 2020 Census and the TDC projections, a small value between them might not necessarily reflect a meaningful or true undercount or overcount. Our contribution relies on identifying the potential undercounts and overcounts for Texas counties regardless of its size.\nThe lowest values of the census self-response rate have been associated with net undercount by the U.S. Census Bureau.14 In particular, the Bureau found a statistically significant net undercount for people living in the 20% of census tracts with the lowest self-response rates. A recent study by the National Academies of Sciences reinforced this finding, suggesting that \u201c\u2026[2020 Census] quality deteriorates the lower the self-response rate\u201d.15\nFinally, we conclude our analysis by examining the relationship between the Texas counties\u2019 net undercount rate and their Census self-response rate.\nTo do this, it is important to clarify the interpretation of net undercount in regard to its sign. A net undercount is associated with an undercount since the population is not being counted in net terms. On the other hand, a positive net undercount is associated with overcounting because more people are being considered in the counting. Therefore, when exploring the relationship between the county-level net undercount rate with their self-response rate, it is important to separate counties into two subsamples: those with a negative and those with a positive net undercount rate.\nSpecial Considerations\nIn addition to reporting the differences between the 2020 Census and the TDC Projections, the projection benchmark approach used here might also reflect the net coverage error and inaccuracies on the base population and births, deaths, and migrant rates used by the TDC when estimating their projections. Similarly, the differences here presented as net undercount figures might contain part of the noise injected by the 2020 census new differential.12\nResults\nCounties Undercount\nMost Texas counties experienced a TDC projection higher than their Census count (177 out of 254, or 69.7% of counties) (see Figure 1). The other 74 Texas counties (29.1%) observed a TDC projection lower than their Census count.\nInterestingly, in terms of numerical net undercount, counties with a positive net undercount observed a maximum value of up to 25,841 people (in Collin County, located in the Metroplex Region, which represented 2.5% of its TDC projection). Counties with a negative net undercount (TDC projection higher than a Census count) observed the largest negative net undercount of -255,057 (in Harris County, located in the Gulf Coast region, representing -5.1% of its TDC projection).\nIn terms of rates, counties with a positive net undercount (or net overcount) observed a maximum rate of 16.6% (in Kaufman County, located in the Metroplex Region, equivalent to 20,775 people). However, counties with a negative net undercount observed the largest negative rate of -29.4% (in Edwards County, located in the South Texas region, which is equivalent to -586 people).\nThese initial results showed that counties with a small population could easily have a high-rate undercount and a low numerical net undercount because a number would represent a higher share than in a more populated county. Therefore, it is important to distinguish the distribution of the counties by low and high net undercount for the cases in which the net undercount is positive or negative (see Table 1).\nOur analysis sorts counties into eight groups to observe the combination of low and high rates and numbers between the counties that observed a net undercount and those that observed a net overcount: four groups for net undercounts and four groups for net overcounts. From this point forward, for simplicity purposes, we will refer to \u201cpositive net undercount\u201d as an \u201covercount\u201d, and to \u201cnegative net undercount\u201d as an \u201cundercount\u201d.\nIn Texas, 196 out of 254 counties (77.2%) have either a High Rate or a High Number, or both (instinctively of the sign of the net undercount). This suggests that most Texas counties have at least one type of high net undercount (colored counties in Figure 2).\nOf these 196 counties, 97 have a combination of high and low numbers and rates (high rate and low number, or low number and high rate) regardless of whether the net undercount is positive or negative (see light red and light blue counties in Figure 2). These 97 counties have a negative net undercount (after balancing out the negative and positive net undercount of counties) of -220,527 people (40.3% of the PES net undercount of -547,968 people).\nAmong the other 99 counties having a high net undercount (rate and numerical), independently of the sign of the net undercount (see Figure 3), 81 counties have a negative net undercount, and 18 have a net overcount. These 99 counties have a net undercount of -326,138 people (59.5% of the PES net undercount of 547,968 people).\nCounties with a high net undercount (numerical and rate) predominate in the South Texas and West Texas regions. On the other side, most counties with a high numerical and rate positive net undercount (or net overcount) are close to the well-known Texas Triangle, composed of Texas\u2019 biggest metropolitan areas (Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, and Austin).\nNet Undercount and Self-Response Rate\nWe find that the net undercount rate and the self-response rate of Texas counties have a statistically significant correlation of 0.53 at the 1% confidence level (see green dashed line in Figure 4). However, the relationship is also presented separately for counties with an undercount (in red) and those with an overcount (in blue) since both situations might originate from different reasons. We find that negative values of net undercount are correlated to counties\u2019 self-response rates in the 2020 census, presenting a statistically significant correlation of 0.49 at the 1% confidence level. On the other hand, counties with a positive net undercount (or net overcount) do not have a statistical correlation between these variables.\nThree facts jump out at first glance from Figure 4: most Texas counties are small, highly populated counties (big circles) are located at the right part of the graph (with higher 2020 Census Self-Response Rates), and there is a clear relationship between net undercount and Census Self-Response Rates (the lowest the Self-Response Rate, the largest the undercount).\nThe blue circles (or those above the horizontal axis) are counties with a positive net undercount. Counties represented by red circles (or those below the horizontal axis) have a negative net undercount. Straight lines are fitted values from a linear regression between the variables for each subsample. The almost null slope of the blue straight line suggests the net undercount is mainly steady, regardless of the self-response rate of the counties. The steeper slope of the red straight line suggests a positive correlation between the variables for counties with a negative net undercount.\nThis result provides evidence in favor of the existing literature that suggests the quality of the Census is worse at lower self-response rates.14,15 A 1% increase in the self-response rate is associated with a 0.34% higher net undercount. In other words, a 1% increase in the self-response rate is related to a 0.34% lower undercounting.\nThe population of Texas is scattered across its geography: 160 of its 254 counties have 30,000 or fewer people. We performed a robustness check for counties with 30K or fewer people and counties with 30K+ people and found that the magnitude of the correlation is relatively higher in the less populated counties. A 1% increase in the self-response rate is associated with a 0.30% higher net undercount in counties with 30K people or less, while it is associated with a 0.17% higher net undercount in 30K+ counties.\nConcluding Remarks\nThis research brief examined disparities between the 2020 Census counts and the Texas Demographic Center\u2019s projections for 2020 as a benchmark to estimate a potential net undercount for Texas counties.\nThe findings reveal a substantial net undercount in specific Texas counties, particularly in South Texas and West Texas regions, prompting a closer examination of the regional dynamics. Notably, 77.2% of Texas counties exhibit high net undercount (numerical or rate), emphasizing the widespread impact of census discrepancies on diverse communities. Moreover, 91.8% of Texas\u2019 net undercount is found in four regions (Gulf Coast, Alamo, South Texas, and West Texas).\nAs we navigate through the geographical dispersion of the net undercount in Texas, it becomes evident that Harris County (in the Gulf Coast region) stands out with the most significant negative net undercount, necessitating focused attention on resource distribution and intervention strategies.\nThe regional analysis further nuances the narrative, showcasing that numerical net undercount must be contextualized with rate variations to understand the issue comprehensively.\nIn identifying potential drivers of the net undercount when it is positive or negative across counties, we found that a negative net undercount is correlated to counties\u2019 self-response rate in the 2020 census. In particular, a 1% increase in the Self-Response Rate is associated with a 0.34% higher net undercount. In practical terms, this suggests that a 1% increase in the Self-Response Rate is related to a 0.34% lower undercounting. It is critical to point out that, when considering the size of the counties, this relationship is stronger in counties with 30k people or less than in those with 30K+.\nIn conclusion, this research underscores the urgency of addressing local differences and regional disparities, urging stakeholders, policymakers, and researchers to mitigate these challenges collaboratively. The insights gleaned from this examination contribute to the ongoing discourse on census accuracy and lay the groundwork for targeted interventions and informed decision-making at both the state and regional levels.\nReferences\n- Project on Government Oversight.

These estimates are constructed using official data sources, ensuring the differences presented here can be further studied concerning their source limitations through the Bureau and TDC methodologies.\nThe projections benchmark methodology used to distribute net undercounts across counties based on the differences between census counts and TDC Population Projections represents our effort to find innovative ways that allow us to find a more nuanced understanding of population dynamics and census accuracy. This approach not only provides valuable insights but also lays the groundwork for informed decision-making in policy and service planning.\nAcknowledgements: The author appreciates the insightful support provided by Helen You, Monica Cruz, and William P. O\u2019Hare.\nFAQ\n1) Why does the U.S. Census Bureau not publish undercounting and overcounting estimates at the county level?\nAs it is well known, the U.S. Census Bureau assesses the quality (undercounting or overcounting) of its Decennial Census using the Post-Enumeration Survey (PES) and the Demographic Analysis (DA).\nThe PES was implemented in 2020 by characteristics of the housing units only to the national and state levels. The PES uses the location of the housing units to obtain results at the subnational level, but it does not consider demographic characteristics such as age or gender. Moreover, \u201c\u2026the sample size for the 2020 PES and the assumptions required to make unbiased sub-state estimates, the Census Bureau was unable to include county or place estimates in the 2020 PES reports, as well.\u201d (U.S. Census Bureau, 2022).\nOn the other hand, the Demographic Analysis uses \u201c\u2026current and historical vital records, data on international migration, and Medicare records to produce national estimates of the population on April 1 by age, sex, the DA race categories, and Hispanic origin.\u201d (U.S. Census Bureau, 2022). While the DA is rich in demographic characteristics, it cannot identify the current place of residence of the population since a great part of it is based on vital records. Therefore, due to its nature, the official undercounting or overcounting by demographic characteristics is estimated at the national level only.\nTherefore, it is not possible to obtain an official undercounting and overcounting estimate at the county level.\n2) Why are we using counties as geographies?\nCounties are used here as the geographical level of study because they are political subdivisions small enough to capture within-state disparities, and large enough to group social representation.\n3) How accurate or precise are our net undercount estimates?\nWhile there is no statistical measure of accuracy or precision for our estimates, they were built using official publicly available data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Texas Demographic Center.\n4) Why does the TDC produce population projections?\nThe State of Texas mandates the production of population annual estimates and biennial projections by its demography center, the TDC. In addition to the State\u2019s use of TDC Population Projections data, cities and counties use population projections to plan and forecast public services. Because the TDC supplies data to all State bodies and elected officials, Projections are broken down to the county level, making it a helpful resource, which allows TxCI to approximate the population gaps found by the PES at substate geographic levels. You can find more details of the TDC Population Projections here.\n5) Why does TxCI use TDC Population Projections to calculate the census undercount at the county level?\n\u201c\u2026the Census Bureau was unable to include county or place estimates in the 2020 PES reports\u2026.\u201d (U.S. Census Bureau, 2022). For this reason, we compare the 2020 Census\u2019 county-level population counts with what we consider are the second-best population figures at the county level: the TDC Population Projections.\n6) How does this approach relate to previous research published by TxCI?\nUntil now, TxCI relied upon the assumption that all counties faced an undercount and that counties\u2019 undercounts would be within the undercount range provided by the U.S. Census Bureau for Texas. While well-sourced, this seemed hard to verify given the striking variances in population density and characteristics across Texas.\nTxCI\u2019s new study distributes the net undercount provided by the Bureau across counties using the most accurate population number available after the 2020 Census counts: the 2020 TDC Population Projections.. The 2018 version of the TDC Population Projection suggests Texas\u2019 population would be 1.82% above the 2020 Census counts, a number strikingly similar to the -1.92% net coverage error ultimately published by the U.S. Census Bureau.\nIn this analysis, we consider the differences between the 2020 Census and the TDC Population Projections as an alternative way to observe the potential \u201ctrue\u201d value of the population at the county level. And adjust the county-level figures such that the differences between the 2020 Census and TDC Population Projections add up to the -1.92% of the U.S. Census Bureau."

We are confident that today\u2019s 2020 Census results meet our high data quality standards.\u201d\nThe new resident population statistics for the United States, each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico are available on census.gov.\nIn addition to these newly released statistics, today Secretary Raimondo delivered to President Biden the population counts to be used for apportioning the seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. In accordance with Title 2 of the U.S. Code, a congressionally defined formula is applied to the apportionment population to distribute the 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives among the states.\nThe apportionment population consists of the resident population of the 50 states, plus the overseas military and federal civilian employees and their dependents living with them overseas who could be allocated to a home state. The populations of the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico are excluded from the apportionment population because they do not have voting seats in Congress. The counts of overseas federal employees (and their dependents) are used for apportionment purposes only.\nUpon receipt of the apportionment counts, the president will transmit them to the 117th Congress. The reapportioned Congress will be the 118th, which convenes in January 2023.\n\u201cOur work doesn\u2019t stop here,\u201d added acting Director Jarmin. \u201cNow that the apportionment counts are delivered, we will begin the additional activities needed to create and deliver the redistricting data that were previously delayed due to COVID-19.\u201d\nRedistricting data include the local area counts states need to redraw or \u201credistrict\u201d legislative boundaries. Due to modifications to processing activities, COVID-19 data collections delays, and the Census Bureau\u2019s obligation to provide high-quality data, states are expected to receive redistricting data by August 16, and the full redistricting data with toolkits for ease of use will be delivered by September 30. The Census Bureau will notify the public prior to releasing the data.\n###"

      "text": "Which states are being impacted by Texas' redistricting battle?\nWhat started on the floor of the Austin, Texas statehouse last week has rapidly mushroomed into a multi-state standoff with national implications, as the Lone Star State\u2019s redistricting battle continues to bleed beyond its borders.\nDozens of Texas Democrats have fled to three blue states in a bid to stave off a vote on the proposed map, which could give Republicans five more seats in Congress ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\nSeveral Democratic state leaders have entered the fray, and two GOP lawmakers announced efforts to take the issue to the U.S. Capitol in recent days. President Donald Trump lent his opinion on the melee Aug. 5, as Texas Republicans\u2019 redistricting fight now stretches across at least five states and captures national attention.\nHere\u2019s how Texas\u2019 redistricting crisis has ballooned into state-on-state fights over the last week:\nIllinois, New York and Massachusetts host Texas Democrats\nThe governors of Illinois, New York and Massachusetts are hosting Democratic lawmakers from Texas after they fled their home state Sunday, Aug. 3. The lawmakers\u2019 mass absence from the legislature prevents the quorum Republicans need to call for a vote on the new map, which is likely to pass among its GOP majority.\nUnder the new maps, Texas' congressional districts in the Houston, Austin and Dallas metro areas would be redrawn, along with a handful in southern Texas, creating five additional districts that would have heavily favored Trump in last year's presidential race. By extension, these Republican-heavy new districts would very likely go to GOP candidates in congressional elections, strengthening the party\u2019s currently slim majority in Congress.\nMore than 50 of Texas' 67 Democratic lawmakers have fled the state as of Tuesday, Aug. 5, and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has ordered their arrests \u2212 though it's unclear whether and how Texas law enforcement will be able to work with out-of-state law enforcement to execute the arrest order.\nStates threaten to redraw their own maps in response\nNew York and California have threatened to launch their own redistricting, sparking a kind of political arms race between Democratic and Republican states.\nCalifornia\u2019s Democratic governor Gavin Newsom, though not hosting any Texas lawmakers, joined New York governor Kathy Hochul in threatening to use his state\u2019s overwhelming blue majority to counteract Texas Republicans\u2019 plans. Both governors lead two of the most powerful Democratic states.\nGov. Gavin Newsom said in a press conference Monday, Aug. 4 that his plans are to \u201cfight fire with fire,\u201d instructing Democrats to move forward with an effort to redraw the most populous state\u2019s congressional districts if Texas moves forward with its proposed map. He said Democrats are moving forward with a plan to put the redistricting plan before voters on Nov. 4.\nIn a press conference the same day, Hochul discussed the possibility of new maps in her state.\n\"This is a war. We are at war,\" she said. \"And that's why the gloves are off and I say, 'Bring it on.'\"\nRepublicans in Missouri, New York and California propose their own responses\nIn red Missouri, a coalition of the state\u2019s conservative GOP lawmakers issued a statement on July 25 urging Gov. Mike Kehoe to call for its own redistricting effort, which would give Republicans an advantage. The governor's spokesperson Gabby Picard told POLITICO on Tuesday, Aug. 5 that Kehoe \u201cwill always consider options\u201d which \u201cprovide congressional districts that best represent Missourians\" regarding the push for a map redraw.\nBut not all GOP lawmakers appear to be on board with fighting one map with another. Two Republicans, Reps. Kevin Kiley of California and Mike Lawler of New York announced that they will introduce bills to place nationwide limits on all such partisan gerrymandering. Kiley\u2019s proposal would prohibit mid-decade redistricting, which would likely spike Texas Republicans' efforts and the tit-for-tat proposals from New York and California.\nWhatever happens in Texas, the fight over Congress via redistricting will continue in Ohio later this month, where Republicans hold a supermajority in the state legislature.\nContributing: Phillip M.

      "text": "Tim Cook appeals to Trump\u2019s love of gold with a 24-karat base for Apple plaque\n- Apple CEO Tim Cook presented Donald Trump with a custom-made gift highlighting American manufacturing when visiting the White House.\n- The gift, a custom glass plaque with a gold base, aligned with Trump's \"America First\" policies and his love of gold.\n- Apple announced $100 billion in new U.S. investments.\nApple CEO Tim Cook visited President Donald Trump at the White House on Aug. 6, and brought with him a custom gift that seemed to be tailored to the president's tastes.\nThe two announced Apple's $100 billion in new U.S. investment, an addition to the $500 billion previously announced, as the tech giant tries to protect its products from Trump's steep tariffs. Apple is also set to expand its factories in the U.S.\nWith trembling hands, Cook opened an Apple box he said was made in California, took out a circular plaque with an Apple-shaped cutout in the middle made of glass apparently made in Kentucky, and attributed the design to a former U.S. Marine Corps corporal who now works at Apple. The plaque was set in a 24-karat gold base Cook said was made in Utah.\nPart of Trump's longstanding \"America First\" approach to policy is pushing to have more goods made in America. Though Trump has also been gifted a Tesla Cybertruck with a picture of himself on it and a framed copy of his grandfather's German birth certificate, Cook's gift appealed to more than just Trump's preference to have things made in America.\nTrump adorns his space and the things he makes in gold.\nGold tweezers, gold sneakers and a gold guy in the White House\nTrump's affinity for gold predates his time in the Oval Office. Here is a look at some of his golden adornments throughout the years:\n- In 2006, Trump met porn star Stormy Daniels at a golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, as she testified during his hush money trial. She said that she saw a set of apparently golden manicure items like tweezers in his hotel suite. (Trump was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records at that trial.)\n- As a presidential hopeful, he updated his private plane in 2011 to a Boeing 757 and outfitted it with gold-leafed seatbelts and faucets, according to the New York Post.\n- Trump Mobile was announced on the 10-year anniversary of Trump declaring his candidacy in 2015, when he famously rode down the golden escalator in Trump Tower.\n- During his campaign for a second term, Trump sold gold sneakers for $399 and a limited edition gold watch for $100,000.\n- The Trump Organization sells several gold tchotchkes under the \"Golden Age of America\" collection, including chocolate bars, ornaments, coin banks and playing cards that are fashioned like gold bars with Trump's name on them.\n- Trump has brought in his \"gold guy\" from South Florida to adorn the Oval Office in the style of his Mar-A-Lago estate, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n- Amid widespread immigration crackdowns and the return of a controversial travel ban, Trump announced a \"gold card\" visa that offers applicants residency and a path to U.S. citizenship for $5 million paid to the U.S. government.\nApple touts additional $100 billion in U.S. investment\nCook was one of several tech leaders who attended Trump's inauguration earlier this year.\nApple had said in February that it would spend $500 billion in U.S. investments over four years, but the Washington Post reported most of that would cover the regular cost of doing business. The White House announcement brings the total investment figure up to $600 billion.\nStill, Apple broke ground on a Houston factory to make advanced AI servers earlier this year, and Trump said on Aug. 6 it would invest billions to construct data centers across the country, including in North Carolina, Iowa and Oregon.\n\"I'm proud to say that Apple is leading the creation of an end-to-end silicon supply chain right here in America,\" Cook said.\nTrump said the planned 100% tariff on semiconductors and computer chips would not apply to companies that make a commitment to manufacture in the U.S., like Apple.\nContributing: Joey Garrison, Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy, Aysha Bagchi, Lauren Villagran, Marina Pitofsky, Jonathan Limehouse, USA TODAY\nKinsey Crowley is the Trump Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

      "text": "Trump's approval rating dips in new poll: What recent surveys show\nA new poll puts President Donald Trump's approval rating near record lows, noting an \"erosion of support\" among one of the president's most reliable groups of supporters: men.\nThe University of Massachusetts Amherst survey released Monday, Aug. 4, found public support for the Republican leader has dropped six percentage points since its April poll, giving Trump a meager 38% approval rating. With a corresponding 58% of poll respondents disapproving of his job performance, the figures mark one of the lowest ratings seen in recent months \u2212 and follow a string of major national polls with similarly low approval ratings.\nA historical analysis by Gallup shows Trump's approval ratings in the first July of both of his terms are lower than those of any other modern president.\n\u201cTrump\u2019s approval ratings, already historically low for a newly elected president, continue to sink with close to 6-in-10 Americans (58%) expressing disapproval of the job that Trump is doing in office,\" the UMass Amherst poll's director, Tatishe Nteta, said in an Aug. 4 press release. \"While Trump remains a popular figure among Republicans and conservatives, Trump\u2019s time in office is viewed more negatively across genders, generations, classes and races, with majorities of each of these groups disapproving of Trump\u2019s performance.\"\nThe poll, conducted in partnership with YouGov July 25-30, interviewed 1,000 respondents nationally. The margin of error is 3.5%.\nWhat is President Trump's approval rating?\nAggregations of recent approval polling from The New York Times and RealClearPolitics place Trump's approval between 44% and 45.8%, respectively, with a 53% and 51.4% disapproval as of Aug. 6.\nThe UMass Amherst poll shows a significantly lower approval mark compared to these averages. The survey found Trump's net approval rating dropped to -20 as he surpasses the six-month mark of his second term in office, with discontent focused especially on his handling of immigration, tariffs, inflation and the Jeffrey Epstein crisis.\nOpinions on Trump's approach to inflation and tariffs jockeyed for the lowest ratings, both collecting a 31% approval, followed by 32% approving his stance on civil rights. Approval of his stance on immigration fell nine points among respondents compared to the April survey.\nThe Epstein controversy continues to stay top of mind for many Americans, a topic that has weighed Trump down in recent polls. Among the participants in the UMass Amherst poll, more than three-fourths said they have \"read, seen or heard about Jeffrey Epstein\" either some or a lot, and 70% said they believe the president is handling the issue either \"not too well\" or \"not well at all.\" Nearly two-thirds (63%) believe his administration is hiding information about Epstein.\nNew Trump poll shows drop in support among men\nIn April, men were a significant source of support for the president's then-44% approval rating, with 48% of men telling pollsters they approved of Trump's performance. Three months later, that number has dropped by nearly 10 points, with 39% of men expressing approval of the president in July \u2212 only one point higher than his overall approval rating. Among women, support is even lower at 35%, and has also seen a drop since April, by four percentage points.\n\u201cIn addition to losing support among men, Trump has seen approval for his presidency crumble among political independents, a critical swing constituency,\u201d said Jesse Rhodes, professor of political science at UMass Amherst and a co-director of the poll, in a news release. \u201cWhile 31% of independents approved of his presidency in April, that number is now down 10 percentage points to 21%.\"\nThe UMass Amherst poll results echo similarly low approval polling by Gallup, which marked the lowest approval rating yet of his second term, at 37% as of July 25, and a Reuters/Ipsos poll released July 30 that gave him a 40% approval.\nKathryn Palmer is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "What to know about President Trump's proposed new census and 2026 elections\nThe population survey helps decide how many congressional seats each state gets. Here's why a new one would matter.\nPresident Donald Trump announced his intention to \"immediately begin work on a new\" census, raising questions about whether the plan would be constitutional and how it would affect the partisan makeup of Congress.\nHis announcement came amidst Texas Republicans' efforts to perform an unusual mid-decade redrawing of congressional maps, which are normally drawn after the census determines the number of seats in each state's delegation at the beginning of each new decade.\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott and the GOP-led state legislature hope to add up to five new seats for their party by redistricting, prompting proposals for Democratic states to redraw their congressional maps in retaliation.\nTrump's Aug. 7 social media post said a new survey should be taken \"based on modern day facts and figures and, importantly, using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024,\" and that people \"who are in our Country illegally WILL NOT BE COUNTED IN THE CENSUS.\"\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the White House for comment. Neither the U.S. Census Bureau nor the Commerce Department responded to requests for comment.\n\"I think you would have to see, at some point, do things start moving?\" said Shawn Donahue, a political science professor at the University of Buffalo. \"Is it something that is more of just a press release, or is there something that the Commerce Department is going to start doing?\"\nHow often is the census taken?\nThe U.S. Constitution calls for the census to be conducted every 10 years, and in years that end in zero, most recently in 2020. The U.S. Census Bureau, part of the Commerce Department, carries out these resource-intensive surveys and hires temporary staff to conduct outreach to count as many people as possible.\nThe survey results are used to decide how seats in the U.S. House of Representatives are distributed to each state based on its population, a process called apportionment. Those processes usually take place in the first two years of a decade.\nThe survey results are also used to determine how much federal funding is distributed to states, and researchers widely cite the demographic research to understand the country.\nWho supports conducting a mid-decade Census?\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, announced a bill in July that would require a new census to be performed, counting only U.S. citizens, and then direct states to redraw their congressional districts based on the new numbers. \"Americans don't feel like they're represented in Washington,\" she said.\nHans Von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow for the conservative Heritage Foundation, said he thinks states should redraw their congressional districts every five years, as long as data is available, but it usually isn't. He said the United States has a mobile and constantly increasing population that a survey held every 10 years doesn't capture.\nHe also pointed to a 2022 report from the U.S. Census Bureau that found 14 states had statistically significant differences between the bureau's count and the actual population. Six states \u2014 Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Texas \u2014 had undercounts. He said better data quality might have led to more congressional seats in Texas and Florida.\nWho opposes a mid-decade census?\nJohn Bisognano, president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, criticized Trump's proposal as \"a comprehensive campaign to flout the U.S. Constitution in order to predetermine election outcomes so he can consolidate his power and avoid accountability to the American people.\"\nSophia Lin Lakin, director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, told National Public Radio that following through \"would defy the Constitution, federal law, and settled precedent\" and her organization \"won't hesitate to go back to court to protect representation for all communities.\"\nWhy would Trump want to conduct a new Census?\n\"The Republicans are so desperate at this point to forestall what\u2019s likely going to happen in 2026,\" said Michael P. McDonald, a political science professor at the University of Florida.\nDemocrats are widely expected to win seats in the House of Representatives in next year's congressional elections, because the party that occupies the White House usually does poorly. Trump also has low approval ratings. That blue wave could flip control of the House, in which Republicans hold a 219 to 212 majority.\nMcDonald said if Republicans draw new congressional districts, they might be able to mitigate the number of seats they lose.\nFor example, the Republican stronghold of Texas saw such rapid population growth when the 2020 survey came out that it gained two additional congressional seats. Republican-leaning states of Florida and Montana, Democrat-leaning Oregon and Colorado, and tightly contested North Carolina each gained one seat.\nThe Democratic population centers of California, Illinois, and New York each lost one seat; so did Republican-leaning Ohio and West Virginia, and the swing states of Michigan and Pennsylvania.\nAre immigrants counted in the census?\nYes. The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says Representatives shall be apportioned according to the \"whole number of persons in each State.\" This ended the longstanding practice of counting three-fifths of enslaved people for purposes of representation. There is no language in the 14th Amendment that restricts these counts to citizens or people with legal presence in the country.\nDuring his first term, Trump attempted to add a question to the 2020 census asking if the person completing the survey was a citizen. The Supreme Court struck that down in 2019. The following year, Trump issued a memorandum saying undocumented immigrants should not be included in counts that determine congressional representation.\nCould Republicans gain more seats if a new census were conducted?\nVan Spakovsky said a mid-decade census could result in more congressional seats for Texas and Florida. Both are red states with rapidly increasing populations, and both were undercounted in the 2020 census. Texas, for example, was undercounted by almost 550,000 in 2020 and added another 2 million people by 2024. By comparison, an average of 760,000 people live in each congressional district.\nWithin hours of Trump's statement, Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez, a Republican, said he's setting up a new redistricting committee.\nMcDonald said the congressional maps are the fairest they've been in about 40 years, because of redistricting reform efforts across the country to prevent unfairly drawn districts. He said that the congressional maps are already drawn in a way that there are more Republican-leaning districts than Democratic-leaning ones, despite the practice of including undocumented immigrants in the count.\nMcDonald pointed to South Florida, where he said the current lines place right-leaning Cuban Americans with high voter turnout rates in the same districts as lower-propensity, Democratic-leaning Hispanic voters. If the maps were redrawn to not include undocumented immigrants, as Trump has suggested, he said there would likely be only two congressional seats in the area. \"Who\u2019s going to be on that game of musical chairs?\" he asked.\nHow would a new census affect 2026 or 2028?\nReapportioning congressional seats affects two things: How many congressional seats each state has and how many electoral votes each state has, because electoral votes are equal to each state's total number of Senate and House seats. House terms last two years, and the elections take place in even years, with the next one coming in 2026. The next presidential election happens in 2028. But this doesn't mean that a new census will take place or that maps will be rejiggered by then.\n\"It seems pretty unlikely that you could do this for 2026, just because it takes so long,\" said Donahue. The government also isn't allowed to speed up the process by basing its count on statistical sampling, he said, pointing to a 1999 Supreme Court decision that said people must be counted. \"It\u2019s not something where you can snap your fingers and it\u2019s going to happen.\"\nVon Spakovsky suggested the U.S. Census Bureau update a form it already sends out regularly and use it to perform a mid-decade census survey. \"You couldn\u2019t get it done this year, but I don\u2019t see any reason why you couldn\u2019t get it done next year,\" he said.\nWould Trump's order to do a mid-decade census go to court?\n\"Absolutely,\" said Donahue. \"The Constitution calls for a decennial census. It doesn\u2019t say that you can\u2019t (have more). But, I mean, it pretty much implies that you\u2019re only going to do one every 10 years.\"\nDonahue predicted that Democratic-leaning states would be most likely to challenge a mid-decade census in court. But the administration could argue that the requirement to do it every 10 years isn't a prohibition on doing it more often.\n\"There\u2019s no legal bar in place that says you can\u2019t redistrict more than once every 10 years,\" von Spakovsky said.\nContributing: Francesca Chambers"

      "text": "Supreme Court blocks 2020 census citizenship question for now, handing Trump administration a major defeat\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Supreme Court temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census Thursday, giving opponents new hope of defeating it.\nThe ruling by Chief Justice John Roberts questioned the rationale for the administration's effort, just as challenging states and immigrant rights groups have done.\n\"The evidence tells a story that does not match the explanation (Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross) gave for his decision,\" Roberts wrote. \"The sole stated reason seems to have been contrived.\"\nIn a complex decision with several dissents and concurrences, the court's four liberal justices said they would have struck down the citizenship question outright, while the court's four other conservative justices said it should have been upheld.\nThe court's decision doesn't end the dispute. A separate challenge to the administration's motive for asking the citizenship question remains alive in another federal district court. That inquiry could drag on for much of the summer, jeopardizing the timetable for printing the census questionnaire.\nJustice Department spokesperson Kelly Laco expressed disappointment over the ruling but said the agency \"will continue to defend this administration\u2019s lawful exercises of executive power.\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted while traveling in Japan, calling it \"totally ridiculous that our government ... cannot ask a basic question of citizenship\" and urging that the census be delayed until the Supreme Court can be given new information.\nBut Dale Ho, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's voting rights project, said that \"for all intents and purposes, this is over.\"\n\u201cGiven how many times they represented that they need to start printing the forms next week, I think it would be the height of hypocrisy for the administration to try and get more time now,\u201d Ho said.\nThe challenge to the Commerce Department's plan was the most controversial case on the high court's docket, affecting 22 million noncitizens and ultimately the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and about $650 billion in federal funds.\nMore: Supreme Court says federal courts cannot strike down partisan gerrymandering schemes\nOpponents contended that adding the question was an effort to scare noncitizens into avoiding the census. That in turn would require expanding largely Democratic congressional districts, potentially reducing their overall number. It could cost California, Texas, Florida, New York, Illinois and Arizona seats in Congress.\nCommerce Secretary Ross directed the Census Bureau to add the question last year based on the Justice Department's request. He said the \"need for accurate citizenship data and the limited burden that the reinstatement of the citizenship question would impose outweigh fears about a potentially lower response rate.\"\nMore: Read the full text of the Supreme Court's decision to block a census citizenship question\nThree federal district judges separately agreed that Ross' reasons were inadequate under federal law. They noted that he had consulted with White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, both fierce opponents of liberal immigration policies. Only later did the Justice Department ask that the question be added.\nThough it had appeared during oral argument that all the court's conservative justices were on the administration's side, Roberts proved the deciding vote. The evidence, he said, \"showed that the secretary was determined to reinstate a citizenship question from the time he entered office.\"\n\"We do not hold that the agency decision here was substantively invalid,\" Roberts noted. \"But agencies must pursue their goals reasonably. Reasoned decisionmaking under the Administrative Procedure Act calls for an explanation for agency action. What was provided here was more of a distraction.\"\nAssociate Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh dissented from Roberts' conclusions.\n\"The court's erroneous decision in this case is bad enough, as it unjustifiably interferes with the 2020 census,\" Thomas wrote. \"But the implications of today's decision are broader. With today's decision, the court has opened a Pandora's box of pretext-based challenges in administrative law.\"\n\"To put the point bluntly,\" Alito added, \"the federal judiciary has no authority to stick its nose into the question whether it is good policy to include a citizenship question on the census or whether the reasons given by Secretary Ross for that decision were his only reasons or his real reasons.\"\nThe lower court judges \u2013 all named by President Barack Obama \u2013 described acts of subterfuge and misleading statements intended to obscure the real reasons for asking the citizenship question. In the New York case, Judge Jesse Furman called them \"the acts and statements of officials with something to hide.\"\nIn an expanded, 80-minute oral argument in April that exposed huge divisions among the justices, the Supreme Court's conservatives didn't appear to buy arguments that Ross' plan was illegal or unconstitutional.\nThe court's four liberal justices appeared dead set against adding the question to the Census Bureau's short form, which goes to every household. They cited the bureau's estimates that it would reduce response rates among households with noncitizens by more than 5%.\nSince the case was heard, challengers discovered documents suggesting a political motive in the files of a deceased Republican expert on redistricting who concluded the move could lead to reduced voting power for Hispanics. That would help Republicans and hurt Democrats in congressional elections.\nMore: Supreme Court's Top Cases of 2019\nThe census is intended to count anyone residing in the country, so seats in the House of Representatives can be apportioned fairly among the states. The Census Bureau said it needs to begin printing the questionnaire this summer.\nContributing: Kristine Phillips and William Cummings"

What we know about the Texas chain\n- Roland Beainy, owner of the Texas restaurant chain Trump Burger, was detained by ICE earlier this year.\n- Beainy of Lebanon entered the US in 2019 and was released on bond pending immigration proceedings.\n- The Trump Burger chain, which features Trump-themed d\u00e9cor and menu items, has no official connection to the president.\nThe owner of a Texas restaurant group that celebrates President Donald Trump is facing immigration enforcement.\nTrump Burger's locations boast Trump-themed menu items, campaign decorations and burger buns stamped with \"TRUMP.\" The first location opened in 2020, founded by Roland Beainy, who moved to the U.S. from Lebanon the year before, according to Fox Business. It went viral earlier this year when its social media profiles were spammed with \"chicken taco\" comments, a nod to the \"Trump Always Chickens Out\" acronym created to describe his approach to tariffs.\nBeainy and some of his restaurants are involved in lawsuits, according to local outlet The Fayette County Record. Court records for a lawsuit between the Trump Burger Kemah location and its landlord indicate Beainy was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement earlier this year.\nHere is what we know:\nDid the owner of Trump Burger get deported?\nICE confirmed with USA TODAY that Beainy, 28, entered the country in 2019 as a non-immigrant visitor but stayed past his required departure date in February 2024.

His administration has set out to deport 1 million people annually, far surpassing previous highs, especially considering encounters at the southern border have been at a historic low and deportation increases are coming from the interior.

      "text": "MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE\nSUBJECT: Excluding Illegal Aliens From the Apportionment\nBase Following the 2020 Census\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:\nSection 1. Background. In order to apportion Representatives among the States, the Constitution requires the enumeration of the population of the United States every 10 years and grants the Congress the power and discretion to direct the manner in which this decennial census is conducted (U.S. Const. art. I, sec. 2, cl. 3). The Congress has charged the Secretary of Commerce (the Secretary) with directing the conduct of the decennial census in such form and content as the Secretary may determine (13 U.S.C. 141(a)). By the direction of the Congress, the Secretary then transmits to the President the report of his tabulation of total population for the apportionment of Representatives in the Congress (13 U.S.C. 141(b)). The President, by law, makes the final determination regarding the \u201cwhole number of persons in each State,\u201d which determines the number of Representatives to be apportioned to each State, and transmits these determinations and accompanying census data to the Congress (2 U.S.C. 2a(a)). The Congress has provided that it is \u201cthe President\u2019s personal transmittal of the report to Congress\u201d that \u201csettles the apportionment\u201d of Representatives among the States, and the President\u2019s discretion to settle the apportionment is more than \u201cceremonial or ministerial\u201d and is essential \u201cto the integrity of the process\u201d (Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 799, and 800 (1992)).\nThe Constitution does not specifically define which persons must be included in the apportionment base. Although the Constitution requires the \u201cpersons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed,\u201d to be enumerated in the census, that requirement has never been understood to include in the apportionment base every individual physically present within a State\u2019s boundaries at the time of the census. Instead, the term \u201cpersons in each State\u201d has been interpreted to mean that only the \u201cinhabitants\u201d of each State should be included. Determining which persons should be considered \u201cinhabitants\u201d for the purpose of apportionment requires the exercise of judgment. For example, aliens who are only temporarily in the United States, such as for business or tourism, and certain foreign diplomatic personnel are \u201cpersons\u201d who have been excluded from the apportionment base in past censuses. Conversely, the Constitution also has never been understood to exclude every person who is not physically \u201cin\u201d a State at the time of the census. For example, overseas Federal personnel have, at various times, been included in and excluded from the populations of the States in which they maintained their homes of record. The discretion delegated to the executive branch to determine who qualifies as an \u201cinhabitant\u201d includes authority to exclude from the apportionment base aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status.\nIn Executive Order 13880 of July 11, 2019 (Collecting Information About Citizenship Status in Connection With the Decennial Census), I instructed executive departments and agencies to share information with the Department of Commerce, to the extent permissible and consistent with law, to allow the Secretary to obtain accurate data on the number of citizens, non-citizens, and illegal aliens in the country. As the Attorney General and I explained at the time that order was signed, data on illegal aliens could be relevant for the purpose of conducting the apportionment, and we intended to examine that issue.\nSec. 2. Policy. For the purpose of the reapportionment of Representatives following the 2020 census, it is the policy of the United States to exclude from the apportionment base aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status under the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), to the maximum extent feasible and consistent with the discretion delegated to the executive branch. Excluding these illegal aliens from the apportionment base is more consonant with the principles of representative democracy underpinning our system of Government. Affording congressional representation, and therefore formal political influence, to States on account of the presence within their borders of aliens who have not followed the steps to secure a lawful immigration status under our laws undermines those principles. Many of these aliens entered the country illegally in the first place. Increasing congressional representation based on the presence of aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status would also create perverse incentives encouraging violations of Federal law. States adopting policies that encourage illegal aliens to enter this country and that hobble Federal efforts to enforce the immigration laws passed by the Congress should not be rewarded with greater representation in the House of Representatives. Current estimates suggest that one State is home to more than 2.2 million illegal aliens, constituting more than 6 percent of the State\u2019s entire population. Including these illegal aliens in the population of the State for the purpose of apportionment could result in the allocation of two or three more congressional seats than would otherwise be allocated.\nI have accordingly determined that respect for the law and protection of the integrity of the democratic process warrant the exclusion of illegal aliens from the apportionment base, to the extent feasible and to the maximum extent of the President\u2019s discretion under the law.\nSec. 3. Excluding Illegal Aliens from the Apportionment Base. In preparing his report to the President under section 141(b) of title 13, United States Code, the Secretary shall take all appropriate action, consistent with the Constitution and other applicable law, to provide information permitting the President, to the extent practicable, to exercise the President\u2019s discretion to carry out the policy set forth in section 2 of this memorandum. The Secretary shall also include in that report information tabulated according to the methodology set forth in Final 2020 Census Residence Criteria and Residence Situations, 83 Fed. Reg. 5525 (Feb. 8, 2018).\nSec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person."

This mid-decade census could significantly impact congressional redistricting, potentially benefiting Republican-held states by allowing them to gain additional congressional seats. Florida's House Speaker has already initiated a redistricting committee in response to Trump's announcement, raising concerns among Democrats about the implications for fair representation.",
