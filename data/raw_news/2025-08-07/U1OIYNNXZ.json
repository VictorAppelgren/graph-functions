  "title": "FTC secures $145M settlement from companies that allegedly deceived health insurance shoppers with robocalls",
  "description": "FTC reaches $145 million settlement with Prudential and MediaAlpha over allegations of misleading consumers about healthcare services and illegal robocalls",
  "content": "FIRST ON FOX: The Federal Trade Commission announced Thursday it had reached massive settlement agreements in a pair of lawsuits alleging two companies, Prudential and MediaAlpha, misled consumers about healthcare services and bombarded them with robocalls.\n\nThe combined settlements amount to $145 million and are part of a broader effort to tackle what Christopher Mufarrige, Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, says are lead-generating practices by companies that violate the FTC Act and telemarketing rules.\n\n\"Coherently and systematically addressing unlawful lead generation is a priority for the FTC,\" Mufarrige said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital. \"That\u2019s especially so in connection to health insurance, one of the most expensive and important products consumers buy to protect themselves and their families.\"\n\nMediaAlpha and Prudential allegedly conveyed inaccurate information about health insurance plans to consumers and abused the personal data they gained from the consumers to target them with incessant telemarketing phone calls, the FTC said.\n\nMediaAlpha, a technology company, solicits information from people in exchange for selling personalized health insurance options to them.\n\nBut MediaAlpha has agreed to pay $45 million in response to the FTC's claim in a complaint that the company \"actually [sells] its consumers nothing.\" It instead allegedly engages in nuisance robocalling and sells contact information it harvests to telemarketers.\n\n\"Many consumers have received dozens or even hundreds of such solicitations in a matter of days, and the intrusions can go on for months,\" FTC attorneys wrote.\n\nAssurance IQ, a technology platform that was acquired by Prudential Financial in 2019 but was shuttered years later, also misled consumers about health plans and has agreed to pay $100 million as a result, the FTC said. Reuters first reported on the Assurance IQ settlement.\n\nTelemarketers for Assurance IQ allegedly misled consumers about the services including in healthcare coverage plans they were selling, including by falsely claiming the plans covered preexisting conditions.\n\nFox Business reached out to MediaAlpha and AssuranceIQ for comment.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nChris Bissex, deputy director of public affairs for the FTC, told Fox News Digital the settlements were one example of the myriad ways the FTC is monitoring for anticompetitive practices in the healthcare industry.\n\n\"Unfair and deceptive practices when it comes to healthcare are concerning because it can impact consumers\u2019 wallets and their health,\" Bissex said. \"These settlements represent one of the many ways the FTC is looking out for consumers in the healthcare space.\"",

      "text": "The Supreme Court has temporarily allowed President Donald Trump to fire numerous Democrat-appointed members of independent agencies, but one case still moving through the legal system carries the greatest implications yet for a president\u2019s authority to do that.\nIn Slaughter v. Trump, a Biden-appointed member of the Federal Trade Commission has vowed to fight what she calls her \"illegal firing,\" setting up a possible scenario in which the case lands before the Supreme Court.\nThe case would pose the most direct question yet to the justices about where they stand on Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the nearly century-old decision regarding a president\u2019s power over independent regulatory agencies.\nJohn Shu, a constitutional law expert who served in both Bush administrations, told Fox News Digital he thinks the high court is likely to side with the president if and when the case arrives there.\nSUPREME COURT SAYS TRUMP CAN PROCEED WITH FIRING DEMOCRAT-APPOINTED CPSC MEMBERS\n\"I think it's unlikely that Humphrey\u2019s Executor survives the Supreme Court, at least in its current form,\" Shu said, adding he anticipates the landmark decision will be overturned or \"severely narrowed.\"\nWhat is Humphrey\u2019s Executor?\nHumphrey\u2019s Executor centered on President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s decision to fire an FTC commissioner with whom he disagreed politically. The case marked the first instance of the Supreme Court limiting a president's removal power by ruling that Roosevelt overstepped his authority. The court found that presidents could not dismiss FTC commissioners without a reason, such as malfeasance, before their seven-year terms ended, as outlined by Congress in the FTC Act.\nHowever, the FTC\u2019s functions, which largely center on combating anticompetitive business practices, have expanded in the 90 years since Humphrey's Executor.\n\"The Federal Trade Commission of 1935 is a lot different than the Federal Trade Commission today,\" Shu said.\nHe noted that today's FTC can open investigations, issue subpoenas, bring lawsuits, impose financial penalties and more. The FTC now has executive, quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial functions, Shu said.\nSCOTUS greenlights other firings\nIf the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to temporarily allow two labor board members\u2019 firings is any indication, the high court stands ready to make the FTC less independent and more accountable to Trump.\nIn a 6-3 order, the Supreme Court cited the \"considerable executive power\" that the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board have, saying a president \"may remove without cause executive officers who exercise that power on his behalf.\"\nTRUMP'S CONTROVERSIAL PLAN TO FIRE FEDERAL WORKERS FINDS FAVOR WITH SUPREME COURT\nThe order did not mention Humphrey\u2019s Executor, but that and other moves indicate the Supreme Court has been chipping away at the 90-year-old ruling and is open to reversing it.\nThe case of Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya gets closest to the heart of Humphrey\u2019s Executor.\nWhere does Slaughter\u2019s case stand?\nSlaughter enjoyed a short-lived victory when a federal judge in Washington, D.C., found that Trump violated the Constitution and ruled in her favor on July 17.\nShe was able to return to the FTC for a few days, but the Trump administration appealed the decision and, on July 21, the appellate court paused the lower court judge's ruling.\nJudge Loren AliKhan had said in her summary judgment that Slaughter's case was almost identical to William Humphrey's.\nSUPREME COURT UPHOLDS TRUMP'S REMOVAL OF BIDEN APPOINTEES FROM FEDERAL BOARDS\n\"It is not the role of this court to decide the correctness, prudence, or wisdom of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions\u2014even one from ninety years ago,\" AliKhan, a Biden appointee, wrote. \"Whatever the Humphrey\u2019s Executor Court may have thought at the time of that decision, this court will not second-guess it now.\"\nThe lawsuit arose from Trump firing Slaughter and Bedoya, the two Democratic-appointed members of the five-member commission. They alleged that Trump defied Humphrey\u2019s Executor by firing them in March without cause in a letter that \"nearly word-for-word\" mirrored the one Roosevelt sent a century ago.\nBedoya has since resigned, but Slaughter is not backing down from a legal fight in which Trump appears to have the upper hand.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Like dozens of other federal agencies, the Federal Trade Commission has been protected from presidential politics for nearly a century,\" Slaughter said in a statement after she was re-fired. \"I'll continue to fight my illegal firing and see this case through, because part of why Congress created independent agencies is to ensure transparency and accountability.\"\nNow a three-judge panel comprising two Obama appointees and one Trump appointee is considering a longer-term pause and asked for court filings to be submitted by July 29, meaning the judges could issue their decision soon thereafter."
