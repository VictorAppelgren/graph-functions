  "content": "is a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nThe Supreme Court will let Mississippi\u2019s social media age verification law take effect while the case is being argued in court. In an unsigned ruling on Thursday, the court declined to block the law after an emergency petition from trade association NetChoice. The order offers no explanation, but in a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that the law was \u201clikely unconstitutional\u201d \u2014 but that NetChoice hadn\u2019t\u201csufficiently demonstrated\u201d a risk of harm.\n\nThe law, HB 1126, requires social media platforms to verify the age of the person creating the account, while blocking users under 18 unless they have permission from a parent. It also states that social media sites must protect underage users from \u201charmful material\u201d \u2014 such as sexual content and material related to self-harm \u2014 as well as restrict data collection.\n\nNetChoice, which is backed by tech giants like Meta, Google, Amazon, Reddit, and Discord, argues that age verification laws for general-purpose social media violate the First Amendment. Though the trade association won an injunction to block the law last year, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated it in April, allowing the law to go into effect. As Justice Kavanaugh noted, however, numerous district courts have blocked similar laws in other states.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, NetChoice has, in my view, demonstrated that it is likely to succeed on the merits \u2014 namely, that enforcement of the Mississippi law would likely violate its members\u2019 First Amendment rights.\u201d\n\nDespite this setback, NetChoice is still confident that it will prevail. \u201cAlthough we\u2019re disappointed with the Court\u2019s decision, Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s concurrence makes clear that NetChoice will ultimately succeed in defending the First Amendment \u2014 not just in this case but across all NetChoice\u2019s ID-for-Speech lawsuits,\u201d Paul Taske, co-director of the NetChoice Litigation Center, said in a statement. \u201cThis is merely an unfortunate procedural delay.\u201d\n\nThe decision comes as lawmakers across the US \u2014 and around the world \u2014 push age verification mandates designed to protect children from harmful content on the internet. In June, the Supreme Court upheld a Texas law that requires users to verify their ages before accessing porn sites, paving the way for similar laws to take effect \u2014 but specifically for platforms focused on adult content. Meanwhile, the UK has begun to enforce a broader online age-gating requirement that asks users to verify their age with a government ID, a face scan, or by entering credit card information on certain websites.\n\nJennifer Huddleston, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, said in a statement that age verification laws have \u201csignificant impacts on privacy and speech rights of both adult and teen users.\u201d Huddleston notes that today\u2019s decision doesn\u2019t mean the court \u201cwill automatically uphold this law as constitutional should it reach it through the full appeals process.\u201d\n\nFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.",

      "text": "People across the United Kingdom have been faced with a censored and partially inaccessible online landscape since the country introduced its latest digital safety rules on Friday.\nThe UK is slogging through an online age-gate apocalypse\nIt\u2019s a good time to be a VPN provider.\nIt\u2019s a good time to be a VPN provider.\nThe Online Safety Act mandates that web service operators must use \u201chighly effective\u201d age verification measures to stop kids from accessing a wide range of material, on penalty of heavy fines and criminal action against senior managers. It\u2019s primarily focused on pornography and content that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, but the scope of \u201cpriority content\u201d also includes materials related to bullying, abusive or hateful content, and dangerous stunts or challenges.\nEffectively, web platforms must either set up an age verification system that poses potential privacy risks, default to blocking huge swaths of potentially questionable content, or entirely pull out of the UK. Residents are finding themselves locked out of anything from period-related subreddits to hobbyist forums \u2014 it\u2019s little wonder that they\u2019re turning to VPNs.\nOver the past several days, several large social media platforms have started requiring age verification in the UK to access certain features and types of content, in partnership with third-party software providers. Users typically have a choice between uploading bank card information, an image of government-issued ID, or a facial scan that estimates the user\u2019s age.\nMeta users likely won\u2019t have seen a huge difference over the weekend, as Facebook and Instagram rolled out age verification requirements a few years ago. Bluesky users in the UK, however, now can\u2019t access direct messaging capabilities until they complete the platform\u2019s new age verification process. Reddit has also blocked access to specific subreddits for UK-based users who don\u2019t complete its age verification process, some of which \u2014 r/periods, r/stopsmoking, r/stopdrinking, and r/sexualassault, for example \u2014 provide valued community support and resources for adults and minors alike.\nPeople are already finding loopholes for these systems. The face scanning systems for Persona and k-ID \u2014 the third-party verification software used by Reddit and Discord, respectively \u2014 can both be easily tricked using Death Stranding\u2019s photo mode. (Facebook and Instagram use a similar service called Yoti, which so far does not appear to have been fooled the same way.)\nX doesn\u2019t yet have a direct verification system, and is instead currently estimating age based on factors like account creation date, social connections, email addresses, and legacy verification. Accounts that don\u2019t have any of these signals in place are locked out of accessing certain content until X rolls out the ID and facial scanner-based checkers it\u2019s planning to release \u201cin the following weeks.\u201d That includes protest footage and video game clips that depict violence \u2014 and users who aren\u2019t even based in the UK are reporting content restrictions as well.\nOutside the biggest platforms, some sites are entirely inaccessible. Cybersecurity company McAfee reports that more than 6,000 websites that host adult content have already implemented age assurance methods, but others have opted to geoblock their services in the UK. A wide variety of unrelated, innocuous websites have followed suit. That includes forums for owners of EV Renault vehicles, electronic music production, beaded jewelry patterns, and tech-focused blogs. Many smaller forums simply don\u2019t have the resources to support third-party verification systems or risk millions of dollars in fines.\nWikipedia has voiced similar concerns over other Online Safety Act rules that could require it to verify its adult contributors, which the Wikimedia Foundation behind Wikipedia says could leave volunteers vulnerable to \u201cdata breaches, stalking, lawsuits, or even imprisonment by authoritarian regimes.\u201d As such, while it\u2019s still available for now, the platform is also considering blocking UK users to avoid compliance.\nThe UK\u2019s communications regulator, Ofcom, declined to offer an attributed on-the-record comment about the new age checks to The Verge. In unattributed statements to other outlets, it said it was \u201cnow assessing compliance to make sure platforms have them in place, and companies that fall short should expect to face enforcement action.\u201d\nUK residents have launched a parliamentary petition in response to the sweeping age verification requirements, urging the UK government to repeal the Online Safety Act, and describing it as \u201cfar broader and restrictive than is necessary in a free society.\u201d The petition has attracted more than 350,000 signatures at the time of writing, surpassing the 100,000 signatures needed to force the government to consider holding a debate over the demands.\nMeanwhile, some users have been finding ways to avoid undergoing verification entirely, expressing distrust over handing their personal information over to private overseas companies. Many restrictions can be evaded by using a VPN, which masks the user\u2019s true location by making it seem like they\u2019re in another country \u2014 one without the UK\u2019s rigid online safety rules. VPN apps are currently five out of the top 10 most popular free apps on Apple\u2019s iOS store in the UK. The top spot is currently held by Swiss-based VPN provider Proton VPN, which surpassed ChatGPT over the weekend.\nProton VPN\u2019s general manager, David Peterson, told The Verge that it had seen a more than 1,800 percent increase in daily sign-ups from UK-based users since Friday. The UK is now one of the countries generating the highest usage for Proton VPN, according to Peterson, with the vast majority of new users signing up for free accounts.\n\u201cThis clearly shows that adults are concerned about the impact universal age verification laws will have on their privacy,\u201d said Peterson. \u201cThe sign-up spike in the UK follows a similar pattern as when other governments put in place restrictions on communication or social media platforms, and shouldn\u2019t be surprising since services like Wikipedia, Reddit, and X are reportedly being asked to comply with age verification requirements.\u201d"

      "text": "On July 25th, the UK became one of the first countries to widely implement age verification. Its Online Safety Act requires sites hosting porn and other content deemed \u201charmful\u201d \u2014 including Reddit, Discord, Grindr, X, and Bluesky \u2014 to verify that users are over the age of 18. The early results have been chaotic. While many services have complied, some have pulled out of the country rather than face the risk and expense. Users have tricked the verification tools or bypassed them with VPNs. It\u2019s just a taste of the issues that many other countries might face as they launch their own systems, and it\u2019s a situation that privacy and security experts have long warned about \u2014 to little avail.\nFollowing a yearslong political push to make the internet safer for kids, age verification has started seeping into online spaces across the globe. Lawmakers in the US, Europe, Australia, and elsewhere have all passed age-gating rules, and platforms have begun to comply. The likely methods for verification are similar to those in the UK. Platforms typically ask users to either enter a payment card, upload a government-issued ID, take a selfie, or allow a platform to use their data (like account creation dates and user connections) to \u201cestimate\u201d their age. Most rely on third-party services: Bluesky uses the Epic Games-owned Kids Web Services; Reddit is working with Persona; and Discord has partnered with k-ID.\nThe outcome so far is an assortment of online services handling sensitive user information \u2014 a \u201cprivacy nightmare,\u201d says Cody Venzke, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cThere is no standardization of how age verification is supposed to take place.\u201d\nSome age verification platforms promise to erase your data after a certain period of time, like the seven days that Persona says it will keep the information used to verify your age on Reddit. But there\u2019s no guarantee every service will do this, and there are still massive security risks given how common data breaches have become. Last year, a security researcher found that AU10TIX \u2014 an identity verification solution used by TikTok, Uber, and X \u2014 left user information and driver\u2019s license photos exposed for months, 404 Media reported.\nGovernments are plowing toward the future of an age-gated internet\n\u201cWhen uploading your ID ... you are handing it over to a third party,\u201d Venzke says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to take their word that they\u2019re going to delete it or remove it after they\u2019re done using it.\u201d\nDespite these potential pitfalls, governments are plowing toward the future of an age-gated internet anyway. In addition to a crackdown in the UK, the European Union is hurdling toward a broad rollout of digital IDs, Australia is age-gating search engines, and users in many US states need IDs to access porn sites.\nAge verification was long viewed as unconstitutional in the US, but the Supreme Court overturned that precedent earlier in 2025, concluding \u201cadults have no First Amendment right to avoid age verification\u201d if it\u2019s meant to protect underage users from \u201cobscene\u201d content. Several states, including Alabama, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Texas, have implemented laws requiring verification measures on adult websites. Some have tried to extend this to social media or app stores as a whole, but so far, they\u2019ve failed \u2014 lawsuits filed by NetChoice, a technology trade group backed by Google, Meta, X, Amazon, Discord, and other tech giants, have successfully blocked bills in California, Arkansas, Georgia, Ohio, and Florida.\nAs in the UK, there\u2019s no guarantee against privacy and security breaches for states with age verification laws, and there\u2019s little standardization in this bevy of rules. Efforts in the US also coincide with escalating government digital surveillance and attempts to declare expressions of LGBTQ sexuality, like drag shows, as obscene, raising the risks of handing over personal data even further.\nNot all age verification efforts entrust users\u2019 privacy to third-party services with a host of different methods. The EU is trialing not only age-gating requirements, but also government-managed digital IDs. It has started testing an age verification system prototype designed to \u201cbridge the gap\u201d before digital IDs arrive by the end of next year. The solution will allow users to upload their passport or government ID card to a government-built system, which then generates a \u201cproof of age attestation\u201d that is passed to sites. Sites can also use the customer identification methods employed by banks and mobile carriers. The goal is that users can upload sensitive information to a single system that can be held to a high privacy standard and is simple for sites to use.\nThough having a centralized age verification solution may prevent users from having to pass their information through multiple verification services, plenty of questions remain regarding surveillance and accessibility. Aside from the ever-present possibility of data breaches, digital IDs may also restrict undocumented individuals from accessing content online. And, without the proper safeguards, digital identity systems may still \u201cphone home\u201d to the ID\u2019s issuer when a user\u2019s age is verified, potentially allowing providers to track online activity.\n\u201cIf I pull up my ID at the liquor store, the DMV doesn\u2019t know that, but with digital identification, there\u2019s a potential for that,\u201d says Alexis Hancock, the director of engineering at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).\nDown the line, the EU says it plans to enhance the framework with technology called zero-knowledge proof (ZKP). This is a cryptographic verification method that allows a service to prove something is true or false without revealing any additional information, as outlined by the EFF. That means an app could verify that a user is over the age of 18 without disclosing their exact birthdate. Google has already built a ZKP system into Google Wallet and has since open-sourced the technology, which it\u2019s encouraging EU members to adopt.\nEven with ZKP in place, Hancock says that there are still concerns about what sites and apps can ask for information about a user\u2019s age. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything remotely promising at the moment that actually reels in verifiers in particular,\u201d Hancock says. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of scope restriction on who can actually ask for this and if it\u2019s even needed in some cases.\u201d\nLawmakers and regulators have argued that there are overwhelming benefits to protecting children from harmful content or exploitative social media platforms. Melanie Dawes, the chief executive of Ofcom, the UK\u2019s communications regulator, boasted that \u201cprioritizing clicks and engagement over children\u2019s online safety will no longer be tolerated in the UK,\u201d and US lawmakers and regulators have declared porn and social media a public health crisis. \u201cPutting in place commonsense guardrails that protect our kids from the dangers of social media is critical for their future and America\u2019s future,\u201d Sen. Katie Britt said in an announcement about the Kids Off Social Media Act.\nWhile keeping kids safe online is important, this messaging downplays or ignores the ripple effects. Right now, there just isn\u2019t any clear-cut way to verify someone\u2019s age online without risking a leak of personal information or hampering access to the internet. Until lawmakers stop and think about the bigger picture, everyone\u2019s privacy is going to be at risk."

      "text": "Age verification is perhaps the hottest battleground for online speech, and the Supreme Court just settled a pivotal question: does using it to gate adult content violate the First Amendment in the US? For roughly the past 20 years the answer has been \u201cyes\u201d \u2014 now, as of Friday, it\u2019s an unambiguous \u201cno.\u201d\nThe Supreme Court just upended internet law, and I have questions\nLast week, online age verification violated the First Amendment. This week, it doesn\u2019t.\nJustice Clarence Thomas\u2019 opinion in Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton is relatively straightforward as Supreme Court rulings go. To summarize, its conclusion is that:\n- States have a valid interest in keeping kids away from pornography\n- Making people prove their ages is a valid strategy to enforce that\n- Internet age verification only \u201cincidentally\u201d affects how adults can access protected speech\n- The risks aren\u2019t meaningfully different from showing your ID at a liquor store\n- Yes, the Supreme Court threw out age verification rules repeatedly in the early 2000s, but the internet of 2025 is so different the old reasoning no longer applies.\nAround this string of logic, you\u2019ll find a huge number of objections and unknowns. Many of these were laid out before the decision: the Electronic Frontier Foundation has an overview of the issues, and 404 Media goes deeper on the potential consequences. With the actual ruling in hand, while people are working out the serious implications for future legal cases and the scale of the potential damage, I\u2019ve got a few immediate, prosaic questions.\nWhat\u2019s the privacy threat level?\nEven the best age verification usually requires collecting information that links people (directly or indirectly) to some of their most sensitive web history, creating an almost inherent risk of leaks. The only silver lining is that current systems seem to at least largely make good-faith attempts to avoid intentional snooping, and legislation includes attempts to discourage unnecessary data retention.\nThe problem is, proponents of these systems had the strongest incentives to make privacy-preserving efforts while age verification was still a contested legal issue. Any breaches could have undercut the claim that age-gating is harmless. Unfortunately, the incentives are now almost perfectly flipped. Companies benefit from collecting and exploiting as much data as they can. (Remember when Twitter secretly used two-factor authentication addresses for ad targeting?) Most state and federal privacy frameworks were weak even before federal regulatory agencies started getting gutted, and services may not expect any serious punishment for siphoning data or cutting security corners. Meanwhile, law enforcement agencies could quietly demand security backdoors for any number of reasons, including catching people viewing illegal material. Once you create those gaps, they leave everyone vulnerable.\nWill we see deliberate privacy invasions? Not necessarily! And many people will probably evade age verification altogether by using VPNs or finding sites that skirt the rules. But in an increasingly surveillance-happy world, it\u2019s a reasonable concern.\nIs Pornhub coming back to Texas (and a bunch of other states)?\nOver the past couple of years Pornhub has prominently blocked access to a number of states, including Texas, in protest of local laws requiring age verification. Denying service has been one of the adult industry\u2019s big points of leverage, demonstrating one potential outcome of age verification laws, but even with VPN workarounds this tactic ultimately limits the site\u2019s reach and hurts its bottom line. The Supreme Court ruling cites 21 other states with rules similar to the Texas one, and now that this approach has been deemed constitutional, it\u2019s plausible more will follow suit. At a certain point Pornhub\u2019s parent company Aylo will need to weigh the costs and benefits, particularly if a fight against age verification looks futile \u2014 and the Supreme Court decision is a step in that direction.\nIn the UK, Pornhub ceded territory on that very front a couple of days ago, agreeing (according to British regulator Ofcom) to implement \u201crobust\u201d age verification by July 25th. The company declined comment to The Verge on the impact of FSC v. Paxton, but backing down wouldn\u2019t be a surprising move here.\nWhat is porn?\nI don\u2019t ask this question with respect to the law itself \u2014 you can read the legal definitions within the text of the Texas law right here. I\u2019m wondering, rather, how far Texas and other states think they can push those limits.\nIf states stick to policing content that most people would classify as intentional porn or erotica, age-gating on Pornhub and its many sister companies is a given, along with other, smaller sites. Non-video but still sex-focused sites like fiction portal Literotica seem probably covered. More hypothetically, there are general-focus sites that happen to allow visual, text, and audio porn and have a lot of it, like 4chan \u2014 though a full one-third of the service being adult content is a high bar to clear.\nBeyond that, we\u2019re pretty much left speculating about how malicious state attorneys general might be. It\u2019s easy to imagine LGBTQ resources or sex education sites becoming targets despite having the exact kind of social value the law is supposed to exempt. (I\u2019m not even getting into a federal attempt to redefine obscenity in general.) At this point, of course, it\u2019s debatable how much justification is required before a government can mount an attack on a website. Remember when Texas investigated Media Matters for fraud because it posted unflattering X screenshots? That was roughly the legal equivalent of Mad Libs, but the attorney general was mad enough to give it a shot. Age verification laws are, rather, tailor-made methods to take aim at any given site.\nThe question \u201cWhat is porn?\u201d is going to have a tremendous impact on the internet \u2014 not just because of what courts believe is obscene for minors, but because of what website operators believe the courts believe is obscene. This is a subtle distinction, but an important one.\nWe know legislation limiting adult content has chilling effects, even when the laws are rarely used. While age verification rules were in flux, sites could reasonably delay making a call on how to handle them. But that grace period is over \u2014 seemingly for good. Many websites are going to start making fairly drastic decisions about what they host, where they operate, and what kind of user information they collect, based not just on hard legal decisions but on preemptive phantom versions of them. In the US, during an escalating push for government censorship, the balance of power has just tipped dramatically. We don\u2019t know how far it has left to go."

      "text": "The Supreme Court has upheld a Texas law requiring age verification to access adult websites, saying despite First Amendment claims, the law \u201conly incidentally burdens the protected speech of adults.\u201d The ruling, in Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton, opens the door to age-gating in states nationwide.\nThe court ruled in Texas\u2019 favor by a margin of six to three \u2014 with Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissenting \u2014 and the majority opinion was delivered by Clarence Thomas. \u201cThe First Amendment leaves undisturbed States\u2019 traditional power to prevent minors from accessing speech that is obscene from their perspective,\u201d writes Thomas. \u201cThat power includes the power to require proof of age before an individual can access such speech. It follows that no person \u2014 adult or child \u2014 has a First Amendment right to access such speech without first submitting proof of age.\u201d\nFSC v. Paxton, argued in January, concerns the Texas law HB 1181, which requires sites with a large proportion of sexually explicit material to use \u201creasonable age verification methods\u201d to make sure users are at least 18 years old. It\u2019s one of numerous age verification laws enacted across the country for adult content in recent years, and it reached the Supreme Court after being upheld by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. In taking the case, the Supreme Court effectively decided to reconsider a 2004 ruling, Ashcroft v. ACLU, in which it determined a similar rule \u2014 the Child Online Protection Act \u2014 violated the First Amendment.\nThe court says that conclusion (as well as an earlier one on a similar age verification provision in the Communications Decency Act) is no longer appropriate thanks to the forward march of technology. \u201cWith the rise of the smartphone and instant streaming, many adolescents can now access vast libraries of video content \u2014 both benign and obscene \u2014 at almost any time and place, with an ease that would have been unimaginable at the time of Reno and Ashcroft II,\u201d it says.\nNow, \u201cadults have no First Amendment right to avoid age verification\u201d that\u2019s intended to block content deemed obscene for minors, the court ruled. The ruling hinged largely on the court declining to apply the highest level of scrutiny to the law \u2014 a measure that\u2019s required in many speech-related cases and typically is difficult to overcome. Applying that scrutiny might \u201ccall into question all age-verification requirements, even longstanding in-person requirements\u201d to access content that\u2019s outlawed for minors, writes Thomas.\nAt least 21 other states have \u201cmaterially similar\u201d age verification rules for adult content, the ruling notes. It also notes that some sites have already implemented age verification rules, though others \u2014 primarily Pornhub \u2014 have ceased operation in states like Texas instead. Pornhub declined comment on whether, and how, the ruling might affect its operations.\nThere are several possible ways to enact online age verification, but critical evaluations have concluded that few (if any) methods manage to effectively block minors\u2019 access without potentially compromising adults\u2019 privacy \u2014 posing much higher risks than flashing an ID at the door of a brick-and-mortar store. At the time of Ashcroft v. ACLU, the Supreme Court determined that parent-controlled content filters could provide comparable protections without the same risks. But during oral arguments, justices seemed sympathetic to arguments that the internet had become meaningfully more dangerous to children and that these optional methods had failed.\nThe three dissenting justices argued that HB 1181 directly impacted legal speech for adults and should have been subject to the high bar of strict scrutiny, even if it\u2019s possible it would have passed it. \u201cH. B. 1181\u2019s requirements interfere with \u2014 or, in First Amendment jargon, burden \u2014 the access adults have to protected speech: Some individuals will forgo that speech because of the need to identify themselves to a website (and maybe, from there, to the world) as a consumer of sexually explicit expression,\u201d the dissent says.\nIn a statement, Alison Boden, executive director of the Free Speech Coalition \u2014 which represents the adult media industry \u2014 said that \u201cas it has been throughout history, pornography is once again the canary in the coal mine of free expression. The government should not have the right to demand that we sacrifice our privacy and security to use the internet. This law has failed to keep minors away from sexual content yet continues to have a massive chilling effect on adults. The outcome is disastrous for Texans and for anyone who cares about freedom of speech and privacy online.\u201d\nWhile FSC v. Paxton deals with age verification for pornographic content, a similar fight is brewing over verification measures for social media and other web services. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last month made Texas the second state (after Utah) to require mobile app stores to confirm user ages, despite lobbying against the bill by Apple."

  "argos_summary": "The Supreme Court has allowed Mississippi's social media age verification law to take effect while it is being challenged in court, with Justice Kavanaugh noting it may be unconstitutional but that the trade group NetChoice did not demonstrate sufficient risk of harm. This law requires social media platforms to verify users' ages and restrict access for those under 18 without parental consent. Meanwhile, the UK has implemented strict age verification measures under its Online Safety Act, leading to widespread censorship and user backlash, as many platforms have begun requiring age verification to access content, prompting a surge in VPN usage among users seeking to bypass these restrictions.",
