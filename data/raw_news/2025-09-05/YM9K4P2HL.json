  "content": "When every service wants your money, you have to be choosy about which ones you shell out for. And while there are plenty of PC software categories I won\u2019t pay for, I\u2019m happy to spend cash on tools that are worth it.\n\nI\u2019ve paid for several PC apps over time, and would do so again for many of them (or apps in their general categories) if needed. However, the circumstances under which I paid for many of these have changed, which complicates my recommendations.\n\nI never cared for Outlook after using it in college and my first internship, but I have gotten used to Mailbird for desktop mail. It\u2019s useful to have both my work and personal email inboxes in one place, so I don\u2019t have to open a browser tab every time.\n\nMailbird offers a unified inbox tool, which I don\u2019t care for, but it\u2019s nice if you want to see several personal email addresses in one place, for example. The app also lets you access common web tools like Google Calendar, ChatGPT, Evernote, and many more in its sidebar. While I don\u2019t use this often, it helps cut down on the app switching that processing emails can require.\n\nMailbird isn\u2019t perfect; my main gripe is that I paid for a \u201clifetime\u201d subscription that didn\u2019t grant me access to version 3.0 once it launched. It sometimes crashes, and there are a few quirks to get used to, but overall, I\u2019m happy with it as a way to manage my mail. The lifetime payment was worth it, but if the version I\u2019m using ever shuts down, I\u2019d probably switch to Thunderbird to save money.\n\nShortly after I became a tech writer, I learned Markdown and it became my preferred way to write articles. I started with MarkdownPad, and was happy to pay for the Pro version. Once that left active development (and no dark theme was available), I switched to Caret and also paid for its license once I gave it a test. Since then, I\u2019ve tried iA Writer (my current app, which I paid for) and MarkText (which I didn\u2019t pay for).\n\nMarkdown is portable, so you can use it in any text editor (including free tools like VS Code and Notepad++). But for something I do all the time, having that familiar environment that I associate only with writing is worth the cost. I have a poor record with paying for Markdown apps that aren\u2019t supported for long, or that I want to replace because they lack a desired feature.\n\nI still haven\u2019t found one I 100% adore; they all have little weaknesses. For example, iA Writer requires you to hit Ctrl + K to create hyperlinks, instead of being able to paste a link directly onto text to create one. But I still want to support those who create apps that allow me to thrive in my work.\n\nWhen I started writing, the $50 upfront cost of Snagit seemed like a ridiculous fee when solid free screenshot apps exist. But I decided to give it a try once I had more experience, and I was happy with what the app offers.\n\nIf you take screenshots all the time, this app has a wealth of tools that justify the price. Scrolling screenshots to capture long pages, the Simplify option to quickly obfuscate using colors already in the image, and a powerful library that shows captures by app are only a few of the features I love about Snagit.\n\nI don\u2019t use half of what it offers, but have gotten so used to it that I\u2019m happy to pay the grandfathered ~$15/year maintenance fee. However, this comes with a caveat: in July 2025, Snagit moved to a subscription setup. The service now costs $39/year, rather than the option I had to buy the app once for $50 and then pay the maintenance fee to get the latest version each year. At more than double the price, I\u2019d move to ShareX if the company ever stopped honoring my agreement.\n\nMy first password manager was LastPass, which I left in 2019 after it suffered a series of security flaws. I decided to move to 1Password, as I liked the UI and the price was reasonable compared to alternatives. I\u2019ve been using it since (having even added my family onto the plan) and am happy to pay for it.\n\n1Password has great apps for every platform, rarely runs into issues, and adds new features that I appreciate. It makes setting up passkeys a breeze, lets me move logins between vaults to share with family, tells you when a password is compromised, and even lets you add 2FA codes right into the app.\n\nIf I had known about Bitwarden at the time I switched, I would have likely moved to that since its free plan is generous. And if you\u2019re thinking of switching to a password manager, it\u2019s the one I\u2019d recommend since you don\u2019t need to pay for one. But for something so important that I trust the keys to my digital life with it, I\u2019ve been really happy with 1Password.\n\nI know many people are against paying for cloud storage; for some time, I stacked free cloud storage accounts to avoid upgrading. But eventually, I decided that all the time you spend messing around to free up cloud storage space isn\u2019t worth it.\n\nSince Google Photos is the primary place I store my images, I pay $20/year for 100GB of space (which I also share with my wife). Less than $2/month is such a small amount of money when my time is worth a lot more. I think it\u2019s wise to think about your time vs. effort in this way, especially if you\u2019re resistant to paying for even small subscriptions like this.\n\nI also pay for iCloud+, which has several benefits. The main one for me is backing up my devices; it\u2019s not worth saving a few bucks a year to risk the loss of your most important data (and the time it takes to rebuild after losing it).\n\nI used to use CrashPlan to back up to an external drive, but that service no longer caters to home users. Plus, backing up to a secondary drive doesn\u2019t protect your data in case of theft, natural disaster, or similar. I switched to Backblaze, and while it\u2019s gotten pricier over the years, it\u2019s still worth paying for.\n\nIt\u2019s a set-and-forget cloud backup solution that backs up everything important on my PC, plus my secondary storage drives, offsite. If I ever lost my data, including my other backups in cloud storage and secondary drives, I could download them (in the same file structure) using Backblaze\u2019s web panel. The service even has the (paid) option to send you a hard drive with your data on it.\n\nWith the decade-plus of data I have on my PC and the fact that I use it for work every day, $100 per year is worth knowing those files aren\u2019t lost if something awful happened.\n\nEveryone has to determine what\u2019s worth spending money on; I\u2019ve been happy to pay for these (in most cases, annually) for a while. Subscription terms and needs change over time, but I find these tools to be worth the asking price.\n\nWhat kinds of PC software do you think are worth paying for, and why?",

      "text": "While average file sizes continue to get larger, free cloud storage hasn\u2019t kept up. Most cloud storage services include as much, or even less, free space than when they launched over a decade ago. Thankfully, with a bit of clever planning, you can get around this.\nMy History With Cloud Storage\nI\u2019m lucky enough to have started using cloud storage in the golden age, back when providers were more generous. I signed up for a lot of my accounts in 2012; back then, most cloud services offered ways to permanently increase your free storage. These included taking a tour of features, posting about the service on social media, performing security checkups, and using the then-new camera upload features.\nUnfortunately, these have all faded away in modern times. Some Chromebook and Pixel devices come with a limited period of extra storage, but this is a trial for a subscription, not a permanent increase.\nHere\u2019s how much space I have in my cloud accounts now from free methods, compared to the base:\n- Dropbox: 11.9GB, up from 2GB\n- Google Drive: 19GB, up from 15GB\n- OneDrive: 30GB, up from the grandfathered 15GB\nI also use iCloud, but to my knowledge, it\u2019s never had promotions that permanently increase your storage.\nI\u2019ve toyed with other cloud accounts over the years, but these three have consistently been my main ones. The only one I used for a length of time is SugarSync, which I stopped using when its free plan was discontinued in 2014.\nHow Much Storage Can You Get for Free Now?\nWhile I\u2019ve increased my free storage well beyond the baselines, don\u2019t feel bad if you missed these chances. You can still stack several free cloud storage services to get a nice chunk of space for no cost.\nHere\u2019s a sampling of what\u2019s available now, with a mix of popular and lesser-known cloud services:\n- Google Drive: 15GB (shared with Google Photos and Gmail)\n- OneDrive: 5GB\n- iCloud: 5GB\n- Sync.com: 5GB\n- MEGA: 20GB, with 10GB more available for a year when you install the desktop and mobile apps\n- pCloud: 2GB initially; 10GB after completing the tutorial\n- Proton Drive: 5GB\n- Box: 10GB\nWith a few new accounts, app downloads, and quick tutorials, that\u2019s 75GB (plus another 10GB from MEGA for your first year). Not bad, considering paid cloud plans usually start at 100GB.\nI recommend skipping Dropbox, as the paltry 2GB of space isn\u2019t worth adding another service to your setup. The service still offers free storage for referrals (500MB each), but given how long Dropbox has been around, it\u2019s hard to find someone who isn\u2019t already using it.\nThis isn\u2019t an exhaustive list of cloud storage providers, but it will get you started with a solid amount of storage without splitting it among too many services.\nYou\u2019ll find other underrated cloud storage providers that might work for you. In particular, TeraBox offers 1TB for free, but the experience is rough. Don\u2019t trust any old provider without vetting it, though.\nA Multi-Cloud Management Strategy\nNow that you have all this free storage, the fun part is deciding how to use it. To start, make sure you download the apps for each of these services on your computer and sign in, so everything syncs.\nWhile I\u2019ve become messier with my organization over time, what I used to do is split files by type across services. For example, I kept documents in Dropbox, images in Google Drive, and videos/music in OneDrive. That way, I\u2019d know where to go depending on what I was looking for.\nYou don\u2019t have to be that rigid, though. A simple option is to create folders as you normally would, roughly split up by how much space you think they\u2019ll take. Then pin them to Quick Access in File Explorer so you can jump right to them, without having to think about which folder lives on which cloud service.\nTo go further, try adjusting the Windows Libraries feature to include your folders across all services. This lets you choose folders, no matter where they are in your file hierarchy, that all become part of base groups like Documents or Pictures. You can even create your own libraries if that\u2019s not enough.\nGet started by right-clicking any folder and choosing Include in library, followed by the applicable one. Then, when you open this library, you\u2019ll see files and folders from everywhere in one location.\nManaging Multiple Cloud Accounts\nThird-party Windows apps allow you to access all your cloud storage in File Explorer, which is super handy when you\u2019re juggling so many. MultCloud is another tool that facilitates managing several cloud accounts in one place.\nWhen working with limited space, be cognizant of what you\u2019re storing in each one. Documents you reference regularly, treasured photos, and the like are better cloud fits than giant videos. If you need to store a lot of huge files, an external storage drive is a better investment.\nCloud storage is part of my multi-layer backup solution, which is another way I recommend putting it to use. I keep almost all my regularly-used files in cloud storage, so if anything happens to my computer, I can quickly access them on another device.\nI also use Backblaze for a proper off-site backup, in case I get locked out of one of my cloud accounts, a corrupted file gets synced, or similar. Finally, I use File History on Windows to have a local copy of files on a secondary storage drive.\nPaying a Little Can Get You a Lot\nIf you don\u2019t have a lot of large files, stacking free cloud storage like this is a viable solution. You can always add another 5-10GB to the pile by signing up for another service, if you run low. However, if splitting accounts up like this becomes too tedious, don\u2019t dismiss the idea of paying for cloud storage.\nI currently pay $20/year for 100GB of Google Drive space through Google One, which is well worth it, plus $3/month for 200GB of iCloud storage. Google Photos is my primary photo backup service; I also share the Google storage space with my wife so she doesn\u2019t worry about running out.\nI primarily pay for iCloud to store my iPhone backups; with the extra space, I also back up my photos to iCloud for redundancy since photos are the most precious data we keep on our phones.\nMy thinking on this is similar to ad-free streaming services compared to those with ads. Yes, ad-supported streaming services are cheaper (or free, in some cases). But your time is worth a lot. With streaming, spending a few extra dollars is much preferred to wasting hours watching ads every month. And with cloud services, paying a small amount means you don\u2019t have to deal with the hassle of managing multiple accounts, several apps syncing on your PC at the same time, and similar.\nIf you\u2019re thinking about upgrading, a few dollars a month is worth eliminating the hassle of juggling files across accounts. The cheapest cloud storage providers start around $20/year for 100GB, which is a good starting point.\nEven though free cloud storage hasn\u2019t kept up with the times, you can get plenty of space at no cost with patience and a proper setup. It should provide enough to keep your essential files accessible anywhere you go, which forms a key part of backing up everything without any subscriptions."

      "text": "I\u2019m happy to spend money on software when it\u2019s worth it; the problem is that plenty of software categories don\u2019t justify their price. Whether one-time purchases or subscriptions, I won\u2019t shell out for PC software that falls into these categories.\n7 PC cleaning tools\nWe\u2019ve all seen shady PC cleaning apps; they even used to be on TV. But even for legitimate PC cleanup tools, I wouldn\u2019t pay a cent. This is because Windows already includes the core tools (Disk Cleanup and Storage Sense) you need to clean up your system.\nThere\u2019s no need to spend anything, let alone a subscription, on a PC cleaner. Instead, follow a quick Windows cleanup guide, then set up automatic PC cleanups so you don\u2019t have to spend time on it in the future.\nIf those aren\u2019t enough for you, free third-party apps can help out. TreeSize is my longtime favorite app for seeing which folders are taking up the most space, though lots of people like WizTree (which I haven\u2019t tried).\n6 Antivirus suites\nSecurity suites are one of the subscriptions I can\u2019t believe people spend money on. Windows has strong protection built-in, and the paid versions of these tools don\u2019t increase the core malware protection. Rather, they bundle in tools like VPNs and password managers.\nI already have a VPN and password manager I like, so I\u2019m not interested in paying more to switch to ones that are almost certainly worse. I also don\u2019t appreciate how these apps constantly nag free users to upgrade, often with deceptive warnings about \u201closing protection\u201d if they don\u2019t pay up.\nI paid for a lifetime Malwarebytes subscription long ago, and still have it installed. But I wouldn\u2019t pay for it now if the terms of my subscription changed. In fact, it\u2019s been disappointing to see how a once-great app that stood apart from other security tools has succumbed to many of the same tactics.\n5 File compression tools\n\u201cPaying for WinRAR\u201d is one of the longest-running jokes online; the file compression and extraction tool is infamous for being a \u201cpaid\u201d app with an endless trial that never forces you to pay. There\u2019s zero reason to pay for WinRAR or any tools like it.\nWindows has native support for unzipping a lot of compressed file formats; for anything else you come across, 7-Zip does a fine job. I\u2019ve been using 7-Zip for over a decade, and aside from its dated looks, it\u2019s still great. Paying for such a tool wouldn\u2019t benefit me or any other home user.\n4 Driver updaters\nIt\u2019s important to keep your key drivers updated, but driver updaters aren\u2019t the best way to do that. They\u2019re notorious for downloading the wrong drivers, installing them incorrectly, or creating similar issues that are worse than leaving the driver outdated.\nPaying for a driver updater tool adds another layer of unnecessary on top of all this. I\u2019m not going to spend money on a tool that might not even update my drivers correctly; the fallout from issues is too high if something goes wrong. That\u2019s the case even with a \u201cfree trail\u201d\u2014I'm not trusting a tool to handle these functions when the team behind it can't even proofread.\nInstead, I let Windows Update install basic driver updates, use AMD\u2019s software for GPU updates, and run my motherboard\u2019s utility for the core system drivers. No need to pay, and less risk of something going wrong.\n3 Note-taking apps\nAll the above apps are tools I find useless and don\u2019t think anyone should pay for. This category is different; I recognize the value that paid note-taking tools have for some, but don\u2019t feel the need to use them myself.\nI went through all four college years with OneNote, using only a fraction of its capabilities, and never felt the need to upgrade to something more powerful. More recently, I\u2019ve switched to Notion for meeting notes, and I use Simplenote for jotting down quick notes I don\u2019t need for as long. These tools are plenty for me; $15/month or more for a tool like Evernote would be a waste.\nThere\u2019s already so much I don\u2019t use in Notion; I\u2019d want to exhaust all that before I ever thought about paying for a note-taker app. Apps like Goodnotes look great, but they aren\u2019t for me.\n2 PDF tools\nI had the paid version of Nitro PDF from a previous job, which did come in handy for doing heavy PDF editing. But in the years since, I\u2019ve realized there are free tools to handle any edits you might have.\nPDFgear is the main one, which I\u2019ve recently downloaded and have been happy with. It includes a range of tools to work with PDFs, including merging, splitting, compressing, and converting. It also allows you to edit a PDF, and all this comes free.\nSome folks might need to pay for a PDF editor if they work with them all day. But for my needs, this isn\u2019t worth paying for. PDFs are best when they are the final versions of a document that aren\u2019t meant to change, anyway.\n1 AI tools\nI\u2019ve explained before that I really don\u2019t like AI tools. I occasionally use them to help with ideas or when I can\u2019t find an answer elsewhere online, but I have no interest in AI image generation, having AI \u201cdo work\u201d for me, or otherwise spending time with these tools.\nI don\u2019t like AI being shoved into everything. It\u2019s wrong about topics I\u2019m knowledgeable in too often for me to trust it with information in areas I don\u2019t know as much about. The deep research capabilities of AI models are the most helpful use case I can see for the paid models; even then, I\u2019d rather watch a human-made YouTube video on a subject to learn more it instead of reading what an AI cobbles together.\nSome AI integrations are useful (like Google Sheets letting you write formulas in plain language), but not enough that I\u2019d pay for them.\nTo some extent, which PC apps are worth paying for depends on how you work. I\u2019m happy to pay for tools that enhance my workflow, but these kinds are either unnecessary or have free alternatives that do all I need."

      "text": "You likely upgraded to iCloud+ because the 5GB of free storage is far too limiting, but don\u2019t think that paid iCloud plans are only about more storage. There are many other subscription perks you\u2019re missing out on.\n6 Share space with loved ones\niCloud+ plans are available from 50GB all the way up to 12TB. And while you might use 50GB or even 200GB by yourself, you can put any unused storage to good use by inviting your friends and family.\nOnce you set up an Apple Family Sharing group, up to 6 people total can use your iCloud storage. Even better, they all get access to the benefits below for their own accounts, so you don\u2019t have to pay to upgrade every account individually.\nOn your iPhone, open Settings, tap your name at the top, then choose Family. Walk through the instructions to set up a Family Sharing group and invite your family members (or whoever else you want to add).\nOnce they\u2019re in the Family, they\u2019ll have access to the shared pool of storage, plus the below features. You can return here later to manage the group.\nIf you use other Apple services like Apple Arcade or Apple Music, consider subscribing to Apple One to bundle the services and save money.\n5 iCloud Private Relay\nPrivate Relay is a feature that obfuscates your browsing in Safari to make it harder for online entities to track you. It scrambles your IP address when you connect to a website, so sites and your network provider have a harder time connecting your activity to your name.\nIt\u2019s not as powerful as a VPN, since you can\u2019t choose the location of the remote server, and it only works in Safari. It\u2019s not a one-click privacy solution, as there are many other ways you\u2019re tracked online. But if you\u2019re paying for iCloud+ already, it\u2019s worth turning on.\nOn your iPhone, head to Settings > [Your name] > iCloud, then choose Private Relay in the iCloud+ Features box. Once you\u2019ve turned it on, you can select IP Address Location if you want to keep your fake IP close to your actual location, or obfuscate further by only using your country and time zone.\nApple also says this will \u201cprotect your unencrypted internet traffic\u201d, but given that the vast majority of websites use encrypted connections now, this isn\u2019t a major concern.\n4 Hide My Email\nWe\u2019ve all received a deluge of junk email after signing up for a service. Next time you need to sign up for something but don\u2019t want to provide your true email address, iCloud+ has an easy solution. Hide My Email can create as many random email addresses for various services as you like.\nIf you\u2019d like to generate a fresh email address to use later, head to Settings > [Your name] > iCloud, then scroll down to the iCloud+ Features box and tap Hide My Email. Tap Create New Address and you\u2019ll get a random address. If you don\u2019t like it for whatever reason, hit Use Different Address to try again.\nAfter you tap Continue, you\u2019ll see a prompt to label the address and add an optional note. This is a good place to note the service you use it for, how long you expect to use it, etc.\nYou\u2019ll also see prompts to create a throwaway email address elsewhere on your phone, such as when you tap the Email field on a website in Safari or compatible apps on your phone. It also appears around Apple apps like Mail, Apple Pay, or iCloud.com.\nUpon returning to the Hide My Email page, you\u2019ll see a list of the addresses you\u2019ve created. Tap one to adjust its note or label; you can also deactivate it if it\u2019s receiving too much junk or it\u2019s not useful to you anymore.\nThe Forward To box lets you control where mail from these secondary addresses goes. You can choose any inbox connected to your Apple account.\n3 A custom email domain\nI hadn\u2019t looked into this cool perk of iCloud+ until now. If you own a web domain or are open to buying one, you can create a custom email address at that domain using iCloud+. This is cheaper and simpler than paying for email hosting from a dedicated host, so it\u2019s worth setting up if you want a more professional email domain on your website, resume, social profiles, or similar.\nHead to the same iCloud+ Features box mentioned above, then tap Custom Email. You\u2019ll see an overview page; tap Continue to walk through the steps. Since this requires you to own a web domain, you must either supply the credentials for your domain, or the wizard will walk you through purchasing a domain from Cloudflare.\nThanks to Family Sharing, the feature also lets you invite up to five family members who can each have their own email addresses. There\u2019s even a feature to have all mail sent to any address at the domain forwarded to you. So, for example, if you hadn\u2019t set up contact@yourdomain.com yet, your account would still receive a message sent to that address, instead of the sender getting an \u201cundeliverable\u201d response.\nThere are a few technical bits to configure, but this tool will take you through the process. You might wish to use a web domain comparison tool like TLD-List to shop for the best prices, rather than buying one through the feature setup. Domain hosting companies regularly have newcomer sales; be sure to look at the yearly renewal price and not only the promo price for the first year.\nBe aware that the storage of any email accounts you use in this way counts towards your iCloud+ storage limit. You may need to clear space in your iCloud account.\n2 HomeKit video storage\nIf you have HomeKit-compatible security cameras in your house, iCloud+ includes access to and storage for their video feeds. It\u2019s available in the Home app, and like the other functions, allows you to share access with others.\nBy default, those you add can see the camera feeds when home, but need your permission to access the feeds while they\u2019re out. The footage also doesn\u2019t count towards your iCloud storage, which is great.\nIf you haven\u2019t added your cameras to the Home app already, open it on your phone, then tap the Plus icon to set the cameras up. To make sure you have Home data saved in iCloud, head back to the Settings > [Your name] > iCloud menu. Tap See All in the Saved to iCloud box, then make sure Home is enabled.\nYour iCloud+ plan tier affects the number of cameras you can add. The 50GB plan includes one camera, the 200GB tier includes up to five cameras, and the 2TB and above tiers allow you to add unlimited cameras.\n1 Apple Invites\nApple Invites is a strange app. It allows you to create dynamic digital invites for in-person (or virtual) events. Anyone can reply to an invitation sent with the app, but you need iCloud+ to create one.\nThere are some cool ideas with Apple Invites, like automatically sharing weather and address info so everyone has the full details. You can also post messages in case of last-minute updates, create collaborative Apple Music playlists to feature at the event, and create a shared photo album to record the memory.\nIf everyone you\u2019re inviting to the party is an Apple user, and the event is fancy enough to warrant an official invitation, it\u2019s worth giving a try. Otherwise, I can\u2019t see most people using this instead of a quick group text or similar.\nAn iCloud+ subscription provides a lot of value, especially considering that you can enjoy all these benefits at the cheapest $1/month tier. Even if you don\u2019t need much extra iCloud space, one or more of these features can make the low subscription fee worth a try."

      "text": "Quick Links\nDespite using online mail clients and native email apps, Mailbird is my go-to option for keeping everything in check. Managing multiple email accounts can be a hassle, but Mailbird turns the chaos into simplicity.\n1 I Can Quickly Delete Unnecessary Emails\nInbox zero is one of the most effective ways I stop myself from feeling overwhelmed, but I've never been a big fan of doing this within native email client apps. Rather than clicking on buttons, Mailbird is\u2014in my opinion\u2014more intuitive. All I have to do is hit the backspace key on my computer, and the message is automatically sent to the Trash folder.\nThis is significantly more effective than my previous methods, which would normally involve one of the following:\n- Marking all messages as read and then going through to delete all unnecessary emails.\n- Clicking on emails to stop them from appearing in my unread folder (but still keeping them in my inbox).\n- Manually sifting through and ticking or hitting the trash icon next to each email I didn't want to keep.\nMy inbox has become much more organized since moving to Mailbird, and as a result, I can get around to everything with greater ease.\nIf you try Mailbird and disagree, you can always try managing Gmail newsletters without cluttering your inbox.\n2 It's Easy to Customize the Toolbar and Set Up Folders\nMailbird offers a handful of handy features that have helped me customize the left-hand toolbar. As a result, I can access my emails more efficiently. The Custom avatar tool is one of those. To differentiate my inboxes, I've picked a suitable icon for each of my connected inboxes. For example, my personal address has an icon with a cat sitting on a couch; this is to symbolize being at home.\nOn the other hand, my work email address has a graph next to it. I picked the graph to signal growth and because it was instantly recognizable. You can pick 30 icons altogether.\nI also like how Mailbird lets me pick the folders I want to appear on the left-hand side. Besides choosing from the most important messages and different labels, I can also create custom folders for each inbox if needed; these are accessible by further expanding the left-hand toolbar.\nTo edit these settings, you can click on the settings icon. I can also select Manage Folders to organize folders specifically.\n3 Syncing Calendars for Seamless Scheduling\nContext-switching is my biggest productivity killer, and as a result, I like to keep as many tools in one place as possible. And while I rarely use Gmail's web client now, I still wanted to keep my calendar in the same place as my emails. Thankfully, I can synchronize my calendars and view them within the app.\nI like how I can access several productivity-boosting Google Calendar features without leaving the Mailbird app. I can not only see upcoming events but also create new ones. If I wish to add extra calendars, I also have the option to do this within the app.\nUsing Google Calendar Add-Ons in Mailbird\nAnother cool feature is the ability to integrate numerous apps within Google Calendar and access them via Mailbird. For example, I have Keep, Tasks, and Maps. Other handy tools you can add if you wish are Zoom and Streak.\nHow to Add Google Calendar to Mailbird\nTo integrate Google Calendar with Mailbird, all I had to do was follow these steps.\n- Go to the Browse apps icon at the top of the Mailbird interface.\n- Toggle Google Calendar on.\n- Sign into Google Calendar on the right-hand side.\n- Tick the boxes next to each calendar you wish to show.\n- Click on the Google Calendar icon at the top of the app to open it in full-screen mode.\nYou can access Google Calendar regardless of which email tab you're currently on. At first, the app may only show on the right-hand side. I don't recommend using this view as it's too congested. If that happens, try clicking the top Google Calendar icon again; it should now consume most of your screen.\nAlthough Mailbird integrates with Google Calendar, it's not possible to use Outlook Calendar or the Apple equivalent with the app.\n4 It's Easy to Integrate My Favorite Apps With Mailbird\nFurther helping my battle against context-switching is the ability to add and access a few more of my favorite tools within Mailbird. Below are two main use case examples; like Google Calendar, you'll need to toggle these apps on and then sign into your account.\n1. Todoist\nWhen using Todoist in Mailbird, I can browse and customize numerous templates. These cover the same ones that you'll find when using Todoist's site/app, such as yearly reviews, managing your finances, and starting a side hustle. So, if you're looking for tools that'll help you track your New Year's resolutions, consider using Todoist and Mailbird together.\nYou can to set up recurring tasks in Todoist and create ordinary to-do assignments without leaving the Mailbird app.\n2. ChatGPT\nI use ChatGPT every single day to plan my work life, create new daily schedules, optimize my gym workouts, and much more. Besides the basic chat mode, you can use several custom GPTs to get more accurate responses.\nAfter signing into ChatGPT through Mailbird, I can access the essential features (e.g. starting a conversation). Everything automatically syncs, allowing for a more seamless workflow. Using ChatGPT in Mailbird is particularly helpful if you need help crafting an email response or want to research something without going to your browser.\n5 I Can Streamline Emails in a Unified Inbox\nRather than manually signing into each email account via my browser, I use Mailbird to manage my emails through its unified inbox. I can quickly delete emails that I don't want to take further action on and star anything that requires my attention later. Doing this has saved me over an hour each week since I started.\nKnowing which email account each message belongs to can be confusing at first, but you'll quickly grasp everything. Moreover, when you open a message, you'll see the associated account.\nI've yet to see a better way to manage multiple email addresses than Mailbird, and I'm so happy I switched over. I can organize my work and personal emails from the same place, and it integrates with many of my favorite apps. I've been able to significantly reduce context-switching and multitasking, which has resulted in better productivity."

      "text": "HTML and WYSIWYG (\"what you see is what you get\") editors are two common ways to format text in the internet age. But neither of these are ideal for writers. HTML is clunky and unintuitive for non-programmers, and WYSIWYG editors slow you down by requiring your mouse to format text.\nMarkdown is a better way to write. Here's why you should start using Markdown and where it comes in handy.\nWhat Is Markdown?\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language that makes it easy to add basic formatting like headers, bold and italics, and bulleted lists to plain text. It allows you to format text without having to worry about HTML tags, and you don't have to remove your fingers from the keyboard like you do with WYSIWYG editors, such as Microsoft Word.\nUsing Markdown comes in handy for writing emails, notes, to-do lists, blog posts, and other content for the web. We've written a guide to getting started with Markdown, which will teach you the essential tags and how to put Markdown in practice.\nHere, we're going to focus on why you should learn Markdown and places where it's practical.\nWhy Markdown Is More Convenient Than HTML\nHTML is one of the backbones of the web, but it's not terribly convenient to use when you just want to format text in writing. The tags take a while to type, and are easy to mess up if you're not using a special editor that completes them for you.\nFor example, this is how you write an H2 heading using HTML:\n<h2>This is a heading</h2>\nIn Markdown, this is:\n## This is a heading\nHolding Shift to type two hash symbols is much faster than the finger antics required to type the lesser than and greater than symbols with whatever heading number you want in between. It's also easy to miss a / in a closing tag, leading to incorrect output where you have to waste time figuring out what went wrong.\nThis goes for all the Markdown formatting we talked about in the guide linked above. A bullet list that simply uses a hyphen for each item, for instance, is way faster than using </ul> to open and close a list, with <li> for each list item.\nWhy Markdown Is Faster Than WYSIWYG Editors\nMarkdown's main advantage over WYSIWYG editors is that you don't have to move your mouse all over the place to select various formatting options. When you write in an app like Microsoft Word, there are tons of options in the various toolbars. Taking your hands off the keyboard to mouse around in these menus takes up time that you could spend writing, and breaks your focus.\nAnd while these apps do have keyboard shortcuts for some functions, they often aren't convenient or intuitive. Markdown strips out all the noise and lets you focus on the essentials.\nAnother issue with WYSIWYG editors is that they often don't translate cleanly to HTML. If you want an app that you can write in and then copy as HTML to paste into WordPress or similar, you'll likely get a whole bunch of extra junk when you copy from Google Docs, Word, etc. Markdown better translates to HTML.\nMarkdown Is Easy to Read\nReading through a bunch of HTML while trying to focus on the content of the writing is a difficult task. Markdown's minimal formatting means that you can still focus on the words without the formatting getting in the way.\nAdditionally, most dedicated Markdown writers have a preview panel side-by-side with the writing area. This allows you to see the Markdown as you work, while also being able to keep an eye on what it will look like when published. You don't have to guess how it will turn out, and it's easy to tell right away if you've messed something up.\nWhere Can You Use Markdown?\nIn case you're not sure where Markdown actually comes in handy, take a look at these places around the web where it's supported.\n1. Reddit and Forum Posts\nA lot of forums on the web, including Reddit, provide Markdown support for writing your posts. For all the reasons discussed above, this makes it easy to write out comments and posts when using these services.\nYou don't have to learn the specifics of each forum's WYSIWYG editor\u2014just jump in with the Markdown you've learned and go for it. Not all forums use the same version of Markdown, so there may be slight variances. But this shouldn't cause any major slowdowns.\n2. Note-Taking Apps\nA good number of to-do list and note-taking apps support Markdown. While you might not need text formatting all the time in apps like this, it's a nice way to create headings to organize your notes, or bold items to make sure they catch your attention.\nSimplenote is a great no-frills note-taking app, available on every platform, that supports Markdown. We'd recommend it if you're looking for a lightweight note-taking app where you can put your new Markdown knowledge to use.\n3. Personal Wikis\nIf you like creating your own databases of notes, tasks, planning, and similar, then setting up a personal wiki is something worth trying. Apps like TiddlyWiki support Markdown through a plugin, to make adding entries to your wiki easy.\nYou might prefer this over apps like OneNote, which don't support Markdown.\n4. Writing for the Web\nIf you often write blog posts using services like WordPress, writing in Markdown provides a better alternative. In addition to the benefits discussed above, you can also write offline so that your work isn't lost if the connection drops.\nAnd dedicated Markdown writers make it easy to export to whatever form you need for publishing.\nTry Using Markdown Today\nWe've looked at the reasons Markdown is worth using in a variety of scenarios. Simply put, Markdown is more intuitive than HTML and more convenient than WYSIWYG editors. You don't have to memorize a bunch of complex tags, you can keep your fingers on the keys, and it's portable across services.\nTo help out in the beginning, you might keep a Markdown cheat sheet around as a reference.\nImage Credit: tmicons/Shutterstock"

      "url": "https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-start-using-passkeys/",
      "text": "Quick Links\nSummary\n- Passkeys are a more secure, convenient, and faster alternative to passwords.\n- Major online accounts support passkeys; enabling them is easy and ensures stronger security.\n- Storing passkeys securely is critical; consider how to recover them if you lose your device.\nThere is no getting around the fact that passwords are a pain. While they're the primary method we use to keep our accounts secure, they're increasingly easy for hackers to crack or access through data breaches.\nPasskeys aim to fix the drawbacks of passwords while also promising to be easier to use and harder to forget. If you haven't already, it's time to switch to passkeys, and here's how you get started.\nWhat Are Passkeys and Why Should You Switch?\nAs you might already know, passkeys are a way to access your online accounts without using a password. Instead of typing in a password to log in as you usually would, passkeys use another device, such as your phone or laptop, as an authenticator.\nThis can include anything from a simple PIN to biometric authentication. When using passkeys, you're authenticated based on your possession of the device, compared to logging in with a specific password.\nThere are several advantages to this approach. Since no passwords are involved, you can't be targeted with a phishing attack. Other disadvantages of using a password, like having it stolen, guessed, or cracked by a hacker, also don't apply. You also don't need to remember different passwords for different online accounts.\nThere are tons of differences between passwords and passkeys, and it's not like there are no disadvantages to using passwordless authentication, but overall, passkeys are a much more convenient, faster, and more secure way of signing in.\nWhat Sites and Services Use Passkeys?\nPasskeys are constantly increasing in popularity and usage, and you can find them on major sites and services, including those from Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others.\n- Enabling passkeys on your Google account is simple: head over to the Google Passkeys page, set up your passkey with your device, and you're good to go.\n- Similarly, setting up passkeys on your Microsoft account only takes a few minutes. You can use your face or fingerprint, or if your PC isn't equipped with Windows Hello-capable hardware, you can always use a PIN or security key.\n- Setting up passkeys for an Apple device is also simple, and they integrate with the iCloud Keychain.\nThese three are just a snapshot of the services that now support passkeys (they also happen to be some of the largest tech companies in the world!). But you'll find passkey support on Amazon, Adobe, Discord, Ebay, Github, LinkedIn, Shopify, WhatsApp, and many more websites and apps. Passkeys Who Supports Passkeys is a great place to find other options.\nWhat Happens if You Lose Your Device?\nAs you can probably guess, using a physical device as a means of authentication means that you need to possess the device to log into a passkey-enabled service. So, what happens if you lose your device?\nThe answer depends on how you store your passkeys. Most big tech companies allow users to sync their passkeys between devices or securely store them in the cloud via end-to-end encryption. So, if you lose your phone, you can always restore your passkeys when you get a new one.\nHowever, if you're using a hardware security key that doesn't have any backups, or if you choose not to store your passkey online or sync it with another device, you're out of luck. Yes, using a physical device to log into a digital account is more secure, but it is akin to losing your house keys. Losing your passkeys can mean you won't be able to log into your account anymore.\nAnother thing you might be concerned about when using passkeys is that if a thief or hacker gets access to your phone, they might get access to all your online accounts. While that's technically true, remember that your phone isn't as easy to get into for someone who doesn't have your face, fingerprints, or PIN. Even if a hacker bypasses your phone's authentication, they'll have to provide biometric authentication or your PIN whenever they try accessing sensitive account settings.\nLastly, all secret passkey information is stored in a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) that's specifically designed to store secure information in such a way that it's virtually impenetrable. So you can be pretty sure that as long as your device is locked (which you can even do remotely for both Android and iOS devices), not much information is getting out. Even if someone manages to unlock your phone, they can't access your account's credentials.\nWhy Passkeys Are the Future of Authentication\nAny online account, no matter how trivial it might be to you, is a potential target for hackers lurking about on the internet. While passwords have kept us relatively safe so far, they're far from perfect, not to mention difficult to manage, given the increasing number of online accounts the average person has. Sure, you can use password managers to keep track of your passwords, but that doesn't protect you from phishing attacks and data breaches.\nPasskeys are the future of authentication as more and more online services and physical devices move to use physical means of authentication instead of a string of text that can be guessed, cracked, breached, or otherwise fails to protect your online presence."

      "text": "Quick Links\nAlthough Windows' Snipping Tool has improved lately, it still leaves a lot to be desired. I didn't fully realize how limited it was until I tried ShareX. This free, open-source tool has quickly become my go-to for screen capturing, and I don't see myself returning to Snipping Tool.\n1 Various Capture Options\nWhile Snipping Tool only offers basic options for screen capturing\u2014such as rectangular, window, full screen, and freeform captures\u2014ShareX goes well beyond. One of my favorites is scrolling capture, which lets me capture long web pages or documents.\nAnother useful option is the ability to record screen activity as GIFs. I often use this to demonstrate steps or show small interactions in my articles. There's also the auto-capture function, which I use occasionally. With it, I can set ShareX to take screenshots automatically at specific intervals.\n2 Convenient Annotation Tools\nWhen it comes to annotating screenshots, Snipping Tool doesn\u2019t offer enough options to meet my needs. Sure, it allows me to add shapes, emojis, and some freehand drawing, but that\u2019s about it.\nWith ShareX I can add text, speech bubbles, and even step numbers to guide viewers through a screenshot. What I find especially useful is the ability to blur or pixelate parts of an image, which makes it incredibly easy to hide sensitive information.\nShareX also includes a magnification tool, so I can quickly highlight important parts of a screenshot. Having all of these annotation features built into the app means I no longer need to rely on third-party apps to edit my screen captures, as it's all right there in the same app.\n3 Image Editing Tools\nBeyond simple annotations, ShareX offers plenty of options to refine my screenshots. After capturing something, I can simply right-click on the image and choose Add image effects to add borders, watermarks, or unique backgrounds. It even lets me make adjustments\u2014like cropping, resizing, and scaling\u2014directly within the app.\nThe best part? I can create and save specific presets for any of these adjustments. So, if I want all my screenshots to have the same crop size or a specific watermark, I can create a preset and apply it without having to manually redo the steps every time.\nAnother feature I've come to rely on is batch editing. If I need to apply the same effects to multiple images, ShareX lets me do that all at once. This is especially useful when I'm working on projects that require a consistent style across several images.\n4 Automatic Cloud Uploads\nOne of my favorite things about ShareX is its seamless handling of cloud uploads. It supports various cloud storage services, including Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, and Mega.\nAdditionally, if I need to quickly share an image online, I can upload it to popular image-hosting services like Flickr, Imgur, Photobucket, and ImageShack, directly from ShareX.\nSetting this up is easy, too\u2014I simply need to head to Destinations > Destination settings, link my accounts, and I\u2019m good to go. After capturing a screenshot or video, I can press Ctrl + U in the editor window and enjoy the seamless upload process. I can also set captures to automatically upload to different services if I want, as well.\nThe sheer convenience of this is something the Snipping Tool simply can\u2019t match.\n5 Keyboard Shortcuts Support\nA large part of what makes capturing, editing, and uploading screenshots with ShareX so convenient for me is its extensive support for keyboard shortcuts. With ShareX, I can use shortcuts to capture my screen in a variety of ways\u2014whether it\u2019s a full-screen capture, a specific region, a scrolling capture, or even screen recording.\nI'm not stuck with the default shortcuts; I can customize them to suit my workflow. This is a huge step up from the Snipping Tool, where I had to manually select different options depending on what I wanted to capture.\nAll in all, ShareX offers far more flexibility, automation, and customization than I ever expected to need in a screen capture app. If you're still using the Snipping Tool, give ShareX a shot\u2014you might be surprised at how much more productive you can be."

      "text": "\u201cMy favorite iOS app for writing in Markdown, without question, is iA Writer iA Writer is just beautiful. To me it\u2019s the gold standard for Markdown syntax styling \u2014 great colors, real italic and bold styling for _italic_ and **bold** spans, and, my very favorite touch, outdented #\u2019s for headings. iA Writer is even so presumptuous as to only use its own custom typefaces: Mono, Duo, and Quattro. But they pull it off \u2014 all three of iA Writer\u2019s typefaces are very good (I\u2019m a Duo man myself). The best way I can put it is that iA Writer is a classy app. BBEdit and MarsEdit are like pint glasses or coffee mugs. Occasionally, though, the mood calls for an elegant champagne flute. That\u2019s iA Writer for me.\u201d \u2013John Gruber, Creator of Markdown\n\u201cLike many professional writers, I reluctantly used Microsoft Word, and Apple\u2019s Pages worked slightly better for me, but I still felt that it had too many distractions. When I write, I want to be able to concentrate on ideas, words, phrases and storylines. The last thing I need is software nagging me with features irrelevant to the writing process. Since I discovered iA Writer, I\u2019ve used it as my main writing tool. It has the simplicity of a typewriter, which is why I love it. It\u2019s just letters, sentences and paragraphs that form angles, headlines, narratives, articles and scripts. There\u2019s no noise, no interference and no clutter. There\u2019s also no hiding from what you really need to do, which is to wrestle with words and craft a compelling read.\u201d \u2013Dimitri Michels, Senior Copywriter, Amsterdam.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a professional writer, but I write for recreation and the cleanness of the iA writer platform really helps me get into a mood where writing is relaxing. I used to write in MS Word, Pages and Google Docs. But writing felt very structured and less driven by creativity. After finding iA Writer, writing has become more of a flow. I find I\u2019m not concerned at all by end formatting or choosing a font. And I\u2019m not distracted by menu bars, which is a plus when working on a smaller screen like an iPad Pro.\u201d \u2013Kenneth Saw, Project Manager, Australia.\n\u201cMy creative writing work was a disorganized mess of files before iA Writer. Finding iA Writer brought clarity, organization, and regular, focused writing. I have written the best poetry of my life in iA Writer.\u201d \u2013Dan Knauss, Web Designer, Writer, Canada.\n\u201cAs a volunteer, I teach a course in programming and general nerdiness to a group of children on the autistic spectrum. It turned out that it wasn\u2019t all that easy to find the right course material and I ended up writing it myself and turning it into something of a proper book. Seeing the children actually use my material and improve themselves, having fun with it, changed something in me, but I think also in those children. Some of them really found their future in what we were teaching them. I doubt that I would\u2019ve undertaken writing that course material if I wasn\u2019t confident that my editor wouldn\u2019t be in my way.\u201d \u2013David van Gemeren, Creative Director, Netherlands.\n\u201cBefore I started using iA Writer I was, to put it bluntly, all over the place and too easily distracted. Writer changed all that for me. I immediately fell in love with the beautiful streamlined look and feel of the app. No distractions, a beautiful uncluttered look and an elegant typeface. This all meant that the writing flowed more easily. The year after iA Writer was launched, I used it to write a story which was performed on the radio, and at a literary festival, winning a major radio award here in Ireland. That story pretty much was the real start of my writing life. Since then I have had many short stories, poems and non-fiction articles published and broadcast on national and local radio.\u201d -Patrick Griffin, Writer, Ireland\n\u201cBefore iA Writer, I didn\u2019t really write much. But at some point I was looking for a simple Markdown editor. Three years later, I find myself using this editor to think. I write my process, then grind over it to find flaws until I make things clear. The documents I deliver to my team benefit from this too. But the outcome I had never expected was something else. I just began writing fiction. I can not recall why or when, I had not put two words together for pure leisure probably since I was twelve, but suddenly, I felt compelled, there was something inside me trying to get out, and now a monster of hundreds of thousands of words is taking all my free time, and I am happier than ever. I started writing a thriller, spies in the middle of a made-up war in the nineties. But this year real life struck me hard and I switched to romance, looking for something cheerier. Also with spies, of course. One can never get enough spies in a story. I will never know whether iA Writer had anything to do with this or not, but I feel confident it did because I had not felt so comfortable using a piece of software before. It doesn\u2019t get in my way, it is calm but inviting, inspiring in its raw elegance. It just feels right. I dare to say iA Writer helped me see how much I can love writing.\u201d -Inmaculada Bermejo Salar, UX Designer, Writer, Spain\n\u201cI\u2019m dyslexic, and I found other writing tools such as Pages and Microsoft Word very difficult to use. I also work as a digital designer, so I spent a lot of time instead of writing trying to make the page look pretty \u2013 this was probably a coping mechanic lol. I\u2019ve been using iA Writer for about two years now, and personally, I find it much easier to write. Markdown forces me to focus on my writing, making the process a lot easier for me. I\u2019m no longer worried about fonts, layouts, sizing, etc. I also love the syntax highlighting tool \u2013 it really helps me focus with my dyslexia; as sentences become colourful, each word becomes easier to distinguish. I feel a whole lot more confident writing nowadays now that I have iA writer. I have both the iOS and Mac versions. As both versions work together, I find myself confidently writing on my iPhone / iPad, knowing that I will pick it up once I\u2019m back on my Mac \u2013 it\u2019s great!\u201d \u2013Rizwaan Akhtar, Digital Designer, United Kingdom\n\u201cI write academic papers, translations, book chapters, and the like using iAW. Before switching, I wrote much less frequently and in lesser quantities than I do now. The beauty and clarity of the tool imparts a measure of beauty and clarity to my prose. The medium is the message, as Marshall McLuhan said. I think his insight proves true in my particular case insofar as iAW speeds up my thought, declutters my awareness, and draws my attention. The tool itself reminds me of my favorite book on writing: Strunk and White\u2019s _Elements of Style_, particularly Strunk\u2019s rule Omit needless words. By omitting all that is not needed in a writing tool, the tool itself becomes as concise and elegant as the prose that it is meant to capture. Now, even in the midst of academic administrative duties, I find it possible to write at least two serious original conference papers a year, and this year I have already managed to double that productivity. iA Writer is easily one of my most important and beloved tools.\u201d \u2013Andrew Hayes, Division Dean, Associate Professor, Texas\n\u201cBefore I found iA Writer I used to write much less and the tools I used to write on my computer were confusing and frustrating. These days, I use iA Writer for absolutely everything: from drafting a short email, making to-do lists, to outlining a major article or book chapter. I can\u2019t begin to describe the pleasure I get from an evening writing session, laptop sitting on my uncluttered desk, iA Writer on full-screen + dark appearance + focus sentence mode. The blue cursor blinking at the centre of my screen triggers a deep desire to put words down, follow a train of thought, elaborate on an idea\u2026 I have been trying to significantly cut down on my screen-time, but I can\u2019t imagine my life without iA Writer; it is an integral part of my workflow as a writer (I\u2019m a professor, so I have to write papers and prepare lectures constantly). iA Writer is the perfect tool to draft a text. It is a pleasure to use, like a perfectly sharp knife. I wrote my entire PhD thesis on iA Writer. It felt like discovering a magical sword on the third-act of a hero\u2019s journey. Thank you for all your work through the years. iA Writer has changed my relationship with writing; I feel the same connection to this software that old-time writers used to feel with their typewriters.\u201d \u2013Jo\u00e3o Ferreira, Assistant Professor (Design), Portugal\n\u201cDiscovering iA Writer and Markdown changed my life! It was so clear and simple yet super efficient. I often have problems concentrating for a long period of time and get massive headaches. I found myself writing faster using iA because I\u2019m not bothered by formatting or exporting. I just have to write my stuff and I know it will be fine. I love the minimalist style which is kind with my eyes and focus mode, like a typewriter, reminds me of when I was playing with my grandfather\u2019s. This year I left a job I didn\u2019t like to become a full time freelance writer and you played a great role in this. You help me to stay focused and efficient without distraction. It\u2019s precious nowadays. Because of this, I have more time to spend with my family. My sister lives in Switzerland and my writing best friend in Japan. It makes me smile to see iA is like us.\u201d \u2013C\u00e9cile Biaudet, Writer, SEO, France\n\u201cAstonishingly simple. Everything goes away except for the writing experience.\u201d \u2013 Stephen Fry describing his iA Writer experience in 2010 when asked about his favorite apps on the iPad"
