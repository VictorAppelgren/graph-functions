      "title": "North Chicago tightening reins on gaming licenses, after city makes changes in its code",
      "summary": "North Chicago is tightening its video‑gaming regulations as it prepares to remediate the 41‑acre Sheridan Crossing site, aiming to shift the area’s economic focus from gambling to mixed residential and commercial development. The city will no longer issue new gaming licenses to businesses whose primary revenue comes from gaming or to certain venues such as liquor stores and gas stations, while existing licenses can be retained only by the original owners. The mayor expects the loss of gaming income to be offset by increased property‑tax revenue from future development, and the council will still need to approve any new license on a case‑by‑case basis.",
