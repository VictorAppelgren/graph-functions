Kennedy Jr.\u2019s past vaccine comments, following Friday\u2019s shooting at the agency\u2019s headquarters in Atlanta that left one police officer dead.\n\nAlthough the motive of the suspected shooter \u2014 Patrick White, 30, from Kennesaw \u2014 remains unknown, he told a neighbor that he believed the Covid vaccines had made him sick, a source told NBC News on the condition of anonymity.\n\nKennedy is expected to visit CDC\u2019s headquarters later Monday to speak with staff, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe shooting took place near the campuses of both the CDC, which includes an on campus daycare, and Emory University.\n\nFor some employees, the shooting highlighted growing hostility toward public health officials, which they feel has been shaped by Kennedy\u2019s long history of spreading vaccine misinformation, including the Covid vaccine.\n\nIn 2021, Kennedy filed a citizens\u2019 petition requesting that the Food and Drug Administration revoke the authorization of the Covid vaccines. The same year, he described the Covid shot as the \u201cdeadliest vaccine ever made.\u201d\n\nJust last week, Kennedy terminated 22 contracts focused on developing mRNA vaccines \u2014 the same technology used to develop Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s Covid shots. In an announcement on X, Kennedy claimed \u201cmRNA technology poses more risks than benefits for these respiratory viruses.\u201d\n\nIn an emailed statement, Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, said Kennedy \u201dhas unequivocally condemned the horrific attack and remains fully committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of CDC employees.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a time to stand in solidarity with our public health workforce,\u201d Nixon said, \u201cnot a moment for the media to exploit a tragedy for political gain.\u201d\n\nKennedy has not yet spoken publicly about vaccine misinformation that may have contributed to the shooting.\n\nNumerous studies have shown that the Covid vaccines are safe and effective.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of misinformation, a lot of really dangerous rhetoric that\u2019s currently being spread by the current administration, that makes us seem like villains, that makes us seem like our work is setting out to hurt people,\u201d CDC employee Elizabeth Soda said in an interview. \u201cSo it\u2019s not at all surprising, right, that people are going to listen to our leaders.\u201d\n\nLikewise, in employee group chats, staffers are also voicing frustration.\n\n\u201cPeople feel like this is a natural progression when you spend years denigrating science and public health, spread misinformation about vaccines and publicly attack federal workers,\u201d said one CDC employees who was granted anonymity for fear of repercussions.\n\n\u201cFolks, myself included, are pissed off,\u201d the source added.\n\nAn employee at the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, said it\u2019s not lost on them that Kennedy \u201chas demonized our work.\u201d\n\nIn an email obtained by NBC News, Kennedy told CDC staff on Saturday that he was praying for the entire agency, adding that the shooting was \u201cdeeply unsettling,\u201d especially for those working in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cWe want everyone to know, you\u2019re not alone,\u201d Kennedy wrote.",

      "text": "A gunman opened fire in Atlanta on Friday afternoon near the campuses of both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Emory University, killing a police officer who was responding to calls of an active shooter, officials said.\nThe DeKalb County Police Department identified the slain officer Friday as David Rose, 33.\nOfficers found the suspect with gunshot wounds on the second floor of a building that houses a CVS Pharmacy. He died of his injuries, officials said.\nAuthorities have not disclosed a motive in the incident.\nHere's what we know about the shooting.\nHow did the the shooting unfold?\nAtlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said 911 calls about an active shooter came in around 4:50 p.m. for 1600 Clifton Road, in front of the CDC campus.\nAround that same time, nearby Emory University sent out an alert that there was an active shooter situation on campus. Both Emory and the CDC\u2019s Roybal Campus were locked down.\nWhen officers responded to the scene, Schierbaum said, they found Rose critically injured. He was taken to Emory University Hospital, where he died of his injuries.\nSchierbaum said officers heard gunfire inside a CVS at a retail and apartment complex at the intersection, and went inside the building to try to locate the shooter.\nThe suspect was found on the second floor. Schierbaum said he had been hit by gunfire, but that officers are not sure if the wounds were self-inflicted or whether he was shot by police.\nThe Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which is leading the probe, identified the suspect Saturday as Patrick Joseph White, 30, of Kennesaw, Georgia.\nNo civilians were injured in the shooting, Dickens said. A representative for CVS said no one at the store was hurt.\nFour other people took themselves to the hospital, where they were treated for stress and anxiety symptoms, Schierbaum said.\nWho was the slain officer?\nRose joined the DeKalb County Police Department in September, starting at its police academy, and graduated in March, officials said.\nBefore joining the department, he served in the U.S. Marines, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said in a statement.\nHe was married and father to two daughters with a son on the way, Dickens said.\n\u201cWe grieve alongside his family. My heart goes out to the entire DeKalb county government and police department.\u201d Dickens said. \u201cOfficer Rose\u2019s passing is a stark reminder that every day, law enforcement officers put themselves in harm\u2019s way to protect others, and this dedication deserves our respect and gratitude.\u201d\nCDC building struck\nCDC Director Susan Monarez said four of the campus\u2019 buildings were hit during the shooting.\nMonarez said Friday that she was \u201cheartbroken by today\u2019s attack.\u201d\nIn a letter to employees on Saturday, Monarez said that \u201cMonday will be a remote workday for all employees in order for us to conduct a security assessment before returning to the office.\u201d\n\u201cLaw enforcement is still assessing damage to CDC buildings, but it is a relief to report that no CDC employees or visitors were harmed, and we are grateful for the swift response of CDC Security and local law enforcement,\u201d she said.\nWas the CDC targeted?\nAsked if it was believed that the shooter targeted the CDC, Dickens said Friday the investigation is in the preliminary stages and that he could not say more about a possible motive.\nHe referred to the suspect as \u201ca known person that may have some interests in certain things, that I can\u2019t reiterate right know with any confidence until the investigation is fully conducted.\u201d\nA neighbor of the suspect, who said she knew him very well and requested anonymity, told NBC News that White had expressed anti-vaccine sentiments to her on multiple occasions. She said he told her he believed the Covid vaccine had made him ill.\nIn response to the shooting, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he was \"deeply saddened\" and that he stands with Rose's family.\n\"We know how shaken our public health colleagues feel today. No one should face violence while working to protect the health of others,\" Kennedy wrote on X. He said his staff is \"actively supporting\" CDC staff members across the agency.\n\"We honor their service. We stand with them. And we remain united in our mission to protect and improve the health of every American,\" Kennedy said.\nFired But Fighting, a group that describes itself as \"a coalition of fired HHS employees and allies,\" rejected Kennedy's statement of support and called for his immediate resignation.\n\"Kennedy is directly responsible for the villainization of CDC\u2019s workforce through his continuous lies about science and vaccine safety, which have fueled a climate of hostility and mistrust,\" the group wrote on a statement on its website.\nKennedy has long held anti-vaccine beliefs that came to a head with his denouncement of the Covid-19 vaccines.\nUnder Kennedy, the CDC has laid off nearly 2,000 employees. President Donald Trump has proposed cutting the agency\u2019s budget in half next year, moving some CDC functions into a new Administration for a Healthy America.\nWhat have officials said?\nGov. Brian Kemp denounced the shooting, the second in the state in one week.\n\u201cTwice this week, deranged criminals have targeted innocent Georgians,\u201d Kemp said on X, referring to a shooting at the Army post Fort Stewart two days earlier. He also thanked first responders.\nIn a separate post, Kemp said his family is mourning Rose whose \"service and memory will not be forgotten by a grateful state.\"\nU.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., offered prayers and said he was \"devastated that our community is facing yet another tragedy of gun violence.\"\nFBI Director Kash Patel said the agency would offer full support to Georgia officials in the wake of the shooting.\n\u201cPray for the family, friends, and colleagues of this hero who acted quickly to defend others and made the ultimate sacrifice,\u201d Patel said on X.\nDickens said that violence like the kind that erupted Friday, shows there needs to be a national conversation about gun violence.\n\u201cMass shootings, active shooter scenarios should not become the norm,\u201d Dickens said.\nSecond shooting in Georgia in one week\nFriday\u2019s shooting comes two days after an active-duty solider wounded five service members at Fort Stewart before a group of witnesses subdued him, officials said.\nQuornelius Radford, 28, an automated logistics sergeant, is believed to have opened fire Wednesday with a personal handgun before he was taken into custody, said Brig. Gen. John Lubas, commanding general of the 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Stewart Hunter Army Airfield.\nThe victims were not publicly identified but were said to be Radford\u2019s co-workers at the base, which is 40 miles southwest of Savannah.\nThree of the five who were injured have been released from the hospital, which Lubas said Thursday was \u201camazing considering the circumstances and the ranges of which they were engaged.\u201d\nThe two who remain hospitalized are expected to recover, Lubas said.\nLubas said it was not clear what prompted the shooting.\nRadford was the subject of bullying over his stutter almost as soon as he joined the military, former co-workers said."

      "text": "The Trump administration is terminating 22 contracts focused on developing mRNA vaccines and winding down additional federal investments in mRNA technology, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Tuesday.\nMany scientists and infectious disease experts swiftly denounced the move as a broadside on an area of research seen as particularly promising after its use in rapidly developing Covid vaccines.\nThe projects that are being axed were funded by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a Department of Health and Human Services program that works with the pharmaceutical industry to develop vaccines and other countermeasures for public health emergencies.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about vaccines,\u201d Rick Bright, who directed BARDA from 2016 to 2020, said in a text message. \u201cIt\u2019s about whether we\u2019ll be ready when the next crisis hits. Cutting mRNA development now puts every American at greater risk.\u201d\n\u201cThe Covid pandemic showed us what\u2019s possible when science moves fast,\u201d he added. \u201cDismantling that momentum now is like disbanding the fire department because the fire\u2019s out.\u201d\nKennedy said Tuesday that the terminated contracts were worth nearly $500 million.\n\"After reviewing the science and consulting top experts at NIH and FDA, HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits for these respiratory viruses,\" Kennedy said in a video announcement on X.\n\"Let me be absolutely clear, HHS supports safe, effective vaccines for every American who wants them,\" he added. \"That's why we're moving beyond the limitations of mRNA for respiratory viruses and investing in better solutions.\"\nHHS said in its initial press release on Tuesday that BARDA was terminating an award to the University of Texas Medical Branch and the biotechnology company Moderna to develop an mRNA-based vaccine for H5N1, the strain of bird flu that has infected dozens of people in the United States. But a Moderna spokesperson said on Wednesday the contract was canceled in May. HHS has since amended its press release to say that it is \u201crestructuring\u201d collaborations that affect Moderna\u2019s research on nucleic acid-based vaccines.\nAnother company affected by the cuts, Tiba Biotech, said it was directed on Tuesday to stop all work on a therapeutic for H1N1 influenza, more commonly known as swine flu. The company said in a statement that it was disappointed and surprised by the decision, since the therapeutic relies on a technology other than mRNA.\n\u201cThis comes as a surprise given the Department\u2019s stated goal of winding down mRNA vaccine development,\u201d Jasdave Chahal, Tiba Biotech's chief science officer, said in a statement. \u201cOur project does not involve the development of an mRNA product and is a therapeutic rather than a vaccine.\u201d\nThe move adds to mounting evidence that Kennedy, a high-profile figure in the anti-vaccine movement who softened his rhetoric after the presidential election and in confirmation hearings, is pursuing an aggressive anti-vaccine agenda that includes gutting a crucial vaccine advisory committee and cutting $2 billion from a program that supports vaccines for vulnerable children.\nKennedy has referred to Covid shots as the \u201cdeadliest vaccine ever made,\u201d a claim contradicted by reams of studies that have found them to be safe. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the vaccines saved more than 200,000 lives in the United States and prevented more than 1.5 million hospitalizations in the first 10 months they were available.\nMany pharmaceutical companies have prioritized mRNA research because the platform can easily be updated to target new viruses or variants, and scientists see it as an important tool to prepare for future pandemics.\nBut mRNA technology has become a primary target for anti-vaccine activists who have argued \u2014 despite ongoing and sizable research \u2014 that it represents a massive safety threat.\nChildren\u2019s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group founded by Kennedy, applauded defunding mRNA vaccine projects under BARDA on Tuesday.\n\"While we believe that the mRNA shots on the market are unsafe and should be off the market, this is a welcome step in the right direction. The pandemic preparedness industry as it exists today is a threat to human welfare,\" CEO Mary Holland said in a statement on X.\nIn his announcement Tuesday, Kennedy suggested that mRNA vaccines fail to sufficiently protect against Covid and flu, that they can be rendered ineffective by a single mutation and that they can even prolong pandemics.\nBut infectious disease and vaccine experts said he grossly mischaracterizes the science.\n\"That's exactly why mRNA is so valuable: It's the only platform where you can actually update the vaccine really quickly,\" said Dr. Jake Scott, an infectious disease specialist at Stanford Medicine.\nTerminating mRNA contracts under BARDA is \"a very misguided, irresponsible and I would say reckless move,\" Scott said. \"It really does reveal a fundamental misunderstanding of how vaccines work and how a vaccine against a respiratory virus in particular should be expected to work.\"\nKennedy said Tuesday that the BARDA funding would be shifted \u201ctoward safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate,\" such as whole-virus vaccines, which use weakened or deactivated versions of viruses to trigger immune responses.\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said whole-virus vaccines have been around since the late 1800s, noting that \u201cwe make safer, better vaccines\u201d today due to technological advances.\nThe slashing of mRNA contracts is \u201cyet another policy decision engineered by our Secretary of Health and Human Services that is not science-based,\u201d Offit said. \u201cThat\u2019s a dangerous thing to do.\u201d"
