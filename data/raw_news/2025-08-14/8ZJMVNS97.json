  "title": "'Terror Instead Of Trust': Petition Calls For Removal Of 3 Orland D135 Leaders",
  "description": "The petition was started early this week. It calls for the removal of John Bryk, Suzanne Owens and Dave Snyder.",
  "content": "The online petition\u2014titled \"Restore Integrity in Orland School District 135\"\u2014points to \"unsettling actions\" by Superintendent Dr. John Bryk, Associate Superintendent Dave Snyder and Director of HR Suzanne Owens as the cause of the district's issues. As controversy surrounds the district and its board of education over the hiring of one administrator and the ousting of two others, concerned parents seek community support intended to push the board to action on \"the power three\" of Bryk, Snyder and Owens.\n\n\"These individuals have, through their positions, instilled a sense of terror instead of trust, which has severely affected the morale of our educators and the quality of education provided by our schools,\" the petition reads. \"Their leadership has been fraught with decisions that have methodically dismantled the district's once-respected reputation and forced many talented educators to leave, leaving our children at a disadvantage.\" The petition was created this week, as the board attempts to right a ship rocked by controversy over the hiring of Century Junior High Assistant Principal Tremaine Harris. Community members, staff and alumni on July 28 accused the board of negligence in Harris' hiring, with allegations of poor vetting, lack of experience and oversight of content some found offensive on Harris' social media.\n\nHarris was hired in July, and though the public called for his job offer to be rescinded at a July 28 special meeting, Harris remains in place and was introduced via the district's social media Wednesday, alongside new Principal Jeana Naujokas. Following the July 28 meeting, some indicated that Harris' hiring\u2014and the outrage around it\u2014is indicative of more deep-rooted leadership issues within the district. Parents said that their upset was compounded by the shock around position changes of beloved former Century administrators Dr. Brian Horn and Dr. Heather Conrad.\n\nBoth were shifted out of their principal and assistant principal roles, respectively, at the end of the school year and with no public explanation, one parent told Patch. Horn had served as principal at Century since 2012, according to his LinkedIn, and Conrad became assistant principal in 2019. In May, board members approved Horn's resignation as principal at Century effective June 30, and his assignment as a language arts teacher at Jerling Junior High effective Aug. 18.\n\nRead more comments from Monday night's meeting here. Retired teacher Kevin Pajeau said the community is calling for action. Pajeau worked within the district for 40 years, and is concerned the board's move to become more involved with hiring might be misguided. \"That\u2019s not the job of a board member,\" Pajeau said. \"A board member\u2019s job is to oversee the district, and right now the community\u2019s speaking, and the board\u2019s not hearing it.\" Commenters at two meetings on Monday spoke of a purportedly toxic culture within the district, an issue rooted in its leadership, Pajeau said. \"It\u2019s continuous, it\u2019s not just me,\" he said. \"I have ex-students reaching out to me, parents of ex-students. Former administrators. Enough\u2019s enough. The morale in that district\u2019s not good.\"\n\n\"I\u2019ve known that our culture had changed drastically,\" she said, \"and in a short period of time.\" Turmoil over the administration is not new in District 135. Bryk first served as the district's assistant superintendent for human resources and operations from 2015-2019, before being appointed interim superintendent in 2019, following former Superintendent DJ Skogsberg's resignation. Skogsberg left amid a sex discrimination and retaliation lawsuit filed by Conrad. Specifically, she accused former Superintendent DJ Skogsberg of failing to promote her because she declined his sexual advances. Skogsberg resigned in June 2019. In July 2019, Conrad settled the suit and was named an assistant principal at Century. Bryk's was hired permanently for superintendent role in 2020. The board of education in 2024 approved an extension to his contract, keeping him in place through the end of the 2027-2028 school year.\n\n\"Superintendent Bryk has prioritized clear and consistent communication with all stakeholders through various parent educational sessions addressing topics such as vaping, internet safety, and social-emotional learning,\" the district wrote in an announcement at the time. \"The launch of a new website, communication platform, and new mediums of news dissemination with the District Digest and the Podcast illustrate John\u2019s commitment to keeping all stakeholders informed throughout the school year. \"... Taking the helm of Orland School District 135 in July 2019 during a challenging period, Superintendent John Bryk has led the District to significant achievements. This contract extension ensures his continued leadership, propelling Orland School District 135 towards even greater success.\" Ripoli said Bryk's actions have negatively impacted the district. \"I do not understand how our board has reissued another contract for John Bryk,\" Ripoli said. \"Are they not investigating? I know it\u2019s a new board, but I just don\u2019t understand how they haven\u2019t investigated. I do believe our new board got their eyes opened this past meeting. My eyes and my heart\u2014I was just so emotional when I walked out of there at the impact at enough people had the courage to speak up.\" Dozens of speakers took to the podium in the back-to-back meetings Monday, with longtime teacher Diane Forystek lamenting the removal of Horn and Conrad and saying Bryk, Owens and Snyder were responsible for vetting their replacements \u2014 which she feels was not adequately done.\n\nRipoli on Thursday said she's concerned about the impact on students. \"The biggest concern is, there is a trickle-down effect to our students,\" she said. \"... Century having the best principal and ass\u2019t principal combination, and that team of 2, they held our concerns, our worries, they supported us and believed in us. Even when we made mistakes, they would stand by us. \"That\u2019s not how it works at the district office. I know they\u2019re business-oriented people. I do not feel that they put the students as their top priority, as our teachers and administrators in our buildings will. It\u2019s our responsibility as teachers to put the kids as number one. I don\u2019t know how you let go of two incredibly efficient and aware principals.\" Pajeau, whose father sat on the board and whose mother served as a paraprofessional within the district, said the board needs to correct course. \"Things need to change,\" Pajeau said, also nothing that Snyder implemented standards-based grading, \"which staff and parents didn\u2019t want.\"\n\n\"... what they did to Horn and Conrad was wrong,\" he added. \"The parents liked them, the staff liked them. And they were overqualified.\" The petition calls for \"a change that aligns with the values of respect, transparency, and cooperation,\" going on to say: \"Our demand is clear: remove John Bryk, Dave Snyder and Suzanne Owens from their positions and restore the leadership of District 135 to individuals who genuinely understand and respect the community's needs.\" 'We\u2019re not getting the cream of the crop anymore' Ripoli said that while she understands the call for removing the three, she worries about the stability of the district, should that step be taken. \"I just feel very concerned for the school district,\" she said. \"We\u2019d better have a plan in place for who\u2019s going to step in. ... It\u2019s not my place to tell the board what to do.",

Hearing about the numerous and foolish decisions that were made by the current leadership has made me very disheartened. The district has a strong legacy built on the back of its residents that is being squandered.\nHiring Tremaine Harris was 1. a mistake because no one looked into his background, social media posts, resume and experience 2. Hired in spite of his lack of qualifications , questionable background, social media posts and shaky resume. Both options are bad, but admit the mistake and find someone qualified that the community supports. ...\nPetition updates\nShare this petition\nPetition created on August 13, 2025"

The district had denied the allegations. The issue arose in 2016 after Skogsberg was named superintendent. According to Conrad, she mentioned to him that she was looking to become a principal in the district. At the time, Conrad had been serving as an assistant principal.\nIn her suit, Conrad claimed that after that, on several occasions, Skogsberg told her they \"need to go out\" or \"get together,\" \"I love you\" and \"I'll take care of you,\" the Daily Southtown reported.\nMonths later, Skogsberg told her she was being relieved of her position and was given the choice to resign, to be fired, or to resign and be demoted to a teaching position. She was not given a reason, she said at the time.\nSkogsberg surprised parents in March by abruptly taking a leave of absence. He resigned in April. His last day was effective June 30. John Bryk, an assistant superintendent, is serving in his place. A search is underway for a permanent superintendent.\nAccording to the settlement agreement, Conrad will earn a salary of $99,941 and all other benefits that assistant principals in the district receive. She also will paid $98,500, of which $48,500 is earmarked for lost wages, medical bills and other damages associated with the discrimination Conrad said she endured in her lawsuit.

      "text": "Schools\nControversy Over New Hire Prompts Demands For Orland District Officials To Resign, Reinstate Former Staffers\nWhile a social media post by the new hire inflamed some parents, others blasted the removal of previous school leaders within District 135.\nORLAND PARK, IL \u2014 Hundreds of impassioned parents and community members filed into Meadow Ridge School in Orland Park Monday night, prepared to demand answers and action from the Orland District 135 Board of Education.\nThe standing room-only crowd at the board's special meeting called into question the recent hiring of Tremaine Harris, 26, as an assistant principal at Century Junior High, citing what they called poor vetting, lack of experience\u2014and at least one offensive social media post by Harris.\nThe post\u2014which has since been removed and his social media presence scrubbed\u2014depicted Harris wearing women's clothing, with a caption including slang referring to a woman's genitals. \"It should cost a billion to look this [expletive].\" The image and caption\u2014the latter of which alluded to a lyric from singer Beyonc\u00e9\u2014sparked concern about Harris' ability to lead students.\nFind out what's happening in Orland Parkfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nTwo weeks after the board approved hiring Harris, parents, residents, alumni and community members called for the board to rescind the offer. Harris, they say, falls short of the five years of experience required for the job, and was hired at $90,000 per year. Harris graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2021, and previously taught math at Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Academy, a CPS school on the city's South Side.\nSuperintendent John Bryk and the board fielded comments for 40 minutes before going into closed session for five hours. They returned only to adjourn, with no further comment or action taken.\nFind out what's happening in Orland Parkfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nMany say, though, that Harris' hiring\u2014and the uproar around it\u2014is indicative of more deep-rooted issues within the district.\n'Where is the accountability?': Longtime principal, assistant principal removed\nWhile frustration over Harris' hiring is fresh and has become widespread via social media, many parents say that it's compounded by the stewing shock of the position changes of beloved former Century administrators Dr. Brian Horn and Dr. Heather Conrad. Both were shifted out of their principal and assistant principal roles, respectively, at the end of the school year and with no public explanation, one parent told Patch. Horn had served as principal at Century since 2012, according to his LinkedIn, and Conrad became assistant principal in 2019.\nIn a personnel report from the board's May 6 meeting, members approved Horn's resignation as principal at Century effective June 30, and assignment as a language arts teacher at Jerling Junior High effective Aug. 18.\nIn meeting minutes from a special board meeting on March 25, board members approved a resolution for non-renewal of Conrad's administrator contract, and her reclassification as a teacher within the district. She'll teach at Orland Junior High this year.\nSome have since called for the resignations of Bryk, Associate Superintendent Dave Snyder and HR Director Suzanne Owens.\nHarris' hiring stoked parents' underlying concerns surrounding Horn and Conrad, as well as district leadership. District 135 alum Yasser Samad opened public comment by imploring the board to reconsider its decision to hire Harris, also stressing his disappointment regarding Horn and Conrad.\n\"This district didn't just educate me,\" Samad said. \"It shaped me. It gave me mentors. It gave me opportunity. And most importantly, it gave me a voice, the voice I'm using here tonight.\n\"Recently, this district removed Dr. Horn and Dr. Conrad, leaders with nearly two decades of experience and dedication to Century Junior High, without public explanation or transparency. These weren't just administrators, however. They were mentors. They were educators. They were champions for our children. They invested their careers into our community. And now, they've been replaced by someone with no formal administrative experience.\n\"... Where is the accountability? Simply, where is the fairness? This isn't about attacking the new appointee. It's about the process. It's about the principle. We're talking about equity and transparency that make life-altering leadership decisions behind closed doors. That sends a chilling message to students and staff alike that loyalty doesn't matter, that decades of service can be erased overnight, that even the best leaders are disposable.\"\nJeana Naujokas is now listed as the principal of Century on the school's website. No other information about her is provided there. The board approved her hiring at a salary of $137,500 at its May 12 meeting. Her LinkedIn details that she worked at Oak Lawn Community High School for 14 years, beginning as an assistant principal, rising to principal for eight years, and eventually assistant superintendent. Prior to her time there, she worked for Lincoln-Way District 210 for three years as an assistant principal. She also holds a doctorate in educational leadership and administration.\n'We're demanding you reconsider'\nAlso airing his concerns about Harris' hiring was Dean Morrell, a longtime community member and veteran representing the American Legion. He stated that the organization might nullify its awards program for Orland District 135 students, should the decision stand.\n\"The administration of these awards with this hire is definitely in doubt and will be reconsidered,\" Morrell said. \"We cannot basically go against our culture, values, Americanism and citizenship. The way this situation was handled, the way this individual was brought into our district\u2014it is beyond the realm of reality to me, with all the talent in District 135, that a suitable candidate meeting the requirements could not be hired. That this individual was brought in shows a great disrespect for current members of the school district who work within it.\n\"... If this individual was not properly vetted, that is sheer negligence. If he was vetted, and still hired nonetheless, that is clearly a case of dereliction of duty and gross malfeasance.\"\nParent Jody Benson reminded the board of their responsibility to be transparent with the people who elected them.\n\"I am a parent, a taxpayer, a local business owner, and most importantly, I am a registered voter,\" Benson said. \"And on behalf of the other registered voters in the room, I can safely say that your time here in your positions, is very limited.\n\"... One of the comments was that we are asking you to reconsider your decision. That's not exactly accurate. We're demanding you reconsider your decision.\"\nBenson then called for Horn and Conrad to be reinstated, with a formal apology and backpay. Applause echoed off the gymnasium walls.\n'It goes beyond the hiring'\nConfounded and compelled by the hiring along with other issues, a parent\u2014who wishes to remain anonymous\u2014last week sent a letter to members of the school board. She shared that letter with Patch.\n\"The Superintendent has failed to uphold the standards our community expects and deserves,\" the letter reads. \"This failure has not only impacted our school, making us a laughingstock, but has also placed an undue burden on you as board members. I know many of you care deeply about our students, educators, and families, and I believe you have the strength and integrity to do what is right.\n\"I respectfully urge you to take decisive action: remove the Superintendent immediately and reinstate Dr. Horn. His leadership, dedication, and proven track record have earned the trust of our community, and his return would be a powerful step toward restoring stability and confidence in our district.\"\nThe woman said she is one of many in a \"mob of angry parents\" incensed by the departures of Conrad and Horn from their leadership roles. A retired longtime teacher at Century said the two were well-liked and respected by the school community. Both Horn and Conrad also hold doctorate degrees.\n\"What\u2019s going on in the district is dysfunctional,\" said the teacher, who taught at the school for 28 years and spoke with Patch on the condition of anonymity. \"It goes beyond the hiring.\"\nHorn's accomplishments at the school are many, and his educational background runs deep. He serves as mentor for new principals for the Illinois Principal Association, mentor for beginning teachers for the Golden Apple Foundation, and a board member for the association of Illinois Middle Schools. He holds a doctorate, three master's degrees, bachelor's degree, certificate of advanced school leadership from Harvard School of Education, as well as teaching, principal, superintendent, and chief school business official endorsements, according to his LinkedIn.\nThe Illinois Principals Association named Horn as South Cook Region's Principal of the Year in 2019. In 2017 and 2021, he was recognized as a Golden Apple Foundation Leader of Distinction. Recipients of the award have \"demonstrated exceptional leadership and a significant positive impact on their school community. They inspire teachers, create a positive learning environment, and foster student growth and achievement.\"\nUnder his leadership, Century was the district's only junior high designated as an Apple Distinguished School\u2014a nod from the tech giant for schools that are \"centers of leadership and educational excellence that demonstrate Apple\u2019s vision for learning with technology.\"\nIt was also the district's only school to land on The National Forum's \"Schools to Watch\" list, which recognizes schools in 20 states that are \"focused on serving the social, emotional, and academic needs of each student in culturally relevant and inclusive ways.\"\nThe district's woes then, the teacher said, can be traced back to leadership's alleged treatment of Horn and Conrad.\n\"I witnessed the harassment that Horn and Conrad dealt with,\" he said. \"If we had not harassed Horn and Conrad out of a job, we wouldn\u2019t be dealing with any of this.\"\nRecent harassment, the retired teacher said, was not the first Conrad had endured. In 2017, Conrad filed a lawsuit that accused the district of sex discrimination and retaliation. Specifically, she accused former Superintendent DJ Skogsberg of failing to promote her because she declined his sexual advances. Skogsberg resigned in June 2019. In July 2019, Conrad settled the suit and was named an assistant principal at Century.\nWhile the uproar over Harris' hiring is making headlines, the district's issues run deeper, the teacher told Patch.\n\"I don\u2019t even care if they hire this kid,\" he said, \"but it\u2019s the track record of messes that this administration is making. ... There needs to be repercussion for lack of leadership.\"\n'This is about our kids'\nSpeakers on Monday roiled with allegations of negligence by the board in Harris' hiring, the apparent boiling point among parents and community members.\n\"While the head-scratching decisions go back several years, the current level of distrust held by community members along with staff is at an all-time high,\" said Matt MacKanin. \"... we tell kids all the time, 'if you see something, say something.'

      "text": "Schools\nD135 Board Distances Itself From Hiring Process As Controversy Over New Administrator Continues\nThe District 135 board responded to the community's calls for comment, says hiring is the responsibility of the superintendent, his staff.\nORLAND PARK, IL \u2014 Days after a standing-room only crowd demanded answers, transparency and action at an Orland District 135 Board of Education special meeting, the board on Friday has released a statement to the community.\nIn it, the board contends it is not responsible for the vetting and management of personnel. Those duties, they say, fall to the superintendent and \"paid professionals under his supervision.\"\n\"As a school board, we are committed to transparency, equity, and accountability to the Orland Park 135 community.\nWe understand that personnel decisions can spark strong opinions.\nHowever, we cannot ethically discuss or debate individual employment matters in open session.\nWe also wish to clarify that the Board of Education does not participate in the day-to-day hiring activities for individual positions. Responsibility for assessing candidates for hire and managing issues with personnel lies with the Superintendent, and the paid professionals under his supervision.\nThank you for your continued involvement in our schools and for supporting a district where every child and every employee can thrive.\"\nPatch also contacted Superintendent John Bryk directly for a statement, but he has not issued one.\nFind out what's happening in Orland Parkfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\n<< READ ALSO: Controversy Over New Hire Prompts Demands For Orland District Officials To Resign, Reinstate Former Staffers >>\nHundreds of impassioned parents and community members filed into Meadow Ridge School in Orland Park Monday night, prepared to confront the board regarding a recent assistant principal hiring. They questioned the hiring of Tremaine Harris, 26, as assistant principal for Century Junior High, citing what they called poor vetting, lack of experience\u2014and at least one offensive social media post by Harris.\nFind out what's happening in Orland Parkfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nThe post\u2014which has since been removed and his social media presence scrubbed\u2014depicted Harris wearing women's clothing, with a caption including slang referring to a woman's genitals. \"It should cost a billion to look this [expletive].\" The image and caption\u2014which alluded to a lyric from singer Beyonc\u00e9\u2014sparked concern about Harris' ability to lead students.\nTwo weeks after the board approved hiring Harris, parents, residents, alumni and community members called for the board to rescind the offer. Harris, they say, falls short of the five years of experience required for the job, and was hired at $90,000 per year. Harris graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2021, and previously taught math at Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Academy, a school on Chicago's South Side.\nMany since, though, have said that the uproar around Harris' hiring is indicative of more deep-rooted issues within the district. Namely, parents say, the removal of beloved administrators Dr. Brian Horn and Dr. Heather Conrad from their positions of principal and vice principal, respectively, also at Century Junior High.\nBoth were shifted out of their roles at the end of the school year with no public explanation, one parent told Patch. Horn had served as principal at Century since 2012, according to his LinkedIn, and Conrad became assistant principal in 2019.\nIn a personnel report from the board's May 6 meeting, members approved Horn's resignation as principal at Century effective June 30, and assignment as a language arts teacher at Jerling Junior High, effective Aug. 18.\nIn meeting minutes from a special board meeting on March 25, board members approved a resolution for non-renewal of Conrad's administrator contract, and her reclassification as a teacher within the district. She'll teach at Orland Junior High this year.\nSome have since called for the resignations of Bryk, Associate Superintendent Dave Snyder and HR Director Suzanne Owens.\nJeana Naujokas is now listed as the principal of Century on the school's website. No other information about her is provided there. The board approved her hiring at a salary of $137,500 at its May 12 meeting. Her LinkedIn details that she worked at Oak Lawn Community High School for 14 years, beginning as an assistant principal, rising to principal for eight years, and eventually assistant superintendent. Prior to her time there, she worked for Lincoln-Way District 210 for three years as an assistant principal. She also holds a doctorate in educational leadership and administration.\nNo action regarding Harris was taken at the July 28 meeting. After 40 minutes of open session, followed by a five-hour closed session, the board returned only to adjourn.\nThe next scheduled board of education meeting is set for 7 p.m. Monday, Aug. 11, at Center School, 9407 W 151st St.\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.

The unanimous vote by the school board reflects John\u2019s strong leadership and the significant progress the district has made under his direction.\nBoard of Education President Linda Peckham-Dodge discussed the contract extension, \u201cThe Board is thrilled to have John leading Orland 135 for the next four years. He has provided the stability and leadership we needed; we look forward to that continuing.\u201d\nSuperintendent Bryk\u2019s leadership team has resulted in several enhancements to the District\u2019s educational programs. These include implementing a new math curriculum, equipping all self-contained and early childhood classrooms with interactive learning boards, and creating the \u201cCome Fly With Us\u201d transitional program to support 8th graders, just to name a few. Technology and the District\u2019s teaching approach with new interactive tools have also continued evolving. Two additional technology coaches were added to the District to assist staff and students with incorporating technology into classroom instruction.\nA positive school culture and climate have been fostered through new initiatives like the Ghouls Night Out, Back to School Bash, Pop-In for Popsicles, Good News Postcards, expanded after-school clubs for Kindergarten through 5th grade, the Stars Program, and other student-centered events after school and during breaks.\nSuperintendent Bryk has prioritized clear and consistent communication with all stakeholders through various parent educational sessions addressing topics such as vaping, internet safety, and social-emotional learning. The launch of a new website, communication platform, and new mediums of news dissemination with the District Digest and the Podcast illustrate John\u2019s commitment to keeping all stakeholders informed throughout the school year.\nThe facilities and financial aspects of the District have also improved under Bryk\u2019s leadership. Five buildings are currently undergoing construction to expand learning spaces, aligning with the District\u2019s 10-year master plan. Additionally, OSD135 has achieved the Health/Life Safety Certificate of Excellence for five years in a row. During Bryk\u2019s tenure, the District improved its financial position and has achieved a 4.0 rating during recent audits.\nTaking the helm of Orland School District 135 in July 2019 during a challenging period, Superintendent John Bryk has led the District to significant achievements. This contract extension ensures his continued leadership, propelling Orland School District 135 towards even greater success."

How did we get here? I\u2019m sorry to hear there are members of this district who feel unloved, unsupported and fearful. \u2026 One can assume if the culture of this district is unhealthy, it will lead to a loss of trust and respect, and ultimately negatively impact student performance. Our mission states we are stronger together, and I believe that to be true. It\u2019s time to break down the walls of \u2018we\u2019ve always done it this way.\u2019 As a result of massive feedback, I think we need to start having healthy, open conversations as to how we can improve. Let\u2019s think outside the box and be as transparent as we are allowed to be. \u2026 I recognize people are hurt, I do not want to ignore this....\"\nBoard member Ray Morandi agreed with Thanos.\n\"I know we fall on contentious times, but man, I feel like we have a community filled with passion,\" Morandi said. \"A community that deeply cares about their children. I think we have teachers that love what they do, and I think there's a love for this district, as well.\n\"Unfortunately, I believe the consensus lately is that people show up and nothing ever gets done, like their voices aren\u2019t being heard. I know we sit here with straight faces, but I can assure you that all of your voices are being heard. And that\u2019s a consensus I think you\u2019ll see change in.\u201d\n'A community filled with passion'\nFollowing the July 28 meeting, some speakers indicated that Harris' hiring\u2014and the outrage around it\u2014is indicative of more deep-rooted leadership issues within the district. Some parents noted that their upset was compounded by the shock around position changes of beloved former Century administrators Dr. Brian Horn and Dr. Heather Conrad.\nBoth were shifted out of their principal and assistant principal roles, respectively, at the end of the school year and with no public explanation, one parent told Patch. Horn had served as principal at Century since 2012, according to his LinkedIn, and Conrad became assistant principal in 2019.\nSome have since called for the resignations or removals of Bryk, Associate Superintendent Dave Snyder and HR Director Suzanne Owens. A parent group this week started a petition to stir up community support for the removals.\nThe public has demanded more accountability from the board moving forward.\n\"We do hear you,\" said Board President Nichole Browner on Monday, \"and we all have a lot of feelings here, and they don\u2019t fall on deaf ears.\"\nParents call for transparency\nPrior to the board's discussion, commenters took to the podium to air concerns about leadership changes, workplace culture and alleged procedural deficiencies.\n\"Two eminently qualified administrators have been dismissed,\" said Diane Forystek, a longtime teacher at Century Junior High, until her retirement in 2022. \"It appears no one took the time to properly vet those who replaced them.\"\nThat vetting, Forystek said, is the responsibility of Bryk, Owens and Snyder.\n\"The hiring of administrators and staff isn\u2019t just about filling positions. It\u2019s about shaping the educational environment of District 135. It's about our community. What should be considered. Qualifications, experience, pedagogical approach, values, ethics and district\u2019s cultures. Most importantly, our children,\" she said.\n\"As an educator, I am left to wonder: if they could not take the time to vet administrators who would have daily contact with the children of 135\u2014who will lead our children and shape our district\u2014if this task was not worth their time, what is?\"\nAt the board's second meeting that night, Century parent Kim Domagala also pressed the members for deeper transparency in the hiring process, pointing to perceived distrust in the HR department. She also applauded the board for its efforts at conversation \"about important things,\" during the meeting.\n\"... What we want is a very clear-cut, decent hiring process,\" Domagala said. \"What we want is teacher retention. We want our teachers\u2014our most important asset\u2014to feel confident in our administration.\n\"I am not hearing that. I have not heard that all spring and summer. We want them to feel supported by our school board. I'm starting to feel some school board support, and for that I am grateful. I do not think this is too much to ask. ... All the negativity I\u2019ve heard since my son started kindergarten has been this year, 2025, and that hurts. I hope the board please do something to make the necessary changes.\"\nWorking toward 'rebuilding that trust'\nDiscussing the board's role in the hiring process at the committee of the whole meeting, the board weighed the ways in which it might be involved moving forward.\n\"I personally, I probably don't have the requirements to hire a principal or a vice principal,\" Morandi said. \"I don't know that I got voted on (to the board) to hire a principal or a vice principal. But I do think we have to have people in place that can make those decisions, and we feel confident in those decisions.\n\"... As it stands, we have to look at what comes in, what the qualifications are, and unfortunately be a little more involved than we should be, as things stand. As it stands, I do think there\u2019s got to be more involvement.\"\nOne idea proposed would involve rotating board members to review finalists for leadership positions, or sitting in on final interviews. Most seemed in agreement they'd be most comfortable participating in the process for administrative hires only.\n\"Start there, see how it goes,\" Browner said.\nThanos said she thought it might not be a permanent change.\n\"I\u2019m hoping that this is temporary,\" she said. \"I think the number one goal here is to try to rebuild that trust. Once we get that going, people can try to fall off of this. ... We can just do it temporarily.\"\nBrowner said she envisioned it as a longer-term move.\n\"I would probably argue, that the board switches every two years,\" she said. \"And like you said, trust [rebuilding]\u2014people may take two weeks, people might take two years. ... In some districts, it\u2019s totally normal for a board to be part of it [the hiring process] ... I think if we're going to do it, we should really stick with it....\"\nBoard member Alan Kastengren agreed.\n\"I think this is probably a long-term shift in how we do things,\" he said.\n\"... It's definitely fluid ... This will be learning for me, too, but I\u2019m willing to sit there ... put the effort in,\" Browner said, \"I\u2019m willing to volunteer and put the time in. ... I think this should be something that we do, and then teach new board members as they get elected, how to do it.... So everybody\u2019s transparent and informed.\u201d\nThe board stopped short of finalizing any official update to its policies.\n\"I do want to give it a run and a go before we give it ink,\" Browner said. \"Wait at least two months of actually being involved in doing it. Start this process, and then if we feel it\u2019s something we want future boards to do, keep it going, I think we should definitely have an open conversation, make some policy around that to let future boards know, to set a precedent.\"\nKastengen worried that with potential time between administrative hires, the board might lose sight of its discussion.\n\"The risk is that administrative hires, it could be several months before we\u2019re doing that again,\" he said. \"... We may forget this conversation...\"\n\"I don't think we're ever going to be able to forget,\" Browner interjected.\nIllinois Association School Board principles outline that while an individual board approves all contracts, hiring responsibilities typically fall on the superintendent.\n\"Although the board is legally required to approve all employment contracts, the board delegates authority to the superintendent to select and evaluate all district staff within the standards established in written board policy,\" the principles read.\nBoard involvement in hiring\nSpeaking with Patch after the meeting, Browner said the board had previously discussed how its role in hiring could be adapted. Kastengren, specifically, was passionate about examining possibilities for change.\nBrowner said it wouldn't be completely unusual for the board to play a part.\n\"Once a candidate made it through to the end and was considered a finalist, you do often see other districts having board members, in some capacity, weighing in before that person is presented to the board for a vote,\" Browner said.\nInitial discussions pre-dated the April 1 election, Browner said, with the board opting to revisit it once new members were seated.\n\"It's a revisited discussion,\" Browner said. \"It seems like the board has a consensus to have more involvement in that process. What that looks like, has yet to be confirmed.\"\nThe board, Browner said, has typically received a personnel report prior to the vote, and has access to a database to review a hire's information.\n\"That's dependent on a board member doing their due diligence,\" Browner said. \"We aren\u2019t rubber-stamping, but at the same time, we do feel a need expressed prior to this recent community uproar, that we want to be more involved.\"\nBrowner was happy to see board members speak to the community and each other throughout the meetings.\n\"I feel like it was a wonderful conversation,\" she said. \"Everybody finally felt comfortable to offer their insight and their questions to have that healthy discussion. \u2026 The community appreciated that openness.\n\"We\u2019re definitely not qualified to go through resum\u00e9s and all that. But to have all that information presented to us in a closed session prior to a vote, I\u2019m really supportive of. And I would think that the community would be very supportive of that, as well.\n\"We do need to stay in our lane, but we also need to be informed voters, to be able to cast our vote.\"\n'What is it about that job?'\nIn other discussion, Kastengren broached the district's lack of promotion from within for the assistant principal role. Since 2020, he said, the district has hired 16 assistant principals\u2014only four have been internal hires.\n\"We don\u2019t have a very good strategy to make sure we have teachers ready to step up,\" he said. \"Other problem: lack of retention for assistant principals. The assistant principal with the longest tenure right now was hired in 2022.\n\".. Our APs are great, they just don\u2019t stick around long enough. And it wasn't always this way. ... We need to figure out, why don't our assistant principals want to stay in the district? We're having trouble getting our own staff leaders to want to take that role, we're having trouble having assistant principals want to stay longterm. We need to figure out why that is\u2014what is it about that job, that people don\u2019t want it?\"\n\"... We\u2019ve heard a lot about the culture here in 135,\" said board member Kelly Chmielewski, \"and I suspect that the culture is related to the staff not wanting to move up.\"\n'People in power have covered their tracks well'\nRetired District 135 teacher Jackie Ripoli shared her insight into the district's culture.\n\"I have no political interest and nothing to gain\u2014I can\u2019t sit quiet anymore,\" Ripoli said. \"It was an honor when I was hired in 1991. It was a time of all sides of education. We were a machine\u2014we worked together for the community, and for the children.\n\"In 2016, something changed,\" she said. \"The leadership came in with hidden agendas. In 2019, that was a difficult year\u2014the district office became more of a business only. ... Staff voices were consistently shut down. It's personally humbling experience to discussed and assumed dishonest before proven otherwise. Parents have complained to the district office, which results in a one-sided professional conduct investigations without a district employee being asked for an explanation or request for video ... There\u2019s a silent anxiety throughout this district. Don\u2019t make waves. Keep your head down Stay on good sides.\"\nRipoli also pointed to Bryk, Snyder and Owens at the center of the district's issues, alluding to Conrad and Horn as targeted by the three.\n\"Bryk, Owens and Snyder are well-versed in the medialities of contracts and timing,\" she said. \"I am confident that these people in power have covered their tracks well and will be difficult to investigate without having to pay them off. They have been very good at finding ways to make experienced, impressively dedicated teachers and building staff look suspect. They're unified in ways to recover funds by harassing hardworking, caring certified and noncertified staff into early exits to save the district money. They've used their power and insinuations to create a constant feeling of job insecurity, and good reptuations have suffered. It saddened me the way Dr. Horn and Dr. Conrad have been treated with disregard and such disrespect.\n\"I\u2019m not angry, I\u2019m not a whiner. I do not want our district to decline. The people who believe in education and what's best for the children deserve the respect they've earned. We're in a business of educating children in a caring environment, not tearing down an institution deserved to serve them. We need some changes, it needs to be safer here for all of us.\"\nPublic comments to be kept in\nIn response to the community's call for transparency, the board discussed the possibility of public comments being kept in live-stream recordings once meetings have ended. With 40 minutes of public comments from the July 28 meeting later removed, and minimal board action before and after a five-hour closed session, video from that meeting is only four minutes long.\nCommunity members have criticized the recordings being redacted to remove the public comment portions. Board members debated giving commenters the chance to opt out of being recorded, their comments to remain in perpetuity.\n\"... I would ask that we ask the person who's speaking if they feel comfortable with (their comments being recorded,\" Browner said. \"... I wouldn't want to decide for someone, I would want them to decide for themselves. ... I would want them to have that choice.\"\nChmielewski said members of the community should have the freedom to opt out of being recorded, but reminded the board of its promise for transparency to constituents.\n\"I feel that removing citizens' remarks from our videos is not transparent,\" she said. \"Citizens' remarks are part of the meeting and should remain in the video. I think it takes a lot of courage to get up and speak before a packed auditorium, and in a way it feels like we're trying to erase the comments and erase the concerns.\"\nBoard member Linda Peckham-Dodge said the board initially began stripping out public comment after employees spoke of being maligned publicly during a meeting, followed by private apologies afterward.\n\"How do we protect them?\" Peckham-Dodge questioned. \"... as far as protecting our staff, that's where I have a concern. Because you can get up and say anything. ... That's why we did what we did. So, that's the piece I'd like to try to figure out\u2014how we can protect people when something like that happens.\"\nThere are some people, Browner said, who come to speak and \"want their voice to be heard forever.\"\nBoard newcomer Aisha Zayyad echoed Browner's thoughts.\n\"I think it's a good idea to give people the option, and let people know in advance that if they are making a comment about another individual\u2014whether it's a student or staff member\u2014that that would be removed from the recording, because we have to ensure the safety of our staff and students,\" Zayyad said.\nBrowner noted the board would have to explore the legalities around editing someone's recorded comments.\n\"Legally, we\u2019re just normal people, we\u2019re going to see if policy needs to be updated,\" Browner told Patch Tuesday. \"We need to make sure we\u2019re following the law. Respect the wishes of our community members.\"\nThanos stressed reminding speakers about maintaining decorum.\n\"I would add that everyone speaking should be respectful,\" Thanos said. \"I believe there's an outline of what's appropriate, and what's not appropriate.

  "argos_summary": "An online petition titled \"Restore Integrity in Orland School District 135\" has emerged, calling for the removal of Superintendent Dr. John Bryk, Associate Superintendent Dave Snyder, and HR Director Suzanne Owens due to alleged mismanagement and a toxic culture within the district.
