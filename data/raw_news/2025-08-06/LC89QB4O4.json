      "text": "From disruptors and disruptive tech to pandemics, political unrest, and climate change, winning the future depends on adaptation. To survive and thrive, leaders should determine how to maintain a competitive advantage and enable an ability to win in a way that doesn\u2019t just withstand change but embraces it to generate new strategic possibilities.\nAn adaptive business in the 21st century is typically a digitally powered business, leading many organizations to pursue digital transformation. But why do so many transformations fail to deliver concrete impact? Why is it so hard to drive cross-functional change, plan beyond one technology at a time, or create a strategy that can adapt as technology evolves and organizations shift their core assumptions? Creating a common, strategically linked language for digital transformation could be the answer to achieving digital advantage and adaptability.\nWhile 85% of CEOs accelerated digital initiatives during the pandemic,1 most can\u2019t articulate their overall strategy and progress beyond that they made a tech investment. The imperative for change is increasingly the creation of an adaptable business\u2014one that can thrive in the digital economy. If CEOs can\u2019t say their digital transformation resulted in new business advantages or adaptability, then they haven\u2019t really transformed. This dichotomy between business and technology strategy underscores a broader phenomenon: Many leaders understand that technology shouldn\u2019t drive business strategy. Yet all too often, that understanding is superseded by an impulse to ask, \u201cWhat should our AI strategy be?\u201d or to respond to events by making a series of tech-first, one-off investments. The urge to think in discrete technologies can be powerful.\nCompounding this challenge is the fact that C-suite executives have different focus areas and goals. And, more than likely, a single technology won\u2019t address their needs; rather, a complex combination of solutions may be needed. Further, they often don\u2019t speak to each other when making tech decisions, or if they do, they struggle to effectively communicate. Digital transformation is a team sport and should use a playbook to coordinate strategies across leadership functions with consistency in the face of change.\nWhile many organizations have a digital strategy, they lack a common language to strategize across functions, making it challenging to digitally transform and address related opportunities and risks. Indeed, a common language for digital transformation can enable C-suite executives beyond just the CTO or CIO2 to have tech-adjacent and tech-agnostic conversations that transcend any individual technology and go to the heart of their processes and culture, and how people work and interact.\nBy embracing a common language, organizations can begin to:\nIn fact, Deloitte's soon-to-publish research on the exponential enterprise has found that on average, a company with above-median scores on both the ability to win and capacity for change indices enjoys measurable rewards. These firms saw a price-to-earnings ratio that's 53% larger and share price volatility that's 21% less than industry rivals with below-median scores on both dimensions based on data from 2015\u20132020.\nThe language of digital transformation should have one foot on the business side and one foot grounded in downstream technology and operations, steering clear of technical terminology to ensure that all parties can understand and contribute to the conversation. Leaders across industries recognize the need to connect the two spheres in an approachable, universal way. As Tighe Wall, chief digital officer at Contact Energy, explains: \u201cIf you want to get closer to and become more vital to the business and its strategy, you need to speak the same language as the business. Every company will become more technologically and digitally focused in the coming years. The ones who will be successful are the people who have already bridged that gap and are already speaking the same language in the business as they are in technology.\u201d\nWe\u2019ve identified five business outcomes that technology impacts and enables that can help to build that common language. By thinking thematically across these five digital imperatives\u2014experience, insights, platforms, connectivity, and integrity\u2014organizations can communicate across functions in a way that puts strategy before technology and can lead to initiatives that deliver a more modular, flexible technology core that better delivers transformation and strategic value. These business-techno concepts can act as guardrails to help leaders avoid the trap of falling into a technology-led conversation. They can also help frame digital strategies that are linked to technical realities and workforce implications. In essence, they create a bridge for coordinated discussions between business and technology strategists and workforce and operations leaders.\nDrilling down into more detail:\n1. Experiences: Focus on optimizing interactions with users, whether they be customers, the workforce, or other stakeholders within the ecosystem\n2. Insights: Assess what data, analysis, operating model, and workforce are required to enable organizational strategies\n3. Platforms: Focus on the location and management of information across an organization or its network3\n4. Connectivity: Involves the flow of information between platforms, experiences, and insights, encompassing the future of the internet, and networking with other organizations and ecosystems\n5. Integrity: Focuses on improving resilience, security, ethical tech, and trust across all internal and external facing business systems and processes with a cyber-minded culture to address continuously evolving threats\nThere will be more than one technology to consider for each imperative. Thinking about the imperatives as categories, or \u201ccapability stacks,\u201d can be useful. Themes allow change categories to become fixed as technology changes. This way, leaders can consider today\u2019s enabling and disruptive technologies (that is, cloud, IoT, blockchain, AI, cybersecurity, mobile, 5G, digital reality, edge computing, quantum, and others), while leaving the same strategy in place for future disruptive and horizon-next technologies to meet the same strategic objectives (figure 1).\nOrganizations can use these imperatives as a vocabulary to build a digital strategyaligned to the organization\u2019s strategic north star (figure 2).\nStart by considering how that overarching ambition cascades across business, technology, and workforce considerations:\nLet\u2019s look at an example to explain what we mean: Creating a smart factory strategy. First, assess the enterprise objective for the smart factory, for example, to manufacture small batches or to personalize items at reduced cost versus current mass manufacturing approaches. Second, build the digital business strategy by considering how each of the five imperatives aligns to these manufacturing goals in terms of the insights needed, the platforms and connectivity required and, finally, how to do so with integrity. Then, broadly consider your technology requirements aligned to the digital business strategy down the list of digital imperatives. Instead of starting with cloud as an assumed investment, discuss a range of technologies (that may or may not include cloud), and the implications of those technologies on the workforce and operations. The result could be better strategic alignment across the digital business strategy, technology investment strategy, and organizational or workforce transformation agenda.\nWhile our proposed framework may be new, the challenging practice of adopting an integrated, cross-functional approach to digital transformation is not. But achieving such an integrated approach is vital. When we analyzed data from 2,860 global business and public-sector leaders responding to Deloitte\u2019s 2021 Digital Transformation Executive Survey,4 we saw that the technologies listed in our survey that align with these imperatives were rated as the top five most important to enable digital transformation. Additionally, we saw that the more digital imperatives these organizations adopted, the greater their digital maturity and profitability.5 Further, more digitally integrated organizations measurably outperformed on their strategic objectives, capacity to change, and ability to win.6\nTo effectively gauge the value organizations can gain from increased adoption of the digital imperatives, we broke respondents into two groups:7 \u201cdigital all-rounders,\u201d who have implemented three or more digital imperatives (~13% of respondents), and \u201cdigitally developing,\u201d who have implemented fewer than three digital imperatives (~87% of respondents). While ~67% have embraced at least one digital imperative, when organizations combined them in an integrated digital strategy, they saw greater value.\nDigital all-rounders lead digitally developing organizations in terms of:\nWhether they realize it or not, many organizations are already taking this integrated approach. We interviewed four global leaders responsible for their organizations\u2019 digital transformation, each in different business and technical functions, industries, and geographies, and found that they were already approaching transformation in this way\u2014but without a clear language and framing to guide them. From these conversations, we learned that this framework can effectively guide organizations with three digital transformation objectives: Optimize one digital imperative across business, technology, workforce; integrate multiple imperatives to build a more comprehensive single strategy; or adopt a combined approach that integrates multiple imperatives across these strategies (figure 3).\nPrudential, for example, focused on optimizing the insights imperative across business, technology, and workforce and operational strategies. When designing its algorithm to automate underwriting, they engaged underwriters to gain greater adoption and value from the transformation. Robert Huntsman, chief data scientist for Prudential Financial\u2019s Life Insurance and Retirement business, explained, \u201cThe way they work is changing, so, knowing that, underwriters have been involved from day one in helping to write the requirements, to craft how the model works as well as in changing their own processes for how they would interact with the model. Now, for 60% of applications, you can get an expedited decision \u2026 reducing the amount of time an underwriter needs to spend on evaluating an application. That\u2019s a huge cost saving for the company which enables us to be more price competitive and provide our customers the services they need faster.\u201d\nAlternatively, the framework can help organizations to consider building a more integrated business strategy that includes platform, insights, experience, connectivity,and integrity. Manoj Raghunandanan, president of Global Self Care and the Consumer Experience Organization (CxO) at Johnson & Johnson Consumer Health, articulated a digital transformation business strategy touching on all five of the imperatives: A platform approach to improve end-to-end data connectivity across customer insights and experience in a way that considered data integrity. He explained, \u201cwe're focusing on connecting our organization from end-to-end to create an improved and more transparent experience for our consumers, customers and our suppliers [of] ingredients. This requires connecting all the data from the very beginning of research & development, through the supply chain, to our retail customers, and through to the consumer.\nBritish American Tobacco and Contact Energy looked at a combination of several of the digital imperatives aligned across business, technology, and operations/workforce strategies. Elaine Chum, area head of digital transformation, British American Tobacco, North Asia, explained how she is leading her organization\u2019s online retail platform strategy in Japan to create a direct-to-customer buying experience within the regulatory integrity requirements to drive increased sales revenue. She explains, \u201cIn today\u2019s world, I should be able to deliver within 24 hours. We started looking at consumer experience and restrictions,\u201d and with those three imperatives in mind, advised, \u201cPut the consumer experience in the front, middle and back of your company\u2019s agenda. Look at the strategy element, the internal business processes and how it can enable transformation, the technology and its platforms that we own and operate in, the capabilities that we have, talent, people, resources, [and] the organization structure\u201d notably emphasizing the unique challenges of operating in a region that values stability over change and finding Japanese-speaking digital talent.\nAdditionally, Wall of New Zealand\u2019s Contact Energy is extending the digital platform his organization initially created to optimize customer experience to reduce friction for its customer service representatives, enhancing workforce operations. Having a comprehensive, matrixed strategy in place can allow for this type of flexible, synergistic decision-making that keeps the overall organizational ambition in mind.\nOur digital imperatives can enable organizations to drive transformations that align to their overarching ambition while remaining open to future strategy changes. They acknowledge the importance of AI, cloud, and cybersecurity today but leave room to evolve toward \u201chorizon next\u201d8 technologies, avoiding the trap of leaping at every shiny new technology. Ultimately, they help design-adaptive business processes and technology architectures (modular \u201ccapability stacks\u201d) that embrace constant change and reconfiguration in the face of ongoing disruption and risk with the goal of compatibility for multiple possible futures. As Raghunandanan states, \u201cWe\u2019re not done. We\u2019re not going to be done. We\u2019re only done at the speed of technology being done and, if you look at it, it\u2019s changing every single day.\u201d\nThe framework we\u2019re proposing can help organizations take the following key actions:"
