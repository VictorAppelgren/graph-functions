  "description": "President Trump has accused the president's autopen of being \"the biggest political scandal in American history.\" But what is it, and when can it be used?",
  "content": "Shock, who served as director of presidential letters and messages in Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, had the authority to wield the president\u2019s autopen, the mechanical device that rendered identical copies of Clinton\u2019s signature.\n\nSay a piece of correspondence \u2014 a letter to a state official, or a birthday card for a not-so-close political ally \u2014 needed the president\u2019s John Hancock, Shock explains. A letter would get typed up on Clinton\u2019s azure blue White House stationery. Then Shock, or occasionally an intern (\u201cObviously a trusted intern\u201d) would walk the letter over to what was then called the Old Executive Office Building, where the president\u2019s staff secretary kept guard over the autopen machine.\n\nThe contraption, roughly the size of a drafting table, had its own room. Shock would choose from one of three Clinton signatures, taking care to vary which signature was used for repeat presidential letter-getters. A staffer would position the letter, then fire up the machine. \u201cYou had to press both of your knees on the lever, almost like a spinning wheel,\u201d Shock says. A mechanical arm appeared, holding Clinton\u2019s preferred autograph utensil: a Sharpie.\n\nB-i-l-l-C-l-i-n-t-o-n \u2014 dot the i, dot the other i, cross the t.\n\nDuring the George H.W. Bush presidency, Jim Cicconi, a deputy chief of staff, was in charge of the autopen \u2014 the only person in the West Wing with permission to use it \u201cfor all matters,\u201d according to a 1989 memo. \u201cEverything had to go through me,\u201d Cicconi says. Bush mainly used the device to sign personalized correspondence, like birthday greetings and Christmas cards. Yes to books Bush wrote or biographies about him; no to magazine covers. And the 41st president always wanted to sign commissions, legislation and executive orders himself.\n\nMuch of Cicconi\u2019s responsibility was in the maintenance. The pens \u2014 hand, auto, or otherwise \u2014 can\u2019t be ordinary; the National Archives insists the ink be of archival quality so they don\u2019t fade. Matrices \u2014 grooved pieces of plexiglass that controlled the pen\u2019s movements \u2014 were closely monitored for wear and tear; a shaky signature was the sign that one needed to be replaced.\n\nWhat did it feel like, to have pen power?\n\nCicconi: \u201cIf you made a mistake, there was a real sense you\u2019d get in trouble.\u201d\n\nShock: \u201cIt seems like it would have been a lark. The reality is it was a lot of pressure.\u201d The pen, after all, \u201ccould write checks or declare war,\u201d he added.\n\nYou might have heard of the autopen recently.\n\n\u201cWith the exception of the RIGGED PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2020, THE AUTOPEN IS THE BIGGEST POLITICAL SCANDAL IN AMERICAN HISTORY!!!\u201d President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social in June.\n\nSeveral inanimate objects have drawn Donald Trump\u2019s ire over the years: showerheads (\u201cYou know I have this gorgeous head of hair \u2014 when I take a shower, I want water to pour down on me\u201d), paper straws (\u201cThese things don\u2019t work\u201d), LED lights (\u201cThe light\u2019s no good \u2014 I always look orange\u201d). But perhaps no artifact has attracted his ire like the autopen. Specifically, Joe Biden\u2019s autopen.\n\nIt has been a Trump bugbear since March, when an arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation issued a report, \u201cThe Autopen Presidency,\u201d suggesting Biden relied extensively on an autopen for his presidential proclamations. Those proclamations included preemptive pardons for people whom Trump and his allies had cast as villains, such as Anthony S. Fauci and the members of the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol (which concluded, in its final report, that Trump \u201cpurposely disseminated false allegations of fraud related to the 2020 Presidential election to aid his effort to overturn the election and for purposes of soliciting contributions\u201d).\n\nTrump has since floated the idea that those pardons should be nullified, suggesting that Biden \u201cdidn\u2019t know anything about them.\u201d Biden, meanwhile, has forcefully pushed back on any insinuation that he cluelessly had allowed his staff to wield an autopen on his behalf. When asked for comment, a Biden spokesperson shared the former president\u2019s statement from June: \u201cI made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn\u2019t is ridiculous and false.\u201d\n\nThe White House Counsel\u2019s office has just begun reviewing tens of thousands of emails about clemency decisions Biden signed via autopen in the final weeks of his administration. Senate Republicans have promised to launch an investigation, and House Republicans already have; Rep. James Comer (R-Kentucky), the House Oversight Committee chair, subpoenaed senior officials of Biden\u2019s administration to ask about who authorized the use of the autopen. Comer signed those subpoena notices with a digital signature, NBC News reported, a common practice among federal lawmakers, who also often have autopens.\n\nSo, all that\u2019s happening. But let\u2019s talk more about the president\u2019s autopen, because you probably have a bunch more questions about it.\n\nSuch as: Can we see it?\n\n\u201cWe used to say the autopen was second-most guarded thing in the White House, save for the president,\u201d Shock says.\n\nWhat we do know is that today\u2019s autopens are much smaller than their predecessors, closer to the size of a toaster oven. And unlike the matrices that directed the mechanical stylus of Clinton\u2019s autopen, many of today\u2019s machines scribble digitally preprogrammed signatures with their robotic arms.\n\nSo, we haven\u2019t seen the Trump autopen. We asked the White House if they\u2019d share a photo with us; none was provided, but an official confirmed that it\u2019s in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.\n\n\u201cI never use it,\u201d Trump told reporters in March.\n\n\u201cI mean, we may use it, as an example, to send some young person a letter, because it\u2019s nice.\u201d\n\nRight, so, letters are the main reason presidential administrations have depended on autopens for the past eight decades. Harry Truman is thought to be the first president to use a modern autopen. John F. Kennedy\u2019s dependence on the autopen inspired a book, \u201cThe Robot That Helped to Make a President,\u201d though his administration was loath to admit its use. (He had several different programmed signatures: \u201cJohn F. Kennedy\u201d for business, \u201cJack Kennedy\u201d for pleasure.) His successor, however, had no such qualms: Lyndon B. Johnson allowed the National Enquirer to feature his autopen for a 1968 article titled \u201cThe Robot That Sits In For the President.\u201d\n\nIt almost seems as if autopens should have nicknames. Do they?\n\nShock: \u201cIt did not, that I know of.\u201d (Unless \u201cthe pen\u201d counts.)\n\nDrat. But also, it makes sense that officials wouldn\u2019t try to personify the autopen, since it\u2019s supposed be an extension of the president.\n\nHere\u2019s a fun autopen fact: In Shock\u2019s day, if, say, the president was on Air Force One while his autopen was signing a letter in his name back at the White House, \u201cFROM ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE\u201d would be added to the heading \u2014 \u201cjust to note that he wasn\u2019t in the facility that day and no one\u2019s trying to pull anything or sign it in his absence,\u201d says the former aide. \u201cIt had to reflect where he was, even if it was getting autopenned.\u201d\n\nAnother question: Can the autopen sign bigger-ticket documents? Can a president use it to sign a bill into law?\n\nYes, according to 2005 guidance from George W. Bush\u2019s Department of Justice, which states that the commander in chief \u201cneed not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves,\u201d but could ask a \u201csubordinate\u201d to sign a bill \u201cfor example by autopen.\u201d (Barack Obama was the first president to do this, using sign legislation an autopen to extended the Patriot Act, which was set to expire while he was in France at the G8 summit in 2011. Biden used his autopen to sign legislation in 2024 to extend funds for the Federal Aviation Administration for a week as Congress finalized passage of its longer-term funding bill.)\n\nBut also \u2014 maybe he can\u2019t, according to Tom Graves, a former Republican congressman from Georgia. In 2011, Graves cautioned that Obama was setting a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d and pointed to legal opinions that cut against the Justice Department\u2019s guidance. He\u2019s been watching the current autopen fracas unfold with amusement from his lobbying firm on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny \u2014 I\u2019ve received notes, handwritten notes, from people, about my calling it to question in the very beginning and appreciation for that,\u201d says the former lawmaker. He still thinks how and when an autopen is used is \u201ca really important topic to get to the bottom and to resolve,\u201d whether through congressional or judicial action. He thinks the questions about Biden\u2019s alleged use of the autopen for proclamations (such as pardons) are worthwhile. \u201cI personally don\u2019t think there\u2019s a problem with the actual signer activating the autopen,\u201d Graves says. \u201cBut I do think there\u2019s a responsibility to read the document and sign off on the document. Assigning it to someone else \u2014 that\u2019s the questionable area here.\u201d\n\nCanadian entrepreneur Matthew Gibson has been watching the present autopen controversy with interest from his perch on Lake Erie\u2019s Pelee Island. Two decades ago, Gibson teamed up with author Margaret Atwood to design the LongPen, a product that allowed the author to virtually attend book signings and remotely render her signature in real time. It captures a \u201cbiometric\u201d signature, with all of the pressure and cadence of real-time penmanship, imparting a humanity the autopen lacks.\n\n\u201cWith the autopen, there\u2019s a disconnect between intention and action,\u201d Gibson says. \u201cUsing this would dispel any dialogue that\u2019s happening right now \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t be a discussion.\u201d (He says he\u2019s written to a few U.S. lawmakers about his product, though he won\u2019t say to whom.)\n\nThe people least impressed by autopens may be the collectors. \u201cThey have little to no value,\u201d says Sandra Palomino, the director of historical manuscripts at Heritage Auctions, of autopenned signatures, adding that they aren\u2019t typically auctioned off as stand-alone items.\n\nBut there is one autopen-like device historians consider valuable. On the third floor of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, up the escalator from Clara Barton\u2019s Red Cross wagon and down the hall from Grover Cleveland\u2019s inauguration overcoat, sits Thomas Jefferson\u2019s polygraph \u2014 a sort of proto-autopen. It\u2019s a polished wooden box, roughly the size and shape of a backgammon board, with a pair of arachnid-like mechanical arms, each attached to a pen nib.\n\nJefferson used it to make copies of his writings; as he wrote with one pen, the mechanical arm would render an exact copy on a second sheet of paper. It is a deeply unsexy artifact in a display case full of them, tucked in a corner beside Bill Clinton\u2019s 2001 presidential budget and a washing machine patent signed by Andrew Jackson. No tourists pause to look at as they rush toward Abraham Lincoln\u2019s top hat.\n\nBut its significance was not lost on Jefferson \u2014 who, in a letter penned during his own presidency, called the contraption the \u201cfinest invention of the present age.\u201d",

      "text": "President Trump claimed that former president Joe Biden\u2019s pardons for members of the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attacks are \u201cvoid\u201d and \u201cvacant,\u201d because they were signed using an autopen, a device that reproduces signatures.\nIn one of his final acts as president, Biden granted preemptive pardons to members of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. Biden said the move was intended to protect the House committee members from potential retaliation under a second Trump administration.\n\u201cThe \u2018Pardons\u2019 that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social late Sunday night.\nAdvertisement\nWhile a president has Constitutional authority to issue pardons, there is no power for the subsequent president to undo them for any reason.\nA 2005 memo from the Justice Department, issued during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency, said that using an autopen to sign official documents is legal, and the practice is now widely used. President Obama was the first to sign a bill using an autopen in 2011.\nIn his social media post, Trump claimed that members of the House committee are \u201csubject to investigation at the highest level\u201d and falsely accused them of arranging their own pardons without Biden\u2019s knowledge.\nCalifornia Senator Adam Schiff, who served on the committee, said in a post on X on Monday that he and members of the committee won\u2019t be intimidated by Trump\u2019s threats regarding Biden\u2019s pardons.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe members of the Jan. 6 Committee are all proud of our work,\u201d Schiff wrote. \u201cYour threats will not intimidate us. Or silence us.\u201d\nFormer Illinois representative Adam Kinzinger, who also served on the committee, responded to Trump\u2019s comments with a gif on X saying, \u201cbring it on b\u2013\u2013.\u201d\n\u201cTrump is threatening the Jan. 6 committee again\u2026 He\u2019s obsessed. He\u2019s more obsessed with like, me and Liz Cheney than his freaking golf score. Hey, Trump, bring it on, dude,\u201d Kinzinger said in a video posted to X.\nDuring a White House press conference Monday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump simply questioned Biden\u2019s awareness of the pardons he granted.\n\u201cThe President was raising the point that, did [Biden] even know about these pardons? Was his legal signature used without his consent or knowledge?\u201d Leavitt said.\nThe president\u2019s remarks followed a post on X last week by The Oversight Project, a branch of The Heritage Foundation, a right-wing think tank, which questioned whether Biden had the \u201cmental capacity\u201d to authorize the documents.\nOn his first day in office, Trump granted pardons to nearly 1,500 people charged in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack and commuted the sentences of 14 supporters, including members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, who had been convicted of seditious conspiracy and other crimes.\nAlyssa Vega can be reached at alyssa.vega@globe.com."

      "text": "President Donald Trump claimed Monday that pardons recently issued by Joe Biden to lawmakers and staff on the congressional committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot have no force because the-then president signed them with an autopen instead of by his own hand.\n\u201cIn other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them!\u201d Trump wrote on his social media site. Trump didn\u2019t offer any evidence to support his claims. Nor did the White House.\nTrump asserted in his post, in all caps, that the pardons are void and have no effect in his estimation. But presidents have broad authority to pardon or commute the sentences of whomever they please, the Constitution doesn\u2019t specify that pardons must be in writing and autopen signatures have been used before for substantive actions by presidents.\nAdvertisement\nAsked if White House lawyers had told Trump he has the legal authority to undo pardons signed by autopen, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said \u201cthe president was raising the point that did the president even know about these pardons? Was his legal signature used without his consent or knowledge and that\u2019s not just the president or me raising those questions.\u201d\nShe went on to cite recent reporting by the New York Post that quoted two unidentified Biden White House aides who speculated about alleged abuse of the autopen during his tenure.\nPressed for evidence that Biden was unaware of the pardons, Leavitt told the press corps at the daily briefing, \u201cYou\u2019re a reporter. You should find out.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nWhat is an autopen?\nAn autopen is a mechanical device that is used to replicate a person\u2019s authentic signature. A pen or other writing implement is held by an arm of the machine, which reproduces a signature after a writing sample has been fed to it. Presidents, including Trump, have used them for decades. Autopens aren\u2019t the same as an old-fashioned ink pad and rubber stamp or the electronic signatures used on PDF documents.\nWhy is it suddenly an issue?\nThe Oversight Project at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank recently said its analysis of thousands of pages of documents bearing Biden\u2019s signature found that most were by autopen, including pardons. Conservative media have amplified the claims, which have been picked up by Trump. He has commented for several days running about Biden\u2019s autopen use.\nMike Howell, the project\u2019s executive director, said in an interview that his team is scrutinizing Biden\u2019s pardons because that power lies only with the president under the Constitution and can\u2019t be delegated to another person or a machine. Howell said some of Biden\u2019s pardon papers also specify they were signed in Washington on days when he was elsewhere.\nWhat does the law say?\nThere is no law governing a president\u2019s use of an autopen.\nA 2005 opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department said an autopen can be used to sign legislation. Barack Obama became the first president to do so in May 2011 when he signed an extension of the Patriot Act. Obama was in France on official business and, with time running out before the law expired, he authorized use of the autopen to sign it into law.\nMuch earlier guidance on pardons was sent in 1929 from the solicitor general \u2014 the attorney who argues for the United States before the Supreme Court \u2014 to the attorney general. It says \u201cneither the Constitution nor any statute prescribes the method by which executive clemency shall be exercised or evidenced.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHas Trump used an autopen?\nYes, but \u201conly for very unimportant papers,\u201d he said on Monday.\nHe told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday night that, \u201cwe may use it, as an example, to send some young person a letter because it\u2019s nice. You know, we get thousands and thousands of letters, letters of support for young people, from people that aren\u2019t feeling well, etcetera. But to sign pardons and all of the things that he signed with an autopen is disgraceful.\u201d\nWhy is he singling out the Jan. 6 pardons?\nTrump remains angry at being prosecuted by the Justice Department over his actions in inspiring his supporters to go to the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in an attempt to stop lawmakers from certifying Biden\u2019s defeat of him in the 2020 election, though the case was dismissed after he won reelection. At the end of his term, Biden issued \u201cpreemptive pardons\u201d to lawmakers and committee staff to protect them from any possible retribution from Trump.\nOn whether pardons must be in writing or by the president\u2019s own hand, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has said the \u201dplain language of the Constitution imposes no such limitation.\u201d Biden\u2019s statement accompanying those pardons make clear they were official acts, said Carl Tobias, professor at the University of Richmond law school.\nBiden issued hundreds of commutations or pardons, including to members of his family, also because he feared possible prosecution by Trump and his allies.\nTrump vigorously used such powers at the opening of his presidency, issuing one document \u2014 a proclamation \u2014 granting pardons and commutations to all 1,500-plus people charged in the insurrection at the Capitol.\nAdvertisement\nHow else do presidents use the autopen?\nPresidents also use an autopen to sign routine correspondence to constituents, like letters recognizing important life milestones.\nDuring the Gerald Ford administration, the president and first lady Betty Ford occasionally signed documents and other correspondence by hand but White House staff more often used autopen machines to reproduce their signatures on letters and photographs.\nLeavitt is one of three Trump administration officials who face a lawsuit from The Associated Press on First- and Fifth-amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America."

Biden, 82, and now undergoing treatment for prostate cancer, dismissed Trump\u2019s actions as \u201cridiculous.\u201d\nHere\u2019s a look at what Trump is alleging, what impact it could have, and why the country may never have seen anything like this before.\nWhat did Trump order?\nTrump directed his White House counsel and attorney general to begin an investigation into his own allegations that Biden aides hid from the public declining mental acuity in their boss. Trump is also casting doubts on the legitimacy of the Biden White House\u2019s use of the autopen to sign pardons and other documents.\nIt marks a significant escalation in Trump\u2019s targeting of political adversaries, and could lay the groundwork for arguments by leading Republicans in Congress and around the country that a range of Biden\u2019s actions as president were invalid.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cEssentially, whoever used the autopen was the president,\u201d Trump said Thursday.\nHe then went further, suggesting that rogue elements within the Biden administration might have effectively faked the president\u2019s signature and governed without his knowledge \u2014 especially when it came to pushing policies that appeased the Democratic Party\u2019s far-left wing.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t have much of an idea what was going on,\u201d Trump said, though he also acknowledged that he had no evidence to back up those assertions. A Trump fundraising email released a short time later carried the heading, \u201cA robot ran the country?\u201d\nAdvertisement\nLegal experts are skeptical about that the investigation will do much more than fire up Trump\u2019s core supporters.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s more of a political act than one that will have any legal effect,\u201d said Richard Pildes, a constitutional law scholar at New York University School of Law. He added: \u201cI think it\u2019s designed to continue to fuel a narrative that the administration wants to elevate, but courts are not going to second-guess these sorts of executive actions\u201d undertaken by Biden.\nWhat types of Biden actions would be covered by the investigation?\nTrump has long questioned the legitimacy of pardons his predecessor issued for his family members and other administration officials just before leaving office on Jan. 20, people whom Biden was worried could be targeted by a Trump-led Justice Department.\nBut Trump has more recently suggested Biden was unaware of immigration policies during his own administration, and said Thursday that aides to his predecessor pushed social issues like transgender rights in ways Biden might not have agreed with.\nIt is well-established that a president\u2019s executive orders can easily be repealed by a successor issuing new executive actions \u2014 something Trump has done repeatedly since retaking the White House. That lets Trump wipe out Biden administration policies without having to prove any were undertaken without Biden\u2019s knowledge \u2014 though his predecessor\u2019s pardons and judicial appointments can\u2019t be so easily erased.\n\u201cWhen it comes to completed legal acts like pardons or appointing judges,\u201d Pildes said, a later president \u201chas no power to overturn those actions.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nWhat\u2019s an autopen and how does it relate to this?\nAutopens are writing tools that allow a person\u2019s signature to be affixed automatically to documents. The Justice Department, under Democratic and Republican administrations, has recognized the use of an autopen by presidents to sign legislation and issue pardons for decades \u2014 and even Trump himself acknowledges using it.\n\u201cAutopens to me are used when thousands of letters come in from young people all over the country and you want to get them back,\u201d Trump said Thursday.\nMichigan State University law professor Brian Kalt said the \u201cconsensus view is that, as long as the president has directed the use of the autopen in that particular instance, it is valid.\u201d\n\u201cThe only issue would be if someone else directed the use of the autopen without the President\u2019s approval,\u201d Kalt, an expert on pardons, wrote in an email.\nDoesn\u2019t the Constitution give presidents the absolute right to make pardons?\nYes. Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution bestows the president with the power \u201cto grant Reprieves and Pardons.\u201d\n\u201cA president\u2019s pardons cannot be revoked. If they could, no pardon would ever be final,\u201d American University politics professor Jeffrey Crouch, author of a book on presidential pardons, said in an email. \u201cThere is no legal obstacle I am aware of to a president using an autopen on a pardon.\u201d\nKent Greenfield, a Boston College law professor, said, \u201cOnce you pardon somebody, you can\u2019t go back and un-pardon them.\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019s done with a president\u2019s authority, I don\u2019t think it matters whether it\u2019s done with an autopen or not,\u201d Greenfield added. \u201cThe president\u2019s authority is the president\u2019s authority.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s suggestions that Biden\u2019s administration effectively functioned without his knowledge on key policy matters go beyond questions about pardons and the president using the autopen. Even there, though, the Supreme Court ruled in 2024 that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution. At the time, Trump celebrated the ruling as a \u201cBIG WIN\u201d because it extended the delay in the Washington criminal case against him on charges he plotted to overturn his 2020 election loss.\nAdvertisement\nSuch immunity would likely cover Biden as a former president. It might not extend to Biden administration officials allegedly acting without his knowledge \u2014 though Trump himself acknowledged he\u2019s not seen evidence of that occurring.\nWhat does Biden have to say?\nBiden has dismissed Trump\u2019s investigation as \u201cnothing more than a mere distraction.\u201d\n\u201cLet me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn\u2019t is ridiculous and false,\u201d he said in a statement.\nHas a president ever sought an investigation like this before?\nIn a word, no.\nThere have been allegations of presidents being impaired and having their administrations controlled by intermediaries more than the public knew \u2014 including Edith Wilson, who effectively managed access to her husband, Democratic President Woodrow Wilson, after his serious stroke in 1919. Wilson\u2019s critics grumbled about a shadow presidency controlled by his wife, but the matter was never formally investigated by Congress, nor was it a major source of criticism for Wilson\u2019s Republican successor, Warren G. Harding.\nMore recently, some questioned whether President John F. Kennedy struggled more than was publicly known at the time with Addison\u2019s Disease and debilitating back pains while in office. And there were questions about whether dementia might have affected Ronald Reagan during his second term, before he was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s in 1994, five years after he left office.\nTrump himself was indicted four times, and convicted once, while Biden was in office \u2014 but those investigations were not ordered by Biden.\nAdvertisement\nAssociated Press writer Mark Sherman contributed to this report."

Recently, Donald Trump has criticized Joe Biden's use of an autopen for pardons related to the January 6 Capitol attack, claiming they are void because they were not signed personally by Biden. Legal experts assert that autopen signatures are valid as long as the president authorized their use, and there is no law prohibiting their application for pardons or legislation. The controversy has sparked investigations and debates about the legitimacy of Biden's actions while in office.",
