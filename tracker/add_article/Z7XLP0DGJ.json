The launch, effective September 3 2025, aims to cut consumer costs and lower AT&T’s customer acquisition expenses, potentially reshaping telecom pricing dynamics. This move signals a broader trend of fintech firms bundling connectivity, which could influence consumer spending patterns and pressure traditional telecom revenue streams.",
