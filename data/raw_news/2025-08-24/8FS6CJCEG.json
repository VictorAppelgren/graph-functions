  "title": "How playing two left-footed centre-backs sums up Aston Villa\u2019s problems",
  "description": "Squad balance and depth remains in question at Villa \u2013 as the struggles of Torres and Mings in defence against Brentford showed",
  "content": "Pau Torres and Tyrone Mings started together in central defence.\n\nIt had been a long time coming, given their respective injuries and the general reticence to combine two left-footed defenders until the perfect moment and within the perfect structure.\n\nThere had to be a degree of care and meticulous planning. Outwardly, the perception is that two left-footed central defenders are too awkward. They lead to breakdowns in possession and allow opponents to press easily, knowing the limitations of one defender playing on their weaker side. In other words, they can become a sitting duck.\n\nBut, after right-footed centre-back Ezri Konsa\u2019s red card against Newcastle United, this was to be the moment.\n\nAgainst Fulham in February 2024, when Aston Villa played with Torres and another left-footer in Clement Lenglet, Unai Emery intelligently adjusted the system to foil Fulham\u2019s press, including a specific goal-kick routine. But this season is different.\n\nVilla are thinner and seemingly short of impetus and evolution in their play. A lack of freshness to the squad, fundamentally caused by various financial restrictions, is an issue well-publicised but it was fiercely evident against Brentford. Internally, players and staff accept the team needs a refresh of some kind.\n\nSeven players who started on Saturday worked with Emery\u2019s predecessor, Steven Gerrard, and there were four academy players on the bench. Anti-Premier League chants continued from the away end during the first half and frustrations simmered throughout.\n\nThe 1-0 defeat was what Villa deserved and duly got. Starved of pace and, in Emery\u2019s words, \u201cintensity\u201d, the loss accentuated the obvious tactical imbalances within the side. The left-footed centre-backs exemplified this, at fault for the only goal of the game and setting the sense of awkwardness from back to front.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t creating clear chances, we\u2019re not opening up teams and players are not playing at their best,\u201d said John McGinn afterwards, typically frank. \u201cIt is very early on, we can\u2019t panic, but we need to improve, definitely.\u201d\n\nA disconnect ran throughout the side and Brentford\u2019s goal was the punishment. One simple ball upfield from goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher caused hesitation between Mings and Torres.\n\nThe former, playing on the right side, did not know his whereabouts and was caught a step behind Igor Thiago, who won the first contact. It may have only been a split second initially but it was telling.\n\nTorres, a defender who Emery admitted at the end of last season has \u201cdifficulties in defensive duels\u201d has never been the fleetest of foot and was horribly exposed, lunging in and failing to stop Dango Ouattara breaking through.\n\nIt was peculiar to watch the left-footed centre-backs operate as if they were fine and one of them playing on their weaker foot was not inhibited. In truth, it was clearly the opposite. It was also peculiar to watch Villa, without a right-winger, play as if they had a winger and do that precise job, like McGinn did.\n\nIn the aftermath, Emery stated McGinn is not a player to create \u201cindividual actions man to man\u201d, instead opening \u201cspaces for our right-back.\u201d So to do this, McGinn required a right-back to overlap outside of him.\n\nHere, however, Matty Cash\u2019s remit was clear: to stay in a back three, enabling Mings to move centrally and be more favourable for his left-footed passing.\n\nThis was an alarming performance, even if it came early in the campaign. The flaws shown against Newcastle United seven days earlier \u2014 an unevenness in width, pace and insertion \u2014 were even more striking in west London.\n\nEmery did not compensate for the absence of a traditional winger by deploying a wing-back system in possession, pushing Cash higher to provide width and rolling Boubacar Kamara into the right centre-back space. This might have solved Mings\u2019 issues and helped McGinn to be more comfortable in his remit.\n\nKamara pulled up with a hamstring issue as Brentford celebrated Ouattara\u2019s goal and in his place came Emiliano Buendia, the player Villa wanted to sell and still could be sold. Donyell Malen, a pacey wide forward whose introduction would enable McGinn to move centrally, stayed glued to the bench.\n\nAmadou Onana remained but, having been trailed as a third centre-back in pre-season to do a similar role as Kamara should Villa be without a right-footed centre-back, Emery decided to keep him slugging away in midfield.\n\nIronically, in the friendly against Marseille, Onana\u2019s incisive pass in the third centre-back position led to McGinn\u2019s goal, back when the Scotland international was central and Jacob Ramsey was still in the Midlands.\n\nBoth centre-backs were dragged into wide areas against Brentford: Mings onto his right foot and Torres where his lack of mobility would be isolated. One of several injury-enforced breaks gave Emery time to speak to the pair, yet nothing, ostensibly, changed.\n\nVilla conceded a long throw-in after Mings and Torres combined to pass and then miscontrolled the ball out of play.\n\nThe direct result was another throw hurled into their box with Emiliano Martinez attempting to claim the high ball \u2014 something Emery had gestured for earlier in the half. Martinez was knocked to the floor as the ball went into his net. A VAR intervention saved Villa from being two goals down and misery compounded.\n\nBlack Sabbath\u2019s \u2018Paranoid\u2019 echoed over the speakers as the players trudged down the tunnel at half-time, pre-empting Villa\u2019s full-time emotions. The players had looked ragged, insecure and vulnerable tactically.\n\nThe squad\u2019s balance is in question \u2014 exemplified by the awkward troubles of Villa\u2019s central defenders.",

  "summary": "Aston Villa's performance in a 1-0 defeat to Brentford was highlighted by the team's inability to play two left-footed central defenders, Pau Torres and Tyrone Mings, who started together in central defence. This comes after right-footed centre-back Ezri Konsa was sent off against Newcastle United. The team's performance was criticised for being too awkward and allowing opponents to press easily. Despite this, Unai Emery has acknowledged that the team needs a refresh and is looking to address these issues internally. The lack of freshness to the squad is largely due to financial restrictions and a lack of pace and intensity. The only goal of the game was scored by Brentford's goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher, setting up the awkwardness between Mings and Torres.",

      "text": "The defensive box between the two central defenders and deepest midfielders is the equivalent of Aston Villa\u2019s vertebrae.\nYet key absentees meant Villa\u2019s posture had begun to slump. Injuries to three central defenders called for Pau Torres, who had not started in exactly two months, to return under less-than-ideal circumstances against Fulham.\nAdvertisement\nIn a perfect world, Unai Emery would never wish to pick the back four he chose, with two left-footers in central defence considered a \u201cdo not touch\u201d option in modern football. Clement Lenglet was loaned in to be a backup to Torres, not to play alongside him.\nIt is a footballing paradox that two right-footed centre-backs are generally deemed suitable, yet the mere thought of two left-footers induces an overwhelming reluctance from managers.\nThe view is they look too awkward, leading to structural breakdowns in possession. Opposition forwards find it easier to arch their body shape a certain way when pressing \u2014 knowing the limitations of a left-footer being forced onto their weaker foot \u2014 and set traps. And to exacerbate ball progression fears, Emery was without his chief midfield anchor Boubacar Kamara, a player who would, ordinarily, drop deeper to conduct play.\nEstablishing control is the overarching idea of Emery, but Villa have regularly struggled to achieve authority away from home. The most straightforward way to gain the upper hand is through possession; it was why avoiding transitions was in sharp focus against Manchester United and here at Fulham. With a changed centre-back duo and double pivot, effective ball retention was needed more than ever before.\nYet in comparison to other first halves on the road, Villa limited Fulham to few chances and held a degree of control that was influential in the 2-1 victory. A key element to this was Emery offsetting the left-footed centre-back problem while retaining balance.\nAnd much of it had to do with Villa\u2019s goal kicks\u2026\nVilla took nine goal kicks in the first half alone, with three different players restarting play. This was a concerted ploy by Emery to jumble the opposition\u2019s press, knowing Fulham pressed man for man from goal kicks.\nBy having either Emiliano Martinez, Torres or Lenglet each take a goal kick, it meant Fulham\u2019s players could not lock to their direct opponent as quickly, with Villa varying and opening different passing lanes into midfield or out wide.\nFulham\u2019s trigger to press is often when the ball goes to the opposing full-backs. This is because they receive possession with their back against the touchline, limiting the number of passing options they have.\nTo counteract this, Emery did not just want his goalkeeper taking goal kicks. Instead, Villa were able to slide the first pass to the opposite centre-back not taking the goal kick, changing the angles in how they passed out.\nThe first goal kick came in the third minute and set the tone. It was taken by Lenglet, who played to Martinez and Fulham were late in shuffling across to Torres.\nTorres is the most composed player Villa have in possession and immediately displayed those inherent traits. He chopped inside Bobby De Cordova-Reid and switched the ball out to Matty Cash, stationed on the opposite side. Fulham did not have enough players to press the full-back.\nIn turn, Villa\u2019s rewired build-up structure took shape. In open play, Cash would tuck in to become a third centre-back, ordered by Emery to take up narrow positions and shift Lenglet centrally. This helped to compensate for the two left-footers, just as Emery outlined in pre-season when he wanted to incorporate Mings and Torres together.\n\u201cIn our structure, sometimes we are building up with three or four players, using different players but all under the same rule,\u201d explained Emery post-match. \u201cToday, Cash tried to give balance with Leon Bailey getting wide of him.\u201d\nOn occasion, Lenglet would stand on the ball, waiting for the shape to change. Here, he finds himself in an uncomfortable right centre-back position but pauses for eight seconds. This gives time for Cash to come short, receiving the ball to play forward.\nBy Cash inverting, the width from the right came from Bailey.\nCrucially, Emery knew Fulham could easily apply pressure on Villa with their press if players stayed in fixed positions. Instead, he required intelligent rotations from goal kicks, designed to drag players\u2019 direct markers \u2014 such as Joao Palhinha on Youri Tielemans \u2014 into unfamiliar areas.\nIn the example below, Martinez throws the ball for Lenglet to take. Lenglet\u2019s position was precise from every goal kick, always standing on the right corner of the six-yard box, with Torres slightly wider. This was to enable Torres, the more progressive player who was on his comfortable foot, to open expansive passing lanes and for build-up patterns to be shaped by his distribution.\nLenglet passes to Cash, who has again dropped deep to offer a short option.\nAs the ball is played, Tielemans sprints to the right, offering width outside of the full-back. Due to Fulham\u2019s man-to-man marking scheme, this drags Palhinha across the pitch, creating space inside the pitch for either the next pass or a midfield run.\nVariation from goal kicks became an underlying theme. Before Villa\u2019s third goal kick, Martinez decides to kick long. He gestures for Jacob Ramsey to drop deeper, freeing up space for a pass to go over his head and towards Ollie Watkins in the left channel.\nAn offshoot of an aggressive man-marking ploy is the susceptibility of being caught one-on-one in defence. Pertinently, Torres proved adept in whipping channel passes for the in-to-out run of Watkins, with Issa Diop the designated marker.\nThe match-up appeared unsuccessful in the first half, with Watkins needing treatment after Diop\u2019s robust challenge, but sticking to the plan culminated in Watkins\u2019 second goal having initially drawn Diop towards him.\nNote how Tielemans\u2019 head is already swivelling before he takes his first touch, anticipating where the next pass should be played. Watkins pushes off his left leg and spins behind Diop, who is square on and unable to shift his body quickly enough. Tielemans finds Watkins\u2019 run, who lashes past Bernd Leno.\nGoal kicks and a subtle change of shape were symbolic of the performance. Emery found creative solutions to overcome Villa\u2019s recent adversity."

      "text": "Eighteen months later than planned, Unai Emery admitted what most had been wondering.\n\u201cI would like to play with both players in the starting XI,\u201d the Aston Villa manager said, when asked by The Athletic if (and how) Tyrone Mings and Pau Torres could play together. \u201cThe structure we have to create with both needs time, time practising in training sessions, time maybe practising in official matches.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe logic is sound and in theory, pairing two central defenders seems straightforward. Mings and Torres are highly experienced, possessing contrasting but complementary skill sets \u2014 so what is the issue?\nIn the simplest terms: they are both left-footed.\nHighly skilled left-footed centre-backs are esoteric, owing to their capacity to open up different passing lanes and enabling coaches to counteract an opponent\u2019s press. They are crucial to build-up play, often having the most touches and passes of any player and, consequently, proving the most progressive vehicle of attack. Torres, for example, ranks in the top four per cent of defenders from Europe\u2019s top five leagues for progressive carries (1.59 per 90 minutes).\nMings is a solid passer, though not as adept as Torres. Mings has alternative strengths the Spain international cannot match. He is Villa\u2019s best in-box defender and aerial presence, relishing the more abrasive parts of the job. This should not detract from Mings\u2019s overall ability, having made impressive strides in his work with the ball.\nIntegrating Torres and Mings into an effective system requires deep thinking from Emery. Moving either to the right carried risk because the perception is that a left-footer looks too awkward and can be pressed easily, with opposition forwards forcing them to kick with their weaker foot.\nThe question of how to fit the pair together without taking away their natural attributes was at the forefront of Emery\u2019s 2023 pre-season planning. He had outlined to Mings that he would remain a key starter following Torres\u2019 arrival and design a system to incorporate both. This eased any concerns Mings was being replaced, particularly after receiving interest from another Premier League club.\nThis would all prove futile. Mings was injured 30 minutes into the opening day fixture of the 2023-24 campaign away at Newcastle United, with Torres replacing him. The England international spent 445 days recovering from a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and cartilage damage.\nGO DEEPER\nInside Tyrone Mings' 445-day road to recovery\nOnly now has Emery signalled for a return to the initial thinking. Mings has proven his form and fitness to coaching staff with a player-of-the-match performance in the 3-1 victory against Brentford and nullified any lingering doubts that he would not come back the same player. At his best, Mings significantly improves a defence that has been porous in his absence \u2014 not helped by Torres\u2019 blind spot against physical strikers \u2014 and shown a weakness in defending set plays.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI am very happy now we have both players,\u201d said Emery. \u201cMings played a fantastic match against Brentford. He had played other matches where he felt comfortable but Brentford was the match he played even better and got confidence to feel comfortable.\n\u201cPau Torres is helping us a lot in the style we have. They are different (players). Mings is a little bit stronger in everything and Pau is a little bit (stronger) in the build-up and the characteristics he has are high quality. Both can improve, like Mings in his build-up and Pau is making an effort to be stronger in duels.\u201d\nThis month, Emery dusted off his plans from the 2023 pre-season, offering indications he is prepared to change Villa\u2019s structure to select both. This would have a knock-on effect on other areas of the team \u2014 for what Villa gain by adding a defender, they lose somewhere else on the pitch. How to strike the right balance continues to be a head-scratcher for Emery.\nHow the season has developed might have accelerated Emery\u2019s idea of playing Torres and Mings. The justification for a tactical tweak has grown stronger with every passing week, partly because of form but considering the positions Villa are vulnerable in also adds weight to the case for change.\nEmery has strength in depth in central defence, while his options in wide areas \u2014 and their productivity \u2014 have been under-par. Villa have a shortage of wingers and the ones they do have, such as Leon Bailey and Jaden Philogene, are enduring difficult campaigns.\nIn turn, changing to a wing-back formation means a third central defender, providing a neat solution to the Mings/Torres conundrum.\nThe first discernible change came in the 3-2 victory away at RB Leipzig. Bailey was injured and, on paper, Matty Cash had taken his place on the right wing.\nIntriguingly, there was a noticeable shift in structure when the game began. Ezri Konsa resembled a right central defender in a back three, with Diego Carlos stationed between him and Torres, who was on the left.\nEmery would constantly instruct Cash as to his positioning throughout:\nIn a pronounced back three, Cash and Lucas Digne were high and wide on opposite flanks, serving as wing-backs in a newly comprised 3-4-2-1.\nThe adjustment in build-up patterns ambushed Leipzig and gave Villa immediate control. As is customary with all Red Bull teams, Leipzig pressed out of a narrow 4-2-2-2 shape yet could not get near Villa\u2019s players because of the width supplied by the wing-backs. This allowed regular switches of play and a perennial out-ball.\nDigne and Cash found themselves on the same line as Villa\u2019s No 10s and glued to either touchline.\nLeipzig\u2019s narrow back four was pulled from side to side, with John McGinn\u2019s goal coming from a Cash cross. The move started after the wing-back had broken out of a defensive position.\nAs soon as Villa turned the ball over, Cash sprinted forward, with his positioning comparable to a right-winger.\nThe system offered flexibility. Cash and Digne switched to traditional full-backs without the ball and moved Villa into a 5-3-2 shape.\n\u201cAfter the injury to Bailey and Philogene is still in a process, I decided to use Cash playing as a full-back defending low but attacking high and wide,\u201d said Emery in his post-match press conference. \u201cHe has the potential to do it. He played at the beginning of his career like a winger and today he worked fantastic.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nEmery\u2019s usual build-up schemes are designed to unlock the left-back in high areas. In possession, they become a quasi-winger, while the right-back tucks in to form a back three and take up a more conservative full-back position. This is demonstrated in the contrasting touchmaps for Digne (at left-back) and Cash (at right-back) this season.\nDigne is tasked with sprinting upfield when a move develops and crossing in advanced areas.\nCash, meanwhile, receives possession in deeper areas and his opportunities to go forward are more sporadic.\nVilla were impressive against Leipzig and had Mings been picked, he would have likely replaced Carlos as the middle centre-back.\nFour days later, Mings was supposed to start at Nottingham Forest in place of Torres as the left centre-back. Villa operated within the same system, but Emery was set to take a horses-for-courses approach, with Mings and Carlos physically more suited to play against Chris Wood, who was up front for Forest.\nAlthough he was named in the starting XI, Mings had been feeling unwell all day and in the warm-up, accepted a sickness bug had got the better of him. Torres was drafted in.\nThis did not perturb Villa\u2019s strategy, however, with Cash staying high. Increased width meant Villa\u2019s No 10s could start inside the pitch and between the lines, as Morgan Rogers does here:\n\u201cTime\u201d is the buzzword and response from Emery when asked about the riddle of blending two left-footed, but very different, centre-backs. Though the idea has not been put to the test under competition yet, Emery\u2019s intentions are clear \u2014 not to disturb Villa\u2019s overarching principles, only strengthen them.\n(Top photo: Torres, left, and Mings are set to play more together.

      "text": "Another tifo cascaded from the Holte End before kick-off.\nIt was Unai Emery smiling and clapping, with his players in the background. Above, the caption: \u201cNo limits to our dreams.\u201d\nThe message was meant to inspire and show that, under manager Emery, Aston Villa have immeasurably raised the bar of their expectations. Yet, at the same time, the tifo jarred.\nAdvertisement\nBelow the text and just behind Emery\u2019s head on the banner was Jacob Ramsey. The tifo had been made before the club agreed to let their homegrown lad, born six miles from Villa Park, join Saturday\u2019s opponents. Post-match, Newcastle United\u2019s manager Eddie Howe called Ramsey an \u201coutstanding player\u201d. After all, he was soon going to be theirs.\nFundamentally, Ramsey\u2019s departure is a representation of how Villa\u2019s dreams are being limited or, at the very least, curbed. The 24-year-old was an asset Villa had to sell as a result of various financial restrictions, all blessed with their own acronym.\nThis has been the summer of (financial) discontent; a subject so evident and stifling that Emery had no choice but to refer to it in his programme notes. His words, as it happened, contradicted the tifo\u2019s message.\n\u201cWe cannot avoid that the summer has been challenging because the financial rules were conditioning our investment in the squad,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFinancial control rules came to football to avoid bankruptcies and payment defaults with a good purpose.\n\u201cBut as professionals we should review it, as this good tool will become a limitation for clubs that are doing good management, who\u2019ll never be allowed to dream and get higher goals because the revenue, key for these financial rules, needs time to come to reality after sporting success.\u201d\nThe dreams Emery has fostered since his arrival in November 2022 have endured a reality check this summer. Instead of strengthening a squad that only missed out on Champions League football on goal difference, Villa\u2019s focus has centred on complying with UEFA\u2019s squad cost rules (SCR), reducing a wage bill that previously accounted for 91 per cent of overall revenue down to, at most, 70 per cent.\nVilla are a victim of their success. They are entering their third successive season of participating in European competition. UEFA rules state clubs can lose no more than \u20ac60million (\u00a351.6m; $70.1m) over that period, plus a possible \u20ac10m per year if European football\u2019s governing body deems them to be in a \u2018good\u2019 financial state.\nUEFA\u2019s \u2018football earnings rule\u2019 is a tighter version of the Premier League\u2019s profit and sustainability rules (PSR), which permits losses of up to \u00a3105m ($142m) across such a period.\nAnyone under the assumption they could forget the acronyms and financial red tape for 90 minutes for the first league fixture of the campaign would have been disappointed. A day usually soaked in optimism only served to underline those concerns.\nWith Newcastle the better side, albeit painfully short of a centre-forward, both sides played within themselves. This was not a day for players with a spring in their step or a game to welcome new faces. Marco Bizot was Villa\u2019s best player and the only summer signing to feature, due to Emiliano Martinez\u2019s one-game suspension. Bizot\u2019s acquisition as deputy goalkeeper may be the only positional upgrade at Villa this summer.\nAdvertisement\nAs the second half meandered until Ezri Konsa\u2019s sending off, both sets of supporters were united in their frustrations. A catalogue of chants echoed around Villa Park, all critical of the Premier League. Claims of corruption and sheer disdain for PSR were part of the playlist. Two fanbases found mutual ground, sympathetic to the other\u2019s situation, with Newcastle previously unable to sign a senior player for three consecutive windows and Villa suffering similar inhibitions this summer.\nVilla\u2019s window was always going to be tough. Senior figures told The Athletic at the end of May that incomings were low down the list of priorities, with the primary concern being to remedy financial pressures.\nUnavoidably, though, it has left Villa undercooked and uninspiring, as evidenced in Saturday\u2019s goalless draw.\nThis was only \u201cday one\u201d, as Emery puts it, of a 38-match campaign. The road ahead is long. Yet the general flatness was an extension of Villa\u2019s summer. Zero shots in the first half did not enchant a Villa Park crowd that is normally in thrall to this Emery vintage.\nAs their manager voiced in the aftermath, it was concerning how many duels Villa lost in the first half. They were fortunate not to concede early on. The haywire passing \u2014 at one stage, their pass accuracy percentage was 15 percentage points lower than Newcastle\u2019s \u2014 was not in keeping with the on-ball precision for which Villa have been recognised.\nThe weight of evidence indicates that Emery\u2019s side, in defiance of their ongoing challenges, will not collapse completely because of an inherent robustness. Even when down to 10 men, Villa were well organised and negated Newcastle. They are now 22 competitive games unbeaten in all competitions at home \u2014 their longest run since 1977 (24 games) \u2014 showing the \u201cconsistency\u201d Emery is at pains to relay in most press conferences.\nAdvertisement\nThis was a goalless draw devoid of entertainment and quality, but revealing in what it lacked. For Newcastle, it was Alexander Isak. For Villa, it was collective inspiration, usually found in the transfer market. Both teams have similar ambitions \u2014 they have broken into the top six but want to do so regularly. They have owners willing to spend but are stunted by PSR.\nThe upshot is palpable, none more so than for the adults who paid \u00a377 to sit in the Holte End or those in the Doug Ellis or Trinity Stand, where tickets could range up to \u00a382. The squeeze is on and if you are not a traditional \u2018Big Six\u2019 club, a bottleneck approaches. Those with revenues not at the requisite level will have to check their aspirations.\nThis summer has been a paradox. Turbulent, yet stuck in a state of inertia, fighting off possible sanctions and regression on the pitch.\nVilla will dream as long as Emery is there, but those dreams are being disrupted by the stresses that disturb a good night\u2019s sleep.\n(Top photo: Michael Steele/Getty Images)"

      "text": "\u201cSometimes, yes, but it depends,\u201d replied Unai Emery, when The Athletic asked whether his Aston Villa side lacked width during Saturday\u2019s stalemate against visitors Newcastle United in both sides\u2019 first game of the new Premier League season.\nAn imbalance has emerged: Villa have a cluster of attacking midfielders and a scarcity of archetypal wingers. The only specialist in the first-team squad was Leon Bailey, who departed for Italian side Roma this week on a season-long loan.\nAdvertisement\nThey could even be adding to their central playmakers via a reunion with Marco Asensio.\nThe Paris Saint-Germain attacker, who made 21 appearances for Villa after joining on loan in February, would join Morgan Rogers, John McGinn, Youri Tielemans and Emiliano Buendia as attacking-midfield options. Emery also reckons summer acquisition Evann Guessand, who has mostly played as a wide forward in his career so far, has the skill set to play as a \u201cNo 10\u201d.\nEmery\u2019s attacking principles revolve around two No 10s when in possession, a way of playing that\u2019s designed to create central overloads. Villa rely heavily on offensive output through the middle of the pitch, with only Chelsea funnelling a greater proportion of their attacks centrally last season (31 per cent and 32 per cent of attacks respectively).\nThe Spanish manager\u2019s build-up style is also based on lopsided, asymmetrical full-backs, with the left-back high and the right-back tucking in as a third central defender.\nWidth is delivered from the left-back (in the image below, it\u2019s Lucas Digne) and right-winger (Bailey), enabling the ostensible \u201cleft-winger\u201d to operate as a second attacking midfielder. Before he also left the club this week, in a \u00a339million move to Newcastle, this would be Jacob Ramsey\u2019s role.\nThis produces a discernible shape in every game \u2014 a four-man \u2018box\u2019 midfield aims to progress the ball upfield, with the two forwards up ahead giving Villa six players in the central area of the pitch.\nFootball, though, is transitory. It requires evolution, as opponents will learn ways to negate vital components of your plan. As Villa found out in important matches last season, such as the FA Cup semi-final defeat against Crystal Palace, teams are no longer willing to step out, press Emery\u2019s back line and allow space to open up in midfield. Opponents are comfortable sitting in a defensive block and blocking passing lanes in midfield.\nAdvertisement\nSo the focus now magnifies on Villa\u2019s lack of width.\nThe passage that contributed to Ezri Konsa\u2019s red card in that 0-0 draw with Newcastle on Saturday can be traced back to the absence of a wide player.\nBelow, Villa lose possession after Matty Cash\u2019s cross is cut out, allowing Newcastle to transition. Ordinarily, Emery would prefer a winger in that crossing position rather than right-back Cash.\nHis recovery pace \u2014 similar to how Pep Guardiola used Kyle Walker at Manchester City \u2014 is imperative in guarding against counter-attacks. The Poland international has been the subject of interest from previous club Nottingham Forest, who are exploring a deal to sign him.\nIn an ideal world, Cash would remain behind the ball, in turn improving Villa\u2019s rest defence \u2014 a tactical term that assesses a team\u2019s structure and effectiveness, should they lose possession. Unsurprisingly, after the match, Emery was critical of his players\u2019 ability to curtail Newcastle\u2019s breakaways, explaining that the opportunities conceded stemmed from transitions.\nYet in this instance, Villa did not have sufficient numbers behind the ball, with their central defenders caught high.\nAnthony Gordon raced away, and Konsa felt he had no choice but to bring down his England team-mate.\nVilla\u2019s sparse width was telling and figured in a broadly flat opening-day display, despite showing spirited resolve to earn a point with 10 men for the final 25 minutes.\nA wide player is on the list of priorities as we approach the final week of the summer transfer window but, frankly, Emery\u2019s attacking strategy will invariably be built on their No 10s.\nEach one of his options sits in a strange predicament. Ramsey\u2019s departure leaves Villa short of one of their best ball carriers, even if his sale was described as \u201cneeds must\u201d by a Villa source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as they are not authorised to, in fighting potential UEFA financial sanctions.\nAdvertisement\nRogers is Villa\u2019s premium attacking midfielder, though he sustained an ankle injury in the friendly against Roma two weeks ago and is still working to return to full fitness. There is an acceptance internally that much of the attacking burden this campaign, owing to a trimmed squad, will rest on his shoulders. Only Mohamed Salah (18), Jacob Murphy (12) and Anthony Elanga (11) provided more Premier League assists than Rogers\u2019 10 last season.\nThe 23-year-old\u2019s versatility and varied skill set are essential to Villa. He can cover four positions and is on a low salary, relative to his standing. This is partly why, as The Athletic reported in July, Villa intend to offer Rogers improved terms at the end of this transfer window, reflecting his status as a key player and fending off several Premier League admirers. On Tuesday evening, he was named the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association (PFA) Young Player of the Year.\nWhile six-time England senior international Rogers was increasingly used off the right last season \u2014 due to a combination of a lack of wide options and Emery wanting a clutch of players who drift centrally in his line-up \u2014 there is hope that he plays either directly behind the centre-forward or off the left, where he can cut inside onto his stronger foot.\nMcGinn, like Rogers, is usually deployed centrally or on either flank. Villa are also planning contract negotiations with their club captain, following strong summer interest from Everton. It can be revealed that Villa turned down a formal offer at the end of July, contrary to reports of a bid being made this month. Scoring just one league goal, McGinn\u2019s attacking returns diminished last season, but Villa had already made clear that he would be staying. Though the Scot turns 31 in October, he is considered an integral part of Emery\u2019s plans.\nThen there is Buendia.\nHe was initially in the group of players Villa wanted to move on during this window, also comprising Roma loanee Bailey, Alex Moreno, who is close to joining Girona, and Leander Dendoncker, who signed for Real Oviedo this week. But after an impressive pre-season, Emery sees value in Buendia, with the 28-year-old in better shape and more attuned to the required intensity.\nBuendia is keen to stay, but his future will remain uncertain until the window shuts on the evening of Monday, September 1.\nEven when facing restrictions, Emery is not a manager to sit on his hands.\nThis relates to Asensio. Preferably, Villa would have activated their buy option at the end of his six-month loan earlier in the summer, but their headroom in the Premier League\u2019s profit and sustainability rules (PSR) was extremely tight then. Senior figures travelled to Madrid in June to explain the club\u2019s distribution of finances to Asensio\u2019s representatives and why they could not afford the required package at the time. Should funds be available towards the end of the summer window, circumstances may change.\nAsensio is still at PSG. Fenerbahce came closest to signing him but failed to agree a price with the European champions. The 29-year-old Spain international remains hopeful that Villa, in the final days of the market, will become an active possibility again, with his agent Jorge Mendes tasked with arranging a deal. It is not thought that personal terms would be a problem.\nAttacking midfielders have long formed Emery\u2019s style.\nThe summer\u2019s wider uncertainty is crystallised in each of them, with Emery needing to find a way to optimise their output again.\n(Top photo of Marco Asensio: Darren Staples/AFP via Getty Images)"

  "argos_summary": "Aston Villa\u2019s manager Unai Emery is grappling with the challenge of pairing two left\u2011footed centre\u2011backs, Pau Torres and Tyrone Mings, amid injuries, tactical awkwardness and a thin squad that lacks width. Recent defeats to Fulham and Brentford exposed defensive gaps and the difficulty of maintaining possession against pressing teams, prompting Emery to experiment with goal\u2011kick rotations, wing\u2011back roles for Matty Cash, and a back\u2011three shape. Financial constraints under UEFA\u2019s squad cost rules have forced the club to sell key players such as Leon Bailey and Jacob Ramsey, further limiting options on the flanks and forcing a reliance on midfield overloads and No\u201110s. Despite these hurdles, Emery remains committed to integrating the pair and refining Villa\u2019s build\u2011up play, hoping to restore the team\u2019s competitive edge in the Premier League and European competitions.\"}",
