(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz is considering calling the state Legislature into a special session to vote on an assault weapons ban and other gun control measures following a mass shooting in Minneapolis that killed two and wounded 18 others, a person close to the governor told the Reformer on Friday.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about Walz\u2019s deliberations.\n\nWalz\u2019s office is expected to make an announcement related to the special session as soon as next week, the person said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to take serious action at the State Capitol to address gun violence,\u201d Walz said in a social media post Friday afternoon. The governor offered no further details.\n\nA shooter opened fire at Annunciation Church in south Minneapolis on Wednesday, killing 8-year-old Fletcher Merkel and 10-year-old Harper Moyski and injuring 18 others, all children and senior citizens.\n\nFederal, state and city Democratic lawmakers joined gun safety advocates Thursday to call for a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines.\n\nNew gun legislation would face an uphill climb in the closely divided Legislature.\n\nRepublicans \u2014 led by Speaker Lisa Demuth and who are strongly aligned with the gun rights movement \u2014 have 67 members in the House, while Democrats count 66 in their ranks following the June assassination of Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman. Walz and DFL lawmakers are hoping the shooting of a church filled with schoolchildren would pressure Republicans to accede to new laws. A special election to replace Hortman in safely blue District 34B is Sept. 16.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mark Johnson, R-East Grand Forks, dismissed the idea of a special election: \u201cRepublicans are committed to addressing the root causes of violence, supporting safe schools, and increasing access to mental health resources. Calling for a special session without even consulting legislative leaders is not a serious way to begin,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis is a partisan stunt from a governor who continues to engage in destructive political rhetoric.\u201d\n\nAbsent new laws, Republicans would be forced to vote on the issue a little more than a year from a crucial midterm election when all 201 legislative seats will be on the ballot.\n\nDemocrats had control of the Legislature for two years and failed to pass a statewide ban on assault weapons. Democratic House Floor Leader Jamie Long of Minneapolis said he had the bill drafted but didn\u2019t introduce it because he didn\u2019t think they were ready.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready now,\u201d Long said Thursday. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have taken tragedy coming to Minnesota to be ready.\u201d\n\nDemocrats did pass a slate of gun control laws when they held power in 2023 and 2024. They instituted an extreme risk protection order, or \u201cred flag,\u201d law that allows family members or police to ask judges to take guns from people deemed a danger to themselves or others.\n\nThey also passed universal background check requirements on private gun sales as well as increased penalties for possession of converted machine guns and \u201cstraw purchases\u201d when people buy guns for someone not legally allowed to possess them.\n\nOne gun safety measure \u2014 a ban on binary triggers which increase the rate of fire of semiautomatic weapons \u2014 was recently struck down by a judge because it passed in a monster, 1,400-page bill that violated the state Constitution\u2019s requirement that laws are confined to a single subject.\n\nAlthough a special legislative session would force Republicans to take potentially difficult votes on gun regulation, it would also give them an opportunity to propose legislation of their own. They could bring bills related to the latest wave of Medicaid fraud allegations, which were so significant in a housing stabilization program that Walz recently shuttered the entire program.\n\nGiven the apparent transgender identity of the shooter, Republicans could also be expected to bring forth anti-trans legislation. U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer, 6th District Republican and House majority whip, told the New York Post this week that lawmakers should overturn a 2023 law that made Minnesota a trans refuge state.\n\nComplicating matters, the state Senate is currently short two members until a Nov. 4 special election. Until then, the Senate is 33-32, with Democrats in control, but they can\u2019t pass any bills without 34 votes.\n\nAlthough only the governor can call the Legislature into special session, lawmakers have the power to adjourn.",

      "text": "House GOP Whip Tom Emmer calls for repeal of Minnesota\u2019s \u2018trans refuge\u2019 law\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The third-ranking House Republican called Thursday for Minnesota to repeal its \u201ctrans refuge\u201d law in an exclusive interview with The Post following Wednesday\u2019s deadly shooting targeting Catholic school students in Minneapolis.\n\u201cWe got to respect everyone. We got to have compassion for everyone. But we got to understand that we\u2019ve got some serious mental health issues that are being exacerbated by these types of messages by people like Tim Walz and everybody who supported that law,\u201d said House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, whose district covers many of the Twin Cities\u2019 outer northern and western suburbs.\n\u201cThey should immediately repeal it, but they won\u2019t,\u201d Emmer added. \u201cThey have been encouraging this type of confusion. This poor young man was tortured. He clearly had serious mental health issues and rather than actually helping him, they were actually exacerbating it.\u201d\nThe 2023 legislation, signed by Democratic Gov. Tim Walz blocks out-of-state subpoenas, arrest warrants and extradition requests for people who travel to the Land of 10,000 Lakes from other states for sex-reassignment surgeries or hormone treatments.\nCritics have also argued the law is written broadly enough to pave the way for parents to lose custody of their children if they oppose transition procedures.\nEmmer claimed Walz\u2019s \u201ctransgender sanctuary\u201d measure would let any minor transition without their parents\u2019 consent.\n\u201cYou look at the sadness of these tortured human beings \u2014 because they do have regrets later \u2014 and no, we should have never started it. It should not be allowed.\u201d\nRobin Westman, born Robert Westman, killed two children and wounded 17 others \u2014 including 14 youngsters \u2014 at the Annunciation Catholic Church and School Wednesday morning before turning the gun on himself.\nWestman applied to change his birth name from Robert to Robin in Dakota County, Minn., when he was 17 years old, court documents show, with the change granted in January 2020.\nHere's what we know about the Catholic school shooting in Minneapolis\n- Students had begun their first week of school at the Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, Minnesota, two days before the shooting.\n- Robin Westman, a 23-year-old trans woman, opened fire through the stained glass windows on Wednesday morning during a celebratory back-to-school Mass filled with children.\n- The shooting killed two children and injured at least 17 others, before Westman died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n- Westman had written \u201ckill Donald Trump\u201d and \u201cfor the children\u201d on gun magazines, and posted videos of a handwritten manifesto.\n- Westman\u2019s mother had worked at the school.\nWestman\u2019s mother, Mary Grace Westman, was a secretary at the Catholic school until retiring in 2021, according to a Facebook post by the church. She now lives in Florida.\nHis father, James Westman, is a Minnesota resident. The couple divorced in 2013.\n\u201cSomebody had to know,\u201d Emmer said Thursday, \u201cSomebody in his neighborhood, somebody in his family, somebody in his network, somebody had to know that he had these serious mental health issues and why didn\u2019t someone speak up? Why didn\u2019t somebody offer him some help?\u201d\nIn a manifesto posted on YouTube before the massacre, Westman wrote: \u201cI only keep [the long hair] because it is pretty much my last shred of being trans. I am tired of being trans, I wish I never brain-washed myself,\u201d he wrote, according to a translation by The Post.\nAnother page showed a diagram of the church that he thrust a knife into the center of in one video, while still other videos posted by the gunman showed ammo magazines with the message, \u201cWhere is your God?\u201d\nEmmer said he fully supported the FBI investigating the shooting as an anti-Catholic hate crime and act of domestic terrorism.\nOn Tuesday, one person was killed and six were injured at a shooting next to Cristo Rey Jesuit High School in Minneapolis, a spurt of violence that Emmer said seemed oddly targeted at Catholic institutions.\nHe also slammed Democratic officials and liberal pundits for criticizing those asking for prayers amid the tragedy.\n\u201cContrary to what my Minneapolis mayor says,\u201d the lawmaker said of Jacob Frey, \u201cwe are keeping all of these families in both shootings and the victims that are involved in our thoughts and prayers.\u201d\nHours after Westman opened fire through the windows of the church while students were praying at Mass, Frey had said at a press conference: \u201cDon\u2019t just say this is about thoughts and prayers right now: These kids were literally praying.\u201d\n\u201cIt really is a slap in the face to the victims and their families for the young, immature mayor of Minneapolis to suggest that this is not a time to have thoughts and prayers,\u201d Emmer said. \u201cThat\u2019s so inappropriate.\u201d\nFormer Biden White House press secretary Jen Psaki erupted on X as well.\n\u201cPrayer is not freaking enough,\u201d Psaki posted Wednesday. \u201cPrayers does not end school shootings. prayers do not make parents feel safe sending their kids to school. Prayer does not bring these kids back. Enough with the thoughts and prayers.\u201d\nVice President JD Vance responded to Psaki\u2019s post: \u201cWe pray because our hearts are broken. We pray because we know God listens. We pray because we know that God works in mysterious ways, and can inspire us to further action.\n\u201cWhy do you feel the need to attack other people for praying when kids were just killed praying?\u201d Vance asked."
