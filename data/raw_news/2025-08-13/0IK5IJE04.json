  "title": "How I Spot AI-Written Product Reviews Before I Get Scammed",
  "description": "Can you trust those glowing reviews? Learn the tricks to separate real from AI.",
  "content": "Shopping online is easy. Too easy. You see a product, scroll through the reviews, and before you know it, you're buying it. But the problem is that not every glowing review you read comes from an actual human. AI writes some, and spotting them isn't always straightforward. Here's what I look out for.\n\nOne of the easiest tells is in the writing itself. AI-generated reviews often sound like they've been combed over by a panel of grammar sticklers\u2014every sentence pristine, punctuation flawless, not a single stray typo. Which is fine, I guess. But that's just not how most of us bang out a quick product review.\n\nWhen I'm leaving a review, I'm usually typing on my phone, and not writing like my editor would proofread it. I'll toss in slang, skip words, maybe drop something like, \"luv it!\" or \"meh, not bad.\" If I'm feeling a touch more formal, it's still along the lines of, \"Does the job. A bit noisy, but grinds fast. Worth the money.\"\n\nOf course, that's not how everyone writes reviews, but it links to my next point nicely.\n\nAI loves being vague and nonspecific in its reviews whenever possible. It will spit out stuff like, \"the craftsmanship of this product exceeded my expectations at an unbeatable price,\" and even add tired clich\u00e9s like \"... total game-changer,\" which tells me absolutely nothing, and could apply to a frying pan, a sofa, or a pair of socks. And sometimes it just parrots the product description word for word.\n\nA real buyer, on the other hand, is more likely to give oddly specific, lived-in feedback you get from someone who's actually used a laptop bag, like, \"The front pocket is just big enough for my notebook, but I wish it had a side pouch for my water bottle.\" They might talk about the exact color (\"the navy blue looks darker in person\"), the model quirks, or the little inconveniences that come with actually using the product.\n\nSometimes the giveaway isn't in a single review, but in the chorus, they form together in a row. AI-written ones have this telltale habit of leaning on the same stock phrases. If I keep spotting identical sentence rhythms or copy-paste language, my suspicion radar starts blipping. And while AI can remix its wording, lazy spammers often don't bother; they'll just drop the same blurb under a handful of fake names.\n\nIt's also worth checking if different reviewers coincidentally fixate on the same oddly specific point. If three different people all declare that a blender is \"perfect for making smoothies for two,\" in those exact words, I'm pretty sure none of them actually went anywhere near a smoothie.\n\nAnother thing I check is the timeline of reviews. If a product has been online for months but suddenly gets twenty 5-star reviews in the same week, that's a red flag.\n\nAI makes it easy for sellers to flood a product page with glowing feedback all at once. Real customers leave reviews more sporadically. A sudden spike in reviews often means someone is trying to boost a product's rating quickly, usually before a sales event or to bury earlier bad reviews.\n\nMost shopping sites let you sort reviews by date, so it's easy to spot when a suspicious cluster appears.\n\nVisuals can also be a giveaway. Many AI-written reviews come with generic stock-looking images, or the photos don't match the product exactly.\n\nWhen in doubt, reverse-image search the photo. If it's from a stock photography site or appears in dozens of other listings, it's not from a real buyer. Real customer photos tend to be slightly messy, like a shot of the product on their kitchen table or in their hand, with all the imperfections of quick phone photography.\n\nWhen my gut tells me a review section is sketchy, I sometimes turn to browser extensions for automatically detecting AI content like Copyleaks, which can scan any review for AI-generated text right from your browser. If a review has you second-guessing, just highlight the text, click the little Copyleaks icon that pops up underneath, and a sidebar will slide in from the right to tell you in seconds whether it suspects AI had a hand in it.\n\nFor the image side of things, BitMind is great at detecting AI-generated images. All you have to do is hover over a product photo, and it'll give you a probability score of whether \"Real\" or AI-generated\" in the top-right corner of the image, so photorealistic but fake pictures do not fool you.\n\nWhile these tools aren't perfect (they can sometimes flag legitimate reviews or miss bad ones), they're a good extra layer of protection. I don't rely on them completely, but I use them to back up my own instincts.\n\nAI-written reviews aren't always easy to spot, as no single sign is enough to declare a review fake. However, when I see several of these red flags together, I take a step back before buying.",

      "text": "Google's Reverse Image Search is one of the best ways to discover the source for an image. It can be an online profile of someone you are trying to contact or the origin of a meme you love.\nWhen you learn how to do a reverse image search, it will open up an alternative to the keyword search we use as a habit. You can use it at work to find related presentation templates or just better resolution versions of images. A Google reverse image search is a powerful tactic these days to combat fake news.\nHow to Reverse Image Search (Desktop)\nThere are three ways to do a Google reverse image search on a desktop. First, open Google Images in your favorite browser. In our example, we are using Chrome on Windows 10.\n- Click the camera icon, then select Upload an image.\n- Drag-and-drop an image from the web or your computer on the Google Image search page.\n- Right-click an image and select Copy image address from the context menu to copy the URL. On the Google Image Search page, click the camera icon, paste the image URL in the labeled box, and Select Search by image.\nHow to Reverse Image Search (Mobile)\nYou don't need an app always to do a reverse image search from an iPhone or an Android.\nUse the Chrome Browser\nThe process is a bit different on the smartphone or a tablet because we rely on screen taps. But it's just as simple. Try it with the Chrome browser for Android and iOS. The screenshots below are from an iPhone.\n- Go to any webpage and tap on the photo, and open it in full-screen view.\n- Press and hold your finger on the screen and choose Search Google for this image from the menu.\n- Google displays the results with the pages where it has found the image.\nNote: This reverse search feature works only on the Chrome browser on iOS and Android. It does not work on any other browser or even on the Google app.\nUse the Desktop Site for the Reverse Image Search\nThe Google Image Search page on a mobile browser does not show the camera icon as in the desktop version. To use that method, you'll need to switch to the desktop version on your mobile device.\n- To switch to the site's desktop version, tap on the menu button (three dots on the bottom right). Next, scroll down the menu and select Request Desktop Site. On the desktop version of the page, tap the camera icon in the search bar.\n- Use the interface like the desktop version of Google Image Search. Then, do a reverse search by uploading a photo from the photo gallery on your iPhone or Android.\n- You can also take a photo with the camera or browse the Files app (and any connected cloud storage site) and upload it directly for identification.\nUse Google Lens for a Reverse Image Search\nYou can use Google Lens for many interesting searches. A reverse image search for pictures is one of them. Google Lens has a dedicated app for Android, but it's also a feature on the Google app, Google Photos, and Google Assistant on iOS and Android.\n- Open the Google app.\n- Tap on the Google Lens icon next to the search bar.\n- Point your camera towards a real-world object and tap on Search.\n- Alternatively, tap on the Photo picker and choose a saved photo from the gallery.\n- A window slides up from the bottom with all the search results.\nNote: Google Lens allows you to select smaller parts of an image and do an image search. You can select an object in the picture or draw a selection box around any part of the image to start the search.\nDownload: Google Lens for Android (Free)\nUse Other Methods to Reverse Image Search Too\nDid you know that Bing also has a method to reverse search with any picture? Bing calls it Visual Search, and it works just like Google Lens on any browser. Just go to the Bing Search page and select the Camera icon. So, you have more than one choice to search for unknown images on your mobile, and these give you another way to search the web."

      "text": "Are you looking at an AI-generated image? These days, it's hard to tell what was and wasn't generated by AI\u2014thanks in part to a group of incredible AI image generators like DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion. But there is a way. Similar to identifying a Photoshopped picture, you can learn the markers that identify an AI image.\nThey often have bizarre visual distortions which you can train yourself to spot. And sometimes, the use of AI is plainly disclosed in the image description, so it's always worth checking. If all else fails, you can try your luck running the image through an AI image detector.\n1. Check the Title, Description, and Comments Section (Plus the Tags)\nNot everyone agrees that you need to disclose the use of AI when posting images, but for those who do choose to, that information will either be in the title or description section of a post.\nAnother good place to look is in the comments section, where the author might have mentioned it. In the images above, for example, the complete prompt used to generate the artwork was posted, which proves useful for anyone wanting to experiment with different AI art prompt ideas.\nBesides the title, description, and comments section, you can also head to their profile page to look for clues as well. Keywords like Midjourney or DALL-E, the names of two popular AI art generators, are enough to let you know that the images you're looking at could be AI-generated.\nSome online art communities like DeviantArt are adapting to the influx of AI-generated images by creating dedicated categories just for AI art. When browsing these kinds of sites, you will also want to keep an eye out for what tags the author used to classify the image.\nThis extends to social media sites like Instagram or X (formerly Twitter), where an image could be labeled with a hashtag such as #AI, #Midjourney, #Dall-E, etc.\n2. Look for a Watermark\nAnother important clue for identifying an AI-generated image is a watermark. DALL-E 2 places one on every image you download from its site, though it may not be obvious at first. Can you spot the watermark in the image above?\nYou can find it in the bottom right corner of the picture, it looks like five squares colored yellow, turquoise, green, red, and blue. If you see this watermark on an image you come across, then you can be sure it was created using AI.\nThe problem is, it's really easy to download the same image without a watermark if you know how to do it, and doing so isn't against OpenAI's policy. So long as you \"don't mislead others about the nature of the work\". For example, by telling them you made it yourself, or that it's a photograph of a real-life event. Outside of this, OpenAI's guidelines permit you to remove the watermark.\nMidjourney, on the other hand, doesn't use watermarks at all, leaving it u to users to decide if they want to credit AI in their images.\n3. Search for AI Distortions in the Image\nYou may not notice them at first, but AI-generated images often share some odd visual markers that are more obvious when you take a closer look.\nFrom a distance, the image above shows several dogs sitting around a dinner table, but on closer inspection, you realize that some of the dog's eyes are missing, and other faces simply look like a smudge of paint.\nThe effect is similar to impressionist paintings, which are made up of short paint strokes that capture the essence of a subject. They are best viewed at a distance if you want to get a sense of what's going on in the scene, and the same is true of some AI-generated art. It's usually the finer details that give away the fact that it's an AI-generated image, and that's true of people too.\nTake a closer look at the AI-generated face above, for example, taken from the website This Person Does Not Exist. Notice anything odd? It could fool just about anyone into thinking it's a real photo of a person, except for the missing section of the glasses and the bizarre way the glasses seem to blend into the skin.\nWhile these anomalies might go away as AI systems improve, we can all still laugh at why the best AI art generators struggle with hands. Take a quick look at how poorly AI renders the human hand, and it's not hard to see why.\nExtra fingers are a sure giveaway, but there's also something else going on. It could be the angle of the hands or the way the hand is interacting with subjects in the image, but it clearly looks unnatural and not human-like at all.\nWhen it comes to photorealistic images of humans, there are several more AI markers you can look for:\n- Missing or mismatched earrings\n- A blurred background that looks more like a texture\n- Text in the background is indistinguishable or gibberish\n- Asymmetry in the face (teeth off center, eyes are different sizes)\n- Patches of the photo look as if it's been painted\n- Objects like glasses or earrings blend into the skin\n- Hands have extra fingers or clearly look awkward and unnatural\nEven when looking out for these AI markers, sometimes it's incredibly hard to tell the difference, and you might need to spend extra time to train yourself to spot fake media.\n4. Use an AI Image Detector\nSome people are jumping on the opportunity to solve the problem of identifying an image's origin. As we start to question more of what we see on the internet, businesses like Optic are offering convenient web tools you can use.\nThe AI or Not web tool lets you drop in an image and quickly check if it was generated using AI. It claims to be able to detect images from the biggest AI art generators; Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion.\nTake it with a grain of salt, however, as the results are not foolproof. In our tests, it did do a better job than previous tools of its kind. But it also produced plenty of wrong analysis, making it not much better than a guess.\nSince the results are unreliable, it's best to use this tool in combination with other methods to test if an image is AI-generated. The reason for mentioning AI image detectors, such as this one, is that further development will likely produce an app that is highly accurate one day. It's worth keeping an eye out for developments.\nSlowly but surely progress is being made. When Microsoft released a deep fake detection tool, positive signs pointed to more large companies offering user-friendly tools for detecting AI images.\nWhat to Expect in the Future\nWithout a doubt, AI generators will improve in the coming years, to the point where AI images will look so convincing that we won't be able to tell just by looking at them. At that point, you won't be able to rely on visual anomalies to tell an image apart.\nHopefully, by then, we won't need to because there will be an app or website that can check for us, similar to how we're now able to reverse image search.\nFor now, people who use AI to create images should follow the recommendation of OpenAI and be honest about its involvement. It's not bad advice and takes just a moment to disclose in the title or description of a post.\nAt the very least, don't mislead others by telling them you created a work of art when in reality it was made using DALL-E, Midjourney, or any of the other AI text-to-art generators.\nSpotting an AI-Generated Image\nAI images are getting better and better every day, so figuring out if an artwork was made by a computer will take some detective work.\nCheck the title, description, comments, and tags, for any mention of AI, then take a closer look at the image for a watermark or odd AI distortions. You can always run the image through an AI image detector, but be wary of the results as these tools are still developing towards more accurate and reliable results.\nAt the end of the day, using a combination of these methods is the best way to work out if you're looking at an AI-generated image."

      "text": "AI content is the bane of our online existences; distinguishing between human and AI-generated text and images is becoming unfathomably difficult. That's why I use these Chrome extensions to detect AI content quickly\u2014they'll become part of your daily browsing experience quicker than you think!\n3 AI Content Detector - Copyleaks\nI've experimented with several AI detectors. I found Copyleaks to be effective at spotting content created by ChatGPT's creative model and other AI tools. It only focuses on text analysis, though\u2014don't expect it to identify AI-generated images.\nWhen installed, the clean interface features a draggable quick access menu that you can position anywhere on your screen, which I've found convenient. This menu features simple Settings and a Scan for AI content option when you hover over it.\nThe workflow is straightforward but requires a few steps. First, select suspicious text on any webpage, and a small icon appears. Click it, and your selection automatically populates in the sidebar. Then you'll need to hit the scan button to analyze the text\u2014a small extra step I sometimes forget about when I'm in a hurry.\nOne annoying aspect is that you need to create an account before using the extension. The free trial gives you five credits (with one credit equaling 250 words), which isn't much if you're regularly checking content. Interestingly, I've been using the trial version for weeks and somehow still have all five credits showing\u2014I'm not complaining, but don't count on that glitch lasting!\nIf you're serious about AI detection, the Pro version starts at $9.99 per month, covering roughly 25,000 words with 100 credits. That might seem pricey, but if you're concerned about reasons AI checkers might flag your writing, it could be worth the investment.\nOne frustrating aspect of Copyleaks is its binary approach to detection\u2014it only flags content as either 100% AI-generated or 0% AI-generated, with no middle ground. I've had it incorrectly flag my own writing as AI-generated a few times, which is annoying. This black-and-white approach exhibits that AI might hallucinate or that human writing can sometimes resemble AI patterns.\n2 AI Detector - BitMind\nUnlike Copyleaks, BitMind focuses exclusively on spotting AI-generated images, rather than text, which is equally important as detecting AI-generated text. And you don't need to create an account to use it. You can install it, jump right in, and start detecting AI images anonymously.\nThis tool is useful when you're browsing photography websites, scrolling through social media, or researching images for work. It might also be useful when scrolling through e-commerce websites, as some of them may feature fake products. For example, Etsy is often flooded with AI-generated images.\nAnother reason is that a recent study shows generative AI images evoke a sense of uncanniness in subtle ways, which even trained human eyes struggle to detect consistently.\nThe extension works by analyzing any image you encounter while browsing. When you hover over an image, BitMind displays a percentage match in the top-right corner. That indicates how likely it believes the image was generated by AI. This quick visual indicator saves you from having to click anything or wait for results on a separate page.\nI found BitMind's analysis takes around 10 seconds per image, which can feel a bit slow when scrolling through image-heavy websites. During my testing, it correctly identified AI images roughly 70% to 80% of the time\u2014not perfect, but certainly helpful as a first-pass detection tool.\nOne limitation you might face is that BitMind occasionally flags authentic photographs as AI-generated, as seen in the following image. This isn't entirely the extension's fault, as today's AI images have become quite realistic, making the boundaries between real and synthetic increasingly blurry.\nWhile I don't trust AI to do most photo edits myself, having tools like BitMind helps spot potentially AI-generated content when verifying sources, fact-checking news, or simply satisfying your curiosity about whether that too-perfect image is actually real.\n1 Hive AI Detector\nThe Hive AI Detector stands out for its versatility\u2014it handles text, images, and even audio or video content, up to 30 seconds long. You can access it in multiple ways: highlight text and right-click to select Hive AI Detector from the menu, or use the draggable icon that opens a sidebar where you can paste content directly (up to 2,048 characters).\nFor images, right-click and select Hive AI Detector from the context menu. Using this extension is handy because it not only tells you if an image is AI-generated but also tries to identify which specific AI model was likely used to create it, along with a confidence percentage.\nWhile Hive's accuracy seems solid, like other AI detectors you can try, it sometimes delivers confusing results. This hit-or-miss nature is unfortunately common with detection tools, as AI can detect and prevent malicious attacks, but still struggles with perfect accuracy.\nThe best part? You don't need to create an account or enter your email address to use this extension. Just install it and start using it. It respects your privacy while still providing a powerful detection tool.\nBut remember that these extensions are just tools to supplement your critical thinking. As AI content becomes more sophisticated, your gut feeling about authenticity might sometimes prove more reliable than any algorithm's determination. Trust, but verify, that's my approach to navigating the internet."

  "argos_summary": "Shopping online can be complicated by the presence of AI-generated reviews, which often exhibit perfect grammar, vague language, and repetitive phrases. To identify these reviews, consumers should look for specific details, check the review timeline for sudden spikes, and analyze images for stock characteristics. Tools like Copyleaks and BitMind can assist in detecting AI content, but users should combine these tools with their instincts to ensure authenticity.",
