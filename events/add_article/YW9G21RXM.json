      "summary": "Bloomberg Daybreak Europe highlights a mix of global market moves and policy updates: China’s new crackdown on stock speculation has sparked a sell‑off, while Apple’s announcement of an AI‑powered web search tool has lifted its shares to the highest gain of the month. Markets broadly rallied on weaker‑than‑expected U.S. jobs data that bolstered expectations of Fed rate cuts, but the Chinese sell‑off tempered gains in Asia and weighed on the MSCI Asia Pacific index. Additional stories cover European political developments—France’s fiscal uncertainty, the U.K.’s inflation‑driven bond rally, and the ongoing debate over U.S. tariffs—underscoring a backdrop of high interest rates and cautious investor sentiment.",
