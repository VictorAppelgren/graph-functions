  "description": "A Portland megachurch's revival event attracted 35,000 attendees, according to the church, in region where non-religious residents outnumber Christians.",
  "content": "A major Christian revival event in Portland, Oregon this month drew one of the city's largest faith-based gatherings in decades.\n\nThe PDX Crusade, hosted by Athey Creek Church in partnership with other churches, welcomed 35,000 attendees to the Moda Center in Portland on August 2-3, according to event organizers. The two-night gathering featured gospel messages and worship by popular Christian artists Chris Tomlin, Zach Williams, CAIN, TAYA, Anne Wilson, Kari Jobe and Cody Carnes. The church reported that 3,200 people came forward during the altar calls. Volunteers distributed Bibles and connected new believers with local churches, according to a CBN report.\n\nThe event was one of the most significant evangelical gatherings Portland has seen in decades. In 2020, an outdoor worship protest during the height of coronavirus restrictions drew between 4,000 and 7,000 people. Prior to that, the late evangelist Luis Palau hosted large festivals in Portland that combined music with food and preaching. His 1999 festival reportedly reached over 90,000 people.\n\nPDX Crusade attendees, like Portland resident Laura Lybrand, were in awe of the turnout.\n\n\"I\u2019m really excited about it,\" she told Oregon Public Broadcasting as she stood in line for the event. \"I haven\u2019t seen anything like this in a long, long time.\"\n\nAthey Creek senior pastor Brett Meador delivered Gospel sermons each night of the crusade in which he addressed the city\u2019s struggles with homelessness, crime and lack of faith, according to the OPB report.\n\n\"Why is there so much darkness here?\" Meador said to the crowd. \"I believe it\u2019s because we have often pushed Jesus \u2014 the real light of the world \u2014 out.\"\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center\u2019s 2023\u20132024 Religious Landscape Study, the Portland\u2013Vancouver metro area is the only one of the 34 largest U.S. metropolitan regions where religiously unaffiliated people outnumber those identifying as Christian (44% to 42%).\n\nMeador, who moved to Portland in 1996 because it was considered the most irreligious city in America, views the region as ripe for revival.\n\nCHICAGO'S 'ROOFTOP PASTOR' TO EMBARK ON EPIC CROSS-COUNTRY JOURNEY TO BENEFIT AMERICA'S TROUBLED YOUTH\n\nThe pastor previously decried the city's \"stupidity, wokeness and failure,\" in a sermon in July, according to the report, after the Oregon House of Representatives hosted a drag performance to celebrate Pride month.\n\nHe hoped the PDX Crusade will be a catalyst for a spiritual awakening in the secular city.\n\n\"I believe the Lord\u2019s doing a great work in Portland, and it\u2019s evident here tonight,\" Meador said, according to KLove. \"But we have more work to do and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important for us to declare that He is the light of the world.\"\n\nSome attendees suggested that the Pacific Northwest may be on the verge of a broader religious revival.\n\n\"I\u2019ve just seen a number of different people over these last few months and years that are moving from different areas to the [Willamette] Valley, because they feel like there\u2019s some sort of revival taking place,\" said Brandon Porter of Newberg, also speaking to OPB. \"They feel like God\u2019s called them here.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\nAthey Creek Executive Pastor Rick Anderson said that leadership is now considering whether to continue the crusade as an annual tradition.\n\n\"If the city of Portland reflects back and recognizes that this was a catalyst for reviving the church\u2026 and really bringing the love of Jesus to a lost and desperate world, we\u2019re going to consider that a success,\" Anderson told OPB.\n\nThe Portland crusade followed another large religious revival event in Los Angeles in July.\n\nAround 45,000 people packed Angel Stadium to attend pastor and evangelist Greg Laurie\u2019s Harvest Crusade on July 19. Harvest Church said it was the second consecutive year the stadium had been packed out for the event and an additional 200,000 people watched the crusade online.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

      "text": "Three hours before the gates opened, people camped outside the Moda Center to secure the best seats possible. They were there for PDX Crusade, one of the largest Christian revival meetings Portland has seen in decades.\nThe event was hosted by Athey Creek Christian Fellowship, a megachurch based in West Linn, and its founding pastor, Brett Meador.\nThousands of people traveled from across the region to attend, a line snaking around the Rose Quarter. Some of the biggest names in modern Christian music were performing, including Chris Tomlin and Zach Williams.\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited about it,\u201d Laury Lybrand of Portland said as she stood in line. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything like this in a long, long time.\u201d\nThe revival during the first weekend of August had a rock concert atmosphere. Smoke machines billowed and stage lights flashed, while the thousands in attendance sang along, their arms raised and tears filling their eyes.\nIn Meador\u2019s first sermon, he urged those in attendance to commit their lives to Jesus and the words of the Bible. But he also talked about Portland, hitting on familiar themes: homelessness, crime and a lack of faith in the region.\n\u201cWhy is there so much darkness here?\u201d Meador said to the crowd. \u201cI believe it\u2019s because we have often pushed Jesus \u2014 the real light of the world \u2014 out.\u201d\nWhile Meador and Athey Creek focused on Portland\u2019s modern problems, the idea of saving the Rose City from wickedness has attracted evangelists for nearly 100 years.\nSaving Portland\u2019s soul\nSaving souls in Portland has been an integral part of Pastor Brett Meador\u2019s mission for almost 30 years. The founder of Athey Creek Christian Fellowship, he has said in interviews that he moved to Portland in 1996 partially because of the city\u2019s status as the \u201cleast churched city in America.\u201d\nMeador\u2019s church started in a living room before moving to Athey Creek Middle School, where he became known for his verse-by-verse teachings of the Bible. Athey Creek now worships in a large building in West Linn, with two additional campuses in Hillsboro and McMinnville.\nThe city of Portland is a frequent topic for Meador; he has critiqued the city for its liberal politics and active protests. The promotional video for the crusade shows a montage of footage from the 2020 George Floyd protests and tents lining the streets.\n\u201cPortland is the tip of the spear in America of stupidity, wokeness and failure,\u201d Meador said in a July 3 sermon, before lamenting drag queens performing on the floor of the Oregon House of Representatives.\nThrough a spokesperson, Meador declined multiple requests for an interview. Athey Creek Executive Pastor Rick Anderson told OPB his church was aiming to provide hope to a region that has struggled in recent years.\n\u201cOur heart is for Portland,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThe Rose City has slowly declined in terms of its appeal, the way that it has devolved into what it is today from really a beautiful city.\u201d\nA long history of evangelism\nAthey Creek is not the first church to host large-scale revivals in Portland.\nLeah Payne, a professor of American religious history at George Fox University, said West Coast cities like Portland have long been a focal point for evangelists.\nThe Portland metro area has one of the lowest rates of religious affiliation in the country, according to the Pew Research Center, but low church attendance is nothing new for the area.\n\u201cFor the last 100 years or so, revivalists have looked at cities like Portland as a special place where they need to focus their energy to clean out the godless state of the city,\u201d Payne said. \u201cIt\u2019s become a shorthand for what they see as an increasingly secular United States.\u201d\nFamed evangelist Billy Graham held multiple revivals, dubbed \u201ccrusades,\u201d in Portland starting in 1950, and the spiritual failings of Portland were often discussed. His 1992 crusade drew more than 40,000 people to Civic Stadium, which is now Providence Park. Meador has cited Graham as an inspiration for the PDX Crusade.\nAttracting converts and new members is central to these revivals. Typically, that happens during an altar call, where a pastor will invite the audience to approach the stage to convert and accept Jesus Christ.\n\u201cThis context of the revivals is often where people will have these \u2018born again\u2019 experiences and have a shift in their life,\u201d said Susanna Morrill, professor of religion at Lewis & Clark College. \u201cThey\u2019re really important for missionizing, but also for individuals.\u201d\nBut the portrayal of Portland as a spiritually desolate place struck the wrong chord with some. Karyn Richards-Kuan, the senior pastor at First United Methodist Church in Portland, said she didn\u2019t agree with how Athey Creek portrayed the city.\n\u201cIt sort of did paint this picture of Portland as a place of desperation, and they said that they believe that Jesus was the answer. And for me, there\u2019s just so much more to it,\u201d Richards-Kuan said. \u201cI think the focus on salvation alone really misses the mark.\u201d\nChurches within the city limits had little involvement in organizing the event. Of the 17 churches that helped Athey Creek in putting together the PDX Crusade, none were from Portland, according to a list provided by a church spokesperson. All were from surrounding suburbs.\n\u201cIt was all these congregations sort of looking into the city as this big, bad, dark place, rather than the congregations who are serving in the city and who see it as a place of great light and opportunity,\u201d Richards-Kuan said.\n\u2018Reviving the church\u2019\nFor the thousands inside the Moda Center, the PDX Crusade lived up to the hype.\nAt the end of Meador\u2019s sermon, people began streaming to the stadium floor, trailed by hundreds of volunteers distributing Athey Creek-branded Bibles and other information.\nBy the end of the weekend, Athey Creek declared the PDX Crusade a success: 35,000 people attended the three events, and 3,200 people responded to the altar call, according to the church.\nSome attendees felt the size and scale of the crusade was a sign that attitudes toward religion could be changing in the Pacific Northwest.\n\u201cI\u2019ve just seen a number of different people over these last few months and years that are moving from different areas to the [Willamette] Valley, because they feel like there\u2019s some sort of revival taking place,\u201d Brandon Porter of Newberg said. \u201cThey feel like God\u2019s called them here.\u201d\nAnderson said the Athey Creek leadership is now considering whether the PDX Crusade will become an annual tradition.\n\u201cIf the city of Portland reflects back and recognizes that this was a catalyst for reviving the church \u2026 and really bringing the love of Jesus to a lost and desperate world, we\u2019re going to consider that a success,\u201d Anderson said."

      "text": "A Seattle pastor is speaking out after violent protests engulfed a worship event earlier in May and persisted in a follow-up event on Tuesday outside City Hall.\nOrganizers hosted a Mayday USA rally at Cal Anderson Park in Seattle on Saturday, which The Pursuit NW Pastor Russell Johnson helped lead. The event reportedly offered free haircuts, free bike giveaways and free groceries for the community as well as time for prayer and worship.\nThe event was later \"swarmed\" by protesters, some of whom reportedly threw urine-filled water balloons at attendees, and more than 20 arrests were made.\n\"[Saturday's] event has, of course, been labeled by the media as some sort of anti-LGBT-type rally, and it wasn't,\" Johnson said Thursday on \"The Ingraham Angle.\"\n\"We were swarmed by hundreds of Antifa militants... They were throwing water-balloons filled with urine at Christians who stood in the park and were assaulted for the high crime of worshiping Jesus in a public space,\" Johnson told Fox News host Laura Ingraham.\nAfter police reported multiple arrests at Saturday's rally, Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell's office released a statement defending the LGBTQ community and protesters while criticizing the \"far-right rally\" for provoking the violent reaction.\n\"Seattle is proud of our reputation as a welcoming, inclusive city for LGBTQ+ communities, and we stand with our trans neighbors when they face bigotry and injustice,\" the statement read. \"Today\u2019s far-right rally was held here for this very reason \u2014 to provoke a reaction by promoting beliefs that are inherently opposed to our city\u2019s values, in the heart of Seattle\u2019s most prominent LGBTQ+ neighborhood.\"\nSEATTLE MAYOR ACCUSED OF LYING AFTER BLAMING CHRISTIAN RALLY FOR PARK VIOLENCE\nWhile the mayor seemed to pin blame on the Christian group, Johnson rejected the notion that the Mayday event was designed to \"provoke\" a reaction.\nWhile a portion of the rally provided a space for parents and individuals who had de-transitioned to share their testimony and highlight concerns with transgender ideology, Johnson said it was done in an \"uplifting, hopeful, God can change anything, Jesus has the power to transform your life\" way.\n\"It wasn't this Westboro Baptist, hateful rhetoric. It was people sharing a hopeful, optimistic outlook on what it looks like when God begins to work in your life,\" he told Ingraham.\nIn response to the mayor, Johnson helped organize an event at Seattle City Hall on Tuesday, which he said was met with \"similar\" opposition from protesters.\n\"Antifa was out in force. They bloodied and beat up good church people who stood in line to try to get into a rally to sing hymns and worship songs and pray for the direction of the city,\" Johnson said.\nThe pastor noted that after announcing Tuesday's rally, he was \"inundated\" with support from people beyond Christian and conservative circles who wanted to \"stand with Christians at City Hall because we believe in the First Amendment.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHarrell\u2019s press secretary, Callie Craighead, previously told Fox News Digital that Harrell \"remains steadfast in his denouncement of rhetoric from groups whose messages promote exclusion, intolerance, and undermine the dignity and rights of any community member \u2014 particularly those that are marginalized, like our LGBTQ+ community.\"\nCraighead added at the time: \"As a Christian himself, the mayor is guided by the Christian values of love and justice, and his comments have specifically addressed ideologies that are in contrast to Seattle\u2019s commitment to being a welcoming city for all. Like any faith community, Christianity is not a monolith \u2014 and many Christians throughout Seattle do not hold the beliefs expressed by the organizers of the Mayday rally.\"\nJohnson criticized Harrell's stance, arguing the Seattle mayor has \"terminated his political career by releasing those statements.\"\n\"It's a clown show with these leftist, agitator-supporting politicians who are so out of touch with a wide swath of their constituents,\" he said.\nHarrell's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment for this article.\nFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said Tuesday he had requested an investigation into allegations of \"targeted violence\" against religious groups after the rally at Seattle City Hall in response to the mayor purportedly blaming Christian activists for igniting a weekend demonstration that turned violent.\nFox News Digital's Lindsay Kornick contributed to this report."

He said his goal is to raise awareness and funding for community development in Chicago, and for underserved youth across the country.\n\"Our country has gotten away from God, our families and communities have gotten away from God, and we need a spiritual awakening in America,\" Brooks told \"Fox & Friends\" on Tuesday.\n\"That's one of the reasons why I'm walking across America, to take the hope to people across cities and suburbs and countryside to let them know that we can change things.\"\nFROM A CHICAGO ROOFTOP TO 3,000-MILE JOURNEY, HERE'S HOW I'M FIGHTING TO RESTORE AMERICA'S SOUL\nBrooks gained national attention in 2011 when he spent 94 days living on the roof of a rundown Chicago motel to protest violence and the deaths of young people in his community. The pastor aimed to raise money to demolish the abandoned motel, which he said had become a hub for drugs and crime.\nThat demonstration was a success and led to the founding of Project H.O.O.D., a non-profit aimed at helping at-risk youths escape poverty and violence. The organization\u2019s website says it provides mentorship, training, and community support to local residents.\n\"In Chicago, we've taken one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in all of America, and we've transformed it,\" said Brooks of their previous work.\nFAITH UNDER FIRE: HOW TRUMP'S 'BEAUTIFUL BILL' TARGETS CHRISTIAN EDUCATION\nNow, he wants his latest mission, dubbed the \"Walk Across America,\" to help him aid even more young people. The journey\u2019s goal is to raise $25 million in private donations to finish building Project H.O.O.D.\u2019s 90,000-square-foot Leadership and Economic Opportunity Center in Chicago, debt-free. Brooks said he aspires to spread Project H.O.O.D. throughout the country.\n\"We have a school to put in place. Our goal is to plant Project H.O.O.D. across the country,\" Brooks said.\n\"That's one of the reasons why we're walking to raise these funds. It's not just a walk about raising money, but it's a walk about raising merit.\"\nA BOLD MOVE TO RESCUE CHICAGO'S YOUTH FROM LEFTIST DEPENDENCY\nBrooks said the effort has already received support from private citizens, business leaders, and donors.\n\"We're building a 90,000-square-foot center. And that's because of the help of [the] American people and [the] Fox Network,\" he said, expressing gratitude to those who have already supported his walk.\nBrooks said he hopes his walk will teach others that faith and hard work can help people do great things.\n\"I really believe America still works,\" he said. \"When we have faith and hard work and vision activated, we can make anything happen in America.\""

      "text": "More than 3,200 came forward to follow Jesus during PDX Crusade, the first evangelistic crusade held in Portland in more than 25 years.\nHosted by Athey Creek Church, the Crusade included three free events at the Moda Center, Portland\u2019s largest indoor arena, on Saturday, August 2 at 12 p.m. and 7 p.m. and on Sunday, August 3 at 7 p.m.\nAthey Creek Senior Pastor Brett Meador delivered a gospel message of hope during each event calling attendees out of darkness and into the light.\n\u201cWe live in a town where darkness is all around us,\u201d said Meador of Portland. \u201cIf you live here, you feel it \u2013 how desperately people need to believe in Jesus that they may find hope. We need to see our town, our city and our whole country come out of the darkness and into the light.\u201d\nTo illustrate his point, Meador described the seven \u201cI Am\u201d statements Jesus declared throughout the biblical book of John, highlighting how God revealed Himself through His son.\n\u201cWe think we\u2019re hungry for delight, for satisfaction or for pleasure,\u201d Meador said after explaining how Jesus is the Bread of Life. \u201cWhen you feed your soul full of those worldly things, it only makes you hungrier.\u201d\nReferencing a 2023 TIME story, Meador explained that though more people than ever are flocking to therapy, our nation\u2019s mental illness is getting worse.\n\u201cIf our mental health system is so good, why are we spiraling?\u201d asked Meador before discussing how Jesus is the vine. \u201cSo many people try to live their lives, and they feel like they are dying, but if you are connected to the vine and abide in the vine, you will find life in Jesus.\u201d\nMore than 35,000 attended the PDX Crusade. Athey Creek hopes the events will serve as a catalyst for change across the city of Portland, which is one of the least churched cities in the nation. According to the Pew Research Center\u2019s 2023-24 Religious Landscape Study, the Portland-Vancouver region is the only place in America where non-religious individuals outnumber Christians.\n\u201cI believe the Lord\u2019s doing a great work in Portland, and it\u2019s evident here tonight,\u201d Meador said. \u201cBut we have more work to do and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important for us to declare that He is the light of the world.\u201d\nAthey Creek has been in the Portland area for nearly three decades and is committed to teaching through the Bible verse-by-verse. The church has three campuses across the Portland area, five live weekend worship services, a weekly Wednesday night Bible study, watch parties in local communities around the world and a national radio program titled Today\u2019s Word Radio.\nMore than 3,900 volunteers from Athey Creek worked to make the PDX Crusade events run smoothly. In addition to Meador\u2019s message, worship artists CAIN, TAYA, Kari Jobe and Cody Carnes, Anne Wilson, Chris Tomlin and Zach Williams performed.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like the sound of the people of God singing the praises of God in the presence of God,\u201d said Tomlin. \u201cIt\u2019s the greatest sound on the earth and what we just did \u2013 singing to God \u2013 ought to be different than just singing a song, because we\u2019re singing to a living God.\u201d\nFor more information about PDX Crusade, visit pdxcrusade.com.\nAbout Athey Creek Church\nAthey Creek is a church with a simple focus: to point to Jesus in all it does.

      "text": "3,200+ Say 'Yes' to Jesus in Portland as 35,000+ Attend Rare PDX Gospel Rally\nThousands of people made decisions to follow Jesus Christ at a massive evangelistic rally held recently in Portland, Oregon.\nMore than 35,000 people attended the PDX Crusade, which was organized by Athey Creek Church, and the organizers report that more than 3,200 responded by saying \"yes\" to the good news of God's offer of salvation and new life in Him.\n\"PDX Crusade 2025 was a life-changing weekend. So many met Jesus, and His name was magnified across our city,\" the church announced in a post.\nThese types of outreaches are so uncommon in Portland that KLOVE reports this was the first such \"crusade\" event in the city in more than 25 years. But the response from attendees indicates a spiritual hunger for God has been building up for years throughout \"Rose City\" and the surrounding areas.\nThe outreach was held at the Moda Center on August 2-3, and huge crowds came each night to see top Christian musicians like Chris Tomlin, Zach Williams, Cain, Taya, Anne Wilson, and Kari Jobe & Cody Carnes.\nAs Pastor Brett Meador shared the gospel during the high point of each night, a huge red, yellow, and white graphic was displayed behind him reading, \"Out of Darkness into the Light.\"\nHe shared with the crowd, \"We live in a town where darkness is all around us... If you live here, you feel it \u2013 how desperately people need to believe in Jesus that they may find hope. We need to see our town, our city and our whole country come out of the darkness and into the light.\"\nHe went on to preach from scripture that, \"Anyone who confess with their mouth and believes in their heart on the Lord Jesus Christ, the Bible tells us that you'll be saved. Your sins are forgiven. Doesn't mean that your life's gonna be perfect or rosy, but it means that you're gonna have that peace that only comes through Christ.\"\nAfter several thousand people streamed to the front, he led them in the following prayer that anyone can pray:\n\"Dear Father in Heaven, I admit that I'm a sinner. I want to come out of the darkness and into Your light. So I believe in Your Son Jesus Christ. I believe that He died on the cross for my sins, that He rose up from the grave, and that I'm forgiven. Help me to walk with You. Thank You for saving me, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\"\nThe PDX Crusade reports on its Instagram page:\n\"We're overwhelmed by God's goodness and the number of people who gave their lives to Christ. Thank you for being part of what the Lord is doing in our city!\nTherefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. - 2 Corinthians 5:17\nTo God be ALL the glory!\"\nParents are reporting the powerful impact the event had on their kids. One mom wrote on Instagram, \"All the glory to King Jesus! My 7 year old son was one of the people who went down and 'gave his heart and life to the Lord' his words and on his own volition. Eternally grateful\"\nThe PDX Crusade posted a response from one young woman who declared, \"i got saved tonight and it was the best choice i have ever made!\" Her mother replied directly to the post, saying, \"That's my girl! Love you Maemae! Mom is so proud of the young woman you are becoming!\"\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\nThe church and its outreach team were well-prepared for the gospel response, reportedly giving out Bibles to each person who made a commitment to follow Jesus. One woman who served on the response team explained on social media, \"All the people who came forward to accept Christ were asked to fill out a questionnaire to help them plug into a church that is local to them.\"\nShe says that while the official stats so far indicate 3,200 salvations, there's one reason why the number might actually be higher.\n\"I was on the floor for all three services and most of the people I talked and prayed for filled it out (the questionnaire) but there were some that weren't comfortable with that, so the number of new believers might be a little higher,\" she said.\nBuild a Christ-centered home and grow together in faith with this free 8-day devotional guide filled with Scripture, reflection, and prayer.

      "text": "Thousands of Christians gathered outdoors in Portland on Saturday to sing spiritual music amid the state\u2019s coronavirus social distancing measures\u2014just hours before a riot was declared across town and a separate crowd lit fire to the city police union headquarters.\nWorshippers met in Waterfront Park on Saturday evening for an event dubbed \u201cRiots to Revival.\u201d Controversial Christian musician Sean Feucht, who has hosted similar gatherings on California beaches amid COVID-19 restrictions, led the crowd in song and some were even baptized. Most people flouted social distancing and did not wear masks or facial coverings, KGW reported.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to share with you some good news from Portland. Last night, we gathered thousands of people that came together,\u201d Feucht told \u201cFox & Friends Weekend\u201d Sunday morning.\n'LET US WORSHIP' FOUNDER CALLS OUT CALIFORNIA LEADERS' CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN HYPOCRISY\n\u201cWhite, Black, Hispanic \u2013 we came and released our song of hope over this city. People gave their life to Jesus. Hundreds of people -- We baptized people in the river behind us. There was so much joy that took over the streets of that city last night.\"\nFeucht estimated between 4,000 and 7,000 people attended the massive outdoor church service that happened just blocks away from the federal courthouse and acted as a counter-protest to bring worship, prayer, and acts of kindness to Portland. Only 600 people responded to a Facebook event to say they would attend.\nVideos showed a large, close-knit crowd of people with their arms raised in praise. The city has seen more than two months of violence in the wake of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25.\n\u201cOur tagline last night was \u2018Riots to Revival,\u2019 which we\u2019re carrying with us into Seattle tonight. We just believe that the church has the ability to change the narrative. All of America has just seen these buildings burning, and they\u2019ve seen this destruction and this violence, and the mainstream media seems to be infatuated with this. But what I\u2019m telling you is that there\u2019s another story of what God is doing in these cities and the church is rising up,\u201d Feucht told Fox News\u2019 Pete Hegseth.\nA worship leader and founder of \"Hold the Line\u201d ministries, Feucht has been hosting \"Let Us Worship\" protests across California to encourage Christians to become more involved in politics and fight against the \u201cdouble standard\u201d seen in coronavirus restrictions.\nUnder Oregon Gov. Kate Brown\u2019s latest executive order, faith-based gatherings are capped at 50 people for both indoor and outdoor services and require sanitization and social distancing, according to the Multnomah County website.\nAbout 5 miles away, a large crowd marched to the Portland Police Association office late Saturday, erected a fence, pushed dumpsters into the street to block traffic, set a dumpster on fire, vandalized the building with spray paint, and destroyed security cameras. The Portland Police Bureau declared a riot at 11:35 p.m. when people broke a window to gain access to the building and started a fire inside.\nOfficers with the Oregon State Police and Portland Police Bureau warned all people, including press and lawful observers, to disperse or be subject to arrest, citation, or impact munitions. Police said a \u201chostile crowd\u201d threw glass bottles and paint balloons and shined green lasers at officers. Three officers were injured, two of whom were transported to the hospital and released. Several people were arrested.\nBefore the violence broke out, hundreds gathered at rallies across the city in Peninsula, Laurelhurst, and Berrydale parks. Gatherings this week have been noticeably smaller than the crowds of thousands who turned out nightly for about two weeks in July to protest the presence of federal agents sent by the Trump administration to protect the federal courthouse and other properties downtown.\nDemocratic leadership in the city and state blamed the Trump administration for escalating tensions, and federal agents left Portland last week after Homeland Security reached a deal with Oregon State Police. But protesters had clashed with the Portland Police Bureau for weeks prior when demonstrations reached the city first on May 29.\nLast week, Mayor Ted Wheeler warned protesters against \u201cattempting to commit murder\" by continuing the violence after federal officers already left the city, claiming they would be just \u201ccreating B-roll film\u201d to be used in President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign ads.\n\u201cWhen you commit arson with an accelerant in an attempt to burn down a building that is occupied by people who you have intentionally trapped inside, you are not demonstrating, you are attempting to commit murder,\" Wheeler said in a news conference Thursday with Portland Police Chief Chuck Lovell.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Don\u2019t think for a moment that if you are participating in this activity, you are not being a prop for the reelection campaign of Donald Trump \u2014 because you absolutely are,\" he said. \"You are creating the B-roll film that will be used in ads nationally to help Donald Trump during this campaign. If you don\u2019t want to be part of that, then don\u2019t show up.\u201d\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."
