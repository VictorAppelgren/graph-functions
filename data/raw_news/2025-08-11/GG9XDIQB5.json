The capital stack includes $78.9 million in senior debt provided by Kayne Anderson and $12.5 million in mezzanine financing from SteepRock Capital on behalf of the sponsor, Roers Companies.\n\nVintana at Vanderbilt, located at 3375 Vanderbilt Beach Road, is adjacent to the Ritz-Carlton golf course and within a short drive of renowned Naples beaches. The Karlyn, at 7576 Immokalee Road, is also near the Gulf Coast shoreline. Both projects are slated for completion in 2027 and will feature high-end finishes and resort-style amenities.\n\n\"The financing package demonstrates that lenders remain eager to aggressively pursue Florida multifamily projects when strong sponsorship is combined with a compelling submarket story,\" said Sefcik. \"Ranked as the No. 1 place to live in the United States, Naples has high barriers to entry, stringent zoning regulations and limited availability of multifamily-zoned sites.\"\n\nAbout Marcus & Millichap Capital Corporation\n\nMarcus & Millichap Capital Corporation (MMCC) is a subsidiary of Marcus & Millichap (NYSE:MMI), a leading commercial real estate investment services firm with offices throughout the United States and Canada.
