  "content": "AMBER Davies has let rip at a \"selfish\" audience member who \"ruined\" her recent theatre performance.\n\nThe Love Island alum, 26, has carved out a hugely successful career on the stage following her time on the ITV2 matchmaking series.\n\nThe Welsh lass is currently starring in The Great Gatsby Musical in London until the show wraps at the London Coliseum next month.\n\nYet after the first act of the action-packed show, which is based on the F Scott Fitzgerald tome, Amber took to her social media page in a furious rant.\n\nStill in-character and donning a auburn-coloured wig, she issued a warning on Instagram.\n\nIt came after she spotted an audience member filming from her seat and she added the text: \"Stop filming shows, stop being selfish,\" on her slide.\n\nAmber then spoke direct to camera and said: \"This is a PSA. The closer you are to the stage when you're watching a show the more obvious it is when you're filming.\n\n\"This is the entire stalls. If you're filming in the stalls we can see you!\n\n\"From someone who's on stage, I just wanna tell you a little bit about what we see.\n\n\"So we see like a dark canvas and outlines of people's heads.\n\n\"If you're filming, the reflection from the lights bounce straight back off your \u2026 the back of your iPhone onto us on stage. So it is the one thing we can see.\"\n\nTalking about one song in particular, she continued: \"So to the woman filming New Money tonight - you distracted absolutely everybody on that stage.\n\n\"And not only that, it takes us out of the Gatsby world because you're filming and you've basically ruined that moment for everybody else who was watching the show tonight.\"\n\nAmber, who won Love Island, added in an emotional plea: \"Please don't be selfish. Stop filming shows.\n\n\"If someone is filming during a show know that this is the consequences that it has to the people on stage and tell them to stop because honestly it's annoying.\n\n\"Also, I single-handedly will count how many seats back you are and tell our stage manager where you're sitting and what colour hair you've got, and trust me, in the interval they will come and ask you to delete the footage so you've basically done it for nothing.\n\n\"Okay, I'm gonna enjoy act two now.\"\n\nPreviously, Amber - who was crowned winners of Love Island with ex Kem Cetinay - played the role of Vivian Ward in Pretty Woman: The Musical UK.\n\nShe has also starred in 9 to 5 alongside Dolly Parton, Bring It On, and Back to the Future.\n\nDuring the latter West End show, she met now-partner Ben Joyce.\n\nPrior to her stint on Love Island, Amber identified herself as a dancer.\n\nShe had experience working as an entertainer in London's circus-themed club night, Cirque Le Soir\u2014the same venue where Love Island's 2016 winner, Cara de la Hoyde, performed before her time on the show.",
