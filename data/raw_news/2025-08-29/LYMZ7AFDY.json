  "content": "NEW YORK, Aug 29 (Reuters) - A U.S. labor market report late next week will give a crucial read into the economy's health and test investors' confidence that interest rate cuts are coming soon, a view that has helped lift U.S. equities to record-high levels.\n\nLast month's release of surprisingly weak U.S. payrolls data raised expectations that the Federal Reserve will start cutting rates again at its next meeting in September, as the central bank moves to support the labor market despite inflation worries.\n\nA soft August employment report next Friday could raise concerns about a slowing economy, but it also might lead the market to price in more aggressive cuts, said Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions.\n\n\"Lower rates probably trump a modestly slowing labor market, and that probably puts a floor underneath the economy and ... the stock market.\"\n\nU.S. equities have charged higher since hitting their lows for the year in April. Investors have shaken off concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs would send the economy into a recession, while a wide swath of tech and other stocks have benefited from optimism about the business potential of artificial intelligence.\n\nDespite a modestly disappointing earnings report this week from market heavyweight and AI bellwether Nvidia  (NVDA.O) , the benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX) ended on Thursday at record highs. The index was on track to finish the traditionally challenging month of August up over 2%, pushing its year-to-date gain up to more than 10%.\n\nStill, markets remain in a historically treacherous patch on the calendar. Over the past 35 years, September has ranked as the worst-performing month of the year for the S&P 500, with an average decline of 0.8% during that period, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. The index has fallen 18 of 35 times in September, the only month to have been down more than up in that period, according to the Almanac.\n\nThe jobs report is September's first major economic release. Employment in August is expected to have climbed by 78,000 jobs, according to a Reuters poll. In the prior month's report, nonfarm payrolls grew by 73,000, a surprisingly weak number compounded by sharp downward revisions to growth in the prior two months.\n\nAlex Grassino, global chief economist and head of macro strategy at Manulife Investment Management, said he expects components of the jobs report, such as the unemployment rate and hourly earnings, \"to point to basically the same message, which is the U.S. labor market has cooled.\"\n\nThe weak July report raised market expectations that the Fed would cut rates at its next meeting in September, bets that firmed after Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently said job market risks were rising.\n\nFed funds futures as of Thursday suggested an 89% chance the central bank will reduce rates by 25 basis points at its September 16-17 meeting, LSEG data showed.\n\n\"It would take very broad-based strength in the report in order to get the Fed to rethink the idea of moving rates lower,\" Drew Matus, chief market strategist at MetLife Investment Management said, adding the odds such a report are \"pretty low.\"\n\n\"We could see an OK report, and an OK report isn't going to dissuade the Fed from cutting,\" Matus said.\n\nWhile a September cut may be close to locked in, the jobs data also could sway expectations about the amount of easing in the months ahead. Fed funds futures suggest about 55 basis points, or just over two standard cuts, are expected by December.\n\nOther developments at the Fed will also be in focus for the market in the coming week, after Trump moved to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook as he seeks to reshape the central bank's board. Cook filed a lawsuit on Thursday , claiming Trump has no power to remove her from office.\n\nThe controversy has reignited concerns over the Fed's credibility and its ability to conduct monetary policy free of political pressure, after Trump for months railed against the Fed and Powell specifically for not lowering rates to the extent he wants.\n\nWhile the situation has ramped up speculation in capital markets around Fed independence, those risks are probably appropriately priced in, for now, Grassino said.\n\n\"A lot of things that traditional market participants would have taken as a given are being questioned,\" he said. \"So as they are coming up, you are widening out the tail risks that you could potentially see.\"",

The Trust Principles imposed obligations on Reuters and its employees to act at all times with integrity, independence, and freedom from bias.\nReuters Directors and shareholders were determined to protect and preserve the Trust Principles when Reuters became a publicly traded company on the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. A unique structure was put in place to achieve this. A new company was formed and given the name 'Reuters Founders Share Company Limited', its purpose being to hold a 'Founders Share' in Reuters.\nThe legal structure has evolved over time and the Founders Share and other contractual arrangements now confer a number of special rights upon the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company. For example, (i) the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company has enhanced voting rights in circumstances where someone is seeking to obtain a significant shareholding in, or acquire control of, Thomson Reuters and (ii) the prior consent of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company must be sought prior to undertaking any sale of, or other material transaction involving, the Reuters news business unit.\nThomson Reuters itself is obliged and committed to apply the Trust Principles to its operations.

The Trustees are selected by a nomination committee and proposed to the board of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company for appointment. The nomination committee assists in scrutinizing candidates\u2019 suitability and its members include two persons appointed by the chairman after consultation with the European Court of Human Rights and representatives of certain press associations. The Thomson Reuters Corporation board has two representatives on the nomination committee. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company Board are members of the nomination committee, and the Chairman appoints three other directors of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company as members of the nomination committee. The Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company acts as chairman of the nomination committee.\nThe number of Trustees has to be at least 14 and not more than 18. Trustees have a minimum of two meetings per year, and receive reports on our activities in the different fields in which we operate (including Reuters news). The Trustees meet with both the Thomson Reuters Board and representatives of senior management.

  "argos_summary": "The upcoming U.S. August jobs report is expected to influence expectations of Fed rate cuts, with market sentiment already pricing in a 25\u2011bp cut in September and 55\u2011bp easing by December. Strong equity gains have lifted the S&P 500 to record highs, buoyed by AI optimism, while the Fed\u2019s political turbulence over Governor Cook\u2019s removal has raised concerns about central\u2011bank independence. Investors weigh a potentially softer labor market against the possibility of aggressive rate cuts, which could support the economy and the stock market. The market remains cautious given September\u2019s historical weakness for the S&P 500.",
