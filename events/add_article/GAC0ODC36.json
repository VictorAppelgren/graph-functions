      "summary": "The U.S. has seen a sharp decline in immigrant labor, with 1.2 million immigrants leaving the workforce from January to June 2025, driven by aggressive ICE enforcement and Trump‑era deportation policies. The loss disproportionately affects sectors reliant on immigrant workers—restaurants, construction, farming—while also coinciding with higher unemployment among Black Americans and a net exit of 338,000 women from the labor force. Meanwhile, men have entered the workforce in net gains. These shifts signal potential labor shortages and broader economic impacts as the U.S. grapples with a shrinking immigrant population and changing demographic participation.",
