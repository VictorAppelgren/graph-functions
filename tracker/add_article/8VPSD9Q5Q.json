      "title": "Faster Social Security disability claims now cover 300 serious conditions",
      "summary": "The Social Security Administration announced that it will add 13 new diseases and conditions to its Compassionate Allowances list, expanding the expedited benefits process to roughly 300 serious conditions. Since the program began in 2008, more than 1.1 million people with severe disabilities have received faster approvals. The update is part of the SSA’s effort to make disability determinations more responsive, though critics note that broader cuts to Social Security staff and related programs may undermine these gains. The article also briefly mentions a rare atmospheric‑river rain event in Oregon, a tuberculosis case at a Santa Paula elementary school, and unrelated coverage of a Grateful Dead‑themed Oregon football game, but these are not directly related to the SSA news.",
