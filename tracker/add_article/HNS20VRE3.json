      "title": "US seeks to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he refused plea offer in his smuggling case",
      "summary": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran construction worker, was mistakenly deported to a notorious El Salvador prison in March 2024 despite a 2019 immigration judge’s order protecting him from return to his home country. After a Supreme Court order and mounting pressure, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, where he faces federal human‑smuggling charges stemming from a 2022 traffic stop. His attorneys argue the charges are a pretext to justify another deportation, while federal judges have ordered that he not be immediately taken into ICE custody if released and have granted him a 30‑day stay of release to allow time for legal review. The case has become a flashpoint in the debate over Trump’s immigration policies, with his wife suing the administration and the government citing alleged gang ties to justify potential deportation to a third country such as Mexico or South Sudan.",
