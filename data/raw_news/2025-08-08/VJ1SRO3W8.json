  "content": "The Trump administration is opening a new front in its battle with Harvard University on the issue of patents, marking a new escalation with the elite school that could result in the loss of additional federal funding or intellectual property rights.\n\nIn a Friday letter to Harvard President Alan Garber obtained by CNN, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick writes that the Trump administration believes the university is \u201cin breach of the statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements tied to Harvard\u2019s federal funded research programs and intellectual property arising therefrom, including patents.\u201d\n\nThe Commerce Department, Lutnick said, is issuing an \u201cimmediate comprehensive review\u201d of Harvard\u2019s federally funded research programs.\n\nThe secretary said the administration was also initiating the \u201cmarch-in\u201d process under a law called the Bayh-Dole Act that lets universities patent research and inventions. That means that if Harvard has failed to disclose or patent its inventions, the federal government could take ownership of the patents or grant third-party licenses.\n\nThe letter, first reported by Reuters, marks the latest action by the Trump administration to exert pressure on the school. The Trump administration has frozen billions of dollars in federal funding for research and has targeted the school\u2019s ability to host international students. Harvard and the Trump administration are currently embroiled in a pair of lawsuits.\n\nStill, officials remain optimistic about the prospects of a deal with Harvard to restore funding to the school and drop lawsuits and investigations. The Trump administration has recently struck multimillion-dollar agreements with Columbia and Brown universities.\n\n\u201cWhile there\u2019s a lawsuit pending with Harvard, and I\u2019m sure that lawsuit will play out, I do hope that Harvard will continue to come to the table with negotiations. Those talks are continuing, and we\u2019d like to have a resolution there, outside of the courts,\u201d Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a phone interview with CNN last month.\n\nHarvard has sent some signals it is willing to work with the Trump administration, including last month when The Harvard Crimson reported that websites for Harvard College centers serving minority and LGBTQ students and women disappeared. The White House welcomed that development, viewing it as a goodwill gesture that one official described as \u201cgood news.\u201d McMahon last month also pointed to the departure of the heads of the university\u2019s Middle Eastern Studies center as a positive step.",

      "text": "Columbia University announced on Wednesday that it has reached a deal with the Trump administration following months of negotiation to restore federal funding to the school, in a move described by the administration as a \u201cseismic shift\u201d in its fight with elite higher education.\nUnder the terms of the deal to resolve several federal probes into allegations that it had violated anti-discrimination laws, Columbia did not admit to wrongdoing but agreed to pay the government a $200 million settlement over three years and an additional $21 million to settle US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigations.\nIn exchange, the university said in its statement, \u201ca vast majority of the federal grants which were terminated or paused in March 2025 \u2014 will be reinstated and Columbia\u2019s access to billions of dollars in current and future grants will be restored.\u201d\nColumbia said the agreement also codifies policy changes it announced in March following the revocation of $400 million in federal funding over campus protests, including restrictions on demonstrations, new disciplinary procedures and immediately reviewing its Middle East curriculum.\n\u201cWhile Columbia does not admit to wrongdoing with this resolution agreement, the institution\u2019s leaders have recognized, repeatedly, that Jewish students and faculty have experienced painful, unacceptable incidents, and that reform was and is needed,\u201d the university said.\nAn independent monitor will oversee the agreement\u2019s implementation.\n\u201cThe settlement was carefully crafted to protect the values that define us and allow our essential research partnership with the federal government to get back on track,\u201d acting university President Claire Shipman said in a statement. \u201cImportantly, it safeguards our independence, a critical condition for academic excellence and scholarly exploration, work that is vital to the public interest.\u201d\nStill, the university has agreed to provide the Trump administration with access to \u201call relevant data and information to rigorously assess compliance with its commitment to merit-based hiring and admissions,\u201d a senior White House official said.\nThe agreement, the official added, \u201cmandates a comprehensive review of Columbia\u2019s portfolio of programs in regional areas, starting with those relating to the Middle East.\u201d\nAnd the school agreed to review its admissions process and \u201cstrengthen oversight of international students,\u201d according to the official. Columbia will \u201cassess applicants\u2019 reasons for wishing to study in the U.S., sharing relevant data with the Federal Government,\u201d the official said.\nPresident Donald Trump celebrated the agreement in a post on Truth Social Wednesday evening, where he thanked Education Secretary Linda McMahon for her work on the deal and commended Columbia \u201cfor agreeing to do what is right.\u201d\n\u201cNumerous other Higher Education Institutions that have hurt so many, and been so unfair and unjust, and have wrongly spent federal money, much of it from our government, are upcoming,\u201d he added.\nColumbia faced financial headwinds\nShipman noted in a message to the Columbia community on Wednesday evening that the financial pressures on the school extended beyond the $400 million funding freeze.\n\u201cWe have seen not only $400 million in federal grants frozen, but also the majority of our $1.3 billion a year in federal funding placed on hold. The prospect of that continuing indefinitely, along with the potential loss of top scientists, would jeopardize our status as a world-leading research institution,\u201d she said in the letter.\nIn her first interview since the deal was announced, Shipman framed the federal funding freeze as an existential threat to the university that needed to be resolved, saying finding an agreement with the White House was the \u201cresponsible path.\u201d\n\u201cThis resolution is really going to allow us to turn a page on a period of deep instability for our institution,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan Thursday.\nShipman defended the school from accusations that it capitulated to the Trump administration.\n\u201cThe narrative that paints this as a kind of binary situation, courage versus capitulation, is just wrong. It\u2019s too simplistic. This was a really, really complex problem, and I will argue over and over again that choosing to listen, choosing to try to solve the problem with everything that we had at stake is not capitulation. It was extraordinarily difficult,\u201d Shipman said.\nShipman said her team weighed the possibility of taking the Trump administration to court but determined that the threat of long-term damage was too severe.\n\u201cWe did carefully at that, and we saw we could have some short-term victories, but we worried we would have long term damage. For example, we could have faced the loss of any future relationship in the coming years with the federal government, and that would have effectively meant an end to the research mission we conduct as we know it,\u201d she said.\nThe acting president cast the agreement as a \u201creset\u201d for Columbia\u2019s relationship with the federal government, describing \u201cdeep deliberation and almost word-by-word negotiation\u201d with the White House over months \u2013 a process that, she said, \u201ctook longer than anticipated.\u201d\nLast month, Shipman described the financial pressures that university was facing because of the administration\u2019s campaign as \u201cincreasingly acute.\u201d\n\u201cColumbia\u2019s top scientists are facing the decimation of decades of research. Graduate students, postdocs, mid-career researchers, and established, celebrated scientists, have all had their breakthroughs lauded by the world one minute and defunded the next. We\u2019re in danger of reaching a tipping point in terms of preserving our research excellence and the work we do for humanity,\u201d Shipman said.\n\u2018Roadmap for elite universities\u2019\nThe Trump administration believes that the deal could serve as a blueprint for other schools.\nMcMahon heralded the outcome as a \u201cseismic shift in our nation\u2019s fight to hold institutions that accept American taxpayer dollars accountable for antisemitic discrimination and harassment\u201d and said the school\u2019s reforms mark \u201ca roadmap for elite universities that wish to regain the confidence of the American public by renewing their commitment to truth-seeking, merit, and civil debate.\u201d\n\u201cI believe they will ripple across the higher education sector and change the course of campus culture for years to come,\u201d McMahon said.\nElite schools like Columbia and Harvard University, among others, have faced intense pressure from the Trump administration to crack down on antisemitism on their campuses \u2013 or face the possible loss of significant federal funding. The effort is part of a broad administration push for policy changes at universities \u2013 including over Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and other initiatives \u2013 that Trump sees as a winning political issue. But it is one that raises major questions about academic freedom and the role of the federal government on college campuses.\nThe White House official touted the $21 million settlement of US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigations as \u201cthe largest employment-discrimination public settlement in almost 20 years.\u201d That money, according to the official, will \u201cresolve alleged civil rights violations against Jewish Columbia employees that occurred on its campus following the October 7, 2023, Hamas terror attacks.\u201d\nThe $200 million will go to the US Treasury, a senior administration official told CNN on Thursday.\nPressed for specifics, the official said, \u201cThis is money that is going to be sort of residing in the US Treasury, but there would need to be a specific appropriation in order to, like, spend it on something,\u201d later adding that the policy focus for the money would be on trade schools and apprenticeships.\nCNN reported last month that the administration was nearing an agreement with Columbia, and the school\u2019s board met in early July to review the terms of the deal, according to a source familiar with the process.\nThe university, which was facing an investigation into its handling of antisemitism on campus, had taken a less confrontational approach than Harvard while it sought to reach a deal, and a source familiar with the matter told CNN that the administration was more amenable to Columbia\u2019s proposed terms in behind-the-scenes negotiations. In June, the Trump administration threatened to pull the university\u2019s accreditation over policies it said violated discrimination laws, the source said.\nAsked about the state of talks, Trump told CNN earlier this month, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to probably settle with Harvard. We\u2019re going to probably settle with Columbia. They want to settle very badly. There\u2019s no rush.\u201d\nAsked how much money the settlement would entail, Trump said, \u201cA lot of money.\u201d\nA source involved in universities\u2019 response to the administration told CNN last month that the White House has been looking to strike a deal with a high-profile school.\n\u201cThey want a name-brand university to make a deal like the law firms made a deal that covers not just antisemitism and protests, but DEI and intellectual diversity,\u201d this person said at the time.\nAsked if any of the schools are inclined to make such a deal, the source said, \u201cNobody wants to be the first, but the financial pressures are getting real.\u201d\nThe settlement was met with support from the school\u2019s Hillel.\n\u201cThis announcement is an important recognition of what Jewish students and their families have expressed with increasing urgency: antisemitism at Columbia is real, and it has had a tangible impact on Jewish students\u2019 sense of safety and belonging and, in turn, their civil rights. Acknowledging this fact is essential, and along with the new path laid out by the President and Trustees, I am hopeful that today\u2019s agreement marks the beginning of real, sustained change,\u201d Brian Cohen, executive director of Columbia/Barnard Hillel, said.\nThis story has been updated with additional details."

      "text": "The US State Department is opening an investigation into Harvard University\u2019s \u201ccontinued eligibility as a sponsor for the Exchange Visitor Program,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on Wednesday, marking the Trump administration\u2019s latest escalation against the Ivy League institution.\nIt was announced amid ongoing legal challenges against the government\u2019s attempts to block the university\u2019s ability to host international students.\n\u201cThe investigation will ensure that State Department programs do not run contrary to our nation\u2019s interests,\u201d the top US diplomat said in a statement without offering further details about the investigation.\nThe Trump administration first revoked Harvard\u2019s Student and Exchange Visitor Program status in May but the decision was blocked by federal judge Allison Burroughs.\n\u201cAll sponsors participating in this program are required to fully comply with exchange visitor regulations, transparency in reporting, and a demonstrated commitment to fostering the principles of cultural exchange and mutual understanding upon which the program was founded,\u201d Rubio said in Wednesday\u2019s statement.\nThe administration has previously cited antisemitism on campus as a reason for putting the school\u2019s international student program in jeopardy, along with the claim that Harvard did not provide the government with required information about its international students.\n\u201cTo maintain their privilege to sponsor exchange visitors, sponsors must comply with all regulations, including conducting their programs in a manner that does not undermine the foreign policy objectives or compromise the national security interests of the United States,\u201d he added.\n\u201cThe American people have the right to expect their universities to uphold national security, comply with the law, and provide safe environments for all students,\u201d Rubio said.\nThe State Department investigation specifically targets people at Harvard under J-1 visas, which the university says is \u201cto bring foreign nationals as professors, researchers, specialists and students to the University.\u201d It is separate from the F-1 visa program that is strictly for students and is largely administered by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\u201cThis investigation is yet another retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard\u2019s First Amendment rights,\u201d said Harvard spokesperson Jason Newton in a statement Wednesday.\n\u201cHarvard continues to enroll and sponsor international scholars, researchers, and students, and will protect its international community and support them as they apply for U.S. visas and travel to campus this fall,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cThe University is committed to continuing to comply with the applicable Exchange Visitor Program regulations.\u201d\nThe State Department has also increased its scrutiny of student and exchange visa applicants, who are now asked to set their social media profiles to public for enhanced vetting. In a cable sent to embassies and consulates last month, officials were told they should screen such visa applicants for \u201chostile attitudes towards our citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles.\u201d\nCNN has reached out to Harvard University for a response to the announcement. In previous court filings, Harvard attorneys have said that they have provided the State Department with all student information required by law and have made efforts to deal with antisemitic activity.\nThe statement comes two days after Harvard and a government attorney squared off in federal court on a separate lawsuit, with the university saying the Trump administration violated legal procedures in freezing more than $2 million in federal grants.\nJudge Burroughs, who is also presiding over the funding case, has not said when she will make a ruling.\nThis story has been updated with additional information."

      "text": "The Trump administration has reached a multimillion-dollar agreement with Brown University to restore federal funding \u2013 its second major deal with an elite university after last week\u2019s $221 million settlement with Columbia University.\nIn return for Brown agreeing to several measures aimed at dismantling certain diversity, equity and inclusion programs, the federal government will reinstate all frozen grants from the Department of Health and Human Services, restore the school\u2019s eligibility for future funding, and close all pending investigations into the university, a White House official said.\nBut Brown, which was under financial strain even before the Trump administration began slashing research funding at a number of higher education institutions, was largely able to escape the nine-figure settlements the White House reached with Columbia and is seeking with Harvard University.\nUnder the deal announced Wednesday, the Providence-based school will pay $50 million in grants over 10 years to Rhode Island workforce development organizations, according to the White House official and Brown President Christina Paxson.\nBrown is not making \u201cany payments or fines to the federal government,\u201d Paxson said in a letter to the university community.\nThat\u2019s different from Columbia\u2019s deal, under which the school will pay $200 million to the US Treasury over three years and an additional $21 million to settle US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigations.\nPaxson touted the deal as a voluntary agreement that preserves Brown\u2019s mission, noting that it does not give the government the \u201cauthority to dictate Brown\u2019s curriculum or the content of academic speech.\u201d And supporting workforce development organizations, she said, is \u201caligned with our service and community engagement mission.\u201d Workforce development and career training programs have also been a priority for the Trump administration.\nUnder the terms of the deal, Brown has agreed to \u201cnot engage in unlawful racial discrimination in admissions or university programming\u201d and will provide the federal government access to relevant data on the matter, the White House official said. The school is also expected to adopt definitions of \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d from an executive order signed by President Donald Trump earlier this year for \u201cwomen\u2019s sports, programming, facilities, and housing.\u201d The school\u2019s health facilities \u201cwill not perform gender reassignment surgeries on minors or prescribe them puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones,\u201d and the school \u201cwill take steps to improve the campus climate for Jewish students,\u201d according to the official.\nPaxson said that most of the agreement\u2019s provisions codify existing policies and practices. However, in a nod to the pressure the school was facing, she added in her letter: \u201cThere are other aspects of the agreement that were not part of previous federal reviews of Brown policies but are priorities of the federal administration in resolving the funding freeze.\u201d\nShe noted that Brown \u201chad not previously been informed of a reason for the freeze of its federal research funding, and at no time has Brown been informed of any finding that the University violated any law.\u201d\nCNN reported earlier this year that more than half a billion dollars in grant money was on the line at Brown as the Trump administration reviewed the Ivy League university\u2019s DEI policies and its response to alleged antisemitism on campus.\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon heralded Wednesday\u2019s deal as a move to \u201c(reverse) the decades-long woke-capture of our nation\u2019s higher education institutions.\u201d\nWhite House officials had hoped Columbia\u2019s deal would serve as a blueprint for other universities, pointing to Brown and Cornell University as schools on the cusp of agreements, CNN reported earlier this week.\nAt the same time, the Trump administration has launched investigations into Duke University, Duke University School of Medicine and the Duke Law Journal.\nThe administration also remains engaged in lawsuits with Harvard, though The New York Times reported this week that the school is open to a potential half-billion-dollar settlement that could resolve ongoing legal battles."

      "text": "The Trump administration is still optimistic about the possibility of reaching a deal with Harvard University after it announced a $200 million settlement with Columbia University on Wednesday.\n\u201cWhile there\u2019s a lawsuit pending with Harvard, and I\u2019m sure that lawsuit will play out, I do hope that Harvard will continue to come to the table with negotiations. Those talks are continuing, and we\u2019d like to have a resolution there, outside of the courts,\u201d Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a phone interview with CNN on Thursday.\nHarvard faced off with the Trump administration in court on Monday, arguing that the administration\u2019s $2 billion freeze in federal funding for research was in violation of the school\u2019s First Amendment rights. The case has become a flashpoint in a major clash over academic freedom, campus oversight and federal funding. The judge has not made a final ruling in the case, but Harvard has asked for a decision to be made no later than September 3, when it says some of the funding cuts could become more permanent.\nA small circle of Trump administration officials and officials from Harvard have been engaged in talks toward a potential deal for months, but a source familiar with the discussions told CNN earlier this week those conversations have largely stalled.\nOn Thursday, McMahon pointed to some recent actions taken by Harvard as positive steps, including the departure of the heads of the Middle Eastern Studies center. She described the current state of talks with the university as \u201congoing\u201d but declined to provide additional details. She also declined to provide information about the scale of any settlement the administration hopes to achieve with Harvard, which has a larger endowment than Columbia.\nIn a statement shortly after the Columbia deal was announced, McMahon described the move as a \u201cseismic shift\u201d for higher education that could serve as a \u201croadmap\u201d for other schools. She said that \u201cother universities are already looking at\u201d the template provided by the Columbia agreement.\n\u201cColleges and universities are understanding at this particular point that they have some issues they need to address, and I think that they are coming to the table to do that,\u201d she said.\nMcMahon added that there are \u201cother investigations that are going on\u201d and that the Trump administration has sent letters to some other universities \u201cletting them know that we are investigating \u2026 but I would prefer that we will not go public with those right now.\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump indicated a deal with Harvard was within reach last month, saying in a social media post that the school had \u201cacted extremely appropriately\u201d and that a deal could be announced \u201cover the next week or so.\u201d But those talks appeared to subsequently derail.\nThe administration escalated its battle with the university days later, announcing that an investigation found the school in \u201cviolent violation\u201d of the Civil Rights Act. The administration warned in a letter in late June that a failure to immediately institute change \u201cwill result in the loss of all federal financial resources and continue to affect Harvard\u2019s relationship with the federal government.\u201d\nAnd days after that, the Department of Homeland Security sent the school administrative subpoenas regarding its Student Visitor and Exchange Program certification, seeking all relevant records, communications and other documents about Harvard\u2019s enforcement of immigration laws.\nOn Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio escalated things further \u2013 announcing the administration was opening an investigation into Harvard\u2019s \u201ccontinued eligibility as a sponsor for the Exchange Visitor Program.\u201d\nHarvard has sent some signals it is willing to work with the Trump administration, including earlier this month when The Harvard Crimson reported that websites for Harvard College centers serving minority and LGBTQ students and women disappeared. The White House welcomed that development, viewing it as a goodwill gesture that one official described as \u201cgood news.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with additional information."

  "argos_summary": "The Trump administration is intensifying its conflict with Harvard University over patent and funding issues, claiming the university is in breach of federal requirements related to its research programs. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced a comprehensive review of Harvard's federally funded research and initiated the 'march-in' process under the Bayh-Dole Act, which could allow the government to take ownership of patents if Harvard fails to comply. Meanwhile, the administration has successfully negotiated multimillion-dollar agreements with Columbia and Brown universities to restore federal funding, with hopes that these deals could serve as a model for resolving ongoing disputes with Harvard.",
