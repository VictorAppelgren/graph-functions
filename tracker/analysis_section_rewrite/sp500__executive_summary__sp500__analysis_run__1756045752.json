      "feedback": "The draft has strong regime framing and a clear mapping of Ford/SLB/MSFT-Shopify/UNH-LULU to transmission channels, but it reads as an overlong, scattershot canvas rather than a crisp 4–6 sentence house view; tighten the narrative into a base-case with explicit catalysts, per-name triggers, and a one‑line invalidation, then attach concrete numbers from the sources to each assertion. Actions: compress to 4–6 sentences or a tight 6–8 bullet-structure, starting with a single base-case house view (which names are overweight/neutral/underweight and why) and then listing 2–3 catalysts, 2–3 watch items, and 1–2 invalidation triggers; per name, anchor the claim to a numeric lever drawn from the sources (e.g., Ford ~5% yield and forward P/E ~10.3x; SLB 65% shareholder-yield signal; MSFT Azure growth 39% with ~0.7% forward yield and 33.6% payout; Shopify GMV ~$163B, rev ~$5.0B with ~30%+ growth; UNH FCF yield >9% and LULU cash ~$1.3B with no debt); ensure every assertion cites a source ID and remove placeholders (e.g., any 65X? IDs) and duplicate/low-signal references. Redraft the section so the four-p pillar logic (Macro/Policy, Platform/Flows, Valuation/Technicals, Regime Signals) supports a single coherent causal chain: inflation normalization lifts discount rates, platform breadth/AI monetization sustains cash flow and modest multiple support, while rate/tariff shocks inject calibration risk; then present a crisp watch list with explicit thresholds (e.g., AI capex momentum, Shopify GMV change, breadth signals from ballast ETFs) and clear invalidation so the team can react in real time. Finally, replace the alt-two hedges and extraneous macro detours with a single, executable set of scenarios (base, upside, downside) tied to regime-shift triggers and a clean, executive-summary tone; ensure the output is 4–6 sentences or bullets and that all critical sources (W2622L6WW; 5S9GJV2O3; IGP1Q4ZEJ; HWGNUP2XG; 65UUBU0OR; 48JXC9VDP; QGXA2WQJ3; NBX9RA9WX; 19NO2GMNF; Q7VVGNSQE; YX2J8NHZ1; 2YP1X9B4T; 4661GWFP7) are consistently used to support the claims.",
