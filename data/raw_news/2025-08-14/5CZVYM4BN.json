Generate Key Takeaways\n\nGuitarist, songwriter and singer Molly Tuttle has become one of bluegrass music\u2019s most respected artists, building her reputation over the years through performances with family band The Tuttles With AJ Lee, solo projects, and her work with Golden Highway (a nod to Tuttle\u2019s California roots). She was also the first woman to win the IBMA\u2019s guitar player of the year award.\n\nTuttle credits the success of her Grammy-winning albums with Golden Highway\u2014Crooked Tree (2022) and City of Gold (2023)\u2014with helping her \u201cgain that confidence and help me take a risk with my sound,\u201d she tells Billboard.\n\u2022 None 'The City Loves Him': Inside MGK's Emotional Homecoming, As Cleveland Celebrates MGK Day and His 'Lost Americana' Album\n\u2022 None For Artists Like Sombr and Gigi Perez, Self-Producing Is 'An Experiment and an Adventure'\n\nHer new solo album, So Long Little Miss Sunshine, out Friday (Aug. 15) on Nonesuch, is the result of that risk-taking \u2014 and marks a radical stylistic evolution from her earlier bluegrass-oriented work. The 12-song album is built on a bedrock of folk-pop, country and rock, while still folding in dashes of bluegrass.\n\n\u201cWhen we finished the record and I heard it all, I was like, \u2018This has Sheryl Crow vibes and I love it.\u2019 She\u2019s my hero,\u201d Tuttle says.\n\nOver the past five years, in between playing more than 100 shows per year with Golden Highway, making her previous two projects (in addition to her solo 2024 EP Into the Wild) and seeing Crooked Tree win the IBMA\u2019s album of the year award, Tuttle was culling songs that landed outside her usual purview. She wrote many of the songs on the new album with her partner, Old Crow Medicine Show\u2019s Ketch Secor.\n\n\u201cBluegrass is the music I grew up with and that\u2019s such a kind of defined format to me. You can push boundaries, but you are still kind of writing within this established genre,\u201d she says. \u201cI so often write songs that don\u2019t really fit into any specific style of music. I\u2019ve gravitated towards this sound that is a little less defined and that made it scarier to make this album.\u201d\n\nAt the suggestion of manager Ken Levitan, Tuttle began sending songs to producer Jay Joyce, known for his work with Cage the Elephant, Miranda Lambert and Eric Church.\n\n\u201cKen felt he would have cool ideas for pushing my guitar playing in new directions,\u201d she says. \u201cJay was great about that. He was like, \u2018There are going to be a lot of guitar solos on this album.\u2019 I feel like with me, when we are making a record, usually the solos are being passed around in the bluegrass world, a collaborative approach which is also really cool. But with this, it was also challenging when you\u2019re taking longer guitar solos and playing throughout the whole record. You have to spend more time on it and make sure they have an arc of their own.\u201d\n\nTuttle and Joyce recorded the album last fall at Joyce\u2019s Neon Cross studio in East Nashville, along with drummer/percussionists Jay Bellerose and Fred Eltringham, bassist Byron House and Secor on banjo, fiddle, harmonica, and vocal harmonies.\n\n\u201cWe had the drums in the isolation room, so it didn\u2019t bleed into everything, but otherwise, we were all sitting there in the control room,\u201d Tuttle says. \u201cUsually when you\u2019re in a studio, the musicians are on one side and the producer and engineers are on the other, but his studio is cool because the console and everything is in the middle, and we just sat around it. You\u2019re all in this big space together.\u201d\n\nThe album opens with the stormy \u201cEverything Burns.\u201d \u201cWe decided to start things off with a big guitar moment, to kind of set the tone,\u201d Tuttle says. \u201cIt\u2019s still going to have that throughline of my guitar playing and it\u2019s a singer-songwriter record, but it\u2019s also a guitar record. The song kind of takes people by surprise. It\u2019s one of the moodiest songs on the record, but it gets happier after that.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the album brightens throughout the following 11 songs, including the pop-fueled \u201cThat\u2019s Gonna Leave a Mark,\u201d the sunny \u201cSummer of Love,\u201d and a cover of Icona Pop and Charli XCX\u2019s 2012 hit \u201cI Love It.\u201d Elsewhere, songs such as \u201cNo Regrets\u201d and \u201cGolden State of Mind\u201d delve into the emotional maturity and acceptance that come as the years progress.\n\nHer guitar-playing is as self-assured and precise as ever. Tuttle also plays banjo on \u201cNo Regrets\u201d and album closer \u201cStory of My So-Called Life,\u201d something she hasn\u2019t done on her records since she was a teenager.\n\n\u201cStory of My So-Called Life\u201d traces her journey from attending Boston\u2019s Berklee College of Music to chasing her musical dreams. \u201cOld Me (New Wig)\u201d finds her opening up about moving away from habits and thoughts that aren\u2019t self-beneficial.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little tongue-in-cheek,\u201d she admits. \u201cWe thought we were just writing your kind of a breakup song, but we got to the chorus and we suddenly realized, \u2018Maybe this is about breaking up with an old version of yourself that isn\u2019t really serving you anymore\u2013your insecurities or bad habits or anything that you need to leave behind. It\u2019s probably my favorite of the new songs to play because I have people in the audience coming up to me and being like, \u2018I have things that I\u2019m struggling with or trying to leave in the past.\u2019 It was just fun to come up with the line, \u2018I got a new wig to get you out of my hair.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s cover artwork also plays into that idea, featuring photos of Tuttle in an array of wigs\u2014and one photo with no wig\u2014with each photo tying in with a song on the album. A blonde wig with a braid links to a line from the song \u201cRosalee,\u201d while a dark wig represents \u201cEverything Burns.\u201d But the center photo showcases a bald Tuttle staring straight ahead at the camera. It\u2019s a bold, confident statement for the singer-songwriter, who lost her hair when she was three due to the autoimmune condition alopecia areata.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice for me because I feel like I can just have fun with it and not constantly have to explain and have people feel sorry for me,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t have hair. It\u2019s just grown into something that is part of my creative expression, wearing different wigs and stuff like that. And that\u2019s taken me a long time to get to that point. So, it was fun to kind of celebrate that on the new album cover.\u201d\n\nThe cover was inspired by Tuttle\u2019s work with Ringo Starr on his country-inflected album, Look Up, earlier this year, with Tuttle taking a nod from the cover of the Beatles\u2019 1970 classic Let It Be.\n\n\u201cThat album just had these four squares of each member\u2019s face. At first, I thought about wearing maybe four different wigs, then it turned into nine. It was an ambitious photo shoot and it took 12 hours to get all of them shot, but I loved how it turned out.\u201d\n\nThe new album isn\u2019t the only major musical shift Tuttle has made this year. Golden Highway, which also included bassist Shelby Means, banjoist Kyle Tuttle (no relation), fiddle player Bronwyn Keith-Hynes and mandolin player Dominick Leslie, disbanded earlier this year to focus on solo initiatives and other pursuits. Keith-Hynes, Means and Kyle Tuttle each launched solo projects over the past year.\n\n\u201cIt felt like a good time to put the brakes on for all of us,\u201d Tuttle says of the group\u2019s dissolvement.\n\nTuttle formed a new outfit for her current tour dates, which include summer festival shows and this fall\u2019s The Highway Knows Tour. The new group features drummer Megan Jane, bassist Vanessa McGowan, multi-instrumentalist Ellen Angelico and guitar/mandolin player Mary Meyer. They played their first show together at New York\u2019s Mercy Lounge in May.\n\nBut Tuttle doesn\u2019t rule out a Golden Highway reunion. \u201cMy hope is that we\u2019ll get together again and play more shows in the future whenever everyone wants to,\u201d Tuttle says. \u201cI think when we do get back together, it\u2019ll be with a schedule that works for everyone. I\u2019m hopeful that it\u2019s just kind of goodbye for now and we\u2019ll be back.\u201d\n\u2022 None Chart Rewind: In 1989, New Kids on the Block Were 'Hangin' Tough' at No. 1\n\u2022 None H.E.R. & Chris Brown 'Come Through' to No. 1 on Adult R&B Airplay Chart\n\nSign up for Billboard's Newsletter.

      "text": "Janet Jackson\u2019s Biggest Billboard Hot 100 Hits\nHere's a look at the pop icon's history on the chart.\nAs Janet Jackson celebrates her birthday (May 16), Billboard takes a look at the singer\u2019s history on the Billboard Hot 100.\nBorn as the youngest of 10 children to Joseph and Katherine Jackson, Janet was almost pre-destined to enter the music industry with her brothers and sisters. By her fifth birthday, five of her brothers \u2014 as The Jackson 5 \u2014 had already scored four Hot 100 No. 1 hits. Following in her family\u2019s musical footsteps, Janet made her Hot 100 debut in 1982 with \u201cYoung Love,\u201d at 16 years old. Though that single and her second career entry, 1984\u2019s \u201cCome Give Your Love to Me,\u201d both peaked outside the top 50, Jackson found her hit-making stride with 1986\u2019s Control. Among its many hits, she landed her first of 10 No. 1s on the chart with \u201cWhen I Think of You,\u201d which reigned for two weeks.\nThrough the next 15 years, Jackson remained a Hot 100 force: Her next four albums, Janet Jackson\u2019s Rhythm Nation 1814, janet., The Velvet Rope and All for You, each all generated at least one Hot 100 champ. Thanks to her decades of hits, Jackson is one of the most influential female artists to cross through the pop, R&B and dance genres, with 19 and 15 No. 1s on the Dance Club Songs and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts, respectively. She\u2019s also scored seven No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200, between 1986 and 2015.\nJackson (who first broke through with TV roles on sitcoms Good Times and Diff\u2019rent Strokes) has won five Grammy Awards and has been nominated for both an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award. She was honored as the first-ever MTV Icon Award recipient in 2001 and received the MTV Video Vanguard Award in 1990.\nHere\u2019s a look at the superstar\u2019s top-performing hits on the Hot 100.\nJanet Jackson\u2019s Biggest Billboard Hot 100 Hits\n1. \u201cMiss You Much,\u201d peak position No. 1 (four weeks), peak date Oct. 7, 1989\n2. \u201cEscapade,\u201d No. 1 (three weeks), March 3, 1990\n3. \u201cThat\u2019s the Way Love Goes,\u201d No. 1 (eight weeks), May 15, 1993\n4. \u201cAll for You,\u201d No. 1 (seven weeks), April 14, 2001\n5. \u201cTogether Again,\u201d No. 1 (two weeks), Jan. 31, 1998\n6. \u201cLove Will Never Do (Without You),\u201d No. 1 (one week), Jan. 19, 1991\n7. \u201cWhen I Think of You,\u201d No. 1 (two weeks), Oct. 11, 1986\n8. \u201cAgain,\u201d No. 1 (two weeks) Dec. 11, 1993\n9. \u201cRunaway,\u201d No. 3, Oct. 21, 1995\n10. \u201cDoesn\u2019t Really Matter,\u201d No. 1 (three weeks), Aug. 26, 2000\n11. \u201cRhythm Nation,\u201d No. 2, Jan. 6, 1990\n12. \u201cAlright,\u201d No. 4, June 2, 1990\n13. \u201cControl,\u201d No. 5, Jan. 24, 1987\n14. \u201cWhat Have You Done for Me Lately,\u201d No. 4, May 17, 1986\n15. \u201cBlack Cat,\u201d No. 1 (one week), Oct. 27, 1990\n16. \u201cNasty,\u201d No. 3, July 19, 1986\n17. \u201cLet\u2019s Wait Awhile,\u201d No. 2, March 21, 1987\n18. \u201cCome Back to Me,\u201d No. 2, Aug. 18, 1990\n19. \u201cAny Time, Any Place\u201d/\u201dAnd On and On,\u201d No. 2, June 25, 1994\n20. \u201cIf,\u201d No. 4, Sept. 11, 1993\n21. \u201cWhat\u2019s It Gonna Be?!,\u201d (Busta Rhymes featuring Janet Jackson) No. 3, April 17, 1999\n22. \u201cSomeone to Call My Lover,\u201d No. 3, Sept. 1, 2001\n23. \u201cYou Want This\u201d/\u201c70\u2019s Love Groove,\u201d No. 8, Dec. 24, 1994\n24. \u201cI Get Lonely\u201d (Janet featuring BLACKstreet), No. 3, May 23, 1998\n25. \u201cScream\u201d/\u201cChildhood\u201d (with Michael Jackson), No. 5, June 17, 1995\nJanet Jackson\u2018s Biggest Billboard Hot 100 hits chart is based on actual performance on the weekly Billboard Hot 100, through the May 20, 2023, ranking.

      "text": "Chart Rewind: In 1989, New Kids on the Block Were \u2018Hangin\u2019 Tough\u2019 at No. 1\nThe Boston boy band topped the Billboard 200 and Hot 100 with its breakthrough album and the set's title cut, respectively.\nIn every era of pop music, boy bands have elicited irrepressible shrieks from adoring fans. In the \u201960s, it was the Beatles. In the \u201970s, the Jackson 5. More recently, the likes of Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC, who then passed the boy band baton to One Direction and 5 Seconds of Summer.\nIn 1989, it was New Kids on the Block\u2018s turn to rule music like only boy bands can.\nAfter Boston-based producer-songwriter Maurice Starr had formed New Edition, which reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1985 with \u201cCool It Now,\u201d he followed with New Kids on the Block \u2013 brothers Jonathan and Jordan Knight, Joey McIntyre, Donnie Wahlberg and Danny Wood. While their self-titled first LP didn\u2019t hit the Billboard 200 upon its release, follow-up Hangin\u2019 Tough filled the late-\u201980s boy band void, yielding five infectious Hot 100 top 10s, including the quintet\u2019s first No. 1 in June 1989, \u201cI\u2019ll Be Loving You (Forever).\u201d The ballad followed the No. 10-peaking \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Go Girl\u201d and the No. 3 hit \u201cYou Got It (The Right Stuff),\u201d which built even more buzz.\nOn Sept. 9, 1989, New Kids\u2019 rise culminated in the set and its title track taking over atop the Billboard 200 and Hot 100, respectively. The set was a slow-burner that took 55 weeks to reach the Billboard 200 summit, completing one of the longest climbs to No. 1 in the chart\u2019s history.\nBy years\u2019 end, New Kids on the Block had charted at last on the Billboard 200, reaching No. 25, and generated its own top 10, the group\u2019s No. 8 cover of the Delfonics\u2019 \u201cDidn\u2019t I (Blow Your Mind).\u201d The group even gleaned a top 10 from a third album, the holiday set Merry, Merry Christmas, when \u201cThis One\u2019s for the Children\u201d reached No. 7. In between, Hangin\u2019 Tough\u2018s fifth single \u201cCover Girl\u201d rose to No. 2.\n(On their summer 1989 tour, New Kids on the Block \u2013 and former Billboard publisher Tommy Page, then in his teen-idol days [he passed in 2017] \u2013 set out as the opening acts for Tiffany. By the end of the tour, Tiffany and New Kids had swapped spots.)\nThe Kids\u2019 blend of street (i.e., Wahlberg\u2019s semi-rap on \u201cHangin\u2019 Tough\u201d) and sweet (Jordan Knight and McIntyre served as the voices of the band\u2019s biggest ballads) helped make them a chart, touring and merchandise powerhouse, one that continued with 1990\u2019s Step by Step. Like its predecessor, the album and its title song became respective Billboard 200 and Hot 100 No. 1s. Follow-up single \u201cTonight,\u201d which playfully name-checks several of the act\u2019s earlier hits, rose to No. 7.\nUltimately, the group earned the honor of Billboard\u2018s top artist of both 1989 and 1990.\nAs musical trends shifted from pure-pop to rap and grunge, New Kids on the Block released the No. 37-peaking Face the Music (billed as NKOTB) in 1994 before taking a hiatus. With enough time passed for nostalgia to help restore its image (along with a return to prominence for pop music), the band blew back in 2008 with the No. 2 hit album The Block (featuring a track with then-new act Lady Gaga), which yielded the quintet\u2019s first top 40 Hot 100 hit since 1992, the No. 36-peaking \u201cSummertime.\u201d Its 2013 album 10 hit No. 6. In between, the act embraced its place in boy band lineage: In 2011, it released NKOTBSB, a collaborative set with Backstreet Boys, which hit No. 7. The acts\u2019 partnership continued in the form of Nick & Knight, aka BSB\u2019s Nick Carter and New Kid Jordan, in 2014.\nMost recently, New Kids on the Block released the album Still Kids, which launched at No. 4 on the Top Album Sales chart in June. Lead single \u201cKids\u201d has hit both the Adult Pop Airplay and Adult Contemporary charts, marking the group\u2019s first appearance on the latter list in nearly 35 years.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of not wanting to let each other down,\u201d Wahlberg said when the group chatted with Billboard in New York in May. \u201cThere\u2019s an urgency that I think you can sometimes hear in the voices, of wanting to deliver the best of a performance. I think that\u2019s present in this record, even in the writing.\u201d"

      "text": "H.E.R. & Chris Brown \u2018Come Through\u2019 to No. 1 on Adult R&B Airplay Chart\nThe new champ extends both H.E.R. and Brown's run of chart-topping success at the radio format.\nH.E.R. expands her dominance on Billboard\u2019s Adult R&B Airplay chart as \u201cCome Through,\u201d featuring Chris Brown, climbs to No. 1 on the list dated Jan. 1. The song advances from No. 3 \u2013 having previously reached No. 2 \u2013 despite a less than 1% gain in plays in the week ending Dec. 26, according to MRC Data, to become the most played song on U.S. monitored adult R&B stations. (The previous week\u2019s No. 1, Wizkid\u2019s \u201cEssence,\u201d featuring Tems, falls to No. 2 with a 9% decline in plays.)\n\u201cCome Through\u201d gives singer-songwriter H.E.R. a seventh No. 1 on Adult R&B Airplay among 10 total career entries on the chart. With the new addition, here\u2019s her updated roster:\nSong Title, Artist (if other than H.E.R.), Weeks at No. 1, Date Reached No. 1\n\u201cFocus,\u201d one week, Oct. 6, 2018\n\u201cBest Part,\u201d Daniel Caesar featuring H.E.R., four, Oct. 20, 2018\n\u201cSlow Down,\u201d with Skip Marley, three, May 23, 2020\n\u201cMake the Most,\u201d Lonr. featuring H.E.R., one, Oct. 24, 2020\n\u201cGotta Move On,\u201d Toni Braxton featuring H.E.R., two, Feb. 20, 2021\n\u201cDamage,\u201d eight, June 26, 2021\n\u201cCome Through,\u201d featuring Chris Brown, Jan. 1, 2022\nIn addition, a seventh champ pushes H.E.R. into a tie for fourth place for the most No. 1s among all artists since the chart began in 1993. Check out the current leaderboard:\n12, Alicia Keys\n11, Toni Braxton\n8, Charlie Wilson\n7, H.E.R.\n7, Kem\n7, Maxwell\n7, R. Kelly\nFor Chris Brown, meanwhile, \u201cCome Through\u201d sustains his Adult R&B Airplay success streak with a third consecutive leader. The single follows his two other champs, \u201cNo Guidance,\u201d featuring Drake, an 11-week No. 1 in 2020 and \u201cGo Crazy,\u201d with Young Thug, which reigned for seven weeks in 2020-21.\n\u201cCome Through\u201d continues the newfound radio breakthrough for Brown with adult R&B audiences. After some success with his initial 14 chart appearances from 2006-16, the hitmaker has grown into a favorite of adult R&B radio programmers and audiences in recent years. In 2019, he found his first top five success on his 15th try, with \u201cUndecided\u201d reaching No. 4 before the three No. 1s streak.\n\u201cCome Through\u201d appears on H.E.R.\u2019s debut full-length studio album, Back of My Mind. The set, released in June, debuted at No. 1 on Top R&B Albums and led for one week."
