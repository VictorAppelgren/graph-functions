  "description": "Thunder Over New Hampshire Air Show is bringing the Blue Angels to the state. Here's when they're expected to fly in.",
  "content": "The U.S. Navy Blue Angels are about to fly back into town.\n\nThe 2025 Thunder over New Hampshire Air Show returns to Pease Air National Guard Base on Sept. 6 and 7, where the six powerful F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets that fly as little as 18 inches apart are expected to entertain over 80,000 people over the weekend.\n\nBut, first they have to get to town, which means there is an early chance to get to see them in the air.\n\nWhen exactly the Blue Angels will come to town is subject to change, but event spokesman Rob Nichols said they are expected to arrive on Tuesday.\n\nBut, if you miss the arrival, there's always the show itself, which promises to be far more impressive.\n\nHow to go to the Thunder over NH Air Show\n\nAdmission to the air show at Pease Air National Guard Base, located at 302 Newmarket St. in Newington, is free. Premium covered and box seats have sold out.\n\nWhile admission is free, parking onsite requires a pass, which have sold out.\n\nBut, there are other options. People can still walk, bike to or be dropped off at the air show, and there is a nearby off-site parking area at the Mall at Fox Run in Newington, where shuttles will transport people to the air show gates. Some shuttle passes are still available both days as of Aug. 28.\n\nGates for the show open at 9 a.m. The Patriot Plaza, the aircraft on display, vendors and concessions on the runway will open about 9:30 a.m. The national anthem will be played at noon and performances begin right after that and go until about 4 p.m. both days. The gates and parking lots close at 5 p.m.\n\nWho are air show performers joining the Blue Angels at Pease?\n\nThe Blue Angels will be joined by the Marines' C-130 \u201cFat Albert,\u201d the Air Force's F-35 Lightning II Team, KC-46A Pegasus, UH-60 Blackhawk, U.S. Para Commandos, JackAces P-51 Demo, Michael Goulian, Smoke-N-Thunder Jet Car and the Third Strike Wingwalking team.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Portsmouth Herald: Blue Angels coming to NH for air show.

The plan is similar to what was used at the 2021 & 2023 air shows at Pease.\nThe show traffic and parking plan calls for the following:\n- All vehicles parking at the show will be required to obtain a free or paid parking pass online in advance at https://thunderovernewhampshire.com/\n- Because there is a limited capacity for parking and traffic ingress/egress, once all parking passes have been reserved, no additional parking will be available.\n- Parking passes will not be available for purchase at the gate. Vehicles arriving without a parking pass will not be admitted.\n- There will be a drop-off area near the south gate for guests utilizing ride-sharing services.\n- There will be handicap parking available in each of the lots. All lots are hard surface. Handicap parking will be the closest spaces to the air show entrance of the spaces in each lot. Handicap placard or plates are required to park in handicap spaces. An advance air show parking pass is also required for handicap parking (please note that there are not handicap passes separate from the other parking passes).\n*All ticket sales are final, no refunds, no rain checks.\nFollow Our Social Channels\n\u00a92025 Thunder Over New Hampshire Air Show | Site designed and maintained by HERB GILLEN ADVERTISING\n*This web site is not an official U.S. Air Force or Air National Guard production.
