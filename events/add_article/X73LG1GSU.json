      "summary": "AI talent wars in Silicon Valley highlight that Microsoft Excel remains the most cited skill in tech job listings, far outpacing Python and SQL. Despite AI’s prominence, demand for Excel experts persists because the tool is integral to managing the data that fuels AI. Companies are willing to pay up to $200,000 for machine‑learning talent and up to $1 million for top AI specialists, but even non‑technical hires can earn lucrative roles through prompt engineering. The narrative underscores that as AI matures, its real value lies in delivering accurate, contextual data directly into familiar tools like Excel.",
