  "title": "Sony ULT Field 5 Review: A Bass-Forward and Durable Bluetooth Boombox",
  "description": "Sony's ULT Field 5 speaker delivers surprisingly powerful bass for its size and comes loaded with features, including high-resolution audio codec support, customizable LED lighting, and a detachable carrying strap.",
  "content": "The Sony ULT Field 5 is essentially an upsized version of the Field 3. The two look almost identical, though the ULT Field 5 is larger at 5.7 by 12.6 by 4.9 inches (HWD) and 7.3 pounds, compared with the 4.4-by-10.1-by-3.1-inch, 2.6-pound Field 3. The Field 7 looks totally different, thanks to its cylindrical shape, and is much bigger and heavier at 8.8 by 20.2 by 8.7 inches and 13.9 pounds.\n\nThe Field 5 has a rectangular design, with a passive radiator on each end, controls on the top, and a mesh textile wrap covering the outside. It looks and feels solid. We received the Off White model for review, which looks nice, though we wish the speaker came in more colors (the only other option is Black). The passive radiators are surrounded by customizable LED lighting, however, which lends the muted tones a bit of personality. The speaker has an IP67 rating, which means it is protected from dust and dirt, and can handle brief submersion in shallow water.\n\nAll the basic controls you need are on the speaker's top surface. There are buttons to manage power, pairing, volume, and playback, in addition to the large ULT button that toggles the ULT effect between off, ULT 1, and ULT 2. The ULT 1 setting boosts the lowest bass frequencies, and the ULT 2 setting tightens things up for more punch.\n\nYou\u2019ll also find small rubber inserts on top that you can remove and flip around to expose loops for the shoulder straps. This neat design element keeps the top of the speaker flush when you\u2019re not using the strap.\n\nThe ULT Field 5 offers more connectivity than the ULT Field 3. The rear panel has a USB-C port, which can be used both for power in (charging the speaker) and power out (charging your phone). The speaker has a 3.5mm AUX port for wired input, which the Field 3 lacks.\n\nWirelessly, the speaker connects via Bluetooth 5.3 and supports Bluetooth Fast Pair and multipoint connections. It offers the Sony Party Connect feature for stereo pairing or for joining up to 100 speakers together. It doesn\u2019t support the newer AuraCast standard, however, which is the standardized way to connect multiple Bluetooth speakers together. If you want to connect to lots of speakers at once, they\u2019ll all have to be from Sony.\n\nThe ULT Field 5 supports the AAC, SBC, and higher-resolution LDAC codecs\u2014another thing that sets it apart from the Field 3, which doesn\u2019t have LDAC support. It delivers audio through two tweeters and a single woofer, aided by two passive radiators. Thanks to the separate tweeters, the speaker supports stereo audio. Sony doesn't say how big the tweeters are, but the racetrack woofer measures 4.2 by 3.1 inches and is capable of reproducing a frequency range of 20Hz to 20kHz.\n\nSony claims the ULT Field 5 has a battery life of 25 hours, which is quite good considering the speaker's size. Not only can you live it up all day and night, but moderate users can likely go days between charges, while light users may eke weeks out of a single charge. When you do need to plug in, you\u2019ll get two hours of playback time from 10 minutes of charging.\n\nIn addition to the speaker itself, Sony supplies a shoulder strap and a USB-C charging cable.",
