      "feedback": "**Actionable edit checklist (compact paragraph)**  \n1. **Re‑structure the narrative** into a single, coherent scenario map: start with macro‑policy (BOJ wage‑growth, Fed stance), move to sectoral drivers (UAS job growth, small‑cap fundamentals), then to investor behavior (Barista FIRE’s effect on consumption).  \n2. **Add explicit causal links**: e.g., BOJ’s tight labor market → higher Japanese wages → upward pressure on global commodity prices → higher U.S. inflation → Fed rate hikes → small‑cap valuation compression. Cite A7VLN74BK for wage data and the Fed’s policy statements.  \n3. **Quantify every claim**:  \n   - UAS: 97 % job growth (712→1,400) and avg salary $105,912 (FOM34PUWA).  \n   - Small caps: RUT P/E ≈ 12 vs SPX ≈ 20; negative‑earning % ≈ 30% (Q7VVGNSQE).  \n   - Barista FIRE: 71 % of retirees not working (source 5), 40 % of Americans want a vacation home (Pacaso source).  \n4. **Insert precise timing windows**: e.g., BOJ policy updates Q4 2025, UAS job releases semi‑annually, small‑cap earnings Q3 2025.  \n5. **Define catalysts, triggers, and invalidations** with dates:  \n   - Catalyst: BOJ maintains tight labor market → wage growth > 3 % YoY (A7VLN74BK).  \n   - Trigger: UAS job growth > 10 % YoY (FOM34PUWA).  \n   - Invalidation: BOJ cuts policy rate or wage growth stalls; UAS data gaps; small‑cap earnings remain negative.  \n6. **Add a watch‑list section**: RUT/SPX ratio, BOJ policy statements, UAS employment releases, small‑cap earnings reports.  \n7. **Provide a confidence rating** (e.g., moderate‑high) and justify it with the alignment of macro fundamentals, sectoral data, and behavioral trends.  \n8. **Ensure citation density**: every numeric claim must reference a source ID (e.g., ILYC1M41F, UPV3X2MQ6, FOM34PUWA, A7VLN74BK, Q7VVGNSQE).  \n9. **Remove generic platitudes** (“Barista FIRE has emerged”) and replace with data‑backed statements.  \n10. **Reconcile any conflicting sources** (e.g., AUVSI’s abandoned projections vs. current UAS data) and explain the shift.  \n\nImplementing these edits will elevate the analysis to world‑class quality, with clear depth, coherence, and actionable signals.",
