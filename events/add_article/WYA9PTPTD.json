      "summary": "Ahead of a meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, world leaders expressed optimism about a potential resolution to the ongoing war in Ukraine. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky remains skeptical, asserting that Putin seeks complete occupation rather than peace. Reports suggest Trump may propose economic incentives to Russia, including access to natural resources off Alaska, while discussions about the return of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia have been sidelined in the peace talks. The summit is seen as a diplomatic gamble, with uncertain outcomes for Ukraine's future.",
