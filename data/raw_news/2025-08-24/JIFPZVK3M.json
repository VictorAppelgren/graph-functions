  "content": "A worker assembles a Peugeot 3008 compact sport-utility vehicle (SUV) on the production line at a plant operated by Dongfeng Peugeot-Citroen Automobile Ltd., the joint venture between Dongfeng Motor Corp. and PSA Peugeot Citroen, in Wuhan, China.\n\nShares in China's Dongfeng Motor Group skyrocketed to hit their highest level since 2017 as they resumed trading Monday, after the company's parent announced on Friday plans to take the automaker private.\n\nDongfeng Motor Group's Hong Kong-listed stock surged 69%, before paring gains to trade at over 57% higher, with Reuters reporting the take-private deal values the company at about $7 billion.\n\nThe Wuhan-based company is also preparing to spin off and list its electric-vehicle unit, VOYAH, in Hong Kong.\n\nTrading in the company's shares was halted between Aug. 11 and Aug. 22 as they company had flagged a possible key announcement.\n\nThe take-private decision follows a March statement from China's State Council, which indicated potential restructuring of three major state-owned carmakers, including Dongfeng Motor, as part of efforts to consolidate the sector and enhance competitiveness.\n\nThe company, which also released its earnings on Friday, reported revenue for the first half of the year rose 6.6% from a year earlier to 54.53 billion yuan (about $7.5 billion).\n\nIn its earnings report, Dongfeng noted that the \"severe and complex landscape\" facing the automotive industry was \"unlikely to improve significantly.\"\n\n\"Domestic demand is expected to gradually slow, while the overseas market faces new uncertainties,\" it said in its business outlook segment, adding that market segmentation will intensify.\n\nDongfeng Motor, which partners with Japan's Nissan and Honda, said it delivered 823,900 vehicles in the first half of 2025, down nearly 15% from a year ago.\n\nStill, sales of pure electric and plug-in hybrid models climbed 33% to 204,400 units, making up roughly a quarter of total deliveries. The VOYAH series saw sales soaring 84.8% year on year, the company said in its filing.\n\nLast week, Dongfeng Motor Group reportedly put its 50% stake in Dongfeng Honda Engine Company for sale. The company's shares rose almost 150% year-to-date, LSEG data showed.\n\nDongfeng Motor Corporation, parent of Dongfeng Motor Group, was founded in 1969 and is one of China's oldest auto companies.",

      "text": "} ?>\n(Yicai) March 31 -- China plans mergers and restructurings in its state-owned auto sector to consolidate the industry and boost its competitiveness, according to a deputy director of the commission that oversees the country\u2019s state-owned enterprises.\nTo hasten the creation of globally competitive auto groups, key resources in research and development, manufacturing, and market advantages need to be pooled, Gou Ping of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission said at the China Electric Vehicle 100 Forum over the weekend.\nThe restructuring will promote internal talent integration, improve resource allocation efficiency, and encourage greater cooperation between centrally controlled SOEs and other businesses, Guo noted. The new groupings will have independent core technologies and lead the shift to smart connected vehicles, he added.\nThe SASAC controls three state-owned carmakers, namely FAW Group, Dongfeng Motor Group, and China South Industries Group, the parent company of Changan Automobile.\nFAW\u2019s shares [SHE: 000800] fell 0.9 percent to close at CNY8.09 (USD1.12) each in Shenzhen today, while Changan Auto [SHE: 000625] rose 0.9 percent to CNY13.03. In Hong Kong, Dongfeng Motor\u2019s stock [HKG: 0489] jumped 4.9 percent to end at HKD4.74 (61 US cents).\nEarly last month, Dongfeng Automobile, Dongfeng Electronic Technology, and other listed units of Dongfeng Motor revealed possible changes to their indirect controlling shareholders, while Changan Auto, Dongan Auto Engine, Great Wall Military Industry, Jianshe Industry Group, and other firms under CSGC, said their owner had notified them of plans to restructure with other SOEs.\nThe move will help concentrate resources, accelerate innovative breakthroughs, enhance the overall competitiveness and influence of the Chinese auto sector, and contribute to improving the industry\u2019s quality and efficiency, according to Liu Xingguo, senior researcher at the China Enterprise Confederation.\nDisorderly Competition\nSome car producers are sacrificing profits for market share, which results in disorderly competition as they resort to practices such as false advertising and malicious slander, Zheng Bei, deputy head of China\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission, said at the forum over the weekend.\nThis not only leads to a short-term drop in profits, but over the long run undermines technological innovation, product quality and safety, and weakens industrial competitiveness, she added.\nThe NDRC will implement systematic measures to address market chaos, regulate illegal practices, uphold fair competition, strengthen price monitoring, guide industry self-regulation, and expose typical cases of unfair competition, Zheng said. Strict market supervision will also be enforced, particularly to ensure that products meet technical standards and safety requirements, she said.\nAutomakers should shift their competitive focus from price wars to improving quality and services and following sustainable development paths, Xin Guobin, vice minister for industry and information technology, also said at the forum.\nConsumption Potential\nSales of consumer goods through the government\u2019s trade-in subsidy policy have exceeded CNY1.3 trillion (USD179.2 billion), with cars accounting for over CNY950 billion (USD131 billion), or 73 percent, according to data shared by Commerce Vice Minister Sheng Qiuping.\nMore than 1.77 million applications had been made this year as of March 28, after 6.8 million vehicles were traded in through the program last year, about four million of which were new energy vehicles, he said.\nNEV sales surged nearly 36 percent to 12.87 million last year. The ministry said the NEV market will also grow rapidly this year, with further efforts planned to address bottlenecks.\nEditor: Futura Costaglione"
