  "description": "Texas exemplified its issue of scoring runs later into games against Philadelphia, scoring in the first inning of all three games, then putting up a total of...",
  "content": "ARLINGTON - A Rangers official posed a question Monday: Have all the columns about the ineffectiveness of the offense been exhausted?\n\nOf topics, the Rangers\u2019 offense has been a prolific producer. Of actual runs: Not so much.\n\nIt\u2019s been established the Rangers offense struggles against lefties. Also: on the road. Add top-tier pitching, too. Much of that can be explained by pure physical deficiencies or something as easy as playing away from home. What may be most damning about an offense that has become accustomed to profanity is this: The team doesn\u2019t seem to get better as the game progresses.\n\nWhat it suggests: Either a lack of feel or as president of baseball operations Chris Young once described it earlier this year a lack of \u201cconnectivity.\u201d\n\nConsider the natural flow of the game. Some teams are hot starters, other are not. But according to league averages, teams see about a 4% increase in run production from the first three innings to the middle three. Pitchers have shown most or all of their repertoire the first time through the order. They may start to fatigue. The advantage moves towards the hitter. Then, when facing high-leverage relievers late in games, it drops off again.\n\nNot the Rangers. They start out OK enough, ranking 12th in the majors in run scored through the first three innings. Then, when other offenses are figuring things out, they go flat. They have a dropoff of 6% in scoring in innings 4-6 and their 119 total runs from the seventh through the ninth are last in baseball.\n\nThat sure appeared to be crystal clear over the weekend, when the Rangers scored in the first inning of all three games against Philadelphia, then scored a total of one run after that.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like they either don\u2019t - or can\u2019t - make adjustments.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s there because I\u2019ve seen it,\u201d co-hitting instructor Bret Boone said Monday. \u201cBut why do we go in these extreme lows? Is it a lack of focus? No, these guys want to win. They want to do well. We do all get caught up in our individual numbers. I\u2019d be lying to you if I always thought, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m not worried my number. Let\u2019s just win.\u2019 No, let\u2019s just win. But I want my numbers too. You want to contribute.\n\n\u201cThe thing that really just grates on me is when we have a runner on third and less than two outs. Let\u2019s get this runner in. I love it when we move the runner. The energy is unbelievable. And I can\u2019t tell you the difference between scoring one run in an inning and two. It\u2019s a world of difference. I can\u2019t say they they\u2019re not capable of making adjustments, but you have a fair point that we\u2019ve gone through streaks during the season - and big streaks - where we tend to take the middle innings off, and now all of a sudden, it\u2019s 2-2 in the eighth and we\u2019re facing high leverage guys.\u201d\n\nMaybe the best way to measure guys ability to make adjustments from at-bat to at-bat is in on-base percentage. Getting on base moves the line and continues to build stress on the pitcher.\n\nThe Rangers OBP stays essentially flat innings 1-3 (.312) to innings 4-6 (.311), then drops precipitously in the late innings (.269). Among the biggest dropoffs from the first three to the middle three are Josh Smith (.402 to .308), Josh Jung (.360 to .224), Kyle Higashioka (.361 to .196) and Adolis Garc\u00eda (.301 to .264).\n\nBoth Smith and Jung, each in their first three seasons, acknowledged that pitchers are gaining an advantage on them.\n\n\u201cMaybe they are making a better adjustment off of me based on my first at-bat and I\u2019m not properly adjusting to them,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I change a lot from at-bat to at-bat. It could just be coincidence.\u201d\n\nIt could. It could also be yet another telling sign that this offense simply doesn\u2019t work as intended.\n\nEven manager Bruce Bochy, who does everything he can to find reasons to support his offense, had a hard time trying to dismiss it.\n\n\u201cWe talk about it, how important it is every inning,\u201d Bochy said. \u201cI wish I had a good answer for you. It shouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nYet it has.\n\nFind more Rangers coverage from The Dallas Morning News here.\n\nClick or tap here to sign up for our Rangers newsletter.",

  "summary": "The Rangers' offense tends to get worse as the game progresses, with a dropoff of 6% in scoring in innings 4-6 and 119 total runs from the seventh through the ninth. The team struggles against lefties and on-the-road opponents, as well as top-tier pitching. However, the team's performance seems to improve as game progresses. Co-hitting instructor Bret Boone believes the team doesn't make adjustments, either to the hitter or to the pitcher. The Rangers' on-base percentage also indicates a lack of ability to adjust from at-bat to bat.

      "text": "ARLINGTON \u2014 The Texas Rangers staggered into Sunday\u2019s series finale vs. the Philadelphia Phillies after three games in a five-day span against a trio of left-handed starting pitchers with favorable odds to win the Cy Young award in their respective leagues.\nTheir reprieve was one of baseball\u2019s premier right-handers.\nThe difference in outcome \u2014 and the way they arrived to it \u2014 was negligible at best. Elite pitchers are impossible to escape, Rangers manager Bruce Bochy cautioned, and offered the reminder that good teams are able to produce runs nonetheless.\n\u201cIf we think we are who we are,\u201d Bochy said, \u201cthen we find a way to get those runs.\u201d\nAbout that.\nThe Rangers, through 119 games, are a barely-over-.500 team that\u2019s on the outside of the postseason after a series loss vs. the Philadelphia Phillies at Globe Life Field that featured three identical losses. Sunday\u2019s 4-2 loss vs. All-Star right-hander Zack Wheeler, Saturday\u2019s 3-2 loss vs. left-hander Jes\u00fas Luzardo and Friday\u2019s 9-1 loss vs. Cy Young award candidate Cristopher S\u00e1nchez were each marred by the same inability to build on quick starts.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s kind of a lull right now,\u201d leadoff hitter Josh Smith said Sunday after an 0-for-5 day. \u201cWe\u2019ve faced some pretty good pitching, but, we\u2019ve got to do a better job and win those games.\u201d\nThe Rangers have scored the fewest runs in baseball against teams with an above-.500 record this season and, against all pitchers they\u2019ve faced with a 3.00 ERA or better, have not once scored more than four runs. Sunday\u2019s loss included that continuation of a troubling trend in which early offense is followed by zeroes. Bochy officially categorized it as a \u201cfunk\u201d Sunday afternoon.\nIt\u2019s one thing to recognize it.\nIt\u2019s another to escape it.\n\u201cWe changed the lineup today,\u201d Bochy said when asked how, exactly, Texas can break the habit. \u201cWe mixed it up, moved guys around a little bit, you try that.\u201d\nThe attempt was not in vain. The Rangers bumped right fielder Adolis Garc\u00eda out of the four-hole and replaced him with designated hitter Joc Pederson. A first-inning two-run home run vs. Wheeler, Pederson\u2019s second this homestand, gave the Rangers an early lead.\nThe issue continued to lie in the eight innings that followed. The Rangers were shut out in the second through ninth innings Sunday afternoon and went 6 for 25 and advanced just one runner to second base after Pederson\u2019s home run.\nThey scored four runs in the three combined first innings of this series and scored just once \u2014 on a home run from shortstop Corey Seager in the eighth inning of Saturday\u2019s loss \u2014 in the other 24 frames. Seager would have hit a game-tying home run in the bottom of the fifth inning Sunday had Philadelphia center fielder Harrison Bader not leaped and caught the ball before it landed in the Texas bullpen.\nTeams on average have a .705 OPS when they face pitchers the first time through a batting order and it increases to .735 and .754 by the second and third trips through. That\u2019s a 0.49-point improvement from the first to the third. The Rangers, who have a .666 OPS against pitchers the first time through the order, do not make a comparable jump when the face starters for a second and third time.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty simple game,\u201d Bochy said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get a big hit when you do get guys on base. That\u2019s been missing.\"\nPitching and defense, as it has been all season, was not. Left-hander Patrick Corbin allowed three runs in 4\u2153 innings and was bailed out in the second inning by a sliding catch from center fielder Wyatt Langford (that he ran 75 feet into right field to snag) and a circus catch one at bat later from Garc\u00eda on a shallow pop fly.\nIt\u2019s a reminder of the elite play that Texas has been unable to capitalize on this year. The Rangers\u2019 3.28 ERA and .991 fielding percentage both lead the league. Only three teams have led baseball in both categories this century; each made the postseason and two, the 2001 Seattle Mariners and 2018 Houston Astros, advanced to the championship series.\nThe Rangers are 2\u00bd games back of the last wild card berth and six-and-a-half games back of the American League West lead with 43 games left to play. They have a 21.9% chance to make the playoffs, according to FanGraphs.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of games left,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to start winning some of them.\u201d\nFind more Rangers coverage from The Dallas Morning News here."

      "text": "ARLINGTON \u2014 If it looks like a platoon and swings like a platoon, it is most likely a platoon.\nThat\u2019s what the Rangers have at first base at the moment.\nAgainst right-hander Ryne Nelson on Monday, the Rangers started left-handed hitting Rowdy Tellez. It was the second straight game Tellez started at first. Right-handed hitting Jake Burger, who was activated Friday following a three-week stint on the injured list because of a quadriceps strain, started against lefties the first two nights back.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t said that [it\u2019s a platoon],\u201d manager Bruce Bochy said. \u201cBut that\u2019s kind of how I\u2019m doing it right now, especially with how Burger\u2019s quad has been.\u201d\nBurger\u2019s performance against right-handed pitching this year has lagged. He\u2019s hitting just .220/.248/.376/.624 against right-handed pitching in 226 plate appearances. The on-base percentage is particularly telling. It is the third lowest among 237 major leaguers with at least 200 plate appearances against right-handers this season. It underscores the all-or-nothing element that is the Rangers\u2019 lineup.\nTellez hasn\u2019t been significantly better at reaching base against right-handers, posting a .268 OBP in 192 plate appearances entering Monday, but he has slugged at a .469 clip to post a .737 OPS against right-handers.\nFind more Rangers coverage from The Dallas Morning News here."

On Friday, the relievers made nice introductions.\nPlus, the Rangers\u2019 busy trade deadline created a roster crunch that required some maneuvering.\nThe Rangers were active at the trade deadline, boosting their bullpen and starting rotation, but not their lineup.\nBurger was placed on the injured list with a quadriceps issue coming out of the All-Star break.\nTexas went 8-1 on its nine-game homestand that was especially important with the trade deadline looming.\nLangford got the Rangers on the board early on Sunday and they never looked back.\nThe Rangers optioned Jung to the minors to improve the swing decisions that caused him significant issues during the season\u2019s first half.\nTexas\u2019 steady second baseman overcame a scary moment early in the game to come up clutch in extra innings.\nThe Rangers selected Fien, a high school shortstop, with the No. 12 pick in the 2025 MLB draft.\nPart performance, part upcoming matchups, the reason may be entirely irrelevant to Jung after a stint in Triple-A.\nJung, still in Triple-A after struggling through June, is \u201cnot quite there yet,\u201d according to Bruce Bochy.\nIf the Rangers are going to claw their way back into the playoffs, it\u2019s going to be all hands on deck during the final stretch."

      "text": "ARLINGTON \u2014 The Rangers believe Wyatt Langford has 30-homers, 30-steals ability.\nBut he\u2019s gone into both a power and speed brownout since the All-Star break. Langford began Monday\u2019s game without a homer or a stolen base in the second half. He last homered on July 11 at Houston and last stole a base on July 12, also at Houston. He has 15 homers and 15 steals for the season.\nLangford was in a 2-for-17 stretch entering the Arizona series.\n\u201cWhen he\u2019s right on, he\u2019s pulling more balls,\u201d manager Bruce Bochy said. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing that as much. He\u2019s staying on the breaking ball a little bit better and doing a good job of controlling strikes on it and getting his walks. Sometimes you can overdo that a little bit and lose a little bit of what you do well. It\u2019s a fine line.\u201d\nIt\u2019s another way of saying Langford can fall into a pattern of getting passive at the plate. Since the All-Star break, Langford had taken 10 called third strikes, tied for the fifth most in the majors. For the year, he had taken 38, seventh most in the majors.\nThere isn\u2019t as easy an explanation for why he\u2019s stopped running as often, though he has been caught on three consecutive attempts. One explanation may be the proliferation of lefties the Rangers are facing lately. In addition to being harder for the club to hit, they are better at controlling the running game.\nAs a team, the Rangers are just 9 for 16 (56%) on stolen base attempts.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not shutting him down or anything,\u201d Bochy said. \u201cI will say some of the pitchers we\u2019re facing are not giving us as much of a chance to run. We\u2019ve made some outs on the bases lately. We\u2019re trying to pick our spots a little more so we\u2019re not running ourselves out of innings. But [Langford] is not being shut down.\u201d\nFind more Rangers coverage from The Dallas Morning News here."

  "argos_summary": "The Texas Rangers are struggling offensively, particularly against left-handed pitchers and in late-game situations, as evidenced by their recent series against the Philadelphia Phillies where they scored early but failed to maintain momentum. The team's on-base percentage drops significantly in the later innings, indicating a lack of adjustments against pitchers. Manager Bruce Bochy and players acknowledge the need for improvement, especially in capitalizing on scoring opportunities, as the Rangers remain on the brink of playoff contention with a challenging schedule ahead.",
