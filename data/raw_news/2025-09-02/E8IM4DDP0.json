  "content": "I could fill every newsletter with stats that interest me. To save you time, I\u2019ve condensed an offseason of research into key numbers on 32 potential fantasy targets. This is what you should know before the 2025 season kicks off on Thursday.\n\nThis article is from Scoop City, The Athletic\u2019s NFL newsletter. Sign up here to receive it directly in your inbox.\n\nWith Shane Waldron calling plays for part of 2024, Caleb Williams averaged 13.4 fantasy points. Without Waldron? 16.7, which would\u2019ve tied Justin Herbert for the 14th-best fantasy performance among QBs. Add a per-game bump similar to what Jared Goff\u2019s (+3.7) was with new Bears HC Ben Johnson, and Williams would\u2019ve averaged 20.4 points, good for QB7 last season.\n\nSince 2020, Kyler Murray averages 22 points per game when he rushes at least six times per game, five points better than when he doesn\u2019t. He plans to run more this season, which should help him improve after a QB10 finish last year.\n\nBrock Purdy averaged 18.5 points per game in 2023. Without Christian McCaffrey, Brandon Aiyuk and Trent Williams for parts of 2024, Purdy averaged 17.8. So regardless of who\u2019s on the field, Purdy is a strong option. More reason to draft him: Beat reporter Vic Tafur has Purdy as his dark-horse MVP candidate.\n\u2022 Josh Allen has averaged 20-plus points per game in every season since 2020, and saw the highest designated-rush rate of his career while running for 531 yards in 2024.\n\u2022 New England\u2019s Drake Maye was fourth among quarterbacks in rushing yards from Weeks 6 to 18, and his per game average would\u2019ve equated to 578 yards across a full 17-game season.\n\u2022 Daniel Jones, the QB9 in 2022 thanks to 708 rushing yards and seven touchdowns, is now in Indianapolis, where he has the best environment of his NFL career. He\u2019s free in every draft.\n\nFew RBs have drawn offseason praise like Chase Brown, who averaged the fourth-most fantasy points among running backs from Weeks 9 to 18, with 20.6 per game. If the high-scoring Bengals are all in on him, we should be, too.\n\nJahmyr Gibbs breaks fantasy football if the Lions give him just 65 percent of their snaps. With a 55.7 percent last season, he was the RB2. Adding 10 percent to his average equates to 24.9 points per game, the highest average by a back since 2020.\n\nDerrick Henry is unstoppable, and Baltimore knows it. When opponents had seven or more defenders in the box, the Ravens ran the ball at the league\u2019s second-highest rate. He averaged an absurd 6 yards per carry on 230 of those runs. I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s age 31 or 61, Henry is a fantasy target.\n\nIt\u2019s the perfect storm for Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker. He\u2019s in a contract year, fits OC Klint Kubiak\u2019s scheme perfectly, runs behind an improved offensive line and the team plans to feed him. He\u2019s also an elite talent: He broke more tackles per attempt (0.42) last year than 2014 Marshawn Lynch and 2020 Nick Chubb, setting a PFF record.\n\nPanthers RB Chuba Hubbard ranked between Saquon Barkley and Gibbs for the fifth-most rushing yards over expected per rush attempt, per Next Gen Stats, and remains the most underrated back in football.\n\u2022 The Titans quietly improved their offensive line and drafted the top rookie quarterback, yet everyone\u2019s still sleeping on Tony Pollard, whose biggest competition for touches is an injured Tyjae Spears.\n\u2022 Washington was the ideal landing spot for Jacory Croskey-Merritt. OC Kliff Kingsbury\u2019s scheme consistently spreads defenses, allowing the Commanders to lead the league in rushing attempts against light boxes.\n\u2022 Jets RB Breece Hall posted a lower rushing-success rate (35.4 percent) than backup Braelon Allen (38) last season. By most reports, Allen has been the better player this offseason, and there\u2019s little reason for the Jets to stick with Hall as their 1A.\n\u2022 Even if rookie Woody Marks fails to beat out Nick Chubb and Dameon Pierce for the Texans\u2019 lead role, his receiving chops suggest he gets most of the 95 targets vacated in Houston\u2019s backfield.\n\nA.J. Brown finished as WR12 on a points-per-game basis, but was the WR6 during the first three quarters (Saquon Barkley closed out most Philly games). The Eagles lost some key defensive pieces and should be in fewer blowouts, allowing Brown to again be a top-six scorer.\n\nOnly 56 percent of Titans WR Calvin Ridley\u2018s targets were catchable in 2024, which was why he finished as WR43 in points per game despite ranking 15th in team target share (23.7). He could have a Terry McLaurin-like season, thanks to the accuracy of rookie Cam Ward.\n\nChris Godwin\u2019s inevitable return shouldn\u2019t dampen the outlook for Buccaneers rookie Emeka Egbuka, as the 2024 Buccaneers used 11 personnel (three receivers) for 71.2 percent of their snaps, a top-10 rate in the league.\n\nChiefs WR Rashee Rice will miss the first six games of the season. That\u2019s fine. He averaged 17.6 points per game last season and was \u201cPatrick Mahomes\u2019 favorite target by far in training camp,\u201d according to Jesse Newell, who covers the Chiefs for The Athletic.\n\nRavens WR Zay Flowers quietly saw the ninth-highest team target percentage among receivers last season (25.4) and averaged an impressive 2.27 yards per route run, which nearly tied CeeDee Lamb (2.28). Year 3 breakout incoming.\n\u2022 Vikings WR Adam Thielen averaged 13.9 points per game in 2024 and is now the No. 2 receiver in Minnesota, at least until Jordan Addison returns after the first three weeks.\n\u2022 Titans rookie receiver Elic Ayomanor had 294 receiving yards (not a typo) and three touchdowns in one Stanford game against this year\u2019s top rookie cornerback, Travis Hunter, and could quickly overtake 32-year-old Tyler Lockett for the No. 2 role.\n\nSpeaking of Travis Hunter, he should play up to 80 percent of offensive snaps for the Jaguars in 2025, according to his coach. Receivers with a similar snap share in 2024 include McLaurin, Lamb and Brian Thomas Jr. Don\u2019t be afraid of the dual status for the draft\u2019s most talented player.\n\nBaltimore\u2019s Mark Andrews was the fourth-highest-scoring tight end across the second half of last season, averaging 13.9 points per game despite running the 20th-most routes. Even if Isaiah Likely takes on a bigger role, Andrews should remain Lamar Jackson\u2019s favorite target, especially in the red zone.\n\nForget Green Bay\u2019s receivers. Target Tucker Kraft. He ran the fourth-highest route rate among tight ends, and in this century, only George Kittle has averaged more yards after the catch by any TE through his first two seasons.\n\u2022 In games Maye started, Patriots TE Hunter Henry saw an elite 19.6 percent target share and averaged 10.1 points per game as his quarterback\u2019s safety valve.\n\u2022 Bears rookie Colston Loveland was drafted 10th overall by the former Detroit assistant who oversaw rookie Sam LaPorta\u2019s TE1 finish in 2023. Don\u2019t overthink it.\n\nThat\u2019s 27. Over to Jake Ciely for the final five.\n\nAll In with Jake Ciely\n\nLast year\u2019s Week 1 fantasy waivers included players like Chuba Hubbard, Bucky Irving and Jerry Jeudy. There\u2019s more potential value sitting on the waiver wire this year. These five players \u2014 in both my Week 1 waiver targets and Free Guys column \u2014 help you maximize your bench!\n\n1. Dolphins RB Ollie Gordon. His competition to back up De\u2019Von Achane, Jaylen Wright, is sidelined and looked awful this preseason. Gordon can be the Dolphins\u2019 version of David Montgomery. Given Achane\u2019s injury history, don\u2019t be surprised if this one-two punch is most like the 2023 Dolphins, and Gordon ends up an RB2.\n\n2. Browns RB Dylan Sampson. Rookie Quinshon Judkins still hasn\u2019t signed; Jerome Ford is quality but limited; and Sampson\u2019s role can remain productive no matter the situation. He is like the Browns\u2019 version of Austin Ekeler. Once Judkins is active, that won\u2019t change. In fact, Sampson has a chance to take the early lead and carry RB2 value.\n\n3. Browns WR Cedric Tillman. Let\u2019s not forget the 40 targets in a four-game stretch for him last year, and with Joe Flacco at quarterback, he is in the WR4 boom-or-bust group.\n\n4. Broncos WR Marvin Mims. He is the No. 2 for the Broncos now, and if that doesn\u2019t change, he is primed for a Year 3 breakout. Even if Nix merely repeats his rookie performance, seeing 110-plus targets would have him in the range of 900 yards with a decent chunk of touchdowns (likely seven or more) and weekly top-20 potential.\n\n\n\n5. Texans WR Christian Kirk. You probably know I\u2019m a fan of Texans\u2019 rookie WR Jayden Higgins, but if Higgins has to work his way into the No. 2 role \u2014 be patient, he will \u2014 Kirk is a great value to start the year. If you draft, say, Chris Godwin or Brandon Aiyuk, and need an early-season option, Kirk has always been productive when healthy.\n\nMy full list of players to add before Week 1 also includes Najee Harris, who said Monday that he expects to play this Friday.\n\n\ud83d\udceb Enjoyed this read?

  "summary": "The article includes key numbers on 32 potential fantasy targets before the 2025 season kicks off. With Shane Waldron calling plays for part of 2024, Caleb Williams averaged 13.4 fantasy points without Waldron, which would have led him to the 14th-best fantasy performance among QBs among them. Since 2020, Kyler Murray averages 22 points per game when he rushes at least six times per game, five points better than when he doesn't. Brock Purdy averaged 18.5 fantasy points in 2023, while Drake Maye was fourth among quarterbacks in rushing yards from Weeks 6 to 18, and his per game average would've equated to 578 yards across a full 17-game season. Daniel Jones, the QB9 in 2022 thanks to 708 rushing yards and seven touchdowns, is now in Indianapolis, where he has the best environment of his NFL career. Marcus Lefen's fantasy season is set to begin with the Seahawks' Kenneth Walker, who is in a contract year, running behind an improved offensive line and is expected to be a strong option. Meanwhile, in the NFL, Derrick Henry is considered unstoppable, averaging 6 yards per carry on 230 runs.",

      "text": "The further Kyler Murray gets past his 2023 season-ending knee injury, the more confident he becomes that the lingering effects will be left in the dust.\nMurray told PHNX Sports that he feels better about his knee injury allowing him to play more freely in 2025.\n\"Honestly, they say, Year 2 (post-knee injury) is the best year, and honestly how I feel right now is as if it never happened,\" Murray said in a sit-down interview that posted Tuesday. \"Talking to (offensive coordinator) Drew (Petzing) and Izzy (QBs coach Israel Woolfork), feeling like going into this year I'll be able to do whatever I want to do.\"\nMurray noted that, at times, the knee still bothered him in 2024. He specifically mentioned tweaking it during the Week 1 loss to the Bills and that it affected him the rest of the opening-game collapse. The two-time Pro Bowler believes that after dealing with those sorts of aftereffects last year, he won't have the same issue during the coming season.\nIt's certainly true that the further players get away from devastating knee injuries, the closer to normal they become -- Saquon Barkley's 2020 injury is one of the best examples, as he didn't look like himself again until 2022. The expectations are generally slightly different for quarterbacks, as those who play from the pocket might return to form sooner. However, for mobile mavens like Murray, the issues can linger.\nFeeling fully healthy means Murray expects to use his legs more in 2025 after attempting a career-low 4.6 rushes per contest last season.\n\"I do feel like I have to run more next year,\" Murray said. \"I'm open to running more next year, just because it's such a weapon, you know, it's such a weapon. Like when I hand the ball off obviously I hand the ball off to James (Conner), I hand off to Trey (Benson), we're a very good rushing team, which is a great thing. But when Lamar (Jackson) hands the ball off everybody is like 'Ahh', like you can relax, Josh (Allen) hands the ball off, 'Ahh', you know what I mean? So I think for us, part of the emphasis going into next season is conceptually on time, I feel I'm one of the best in the league.\"\nMurray's legs can undoubtedly be an added dimension Petzing didn't fully have at his disposal last year. If the 27-year-old quarterback can stay healthy and return to his dual-threat ways, it could help freshen up a Cardinals offense that has been stuffy the past few seasons."

      "text": "TAMPA, Fla. \u2014 Seven weeks into the 2024 season, Buccaneers wide receiver Chris Godwin was on pace for a career year and a payday fit for the CEO of a tech company.\nThen, a dislocated ankle ended his season and changed everything.\nAs he turned 29 in late February, Godwin still had not been offered a new deal by the Bucs, even though his contract was expiring in less than a month. He had a lot to think about.\nDoes my team still value me?\nWill other teams want to take a chance on my ankle even though they don\u2019t know me?\nShould I see if the grass is greener?\nAdvertisement\nDuring the combine, the Bucs contacted his agent, Tory Dandy. They wanted Godwin back, they said, but there was only so much they could offer given their budget, salary-cap considerations, Godwin\u2019s injury and the contract recently given to fellow wide receiver Mike Evans, which will pay him more than $25 million in 2025.\nBut four other teams wanted Godwin, with the Patriots and Steelers at the forefront, according to Godwin.\nThe Bucs made their best offer, and then the Patriots came hard, offering an average of $30 million per year on a multiyear deal, he says. And it\u2019s possible there was more juice to be squeezed there. The Buccaneers\u2019 offer was for three years at $66 million, averaging $22 million per season.\nDandy explained he would be leaving generational money on the table if he passed up the Patriots\u2019 offer.\nBucs general manager Jason Licht could only sweat, thinking one of the best players he drafted and fostered was leaving the nest.\nOne opinion mattered to Godwin \u2014 his wife Mariah\u2019s. They went over the possibilities and concluded they would take less, much less, to stay in Tampa.\nWhat people who don\u2019t know Godwin couldn\u2019t understand was why.\nSome play for money.\nSome play for glory.\nSome play for ego.\nGodwin plays for others.\nShortly after graduating from eighth grade, he met Mariah DelPercio, whose father, Mark DelPercio, became his coach at Middletown High School.\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Chris and Mariah were hanging out. They dated on the sly for about two years before their secret could no longer be kept.\nThey went to Penn State together. When Chris trained for the NFL Scouting Combine in Pensacola, Fla., she went with him. Then, she moved to Tampa when the Bucs drafted him.\nNow married for four years and together for 15, they flow together well, partly because they share interests. He took up chess recently; she followed suit. They both got into photography around the time they married and decided to chronicle their lives by taking a Polaroid photo of the two of them every day and pasting it in a scrapbook. Their first was on June 10, 2021.\nChris and Mariah Godwin have taken a Polaroid together every day over the last four years. (Courtesy of Chris Godwin)\nDogs have become a mutual passion. It started when they brought Ghost, a Pomsky, to their family. Then they adopted Ziggy, an American Staffordshire Terrier, from the Tampa Humane Society. They also partnered with the society through the Chris Godwin Foundation and made regular visits to the shelter to play with their dogs.\nAdvertisement\nChris calls Tampa \u201cthe perfect place for me and who I am.\u201d\nYear-round sunshine and warmth, along with an emphasis on healthy eating, agree with Chris and Mariah. They appreciate the big-city opportunities, even though they are mostly homebodies. Their sweet spot is a suburban house they purchased a few years ago, and the plan is to live there for as long as they can envision.\nGodwin has also been ingrained in his team since his rookie year, when Evans treated him like a brother rather than the threat he was.\nIn Godwin\u2019s first year as a starter, he had 19 more catches and 176 more receiving yards than Evans, who by then was a three-time Pro Bowler with five straight 1,000-yard seasons.\n\u201cNot a single time throughout that year did Mike mention anything to me or anybody about the targets I was getting and the success that I was having, even though he had been the franchise receiver, the No. 1 receiver,\u201d Godwin says. \u201cYou would expect some kind of animosity, like, \u2018Hey, if I\u2019m your guy, why is he getting all of that?\u2019\u201d\nAnyone who labels Evans and Godwin as No. 1 and No. 2, or 1A and 1B, misses their essence. Each is a component of a duo, arguably football\u2019s finest.\nThey make one another better, yes, but they also sacrifice for the other. If Evans had not been across the field all these years, Godwin probably would have been the recipient of many more targets, touchdowns, honors and dollars.\nLicht says he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Godwin is listed as a beneficiary in Evans\u2019 will.\nGodwin believes they will be connected forever, but he also wants to be his teammate as long as he can.\n\u201cWhen me and Mike are done, long gone from this organization, I think we\u2019re going to look back on this time and say it was rare to have what we had,\u201d Godwin says.\nThe way Godwin sees it, he\u2019s just a spoke in a wheel.\nEvans is one of many Bucs, including support staff workers, who made Godwin want to remain in Tampa. The organization is as comfortable to him as worn-in cleats.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt\u2019s not always the case that you are surrounded by a ton of good people who care about the right things, who have similar goals and treat people with respect,\u201d he says. \u201cThe first thing for me is I want to work with people that I enjoy it with.\u201d\nGodwin\u2019s most productive season came with Jameis Winston throwing to him. He won a Super Bowl with Tom Brady. And his chemistry with Baker Mayfield is special.\n\u201cIncredibly fun to play with,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s something infectious about the mentality that he goes with. He\u2019s such a gritty player, and you don\u2019t really see that too often from quarterbacks, right?\u201d\nMayfield, Evans and Godwin, along with their spouses, are part of a group of Bucs and former Bucs who get together for regular game nights. Others include Cam Brate, Ryan Griffin, Anthony Nelson, Cade Otton and their wives. They play Fishbowl, Taboo, Mafia, Spades, Spoons and Presidents and A\u2013holes!\nThey eat, share, laugh and bond.\n\u201cHere, we\u2019re able to play games, have real conversations and build genuine relationships as opposed to ones that are just transactional,\u201d Godwin says.\nWhen they play games, they don\u2019t text, scroll social media or watch videos. They are present. And they are competitive.\nGodwin\u2019s video game username, \u201cChillguy13,\u201d is appropriate most of the time. On game nights, he can show a different side. During a recent game, Mariah was talking with another wife and was not completely engaged. Chris stopped her. \u201cHey,\u201d he said forcefully. \u201cYou really need to lock in. You are not going to be the reason we lose.\u201d\nWhat he really wants to win is another Super Bowl, especially for the teammates who weren\u2019t around when they won the last one. Only eight remain on the roster from the Super Bowl LV champs.\nHe thought a Super Bowl was a possibility in 2024. On the morning of Oct. 21, Godwin was leading the NFL in receptions, receiving touchdowns, receiving first downs and yards after the catch, and ranked third in receiving yards. He never could have known how his fate would twist that day.\nAdvertisement\nThe injury happened with the Bucs trailing the Ravens by 10 with about a minute left. Godwin caught a pass from Mayfield. Many receivers, in that situation, would have gone down immediately. Godwin, though, tried for more yards.\n\u201cOne thing that bugs me is when guys quit and give up too soon,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m going to play until the game is over. And that was what I was doing.\u201d\nHe was tackled from behind and tried to get up quickly. He couldn\u2019t. Face down, he tried dragging himself with his fists on the ground. He looked back at his leg and saw his left foot turned sideways in a way a foot is not supposed to turn.\nHe heard one of the defenders standing behind him say, \u201cOh, s\u2014.\u201d\nESPN, which was broadcasting the game, wouldn\u2019t allow its viewers to watch the play again.\nGodwin started thinking about Mariah and worried about how worried she\u2019d be. Godwin imagined her, nearly eight months pregnant at the time, running down from the stands to be with him. He asked that somebody call her.\nThen, a cart appeared. For the first time in his life, Godwin didn\u2019t walk off the field. He saw the sympathy on the faces of teammates and opponents, and the stadium seemed as silent as a desert after sundown.\nAs the cart drove off, he thought about what was next \u2014 surgery, months of rehab and the long, winding road. \u201cBack to work,\u201d he said.\nA video of that went viral. What happened next was seen by almost no one.\nIn the tunnel, Mariah was waiting. Together, they sobbed.\n\u201cWe put so much into this, so much time and effort,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the reality is, no matter how much you put into it, everything can change in a moment. We took a picture of us that morning with no idea how things would change a few hours later, and we talk about that still, never knowing what moment could change a portion of your life.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t just dislocate his ankle. Godwin also fractured his fibula, tore his deltoid and had a high ankle sprain. Surgeons inserted a plate and screws in his bone.\nAdvertisement\nThe post-op swelling was considerable, and he says the pain was a 14 or 15 on a scale of 10, the worst he ever felt, considerably worse than what he felt after an ACL tear in 2021. Godwin doesn\u2019t take painkillers, but he took them for two days after his ankle surgery.\nFor six weeks, he couldn\u2019t put weight on his ankle. The rehab process, he recalls, was physically taxing and mentally difficult, but he was focused \u2014 unusually focused.\n\u201cHe wanted to find the joy in it,\u201d Mariah says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to wallow in what could have been. And he hasn\u2019t spent a single second after that first day feeling sorry for himself. Instead, he\u2019s been celebrating every single little win on his way back.\u201d\nCurling his toes for the first time was a cause for celebration. \u201cIt was a small win, but a win nonetheless,\u201d he says.\nOther wins included moving his ankle \u2014 to the side, up and down, and around \u2014 going from a scooter to crutches, bearing weight for the first time, walking, balancing on one leg, riding a bike, jogging, squatting and jumping.\nOne of the most disappointing aspects to him is that he was unable to help Mariah in the late stages of her pregnancy.\n\u201cI was supposed to be picking up around the house and making sure she had everything she needed,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead, she was taking care of me while I spent most of the day laying on the couch with my foot elevated.\u201d\nHe made up for it after he was mobile and they became parents on Jan. 2. For the first month of Ace Kehlo Godwin\u2019s life, Chris wouldn\u2019t let his wife change a diaper, she says. When the baby woke at night, they took turns tending to him.\nChris is wearing fatherhood well. These days, Ace\u2019s smiles and giggles make him forget about the sleep his son cost him the night before. Chris and Ace have a morning routine. Dad sings a song and dances for him.\nGodwin has wanted to be a father for a long time \u2014 the same kind of father that his dad, Rod, was. Godwin is named after his father, as his full name is Rod Christopher Godwin Jr.\nAdvertisement\nChris\u2019 dad died about a year and a half ago. Now, Chris wants to honor the memory of his father, whom he credits with giving him the freedom and confidence to chase his dreams.\n\u201cI want my child to feel the same love my father poured into me and my siblings,\u201d he says. \u201cI have this privilege to be a steward of this young boy, and it\u2019s the coolest damn thing in the world to me.\u201d\nBeing fully cleared to return to the field will be pretty cool, too, but for now the training room window separates him from practicing teammates. He works alone, honing explosive movements and change-of-direction abilities.\nWhen he comes back, things will be different. They always are.\nHe might not be the same after the injury. The Bucs have a new offensive coordinator as Josh Grizzard has replaced Liam Coen. There is another wide receiver mouth to feed after the first-round selection of Emeka Egbuka.\nStill, Godwin expects his role to be similar to what it was in 2024, when he played primarily in the slot, as he had from 2019 through 2022.\n\u201cLast year verified for me that the slot is where I feel most comfortable, where I can be most involved in the game and do the most damage,\u201d he says.\nGodwin\u2019s production has never been the result of nine routes that leave a trail of vapor. He\u2019s not the type of playmaker who shows up every week on \u201cYou Got Mossed.\u201d\nHe has dominated with movements that are subtle, precision that is surgical, and grit that is commanding. And he has been consistent like an atomic clock.\nGodwin\u2019s style of play could bode well for him in his post-ankle injury phase. Certainly, the Bucs, Patriots and Steelers saw it that way. The Bucs wouldn\u2019t have given him $44 million in guaranteed money if they had doubts.\nLicht says he believes Godwin will make a major contribution this season. Godwin\u2019s expectation is to be lined up in the slot in the season opener, making catches and helping the Bucs win games \u2014 being a spoke in a wheel \u2014 as he was last season and the seven before.\nAdvertisement\nGodwin deeply appreciates all he has in Tampa. \u201cIf I ended up going to New England, it would have been solely based off money because everything else was telling me to stay here,\u201d he says.\nThe night after signing his new contract, he FaceTimed his brother Marcus Godwin. Ace was strapped to a carrier around his father\u2019s chest.\nMarcus: \u201cWhat are you doing to celebrate?\u201d\nChris: \u201cEating some beef jerky and putting my son to sleep.\u201d\nStaying home, surrounded by what means the most to him, is everything.\n(Illustration: Kelsea Petersen / The Athletic; photos: Icon Sportswire / Getty, Julio Aguilar / Getty)"

      "text": "I\u2019m not going to victory lap, I\u2019m not going to\u2026 Ah, hell, last year\u2019s \u201cFree Players\u201d piece was amazing!\nBo Nix, Sam Darnold, Tyrone Tracy, Chuba Hubbard, Bucky Irving, Rico Dowdle, Jalen McMillan (yeah, I\u2019ll count it), Darnell Mooney, Jerry Jeudy, Jauan Jennings, Jonnu Smith\u2026 whew! Is it hot in here, or what?\nAdvertisement\nThat\u2019s 11-for-15 free pick players who provided good-to-great value. Even tossing aside McMillan (late to emerge), c\u2019mon now, I think I can bask a bit. Fine, moving on. I\u2019m far from perfect \u2014 I hear those of you yelling about Jahan Dotson or C.J. Anderson. And, yes, there is even a wide receiver here who was in the piece last year for most of the same reasons.\nBut that\u2019s what this piece is about. Fun! The fun and joy of finding a free player \u2014 outside the Top 150, your final pick or two, or even your first waiver grab before the season \u2014 who becomes an every-week starter. The bonus is you get to look smarter than your leaguemates and shoot them that duck-crap-eating grin, as they can\u2019t figure out how you already had the player stashed. So, let\u2019s hope just five of these hit, as I likely jinxed the hell out of myself, and pulled a hammy while victory lapping so much.\nQuarterbacks\nBryce Young, QB, CAR: A new Young appeared after the Panthers\u2019 Week 11 bye. Well, maybe more of a \u201cBryce Young that I used to know\u201d \u2014 nothing like a Gotye callback in 2025. (You\u2019re welcome for that being in your head now). Anyway, Alabama Bryce showed up, ranking QB6 for the rest of the season and QB8 in FPPG (21.2). Young threw for 1,583 yards and 11 touchdowns with just 3 interceptions in seven games. Most importantly, Young called his number with 5 TDs on 28-for-178 rushing. Do I think Young will run for 12 touchdowns? No chance. However, the addition of Tetairoa McMillan helps Young\u2019s cause for continuing his improved play, and if he rushes for 400/6, a mere 3,500/20 passing line would, in most seasons, have Young finishing as a QB1.\nCam Ward, QB, TEN: Young doesn\u2019t interest you? How about a more aggressive passing version? Ward has similar rushing potential, where he sits in the 300-400 yards range, but with the upside for 5-8 touchdowns. Think early-career Dak Prescott. Actually, Prescott carries quite a few similarities, as Ward is more of a pocket passer than a dual-threat quarterback, with a great arm and downfield ability. Those pretty throws you\u2019ve seen in the preseason? Yeah, Ward has a higher ceiling than Young in passing yards and touchdowns. Yes, he\u2019s a rookie, and yes, Ward could struggle until Year 2. However, Bo Nix surprised a ton last year with 3,775/29 passing production and a 430/4 rushing line, and it\u2019s within Ward\u2019s ability to produce similarly.\nRunning Backs\nDylan Sampson, RB, CLE: We don\u2019t know when/if Quinshon Judkins will sign, we know Jerome Ford is a quality but replaceable running back, and we know Sampson has an interesting ceiling with a timeshare opportunity to start. Sampson draws some comparisons to Rachaad White, albeit a bit smaller. While that might make you groan because Bucky Irving made White a bench option, White on the Browns would raise more eyebrows, as should Sampson. He has more upside than Ford, and while it\u2019s no guarantee Sampson sees more opportunities than Ford (and eventually Judkins), he\u2019s a free pick with a clearer early path than most running backs in Round 14 of drafts.\nAdvertisement\nOllie Gordon, RB, MIA: If you\u2019re drafting this weekend, you might need to push Gordon near the Top 100. After all, Gordon should have been in the same range as Jaylen Wright for the past few weeks. We don\u2019t need to talk about Gordon being a possible first-round talent coming off his 2023 season. We need to talk about his being a better Raheem Mostert replacement than Wright, who, even if he filled that role himself, did everything he could to open the door and push Gordon through it this preseason. And now an injured Wright will miss at least Week 1. Given De\u2019Von Achane\u2019s injury history/risk, don\u2019t be surprised if this one-two punch is most like the 2023 Dolphins, and Gordon ends up an RB2.\nKyle Monangai, RB, CHI: Everyone wants to kick D\u2019Andre Swift to the curb, and while Swift hasn\u2019t shown the ability to produce at an elite level with 18-20 touches a week, he\u2019s a nice RB2/3. However, this is now a Ben Johnson team, which means someone will share with Swift. Roschon Johnson hasn\u2019t done much with his NFL opportunities, paving the way for Monangai to be the Bears\u2019 David Montgomery. I drew comparisons to Zack Moss during the NFL Draft process, and if he were in his prime and on the Bears, there would be a collection of people claiming Moss would be better than Swift this year.\nWoody Marks, RB, HOU: This backfield may turn stomachs all year. As of today, Nick Chubb is the lead, Dameon Pierce appears to be next up, given the preseason usage, and Joe Mixon might not be seen until late in the year. That\u2019s why Marks is a nice lottery ticket, if you\u2019re patient. As mentioned, he\u2019s behind Chubb and Pierce, but we know Chubb isn\u2019t what he once was, and Pierce hasn\u2019t looked anything like his rookie self since that 2022 campaign. Marks has Tyjae Spears-like appeal, which, similar to the Monangai/Moss argument, would garner many more eyes and interest in Marks if his name were Spears.\nWide Receivers\nChristian Kirk, WR, HOU: You know I\u2019m a Jayden Higgins fan, and I raised an eyebrow at reports of his being behind Xavier Hutchinson to start. After all, he\u2019s got a fully guaranteed second-round contract, and there were reports just three weeks ago that Higgins was locked into the No. 2 role. Hmm. In any case, if Higgins has to work his way into the No. 2 role \u2014 be patient, he will \u2014 Kirk is a great value to start the year. If you draft, say, Chris Godwin or Brandon Aiyuk, and need an early-season option, Kirk has always been productive when healthy.\nMarvin Mims, WR, DEN: Sean Payton plans to finally use Mims consistently. After last season, the question was why Payton didn\u2019t give Mims more snaps. Well, Mims is the No. 2 for the Broncos now, and if that doesn\u2019t change, Mims will be primed for a Year 3 breakout. Even if Nix merely repeats his rookie performance, Mims seeing 110+ targets would have him in the range of 900+ yards with a decent chunk of touchdowns (likely 7-8 or more). Mims would be a WR3 with weekly Top 20 potential \u2026 and he\u2019s free!\nAdvertisement\nCedric Tillman, WR, CLE: Speaking of similar production, let\u2019s not forget the 40 targets in a four-game stretch for Tillman last year. No, Tillman isn\u2019t going to have 170 targets, thereby making him a WR1. However, he has plenty of upside and big-play ability, and Joe Flacco might start most of the season (until the Browns decide to test Shedeur Sanders or Dillon Gabriel late in the season). Flacco has thrown for 4,483 yards in his past 17 starts. Yeah, bet you would have never guessed that.\nJoshua Palmer, WR, BUF: The Bills have a clear top-two receiver with Khalil Shakir, but the bigger play and touchdown upside option across from him is up for grabs between Palmer and Keon Coleman. While Coleman enters his second season with great aspirations, he\u2019s far from a lock to take a step forward. If Coleman leaves the door open, Palmer has proven to be a reliable NFL receiver when healthy. Being the No. 2 for Josh Allen carries Top 30 upside, even if it\u2019s more touchdown-reliant and rollercoastery (yeah, I made that a word) than Shakir.\nXavier Legette, WR, CAR: With Jalen Coker on IR, the question of who will be the No. 2 is answered. Coker and Legette might have cannibalized each other with Coker working the slot (Adam Thielen void) and Legette outside with more snaps. Now, Legette has every chance to solidify his role and put up WR4 numbers\u2026 assuming Bryce Young continues his solid play this season.\nDeMario Douglas, WR, NE: This is a pure volume play, but Stefon Diggs\u2019 health is in question \u2014 supposedly ready for Week 1, but how ready is still a question, as is the rapport level with Drake Maye. The rest of the Patriots receivers \u2014 Kayshon Boutte, Mack Hollins, Kyle Williams (deep on the depth chart for now), etc. \u2014 are in flux. The one certainty is Douglas\u2019 role. While Douglas would need 150 targets to be a WR1, he only needs 120 to be a WR3, and like everyone here, he\u2019s costing you nothing if he bombs.\nRoman Wilson, WR, PIT: The Steelers have yet to address the No. 2 wideout role via a trade or surprise signing. That leaves the job for Calvin Austin or Wilson, and while Austin has intriguing ability, I see him more as a team\u2019s No. 3 option. Mike Tomlin coached Wilson in Senior Bowl practice, asked him to face standout CB Quinyon Mitchell, then drafted Wilson in the third round. Wilson\u2019s rookie season was lost to injury, but with the No. 2 role available for the taking, Wilson can be Aaron Rodgers\u2019 No. 2. As toasty as Rodgers is, he provided value for both Garrett Wilson and Davante Adams last season.\nElic Ayomanor, WR, TEN: Ayomanor has to work his way up the depth chart, but he only has to pass the deteriorating Tyler Lockett and Van \u201cHey, I made a big play twice this year\u201d Jefferson. If Ward impresses as a rookie and provides anything close to the stat line above, Ayomanor can be the rookie wideout no one saw coming. After all, this player had no problem putting up big numbers against Travis Hunter last year.\nTre Harris, WR, LAC: With Keenan Allen signed, Harris goes from intriguing mid-late round sleeper to freebie stash. You need patience, but Quentin Johnston is still struggling with consistency and health, and there is a chance the Keenan Allen we saw last year is all that\u2019s left \u2014 as in, he\u2019s washed. That would leave the door open for Harris to step into the No. 2 role and provide the big-play ability the Chargers have been trying to get out of Johnston, which would be a fantasy WR4.\nAdvertisement\nIsaac TeSlaa, WR, DET: Let the Lions\u2019 multiple-picks trade to move up for TeSlaa make you take note. It\u2019s highly unlikely TeSlaa has fantasy relevance without an injury to Amon-Ra St. Brown or Jameson Williams (maybe Sam LaPorta, forcing more three-wide sets). Nevertheless, if that were to happen, TeSlaa would be the hottest pickup on waivers, similar to Jauan Jennings last year.\nTight Ends\nMason Taylor, TE, NYJ: Taylor has the talent to be in conversation with Colston Loveland for fantasy, but he has a significantly clearer path. In fact, given the Jets\u2019 wideout depth chart, it wouldn\u2019t be shocking if Taylor becomes the team\u2019s second-most valuable receiving option. Justin Fields looked Cole Kmet\u2019s way a good amount in the red zone \u2026 that one year. And while Fields has a checkered past of quarterback play, he can support two options, making Taylor a sneaky TE1 candidate.\nBrenton Strange, TE, JAX: Strange is in a similar situation to Loveland, as if Travis Hunter hits and Dyami Brown plays the boom/bust third receiver role with lots of three-wide formations, it will be hard for Strange to see enough volume. However, if Brown is the Brown we\u2019ve known (another Van Jefferson), and Hunter struggles with consistency, or even gets hurt, Strange as the second or third option for Trevor Lawrence could bring Evan Engram-like value.\nBackup running backs who shouldn\u2019t be on waivers (listed in team alphabetical order)\nTyler Allgeier, ATL; Trey Benson, ARI; Ray Davis, BUF; Rico Dowdle, CAR; DJ Giddens, IND; Tahj Brooks, CIN; Will Shipley, PHI; Tyjae Spears, TEN (stash him on the IR)\nFantasy Podcast: All In Speed Run\nStrategy and Last Minute Preseason News\nMy Favorite Early, Mid and Late Round Players\n(Photo of Marvin Mims: Elsa / Getty Images)"

      "text": "Many of last year\u2019s \u201cFree Guys\u201d were also in last year\u2019s Week 1 fantasy football waivers: Chuba Hubbard, J.K. Dobbins, Bucky Irving, Rico Dowdle, Jordan Mason, Darnell Mooney and Jerry Jeudy \u2014 even Khalil Shakir, Jakobi Meyers and more.\nThis isn\u2019t a \u201cmuwhahaha, I\u2019m the smartest man alive\u201d boast. There were plenty of waiver stashes who didn\u2019t hit, as well. I\u2019m merely pointing out that you shouldn\u2019t ignore potential value sitting on the waiver wire just because it\u2019s Week 1. Maximize your bench! Yes, you need a potential immediate starter or two, but you should be thinking about upside and breakouts.\nDo you have goose pimples? Are you having sleepless nights? The NFL is back!\nHEADS UP\n- Players must be under 60% rostered on Yahoo.\n- Listed in order of preference: I\u2019ll regularly prioritize potential upside over immediate replacement production.\n- RB backups have a separate secondary list based only on the lead option getting hurt.\n- No FAB suggestions: It varies wildly by league tendencies and is always relative (if you lost your RB1 to injury and there is a clear backup taking his role, you\u2019ll be more aggressive)\n- Streaming QBs and TEs are grouped. Once projections and ranks run, the weekly rankings can change, and DSTs could shift a bit, too.\n- Emojis for brevity:\n- \ud83d\ude0f = mentioned multiple times, multiple weeks \u2014 either you want him, or don\u2019t\n- \ud83e\udee1 = \u201cNext Man Up,\u201d but with deeper startability\nWORRY REPORT\n(Scale 1-5: more ducks = more worry)\n- Every week, starting in Week 2, I\u2019ll break down the biggest player concerns and determine whether the worry is warranted.\nPOWER UP PLAYERS\n(Scale 1-5: more Mario mushrooms = more excitement)\n- And every week, I\u2019ll touch on some of the biggest surprises and let you know if you should buy into the fun.\nSTREAMING QUARTERBACKS\n- Trevor Lawrence, JAX \u2014 The Panthers have a weak defense, and the Jaguars might not be better, meaning this could be a surprise shootout.\n- Bryce Young, CAR \u2014 QB1 potential\u2026 if he runs near the goal line as much as he did late last year.\n- Joe Flacco, CLE \u2014 Over 4,400 yards in his past 17 starts. Sneakiest gamble for a Top 10 finish.\n- Matthew Stafford, LAR \u2014 Always a threat for multiple touchdowns.\n- Tua Tagovailoa, MIA \u2014 As long as everyone is healthy, weekly Top 10 ceiling, albeit with a so-so floor.\n- Daniel Jones, IND \u2014 Rushing floor will always make Jones half-decent \u2014 even if that\u2019s what his passing ability is.\n- Michael Penix, ATL \u2014 If the Falcons can\u2019t stop Baker Mayfield and play aggressively to keep pace, Penix could be sneaky.\n- Geno Smith, LV \u2014 Solid, but likely better weeks to take a chance with Smith than against New England.\n- Cam Ward, TEN \u2014 Big arm. Big matchup problem.\n- Aaron Rodgers, PIT \u2014 Revenge? Meh. Still watching Rodgers feels like Montezuma\u2019s revenge.\n- Russell Wilson, NYG \u2014 Wilson has Nabers but limited fantasy appeal.\n- Sam Darnold, SEA \u2014 With how Darnold finished 2024, I\u2019d rather not risk him in Week 1.\n- Spencer Rattler, NO \u2014 Has yet to score 15 fantasy points.\nWAIVER WIRE RUNNING BACK RANKS\nNOTE: Everyone through Woody Marks has the potential for standalone value \u2014 even if in a timeshare. If you don\u2019t need that kind of value, my cutoff would be Bhayshul Tuten, and then I\u2019d dip into the pure handcuff options.\n- Ollie Gordon, MIA \u2014 Jaylen Wright is sidelined and looked awful this preseason. Gordon can be the Dolphins\u2019 version of David Montgomery.\n- Dylan Sampson, CLE \u2014 Quinshon Judkins still hasn\u2019t signed; Jerome Ford is quality but limited; and Sampson\u2019s role can remain productive no matter the situation. Sampson is like the Browns\u2019 version of Austin Ekeler. Until Judkins plays, Sampson is a timeshare piece with a nice burst and receiving upside. When Judkins is active, that won\u2019t change. In fact, Sampson has a chance to take the early lead and carry RB2 value.\n- Quinshon Judkins, CLE \u2014 I have no idea when he might play, but once Judkins is on the field, he\u2019ll have RB2 upside. He checks in before several timeshare pieces with potential immediate value. He\u2019s a longer-play gamble, but with one of the highest ceilings on the list.\n- Jerome Ford, CLE \u2014 Ford is solid, if not replaceable, but until Judkins is acclimated, Ford is a potential RB2/3. He\u2019s a solid grab for those needing early-season value. Just understand it could be limited value.\n- Najee Harris, LAC \u2014 Greg Roman loves using a second running back, and if Harris is 100%, he could have touchdown-reliant RB3 value. Plus, if Omarion Hampton gets hurt, Harris would be a rock-solid RB2.\n- Kyle Monangai, CHI \u2014 Monangai is another player with the potential to be another team\u2019s version of David Montgomery.\n- Rachaad White, TB \u2014 Just because Bucky Irving is amazing doesn\u2019t mean we ignore a potential RB3 in half- and full-PPR leagues, or worst case, a nice backup who would be an RB2 if Irving got hurt.\n- Chris Rodriguez, WSH \u2014 Jacory Croskey-Merritt is the favorite to lead, but don\u2019t forget that Ekeler will be consistently involved, and Rodriguez has upside and could surprise as the timeshare lead.\n- Jaydon Blue, DAL \u2014 Explosive. Receiving threat. Already banged up a few times, Blue has the ability for RB2 value if Javonte Williams is (still) toast.\n- Bhayshul Tuten, JAX \u2014 Also explosive. Upside to be the Jaguars\u2019 best fantasy option \u2014 albeit still in a timeshare.\n- Kareem Hunt, KC \u2014 Hunt could be the passing down option, an RB2/3 if Isiah Pacheco gets hurt again or one of your first drops.\n- Roschon Johnson, CHI \u2014 If it\u2019s not Monangai, maybe Johnson will finally play to expectations.\n- Kendre Miller, NO \u2014 Devin Neal may take the spot in time, but Miller is currently the No. 2 to Alvin Kamara.\n- Brashard Smith, KC \u2014 Potential for Jerick McKinnon-like role and value.\n- Kalel Mullings, TEN \u2014 With Tyjae Spears out, Mullings can use his power to be the next option behind Tony Pollard.\n- Woody Marks, HOU \u2014 Joe Mixon\u2019s season is a mystery. Nick Chubb is solid but not what he was years ago. Dameon Pierce has done little since his rookie year. Marks is a deep flier, but he has the burst and potential to be an RB2 and climb the ranks (like Tuten).\n- Tyjae Spears, TEN \u2014 The Titans got him involved late last year. Tony Pollard is good but not amazing, and Spears can be stashed in your IR as a \u201cbonus\u201d lotto ticket. He\u2019s only above the clear handcuffs because he should have a chance for standalone value once he\u2019s back.\n- Trey Benson, ARI \u2014 Benson has RB2+ value if James Conner misses time, and there is a chance the Cardinals could timeshare their backfield at this point in Conner\u2019s career.\n- Tyler Allgeier, ATL \u2014 Was a top-end RB2 before Bijan Robinson arrived and would be again if he\u2019s needed to replace Robinson.\n- Ray Davis, BUF \u2014 Davis has RB2 value if James Cook gets hurt.\n- DJ Giddens, IND \u2014 Jonathan Taylor has missed time each of the past three seasons, and Giddens would step in with RB2+ value.\n- Rico Dowdle, CAR \u2014 Limited ceiling but can be a mid-low RB2 if Chuba Hubbard is hurt.\n- Tahj Brooks, CIN \u2014 Chase Brown\u2019s replacement if anything happens.\n- Will Shipley, PHI \u2014 The Saquon Barkley backup. Enough said.\n- Dameon Pierce, HOU \u2014 Currently next up behind Chubb, and maybe he looks something like his rookie year. But there\u2019s also a good chance he\u2019s waiver fodder.\n- Blake Corum, LAR \u2014 I believe the Rams could timeshare Corum and Jarquez Hunter if Kyren Williams missed time, but it sounds like Corum would lead the way.\n- Chris Brooks, GB \u2014 Atop the backup depth chart behind Josh Jacobs, for now.\n- Jarquez Hunter, LAR \u2014 As mentioned, he could timeshare with Corum if Williams is out. Given Hunter\u2019s ability, it also wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if he led and not Corum.\nPURELY NEXT MAN UP RANKS\n(if an injury ahead of them)\n- Brian Robinson, SF (don\u2019t normally include over 60% but several asked)\n- Trey Benson, ARI\n- Tyler Allgeier, ATL\n- Najee Harris, LAC\n- Ollie Gordon, MIA\n- Tyjae Spears, TEN\n- Rachaad White, TB\n- Ray Davis, BUF\n- DJ Giddens, IND\n- Chris Rodriguez, WSH\n- Rico Dowdle, CAR\n- Tahj Brooks, CIN\n- Jaydon Blue, DAL\n- Will Shipley, PHI\n- Blake Corum, LAR\n- Kendre Miller, NO\n- Chris Brooks, GB\nWAIVER WIRE WIDE RECEIVER RANKS\nNOTE: Once you\u2019re through Legette, if you don\u2019t need potential early-season value, I\u2019d drop down to Jayden Higgins and others after him for a few pure-upside, lottery-ticket stashes.\n- Brandon Aiyuk, SF \u2014 I\u2019m assuming the only leagues where Aiyuk isn\u2019t stashed are ones without IR spots. Otherwise, Aiyuk\u2019s Top 20 potential needs to be on rosters.\n- Cedric Tillman, CLE \u2014 Terrific four-game stretch last year, and with Joe Flacco at quarterback, Tillman is in the WR4 boom/bust group.\n- Darnell Mooney, ATL \u2014 This one is weird. Raheem Morris said they hope to have Mooney \u2026 this year. And that was just a few weeks ago. Now, it sounds as though Mooney is a possibility for Week 1. If Mooney is healthy, he\u2019s a weekly boom/bust WR4 and a near must-start in 3-WR leagues.\n- Marvin Mims, DEN \u2014 Mims is one of many here in the \u201cFree Guys\u201d piece. Mims is the No. 2 and his upside brings WR4 potential similar to Mooney.\n- Joshua Palmer, BUF \u2014 Palmer is more than worth a roster stash if he\u2019s a top-two option over Keon Coleman.\n- Romeo Doubs, GB \u2014 Jayden Reed has a Jones fracture in his foot, which opens the doors for Doubs and his downfield upside to be a top-two option with Matthew Golden \u2026 hopefully, more consistently than in 2024.\n- Xavier Legette, CAR \u2014 Jalen Coker has a severe quad strain, which has him on the IR, clearing up the uncertainty around the No. 2 option alongside Tetairoa McMillan.\n- Christian Kirk, HOU \u2014 I believe in Jayden Higgins \u2014 more on him shortly \u2014 but if you have Aiyuk or Chris Godwin and need more immediate production than ceiling, Kirk is the pickup.\n- Keenan Allen, LAC \u2014 He might be one of the first waiver cuts, but Allen could rebound back in L.A. as Justin Herbert\u2019s No. 2.\n- DeMario Douglas, NE \u2014 With Stefon Diggs\u2019 health a question and the other wideouts failing to force their way into a starting role, Douglas has a shot to be a WR3/4 in half- and full-PPR.\n- Adam Thielen, MIN \u2014 Just like Kirk, Thielen is an early-season option, but he has a much more definitive \u201cend date\u201d with Jordan Addison back in Week 4.\n- Roman Wilson, PIT \u2014 Another \u201cFree Guys\u201d mention, as Wilson has every chance to be the No. 2 for the Steelers. Although there is risk, as I\u2019ll mention with his teammate below.\n- Amari Cooper, LV \u2014 Raiders\u2019 version of Keenan Allen.\n- Hollywood Brown, KC \u2014 With Rashee Rice suspended, Brown has the chance for boom/bust value, and you know managers will overreact if he has a huge Week 1.\n- Tyler Lockett, TEN \u2014 Sure, he looked donezo last year, but Cam Ward is talented enough to make more than Calvin Ridley useful.\n- Rashod Bateman, BAL \u2014 I hear people say that Bateman is a great WR5. I disagree. You never, ever, evvvverrrrr know when to play Bateman unless DeAndre Hopkins is a non-factor and Lamar Jackson throws 41 touchdowns again. Truthfully, Mooney and Bateman were a Spider-Man-pointing GIF last year. However, Hopkins just adds another possibility to Bateman hitting those 2-to-4-point floors more often.\n- Jayden Higgins, HOU \u2014 If he\u2019s Marvin Jones, who is my comp, Higgins can be a WR3 in fantasy. It may take a few weeks, but I\u2019d stash that potential anywhere I could.\n- Isaac TeSlaa, DET \u2014 In my \u201cFree Guys\u201d column and more than worth your attention if something happened to Amon-Ra St. Brown or Jameson Williams.\n- Calvin Austin, PIT \u2014 Austin averaged over 15 YPR last year and has some intrigue, but Wilson has the higher ceiling and more complete wideout profile. However, if Wilson doesn\u2019t lock in the No. 2 role and Austin has it, there would be WR5 value here.\n- Elic Ayomanor, TEN \u2014 Lots of \u201cFree Guys\u201d here. Back to Lockett. If he is done, then Ayomanor can step up as the No. 2 and be a surprise WR4 in his rookie year.\n- Tory Horton, SEA \u2014 If Cooper Kupp doesn\u2019t return to form or misses time (again), Horton has WR4 potential as the No. 2 for Sam Darnold.\n- Tre Harris, LAC \u2014 Harris is a long-term stash. If Allen doesn\u2019t rebound, Harris can step into the No. 2 role.\n- Dont\u2019e Thornton, LV \u2014 Big play waiting to happen (over 25 YPR final year in college). Stash where you can in case he gets a top-two role either via his play and Cooper being washed or a Jakobi Meyers trade during the season.\n- Luther Burden, CHI \u2014 Long-term stash, and he may not hit until 2026 \u2014 like Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Rome Odunze in their rookie seasons.\n- Wan\u2019Dale Robinson, NYG \u2014 Even in full-PPR, I don\u2019t value Robinson too highly unless you want a floor WR4. After all, he was just WR46 in FPPG on 140 targets.\n- Alec Pierce, IND \u2014 You know he has downfield ability, but Pierce is a stash while Michael Pittman is healthy and until Anthony Richardson is the quarterback.\n- Darius Slayton, NYG \u2014 Never know when to start him \u2014 well, basically never given his two double-digit games last year \u2014 but if Slayton ends up the No. 2 and pushes Robinson into obscurity, there is deeper league value.\n- Pat Bryant, DEN \u2014 Fits the big slot role for Sean Payton\u2019s offense, but needs to develop to move up the depth chart.\nSTREAMING TIGHT ENDS\n- Hunter Henry, NE \u2014 With the Patriots\u2019 receiving corps still in flux, Henry is a decent half- and full-PPR play.\n- Zach Ertz, WSH \u2014 If you want to make sure you don\u2019t get skunked.\n- Brenton Strange, JAX \u2014 In a Henry-type situation, especially if Travis Hunter doesn\u2019t come out of the gate strong.\n- Darren Waller, MIA \u2014 The week\u2019s biggest boom/bust play.\n- Mason Taylor, NYJ \u2014 Upside and the ability to be the second-best receiving option for the Jets.\n- Jonnu Smith, PIT \u2014 Who knows if Smith will see enough work to be startable, but similar to Henry and Taylor, he could be the second option.\n- Theo Johnson, NYG \u2014 Athletic matchup problem\u2026 if the Giants utilize him.\n- Ja\u2019Tavion Sanders, CAR \u2014 Another major matchup problem, and with Thielen gone and Coker out, Sanders could see decent work.\nSTREAMING DSTs\n(first team is streamer)\nWeek 1\n- ARI at NO\n- CIN at CLE\n- LAR vs HOU\n- SF at SEA\n- CHI vs MIN\n- NYJ vs PIT\n- WSH vs NYG\n- GB vs DET\n- NE vs LV\nWeek 2\n- SF at NO\n- ARI vs CAR\n- LAR at TEN\n- SEA at PIT\n- LAC at LV\n- GB vs WSH\n(Photo of Cedric Tillman: Jason Miller / Getty Images)"

      "text": "Growing up in Ontario, Canada, Chase Brown wasn\u2019t exactly born into an environment ripe for developing NFL stars.\nChase, along with his twin brother Sydney, shifted among homeless shelters, relatives\u2019 residences, and eventually countries.\nNo matter where Chase lay his head down, he fixated on one mission.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cMy whole life I\u2019ve always wanted to play in the NFL,\u201d he said. \u201cGrowing up in Canada, it seems like the NFL has always been this impossible dream.\u201d\nHe promises he wasn\u2019t \u201cdelusional\u201d back then, but always had a belief he\u2019d make it despite the long odds.\nAs his journey moved from living with his mom in Ontario to a junior year of high school with a host family at St. Stephen High School in Florida to one year at Western Michigan and, eventually, four seasons at the University of Illinois, there was only one constant in his pursuit of the impossible. It was a constant that would fuel his rise from backup to timeshare to breakout star on an offense already full of them over his first two seasons in the NFL.\n\u201cI\u2019m just kind of addicted to seeing the results of putting in the work,\u201d he said, then pinpointing the why at the core of his drive. \u201cTo prove to my younger self that you can really be that guy, be a dude in this league.\u201d\nThe Bengals are betting big that he already is one after coming off an offseason where determination produced more results.\n\u201cAdd another monster to the fire,\u201d linebacker Logan Wilson said.\nPlayers putting in the work is an NFL clich\u00e9. Nearly everyone brings a level of competitive drive. It\u2019s a prerequisite for landing among the greatest 1,696 players in the world.\nBut from Brown\u2019s earliest moments in Cincinnati, those in the building took notice. Yeah, Brown was merely a fifth-round pick from the 2023 draft and buried on the depth chart.\nHis motivation defined him.\n\u201cThere are guys that it just becomes how they carry themselves, the look in their eye when you talk to him, how you see him go about their day in the building, that it just becomes apparent very, very early that this guy is obsessive about his preparation,\u201d offensive coordinator Dan Pitcher said. \u201cThere\u2019s something motivating him that\u2019s unusual even at this level of highly, highly motivated people. And I would put him in that bucket.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThat\u2019s why Pitcher can\u2019t stop making bold claims about the third-year back.\n\u201cI believe Chase Brown is a top-10 back in this league,\u201d Pitcher said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a guy.\u201d\nBelief stems from watching him seize the role of breakout star in the second half of last season. From Week 9, when Brown took the full-time job from injured Zack Moss until he got hurt at the conclusion of a Week 17 win against Denver, Brown ranked fifth in the NFL in yards from scrimmage \u2014 only two spots and 29 yards behind his triple-crown-winning teammate Ja\u2019Marr Chase.\nHe ripped off five consecutive games with 100-plus yards from scrimmage. Not only did he win friends in fantasy leagues, but he won them across the Bengals\u2019 locker room.\nBrown calls it making himself \u201cundeniable.\u201d Others call it watching a player set the example for how you work in the background, waiting for your chance to arrive.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to compare him with anybody,\u201d running backs coach Justin Hill said. \u201cYou are not going to find anybody in the building that works harder than him. There is not a day, work day or off day, that he is not in the building working on something. Whether pass game, run game, he wants to find something to get better at. It\u2019s in his DNA. The sky is the limit for him because of his work ethic.\u201d\nDrew Lieberman called it. Hired as a personal wide receiver coach for Brown and Andrei Iosivas before last season, he couldn\u2019t believe the progress. He saw the breakout coming.\n\u201cThe fastest improvement of any players I\u2019ve ever had in the program of 15 years doing this,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a transformation like it.\u201d\nBrown took a note from head coach Zac Taylor in his rookie season debrief meeting on becoming a better receiver and didn\u2019t just train with Lieberman, but followed him. Whether early morning or late night in Atlanta, on a business trip to Las Vegas, they found a field to fit in sessions. Before OTAs, after minicamp, you name it.\nAdvertisement\nBrown always worked. The difference in this case was that he worked with a direct purpose.\n\u201cI always worked really hard, but maybe not necessarily in the right way,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI\u2019m always lifting and doing work, but I never put a lot of time into actual football, so I\u2019ve always seen results in that sense as far as pushing my body in the gym and just doing speed work, but in the NFL, I never really pushed myself really hard as a football player.\u201d\nHe felt the impact immediately despite sharing time with Moss. The highlight of his rookie season was becoming the second-fastest ball carrier in the league that year, crossing 22 mph on a 64-yard touchdown run. The first eight weeks of last season, Brown averaged 4.6 yards per carry on 94 rushes while Moss averaged 3.3 yards per carry on 97.\nHe caught 16 passes, but couldn\u2019t find the explosiveness he hoped to create.\nOnce Moss went down with a neck injury, the entire dynamic changed. Brown wasn\u2019t just racking up yards \u2014 157 that Sunday, to be exact. He racked up reps with Joe Burrow.\nBrown didn\u2019t see much time on passing downs in his split with Moss. Coaches stressed the importance of learning that skill and liked what they\u2019d seen from him in practices and a small sample size, but when it came to protecting QB1, lack of experience shifted those duties to the veteran.\nOnce Brown took over 100 percent of the workload, the work he put into perfecting pass protection built trust with the quarterback and coaching staff.\n\u201cThe nuances of it, the technique of it, the eye progression of it has improved over the early part of last season, all the way through last season,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cAnd you feel outstanding about it.\u201d\nThat development also uncovered what quickly became one of the offense\u2019s most potent weapons.\nBrown\u2019s off-script chemistry with Burrow amped up as plays broke down, and they often did last season.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to TruMedia, over the second half of last season on plays where the quarterback held the ball for at least 3.5 seconds, Brown led all running backs in receiving yards. It wasn\u2019t close.\nHe caught 11 passes for 114 yards, eight first downs, five explosives and two touchdowns.\nJoe so \ud83c\udd92 in the pocket\n\ud83d\udcfa: #CINvsTEN on FOX\n\ud83d\udcf1: https://t.co/waVpO909ge pic.twitter.com/uwcByaGyaV\u2014 NFL (@NFL) December 15, 2024\nNo other running back produced more than 69 yards in those situations.\nThe plays added a new element to the entire Bengals offense.\n\u201cI just have this weird sense for like if I see Joe roll out like there\u2019s something that just goes off internally where it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, here we go, this is what I\u2019ve been waiting for,'\u201d Brown said. \u201cUnless it\u2019s a designed play to me, I just wait for the scramble drill because a lot of my routes are underneath and I\u2019m able to kind of run around and make some plays off that.\u201d\nBrown took his development from last season and returned to Lieberman this offseason with a renewed focus on route running, trying to elevate on-script to match his off-script magic.\nThe Bengals responded accordingly. OTAs and training camp were filled with splitting Brown outside and testing matchups against safeties and linebackers. This grew far beyond the typical choice routes coming out of the backfield. This was true receiver usage.\n\u201cSplitting out as a receiver and having a real understanding of what our receivers go through and what Joe is going to see \u2014 he\u2019s become really valuable in that way,\u201d Taylor said.\nBrown\u2019s motivation led the charge again.\nChase Brown the wide receiver??\nNice contested catch from Brown on this throw from Joe Burrow.#Bengals @FOX19 pic.twitter.com/43FeWsK7vf\n\u2014 Gabi Sorrentino (@GSorrentinoTV) August 15, 2025\nOne practice, he ran a route down the sideline and it wasn\u2019t tight enough to create a completion. After practice, Brown shifted to another field and ran it another 10 times, catching passes from a staffer until he got it right.\nAdvertisement\nLater in camp, there he was, catching nearly every route imaginable, even against tight coverage down the sideline, matched up against Wilson.\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to separate himself in the receiving game, and he\u2019s going to be a problem this season,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cHe\u2019s done a lot of work to get better at route running. He\u2019s a true receiving threat wherever he is at on the field at all times.\u201d\nHis improvement in the area allowed Taylor and Pitcher to comfortably expand those chapters of the playbook.\n\u201cHis willingness and relentlessness to work in different areas of his game, catching the football, running routes, pass protecting, everybody knows how big a part of playing running back that is for us,\u201d Pitcher said. \u201cIf you want to be the one who is on the field for the bulk of early downs, you got to be able to block a nickel off the edge, block a Mike in the B gap, we know that. And so how he\u2019s taken that and really taken it to heart. And it\u2019s not perfect, but he\u2019s shown us that he can do it. I\u2019ve said a lot of really good things about him, and I\u2019ve meant every one, and I\u2019ll say them again. He\u2019s a big part of what we\u2019re going to do here.\u201d\nBrown still only averaged 4.2 yards per carry despite his monster second half. Among qualifying backs, he finished second-best in percentage of runs for zero or negative yards. His runs weren\u2019t getting blown up. Yet, considering his athleticism and explosiveness with the ball, he wasn\u2019t breaking long runs.\nHe ranked 28th out of 31 qualifiers in percentage of runs going for 10-plus yards.\nThe Bengals moved on from offensive line coach and run game coordinator Frank Pollack this offseason. Pitcher assembled a collective of his staff to tweak a run game to be built around Brown\u2019s skill set.\n\u201cWe tried to simplify and just find ways to do more with less and find ways to get him the ball downhill,\u201d Hill said. \u201cWe tweaked how we do things in the mid-zone or wide zone game because of him.\u201d\nCHASE BROWN, TOUCHDOWN TOWN. #CINvsWAS on @espn pic.twitter.com/L5o6zLNBaF\n\u2014 Cincinnati Bengals (@Bengals) August 19, 2025\nBrown wasn\u2019t even the feature back when they imagined the run game last year. Knowing his style and connecting that with the scheme allowed for an exciting new chapter for this offense on the ground. One that increases the number of explosive runs by taking advantage of Brown\u2019s speed, vision and acceleration to the point of attack.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe have a lot of guys on staff that have done parts of (building a run game) at different stops in their career,\u201d Pitcher said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s kind of listening to them, really delving into it myself and trying to come up with something that really complements who we are and what our engine is.\u201d\nThis season, the engine is known.\nLife changed for Brown since he last played in a regular-season game. Yes, he added more prominent endorsements from the likes of NuEnergy and Nike, growing his profile beyond posts about poutine and football.\nHe became a dad for the first time on Jan. 22 with the birth of his son, Oceanz.\nHe enjoys lying around for naps and can\u2019t get over the \u201cblessing\u201d that opened his eyes.\nWhile the mind wanders during those naps, there\u2019s plenty of time to contemplate his family\u2019s future and the fact that he\u2019ll be extension-eligible after this season. He\u2019ll enter a market where refusal to pay running backs is no longer en vogue. Saquon Barkley leads the way at $20 million per year and the top backs are all making $10 million-plus.\nThe last thing Bengals fans need to worry about is another extension negotiation conversation.\nBrown\u2019s approach stayed on brand, though. Put in the work, let results follow.\n\u201cIn the back of my mind, I\u2019ve thought about it,\u201d Brown said. \u201cBut what I\u2019ve done with that this year is I\u2019m \u2014 and I\u2019m being completely honest when I say this \u2014 I\u2019m trying to just focus on making the plays. If I make the plays, I\u2019ll make myself undeniable for a second contract.\u201d\nUndeniable, indeed.\nHe could reach rarified air just by replicating last season\u2019s breakout. Extrapolating his numbers from the second half of last season over a full year would put him well over 1,000 yards rushing and 500 receiving.\nOnly two backs have accomplished both in a season since 2020: Jahmyr Gibbs and Christian McCaffrey.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt\u2019s realistic,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of making those plays and check the stats after. I think it\u2019s a real conversation.\u201d\nThe conversation continues to build around the 25-year-old. He needs to prove he can do it again, and this time for a full season. The Bengals have seen enough and are building around it. As you might expect, Brown has no doubt. The piercing image of that younger version of himself chasing the impossible dream won\u2019t let him.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had this self-confidence to a point where I knew I could do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI just gotta figure out how I\u2019m gonna get there. I always knew I could play in the NFL. I always knew I could make a difference on a football team somewhere, but it\u2019s really just figuring out, like, the middle ground. Once I get my foot in the door, I\u2019m gonna figure out a way to really show everybody why they drafted me and why they should trust me with the ball in my hands.\u201d\n(Top photo: Eric Hartline / Imagn Images)"

      "text": "The Jets finally built a brick wall up front after many \u2014 so, so many \u2014 years of trying. They also feel like they have the running backs to burst through that wall like the Kool-Aid man.\nA deep offensive line built through high draft picks and prudent free-agent signings, an intriguing backfield featuring three ball-carriers with varying skillsets, a running quarterback unlike one this organization has ever employed, and a coaching staff with designs on an offense built to run it down your throat.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe want to be a fast, physical, and violent outfit,\u201d offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand said.\nA year ago, this was one of the worst rushing attacks in the NFL, and a big reason for that was simple: They rarely ran it. Some of that was because of inconsistencies in the run blocking and in the way the backs were running the ball, but most of it was because the Jets employed a quarterback in Aaron Rodgers keen on throwing the ball as often as possible. The Jets had the fewest rushing attempts in the NFL last season. They only ran the ball 27.5 percent of the time in the red zone, far and away the lowest in the NFL \u2014 nearly 10 percentage points lower than the Bengals, the second least-run-heavy attack. There\u2019s an argument that the Jets running game was bad for a lack of trying.\nThat won\u2019t be the case in 2025, not with Aaron Glenn leading the way, not with the way the Jets are designing their offense, and not with the pieces they brought into the fold \u2014 and the pieces they brought back from last year\u2019s roster. There was frustration among players on both sides of the ball with how infrequently (and often ineffectively) the Jets ran last season. If that wasn\u2019t clear already, it has been in the way players have been talking about the new scheme and renewed focus on establishing the run. Suffice to say: They\u2019re excited.\n\u201cI love running the ball, man,\u201d said left guard John Simpson. \u201cThat\u2019s my strong suit. I\u2019m excited for the opportunity to come out here and just run the ball. All the other stuff will come. If we can run the ball, we\u2019ll win a lot of games.\u201d\nAdded running back Breece Hall: \u201cFrom a whole offensive standpoint we\u2019re all really bought into this run scheme. I think it fits our backs more, I think it makes more sense to the guys up front.\u201d\nThere was a variety of factors that propagated the issues in their rushing attack last year, including the aforementioned Rodgers factor \u2014 he often checked out of running plays even though the Jets, per TruMedia, faced the smallest percentage of stacked boxes (11.6 percent) in the NFL. But that list also includes a lack of creativity in play-calling, especially when Nathaniel Hackett was running things, and an offensive line that wasn\u2019t buying into the style or approach of their position coach, Keith Carter.\nAdvertisement\nGlenn has designs on recreating what made the Lions offense so successful over the last few years in Detroit, with an even heavier emphasis on the run, cultivating a scheme that better fits his new quarterback (Fields) than his old one (Jared Goff). From that Lions staff, Glenn hired Tanner Engstrand as his offensive coordinator and Steve Heiden as his offensive line coach.\nHeiden, curiously, was the Lions\u2019 tight ends coach and has only coached offensive line briefly in the NFL (in 2018 with the Cardinals), but the word out of Detroit is that he was heavily involved in cultivating the game plan for the running game and his responsibilities extended beyond his position group. The Lions had the fourth-best rushing offense in the NFL over the last two years. Scheme-wise, there will be an emphasis on wide-zone runs which, in simple terms, is predicated around the offensive line moving together laterally at the snap and forcing the defense to flow in the same direction of the offensive line, creating cut-back opportunities for the running back. The goal is to open up creases for the back to attack \u2014 and so the Jets\u2019 backs (namely Breece Hall) need to do a better job of attacking those holes when they come than they did a year ago.\n\u201cThe offense is similar to what we did my freshman year at Wisconsin. It\u2019s very familiar for me, it\u2019s very natural,\u201d running back Braelon Allen said.\nCenter Joe Tippmann said the offensive line\u2019s responsibilities are different in this offense than in the last one.\n\u201cWhat we were doing before, there was a lot of getting out wide and running. Now it\u2019s tighter landmarks and more downhill,\u201d Tippmann said. \u201cAs an offensive lineman you want to be able to get your feet in the ground and put pressure into the guy across from you. I\u2019d say that\u2019s a big difference for me.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nGlenn\u2019s pursuit of recreating the Lions offense \u2014 especially the running game \u2014 goes beyond scheme too. The Jets prioritized drafting a prospect they could plug right in at right tackle, and Armand Membou was at the top of his list for the combination of his size, strength and athleticism. Internally, the Jets view Membou as someone who is ready to make an impact in the running game right away while working through some growing pains as a pass-blocker. Simpson\u2019s strength is in the running game, and the trio of left tackle Olu Fashanu, center Joe Tippmann (battling with veteran Josh Myers to start) and right guard Alijah Vera-Tucker have all combined to open up holes throughout training camp. The passing offense has looked inconsistent, but the running game has looked dominant at times.\n\u201cThat group is taking on the identity of what AG talks about,\u201d Engstrand said. \u201cI think they are taking that to heart and they are playing with that mentality. Which you\u2019re seeing \u2014 we\u2019re finding some lanes and getting some movement up front, but we\u2019ve got some really good players out there, too, like we talked about in the spring. I really like where that group is going right now.\u201d\nSaid Glenn: \u201cEvery offensive lineman that I know, man, they want to get downhill and smash somebody. And that\u2019s what our guys can do.\u201d\nIn addition to the offensive line, Glenn made it a point to add (and bring back) wide receivers with a willingness to get in the mix and block in the running game. It was the first thing that came out of Glenn\u2019s mouth in March when he was asked why they signed wide receiver Josh Reynolds, and the No. 1 reason the Jets (surprisingly) brought back Allen Lazard. Glenn has also emphasized how impressed he\u2019s been with tight end Mason Taylor\u2019s blocking ability in camp \u2014 and backup Jeremy Ruckert\u2019s primary role will likely be as a blocker too.\nThe expression \u201cno block, no rock\u201d might as well be painted on the walls of the wide receiver room. \u201cReceivers gotta be able to block,\u201d said wide receiver Tyler Johnson. \u201cYou gotta do the dirty work.\u201d\nGarrett Wilson, the Jets\u2019 star receiver, is excited about the prospect of a running game actually opening things up in the passing game \u2014 especially important since the Jets don\u2019t have a whole lot of threats to scare opposing defenses and draw attention away from Wilson.\n\u201cThe better we can run the ball with the running backs we got, Justin\u2019s ability to run the ball, the more push we can get, the more we can run the ball on second and short and convert, that stuff is going to open up everything for us,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cBy the time we get into the season hopefully we\u2019re rolling.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThat point about converting from short distances is important because, again, the Jets rarely ran the ball from short distances last season despite having the personnel (namely running back Braelon Allen) to do so. The Jets had the fewest rushing attempts with two yards or fewer to a first down (44) in the NFL \u2014 while the Lions ranked eighth.\nAnd that gets to the other most important reason to believe in the Jets\u2019 ability to run the ball in 2025: The running back room.\nSince the early days of Glenn\u2019s tenure, he\u2019s emphasized that this won\u2019t be a one-back offense \u2014 he views the trio of Hall, Allen and Isaiah Davis as a three-headed monster, all three with varying skillsets. He comes from Detroit, where the Lions first split carries between D\u2019Andre Swift and Jamaal Williams and then, more effectively, between Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery. The skillsets, to a degree, line up in comparison to the Jets\u2019 running back room \u2014 Hall should play the role of Gibbs, an explosive runner and threat in the passing game. Hackett famously admitted late in the 2023 season that he didn\u2019t realize Hall could be an effective pass-catcher until halfway through the season.\nGlenn won\u2019t be making that mistake. Hall has the most receiving yards (1,074) and third-most receiving touchdowns (seven) among all running backs over the last two years. \u201cWe are going to open his game up quite a bit,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cHe\u2019s the type of guy that you can split out wide and let him run the route tree, because he can run it like a receiver. And I like that matchup with him against a safety or a linebacker.\u201d\nIn this comparison, Allen can be the Montgomery type \u2014 a big, strong, downhill runner that should thrive in the trenches. Allen has been a standout in camp and looks more explosive than he did as a 20-year-old rookie. He ran for 334 yards, two touchdowns and only averaged 3.6 yards per carry last year, though the Jets got away from him as the season progressed \u2014 he had more than six carries in a game only twice after Week 8.\n\u201cBraelon is a 240-pound man that\u2019s always falling forward,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cListen, that\u2019s where he\u2019s going to make his money. I\u2019m not just saying in short yardage, those downhill runs, it\u2019s going to weigh on defensive players, and when you continue to do that, you just create something as far as a team, as far as an identity, that this league will take notice of, and I\u2019m looking forward to that.\u201d\nThe Jets have the ability \u2014 especially in light of a potentially thin receiving corps \u2014 to deploy Allen and Hall on the field at the same time too. Even if they don\u2019t, their skillsets are varied enough that, at their best, they can keep the defense off balance. It\u2019s not unike Gibbs and Montgomery, who weren\u2019t often on the field at the same time but still balanced each other out.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThat\u2019s two different dynamics that you have to get ready for when it comes to a defense getting ready to play against those guys,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cSo, as a guy that has been coaching on defense for the most part, I know the issues that come with that and being able to game plan when this guy comes in the game or when this other guy comes in the game.\u201d\nThe difference between this backfield and the one in Detroit: The Jets feel like they have a third starting-caliber running back in Isaiah Davis, who flashed as a fifth-round rookie last year. Davis averaged 5.8 yards per carry, albeit on limited touches (30 rushes). \u201cHe brings everything,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cPass protection, his ability to run, his route tree, he\u2019s a smart player, he\u2019s tough, he\u2019s aggressive. He\u2019s a valuable piece of what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d\nAnd if anyone wants to believe in the Jets\u2019 ability to be one of the best rushing attacks in the NFL, the conversation includes Fields. Even after dealing with his toe injury (the one that caused an unnecessary stir), Fields has shown a level of mobility the Jets haven\u2019t really had at quarterback \u2026 ever? During Saturday\u2019s scrimmage, Fields scored an easy touchdown on a zone-read on one play, and scrambled for a long touchdown on another when he spotted a hole in the defense after a dropback.\nFinally, the Jets should not only have a running game to reckon with \u2014 they have one that will be their identity.\n(Photo of Breece Hall: John Jones / Imagn Images)"

      "text": "RENTON, Wash. \u2014 The Seattle Seahawks have changed a lot on offense in the past several months, and if all goes according to plan, Ken Walker III stands to be the biggest beneficiary.\nWalker is Seattle\u2019s most explosive offensive player. He\u2019s capable of scoring from anywhere on the field. The fourth-year running back has four plays of at least 50 yards since joining the team as a second-round pick in 2022. Not many other guys on the team have proven to be that dangerous. Zach Charbonnet had a 51-yard touchdown run last year, and Jaxon Smith-Njigba had a couple of 46-yard receptions, but they can\u2019t necessarily turn on the jets the same way Walker can.\nAdvertisement\nWalker\u2019s explosiveness pops off the screen when he\u2019s making jump cuts and accelerating to the second level of the defense. His speed is next level: He has maxed out at over 20 mph on 11 plays in his career, which is far more than any current Seahawk \u2014 the next closest is Marquez Valdes-Scantling with two \u2014 and top 10 among skill players since 2022 (all stats provided by TruMedia unless stated otherwise). Walker has a different gear than most guys in the league.\nSeahawks players and coaches have been saying for months that the run game will be their bread and butter. New offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak\u2019s predecessors said the same thing. Walker, who\u2019s on his third coordinator in four years, said he believes Kubiak is more of a man of his word because of how often the Seahawks have been practicing run plays compared to previous seasons.\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s going to be a physical offense, and we know what we want our identity to be,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI like the aspect of running the ball, but also getting out of the backfield and catching the ball. It\u2019s great.\u201d\nIf Kubiak\u2019s unit can walk the walk to back up the talk from this summer, Walker should have a big year in this scheme, which is built around a perimeter attack but also has changeups to keep the defense honest. Walker\u2019s ability to make quick decisions, explode upfield and punish defensive backs who take poor angles should be on full display in this system.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got all types of schemes that we can do, but I feel like I\u2019m just an explosive back, and we can make plays,\u201d Walker said.\nWalker came on strong as a rookie when given the opportunity to be the lead back. He had a 69-yard rushing touchdown against the New Orleans Saints right after Rashaad Penny went down with a leg fracture. On that play, Walker quickly found a cutback lane and was off to the races, untouched. Two weeks later, Walker found the edge on a toss play and ran 74 yards to the house against the Los Angeles Chargers. He finished second in Offensive Rookie of the Year voting.\nKENNETH. WALKER. TO. THE. HOUSE. \ud83c\udfe0\n\ud83d\udcfa: #SEAvsLAC on FOX\n\ud83d\udcf1: Stream on NFL+ https://t.co/HyjkGpXIek pic.twitter.com/znsicu868r\u2014 NFL (@NFL) October 23, 2022\nOver the past two seasons, Walker has run behind bad offensive lines and played for coordinators committed to pass-centric offenses. It\u2019s hard for any running back to thrive under those circumstances. Sure, Walker can turn nothing into something as well as anyone, but Seattle can\u2019t build an offensive identity around his improvisational skills. Walker and all the other running backs must be able to trust that their blockers will create creases and allow them to generate explosive plays.\nAdvertisement\nSeattle\u2019s offensive lines haven\u2019t been reliable in that way. There are 44 NFL running backs with at least 200 carries over the past two seasons. Walker\u2019s carries have gone for zero or negative yards at the fifth-highest rate (21.5 percent). Charbonnet has the eighth-highest rate (20.6). Charbonnet ranks 32nd in yards before contact per carry in that span, and Walker ranks 39th. Simply having a league-average run blocking unit would do wonders for Seattle\u2019s running backs this season.\nWalker has been dealing with foot soreness and appears to be on a maintenance schedule that sprinkles in days off. He was a full participant in Tuesday\u2019s padded practice, but it\u2019s unclear if he\u2019ll suit up with the rest of the starters against the Kansas City Chiefs on Friday night.\n\u201cWe have a plan for Ken, and we\u2019re sticking to the plan,\u201d coach Mike Macdonald said of Walker being in and out of the lineup during camp.\nStill, there were encouraging signs from the first-team offense in the preseason opener against the Las Vegas Raiders. The starters up front were, from left to right: Josh Jones, Grey Zabel, Jalen Sundell, Anthony Bradford and Abe Lucas. That unit played two drives and paved the way for George Holani to rush for 61 yards and a touchdown on seven attempts. It\u2019s not hard to envision what Walker would be able to do if the blocking were that effective with him on the field.\nRookie fullback Robbie Outzs impacted the run game against the Raiders, and his presence should also help Walker. A fair critique of Walker\u2019s game to this point is his inconsistent vision, as he does not always hit runs as designed. With Ouzts leading the way, Walker\u2019s job should be even easier. He said playing with a fullback is like having an \u201cextra set of eyes\u201d in the run game. The scheme is running-back-friendly in that way.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t see it, and if he can see it, I can just follow him, and he just takes me,\u201d Walker said. \u201cEven if we don\u2019t hit the right hole, if we hit it 100 percent, it still can make the play.\u201d\nIt\u2019s difficult to project how running back carries will be split. The last two offensive coordinators have treated Walker like the lead guy and Charbonnet as the backup on early downs. Charbonnet is the better pass protector, so he has gotten most of the snaps in obvious passing situations and two-minute drills.\nThe setup should be similar this season, given how explosive Walker has looked in practice. But it\u2019s worth noting that when Kubiak was asked during a KIRO-AM radio interview to list the qualities that make up an elite running back in today\u2019s game, he spoke highly of Charbonnet.\n\u201cNo. 1 is intelligence,\u201d Kubiak said. \u201cNo. 2 is availability, guys that are available the whole game. The best backs I\u2019ve been around are super smart. Guys that you give them difficult game plans, and they can go out and make adjustments. Our top two guys are doing really good things, but Charbonnet, his mental approach to the game is extremely impressive. He does not flinch. If he ever has a question, you know you didn\u2019t coach it good enough, because he\u2019s that on it.\u201d\nThe availability piece will be key for Walker, who was limited to just 11 games last season due to oblique, ankle and calf injuries (he was inactive only four times in his first two years).\nKyle Shanahan\u2019s 49ers are often used as a point of reference when describing Seattle\u2019s new scheme. Another good comparison, especially when assessing Walker\u2019s home run potential, is what the scheme has done for speedsters like De\u2019Von Achane and Raheem Mostert in Miami. The Dolphins\u2019 usage of fullback Alec Ingold in that perimeter-based run game illustrates what this offense can do for Walker, health permitting.\n\u201cI know (Walker) hasn\u2019t been to every practice, but the ones he\u2019s been able to attend, you see the flashes of his talent,\u201d Kubiak said Tuesday. \u201cHe was out there today making plays in the pass game and the run game. I see him continuing to get better with reps.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nEven if Walker doesn\u2019t play Friday night, Seattle\u2019s second preseason game is another good test for the first-team offense (I don\u2019t expect left tackle Charles Cross or center Olu Oluwatimi to play). A second consecutive outing running the ball effectively would offer another data point to suggest that this year will be different. And if so, that\u2019s great news for Walker, who\u2019s entering the final year of his rookie deal.\n\u201cI just want to be positive and keep my mind on football and not a contract and all that,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI just want to make a positive impact on my team and go out there and play to the best of my ability. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been wanting to do from my rookie year until now. I\u2019m going to just keep that same mindset and not worry about (my) contract and everything.\u201d\nAs for playing in a run-first offense in a contract year, Walker said: \u201cThere\u2019s more opportunities for me to show what I can do on the field.\u201d\n(Photo: Lindsey Wasson / Associated Press)"

      "text": "Editor\u2019s note: This article is part of our Countdown to Kickoff series, in which we highlight the NFL\u2019s top teams, players, predictions and storylines to watch as the 2025 season begins.\nThe NFL regular season kicks off Thursday with the Dallas Cowboys visiting the Philadelphia Eagles for a prime-time matchup. The Eagles, of course, are the defending Super Bowl champions. The Cowboys, of course, just made massive waves for trading All-Pro linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers.\nAdvertisement\nWe\u2019ll see plenty of headlines about both teams this season, but before the action begins, let\u2019s have some fun with some bold predictions for everyone. We asked our NFL writers to think big with one prediction for each of the league\u2019s 32 teams.\nArizona Cardinals: Cardinals are NFC\u2019s last remaining undefeated team\nThe Cardinals will be a playoff contender in Year 3 under Jonathan Gannon \u2014 but only if they get off to a quick start. They should have the offensive weapons, defensive improvement and schedule to do so. Arizona opens at New Orleans, before returning home to face Carolina. From there, it visits San Francisco, hosts Seattle and Tennessee and travels to Indianapolis. Nothing in the NFL is easy, especially for a team that hasn\u2019t won a playoff game since 2015, but the Cardinals could be 6-0 entering their Oct. 19 game against Green Bay. \u2014 Doug Haller\nAtlanta Falcons: Michael Penix Jr. exceeds 30 touchdown passes\nThat would be a tenfold increase from Penix\u2019s rookie season, when he started three games after taking over for Kirk Cousins. Penix\u2019s consistent accuracy remains a question mark \u2014 he completed only 58 percent of his passes in his three starts last year \u2014 but he\u2019s going to be aggressive, and Rams-trained offensive coordinator Zac Robinson will give him plenty of opportunities. Penix was eighth in the league in passing yards (723) after taking over the starting job last season. \u2014 Josh Kendall\nBaltimore Ravens: Kyle Hamilton wins NFL Defensive Player of Year\nThis award is typically dominated by pass rushers, but Denver\u2019s Patrick Surtain II showed last year that defensive backs can win it with spectacular seasons. Hamilton is certainly capable of making that type of impact. The Ravens\u2019 selection of Georgia safety Malaki Starks in the first round will allow defensive coordinator Zach Orr to push Hamilton back into the matchup/roving role that he flourished in during the 2023 season. It also will allow Hamilton to play closer to the line of scrimmage, which should lead to more production with sacks, tackles for loss and forced turnovers. \u2014 Jeff Zrebiec\nAdvertisement\nBuffalo Bills: T.J. Sanders becomes one of Bills\u2019 most important defenders by playoffs\nIf there is one common thread running through the Bills\u2019 playoff losses since 2020, it\u2019s that they haven\u2019t been able to generate enough pressure when it matters most. Enter Sanders, a rookie defensive tackle who was the No. 41 pick. He had an extremely impressive summer and flashed some immediate ceiling-level pass-rushing ability against good offensive linemen. He may not be a starter, but his game shows someone who could be on the field in passing downs next to starter Ed Oliver in their most significant moments. That could potentially give the Bills their most potent interior pass-rushing duo since head coach Sean McDermott arrived in 2017. \u2014 Joe Buscaglia\nCarolina Panthers: Tetairoa McMillan will finish with 1,000 receiving yards\nThe Panthers already were counting on McMillan to be a big part of the offense \u2014 and that was before Adam Thielen was traded to Minnesota and Jalen Coker injured his quad. With Coker expected to miss 4 to 6 weeks and Hunter Renfrow still getting his legs under him after a yearlong absence from the NFL, Bryce Young will rely heavily on Xavier Legette and the 6-foot-5 McMillan. The two built early chemistry with a pre-draft throwing session in California that helped convince the Panthers to take McMillan with the eighth pick. \u2014 Joseph Person\nChicago Bears: D\u2019Andre Swift tops 1,500 yards from scrimmage\nComing off a season in which he averaged a career-low 3.8 yards per carry, there\u2019s not enough buzz about what Swift can become for the Bears\u2019 offense this season. There is little proven backfield depth behind him. Plus, he is reunited with a play caller whose marriage to the running game is devoted. Ben Johnson produced a different 1,000-yard rusher \u2014 Jamaal Williams, David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs \u2014 in each of his three seasons calling plays in Detroit. Now, Swift is next in line. And with a need for the Bears to reduce the weight quarterback Caleb Williams must carry, Swift\u2019s opportunities as both a ball carrier and pass catcher will be plentiful. \u2014 Dan Wiederer\nCincinnati Bengals: Chase Brown leads AFC in yards from scrimmage\nBrown took over the starting job in Week 9 last year, and from then through Week 17 finished fifth in the NFL in yards from scrimmage, only two spots and 29 yards behind triple-crown-winning teammate Ja\u2019Marr Chase. Extrapolate to a full season and that\u2019s 1,976 scrimmage yards. Now, the Bengals won\u2019t give him the same nearly 100 percent workload of that stretch, but it won\u2019t be too far off. They also restructured the run game specifically around his skill set to increase his 4.3 yards per carry and are utilizing him more split out wide versus linebackers. With constant focus on Chase and Tee Higgins, Brown will see open space all season. \u2014 Paul Dehner Jr.\nCleveland Browns: At least three different quarterbacks start games\nI don\u2019t know how bold this really is considering team owner Jimmy Haslam said on record in late July that the Browns need to evaluate their two rookie quarterbacks before next year\u2019s draft \u2014 and that head coach Kevin Stefanski knows that. But Week 1 starter Joe Flacco is 40, and this Browns team is much more likely to be near the bottom of the league than the playoff race by November. Eleven times since their 1999 return to the NFL, the Browns have had at least three starting quarterbacks. Let\u2019s count on that becoming 12 times and another streak extending after five players started at the role in 2023 and four last year. \u2014 Zac Jackson\nAdvertisement\nDallas Cowboys: WR KaVontae Turpin scores at least 8 touchdowns\nDallas\u2019 standout returner scored on a punt and a kickoff return last season. He also caught a career-high 31 passes for 420 yards and two more TDs. Look for Turpin to remain arguably the NFL\u2019s best returner but be even more involved in Brian Schottenheimer\u2019s offense. While trying to keep things looking as basic as possible throughout training camp, the head coach and offensive play caller used Turpin in a variety of ways, from handing him the ball as a running back to being a big-play option down the field in the passing game. CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens will likely be Dallas\u2019 top scorers this year, but Turpin is in position to have his most impactful season to date. \u2014 Jon Machota\nDenver Broncos: Broncos win the AFC West\nDenver has not won its division in 10 years. The last nine titles belong to the Kansas City Chiefs, who will probably be viewed as the favorites as long as Andy Reid and Patrick Mahomes are working together. But Denver has its most complete roster since winning the Super Bowl in 2015. Its defense may be football\u2019s best after adding Dre Greenlaw and Talanoa Hufanga to a unit that was already first in EPA per snap in 2024. Bo Nix is coming off an impressive rookie season and now has more pass-catching targets (hello, Evan Engram) and a running game that should be much improved thanks to the additions of RJ Harvey and JK Dobbins. The West will be a gauntlet, but the Broncos, in Sean Payton\u2019s third season, have enough to finally loosen Kansas City\u2019s dominant grip on the division. \u2014 Nick Kosmider\nDetroit Lions: Brian Branch is a Defensive Player of the Year finalist\nThe easy name here is Aidan Hutchinson, but that\u2019s not exactly bold now is it? Branch, in many ways, is equally as important to this defense as Hutchinson. He shifts between safety or nickel depending on what the offense is showing. His instincts are off the charts, he hits like a linebacker and covers like a cornerback. It seems like new defensive coordinator Kelvin Sheppard has been sending Branch on blitzes more often in practice, so that aggression could lead to some sacks. He was arguably the most impressive player in training camp for the Lions, and this defense has a chance to be among the NFL\u2019s best. Not likely, but not impossible. \u2014 Colton Pouncy\nGreen Bay Packers: Matthew Golden wins Offensive Rookie of the Year\nThe first-round rookie wide receiver already looks like the Packers\u2019 best wideout in camp. His hands, especially, stand out. Maybe that\u2019s just because the Packers dropped a boatload of passes last season, but the 22-year-old\u2019s talent has been evident, nonetheless. General manager Brian Gutekunst said Golden makes a play or two each practice that lets you know he\u2019ll have a future in the NFL. On a team with a litany of injuries at receiver, Golden should get plenty of opportunities from the jump and only pick up steam from there. The only question is will the Packers pass the ball enough, and enough to him when they\u2019d be justified in spreading it around, for Golden to have a shot at winning Offensive Rookie of the Year? \u2014 Matt Schneidman\nHouston Texans: C.J. Stroud reinserts himself into MVP conversation\nThe Texans\u2019 young quarterback rebounds in a big way after a sophomore slump that had a lot to do with an inept offensive line, injury-riddled wide receiving unit and struggles of former offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik. Stroud finds comfort in a new system behind a revamped line and capitalizes on the arrival of rookie wide receiver Jayden Higgins, seeing a spike in touchdown passes and decrease in interceptions while guiding the Texans to another AFC South title and one of the top records in the conference as a whole. \u2014 Mike Jones\nIndianapolis Colts: Colts win the AFC South\nThe Colts haven\u2019t made the playoffs since 2020 and haven\u2019t won the AFC South since 2014. Daniel Jones will end both of those droughts (or at least the Colts hope). The ex-Giants starter has been named QB1 again in Indianapolis, and one undeniable way for Jones to revive his career is to lead his new team to a division title. Colts GM Chris Ballard compared Jones to former Chiefs Pro Bowler Alex Smith, which is very high praise. If Jones lives up to that hype, the Colts will be hosting a home playoff game in January. \u2014 James Boyd\nJacksonville Jaguars: Travis Hunter finishes in top five for Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year\nAs a receiver, Hunter will have 1,000 yards from scrimmage and six touchdowns. And when he moonlights at corner, Hunter will pick off four passes, returning one for a touchdown. He\u2019ll have one game with a TD on both sides of the ball. \u2014 Jeff Howe\nAdvertisement\nKansas City Chiefs: Defense is top three in sacks in 2025\nK.C. finished tied for 18th with 39 sacks last season. So why might there be hope for a huge jump this season? For one, the underlying stats are on the Chiefs\u2019 side; pressures are more reliable year to year than sacks, and teammates Chris Jones and George Karlaftis remained elite in that category a season ago. Add in a more healthy Charles Omenihu \u2014 he\u2019s now 1 1/2 years removed from knee surgery \u2014 and an emerging defensive end rookie in Ashton Gillotte, and the Chiefs could easily end up with one of the NFL\u2019s top pass rushes. \u2014 Jesse Newell\nLas Vegas Raiders: Geno Smith is a top-10 quarterback\nSmith hit this level in 2022, but his production took a step down in each of the two last seasons. With Ashton Jeanty, Brock Bowers, Jakobi Meyers and Amari Cooper in tow, he has plenty of weapons at his disposal on offense. Offensive coordinator Chip Kelly seems to have grown since his last stint in the NFL, and the offensive line could be good enough to get by. The Raiders are playing Smith below-average quarterback money, so this coming to fruition would be a big win for them. \u2014 Tashan Reed\nLos Angeles Chargers: Omarion Hampton finishes top five in the league in rushing\nThe Chargers are determined to create a more consistent running game in 2025, and their most important step toward achieving that was drafting Hampton in the first round. He is the complete package as a runner. He is physical and violent, especially at the end of the runs. He has the long speed and explosiveness to score from anywhere on the field. Najee Harris, whom the Chargers signed in free agency, is back in practice after missing all of training camp because of an eye injury he suffered in a July 4 fireworks accident. There are still questions about how much Harris will be able to contribute. Hampton has a chance to be a very productive workhorse. I believe offensive coordinator Greg Roman is going to feed the rookie as he tries to elevate the running game in Year 2 with the Chargers. \u2014 Daniel Popper\nLos Angeles Rams: Rams go from near worst to top-10 in run defense\nLast season, the Rams defense ranked No. 30 in the NFL in run defense EPA, per TruMedia. L.A. allowed 2,948 rushing yards, also 30th, for a whopping 4.8 yards per carry. Simply put, failing to defend the run cost the team multiple games in 2024. This offseason, the Rams signed nose tackle Poona Ford, among the league\u2019s best run defenders, in free agency and added inside linebacker Nate Landman. Defensive tackle Tyler Davis has also taken a visible step forward as depth behind Ford, and the Rams added promising undrafted free agent Shaun Dolac. One of these moves in a vacuum may not bring forth dramatic improvement, but if I\u2019m making a bold prediction, all of them in combination should bring the Rams up into the top 10 in run defense this season. \u2014 Jourdan Rodrigue\nMiami Dolphins: Jaylen Waddle becomes WR1 in Miami\nIt kind of feels like people have forgotten about Waddle, doesn\u2019t it? After a breakout sophomore campaign that included 75 receptions, 1,356 yards and eight touchdowns \u2014 how did he not make the Pro Bowl that year? \u2014 he seemed poised for superstardom, and then, things sort of just tailed off. Injuries, to him and QB Tua Tagovailoa the past couple of years, can explain some of his statistical regression. But with both healthy right now and Tyreek Hill nearing the end of his elite run, I think Waddle is due for a big bounce-back season with coach Mike McDaniel funneling more of his offense through him. Let\u2019s go bold and say the 26-year-old catches 90 passes for 1,400 yards and 8 TDs as he officially becomes Miami\u2019s new No. 1 target. \u2014 Jim Ayello\nMinnesota Vikings: Jonathan Greenard wins NFL Defensive Player of the Year\nLast year, in his first season in defensive coordinator Brian Flores\u2019 system, Greenard was one of two NFL edge rushers to record more than 50 pressures, more than 10 sacks, more than 25 run stops and more than 10 run stuffs. The other player who accomplished the feat? Myles Garrett. The Vikings added interior defenders Jonathan Allen and Javon Hargrave to the mix. Their inclusion should mean more one-on-one opportunities for Greenard, who is still only 28. He has dominated Vikings training camp, and he looks as formidable as any defender has since coach Kevin O\u2019Connell arrived. This is bold. But you asked for bold. \u2014 Alec Lewis\nNew England Patriots: TreVeyon Henderson is a 1,000-yard rusher\nThe Patriots have a crowded backfield with Henderson, their second-round pick, joining established backs Rhamondre Stevenson and Antonio Gibson. From the outside, it has all the makings of another Patriots running back rotation. Except for the part where Henderson looks like easily the team\u2019s best offensive weapon. He has outperformed both Stevenson and Gibson in practice. He has a speed they can\u2019t match. And he has impressed Patriots brass with his ability to run between the tackles, not just to the outside. Look for Henderson to become a star. \u2014 Chad Graff\nAdvertisement\nNew Orleans Saints: Saints end up with No. 1 pick in 2026 NFL Draft\nThe Athletic\u2019s Austin Mock projects 5.2 wins for the Saints this season, which is the lowest projection in the NFL. The reasons behind that? Let\u2019s start with the worst quarterback situation in the league, with Spencer Rattler as the starter (0-6 as a starter last year). The Saints surely hoped 2025 second-rounder Tyler Shough would win the QB job, and that didn\u2019t happen. Oddsmakers also have the Saints favored to win only one game this season (against the Jets in Week 16). The rest of the offensive pieces aren\u2019t great and the defense isn\u2019t what it used to be. A tough hand for first-year coach Kellen Moore. At least this means Moore will have his choice of QBs in the 2026 draft class. \u2014 Larry Holder\nNew York Giants: Jaxson Dart starts by Week 5\nGiants brass has told everyone who will listen since the draft that Russell Wilson is the unquestioned starting quarterback and the plan is for first-round pick Jaxson Dart to develop behind the scenes. It sounds awfully familiar to 2019 when the plan was for Eli Manning to start with Daniel Jones on the bench \u2026 and then Jones took over after an 0-2 start. Manning was a franchise icon with far more equity than Wilson, who is on his fourth team in five years. If the Giants stumble against a killer early schedule, they won\u2019t wait long to replace Wilson with Dart, who looked ready in the preseason. \u2014 Dan Duggan\nNew York Jets: Braelon Allen leads the Jets in rushing\nThe Jets ranked last in the NFL in rush attempts last year. I expect them to finish in the top five in 2025 \u2014 if not at the top \u2014 and that\u2019s both for a combination of scheme (it will be a run-heavy offensive attack) and personnel led by quarterback Justin Fields. There\u2019s an assumption that Breece Hall is the Jets\u2019 top running back but when the games start and Aaron Glenn and Tanner Engstrand start divvying up the carries, I truly think at some point (perhaps early) Allen will become the predominant ball carrier in the running back room. That\u2019s not to say Hall\u2019s role will diminish \u2014 he might be the Jets\u2019 No. 2 option in the passing game at the moment \u2014 but Allen throughout the summer has looked like the better, stronger, more explosive runner. \u2014 Zack Rosenblatt\nPhiladelphia Eagles: Jalen Hurts passes for 4,000 yards\nThere were six quarterbacks who eclipsed 4,000 passing yards last season, so why is this bold? Well, did you watch the Eagles play last season? They led the NFL in rushing and Hurts attempted only 361 passes \u2014 177 fewer than in 2023 \u2014 while totaling only 2,903 yards. It would be a big leap to expect him to become a 4,000-yard passer in 2025. But the Eagles should pass the ball more this season than last season, and Hurts has the offensive weapons (A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith, Dallas Goedert, and Saquon Barkley) to be prolific through the air. A 1,100-yard jump in passing production might be ambitious, although Hurts was on a 4,000-yard pace in 2022. \u2014 Zach Berman\nPittsburgh Steelers: DK Metcalf catches 10-plus touchdowns\nEach Steelers practice begins with a drill called Seven Shots \u2014 a series of seven snaps from the 2-yard line. Throughout training camp, quarterback Aaron Rodgers continuously targeted Metcalf in this period. Rodgers still has the lightning-quick release to throw the ball into tight windows, especially near the goal line. Metcalf\u2019s 6-foot-4, 230-pound frame and physical playing style has helped him beat defensive backs on slants, outs and other quick hitters. The fact that the Steelers don\u2019t have a clear-cut No. 2 receiver also helps Metcalf\u2019s cause. Without a lot of depth at the position, Metcalf should see a significant target share \u2014 and maybe even a career best \u2014 in this new-look Steelers offense. \u2014 Mike DeFabo\nSan Francisco 49ers: Brock Purdy, at 30-to-1, wins MVP award\nThe 49ers have the (healthy) star power, coaching, young defensive talent and easy schedule to bounce back from last year\u2019s 6-11 record and make a playoff run. Christian McCaffrey and George Kittle can\u2019t win MVP, because one\u2019s a running back and the other is a tight end. Purdy has the talent and narrative \u2014 going from Mr. Irrelevant to newly paid franchise QB, plus will get even more credit as the Niners are patching together their receiving corps to start the season. Oh, and we almost forgot: The 49ers just signed Marquez Valdes-Scantling. Four of the last five NFL MVPs had MVS on their Week 1 roster: Aaron Rodgers, Rodgers again, Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen. \u2014 Vic Tafur\nSeattle Seahawks: Seahawks have No. 1 scoring defense\nSeattle finished 11th by this metric last season, and fifth in opponent points per drive. Another year in coach Mike Macdonald\u2019s system while also returning nearly all the starters from last year \u2014 minus the swap of Dre\u2019Mont Jones for DeMarcus Lawrence, which is an upgrade \u2014 should put Seattle in position to field the league\u2019s stingiest defense. The Seahawks haven\u2019t had the No. 1 scoring defense since 2015, but with better depth playing beside Pro Bowlers Devon Witherspoon and Leonard Williams, things are lining up for Seattle to make a return to the top of the defensive rankings. \u2014 Michael-Shawn Dugar\nAdvertisement\nTampa Bay Buccaneers: Calijah Kancey leads NFL in defensive tackle sacks\nThe 2023 first-round pick has made steady progress in his first two years in the league, but Kancey hasn\u2019t taken off partly because he has been held back by recurring calf injuries. Last season, he had 7 1/2 sacks but played only 12 games. The Bucs have worked diligently to keep him healthy in 2025, and he responded with an excellent training camp. At 280 pounds, Kancey is unlike any interior rusher in the league. Kancey\u2019s quickness should be enhanced by the outside rush of Haason Reddick, who has the ability to give the Bucs something they didn\u2019t have in Kancey\u2019s first two seasons. \u2014 Dan Pompei\nTennessee Titans: Jeffery Simmons has 12-sack season\nThe preseason included more emotional outbursts from Simmons, including a shove of rookie quarterback Cam Ward in practice, and these are reminders that he\u2019s not always the perfect leader for the Titans. He is still their best player, and he zipped past would-be blockers in the preseason with a slimmed-down frame. It\u2019s the right move for a player who wants one more significant contract and knows sack production can help \u2014 his career high is 8 1/2, set in 2021, the most dominant season of his career. If T\u2019Vondre Sweat takes a step in his second season, that pairing will be the strength of the team and Simmons will have more opportunities to get home. \u2014 Joe Rexrode\nWashington Commanders: CB Trey Amos has five interceptions\nThe Commanders selected Amos with the 61st pick in the draft, a position they believe was a steal; he was in the mix of players they considered taking in the first round. After four months on the field with Washington, the reasons are clear. Amos plays more like a polished veteran than a first-year player, largely because of his technique. He\u2019s also more versatile than he maybe gets credit for, benefitting from playing in three major college programs (Louisiana, Alabama and Ole Miss). Since the AFL-NFL merger, only three defensive backs for Washington have recorded at least five picks in their first season: Tom Carter (1993), Champ Bailey (1999) and Fred Smoot (2001). Amos could be next. \u2014 Nicki Jhabvala\nCountdown to Kickoff is part of a partnership with NFL Sunday Ticket from YouTube TV.\nThe Athletic maintains full editorial independence.

      "text": "Read Dane Brugler\u2019s previous summer scouting reports here: Quarterbacks | Running backs\nThe 2024 NFL Draft was loaded at wide receiver with three top-10 picks and 10 receivers drafted in the first 37 selections. The upcoming class of pass catchers for the 2025 NFL Draft doesn\u2019t look nearly as top-heavy, but wide receiver should once again be one of the bright spots of the class.\nAdvertisement\nAfter studying this class, three receivers stood alone as potential top-half-of-the-first-round prospects, and I\u2019m expecting all three to battle for WR1 status throughout this season. Colorado\u2019s two-way weapon Travis Hunter will be considered a wide receiver on some draft boards and a corner on others. Regardless, he can be a high-level NFL starter at either spot.\n(Note: An asterisk represents a draft-eligible underclassman. Heights and weights are what NFL teams currently have on file for each player, with \u201cv\u201d representing verified measurements and \u201ce\u201d for estimates.)\n1. Tetairoa McMillan, Arizona (6-5e, 210e)*\nWhat he does best: Expansive catch radius\nWhen I study pass catchers, an abbreviation I use in my notes is \u201cGGI,\u201d which stands for \u201cGo and get it\u201d skills. After studying five of McMillan\u2019s tapes from last season, I found myself jotting down those three letters over and over. With his body flexibility and length, McMillan can contort his frame, high-point or reach back and snare the ball before the defender has a chance to make a play. The only FBS players with more first-down receptions last season were 2024 first-round picks Rome Odunze and Malik Nabers.\nLast season, McMillan saw 130 targets and registered only two drops. He catches the easy ones \u2014 and makes the hard ones look easy.\nMust improve: Route refinement\nAlthough he doesn\u2019t have elite top-end speed, McMillan has controlled footwork and short-area quickness to break off patterns. However, he can sharpen some of the details of his route running, specifically his body leverage. Due to his height, McMillan tends to make himself too large of a target versus press and can do a better job sinking at the top of routes.\nAdvertisement\n2024 season/2025 NFL Draft outlook\nAfter growing up in Hawaii, McMillan played his high school ball in California and developed into a top-50 recruit. He originally committed to Oregon before flipping to Arizona (joining several of his high school teammates) and becoming the highest-ranked recruit in school history. McMillan delivered his breakout season as a sophomore in 2023, joining Nabers and Odunze as the only three FBS players with at least 90 catches, 1,400 receiving yards and 10 touchdown grabs.\nNot coincidentally, McMillan\u2019s emergence last season coincided with Arizona doubling its win total from five in 2022 to 10 in 2023. Coach Jedd Fisch departed for the Washington job this offseason, but Arizona retained McMillan, quarterback Noah Fifita (McMillan\u2019s high school quarterback) and several other key players, as the program transitions to the Big 12 under new head coach Brent Brennan.\nI want to see added strength and route refinement from McMillan in 2024, but he has high-level catch-point skills with better-than-expected agility after the catch. McMillan has the talent to be the first pass catcher drafted next April.\n2. Luther Burden III, Missouri (5-11e, 210e)*\nWhat he does best: Acceleration and finishing skills\nWatching Burden this summer brought on flashbacks of Ja\u2019Marr Chase at LSU. With his burst and foot speed, Burden can effortlessly climb over the top of coverage or destroy pursuit angles as a catch-and-run weapon. His athleticism is one half of what makes him so dangerous; the other half is his physicality as a finisher and ball winner (just like Chase).\nBurden was one of five FBS receivers with at least 22 receptions of 20-plus yards in 2023, including this touchdown against South Carolina. On a \u201cmiddle read\u201d route, he immediately gains leverage on the post-snap coverage and splits the defenders with his route acceleration. Burden finishes by tracking and taking the football from a crowded catch point.\nMust improve: Production outside the numbers\nWorking primarily out of the slot last season, Burden saw a ton of soft coverage with plenty of space to operate. Considering his twitchy athleticism and play strength, I have no doubt he can beat press coverage on the outside, but that is more of a projection right now. Of his 86 catches in 2023, just 15 came outside the numbers.\nAdvertisement\n2024 season/2025 NFL Draft outlook\nOne of the prizes of the 2022 recruiting class, Burden had offers from everywhere in the country. He was always in the sights of Missouri, though, which offered him a scholarship his freshman year of high school. He committed to Oklahoma at one point, then was considered a Georgia lean before deciding to stay home and play for the Tigers. Despite dealing with roller coaster quarterback play, Burden produced a promising freshman year before emerging as one of the best players in the SEC as a sophomore. He finished last season with 86 catches for 1,212 yards and nine touchdowns.\nWith Burden and Theo Wease, Missouri returns one of the better receiver duos in college football. With continued consistency from quarterback Brady Cook, the Tigers have a chance to earn a College Football Playoff spot. And Burden will be in the mix for WR1 next April.\n3. Travis Hunter, Colorado (6-0 1/8v, 181v)*\nWhat he does best: Instinctive ball skills\nThe initial takeaway from Hunter\u2019s film is his quick-twitch athleticism \u2014 before and after the catch. But the most important takeaways after watching multiple tapes are his instinctive ball adjustments and hand-eye coordination to track and pluck the football from various angles.\nAlthough there are far flashier plays on his tape, this rep is a lot more difficult than it looks. Against zone, Hunter works 10-12 yards before sitting down near the sticks. The ball is already out of Shedeur Sanders\u2019 hand before Hunter turns his head, and he has a half-second to find, frame and finish cleanly away from his body. This is very natural for him.\nMust improve: Play strength\nDespite his lean-muscled frame, Hunter is surprisingly strong downfield with the ball in the air. But facing NFL corners in press, mid-route and at the catch point will be a tougher challenge, and scouts are hoping to see him add more bulk for those matchups.\n2024 season/2025 NFL Draft outlook\nIs Hunter a wide receiver or a cornerback prospect? Both. And that is not a cop-out answer, but the correct answer. The consensus No. 1 recruit in the 2022 high school class, Hunter made waves when he signed with FCS Jackson State and head coach Deion Sanders for his freshman season. He followed Coach Prime to Colorado last season and immediately became one of the most electrifying playmakers in the FBS.\nFrom both skill and stamina standpoints, it is remarkable to see Hunter deliver such an impact on both sides of the football. He played 100-plus total snaps in seven of nine games last season, including a crazy 162 against Stanford. There is plenty of split opinion around the league on Hunter\u2019s best long-term position, but there is zero doubt he is one of the best prospects in the 2025 NFL Draft.\nGO DEEPER\nWho are the 2025 NFL Draft's top underclassman prospects? Travis Hunter leads stacked class\n4. Isaiah Bond, Texas (5-11e, 180e)*\nWhat he does best: Easy acceleration\nAs a junior in high school, Bond won the Georgia 6A 100 meters (10.51 seconds) and 200 meters (21.19), and that speed translates to the football field. With his ability to quickly go from 0 to 60, he closes cushion in a blink to win vertically. Bond also shows the twitch at the break point to separate and easily recapture his acceleration.\nAdvertisement\nOn this touchdown play, Alabama uses a play-action pass switch release, and Bond\u2019s route acceleration down the seam catches the coverage off balance.\nMust improve: Elusiveness as a ball carrier\nFor an athlete with his speed and fluidity, Bond didn\u2019t put a lot of make-you-miss moments on his 2023 film, averaging just 4.6 yards after catch per reception as a sophomore. In coach Steve Sarkisian\u2019s quick-game offense, Bond will run plenty of screens and shallows from the slot. He needs to maximize potential gains with his ability to give defenders the slip, especially in the open field.\n2024 season/2025 NFL Draft outlook\nA dynamic receiver, cornerback and track athlete in high school, Bond was a top-50 recruit and one of the top signees in Alabama\u2019s 2022 class. He became a starter as a sophomore last season and led the Tide in receptions (48), as his chemistry with Jalen Milroe started to blossom. However, Bond made a \u201cbusiness decision\u201d this offseason with his transfer to Austin, for the sole purpose of boosting his NFL Draft stock after Nick Saban\u2019s retirement announcement.\nThe Longhorns had five players with 25-plus receptions last season, and all five are now in the NFL, including early-round picks Xavier Worthy and Adonai Mitchell. But Texas returns a potential first-rounder at quarterback (Quinn Ewers) and a veteran offensive line, making Bond\u2019s arrival an ideal fit for both sides. Going into his junior season, the stage is set for the Alabama transfer to earn first-round grades.\n5. Emeka Egbuka, Ohio State (6-0 7/8v, 203v)\nWhat he does best: Route manipulation\nAlthough he returned for one more season of college football, Egbuka already plays at a pro level in several areas, including his football IQ and ball skills. But what stands out most on film is his ability to manipulate mid-route, using subtleties and savvy pacing to draw coverage where he wants.\nDue to Egbuka\u2019s injury last season, you have to return to the 2022 tape to best understand his skill set. On this rep versus Rutgers, he has no problem tying the defensive back in knots \u2014 the defender being Christian Izien, who played well as a rookie nickel with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2023.\nMust improve: College resume on the outside\nEgbuka played almost 75 percent of his snaps in the slot last season and figures to work predominantly inside again in 2024. But he is expected to move around more this upcoming season, as the Buckeyes replace Marvin Harrison Jr. and Julian Fleming and introduce new receivers, including freshman star Jeremiah Smith. Egbuka was an outside-only receiver in high school, so seeing snaps out wide isn\u2019t foreign by any means, but putting more reps on tape outside the numbers or against press will he helpful for his evaluation.\nAdvertisement\n2024 season/2025 NFL Draft outlook\nThere were several big-time talents in the 2021 high school recruiting class, including first-rounders Harrison, Nabers, Brian Thomas Jr. and Worthy. None ranked higher than Egbuka, who was a top-10 recruit that year out of Washington. With C.J. Stroud at quarterback, Egbuka produced a breakout season for the Buckeyes as a sophomore (74 receptions for 1,151 yards and 10 touchdowns). He delivered a productive September last season, too, but a midseason ankle procedure disrupted the rest of his 2023.\nEgbuka might not have an elite size/speed package by NFL standards, and he isn\u2019t on the same level of NFL prospect as former Buckeye teammates Harrison, Garrett Wilson and Chris Olave. But Egbuka has NFL starting talent and begins the season as my top-ranked senior receiver. A healthy 2024 season would help his chances of cracking the first round.\nGO DEEPER\nCan Ohio State's 2025 NFL Draft class make history? It's possible\n6. Elic Ayomanor, Stanford (6-2e, 210e)*\nWhat he does best: Physical and fast\nA good-sized target, Ayomanor is a physical presence before, during and after the catch, using his frame to shield defenders and strong hands to finish in crowded catch points. He also is a much better athlete than expected of a possession target. A sprint champion in high school (10.76 100 meters, 21.66 200), Ayomanor surprises defenders with his ability to quickly build up his speed.\nThe second half of the 2023 Colorado film was one long highlight reel for Ayomanor, who set a school record with 294 receiving yards in Stanford\u2019s comeback overtime win. This slant play isn\u2019t as flashy as his 97-yard catch and run or his late-game touchdown grab over Hunter, but it does show Ayomanor\u2019s ability to create quick separation, break Hunter\u2019s tackle with physicality and mash the accelerator for an explosive play.\nMust improve: Route-running prowess\nAyomanor knows the route-running basics but is still on the ground level in his development, which is expected for such a young player. He can do a better job recognizing coverages and sharpening his path to stay on the same plane vertically. Scouts will be looking for improved nuance to his patterns this upcoming season.\n2024 season/2025 NFL Draft outlook\nBorn and raised in Canada, Ayomanor attended high school in Massachusetts, where he was a three-sport star (basketball, football, track). He committed to Stanford over Notre Dame, Tennessee and others, but he spent his first season in Palo Alto rehabbing a torn ACL, MCL and meniscus. After returning to the field last season, Ayomanor gradually shook off the rust and settled in as Stanford\u2019s No. 1 pass catcher, leading the Cardinal with 62 catches for 1,013 yards and six touchdowns.\nIn the last draft cycle, there wasn\u2019t much on the Stanford roster that excited NFL scouts. Ayomanor, however, certainly has the attention of evaluators, despite just one season of film and production. It will be interesting to see if he takes another step.\nAdvertisement\n7. Sam Brown, Miami (6-1 7/8v, 194v)\nWhat he does best: Length and speed\nA tall, lanky athlete, Brown has explosive speed, which helps him create space before and after the catch. With his ability to decelerate and accelerate on command, he forced 20 missed tackles last season \u2014 more than half of his receiving yardage came with the ball in his hands.\nThis catch and run on the 2023 Texas tape is similar to the flashes on Brandon Aiyuk\u2019s Arizona State tape, which helped make Aiyuk a first-round pick.\nMust improve: Downfield consistency\nOf Brown\u2019s 61 receptions in 2023, only five came on targets of 20-plus yards. Part of the issue was inconsistent downfield placement and timing by the quarterback, but Brown can also do a better job with vertical tracking and finishing. More than 70 percent of his catches last season came on throws of fewer than 10 yards, but that should change in Miami\u2019s offensive scheme.\n2024 season/2025 NFL Draft outlook\nThe Hurricanes added several high-profile transfers this offseason like quarterback Cam Ward and running back Damien Martinez, but it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if Brown is the highest drafted of Miami\u2019s incoming transfers. The Savannah, Ga., native spent two seasons at West Virginia (2020-21) and two seasons at Houston (2022-23), leading the Cougars in receiving last year with 62 receptions for 815 yards and three touchdowns.\nIf the 2025 NFL Draft were tomorrow, I don\u2019t think Brown would be one of the first five receivers drafted. If you\u2019re looking for an underrated senior prospect ready to emerge, though, Brown has the talent to ascend.\nPreseason top 40 senior wide receivers\n(Note: Heights and weights for senior WRs listed below are NFL verified.)\n1.

      "text": "No one has a perfect fantasy football team, and no one has the perfect draft. We all make mistakes. The trick is making as few as possible, and there is one \u2014 a BIG one \u2014 managers continue to make\u2026 every year\u2026 in every draft.\nYou are wasting your bench!\nIt\u2019s one of the biggest mistakes you can make on draft day \u2014 outside of calling a player\u2019s name who was already drafted, mispronouncing a name so leaguemates laugh at you, or worst of all\u2026 drafting a kicker. How do you stop wasting your bench? I\u2019m glad you asked. Here are the three main ways managers waste their bench.\nMistake No. 1\nDrafting a second defense, or (*shudders*)\u2026 a second\u2026 kic\u2026 I can\u2019t even say the word.\nFirst, #BanKickers. With that out of the way, stop drafting multiple defenses unless you\u2019re in Best Ball. In fact, unless you are required to fill out a full roster, don\u2019t draft a defense at all \u2014 if you draft before Labor Day weekend. Take another running back or wide receiver flier instead. Injuries happen in the preseason, too, and players will impress and disappoint (looking at you, Ollie Gordon and Jaylen Wright). Defenses are unpredictable even during the season, and often the best real-life defenses aren\u2019t all that good in fantasy.\nAdvertisement\nIf you need to fill your roster, take one and be done with it. Yes, I know I acknowledged defenses are unpredictable, but you\u2019re not going to discover anything new in the preseason that affects your opinion like a flier at RB or WR will. Oh, and if it wasn\u2019t clear, even if you have to take a defense and want one of the \u201csure things\u201d (again, no such thing), don\u2019t draft one until the final three rounds. It\u2019s OK to jump the line, but mid-rounds? Heck no! Of course, I know at least one person with a bonkers DST scoring setup who will argue taking one in Round 8, and I\u2019m mainly talking to the 99% here, Mr. \u201cNot in My League!\u201d\nMistake No. 2\nDrafting a second quarterback or tight end, when\u2026\nIf you don\u2019t know my quarterback and tight end draft strategy, just ask Ricky Bobby. That\u2019s right; it\u2019s either first or last, and by that, I mean taking an elite quarterback or tight end (one or the other, rarely both) or waiting until the end game. If I don\u2019t take an early QB or TE \u2014 and I\u2019m much more inclined to take the QB \u2014 I\u2019ll wait until the double-digit rounds for my tight end flier or to double up on quarterback gambles.\nOne of the most egregious picks managers make is taking a second quarterback or tight end when they\u2019ve already drafted an elite option (Top 3, maybe Top 4 player). Why? Because you are never sitting the elite pick. You don\u2019t draft Josh Allen to ever put him on the bench, even against the most fearsome defense in the league. The same goes for Brock Bowers and the other elites at QB and TE. If you think about benching them, then 1) You give up your draft value and even hurt your team more because of the cost associated with what you passed on, as well, and 2) You shouldn\u2019t have drafted them in the first place.\nAnd, yes, I hear the arguments for it. So let\u2019s address each.\nAdvertisement\nBut\u2026 what if my elite pick is a bust? It might happen, but you are drafting an elite player who shouldn\u2019t bust, and even if he did, you\u2019re playing catch-up anyway, given the cost we discussed above.\nBut\u2026 the other manager shouldn\u2019t be gifted a good pick! So what? Your job isn\u2019t to play keep-away. It\u2019s building your best contender. Your team won\u2019t be better because you have a wasted pick sitting on the bench \u2014 a player you\u2019ll probably drop when you need bye week or injury help anyway.\nBut\u2026 what if the player breaks out, and I have a trade chip? This question has the most validity, but it still has failed logic. Lottery tickets/fliers are still that. The odds of hitting on a late pick aren\u2019t as high as perception seems. And let\u2019s assume you hit on that second player. It\u2019s hard enough to make trades, even more so when teams know you need/want to move someone.\nI was in a home league where a team drafted Drew Brees and fell into the Matt Ryan bonanza season of 2016 with a late pick. Not only was he unable to offload either quarterback because no one wanted to pay decent value, but he spent most of the season agonizing over who to start, often getting bitten by watching the bench option score more than his choice.\nMistake No. 3\nDrafting low-ceiling, replacement-level wide receivers and/or running backs\nLet\u2019s look at a few names drafted after Round 9 last year: Gabe Davis, Brandin Cooks, Tyler Lockett, Curtis Samuel, Ezekiel Elliott, Ty Chandler, plus a myriad of quarterbacks and tight ends, such as Matthew Stafford, Kirk Cousins, Aaron Rodgers, Luke Musgrave, Dalton Schultz and more. I threw in some QBs and TEs to reiterate point No. 2, but this last point is about wasting your bench with waiver-level options.\nUpside is your only concern after your first two bench players (single-digit-round picks/Top 100 players). Ask yourself, \u201cIs there a path to this player becoming an every-week fantasy starter?\u201d Whether that\u2019s a Top 10 QB, Top 30 RB, etc., the exact Top \u201cXX\u201d number isn\u2019t as important as them being worthy of a spot in your weekly lineup. If the answer is \u201cNo,\u201d then don\u2019t draft them. Backup running backs who are one injury away from RB2+ value are way more important than an RB4/5 or a WR5/6, who might get in your lineup during a bye. Is there a young wideout whose improved play or impressive start to the season turns into a top-two role over the vet hanging on to his final days? Draft him! The replacement-level players are exactly that\u2026 replaceable. A breakout Top 50-100 player is not.\nOnce you maximize your bench\u2019s potential, you will immediately be a significantly better fantasy football manager.\n(Photo of Josh Hines-Allen: Thomas Shea / Imagn Images)"
