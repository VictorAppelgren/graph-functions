The other day it was raining on and off all the time and I decided to have a flutter on the Gigis, I had a look at the Sun app and used the predictor tool and I haven\u2019t looked back since! I used to back losers all the time but now...? Generally, I go with my gut and I have had a few winners and a few places but without much success. However, with the app if it affirms what I\u2019ve already thought I\u2019ll go with it and now I am winning big! I haven\u2019t loved The Sun so much since Sam Fox was on page 3!\nWatchlist\nLuv this app but for the last week or so my selections haven\u2019t been going over to the watchlist\nMr Robert\nYour race tipping is very inconsistent you can go 2 or more days without renewing your long shot and ew thief tips which I follow every day (not doing much good lately) I buy the sun every day but it is still handy to get my bets on early via my iPad apart from that your racing coverage is fine\nApp Privacy\nThe developer, Punters Paradise UK Limited, indicated that the app\u2019s privacy practices may include handling of data as described below.
