      "text": "New Jersey beat out New York in \u2018best state to live in\u2019 ranking \u2014 here\u2019s who else made the list\nFrom housing costs to hospital quality, this annual list did the math to rank the most and least desirable states to call home.\nWalletHub\u2018s \u201cBest States to Live In\u201d ranking of 2025 set all 50 states against a lengthy list of 51 indicators \u2014 giving a numerical value to the livability of each proud state.\nSome things stayed the same in this annual ranking \u2014 Massachusetts reigned supreme for the second year in a row, and New York held on to its precarious slot in the top ten. While New Jersey earned itself a spot in the top 5, other states were knocked down a peg.\nMassachusetts won thanks to its strong health care system and high-quality education, according to WalletHub. The Northeastern state put up strong numbers for 2025, boasting the lowest premature death rate in the country and a 90% high school graduation rate.\nThis year\u2019s silver medal traded hands from Florida to Idaho \u2014 the Sunshine State dropped several slots from last year, down to sixth place, partially due to high housing costs.\nNew Jersey remained squarely in third place, thanks to factors like high median household income and low food insecurity. It\u2019s not called the Garden State for nothing.\nBig year-to-year shake-ups included Wisconsin earning a No.4 place, as well as Minnesota climbing from 13th to 5th place.\nThe Empire State remained in ninth place from last year. New York, as any New Yorker will tell you, has plenty to brag about. It ranked first in overall quality of life \u2014 a bucket of indicators that included commute times, museums per capita and average weekly hours \u2014 and seventh in safety.\nTo round out the top 10 list \u2014 Pennsylvania came in tenth, scoring high on affordability and economy ranking.\nWhen it came to which states have the most restaurants per capita \u2014 New York tied with California, Florida and Texas. The high cost of calling New York home, however, remains a drag on the state\u2019s reputation. WalletHub ranked it 47th out of 50 states for affordability.\nWalletHub\u2019s ranking, of course, is not the final word on where to call home. The high proportion of renters to owners in New York City, for example, weighs down the state\u2019s overall showing.\nNew York ranked 50th for its low rate of homeownership \u2014 a heavily weighted WalletHub indicator.\nNew Mexico found itself at the very bottom of the 2025 \u201cBest and Worst\u201d list. The Southwestern home state, known for snowy mountain peaks and inspiring desert landscapes, suffered from the country\u2019s highest crime rate \u2014 although Washington ranked 50th in the overall safety category \u2014 and one of its highest poverty rates.\nLouisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi and Alaska took up the rest of the bottom five slots, all hindered by variously poor performances in key indicators like income growth, crime and poverty rates."

      "text": "Jim Carrey finally finds a buyer for his longtime LA estate \u2014 after slashing price by $12M\nJim Carrey offloaded his sprawling Brentwood home at a major discount.\nThe 63-year-old actor\u2019s home of more than two decades finally left the market last week at $17 million, the Real Deal reported. The deal came after more than two years of million-dollar price cuts and one failed sale during California\u2019s most recent wildfire season.\nCarrey\u2019s compound was first listed for $28.9 million in early 2023. The \u201cDumb and Dumber\u201d star previously said he no longer spent much time at the 2-acre residence.\nThe final $17 million sale marks a 41% discount from the ranch home\u2019s original listing price.\nDespite the steep price cuts and losses incurred by Los Angeles\u2019 steep \u201cmansion tax,\u201d Carrey still made a nice profit on his longtime home. The comedic actor dropped $3.8 million on the property in 1994. His purchase came on the heels of his breakout success in \u201cAce Ventura: Pet Detective,\u201d along with \u201cDumb & Dumber\u201d and \u201cThe Mask\u201d \u2014 all released that same year. And hits like \u201cLiar Liar\u201d and \u201cThe Truman Show\u201d would soon follow.\nThe 1950s-era home is located in Brentwood, one of Los Angeles\u2019 most desirable neighborhoods. It boasts a mid-century style with modernized amenities, including a tennis court, a waterfall pool, a yoga and meditation area and an Art Deco movie theater \u2014 popcorn concession included.\nThe 11,000-square-foot abode encompasses a total of five bedrooms and nine bathrooms, as well as six fireplaces\nThe richly appointed property nearly left the market in December. The home went under contract at an already-discounted $19.8 million asking price, but the deal didn\u2019t pan out. It is possible that negotiations were affected by the growing threat of wildfires at the time.\nCarrey\u2019s Brentwood home narrowly avoided a direct hit from the fires that blazed through Los Angeles in January.\nThe roughly two-and-a-half-year sale comes at an uncertain period for Carrey\u2019s career. The actor recently starred as Dr. Robotnik in \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3,\u201d but has been open about his tentative plans for retirement from Hollywood.\nGraham Larson of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty represented Carrey in the sale, the Real Deal reported. The as-yet unknown buyer was repped by Sam Collins, David Parnes and James Harris and Carolwood."

      "text": "Mark Zuckerberg angers locals in tony Silicon Valley enclave over 11-home, $110M compound: \u2018They\u2019ve occupied our neighborhood\u2019\nFor years, Palo Alto\u2019s Crescent Park was a postcard of California suburban bliss \u2014 leafy streets, neighborly block parties and children coasting on bikes. Now, residents say their once-idyllic enclave has been transformed into a real-life game of Monopoly, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg buying up the board.\nSince arriving in 2011, the billionaire and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have amassed at least 11 properties along Edgewood Drive and Hamilton Avenue, spending more than $110 million.\nFive homes were folded into an expansive private compound for the couple and their three daughters, outfitted with guest houses, lush gardens, a pickleball court and a pool with a hydrofloor cover, according to the New York Times.\nNearby structures serve as an entertainment hub, staging area for outdoor events, and \u2014 controversially \u2014 a private school for 14 children, an unpermitted use under city code.\nIn the middle of the compound stands a 7-foot silver statue of Chan, commissioned by Zuckerberg, while beneath it lies 7,000 square feet of underground space that permits describe as basements \u2014 but neighbors call bunkers or \u201ca billionaire\u2019s bat cave.\u201d\nThe eight years of ongoing construction have clogged streets with heavy equipment, blocked driveways, and, residents say, knocked mirrors off parked cars, according to the Times.\nSurveillance is another sore point. Neighbors report cameras trained toward their yards and security guards stationed in vehicles, filming visitors and questioning pedestrians on public sidewalks.\n\u201cNo neighborhood wants to be occupied,\u201d Michael Kieschnick, whose Hamilton Avenue home is bordered on three sides by Zuckerberg\u2019s holdings, told the Times. \u201cBut that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019ve done. They\u2019ve occupied our neighborhood.\u201d\nCity records show 56 permits approved for Zuckerberg-owned properties since his move-in.\nCritics accuse officials of bending to the tech titan. In one instance, police created a tow-away zone for several hours so the family could host a barbecue.\nFrustrations date to 2016, when Zuckerberg sought to demolish four adjacent homes and replace them with smaller houses and large basements.\nThe Architectural Review Board rejected the proposal, but construction proceeded piecemeal, avoiding another public hearing.\nFormer board member Peter Baltay recalled visiting the site during the review process: \u201cI said \u2018I\u2019m standing on the sidewalk looking at this project for review.\u2019 He said, \u2018Well, we\u2019d appreciate it if you could move on.\u2019 I was pretty shocked by that.\u201d\nGreer Stone, a Palo Alto City Council member, said the billionaire has \u201cbeen finding loopholes around our local laws and zoning ordinances,\u201d adding, \u201cWe should never be a gated, gilded city on a hill where people don\u2019t know their neighbors.\u201d\nThe Zuckerbergs\u2019 spokesman, Aaron McLear, told The Post in a statement that the couple has \u201ctaken a number of steps above and beyond any local requirements to avoid disruption in the neighborhood.\u201d\nHe cited credible security threats as the reason for the protective measures and denied that cameras target neighbors.\n\u201cMark, Priscilla and their children have made Palo Alto their home for more than a decade,\u201d he said. \u201cThey value being members of the community.\u201d\nNot all interactions are frosty.\nSecurity guards now use quiet electric cars, and while Zuckerberg skips the annual block party, last year he sent over an ice cream cart. Before big events, staff have delivered goodwill gifts ranging from sparkling wine and chocolates to Krispy Kreme doughnuts and noise-canceling headphones.\nStill, for residents like Kieschnick, the sense of community has been hard to salvage.\n\u201cBillionaires everywhere are used to just making their own rules \u2014 Zuckerberg and Chan are not unique, except that they\u2019re our neighbors,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a mystery why the city has been so feckless.\u201d"
