      "summary": "Researchers at the University of Missouri have developed a super‑sensitive, low‑cost hydrogen sensor that can detect minute leaks within seconds, using platinum‑nickel crystals and ionic liquids. The compact device—about the size of a fingernail—offers unprecedented sensitivity, speed, and durability compared to existing market options. It is intended for continuous real‑time monitoring in hydrogen‑powered factories and vehicles, with plans to commercialize by 2027 as part of a broader push for safer renewable energy infrastructure.",
