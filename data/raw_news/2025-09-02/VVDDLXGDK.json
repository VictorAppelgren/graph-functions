  "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance rates. Fixed rates have been inching down, and September could be a good month to buy a house. Lock in your rate today.",
  "content": "Mortgage rates are relatively flat today, but they've been decreasing over the last month. According to Zillow, the current 30-year mortgage rate is 6.41%, and the 15-year fixed interest rate is 5.55%.\n\nAccording to Realtor.com research, the best time of year to buy a home in 2024 was at the end of September or the beginning of October \u2014 specifically the week of Sept. 29 through Oct. 5. If you want to buy in the next month or so, it's a good idea to start shopping for mortgage lenders and meeting with real estate agents soon.\n\nDig deeper: The best mortgage lenders right now\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to our latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember that these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are the current mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Refinance rates are usually higher than purchase rates.\n\nA mortgage calculator can help you see how various mortgage term lengths and interest rates will affect your monthly payments. Use this mortgage calculator to play around with different outcomes.\n\nThe Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator also considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when calculating your estimated monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nAs a general rule, 15-year mortgage rates are lower than 30-year mortgage rates. When comparing 15- versus 30-year mortgage rates, know that the shorter term will save you money on interest in the long run. However, your monthly payments will be higher because you\u2019re paying off the same loan amount in half the time.\n\nFor example, with a $400,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 6.41% rate, you'll make a monthly payment of about $2,505 toward your mortgage principal and interest. As interest accumulates over decades, you\u2019ll end up paying $501,672 in interest.\n\nIf you get a $400,000 15-year mortgage with a 5.55% rate, you\u2019ll pay about $3,279 monthly toward your principal and interest. However, you\u2019ll only pay $190,212 in interest over the years.\n\nIf that 15-year mortgage monthly payment is too high, remember you can always make extra mortgage payments on your 30-year loan to pay off your mortgage faster and ultimately pay less interest.\n\nWith a fixed-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in from day one. However, you will get a new rate if you refinance your mortgage.\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for a set period of time. Then the rate will go up or down depending on several factors, such as the economy and the maximum amount your rate can change according to your contract. For example, with a 7/1 ARM, your rate would be locked in for the first seven years, then change every year for the remainder of your term.\n\nAdjustable rates sometimes start lower than fixed rates, but once the initial rate-lock period ends, you risk your interest rate going up. ARM rates have also been starting higher than fixed rates recently, so sometimes you don't get a rate break.\n\nDig deeper: Adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage \u2014 Which should you choose?\n\nEconomists don't expect drastic mortgage rate drops before the end of 2025.\n\nIn 2024, mortgage rates trended downward from early August to the Sept. 18 Federal Reserve meeting, when the central bank announced a 50-basis-point slash to the federal funds rate. Since that announcement, mortgage rates have mostly increased or held steady.\n\nThe Fed decreased its rate again at its November and December meetings (by 25 bps each time). The trajectory of future mortgage rates will largely depend on the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on whether or not to cut the federal funds rate at its September meeting.\n\nThe Fed has not cut its rate at any of its 2025 meetings so far, including its July 30 meeting. Currently, the CME FedWatch tool predicts an 87% chance that the rate will decrease at the Fed's meeting in September. Mortgage rates may or may not react to a Fed short-term interest rate cut.\n\nDig deeper: Understanding the Fed's rate decisions \u2014 Do we want high or low interest rates?\n\nAccording to Zillow data, today's 30-year fixed rate is 6.41% for home purchases and 6.50% for refinances. These are the national averages, so keep in mind the average in your state or city could be different. Your rate will also vary depending on your personal finances.\n\nMortgage rates aren't expected to move much by the end of 2025. Even with a fed funds rate cut in September, other financial factors are likely to keep rates steady.\n\nWill mortgage rates go down in 2026?\n\nMortgage rates might ease a bit lower next year. Depending on the economy, inflation, and the Fed, any decreases may be relatively small.",

      "text": "Some advertisements and offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nMortgage rates are lower than this time last year, but they're still nowhere near the 3% range we saw in 2020 and 2021. However, there is a way to lower your mortgage costs: a buydown interest rate.\nWith this method, you pay more at closing to lower your mortgage interest rate. While it costs more money up front, it can lead to greater savings over the life of the loan. But it\u2019s a more beneficial tactic if you plan to stay in the home for a while \u2014 the longer you keep the mortgage, the more you\u2019ll save by buying down the rate.\nWhile there are perks to having a lower mortgage rate, there are also factors to consider before buying down your interest rate.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nIn this article:\nWhat is buying down your interest rate?\nWhen you buy down your mortgage rate, you pay extra money at closing to purchase points that essentially lower your interest rate.\nDifferent lenders have their own mortgage rate buydown programs, so there might be a slight difference in the calculation and loan terms. Be sure to ask several mortgage lenders how their buydown programs work to help you decide which loan is right for you.\nThere are two ways to buy down your mortgage. \u201cDiscount points\u201d refer to buying down your rate permanently, and a \u201cmortgage buydown\u201d does so temporarily. These two terms both refer to ways to buy down your rate and are often used interchangeably, but there are important differences.\nTypes of mortgage rate buydowns\nThere are two main types of mortgage rate buydowns: a permanent or temporary buydown. As implied, the permanent buydown rate lasts for the life of the loan, while the temporary option is only for the first few years or less. Then, there are a few kinds of temporary buydowns.\nPermanent buydown\nWith a permanent buydown, the lower rate you purchased with discount points when you first got the mortgage will last for the duration of the loan as long as you don\u2019t refinance the mortgage or change the terms. Permanent buydowns are usually purchased by the home buyer.\nMost lenders will only allow you to buy points for 1% to 2% of the mortgage amount, which typically lowers your rate by 0.25% and 0.50%, respectively. But some will go to 4%, which could lower your mortgage rate by 1%.\nTemporary buydown\nA temporary buydown, or \u201cmortgage buydown,\u201d is when your interest rate is lower for a set period of time \u2014 usually one year to three years \u2014 then resets to a higher rate for the remainder of the loan.\nThis type of buydown can be paid by the buyer, seller, home builder, or even a lender in some cases. These are usually paid through an escrow account.\n3-2-1 buydown\nWith a 3-2-1 buydown, the rate typically increases by 1% yearly. For example, if market rates are 6%, you could get a temporary buydown in which the rate is 3% the first year, 4% the second year, 5% the third year, and then resets to 6% the fourth year.\n2-1 buydown\nWith a 2-1 buydown your rate is lower for the first two years, then resets the third year. With a 2-1 buydown on a 6% rate, you would pay 4% the first year and 5% the second year, then the 6% rate would kick in on year three.\n1-0 buydown\nWith a 1-0 buydown, your rate is 1% lower for the first year and then resets to the normal interest rate for the second year and beyond.\nIn all these cases, the ideal outcome is that market rates will be lower by the time your temporary rate resets, and you can refinance into that lower market rate. This is betting on future mortgage rates, so weigh the risks before committing.\nIt\u2019s essential to ask your mortgage lender about any temporary buydown programs because each lender will have different options.\nLooking for a mortgage lender with a buydown program? Read Yahoo Finance's reviews of lenders that offer these types of lenders:\nBuilder buydown\nAre you interested in buying a new construction home? Then, you may benefit from a builder buydown. In this case, the builder (not the borrower) pays the lender so the borrower can get a lower interest rate.\nBuilder buydowns can be either permanent or temporary. Not all builders offer this incentive, but many do. According to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), around 60% of builders have been offering some sort of buyer incentives. The hope is to entice home buyers who are hesitant to buy due to high interest rates and to offset some of the company's building costs.\nKeep in mind, builder buydowns are for people getting a mortgage to buy a new construction home, not for people building houses with construction loans.\nHow much does it cost to buy down your interest rate?\nThe cost to buy down your mortgage rate will vary based on the lender and your total loan amount. But you should plan to have at least several thousand dollars set aside. Keep in mind, this money is in addition to any down payment required on your mortgage and will be paid at closing as part of your closing costs.\nIn general, one discount point \u2014 or 1% of the mortgage amount \u2014 equates to roughly a 0.25% reduction in your mortgage rate.\nSo, let\u2019s say you are offered a $400,000 mortgage with a 7% rate. If you pay $4,000 (which is 1% of your mortgage) to buy a discount point, it could reduce the mortgage rate to around 6.75%. That means you\u2019re lowering your monthly mortgage payment from an estimated $3,028 to $2,961, saving more than $67 a month, excluding the down payment, taxes, and other fees. Over a span of 30 years, you could save more than $24,000 with the lower mortgage rate.\nBut your savings is based on how long you keep that loan, so it might not be worth it if you plan to sell the house in a few years.\nIn the case of a temporary buydown, like a 3-2-1, the savings only occurs in the early years. However, it could extend beyond the initial years if market rates are lower by the time the buydown period ends and you can refinance into a lower rate.\nLet\u2019s use the same example of a $400,000 mortgage with a 7% mortgage rate, resulting in roughly a $3,028 monthly mortgage payment. With a 3-2-1 buydown, here\u2019s what you would pay for the first three years:\n-\nYear 1: A 4% rate with a $2,276 monthly payment, saving you $752 per month\n-\nYear 2: A 5% rate with a $2,514 monthly payment, saving you $514 per month\n-\nYear 3: A 6% rate with a $2,765 monthly payment, saving you $263 per month\nBased on the monthly estimates, you could save $9,024 the first year, $6,168 the second year, and $3,156 the third year, totaling more than $18,300.\nRead more: How much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\nPros and cons of buying down your mortgage interest rate\nBefore paying more up-front to get a lower mortgage rate, consider these advantages and disadvantages of a mortgage rate buydown.\nPros\n-\nYour monthly mortgage payments will be slightly lower.\n-\nYou save more in interest over the life of the loan.\n-\nIf it\u2019s a temporary buydown, you could earn significant savings during the early years of the loan.\n-\nYou might qualify for a larger mortgage amount if your interest rate is lower because it would reduce your monthly mortgage payments. Lenders approve a total amount based on how much you can afford partly based on your monthly debt-to-income ratio. For example, you might be able to afford a $400,000 loan at a 5% rate because the monthly payments could be about $500 less than the same loan amount at a 7% rate.\nCons\n-\nBuying down a rate requires cash up-front, so you will have less savings after closing day.\n-\nYour closing costs will be higher.\n-\nYou won\u2019t save as much if you sell the house within a few years than if you stay in the house for a long time, because you might not have time to recoup the extra money you paid at closing for the buydown.\n-\nYou\u2019ll have higher monthly mortgage costs later if it\u2019s a temporary buydown.\nLearn more: When will mortgage rates go down?\nHow to pay for a mortgage rate buydown\nThere are several common ways to pay for a mortgage rate buydown:\n-\nPay more at closing. If you have extra cash after meeting the down payment requirement and other closing costs, you can pay to buy down your rate. Just be sure you don\u2019t totally deplete your savings while moving into your new home. Do the math ahead of time, and check that you can make the monthly mortgage payments after buying down your rate.\n-\nAsk the home builder. With new construction homes, some builders will offer to buy down your rate to incentivize you to purchase their home. This may happen if they have their own partner lender, which helps them streamline the entire mortgage and homebuying process together. It can also be the case if they have newly built homes that have sat vacant for a while. If a builder is offering closing cost discounts, ask if that incentive can come in the form of a rate buydown.\n-\nAsk the seller. Sometimes, a seller will buy down your rate for you to buy their home. This is a rare case, especially in a seller\u2019s market. However, you can ask for the seller to cover this part of your closing costs when you make an offer on a house or during the negotiation process.\nDig deeper: Seller concessions \u2014 An inside look at a powerful real estate negotiating tool\nBuying down interest rate FAQs\nWhat is the interest rate buydown?\nAn interest rate buydown on a mortgage is a way to reduce your interest rate \u2014 temporarily or permanently \u2014 with cash paid up front at closing. Permanent buydowns are done by purchasing discount points, and one point equals a 0.25% reduction in your interest rate. Discount points typically cost 1% of your total mortgage. For instance, one point on a $300,000 mortgage would cost $3,000 for a 0.25% reduction in your interest rate. Temporary buydowns work a little differently, and you\u2019ll need to go through a mortgage lender with an official buydown loan program.\nHow many points can I buy down my interest rate?\nThe maximum number of points a lender will generally allow you to purchase is four, equaling a 1% reduction in your interest rate. However, it could be worth exploring temporary buydown programs that could result in more significant rate reductions for the first few years of your mortgage.\nIs it worth it to buy points on a mortgage?\nBuying points on a mortgage could be worth it if you plan on staying in your home long enough to recoup what you\u2019ve spent on mortgage points. It could also be worth it to buy points if you have the extra cash, and using it to buy down your rate wouldn\u2019t keep you from achieving other financial goals.\nThis article was edited by Laura Grace Tarpley."

      "text": "Some advertisements and offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nMany homeowners dream of the day they pay off their mortgage. It means no more hefty monthly payments, no more costly interest charges, and, for most homeowners, it frees up thousands in extra cash flow. It's a great way to build wealth through homeownership. There are several ways to pay off your mortgage early \u2014 you just need to find the one(s) that work best for your situation.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nIn this article:\n1. Make biweekly mortgage payments\nIf you\u2019re wondering how to pay off a home loan fast, making biweekly mortgage payments is one of your best options. With this strategy, you take your monthly mortgage payment, divide it in half, and make that half payment every two weeks (for example, every other Friday) to your mortgage lender.\nSince there are 52 weeks in the year, this amounts to 13 full monthly payments annually. It might not seem huge, but it can shave years off your loan and thousands of dollars in mortgage interest over time.\nHere\u2019s an example: Let\u2019s say you took out a $400,000 mortgage with a 30-year term at a 7% mortgage rate, with your first payment due in September 2025. This would give you a $2,661 monthly payment and an estimated mortgage payoff date of August 2055. See the chart below for how biweekly payments would change that.\n2. Make one extra mortgage payment per year\nMaybe biweekly payments don\u2019t align with your paydays, or you just don\u2019t want to deal with the hassle of paying every two weeks. If that\u2019s the case, commit to making one extra mortgage payment per year \u2014 at any point in the year. (Maybe when you get your annual tax refund or holiday bonus.)\nAs with the biweekly payment strategy, this will reduce your mortgage principal balance faster and cut down your long-term interest fees by quite a bit. A quick tip, though: The earlier you can make your extra payment, the better, as it decreases the interest you\u2019ll owe on all subsequent payments.\nWhen you make these additional payments, be sure to tell your lender to apply them directly to the principal. Otherwise, they may hold them in your escrow account and just submit them on your regular due date, negating the benefits.\n3. Make occasional extra payments toward your principal\nAnother option is to simply make an extra payment once in a while. It may not be as effective as paying extra consistently, but every little bit counts when you\u2019re paying interest.\nA good idea is to use this strategy with windfalls \u2014 unexpected money you come into throughout the year. This can include things like inheritances from loved ones, tax refunds, birthday gifts, or big tips or commissions.\nAnd don\u2019t forget to tell your lender to apply these extra payments to your mortgage principal, not your interest or any other fees.\n4. Round up your mortgage payment\nYou can also consider rounding up your mortgage payment. If your payment is $2,661.21, as in the above example, you might round up to $2,700 if your cash flow allows it.\nAgain, make sure your lender puts that extra money toward the principal, and it should make a notable difference in your long-term interest costs and payoff timeline.\n5. Refinance to a lower-rate mortgage\nRefinancing your mortgage is another strategy that can help you pay off your loan faster. There are several ways to do this, but if you can secure a lower mortgage rate than what\u2019s on your current loan, that\u2019s the best option. Not only will this reduce your interest costs right off the bat, but if you continue making your old, larger payment on your new loan, it can significantly impact your payoff time.\nFor instance, if you have a $250,000 loan balance with a 30-year mortgage term and an 8% rate, you\u2019re currently paying about $1,834 per month. If you refinanced that loan into a new, 30-year loan at a 6.75% rate, your payment would drop to around $1,622. As long as you continue making your old payment, you\u2019ll be putting an extra $212 toward your principal balance every month.\nLearn more: The best mortgage refinance lenders\n6. Refinance to a shorter-term loan\nRefinancing to a shorter loan term can also help borrowers pay off loans faster because it spreads the balance out over fewer months. Just keep in mind that shorter-term loans come with higher monthly payments. (Mortgage lenders usually reward you with lower interest rates, though. According to Freddie Mac, the current average rate on 30-year loans is hovering around a little below 7%. On 15-year loans, it\u2019s a bit under 6%.)\nTo get a good idea of what refinancing can do for your payoff timeline and costs, let\u2019s look at an example. With Borrower 1, you\u2019ll see what a $300,000 30-year loan with a 6.5% interest rate (taken out in September 2025) would look like if it were paid on time across three decades. Borrower 2, however, refinances that same loan after five years into a 15-year loan at a 5.75% interest rate.\nYahoo Tip: Use our free mortgage calculator to see how different interest rates and term lengths would affect your finances.\n7. Recast your mortgage\nFinally, recasting your mortgage may be able to help. With this strategy, you make a lump sum payment toward your principal balance, and then your lender re-amortizes your loan, spreading the remaining balance and interest across the rest of your term.\nTechnically, this is meant to lower your monthly payments and make things more affordable, but as with some other strategies, you can use it to pay off the loan earlier too. You\u2019d just need to continue making your old higher payment even after the recast.\nKeep in mind that not all lenders will allow recasting, and for those that do, they may require you to show financial hardship (meaning you\u2019re having trouble making your current payments). There may also be a fee for recasting.\nWhen is paying off your mortgage early smart?\nLearning how to pay off a mortgage quickly is only one part of the equation. You also need to know when to do it \u2014 and when an early mortgage payoff might not be a smart move for your household.\nGenerally speaking, paying off your loan faster can be smart if:\n-\nYou need to free up monthly cash flow.\n-\nYour loan doesn\u2019t have prepayment penalties, or paying off the loan would save you more than those penalties cost.\n-\nYou wouldn\u2019t drain your emergency fund to pay off the loan.\n-\nThe savings outweigh the closing costs or fees (in the case of refinancing or recasting).\nYou might not want to pay off your loan early if your interest rate is extremely low (think the sub-3% mortgage rates seen during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic). In this case, you may be better off putting your extra funds toward investments, which could offer much higher returns than the 2% to 3% you\u2019d be saving on your mortgage each year.\nRead more: Should you use a HELOC to pay off your mortgage?\nPaying off a mortgage faster FAQs\nWhat\u2019s the quickest way to pay off a mortgage?\nThe quickest way to pay off a mortgage is to make biweekly or regular additional payments toward your principal balance. You might also consider refinancing to a lower-rate or shorter-term mortgage loan.\nWhat happens if I pay an extra $1,000 a month on my mortgage?\nIf you put an extra $1,000 toward your mortgage each month, you could significantly reduce your long-term interest costs and pay off your loan much faster. The exact amount you will save depends on the balance, term, and interest rate.\nHow do I pay off a 30-year mortgage in 10 years?\nTo pay off a 30-year mortgage in 10 years, you\u2019ll need to make extra payments or increase your monthly payments. Making biweekly mortgage payments can also help you repay your loan faster (but probably not that quickly).\nWhat if I pay an extra $100 a month on my mortgage?\nBy regularly putting $100 per month toward your mortgage payment, you will reduce your principal balance faster, pay off your loan quicker, and significantly lower the total interest you pay.\nWhat are the cons of paying off your mortgage early?\nSince paying off your mortgage early requires a lot of capital, it can reduce your overall liquidity. This might make it hard to deal with any financial emergencies that arise. It also may not be the best move for your finances if you already have a low mortgage rate. You might make more money investing your extra funds in the stock market or other assets that will earn you more over time.\nLaura Grace Tarpley edited this article."

Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nIn December 2024, the Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark interest rate for the third time that year. However, it has held the federal funds rate steady so far in 2025.\nEven so, interest rates on credit cards, loans, and deposit products have continued to fall \u2014 good news for borrowers, but not so great for savers. That\u2019s a stark contrast to earlier this year, when it was more expensive to borrow money, but you could also earn above 5% on your savings.\nUnderstanding the pros and cons of high versus low interest rates is key to making informed decisions, whether you're saving for the future or managing debt. So, do we want higher or lower rates? The answer isn\u2019t exactly simple.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nWhy does the Federal Reserve control interest rates?\nThe Federal Reserve is mandated by Congress to promote stable prices and maximum employment within the US economy. One of the tools it has at its disposal to achieve these goals is the federal funds rate.\nDuring times of high inflation, for instance, the Fed will raise its federal funds rate, which is the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans to meet cash reserve requirements.\nWhen the federal funds rate increases, financial institutions also increase interest rates on certain types of loans, such as credit cards, auto loans, personal loans, and, less directly, mortgages. Many of them also increase the interest rates on their savings products to expand their lending capacity. This makes it more expensive for Americans to borrow money, but it also means they can earn more on their savings balances.\nOn the other hand, if the Fed wants to stimulate economic growth, it will lower the federal funds rate. When this happens, loan interest rates also go down, encouraging borrowing and spending among consumers and businesses. The downside is that deposit accounts pay less interest, stunting savers\u2019 ability to grow their savings.\nRead more: Fed rate cut: How it affects your bank accounts, loans, credit cards, and investments\nPros and cons of high interest rates\nDepending on your situation, higher interest rates can either help or hurt your financial well-being. Here are some benefits and drawbacks to consider.\nPros\n-\nBetter savings rates: If you have a lot of cash in savings, you may benefit from higher rates. In some cases, high-yield savings accounts can offer rates roughly 10 times the national average (or higher).\n-\nNo impact on existing fixed-rate loans: If you took out a loan with a fixed interest rate before market rates started to climb, your monthly payments won't be impacted.\n-\nIncentivizes financial discipline: Higher borrowing costs can help discourage taking on impulsive or unnecessary debt, prompting you to focus more on budgeting and saving.\nRead more: 10 best high-yield savings accounts available today\nCons\n-\nNew loans are more expensive: If you take out a new loan when interest rates are elevated \u2014 whether it has a fixed or a variable interest rate \u2014 you\u2019ll be charged a higher APR, even if you have excellent credit. This may translate to higher monthly payments, spending more in interest over the life of the loan, and/or having to take out a smaller loan to compensate for the increased costs.\n-\nTighter budget: Larger monthly payments on your loans and credit cards could put a strain on your budget, making it more difficult to cover your essential expenses and keep up with debt obligations.\n-\nOther financial challenges: The Fed often increases interest rates during periods of inflation, which means that you could be struggling in other areas of your budget. Minimizing debt is crucial during these periods of economic turmoil.\nRead more: How to protect your savings against inflation\nPros and cons of low interest rates\nWhile there are clear benefits to lower interest rates, there are also some potential disadvantages to keep in mind.\nPros\n-\nNew loans are more affordable: If you take out a loan or credit card during a period of low interest rates, you can expect a lower monthly payment, which puts less of a strain on your budget. Plus, you\u2019ll pay less in interest overall.\n-\nVariable-rate loans may become cheaper: If you have a credit card or other type of variable-rate loan, your interest rate will typically start to come down soon after the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates. Lower payments can give your budget some more breathing room.\n-\nRefinancing opportunities: If you took out a fixed-rate loan during a period of high interest rates, you may have the opportunity to refinance your debt with a lower interest rate, reducing your monthly payment and saving money on total interest charges.\nRead more: Is now a good time to refinance your mortgage?\nCons\n-\nSavers won't earn as much: With lower interest rates, you likely won't earn much on your savings account, money market account, or certificate of deposit (CD).\n-\nPossible strain on retirees: Those who rely on interest income from savings and bonds will see reduced returns, which could impact their ability to cover living expenses.\n-\nRisk of inflation and asset bubbles: When interest rates are lower, spending generally increases, which could cause prices for goods and services to rise. Additionally, lower borrowing costs can lead to inflated prices for real estate and other assets.\nRead more: How to maximize your savings following the Fed's rate cut\nThe bottom line: Are high or low interest rates better?\nThere\u2019s no right answer when it comes to whether a high or low interest rate environment is best. Ultimately, it depends on what is best for the current economic situation, as well as your personal financial goals and needs.\nTypically, low interest rates are best following an economic downturn when the Fed needs to stimulate economic activity. At the individual level, low interest rates are ideal if you\u2019re interested in taking out a large loan (such as a mortgage) or could benefit from refinancing an existing high-interest loan.\nOn the other hand, high interest rates are good for managing inflation and stabilizing prices. If you\u2019re trying to save more money and looking for low-risk ways to grow your wealth, higher interest rates can help too.\nHow to make the most of today's interest rate environment\nThe Fed slashed the federal funds rate three times in 2024 for a total of 100 basis points (or 1%). However, interest rates remain high by historical standards. What's more, the inflation rate's downward trend has stalled in recent months.\nAs a result, the Fed indicated it may be more cautious about future rate cuts. So what does that mean for you and your money? Here are some steps you can take to make the most out of the current interest rate environment:\nOpen a high-yield savings account\nIf you don't have a high-yield savings account, you may not be benefiting from elevated savings account rates. Although these rates will go down over time as the Fed continues cutting the federal funds rate, it's unlikely to happen quickly. And even in a low-rate environment, high-yield savings accounts remain one of the best options for earning the highest return possible on your savings.\nLock in a high rate with a CD\nUnlike savings accounts, CDs allow you to lock in a specified interest rate for a set period of time. CD terms can be anywhere from one month to several years in the future. However, be sure to choose a CD term that fits your savings timeline, as withdrawing your money before the maturity date will result in a penalty. These are our picks for the best CD rates.\nMinimize debt\nWhile the inflation rate is still elevated, it's important to minimize your expenses where possible so you can avoid taking on more debt than necessary.\nRemember that not all interest rates are impacted equally\nIf you're thinking about buying a home, it's important to note that mortgage rates aren't directly influenced by the federal funds rate like other forms of debt. Instead, mortgage lenders use the 10-year Treasury yield as a benchmark.\nWhile the federal funds rate has some influence on the 10-year Treasury yield, Fed rate cuts won't necessarily result in lower mortgage rates, so don't jump into a home unless you're absolutely ready.\nRead more: How the Federal Reserve rate decision affects mortgage rates"

Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nAdjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) can allow you to land a lower interest rate in today\u2019s high-rate environment. By the latest numbers, choosing a 5/1 ARM over a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage would mean the difference between a 6.06% rate and a 6.77% one. However, ARMs aren\u2019t without risk, and they\u2019re only right for certain borrowers in certain situations.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nHow does an ARM loan work?\nARMs behave like two different mortgages rolled into one loan agreement. It begins with a fixed-rate term, usually between five and 10 years. During this period, your interest rate and payment will remain the same.\nAfter that, it converts to a variable-rate loan with an interest rate that can change (up or down) every six months or annually. This means your monthly mortgage payment also changes.\nTo fully understand how ARMs work, you need to understand what their formulas mean. For example, let\u2019s examine the \u201c5/1\u201d ARM:\n-\nThe first number is the number of years for the introductory fixed-rate term. In a 5/1 ARM, it\u2019s a \u201c5\u201d \u2014 meaning five years. Your intro rate is locked in for five years.\n-\nThe second number is the period for each adjustment after the initial term. In this case, it\u2019s a \u201c1,\u201d meaning the rate changes annually. If the second number were a \u201c6,\u201d the rate would fluctuate every six months.\nNot every mortgage lender will offer all iterations of ARMs. If there\u2019s a specific term or adjustment period you\u2019re looking for, you may need to shop around for it.\nRead more: The best mortgage lenders for first-time home buyers\nARM rate caps\nThough rates on ARMs can rise, there are typically limits to how high they can go. Usually, there are three maximums built into a variable-rate structure.\nThese caps can put a limit on:\n-\nThe initial rate increase.\n-\nThe amount the rate can move in subsequent adjustments.\n-\nThe maximum rate change over the entire mortgage.\nKnowing the caps a loan comes with allows you to calculate the absolute maximum rate and payment you could face down the line. This can help you decide if a particular loan offer is right for you.\nHow ARM rates are determined\nAdjustable-rate mortgages use one of a number of broad-market interest rate indexes to determine a loan\u2019s variable rate. These indexes are regulated by financial authorities and serve as benchmark rates for many loan products.\nTo set a loan\u2019s rate, mortgage lenders choose an index and add a certain percentage of cushion, called a margin, on top of that. Different lenders add different margin amounts, so it pays to compare several companies' ARM mortgage rates as you would with any other loan product.\nLearn more: 6 steps to choosing the right mortgage lender\nTypes of adjustable-rate mortgages\n5/1 ARM\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage where the initial fixed-rate period lasts for five years and then the interest rate adjusts every year thereafter.\n5/6 ARM\nWith this ARM, the introductory fixed interest rate lasts for five years, then adjusts every six months.\n7/1 ARM\nWith a fixed-interest rate that lasts for seven years, the 7/1 ARM then resets its variable rate annually.\n7/6 ARM\nThe introductory fixed rate lasts for seven years, after which the interest rate is subject to change every six months.\n10/1 ARM\nOne of the longest-term ARMs on the market, the 10/1 maintains a fixed mortgage rate for 10 years. After that, the interest rate is variable, with possible adjustments every year.\n10/6 ARM\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage with an interest rate that is set for a full 10 years, then is variable and subject to change every six months.\nPayment-option ARM\nA payment-option ARM allows you to choose to pay various portions of the principal and interest for a specified time. The borrower can pay only the interest on the loan \u2014 or some combination of the mortgage principal and interest over a number of years. You'll owe less initially but face much higher monthly payments later.\nInterest-only ARM\nWith an interest-only ARM, you'll have a lower monthly payment, but you won't be reducing the debt you owe. A lender may offer the interest-only option for the initial period of an ARM. Once that period expires, your monthly payment may skyrocket because your payment will consist of both principal and interest.\nYahoo Finance Tip: Payment option and interest-only ARMs can result in negative amortization. That's when your monthly payment is insufficient to cover the interest due. The amount you owe will increase rather than decrease. It's probably best to avoid these ARM options.\nConvertible ARM\nA convertible ARM has a built-in option to convert an adjustable-rate mortgage to a fixed-rate loan, without additional closing costs. It's like having a refinance option automatically included in your loan.\nOne downside: The conversion opportunity is usually available after the introductory period when the ARM is set to begin intervals of rate adjustments. That limits your choice of when and at what interest rate you can refinance.\nPros and cons of an adjustable-rate mortgage\nPros\n-\nYou may get a lower initial interest rate.\n-\nYour monthly payment will likely be lower at the start.\n-\nYour rate could decrease in the future.\n-\nYou may be able to convert or refinance your mortgage to a lower fixed rate later.\nCons\n-\nInterest rate increases during the adjustment period may make your payments increasingly less affordable.\n-\nBudgeting for a payment that can change every six months to a year can be challenging.\n-\nInterest rates may be higher when you're ready to refinance to a fixed-rate mortgage.\n-\nYou may end up paying more in interest in the long run.\nHow to qualify for an ARM\nGetting approved for an ARM is much the same as qualifying for any other mortgage. Lenders will consider your credit score, income, debt, and payment history. Generally, you'll need a minimum FICO credit score of 620 (at least for a conventional ARM).\nDown payment requirements are generally the same as fixed-rate mortgages. At least a 5% down payment is preferred by many lenders, though you may be able to put down as little as 3.5% with an FHA adjustable-rate mortgage.\nIs an ARM a good idea in 2025?\nYou may be anxious to get any break you can from today\u2019s high mortgage rates. And while an ARM may offer that opportunity, it\u2019s still important to shop multiple providers and compare several mortgage loan options.\nBe sure to ask each mortgage lender the following questions:\n-\nHow long are my initial interest rate and payment guaranteed to stay the same?\n-\nWill I be making sufficient principal and interest payments to pay off the loan over the term?\n-\nHow high can the interest rate on my ARM go?\n-\nHow high would my payment (with principal and interest) be at the maximum interest rate? (Then ask yourself, can I afford that payment if it becomes a reality?)\n-\nDoes the loan have a conversion option? (See \"Convertible ARM\" above.)\n-\nDoes the ARM have a \"teaser rate\" built in? If so, what will the first adjustment payment be?\nYou should also consider the trajectory of mortgage rates when deciding whether to get an ARM. Forecasts from the Mortgage Bankers Association and Fannie Mae project that 30-year fixed mortgage rates will fall steadily through 2026. If you want a steady rate and payment, it may be worth holding out for those rates to fall into your price range.\nYahoo Finance tip: A \"teaser rate\" provides an even lower initial interest rate; however, it does increase the likelihood that your payment will rise, whether index interest rates do or not.\nDig deeper: Is now a good time to get an ARM?\nRefinancing an ARM loan\nIf you qualify, you can refinance an ARM into a fixed-rate mortgage later on. You might want to do this if your income changes and you need a more steady payment, rates are rising and you want to avoid even more increases to your payment in the future, or interest rates fall on fixed-rate products, as industry experts project.\nTake note, though: Some lenders will charge a prepayment penalty if you refinance or pay off your loan during the first few years. You will also pay closing costs on the new loan.\nDig deeper: 6 times when it makes sense to refinance your mortgage\nARMs vs. fixed-rate mortgages\nThe big difference between fixed-rate mortgages and ARMs is that one offers a consistent, steady rate and payment for your entire loan term, while the other has a rate and payment that can fluctuate.\nARMs also have lower rates than fixed-rate loans, at least at the beginning of the loan term. MBA data shows that the average rate on a 5/1 ARM was 6.06% the week ending Aug. 1, 2025. For 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, it was 6.77%.\nKeep in mind that market rates change, so an ARM is typically only the best choice in two scenarios: You know you will own the house for only a short period of time (meaning you will sell the house before that initial interest rate expires), or you have sufficient income to cover higher monthly payments that accompany any future rate bumps.\nA fixed-rate loan may be a better option if you intend to stay in a home for many years or you have a variable income that could make it difficult to cover a constantly changing payment.\nA final thought on ARMs\nYou may be surprised to find that the published initial rates on ARMs aren't that much lower than advertised fixed-rate mortgage rates. That's why it's so important to shop multiple lenders \u2014 and get preapproved \u2014 to get a good idea of the interest rates you might earn.\nYahoo Finance Tip: Be sure to note the points that lenders are building into their loan offers to sweeten their advertised interest rates. If you ask loan providers to give you offers with zero mortgage discount points, you'll be comparing offers on an equal basis.\nRead more: The best low- and no-down-payment mortgage lenders\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nAdjustable-rate mortgage FAQs\nIs an ARM a bad idea right now?\nAn ARM isn\u2019t necessarily a bad idea right now. On one hand, it would probably offer you a lower introductory interest rate than you\u2019d currently find on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. On the other hand, that rate could increase later on in your loan term. If you plan to sell your home or refinance before that point, though, it may be a good idea to take out an ARM.\nIs a 7-year ARM still a 30-year mortgage?\nA 7-year ARM could have a 30-year payoff timeline, though it\u2019s not a given \u2014 nor does it function the same way as a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage does. With a 7/1 ARM, you\u2019d have a set interest rate for the first seven years. After that, the rate shifts once annually for the rest of your loan term. Most ARMs have 30-year term lengths, though some lenders offer 15-year terms.\nWhat is the biggest drawback of an adjustable-rate mortgage?\nThe biggest drawback of an adjustable-rate mortgage is that the interest rate can increase after a certain period of time, sending your monthly mortgage payment up with it. This can be hard to budget for, especially if you have unreliable income.\nLaura Grace Tarpley edited this article."

Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nWhen you apply for a mortgage, whether to buy a home or refinance your existing loan, you'll need to decide the mortgage term that you want. In this context, \"term\" refers to the repayment period. This period is a length of time, in years, during which you'll make monthly payments toward your mortgage principal and interest.\nYour mortgage term is important because it affects:\n-\nThe interest rate you'll be offered\n-\nHow much you'll pay for principal repayment and interest charges each month\n-\nHow much total interest you'll pay over the lifetime of your mortgage\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nRead more: How much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\n15-year vs. 30-year mortgage: What you should know\nMost fixed-rate mortgages have a term of 15 or 30 years.\nA shorter term generally means you'll get a lower rate, pay less in interest over the life of your loan, and build home equity faster. However, your monthly payment will be higher.\nA longer term generally means your payment will be lower, but you'll get a higher rate and pay more in interest over the years. The longer term and lower monthly payment could help you qualify for a bigger loan. This strategy may be appropriate if you're shopping for a home in a higher-cost housing market, but only if you feel confident that you can afford the monthly payment for that larger amount.\nDig deeper: 5 strategies to get the lowest mortgage rate\nCost differential\nTo get a sense of the cost differential for these two loan products, let\u2019s run some numbers.\nIf you get a mortgage for $400,000 at 6.75% for 30 years, your monthly principal and interest payment would be roughly $2,594, and your total interest costs would be $533,981.\nFor the same $400,000 loan, but this time at 6% for 15 years, the monthly payment would be about $3,375, and your total interest paid would be $277,577. This means your monthly payment increases by $781, but you save $256,404 in total interest costs.\nTip: If you refinance an existing 30-year mortgage after you\u2019ve made payments for a number of years, you may want to consider a shorter term rather than restart your repayment period with a new 30-year loan. Depending on how much equity you\u2019ve built up, your payment could be about the same or even lower.\nLearn more: 6 times when it makes sense to refinance your mortgage\nAlternatives to 15-year and 30-year fixed-rate mortgages\nAdjustable-rate mortgages\nAdjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) typically have a 30-year term, but that\u2019s where the similarity with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage ends. The ARM starts with a fixed rate for a set number of years, but then it switches to an adjustable rate for the remainder of the term.\nThe fixed-rate period commonly lasts three, five, seven, or 10 years, after which the adjustable period continues for the remaining years. Your rate could go up or down depending on a number of factors, including economic conditions. Most ARMs that are in the adjustment period adjust annually, while some adjust more or less frequently. When your ARM adjusts, your rate, payment, and total interest expense could be lower or higher.\nSome borrowers choose an ARM because the initial fixed rate is attractive, and they assume they'll be able to refinance into another loan with a comparable or lower rate before the ARM's fixed-rate period ends and the rate adjusts. Sometimes, this strategy pays off. Other times, the borrower is unable to refinance, or interest rates have moved higher, and the anticipated lower rate is no longer an option. In that case, the borrower must continue to make the higher payment or try to sell the home.\nDig deeper: Adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage \u2014 Which should you choose?\n40-year mortgages\nNot a standard option\nA 40-year mortgage term isn't a standard option to buy a home or refinance an existing loan. If you do find a 40-year term for either of these purposes, your monthly payment may be lower, but building equity or paying off your loan will take a long time. Due to the longer term, you'll pay much more interest over the term of the loan. You may also be charged a higher rate for a 40-year mortgage.\nA loan modification option\nA 40-year term may be more appropriate for a homeowner who's struggling to pay off an existing loan due to financial hardship. In this case, the mortgage lender may offer to modify the loan and extend the term as an accommodation to avoid a foreclosure that neither the lender nor the borrower wants. With a 40-year term and lower payment, the homeowner may be able to keep the home.\nPaying off your mortgage sooner\nGetting a mortgage with a 15-, 30-, or even 40-year term doesn't mean you must take that many years to repay your loan. You can choose to make an extra mortgage payment every year or from time to time, such as when you receive a gift, bonus, or income tax refund. Paying more if and when you can help you build equity faster, stop paying for private mortgage insurance sooner, pay less total interest expenses, or pay off your home loan quicker. While you can't lengthen your loan term without your lender's approval, shortening your term may be somewhat up to you.\n15 vs. 30-year mortgage: FAQs\nAm I better off with a 15- or 30-year mortgage?\nA 15-year mortgage may be better if you want to pay off your loan quickly and can afford the higher monthly payments. A 30-year mortgage could be the better choice if you want lower monthly payments, especially if you plan to sell the home after a few years. Even if you're buying your \"forever home,\" most mortgage lenders will let you make extra payments toward your 30-year principal if you want to pay off the loan more aggressively.\nIs it cheaper to pay off a 30-year mortgage in 15 years?\nPaying off your 30-year mortgage in 15 years is not necessarily cheaper than getting a 15-year mortgage in the first place because 30-year loan rates are higher. But taking this approach to pay your mortgage off faster gives you more flexibility in case you can\u2019t afford to pay extra for a month or year. Just make sure your lender does not have prepayment penalties for paying off your loan early.\nHow much lower are 15-year mortgage rates than 30?\nIt's common for 15-year mortgage rates to be about 75 basis points lower than 30-year mortgage rates, give or take. Just remember two things: First, the difference will depend on your lender, and second, even though they come with better interest rates, 15-year mortgage monthly payments are higher."

In some parts of the country, where temperatures get very hot, the physical aspects of moving may become more challenging.\nBuying a home in the fall\nIn 2024, Realtor.com said the best time to buy a home was at the end of September or the beginning of October \u2014 specifically the week of Sept. 29 through Oct. 5. While that same timing may or may not be the case this year, early fall typically sees ample listings and slower buyer demand, resulting in slightly lower prices. These factors can make it a good time to buy a house if you\u2019re otherwise financially ready.\nRead more: Should you buy a house? How to know if you\u2019re ready\nBuying a home in the winter\nWith fewer buyers in the market, there's less house-hunting competition in the winter. Snow and ice may be a factor in parts of the country, and it could be harder to find the perfect house while shopping in less-than-perfect weather conditions.\nHomes for sale at this time of year may also be leftovers from the prior prime selling seasons, though bidding wars are less likely. Just remember: The closer you get to the holiday season, the slimmer the pickings typically are.\nBest month to buy a house\nAs we mentioned before, late September and early October were the best months to buy a home in 2024. There\u2019s no telling if the same will ring true this year. Fannie Mae economists do expect home sales to increase slowly but steadily through the year, and the organization\u2019s predictions are lower than earlier in 2025.\nIf the Federal Reserve reduces the federal funds rate, mortgage rates might also decrease. This would attract more buyers, potentially increasing home prices and changing market conditions.\nBest time of year to buy a house FAQs\nWhat time of year is the cheapest to buy a house?\nThe likely but unscientific answer may be December. Inventory is low, but buyers are scarce, so anyone selling a house may be motivated to offer a discount. Mortgage rates also factor into affordability, of course, especially for first-time home buyers.\nWhat time of year are house prices lowest?\nAccording to data from Realtor.com, median listing prices are often lowest at the beginning and end of the year.\nWhat time of year is hardest to buy a house?\nThe closer you get to the end of the year, the fewer homes there are for sale. This can mean fewer buyers to compete with, but it also potentially means fewer homes that fit your needs or budget. Harsh weather and the holidays can also make buying a house more challenging around this time.\nWhat is the most expensive month for buying a house?\nApril is the most expensive month to buy a home. April 13 through 19, in particular, is a pricy time to buy a house, according to Realtor.com. Generally speaking, home prices tend to be highest in spring and summer.\nWhich months do houses sell the most?\nOver the past nine years, the months with the highest existing home sales were:\n-\n2015: July and December\n-\n2016: October\n-\n2017: January\n-\n2018: March\n-\n2019: August\n-\n2020: October\n-\n2021: January\n-\n2022: January\n-\n2023: February\n-\n2024: February\nWhat season is best for buying a house?\nCompetition is stiffest in spring and summer, which often means higher home prices too. You will usually get better deals in fall and especially winter when buying a house. Local market conditions can impact all the variables you should consider when making a home purchase. The best season to buy is when your personal finances are in order, you have an ample down payment, and mortgage interest rates allow you to achieve a mortgage payment that fits your household budget. With a good credit score, a helpful real estate agent, and a list of potential mortgage lenders in your pocket, you\u2019re set.\nLaura Grace Tarpley edited this article."

Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nThe FOMC kept short-term interest rates unchanged \u2014 once again \u2014 on July 30. International tariff negotiations have thrown the schedule of future federal funds rate cuts to September at the earliest as the Fed considers the possible fallout to the economy.\nThe federal funds rate. The Fed. The FOMC. No doubt you've heard and read these terms before. But what do they mean? How does this impact your financial life?\nHere's what you need to know about the federal funds rate \u2014 and why it matters. We'll keep it really simple.\nIn this article:\nWhat is the federal funds rate?\nThe federal funds rate is the interest rate the government sets for one bank to charge another bank for ultra-short-term loans, usually just overnight. It's actually a target rate range. Banks negotiate a specific rate between each other within that target range set by the Federal Reserve.\nThat's it.\nLearn more: How much control does the president have over the Fed and interest rates?\nThe current federal funds rate remains unchanged at 4.25% to 4.50%.\nWant more context? Here are some additional details.\nThe federal government used to require banks to hold a certain percentage of their deposits in cash as a reserve. That ended in 2020.\nWhen banks were required to have reserves, those funds were held in the U.S. Federal Reserve System, often called \"the central bank\" or just \"the Fed.\" There are 12 Federal Reserve banks across the nation.\nToday, banks still hold money at the Fed, but for a different reason: to manage the flow of enormous sums of cash day to day. For example, when a bank moves a great deal of money and needs some extra liquidity, it can borrow the cash from another financial institution through the Federal Reserve System.\nNow, here's why all of this matters to those of us who aren't bankers.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nDig deeper: How has the federal funds rate changed over the last 50 years?\nWho decides the federal funds rate?\nThe U.S. central bank \u2014 the Federal Reserve \u2014 has a committee that meets eight times a year to set the target range that banks will use to borrow from each other. It's called the Federal Open Market Committee.\nAt these meetings, the FOMC decides whether to raise, lower, or keep that interest rate the same.\nEven a rate pause makes financial news headlines.\nWhy does the Fed adjust the federal funds rate?\nThe Fed makes these interest rate decisions to adjust the U.S. economy and manage consumer costs. Higher prices on groceries, gas, and most everything else is called inflation.\nBy raising interest rates, the Fed makes borrowing money more expensive. As a result, the economy is expected to slow, and with it, the inflation rate will ease.\nIf the economy needs a boost, the Fed decreases interest rates.\nIf the economic outlook is unclear, the Fed waits.\nLearn more: How does inflation affect mortgage rates?\nHow does the federal funds rate affect me?\nThose interest rate changes at the very top rung of the financial pyramid trickle all the way down through the banking industry.

So, a rising or falling fed funds rate will give you an idea of how home loan rates will likely move.\nSo now that you're pretty much a monetary policy expert, when someone asks your group over coffee, \"What's up with the fed funds rate?\" you can take it.\nRead more: How Fed rate decisions affect your bank accounts, loans, credit cards, and investments\nFederal funds rate FAQs\nWhat is the real fed funds rate today?\nThe federal funds rate is the interest rate depository institutions charge each other for overnight loans. The effective federal funds rate (EFFR) is the median rate charged for those loans from the prior business day. Since the fed funds rate range is 4.25% to 4.50% right now, the EFFR will fall between those two numbers. The real fed funds rate is 4.33% today.\nWhat is the difference between the fed funds rate and the discount rate?\nThe federal funds rate is the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans. The discount rate is the rate depository institutions pay when they borrow directly from the Federal Reserve.\nWhat is the Fed prime rate today?\nThe federal funds rate affects the prime rate, which is the interest rate banks charge consumers for loans. The prime rate is usually about 3 percentage points higher than the fed rate; today it is 7.50%.\nWhat is the prime rate expected to do now?\nSince the Fed once again held the fed funds rate steady, and the prime rate is typically 3 percentage points higher than the fed rate, the prime rate will likely remain near 7.50%.\nThis article was edited by Laura Grace Tarpley."

For these loans, the FHA doesn't require lenders to consider credit score, loan-to-value or other standard lending factors. The thinking is: If you get a lower interest rate, you'll likely be better able to make your monthly payment. However, remember, individual loan providers can have their own lending standards.\nWith less paperwork, no appraisal requirement, and a faster turnaround from application to decision, a Streamline Refi gets you a lower interest rate as quickly as possible.\nThere will still be closing fees, and you must be current on payments to qualify.\nVA and USDA loans also offer Streamline refinancing, though particulars may vary between each program.\nThe VA streamline refinance is called IRRRL (and yes, it's pronounced \u201cEarl\u201d). That's stands for interest rate reduction refinance loan. Your original Certificate of Eligibility will qualify you. You may also need to pay another funding fee.\nThe USDA streamlined refinance is available to homeowners even if the savings are as little as $50 per month. Income limits still apply.\nCash-out refinance\nOver time, as you make those monthly payments over the years, you'll begin to build equity in your home. That's a combination of the debt you've paid down combined with the value your home has gained.\nYou can tap into that locked-in worth by taking out a cash-out refinance. This is a new loan that combines what you still owe with the money you take out.\nFHA borrowers may qualify for FHA cash-out refinancing, and you can get a VA cash-out refinance \u2014 you cannot complete a cash-out refi on your USDA loan, though.\nHow to get a mortgage if you have bad credit\nGetting a mortgage is rarely easy, whether you have good or bad credit. Papers \u2014 or pixels representing papers \u2014 fly back and forth. You have to prove how much money you make and document just about everything.\nIf you have bad credit, it may seem practically impossible to reach the finish line \u2014 called closing on a house.\nStay cool. Don't let the little setbacks that are bound to happen sap your patience.\nMost importantly, talk to more than one lender. You might be surprised how different they can be. Talk to three or four lenders and apply for a mortgage preapproval. If this preliminary application is accepted, you'll receive a Loan Estimate, showing the loan terms and interest rate you qualify for. This is not a final approval.\nClosely review all of the fees. Negotiate those that you can. Understand how much your monthly payment will be, including taxes and insurance. Ask questions and make sure you understand the answers at each step of the loan process.\nGetting a home loan is a big deal. Don't rush it.\nRead more: How to choose a mortgage lender in 6 steps\nMortgage lenders that did not make our list of the best lenders for bad credit\nWe considered the following mortgage lenders for our best-of list for bad-credit borrowers, but they weren\u2019t quite as strong as our top picks:\nEven though these lenders didn't quite make the list this time, you might still consider any of them. Read our individual mortgage lender reviews to learn more about each company.\nBest lenders for bad credit FAQs\nWhy does my mortgage rate seem so high?\nOne downside of having bad credit: Lenders price in the risk they're taking with a higher interest rate. That's why talking to more than one lender is so important. Each mortgage provider has its own lending and pricing procedures. One lender may want your business more than another and offer you a better mortgage rate.\nWhat is considered bad credit for a mortgage?\nA score below 620 is the dividing line between a conventional loan and most government loans. FHA loans can serve borrowers with credit scores as low as 500. The higher your score and the greater your down payment, the better your loan terms will likely be.\nAre there higher fees charged for mortgages issued to borrowers with bad credit?\nYes. In addition to a higher mortgage interest rate, you will likely pay mortgage insurance premiums and perhaps additional closing costs.\nAre there programs to help homebuyers with bad credit?\nYes. Many lenders work with state and local housing assistance programs to obtain grants, vouchers, and other concessions for borrowers with bad credit. Ask each lender you speak to how they can help you find assistance programs. You can also use this NCHSA tool to find housing assistance and finance agencies near you.\nCan you get a mortgage with a 500 credit score?\nYes, it\u2019s possible to get a mortgage loan with a 500 credit score. You can qualify for an FHA loan with a score as low as 500 \u2014 but you must have a 10% down payment. Otherwise, FHA loans require a 580 credit score with a 3.5% down payment.\nCan I buy a house with a 550 credit score?\nYes, you may be able to buy a house with a 500 credit score. However, you'll probably need to apply for an FHA mortgage and have at least a 10% down payment. With a 580 credit score, you'll only need a 3.5% down payment.\nMethodology:\nYahoo Finance reviews and scores mortgage lenders with quintile scoring in five primary categories: 1) Interest rates. Using 2024 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data from almost 5,000 mortgage companies, we score mortgage lenders on issued mortgage rates below or above the annual median of reporting lenders. 2) Affordability. A measure of loan product availability and the willingness of a lender to offer government-backed loans, low down payments, down payment assistance, and consideration of nontraditional credit. 3) Loan costs. HMDA data is again analyzed, and lenders are rated based on total loan costs compared to the annual median. 4) Rate transparency. The ability of a website user to obtain a mortgage interest rate estimate. We score lenders based on whether rates are enhanced with discount points or high credit score requirements, disclaimers revealing rate assumptions, sample advertised rates, and whether adjustable or no discount point rate estimates are available. 5) Online features. An analysis of the educational material, calculators, and additional resources available to users.\nReview of Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS) data on regulatory actions can trigger a penalty to the score of any lender with a consumer mortgage-related administrative or enforcement action within the past five years.\nAdvertisers or sponsorships do not influence ratings.\nEditorial disclosure for mortgages:\nThe information in this article has not been reviewed or approved by any advertiser. The details on financial products, including interest rates and fees, are accurate as of the publish date. All products or services are presented without warranty. Check the lender's website for the most current information. This site doesn't include all currently available offers.\nTo select the finalists for the best lenders for bad credit, Yahoo Finance filtered loan providers who 1) offered a full selection of government loans, which typically offer easier credit qualifying, 2) lenders who considered alternative credit, 3) lenders who offered generous down payment and closing costs assistance, and 4) lenders highly-rated for customer service. Additionally, all lenders considered were required to dedicate a lending volume of 20% or more to FHA loans.\nThis article was edited by Laura Grace Tarpley."

      "text": "Some advertisements and offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nWhen it\u2019s time to buy a house, you know you\u2019ll need to borrow money from a mortgage lender. But did you know there are several mortgage loan types to choose from?\nOne of the most popular options on the market is the fixed-rate mortgage. We\u2019ll explain how a fixed-rate mortgage works, share some pros and cons, and answer some common questions about these types of loans so you can decide if you want to finance your purchase with a fixed-rate home loan.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nLearn more: What is a mortgage?\nIn this article:\nWhat is a fixed-rate mortgage?\nA fixed-rate mortgage is a home loan that has a stable interest rate for your entire term. If your interest rate is 6% on closing day, it will still be 6% decades later when you make your final mortgage payment \u2014 unless you refinance into a lower rate.\nYour monthly principal and interest payments will remain the same for the entire term. (However, your overall mortgage payment may increase or decrease over the years due to property tax, homeowners insurance, or mortgage insurance changes.)\nThe alternative to a fixed-rate mortgage is the adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM). With an ARM, your interest rate stays the same for the first several years of the loan term. Then, based on multiple economic factors, it can increase or decrease at predetermined intervals until you refinance your mortgage, sell your home, or pay off your loan. Your monthly payment will change with each interest rate adjustment. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year.\nDig deeper: Adjustable-rate versus fixed-rate mortgage\nHow does a fixed-rate mortgage work?\nThe basics of fixed-rate mortgages\nLike any other home loan, a fixed-rate mortgage is a secured debt that uses your house as collateral. If you don\u2019t repay your loan as agreed, the bank can foreclose on and sell the property to regain its losses.\nSeveral types of fixed-rate mortgages are available. You can get a conventional mortgage, which you may consider a \u201cregular mortgage.\u201d You can also secure a government-backed home loan (FHA, VA, or USDA) with a fixed interest rate.\nSecuring your fixed-rate mortgage\n\u201cTo get a fixed-rate mortgage, you would first apply with the lender of your choice. You would then authorize a credit check and provide the requested documentation about your finances and current holdings,\u201d said Scott Kuhn, head of mortgage retail sales for Members 1st Federal Credit Union, via email.\nIf you\u2019re qualified for the mortgage, you can choose your loan term and interest rate from the options the lender provides. \u201cCommonly available terms are 30 years, 20 years, 15 years, or 10 years,\u201d said Kuhn.\nShorter terms typically come with lower interest rates, but your monthly fixed-rate mortgage payments will be higher because you\u2019re paying off the same amount in a shorter chunk of time. If you want a lower monthly payment and are comfortable paying more in interest, you may prefer a longer fixed-rate mortgage term.\nYour down payment also impacts your interest rate. Your lender will usually reward you with a lower interest rate if you put more money down because you\u2019ll borrow less, which reduces the bank\u2019s risk.\nLoan repayment\nTypically, your fixed-rate mortgage is fully amortized, meaning you will pay off your mortgage at the end of the term if you make every payment in full and on time. It follows an amortization schedule, a document your mortgage lender will give you that shows how each payment is allocated toward the principal balance and interest due. You\u2019ll also see exactly how much interest you\u2019ll pay over the loan term.\nEven though a fixed-rate home loan keeps your mortgage principal and interest payments the same, during the early years of your mortgage, more of each payment will go toward mortgage interest than principal. Gradually, more will go toward the principal and less toward interest so that as you near the end of your loan term, most of your payment will go toward the principal.\nLet\u2019s say you take out a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for $300,000 with a 6.75% interest rate. When you make your first monthly fixed-rate mortgage payment of $1,946, only $258.29 will go toward the principal balance. However, when you make your last $1,946 payment in 30 years, $1,934.91 will go toward the principal.\nWhen you have spare cash, you can pay down your mortgage faster (and reduce your interest charges) by making extra payments on the principal balance. For instance, paying an additional $1,946 each January will shave nearly six years off your loan term and save you about $93,000 in interest.\nNow, let\u2019s say you take out a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 6% interest rate. Your monthly payment will jump to $2,532, but you\u2019ll pay almost $245,000 less in interest (and have a paid-off home in half the time).\nDig deeper: How to choose between a 30-year vs. 15-year mortgage loan\nPros and cons of a fixed-rate mortgage\nLike any financial product, the fixed-rate mortgage has its share of pros and cons.\nPros\n-\nPredictable monthly payments\n-\nNo rate increases \u2014 even when the market shifts\n-\nYou can refinance the loan if rates decrease\nCons\n-\nYou'll typically have a higher rate than the initial rate you\u2019d get with an ARM\n-\nThere isn\u2019t potential for your rate to drop like there is with an ARM\n-\nYou need a sizeable down payment to get the best rate\nFixed-rate mortgage FAQs\nWhat is the average APR for a fixed-rate mortgage?\nAs of spring 2025, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is over 6.75%. However, average rates change regularly, so you should keep tabs on them if you want to buy a house soon.\nWhen should I consider getting a fixed-rate mortgage?\n\u201c[You] should choose a fixed rate or at least consider one when the rates are at historically low periods,\u201d Kuhn said. \u201c[You] should also consider [one] if [you] need payments that are stable to budget on a fixed income, whether that be salary, hourly, or retirement.\u201d A fixed-rate mortgage may also be a good bet if you plan to keep the home for a long time.\nAre fixed-rate mortgages good?\nA fixed-rate mortgage may be good for you if you want predictable monthly payments throughout your loan term and plan to stay in the home for a while. However, adjustable-rate mortgages sometimes have a lower initial interest rate, so you may want to consider getting one if you plan to sell or refinance the property before the initial period ends."

While house prices are the more obvious factor determining how much you pay over the life of the loan, interest rates will also play a crucial role in the total cost of your mortgage.\nThis leads to an essential question for home buyers: Is it better to buy a less expensive house with a higher interest rate or a more expensive house with a lower interest rate?\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the relationship between interest rates and house prices and how they affect your mortgage payments.\nDig deeper: When will mortgage rates decrease?\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nIn this article:\nThe relationship between house prices and interest rates\nDeciding whether to prioritize a low home price or mortgage interest rate is more than just a simple mathematical question. That\u2019s because there tends to be an inverse correlation between home prices and interest rates in the housing market. Specifically, home prices tend to be lower when interest rates are higher, and home prices typically go up when interest rates are low.\nThis relationship involves the economic principle of supply and demand. In this case, interest rates can affect the demand for homes in the housing market. Lower interest rates generally mean increased demand for houses, leading to home sellers setting higher home prices. On the other hand, higher interest rates can reduce the demand for homes, so home sellers lower their prices to entice potential buyers, and home values decline.\nLearn more: When will housing prices drop?\nHow interest rates and house prices affect affordability\nCalculating the affordability of a home depends on three different aspects of the home sale: the down payment, the monthly mortgage payment, and the lifetime cost of the home loan. Here\u2019s how interest rates versus house prices affect each of those factors.\nDown payment\nConventional loans require a down payment. Home buyers who want to avoid paying for private mortgage insurance (PMI) must put down at least 20%, although mortgage lenders may accept as little as 3% down on conventional loans. The typical down payment in Q4 2024 was 16.3% (a median of $63,188), according to a study by Redfin.\nIf you purchase a home with a lower price but a higher interest rate, your down payment can be more affordable. For example, let\u2019s say you purchase a $220,000 home while interest rates are high. You can put down a 20% down payment, or $44,000, and get a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 7.3% interest rate.\nBut if you waited for interest rates to fall before buying a home, the same house may now be selling for $300,000. Although 30-year mortgages may now have interest rates as low as 6% because you waited, you would need $60,000 to make a 20% down payment and avoid PMI.\nMonthly payments\nYour monthly mortgage payment depends on several factors, including how much you borrow and the interest rate on your loan. For a $220,000 home purchase with a $44,000 down payment and 7.3% interest rate, your monthly payment toward the mortgage principal and interest will be approximately $1,207.\nIf you wait until rates fall to 6% and purchase the home for $300,000, you must find another $16,000 to make a 20% down payment of $60,000. If you can afford the higher down payment, your monthly mortgage payment will be approximately $1,439, which means you\u2019ll pay about $230 more per month than if you\u2019d purchased the home at a lower price and higher interest rate.\nHowever, let\u2019s assume you can\u2019t afford the $60,000 down payment. If you buy the home at $300,000 with a $44,000 down payment, you will be on the hook for PMI until you have built up at least 20% equity in the home.\nIf you pay 1.5% in PMI, your monthly mortgage payments (principal + interest + PMI) will be approximately $2,175 for the first four-and-a-half years. At that point, you will have built up 20% equity and are no longer responsible for PMI. Then, your monthly payment will drop to $1,855 for the life of the loan.\nIn this case, waiting until the rates decrease will result in a monthly payment that\u2019s $648 to $968 higher.\nNote: These monthly mortgage payments do not include homeowners insurance, property tax, or homeowner\u2019s association (HOA) dues. To get even more accurate numbers, use Yahoo Finance\u2019s mortgage calculator.\nLifetime loan costs\nYou may feel the pain of the down payment and monthly payments in the short term, but the lifetime costs of your loan are also an important factor in your housing affordability. This is where interest rates can make a big difference.\nFor example, the $220,000 home with a $44,000 down payment and a 7.3% interest rate on a 30-year mortgage will cost $258,378 in interest over the life of the loan \u2014 on top of the amount you borrow.\nBut waiting until rates fall to 6% and the home price rises to $300,000 will change your lifetime costs. If you put down $44,000 on a 30-year mortgage and must pay PMI, your lifetime loan costs are approximately $314,107 \u2014 on top of that original $300,000 \u2014 broken down into $17,507 in PMI costs and $296,600 in lifetime interest paid.\nIn this case, you would have been better off buying the house at a lower price with a higher interest rate, saving over $55,000 over three decades.\nBut what if you can afford the 20% down payment of $60,000 and avoid PMI? On that 30-year home loan with a 6% interest rate, your lifetime interest paid is $278,012 with $0 paid in PMI. You will save roughly $18,500 in interest over the life of the loan than if you\u2019d made a lower down payment, plus the $17,507 saved by skipping the PMI.\nBreaking it down\nInterest rates, home price, down payment, PMI \u2014 all individual factors that add up to the total cost of owning your home. It can get confusing, so let's break it down with a chart.\nLet\u2019s look at the three examples we\u2019ve been discussing:\n-\n$220,000 house with a 7.3% rate and 20% down payment ($44,000)\n-\n$300,000 house with a 6% rate and 20% down payment ($60,000)\n-\n$300,000 house with a 6% rate and 14.7% down payment ($44,000)\nIn this case, buying the less expensive home with the higher interest rate saves you money on your down payment, PMI, monthly mortgage payments, and total cost. But keep in mind that the numbers will depend on your exact interest rate and house price. The lower house price won\u2019t always beat the lower rate, especially if you don\u2019t have a 20% down payment in either scenario.\nLearn more: What is the median home price by state?\nThe other side of the home price/interest rate equation\nRemember when we said that home prices typically drop when interest rates rise? Well, the real estate market of the past few years has bucked that trend.\nFrom Q1 2020 to Q1 2025, the average sales price for a single-family home in the U.S. increased from $383,000 to $503,800, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. More current data from Redfin shows the median price for single-family homes sitting at $440,913 as of May 2025 \u2014 a 0.7% increase compared to 2024. During this same time, interest rates have also consistently been on the rise \u2014 from sub-3% in late 2020 and early 2021 to the high 6% range as of June 2025.\nSo, if you\u2019re considering holding off on a purchase until rates or home prices dip, that strategy could seriously backfire, said Casey Gaddy, a real estate agent based in Philadelphia, via email.\n\u201cThe reality is, nobody can quite forecast where the market\u2019s ultimately headed,\u201d said Gaddy. \u201cThat\u2019s why I counsel buyers to work with their agent and lender on strategies that work today.\u201d\nInstead of taking a risk at forecasting the market and ending up on the wrong side of the gamble, Gaddy recommended that buyers work with their real estate agent and mortgage lender on strategies that fit the current market. He offers a seller-paid rate buydown as an example.\n\u201cInstead of negotiating $10,000 off the purchase price of that $300,000 home \u2014 which saves you $10,000 \u2014 ask the seller to put that $10,000 toward buying down your interest rate,\u201d said Gaddy. With his example, lowering your interest rate from 6.5% to 5.5% through a rate buydown with discount points could save you as much as $70,000 over 30 years.\nFor buyers who know they won\u2019t be making their current purchase their forever home, Gaddy suggested asking about a 3-2-1 rate buydown. \u201cThis lets you enjoy a much lower rate the first few years \u2014 saving you thousands up front \u2014 without paying for a long-term rate you won\u2019t use,\u201d Gaddy said.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nRead more: Average mortgage rates by state\nInterest rates and house prices FAQs\nHow do interest rates affect home prices?\nIn typical housing markets, interest rates and housing prices have an inverse relationship. When housing prices increase, it\u2019s common for interest rates to fall and vice versa. However, the 2025 housing market suffers from a tight supply where buyers outnumber homes for sale. This creates an environment where home prices continue to rise and interest rates remain steady, creating challenges for buyers \u2014 especially first-time buyers seeking affordable homes.\nWill home prices drop when interest rates drop?\nHistorically, home prices increase when interest rates drop as more buyers compete for the same number of homes for sale. More buyers in the market creates a \u201cseller\u2019s market,\u201d whereby sellers don\u2019t need to reduce prices or negotiate as much due to having multiple offers.\nShould I buy a house now or wait for a recession?\nIf you have the financial means to buy a home now, including the income, down payment, and financial stability, you may want to make the jump to homeownership today. Waiting for a recession could be a fool\u2019s errand, as there\u2019s no guarantee that one is around the corner. While you wait, home prices could increase \u2014 especially since they\u2019ve been on a steady climb since 2020. If you\u2019re worried about interest rates, it\u2019s important to remember that you can always refinance to a lower rate in the future to save on borrowing costs.\nThis article was edited by Laura Grace Tarpley."

FICO considers numerous credit inquiries for a single type of loan within a 45-day period to be related and won't compound the impact to your credit score.\nWhat is a mortgage?\nA mortgage is a type of loan used to buy a home. If you can\u2019t afford to pay for a house in cash, you use the money you do have on hand for a down payment, then borrow the rest with a mortgage.\nA mortgage is a secured loan, meaning your house is used as collateral. If you fail to make mortgage payments, you could face foreclosure and lose the house.\nTypes of mortgages offered by the best mortgage lenders\nThere are many types of mortgage loans, but the best mortgage lenders usually offer the following common kinds of home loans that benefit the most borrowers:\nConventional loans\nYou might think of a conventional loan as a \u201cregular mortgage.\u201d There are two types of conventional loans: conforming and jumbo.\nPeople often use the terms \u201cconventional\u201d and \u201cconforming\u201d interchangeably \u2014 a conforming loan is simply a mortgage under the limit set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). In 2025, the conforming loan limit is $806,500 in most parts of the United States and $1,209,750 in higher-cost areas. A jumbo loan is a type of conventional loan for more than the FHFA limit, and you\u2019ll usually need a higher credit score and down payment to qualify.\nFHA loans\nFHA loans are mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Though the FHA backs these mortgages, you\u2019ll still apply for them with a private mortgage lender. These are good options for first-time home buyers because they only require a 580 credit score (with a 3.5% down payment) or a 500 score (with a 10% down payment). You can also qualify with a higher debt-to-income ratio than with conventional loans.\nVA loans\nA VA loan is insured by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and it\u2019s for people affiliated with the military and their spouses. VA loans don\u2019t have a set minimum credit score \u2014 the required score varies by lender. These loans also don\u2019t require a down payment.\nUSDA loans\nA USDA mortgage is for low-income borrowers buying in qualifying rural areas, and it\u2019s insured by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).\nOther types of mortgages\nThe list of mortgage types goes on and on, but here are a few other kinds of mortgage loans you might qualify for:\n-\nFixed-rate mortgage: This is a very common type of mortgage (you can get conventional, FHA, VA, and USDA loans with fixed rates) that keeps your rate the same for the entire life of the loan. On a 30-year loan, your monthly payment toward the mortgage principal and interest will be the same for the entire 30 years.\n-\nAdjustable-rate mortgage (ARM): An ARM locks in your rate for a predetermined amount of time and then changes it regularly. For example, a 5/1 ARM keeps your rate the same for the first five years, then it increases or decreases once a year for the rest of your term.\n-\nHELOCs and home equity loans: Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and home equity loans are \u201csecond mortgages.\u201d You borrow against the equity in your home and have a second mortgage payment along with your first one.\nHow to get a mortgage\nTo get a mortgage loan, first, narrow your search down to three or four lenders. Apply for mortgage preapproval with all of them in a short time frame so that when you\u2019re looking at interest rates and fees, you\u2019re comparing apples to apples. Once you have a preapproval letter in hand, you can start shopping for homes.\nWhen you make an offer on a home \u2014 and it is accepted \u2014 you\u2019ll choose your favorite lender from your list and send them the necessary documentation, such as bank statements and tax returns, to apply for an official mortgage approval. The lender will usually take around 30 to 45 days to complete the underwriting process and schedule a closing day. The day you close on the house, you will sign the paperwork for your mortgage, become a homeowner, and receive the keys to your new house.\nTop 5 characteristics of the best mortgage lenders\nWhen adding lenders to your roster of contenders, look for these five traits shared by the best mortgage lenders:\n1. A smooth application process\nA preapproval is the ticket to shopping for a house. But it's only the first step. The lenders competing to win your business should have low-friction application procedures and easy document exchange, preferably with secure online paperwork capabilities.\n2. A wide selection of loan options\nStarting out, you may not know your best loan option. Is it a conventional mortgage or an FHA-backed loan? Maybe a jumbo? The lenders you talk to should be well-equipped to meet your funding needs with a variety of mortgage loan types.\n3. Low or no origination fee\nThe best mortgage companies fairly price their loans without piling on a lot of expensive fees. There is a long list of potential loan charges to be aware of, but a mortgage origination fee can be as much as 0.50% to 1% or more of the loan cost. Look for lenders who waive lender origination fees.\n4. Responsive and proactive customer support\nAre your questions answered quickly, and are you guided through the loan process along the way? The best mortgage lenders provide concierge-level service.\n5. Rate transparency\nThe best lenders will show interest rates on a number of loan options and clearly disclose fees built into the interest rate, such as discount points.\nMortgage lenders that did not make our best lender list\nWe seriously considered the following mortgage lenders for our best-of list, but they weren\u2019t quite as strong as our top picks:\nJust because any of these lenders didn\u2019t make our top mortgage lender list doesn\u2019t mean one won\u2019t be a good fit for your home purchase. Read our individual mortgage lender reviews to learn more about each company.\nBest mortgage lenders: FAQs\nIs it better to get a mortgage from a bank or a private lender?\nMortgage lenders are often better than banks because they specialize in home loans rather than a variety of financial products. They also usually have a quicker mortgage underwriting process. But your bank could be a good fit if it offers special mortgage perks for existing customers. Some national banks, such as Truist, also have the bandwidth to offer unique benefits to mortgage borrowers.\nWhat is the best bank to get a mortgage from?\nIf you\u2019re set on using a bank rather than a mortgage lender, the best bank may be the one you already use. Banks sometimes offer benefits to home buyers who are already customers. Otherwise, Yahoo Finance\u2019s top bank for mortgages is Truist because it ranks high in our affordability, loan costs, and rate transparency categories. Chase is also a strong bank contender for home loans.\nWho is the No. 1 mortgage lender in the U.S.?\nRocket Mortgage is the top mortgage lender in America by loan volume. It also ranks above average in customer satisfaction according to the 2024 J.D. Power Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study.\nWhat is the best place to get a mortgage loan?\nThe best place to get a mortgage loan depends on what type of mortgage you need. At Yahoo Finance, we consider Navy Federal to be the best lender for a VA loan, Pennymac is the best place to get an FHA loan, and U.S. Bank is best for USDA loans. Truist is the best for first-time home buyers because it offers unique perks to first-timers, Better Mortgage is great for an all-digital experience, and Chase is a strong choice if you're looking for a low (or even no) down payment. Flagstar Bank is best if you have bad credit because it has all three government loan programs and a tool to help you tailor your sample mortgage rate to your credit score range.\nWhat lender has the lowest mortgage rates?\nYahoo Finance has assessed almost two dozen top mortgage lenders\u2019 interest rates using Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data. Of the lenders we\u2019ve evaluated, the ones with the best rates are AmeriSave, Better Mortgage, Carrington, Citibank, loanDepot, Mr. Cooper, Navy Federal, PenFed, Pennymac, USAA, and Wells Fargo. These lenders scored 5 out of 5 in the interest rate category of our methodology.\nDoes it matter which mortgage lender you go with?\nYes, it's crucial to shop around to find the right mortgage lender. Some may offer a unique type of mortgage loan that's best for your situation, such as an ITIN mortgage or investment property loan. Lenders have different interest rates based on your finances and type of loan, and they charge different fees. It's helpful to apply for mortgage preapproval with three or four so you can compare these offerings.\nMethodology:\nYahoo Finance reviews and scores mortgage lenders with quintile scoring in five primary categories: 1) Interest rates. Using 2023 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data comprised of 10 million home loan applications, we score mortgage lenders on issued mortgage rates below or above the annual median of reporting lenders. 2) Affordability. A measure of loan product availability and the willingness of a lender to offer government-backed loans, low down payments, down payment assistance, and consideration of nontraditional credit. 3) Loan costs. HMDA data is again analyzed, and lenders are rated based on total loan costs compared to the annual median. 4) Rate transparency. The ability of a website user to obtain a mortgage interest rate estimate. We score lenders based on whether rates are enhanced with discount points or high credit score requirements, disclaimers revealing rate assumptions, sample advertised rates, and whether adjustable or no discount point rate estimates are available. 5) Online features. An analysis of the educational material, calculators, and additional resources available to users.\nReview of Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS) data on regulatory actions can trigger a penalty to the score of any lender with a consumer mortgage-related administrative or enforcement action within the past five years.\nAdvertisers or sponsorships do not influence ratings.\nEditorial disclosure for mortgages:\nThe information in this article has not been reviewed or approved by any advertiser.

Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nHome prices have risen steadily over the past few years, so it's critical to prepare financially if you\u2019re planning to buy a new home soon.\nOf course, just how much you\u2019ll need to budget depends on the home you buy and the loan terms you get. According to U.S. Census Bureau data, the median sales price of single-family homes sold in May 2025 was $426,600.\nWith those numbers in mind, let's look at how much you'd owe monthly if you took out a $400,000 home loan. This way, you\u2019ll better understand how much home you can afford and whether becoming a homeowner makes financial sense for you right now.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nLearn more:\nWhat is the monthly mortgage payment on $400,000?\nYour monthly payment on a $400,000 mortgage depends on several factors, including how long your loan term is and the mortgage interest rate you secure. Other costs like insurance and property taxes will also affect your monthly payments, but we\u2019ll touch on that later.\nTerm lengths on a $400,000 mortgage\nThe shorter your loan term, the higher your monthly mortgage payments will be because you have less time to repay the loan. For example, if you take out a $400,000 30-year mortgage with a 6.75% fixed interest rate, your monthly payment toward principal and interest would be around $2,594. But if you shorten your loan term to 15 years, your monthly payments may increase to $3,540.\nAnother thing to note is that interest rates tend to be a bit lower on shorter-term mortgages. The example above is simply to help you understand how term lengths can affect your monthly mortgage payment. In a real-life scenario, you may see that the interest rate on a 30-year $400,000 loan is 6.75% while the rate on a 15-year loan for the same amount is slightly lower at 6%. We\u2019ll dive into how interest rates impact your payment below.\nDig deeper: 15-year vs. 30-year mortgage \u2014 How to decide which is better\nInterest rates on a $400,000 mortgage\nThe higher the mortgage interest rate, the higher your monthly mortgage payment will be. For example, if you take out a $400,000 30-year loan at a 6% mortgage rate, you\u2019ll have a monthly payment of $2,398. However, the same $400,000 30-year mortgage at a 7% interest rate will have a monthly payment of $2,661. Again, these numbers have not factored in the monthly cost of home insurance, mortgage insurance, or property taxes, which you\u2019ll typically pay as part of your monthly mortgage payment too.\nKeep in mind that mortgage rates are influenced by many factors, including your credit score, your down payment amount, the type of home loan you use, and overall mortgage rates in your area. Rates can also vary from lender to lender, so you\u2019ll want to get quotes from at least three different mortgage lenders to find the best deal.\nLearn more: Use Yahoo Finance\u2019s mortgage payment calculator\nExamples: How term lengths and interest rates affect your monthly payment\nThe following table should help you understand how both your interest rate and mortgage term length affect your monthly payment on a $400,000 home loan. Again, note that these numbers do not include additional homeownership costs like property taxes and private mortgage insurance (PMI).\nAmortization schedule on a $400,000 mortgage\nIf you choose a fixed-rate mortgage, your monthly mortgage payments will typically stay the same throughout the life of your loan. However, at the beginning of your loan term, most of the money you pay will go toward the interest. As time goes on, the amount that goes toward the mortgage principal (the money you originally borrowed) will grow larger while the amount going toward interest will decline.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of a mortgage amortization schedule on a 30-year $400,000 mortgage with a 6.75% interest rate to help you understand what that looks like. (Each number is rounded to the nearest dollar.)\nHave questions about buying, owning, or selling a house? Submit your question to Yahoo's panel of Realtors using this Google form.\nOther factors that could impact your payment on a $400,000 mortgage\nBesides your mortgage rate and loan term, the following costs could also affect your monthly mortgage payments on a $400,000 house.\nHomeowners insurance\nHomeowners insurance is a financial protection policy that covers some of the repair costs if your home, property, personal belongings, and other assets in your house are damaged due to a covered peril, such as theft, vandalism, or fire, for instance. Mortgage lenders will require that you have a home insurance policy in place before you can close on your loan.\nThe exact cost of home insurance varies widely by location and property, but the average cost in the U.S. is $2,554 annually or $213 a month for a home valued at $400,000 to $500,000, according to insurance marketplace Matic.\nProperty taxes\nProperty tax is an annual or semiannual tax levied by your local and state governments. It's based on the value of your property, which includes both the land and the buildings on it.\nProperty tax rates vary by location, but the average property tax paid per household in the U.S. was $1,889 in 2023, according to the Tax Foundation. Homeowners in New Jersey paid the highest property tax rates, while those in Hawaii paid the lowest.\nMortgage insurance\nIf you take out a conventional loan but put down less than 20%, you must pay private mortgage insurance, which protects the lender if you stop making payments on your loan. PMI can cost anywhere from $30 to $70 per month for every $100,000 you borrow, according to Freddie Mac.\nIf you take out an FHA loan, you must pay a mortgage insurance premium (MIP) regardless of your down payment amount. FHA mortgage insurance has two parts: an up-front payment at closing and an annual premium. The up-front MIP is 1.75% of the loan amount, or $7,000 on a $400,000 mortgage. The annual MIP varies based on the size, term, and loan-to-value (LTV) ratio but ranges from 0.45% to 1.05% of the loan amount. The cost is then spread out across all 12 of your monthly payments for that year.\nLearn more: How to remove FHA mortgage insurance premiums\nHomeowners' association (HOA) fees\nIf you live in a home connected to a homeowners' association (HOA), you\u2019ll also have to pay HOA dues to help the association maintain common areas and shared amenities within the community.\nAccording to the National Association of REALTORS\u00ae (NAR), the average monthly HOA fee in the U.S. is $291 \u2014 but it can vary dramatically across the country.\n$400,000 mortgage payment FAQs\nHow much of your salary should go to your mortgage?\nThe 28/36 rule, 35/45 rule, and 25% rule are three common formulas you can use to help you determine what percentage of your income should go toward your mortgage. To meet the 28/36 rule, no more than 28% of your gross monthly income should be spent on your monthly mortgage payment, and no more than 36% should go toward monthly debt payments. The 35/45 rule recommends keeping your total monthly debt, including your mortgage payment, under 35% of your pretax income and 45% of your post-tax income. The 25% rule is the strictest since your monthly housing payment must be 25% or less of your monthly take-home pay.\nHow much income is needed for a $400,000 house?\nThe household income for a $400,000 house depends on various factors. You might be able to comfortably afford monthly mortgage payments on a $400,000 house with a $90,000 annual salary \u2014 but this assumes a 6.5% interest rate, no down payment, and no other monthly debts. It also only factors in your mortgage principal and interest. You\u2019ll probably need closer to a $105,000 salary once you factor in insurance and taxes, or even more if you have other monthly debt obligations.\nHow much are mortgage payments on $400,000?\nThat depends on many factors, including your loan term, the interest rate you qualify for, the cost of your home insurance, and the estimated cost of your property taxes. If your loan requires mortgage insurance, that will also factor in.\nThis article was edited by Laura Grace Tarpley"

Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nIn today\u2019s high-rate environment, borrowers are looking to land the lowest possible home loan rate. While most choose fixed-rate mortgages, many consider adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) too, which typically offer lower interest rates for an initial period. These days, ARMs are the most popular they\u2019ve been since 2022, accounting for about 10% of all mortgage applications, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Which is better for your situation: a fixed-rate or adjustable-rate mortgage?\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nRead more: What is a mortgage, and how does it work?\nWhat is an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM)?\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage, just like it sounds, has a mortgage interest rate that adjusts \u2014 or fluctuates across its loan term.\nMost ARMs today are known as \u201chybrid ARM\u201d loans because they have a fixed interest rate for an initial amount of time, followed by adjustment periods \u2014 when the interest rate can go either up or down. The initial fixed rate on an ARM is typically lower than what you would pay with a fixed-rate loan.\nSome common ARM terms lock in your rate for five, seven, or 10 years and then adjust it annually after the fixed period. Those are often called 5/1, 7/1, or 10/1 mortgages. Other ARM terms are available, such as a 7/6 ARM, which indicates you\u2019d have a fixed rate for seven years and then the interest rate would adjust every six months.\nMost ARMs include caps, or limits on how much your interest rate can increase or decrease during the adjustable period. Usually, there will be an initial cap on how much your mortgage can change at the first adjustment, a periodic cap that restricts how much your rate can change at each subsequent adjustment, and a lifetime cap that limits how much your interest rate can change during your entire loan term.\nFor example, if your rate during the introductory period is 6% and you have a 2/1/5 cap, your rate could only go as high as 8% or as low as 4% at the initial adjustment. Each subsequent adjustment could only change your rate by a maximum of 1%, and overall, your rate could only change by 5% over the loan's lifetime, so your maximum possible interest rate would be 11%.\nThe exact interest rate fluctuations an ARM will see depend on the margin the lender has assigned to the loan and the benchmark index rate the loan is tied to. These should be detailed in your loan documents.\nFor example, a benchmark could be an index such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), and your margin could be 2% \u2014 meaning your rate would be two percentage points above the SOFR rate.\nMost ARMs are based on a 30-year loan term. Some mortgage lenders offer a 15-year ARM \u2014 it\u2019s just rarer.\nWhat is a fixed-rate mortgage?\nA fixed-rate mortgage is less complicated than an ARM and, therefore, easier to fit into a financial plan. Unlike an ARM, a fixed-rate mortgage has the same interest rate for the life of the loan. That means your mortgage principal and interest payments stay the same until you either refinance your loan, sell the house, or pay the balance in full.\nThe most common fixed-rate mortgage terms are 15 and 30 years, but some lenders offer 10- and 20-year loans or individualized loan terms.\nA quick note: With both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgages, your monthly payment can change if your escrow costs (which cover property taxes and home insurance premiums) or your mortgage insurance costs change. This has nothing to do with what type of interest rate or loan you have, though.\nPros and cons of adjustable vs. fixed-rate mortgages\nThe biggest advantage of an ARM is that it offers a lower initial interest rate and monthly payment than a fixed-rate loan typically does. And if mortgage rates decline later, you could see your rate and payment fall.\nOn the downside, ARM rates and payments are uncertain, and you could find yourself with a higher rate and payment down the line. Because of this, ARMs can be hard to budget for and put you at a greater risk of foreclosure (because you might have trouble making payments).\nFixed-rate mortgage loans have the advantage of stable rates and payments, which makes long-term budgeting simpler. However, the disadvantage is that interest rates are higher for fixed-rate loans at the outset, and if mortgage rates decline, you would need to refinance the mortgage to take advantage of those lower rates.\nAdjustable-rate mortgage terms to know\nBefore you can decide between a fixed- versus adjustable-rate mortgage loan, you\u2019ll need to understand the terms of the ARM.\nYou should ask your lender to explain the specifics of any individual loan program you\u2019re applying for, paying special attention to the following:\n-\nLoan terms. ARM terms are written with two numbers (for example, 5/1 or 7/6). The first number indicates how long the fixed-rate period lasts, and the second number represents how frequently the mortgage rate will change after that fixed period. For instance, a \u201c1\u201d translates to a rate change once per year, and a \u201c6\u201d means the rate shifts every six months. You will also need to ask whether the total loan term is for 15 or 30 years.\n-\nIndex. The index is the benchmark for your interest rate, which can be the SOFR rate or another rate. This will determine the general trajectory of your future rate adjustments.\n-\nMargin. The margin is the percentage above the index, such as 1% or 2%. Your interest rate is calculated using the index, and then adding the margin.\n-\nCaps. Rate caps limit the amount your interest rate can increase or decrease initially, at each adjustment, and for the entire loan term. This last one is called the \u201cceiling,\u201d which is the maximum rate the lender can charge at any time during the term.\nDig deeper: Types of mortgage loans\nHow to choose a fixed- vs. adjustable-rate mortgage\nWhile fixed-rate mortgages are the most popular option on the market, an increasing number of borrowers are choosing ARMs these days \u2014 likely because today\u2019s rates are relatively high, and they believe rates will decrease in the future.\nFor the week ending Aug. 8, 2025, nearly 10% of all mortgage applicants were applying for an adjustable-rate loan. The average interest rate difference that week? Nearly a full percent. (The 30-year fixed-rate average was 6.67%. Rates averaged just 5.80% on 5/1 ARMs.)\nTo determine whether an ARM or fixed-rate mortgage is best for your situation, you\u2019ll need to consider a few factors. First, think about how long you plan to stay in the home. An ARM may make sense if you are fairly certain you will pay off the loan or move before the initial fixed-rate period ends and you risk a rate increase.\nAn ARM could also work if you anticipate an increase in your budget, such as a promised promotion with a bigger salary or a spouse who plans to return to work soon, ensuring you have the funds to cover higher payments if interest rates rise later. Similarly, if you\u2019re paying an expense now that will disappear, such as student loans, you may also feel more confident that you can afford possibly higher payments in a few years.\nFinally, if you think interest rates are likely to decline in the future, an ARM can be an attractive option. In this case, it would offer lower rates now and potentially lower rates in the future. (Just make sure you\u2019re financially prepared in case the opposite happens, and rates rise.)\nUltimately, a fixed-rate loan may be the better choice if you prefer a steady payment or plan to stay in your home for the long term. This also might be the best voice If you have unpredictable income, because predictable monthly mortgage payments can help you budget and plan ahead, regardless of what\u2019s happening in the broader market.\nLearn more: How to get a mortgage\nHow to qualify for a fixed-rate mortgage vs. an ARM\nWhile the loan terms differ for an adjustable-rate mortgage versus a fixed-rate mortgage, the qualification process is similar. Your lender will review your credit score, income, assets, and debt-to-income ratio, which compares the minimum monthly payment on all debt with your gross (pre-tax) monthly income.\nLenders are often stricter on debt-to-income ratios for ARMs, as they come with higher risks of non-payment.\nMost ARMs require a down payment of 5%, though some may allow as little as 3% down. Remember that the higher your down payment, the better your interest rate will typically be.\nRead more: Best low- and no-down payment mortgage lenders\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nFixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgage FAQs\nIs it ever a good idea to choose an adjustable-rate mortgage vs. fixed?\nAn ARM could be a good choice if you plan to pay off your mortgage or sell your home before the mortgage rate resets. Also, if you can easily afford your mortgage payment with a higher rate in the future, it may be worth the risk of higher rates later to pay a lower rate now.\nWhy do borrowers choose an ARM instead of a fixed-rate loan when interest rates are high?\nWhen interest rates are low, borrowers tend to want to lock in their rate for the long-term benefit. When interest rates are high, borrowers try to find a way to pay a lower rate. ARM rates are usually lower than fixed rates during the first few years of the loan.\nWhat is the main downside of an adjustable-rate mortgage vs. a fixed-rate mortgage?\nThe main disadvantage of an ARM is the risk that interest rates can rise, increasing your mortgage payment. This can make payments hard to predict and budget for, and it puts you at a higher risk of foreclosure down the line.\nCan you refinance an ARM into a fixed-rate mortgage?\nYes, you can refinance an ARM into either a fixed-rate mortgage or a new ARM. You might want to do this when your initial fixed-rate period is almost up or if you want to remove private mortgage insurance (PMI), for example.\nDo you need 20% down for an ARM?\nNo, you do not need a 20% down payment for an adjustable-rate mortgage. Conventional ARMs typically require just 5% down. Some lenders may offer ARMs with down payments as low as 3%.\nLaura Grace Tarpley edited this article."

Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nFor the second week in a row, mortgage interest rates have barely moved. The average 30-year fixed rate is down two basis points and is still 21 basis points higher than last year. The 15-year fixed rate hasn\u2019t changed at all this week and is up 18 basis points since last August. \u201cIs this a good time to buy a house?\u201d\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nIn this article:\nAre mortgage rates dropping?\nAs of August 28 this year, Freddie Mac reported that rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages were 6.56%. Although they have inched down since last week, they\u2019re still up 21 basis points from last August. This time last year, mortgage rates were averaging 6.35%.\nConsidering rates are still above 6.5%, we get it if you feel like you can\u2019t catch a break in the current economy\nIn situations like these, it pays to look at the numbers. Here\u2019s the Freddie Mac data on mortgage rates for the past 52 weeks as of August 7, 2025:\n-\n30-year fixed-rate mortgage: 6.08% to 7.04%\n-\n15-year fixed-rate mortgage: 5.15% to 6.27%\nIf you just go by the numbers, rates on both 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages remain mostly below the highs noted above. So, yes, mortgage rates have decreased incrementally over the past year. Will they keep dipping? That remains to be seen.\nDive deeper: Will mortgage rates go back up to 7%?\nSo, will mortgage rates go down at all this year?\nIf you\u2019re looking for a substantial interest rate drop in 2025, you\u2019ll likely be left waiting. The latest news from the Federal Reserve and other key economic data point toward steady mortgage rates on par with what we see today.\nThe latest from the Federal Reserve\nWhen the Fed \u2014 the common nickname for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) \u2014 held its July 2025 meeting, it voted to keep the federal funds rate the same for the time being. After cutting its rate three times at the end of 2024, it has yet to slash the rate in 2025.\nThat federal funds rate tends to directly influence rates on shorter-term lending. While mortgage rates aren\u2019t directly based on the fed funds rate, they typically mirror fed fund rate trends. So, if the fed funds rate goes up, mortgage rates will likely follow. The inverse is also true.\nThe next Fed meeting is set for September 16 and 17. According to the CME FedWatch tool, there\u2019s roughly an 87% chance that the fed funds rate will decrease at this meeting. However, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean rates will follow suit. When people anticipate a fed funds rate cut, mortgage rates usually fall in the weeks leading up to the meeting.\nSo, mortgage rates might not fall much more significantly in 2025.\nLearn more: How the Fed rate decision impacts mortgage rates\nThe latest on 10-year Treasury yields\nWhile short-term lending rates closely follow the fed funds rate, mortgage rates more closely follow the 10-year Treasury yield. As of Aug. 26, the 10-year Treasury yield sat at 4.26% \u2014 up from 3.82% a year prior.\nYou\u2019re probably wondering why today\u2019s mortgage rates aren\u2019t in the 4% range, right?\nTo determine current mortgage rates, lenders add a \u201cspread\u201d to the 10-year Treasury yield. The spread is simply the difference between the rates consumers pay and the rate on the 10-year Treasury. Without getting too much into the weeds, charging a spread helps mortgage lenders cover costs associated with making loans to the public and the risk of providing such loans.\nFor example, the current average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.56%, and the 10-year Treasury yield is 4.26% \u2014 a spread of 2.30%.\nRead more: When will mortgage rates finally go back down to 5%?\nShould you wait to buy until mortgage rates go down?\nIn short, no. You probably shouldn\u2019t wait to buy a home until mortgage rates drop. Mortgage rates are just one part of the affordability equation. You also have to consider home prices, a factor of housing supply and demand.\nThe current housing market is in a crunch. To put it simply, buyers outnumber homes for sale, especially homes in price ranges accessible to the first-time home buyer. When supply and demand are out of balance like this, home prices tend to remain high since sellers know they\u2019ll have multiple buyers interested.\nAccording to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the median sale price of single-family homes has generally trended upward since Q1 of 2009. At that time, the median sale price was $208,400. The median price had risen to $410,800 by Q2 2025.\nWhile recession chatter has recently increased, prospective buyers likely won\u2019t see much relief in a true recession. If interest rates drop like they tend to do in recessions, that will increase the number of people looking to buy and lock in a lower interest rate. That drives up demand for the already limited supply of homes.\nTo truly save, buyers need both interest rates and home prices to drop. Mortgage rates are inching down this month, and housing prices are stagnant or even lowering in certain parts of the country. Still, rates are higher than they were this time last year, and prices are still increasing in many cities. Situations may be improving for buyers, but there\u2019s a lot of work to be done.\nKeep reading: Do mortgage rates go down in a recession?\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nStrategies for buyers in today\u2019s mortgage market\nIf you crave the comforts of homeownership, the best strategy in today\u2019s market may be to buy what you can afford. Whether that means a smaller house or a condo instead of a single-family home, owning something puts you in a position to start building equity.\nYes, shopping for the best mortgage lenders with low rates and fees is crucial when getting a mortgage. But to help you find your ideal home that balances affordability and desirability, it pays to adopt a curious mindset and consider lesser-discussed financial tools.\nGet curious\nThere\u2019s no better time to learn more about your local real estate market than today. By adopting a sense of curiosity, you could discover that your city has more to offer housing-wise than you previously thought.\nYou may want to take weekend excursions to lesser-known neighborhoods and suburban developments beyond the city limits. You never know what you\u2019ll find that could expand your idea of what \u201chome\u201d looks like \u2014 including new developments, school districts, and types of homes.\nLearn more: This map shows average mortgage rates by state\nConsider a fixer-upper\nIf you\u2019re looking to spend less on a home in today\u2019s mortgage market, a house needing a bit of TLC could help you do just that. Loans like the FHA 203(k) mortgage can roll your purchase and renovation costs into one convenient loan. When you qualify and have an accepted offer, your lender immediately funds the home\u2019s purchase price and puts the cost of renovations into an escrow account. As you make repairs, funds get dispersed.\nRethink your commute\nHow would it feel to have a longer commute yet come home to a house you love? Master-planned communities tend to crop up outside major cities, offering amenities like parks, shopping, and top-notch schools \u2014 all in exchange for a longer commute. These areas could look a lot more palatable if they offer commuting options like park-and-ride or commuter rail. Dare to consider parking the car and taking public transit if it could get you into the home of your dreams.\nGo condo\nWhile shared walls, floors, and ceilings might not immediately scream \u201cdream home,\u201d they could help you find an affordable home in a terrific area. Condominiums come in various shapes and sizes, from apartment-style flats to townhomes. Depending on the area, you might even score a small backyard. However, be sure to consider HOA fees when calculating your monthly payment.\nConsider a 15-year mortgage\nWhile the monthly payment on a 15-year mortgage will be higher than the typical 30-year, these loans have plenty of upsides. Not only will you pay off your home on a speedier timeline, but you\u2019ll also likely score a lower interest rate and save a ton on interest over the life of your loan.\nExplore rate buydowns\nTo make today\u2019s mortgage rates more palatable, look into rate buydown options. An interest rate buydown lets you pay cash up front in exchange for a reduced interest rate on your mortgage. Buydowns can be permanent or temporary (for your loan's first one to three years, for example). Even a few years of lower rate relief can make today\u2019s home prices more affordable.\nLearn more: What will mortgage rates do over the next five years?\nWhen will mortgage rates go down? FAQs\nHow soon will mortgage interest rates go down?\nMortgage rates probably will not drop significantly before autumn. The August Fannie Mae Housing Forecast predicts that rates will continue to decrease gradually but will stay above 6% throughout 2025 and 2026.\nIs 7% a high mortgage rate?\nCompared to historical mortgage rates, 7% isn\u2019t considered a high rate. While it might be high compared to pandemic-era rates that were sub-3%, it\u2019s on par with mortgage rates in the 1990s, and considerably lower than the double-digit rates seen in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\nIs it impossible to get a 3% interest rate on a mortgage?\nIt\u2019s not impossible to get a 3% interest rate, but doing so requires the perfect set of circumstances. You\u2019d need to find a homeowner with an assumable mortgage \u2014 one that can be passed to a new owner at the same interest rate as the original loan. Assumable mortgages are generally government-backed loans from agencies like the VA, FHA, or USDA.\nLaura Grace Tarpley edited this article."
