  "title": "US Offers $1B in Funding to Scale Critical Mineral Supply Chains",
  "description": "The US Department of Energy intends to offer funding opportunities totaling nearly $1 billion \u201cto advance and scale mining, processing, and manufacturing technologies across key stages of the critical minerals and materials supply chains,\u201d it says in a statement. The funding would accelerate the US critical minerals and materials sector and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers, according to officials. Factorial CEO Siyu Huang joins Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss rare earth mineral supply chains, the company's Mercedes partnership, solid state battery manufacturing, and more. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "I would say there has been a lot of discussions about the rare earth metals recently, how U.S. is securing that. Fortunately, battery doesn't really have those rare earth metals. And between lithium, cobalt and nickel, those are critical for lithium ion batteries, but they're actually transition metals. And especially for factorial, we're not using LPI, which is also a critical material that has been quite constrained from the China market. And also we don't use that as well. So I think to that extent we have been very well protected from the global supply chain constraints. But also we are also want to be aware of the potential threats coming up. Right now, we actually have been actively working not only just to work with direct suppliers and building the supply chain coalition, but also working with recycling partners. You know, recently we announced this partnership with a Korean conglomerate, South Gil, and they are one of the largest recycling recyclers in the space, not only for lithium ion batteries, but they have done a lot for the battery as well. So I think that's actually going to be deeply protect us with a closed loop supply chain, a future, especially when a company is at scale. Forgive me. Solid state batteries. What exactly are they? I feel like we so often talk about ev batteries and. And what's going on. We throw terms around, But what exactly is a solid state battery? Which is your bread and butter, correct? Yes, Yes, exactly. Carl. And I would say solid state batteries like a traditional battery, but is instead of using a liquid electrolyte, you use a solid are qualities that stay material, which means you combine a little bit of solid, a little bit liquid together. But the solid content will stabilize the cell dramatically. And this makes it battery safe, safer, longer lasting and more powerful because you can store more energy and it's less likely to leak or catch on fire. And as you know, the biggest market for battery, cell and transportation, but actually batteries not only limit it to transportation, it is in the air, is on the water, is in robotics, and it's also everywhere of energy storage for homes and businesses. So it is fundamentally infrastructure, technology and products rather than something very small like narrowly sculpting a very specific application. And we mentioned that, as Tim said earlier, that you partnered with automotive manufacturers, including Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis, Hyundai. I'm just curious, so you guys are working together. Is there actually products on the market? Give us an idea of kind of where you guys are in this process. Yeah, that's a great question. You know, we started the collaboration with those companies many years ago, and John Bankia were our first investor in a company. And Mercedes, as the land has led our 200 million round in 2022. And since then, the company has gone a long way for our product development. We launched a first hundred MPower solid state battery with the launches in the U.S. under the keynote speech. It was very well received. Since then, we have shipped thousands of batteries to our global OEM partners, and as of May of last year, we launched our first B sample to Mercedes, which also marked the first B sample shipment to our global automotive globally for solid state batteries company, which is quite a breakthrough. And with that B sample, we actually was able to build the first vehicle together with Mercedes earlier this year and has a first vehicle rolling on a street in Stuttgart. And that also marked the first electric vehicle that's been built by a solid state battery. And it's not only the first application, a debut for this battery in a vehicle, but is also in the broader e-mobility sector as well. And what is even more exciting is that recently, not only with the automotive space, we also had a major breakthrough with the first shipment to a drone maker in North America. So that's going to be a very important near-term application for this technology at a small scale. Couple of quick questions. So we go back to and I think you talked about this in terms of battery is part of the problems. I mean, EVs, yay, Like people like them. But then there's the batteries, right? That, you know, the waste and what happens with batteries because you kind of can't do much with them. So I'm just curious about what happens with these batteries if they after they don't work, what's the kind of, I don't know, recycling abilities or capabilities. Just give us an update on that. Yeah, recycling is definitely very important to close the loop and not only just from the circular economy perspective, but is important for the cost and supply chain resiliency in the future. And I think in a in a near term, what we see is that a lot of the battery recycling is coming to two pieces. One is for the the scrapping of the battery and the vehicle as a whole. And number part number two is about using those scrap materials. It turned it into a black math and from the black math to refine that into the raw materials and turning back to the battery again. So that's the recycling process that most of the recyclers have been adopting globally. And that's why we have been very aggressively working with actually two Korean recyclers right now and both have a strong presence in the U.S.. And Yahoo! That's the one we actually announced last year in front of us. And Gil, what is more important that I think we also need more presence in the US for solid state battery recycling the future which will become a mainstream for our energy storage and e-mobility. So yeah, we're actually working very closely with one of the US recyclers today to increase and enhance our recycling capabilities in the US. We're speaking with Sue Wang. She is founder and CEO of Factorial. She has a Ph.D. in chemistry. But I'm still trying to understand what how to build a battery so she knows how to do it. Well, what's interesting is you sound like you're making progress and you talk about the first vehicle with Mercedes and the first shipment to I think it was a drill company. I think in the U.S., forgive me if I didn't hear it correctly, auto companies. So that will probably be the first application is actually not only for commercial, but also defense applications for batteries. So how do you ramp up? When do you ramp up? So it sounds like you're still kind of finding your way forward. So when when is there a mass production point that makes you a viable, financially viable company going forward? Yeah. So we are actually having another fleet coming up from the first vehicle. So as we announced with Mercedes for the first vehicle this year, which we built and delivered already were actually housing with the fleet coming up in 2026 with the scientists, we just announced a major milestone that both companies achieved last month to deliver this 2026 fleet that's led by Dodge Charger Daytona. And it's not only just for Dodge, but it's also span across the Stella large platform, which including Jeep, Chrysler, Alfa Romeo and Maserati. And so with the fleeting 26, we're looking at 27 for the first commercial deployment and as early as 28 or 29 that we can see the scale coming up for this market. But even before that, we may say like draw market at some of the defense applications may come even had of 2027.",
