  "content": "Los Angeles Chargers linebacker Tre'Mon Morris-Brash, left, sacksDetroit Lions quarterback Hendon Hooker, right, in the second half of the Pro Football Hall of Fame NFL preseason game Thursday, July 31, 2025, in Canton, Ohio. (AP Photo/David Richard) AP\n\nALLEN PARK -- In a competition with Kyle Allen to back up Jared Goff, Lions quarterback Hendon Hooker knows his performance in last Thursday\u2019s Hall of Fame Game against the Chargers didn\u2019t meet the mark.\n\n\u201cA zero out of 10,\u201d Hooker told reporters when asked to rate his showing. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t to my standards or the team\u2019s standards of just being productive and controlling the huddle and making plays.\u201d\n\nHooker started the second half in Canton, completing 3 of 6 passes for 18 yards and an interception. He was sacked twice and ran three times for nine yards.\n\nIt was hardly the showing Hooker wanted as he looks to solidify himself as Detroit\u2019s No. 2 quarterback. This opportunity previously belonged to Teddy Bridgewater in recent years.\n\nStill, it\u2019s fair to wonder what Hooker might have done with a full first-half workload, like the one Allen received.\n\nAllen went 9 of 14 for 91 yards and two interceptions, both of which came in the opening quarter.\n\n\u201cOffensively, you like to see \u2013 just to get down there in that red zone a little bit more,\u201d Lions head coach Dan Campbell said. \u201cAnd that requires not turning the ball over, as we know, converting on first downs, but that would be the big thing. Whereas joint practices, you know, you\u2019re going to get those. You\u2019re going to get plenty of your base reps, red zones, third downs, all of those.\u201d\n\nWhen the Lions face the Atlanta Falcons this Friday at Mercedes-Benz Stadium -- their second of four preseason games -- Hooker will start the first half. Allen will take over in the second.\n\n\u201cJust play the next play, have short-term memory, and just continue to motivate my teammates,\u201d Hooker said about overcoming last week\u2019s play. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here to do -- push my troops down the field and put the ball into the end zone.\u201d\n\nHooker isn\u2019t offering excuses for the outing. He said the focus remains on execution, and he understands how crucial each snap is -- whether it\u2019s his decision-making or delivery from the pocket.\n\nEven with the starting nod this week, his mindset won\u2019t change.\n\n\u201c(I\u2019ll) prepare the same way,\u201d Hooker said. \u201cI\u2019ll play with that same confidence and swagger and have fun.\u201d",

      "text": "ALLEN PARK -- A pair of former Detroit Lions saw their NFL journeys head in opposite directions this week as teams continue to shuffle rosters during training camp.\nThe Indianapolis Colts released cornerback Corey Ballentine after just one week of camp. Ballentine signed a one-year, $1.337 million deal this offseason, including $482,500 guaranteed. The Colts re-signed veteran nickelback Chris Lammons in a corresponding move.\nIndianapolis had waived Lammons in January.\nIn a separate transaction, the Minnesota Vikings signed former Lions offensive lineman Matt Nelson. They waived rookie defensive lineman Alexander Williams with an injury designation.\nBallentine, 29, was a sixth-round pick by the New York Giants in 2019 and has now spent time with seven NFL teams. That includes a brief stint in Detroit after the Lions claimed him off waivers from the New York Jets in September 2021.\nHe appeared in four games for the Lions, primarily contributing on special teams, where he played 48 snaps and returned four kicks for 94 yards. Ballentine has also had stops in Atlanta, Arizona, and Green Bay.\nNelson, also 29, joined the Lions in 2019 as an undrafted free agent out of Iowa, where he played defensive line. Detroit converted him to offensive tackle, and he went on to appear in 43 games (14 starts) from 2020-23. 11 of those starts came during the 2021 season, when the Lions won just three games during Dan Campbell\u2019s first season as head coach.\nNelson mainly lined up at right tackle and was frequently used as an extra lineman in heavy personnel packages.\nLatest Detroit Lions news:\n- Lions QB gives himself brutal rating after performance versus Chargers\n- Observations: Detroit Lions\u2019 defense continues to look strong in camp\n- What the Lions didn\u2019t get to see in their first preseason game\n- This Lions OL had the perfect response when asked where he prefers to play\n- Lions fans can get free shipping on this Calvin Johnson Hall of Fame hoodie, but they\u2019ll have to act fast"

      "text": "ALLEN PARK -- In a game full of dark spots, Detroit Lions offensive lineman Colby Sorsdal was one of the few bright ones coming out of Thursday\u2019s 34-7 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers.\nSorsdal, who\u2019s entering his third NFL season, has had an up-and-down tenure in Detroit, with fans questioning if the former William & Mary standout will reach his full potential and be a key piece on the offensive line.\nOf players with at least 10 snaps, Pro Football Focus had Sorsdal as one of the five highest-graded offensive players with a 74.2. Playing 24 snaps (45%) during the Hall of Fame game, Sorsdal showed promise adjusting to life at guard and was pretty solid in the run game.\nWhen speaking with MLive, Sorsdal credited Lions offensive line coach and run game coordinator Hank Fraley for his growth.\n\u201cThe continuity is awesome with Hank,\u201d Sorsdal said. \u201cHe really gets the guys going in our run games, humming, and I feel like that\u2019s our bread and butter. So we\u2019re going to keep it rolling, and it\u2019s feeling great right now.\u201d\nSorsdal is one of the Lions\u2019 most versatile offensive linemen, having been shifted around in many spots during the past few seasons, allowing the coaching staff to see where his best fit is.\nBecause of how the coaching staff has moved him around, Sorsdal shared the difficulties of compartmentalization and having to share the memory, likened to a goldfish.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie. It\u2019s difficult, but I\u2019m up for the challenge just like any of us are,\u201d Sorsdal said. \u201cSo it\u2019s exciting. You just need something to get out there. So anything I can do to help the team is what I\u2019m willing to do.\u201d\nWhen asked if he has a preference for where the staff chooses to line him up, Sorsdal joked, \u201cOffensive line,\u201d essentially showcasing a willingness to do what is asked of him as long as he is seeing playing time.\nWith the Lions having several exits from Sorsdal\u2019s unit, specifically the former center Frank Ragnow\u2019s sudden retirement and the departure of offensive lineman Kevin Zeitler, who bolted Detroit for Tennessee, there\u2019s been some concern for how the unit would gel heading into their 2025 campaign.\nSimilar to Graham Glasgow\u2019s comments from last week, Sorsdal highlighted there are some things that the offensive line needs to \u201cclean up,\u201d specifically from the pass protection.\nHowever, with it still being incredibly early in their training camp, he is confident his unit will be able to make the corrections before the season starts and address the mistakes in the film room.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always taken pride, especially just as the offensive line, as the next band up kind of mentality, and with these young cats in there, it\u2019s everybody\u2019s kind of nervous, but man, we\u2019re just like, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s roll, man. Go put the pads on, strap it up, and run through somebody\u2019s face.\u2019 So we\u2019re excited, we feel great.\u201d\nLatest Detroit Lions news:\n- Lions QB gives himself brutal rating after performance versus Chargers\n- Lions news: Ex-DB cut by Colts, former OL signs with division rival\n- Observations: Detroit Lions\u2019 defense continues to look strong in camp\n- What the Lions didn\u2019t get to see in their first preseason game\n- Lions fans can get free shipping on this Calvin Johnson Hall of Fame hoodie, but they\u2019ll have to act fast"

      "text": "ALLEN PARK \u2014 The Detroit Lions\u2019 first preseason game was about as rocky as it could\u2019ve gone with five turnovers and a 27-point defeat to the Los Angeles Chargers.\nHowever, the result of an exhibition isn\u2019t as key for the Lions as getting to see what their team looks like at this point in training camp.\nTo that end, the Lions want to see their players in a plethora of game situations during preseason matchups. The first time around, the Lions got some good opportunities, but coach Dan Campbell shared what and where he\u2019d still like to see his team get some live reps.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see more first downs on offense,\u201d Campbell joked during a press conference on Sunday.\n\u201cIf anything, yeah, you\u2019d like to have felt like you got down in the red zone a little bit more offensively and got some of those reps...And that requires not turning the ball over, as we know, and then converting on first downs. But that would be the big thing.\u201d\nThe Lions made just one trip to the red zone the entire night and crossed into Chargers territory on four of 10 total drives.\nTurnovers and slow offensive play \u2014 1-for-11 on third downs \u2014 led to the Lions having few chances to get in those clutch situations in the red zone.\nQuarterback Kyle Allen did help guide the Lions to their lone trip to the red zone in the first quarter, converting on a pair of fourth downs before running back Craig Reynolds found the end zone from three yards.\nThe Lions defense, on the other hand, got to experience quite a lot, with Campbell saying they got to see \u201ca little bit of everything\u201d save for a good two-minute drive.\nParticularly after the turnovers, the Chargers had great starting field position, giving the Lions\u2019 defense a handful of drives where they started deep in their own territory.\nA fumble on the opening kickoff led to a quick scoring drive, but later in the game the Lions defended three straight plays from their own five-yard line following a muffed punt. The unit forced the Chargers to settle for a chip-shot field goal.\nWhile the game itself became a real let down for Detroit, getting into those different situations out of a practice setting is a real help. The Lions will have three more preseason opportunities, starting with Friday\u2019s road game against the Atlanta Falcons.\nLatest Detroit Lions news:\n- Lions QB gives himself brutal rating after performance versus Chargers\n- Lions news: Ex-DB cut by Colts, former OL signs with division rival\n- Observations: Detroit Lions\u2019 defense continues to look strong in camp\n- This Lions OL had the perfect response when asked where he prefers to play\n- Lions fans can get free shipping on this Calvin Johnson Hall of Fame hoodie, but they\u2019ll have to act fast"
