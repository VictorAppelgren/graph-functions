  "content": "13 Of The Best Motorcycles For Riders Over 50\n\nAs we grow older, we think more about our health. That often means more regular checkups, eating healthy food, exercising, and trying to avoid unnecessary risks, which includes riding a motorcycle. Riding a bike doesn't have the best reputation as a hobby. It's thrilling, yes, but it can also be very dangerous, which is why you don't see a ton of older riders. But here's the truth: growing older doesn't mean you have to hang up your helmet. It doesn't matter if you haven't ridden in 30 years or it's your first time; the thrill and excitement of riding a bike remain the same. Nevertheless, at 50 or 60, your priority should be having a bike that works with your body, not against it. That means prioritizing comfort over speed and ergonomics over engine or horsepower. The ideal bike should be comfortable with low seats, light enough to lift in the case of an emergency, and equipped with tech features that make up for the slower reflexes that old age brings. Based on these factors, here are 13 of the best motorcycles for riders over 50.\n\nThe Suzuki V-Strom 800DE is an excellent choice for older riders; you get the thrill of riding a motorcycle without the threat of aching muscles. It was launched as an adventure bike, so it's capable of handling on-road and off-road trips. The V-Strom 800DE is a bit smaller in build compared to some other big adventure models out there, and that's actually a big part of its appeal, making it feel less intimidating. Weighing in at 510 pounds, the 800DE still packs a punch. At its heart is a strong 776 cc parallel-twin engine that produces around 83 horsepower. It's enough power to feel really satisfied and confident, but not so much that you're ever worried about managing it. For riders over 50, an important feature is the suspension, which affects how bumpy the motorcycle ride is, and the V-Strom 800DE shines here. It features long-travel suspension, which is great for soaking up bumps. Other features like ABS, traction control, and Low RPM Assist work to reduce rider fatigue and sharpen your instincts, helping you feel more in control of the machine. Now, the bike's seat height is a bit tall at 33.7 inches. However, what it lacks in accessibility, it makes up for with its slim frame and comfort. The wide handlebars and plush ergonomic seat make it a great choice for longer rides. It's also been priced at a relatively average price of $11,709 for new models, making it a convenient buy.\n\nThe Honda Money 125 motorcycle is exactly as the name sounds \u2014 it's small and amusing. Though it's been described as a modern mini bike, underneath its small frame are features that make it a perfect bike for older riders. Weighing in at 231 pounds, the Honda Monkey 123 is one of the lightest street-legal motorcycles. The weight and the low 30.5-inch seat height reduce the pull of gravity, making it easier to park the bike on the street or take a sharp corner without falling under the weight of the bike. The Honda Monkey 125's power comes from a 124 cc single-cylinder engine. Though the model isn't built for speed, it can typically reach cruise speeds of about 50 to 60 mph. Gas Works ISO even reported a speed of 66mph on a 2019 model. Even though it's smaller than standard bike sizes, features like the standard ABS and modern five-speed gearbox bring back that authentic motorcycle feel. Starting at around $4,300, it's one of the most affordable mini bikes on the market, perfect for riders who want a reliable and comfortable ride.\n\nThe Kawasaki Vulcan Vaquero is the bike for riders who love getting compliments on their ride. The model has been recognised as one of the coolest-looking motorcycles, thanks to its Milwaukee-Tokyo retro style and chrome finishes. But the Vaquero doesn't just look good, it feels good, too. The low 28.7-inch seat height makes it easier to plant your feet at stops, boosting confidence and control. Additional features include a wide, cushioned saddle, floorboards, and a relaxed riding triangle, which reduce strain and stress on longer rides. Beyond physical comfort, the Vaquero comes equipped with rider-friendly tech. Features like Electronic Cruise Control, Kawasaki's K-ACT ABS (which balances front and rear braking), and an easy-to-read infotainment display make the ride smoother and less demanding. The frame-mounted fairing also helps reduce wind buffeting, adding to the relaxed touring feel. On the inside, the 1,700 cc V-twin engine delivers 81 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque, supported by a 5.3-gallon fuel tank for extended highway cruising. It's currently selling for $19,499.\n\nThe Honda CRF450L (now known as the CRF450RL) is one of those rare dual-sport bikes with dual off-road and on-road performance, making it a surprisingly versatile option for riders of any age, including those over 50. It was built after the frame and engine of Honda's famous MX bikes, but they've toned it down just enough to make it practical for riding on pavement. It's pretty light, too, weighing in at just 289 pounds, making it really quick in traffic and easy to control when you're on uneven ground. The wide-ratio six-speed transmission makes shifting gears smooth. You've got a low first gear for technical terrain, and a tall sixth that's comfortable for cruising at higher speeds, ensuring a relaxed ride whether you're commuting or adventuring. Powering all of this is a 449 cc liquid-cooled Unicam single-cylinder engine. These engines are known for being really reliable and having good low-end torque, which translates to manageable power delivery. Riders often mention how predictable and balanced the power delivery feels, no matter what kind of terrain they're on, adding to its appeal for experienced riders. For around $10,099, you're getting a bike that's tough, dependable, and surprisingly easy to live with, whether on the road or off it.\n\nThe Harley-Davidson Street Glide is a touring bike that delivers on comfort and capability without being overly complicated. It's a bit simpler than some of Harley's other big tourers, like the Ultra or Road Glide Limited, but that's part of the appeal. Design-wise, it retains the classic batwing fairing and the Milwaukee-Eight 117 engine under the hood, delivering just enough power for those long rides. One of the best things about it, especially for experienced riders, is the riding position. It's upright and designed to keep you in the ideal riding position, taking strain away from your back and your arms. The seat height is also quite manageable at 26.1 inches, which makes it easy to get your feet flat on the ground when you stop. Once you're moving, it handles better than you might expect for a full-size bagger. You get good, low-end power, and it feels stable on the road. Plus, cruise control comes standard, with a clear 12.3-inch infotainment display, Bluetooth, and voice control. All make navigation and taking calls a lot less of a hassle, letting you focus on the ride.\n\nLaunched back in 2001, the Yamaha FJR1300 has spent over two decades earning its reputation as one of the major sport-touring motorcycles on the market. The 1,298 cc inline-four engine delivers smooth, consistent power that you can push across the line between cruising and racing. The shaft drive keeps things simple: no chain maintenance, no mess, just quiet, predictable power when you roll on the throttle. Even as a sport bike, the FJR1300 makes room for comfort with thoughtful features like electronic suspension, cruise control, heated grips, and an adjustable windscreen. The seat and handlebars are adjustable, so you can adjust to what feels most comfortable. Despite its weight, around 642 lbs, the FJR handles well at both highway speeds and in slower situations like city traffic. Its upright riding position, wide handlebars, and assist-and-slipper clutch help make it easier to control. The FJR1300 is built to last without constant maintenance, so it's a great choice for riders looking for a reliable motorcycle.\n\nIn the 21st century, bikes are no longer just about loud engines and fuel stops. Fully electric bikes offer zero emissions and a quiet ride that doesn't compromise on performance. Among them, the Zero SR/F, by Zero Motorcycles, stands out, delivering serious performance without the engine noise of gas-powered bikes. The bike is powered by a Z-Force 75-10 motor that produces up to 113 horsepower and a huge 140 lb-ft of torque. That's enough to get you from 0\u201360 mph in just over three seconds. The 2020 SR/F model is even faster than previous models, with a top speed of 124 mph and about 200 miles of range. If you're not into pushing the limits, the bike still offers you highway cruising speeds with about 93 miles of range. One plus that comes with electric bikes is the wonder of fast chargers. In about an hour on a level 2 charger, your bike is charged up to 95% and ready to go. Though the SR/F is a bit heavier at 500 pounds, the bike still feels well-balanced and easy to handle. Also, no clutch or gear is shifting \u2014 you just need to rev up and go. And when it comes to comfort, you get a standard seat height of 31.0 inches that can be adjusted, a forward-leaning but not crouching position, and foot pegs with ground clearance. All things considered, the Zero SR/F is perfect for those over 50.",

      "text": "Is The 2024 Harley-Davidson Street Glide Motorcycle Good For Beginners?\nThe Harley-Davidson Street Glide, a touring-style motorcycle, made its debut in the 1980s and was designed with the batwing fairing the company introduced in 1969. No less ionic than the motorcycle itself, the batwing fairing provided the Street Glide with a silhouette that would become distinctly recognizable on the open highways and would go on to captivate a dedicated fan base on its own.\nFor the 2024 model year, Harley-Davidson has redesigned the Street Glide, and many of these updates make for a more comfortable ride quality. But do they make the 2024 Harley-Davidson Street Glide a good option for new riders? Conventional wisdom has it that new riders should opt for something light and inexpensive. While the new Street Glide challenges this notion with a few beginner-friendly features, it's still a bulky, powerful machine that may get tough to control unless you're a seasoned rider. To help you determine if it is a good choice for a first bike or whether you should pick a different model that's meant for a new rider, we've explored the key specs of the 2024 Street Glide below and explained the possible advantages or drawbacks of these features.\nThe engine is too powerful for a starter bike\nThe new Harley-Davidson Street Glide is fitted with a Milwaukee-Eight 117 V-Twin engine that has a displacement of 117ci (1,917cc) and delivers 105 HP at 7,600 rpm and 130 lb-ft of torque at 3,250 rpm. While these stats are undoubtedly impressive, they make the Street Glide a little too powerful for the average new rider. Motorcycles like the Honda Rebel 300 or the BMW G 310 R, both affordable bikes that have an engine displacement of around 300cc, are a better pick for someone new to riding.\nIf you have your heart set on owning a Harley (and we certainly understand that sentiment), you could even consider a pre-owned Iron 883, which has a more manageable engine displacement. Keep in mind that the Iron 883 is a cruiser and not a touring motorcycle. If you're set on buying a touring bike, you may want to look at options from brands like Suzuki and Honda, which make reliable and easy-to-handle touring and adventure motorcycles that are better suited to new riders.\nThe reason why new riders are often advised to stick to the sub-500cc category when picking a motorcycle is that these bikes are a lot easier to control and handle. More importantly, they're also cheaper to fix than an expensive Harley when you eventually make one of the many mistakes that new riders make in the process of getting used to their bikes.\nNew and improved design\nThe unique batwing fairing was one of the signature design elements of the Street Glide, so it's not surprising that Harley-Davidson hasn't deviated too much from this aesthetic when updating the fairing. For the new Street Glide, Harley-Davidson utilized computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to engineer a fairing design that reduces wind buffeting and optimizes aerodynamic efficiency. This not only improves the performance of the motorcycle but also keeps the rider comfortable during highway travel.\nThe redesigned fairing has integrated LED lighting and turn signals, as well as a split-stream vent opening. Whether you like the change in design or not, there's no denying that it improves visibility \u2014 a feature that's especially handy if you intend to do a lot of long-distance riding. As is typical for touring motorcycles, the 2024 Street Glide has saddlebags as well, which are perfect for stowing any belongings while you ride. Cycle World notes, \"The Street Glide's saddlebags have 2.42 cubic feet (68.5 liters) of capacity, which is pretty ample if you don't plan on loading them with, say, T-shirts from every Harley dealership you've ever visited.\"\nIt's lighter than before, but still heavy\nThe 2024 Street Glide weighs 774 lb. \u2014 that's 18 lb. lighter than its predecessor, the 2023 Street Glide. Having said that, it's still a heavy motorcycle. While you're in motion, you're unlikely to notice the weight of the Street Glide. In fact, you might even appreciate the road presence and stability it provides. However, if you ever have to walk your bike backward or pick it up in case it tips over, that's when you're really going to feel the weight. If you're new to riding, handling a bike as heavy as this one might prove tricky. The good news, however, is that the Street Glide 2024 produces more horsepower and peak torque than its predecessor. This performance enhancement means you're less likely to feel the weight of the motorcycle while riding and maneuvering it in congested areas or on winding roads.\nThe ride quality and seating on the Street Glide are fairly comfortable as well. Harley-Davidson has updated the suspension using longer-travel rear shocks \u2014 this makes bumpy rides less taxing on the body. What's more, a Revzilla review noted that the stock seat of the Street Glide was comfortable because it \"locks you into one position, fore and aft. You can't slide forward much, and the step at your back means you can't slide back.\"\nDespite all these performance improvements, a lighter motorcycle like the Kawasaki Z400, the Honda Rebel 500, or even the Harley-Davidson Nightster, all three of which weigh under 500 lb., might be more manageable for new riders, especially if you're not particular about owning a touring motorcycle.\nUpdates Infotainment options and rider safety features\nHarley-Davidson has also updated the infotainment setup by adding a new 12.3-inch TFT touchscreen display that allows you to access navigation as well as entertainment controls with just a few taps. You also get a 200-watt amplifier as well as two 5.2\" fairing speakers that deliver crisp sound while you're on the road. Whether you're listening to navigation prompts or your playlist, you'll enjoy these infotainment updates. You can also access the built-in Ride Modes through the display and change them up if you'd like a different riding experience in terms of engine braking and power delivery.\nAnother area where the 2024 Street Glide has received a big update \u2014 and one that's pretty important for new riders \u2014 is the rider safety features. Compared to the 2023 Street Glide, which was only equipped with an Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) and Electronic Linked Braking (ELB) system as standard, the 2024 version includes ABS and ELB, as well as a traction control system, vehicle hold control, tire pressure monitoring system, drag-torque slip control system, and more. All of these features can go a long way toward keeping you safe while you're riding your motorcycle on the highways or city streets.\nIt's expensive\nHarley-Davidson carries a few affordable motorcycles, but the Street Glide isn't one of them. The motorcycle has a starting price of $25,999, with specific colors and customizations pushing that figure up even higher. For instance, opting for the Whiskey Fire color theme adds $850 to the price of the motorcycle. That's not to say you shouldn't purchase the 2024 Street Glide. However, a bike as expensive as this one is typically more suited to seasoned riders.\nRemember that learning to control a motorcycle is something that will take a good amount of skill and time. As a new rider, you're more likely to make mistakes during this process that will result in scratches, dings, or even more substantial damages. Picking a less expensive motorcycle gives you a certain degree of financial cushioning, and any possible expenses that you may have to pay for yourself won't sting as much. What's more, if this is your first bike, there's a chance you'll ride it a few times, only to realize it doesn't suit your riding style or preferences. If you've purchased something expensive like the Street Glide, you may not be able to switch to a different model, given that you will incur some amount of depreciation when you try to sell it, especially if there are any obvious signs of wear and tear or damage to the motorcycle.\nWhile the motorcycle is iconic and the 2024 updates make it all the more desirable, your first motorcycle presents a steep learning curve. An affordable Kawasaki or Suzuki motorcycle meant for beginners might be a better pick, in that these bikes might help you enjoy the learning process."

      "text": "Every Kawasaki Z Series Motorcycle Available In 2025, Ranked Cheapest To Most Expensive\nThe Kawasaki brand dates back to 1878, when founder Shozo Kawasaki established the Kawasaki Tsukiji Shipyard in Tokyo. However, its motorcycle involvement wouldn't begin until it produced it's first model in 1961. And since then, Kawasaki has improved its bikes consistently to survive and thrive in a fiercely competitive market. Whether in one of the most famous motorcycles ever made or on the MotoGP race track, the brand's built a legendary name for itself.\nEach of the Big Four builders associates its motorcycles with a few letters. Suzuki has the GSX, Honda has the CBR, and Yamaha has its YZF. For Kawasaki, it has been the letter Z, often followed by an X. Whether a part of the vaunted ZX Ninja series or the legendary GPZ900R that kickstarted the supersport era, when it came to Kawasaki, Z meant performance. There is perhaps no better evidence for the company's state than in the latest Z-series bikes to emerge from its factories.\nKawasaki has granted the Z designation to 11 of its 2025 model year motorcycles. Despite the association with serious performance, the line is broad enough to include bikes for everyone from beginners to experts at several price points. We run down the prices, specs, and target riders for each of Kawasaki's 2025 Z series motorcycles, ranked by price.\nZ125 Pro \u2014 $3,699\nThe Z125 Pro kicks off Kawasaki's 2025 offerings, being cheaper and smaller than any other Z-series headed our way this year. Most companies take care to develop solid small-displacement motorcycles. After all, getting new riders into your ecosystem at the beginning could guarantee decades of brand loyalty. Still, 125cc is smaller than many would expect.\nAt first glance, the styling of the Z125 doesn't let on to its diminutive stature. It has rakish angles and a mean half-fairing streetfighter look, and it's only next to something that its scale becomes apparent.\nA 2-gallon fuel tank feeds a single-cylinder engine via a fuel injection system. The Z125 Pro is no minibike with electric start, a four-speed manual Kawasaki transmission, and a sophisticated digital dash. It even offers a quartet of suspension preloads to tailor to your riding style, including adding a passenger.\nYou should hope your passenger isn't that heavy, though. The Z125 is a neat little bike, and it could be the perfect introduction to street riding for the right rider. Unfortunately, that rider would need to be small and light to get the most out of it. But starting at between $3,699 and $3,899 plus a destination fee of $305, the price is certainly right.\nZ500 \u2014 $5,599\nA significant step up in displacement leads us to the next bike on the list, the Z500. As the name suggests, this bike approaches the 500cc class, with an official displacement of 451cc. Splitting the displacement is a pair of parallel cylinders in a liquid-cooled engine mated to a six-speed transmission. Kawasaki claims a power rating of 51 hp at 10,000 RPM and 31.7 lb-ft of torque at 7,500 RPM. Considering the overall curb weight of 366 pounds, that's a respectable amount of horsepower.\nKawasaki intends this to be a light middleweight bike that could provide an excellent platform for gaining experience. The seat height is 30.9 inches, far lower than some supersport and adventure bikes, and suitable for shorter riders.\nYet the Z500 is not short on amenities. There are two models available. The Z500 ABS starts at $5,599 while the upscaled Z500 SE ABS asks $6,299. Both models share LCD instruments, smartphone connectivity, a slipper clutch, anti-lock braking systems, and a $600 destination charge.\nThe Z500 SE ABS includes an upgraded TFT display, pillion seat cover, tank and knee pads, USB-C outlet, and special edition graphics for those who want something a tad out of the ordinary. The Z500 would probably not be a thrill for those used to liter bikes, but most of the fun happens between 40 and 80 mph, and this little street machine could be just the ticket for the right rider.\nZ650 \u2014 $7,249\nWhile riders once had few sport bike options outside of blisteringly fast supersports, times have changed. The Z650 is another entry into Kawasaki's aggressively styled naked streetfighter aesthetic.\nEmploying a similar engine architecture to the Z500 SE ABS, the Z650 also employs a liquid-cooled parallel twin setup, though with a little more boom room for its pair of cylinders. Part of the beauty of a good middleweight is its ability to cater to a vast spectrum of riders. At 649cc, the Z650 is square in the center of the middleweight category, tipping the scales with a curb weight of 414.5 pounds.\nSet against a claimed 67 hp at 8,000 RPM and 48.5 lb-ft of torque at 6,700 RPM, the Z650 is light enough to suit beginner riders while providing intermediate and even advanced riders with enough pep to be genuinely thrilling.\nThe Z650 includes most of the gizmos and gadgets one would expect from a brand-new Big Four bike. Smartphone connectivity, a 4.3-inch TFT color display, optional anti-lock brakes, and Kawasaki's Traction Control (KTC) system with multiple modes fill out a respectable basket of goodies.\nDepending on the rider's maturity, physical dimensions, and ability, the Z650 base starts at $7,249 without ABS and $7,749 with it included. Both options add the obligatory $665 destination charge.\nZ650RS \u2014 $8,899\nThe Z650RS is another take on the 650 platform, with a few differences from the Z650, not the least of which is a bigger price tag. Kawasaki refers to the styling behind the RS as a \"retrovolution,\" and one glance at the bike shows why. Gone are the naked angles that have populated this list so far in favor of a smoother and more forgiving visual design that hearkens back to some of the most eye-catching Kawasaki motorcycles in history.\nUnder the skin, the Z650RS shares much with the Z650, including the 67 hp at 8,000 RPM and the 6,700 lb-ft of torque at 6,700 RPM. That power is sourced from the same 649cc parallel twin as the Z650. However, Kawasaki tuned the bike for low to mid-range performance, giving the RS a friendly around-town riding experience hinted at by its upright seating position and casual styling.\nThe primary difference between the Z650 and Z650RS is their looks. Some people just don't like the menace of a hyper naked or supersport bike. The RS comes in to save the day with more mellow styling and a black-and-gold color scheme that will take riders of a certain age right back to the glory days. Whether or not that feeling is worth the $8,899 price tag (plus a $665 destination charge) is up to the buyer.\nNinja ZX-4R \u2014 $8,999\nWe go down in displacement, but up in price to land on the Ninja ZX-4R. It's cordoned off on the Kawasaki website from the other bikes on this list, but this is very much a Z-series (though its lineage does overlap with the Kawasaki Ninja line).\nWhile supersport aficionados were once relegated to 600cc and 1,000cc models, motorcycle builders have sought to make the once-intimidating class a little more inviting. While some manufacturers cut displacement by reducing the number of cylinders, the ZX-4R is an exception. A 399cc inline four-cylinder powers this Ninja, making it the first bike on this list to employ the traditional supersport configuration.\nAs ready for the street as the track, the ZX-4R has the bells and whistles, including KTRC, a slipper clutch, different power modes, and smartphone connectivity. With a curb weight of 414.5 pounds and a claimed 56 hp at 11,500 RPM and 26.5 lb-ft of torque at 11,500 RPM, it promises the feel and sound of a supersport with (as much of) the risk of watching your bike cartwheel down the street without you after you tweak the throttle by accident.\nThough heavier and more experienced riders may want to opt for the ZX-4R's bigger siblings, it provides an excellent and exciting entry into the world of knee-dragging (on approved tracks with the right equipment only, of course). The bottom line is that super performance is much more accessible, and it comes in at $8,999 plus a $600 destination charge.\nZ900 \u2014 $9,999\nThe Z900 officially brings us out of bikes that could be considered for beginners. The Z900 is nothing short of a full-sized streetfighter. Its looks scream aggression, and its performance backs it up.\nA 948cc in-line four-cylinder lies at the heart of the Z900. With a claimed 123 hp at 9,500 RPM and 73 lb-ft of torque at 7,700 RPM, it's got more than enough power to keep even the most advanced riders entertained. While it might not be as featherlight as some supersport-oriented bikes, its 470-pound curb weight is hardly onerous. Heck, it even made our list of the most powerful Z-series naked bikes in Kawasaki's stable.\nKawasaki fills out the model with a slew of performance- and convenience-oriented amenities. A 5-inch TFT color screen displays critical information, including an economical riding indicator, and Kawasaki's Rideology app is present for wireless smartphone connectivity. From a performance perspective, an inertial measuring unit (IMU) works with the KTRC seen on bikes lower on the price spectrum, in addition to the Kawasaki Cornering Management Function (KCMF), and even a race-style quick-shifter.\nThe Kawasaki naked look may be an acquired taste, but if you've acquired it, the Z900 has it in spades. A tubular trellis frame embedded within Kawasaki's Sugomi design cues gives it an almost alien but undeniably menacing presence, sitting on its kickstand or screaming down an expressway. All for $9,999 plus an $815 destination fee.\nNinja ZX-6R \u2014 $11,399\nThe Ninja ZX-6R, a super street bike classic, holds a significant place in the history of motorcycles. Its reign during the '90s and early aughts is a testament to its enduring legacy, with the only major change being the shift from the 599cc engines of the old 600 class to the 636cc engine of the Ninja middleweight.\nThe extra displacement seems to do the trick, because it brings 127 hp and 52 lb-ft of torque to the party against a curb weight of 436 pounds. It also includes the fun toys like a 4.3-inch TFT display and Rideology connectivity, along with 310-millimeter front brakes linked up to Kawasaki's Intelligent Anti-Lock Brake System (KIBS) \u2014 though that last bit only comes on the ABS model.\nThe Ninja ZX-6R comes in three trims, each offering a unique combination of features and price points. The entry-level, non-ABS edition is priced at $11,399, while the ABS model is available at $12,399. Additionally, Kawa offers its KRT edition at the same price points, outfitted in Kawasaki's trademark neon-green racing livery. For those of us who fell in love with the Ninja back in the '90s, the 40th Anniversary Edition ABS with green wheels and a retro paint scheme is also available.\nZ900RS \u2014 $12,649\nThe Z900RS is to the Z900 what the Z650 RS is to the Z650. That's a lot of numbers and Zs, so we'll break it down nice and easy for you. Kawasaki's strategy seems to be providing something for everyone. As mean and menacing as the Z900 is, the RS is the softer, retro, and, we must admit, handsome sibling.\nThe bikes are technologically similar, sharing the 948cc in-line four-cylinder powerplant. The RS incorporates a classic round headlight, teardrop fuel tank, and a two-up seat that provides the passenger with more than a postage stamp of butt space.\nKawasaki offers the Z900RS in a few flavors, including the entry-level ABS model, a cafe-racer-inspired model with a front cowl in the Z900RS Cafe, and the performance-oriented Z900 RS SE ABS, which includes an Ohlins rear shock and Brembo front brakes. The fun starts at $12,649 for the entry level and climbs to $14,149 for the top-of-the-line model, not including the $815 destination charge.\nNinja ZX-14R \u2014 $17,599\nThe mighty have fallen, but not that far. The Ninja ZX-14R was once the top of the speed line for Kawasaki. Today, it has taken on a marginally more mellow role as a reborn sport-touring monster.\nA digitally fuel-injected 1,441cc in-line four-cylinder engine powers this baby to the tune of a neck-snapping 197 hp and 116.5 lb-ft of torque at 10,000 and 7,500 RPM, respectively. It weighs a bit more than the super sports with a 593-pound curb weight. A set of four-piston Brembo M50 brakes brings its bulk (if that's what you want to call it) to a smooth stop or leaning through corners. Kawasaki poured some effort into its latest ZX-14R, including a monocoque frame, KTRC, and an anti-lock braking system.\nThe design is also a departure from the other bikes on this list. The Ninja ZX-14R ditches the angles and embraces a flowing curve that makes it look like it's slicing through the wind even at a standstill. The ZX-14R is the bike for the experienced sportbike rider who is finally ready to ditch the scrunched-up seating position of the top liter bikes (looking at you, Yamaha YZF-R1). Don't get us wrong, this thing is no Gold Wing, but it provides an opportunity to blow off the young whipper snappers on R6s without losing feeling in your hands. For the right rider, that's more than worth the $17,599 plus $815 destination cost.\nNinja ZX-10R \u2014 $17,999\nFor another $500, buyers can come down from the ZX-14R to the Ninja ZX-10R. That might sound like more money for a demotion, but hear us out. The ZX-10R (and the entire 1,000cc superbike class) is a holdover from the olden days, but that doesn't mean the technology is.\nKawasaki keeps its liter bike torch lit with a 998cc four-cylinder double overhead cam engine, claiming 196 hp and 84 lb-ft of torque. That power is insane against its 456-pound curb weight, but it's just the beginning.\nKawasaki has thrown everything at the ZX-10R, including launch control, corner management, a racing quick shifter, various power modes, and a sport version of its KTC system. Chassis management includes an advanced inertial measurement unit and an intelligent anti-lock braking system.\nThe ZX-10R is arguably the most track-oriented motorcycle in Kawasaki's current stable. With its classic displacement class mated to decades of Kawasaki sportbike development, there is little a supersport aficionado can ask for that it doesn't have.\nLike the ZX-6R, the 10R comes in a few trims, including offering the paint options that come with the KRT and anniversary edition, and an upcharge for ABS that can raise the initial $17,790 asking price by $1,000 or so. Where it goes further, however, is in the $30,499 ZX-10RR trim for the hardcore track-day riders. For the extra outlay, buyers get upgraded engine internals, an Ohlins steering damper, advanced intake, and a bunch of other goodies that will make you top of the track.\nZ H2 \u2014 $21,700\nMany companies' offerings end with the supersport liter category, or perhaps a 1,000cc-plus sport cruiser a la the ZX-14R, but Kawasaki goes a step further. The Kawasaki H2R is nothing short of the fastest production motorcycle in the world, and Kawasaki offers a Z-model it terms a hypernaked.\nThe Z H2 boasts a 998cc in-line four cylinder, similar to the ZX-10R, but with a game-changing addition. Kawasaki has ingeniously integrated a supercharger into the already formidable engine. In its Z H2 form (Kawasaki manufactures several H2 variants), this results in a staggering 197 hp, equivalent to the ZX-10R, but with a torque boost from 84 to 101 lb-ft. This is an impressive feat for a bike weighing 531 pounds, considering the added weight of superchargers.\nThe Z H2 is not just a high-performance motorcycle, but also a smart investment. It comes with a full suite of Kawasaki rider aids and gadgets, making it the flagship bike in a line of new and old legendary offerings from a company that truly knows what it is doing. Priced at a reasonable $21,700 plus the standard $815 destination charge, it offers a lot of bang for your buck. For those who crave even more power, there's the $59,000 Ninja H2R with its 321 hp. It may not be a Z-bike, but it's a tempting option."

      "text": "Yamaha MT-09 Vs. Tracer 9 GT+: What's The Difference?\nShopping for a 900cc class Yamaha motorcycle presents a few options, two of which are the Yamaha MT-09 and Tracer 9 GT+. Both motorcycles use Yamaha's liquid-cooled 890cc engine. The inline three-cylinder features 78.0mm diameter cylinder-bores and a 62.1mm crankshaft stroke with an 11.5:1 compression ratio, fuel injection with YCC-T (Yamaha Chip Controlled Throttle), Transistor Controlled Ignition (TCI), dual overhead camshafts, and four valves per cylinder to deliver an estimated fuel economy of nearly 50 mpg and controlled power delivery. They also have the same \"Limited Factory Warranty\" coverage for one year.\nThe first point of divergence between the MT-09 and Tracer 9 GT+ occurs in Yamaha's motorcycle-type product category listings. The MT-09 is found in the Hyper Naked section with other MT- sizes such as -03, -07, and -10, while the Tracer 9 GT+ is listed in the Sport Touring group alongside the FJR1300ES. While the MT-09 is a contender for one of the best Yamaha motorcycles ever made, the Tracer 9 GT+ combines the aspects that make the MT-09 great into a package capable of long-distance rides.\nThe Tracer 9 GT+ is larger than the MT-09 in every way, including overall length, width, and height, wheelbase, fuel tank capacity, and weight. However, since the two contenders have different purposes, those differences play well to their respective strengths.\nA glance at the 2024 Yamaha MT-09\nThe 2024 Yamaha MT-09 starts at $10,599 MSRP and offers a relaxed riding position as a Hyper Naked style compared to some Sport Bikes. This makes the MT-09 a great choice for a commuter bike where shorter trips around town are the norm.\nOverall, the 2024 MT-09 measures 82.3 inches in length, 32.3 inches wide, and 45.1 inches tall, about 3.3 inches shorter in length, 2.5 inches narrower, and 11.2 to 12.8 inches shorter in height than the Tracer 9 GT+. It's reported 425-pound wet weight is also 67 pounds lighter by comparison.\nThe front suspension of the MT-09 features 41mm inverted forks with 5.1-inch travel and adjustable spring preload, At the rear you'll find a single shock with 4.6 inches of travel. The MT-09 allows adjustments for compression and rebound damping, both front and rear.\nThe fuel tank provided with the MT-09 holds 3.7 gallons. Combined with the estimated 48 mpg it provides a maximum range of 177.6 miles. That most likely translates to 150 usable miles, depending on your riding style and area gas station density.\nHow does the 2024 Yamaha Tracer 9 GT+ compare to the MT-09?\nFor starters, the MSRP between the two bikes differs by $5,900 with the 2024 Yamaha Tracer 9 GT+ coming in higher at $16,499. However, for the additional cost you get Yamaha's flagship sport touring bike already fitted with an adjustable windscreen, heated grips, hard touring cases, LED lights, and a center stand.\nThe Tracer 9 GT+ features KYB suspension with 5.1-inch front and 5.4-inch rear travel. The front forks feature semi-active electronically controlled damping in addition to manually adjustable spring preload, while the rear shock also offers electronic adjustment with remotely adjustable preload. The suspension uses inputs from a 6-axis IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) that monitors linear, vertical, sideways, pitch, roll, and yaw movements, the radar-linked Adaptive Cruise Control, and Unified Brake System to automatically adjust to riding conditions.\nWith its 5.0-gallon fuel tank and estimated 49 mpg, the Tracer 9 GT+ has a maximum range of 245 miles. However, if you're in a sparsely populated area without a gas station every other block, we'd recommend refueling somewhere around the 200-mile mark."

      "text": "Zero Motorcycles SR/F Electric Bike Gets Faster And More Connected\nThe electric motorcycle world just got smarter, with Zero Motorcycles revealing its new connected street bike. The 2020 Zero SR/F will sit at the top of the bike-maker's range, with up to 200 miles of range and a top speed of 124 mph.\nIt uses Zero's new ZF75-10 motor, paired with the ZF14.4 lithium-ion battery. The new powertrain is air-cooled, and packs 110 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque. Zero isn't talking about 0-60 mph times at this point, but does say that the SR/F will hit a sustained top speed of 110 mph.\nTwo versions of the bike will be offered, the SR/F Standard and the SR/F Premium. The former has a 3 kW Rapid Charger as standard, which takes 80 minutes to go from 0- to 95-percent on the standard battery. The Premium version gets a 6 KW Rapid Charger, which cuts that down to 60 minutes.\nThe standard battery, meanwhile, has 14.4 kWh capacity max and a nominal capacity of 12.6 kWh. It's good for 161 miles in the city or 99 miles at 55 mph highway speed; that drops to 82 miles if you cruise at 70 mph instead. If you want the 200 mile maximum range you'll need Zero Motorcycle's so-called Power Tank, an extra battery.\nArguably more important is the Rapid Charge System. That splits the battery array into three independent charging modules, hence delivering the shorter charging times. It's all mounted on a steel-trellis frame with a concentric swingarm.\nThe Zero SR/F isn't just about performance, though. It's also the bike-maker's smartest model, debuting the Cypher III operating system and a Motorcycle Stability Control system from Bosch. Cypher III links the electronics system of the SR/F together, with Street, Sport, Eco, and Rain drive modes, and the ability for the rider to customize up to 10 modes of their own.\nDual radial front brakes are standard, along with ABS, traction control, and drag torque control. The motorcycle's new dashboard, meanwhile, taps into the new connected features. That can send bike status alerts to your smartphone \u2013 if charging is interrupted, the SR/F is tipped over, or is moved unexpectedly \u2013 and show its location, as well as controlling charging patterns. Riders will be able to schedule charging and set target charge levels, even from afar.\nNOW READ: Inside Zero Motorcycles\nRide data sharing, meanwhile, will log bike location, speed, lean angle, power, torque, state of charge, and how much energy has been used or regenerated. Zero will allow that data to be shared, either linked to a rider's username or anonymously. In the future, the company plans to release new Cypher III OS updates as well.\nThe SR/F Standard will be priced from $18,995, while the SR/F Premium \u2013 with the 6 kW charger, a fly screen, heated hand grips, and aluminum bar ends \u2013 will start at $20,995. Each will come with two years of connected service, and be available in Seabright Blue and Boardwalk Red finishes. Zero says they should arrive in dealerships this spring."

      "text": "10 Of The Most Eye-Catching Kawasaki Motorcycles In History\nAlthough the manufacturing company known as Kawasaki has origins in the Victorian era, its production of two-wheeled machines came much later. Motorcycle engine manufacturing began in 1953 with the KE1, but not until 1962 did a motorcycle wear the company's badge, the Kawasaki 125cc B8, which used engineering first perfected in the company's aircraft from before WWII. Since then, the company has produced a wide range of motorcycles while establishing itself as an innovator and leader in the field.\nKawasaki's home is in Tokyo, Japan, but it has operations worldwide with manufacturing operations both in Japan and abroad. From these many facilities have come machines of all stripes to cater to the needs and desires of riders on and off the road, with many of them pushing the boundaries of performance and handling. Kawasaki bikes over the years have never been short on style, with many of its models setting trends that influenced the industry at large. With dozens of models released over the last 60 years, choosing the most stylish among them may not be the most straightforward task, but these bikes are the most eye-catching of them all.\nKawasaki GPZ 550/750/1100\nWhile sophisticated and powerful sportbikes are a common sight on the streets today, that has not always been the case. Manufacturers worked to discover what worked for street bikes throughout the '60s and '70s. But at the dawn of the '80s, new designs with advanced engineering emerged to set the stage for the sportbike showdown that would occur in the ensuing years. Kawasaki's contribution to what would become one of the most popular segments in the market came as the GPZ in 1981 through 1983, available with engine sizes of 550, 750, and 1,100 cc.\nThe GPZ line made a significant departure in terms of styling from what had dominated throughout the '70s. Most Asian machines from the 1970s bore similarities to each other in a style that has since been defined as the Universal Japanese Motorcycle (UJM), featuring chrome exhaust pipes, fenders and trim, and bright aluminum engine blocks for all to see. The GPZ eschewed all the bright work for matte black surfaces on all the exposed mechanicals with shiny red paint on the fenders, tank, and side panels. Furthermore, the GPZ introduced a small fairing as a precursor to the full body panels that adorn today's sportbikes.\nThis was the look of things to come and remains sporty and appealing today. Fortunately, performance went with the updated looks as Kawasaki managed to squeeze a bit more power from its well-tested air-cooled 4-cylinder engines before entering into the superbike era.\nKawasaki W800\nKawasaki in the 1950s wanted to expand its operations beyond simply making motorcycle engines to start building complete bikes. In making such a big transformation of the company, it needed guidance and received it when it acquired Meguro motorcycles, in operation since before WWII, in 1960, and folded those operations into its own soon after. The immediate result of this combination was the Kawasaki-Meguro K2, which became the Kawasaki W1 in 1965.\nThis was a consequential and pivotal model for the company, which is why Kawasaki chose to bring it back in the form of the thoroughly modern yet classically styled W800 for the 2019 model year. While this bike bears a striking resemblance to the brand's first genuinely competitive street bike, riders benefit from the advantages that 50 years of motorcycle development afford. It features a fuel-injected parallel twin producing 47 horsepower with the safety of anti-lock disc brakes to rein it in.\nDespite having modern niceties, the W800 is a beautifully styled retro motorcycle. It apes the original so fully that it looks like a vintage bike from a distance, and it helps that the original was a looker to begin with. With so many retro styled machines turning out to be modern flops, it's pleasing to see how well Kawasaki has done with the W800.\nKawasaki KZ1000\nIn the mid-'70s, Kawasaki began offering a range of motorcycles all built around the same basic styling with similar setups for performance and handling. These motorcycles bearing the KZ prefix ranged from 200 to 1,300cc in the years from 1976 through 1984, although the KZ1000-based Police 1000 survived until 2005. Among all of these models, the KZ1000 might be the most popular and has since become an icon of its time.\nWhen it debuted, the KZ1000 was proclaimed by Cycle World to be the \"quickest production bike we've tested\" and \"King of the Superbikes,\" which is high praise indeed. Having already established itself with its powerful and groundbreaking Z1, Kawasaki upped the ante with its successor by improving on everything that worked. It received more power, better handling, and smoother styling.\nKawasaki's styling of the KZ lineup followed the trend of the UJM, establishing them as desirable motorcycles distinct from European and American machines that came with the added benefit of legendary Japanese reliability. Although a KZ1000 may look a bit antiquated compared to modern offerings, it remains a desirable machine for those who appreciate a bike without superfluous styling and added flair for no reason. It is just a bike, and that is a beautiful thing.\nKawasaki LTD 550\nAlongside Kawasaki's popular KZ models introduced in the late '70s were its companion LTD series of bikes. Built on the same frames and with the same engines, the LTD showed Kawasaki's recognition of the popularity of the American cruiser market and began making bikes that aped the classic American v-twins without going overboard.\nIntroduced in 1980, the LTD 550 introduced a middleweight-cruiser-inspired motorcycle that was capable across many fronts. As a relatively lightweight machine, it was easy to ride while offering good handling for its day. The experience would not overcome a novice rider while being substantial enough for a seasoned pro. Furthermore, the air-cooled 553cc 4-cylinder provided plenty of power for the most spirited of highway drives and punch to dart through traffic with ease.\nThe design of the bike is a bit of a dichotomy as its swept-back handlebars, semi-teardrop gas tank, and dual-level saddle provided a bit of a cruiser look while its mostly upright riding position sitting high on the frame kept the riding style of the UJM popular at the time. Today, these bikes are relatively affordable \u2014 a pristine example last sold on Bring a Trailer for $2,200 \u2014 without being so scarce as to be unobtainable, and they make great classic bikes to own for those wanting to keep expenses down. Plus, they still look great.\nKawasaki 1400GTR / Concours 14\nThe recently discontinued Concours line of motorcycles was a great option for those who doing serious touring on two wheels. With Kawasaki having moved well away from the bikes it built in the '70s and '80s, the modern Concours, introduced for the 2008 model year as a wholly redesigned update of the 1986 to 2006 Concours ZG1000, is the epitome of luxury on two wheels.\nTouring bikes often act as a showcase of technological development for a manufacturer, and the Kawasaki Concours is no different. Furthermore, touring bikes are different from other bikes \u2013 riders tend to use them for extra long rides. If you are going to build a bike with the best and latest features for safety, comfort, and performance, the touring bike is the ideal choice, including the Concours. Upon its debut, standard features included an electrically adjustable windscreen, dual headlights, an adjustable rear shock, and a powerful fuel-injected engine.\nBy the end of its run in 2022, the Concours 14 had remained largely unchanged stylistically. It gained anti-lock brakes, keyless ignition, and variable valve timing, but appearance alterations were kept to a minimum, which is not a bad thing as it already possessed grateful and modern lines from end to end. Most riders of the Concours 14 likely appreciate it for being a sophisticated and modern bike made for tackling a mountain pass over something made for showing off with shiny accessories on the main drag. It's a bike built to ride.\nKawasaki Mach III H1 500\nWhile environmental regulations led to two-stroke engines disappearing from motocross, they dominated on dirt bike tracks and trails until very recently. However, buzzy two-bangers once roamed freely roamed the streets and weren't always limited to mopeds and minibikes. Just as Japanese motorcycles were carving out a larger section of the late 1960s American market, Kawasaki released the Mach III H1 500, also affectionately called \"The Widowmaker.\"\nThe Mach III debuted in 1959 featuring a brand-new engine from the company that boasted having three cylinders, 60 horsepower, and only two cycles. Mounted to a modestly sized frame and adorned with simply styled adornments, the unassuming and lightweight Kawasaki opened up a terror on the streets and tracks that proved to be a menace to rider and bystander alike.\nWhile the looks of this bike are not particularly outstanding compared to its contemporaries, the sound of that two-stroke triple is something to behold. It provides an aural aesthetic as pleasing to the ears to most seasoned riders as a Mozart symphony is to a cellist. Furthermore, the power unleashed above 5,000 rpm is something that could take even experienced riders off guard and send bikes and riders sailing over any barrier ahead. The H1 was Kawasaki's first blisteringly fast bikes and helped establish the brand as a purveyor of power.\nKawasaki Z1\nWhile Kawasaki led the performance field with its two-stroke Mach III in 1969, it kept up the pace with a 750 triple in 1972. But in development at the same time and also released in 1972 was a more mature and sophisticated model that set the motorcycle market on fire when it arrived, the 900cc four-stroke four-cylinder Kawasaki Z1, now a legend.\nHonda released its CB750 in 1968, ushering in a new era of four-cylinder bikes from Japan dominating the field. While Kawasaki had a 750 inline-4 in the works, the CB750 caused a rethink and Kawasaki engineers went back to the drawing table, emerging with Z1 in 1972, taking the crown from Honda for having the fastest bike on the market. With the Kawasaki Z1, an important piece of Japanese motorcycle history had been established.\nThe Z1 was a crowning achievement of engineering and style for its day. Its engine overcame the competition with a 167cc displacement advantage and twice the overhead camshafts \u2014 Honda's first dual-cam engine came in 1979. Furthermore, it was a beautiful bike benefitting from symmetrical chrome exhaust pipes flowing down and back into dual split horns on either side, and the gently sloping gas tank leading to the turned up fender on the tail added some mildly seductive curves. It was otherwise a typical UJM that epitomized bikes of the day from Japan and also came with an incredible power-to-weight ratio that made it faster than anything around.\nKawasaki Ninja\nTo rank any one model of Ninja from its introduction in 1984 until today as the most attractive or eye-catching makes for a difficult task. Therefore, all of them will be included. After Kawasaki found success with its GPZ models, the company chose to focus on one in particular to add some clever bodywork and even more clever engineering to create Kawasaki's first superbike.\nKawasaki GPz900R designated this first superbike, and it represented a shift in the direction of high-performance motorcycle design from the company. Ninja introduced the first ever 16-valve twin-cam water-cooled inline-4 on a motorcycle, and its impact was felt across the industry. Since its debut, Kawasaki Ninja has been among the most recognizable and famous motorcycles ever made. Moreover, it spawned a long list of successors with increasingly more power and better handling, including the current model.\nAll Ninja motorcycles are striking in their appearance. Some of the highlights over the years include the 1989 ZX-7, 2006 ZX-14, and the current master Ninja H2 R, powered by a supercharged 1,000cc inline-4 delivering an astonishing 326 horsepower at a cost of $58,100. With seating only for one, a single swingarm, and a pair of giant front discs to slow it down, it looks like something either from the future or a far-off world. No matter which Ninja you choose, you will have a ride guaranteed to turn some heads.\nKawasaki Vulcan\nWhile Kawasaki first dipped its toes into cruiser waters with its LTD motorcycles in the '70s and '80s, it went whole hog with the concept when it introduced the Vulcan line in 1985. Although it followed in the American v-twin styling tradition, it departed from that tradition with its relatively small 700cc v-twin with advanced features such as dual overhead cams and water cooling. Nevertheless, the Vulcan line pressed on and grew up along the way.\nThe Vulcan grew up to the point that Kawasaki offered a 2.0-liter v-twin model starting in 2004. While its engine has slimmed down a bit to 1.7 liters, the current Kawasaki Vulcan Vaquero is a stunning mass of mechanics and style. Taking its cues from the American bagger tradition, the Vaquero definitely looks more like something from Milwaukee than Tokyo. That's just fine because it doesn't need to fit in Tokyo, as this machine is built for the wide-open highways of North America.\nKawasaki is a capable company building highly technical motorcycles as it has done for years, but its Vulcan is less refined and even a bit long in the tooth, having been on the market since 2018. However, it doesn't matter because this bike is made for getting out on the road in style, and it's plenty capable of that. It comes with everything you need, including tunes with Bluetooth connection, and nothing you don't. It's a fabulous looking big machine, and it doesn't need to be anything else.\nKawasaki Z900RS\nKawasaki is proud of its heritage in building some of the most influential and powerful bikes through the years, and its past success shows just cause for that. Additionally, the styling of some of its past models never seems to go out of fashion, with certain elements continuing to pop up in new models all the time. In taking that notion to its full conclusion, Kawasaki released in 2018 the Z900RS as an homage to its trailblazing 900cc Z1 from 1972.\nWhile the Z900RS is a thoroughly modern machine, it is built with the UJM styling at the fore and eliminates much of the extra body cladding that tends to overcome many modern motorcycles. This leaves this bike sitting naked with not much more than its headlight, engine, seat, and wheels to get excited about, and yet, that's plenty to be excited about.\nTo be clear, the Z900RS is no clone of the Z1. It has a radiator up front for the water-cooled and fuel-injected engine, and the exhaust pipes all into one muffler rather than the quad horns of the original. Yet, it retains the essence of the original bike and Kawasaki produces it with some of the original color schemes, blending perfectly the old and the new. For those who pine for the earlier days of motorcycling but prefer the convenience and reliability of the current day, this Kawasaki is the perfect choice and a fine looking one to boot."

      "text": "How Fast Can The Honda Monkey Go & Is The Mini-Bike Street Legal In The US?\nThe Honda Monkey looks like something out of the past, but it's actually a modern mini bike first introduced for the 2019 model year. The design is \"retro-inspired,\" with an appearance reminiscent of the strange Yamaha motorcycles that cropped up in the 70s and 80s, like the Chappy and the Zippy. But unlike the vintage 50cc retro bikes its style was based on, the Monkey has a faster engine with a modern build.\nThe Honda Monkey is street legal in the U.S., so it's ready for the highway. However, Honda hasn't revealed how fast the 2025 Monkey can go, nor has it done so for earlier models. Thus, we'll have to rely on independent testers and customer reviews.\nMotorcycles with 125cc engines similar to the Monkey's can typically reach cruise speeds of about 50 to 60 mph and top speeds nearing 70 mph. That's about the same for the Monkey. Most independent reviewers place the Monkey's cruising speed in the 50 to 60 mph range and its top speed in the mid-60s. For example, YouTuber GromBeardo maxed out at 57 mph while Gas Works ISO achieved a speed of 66 mph on a 2019 model. Other owners on the web report hitting over 60 mph, but their top speeds typically plateau before 65 mph. After that, air resistance becomes a significant hurdle.\nThe Honda Monkey ticks all the legal boxes\nBecause of the Honda Monkey's small size and low top speed, you might be wondering: Is that little thing really street-legal in the United States? Perhaps surprisingly, the answer is yes.\nAlthough its cruising speed will likely confine you to the slow lane on the highway, you can legally ride the Honda Monkey on U.S. roadways. Of course, you'll still have to follow road laws, which can vary from state to state, such as helmet requirements and lane splitting. However, the Honda Monkey fulfills all the structural criteria for it to be deemed street-legal in all U.S. states, including standards for the headlights, brake lights, mirrors, and tires. It even has a fun-sized catalytic converter to help it meet exhaust system requirements.\nThus, although it might look like a toy, the Monkey is completely ready for the road, making it one of the smallest street-legal motorcycles you can buy. It can even handle dirt roads thanks to its standard anti-lock braking system and chunky tires. Plenty of mods and aftermarket parts are available, as well, which can boost its speed and terrain possibilities. However, don't forget that the Honda Monkey is still a mini-bike with a top speed of around 60 mph, so don't expect to win any races against street bikes with it."

      "text": "10 Motorcycles With The Lowest Maintenance Costs\nMotorcycles fill an interesting niche in the realm of American transportation. They are considered \"toys\" to some, but to others, a bike can be their primary mode of transport, or a secondary vehicle they use exclusively for their commute to save on gas. Either way, the last thing anyone wants is to deal with mechanical issues when they just want to go for a ride.\nReliability is one of the biggest issues with motorcycles, but there's not a lot of info out there on which bikes require the least amount of maintenance. While all of them need regular maintenance like oil changes, some brands and bikes are notorious for spending as much time in the shop as they do on the road. SlashGear published a survey on reliability early in 2023 with some surprising results, and another common reference point for brand reliability is a 2015 survey done by Consumer Reports. Combining those reference points and doing some research into the brands mentioned, results in this list of some of the most reliable, low-maintenance bikes available.\nRoyal Enfield\nRoyal Enfield is an anomaly, as its new bikes share the classic styling of its hundred-plus-year history while improving on the issues that those same cycles were plagued with. As a company, it's been manufacturing motorcycles since 1901, although its current incarnation as an India-based manufacturer began in 1949. The best-known model it produced, the Bullet, was around from 1932 until 2020, and due to very little competition in its native India, it hadn't really changed a lot from a design perspective. When production on the Bullet 500 ended, many called it the end of an era, although the venerable machine had its share of issues.\nThe death of the Bullet was short-lived, however, as the Royal Enfield Classic 350 retains a lot of the style of the Bullet C5 Classic while improving on its shortcomings. It's no powerhouse or speed demon, and it's not meant to be. A 349cc, two-valve, fuel-injected single with a five-speed gearbox is the heart of this stylish ride. The sub-$5,000 price tag is reasonable for a nice-looking motorcycle that tops out at around 75 mph but is more comfortable around 55-60. It's great for city riding, which makes sense when you see footage of classic Bullets zipping around people, cars, and livestock in its home country.\nGood, nimble handling and middle-of-the-road brakes and ride quality (and a three-year, unlimited mileage warranty when purchased new) make the Classic 350 a reliable, low-cost, low-maintenance addition to Royal Enfield's lineage.\nIndian (and Polaris, R.I.P.)\nThe first American motorcycle company, Indian was relaunched by new owners Polaris Industries in 2011 after a 50-year hiatus in production and several attempts by others to use Indian branding and imported bikes. The current iteration of the company has a good lineup of popular motorcycles, including the Chieftain, Challenger, and Roadmaster. Like many of the manufacturers on our list, it has also started producing a pair of electric bikes, which might end up replacing our current low-maintenance pick for the brand.\nIndian promotes do-it-yourself maintenance on its website, providing plenty of helpful articles and videos for those comfortable with a wrench. The company's Scout Bobber Sixty, one of the most popular names in their resurrected lineup, only calls for an oil change every 10,000 miles. Obviously, regular inspections are key to keeping any vehicle on the road, and periodic maintenance is always recommended \u2014 even if only to have an experienced technician inspect the bike \u2014 but if properly cared for, the Scout Bobber Sixty can likely last as long as its owner.\nVictory Motorcycles, also owned by Polaris, was shuttered in 2017 after only 18 years of production as an alternative to Harley-Davidson. However, the company's bikes are still going strong, and the Cross Country is one of the most low-maintenance and reliable baggers out there. Victory ranked fifth in the Consumer Reports survey, and the CC Tour Deluxe, in particular, is fondly remembered by Victory owners as a bulletproof bike.\nBMW\nIt's hard to believe anything with the BMW badge can be described as \"low-maintenance.\" The company's cars are pricey, luxurious vehicles produced with the finest German engineering. However, BMW's motorcycles don't quite have that same pedigree. Sure, they're good looking bikes, but they ranked next-to-last in that Consumer Reports survey, and didn't even make SlashGear's list. Still, many owners swear by the reliability of their personal bikes despite a reported 40% of surveyed owners from 2008-2014 experiencing a \"major failure,\" and brand loyalty can blind some riders to the real costs of their hobby.\nHowever, there is one standout in the BMW Motorrad lineup: the R nine T Pure. It's a great looking cruiser that combines a classic design with BMW flair, and maintaining it is said to be more affordable than most BMW motorcycles. It's a barebones bike \u2014 even a tachometer and gear position sensor aren't included \u2014 but the air-cooled boxer engine is beloved by many of BMW's fans.\nThe G310 GS is another BMW motorcycle known as a gateway for new riders, and the relatively low price and easy-to-maintain single-cylinder engine make it a great first adventure bike.\nDucati\nWhile we're on the subject of European bikes, Italian manufacturer Ducati often gets a bad rap as a maker of unreliable motorcycles. It ranked pretty low on that Consumer Reports survey we've been referring to with a 33% failure rate, although Ducati did tie for a distant second place on SlashGear's own survey. There are some issues with plastic fuel tank swelling and common clutch issues across all models. Overall, Ducati just seems more interested in making high-powered, fast bikes than ones with an eye toward reliability and low maintenance, as evidenced in the success of its many racing bikes.\nEven with that fast-first mindset, the Ducati Monster and its L-twin engine is considered the most dependable bike that Ducati has manufactured, and in the years since the Monster's debut in 1993, the air-cooled engine design has only improved. However, while overall the motorcycle is relatively low maintenance, the desmodromic valves on the Monster require adjustment every 7,500 miles, a service that can be pricey at the dealer and difficult to perform at home.\nTriumph\nLike Royal Enfield and Indian, Triumph is a badge with a long history, although its current iteration was founded in 1983. The British-based manufacturer has technically been around since the early 1900s and was resurrected from bankruptcy as Triumph Motorcycles Ltd. When the company was reborn, it made a point to slowly reintroduce and redesign several of the company's iconic names for a new generation of riders. In doing so, Triumph addressed many of the issues that plagued its bikes \u2014 making the new versions some of the most reliable and easy to maintain in the brand's history.\nThe first Triumph motorcycle many think of is the Bonneville. The classic British bike was featured in the film \"The Great Escape,\" and when it was finally reintroduced in 2000, its recognizable style and fantastic styling won many Triumph enthusiasts over. It's also one of the more reliable motorcycles out there, as the parallel twin in the Bonneville T120 isn't terribly stressed by over-exertion. Service intervals are every 10,000 miles or annually, and the bikes feature several modern comforts like LCD displays, an under-seat USB charging socket, and LED lights. The Street Twin 900, a bike that shares a lot of the same components as the Bonnie, is another highly recommended Triumph when it comes to reliability and minimal maintenance, although Triumph renamed it the Speed Twin 900 in 2022.\nKawasaki\nJapanese bikes have a reputation for being reliable and low-maintenance, and Kawasaki is no exception. With a low 15% failure rate on Consumer Reports' survey, and fourth place on SlashGear's reliability survey, Kawasaki lands solidly in the middle of our list. Kawasaki's diverse lineup features aggressive, sharp angles and a long history of speedy, high-performance bikes starting with 1984's beloved GPz900R, the first of the Ninja line. But the brand has plenty of diversity as well \u2014 its Vulcan line of cruisers, naked Zs, and dual-sport KLXs offer something for every rider.\nKawasaki has plenty of bikes that can be counted on for reliability and minimal upkeep. Fans mention the Concours 14 and the Ninja 650 when they discuss Kawasaki motorcycles that are considered \"bulletproof.\" The Concours 14 is a stylish sport-touring motorcycle, while the Ninja 650 is probably Kawasaki's best-known bike. Both feature maintenance schedules around 7,500 miles after the first year, and when properly maintained owners boast lifelong relationships with their older Kawasakis.\nNinjas, especially, are touted as being great for beginners looking to learn how to maintain their bikes as well as ride, as their relatively simple design allows for easier DIY services like chain maintenance and oil changes. Keeping up with those regular, annual chores can keep a Ninja running for years to come.\nSuzuki\nSuzuki is a Japanese manufacturer that's more well-known for its motorcycles than cars, Sidekick notwithstanding. The company began life as a weaving loom manufacturer in 1909, transitioning to motorcycles in the 1950s. By 1953, Suzuki was producing 6,000 bikes a month, and today Suzuki produces cars, ATVs, and even outboard motors for boats.\nHigh-performance rockets with cool names like the Hayabusa and Katana are Suzuki's top-of-the-line speedsters, and the brand takes a lot of pride in its racing division, but the company also makes a number of cruisers, dirtbikes, and adventure motorcycles. Those are generally considered reliable, affordable, and easy to maintain, with the discontinued Boulevard S40 cruiser and SV650 topping the list of low-maintenance, high-reliability options.\nThe SV650 is a smaller, naked bike that's recommended for beginners while still maintaining its appeal for experienced riders. The 2003-2009 models, after the carburetors were removed but before the Gladius generation of SV650s, are some of the more sought-after Suzikis because of their hardiness and general ease of operation. However, even more recent models like the 2023 pictured above have great reviews and, at under $8,000, won't break the bank on initial purchase or maintenance.\nHarley-Davidson\nThe brand most Americans think of when they think of a motorcycle is Harley-Davidson. SlashGear's reliability survey put Harleys at a whopping 49.59% \u2014 more than double the two brands tied for second \u2014 despite landing at sixth place in Consumer Reports' survey with a 26% failure rate.\nWhile other riders may tend to look down on Harley-Davidson enthusiasts for getting the \"popular\" bike, there are plenty of reasons to pick a Harley apart from brand recognition. The company's touring bikes are second to none, and the added weight can be an advantage on longer road trips. Parts are available en masse \u2014 the physical catalog from aftermarket parts specialists J&P Cycle is literally twice the size of the book for every other manufacturer combined. Dealerships are everywhere as well as independent shops, so if one gets into trouble on that cross-country excursion, there's more than likely a nearby mechanic willing to help get riders back on the road. The company will even literally rebuild your engine for you if you're willing to ship it to Milwaukee!\nThe Harley-Davidson Sportster is known for being one of the most reliable hogs, and the fact that the 883s have the belt-driven Evo motor just means one less thing to worry about. They're also considered some of the easiest Harleys to work on, and if one is looking to save some money there are almost always several to choose from in the aftermarket. One piece of advice: find one that's as close to stock as possible, as one never knows the experience level of previous owners.\nHonda\nRenowned Japanese automaker Honda got its start with small engines that were attached to bicycles, and since 1948, the company hasn't stopped, having produced over 300 million bikes by the end of 2014. It is widely considered one of the most reliable brands; however, our readers may note that despite a very high Consumer Reports ranking of second place in reliability (tied with Suzuki), the brand doesn't even appear on the list of responses to SlashGear's survey. This may be a combination of brand loyalty or simply an audience that isn't buying what Honda's selling \u2014 a common complaint about Honda is that the offerings aren't as stylish or visually pleasing as the bikes that its competitors produce.\nRegardless, Honda's range of motorcycles is constantly mentioned as one of the most dependable in the world. The Honda Rebel 250, pictured above, is dependable and easy to maintain despite a suggested service schedule of 4,000 miles per oil change; the Rebel is actually considered so beginner-friendly that many training programs feature them. The RC51 is a Ducati competitor with 136 horsepower in a twin-cylinder motor that's reliable, powerful, and a great heart for a superbike. And the mighty Gold Wing is considered not only one of the most reliable Hondas, but one of the best touring motorcycles on the road.\n[Featured image by Tokumeigakarinoaoshima via Wikimedia Commons | Cropped and scaled | CC BY-SA 4.0]\nYamaha\nAt the top of Consumer Reports' brand reliability survey was Yamaha, leading four Japanese motorcycle companies in riders' trust. Yamaha also landed third on SlashGears' survey, and combined, that's good enough to land them the last spot on our list. Yamaha's reliability and durability are unmatched, and its wide range of bikes that enthusiasts rave about is notable. From older rides like the nimble V-Star 250 to the bobber style Bolt and the beloved FZ1, there's a Yamaha out there for nearly every taste, and even used models are thought to be some of the most reliable \u2014 assuming the former owners kept up with regular maintenance.\nThe Yamaha FZ6, produced from 2004-2009, is considered Yamaha's standard-bearer as a reliable, \"bulletproof\" street bike for both beginners and enthusiasts. The detuned R6 engine in the Yamaha FZ6 is incredibly reliable with a solid engine that rarely fails, and the bikes are still easy to find if one is willing to look. Another solid bike, the V-Star 650, is larger than the FZ6 but still easy to keep on the road forever when properly maintained.\n[Featured image by Trougnouf via Wikimedia Commons | Cropped and scaled | CCA 4.0]"

It\u2019s a set of smart tech that steps in during tricky situations, helping the bike handle traction while you\u2019re accelerating, braking, or slowing down. With the Cornering Rider Safety Enhancements, the bike even adjusts for cornering, keeping things smooth and steady without you having to think twice.\nABS is designed to prevent the wheels from locking under braking and helps the rider maintain control when braking in a straight-line, urgent situation.\nThis feature electronically applies braking effort to both wheels when the rider applies the front brake lever and, on some models when the rider applies the rear brake pedal. ELB can help many riders achieve better braking performance. It boosts braking power when needed while minimizing or stopping the linking for lighter braking or at lower speeds.\nThe TCS is designed to keep the rear wheel from \u201cspinning out\u201d when the motorcycle is accelerating in a straight line and enhances rider confidence.\nDSCS is designed to reduce excessive rear-wheel slip and help prevent rear-wheel lock under powertrain-induced deceleration, which typically occurs when the rider makes an abrupt downshift gear change or quickly reduces the throttle while on wet or slippery road surfaces.\nWith Vehicle Hold Control (VHC), your bike\u2019s not rolling anywhere until you\u2019re ready to go.

      "text": "Every Major Sport Touring Motorcycle On The Market Today\nSupersport motorcycles like the Kawasaki Ninja or Yamaha R-Series offer a thrilling experience and incredible performance at the expense of comfort. These bikes might be the fastest around a track, but they make little concession to anything other than being blisteringly fast, sleek, and aerodynamic handling machines.\nLightweight seats with minimal padding, aggressive riding posture, a lack of luggage, and almost no recognition that a passenger might be onboard contribute to making supersport bikes super fun to ride but downright painful for extended journeys.\nFortunately, the market recognizes the need for thrilling capability in a package that won't numb your hands and twist your muscles into a pretzel. Sport-touring motorcycles represent the best of both worlds: pulse-pounding performance along with comfort and features that make extended riding not only tolerable but downright luxurious.\nSport-touring motorcycles come in different shapes and sizes. Some are geared toward adventure riding with high-ground clearances, while others are bonafide knee draggers that do everything possible to put the \"sport\" in sport-touring while remaining comfortable to ride.\nJoin us as we review the state of the sport-tourer, checking out the features, improvements, and additions to the latest from today's major manufacturers.\nHonda NT1100\nDespite an extensive line of just about everything, Honda's only nod to the sport-touring world for 2025 is the NT1100, and it's not available in the United States. Introduced in 2022, the NT1100 is based on Honda's popular Africa Twin adventure bike. The formula has struck a chord; in 2023, the NT 1100 was Europe's best-selling sport-tourer.\nA 1,084cc parallel-twin engine delivers 100 hp and 82 lb-ft of torque in a package that weighs about 550 pounds. The 17-inch wheels encourage riders to keep the bike on the asphalt, and a 6.5 TFT multi-information display provides access to Apple Play and Android Audio.\nHonda has added a six-axis inertial measuring unit (IMU) to the 2025 model. The unit tracks the bike's lean angle and feeds data to the traction control and ABS systems, giving the NT1100 sophistication lacking in previous models. Honda also added a Showa Electronically Equipped Ride Adjustment system, allowing riders to set the bike up as aggressively or forgivingly as they desire.\nThe riding position is upright, protected from the wind by a windscreen that kicks the worst up and over the rider's head. The seating offers 20% more space for the rider, while the luggage includes 73 liters of storage \u2014 up eight liters from last year's model. Urban trim buyers also get an additional 50-liter color-matched top case that doubles as a passenger backrest.\nThe NT1100 is a competent little bike, but if you really want it, you'll have to move to Europe.\nYamaha FJR1300 ES\nThe FJR 1300ES has been Yamaha's flagship sport-tourer since its debut in 2001 and has nearly a quarter-century of pedigree to rely upon. Equipped with a smooth and powerful 1,298cc double-overhead (DOHC) 16-valve liquid-cooled inline 4-cylinder, it leans toward the sport end of the sport-touring spectrum. No surprise, coming from the builder of some of the fastest Yamaha motorcycles ever made.\nIt's been a while since the FJR's last major overhaul in 2016, and it is yet to be seen if Yamaha will issue a 2025 model. For now, it remains one of the biggest bore and displacement sport-tourers. The bike makes 142 hp and 102 lb-ft of torque delivered through a smooth shaft drive via a snappy six-speed transmission with a tall sixth gear that cruises at 75 mph at 3,500 rpm.\nThough nearly a decade has passed since its last generational renewal, the Yamaha retains a modest list of amenities, including traction control, selectable throttle modes, and an electronically adjustable suspension to help riders get as low as they want in the twisties.\nAdjustable seating and handlebars allow riders up to 5 inches of movement. Thoughtful touches like heated grips, cruise and traction control systems, and integrated quick-release hard luggage aren't groundbreaking, but Yamaha has taken an if-it-ain't-broke-don't-fix-it approach.\nThe FJR 1300ES isn't cutting-edge, but it is plenty of understated fun. Its ultra-competent sports-touring package offers a balance of performance and enjoyment, making it a good pick for the supersport rider looking to graduate to sport-touring.\nYamaha Tracer 9GT+\nThe Tracer 9GT+ takes a significantly different approach from the FJR. In the Yammie lineup since 2018, the Tracer began as a 700cc parallel twin, similar to the R7, but received a quick promotion to the 890cc triple-cylinder CP3 Yamaha uses in the XSR900.\nAt first glance, the Tracer doesn't scream speed, but the truth is that the CP3 makes ample power. It has 117 hp at 10,000 rpm and 68.6 lb-ft of torque at 7,000 rpm, pushing a wet weight of 492 pounds. A KYB semi-active suspension marries comfort with performance, aided by an array of adjustable features and amenities.\nThe Tracer shares several gizmos with the FJR, including traction control with Sport, Street, Rain, Custom settings, and the six-axis IMU, but it also goes further. With a radar system the FJR lacks, the Tracer gets adaptive cruise control and a unique system that senses the proximity of nearby vehicles and adjusts braking bias for controlled stops.\nRiders can adjust the handlebars up to 10mm, and the footpegs can move 14mm up and 4mm to the rear of standard settings. The Tracer's 10-level adjustable windscreen and heated handgrips keep riders out of the worst of the wind and cold, making it one of the best Yamaha motorcycles for long rides.\nThe Tracer is a different experience than the FJR. Still, it showcases Yamaha's willingness to welcome other types of riders to its sport-touring segment, even if Kawasaki has an even wider array of choices.\nKawasaki Ninja Series\nThere is a lot to unpack here. Ninja used to be a byword for pure supersport performance. However, in recent years, Kawasaki has liberalized the Ninja line to include everything from baby supersports to battery-powered e-bikes to sport-touring hyperbikes. Lately, Kawasaki has taken a throw-everything-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks approach to its sport-touring line, all to the consumer's benefit.\nThis year, a new Kawasaki motorcycle announced for 2025, the Ninja 1100 SX, serves as an upgrade from the 2024 Ninja 1000 SX. Despite the increase in displacement from 1,043 ccs to 1,099 ccs, the horsepower has surprisingly decreased from 140 hp to 134 hp. However, the longer stroke of the 1100 model results in better mid-range power and torque delivery, enhancing the bike's performance on the open road.\nKawasaki offers the 1100 in two variants \u2014 the standard SX and the SX SE. The primary difference is the additional $1,700 cost for the SX SE model, which adds Brembo front brakes and an \u00d6hlins S46 gas-charged rear shock, enhancing the bike's overall performance for aggressive riders.\nThe Ninja SX models do not come with luggage, though some can be accessed through Kawasaki's accessories market. The Ninja 1100 takes big lessons from the nameplate's supersport legacy, evident in the sharp lines and aggressive posture of the 2025 model.\nKawasaki Ninja H2 SX & SE\nKawasaki developed the H2 from the ground up as the latest battle to determine who makes the fastest production motorcycle on the street. The H2 achieved its goal in Kawasaki's Ninja H2R, which is not street-legal in the U.S. It's a model that set new standards in speed and performance before Kawasaki promptly applied its new platform to sport touring editions.\nThe 998cc liquid-cooled in-line DOHC 4-cylinder sounds par for the course, but all that changes when you get to the heart of the matter: a supercharger custom-designed by Kawasaki Heavy Industries. The supercharger makes the H2 a tad heavier than typical supersports. The SX and SE weigh about 589 pounds and produce 195 hp against the H2R's 476 pounds and 305 hp.\nThe SE and SX are equipped with a slew of cutting-edge rider aids. Performance is enhanced by an IMU, launch control, engine brake control, cornering management, and an electronically controlled suspension.\nNods to their roles as tourers include a windshield with a less dramatic rake, improved ergonomics, and full fairings covering the trellis frame exposed on the H2R. Other features include collision warnings, adaptive cruise control, and a SPIN infotainment app.\nLike the Ninja 1100 SX and SE, the H2 SE and SX are far more oriented toward being sportbikes than tourers. You can dress a hyperbike up with aftermarket luggage and a detuned engine, but it remains a hyperbike.\nKawasaki Versys\nThe Versys has been in Kawasaki's lineup since 2006 when it debuted the Versys 650 as a middleweight oddball blending elements of adventure, sport, and dual-sport riding. Since then, Kawasaki has refined and defined the Versys to arrive at three adventure-oriented sport-tourers: the X-300, Versys 650, and Versys 1100 SE LT.\nThe X-300 and 650 use parallel-twin engines, while the full-sized Versys 1100 SE LT gets the in-line four-cylinder treatment and all the touring rider aids found in the Ninja 1100 and H2 SX and SE. The Kawasaki Versys 1100 is new for 2025, bumped up from the 1000cc displacement of the previous year.\nThe Versys 1100 SE LT ABS is an upright, adventure-style bike for cruising highways and byways. It makes 133 hp at 9,000 rpm and 82.5 lb-ft of torque at 7,600 rpm. Multiple power modes, traction control, cruise control, anti-lock brakes, and quick-shifter technology help riders put that power to the ground any way they please.\nThe Versys 1100 includes a pair of 28-liter saddlebags as standard equipment \u2013 a nice change from the bagless Ninja 1100. While Kawasaki's other sport-touring bikes are aggressive performance machines, the Versys takes a more relaxing approach. Direct competitors with Honda's NT 1100 and Yamaha's Tracer 9, Kawasaki seeks to convince riders that it is the premier adventure sport touring motorcycle available.\nSuzuki GSX-S1000GT & GSX-S1000GX\nSuzuki is the final member of the big four Japanese manufacturers on the list, chiming in with its GSX-S1000GT and GSX-S1000GX sport touring bikes.\nWhile all of the big four manufacturers offer powerful sport-tourers, Suzuki stands out with its liter-class GSX-S1000GX, a sport-oriented touring bike similar to Kawasaki's Ninja 1100 SX. Fully faired and powerful, the S1000GT delivers 150 hp and 80 lb-ft of torque at 9,500 rpm. It also includes the proprietary Suzuki Advance Electronic Suspension, drive mode selection, traction control, and a fully adjustable KYB fork.\nThe GSX-S1000GX is a recent addition to the Suzuki lineup. It showed up in 2024 as an adventure-style sport-touring bike that Suzuki classifies as a crossover. With a suspension stroke 30 mm higher in the front and 20 mm in the rear, it's not meant to hug the pavement like the S1000GT. It doesn't qualify as a dual-sport, but the GX is better equipped to handle poorly maintained roads that may be a tad off the beaten path.\nSuzuki has adopted a strategy of covering two major sport-touring niches (sport and adventure) based on the same architecture. Sharing an engine and several ride-control features, they nonetheless differ in mission. Which one you prefer is a matter of how you like to ride.\nBMW R1250 RT\nThough Japanese bikes make up a considerable part of the market, there are plenty of offerings from other parts of the world, not the least of which is the BMW R 1250 RT. BMW foregoes classifying its bikes as sport-touring hybrids, preferring to separate sport from touring altogether. Nonetheless, the 2024 R1250 RT has a foot in both worlds.\nBMW is a premium brand, and that is reflected in the R 1250 RT's features and price tag. The base MSRP starts at $19,995, and fully loaded models can reach up to the $30,000 range. Either way, riders enjoy a 1,254 cc two-cylinder boxer engine attached to a six-speed transmission with a wet clutch. The upshot is 136 hp and 105 lb-ft of torque in a motorcycle with a low center of gravity and smooth power delivery. It's no lightweight at 615 pounds, but that may be why BMW prefers to keep it classified in its touring lineup.\nAdventure-style sport-touring motorcycles may be unsuitable for shorter riders due to their seat height. BMW separates itself from the adventure crew with a relatively low seat height of 31.7 inches. Hard side cases and Road, Rain, and Eco driving mode selections come standard. The usual suspects of propriety traction management systems are present, but the Beemer stands out with a massive 10.25-inch TFT display.\nThe R 1250 RT costs a pretty penny. Some of that is undoubtedly a brand name tax, but BMW's best offers impressive finish and sophistication.\nKTM 1290 Super Duke GT\nRespected bike builder KTM has entered the sport-touring game with a bike that, like the H2, heavily skews toward sport riding. The KTM 1290 Super Duke GT is an absolute rocket. An LC8 V-twin genuinely nastifies this wicked bike, making 175 hp and 104 lb-ft of torque. With a 460-pound wet weight, we're talking superbike-level power.\nThe Super Duke employs an unconventional design style, including stalk-like rearview mirrors and a razor-sharp quarter fairing that exposes the trellis frame. The result is somewhat alien, though it clearly communicates aggressive capability, even if it splits opinions on whether it is beautiful or ugly.\nOne of the notable things about KTM motorcycles is their focus on maintaining a relaxed riding experience with an upright seating position and an easy-to-read 7-inch TFT display that relays navigational and performance information at a glance. Adaptive cruise control, heated grips, adjustable windscreen, and a collection of rider aids are KTM's justification for classing this beast as a sport-tourer. However, luggage only comes as an add-on.\nThe 1290 Super Duke GT treats touring as an afterthought, but it could be the right bike for someone who wants a performance machine during the week while retaining the ability to slap some bags on for a weekend trip.\nMV Augusta Turismo Veloce\nWith such a beautiful country, it should be no surprise that Italian MV Augusta got into the sport-touring game with the Turismo Veloce. With distinctive styling with an exotic Italian flair, the Turismo Veloce may be the most radical-looking bike on this list.\nMV Augusta sticks close to its roots in developing avant-garde motorcycle designs wrapped around powerful and interesting engines. The Turismo comes in three variations, all powered by a 4-stroke, 12-valve triple cylinder making 110 hp out of 798 cubic centimeters. Weighing 438 pounds, it is positively a featherweight machine.\nThe bottom of the line starts with the R, which MV Augusta classifies as \"an easy tourer.\" Next up, the Lusso SCS purports to combine travel with style, while the top dog RC SCS claims to be the raciest of the three.\nLike the KTM Super Duke GT, the Turismo Veloce focuses primarily on performance. MV Augusta purists and fans who won't ride anything else can be happy that the Italian bike builder has put something on the market to accommodate luggage for weekend adventuring.\nDucati Multistrada V4S Grand Tour\nMV Augusta isn't the only fashionable Italian motorcycle producer to get in the sport-touring game. Ducati, known for motorcycles that are as beautiful to look at as they are to ride, puts forth the Multistrada V4S Grand Tour for your sport-touring consideration.\nThe Multistrada has been a part of Ducati's lineup since its unveiling for the 2002 model year. Two decades later, Ducati continues to develop the nameplate. Ducati offers the Multistrada in five variations, with the V4 Rally most closely resembling a sport-touring motorcycle.\nVisually, the V4 Rally appears split between road prowess and off-road capability. Ducati insists it is as capable at long-range road riding as it is off the beaten path. As the name suggests, the Multistrada gets its 170 hp and 89 lb-feet of torque from a 90-degree V4 engine.\nThe V4 Rally comes in three trims: Radar, Adventure Travel & Radar, and Full Adventure. The Radar package provides bike buyers with radar technology to assist with its adaptive cruise control. Adventure Travel secures the radar package plus heated handgrips and hard luggage, and the Full Adventure is the whole package plus an Akrapovi\u010d silencer and carbon mudguard.\nWith its purported hybrid capability, this is a tall bike. The seat height is adjustable between 33.1 and 33.9 inches. Short riders might struggle to wrestle the 505-pound wet weight over uneven terrain.\nThe Multistrada is clearly a capable sport-touring bike with an adventuring twist."

      "text": "Just How Dangerous Are Motorcycles? Here's What The Data Says\nMotorcycle rides are undeniably exciting. The world's best-sounding motorcycles aren't the only ones that allow you to feel the wind and experience the scenery in a way that cars just can't match. But as thrilling as it is, motorcycle travel comes with real risk that often goes unnoticed until it's too late. The statistics on motorcycle injuries and deaths from crashes are alarming when you take a closer look, and might make you think twice before hopping on a bike.\nThe last full year for which National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) data is available is 2023, when 6,335 motorcyclists died in crashes. That was the highest number recorded since 1975 and a clear sign that things are moving in the wrong direction. More surprisingly, while motorcycles represent only 3.4% of all vehicles, motorcyclists accounted for 15% of traffic-related deaths. That's a huge discrepancy, and it shows how exposed riders really are compared to people inside cars, trucks, and SUVs. The further you dig into motorcycle crash data, the harder it becomes to ignore the danger.\nA closer look at the numbers\nThe safety gap between cars and motorcycles is enormous. Motorcyclists are over 20 times more likely to die in a crash per mile traveled than car occupants. and five times more likely to be injured. In addition, about four of every five motorcycle crashes result in injury or death. Another concern is that these numbers have remained somewhat consistent or increased year after year.\nThe reports reveal that many fatal crashes happen in certain common traffic situations. For instance, head-on collisions account for 77% of fatal bike-car crashes, while only 6% involve a car rear-ending a motorcycle. Also common are left-turn accidents, where a car turns across a lane while the motorcycle goes straight or tries to pass. This type of collision is all too familiar to experienced motorcycle riders, many of whom have learned to be extra vigiliant when passing a line of stopped traffic. Distracted and impaired driving are also a big cause of accidents.\nRiders' choices can make a big difference in safety\nYou risk of being injured or killed on a motorcycle goes up sharply if you're intoxicated. In 2022, 29% of the motorcyclists killed In crashes had a blood alcohol level higher than .08%, and that rose to 42% for single-vehicle motorcycle accidents. In these instances, blame lies solely and squarely with the rider. Michigan attorney Steven Gursten has argued motorcycle accident and injury cases for over 20 years, and explained on his blog how all motorists are responsible for keeping motorcycle riders safe. \"I see the majority of these cases being caused by drivers who never see the motorbike operator \u2014 even when the motorcyclist is plainly there to be seen,\" he wrote. \"Often people don't 'process' the motorbike operator that's visible and in plain sight because the brain isn't expecting to see it. And so drivers hit the motorbike operator.\"\nThere are ways for motorcycle riders to reduce their risk, though. Consistently wearing a DOT-approved helmet is the first safety measure all bikers can and should take, and cuts the chance of fatal injury by more than a third. Fortunately, helmet use has jumped from less than half of riders in 2005 to almost 75% in 2023, according to the National Safety Council. In 2017 alone, helmets saved 1,872 lives, and the NHTSA estimates that 749 more people would have survived if all riders wore helmets. That said, even with helmets and protective riding gear, motorcyclists are still vulnerable with no seatbelts or protective metal shell around them. Sometimes all it takes is one big pothole, some loose grass clippings, or a poorly timed lane change to reveal the dangers of riding a motorcycle."

The 270-degree crankshaft configuration provides similar power delivery characteristics as the 90-degree V-twins used in other V-STROM models, while producing a unique and exciting exhaust note.\nThe spaced nature of the engine\u2019s power pulses enhances traction and contributes to strong power output at extremely low speeds, making the V-STROM 800DE easier to ride on forest roads and trails.\nSuzuki Cross Balancer technology, patented by Suzuki and was used for the first time on a production motorcycle in the V-STROM 800DE, helps create a compact, lightweight design that delivers smooth operation.\nDual, linked 42mm electronic throttle bodies provide an authentic response and feel to the rider\u2019s throttle operation. With two 10-hole, long-nose, 49 PSI (343kpa) high-pressure-feed fuel injectors that maximize fuel atomization for better combustion efficiency and helps reduce fuel consumption.\nThe stainless-steel 2-into-1 exhaust system uses a high flow, dual-stage catalytic converter inside the mid-pipe that helps satisfy worldwide emissions standards as a long, upswept muffler is attractive and well positioned for future accessory mounting.\nUse of long-reach iridium spark plugs helps cool the cylinder head and deliver a strong spark that helps combustion efficiency which can improve fuel economy.\nThe six-speed transmission features gear ratios that deliver exciting acceleration, whether shifting normally or when using the standard-equipment Bi-directional Quick Shift system to shift without clutch operation.\nThe V-STROM 800DE\u2019s precise shift linkage helps the rider easily and quickly select the ideal gear for the riding conditions.\nThe transmission\u2019s output is managed by the Suzuki Clutch Assist System (SCAS). This system works like a slipper clutch by allowing a small amount of clutch slip to enable smooth downshifts. It also works as an assist clutch, increasing plate pressure under acceleration, but always keeps the clutch lever pull light and precise.\nRiding on durable steel sprockets, a strong O-ring style drive chain contains lubrication pre-packed between the pins and rollers for quiet, reliable operation.\nDesigned around the compact parallel twin engine and constructed with rugged steel pipe, the V-STROM 800DE\u2019s backbone style frame was engineered to help provide the foundational strength required for excellent straight-line performance and nimble handling when negotiating rugged trails or touring at highway speeds.\nDeveloped exclusively for the V-STROM 800DE, the SHOWA supplied front fork and single-shock, with rear suspensions\u2019 spring rate and damping force settings were tuned to maximize performance and comfort when riding on all surfaces, on- or off-road. Both front and rear suspension provide a long 8.7-inch (220mm) of travel.\nThe V-STROM 800DE rides on sturdy spoke-style wheels and is equipped with a 21-inch front wheel for greater stability and better control off pavement. The rear 17-inch wheel has a 150mm wide tire for better grip and ride compliance. The 90/90-21 front and 150/70R17 rear Dunlop TRAILMAX MIXTOUR tires feature a semi-block tread pattern with long, straight diagonal grooves to provide traction off-road.\nThe front lightweight dual-piston NISSIN-supplied front brake calipers are axial mounted to provide ample clearance to the front wheel\u2019s spokes while allowing for strong and light axle holders at the bottom of each fork leg. The rear brake combines a single-piston, slide-pin style NISSIN caliper with a 260mm disc, providing the rider the braking feel that aids low speed maneuvering.\nThe modest windscreen is designed to maximize the rider\u2019s visibility when riding on roads or trails. Developed through wind tunnel testing, the windscreen deflects wind blast and sounds away from the rider.\nThe lightweight resin luggage rack incorporates easy-to-grasp grab bars. Contributing to the DE's rugged identity, a mesh guard that protects the radiator from flying stones and other debris when riding on the trail and a 4mm (0.15 in.) thick plastic undercover provides engine and exhaust protection.\nThe advanced electronic systems of the Suzuki Intelligent Ride System (S.I.R.S.) helps V-STROM 800DE riders optimize performance characteristics to best suit their riding style, level of experience, and the riding conditions. This makes the V-STROM 800DE more predictable and more enjoyable out on the trail, on a twisty road, or touring down the highway, and it adds up to a more exciting, confident, and fun riding experience.\nThe S.I.R.S. suite includes the Suzuki Drive Mode Selector (SDMS), the Suzuki Traction Control System (STCS) and the Bi-directional Quick Shift System (QS) that supports the rider in a variety of conditions. Also included is the Ride-by-Wire Electronic Throttle System, the Suzuki Easy Start, and Low RPM Assist systems for accurate and convenient motorcycle operation.\nThe V-STROM 800DE\u2019s instrument panel uses a full-color, 5-inch, TFT screen.\nAvailable only on the V-STROM DE models, the rider can switch off rear ABS for riding on gravel and other unpaved surfaces.\nThe Traction Control System* allows the rider the option to select one of five modes (1, 2, 3, Gravel, and OFF). The four active modes differ in terms of rear wheel spin sensitivity.\nA USB-type accessory slot is conveniently located on the left side of the instrument panel dash. This fused slot can provide up to 5.0 VDC at a maximum current of 2.0A. The slot is ideal for powering a GPS unit or charging mobile devices.\nRetaining the prominent \u201cbeak\u201d that was pioneered on Suzuki\u2019s legendary DR-Z Dakar racer and the large DualSport DR-Big, the lines of the Champion Yellow No. 2 or Glass Sparkle Black body work are sharper with flatter surfaces to create a tough yet sophisticated look. Different colored panels feature angular lines that further amplify the V-STROM 800DE\u2019s modern, aggressive look.\nThe V-STROM 800DE uses a three-piece front fender assembly that combines the effectiveness of a conventional V-STROM fender with the protection of fork guards like those used on an MX bike.\nThe V-STROM 800DE has a wide tapered handlebar cast in strong yet flexible aluminum that allows it to flex and absorb shock when riding on unpaved surfaces. In addition, the wider grip position helps provide comfort particularly when standing on the foot pegs to negotiate rough terrain.\nThe fuel tank has a generous 5.3-gallon (20L) capacity but is shaped to be thin at the rear to flow into the slim seat, which aids the rider in touching the ground at stops.\nAttention to detail extends to the engine as the clutch cover and magneto cover have a bronze-like finish that complements the V-STROM 800DE\u2019s body color, while the SUZUKI name on the cover is in a contrasting color to bring attention to the modern engine.\nWide, steel footrests help the rider comfortably maneuver the V-STROM 800DE on diverse types of roads. Rubber inserts damp vibration but can be removed so the rider\u2019s boots can have even more grip of the pegs. With the mirrors feature a design that complements the V-STROM 800DE\u2019s styling while proving an excellent view of objects behind the rider.\nGenuine Suzuki Accessories for the V-STROM 800DE include side and top cases, engine guards, center stand, low- and high-profile seats, heated hand grips, fog lamps, and more.\nSuzuki 12-month limited warranty.

      "text": "10 Of The Most Affordable Mini Motorcycles To Ride In 2024\nMini motorcycles, also known as minibikes, come in a variety of styles and sizes, delivering huge fun in a downsized package. The post-war Doodle Bug of the '40s is probably the earliest example. In the '50s, mechanics assembled their own custom bikes out of spare parts with go-kart engines and rode them around the pits at local races. This gave way to mass-produced models like the Taco Mini Bike, Rupp, Bonanza, and others in the 1960s. These were a blast to ride, but were only ever for recreation off-road. That would change with Honda.\nHonda owned the Tama Tech amusement park in the 1960s and created little motorcycles for visitors to the park. As it turns out, they were so popular that Honda decided to put them into regular production, and they arrived Stateside in 1968. In contrast to the various existing models, mostly powered by lawnmower engines, the Honda was well-engineered and built with Honda quality. It set itself ahead of the pack and started a boom for fun, pint-sized motorcycles you could legally drive on the streets. Historically, minibikes have been viewed mostly as toys in the United States. However, a resurgence has seen their popularity shoot up, and today, we have many to choose from. Therefore, today we have choices aplenty; these are the 10 most affordable to ride in 2024.\nHonda Monkey\nAfter hitting the American streets back in 1968, it did not take long for Honda's adorable Z50 to acquire a nickname, the Monkey. While it continued in production for many years, it underwent several changes and essentially became something different. But now, in the 2020s, it is back and proudly wearing the Monkey badge on its side covers. While the fun spirit of the original Z50 is back, this Monkey is an all-new ride.\nThe Monkey, powered by a modern 125cc four-stroke fuel-injected engine, debuted for the 2018 model year. It is a small bike but, despite its looks, it's much larger than the original Z50. This means it is a reasonable ride for short commuting and a runabout for city living. Further separating it from '60s-era technology are disc brakes with ABS and digital gauges. The 125cc engine provides triple the power of the original, which is plenty for modern traffic, and can get the little primate up to around 60 mph in fifth gear. Plus, reliable starting comes courtesy of its electric starter.\nComparatively, this bike is in another league altogether from its inspiration. The Monkey is a comfortable little cruiser that comes standard with the expected refinement and build quality of a Honda vehicle, at a retail price of $4,299. Furthermore, riders can expect upwards of 150 mpg. Best of all, its larger size means you won't look like an ape while you are riding it.\nCFMOTO Papio\nA relative newcomer to the motorcycle market, CFMOTO has shown up heavy with product over the last few years, determined to win over American buyers. Although it has several new models for sale right now, CFMOTO, founded in 1989, began exporting scooters to the United States in the early 2000s and later expanded into motorcycles. The current lineup offers several enticing models with engines up to 800cc, but today we are discussing the delightful little Papio.\nAvailable in two styles, the CL and the SS, the Papio is a 126cc minibike with all the makings of a regular around-town commuter. With its dual parallel headlights and diminutive fairing, the Papio SS looks akin to a classic cafe racer in miniature. However, the styling is clever and attractive, and it is backed up by some impressive specs. The CL model is a bit more stripped down, with semi-knobby tires appropriate for light trail riding or as a perfect beach cruiser. Both bikes are powered by a fuel-injected single making 9.4 horsepower on a 48-inch wheelbase that weighs in at a scant 250 pounds. The gauge blends an analog tachometer with a digital readout for speed.\nChinese motorcycles have long been cheap machines you should avoid. CFMOTO is changing this, introducing new models of excellent build quality. While the Papio has not been around long enough for long-term reliability testing, other models are receiving 5/5 from outlets like Motorcycle News. The new Papio is definitely worth a second look, especially considering the retail price of either version is $3,299, hundreds less than comparable models.\nHonda GROM\nHonda Powersports introduced its 125cc GROM to the U.S. market back in 2014 and it has been a hot seller ever since. There was nothing else like it at the time and it is surely the reason for the resurgence in minibikes up until now. However, there is good reason for that as the GROM is a delightful small bike that anyone who straddles one will have trouble finding any faults.\nThe Honda GROM is celebrating 10 years on the market as of 2024. The staying power of this model has proven the American desire for agile and efficient minibikes. What makes it a good bike is its versatility and overall usefulness. While bigger bikes can go faster and further, often with much more comfort, the GROM can be a better choice for everyday tasks. Able to keep up with most city traffic and small enough to maneuver just about anywhere, the GROM makes a trip to the store or a run to a friend's house more carefree. Being able to thread a needle through traffic and stick the GROM in the tightest of parking situations is a big part of its appeal. Furthermore, with ample power for its size, many riders have taken to using them for trick riding and even racing.\nFor $3,599 retail, you get a 125cc fuel-injected bike with ABS, digital gauges, and a top speed near 60 mph. Unless you need consistent highway speeds or carry passengers regularly, there are few reasons not to buy a GROM.\nKymco Spade\nTaiwanese manufacturer Kymco is known globally for its wide range of high-quality scooters, but also offers motorcycles from time to time. One of its recent models falls within the minibike category and it is called the Spade. Its styling appears as more of a shrunken version of a Japanese standard bike than specifically a minibike. However, its proportions are appropriate and the classic motorbike styling looks great.\nKymco offers a lot with the Spade, although it has some minor flaws. Power is provided by a 150cc engine with four valves per cylinder that makes 12 horsepower. Kymco reliability is about as good as anything else on the market and the price is a good value, $2,999. You do not get fuel injection with this engine and, while the front brake is a disc, the rear is a drum, and neither offers ABS. The gauges are basic but effective: The Spade comes only with a low-fuel light instead of a full gauge.\nThe strongest trait the Spade has going for it is the retro motorcycle styling, which is effective and attractive. Sadly, Kymco discontinued this model recently, leaving only its K-Pipe 125, an overall less appealing model, for the American market. Nonetheless, the Spade is worth mentioning, and with such a low price when new, used ones should be available for a relative bargain today.\nKawasaki Z125 Pro\nWith the Honda GROM taking off with such stellar success, its home turf competition must have felt a need to step up with its own alternative. While the Honda Monkey and Kymco Spade evoke strong feelings of nostalgia, Kawasaki's Z125 Pro eschews the past with its modern styling.\nDebuting in the 2017 model year, the Z125 Pro appeared to be an answer to the Honda GROM. With similar dimensions and the same size engine, Kawasaki indeed provided a viable alternative. Inevitably, discussion of this bike will include comparisons to its prime competitor, but it can stand on its own. Powered by a modern fuel-injected two-valve single coupled to a four-speed transmission, the Z125 Pro is a basic and small bike perfect for inner-city cruising. It is lightweight and agile, and Kawasaki chose to go with more aggressive styling derivative of the bigger and faster machines of the Z lineup, such as the Z900 or Z650.\nSince not everybody likes retro styling (nor do they want to be pigeonholed into a single option), it is good Kawasaki has brought this bike to market. At around $3,700, pricing is competitive with the GROM, and build quality is also excellent. This might be a tough choice, although Kawasaki fans who want a nimble city bike will have no trouble deciding on the Z125 Pro. An additional point worth mentioning is that Kawasaki markets a Z125 in international markets, and that is a different and larger model than the Z125 Pro.\nHonda Navi\nOver the last few years, Honda seems to have been on a tear with its development of small bikes. Even though Honda is known today for building excellent quality machines that often come with premium pricing, the company continues to offer models for any budget. Furthermore, even though its GROM is relatively affordable, Honda offers another model for less, the Navi.\nLaunched in the United States in 2022, the Navi takes what worked on the GROM and trimmed a few specs to bring the price down. Its engine is reduced to 109cc and drives the rear wheel through a CVT transmission. The engine sits low to the ground as it is a version of what Honda installs on its scooters \u2014 the Navi essentially rides on a modified scooter chassis. The engine relies on a carburetor for fuel, both brakes use drums instead of discs, and instrumentation is all analog, though it does receive a full-fledged fuel gauge, not that you will need to look at it all too often with its more than 100 mpg fuel economy. Having the engine low-slung with the fuel tank in the traditional motorcycle location provided Honda an opportunity to include a generous lockable storage box where you might expect to see an engine.\nOverall, the Navi is a blast, and its retail price of under $2,000 makes it a genuine value.\nBenelli TNT135\nOriginally founded in Italy, Benelli has a long history of motorcycle production beginning even before WWI. After decades of manufacturing innovative bikes, including many winning race models, the company was acquired by a Chinese company in 2005, eventually being folded into the huge Geely automotive group. Today, Benelli endures, with design and engineering going on in its traditional home in Pesaro, Italy while manufacturing takes place in Wenling, China.\nBenelli also has a history of producing minibikes going back to the '70s, but today the company offers a thoroughly modern example with its TNT 135. Like the Kawasaki Z125 Pro, the junior Benelli strikes an aggressive stance with its contemporary styling. In further comparison to its rivals, the Benelli benefits from technical advantages, at least on paper, from its four-valve engine, additional 100cc of displacement to 135, trellis frame, and a fifth gear in the transmission \u2014 the GROM only recently started offering its 5-speed. On pavement, the benefits are real, and the TNT 135 pulls away from intersections with surprising torque and takes its rider to a top speed of 75 mph, plenty for most state highways. This makes the Benelli a very good option for the city rider who wants to venture out a bit further somewhat regularly. As a bonus, it looks pretty darn good, too.\nWhether Benelli can overcome the made-in-China negative bias is yet to be seen. The quality appears to be there. However, the real coup de gr\u00e2ce against its competitors is the low retail price, starting at just $3,199.\nSSR Lazer 6\nRebadged Chinese models are generally frowned upon by serious motorcycle riders, who prefer to ride something that is a known quantity, with high reliability and robust parts and service support. However, the quality of Chinese-built machines varies widely, depending on whether a domestic distributor or manufacturer supports them. One such distributor that has been around for a while is SSR Motorsports, which has been importing Chinese machines since 2002.\nThere are a few good reasons to discuss the SSR Lazer 6. Most of all, its unique styling is like no other minibike on the market. It is decidedly retro, but rather than aping the standard Japanese and Euro bikes of the '70s, this one is more of a miniature version of pre-war Indians and Harleys. It is one of those things that is honestly so corny it becomes cool. This is further punctuated by the fact that the Lazer 6 is actually a moped. The drivetrain is a basic 50cc engine driving the rear wheel in conjunction with bicycle pedals. Though it is listed as automatic, it looks as though it may just be a direct drive. Mopeds are nearly extinct these days, making this extremely rare. It does come with wire wheels and front disc brake, and it is a hardtail, with bumps taken up by the front forks and a sprung saddle.\nThis thing is probably pretty slow but can be registered for street use. Best of all, with an MSRP of just $1,599, it's utterly affordable.\nItaljet Dragster\nMany storied motorcycle brands hail from Italy, with varying levels of historical success. Italjet has a long history of producing Italian machines, although it has never been one of the majors. While Italjet has made a variety of motorcycles, including minibikes, its only current model is technically a scooter, but it is so different and so cool that it deserves a mention.\nThe Italjet Dragster currently in production is the second iteration of this model \u2014 the original two-stroke Dragster was produced from 1998 to 2003. Italjet resurrected the Dragster for the 2022 model year, updating it with a modern frame and suspension and a new 125cc or 200cc four-stroke and fuel-injected engine. Viewing a Dragster makes it immediately apparent this is no ordinary scooter or motorcycle or whatever it is. There is no question this machine is unique. The clever trellis frame features a monoshock holding down the engine/transmission combo in the rear, while a similar setup does the same up front. Furthermore, the steering is a hub-centric system that isolates the front wheel from the handlebars for added stability. The rest of the bike is largely a naked style with minimal, aggressive body components and other bold and angular touches throughout.\nIt's a quick bike that will stand out in a crowd. Plans are in motion to bring it Stateside in 2024 by the Genuine Scooter Company, and Italet is already putting the finishing touches on a bonkers 559cc parallel-twin version next. Affordability is borderline, as the U.K. version currently retails for \u00a35,499.\nHonda Dax 125\nWhile Honda currently offers three small rides in the United States, a fourth one can be had overseas. Introduced for the 2023 model year, the Dax resuscitates the classic Honda CT70 trail bike from the 1970s. The original CT70, which can sell for well over $10,000 today, came alongside the original Monkey as a slightly larger version with a bit more practicality on or off the road \u2014 both were street-legal. Like the Monkey, the Dax closely mimics the CT70 but in a larger overall package.\nDax buyers receive a small but modern bike featuring a fuel-injected 125cc engine with a four-speed transmission. Like the CT-70, the transmission uses a centrifugal clutch, and shifting is accomplished without requiring a clutch lever. Honda has also kept the toe-heel gear shifter, which is easy to use but may take some getting used to. Unlike the original, the Dax is larger by what appears to be about 25% at a glance, and benefits from larger wheels, a longer wheelbase, disc brakes front and rear, fuel injection, and electric start. The old CT-70 suffered from weak and tiny drum brakes and a squirrely ride, while the new Dax is a stable, modern machine, perfect for riding in the city and on trails.\nHonda nostalgia is strong these days, pushing the company to revive an increasing number of cherished classic models. While the original CT-70 was exported to the United States, the new one, priced at \u00a33,799.00 in the U.K., is reserved for other markets for its inaugural year."

      "text": "Honda's VTEC System Explained (And What Makes It So Good)\nTake a look at any modern Honda car and you will likely notice the word \"VTEC\" etched on it somewhere. You may have even heard of the meme \"VTEC just kicked in.\" And although VTEC itself is associated with Honda's performance cars like the Civic Type-R or Honda S2000, it's not explicitly relegated to the fast end of Honda's lineup, as even Honda's crossovers and minivans utilize VTEC technology. So what is it, and why does it set Honda apart?\nVTEC is an acronym that stands for Variable Valve Time and Electronic Lift Control. That mouthful means that cars with VETC can \"extract maximum horsepower and torque from smaller displacement engines without using turbocharging,\" according to Honda. The first ever car to debut with a VTEC-equipped engine was the 1989 Honda Integra XSi overseas. Despite its relatively small 1.6-liter engine, the little Integra could pump out 160 horsepower.\nA lot of power from a small engine\nAs for how it actually works, it's a marvel of automotive engineering. At the top of most modern car engines is the \"head\" that contains, in simple terms, all the valves, camshaft(s), and sparkplugs that make the engine function. VTEC works by using a set of three rocker arms on top of each cylinder resting on a camshaft that controls the valves. As Honda says, a low speeds, when the engine isn't revving very fast, a third of those rocker arms don't do anything, mainly because the engine isn't working very hard. When you kick it into high gear, that third rocker arm clocks in to work and is able to help the engine achieve more horsepower as the revs climb.\nHonda attests that VTEC allows your average Honda to essentially take on the persona of two different cars. When your Civic is just cruising around, it's not particularly exciting, but gets the commute done. However when it hits a high enough RPM, VTEC works its magic and allows its tiny powerplant to output as much power as it can muster. Even the exhaust sound changes, according to Honda, as the fundamental nature of how the exhaust exits the engine (through the valves) has been altered.\nThe de facto standard for Honda\nNowadays, Hondas run with a modernized version of VTEC called \"i-VTEC\" that makes the process more computerized. In addition to squeezing every possible bit of power out of a tiny engine, VTEC can also be utilized to achieve better fuel economy. At low-RPMs, the engine isn't working very hard, therefore getting more MPGs.\nMost automakers today have some sort of variable valve-timing systems and a catchy name for it. Honda was just one of the first brands to do it \u2014 and by far the most well-recognized. Given the fact that a Honda S2000 can somehow get 240 horsepower out of a 2-liter engine, means that its might be one of the best manufacturers to ever do it. You can find VTEC on a wide number of Hondas dating back to the late 1980s and early 1990s. Today, VTEC is present on just about every car Honda makes and has become a de facto standard feature on any engine bearing a Honda badge."
