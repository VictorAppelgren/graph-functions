  "description": "Sony's best over-ears are now even better",
  "content": "Sony has been at the forefront of audio tech since its founding nearly 80 years ago, when it launched with Japan\u2019s first tape recorder. In the years since, the iconic brand has dominated the audiovisual market, particularly in the personal audio space. The fact the Walkman became synonymous with portable music players is especially revealing.\n\nIn short, Sony is a brand you can trust for the best quality in personal audio.\n\nA shining example is the company\u2019s latest WH-1000XM6 over-ear headphones, which represent the amalgamation of decades of expertise to deliver the absolute best noise cancellation currently available.\n\nA champion nearly 10 years in the making\n\nThe Sony WH-1000XM6s arrive with an illustrious heritage. Their lineage can be traced back to the MDR-1000X headphones that launched in 2016. Sony claimed back then that its inaugural premium pair of headphones were noise-cancelling industry leaders, a claim that was certainly earned.\n\nFour more pairs of class-leading cans have been launched since, all of which adopted the new WH-1000XM naming convention. With each iteration, Sony has improved its ANC technology even further, while also enhancing audio performance, comfort and extra features. They\u2019ve all paved the way for the release of the latest WH-1000XM6 headphones in 2025, which once again see Sony take the crown for the best noise-cancelling over-ears \u2013 that's based on both Sony's own testing* and even in our objective and unbiased guide to the best headphones in Australia.\n\nWhether you\u2019re vacuuming around your home, walking down a bustling street or heading to work on a train, the XM6 will isolate you from the noise, even when used at lower volumes.\n\nThe tech used by the best\n\nIt takes more than just good design to be the best, it takes years of experience and industry knowledge to not only recognise the necessary components, but to be able to integrate them into a compelling whole.\n\nIn the WH-1000XM6, Sony didn\u2019t simply take the (admittedly excellent) WH-1000XM5s and give them a couple of new features. Instead, the Japanese electronics giant went back to the drawing board and developed a new processor and new drivers.\n\nSony claims its new HD Noise Cancelling Processor QN3 is 7x faster than the one found in the previous XM5s, allowing it to instantly analyse external sounds via the headphones\u2019 12 microphones, and counteract them to prevent most external noise from reaching your ears.\n\nThe 30mm drivers inside the earpieces have also had an upgrade, including a new perforated voice coil for improved performance in the higher frequencies, and a new soft-edge dome surround that is more flexible than in the previous model, helping the whole driver move greater quantities of air and enhancing bass performance.\n\nWhere Sony\u2019s pedigree further makes itself known is in the overall sound profile, which is incredibly well-balanced out of the box. Other brands may focus on one frequency range over another, but Sony manages to bring them all together for a truly cohesive and flexible listening experience.\n\nThe Sony WH-1000XM6s come expertly tuned, delivering a balanced profile that caters to all genres. It\u2019s an incredibly revealing listen, and you\u2019ll likely hear nuances in some of your favourite songs you never knew were there. Should you wish to experiment with the sound profile, Sony gives you the tools you need to tailor it to your personal tastes via its feature-packed Sound Connect app.\n\nHead into the app and you can access a 10-band equaliser for comprehensive calibration, or to make things easier, the Find Your Equaliser feature allows you to easily pick your favourite sound signature from a list of presets.\n\nYou can also enable DSEE Extreme, a Sony technology that up-mixes lower quality audio files, breathing new life into them with extra detail and the best sound possible. Plus, the XM6s support Sony\u2019s 360 Reality Audio spatial technology, which can also be used to turn any song into one with greater immersion.\n\nThe final feather in the XM6\u2019s cap is their travel-friendly design and superb carry case. Sony has reintroduced and reengineered a folding mechanism last seen on the WH-1000XM4, that allows the latest set of headphones to be stowed away more easily in a bag or in their case.\n\nThe carry case is equally tough and features a magnetic clasp for simple opening and closing \u2013 no more needing to worry about a zip breaking!\n\n*As of March 1, 2025.

That\u2019s where TechRadar comes in. With over 15 years of experience testing and reviewing headphones, our expert team knows exactly what sets the best models apart. Whether it\u2019s exceptional audio quality, smart features, or long-lasting comfort, every pair in this guide has been carefully tested, compared, and handpicked by us.\nLooking for something more specific? We\u2019ve got dedicated guides to the best wireless headphones, best noise-cancelling headphones, or best cheap headphones if you're on a budget. And for the hi-fi fans, we have our guide to the best wired headphones.\nWant something smaller? Don\u2019t miss our picks for the best earbuds and best noise cancelling earbuds.\nWhy you can trust TechRadar's headphones picks\n\u2b63 Read more\nEvery pair of the best headphones featured in this guide has been put through its paces in real-world conditions by the TechRadar team. We only recommend the ones that genuinely impress us based on that testing, and our goal is to whittle the hundreds of headphones on sale down to just the bona-fide best buys in certain categories, to make the choice easy for you.\nI lead TechRadar's audio reviews writers, and I worked with everyone on the team to craft this guide, combining their expertise and experience, and balancing against elements such as price.\nI've reviewed over 150 audio products since becoming a tech journalist, ranging from super-budget earbuds to high-end Hi-Res Audio music players. Before joining TechRadar, I spent three years at What Hi-Fi? testing everything the world of audio had to offer; before that, I was a professional dancer. My love of music ties it all together.\nOur reviews are fully independent, and are written by people who've been steeped in the audio world for years \u2013 people who aren't wowed by marketing, and are focused on the results.\nWe test claims such as battery life by actually timing the headphones to see how long they last, we test music using both a standardized playlist (which you can see here if you want to try it for yourself) as well as whatever our reviewers want to listen to, and we test active noise cancellation in real conditions such as on public transport, in a caf\u00e9, and in an office.\nSome elements of headphones are objective, but many are subjective, so we'll give you our honest opinion, and hopefully enough information for you decide if you think your views align with ours.\nWe review many more headphones than are featured here, so if a pair you're hoping to see are missing, you might find them in our list of other headphones we've tested. It doesn't mean we hate them, it might just mean that there's a pair a little bit better that we like more. Or it might mean we hate them, to be fair.\nAugust 7, 2025\nEdited the introduction. Added details of the Cambridge Audio P100 SE to our Cambridge Melomania P100 entry. Tweaked our WH-1000XM4 entry to explain why we don't recommend the new XM6 instead. Added several new entries to our 'More we tested' section.\nThe quick list\nGet right to it with our easy-to-browse list of the best headphones for different needs. You can click to instantly jump to more full write-up of each model.\nBest headphones overall\nThe best headphones for most people\nThe WH-100XM4 still sit at the top of this list despite being older because their price has dropped a lot, so they're still super value for the audio and noise-stopping quality \u2013 as long as you can find them at a bargain price.\nBest budget headphones\nThe best low-price headphones\nFor under $100, these over-ears deliver a seriously impressive package. Customizable sound, strong ANC, and fantastic battery life.

They'll suit audiophiles looking for detailed bass, and even those dealing with sound professionally.\nBest audiophile wired headphones\nThe best audiophile wired headphones\nThese wired over-ears are our top pick if you're looking for an incredibly detailed and revealing sound. Although they're incredibly expensive, for the most discerning of listeners, they're also absolutely worth it.\nThe best headphones you can buy\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBelow you'll find full write-ups for each of the best headphones in our list. We've tested each one extensively, so these recommendations are based on real-world experience.\nThe best headphones for most people\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want versatile headphones that sound good: The Sony WH-1000XM4 deliver high-quality sound in a lightweight folding design that's good for travel.\n\u2705 You want strong noise cancellation: With the volume up and the noise cancelling on, the WH-1000XM4 can block out a lot.\n\u274c You plan on bringing them to the gym or beach: A looser fit and lack of water-resistance should make you think twice before putting them inside your gym bag.\n\u274c You take tons of conference calls: While these are great for travel, their call quality isn't that strong.\nThe Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones are our top pick for most people because they sound good, they\u2019re packed with features and they\u2019re such good value.\nHaving said that, they can be beaten in every other way by the newer Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones at #4 in this list. Sound, design and ANC have all been given a significant boost. But the price is high for those new additions. Which is why the XM4 are still our top pick for the majority of readers. Especially since they've had a permanent price drop and they\u2019re often discounted during sales events. They make a lot of sense as you can find them for a price lower than other premium headphones, while still delivering excellent all-round performance.\nThese over-ear headphones sound weighty but well-balanced, with a warm and inviting tone. They're generous with the bass, but not overly so. The active noise cancellation is very strong too, and though it's been notably bettered by the Sony XM6, again, it's great for the price.\nThey're bursting with features too, including Sony's DSEE Extreme upscaling for lower-quality music from sources such as Spotify, multipoint pairing for easy switching between devices, auto play/pause when you take them off, Sony's 360 Reality Audio spatial audio, and LDAC wireless support for CD-quality wire-free sound from compatible phones. It's a shame there's no aptX, but it's not a deal-breaker.\nThey're very comfortable thanks to a lightweight design, and wearing them for long periods is no strain at all. A 3.5mm jack means you can connect them to a wired source easily, though there's no USB-C audio input (the USB-C port is for charging only).\nThe 30-hour battery life is pretty typical, though is smashed by the 60 hours of the Cambridge Audio Melomania P100 at #6 on the list, which also clearly beat these on sound quality when comparing the two. Though as mentioned above, we still think the Sony are great value at their reduced price.\nThat's the story for these headphones at this point: you can find something that does any individual thing better, but nothing that does so much so well as their lower price. But make sure you're paying $200/\u00a3200 or under.\nRead our full Sony WH-1000XM4 review\nThe best budget headphones\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want surprisingly good ANC: They block out background noise better than you'd expect for the price, with a handy passthrough mode.\n\u2705 You\u2019re on a budget: At under $100, they pack in solid sound and features without draining your wallet.\n\u274c You want audiophile-level sound: Yes, they sound great for the price, but they don\u2019t quite reach the rich, detailed heights of premium headphones.\n\u274c You want a luxury finish: They look sleek enough, but the build feels a bit plasticky \u2013 if you're after something ultra-sturdy or high-end, they might not hit the mark.\nThe 1More Sonoflow Pro HQ51s are a standout pick for budget over-ear headphones, packing in a seriously impressive spec list for the price. Here, you\u2019ll find strong ANC, customizable sound, and a battery life that wipes the floor with many premium rivals. All in all, they\u2019re a great option for anyone who wants feature-rich headphones without breaking the bank.\nFeature-wise, you get support for LDAC for high-res Bluetooth streaming, multi-point connectivity, and a companion app with EQ controls and ANC modes. There\u2019s also passthrough here, which means you can hear the outside world when you need to, and battery life is a real highlight \u2013 up to 100 hours with ANC off, or 65 with it on.\nAudio performance is big and bold, leaning towards a bassier signature that's great for pop, hip-hop, and electronic music. Detail is solid, especially if you're using LDAC or the wired connection, and the app lets you tweak the EQ to suit your taste. You won\u2019t get premium-tier sound, but at this price you wouldn\u2019t expect it either, would you? Because what\u2019s important is these headphones are seriously impressive for this price bracket.\nThe 1More Sonoflow Pro HQ51 also look the part, with a sleek matte finish and angled earcups that feel modern and stylish. They\u2019re comfortable enough for long listening sessions too, with plush padding on the headband and earcups. Build quality does feel a bit plasticky at times, but again, that makes sense considering the asking price.\nAdd in a sturdy carry case, wired connection, and a solid mic for calls, and these over-ears deliver one of the best all-round budget headphone packages out there. If you're after long battery life, punchy sound and ANC on a budget, they\u2019re hard to beat.\nRead our full 1More Sonoflow Pro HQ51 review\nThe best premium headphones\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You appreciate premium craftsmanship: From the moment you unbox them, they exude quality. They look and feel every bit as premium as their price suggests.\n\u2705 You\u2019re here for the sound: Yes, they're premium all-rounders, but they excel in their audio quality. They deliver beautifully balanced, expressive sound across the board that beats the Sony WH-1000XM6 easily.\n\u274c You need full playback control on the headphones: One quirk here is you can\u2019t skip tracks with the onboard controls. You\u2019ll need to pull out your phone if you want to jump ahead.\n\u274c You live in a very windy place: The Px7 S3 aren\u2019t the most wind-resistant headphones out there. If you regularly walk across blustery hillsides, you might want to look elsewhere.\nThe Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 headphones are a seriously impressive package. They deliver high-end sound in a refined design, with features that make them one of the top contenders in the best headphones space \u2013 as long as you can afford their premium price tag.\nYou get Bluetooth 5.3 with aptX Lossless support, multipoint connectivity, and a solid 30 hours of battery life. Noise cancellation is bespoke and highly effective \u2013 while it might not edge out Bose or Sony\u2019s latest XM6, it\u2019s still excellent.\nPlus, spatial audio and Auracast support are on the way via a future update according to B&W, which would make this a future-proof choice, though we always recommend buying something for the features it has, not what's promised in the future. There\u2019s already a five-band EQ, voice assistant support, and a USB-C slot for both charging and hi-res data transfer.\nSound is where these over-ears shine. We said in our review that the redesigned 40mm biocellulose drivers deliver an expansive, open soundstage with great tonal balance. We loved the punchy bass, lively mids, crisp treble, and real finesse across genres. They\u2019re detailed, dynamic, and rhythmically engaging, and offer simply some of the best sound you\u2019ll get from a pair of wireless headphones right now. The only slight downside is that will catch a bit of wind noise in blustery conditions.\nWe've compared them directly to the Sony WH-1000XM6, as two of the latest and greatest headphones available, and the Bowers & Wilkins have a clear lead on sound quality \u2013 it's instantly obvious. But the Sony win on noise cancellation and other smart features.\nDesign-wise, the Px7 S3s have been slimmed down from previous generations. They look far sleeker and more discreet, with a beautifully finished build that feels every bit as premium as the audio. A new headband and arm mechanism improve comfort, and the memory foam ear pads with pleather finish are soft enough for hours of wear. Bonus points for the smart new carry case, complete with a magnetic flap.\nYes, they're not cheap at \u00a3399/$449 \u2013 but that's the same price as the Sony XM6, and around the same as the Bose Ultra Headphones, so they're in line with the competition. With this level of polish, performance, and spec, the Px7 S3 earn their keep. You\u2019re paying for a premium experience, and in this case, you absolutely get one.\nRead our full Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 review\nThe best headphones for ANC\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want industry-leading ANC: These headphones deliver best-in-class noise cancelling, rivalling even Bose\u2019s top models. Whether it\u2019s urban noise, appliances, or office chatter, they effectively mute the outside world.\n\u2705 You value advanced features: With LDAC, DSEE Extreme, adaptive ANC, customizable EQ, and spatial audio support, these headphones are built for serious audio fans.\n\u274c You\u2019re trying to keep costs down: These are premium headphones with a premium price. For something more affordable, look at Sony WH-1000XM4 at #1 on the list or the 1More Sonoflow Pro HQ51 at #2 on the list.\n\u274c You need extended battery life: 30 hours per charge is respectable, but not standout. Competing models like the Cambridge Audio Melomania P100 at #11 offer three times as much.\nThe Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones are the most advanced the brand has ever made. We loved how they blend the design strengths of the XM4 and XM5 that came before them, and build on everything Sony\u2019s already done well with noticeably better ANC and more expressive sound. Sony promised \u201cimprovements in every single way,\u201d and this time the marketing line holds up.\nWe found the touch controls to be sleek and intuitive, and the headphones are packed with features. But it's the ANC that stands out the most here, thanks to Sony\u2019s new QN3 processor and a whopping 12 microphones, you get world-class noise cancelling that we think just about outperforms the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones. Public transport becomes blissfully quiet.\nBattery life is average at 30 hours, which is passable given the power behind the ANC. You can use them while charging, and a quick three-minute charge gives you three hours of playtime, which is a big win if you're on the go. The Sony Headphones Connect app is also excellent, with EQ settings, adaptive sound control, LDAC higher-res wireless, and a neat spatial mode for more immersive audio.\nThe 30mm drivers combined with that new QN3 chip deliver punchy bass, detailed mids, and sparkling treble. It\u2019s a clean, balanced listen, whether you're tuning into a podcast or getting lost in an album. Those 12 mics don\u2019t just help with ANC either, they make call quality crisp and reliable.\nDesign-wise, they\u2019re incredibly comfy. Lightweight with a wider headband and snug fit. They fold, unlike the XM5s, which means they\u2019re more portable again. The hinges feel sturdier, the case is more compact, and the overall finish is smoother and more refined. There's still no waterproofing, though, and some might find them a bit bulky on the head compared to a few alternatives.\nThey're not cheap at $449 / \u00a3399, and the price bump over the Sony WH-1000XM5 is notable. But if you're after class-leading ANC that also comes with all the best smart features, this is the all-rounder you're after. They're just kept from being further up the list by the superior sound of the B&W Px7 S3 at #3 in the list.\nRead our full Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones review\nThe best headphones for wireless sound\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You like your devices to be of a high standard: They look and feel premium, which is to be expected for their price, of course.\n\u2705 You want clear, rich sound: We were incredibly impressed with the performance of these over-ears during our testing.\n\u274c You want a vegan option: Leather is used on the exterior of these headphones, which is a shame if you're don't want to buy animal products.\n\u274c You like to customize your listening: There are only two EQ settings for the Dali IO-8, the lack of an app will be a dealbreaker for some.\nThe Dali IO-8 over-ear headphones have been built to an exceptionally high standard, but they truly shine where audio quality is concerned. We genuinely couldn't pick fault with them during our testing, so it's easy to see why they're our top pick if sound is your top priority above all else.\nFeatures-wise, these headphones are packed with most of the high-tech goodies you'd expect, including Bluetooth 5.2 with aptX Adaptive compatibility, 24bit/96kHz support and 50mm full-range drivers with 10Hz-43kHz frequency response. You'll also get a decent 30 hours of battery life with ANC on. The only thing missing is a control app, meaning you can't tweak sound profiles \u2013 then again, when they sound this good, why would you want to?\nThe Dali IO-8 deliver audio that we described as \"detailed and expansive\" in our review, stating that \"no element of a recording is too fleeting to elude them.\" There's also wonderful richness and clarity across the whole range and a tonality we called \"carefully neutral\". ANC is here and it's good, but it's not best-in-class, look to Bose for that.\nThese headphones deliver in the looks department as well as sound, with a high level of build and finish quality. The design is also nice to look at, with perfectly circular ear cups. They're comfortable thanks to memory foam in the cups and an adjustable headband. We also like that, if you forget to charge them, you can listen to these headphones wired, too. A great option for ultimate convenience. The only drawback is leather has been used on the exterior of the cups, which means vegans should steer clear.\nOf course, the Dali IO-8 are not cheap. But if high-quality sound and an equally impressive build are what you're after \u2013 and you're happy with no app and leather \u2013 they're well worth your money.\nRead our full Dali IO-8 review\nThe best headphones for battery life\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You don't want to think about battery life: 60 hours of longevity per charge with ANC on and 100 hours without is truly exceptional.\n\u2705 You like an app with lots of options: Everything you need is here to customize your experience, including EQ settings.\n\u274c You want best-in-class noise cancellation: The ANC here is very good, but the Sony WH-1000XM6 at #7 do it better.\n\u274c You want light and portable: They're not big or heavy, but they don't fold up as much as they could and the accompanying case is a bit big.\nExpect enjoyable and highly engaging sound from the Cambridge Audio Melomania P100 headphones, which we couldn\u2019t fault for the price during our testing. In our review, we wrote: \u201cThere\u2019s a stack of detail, a wide-open soundstaging, vaulting dynamic potency and an engaging, lively overall attitude that will keep you coming back for more.\u201d You can also tweak the sound via the app, where you\u2019ll find a seven-band equaliser with several presets.\nBut they're our top recommendation for battery, so let's get to that, because it's seriously impressive. You'll get 100 hours of battery life here, which is incredible. Admittedly, that\u2019s without ANC, but with ANC on, you\u2019ll get 60 hours, which is still as good as it gets \u2013 it's double what the Sony WH-1000XM6 or the B&W Px7 S3 offer.\nThere's plenty more to like. There\u2019s multipoint connectivity onboard, Bluetooth 5.3, six mics to handle ANC, and an app packed with everything you\u2019ll ever need. You\u2019ll also find aptX Adaptive and aptX Lossless codec compatibility. One rather unexpected but hilarious feature is that actor Matt Berry is one of the options for your \u2018audible feedback\u2019, which, in our review, we referred to as a \u201cstroke of genius\u201d \u2013 seriously, name a better voice actor for this role!\nA pair of premium headphones like these will sound their absolute best with 16-bit/44.1kHz FLAC file action from Qobuz or Tidal, but that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t also do a great job at making any music you throw at them sound incredible. As we wrote in our review: \u201cThey don\u2019t judge \u2013 give them what you\u2019ve got, and they\u2019ll do their best with it.\u201d\nThe active noise cancellation isn\u2019t the best (look to Sony in our #4 spot for that), but it does a good job at nixing most noises \u2013 unless you\u2019re looking for exceptional ANC, this will suit most people.\nThings are just as positive when it comes to their design. In our review, we wrote that these headphones are \u201cflawlessly built and finished\u201d with a combination of memory foam and vegan leather on the earpads and a padded headband.\nWe also found them comfortable to wear. The only minor downside is that their travel case is a bit bigger than it needs to be. But really, we\u2019re nit-picking.\nThe Cambridge Audio Melomania P100 are priced at $279 / \u00a3229 / AU$479, which means they\u2019re a top choice if you can stretch your budget to the premium end of the spectrum \u2013 and if longevity is what's most important to you, you absolutely should.\nWe awarded them five out of five stars in our review, which is a testament to how great these wonderfully-specced headphones sound and the wealth of features on offer.\nSince the original P100 launched, Cambridge Audio has released the P100 SE. So why aren\u2019t we recommending the newer pair instead? Well, the update is minimal. It includes a cushier headband, a new blue finish and Cambridge\u2019s DynamEQ software for boosted bass and treble. While the SE is excellent, it\u2019s also $20 more and the original P100 delivers the same great performance for less. That\u2019s why it remains our top pick here.\nRead our full Cambridge Audio Melomania P100 review\nThe best budget wired headphones\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want clear, precise sound: The Hi-X20 are impressively detailed and insightful. But more than that, they\u2019re genuinely fun to listen to.\n\u2705 You wear headphones for long stretches: Lightweight and well-padded, the Hi-X20 stay comfy even after hours of use.\n\u274c You\u2019re all about that heavy bass: These headphones favor speed and detail over thumping low end.\n\u274c You hate long cables: That 3m cable might be perfect for studio setups, but at home it could just get in the way.\nAustrian Audio has an impressive track record for creating affordable headphones, and the Austrian Audio Hi-X20 are no exception. This pair of wired over-ear headphones deliver truly impressive sound for what is a very modest price. They\u2019re detailed and dynamic with a level of sonic clarity that easily rivals more expensive options, especially if you\u2019re not chasing booming bass.\nThe Austrian Audio Hi-X20 headphones have the brand\u2019s trusted 44mm high-excursion drivers on board. They come with a three-meter long cable that connects to your audio source. Click one end into a 2.5mm socket on the left ear cup and the other has a 3.5mm termination, as well as a 6.3mm adapter. It\u2019s long, which is good news for some \u2013 but might be a bit much for others. While there\u2019s no active noise cancelling here or wireless support, that\u2019s because this is a set of wired headphones focused purely on performance.\nIn our testing, we said that the Hi-X20 over-ears sound rapid and revealing, with great rhythmic control and cohesion. Highs are crisp without harshness, mids are expressive and bass is clean and textured. Though some listeners may want a little more low-end punch. We described them as \u201ca confident and very accomplished listen\u201d in our full review.\nDesign is understated and functional. They\u2019re mostly matte black with minimal branding. The build feels solid thanks to a metal headband and replaceable ear pads. Comfort is excellent, even during long sessions, helped by soft memory foam and a reasonable 255g weight.\nAt just \u00a3120 / $150, these headphones are at the affordable end of the spectrum and feel like excellent value. If you\u2019re after a wired pair of over-ears with a revealing sound and don\u2019t mind the long cable, you\u2019re getting incredible bang for your buck here.\nRead our full Austrian Audio Hi-X20 review\nThe best mid-range wired headphones\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You work with audio professionally: They're built for precision. If you\u2019re mixing, they\u2019ll give you the clarity you need.\n\u2705 You care about bass nuance, not boom: With improved low-end detail, they reveal bass textures mainstream rivals completely gloss over.\n\u274c You need something portable: These wired headphones aren't really made for life on the move. The design lets sound in and out.\n\u274c You want all the mod cons: There\u2019s no Bluetooth, ANC, or smart integrations here. These are classic wired headphones for serious listening.\nThe Sennheiser HD-660S2 are a refined pair of wired, open-backed headphones that deliver neutral, detailed sound with an expansive soundstage. Now, you don\u2019t have to be an audio professional to consider them. But they have been designed with professional and high-fidelity listening in mind at a more affordable, mid-range price point than some higher end options.\nThey feature 38mm dynamic drivers, a wide 8Hz to 41,500Hz frequency range and a high 300 Ohm impedance. You will need a decent amp or DAC to get the best out of them, but Sennheiser includes multiple cables here (6.3mm, 4.4mm and a 3.5mm adapter), which should suit different setups.\nSound quality is where the HD-660S2 headphones shine. We found that bass is tighter and more present than in their predecessor, mids are smooth and expressive and highs remain crisp without becoming fatiguing. The open-back design gives music space to really breathe, helping reveal subtle textures and layering in your favorite tracks.\nAt 260g, they feel more solid than heavy. They\u2019re also nice to wear, with soft, plush ear cushions and a secure fit. The build is sturdy, though the earcups don\u2019t fold or swivel, and the included carry pouch unfortunately offers minimal protection. Then again, they\u2019re not the sort of headphones we can imagine being portable or a good option to carry around for commuting \u2013 they\u2019re open-backed after all.\nThe Sennheiser HD-660S2 certainly aren't cheap, but they\u2019re our top mid-range pick because for audiophiles or creators who value detail, balance, and all-day comfort, they\u2019re an excellent investment, as long as you\u2019ve got the right gear to power them.\nRead our full Sennheiser HD-660S2 review\nThe best audiophile wired headphones\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want your music laid bare: If you love dissecting tracks or want to hear production choices you\u2019ve never noticed, these headphones deliver an exceptional level of precision.\n\u2705 You\u2019ve invested in a high-quality source: They can only do so much. Plug them into a phone or average laptop and you\u2019ll get a polite version of what they\u2019re capable of.\n\u274c You\u2019re already stretching your budget: Yes, the headphones themselves are incredibly expensive but if you also need the high-quality gear to go with them, it's a huge upfront cost.\n\u274c You like a spacious fit around the ears: Despite the large external dimensions, the Liric\u2019s earpads run surprisingly narrow on the inside.\nThe Meze Audio Liric are luxurious closed-back, wired headphones built for serious listening. They\u2019re easily our top pick for audiophiles shopping for a pair of wired headphones that are up to their high-end standards. But, crucially, you need the high-end gear to go with them \u2013 at nearly \u00a31,800 / $2,000, they\u2019re unapologetically premium and their precise, detailed sound rewards high-quality sources and only the most attentive ears.\nThey feature custom planar magnetic drivers co-developed with Rinaro Isodynamics and come with two cables (1.5m and 3m) plus a 6.3mm adapter. You won\u2019t find wireless connectivity, ANC or smart features here. The Liric are strictly about pure, high-fidelity audio and high-quality materials, like leather and aluminium.\nAs you\u2019d expect, they deliver remarkable sonic clarity. From PJ Harvey to Nils Frahm, during our testing the Liric headphones revealed layers, textures and the smallest of details. The midrange is expressive, highs are crisp and the overall tonality stays consistent across the range. The only slight shortfall is the bass: while it is controlled, some may find it lacks a little in weight and punch, but that will be a matter of taste.\nDesign-wise, they\u2019re gorgeously built and more refined than some other Meze models. But they don\u2019t fold up, and the included case is pretty big. Comfort is generally excellent, though we should point out that listeners with larger ears may find the earpads a little snug.\nThe Liric won\u2019t flatter bad sources, but if you\u2019ve got a high-end player or DAC and want sonic insight, elegance and craftsmanship, these are a standout listen for only the most discernible listeners.\nRead our full Meze Audio Liric review\nMore headphones we tested\nApple AirPods Max: Refined and detailed sounds, superb active noise cancellation, amazing spatial audio for movies, and a load of useful smart features when used with Apple devices. So what's the catch? Well, the high price, for one \u2013 these cost a lot, and you can get similar audio performance for less. We also noted in our AirPods Max review that they're heavy and have quite a clamping fit. Plus you need to be all-in on Apple for them to be worthwhile value. They're very good, but in terms of total value, we prefer what's in the list above.\nBose QuietComfort Headphones: Love the idea of the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones above but can't quite justify the price? Read our Bose QuietComfort Headphones review. These older over-ears aren't as good as the Ultras, but they're still comfortable, ANC is excellent and sound is very good indeed. If you can afford the Ultras, have at it. Otherwise, they're a solid alternative \u2013 and still have the Bose stamp of approval.\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones: These Bose headphones were our top ANC pick for a long time, but they've been replaced by the Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones, which offered slightly more effective ANC in our recent testing. However, as you'll see from our Bose QuietComfort Ultra review, they're still exceptionally good headphones, especially where ANC, detailed sound and a premium design and fit is concerned \u2013 and you can often find them far cheaper than the XM6's price.\nBowers & Wilkins Px8: Absolutely magnificent headphones with a sleek design and phenomenal sound quality\u2026 but we think the Dali iO8 in the list do it a little better. But the Px8 look cooler, so aesthete's with audiophile ears should definitely read our full Bowers & Wilkins Px8 review.\nEarfun Tune Pro: You'll get a long battery life and a solid set of features packed into these over-ears for a very good price. But there's not much else to rave about here. As you'll see from our Earfun Tune Pro review, audio quality is lacking and they were uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time, arguably the two most important factors when you're comparing over-ear headphones.\nEarfun Wave Life: Let's start with the negatives, these over-ears have underwhelming ANC and look boring. But, read our Earfun Wave Life review and you'll see we still enjoyed testing them because battery life is very impressive and they're supremely comfortable to wear.\nFocal Bathys MG: Now, these are a very, very good pair of headphones. You've got a premium build and premium sound here. But there's no Auracast support or LC3 codec, which is a shame given the price. If that's not a dealbreaker, do read our full Focal Bathys MG review.\nHappy Plugs Play Pro: These over-ear headphones are nice enough. They're lovely to wear with a strong battery life. But unfortunately ANC doesn't quite cut it. If that's not your priority, have at them and read our full Happy Plugs Play Pro review.\nMeze Audio Poet: Read our Meze Audio Poet review and you'll see that we thoroughly enjoyed testing these open-back headphones from the word go. Expect true audiophile-grade listening, excellent separation and a thoughtful design. However, it's hard to recommend them for most people as they're eye-wateringly expensive. Only consider them if you need only the best, top tier sound.\nNothing Headphone (1): It's unfortunate that sound quality lets these headphones down, because otherwise they're technically impressive and have a very interesting and bold design. Take a look at our full Nothing Headphone (1) review to find out more. And fingers crossed for what Nothing does next with its over-ears, as the update might be great.\nPanasonic RB-M600: Read our Panasonic RB-M600 review to find out why we enjoyed reviewing this pair of over-ears. They're affordable with a decent battery and light build. The problem? There are a few too many downsides to include them in this list, like a so-so ambient mode and a design that won't suit everyone.\nSony WH-1000MX5: We really like these headphones, as you can see in our five-star Sony WH-1000MX5 review \u2013 but they're beaten in key areas by other products that are keeping them out of this guide, essentially. The Cambridge Audio Melomania P100, for example, are more detailed and offer twice the battery life, while also being less expensive. It's a cut-throat world of headphones.\nMeet the team\nOur team of reviewers has collectively amassed years of audio tech experience and testing, rigorously putting all of the latest and greatest headphones through their paces.\nMatt is TechRadar's Managing Editor for Entertainment.

There's a lot of jargon around headphones, so here's an explanation of all the key terms you'll need to know when buying headphones today.\nActive noise cancellation (ANC): A way of processing audio to counteract extraneous sounds around you and remove them from what you\u2019re hearing. Microphones on the outside of the headphones listen for ambient external sounds, then create an \u2018antiphase\u2019 (often called \u2018anti-noise\u2019) soundwave, which is mixed into your music to \u2018cancel out\u2019 the ambient noise. This means you can listen to music at lower volume levels, or can hear podcasts more clearly.\naptX: A higher-quality audio streaming system from compatible devices, that works over Bluetooth, but is capable of streaming higher-resolution files. There are multiple versions of aptX, but in new headphones you are mostly likely to see aptX Adaptive, which can work at different quality levels depending on connection strength. You may also see a reference to aptX Lossless, which is part of aptX Adaptive, and is the highest-quality connection the tech currently offers. There is also aptX Voice, which is designed to make your voice clearer on calls, and is also part of aptX Adaptive.\nAuracast: A new Bluetooth connection system, still in its early stages. It enables you to connect Auracast-ready headphones to any Auracast transmission source without needing to \u2018pair\u2019 your headphones in the usual Bluetooth method, meaning that you could connect to a TV in a bar to hear a sports game, or connect to your airport gate to hear announcements. It was developed for hearing-aid use, but will be supported by a large number of headphones due to its convenience.\n3.5mm jack: The classic wired connection for headphones \u2013 not all of today\u2019s wireless headphones support this, though, so we make sure to highlight it, for when only wired use will do.\nBluetooth: The technology that effectively all headphones rely on for a wireless connection. It is capable of supporting many different music streaming technologies, including aptX, LDAC and LHDC. The two standard and most common streaming technologies are called SBC and AAC, and are supported on the vast majority of earbuds. There are many different versions of Bluetooth, and higher versions enable newer features such as Bluetooth LE Audio or Auracast \u2013 however, supporting a new version of Bluetooth doesn\u2019t guarantee that these technologies are supported, so always check the specs. Bluetooth 5.4 is the latest version at the time of writing, though Bluetooth 5.3 is more common, and supports every major Bluetooth feature.\nBluetooth LE Audio: The next-gen version of Bluetooth\u2019s standard music streaming technology, which is technically called LC3. LC3 is capable of delivering higher-quality music than SBC or AAC while using less power \u2013 or much higher quality at the same level of power use. There are limited models that currently support LE Audio, and even fewer phones that support it. We hope that will change in the future.\nDolby Atmos: A spatial audio format used in both music and movies. Instead of music being encoded into \u2018channels\u2019, different parts of the audio are encoded as \u2018objects\u2019 that can be positioned in 3D space, meaning that they can be heard in specific and realistic positions.\nDrivers: The part of the headphones that make the sound \u2013 often called speakers. The type used on almost all headphones and earbuds are \u2018dynamic\u2019 drivers, which are the traditional cone-shaped speakers you see on loudspeakers, just smaller (usually between 5mm and 13mm on earbuds, and between 20mm and 50mm on headphones). However, some headphones use \u2018planar magnetic\u2019 drivers, which are more precise and favored by audiophiles, but are typically more expensive and harder to produce.\nEQ: This is the short term for \u2018equalizer\u2019, which is a way to adjust the sound balance of a pair of headphones, to enable you to increase or decrease the bass tones, mid-range and treble. Many wireless headphones these days come with an app that enables you to control the EQ, either by choosing presents for different genres (such as rock, classical or pop), or by giving you a series of sliders to adjust these frequencies yourself. EQs are split into \u2018bands\u2019, so a three-band EQ has three sliders: one for bass, one for mid, one for treble. A nine-band EQ has nine sliders, giving you finer control across the sound range.\nHi-Res Audio: High-resolution audio is music that has been digitally stored with much more information in the file than the more compressed versions you get if you use MP3 files, or stream from Spotify. We have a whole guide on what Hi-Res Audio is, but the idea is that you can hear more detail in your music, so they\u2019re closer to the original recordings. Hi-Res files also tend to offer more dynamic range, and expansiveness, so they sound more natural. This all depends on the headphones being good enough to express this extra quality level, of course \u2013 you will find that many headphones are \u2018Hi-Res Certified\u2019, but this is just on a technical level, not a quality level. Most of the best streaming services support some kind of Hi-Res Audio files now, though they\u2019re a lot larger than the lower-quality files we\u2019re used to before, so some services won\u2019t default to playing these files unless you\u2019re on a Wi-Fi network.\nIn-ear: This means that a pair of earbuds has tips that fit into your ear canal. You may see the term \u2018IEM\u2019 used, which means \u2018In-ear monitor\u2019 \u2013 this is a particular kind of in-ear bud favored by professionals, and it\u2019s often used even in consumer wired earbuds to say that a pair of earbuds is very high-quality and will have a very noise-isolating fit.\nFind My: Both Apple and Android phones have a system that enables them to find lost devices, and some headphones support this. On iPhones, it\u2019s simply called Find My. On Android, it\u2019s called Find My Device. Some headphones have a custom version of this feature based on their app, rather than the version built into the phone software. The built-in version is strongly preferable.\nHead tracking: On headphones that support spatial audio, head tracking is an additional piece of processing whereby the headphones can detect the movement of your head from the source device, and use it to make the 3D sound of Dolby Atmos or other spatial formats feel more true to life. It means that the sound you\u2019re listening to doesn\u2019t have to move with you when you move your head \u2013 it can sound more like you\u2019re sitting in a room of speakers, even when you\u2019re wearing headphones.\nLDAC: This is a higher-quality music streaming technology that works over Bluetooth, much like aptX. It was developed by Sony, and is heavily supported by the company\u2019s products, and support is possible on Android phones, and many of the best portable music players.\nLHDC: This is another higher-quality music streaming technology, and a rival to aptX and LDAC: It is also possible for Android phones to support it.\nLossless: Lossless music is essentially music that has been streamed/transmitted using technology that doesn\u2019t lose detail from the original file. The original files of a music recording are very large, and must be reduced for efficient streaming or download. MP3 is a \u2018lossy\u2019 technology, which means it removes information from the track in order to make it much smaller. Other file types, such as FLAC (used by Tidal) and ALAC (used by Apple Music) are lossless, which means that the files are larger than MP3, but they retain all the original audio information. Read more in our dedicated audio file format explainer.\nMulti-point Bluetooth: A newer Bluetooth feature that enables your headphones to be paired with two (or even three, in rare cases) devices at the same time, so you can switch between them instantly, without needing to disconnect and reconnect, or re-pair, your headphones each time.\nNoise isolation: This refers to the passive ability of a pair of headphones or earbuds to isolate you from ambient sounds, without using the processing of active noise cancellation. So it refers to the way that earbuds also act like earplugs to block outside sound, or the way that over-ear headphones provide a seal around your ears to do the same thing.\nOn-ear: An on-ear fit refers to headphones with a small earpad that sits directly on your auricle (the part of the ear that\u2019s outside the head). This tends to provide a less-perfect seal for noise isolation than over-ear headphones, and some find it less comfortable \u2013 but some prefer it.\nOver-ear: An over-ear fit means the earpads of the headphones are larger, and sit around your auricle, so your whole ear is encompassed within their seal. This is the fit of choice for the best noise-cancelling headphones, because it provides the best passive noise isolation, which they can then enhance with active noise cancellation.\nPlanar magnetic: This type of speaker driver can be more precise and dynamic than the dynamic drivers used in most headphones, and is a favorite of audiophiles. However, it\u2019s expensive and hard to power, meaning that headphones that use it tend to be heavy and pricey.\nSnapdragon Sound: This is a combination of wireless technologies designed to provide a better experience if you have both a phone and pair of headphones that support it. It combines the higher-quality streaming of aptX with other features designed to reduce the latency of the Bluetooth connection (ie, how long it takes to transmit the sound), to improve the quality of voice calls, and to improve the overall reliability of the connection. \u2018Snapdragon\u2019 is a series of chips made by Qualcomm, and are used in many Android phones. Read more in our in-depth Snapdragon Sound explainer.\nSpatial audio: A generic term used to describe various types of 3D sound technologies used in headphones. Apple uses it to refer to its own particular mix of Dolby Atmos support with head tracking. Other brands may use it for equivalent features, but there\u2019s no rule as to exactly what it means, other than that the idea is to make the sound feel like it\u2019s coming from all around you, not right in your ears \u2013 think Dirac Virtuo, DTS:X, THX and of course Dolby Atmos. It\u2019s especially good with movies, where it can recreate the home theater experience in headphones.\nTransparency mode: A variation of active noise cancellation. Instead of blocking the outside noise, the processing actually mixes ambient noise into your music intelligently, so you can hear what\u2019s going on around you without overwhelming your music. That way, you can hear a train announcement, have a conversation, or be aware of traffic. Different manufacturers call this mode different things \u2013 it may be something like \u2018Aware mode\u2019, \u201cHearThru\u2019 or \u2018Ambient mode\u2019. We tend to call it \u2018Transparency mode\u2019 as a rule, to make it easy to compare products in our guide.\nUSB-C Audio: Some headphones offer the ability to play digital audio from a computer or phone when connected by a USB-C cable, and the advantage of this is that it can support extremely high-quality resolution tracks \u2013 far beyond what any version of Bluetooth currently supports. For audiophiles, a pair of headphones that can do both wireless for convenience and USB-C Audio for wired Hi-Res Audio playback, can be preferential.\nWhat different types of headphones are there?\nThere's a lot to consider when you're buying a new pair of headphones. But the most important is the design. This doesn't just dictate how they look, but the features on offer, how they feel when you wear them and how you'll use them day-to-day.\nWe've founds on over-ear headphones here, though we have separate guides to just the best wireless headphones of the on-head style, or the best wireless earbuds, if you want a smaller form factor.\nIn-ear headphones, also called earbuds or earphones, are usually the cheapest and easiest way to pump audio into your ears. They rest in or just outside the ear canal, creating a tight seal to keep air out and sound in. These are the most discreet designs you'll find, making them excellent for portability and the prime choice for athletes.\nOver-ear headphones generally provide fantastic richness and depth of sound, which allows listeners to pick apart the instruments and sounds much easier. Additionally, over-ear, or circumaural headphones, go around the ear and offer a generous amount of padding.\nInstead of enveloping your ears, on-ear headphones create a light, breathable seal around your ear. The noise isolation is less effective than in-ear or over-ear options.\nSome headphones don't go anywhere near your ears at all. Bone-conducting headphones send vibrations through your cheekbones and jaw up towards your inner ear, leaving your ears free. These headphones make great running headphones and swimming headphones.\nWith wireless on-ear headphones and over-ear headphones, you simply lose the wire connecting them to your device \u2013 otherwise, they look pretty much the same as your regular pair of wired cans, and give you the noise-isolating prowess of over-ears without the need for cumbersome wires to connect to your device.\nTrue wireless earbuds have no cord whatsoever. For some, this means true freedom; for others, untethered true wireless means constant danger of losing their expensive audio kit down the drain \u2013 or terrible connections. The latter, at least, has changed now \u2013 thanks to advances in Bluetooth technology like aptX HD, the best true wireless earbuds have never sounded better.\nFor more information about how to choose your next headphones, read our comprehensive guide, which goes into this in more detail. We also have other guides for getting the most out of your headphones, including how to care for them \u2013 be sure to check out our how to clean your wireless earbuds walkthrough to make sure they're spick and span.\nAre noise-cancelling headphones bad for your ears?\nNope! In fact, some people choose them because they can help to protect your hearing over time. Active noise cancellation uses something called \"anti-noise\" to help block outside sounds \u2013 essentially, they use microphones on the outside to listen to the world around you, then calculate the opposite of those noise frequencies, and pump those into their sound to \"cancel\" out the sounds around you. This is makes it easier to hear what your headphones are playing \u2013 and that means you don't have to turn the volume up as loud. This is how they can protect your hearing long term: listening to loud headphones all the time is a serious issue for people who've been doing it for years, and with ANC headphones, you can keep it lower.\nWhat headphones brands are the best quality?\nBose and Sony have very high reputations, and for good reason. They both make very high-performance products for the price, with good build quality even with plastic construction (which has the advantage of being lightweight and comfortable).\nBeats is obviously a famous brand, and its products are very well-made, and the sound is strong these days. Apple's headphones are much-loved, especially AirPods Pro 2, which are extremely high quality and well-priced compared to other premium earbuds.\nAt the higher end, Bowers and Wilkins makes fantastic headphones with premium materials, as does Sennheiser (which also makes some good affordable products).\nFor cheaper products, we rate 1More, JBL, Anker Soundcore and JLab all highly \u2013 all these products feel well-made, but tend to be ad the affordable end of the market.\nHow we test the best headphones\n\u2611\ufe0f More than 2,400 audio product reviews\n\u2611\ufe0f 16 years of product testing\n\u2611\ufe0f Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\n\u2611\ufe0f Nearly 200,000 hours testing tech\nWhen it comes to the best headphones, we focus on sound quality above everything else. We look at both wired and wireless cans and earbuds that would appeal to audiophiles, as well as those working in professional roles. However, we also appreciate that budget is important too, so we compare like for like, picking out budget headphones that perform admirably for the price.\nWe also look at other features such as ANC, battery life, fit, and of course the usability and extra perks offered by any companion apps. Of course, design and whether they look (and feel) good all adds to the model's desirability \u2013 and this is noted as we listen to music across a wide range of genres over several days.\nWe have tested all of the headphones in this guide extensively, spending plenty of time analyzing the sound, fit, design, specs, and value for money so that you will be able to choose a product you'll be over the moon with. Although this guide focuses specifically on headphones that fit over or on your ears, you can also read about how we test earbuds too, which should give you even more of an insight into our process.\nWhile there are many different factors that go into testing headphones, we make sure to use a variety of sources to give as much variety as possible. These range from using various Bluetooth codecs and Wi-Fi to listen to different music steaming services, DACs, portable digital audio players and more.\nLatest updates to this best headphones guide\nAugust 7, 2025\nEdited the introduction.
