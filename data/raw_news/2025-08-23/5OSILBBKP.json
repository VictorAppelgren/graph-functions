  "title": "Why my next EV will be a 'software-defined' vehicle - and what that means for you",
  "description": "In practice, it could be a lofty ambition more than something automakers can attain anytime soon.",
  "content": "The auto industry is changing dramatically. I'm sure I don't need to tell you that, but there's more going on than the transition to electric vehicles. Or rather, because of that transition, automakers have been rethinking many aspects of how a car should function. Some cars now have cockpit-style heads-up displays, for instance, or all-LCD instrument clusters. You may be able to unlock and start your car simply by carrying your phone with you, and the holy grail is a fully self-driving product -- one that doesn't gnarl up Austin traffic, that is. We're not there yet, despite Elon Musk's wild plans for the Robotaxi.\n\nIf you've been following auto evolution, you've probably seen the term \"software-defined vehicle\" pop up at some point. But what does that term mean? Can you buy one today? All I know for sure is that by the time I buy my next EV, it's likely to fall into that category by someone's definition. The same may be true for you, as well.\n\nBrace yourself for more subscriptions\n\nIf you take the term literally, you might be thinking that software-defined vehicles (SDVs) have been around since the 1990s, if not earlier. There is, after all, software required for any chip running under the hood or in your dash display. Certainly it feels a little absurd to exclude more recent cars with touchscreen controls and support for Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.\n\nWhat automakers really mean, however, is a vehicle that can be fundamentally altered via software updates, instead of necessarily having to swap parts out. The concept is sometimes likened to a smartphone on wheels. Yes, my iPhone 16 Pro is inherently faster than an iPhone 13 Pro Max, and equipped with better cameras -- but if you update the older phone from iOS 15 to iOS 26, it's still going to gain much of the same functionality.\n\nThere are a variety of potential benefits to SDVs. For drivers, their cars might not only feel \"fresher\" for longer, but genuinely better than when they first got them. For automakers, it's a value-add that can keep products relevant without having to overhaul design and production. It can even alter performance, for instance enhancing battery management, or how well self-driving modes deal with complex situations. As a fun sidebar, there's a similar thing at play with PEVs like electric unicycles -- a single firmware update can radically alter how a wheel feels under your feet.\n\nCynically, SDVs may open up opportunities for automakers to exercise more control, possibly with additional subscription fees in mind. Imagine more subscriptions like Rivian's Connect+, which covers not just a cellular connection, but features you might assume would be free -- like \"priority\" software updates and Google Cast support.\n\nCan you buy a software-defined vehicle right now?\n\nSort of. Arguably, the company that pioneered the concept was Tesla, which has long relied on proprietary software, over-the-air software updates, and giant touchscreens that replace many gauges, knobs, and dials. Tesla owners are used to the functionality of their cars evolving over time, if occasionally marred by glitches.\n\nOther automakers have since gone down the same path, most notably Rivian. Just recently, in fact, that company replaced its own navigation solution with Google Maps, solving long-standing complaints from customers. And you don't need to own a Gen 2 vehicle to get the app -- a 2022 R1T Gen 1 can run the software too.\n\nThat said, even Teslas and Rivians don't meet the definition of an SDV by some standards. They don't have app stores, and later iterations have dramatic hardware-only upgrades. The R1T Gen 2, for example, adds things like a heat pump, a better regen braking system, and different motor configurations. The Gen 1 continues to be a fine truck, but there's no denying that a newcomer is going to have a better experience. Personally, I think it's unreasonable to expect hardware upgrades to slow down anytime soon.\n\nSoftware can be as much an obstacle as it is a solution, at the moment. Cars have to be engineered with SDV adaptability in mind, and if you want a smartphone-like experience, you have to design, code, and test a smartphone-like operating system, which means hiring a large software team. You can't even rely (completely) on platforms like CarPlay Ultra or Android Automotive, since those don't get close to the metal -- the most they can do is toggle things like the radio and air conditioning. CarPlay Ultra won't work at all without an iPhone present.\n\nThen there's the matter of fragmentation. As of early 2024, there were 15 different automotive operating systems on the market, and there are probably even more today. It's impractical for all but the largest app developers to support that many platforms, so it's no wonder some cars have conspicuous gaps in their preloaded app catalogs.\n\nWorse, an SDV is liable to be more expensive, reducing its appeal to shoppers. The biggest cost is an all-electric powertrain, naturally, but that can be amplified by things like dash-spanning LCD panels, and building as many components to be software-linked as possible. If only a minority of people are buying SDVs (or SDV-likes), there's less incentive to churn them out, creating a Catch-22 -- ramping up production would force prices down.\n\nTesla-style SDVs do seem poised to become commonplace in the long run, given their profit potential if nothing else. The real question may be how quickly car buyers will get onboard, considering not just the inherent costs, but the Trump administration's tariff war, and growing subscription burnout. I dislike being nickel-and-dimed for cloud storage, much less the prospect of updating my car. I'd rather go back to putting my phone in a window mount.",

      "text": "Summary\n- Most cars with Apple Wallet keys are made by BMW, but other compatible brands include Hyundai, Kia, Ram, BYD, and Volvo.\n- You'll want to doublecheck compatibility for any particular model and trim, especially since only some models support features like passive entry.\n- At WWDC 2025, Apple announced that brands like Acura, Chevy, Cadillac, GMC, Lucid, Porsche and Rivian will be adding support in the near future.\nThis marks my age, but I remember that as a kid, it was legitimately novel when cars started getting remotes to unlock them instead of manual keys. It felt like a luxury. In fact, by some fluke, I never got a remote-unlock car of my own until my 30s. It wasn't a huge selling point for me, I suppose, even in a used car.\nFast-forward to today, and I'd automatically prefer a vehicle I can unlock with my iPhone or Apple Watch. That's most definitely a luxury, but it also has some practical value -- say if I forget my real keys, or my hands are full enough that it would be easier to use my wrist. You do have to hunt down vehicles with Apple Wallet support, unfortunately, and not all of them support the same functionality. I'll explain a bit more about how things work before I get into the proper list, which is ever-changing -- if a new vehicle has been announced, you may need to check directly with a manufacturer to verify support. Even Apple's official data seems to lag slightly.\n5 driving tips I use for getting the most range out of an EV\nMany of the principles of driving a gas car apply to gaining miles on your EV.\nHow do Apple car keys work?\nThe varying levels of functionality\nAll Apple car keys let you use an iPhone or Apple Watch to unlock a car. Some will also let you start it, and control other features, but that's up to what an automaker allows. By default, keys also take advantage of Express Mode, bypassing the need to unlock your iPhone first using Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode. Be careful about letting your iPhone out of your sight, in other words.\nKeys are initially added to the Wallet app on your iPhone, but should automatically sync to a paired Apple Watch if you have one. Follow an automaker's app, email, or SMS instructions when it comes to creating a key. After that, if a key isn't automatically synced to your Apple Watch, just open the Watch app, go to Wallet & Apple Pay, and tap the Add button next to the key. You can remove a key from your devices at any time -- just remember that if you do that, get a new iPhone, or reset your current iPhone, you'll need to go through the whole setup process again.\nShare keys with others by selecting them in the Wallet app and tapping the Share button. As needed you can adjust permissions, and require an activation code if a car doesn't demand its own Vehicle Code. Note that to complete the sharing process, some cars may require a key fob or a device that already has an Apple car key. Don't assume you can send a key to your partner or child remotely.\nApple's tech relies on a mix of wireless standards: NFC, UWB ( ultra-wideband), and Bluetooth. These enable three different forms of access:\n- Passive entry: Supported only when a car offers UWB as well, this helps unlock, start, and/or lock a car simply through proximity detection. Apple's system is smart enough to recognize context -- it'll lock when you walk away, for example.\n- Proximity: More commonly, you can bring your Apple device next to an NFC reader to toggle a lock and/or the ignition. In the case of the ignition, you'll have to hit your car's start button at the same time.\n- Remote: Within Bluetooth range, you can use an iPhone to lock/unlock a car and control various other features. Some vehicles may let you start them remotely, which is a boon in cold weather as long as your car isn't on the opposite side of a parking lot.\nEverything you need to know about PEVs, or personal electric vehicles\nYou can use PEVs to explore, run errands, or speed up your commute.\nWhich cars support wireless keys in Apple Wallet?\nMany options, but conspicuous gaps\nThere's good news and bad news here. The good news is that the list of compatible vehicles is growing. The bad news is that many brands aren't onboard yet, even if they support CarPlay, and Apple's database doesn't identify which keys support remote or passive entry features. That's something you'll have to verify directly with an automaker on a model-by-model or even trim-by-trim basis. Some companies withhold their better tech features for more expensive trims.\nHere's the official list as of late July 2025, with confirmed model years. As a rule, you can usually assume that support will continue into new model years, but doublecheck that before signing anything at a dealership.\nBMW\n- 1 Series (2021 to 2024)\n- 2 Series (2021 to 2024)\n- 3 Series (2021 to 2024)\n- 4 Series (2021 to 2024)\n- 5 Series (2021 to 2024)\n- 6 Series (2021 to 2024)\n- 8 Series (2021 to 2024)\n- X5/X5 M (2021 to 2024)\n- X6/X6 M (2021 to 2024)\n- X7 (2021 to 2024)\n- Z4 (2021 to 2024)\n- i4 (2022 to 2024)\n- iX (2022 to 2024)\n- iX1 (2022 to 2024)\n- iX3 (2022 to 2024)\n- i3 (2023)\n- i5 (2024)\n- i7 (2023 to 2024)\nBYD\n- Han (2022 to 2024)\nGenesis\n- GV60 (2023 to 2024)\n- G90 (2023 to 2024)\n- G70 (2024)\nHyundai\n- Palisade (2023 to 2024)\n- Ioniq 6 (2023 to 2024)\nKia\n- Telluride (2023 to 2024)\n- Niro (2023 to 2024)\n- Seltos (2024)\n- EV9 (2024)\nLotus\n- Eletre (2024)\n- Emeya (2024)\nMercedes-Benz\n- E-Class (2024)\nRam\n- Ram 1500 (2025)\nWhy don't more cars support Apple Wallet?\nMore brands are coming soon\nThere's no one-size-fits-all explanation, but there are barriers to adopting Apple's car key technology. For one, it won't work unless a vehicle has NFC readers installed, and UWB radios are needed to enable passive entry. Either adds to the cost of designing and manufacturing a vehicle, and some automakers might not consider it worth it for the amount of buyers it attracts. Typically, CarPlay is more important to the average shopper.\nBeyond that, there's a cost to developing and supporting digital car keys. While Apple doesn't charge a licensing fee as far I can tell, automakers still need to code compatibility into their software, test it, then offer support to customers. And if a company backs Apple devices, it's likely to support Android keys as well.\nThe tech does seem to be gaining traction, nevertheless. At its 2025 Worldwide Developer Conference, Apple announced that more brands will be coming soon -- in fact, Volvo should already be onboard. Here are the others:\n- Acura\n- Chevrolet\n- Cadillac\n- GMC\n- Porsche\n- Rivian\n- Smart\n- Lucid\n- Tata\n- Hongqi\n- WEY\n- Chery\n- Voyah\nYou might be waiting a while for a 600-mile EV\nEVs are poised to eclipse the range of gas vehicles, but the most you can do right now is save your pennies."

      "text": "Summary\n- Used electric vehicles depreciate rapidly, making nearly-new, reliable options under $30,000 accessible.\n- Reliable used EVs are available with only one recall and a low average used price of $13,859.\n- There are a wide variety of used EVs, from long-range to performance models.\nThe idea of buying an electric vehicle is alluring. EVs are packed with cool technology, and the lack of an internal combustion engine means there is less maintenance required, keeping ownership costs low in comparison to gas vehicles. However, the initial purchase can be expensive. Thankfully, for used car buyers, electric vehicles depreciate rapidly, so it's easy to find a nearly-new and reliable electric car under $30,000.\nMany buyers worry about battery degradation when buying a used electric vehicle, but new EVs face faulty batteries, too. For the most part, batteries can last years before needing replacement, and lightly-used ones might still have warranty cover for peace of mind. Plus, the charging network has improved over the last few years, meaning unreliable chargers are less of a problem.\nIn compiling this article, we have cross-referenced information on vehicle reliability from J.D. Power, maintenance from Edmunds, RepairPal and CarEdge, and pricing from Kelley Blue Book, to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible. Please note that we have ranked the following models based on most reliable to least reliable.\n10 2023 Polestar 2\nReliability Score: 64/100\nThe first entry on our list is the 2023 Polestar 2. While a score of 64 doesn't seem reliable, this is a massive improvement on the previous model year, which was rated at 58. Polestar was the performance arm of Volvo before branching out to be an independent electric vehicle producer with the Polestar 1. It flopped, but the 2 was in-line with other EVs of the time, and the 2023 facelift added more range and features.\nReliability\nPart of the refresh included a new Smartzone packed with advanced safety technology, helping the Polestar 2 gain a five-star safety rating from NHTSA. Plus, only two recalls have been issued. One related to incorrect installation of the front ball joint, and the rearview camera not displaying.\n- Safety Rating: 5/5\n- Total Recalls: 2\n- Average Used Price: $25,262\n9 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E\nReliability Score: 65/100\nWhether you agree with an electric SUV wearing a Mustang badge or not, the Mach-E is a performance car with better efficiency. Though it is a high-sided vehicle with five doors, the main purpose of this car was to make electric cars cool. While it looks great, it's nothing like a Mustang -- its skinny tires and average suspension make it a bit bland.\nReliability\nDespite never being tested by NHTSA, the Mach-E was a Top Safety Pick in 2021 by IIHS. There are also eight recalls for various reasons that could lead to serious accidents or fires. It is still rated more reliable than the Polestar.\n- Safety Rating: N/A\n- Total Recalls: 8\n- Average Used Price: $24,366\n8 2023 Hyundai Ioniq 5\nReliability Score: 70/100\nThe Hyundai Ioniq 5 is perfect for tech-savvy families. Technically, it is an SUV. The spacious cabin is SUV-size, but it drives like a hatchback. The Ioniq 5 follows the unique design language the Korean automaker is known for. The square headlights are both retro and futuristic at the same time, while the clutter-free interior provides a calm driving experience. Two large digital displays sit atop the dashboard to bring important information and functions to the forefront for ease of use.\nReliability\nSimilar to other vehicles from Hyundai and Kia, the Ioniq 5 has an excellent reliability rating. So far, there have been three recalls concerning loss of drive power from a damaged charging unit, but once that's fixed, it should be worry-free ownership. You can rest assured with a five-star safety rating.\n- Safety Rating: 5/5\n- Total Recalls: 3\n- Average Used Price: $24,993\n5 electric car myths you've probably heard, debunked\nWe're debunking the five most commonly heard myths about electric vehicles.\n7 2022 Tesla Model Y\nReliability Score: 73/100\nWe couldn't write a list of electric vehicles without a Tesla. Since the Tesla Model Y lost $39,387 in three years, it has become a used car bargain at just $27,406. For this, you'll get a premium SUV insulated with acoustic glass for a quiet ride, and Tesla Autopilot self-driving for effortless long-distance trips. When it's time to recharge, the Model Y can access the supercharger network to charge up to 80% in as little as 15 minutes.\nReliability\nTo address the elephant in the room, the Model Y already has 18 outstanding recalls, ranging from an inconsistent tire pressure monitor light, to software updates to make self-driving safer. However, it still has a five-star safety rating, and a strong reliability score. These recalls might be a nuisance, but they don't necessarily make the Model Y less reliable.\n- Safety Rating: 5/5\n- Total Recalls: 18\n- Average Used Price: $27,406\n6 2023 Nissan Ariya\nReliability Score: 74/100\nAnother electric SUV with a roomy cabin and cool technology is the 2023 Nissan Ariya. It's well-equipped with useful features, like a 360-degree camera to help with parking and ProPilot advanced driver assistance system. Focusing on efficiency, the Ariya has a smooth exterior design brought to life by luxurious colors, like Akatsuki Copper. The interior is similar to the Hyundai Ioniq 5, with a minimalist touch and two digital displays controlling most functions, but it has less cargo space than its competitors.\nReliability\nA selling point of the Ariya is its safety and reliability. Scoring more than the Model Y, and with significantly fewer recalls, the Japanese EV hit the ground running. Three of the recalls relate to loss of drive power, with the other warning that the steering wheel might detach from the steering column. Obviously, those are both serious, so ensure these have been resolved before purchasing.\n- Safety Rating: 5/5\n- Total Recalls: 4\n- Average Used Price: $24,375\n5 2023 Nissan Leaf\nReliability Score: 76/100\nPerhaps the Ariya's reliability is tempting, but you don't need an SUV. Well, the Nissan Leaf is even better. The Leaf has been around a while now, providing an affordable entry barrier to electrified driving. A Nissan Leaf S with great standard features, like an HVAC timer and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, can be bought for $15,133. A few extra bucks upgrades to the SV grade, adding leather seats, LED lights, and a premium sound system.\nReliability\nBuilding on the Leaf's value is a five-star safety rating and only three recalls. One is regarding misinformation in the owner's manual, and the others are about brake line corrosion and unintended acceleration. Overall, it's a brilliant electric car for drivers on a budget.\n- Safety Rating: 5/5\n- Total Recalls: 3\n- Average Used Price: $15,133\nDo you prefer CarPlay, Android Auto, or bespoke in-car infotainment\nThere was a time when I loved Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, but the issues I have encountered with my Ioniq 5's USB port, leading to both platforms constantly disconnecting (I pretty much don't use either anymore), have led me to change my opinion. I've talked to both Hyundai and Apple, and both companies blame the issue on each other. I've also gotten the USB and transmitter unit replaced in my car, but nothing solves the issue. While I appreciate instantly having access to my iPhone or Android device in my car simply by plugging in my phone (my vehicle doesn't have wireless CarPlay/Android Auto) and the advantages both operating systems provide, problems I've encountered have me thinking that Tesla-like car manufacturer maker-made infotainment systems may be the more reliable way forward. After all, I really only take calls, navigate with Google Maps/Waze, and listen to music on Spotify in my car -- I don't really need many other apps. With this in mind, do you prefer CarPlay or\n4 2023 Chevrolet Bolt EV\nReliability Score: 77/100\nSimilar to the Leaf, the Nissan Bolt is a small electric vehicle ideal for buzzing around the city. Again, it's a low-cost EV, so it isn't exciting, but the whole idea behind the Bolt was to bring affordable options to the market. The ride can be uncomfortable on bigger wheels, but adaptive cruise control, rain-sensing wipers and auto-dimming headlights make driving a breeze. Plus, it can travel up to 259 miles on a single charge, and used models come in around $18,845.\nReliability\nAstoundingly, the Bolt EV has never been recalled. We probably don't need to say much else about its reliability, but highlighting its top safety rating and high score seems right.\n- Safety Rating: 5/5\n- Total Recalls: 0\n- Average Used Price: $18,845\n3 2022 Kia EV6\nReliability Score: 77/100\nKia's EV6 is a mighty electric SUV that appeals to many due to its sharp exterior styling. While most EVs are flat in favor of efficiency, the EV6 has big alloys, two spoilers, and a pronounced rear light bar spanning from wheel to wheel. Available with long-range or GT trims, there's an EV6 to suit every type of driver.\nthe EV6 is a fantastic all-round EV for the money.\nReliability\nThere is no official safety rating for the EV6 because rollover resistance hasn't been tested yet. However, it received five starts in all other tests so far. What's more, only three recalls have been issued, suffering the same damaged charging unit power loss as the Hyundai Ioniq 5. Nonetheless, the EV6 is a fantastic all-round EV for the money.\n- Safety Rating: N/A\n- Total Recalls: 3\n- Average Used Price: $21,612\nKia EVs are joining the ranks supporting Tesla Superchargers\nYou'll probably need to spring for an NACS adapter.\n2 2023 Chevrolet Bolt EUV\nReliability Score: 79/100\nIn essence, the Bolt EUV is an inflated version of the Bolt hatchback. Sacrificing a bit of the EVs battery range allows more room for passengers and cargo, and it is available with Super Cruise hands-free driving. The Bolt EUV looks as good, if not better, than more expensive electric SUVs. Standard features include keyless entry and start, wireless Apple CarPlay/Android auto, and LED lights.\nReliability\nSharing DNA with the Bolt hatchback means the EUV is just as competent. There are no recalls issued for it, and it also has a five-star safety rating. Additionally, it seems to depreciate slower than other EVs, so it seems like a solid investment.\n- Safety Rating: 5/5\n- Total Recalls: 0\n- Average Used Price: $20,822\n1 2019 Hyundai Ioniq Electric\nReliability Score: 82/100\nTopping our list as the most reliable electric vehicle is the 2019 Hyundai Ioniq. The Ioniq electric was discontinued in 2021 to update the range with Ioniq 5 and 6, but it's still worth buying. Its subtle styling blends in with internal combustion cars, with a conservative interior made of eco-friendly materials. It shows no signs of age, using modern features like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\nHyundai Ioniq Electric Performance Specifications\n|\nPowertrain |\nSingle electric motor |\n|\nTransmission |\nSingle-speed automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n118 hp |\n|\nTorque |\n281 lb-ft |\n|\nDriveline |\nFront-wheel drive |\nReliability\nThroughout its life, the 2019 Ioniq electric was only recalled once for unintended acceleration after releasing the pedal. This recall was issued in 2021, so most should be fixed by now, but you should always check. Otherwise, a score of 82/100 suggests it doesn't require much maintenance or repairs.\n- Safety Rating: N/A\n- Total Recalls: 1\n- Average Used Price: $13,859"

      "text": "Summary\n- iOS 26 offers several new features exclusive to owners of the iPhone 15 Pro or later, all tied to AI.\n- Visual Intelligence can now be used on screenshots, for instance, mimicking Google's Circle to Search.\n- The Phone, FaceTime, and Messages apps support live translation, though only to and from a limited number of languages.\nI didn't buy my iPhone 16 Pro last year with future versions of iOS in mind -- mainly I was concerned with the aging battery in my iPhone 13, and upgrading to better cameras and display tech. But one of the benefits of upgrading any smartphone is continued access to new software, and with iOS 26, there's a growing list of features that will only work if you own an iPhone 15 Pro or later. That's the cutoff for Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI tools that's been controversial so far -- mostly because Apple has delayed promised features, like contextual awareness for Siri.\nIn the interim, there are several iOS 26 features that should make owners of newer iPhones happy. Some are relatively niche, but the ones I'm going to get into today could make a meaningful difference to you, depending on what your day-to-day existence looks like.\nApple iPhone 16 Pro\n- Brand\n- Apple\n- SoC\n- A18 Pro (3nm)\n- Display\n- 6.3-inch 1,206 x 2,622 pixel resolution 120Hz LTPO Super Retina XDR OLED, 120Hz, HDR10, Dolby Vision, 1000 nits (typical), 2000 nits (peak)\n- Storage\n- 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB\n4 missing features I can't believe the iPad still doesn't have\nApple is making a real leap forward with iPadOS 26, but many of us still have a wishlist.\n1 Visual Intelligence for screenshots\nSearch for anything, anytime\nEffectively, this is Apple's answer to Google's Circle to Search for Android. When it premiered in iOS 18.2, Visual Intelligence was limited to whatever you could point your camera at, which was only occasionally useful. With iOS 26, it becomes an option whenever you take a screenshot, too -- you can ask ChatGPT questions about what you're seeing, and search on supported apps such as Google, Etsy, and Pinterest. If an image contains an obvious event such as a concert, the feature can detect it and suggest adding the day, time, and/or location to a Calendar entry. Expect to see a lot more flyers in your messages once iOS 26 becomes widespread.\nThis is Apple's answer to Google's Circle to Search for Android.\nVisual Intelligence isn't quite as convenient as Circle to Search, which can be triggered by long-pressing Android's navigation handle at any time. But both tools let you trace specific objects to search, so the comparison is pretty apt.\nWhat is Google Circle to Search and how does it work on Android?\nGoogle's latest AI feature is coming to the Pixel 8 and Galaxy S24. Here's everything you need to know.\n2 Live Translation in first-party communications apps\nLet's hope it catches the subtleties\nIn another bid to catch up with Google, iOS 26 adds automatic translation to the Phone, FaceTime, and Messages apps. It was pretty impressive during Apple's WWDC 2025 keynote, though the company used pre-recorded (and presumably scripted) demonstrations. I'm curious to see how well it works in real-world conditions -- translation apps often miss the nuances of context, like idioms. The results could be particularly entertaining in Quebec, where a lot of swear words are based on French Catholicism.\nSpeaking of which, language support is relatively limited to start with. The Messages app supports English, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese. The Phone and FaceTime apps work with English, French, German, Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese, but only in one-on-one conversations. Even within these barriers, many dialects are being omitted -- there's no Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois French or Mexican Spanish, for instance.\nHow to translate live conversations with Google Translate\nWith Google Translate, you have a translator in your pocket. You can translate and transcribe live audio -- including conversations -- in real time.\n3 Automatic order tracking in Apple Wallet\nNo more need for outside tools?\nApple has actually had an order tracking system in the iOS Wallet app for a few years, but until now, it required active participation on the part of merchants. This wasn't very appealing to companies with their own tracking systems, or anyone preferring a platform-neutral option. Often, when I'm tracking packages, I'll just use Shopify's Shop app -- I don't have to worry about being on an Apple device just to find out how close a package is.\nTo simplify things, iOS 26 automatically scans for tracking details in your email threads. That, of course, may be a limitation in its own right, if it's limited to the Apple Mail app and doesn't support the likes of Outlook or Gmail. But who knows -- for people with frequent deliveries, this could be an incentive to switch email clients.\nHow safe is Apple Pay really?\nAs a rule, any security threats are indirect rather than via Apple Pay itself.\n4 Automatic Reminders suggestions and sorting\nRemembering the things you forgot to remember\nI've never had a huge need for to-do apps, since normally, anything that's truly important to me has to be done right away or is impossible to forget. But even I make use of the iOS Reminders app occasionally, and some people seem to live and die by it. I get it, since it offloads some of the burden of remembering what your job, friends, and family need from you.\niOS 26 scans your email and Messages conversations for tasks you might want to add to Reminders, including items you can add to a grocery shopping list. To organize things further, associated reminders are automatically sorted into sections within each list. I imagine both of these things are going to be extremely useful for Reminders diehards, since we're often bombarded with a flood of communications every day. It's easy to forget that you need to call someone back when you're already late picking up your child from school.\n4 ways iPadOS 26 is finally making the iPad more like the Mac\nThe leap isn't complete, but iPads are a lot closer to becoming true laptop replacements.\n5 Apple Intelligence in Shortcuts\nAn undiscovered country\nThe Shortcuts app may be the most underappreciated part of iOS. I don't use it as much as I used to, but if you're patient, you can build some pretty elaborate automations to simplify tasks -- my \"I'm driving home\" routine is capable of texting my wife, getting Apple Maps directions, and loading an Apple Music playlist all through a single voice command. Chances are, if it's baked into iOS, there's a way of automating it via Shortcuts.\nI'm interested in this not so much for what's possible now, but rather what's coming once Apple delivers on its original AI promises.\nThe iOS 26 version of the app enables Apple Intelligence actions, such as image generation or text summaries. In fact, I'm interested in this not so much for what's possible now, but rather what's coming once Apple delivers on its original AI promises.\nI'd love to have a shortcut that automatically shuffles a specific Spotify playlist when it can tell I'm headed out on a group ride with my electric unicycle, for instance. The possibilities may be vast, even overwhelming for the average person -- it's a good thing people are sharing shortcut ideas online.\nEverything you need to know about PEVs, or personal electric vehicles\nYou can use PEVs like e-bikes and scooters to explore, run errands, or speed up your commute."

      "text": "Summary\n- Tesla plans to launch a small robotaxi fleet in Austin by the end of June or July.\n- Many Austinites are likely to boycott the taxis, given their association with Trump ally Elon Musk. People are already protesting at showrooms.\n- Tesla additionally faces an established rival -- Alphabet's Waymo -- and the difficulties of navigating Austin's terrain with its Full Self-Driving system.\nTesla is working furiously to join the robotaxi market, and to no one's surprise, the initial launch venue is slated to be Austin, Texas -- home to the company's global HQ. Talks with the City of Austin have been underway for months, and the automaker is planning to deploy a small fleet of Model Ys by the end of June or July, according to CEO Elon Musk. Its Full Self-Driving (FSD) platform has also been mounting improvements.\nHere's the thing, though -- while I'm currently in Edmonton, I spent over a decade living in Austin, complete with a Texan wife and child to prove it. Knowing the city, I have serious doubts about whether Tesla's robotaxis will gain any traction there, and not just because of FSD's spotty track record.\nEverything you need to know about PEVs, or personal electric vehicles\nYou can use PEVs to explore, run errands, or speed up your commute.\nThe unpopularity contest\nMisjudging your audience\nWhile it makes sense to launch in Austin from a logistical perspective, the reality is that Elon Musk is deeply unpopular with a lot of locals, given his right-wing politics. Austin is a famously liberal city, thanks in part to institutions like its music scene and the University of Texas at Austin. There's a notable LGBTQ+ district on 4th Street, and one of its best-known events is Eeyore's Birthday, a free festival full of things like drum circles and wild costumes. There are conservative Austinites -- particularly in the Republican-dominated Capitol building -- but in the 2024 Presidential elections, over 68% of Travis County voted for Kamala Harris.\nI'm expecting a lot of Austinites to not only ignore a Tesla robotaxi service, but actively boycott it.\nMany locals are employed by Tesla, to be sure, but even some of them dislike their controversial boss. And the Tesla showroom in The Domain has been the site of multiple protests attacking Musk's association with US President Donald Trump, not to mention other figures in the far-right.\nI'm expecting a lot of Austinites to not only ignore a Tesla robotaxi service, but actively boycott it. Groups may expand the current protests, and there's even the risk of vandalism and sabotage, given other well-publicized incidents around the US. Until Musk is forced out of Tesla -- assuming that ever happens -- there's a distinct possibility that the only customers using his robotaxis will be tourists, Republicans, and apolitical types.\nI'm eagerly awaiting the death of the sedan\nDeep into the 21st century, it's a format that doesn't really make sense anymore.\nFacing the competition (and the city)\nPenned in by Alphabet and MoPac\nEven if Austin were as solidly Republican as Galveston, Tesla would still be facing another major obstacle: Waymo. Alphabet's robotaxi service has been fully operational in Austin (through Uber) since March 2025, and was operating in other cities prior to that. It's not only firmly established in city limits, but in the robotaxi industry in general, with a commanding lead over other US rivals like Zoox.\nTesla does have an advantage in that it's been able to test FSD in a wide range of conditions, thanks to a mix of its own data and that from private car owners. It remains to be seen, however, if that will translate into the robotaxi world, much less beat Waymo's own track record. Tesla has been conducting some advance testing on Austin streets, so it's at least aware that it can't hit the ground running.\nI'm not even confident Tesla's FSD tech will be able to tackle Austin terrain (reliably).\nOn top that, Austin itself is liable to be an obstacle. There's a reason Waymo only operates in a small area from Parker Lane in the south to Hyde Park in the north -- getting anywhere else is complicated without taking highways like MoPac (Loop 1), I35, and 183, and robotaxi services generally avoid highways in light of the risks involved. Tesla will probably have to operate under the same conditions, intensifying its competition with Waymo and limiting how many passengers it can attract. Huge suburban areas like Round Rock and Pflugerville (both of which I've lived in) will be out of reach, and major corporate offices belonging to Apple and Dell will be inaccessible.\nI'm not even confident Tesla's FSD tech will be able to tackle Austin terrain (reliably). Having driven those streets myself, I know that there are plenty of awkward intersections, never mind trying to navigate them during construction, rush hour, or the annual SXSW festival that draws in thousands of people and blocks off downtown. Austinites are already complaining about how Waymo vehicles perform -- I can only imagine the nightmare of a newcomer multiplying the number of robotaxis on the road. All robotaxis tend to drive overly cautiously, sometimes impeding traffic, so there's the potential for some serious traffic jams, particularly knowing that taxis from one company don't have a way of communicating with those from another. A Waymo and a Model Y stopped on a road like 6th or Congress would generate chaos.\nFrom autonomous cars to nightmare robots: 3 big reveals from Tesla's 'We, Robot' event\nElon Musk introduces two new self-driving vehicles and showcased his robot army.\nIs the situation really that dire?\nSome final thoughts\nProbably not from Tesla's perspective. It's planning to start with just 10 to 20 vehicles, and there's almost certainly a market for that. It could encounter trouble scaling up, depending on public opinion and the progress of FSD, yet I doubt Musk is going to give up on testing one of his favorite projects in his backyard. The man is committed to self-driving vehicles of all kinds, so I expect that nothing short of a serious accident will force him to take robotaxis off the streets. Even then, it might just be a temporary setback -- Uber eventually resumed autonomous testing after the death of Elaine Herzberg in March 2018.\nMaybe some liberal Austinites will be willing to ignore Musk's politics for the sake of a ride home from 6th Street.\nThere could also be factors I haven't considered. Maybe some liberal Austinites will be willing to ignore Musk's politics for the sake of a ride home from 6th Street -- maybe there are more conservatives downtown than I'm aware of. In any event, we're going to find out the truth very shortly, and that could determine how Tesla's long-term autonomous plans go.\nIs the iPhone 15 still worth buying in 2025? The answer is complicated\nPossibly, but you shouldn't get one straight from Apple."

  "argos_summary": "The piece explains that software\u2011defined vehicles (SDVs) are cars that can be fundamentally altered through over\u2011the\u2011air updates, offering benefits such as improved battery management, self\u2011driving performance, and a smartphone\u2011like experience, but also raising concerns about subscription fees, higher upfront costs, and software fragmentation. Tesla is credited with pioneering the model, while Rivian and other automakers are following suit, though many still rely on hardware upgrades for major changes. The article also touches on Apple\u2019s expanding car\u2011key ecosystem, noting that many brands now support wireless keys via NFC, UWB, and Bluetooth, and discusses the growing market for used electric vehicles and the challenges of battery degradation and reliability. Overall, the auto industry is moving toward a more software\u2011centric future, but the transition brings both opportunities and hurdles for manufacturers and consumers alike.",
