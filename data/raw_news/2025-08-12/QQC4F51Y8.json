  "description": "The feature, directed by the actor's son, will premiere at the New York Film Festival.",
  "content": "Three-time Academy Award winner Daniel Day-Lewis has emerged from his second retirement from acting \u2014 this one stemming back from 2018's Phantom Thread \u2014 with a first look at the directorial debut of his son Ronan Day-Lewis, Anemone.\n\u2022 None June Squibb sparks Oscar buzz for 'Eleanor the Great': Everything to know about Scarlett Johansson's directorial debut as trailer debuts\n\u2022 None Emmys upheaval: 'The Late Show With Stephen Colbert' now predicted to win Best Variety Talk Series\n\nThe film, which the elder Day-Lewis cowrote with the younger, is set for a premiere at the New York Film Festival, as a part of its Spotlight Selections.\n\nWhile the film has yet to play in front of audiences, the presence of one of his generation's most celebrated actors is enough to kick off an awards conversation, so here's everything you need to know about Daniel Day-Lewis in Anemone.\n\nWho else stars in it?\n\nDay-Lewis aside, Anemone has a solid cast. Sean Bean, also featured in the first-look image, has the other lead role. It's exciting to see an actor who has done such strong supporting work for decades across mediums get a nice meaty role opposite one of the great leading men.\n\nBacking Bean and Day-Lewis up are two-time Oscar nominee Samantha Morton and Samuel Bottomley (How to Have Sex).\n\nHere's how the synopsis from the New York Film Festival describes the plot:\n\nWhen does it come out?\n\nAfter premiering at NYFF this September, Anemone will open in limited release on Oct. 3, before expanding one week later.\n\nWhat are its Oscar chances?\n\nI mean, it's literally Daniel Day-Lewis, so it's only slightly less ridiculous than asking how good Meryl Streep's Oscar chances are. The man has been nominated six times and won half the time. His last two performances \u2014 Phantom Thread and Lincoln \u2014 resulted in two nods and one win.\n\nBut it's not unprecedented for Day-Lewis to miss a nomination. Between his wins for Lincoln and There Will Be Blood, there was Nine, which is saying enough. And then before There Will Be Blood, he made another movie with a family member \u2014 in that case, The Ballad of Jack and Rose, written and directed by his wife, Rebecca Miller.\n\nSo it's not quite a lock, but one absolutely worth watching.\n\u2022 None Everything to know about 'The Batman 2': Returning cast, script finalized\n\u2022 None 'It was wonderful to be on that ride': Christian Slater talks his beloved roles, from cult classics (\u2018Heathers,\u2019 \u2018True Romance\u2019) to TV hits (\u2018Mr. Robot,\u2019 \u2018Dexter: Original Sin\u2019)\n\nSign up for Gold Derby's Newsletter.

      "text": "By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.\nWe use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.\nFor the second year in a row, June Squibbis generating Oscar buzz.\nThe 95-year-old actress, who received critical acclaim for her first leading role in the 2024 comedy Thelma, is once again in awards contention with Eleanor the Great. Helmed by Scarlett Johansson in her feature directorial debut, the film premiered to mixed reviews at the 2025 Venice Film Festival \u2014 but all were glowing for Squibb. Watch the trailer below and keep reading for everything you need to know.\nWhat's it about?\nWritten by Tory Kamen, Eleanor the Great focuses on the titular Eleanor (Squibb), who moves to New York from Florida after the death of her best friend and roommate, Bessie, a Holocaust survivor. The story takes a turn when Eleanor finds herself sitting in a Holocaust survivors' support group and proceeds to share Bessie\u2019s story as her own. Complications ensue.\nJoining Squibb onscreen is an impressive ensemble that includes Oscar nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor as Roger, a local news anchor; Jessica Hecht as Eleanor's daughter, Lisa; Erin Kellyman as Nina, an aspiring journalist; and Rita Zohar as Bessie, Eleanor's lifelong best friend.\nWho's behind the scenes?\nCollaborating with Johansson behind the camera are cinematographer H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Louvart, editor Harry Jierjian, and composer Dustin O'Halloran, an Oscar nominee in 2017 for his score for Lion. Producers for the film include Johansson, Jessamine Burgum, Charlotte Dauphin, Kara Durrett, Keenan Flynn, Jonathan Lia, Celine Rattray, and Trudie Styler.\nAwards potential\nThere's already early buzz surrounding Squibb, who kicked off her awards campaign by presenting alongside Johansson at the 2025 Oscars. Following the film's premiere in Cannes back in May, the veteran actress earned a standing ovation for her performance, which critics described as \"a pure joy from start to finish,\" and \"the finest performance of her career.\"\nSquibb currently sits in 11th place in Gold Derby's early Oscar odds for Best Actress at the 2026 Academy Awards. While she may be seen as an underdog for the Oscar, her chances could improve at the Golden Globes, where six nominees are recognized in both the drama and comedy/musical categories. However, any recognition for the film beyond Squibb's performance is considered an outside shot at this stage.\nIf nominated for an Oscar, it would mark Squibb's second Academy Award nod. Her first came in 2014 when she earned a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her standout role in Nebraska.\nNews & Predictions\nGet the latest updates on awards and entertainment news\nGet the latest updates on awards and entertainment news\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.\nWe use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services."

      "text": "17. WAR OF THE WORLDS (2005)\nDirector: Steven Spielberg. Writers: Josh Friedman, David Koepp. Starring Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning, Tim Robbins.\nLoosely based on the H.G. Wells novel, Steven Spielberg\u2019s 2005 remake again depicts an invasions of aliens that have huge mechanisms with which to decimate Earth. Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, a Regular Joe dock worker who, though not living with his kids, rushes to protect them and their mother as the aliens obliterate everything in sight. Beyond that, it\u2019s not a character-driven kind of film, but Cruise once again plays a convincing hero concerned with family, and that performance, combined with the Spielberg skill makes for a popcorn movie par excellence.\nWhere is The Last Samurai?\nI meant first collaboration\nHow could youhave forgotten \u201cThe Last Sammurai\u201d? This should be #1, and 40 years from now, it will be considered his greatest movie as it will stand the test of time much better than that crap show called \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July\u201d\nBorn on the 4th of July was no \u201ccrap show\u201d.\nInstead, it was the most realistic & moving depiction of a Vietnam Veteran/Wounded Warrior since John Voight & Jane Fonda in Coming Home.\nTom Cruise really stretched himself in this role, exhibiting both pain & his typical gung-ho cockiness. Director Oliver Stone had already brilliantly depicted the horrific realities of war in his Oscar winner Platoon. But Born On the 4th of July ups the ante some, showing how patriotism taken too far, & glorifying war can lead to tragic results & fates. I strongly feel that this was the role Cruise was born to play, and that he should have won Oscar gold for Best Actor that year for this challenging role/film.\nWhat about Cocktail? Another 80\u2019s classic.\nUm, Rooster was not Iceman\u2019s son. Did you even watch either top gun movie??? SMH"
