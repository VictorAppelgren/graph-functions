  "content": "Cabinet manufacturing company American Woodmark (NASDAQ:AMWD) will be reporting earnings this Tuesday before the bell. Here\u2019s what to expect.\n\nAmerican Woodmark missed analysts\u2019 revenue expectations by 6.6% last quarter, reporting revenues of $400.4 million, down 11.7% year on year. It was a softer quarter for the company, with full-year EBITDA guidance missing analysts\u2019 expectations significantly and a miss of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates.\n\nIs American Woodmark a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it\u2019s free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting American Woodmark\u2019s revenue to decline 8% year on year to $422.2 million, in line with the 7.9% decrease it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $1.14 per share.\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. American Woodmark has missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue estimates three times over the last two years.\n\nLooking at American Woodmark\u2019s peers in the home construction materials segment, some have already reported their Q2 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Masco\u2019s revenues decreased 1.9% year on year, beating analysts\u2019 expectations by 2.5%, and JELD-WEN reported a revenue decline of 16.5%, topping estimates by 1.7%. Masco traded up 4.7% following the results while JELD-WEN was also up 19.3%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Masco\u2019s results here and JELD-WEN\u2019s results here.\n\nThere has been positive sentiment among investors in the home construction materials segment, with share prices up 4% on average over the last month. American Woodmark is up 18.3% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $70.33 (compared to the current share price of $65.58).\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

      "text": "Masco (MAS)\nMasco is in for a bumpy ride. Its poor sales growth and falling returns on capital suggest its growth opportunities are shrinking.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Masco Will Underperform\nHeadquartered just outside of Detroit, MI, Masco (NYSE:MAS) designs and manufactures home-building products such as glass shower doors, decorative lighting, bathtubs, and faucets.\n- Annual sales declines of 3.5% for the past two years show its products and services struggled to connect with the market during this cycle\n- Absence of organic revenue growth over the past two years suggests it may have to lean into acquisitions to drive its expansion\n- Projected sales growth of 1.3% for the next 12 months suggests sluggish demand\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Masco\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Masco\nMasco is trading at $75.58 per share, or 20.4x forward P/E. Masco\u2019s valuation may seem like a bargain, especially when stacked up against other industrials companies. We remind you that you often get what you pay for, though.\nIt\u2019s better to pay up for high-quality businesses with higher long-term earnings potential rather than to buy lower-quality stocks because they appear cheap. These challenged businesses often don\u2019t re-rate, a phenomenon known as a \u201cvalue trap\u201d.\n3. Masco (MAS) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nHome-building design and manufacturing company Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) reported revenue ahead of Wall Street\u2019s expectations in Q2 CY2025, but sales fell by 1.9% year on year to $2.05 billion. Its non-GAAP profit of $1.30 per share was 20% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nMasco (MAS) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $2.05 billion vs analyst estimates of $2.00 billion (1.9% year-on-year decline, 2.5% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $1.30 vs analyst estimates of $1.08 (20% beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $449 million vs analyst estimates of $386.6 million (21.9% margin, 16.1% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS guidance for the full year is $4 at the midpoint, beating analyst estimates by 10.5%\n- Operating Margin: 20.1%, up from 19% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 13.2%, down from 14.5% in the same quarter last year\n- Organic Revenue was flat year on year (-2.2% in the same quarter last year)\n- Market Capitalization: $13.87 billion\nCompany Overview\nHeadquartered just outside of Detroit, MI, Masco (NYSE:MAS) designs and manufactures home-building products such as glass shower doors, decorative lighting, bathtubs, and faucets.\nThe company offers customers the products they need to build a home from scratch or the products they need to renovate their already existing homes. It is most known for providing products for the residential sector, although recently its subsidiaries and product lines have expanded to include commercial and industrial sectors. The company\u2019s portfolio includes over 20 brands and has an international presence, most notably in Europe.\nMasco segments its products into 2 categories: decorative architectural products like glass shower doors, decorative light fixtures, and aesthetic closet and cabinet space; and plumbing products, like faucets, showerheads, and toilets. The company does not offer any installation services or any other kind of significant service.\nThe company revenue breakdown is evenly split between the sales of its decorative architectural products and plumbing products. It sells to both professional contractors and do-it-yourself (DIY) customers, primarily through retail distribution, online sales, and distributor networks to professional contractors. The company does not have a source of recurring revenue as all of its revenue is driven by one-time product sales. Masco only sells its plumbing products in international markets, instead of selling both plumbing and its decorative architectural products.\n4. Home Construction Materials\nTraditionally, home construction materials companies have built economic moats with expertise in specialized areas, brand recognition, and strong relationships with contractors. More recently, advances to address labor availability and job site productivity have spurred innovation that is driving incremental demand. However, these companies are at the whim of residential construction volumes, which tend to be cyclical and can be impacted heavily by economic factors such as interest rates. Additionally, the costs of raw materials can be driven by a myriad of worldwide factors and greatly influence the profitability of home construction materials companies.\nOther companies that compete in Masco\u2019s markets include The Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Lowe\u2019s (NYSE:LOW), and private company American Standard Brands.\n5. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Unfortunately, Masco\u2019s 2.7% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was sluggish. This was below our standards and is a rough starting point for our analysis.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss new industry trends or demand cycles. Masco\u2019s performance shows it grew in the past but relinquished its gains over the last two years, as its revenue fell by 3.5% annually.\nMasco also reports organic revenue, which strips out one-time events like acquisitions and currency fluctuations that don\u2019t accurately reflect its fundamentals. Over the last two years, Masco\u2019s organic revenue averaged 2.8% year-on-year declines. Because this number aligns with its two-year revenue growth, we can see the company\u2019s core operations (not acquisitions and divestitures) drove most of its results.\nThis quarter, Masco\u2019s revenue fell by 1.9% year on year to $2.05 billion but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 2.5%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 1.8% over the next 12 months. Although this projection implies its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance, it is still below average for the sector.\n6. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nAt StockStory, we prefer high gross margin businesses because they indicate the company has pricing power or differentiated products, giving it a chance to generate higher operating profits.\nMasco\u2019s gross margin is good compared to other industrials businesses and signals it sells differentiated products, not commodities. As you can see below, it averaged an impressive 34.9% gross margin over the last five years. That means for every $100 in revenue, roughly $34.85 was left to spend on selling, marketing, R&D, and general administrative overhead.\nIn Q2, Masco produced a 37.7% gross profit margin, in line with the same quarter last year. On a wider time horizon, the company\u2019s full-year margin has remained steady over the past four quarters, suggesting its input costs (such as raw materials and manufacturing expenses) have been stable and it isn\u2019t under pressure to lower prices.\n7. Operating Margin\nMasco has been a well-oiled machine over the last five years. It demonstrated elite profitability for an industrials business, boasting an average operating margin of 16.9%. This result isn\u2019t too surprising as its gross margin gives it a favorable starting point.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, Masco\u2019s operating margin decreased by 1.6 percentage points over the last five years. This raises questions about the company\u2019s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability.\nThis quarter, Masco generated an operating margin profit margin of 20.1%, up 1.1 percentage points year on year. The increase was encouraging, and because its operating margin rose more than its gross margin, we can infer it was more efficient with expenses such as marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nMasco\u2019s EPS grew at a solid 10.4% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 2.7% annualized revenue growth. However, this alone doesn\u2019t tell us much about its business quality because its operating margin didn\u2019t improve.\nDiving into the nuances of Masco\u2019s earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. A five-year view shows that Masco has repurchased its stock, shrinking its share count by 19.8%. This tells us its EPS outperformed its revenue not because of increased operational efficiency but financial engineering, as buybacks boost per share earnings.\nLike with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business.\nFor Masco, its two-year annual EPS growth of 5.8% was lower than its five-year trend. We hope its growth can accelerate in the future.\nIn Q2, Masco reported adjusted EPS at $1.30, up from $1.20 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Masco\u2019s full-year EPS of $4.13 to shrink by 10.2%.\n9. Cash Is King\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nMasco has shown robust cash profitability, enabling it to comfortably ride out cyclical downturns while investing in plenty of new offerings and returning capital to investors. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin averaged 10.3% over the last five years, quite impressive for an industrials business.\nMasco\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $270 million in Q2, equivalent to a 13.2% margin. The company\u2019s cash profitability regressed as it was 1.3 percentage points lower than in the same quarter last year, but it\u2019s still above its five-year average. We wouldn\u2019t read too much into this quarter\u2019s decline because investment needs can be seasonal, leading to short-term swings. Long-term trends carry greater meaning.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nAlthough Masco hasn\u2019t been the highest-quality company lately because of its poor top-line performance, it found a few growth initiatives in the past that worked out wonderfully. Its five-year average ROIC was 48.3%, splendid for an industrials business.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Unfortunately, Masco\u2019s ROIC has decreased significantly over the last few years. We like what management has done in the past, but its declining returns are perhaps a symptom of fewer profitable growth opportunities.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nMasco reported $390 million of cash and $3.22 billion of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $1.50 billion of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view Masco\u2019s 1.9\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $49 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n12. Key Takeaways from Masco\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly Masco blew past analysts\u2019 EPS and EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also glad its full-year EPS guidance trumped Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Zooming out, we think this was a solid print. The stock traded up 10.6% to $72.70 immediately after reporting.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy Masco?\nUpdated: August 24, 2025 at 11:16 PM EDT\nBefore deciding whether to buy Masco or pass, we urge investors to consider business quality, valuation, and the latest quarterly results.\nWe cheer for all companies making their customers lives easier, but in the case of Masco, we\u2019ll be cheering from the sidelines. First off, its revenue growth was weak over the last five years, and analysts expect its demand to deteriorate over the next 12 months. And while its stellar ROIC suggests it has been a well-run company historically, the downside is its diminishing returns show management's prior bets haven't worked out. On top of that, its projected EPS for the next year is lacking.\nMasco\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 20.4x. This valuation is reasonable, but the company\u2019s shaky fundamentals present too much downside risk. There are better investments elsewhere.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $75.33 on the company (compared to the current share price of $75.58)."

      "text": "American Woodmark (AMWD)\nAmerican Woodmark is up against the odds. Not only are its sales cratering but also its low returns on capital suggest it struggles to generate profits.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think American Woodmark Will Underperform\nStarting as a small millwork shop, American Woodmark (NASDAQ:AMWD) is a cabinet manufacturing company that helps customers from inspiration to installation.\n- Sales tumbled by 9% annually over the last two years, showing market trends are working against its favor during this cycle\n- Falling earnings per share over the last two years has some investors worried as stock prices ultimately follow EPS over the long term\n- Sales are expected to decline once again over the next 12 months as it continues working through a challenging demand environment\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than American Woodmark\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than American Woodmark\nAt $65.58 per share, American Woodmark trades at 10.8x forward P/E. This multiple is cheaper than most industrials peers, but we think this is justified.\nOur advice is to pay up for elite businesses whose advantages are tailwinds to earnings growth. Don\u2019t get sucked into lower-quality businesses just because they seem like bargains. These mediocre businesses often never achieve a higher multiple as hoped, a phenomenon known as a \u201cvalue trap\u201d.\n3. American Woodmark (AMWD) Research Report: Q1 CY2025 Update\nCabinet manufacturing company American Woodmark (NASDAQ:AMWD) fell short of the market\u2019s revenue expectations in Q1 CY2025, with sales falling 11.7% year on year to $400.4 million. Its non-GAAP profit of $1.61 per share was 13.4% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nAmerican Woodmark (AMWD) Q1 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $400.4 million vs analyst estimates of $428.8 million (11.7% year-on-year decline, 6.6% miss)\n- Adjusted EPS: $1.61 vs analyst estimates of $1.42 (13.4% beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $47.1 million vs analyst estimates of $49.17 million (11.8% margin, 4.2% miss)\n- EBITDA guidance for the upcoming financial year 2026 is $187.5 million at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $206.4 million\n- Operating Margin: 7.4%, down from 8.4% in the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $840.2 million\nCompany Overview\nStarting as a small millwork shop, American Woodmark (NASDAQ:AMWD) is a cabinet manufacturing company that helps customers from inspiration to installation.\nThe company specializes in the design, manufacture, and distribution of kitchen cabinets and vanities for new home construction markets and home renovations. Its products are available through a variety of channels, including home centers, builders, and independent dealers and distributors, catering to a wide customer base.\nIts product offerings include kitchen cabinetry, bath cabinetry, office cabinetry, home organization cabinetry, and cabinetry hardware. All of these types of cabinetry are then offered in a variety of designs, finishes, finish colors, and door styles. Its products are available in made-to-order styles (AKA customizable) and stock styles.\nMost of the company\u2019s sales are generated through its cabinetry and related product offerings. Its net sales are divided into three categories: sales to home centers such as The Home Depot and Lowes, builders, and independent dealers & distributors. Home center sales generate most of the company\u2019s revenue, with The Home Depot being its top customer. Service revenue from the installation of its products also makes up a portion of its revenue, as the company operates eight strategically placed service centers across the US.\n4. Home Construction Materials\nTraditionally, home construction materials companies have built economic moats with expertise in specialized areas, brand recognition, and strong relationships with contractors. More recently, advances to address labor availability and job site productivity have spurred innovation that is driving incremental demand. However, these companies are at the whim of residential construction volumes, which tend to be cyclical and can be impacted heavily by economic factors such as interest rates. Additionally, the costs of raw materials can be driven by a myriad of worldwide factors and greatly influence the profitability of home construction materials companies.\nOther companies in the cabinetry market include Masco (NYSE:MAS), Fortune Brands Home & Security (NYSE:FBHS), and private company MasterBrand Cabinets.\n5. Sales Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Unfortunately, American Woodmark struggled to consistently increase demand as its $1.71 billion of sales for the trailing 12 months was close to its revenue five years ago. This wasn\u2019t a great result and suggests it\u2019s a low quality business.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss cycles, industry trends, or a company capitalizing on catalysts such as a new contract win or a successful product line. American Woodmark\u2019s recent performance shows its demand remained suppressed as its revenue has declined by 9% annually over the last two years.\nThis quarter, American Woodmark missed Wall Street\u2019s estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 11.7% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $400.4 million of revenue.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to remain flat over the next 12 months. While this projection suggests its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance, it is still below the sector average.\n6. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nGross profit margin is a critical metric to track because it sheds light on its pricing power, complexity of products, and ability to procure raw materials, equipment, and labor.\nAmerican Woodmark has bad unit economics for an industrials business, signaling it operates in a competitive market. As you can see below, it averaged a 17.3% gross margin over the last five years. Said differently, American Woodmark had to pay a chunky $82.71 to its suppliers for every $100 in revenue.\nThis quarter, American Woodmark\u2019s gross profit margin was 17%, down 1.5 percentage points year on year. American Woodmark\u2019s full-year margin has also been trending down over the past 12 months, decreasing by 2.8 percentage points. If this move continues, it could suggest a more competitive environment with some pressure to lower prices and higher input costs (such as raw materials and manufacturing expenses).\n7. Operating Margin\nOperating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income - the bottom line - excluding the impact of taxes and interest on debt, which are less connected to business fundamentals.\nAmerican Woodmark was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 6.4% was weak for an industrials business. This result isn\u2019t too surprising given its low gross margin as a starting point.\nOn the plus side, American Woodmark\u2019s operating margin rose by 1.6 percentage points over the last five years.\nThis quarter, American Woodmark generated an operating profit margin of 7.4%, down 1.1 percentage points year on year. Since American Woodmark\u2019s gross margin decreased more than its operating margin, we can assume its recent inefficiencies were driven more by weaker leverage on its cost of sales rather than increased marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead expenses.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nAmerican Woodmark\u2019s EPS was flat over the last five years, just like its revenue. This performance was underwhelming across the board.\nLike with revenue, we analyze EPS over a shorter period to see if we are missing a change in the business.\nAlthough it wasn\u2019t great, American Woodmark\u2019s two-year annual EPS declines of 6.7% topped its two-year revenue performance.\nIn Q1, American Woodmark reported EPS at $1.61, down from $1.70 in the same quarter last year. Despite falling year on year, this print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects American Woodmark\u2019s full-year EPS of $6.63 to shrink by 6.4%.\n9. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nAmerican Woodmark has shown weak cash profitability over the last five years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 4.6%, subpar for an industrials business.\nTaking a step back, we can see that American Woodmark\u2019s margin dropped by 3.4 percentage points during that time. This along with its unexciting margin put the company in a tough spot, and shareholders are likely hoping it can reverse course. If the trend continues, it could signal it\u2019s becoming a more capital-intensive business.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nAmerican Woodmark historically did a mediocre job investing in profitable growth initiatives. Its five-year average ROIC was 6.7%, somewhat low compared to the best industrials companies that consistently pump out 20%+.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Fortunately, American Woodmark\u2019s ROIC averaged 4.8 percentage point increases over the last few years. This is a good sign, and we hope the company can continue improving.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nAmerican Woodmark reported $48.2 million of cash and $509.9 million of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $208.6 million of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view American Woodmark\u2019s 2.2\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $4.77 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n12. Key Takeaways from American Woodmark\u2019s Q1 Results\nWe enjoyed seeing American Woodmark beat analysts\u2019 EPS expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its revenue and EBITDA missed as well as its full-year EBITDA guidance. Overall, this was a weaker quarter. The stock traded down 1.7% to $55.58 immediately after reporting.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy American Woodmark?\nUpdated: August 24, 2025 at 11:11 PM EDT\nAre you wondering whether to buy American Woodmark or pass? We urge investors to not only consider the latest earnings results but also longer-term business quality and valuation as well.\nAmerican Woodmark falls short of our quality standards. For starters, its revenue growth was weak over the last five years, and analysts expect its demand to deteriorate over the next 12 months. And while its rising returns show management's prior bets are at least better than before, the downside is its projected EPS for the next year is lacking. On top of that, its weak EPS growth over the last five years shows it\u2019s failed to produce meaningful profits for shareholders.\nAmerican Woodmark\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 10.8x. This valuation is reasonable, but the company\u2019s shaky fundamentals present too much downside risk. There are more exciting stocks to buy at the moment.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $70.33 on the company (compared to the current share price of $65.58)."

      "text": "An Attractive Network Effect At A Silly Price\nMatch Group (MTCH) has certainly been in the doldrums recently. And as investors, we often don't get out of bed for a turnaround story because, ultimately, most turnarounds never turn. But Match isn't like the rest\u2013it has a powerful network effect that keeps users coming back, making it extremely difficult for competitors to make any headway.\nBetter yet, the company's recent results show its new strategy is already working. Revenue and operating income both improved in Q3 FY 2023, and the share price is still languishing near 5-year lows. This presents a rare buying opportunity. We recommended the stock exclusively to members of StockStory Edge on December 8th, 2023.\nWhile it\u2019s great to see the share price gaining a little since our members bought in, we think this story is only beginning to gain steam because sentiment is still very weak. Once we think sentiment has returned to more bullish levels, we may well issue a sell rating on the stock. But in the meantime, there is plenty of room for growth.\nAnd, of course, paying members of StockStory Edge will be first to know about it if and when we change our view.\nAs our way of welcoming you aboard our free membership tier, we hope you enjoy this abridged version of our full recommendation, which is only available to members of StockStory Edge.\nMatch Group (MTCH): Stock Of The Month For December 2023\nMatch Group is the leader in a growing market, but the stock trades at a value price of less than 14x forward P/E. It wasn\u2019t always this way.\nThe company\u2019s grip on online dating and fast, profitable growth once made it a stock market darling\u2013until its fall from grace.\nOver the last two years, Match\u2019s sputtering subscriber base has investors debating whether its business is broken, which we find an overreaction. The market doesn\u2019t realize there is a logical explanation behind its recent slump\u2013higher churn due to a one-off, significant price increase\u2013and that its apps are still the go-to for young adults seeking connection.\nThis makes a rare opportunity to own a high-quality cash flow machine for cheap.\nWhat Is Match Group?\nSpun out of media and internet conglomerate IAC in 2019, Match is the world\u2019s largest online dating company with over 10 distinct brands and 15.7 million paying subscribers (\u201cpayers\u201d). Its largest app is Tinder (known for its swipe feature), which has 10.4 million paying subscribers, and its rising star is Hinge (known for its focus on long-term relationships) with 1.3 million paying subscribers. Rounding out the group\u2019s portfolio are its Asia-focused, emerging, and evergreen (legacy) brands.\nWhy We're Smitten With The Online Dating Industry\nToday, over 20% of all relationships start online, and thanks to its immense reach, over 50% of them begin on a Match brand. With each new generation becoming more digitally native and open to finding that special someone through an app, we see compelling growth potential for the industry. Just look at Gen Z\u2013they\u2019re the first generation to grow up with the internet, are now entering the prime dating age of 18-to-25 years old, and are already Tinder\u2019s largest cohort of users.\nFrom a business model standpoint, we also like how online dating seems to be a \u2018winner-take-most\u2019 market where the scaled platforms have the most fruitful dating pools, making them the most attractive hubs for new singles to meet.\nWould you rather find dates on an app with 80 people or 80,000?\nThe answer is obvious.\nAnd that\u2019s what makes it so hard for new players to compete: it\u2019s hard to get scale without scale since the first users are likely wasting their time. Even tech giant Meta (formerly Facebook), which had all the raw materials for success\u2013a huge user base and heaps of cash to fund its venture\u2013tried to enter the space with Facebook Dating but failed because of the incumbent platforms\u2019 popularity.\nWho Does Match Compete Against?\nBecause of the network effect of online dating, we think the current landscape is a three-horse race between Tinder, Hinge, and Bumble. Sure, there are niche platforms like Raya and Grindr, along with others for people of similar religions and races, but the biggest apps have the brand recognition, diverse user base, and technology chops to legitimately compete for the mass market. Most importantly, MTCH owns two of the three.\nAlthough Bumble, which prides itself on having women make the first move, is a fundamentally sound business, we prefer Match because Bumble is dealing with massive leadership uncertainty\u2013in late 2023, Founder and CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd announced she would be stepping down in 2024, muddying the company\u2019s strategic direction.\nIs Now The Time To Buy Match?\nAs you can see below, Match Group compounded its revenue at a 15% annual growth rate while producing an average adjusted operating profit margin of 37% between 2019 and 2022.\nThe share price has been on a rollercoaster, though, and shrinking user numbers (arising from price rises) have smashed the share price well below its highs.\nBut market pessimism, just like optimism, often swings too far to one side, and we believe Match\u2019s troubles are temporary.\nAfter years of rapid growth, Match\u2019s payer (aka subscriber) additions began decelerating at the end of 2021, and it started losing payers at the end of 2022. But we believe Match\u2019s troubles are temporary.\nThe payer declines from the company\u2019s dramatic, one-time price shock finally stabilized in Q3 2023 as Tinder payers were sequentially flat, and the broader company returned to sequential growth in payers.\nWe believe this represents a turning point in Match\u2019s story and that a recovery is en route. The dust has settled, and a new foundation of higher-spending users will rise from the ashes.\nWhat Does Match's Future Hold?\nMatch\u2019s future excites us because a stable and growing payer base willing to spend more translates into accelerated revenue growth.\nYou can see in the chart below how we expect its payers to return to modest growth while revenue per payer should continue to increase towards the competition (Bumble).\nClosing the pricing gap between Match and Bumble is low-hanging fruit because it unleashes the company\u2019s power users, or \u201cwhales.\u201d\nThese whales are invaluable assets who spend unbelievable amounts of money online\u2013documents from the 2020 Epic Games v. Apple court case revealed that only 0.5% of Apple\u2019s users generated 50%+ of App Store fees, each spending $1,800+ on average per year. This speaks to the impact of a platform\u2019s most prolific users, and it\u2019s no wonder Match is leaning in aggressively, going as far as launching a new subscription tier called Tinder Select that charges users $500 per month.\nMeanwhile, Hinge is the hidden crown jewel within the company, with a track record of growing revenue at 40%+. Management expects growth to accelerate, and we see a long runway for payer additions as it expands internationally\u2013the app is only live in 20 countries compared to 200 for Tinder.\nSumming it up, we believe Match\u2019s payer base has bottomed as the one-time, 60%+ price increase is behind us. As you can see below, this translates into strong forecasted free cash flow growth thanks to its asset-lite business model. Match Group has stated it\u2019ll use half its free cash flow to repurchase its stock, so we think if free cash flow increases strongly, the stock price will follow.\nWhat Are The Key Risks And How Do We Feel About Them?\nHere at StockStory, we believe it's crucial to identify and think through the risks in our investment thesis. For MTCH, we\u2019ve boiled them down into the three most important: Tinder payer weakness, a worsening user experience, and competition.\nIf the crux of our thesis is that Tinder\u2019s payer weakness is temporary and will recover, then it follows that lack of recovery is a major risk. We argue that Match\u2019s pricing optimization is the right decision and the main reason behind Tinder\u2019s falling payers. But if payers continue to leave the ecosystem over the next year, not because of pricing but a worsening user experience, there could be further declines in the stock price.\nIn terms of user experience, in theory, every incremental user that joins a platform makes it more valuable because it increases selection for existing users. But in reality, Tinder suffers from low-quality accounts that are unlikely to add value to paying users.\nAlthough it sounds harsh, the lower-quality profiles detract from the product, potentially causing some users to get frustrated and unsubscribe. If Match is unable to keep user quality at a reasonable level, it could suffer meaningful brand damage.\nWrapping up our list of concerns is competition. The barriers to entry for developing a mobile app are low, so someone with the relevant technical skills could create a competitor app quickly with limited resources. TikTok, which offers a new content discovery algorithm and seemingly caught fire overnight, is a prime example.\nTikTok\u2019s success shows how innovation and virality are tailwinds that help new entrants scale. Luckily, with the market pessimism surrounding the online dating space and higher interest rates that make venture capital investments less attractive, we see a lower probability of more online dating startups being funded. We\u2019ve also got a few singles on our team who are willing and able to scan the landscape for up-and-coming competitors\nClosing Thoughts\nMatch digitized dating and was rewarded for it with brand equity, a leading market position, and financials that most would swipe right on. Although it\u2019s faced some speed bumps lately, we\u2019re confident its payer numbers will recover, making the stock a catch.\nIt\u2019s not every day we see a no-brainer like this, but when we do, we pull the trigger while the stock is still cheap.\nPlease note that members of StockStory hold shares in Match Group.

      "text": "JELD-WEN (JELD)\nJELD-WEN keeps us up at night. Not only are its sales cratering but also its low returns on capital suggest it struggles to generate profits.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think JELD-WEN Will Underperform\nFounded in the 1960s as a general wood-making company, JELD-WEN (NYSE:JELD) manufactures doors, windows, and other related building products.\n- Sales tumbled by 3.7% annually over the last five years, showing market trends are working against its favor during this cycle\n- Sales were less profitable over the last five years as its earnings per share fell by 60.9% annually, worse than its revenue declines\n- Short cash runway increases the probability of a capital raise that dilutes existing shareholders\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than JELD-WEN\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than JELD-WEN\nAt $6.28 per share, JELD-WEN trades at 98.6x forward P/E. We consider this valuation aggressive considering the weaker revenue growth profile.\nWe prefer to invest in similarly-priced but higher-quality companies with superior earnings growth.\n3. JELD-WEN (JELD) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nBuilding products manufacturer JELD-WEN (NYSE:JELD) reported revenue ahead of Wall Street\u2019s expectations in Q2 CY2025, but sales fell by 16.5% year on year to $823.7 million. The company\u2019s full-year revenue guidance of $3.3 billion at the midpoint came in 3.8% above analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP loss of $0.04 per share was 61.9% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nJELD-WEN (JELD) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $823.7 million vs analyst estimates of $810.3 million (16.5% year-on-year decline, 1.7% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: -$0.04 vs analyst estimates of -$0.10 (61.9% beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $39 million vs analyst estimates of $30.6 million (4.7% margin, 27.5% beat)\n- EBITDA guidance for the full year is $185 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $146.6 million\n- Operating Margin: -1.7%, down from 0.5% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 1.3%, similar to the same quarter last year\n- Organic Revenue fell 13% year on year, in line with the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $378.7 million\nCompany Overview\nFounded in the 1960s as a general wood-making company, JELD-WEN (NYSE:JELD) manufactures doors, windows, and other related building products.\nThe company serves the North American and European construction market with building materials. Simply put, its products give homebuilders the materials and products needed to build new homes and remodel existing ones.\nJELD-WEN\u2019s products include interior and exterior doors like patio doors and sliding door systems. It also offers non-residential doors made of steel, glass, and fiberglass to meet the often custom needs of enterprise customers. Its window products range from wood and vinyl residential windows to multi-pane windows with high-performance glazing that boast superior energy efficiency. The company\u2019s offerings try to strike a balance between utility and aesthetics.\nDoor and window sales constitute the vast majority of JELD-WEN\u2019s revenue. While the company does provide some installation services, they do not generate a meaningful portion of sales.\n4. Home Construction Materials\nTraditionally, home construction materials companies have built economic moats with expertise in specialized areas, brand recognition, and strong relationships with contractors. More recently, advances to address labor availability and job site productivity have spurred innovation that is driving incremental demand. However, these companies are at the whim of residential construction volumes, which tend to be cyclical and can be impacted heavily by economic factors such as interest rates. Additionally, the costs of raw materials can be driven by a myriad of worldwide factors and greatly influence the profitability of home construction materials companies.\nCompetitors offering door and window building materials include Masonite (NYSE:DOOR), and private companies Pella and Ply Gem.\n5. Revenue Growth\nExamining a company\u2019s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. JELD-WEN struggled to consistently generate demand over the last five years as its sales dropped at a 3.7% annual rate. This was below our standards and suggests it\u2019s a low quality business.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss new industry trends or demand cycles. JELD-WEN\u2019s recent performance shows its demand remained suppressed as its revenue has declined by 12.9% annually over the last two years.\nJELD-WEN also reports organic revenue, which strips out one-time events like acquisitions and currency fluctuations that don\u2019t accurately reflect its fundamentals. Over the last two years, JELD-WEN\u2019s organic revenue averaged 12.6% year-on-year declines. Because this number aligns with its two-year revenue growth, we can see the company\u2019s core operations (not acquisitions and divestitures) drove most of its results.\nThis quarter, JELD-WEN\u2019s revenue fell by 16.5% year on year to $823.7 million but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 1.7%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline by 6.5% over the next 12 months. Although this projection is better than its two-year trend, it\u2019s hard to get excited about a company that is struggling with demand.\n6. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nJELD-WEN has bad unit economics for an industrials business, signaling it operates in a competitive market. As you can see below, it averaged a 19.3% gross margin over the last five years. Said differently, JELD-WEN had to pay a chunky $80.68 to its suppliers for every $100 in revenue.\nThis quarter, JELD-WEN\u2019s gross profit margin was 17.4%, down 1.9 percentage points year on year. JELD-WEN\u2019s full-year margin has also been trending down over the past 12 months, decreasing by 2.4 percentage points. If this move continues, it could suggest a more competitive environment with some pressure to lower prices and higher input costs (such as raw materials and manufacturing expenses).\n7. Operating Margin\nOperating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income - the bottom line - excluding the impact of taxes and interest on debt, which are less connected to business fundamentals.\nJELD-WEN was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 1.3% was weak for an industrials business. This result isn\u2019t too surprising given its low gross margin as a starting point.\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, JELD-WEN\u2019s operating margin decreased by 14.3 percentage points over the last five years. JELD-WEN\u2019s performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows that costs were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass them onto its customers.\nThis quarter, JELD-WEN generated an operating margin profit margin of negative 1.7%, down 2.2 percentage points year on year. Since JELD-WEN\u2019s operating margin decreased more than its gross margin, we can assume it was less efficient because expenses such as marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead increased.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nSadly for JELD-WEN, its EPS declined by 60.9% annually over the last five years, more than its revenue. This tells us the company struggled because its fixed cost base made it difficult to adjust to shrinking demand.\nWe can take a deeper look into JELD-WEN\u2019s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, JELD-WEN\u2019s operating margin declined by 14.3 percentage points over the last five years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its lower earnings; interest expenses and taxes can also affect EPS but don\u2019t tell us as much about a company\u2019s fundamentals.\nLike with revenue, we analyze EPS over a shorter period to see if we are missing a change in the business.\nFor JELD-WEN, its two-year annual EPS declines of 92.9% show it\u2019s continued to underperform. These results were bad no matter how you slice the data.\nIn Q2, JELD-WEN reported adjusted EPS at negative $0.04, down from $0.34 in the same quarter last year. Despite falling year on year, this print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects JELD-WEN to perform poorly. Analysts forecast its full-year EPS of $0.01 will hit $0.06.\n9. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nJELD-WEN has shown poor cash profitability over the last five years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 1.6%, lousy for an industrials business.\nTaking a step back, we can see that JELD-WEN\u2019s margin dropped by 10.2 percentage points during that time. Almost any movement in the wrong direction is undesirable because of its already low cash conversion. If the trend continues, it could signal it\u2019s in the middle of a big investment cycle.\nJELD-WEN\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $10.5 million in Q2, equivalent to a 1.3% margin. This cash profitability was in line with the comparable period last year and its five-year average.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nJELD-WEN historically did a mediocre job investing in profitable growth initiatives. Its five-year average ROIC was 0.2%, lower than the typical cost of capital (how much it costs to raise money) for industrials companies.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Unfortunately, JELD-WEN\u2019s ROIC has decreased significantly over the last few years. Paired with its already low returns, these declines suggest its profitable growth opportunities are few and far between.\n11. Balance Sheet Risk\nAs long-term investors, the risk we care about most is the permanent loss of capital, which can happen when a company goes bankrupt or raises money from a disadvantaged position. This is separate from short-term stock price volatility, something we are much less bothered by.\nJELD-WEN burned through $148.6 million of cash over the last year, and its $1.34 billion of debt exceeds the $134.1 million of cash on its balance sheet. This is a deal breaker for us because indebted loss-making companies spell trouble.\nUnless the JELD-WEN\u2019s fundamentals change quickly, it might find itself in a position where it must raise capital from investors to continue operating. Whether that would be favorable is unclear because dilution is a headwind for shareholder returns.\nWe remain cautious of JELD-WEN until it generates consistent free cash flow or any of its announced financing plans materialize on its balance sheet.\n12. Key Takeaways from JELD-WEN\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly JELD-WEN blew past analysts\u2019 EBITDA and EPS expectations this quarter. We were also excited its full-year EBITDA guidance is nicely ahead of Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Zooming out, we think this was a good print with some key areas of upside. The stock traded up 10.2% to $5.12 immediately following the results.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy JELD-WEN?\nUpdated: August 24, 2025 at 11:28 PM EDT\nThe latest quarterly earnings matters, sure, but we actually think longer-term fundamentals and valuation matter more. Investors should consider all these pieces before deciding whether or not to invest in JELD-WEN.\nJELD-WEN doesn\u2019t pass our quality test. First off, its revenue has declined over the last five years, and analysts expect its demand to deteriorate over the next 12 months. And while its projected EPS for the next year implies the company\u2019s fundamentals will improve, the downside is its diminishing returns show management's prior bets haven't worked out. On top of that, its relatively low ROIC suggests management has struggled to find compelling investment opportunities.\nJELD-WEN\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 98.6x. This valuation tells us a lot of optimism is priced in - we think other companies feature superior fundamentals at the moment.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $4.55 on the company (compared to the current share price of $6.28), implying they don\u2019t see much short-term potential in JELD-WEN."
