  "title": "From America\u2019s Cup To Cannes, Bluegame Debuts BGF-45 Foiling Catamaran",
  "description": "America's Cup foiling technology makes a world premiere in the recreational market at the  Cannes Yachting Festival this September.",
  "content": "Get ready for something completely different at this year\u2019s Cannes Yachting Festival: a foiling catamaran recreational model from Bluegame Yachts.\n\nHydrofoils on boats make them fast, smooth, and light. They\u2019ve been used on America\u2019s Cup yachts since 2013. Last year\u2019s defender, Emirates Team New Zealand, specified that all teams would be required to build two hydrogen-powered foiling chase boats capable of 50 knot speeds. American Magic called on Sanlorenzo\u2019s Bluegame Yachts to complete their chase boats. With zero emissions, sleek good looks, and amazing speed, the Bluegame chase boats wowed the crowd.\n\nInspired by those boats, Bluegame will unveil the world premiere of the BGF-45 at the Cannes Yachting Festival, September 9-14, 2025, bringing this groundbreaking, America\u2019s Cup racing technology to recreational yachting.\n\nThe Bluegame 45 measures 46\u20195\" LOA, has a 16\u201910\" beam, and a 3\u20199\" draft. The design, from Luca Santella and Zuccon International Project, brought hydrodynamic specialists with Mario Caponnetto and Francis Hueber together to refine the hull design for even better performance than the America\u2019s Cup chase boats they previously worked on with Bluegame.\n\nThe BGF-45 is powered by a pair of IPS 600 Volvo Penta D6 (320Kw) engines, has a maximum speed of 35 knots +/- 5 percent, and a cruise speed of 28 knots +/- 5 percent, which comes standard on the vessel. There is an option to choose Volvo Penta\u2019s 650 DC for more power. A pair of foils sits between the hulls, ready to perform their tasks, contributing to drag reduction, speed, fuel efficiency, and stability. The foil-assisted hull lifts the vessel above the water\u2019s surface to give a smooth ride while using 30 percent less fuel than conventional non-foiling yachts.\n\nThe yacht carries a maximum of 14 passengers, and has a lower deck plan for three ensuite cabins accommodating 6 guests in three cabins. Fully forward, a double guest cabin sits athwartships with an ensuite bath aft to starboard. A single cabin with ensuite bath sits aft of the double cabin to starboard. These two cabins share a stair in the starboard hull. A double cabin and ensuite bath sit amidships to port, with a dedicated stair. Aft of the cabins, the engines sit to both port and starboard. The BGF-45 has a CE B class certification.\n\nOn deck, sun pads sit on the bow, with the helm to port and a seating area and table to starboard. Aft of the helm, a seating area with sun pads aft makes a comfortable guest arrangement. The swim platform aft completes the guest areas.\n\nThe hull and superstructure are built with GRP, glass reinforced plastic that uses resin reinforced with glass fibers making it light and strong. The glass fibers offer tensile strength, bound together by the resin, resulting in a flexible composite that is also very durable. The smoothness of the GRP surface reduces drag, adding to improved speed and fuel use. GRP is also corrosion-resistant.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of their parent company, Sanlorenzo, Bluegame embraces the same philosophy of growth through innovative segments while acknowledging scarcity in its niches. Emphasizing the shared values of highest quality standards, exclusivity, scarcity, and sophistication, Bluegame is known for an unusually high level of customization.\n\nBluegame shares a valued customer base with Sanlorenzo as well as a customer-focused approach. While Sanlorenzo is unmistakable in its own right, many see Bluegame as less conventional, with its own unmistakable profile, willing to engage the most innovative industry solutions.",

      "text": "From August 22nd through October 27th, all eyes in the sailing world will be focused on Barcelona for the 37th America's Cup sailing race. The oldest international sports competition still going strong, the challenge upholds many traditions. This year, however, competing teams are working with a number of changes, one of which affects design of the chase boats that assist the race boats.\nThe new protocol was directed by the current champion, Team Emirates New Zealand. It requires each team to build a minimum of two 10+ meter hydrogen fuel cell powered chase boats capable of sustaining a minimum speed of 25 knots for no less than a 180 nautical mile range, and hit a top speed of 50 knots.\nThe results are stunning, particularly in the case of the New York Yacht Club's American Magic chase boat designed and built in Italy by Bluegame, the eccentric, nonconformist, trendsetting division of Sanlorenzo Yachts.\nBluegame, founded by Luca Santella in 2005, was tapped by the American Magic team for the build in August of 2022. Putting his 35 years of sailing experience to work, he embraced the challenge. Sailing all of his life and in all of the most important events in the world, he explains that the only event he has not participated in is The America's Cup. An Olympic sailor, with an older brother that shared sailing experiences with him from a very young age, this is a very special race and a very special project for him. Santella states, \"These projects keep me alive,\" referring to the passion and curiosity surrounding innovative new builds like this.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nSantella says he first became curious about these hydrogen foiling catamarans two years ago, imagining flying over the chop, the waves, smoothly and silently. He had never been on one, save for that on a foiling board.\nCaptured by the challenge of the project Santella gathered an impressive talent pool, putting himself and Mirko Oprandi on design, Philippe Briand on hull design, and Francis Hueber and Mario Caponnetto on foils design. He then engaged Gurit Engineering for the composite structures, bringing Paolo Manganelli, Harry Gillies Ripoll, and Steve Shaw on board.\nTo ensure each component was the best it could be, Santella also brought in Edoardo Bianchi to manage composites, Gianni and Paolo Cariboni and Pierluca Bartolotto on mechatronics, Paolo Bertelli for the power training component, and Enrico Dari for R & D, Computer Graphic Technology, and EODev, Energy Observer Developments. Santella also relied on Paolo Dassi as project manager. This highly experienced, well-respected collection of top, cutting-edge talent went to work, creating what Santella envisions will be the finest, most technically advanced chase boat at the race.\nAn Important Marine Business Component\nWhile these unique craft may be just another interesting part of this epic competition, Santella feels it was a very smart marine business move to include the advanced technology for the chase boats. Foiling will absolutely become a part of mainstream marine design, Santella says, adding that it may take a little longer for the hydrogen propulsion to become popular.\n\"It is a very delicate and complex matter, and the network is still very, very much at the beginning,\" Santella states, but adds, \"regarding the foils, I am really a fan of it, and looking forward to it. We are already working on a project at Bluegame. We will have a 45-foot foiling catamaran. It won't be a high tech foiling boat like we see in the chase boat, but still it will be a foiling boat.\"\nTransitioning From Race Course Concept To Day Cruiser\nAfter the excitement of watching these chase boats at the America's Cup, there is bound to be interest generated by their quick, quiet presence. If someone comes up to Santella after the race inquiring about their own personal version of the boat, he says that it would be expensive, but Bluegame would absolutely be able to deliver. \"Yes, yes, well ... you see, it's a lot of money, but it can be a very unique toy for really special guys, so why not?\"\nSantella says that he has already thought about the evolution of the same boat to make it suitable for use with a superyacht. It can be avant garde, high tech eye candy for even the edgiest, most well-equipped superyachts.\nWith regard to the need for training to assure competent captains, Santella equates driving the foiling HSV with driving a Ferrari. There might be a learning curve, he says, but with minimal instruction and a small practice session an experienced captain can easily fly the boat, especially since flying is controlled 100 percent by software.\n\"We do practice our captains with our normal boats. I share my knowhow with captains so they can drive safely and so that we can be proud of our boats in their hands,\" Santella assures. He adds that on the production version, speeds might be limited to 40 knots.\nWe are moving the technology, the knowhow, the experience on the chase boats into production, giving a sense to the investment in time, money and energy on this project.\"\nLooking Ahead To Barcelona\nSantella smiles, noting that he is most looking forward to seeing the BGHSVs shine as the best on the water, along with American Magic winning the cup. As far as the race itself, Santella acknowledges that it will be different from the previous race in New Zealand.\n\"We will see a different sailing compared to the one in New Zealand because New Zealand was very protected seawater, very flat, no waves. Barcelona is very different, so we can have varied conditions, waves, flat water, anything.\"\nAmerican Magic and her BGHSV are ready. The best engineers, the best technicians, the most precise mechanical parts, the complicated software, all have come together to create an very able craft.\nRegarding his latest accomplishments on this high tech foiling hydrogen catamaran chase boat, Santella says, \"Now I am really proud that my boat can be in the America's Cup.\""
