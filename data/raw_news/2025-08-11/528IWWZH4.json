      "text": "Nintendo's highly anticipated Switch 2 was released a few days ago, and many gamers have already been having a blast. Compared to the previous Switch, there are some good upgrades and new features. However, some discrepancies have been found in Nintendo's claims regarding the console, like camera compatibility. A camera is used for GameChat video chats and camera modes for games that support that feature.\nNintendo claims the Switch 2 only works with USB-C cameras. But after trying it out, many gamers found that USB A 2.0 cameras, phones and capture cards are also compatible. Here's a list of all the cameras you can use with your new Nintendo Switch 2. And many of them are on sale, if you were thinking about picking one up.\nUSB-C Cameras for Nintendo Switch 2\nSamsung's Slim Fit USB-C camera has a unique tilting design, ensuring you get the perfect video angle. Its slim profile also makes it pretty compact, offering no distractions while you play.\nMore compatible UBC-C cameras:\n- Logitech StreamCam Full HD webcam: $140 (save $30)\n- Logitech MX Brio cam: $200\n- Emeet Piko dual-camera Al-powered 4K webcam: $65 (save $11)\n- Hori Nintendo Switch 2 Piranha Plant camera: $60\n- Nintendo Switch 2 camera: $55\nUSB-A 2.0 Cameras for Nintendo Switch 2\nLogitech's USB-A camera has a full HD 1080p webcam with auto-light balance, integrated privacy shutter and a built-in mic. It also has a fixed focus lens with an antireflective coating.\nMore compatible USB-A 2.0 cameras:\n- Lenovo Creative Live! Cam Sync V3 2K QHD Webcam: $47 (save $3)\n- Emeet C960 webcam: $32 (save $18 with on-page coupon)\n- onn. Webcam with Ring Light: $30\n- Logitech C270 HD Webcam: $20 (save $10)\n- Razer Kiyo Pro cam: $130 (save $70)\nConnecting Phones and Capture Cards\nA UVC-compatible capture card like this one can transmit video over USB. And you can stream at a pretty high quality, since it's 4K compatible. The device also has a plug-and-play design, a USB Type-A connector and an HDMI port.\nMore compatible capture cards and accessories:\n- Papeaso video capture card: $18 (save $1)\n- JSAUX USB-C to HDMI Cable: $8 (save $5 with code PQTIMGIY)\n- Elgato HD60 X Game capture card: $150 (save $30)\n- Anker 3-foot USB-C to HDMI cable: $14 (save $4)\n- Acer 6.6-foot USB-C to HDMI cable: $12 (save $5)\n- Best Buy essentials 6-foot USB-C to HDMI cable: $20\nThere are many selections if you're purchasing a camera to go with your Switch 2. Although the camera isn't required for the device, our expert reviewer Scott Stein says, \"The camera is turning out to be pretty fun, too, and it's one of the best early party tricks.\" With some options starting at $20, it's worth a try.\nHow do we know these cameras work with the Nintendo Switch 2?\nOur dedicated shopping staff member Aashna Gheewalla has tested the Logitech C920 and faith-tested the C922 for compatibility.\nCan you use a USB-C camera with adapters to plug it into the USB-A port on the dock?\nMost iPhones and some Androids might function as webcams with the right cables and adapters, according to this YouTube tutorial from Will It Work? According to this tutorial, as well as countless Redditors who've tinkered with their iPhones and Androids, you should be able to use a USB-C to HDMI cable to plug your phone into the dock of your Nintendo Switch 2.\nKeep in mind that Apple users might have to download an app such as True Visage (says Will It Work) to use their phones as a webcam. Whether you have an Apple or an Android, it's also a good idea to plug your phone into a power source to ensure your battery doesn't run out of juice as you play."

We'll be keeping a close eye on stocks as they fluctuate in the coming days so be sure to check this page often for the latest on availability.\nRead more: How Nintendo Is Combating Switch 2 Scalpers\nHow much does the Nintendo Switch 2 cost?\nThere was some concern that the new US tariffs were going to lead to some significant price hikes on the standalone console and the Mario Kart World bundle. Fortunately, Nintendo has confirmed that the original pricing still stands. The console is available for $450, with the Mario Kart World bundle priced at $500. However, there has been a change to the price of some accessories, with some increasing by $5.\nWill the Nintendo Switch 2 come in other colors?\nFor the new Switch 2, Nintendo has ditched the colored Joy-Cons for a more sleek, monochrome look -- although there are still pops of red and blue around the analog sticks. As of now, Nintendo hasn't said anything about additional colors. Additionally, it's rumored that Samsung -- which makes the displays for the Switch 2 -- is pushing for an OLED version of the console.\nIs the Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World Bundle worth it?\nThe Mario Kart series has been a long-standing tentpole for Nintendo and fans were thrilled to hear that a new title would be accompanying the new console. But the excitement was dampened by the announcement that the new game will come with an increased price tag: $80 for the digital edition or $90 if you want a physical copy. However, you can bundle a digital copy with the console for $500 total, which saves you $30 compared with buying them separately. It's an excellent value if it's a game you're certain you want in your library and likely the only \"discount\" we'll see on this title for quite some time. Plus, Nintendo recently announced that this bundle will be available only \"through fall 2025,\" which means you'll have a limited chance to take advantage of these savings.\nNintendo Switch 2: What are people saying?\nThere are still some mixed feelings about Nintendo's newest console. While some are happy to see that Nintendo hasn't altered much about the wildly popular original Switch, others feel not enough has changed to justify the $150 price hike -- with CNET gaming expert Scott Stein calling it a console that \"feels a lot like an updated version of a system many people already own.\" The confirmation that the US tariffs won't be leading to any further price increases has helped stifle gamers' exasperation a bit, but many are still unhappy with the fact that select games will be selling for up to $20 more than the standard $60. We're eager to see if most gamers consider the price hikes worth it now that they're finally getting their hands on the new console and games."
