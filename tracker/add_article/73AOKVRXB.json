      "summary": "Stocks opened higher but the Nasdaq 100 struggled after Nvidia’s tepid Q2 earnings, which saw slower growth and no sales to China, raising concerns that AI demand may be plateauing. Several tech and consumer companies reported earnings that beat or matched expectations, yet some shares fell due to outlook cuts or tariff worries. Macro data and Fed policy dominated market sentiment, with investors pricing in faster rate cuts amid concerns over the Fed’s independence and Trump’s attempt to fire a governor. Commodity prices moved modestly, with oil easing on supply‑glut fears and gold holding steady amid inflation worries. Corporate news included Berkshire Hathaway’s increased stake in Mitsubishi, HP’s AI‑PC sales growth, and Pernod Ricard’s outlook for improved sales in the second half of fiscal 2026.",
