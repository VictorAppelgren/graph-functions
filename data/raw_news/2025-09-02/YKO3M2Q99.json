  "description": "President Donald Trump announced plans to move Space Command's headquarters to Alabama, after former President Joe Biden announced it would stay in Colorado.",
  "content": "President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that Space Command\u2019s headquarters would move from Colorado to Alabama \u2014 capping off a yearslong fight over where the command should be based. While Space Command has been operating out of Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Trump has historically pushed for the command\u2019s headquarters to move to Huntsville, Alabama. However, former President Joe Biden announced in 2023 that the command would remain based in Colorado. RENAMED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE COMING \u2018SOON,' TRUMP SAYSSpeculation that Trump would announce a move for Space Command increased after the agency initially posted a livestream link for Trump\u2019s 2 p.m. announcement with a description that the event was related to Space Command\u2019s headquarters. The description was subsequently updated to remove the mention of Space Command.TRUMP'S WHIRLWIND WEEK AHEAD TO INCLUDE MEETING WITH NATO CHIEF, 'MAJOR' ANNOUNCEMENT ON RUSSIAThe announcement comes as both Colorado and Alabama have been vying to house Space Command, which Trump reestablished in 2019 as a new combatant command to oversee U.S. military space operations and is currently involved in Trump's Golden Dome initiative. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital when asked about Space Command\u2019s headquarters. Proponents of keeping Space Command at Colorado's Peterson Space Force Base argue that it would be costly to move the headquarters, given the investment already put into Peterson to accommodate the command there. However, the Air Force concluded in 2021 that Army Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, would be the ideal location for U.S. Space Command. The town is also home to NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center and the Army\u2019s Space and Missile Defense Command. Meanwhile, a Department of Defense inspector general report released in April could not identify why Colorado was chosen over Alabama. Fox News\u2019 Jacqui Heinrich contributed to this report.",

The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump. Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022.

Trump spent the anniversary at his home in Bedminster, N.J., before traveling with first lady Melania Trump to the FIFA Club World Cup final on Sunday at MetLife Stadium in the Garden State.\nTrump returned to the White House on Sunday evening and is expected to have another whirlwind workweek.\nMEETING WITH NATO CHIEF\nTrump will meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte this week following the U.S. president saying last week that the U.S. is selling weapons to its NATO allies for them to be passed along to Ukraine as it continues battling Russia.\nThe NATO chief will be in Washington, D.C., on Monday and Tuesday, and will meet with Trump, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, according to The Associated Press. Additional details on the meetings, however, have not yet been publicly released.\nRepublican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that Ukraine can expect to see an influx of weapons. Russia first invaded Ukraine in February of 2022.\nRUSSIA GIVES RUBIO A 'NEW AND DIFFERENT APPROACH' AS TRUMP PUSHES FOR PEACE WITH UKRAINE\n\"In the coming days, you\u2019ll see weapons flowing at a record level to help Ukraine defend themselves,\" Graham said on CBS\u2019 \"Face the Nation.\n\"One of the biggest miscalculations Putin has made is to play Trump. And you just watch, in the coming days and weeks, there\u2019s going to be a massive effort to get Putin to the table.\"\nTrump and Rutte most recently met in the Netherlands in June for a summit, where the NATO chief showed the makings of a blossoming friendship with Trump, including referring to Trump as \"daddy\" for his handling of the Middle East.\n\u2018MAJOR' RUSSIA ANNOUNCEMENT\nTrump teased last week that he would make a \"major statement\" on Russia in the coming days as the NATO meetings prepare to kick off this week.\n\"I'm disappointed in Russia, but we'll see what happens over the next couple of weeks,\" Trump told NBC last week.\n\"I think I\u2019ll have a major statement to make on Russia on Monday,\" he added, without elaborating.\nRUSSIA SANCTIONS BILL GAINS STEAM AS WHITE HOUSE APPEARS TO CHANGE TONE ON PUTIN\nGraham said in his interview on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that \"a turning point regarding [the Russian] invasion of Ukraine is coming,\" as Congress works to impose new economic sanctions on Russia to help end the war.\n\"For months, President Trump has tried to entice [Russian President Vladimir] Putin to the peace table. He's put tariffs against countries that allow fentanyl to come in our country, other bad behavior \u2014 he's left the door open regarding Russia. That door is about to close,\" Graham said on Sunday.\nTRUMP HEADS TO ENERGY AND AI SUMMIT\nTrump will head to Pittsburgh on Tuesday for Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Dave McCormick's inaugural Energy and Innovation Summit hosted at Carnegie Mellon University.\nTRUMP TO MEET WITH ENERGY AND TECH TITANS IN PENNSYLVANIA AMID AI DOMINANCE PUSH\nThe event is slated to focus on the U.S. power grid, America bid to win the AI race against China, as well as promoting the Keystone State as an ideal resource to help power the country's future with AI and energy.\n\"The United States needs to win the artificial intelligence fight. We have to stop China, and we have to win this war for dominance in AI. And the way you win the war for dominance in AI is to win the war for energy dominance. That's why our focus is on producing more here in the United States,\" said Mike Sommers, CEO and president of the American Petroleum Institute who will attend the summit, told FOX Business of the event.\n\"Over the course of the last few years, energy demand has only gone up by about 2.5% a year. In the next seven years, we expect that energy demand is going to go up by 25%. The question that policymakers have to answer is: \u2018Where is that energy going to come from?\u2019 We think it should come from the United States,\" Sommers added.\nThe event is expected to attract protesters, with Carnegie Mellon's president calling on the school community to continue its history of \"constructively engaging\" with presidencies across the \"political spectrum.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"We have a history of constructively engaging with the federal government and administrations across the political spectrum. We view these opportunities as consequential to elevating and advancing both Carnegie Mellon\u2019s mission and impact, and we bring to those moments the full measure of our expertise, our values and our voice in service to the nation,\" school president Farnam Jahanian said in a letter previewing the event on Sunday.\nFox News Digital's Amanda Macias contributed to this report."

During his own presidency, the Biden-Harris administration prioritized issues such as climate change, Medicaid, infrastructure and LGBTQ+ initiatives.\nDuring the 2024 campaign cycle, Biden ran as the original Democratic nominee. Following his first presidential debate with Donald Trump, Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed his vice president at the time, Kamala Harris, for president. Harris lost the election, with many voters voicing concerns over immigration, border security and the economy as reasons for casting their votes for the Republican presidential candidate, President Donald Trump.\nAfter leaving office, Biden has largely kept to himself but has remained a topic of conversation in politics, mainly regarding his health, which was questioned throughout his presidency. Investigations and allegations of a cover-up regarding the truth of Biden\u2019s physical and mental well-being during his time in the White House have been brought forward.\nBiden\u2019s family has also been in the spotlight over the years, facing both tragedy and controversy. He lost his first wife, Neilia Hunter Biden, and his daughter, Naomi Biden, in a car accident in 1972. He later married Jill Biden in 1977. In 2015, his son Beau Biden died after a battle with brain cancer.\nBiden\u2019s other son, Hunter Biden, has faced personal battles with addiction over the years and has been at the center of numerous legal investigations, including over the contents of his laptop.

You want to know the truth? I think we're going to have some information on that, maybe soon,\" Trump added.\n\"But I think because, you know, Department of Defense, we won the World War I, World War II.
