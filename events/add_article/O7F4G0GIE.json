      "title": "Sharks Mark Cuban and Rashaun Williams Secrets to Raising Capital",
      "summary": "Mark Cuban and Rashaun Williams counsel entrepreneurs to prioritize customers, sales, and profitability before seeking external funding, warning that chasing capital without proven demand is a common mistake. Cuban stresses the value of sweat equity, cutting personal expenses, and fully understanding the obligations that come with investment. Williams distills the funding challenge into three barriers—net worth, network, and traction—and recommends early self-funding, leveraging friends, family, angels, or crowdfunding to build traction. Both agree that learning from experienced founders and attending events like the Clover x Shark Tank Summit can be pivotal for building a solid, sustainable business.",
