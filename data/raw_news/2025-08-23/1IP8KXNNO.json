  "content": "Why: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Capricor Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: CAPR) between October 9, 2024 and July 10, 2025, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"), of the important September 15, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.\n\nSo what: If you purchased Capricor securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\n\nWhat to do next: To join the Capricor class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=42281 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 15, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWhy Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDetails of the case: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants provided investors with material information concerning deramiocel, Capricor's lead cell therapy candidate drug for the treatment of cardiomyopathy associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Defendants' statements included, among other things, Capricor's ability to obtain a Biologics License Application (BLA) for deramiocel from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Further, defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning its four-year safety and efficacy data from its Phase 2 HOPE-2 trial study of deramiocel. The lawsuit alleges this caused shareholders to purchase Capricor's securities at artificially inflated prices. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the Capricor class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=42281 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm, on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm/.",

Class actions allow a court to decide the claims of many investors in a single lawsuit. This promotes efficiency, economy, and extends justice to investors whose claims are not large enough to merit an individual lawsuit.\nThis is the time period during which investors purchased securities in the company that is the subject of the class action. Typically, the false statements or fraud begin on the first day of the class period and the full truth about the false statements or fraud is revealed on the last day of the class period.\nA lead plaintiff is an investor that wishes to serve as a representative plaintiff in the class action on behalf of all the other investors that purchased securities during the Class Period.\nThe Lead Plaintiff\u2019s role is to oversee the litigation with the assistance and advice of the class\u2019s attorneys. Both the Lead Plaintiff and the class\u2019s attorneys must direct the litigation for the benefit of the class foremost. Ultimately, it is the job of the Lead Plaintiff to decide what is a fair settlement amount for the Class and to approve any settlement offer.\nLead Counsel are the Class\u2019s attorneys. The Lead Plaintiff selects the Lead Counsel. Lead Counsel should have extensive experience prosecuting securities class actions if they are to effectively represent investors in a securities class action.\nIf the amount of your losses in the investment are significant to you, being a lead plaintiff allows you to be involved in the case and oversee important decisions in the litigation, particularly the amount of any settlement for investors.\nClass action lawsuits often are filed when it would be impractical or prohibitively expensive for each person who was harmed to file an individual lawsuit, and they enable small shareholders or consumers to seek recovery from large corporations possessing much greater legal and financial resources. Generally, securities class actions are filed in the Federal District Courts and allege that the defendant(s) violated the Securities Act of 1933 and/or the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The typical class action takes at least 2-3 years to litigate, although the actual time it takes to resolve a case varies, depending on the complexity of the case, the issues involved, and other factors.\nYou can complete the online certification form on our website or at your request, we will email you a form to complete and you can send it back to us.\nYou do not pay any legal fees, costs or expenses. The Court will award the Lead Counsel any legal fees, costs or expenses from the money they recover for the class. If Lead Counsel doesn\u2019t recover any money for the class, Lead Counsel doesn\u2019t get paid any legal fees, costs or expenses.\nOur Offices\nNew York\n275 Madison Avenue,\n40th Floor\nNew York, NY 10016\nT: 212.686.1060\nF: 212.202.3827\nLos Angeles\n355 South Grand Avenue, Suite 2450\nLos Angeles, CA 90071\nT: 213.785.2610\nF: 213.226.4684\nPhiladelphia Metro\n101 Greenwood Avenue,\nSuite 440\nJenkintown, PA 19046\nT: 215.600.2817\nF: 212.202.3827\nNew Jersey\nOne Gateway Center,\nSuite 2600\nNewark, NJ 07102\nT: 973.313.1887\nF: 973.833.0399\nGet a Free Consultation\nThe Rosen Law Firm is dedicated exclusively to recovering investment losses for investors in companies that have misrepresented material aspects of their business or whose officers and directors have breached their fiduciary duties to shareholders."

In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\nDetails of the case: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants provided investors with material information concerning deramiocel, Capricor's lead cell therapy candidate drug for the treatment of cardiomyopathy associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Defendants' statements included, among other things, Capricor's ability to obtain a Biologics License Application (BLA) for deramiocel from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Further, defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning its four-year safety and efficacy data from its Phase 2 HOPE-2 trial study of deramiocel. The lawsuit alleges this caused shareholders to purchase Capricor's securities at artificially inflated prices. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\nTo join the Capricor class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=42281 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email [email protected] for more information.\nNo Class Has Been Certified.
