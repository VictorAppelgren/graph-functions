  "title": "How Airlines Will Use AI To Charge You More \u2014 and 8 Ways To Outsmart Them",
  "description": "Even though AI could make your next trip more expensive, there are still a few ways to outsmart the system and get a fairer price.",
  "content": "You\u2019ve been using AI for your shopping list, vacation itinerary or to create cartoon versions of yourself. Major airlines, however, are using AI to rake in more profits. Airlines like Delta are beginning to use generative AI to analyze your search habits and set a price based on what it thinks you\u2019ll be willing to pay.\n\nFor You: 5 Google Flights Tricks To Help You Land the Cheapest Holiday Airfare\n\nTrending Now: 4 Low-Risk Ways To Build Your Savings in 2025\n\nEven though AI could make your next trip more expensive, there are still a few ways to outsmart the system and get a fairer price.\n\nDuring the Q&A portion of an earnings call, Delta Airlines president Glen William Hauenstein, shared that Delta is continuing to experiment and roll out dynamic AI pricing for flights using an AI startup, Fetcherr. Currently, 3% of domestic Delta flights have their prices set using generative AI. By the end of 2025, Delta plans to increase that to 20% of all domestic flights. \u201cWe\u2019re in a heavy testing phase. We like what we see. We like it a lot and we\u2019re continuing to roll it out,\u201d Hauenstein said.\n\nCheck Out: 10 Airline Rewards Programs That Provide the Most Value for Your Points\n\nFor consumers, that means airlines like Delta and potentially others are using your personal data to determine how much you\u2019ll pay for your next flight. That could include your login status, social media activity, previous booking history, search frequency, financial status and IP location, according to the FTC. It also means that you could see drastically different prices based on each individual\u2019s online habits.\n\nIn response to news of Delta\u2019s AI individualized pricing, three senators released a public letter voicing their criticism and concerns regarding this practice. Senators Ruben Gallego, Mark Warner and Richard Blumenthal penned a letter to the CEO of Delta Air Lines in July, chastising the use of surveillance-based pricing models and demanding answers on how the AI system is being trained and what personal data is being used.\n\n\u201cPrices could be dictated not by supply and demand, but by individual need,\u201d the senators wrote in the letter. So if you needed a flight to see a sick family member and the airline\u2019s AI was fed that information, you may see higher prices when searching for tickets. Or if the AI is fed your income data and knows you make above a certain amount, you could regularly be charged more than others are paying.\n\n\u201cWhile Delta has stated that the airline will \u2018maintain strict safeguards to ensure compliance with federal law,\u2019 your company has not shared what those safeguards are or how you plan to protect American families against pricing discrimination in the evolving AI landscape,\u201d the senators wrote.\n\nEscaping surveillance pricing requires you to take some extra steps before booking your next flight. You can still find neutral prices without having your personal data used against you by taking these precautions:\n\u2022 Use a VPN to help hide your identity\n\u2022 Use a different device to compare prices\n\u2022 Book directly with the airline. Third-party sites may collect more data.\n\nAirlines have a vested interest in raising their profits and with AI fueling the pricing models, it could take more money out of your pocket the next time you search for tickets. Level the playing field by protecting your personal data.\n\u2022 6 Costco Products That Have the Most Customer Complaints\n\u2022 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up to $1K Per Month From Home\n\u2022 4 Low-Risk Ways To Build Your Savings in 2025\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Airlines Will Use AI To Charge You More \u2014 and 8 Ways To Outsmart Them",

      "text": "6 Low-Risk Accounts Financially Savvy People Trust for Reliable Returns \u2013 And How You Can Use Them\nNot everyone has the same risk appetite. While some people are comfortable with lots of volatility, others are just looking for a way to earn steady, reliable returns without taking big chances with their hard-earned money.\nIf you\u2019re interested in putting your money to work for you while still protecting your capital, these are some tried-and-tested low-risk accounts that financially savvy people trust for steady growth. See how you can use them, too.\n1. Annuities\nAn annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company that promises you a future payout in regular installments, usually monthly and often for life. Annuities are a low-risk, long-term option financially savvy people use to ensure a reliable income during retirement.\nWith the Gainbridge\u00ae FastBreak\u2122 annuity, you\u2019ll earn up to APY**, which is more than 13 times the national average for a savings account.\nWhy It\u2019s Savvy:\n- Annuities offer guaranteed payments, which can be structured to last for a set number of years or for the rest of your life.\n- The Gainbridge\u00ae FastBreak\u2122 annuity pays you up to APY** on your investment.\n- Unlike traditional investments like stocks, annuities protect your capital from market volatility, making them a secure way to ensure long-term income.\nHow You Can Use It:\n- Consider annuities as part of your retirement planning, particularly if you\u2019re looking for a guaranteed income stream after you stop working.\n- Look for annuities that offer favorable interest rates and low fees.\nWant to start growing your money 13 times faster* than if you kept it in a savings account? The Gainbridge FastBreak\u2122 annuity is self-directed, easy to set up and comes with 30 days to cancel your contract if you change your mind.\nGet started here to lock in guaranteed income in retirement and start earning up to APY.**\n2. High-Yield Savings Accounts \u2014 Earn Up to 11x the National Average, Plus a $500 Bonus\nMost people have a savings account. But too many people keep their money in a savings account that isn\u2019t growing their money as fast as it could be. As of June 16, 2025, the national average interest rate on a savings account was just 0.38%.\nRaisin, a digital marketplace, makes it easy to find a high-yield savings account with an APY as high as 4.31% \u2014 more than 11 times the national average.\nWhy It\u2019s Savvy:\n- When you open an account and deposit funds, you can earn a welcome bonus of up to $500. The more you deposit, the more you can earn.\n- You can browse high-APY offers from more than 70 banks and credit unions \u2014 many of them with rates significantly higher than the national average.\n- You can access your money whenever you need to without penalties.\n- Many savings accounts are FDIC-insured, which means your deposits are protected up to $250,000 in case of bank failure.\nHow You Can Use It:\n- Look for online banks or credit unions that offer higher APYs, often well above the national average.\n- Use your savings account for short- to medium-term goals, where you might need quick access to funds, like an emergency fund or saving for a vacation.\nWant to start growing your money more than 11 times faster than the average checking account? It only takes a few minutes to open an account. Plus, once you deposit funds, you can earn a signup bonus of up to $500.\n3. Invest in Real-Estate Loans \u2014 and Earn 8.1% in Dividends\nLoaning people money and charging interest is one of the ways large institutions and the ultra-wealthy earn passive income. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s typically available to the average person.\nBut with the Arrived Private Credit Fund, you can invest in a portfolio of real-estate loans that pay dividends monthly \u2014 with a historic yield of 8.10% annualized dividends.\nWhy It\u2019s Savvy:\n- Arrived is a platform backed by Jeff Bezos, Marc Benioff, and other top-tier investors, with more than 800,000 registered users and nearly $300 million invested.\n- This has historically yielded investors 8.10% annualized dividends.\nHow You Can Use It:\n- You\u2019ll invest in a diversified portfolio of loans across the U.S. that help fund renovations, rehabs, and new home construction. As borrowers pay the loan back, the interest is distributed among investors like you on a monthly basis.\n- Historically, this has yielded investors 8.10% annualized dividends.\nWant to start earning passive income like the ultra-wealthy do? It\u2019s simple to get started here and see how much you could earn.\n4. Financial Planners \u2014 You Can Get Matched With One For Free\nWorking with a financial planner can be one of the best things you can do to help reduce risk and boost returns.\nIn fact, According to a Northwestern Mutual study, advice from a professional financial advisor can boost your lifetime investment returns by as much as double, compared to doing it on your own*.\nYet only about one in three Americans actually partner with an advisor. Luckily, a company called WiserAdvisor will match you with a financial advisor in your area \u2014 for free.\nWhy It\u2019s Savvy:\n- Working with a professional financial advisor can boost your lifetime investment returns by as much as double.\n- No two people have the same financial situation, which is why WiserAdvisor matches you with the best financial advisor for your specific situation, so you get an expert in the areas you need.\n- There\u2019s no obligation to hire the advisor, and WiserAdvisor screens every advisor to make sure you\u2019re only getting matched with the best experts.\nHow You Can Use It:\n- Get a customized financial plan tailored to your specific needs and goals.\n- Get advice on your most pressing money concerns around retirement, investing and more.\nWant to get a customized financial plan? Just start here to get matched with a financial advisor for free.\n5. Gold\nIf the past few years have shown us anything, it\u2019s that disruptions to the market can come out of nowhere. Between the pandemic, supply-chain issues and bear markets, a lot of people\u2019s retirement savings felt the impact.\nThat\u2019s why it can be a smart idea to look for ways to protect your retirement savings from the unpredictable. For a lot of people, investing in gold and precious metals is a way to diversify and protect their investments.\nWhy It\u2019s Savvy:\n- Investing in precious metals like gold and silver can help diversify your portfolio and protect you against market volatility.\n- Precious metals often outperform other investments in a volatile market, and their value tends to rise with inflation, making them an effective hedge during uncertain economic times.\n- Gold has historically maintained its value.\nHow You Can Use It:\n- One way to invest is with a precious metals IRA.\n- When you open a gold or silver IRA, you can typically roll over funds from existing retirement accounts. Or you can buy gold and silver directly from the precious metals dealer.\n- Worried you may need to sell your precious metals in the future? Many dealers offer buyback commitments and will purchase your assets back from you at the highest price.\nGet Started:\nWant to diversify your portfolio and hedge against economic uncertainty?

      "text": "I Asked ChatGPT the Best Travel Hacks To Save Money in 2025: Here\u2019s What It Said\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nWith travel costs steadily rising, I decided to tap into artificial intelligence for some money-saving wisdom. I asked ChatGPT for the best travel hacks to save money this year, and the AI delivered a comprehensive guide that goes way beyond the usual \u201cbook in advance\u201d advice.\nHere\u2019s what ChatGPT told me about cutting travel costs without sacrificing the experience.\nThe Flight Game Has Changed\nChatGPT\u2019s first revelation was that flight booking strategies have majorly evolved. The AI recommended using \u201cAI-powered fare alerts\u201d through tools like Google Flights, Hopper and Skyscanner, explaining that these platforms now \u201cpredict price drops and track deals in real-time.\u201d\nBut the most interesting tip was about browser extensions. ChatGPT suggested TravelArrow, a Chrome extension that \u201cshows cheaper options from other sites right inside Google Flights.\u201d This kind of comparison shopping automation wasn\u2019t available just a few years ago.\nThe AI also confirmed that some old-school wisdom still holds true: \u201cData from Expedia and ARC shows Sunday is still the cheapest day to book, especially for international trips.\u201d For actual travel days, ChatGPT recommended Tuesday and Wednesday flights while warning to \u201cavoid Fridays and Sundays, which are now spiking again due to post-pandemic travel demand.\u201d\nThe VPN Strategy That Actually Works\nOne of ChatGPT\u2019s more sophisticated suggestions involved using VPNs to search for flights. \u201cAirfare pricing sometimes varies by location,\u201d the AI explained. \u201cSwitch your virtual location to India, Mexico or Eastern Europe and compare.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t just theoretical advice \u2014 airlines do practice location-based pricing, and a VPN can sometimes reveal significantly cheaper fares for the exact same flights.\nChatGPT also recommended mixing and matching airlines or airports, suggesting sites like Kiwi.com or Skiplagged for \u201chidden city\u201d tickets or separate one-way legs that are cheaper than round trips.\nCredit Card Points Get Strategic\nThe AI\u2019s approach to credit card rewards is strategic. Instead of just suggesting any travel card, ChatGPT recommended maximizing \u201ccredit card points using portals like Chase Ultimate Rewards, Amex Travel or Capital One Travel.\u201d\nThe key insight? \u201cThese often give 25-50% extra value per point when redeemed for travel.\u201d This is a much better idea than simply cashing out points or using them for non-travel purchases.\nFor actual travel cards, ChatGPT suggested specific options like \u201cChase Sapphire Preferred, Capital One Venture X or Amex Platinum for travel perks plus no foreign transaction fees,\u201d writing that some offer \u201cairport lounge access, travel insurance or TSA PreCheck reimbursements.\u201d This means you can travel in style, for less.\nHotel Booking Gets Smarter\nChatGPT\u2019s hotel strategy challenged the conventional wisdom of always booking through third-party sites. The AI recommended comparing prices on \u201cKayak or Trivago, then book directly with the hotel.\u201d\nWhy? \u201cMost chains now offer a \u2018price match guarantee\u2019 and perks like free Wi-Fi or upgrades when booking direct.\u201d This is different from how things used to work, when booking sites like Expedia always had the cheapest prices.\nFor alternative accommodations, ChatGPT went beyond the usual Airbnb suggestion, recommending \u201cTrustedHousesitters for free stays in exchange for pet sitting\u201d and platforms like \u201cSabbaticalHomes or HomeExchange\u201d for longer trips.\nThe AI also shared a clever Airbnb hack: \u201cNew hosts often price 20-30% lower to get early reviews. Filter for listings with 0-3 reviews and recent host activity.\u201d\nTechnology Makes Travel Cheaper\nChatGPT recommended several newer tech options to save money. For staying connected abroad, the AI suggested eSIMs from companies like \u201cAiralo, Holafly, or Nomad\u201d instead of buying new SIM cards or paying expensive roaming charges.\nThe AI also recommended downloading apps that work better in certain places: \u201cUse Bolt or Grab instead of Uber in Eastern Europe or Southeast Asia, TooGoodToGo to find cheap leftover meals and Rome2Rio to figure out the best way to get around.\u201d\nLocal Experiences Without Tourist Prices\nFor food and things to do, ChatGPT focused on finding real local spots that cost less. The AI suggested using \u201cGoogle Maps > Restaurants > \u2018Local favorites'\u201d or checking \u201cThe Infatuation to find places locals actually go to.\u201d\nInstead of pricey tourist restaurants, ChatGPT recommended \u201cfood halls, street vendors, or markets.\u201d For activities, the AI suggested free walking tours that you can find in \u201cmost big cities\u201d on sites like \u201cGuruWalk, FreeTour.com, or just ask at local hostels.\u201d\nThings To Keep in Mind\nDespite all the technological advances, ChatGPT confirmed that timing is still key. The AI recommended traveling during \u201cspring (April-May) and fall (late September-November)\u201d for better weather and savings while avoiding \u201crevenge travel peaks like summer, Christmas and Spring Break.\u201d\nChatGPT also addressed the increasingly expensive reality of airline fees, writing that \u201cairlines are cracking down on basic economy bag fees.\u201d The solution? \u201cStick to a carry-on and personal item when possible\u201d and use \u201cpacking cubes and compression bags to maximize space.\u201d\nPerhaps most cleverly, ChatGPT suggested setting up \u201cGoogle Alerts for destinations\u201d with searches like \u201ccheap flights to Tokyo\u201d or \u201chotel deals in Croatia\u201d to \u201cget notified when blogs or forums share deals.\u201d\nThis kind of passive deal hunting can catch time-sensitive offers that manual searching might miss. Nice work, ChatGPT!\nThe Bottom Line\nWhat impressed me most about ChatGPT\u2019s travel advice was how it mixed old-school tricks with new tech solutions. The AI didn\u2019t just repeat the same old travel tips. Instead, it gave me an updated guide for 2025 that shows how both technology and travel have changed.\nCombining things like AI flight tracking, smart credit card choices, using VPNs to find better prices and clever hotel booking creates a complete money-saving approach that just wasn\u2019t possible a few years ago.\nChatGPT even offered to make \u201ca cheat sheet to save or share\u201d or customize the advice \u201cfor different types of trips (solo, family, Europe, etc.)\u201d \u2014 showing that even while giving money-saving tips, the AI was thinking about making it easy and personal for users.\nWhether you\u2019re planning a quick weekend trip or a long adventure, ChatGPT\u2019s 2025 travel guide shows that with the right tools and strategies, you don\u2019t have to pick between seeing the world and sticking to your budget."

      "text": "5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up to $1K Per Month From Home\nWhether your retirement is filled with globe-trotting adventures or quiet days at home with family, chances are your earning power isn\u2019t quite what it used to be. After all, you\u2019re no longer clocking in (thankfully).\nThe freedom is great, but living on a fixed income can be challenging. The good news? Clever retirees are finding ways to earn an extra $1,000 a month \u2014 all from home.\n1. They Grow Their Money More Than 15x Faster \u2014 You Can, Too\nThis one\u2019s almost too easy. If you\u2019re keeping your savings in a traditional savings account, it\u2019s probably not doing much for you. In fact, the latest numbers from the FDIC show that the average savings account only pays 0.38% APY.*\nIf you want to grow your money faster \u2014 15 times faster* \u2014 one option you might consider is the Gainbridge\u00ae FastBreak\u2122 annuity. You\u2019ll earn up to 5.80% APY** on this annuity, which comes with a self-managed platform and the ability to withdraw your money without a tax penalty before age 59 1/2.\nAn annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company that promises you a future payout in regular installments, usually monthly and often for life. The Gainbridge\u00ae FastBreak\u2122 annuity comes in three to 10 year terms, in premiums of $1,000 to $1 million, and you\u2019re able to withdraw up to 10% of the account value each year.**\nThe FastBreak\u2122 annuity is self-directed, easy to set up and comes with 30 days to cancel your contract if you change your mind.\nWant to start growing your money 15 times faster than if you kept it in a savings account? Get started here to start earning up to 5.80% APY**.\n2. They Stopped Wasting $1,025 a Year on Car Insurance\nSometimes, the easiest way to put money in your pocket is to find out where you\u2019re wasting it. And most retirees are seriously overpaying for car insurance \u2014 by as much as $1,025 a year.\nFortunately, Insurify lets you compare all your car insurance options at once \u2014 and it can put an extra $1,025 a year back in your wallet.\nJust enter some basic details about your car and background, you\u2019ll get customized quotes you can review on your own time and from the comfort of home.\nWant to add up to $1,025 back to your wallet this year? It\u2019s easy to get started here and see how much you can save.\n3. They Invest in Real-Estate Loans \u2014 and Earn 8.1% in Dividends\nLoaning people money and charging interest is one of the ways large institutions and the ultra-wealthy earn passive income. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s typically available to the average person.\nBut with the Arrived Private Credit Fund, you can invest in a portfolio of real-estate loans that pay dividends monthly \u2014 with a historic yield of 8.10% annualized dividends.\nArrived is a platform backed by Jeff Bezos, Marc Benioff, and other top-tier investors, with more than 800,000 registered users and nearly $300 million invested.\nHere\u2019s how it works: You\u2019ll invest in a diversified portfolio of loans across the U.S. that help fund renovations, rehabs, and new home construction. As borrowers pay the loan back, the interest is distributed among investors like you on a monthly basis. Historically, this has yielded investors 8.10% annualized dividends.\nWant to start earning passive income like the ultra-wealthy do? It\u2019s simple to get started here and see how much you could earn.\n4. They Grow Their Money More Than 10x Faster (And Earn Up to $500 as a Bonus)\nIf you\u2019re a retiree and you\u2019re keeping your dough in a traditional checking account, you\u2019re not letting it rise to its full potential. You need an account that lets you earn competitive interest on your everyday balance.\nRaisin, a digital marketplace, makes it easy to find a high-yield savings account with an APY as high as 4.31% \u2014 that\u2019s more than 10 times the national average interest on a savings account, which pays just 0.38% APY as of June 16, 2025.\nPlus, when you open an account and deposit funds, you can earn a welcome bonus of up to $500.

It only takes a few minutes to open an account.\n5. They Get Paid $17 a Day to Play Free Games on Their Phone\nThe grandkids might not know it, but you\u2019ve become quite the gamer in your retirement, at least on your phone. If you\u2019re already a pro at Candy Crush or love saving faraway realms from evil wizards, why not get paid for your skills?\nYou can turn that idle time into quick cash \u2014 up to $17 a day, if you use Scrambly.\nScrambly works with developers who want to get their games and apps in front of people just like you, and they\u2019re willing to pay you to try them.

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nHoliday travel can be expensive, but booking with Google Flights can allow you to save money, without a mandatory middle seat or red eye.\nThis tool alone is pretty amazing, but knowing how to use it right can allow you to save even more. Here are five Google Flight tricks you need to know before booking your holiday flights.\nDon\u2019t Fill in the Blanks\nWhen searching for holiday airfare, you might think inputting your destination and preferred travel dates would be one of the first steps. However, TikTok has another idea, according to the New York Post.\nEnter your departure city, type \u201canywhere\u201d in the destination spot and leave your travel dates blank \u2014 you can also add specific filters like non-stop flights, if you prefer. This will present you with a variety of options to choose from, all with prices right in front of you, so it\u2019s easy to compare.\nOf course, since you\u2019re trying to fly during the holidays, you\u2019ll need to add some type of date range. If possible, instead of adding specific dates, opt for flexible dates, selecting December as your travel month, along with either a weekend, one-week or two-week trip.\nUse the \u2018Cheapest\u2019 Tab\nGoogle Flights automatically defaults to the \u201cbest flights,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re the cheapest. Typically, these include features like flying with the same airline, no excessive layovers and no airport transfers.\nHowever, if you\u2019re laser-focused on price, you might be willing to sacrifice convenience for cheap tickets. In this case, take a look at the \u201ccheapest\u201d tab.\nThis will be visible after you choose a destination city. Simply click on \u201cview flights,\u201d then you\u2019ll be taken to a page with \u201cbest\u201d flights on the left and \u201ccheapest\u201d flights on the right.\nSign Up for Flight Alerts\nIf you don\u2019t see any prices that meet your budget yet, sign up for flight alerts. You can track flights on certain dates or flexible dates, then you\u2019ll receive an email when prices change.\nThis will allow you to save time, as you won\u2019t have to check flight prices every day.\nCheck Price Insights\nNo one wants to buy plane tickets when prices are higher than normal. Google Flights offers real-time price insights, so you can better understand ticket prices for your destination and travel dates.\nIf the price falls under green, it\u2019s the least expensive, yellow is moderate and red is the most expensive. Data also includes price history for your flights, so you can see the cheapest and most expensive times to book.\nConsult the Date Grid\nWhen you\u2019ve figured out where you\u2019re headed, you can choose the cheapest dates by using the Google Flights date grid.

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nWhile ChatGPT has its flaws, including rampant hallucinations and an overly solicitous manner, many users have found success asking ChatGPT for travel tips. Often, you can get the best answers from ChatGPT by asking it to explain complex concepts as if you were a 12-year-old.\nTravel hacking, which ChatGPT described as finding tricks and deals to travel for less money or free, is not as simple as you might think. Here\u2019s how ChatGPT explained three common money-saving travel hacks for easy understanding.\nSkiplagging\nChatGPT described skiplagging, also called \u201chidden city ticketing,\u201d as a travel trick some people use to secure cheaper plane tickets. \u201cLet\u2019s say you want to fly from New York to Chicago, but the ticket is really expensive,\u201d ChatPGT said. \u201cA ticket from New York to Denver with a stop in Chicago might be cheaper \u2014 even though it\u2019s a longer trip!\u201d\nInstead of buying a ticket to Chicago, you purchase a ticket to Denver, but get off the plane in Chicago and stay there.\nChatGPT shared a few caveats, as well. For instance, you can\u2019t check a bag because it will go all the way to your destination city. You can\u2019t skiplag with roundtrip tickets, either, because if you miss a portion of your flight, the airline might cancel the rest of your ticket.\nFinally, ChatGPT said, \u201cYou can\u2019t skiplag all the time. Airlines don\u2019t like it, and they might get mad or cancel your tickets if you do it too much.\u201d\nStopover Hack\nChatGPT called \u201cfree stopovers\u201d the positive twin of skiplagging. \u201cIt\u2019s not sneaky or against the rules \u2014 in fact, airlines want you to use it,\u201d the AI said.\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you book a flight from New York to Paris on Icelandair. Instead of flying straight through, you could fly from New York and stop in Reykjavik for three days and then continue to Paris,\u201d ChatGPT explained. \u201cSame price. Two countries. Total win.\u201d\nTo leverage this hack, book directly on the airline\u2019s website, choose a flight with a long layover, and then extend it for a few days.\nIf you combine this hack with hotel rewards or credit card miles, you might even be able to secure a free hotel stay in your stopover city. Some airlines also offer free hotels or city tours when you book a multi-day stopover, ChatGPT shared.\nCredit Card Churning\nMost people know you can use rewards credit cards and frequent flyer miles to travel for free or earn discounted flights and hotel stays. But savvy travel hackers use a trick called \u201ccredit card churning\u201d to earn huge welcome bonuses on cards with no annual fee for the first year, cash in massive rewards, and then cancel the card.\nChurners \u201cplan ahead to make sure they can hit that target without buying random stuff,\u201d ChatGPT said. They use spreadsheets, apps and calendar alerts to keep track of required spending, specific spending categories, and important dates \u2014 like how long they have to earn the bonus and when they should cancel the card.\n\u201cSome travel hackers open three to five new cards per year or more, but only if they can keep up with the rules and spending limits,\u201d ChatGPT said.\nOf course, card churning and other credit card travel hacks only work if you don\u2019t carry a balance that accrues interest, which is personal finance advice even a 12-year-old should know."

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nOn July 18, President Trump signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act into law.\nThe GENIUS Act established regulations for stablecoins: cryptocurrencies pegged to \u201cstable\u201d assets such as the U.S. dollar. It specified \u201cpermitted payment stablecoin issuers\u201d including both banks and nonbank entities. The law also clarified reserve requirements \u2014 the underlying assets held in reserve by the issuer to back the stablecoins, such as U.S. dollars or Treasury bills.\nSo, how might the GENIUS Act impact retirees?\nPotential for Yield\nSome stablecoins are designed to generate a yield, despite being spendable like cash. That yield could come from the underlying reserve asset, or from lending out the underlying asset.\n\u201cFor retirees, stablecoins could offer higher-yielding, low-volatility cash instruments,\u201d explained David Materazzi, CEO of Galileo FX. \u201cIn effect, owners could get the performance of a money market fund with something as spendable as cash. That makes holding liquidity more rewarding without increasing exposure to risk assets.\u201d\nFaster and Cheaper International Payments\nOwners can transfer stablecoins internationally for pennies, and near-instant speeds. That could make life far easier for family members to support one another across borders and currencies.\nMagnus Larsson, founder of fintech company MAJORITY, sees huge advantages for international transfers. \u201cStablecoins, when properly backed and transparent, offer a more efficient way to move money globally without the delays and fees traditional systems impose, transforming money movement much like VoIP transformed telecom.\u201d\nEstate Planning Through Smart Contracts\nCryptocurrencies allow for smart contracts, in which the owner can set up self-executing orders within the blockchain technology. In other words, owners can set up automated transfers within the cryptocurrency itself \u2014 without needing a human intermediary such as a trustee.\n\u201cSmart contracts allow more transparent and controlled gifting, even from beyond the grave,\u201d noted financial planner Christina Lynn of Mariner Wealth Advisors. \u201cWhile this remains speculative, regulated stablecoins could someday support innovative estate planning tools that automate distributions to beneficiaries and reduce traditional trust administration costs.\u201d\nHigh Transparency Means No Privacy\nBlockchain technology stores every transaction in its history. That transparency is useful, but it also makes the owner\u2019s spending public.\n\u201cEvery transaction becomes traceable, timestamped and stored,\u201d observed Materazzi. \u201cRetirees used to cash will lose financial privacy entirely. If stablecoins become the default for Social Security or Medicare reimbursements, then spending data becomes a public-private asset.\u201d\nRisk of Platform Failure\nNonbank entities can now issue stablecoins \u2014 without being FDIC-insured.\nCrypto exchanges have failed in the past, or suffered theft. Remember the Mt. Gox heist in 2014? Hackers made off with 850,000 Bitcoins \u2014 worth over $100 billion today.\nRetirement planning counselor Jake Falcon of Falcon Wealth Advisors sees huge risk among issuers. \u201cWithout FDIC insurance or SIPC protections, losses could be permanent,\u201d he said. \u201cAllowing nonbank entities to issue digital currencies without uniform oversight could echo the 19th-century wildcat banking era, where unregulated banks issued their own notes, often leading to collapse.\u201d\nStablecoins offer both opportunities and risks to retirees. Proceed with caution after speaking with your financial advisor."

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nAffordable travel is all the rage these days, so finding more ways to satisfy your wanderlust in the most economical way only makes sense. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) engines like ChatGPT, Gemini and similar platforms is now helping many world travelers plan epic adventures while saving money in the process.\nIf you want to learn how to use AI to plan your next vacation without breaking the bank, here are some prompt ideas to get you started.\n1. Plan a Trip For a Large Group\nIf you\u2019re traveling with a large group, you\u2019ll want plans that include getting everyone around in the least expensive way possible. When using this prompt, you should be specific about how much you want each person to spend per day and the kind of accommodations your group will consider, such as hostels or transportation modes like tour buses or public transport.\nSample prompt: Plan a trip to Florence, Italy, for a group of students who don\u2019t want to spend more than $85 a day for a 10-day excursion. Include inexpensive lodging options like hostels or a large BnB mansion everyone can share.\n2. Create an Economical Restaurant and Dining Guide\nIf you\u2019re a traveling foodie, planning your food stops is a must. You can ask ChatGPT to compare food costs between locations in a given country or find affordable options for your must-have dishes. For instance, enjoying afternoon tea in London at the Four Seasons will be much pricier than at a local cafe off the beaten path.\nSample prompt: Provide a list of France\u2019s best, most affordable bistros in Paris, along with top-rated restaurants within a 50-mile radius of Paris. Include cities where the cost of lodging in general is lower as well.\n3. Get the Best Flight Deals\nDifferent destinations will have varying high and low seasons. Plus, pricing may depend on your departure city. If you\u2019ve some flexibility, you can ask ChatGPT to help you choose a location based on your budget availability, and departing city.\nSample prompt: What is the best time to leave Florida\u2019s International Airport for a 14-day trip to Southeast Asia? Include ideal countries to fly into along with neighboring countries to visit via inexpensive flights. Include options for the off-season, too.\n4. Find Affordable Yet Walkable Cities\nFor many travelers, the intersection of affordable and walkable travel destinations is ideal, as it allows them to save money on getting around while paying lower prices for accommodations. This means that getting to dining, shopping, nightlife, and other attractions is easier and less expensive.\nSample prompt: Name the top walkable, affordable cities in Germany for a 7-day vacation for a family of 4. Include family-friendly locations with amenities like parks, pools, etc.\n5. Draft an Itinerary for Free (or Inexpensive) Activities\nCities around the world offer plenty of budget-friendly experiences, from free museums and guided tours to outdoor adventures and cultural festivals. When creating an itinerary, ask ChatGPT for a mix of activities that cater to different interests and age groups to ensure everyone enjoys the trip.\nSample prompt: Create a 5-day itinerary for a trip to Tokyo, Japan, focusing on free or low-cost activities. Include visits to parks, markets, and cultural sites like temples or traditional craft demonstrations.\nThe Bottom Line\nThere are plenty of other capabilities to explore when planning a trip to AI. You can cal create queries surrounding travel topics like:\n- Discount passes and coupons.\n- Packing tips.\n- Travel insurance comparisons.\n- Local currency tips.\n- Bespoke experiences and excursions for specific groups like architects, the elderly, missionaries, etc.\nThe key is knowing what you want from your experience and adding as much detail as possible. Since some AI engines use data that can be 1-2 years behind, fact-check all outputs to ensure that all recommendations are still valid and up-to-date. From here, you should be able to create great, wallet-friendly travel plans for plenty of locations, interests and budgets."

      "text": "How Airlines Will Use AI To Charge You More \u2014 and 8 Ways To Outsmart Them\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nYou\u2019ve been using AI for your shopping list, vacation itinerary or to create cartoon versions of yourself. Major airlines, however, are using AI to rake in more profits. Airlines like Delta are beginning to use generative AI to analyze your search habits and set a price based on what it thinks you\u2019ll be willing to pay.\nEven though AI could make your next trip more expensive, there are still a few ways to outsmart the system and get a fairer price.\nDelta Leads the AI Charge\nDuring the Q&A portion of an earnings call, Delta Airlines president Glen William Hauenstein, shared that Delta is continuing to experiment and roll out dynamic AI pricing for flights using an AI startup, Fetcherr. Currently, 3% of domestic Delta flights have their prices set using generative AI. By the end of 2025, Delta plans to increase that to 20% of all domestic flights. \u201cWe\u2019re in a heavy testing phase. We like what we see. We like it a lot and we\u2019re continuing to roll it out,\u201d Hauenstein said.\nWill AI Make Traveling More Expensive?\nFor consumers, that means airlines like Delta and potentially others are using your personal data to determine how much you\u2019ll pay for your next flight. That could include your login status, social media activity, previous booking history, search frequency, financial status and IP location, according to the FTC. It also means that you could see drastically different prices based on each individual\u2019s online habits.\nIn response to news of Delta\u2019s AI individualized pricing, three senators released a public letter voicing their criticism and concerns regarding this practice. Senators Ruben Gallego, Mark Warner and Richard Blumenthal penned a letter to the CEO of Delta Air Lines in July, chastising the use of surveillance-based pricing models and demanding answers on how the AI system is being trained and what personal data is being used.\n\u201cPrices could be dictated not by supply and demand, but by individual need,\u201d the senators wrote in the letter. So if you needed a flight to see a sick family member and the airline\u2019s AI was fed that information, you may see higher prices when searching for tickets. Or if the AI is fed your income data and knows you make above a certain amount, you could regularly be charged more than others are paying.\n\u201cWhile Delta has stated that the airline will \u2018maintain strict safeguards to ensure compliance with federal law,\u2019 your company has not shared what those safeguards are or how you plan to protect American families against pricing discrimination in the evolving AI landscape,\u201d the senators wrote.\nHow To Outsmart AI Pricing\nEscaping surveillance pricing requires you to take some extra steps before booking your next flight. You can still find neutral prices without having your personal data used against you by taking these precautions:\n- Use a VPN to help hide your identity\n- Search for flights in incognito mode\n- Use a different device to compare prices\n- Use a privacy web browser like DuckDuckGo\n- Book directly with the airline. Third-party sites may collect more data.\n- Clear your browser\u2019s cookies\n- Refresh your session between searches.\n- Support legislation that prevents surveillance pricing.\nAirlines have a vested interest in raising their profits and with AI fueling the pricing models, it could take more money out of your pocket the next time you search for tickets. Level the playing field by protecting your personal data."

You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 YearsHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed by Experts\nTrusted by Millions of Readers\nFor all the ways people love saving money at Costco, there are still some products that just don\u2019t make its customers happy.\nIn fact, these products garner entire Reddit threads of discontent. Not all of these complaints have to do with the product itself, but packaging, prices or even mold. Here are six products that have the most customer complaints.\nKirkland Signature Milk\nMilk is milk, no matter how you package it, but Costco\u2019s Kirkland Signature brand milk gallons get a unique complaint, according to Julie Ramhold, consumer analyst with DealNews.com.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t anything wrong with the milk itself, but rather shoppers that are forced to buy the square-shaped containers absolutely despise them.\u201d\nRamhold said the shape is reportedly to make the milk easier to ship as well as cheaper and environmentally friendly, but shoppers who have had to use them talk about how it makes them prone to spilling milk whenever you pour.\n\u201cPersonally, I can vouch for this one. I can\u2019t think of a single time I\u2019ve used those jugs and not spilled at least a little milk when pouring.\u201d\nCostco appears to have heard the complaints on this one and plans to try to correct this problem, according to Eat This, Not That.\nKirkland Signature Chicken Bakes\nCostco fans have spoken and they\u2019re unanimous. It\u2019s much better to buy an in-club made chicken bake and skip the frozen ready-made option.\nSeveral fans took to Reddit to complain that the frozen chicken bakes were among one of the worst Kirkland Signature items sold at the warehouse club. Apparently, the frozen version just isn\u2019t the same as the real thing.\nChomps Beef Sticks\nChomps Beef Sticks are grass-fed beef sticks that are meant to be a healthier, high protein snack. While not a Costco-specific brand, Ramhold said, \u201cThe Costco subreddit has several users commenting on finding at least one stick in their package that seemed green from possible mold and therefore has to be tossed in the bin.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cYour mileage may vary on this product, though, and since the sticks are individually wrapped, you don\u2019t have to worry about one contaminating the rest of the batch. Still, you might want to flip the bag over and see if you can view the sticks through the packaging to make sure everything looks as it should.\u201d\nFresh Produce\nIn a separate Costco subreddit, shoppers shared some of the moments where buying fresh produce turned out to be cost-ineffective.\nAmong the shortlist of items to avoid are strawberries, cucumbers and avocados, as shoppers complained they tend to go bad quickly.\nKirkland Signature Dishwasher Detergent\nWhile Kirkland signature dishwasher detergent has a large client base, it has also been the subject of complaints from those who have used it, said Jamie Penney, CEO of ShoppingFoodie.\n\u201cThere have been numerous complaints from customers that the detergent does not dissolve correctly, leaving a film that makes dishes appear dirty. Some have also complained that the detergent makes them sick or makes their skin itch.\u201d\nKirkland Hard Boiled Eggs\nHow can you mess up a hard-boiled egg? Well, according to Eat This, Not That, more than 400 Reddit users have complained about them, deeming these to be everything from \u201cpretty gross\u201d to having a \u201cweird flavor\u201d which has been compared to plastic.\nHeather Taylor contributed to the reporting for this piece.\nShare This Article:\nYou May Also Like\nExperts Weigh in on Tariffs: 5 Items That Are on the Rise and What's Still Safe To Buy\nAugust 05, 2025\n4 min Read\nI Asked ChatGPT: What's the Best $20 Parents Can Spend on Back-to-School Supplies at Dollar Tree?\nAugust 05, 2025\n4 min Read\nMake your money work for you\nGet the latest news on investing, money, and more with our free newsletter.\nThanks!\nSending you timely financial stories that you can bank on.\nSign up for our daily newsletter for the latest financial news and trending topics.\nFor our full Privacy Policy, click here.\nLooks like you're using an adblocker\nPlease disable your adblocker to enjoy the optimal web experience and access the quality content you appreciate from GOBankingRates.\n- AdBlock / uBlock / Brave\n- Click the ad blocker extension icon to the right of the address bar\n- Disable on this site\n- Refresh the page\n- Firefox / Edge / DuckDuckGo\n- Click on the icon to the left of the address bar\n- Disable Tracking Protection\n- Refresh the page\n- Ghostery\n- Click the blue ghost icon to the right of the address bar\n- Disable Ad-Blocking, Anti-Tracking, and Never-Consent\n- Refresh the page"

You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nWhether you\u2019re planning a spring break trip or a summer vacation, travel season is upon us \u2014 but with inflation hitting Americans at every corner, budgeting for a vacation can be arduous.\nIndeed, 90% of Americans planning to travel for spring break said that price and affordability are top of mind, resulting in 77% of travelers saying they have not booked their trips yet, according to Hopper.\nEnter artificial intelligence. AI, which makes \u2014 or aims to make \u2014 the way we live, shop and work easier, can now also help you save money on your next vacation.\nExpedia and KAYAK Launch ChatGPT Plug-Ins\nFor instance, several travel sites, including Expedia and KAYAK, have launched ChatGPT plug-ins recently. Users can get recommendations on places to go, where to stay, how to get around, and what to see and do based on the chat.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find AI embedded in most of the best-known travel booking engines today, so you might be using AI to help plan your trip without even realizing it,\u201d said Brian Prince, founder and CEO of TopAITools.com.\nFor instance, Expedia uses a ChatGPT plug-in on the homepage of the app to provide travel recommendations. It will save hotels and attractions mentioned in the conversation to a trip, which you can then book in the app. Using one platform for research and booking helps streamline travel planning and save time.\nAnd two-thirds \u2014 64% of travelers \u2014 said they expect to use AI to research or plan travel in the future, or have already done so, according to a Matador Network survey. In addition, 16% said they had already used AI to help plan their travel \u2014 and a majority of those respondents said they used AI tools to save time planning (60%) and to find activities or attractions they wouldn\u2019t have known about (70%).\n\u201cBudgeting is a huge part of travel. Very few people can move around the globe as if money was no object,\u201d said Ross Borden, CEO of travel publisher Matador Network.\nMatador Network also recently launched GuideGeek, a free OpenAI-powered travel assistant with budgeting in mind, said Borden.\nStaying Within Your Travel Budget\nAccording to Borden, GuideGeek can be completely customizable to the request of the user. For example, you can make an itinerary of any length and matching any budget for any location in the world.\n\u201cHow often have you been looking at a hotel online that\u2019s in your budget, but there\u2019s an ad for another hotel that looks way better but costs twice as much?\u201d asked Borden.\nChatGPT itself can offer basic money-saving tips for travel, even with a pretty simple prompt like, \u201cWhat are some of the best tips to save money on travel?\u201d said Prince.\nYet, Prince noted that when it comes to ChatGPT prompts, the more specific and detailed you can be, the better the output.\nFor instance, when Prince used the prompt, \u201cI\u2019m planning a trip to Paris in April. Can you tell me some tips to save money on food and tourist attractions?\u201d ChatGPT offered specific and tangible advice, including a list of free attractions.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you could get into the Louvre free after 6pm on the first Friday of every month (except in July and August)! Always make sure to fact-check the information from ChatGPT, as it may not be up-to-date or accurate,\u201d he added.\nPrince said he asked ChatGPT for ways to save money on checked baggage fees with Delta, \u201cand it gave me some solid advice.\u201d\nFinding Flight Deals\nAI travel tools can also help finding not only the cheapest flights, but flights with other options.\n\u201cWe see a lot of users booking flights on GuideGeek because rather than a somewhat overwhelming array of flight options no sane person would take, if you put in your dates and destinations, GuideGeek immediately searches all available flights and provides three options: best, fastest and cheapest,\u201d said Borden.\nPrince added that Google Flights now uses AI to predict when you can get the best prices on tickets.\n\u201cGoogle Gemini integrates with Google Flights to access data, so you can plan your trip in Gemini and then book it easily, knowing you\u2019re getting the best prices,\u201d he said.\nBrainstorming for Budget Travel\nUsing AI to get ideas and inspiration for your next trip is a great way to break out of your typical habits in booking destinations of which you\u2019re already aware, said Borden.\n\u201cAI presents a more proactive option for travelers to find new destinations that fit within their budget, as opposed to scrolling on Instagram and hoping that the cool beach you just saw has somewhere affordable to stay nearby,\u201d he said.\nAsking for Cost-Saving Strategies\nFor instance, as you plan your trip, you can message back and forth with GuideGeek at no cost on Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram.\n\u201cWhile lists of free activities exist online for a lot of destinations, using AI can help create a custom list generated around what you\u2019re looking for. It would take quite a bit of time to research the same highly specific set of info on Google,\u201d said Borden."

Kamel, who regularly uses AI tools himself, shared the smart way to leverage artificial intelligence for better purchases without losing control of your wallet.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with using AI to help you shop,\u201d Kamel explained in a recent YouTube video. \u201cI think that can actually be smart. I use it all the time to do research.\u201d The key difference? He keeps himself firmly in the driver\u2019s seat for all final decisions.\nThe Right Way To Use AI for Shopping\nHere are some ways AI can help you with shopping.\nResearch and Compare Like a Pro\nKamel\u2019s approach is strategic and controlled. \u201cI do use ChatGPT to help me research and compare products that I\u2019m looking at, but that\u2019s where it stops. I do the purchasing from there.\u201d\nThink of AI as your research assistant, not your personal shopper. You can ask it to compare laptop specifications, find the best-rated air purifiers under $200 or explain the differences between various smartphone models. But when it comes time to click \u201cbuy,\u201d that\u2019s your job.\nSet Clear Boundaries and Guardrails\nKamel talked about how AI shopping tools are designed to influence behavior. \u201cRemember that AI is shaping your shopping habits. These tools are literally designed to influence what you buy and when you buy it.\u201d\nHis warning signs to watch for: \u201cIf you notice you\u2019re buying stuff faster, more often and with less thought, that\u2019s not efficiency \u2014 that is subtle manipulation with a friendly user interface.\u201d\nThe solution? Don\u2019t let the convenience of AI push you into making rushed decisions.\nStay Hands-On With Your Money\nWhether you\u2019re using AI or not, you still need to be aware of your finances and spending.\nKeep Control of the Final Decision\n\u201cStay hands-on with your money. Don\u2019t just set it and forget it,\u201d Kamel advised. \u201cYou need to always know exactly what\u2019s coming in, what\u2019s going out and what is sitting in your cart.\u201d\nEven when AI helps with browsing or comparison shopping, \u201cyou should still be the one making the final call on the purchases.\u201d This simple rule prevents impulse buying and keeps you connected to your spending.\nBudget Every Month\nKamel\u2019s cornerstone advice involves creating a monthly budget that \u201cbecomes the boss of your money.\u201d Rather than letting AI algorithms or marketing influence your purchases, your predetermined budget should guide every single spending decision.\n\u201cThe best way to stay on top of your spending is to make a budget every single month,\u201d he explained. This budget acts as your financial guardrails, preventing both AI tools and impulse purchases from derailing your money goals.\nWhat AI Can\u2019t (and Shouldn\u2019t) Do\nAI isn\u2019t good for all things, so here\u2019s a look at what to avoid.\nDon\u2019t Outsource Financial Decisions\nKamel got to the heart of why full AI shopping automation is problematic: \u201cDon\u2019t outsource your financial decisions to tech. AI doesn\u2019t know your values, it doesn\u2019t know your goals, it doesn\u2019t know the stress you\u2019re feeling.\u201d\nHe pointed out specific blind spots: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t know that your kid needs braces, that you\u2019re hustling to pay off your student loans. AI might know how to predict behavior and do some research, but it doesn\u2019t know how to help you build wealth and shape those habits.\u201d\nThe Danger of Algorithmic Control\n\u201cThe minute you start letting an algorithm decide where your money goes, you lose control,\u201d Kamel warned. \u201cAnd that\u2019s no bueno.\u201d\nThis loss of control happens gradually. First, AI makes shopping more convenient. Then it starts suggesting purchases. Eventually, you\u2019re disconnected from your spending decisions entirely \u2014 exactly what credit card companies want.\nThe Four Major Risks To Avoid\nWhile focusing on the positive uses of AI, Kamel identified four key dangers of AI shopping assistants:\n1. Frictionless Spending\nWhen purchasing becomes too easy, overspending becomes inevitable. \u201cAs friction goes down, the danger of overspending goes up.\u201d\n2. Lost Connection to Money\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re not the one swiping the card or clicking the checkout button, you lose any kind of connection to your money, emotional or otherwise.\u201d\n3. Derailed Financial Goals\nAI assistants optimize for profit and convenience, not your long-term financial success. They won\u2019t care if you\u2019re saving for a house or paying off debt.\n4. Data Privacy Concerns\n\u201cFor AI to protect your money, it needs full access to it. And that means more data sharing, more stored credentials, more places for things to go wrong.\u201d\nThe Smart AI Shopping Strategy\nKamel\u2019s approach boils down to using AI as a tool, not a decision-maker. Here\u2019s his practical framework:\nUse AI for:\n- Product research and comparisons\n- Reading and summarizing reviews\n- Finding options you might have missed\n- Understanding technical specifications\nDon\u2019t use AI for:\n- Making final purchase decisions\n- Setting spending priorities\n- Managing your budget\n- Storing payment information\nAlways remember:\n- Check your budget before any purchase.\n- Take time to consider each buying decision.\n- Stay aware of how tools influence your behavior.\n- Keep your financial goals front and center.\nThe Bottom Line on AI and Money\n\u201cThis is your life, it\u2019s your money, and you shouldn\u2019t mindlessly delegate it to a robot trained by credit card companies,\u201d Kamel concluded.\nThe promise of AI shopping assistants is seductive \u2014 imagine never having to research products or compare prices again. But Kamel\u2019s approach offers something better: the research benefits of AI combined with the intentionality and control that actually build wealth.\nAI can make you a smarter shopper, but only if you remain the smart one making the decisions. Use it to gather information, compare options and understand products better. Just don\u2019t let it anywhere near your wallet.\nAs Kamel put it, you need to \u201ctake back the wheel and stop letting marketing or machines control your money.\u201d AI is a powerful tool for shopping research \u2014 just make sure you\u2019re the one holding the tool, not the other way around.\nMore From GOBankingRates"

Delta plans to expand its AI-driven pricing to 20% of domestic flights by 2025, raising concerns among lawmakers about surveillance-based pricing practices. To counteract this, consumers can take steps such as using VPNs, searching in incognito mode, and booking directly with airlines to find fairer prices.",
