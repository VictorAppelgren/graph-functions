One photo showed McEntire posing with her boyfriend, Rex Linn, as well as Brandon and his eldest daughter, Savannah, 23, whom he shared with ex-wife Melissa Ashworth. (Brandon and Ashworth also welcomed a son, Seth, now 18, before their 2012 split.)\nBrandon\u2019s sisters, Chassidy and Shawna, were also in attendance at the rodeo, along with Shelby\u2019s wife, Marissa.\n\u201cNarvel and his wife, Laura, and Reba\u2019s boyfriend, Rex, are at a place where they can be together and talk, which is a big step,\u201d the insider tells Us. \u201cReba has a heart of gold, and she was there for Brandon and his kids. They are family at the end of the day.\u201d\nMcEntire and Narvel, who was the country icon\u2019s manager, tied the knot in 1989. They announced their separation in 2015 and finalized their split later that year. She moved on with Linn, 68, in 2020.\nBrandon died on Thursday, August 7, after privately fighting cancer for several years. He was 48.\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years. He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family,\u201d a rep for the family told Us in a statement. \u201cWe thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family\u2019s privacy during this very difficult time.\u201d\nFollowing his marriage to Ashworth, Brandon \u2014 who was a talent manager, like his father \u2014 married Kelly Clarkson, who he previously managed. The former couple, who tied the knot in 2013, welcomed two children during their relationship: daughter River Rose, 11, and son Remington, 9. Brandon and Clarkson, 43, called it quits in 2020 and finalized their divorce in 2022.\nOne day prior to Brandon\u2019s death, Clarkson announced the postponement of her Las Vegas residency, explaining that she needed to support her kids amid her ex-husband\u2019s illness.\n\u201cUnfortunately, I need to postpone the remainder of the August Studio Session dates in Las Vegas,\u201d she wrote via Instagram on Wednesday, August 6. \u201cWhile I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children\u2019s father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them. I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.\u201d\nAfter Brandon\u2019s death, an insider told Us that Clarkson still wanted to protect her ex-husband\u2019s privacy \u201ceven though they went through an acrimonious divorce.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019d been sick for a while, but his health really took a turn for the worse earlier this year. That\u2019s why she was MIA from her talk show,\u201d the source explained, referring to Clarkson\u2019s unexplained two-week absence from The Kelly Clarkson Show in late February and early March. \u201cOut of respect, Kelly chose not to say anything publicly until it became clear this week that Brandon wasn\u2019t going to make it.\u201d\nClarkson\u2019s next round of Las Vegas shows are seemingly still scheduled for November. The seventh season of her eponymous talk show is expected to premiere later this year, but a return date has not been confirmed."

Their union ended with a contentious legal battle that saw the pair fight over finances, custody and property.\nThe tribute came just days after Savannah revealed that she had announced she was expecting her second child just one month before her father died.\nTaking to her private Instagram account on July 5, soon-to-be mom of two revealed the news about her impending arrival.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been keeping a couple sweet surprises,\u201d wrote Savannah, who already shares 3-year-old son, Lake, with her husband. \u201cOne little girl will be making her arrival at the beginning of January.\u201d\n\u201cThe Lord has been so faithful,\u201d she went on. \u201cHe\u2019s written a story we never could\u2019ve imagined, and His kindness in this season has left us in awe. He\u2019s answered prayers we never even knew how to pray.\u201d"

This person\u2019s mommy was there,'\u201d the Grammy winner explained on Kylie Kelce\u2019s \u201cNot Gonna Lie\u201d podcast.\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018Congratulations to her because she made different decisions that led to her being able to be there on a Thursday at 10 a.m.'\u201d\nClarkson and Blackstock first split in 2020 after nearly seven years of marriage, and officially finalized their messy divorce two years later.\nKeep reading for a complete look back on Clarkson and Blackstock\u2019s relationship.\nMay 2006: Clarkson and Blackstock meet\nThe former couple first crossed paths during a rehearsal for the Academy of Country Music Awards in May 2006.\n\u201cMy guitar player\u2019s wife Ashley was my date for that night and we had just both been in crap relationships,\u201d Clarkson shared in 2017. \u201cSometimes it sucks dating because it\u2019s so many wrong ones until you get the right one.\u201d\nShe continued, \u201cAnd we were like, \u2018OK, what we\u2019ve been doing wrong here\u2019 \u2014 because it was a country music event and we\u2019re both southern girls \u2014 we were like, \u2018We\u2019ve been dating skinny jeans and we need Wranglers.'\u201d\nThen, Clarkson spotted the former stepson of Reba McEntire.\n\u201cLiterally, I\u2019m not joking, he walked past us at that time,\u201d she detailed. \u201cAnd he walked by, I was ready to take it all off. I just felt something.\u201d\nAt the time of the award show, Blackstock was still married to his then-wife, Melissa Ashworth. The two, who share daughter Savannah, 23, and son Seth, 18, divorced in 2012.\nFebruary 2012: Clarkson and Blackstock reconnect\nDespite crossing paths years earlier, the former flames reconnected in 2012, while Blackstock\u2019s father, Narvel, was Clarkson\u2019s manager.\nThe artist was performing the national anthem at the Super Bowl. Next to her was Blake Shelton, who was managed by Blackstock, singing \u201cAmerica the Beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cI was so nervous because it wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t want to suck for the millions of people watching, I didn\u2019t want to suck because I was trying to impress a guy,\u201d Clarkson admitted to SiriusXM in 2017. \u201cI wanted him to be like, \u2018Damn.\u2019 It had nothing to do with the Super Bowl!\u201d\nClarkson and Blackstock had their first date on February 11, 2012. The day held major significance to Clarkson since it was also the day her idol, Whitney Houston, died.\n\u201cThis is the funniest/worst thing ever: One of my superhero idols is Whitney Houston, and the day she died was our first date,\u201d Clarkson shared in 2013, per People. \u201cI was like, \u2018This is a bad omen.'\u201d\nDecember 2012: Clarkson and Blackstock get engaged\n\u201cI\u2019ve only had three other boyfriends that I dated, and not really seriously,\u201d Clarkson admitted to People in 2013. \u201cThis guy walks by, making everybody laugh. I said, \u2018I\u2019m gonna end up with him. I know it.'\u201d\nAnd she was right.\nThe pair got engaged in December 2012, with Clarkson sharing the happy news on Twitter.\n\u201cI\u2019M ENGAGED!!!!!\u201d the talk show host gushed. \u201cI wanted y\u2019all to know!! Happiest night of my life last night! I am so lucky and am with the greatest man ever.\u201d\nBlackstock popped the question at their Nashville house.\nClarkson recalled to People about the proposal: \u201cOut of nowhere I just said, \u2018Thanks for being an awesome guy.\u2019 I\u2019ve never been loved properly by a man, and I was just like, \u2018I thank you so much for that.'\u201d\nBlackstock then got down on one knee.\n\u201cNot a damn clue!\u201d she continued to the outlet. \u201cIf I did, I would have worn something besides Uggs and a sweatshirt with no bra.\u201d\nOctober 2013: Clarkson and Blackstock get married\nClarkson and Blackstock tied the knot on Oct. 20, 2013.\nAt the time, the musician tweeted, \u201cI\u2019m officially Mrs. Blackstock :) We got married yesterday at Blackberry Farms in TN, the most beautiful place ever!\u201d\n\u201cI was so emotional, and I didn\u2019t realize I was going to be!\u201d Clarkson dished to People in 2020.\n\u201cDuring the ceremony, Seth looked up and was like, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with her?\u2019\u201d she recounted. \u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m just so happy!\u2019\u201d\nClarkson also touched on becoming a blended family with Blackstock\u2019s kids.\n\u201cMy best friend always say, \u2018You just want to create the family you never had.\u2019 I might be doing that,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cIn defense of my family, it happens. People fall out of love, and people go separate ways. People are human. I\u2019ve accomplished a lot, but I guess the biggest success I want is that whenever I die people will say, \u2018She was so successful as a mother and as a wife.\u2019 That\u2019s kind of a big goal.\u201d\nJune 2014: River Rose Blackstock is born\nClarkson and Blackstock welcomed their first child together, daughter River Rose, months after tying the knot.\n\u201cOur baby girl River Rose Blackstock arrived on June 12th!\u201d the new mom posted on X at the time. \u201cThank you everyone for all of your well wishes! Brandon and I are on cloud 9!!\u201d\nIn 2023, Clarkson had her daughter join her onstage at the Bakkt Theater at the Planet Hollywood Las Vegas Resort & Casino to perform a duet of \u201cHeartbeat Song.\u201d\nHer son also came on stage to showcase his dance moves.\n\u201cBoth of my kiddos backstage getting ready to join me on stage in Vegas,\u201d Clarkson gushed on Instagram the next day. \u201cNothing will ever be as cool and amazing as these two little humans that will always have my whole heart.\u201d\nApril 2016: Remington Alexander Blackstock is born\nClarkson announced she was pregnant with her second child in a very public way.\nDuring a performance in Los Angeles, she became emotional while introducing her song \u201cPiece by Piece.\u201d\n\u201cI was not planning on announcing this, but \u2026 I\u2019m totally pregnant. I\u2019m having a really hard time,\u201d she told the audience.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna nail the s \u2013 \u2013 t out of this song. That was not how I wanted to announce that \u2026 I hate this song right now,\u201d Clarkson teased. \u201cMy makeup artist is backstage hating me right now. I just don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m on pills or drunk.\u201d\nAfter finishing the song, she told the concertgoers, \u201cI\u2019d like to apologize to my husband. That was not planned. I just didn\u2019t want you to think I was crazy or something. Honestly, I\u2019m just so hormonal today\u2026 I haven\u2019t vomited yet. That is a freakin\u2019 win, y\u2019all.\u201d\nOn April 12, 2016, Clarkson and Blackstock welcomed their son, Remy.\nAt one point, Clarkson\u2019s son suffered from hearing issues and delayed speech. The hearing issue set Remy back \u201calmost nine months\u201d in communicating.\n\u201cThe big milestone for us is Remy getting to really find out his own personality and his identity, because it\u2019s been frustrating for him to not be able to really vocalize his emotion,\u201d Clarkson told People in 2020. \u201cThe fact that he\u2019s making full sentences now and full-on engaging with us is really a blessing.\u201d\nJune 2020: Clarkson files for divorce\nAfter almost seven years of marriage, Clarkson filed for divorce on June 4, 2020, citing irreconcilable differences.\nNovember 2020: Clarkson wins temporary primary custody\nIn November 2020, Clarkson was awarded temporary primary physical custody of River and Remy.\nAccording to court documents, \u201cthe level of conflict between the parents [had] increased\u201d and that they had \u201ca difficult time co-parenting due to issues of trust between them.\u201d\nThe documents also stated that Clarkson and Blackstock agreed that they \u201cshall not speak in a derogatory manner about the other parent to the minor children. The custodial parent shall not allow the minor children to be in the presence of any third party who speaks about the other parent in a derogatory manner.\u201d\nOne month after the court\u2019s decision, Clarkson alleged that Blackstock acted fraudulently as her manager. He denied defrauding his estranged wife out of millions.\nAt the time, Clarkson also told Entertainment Tonight that the \u201cthing that\u2019s been kind of hard to navigate is I am an open book, but at some point I\u2019m a mama bear more than I am a person in the public eye.\u201d\n\u201cSo I care 100% more about my children than I do anything else on this planet.\u201d\nMarch 2022: Clarkson and Blackstock\u2019s divorce is finalized\nIn March 2022, a judge approved the exes\u2019 divorce settlement, granting Blackstock $115,000 each month in spousal support until January 2024. The talent manager also received a monthly amount of $45,600 in child support.\nClarkson is also officially awarded primary custody of the kids.\nFall 2023: Clarkson relocated to New York City\n\u201cThe Kelly Clarkson Show\u201d relocated to New York City, with the mom of two bringing her children with her.\n\u201cThe move to NYC was a fresh start for her that she has never regretted,\u201d an insider told People in 2024. \u201cShe had not been happy in Los Angeles for a while but was still nervous about moving. It was the best decision for her though. They thrive as a family.\u201d\nBlackstock, meanwhile, resided in Butte, Mont., after moving out of the family\u2019s original Montana ranch.\nJanuary 2024: Clarkson opens up about the split\nClarkson told People at the time she poured a lot of her emotions from her divorce into her album, \u201cChemistry.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see it other than: This is my outlet,\u201d she told the publication. \u201cI\u2019m a let-go person; I don\u2019t hold grudges. So it was really delving into what happened in my life and why \u2014 and what am I going to do about it?\u201d\nClarkson said releasing the album \u201c[was] like, \u2018I\u2019m taking my power back.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI cannot express how appreciative I feel for having that kind of healthy outlet. Because the level of depression and things that come with divorce or grieving is extraordinarily hard,\u201d she added. \u201cYou feel alone, and it\u2019s just a blessing to be able to have that outlet for those emotions that are overwhelming.\u201d\nAugust 2025: Blackstock dies of cancer\nOn Aug. 7, 2025, it was announced that Blackstock died at age 48 after a private cancer battle, with sources telling TMZ he had melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer.\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years,\u201d his family said in a statement obtained by The Post read.\n\u201cHe passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family. We thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family\u2019s privacy during this very difficult time,\u201d they concluded.\nBlackstock\u2019s passing comes just hours after Clarkson abruptly postponed the remaining August shows of her Las Vegas residency, Studio Sessions.\nShe previously canceled opening weekend in July."

Despite their difficult divorce, he\u2019s still the man she loved and still her kids\u2019 father.\u201d\nClarkson filed for divorce in 2020 after nearly seven years of marriage.\nTheir legal battle was messy, with the exes fighting over everything from custody of their children to their Montana ranch.\nClarkson and Brandon\u2019s divorce was finalized in 2022.\nHe was awarded $115,000 each month in spousal support until January 2024 and a monthly amount of $45,600 in child support despite the Grammy winner being granted primary custody of their kids.\nClarkson relocated their children from Los Angeles, Calif., to New York for \u201cThe Kelly Clarkson Show,\u201d while Brandon moved to Butte, Mont.\nThe \u201cSince U Been Gone\u201d singer was dedicated to making sure River and Remy had a good relationship with their father, especially before his death.\n\u201cWhen she found out that he was sick, she remained protective of him for their sake,\u201d a source told People after his passing.\n\u201cKelly has always tried to keep things classy,\u201d they added. \u201cIt became clear earlier this year that Brandon was not doing well.

Then I blacked out and he raped me.\u201d\nThe \u201cCheaper by the Dozen\u201d star added that the alleged incident unfolded after a wellness event when they were transitioning away from content creation and towards a more full-time role as a mental health professional.\nDuring one event, Stoner bumped into a man who was \u201cwell-adored in the community\u201d and accepted an invitation to learn more about his products.\n\u201cHe opened the door to a room on the first floor of an apartment building. Is this his lab or his residence?\u201d Stoner wrote, although they did not reveal their alleged abuser\u2019s name in their memoir.\n\u201cIt was common for entrepreneurs and creatives to have live-work spaces, but this looked nothing like the setup from the photos he showed me,\u201d the Disney Channel alum added.\nStoner claimed that \u201cthere were no chairs to sit on\u201d in the man\u2019s room, and the pair ended up sitting on the floor.\nThey also wrote that the man\u2019s \u201ceyes focused on my crotch,\u201d and they immediately felt \u201cuncomfortable\u201d as things quickly began to escalate.\n\u201cHis eyes burned a hole in my body as he calculated his next move,\u201d Stoner recalled. \u201cSuddenly, his hand reached to grab my crotch, and I swatted him away.\u201d\n\u201cStill on the floor, he wrestled me toward the back corner of the room as I fought back tears,\u201d they continued. \u201cWith one arm, he lifted my whole body onto his bed, which was tucked into a recessed nook with three walls enclosing it.\u201d\nAfter the alleged assailant tried to \u201cremove\u201d Stoner\u2019s clothes, their \u201clegs fused together and I didn\u2019t move.\u201d\n\u201cI briefly exited my body to go into analytical survivor mode: Stay present and list your options,\u201d Stoner detailed. \u201cYou know what might happen. How can you get out of this alive? Your phone is out of reach. If you scream, be might muffle you.\u201d\n\u201cIf you run for the door, he\u2019s massive and will beat you there and maybe make it more painful,\u201d they added.\nDespite feeling a sense of \u201cdread\u201d and \u201cmore and more trapped and unable to function,\u201d the \u201cStep Up\u201d star was able to momentarily get their alleged attacker to stop his sexual assault.\n\u201cLike a child trying to fool his parents, he stopped communicating and pretended to fall asleep instantly, though his body was visibly charged with energy,\u201d they wrote. \u201cI tried to match his nonchalance and deescalate the situation.\u201d\nBut the \u201cSuite Life of Zach and Cody\u201d alum claimed the man then continued his alleged assault.\n\u201cThere was no reasoning or physically fighting my way out. My defenses waned as his hands pulled my pants to my knees, flipping me to the side where I could momentarily see his bare body in my periphery,\u201d Stoner wrote.\n\u201cHe separated my legs like I was an inanimate object,\u201d they added.\nBefore breaking their silence on the alleged sexual assault in their new memoir, Stoner detailed how they were allegedly fired from a kids\u2019 show after first coming out as queer in a 2018 Teen Vogue interview.\nAlthough Stoner did not specify which show they were allegedly fired from, the former Disney Channel star said that it was \u201cdefinitely discrimination.\u201d\n\u201cI did end up getting fired from a children\u2019s show because they felt that I was unsafe, now that they knew I was queer, to be around kids,\u201d they said during the \u201cI\u2019m Literally Screaming\u201d podcast in June 2023.\n\u201cThe, like, beauty far outweighs the hate comments and death threats,\u201d Stoner added at the time. \u201cIt was intimating and also liberating.\u201d"

ET spoke with the country superstar about her new take on some of her classic hits and why she won't play favorites when it comes to Kelly Clarkson's divorce from her stepson, Brandon Blackstock.\n\"Kelly and I do talk, we text and I love them both, and so I can't play favorites because I've been a friend of Kelly for a long time,\" McEntire said of their split.\nThough McEntire is divorced from Blackstock's father, Narvel, she still considers his son to be her own flesh and blood.\n\"Brandon's been my son forever it seems. Although he's my stepson, I still love him like he's my total -- my blood, so I'm praying for \u2018em both 'cause I love \u2018em both,\" she continued.\nAnd while the \"I'm a Survivor\" singer has moved on in love and life, she's revisiting the past with her new three-part boxed set, Revived, Remixed, Revisited, a reimagining of her biggest hits. The project came about after McEntire's record label encouraged her to take some time during the COVID-19 pandemic to return to some of her old favorites.\n\"I went back in with my band, and we did 10 songs in the version of what I perform onstage. So if you've been to my concerts, that's the way you would've heard those songs. And then the remixed songs are dance mixes of 10 of my songs,\" she explained.\nMcEntire continued, \"And then the revisited, those are 10 songs that I went into the studio with Dave Cobb and we re-recorded them stripped down. So, it's three different versions, 'Fancy' is on every album. 'I'm a Survivor' is on two albums. That and 'The Lights Went Out in Georgia' is on two albums, and all the other ones are not duplicated. But it's almost 26, 27 songs played a little bit differently from the original recordings.\"\nOf all the revived, remixed and revisited classics that the celebrated singer re-recorded, McEntire said \"Fantasy\" has to be her favorite.\n\"I love to do 'Fantasy,' that's my favorite song to sing,\" she shared.\nThe \"more mature\" take on the originals also features a duet that country music fans have been waiting forever for: McEntire and Dolly Parton, and it's one the two musicians have been waiting for too.\n\"We've both said that to each other, 'Why is this the first time we've ever gotten to sing together?'\" McEntire said. \"We've been at shows or TV things for her, she's been done the same for me, and so it was really neat to sing a song together.\"\nThe pair teamed up for the remix of \"Does He Love You,\" and while COVID prevented them from recording the song together, they did get together for the music video for the song, which McEntire released over the weekend.\n\"Unfortunately, we didn't get to be in the recording studio together because of COVID, but we did get to be together on the video. I loved it,\" she explained.\nThe song from the catalog of classics that fans relate to most, however, has to be \"I'm a Survivor.\"\n\"'I'm a Survivor' is a song that so many people can relate to, whether it's firefighters or first responders, doctors, mothers or teachers, librarians. It doesn\u2019t matter what you go through in life, if you've accomplished something and you feel good about it, then you're a survivor. You have come through and survived,\" McEntire said of the track which also served as the theme song for her hit series, Reba, which celebrated its 20th anniversary this year.\nA re-imagining of Reba isn't out of the question either. While nothing is in the works yet, McEntire says she has her fingers crossed.\n\"We all got together when I was out in Los Angeles a couple of weeks ago, and they're all lovely and funny and silly and goofy. We've all just been really missing each other, so it was good to get back and stay in touch with everyone and say, 'How you doing?'\" she said of the cast's little Reba reunion. \"I missed \u2018em so much, and when we ended the Reba TV show or I should say, when they ended the Reba TV show after 6 and a half seasons, we had so many stories to tell, so many more adventures, and so I think it would be wonderful if we do get to come back. We're all keeping our fingers crossed.\"\nYou can listen to the singer's new take on her old favorites with Revived, Remixed, Revisited, out now.\nRELATED CONTENT"

      "text": "How Reba McEntire supported ex-stepson Brandon Blackstock in final months before his death\nReba McEntire brought the family together in the last months of Brandon Blackstock\u2019s life.\nThe \u201cFancy\u201d singer\u2019s former stepson, who was also Kelly Clarkson\u2019s ex-husband, died on Thursday, August 7, at age 48 after a private battle with cancer.\nSources are now sharing how McEntire, 70, was there for Blackstock before his passing. The Grammy winner was previously married to Blackstock\u2019s father, Narvel Blackstock.\n\u201cReba has spent more time with the Blackstock crew in the past year than in years prior,\u201d an insider told Us Weekly in an interview published on Friday, August 8.\nWhile the source noted that the years past were \u201ccontentious,\u201d they added that McEntire, her ex-husband and the rest of the clan \u201creally came together\u201d in the past several months.\nIn March, the country superstar was photographed smiling sweetly at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo alongside her ailing ex-stepson and her biological son, Shelby, the only child she shares with Narvel.\nMcEntire was also one of the three headliners at the event, with the source sharing that the exes pushed their feelings aside and were a united front in the months leading up to Blackstock\u2019s passing.\n\u201cNarvel and his wife, Laura, and Reba\u2019s boyfriend, Rex, are at a place where they can be together and talk, which is a big step,\u201d the insider told the outlet. \u201cReba has a heart of gold, and she was there for Brandon and his kids. They are family at the end of the day.\u201d\nMcEntire and Blackstock\u2019s father married in 1989 while he was her music manager. They announced their separation in 2015 and finalized their divorce that year.\nThe \u201cConsider Me Gone\u201d singer has been in a committed relationship with actor Rex Linn, 68, since 2020.\nMore than a decade before his passing, McEntire spoke about her unbreakable bond with her stepchildren, which also included Narvel\u2019s other children from his first marriage, Chassidy and Shawna.\n\u201cI don\u2019t consider Brandon, Chassidy and Shawna [Blackstock] stepchildren. I claim them all,\u201d she told The Boot in 2010.\nHowever, the country superstar revealed years later that time and distance made it hard to stay a family unit.\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever see the grandkids,\u201d she confessed to People in 2018. \u201cIt was a lot better when everybody was not so busy, but I\u2019ve got seven grandchildren, so they\u2019re scattered all over the country and busy doing stuff. But I love them.\u201d\nMcEntire\u2019s love for Blackstock never wavered, though.\n\u201cBrandon\u2019s been my son forever, it seems,\u201d she told Entertainment Tonight in 2021, just four years before his death. \u201cAlthough he\u2019s my stepson, I still love him like he\u2019s my total \u2014 my blood, so I\u2019m praying for them both because I love them both.\u201d\nShe also had a tight relationship with Blackstock\u2019s ex-wife, Clarkson.\nIn 2023, the singers appeared on Season 23 of \u201cThe Voice,\u201d with Clarkson serving as judge and McEntire as a mega mentor.\nBlackstock and the \u201cSince U Been Gone\u201d singer married in 2013, and they had two children together: daughter River, 11, and son Remington \u201cRemy,\u201d 9. He also had two kids from his first marriage: daughter Savannah, 23, and son, Seth, 18.\nClarkson filed for divorce in 2020, citing irreconcilable differences, but their battle was drawn-out and contentious.\nDespite the bad blood, sources told Page Six that the talk show host was there for Blackstock, caring for him and bringing their kids to visit their father, up until his death.\nShe canceled the remaining August shows of her Las Vegas residency the night before her ex-husband\u2019s passing, revealing that Blackstock was seriously ill.\nHours later, his family announced he had passed away.\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has died. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years,\u201d his family said in a statement obtained by The Post.\n\u201cHe passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family. We thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family\u2019s privacy during this very difficult time,\u201d they concluded.\nMcEntire\u2019s son, Shelby, paid tribute to his half-brother in an emotional separate post.\n\u201cWords cannot begin to capture the tremendous loss our family has endured. Yesterday, we lost a brother, a father, a grandfather, and a son,\u201d Shelby wrote. \u201cBrandon Blackstock was an irreplaceable part of our family\u2014funny, bright, and full of life\u2014and he will be deeply missed.\u201d\nClarkson is said to be \u201cdevastated\u201d for her kids.\nShe sparked concern earlier this year when she went missing in action from \u201cThe Kelly Clarkson Show\u201d without explanation.\nInsiders confirmed to Page Six that the singer-songwriter\u2019s absences this past season were due to Blackstock\u2019s illness, with sources telling TMZ that new episodes of Clarkson\u2019s syndicated program are still slated to air in September despite her ex-husband\u2019s death."
