  "content": "Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said President Donald Trump has ulterior motives with federalizing police in Washington, D.C., adding that Trump needs his supporters focused on \u201csomething else.\u201d\n\nTrump announced his move to address crime in the nation\u2019s capital Monday, giving Attorney General Pam Bondi control over the Metropolitan Police Department. Buttigieg, however, said Trump is not taking this action to increase the city\u2019s safety, but instead to \u201csolve his own political problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe needs to get his base talking and thinking about something besides his refusal to open up the Epstein files because he\u2019s mixed up in them,\u201d Buttigieg said in a video posted on X.\n\n\u201cAnd he wants the rest of the country focused on something, anything, besides the work that he has done and continues to do to kick millions of Americans off of their health insurance, to close down rural hospitals, and to undermine basic functions of our government in order to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest,\u201d Buttigieg said.\n\nThe former secretary was hesitant to call this a \u201cdistraction,\u201d but did say Trump is trying to distract people through \u201ctaking power in this way.\u201d He also said Trump has warned he would take similar action in other cities.\n\nButtigieg encouraged his followers to \u201cstand up\u201d to the president\u2019s \u201cauthoritarian actions\u201d while remaining focused on the effects of Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nAs part of Trump\u2019s crime clean-up in Washington, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that the city\u2019s homeless residents can leave their encampments for a homeless shelter. Those who refuse will be \u201csusceptible to fines or to jail time.\u201d\n\nWHY TRUMP\u2019S DC POLICE TAKEOVER IS LIKELY TO AVOID LEGAL HURDLES\n\nTrump\u2019s announcement to address crime in the nation\u2019s capital was preceded by former Department of Government Efficiency staffer Edward Coristine, known for his moniker \u201cBig Balls,\u201d who was attacked and carjacked by two juveniles on Aug. 3.\n\nBoth teenagers will be held in custody at D.C.\u2019s Youth Services Center after a request to move them was denied.",

      "text": "Homeless people in Washington have three options under President Donald Trump\u2019s crime control directives: homeless shelter, mental health or addiction treatment, or jail.\nThe plans for homeless people, many of whom suffer from mental health illnesses, were laid out by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt during a Tuesday afternoon briefing while discussing the administration\u2019s move to federalize control of the Metropolitan Police Department and deploy the National Guard to control the \u201cpublic safety emergency\u201d in the District of Columbia.\n\u201cHomeless individuals will be given the option to leave their encampment to be taken to a homeless shelter to be offered addiction or mental health services,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cAnd if they refuse, they will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.\u201d\nCleaning up the district was a campaign promise that Trump referenced at least 20 times during the 2024 election season, according to a Tuesday morning press release from the White House. His first promise to use federal law enforcement and the National Guard to restore the district came in February 2023.\nTrump said Monday that removing homeless encampments from the capital is an essential part of making Washington safer and more beautiful, but he did not make mention of the connection between homelessness and mental illness.\nAlthough statistics on the homeless population are difficult to collect, social scientists estimate that significant percentages of homeless people suffer from chronic mental health conditions.\nUpwards of 40% of those experiencing homelessness have a mental health disorder, and at least a quarter suffer from mental illness and addictions, according to the Canadian website Homeless Hub. The Health and Human Services website on the correlation between mental health and homelessness was down at the time of this reporting.\nLeavitt said Tuesday that \u201cthe homelessness problem has ravaged the city\u201d and that improving safety in Washington \u201cinvolves removing mentally disturbed individuals and homeless encampments.\u201d\n\u201cHomeless shelters, offered addiction and mental health services, or jail if they refuse, are the options on the table right now,\u201d Leavitt said.\nLeavitt cited D.C. Criminal Code 22-1307 and Municipal Regulation 24-100 as giving the MPD the authority to disband homeless encampments, saying the local government has \u201ccompletely ignored\u201d the laws.\nNeither local code outlines a protocol for providing mental health or addiction treatment to homeless people after they have been engaged by police.\nTRUMP SAYS DC HOMELESS MUST \u2018MOVE OUT IMMEDIATELY\u2019 IN ANNOUNCING PRESS CONFERENCE\nA DOJ spokesperson referred the Washington Examiner to the MPD when asked for specifics on the plans for offering mental health and addiction treatment to homeless people.\nThe D.C. Deputy of Health and Human Services and the D.C. Department of Behavioral Health did not respond to the Washington Examiner\u2019s request for comment."

      "text": "President Donald Trump announced his plan Monday to take over law enforcement in the District of Columbia temporarily, and unlike many of his official actions, which have been stalled by lawsuits from left-wing groups, the laws he cited on Monday make it unlikely that his plan will succumb to a legal fight this time.\nTrump\u2019s authority to combat crime in Washington by asserting federal control is clearly outlined in law, but certain time and use limitations apply, which could open the door to lawsuits down the line.\nHow Trump is taking over DC law enforcement\nTrump issued a pair of orders Monday that authorized the deployment of the D.C. National Guard and instituted federal control of the Metropolitan Police Department.\nFor the deployment of the National Guard, Trump authorized the use of the troops as commander in chief of the District of Columbia National Guard. While the commanders in chief of the National Guard in states are governors, the D.C. National Guard\u2019s commander in chief is the president, rather than the mayor of the district.\nFor the federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department, the president invoked section 740 of the Home Rule Act to take emergency control of the local police department.\nThe Home Rule Act, which was passed in 1973, gave district residents more direct control over local affairs, including the creation of an elected mayor and council. The law divested some of the federal government\u2019s direct authority in overseeing the district\u2019s governance, but it also included a provision allowing for the president to take control of the police force if he \u201cdetermines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist which require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes.\u201d\nSection 740 of the Home Rule Act gives the president 48 hours of control of the Metropolitan Police Department, unless he has \u201cnotified the Chairmen and ranking minority members of the Committees on the District of Columbia of the Senate and the House of Representatives\u201d of his intent to federalize the police force. If he gives the necessary notice to the relevant chairmen, the president may exert federal control of the MPD for 30 days before requiring an act of Congress for further extension beyond that.\nTrump issued an order declaring that \u201cspecial conditions of an emergency nature exist,\u201d requiring him to take control of the MPD on Monday morning.\nFederal takeover of DC law enforcement vs LA troop deployment\nTrump\u2019s deployment of the National Guard to Washington has invited some comparisons to his deployment of the National Guard to quell protests that turned violent in Los Angeles in June, but there are key differences between the two deployments.\nTrump\u2019s deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, which is facing a pair of legal challenges in federal court, is going to trial this week. California officials accuse the Trump administration of violating the Posse Comitatus Act, a law prohibiting troops from being used for regular law enforcement activities. The Trump administration has denied that its deployment of troops to Los Angeles violates the law, arguing the National Guard members were deployed to protect federal property and officers amid unrest over federal immigration operations in the city.\nTrump\u2019s use of the National Guard in Washington differs from previous uses in two ways: the locations to which troops could be deployed and the force used.\nMuch of the District of Columbia is federally owned and operated property, including the National Mall, the U.S. Capitol complex, and various monuments, parks, and squares scattered throughout the city. The federal properties around the city are the responsibility of the federal government. Unlike Los Angeles, where there are few federal properties, they can be more directly policed by federal authorities.\nAnother factor that could work in Trump\u2019s favor is that the Justice Department has recognized the D.C. National Guard for decades as having wider federal authorities for regular law enforcement than other National Guards.\nA legal opinion issued by the Justice Department under President George H.W. Bush in 1989 found that because the D.C. National Guard\u2019s usage in the district is not being called into federal service and instead acts as a militia for the district, it is not subject to the restrictions of the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars regular law enforcement. Because the president is already the commander in chief of the D.C. National Guard, he does not need to call up troops into federal service but can activate them at the militia level.\nHave officials hinted at coming legal challenges?\nD.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb said Monday that his office is \u201cconsidering all of our options and will do what is necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents.\u201d\nDemocracy Forward, a left-wing law group that has launched various lawsuits against the Trump administration, also said it was \u201cmonitoring this situation and considering legal options\u201d after Trump\u2019s Monday announcement.\nWhile Trump\u2019s federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department is authorized in the D.C. Home Rule Act, any bid to extend it beyond 30 days without congressional authorization would likely result in a lawsuit.\nMayor Muriel Bowser, at a press conference on Monday, deferred to Schwalb\u2019s statement but also noted she would comply with the invocation of the Home Rule Act provision, giving Trump emergency control. She acknowledged that city officials could contest the emergency declaration federalizing the D.C. police force but conceded that the president\u2019s authority \u201cis pretty broad\u201d under the statute.\nTRUMP FEDERALIZES DC POLICE AND ACTIVATES NATIONAL GUARD TO COMBAT CRIME: \u2018TAKE OUR CAPITAL BACK\u2019\nD.C. Councilman Charles Allen said in a statement that the president\u2019s \u201cunnecessary, unwarranted\u201d and \u201cdangerous escalation of power\u201d was being done \u201csimply because he can.\u201d\nWhile the DOJ\u2019s legal opinion on the D.C. National Guard\u2019s deployment has stood for years, it could be tested by a lawsuit challenging the deployment. The D.C. National Guard has been deployed several times in recent years, including after the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, but the provision of the Home Rule Act, taking federal control of the MPD, has never been invoked."

      "text": "Two juveniles charged in the attack of former Department of Government Efficiency staffer Edward Coristine will be held in custody at the District of Columbia\u2019s Youth Services Center after a request to move them was denied.\nJudge Kendra Davis Briggs, a Biden-nominated associate judge for the D.C. Superior Court, denied the two Maryland juveniles\u2019 requests for less restrictive detention conditions, according to the Washington Post.\nThe hearing follows the attack and carjacking targeting Coristine, 19, who goes by \u201cBig Balls\u201d, and Emily Bryant, his \u201csignificant other,\u201d according to the filed police report of the incident. The carjacking occurred at 3:01 a.m. on Aug. 3 on the 1400 block of Swann Street NW.\nBriggs presided over Monday\u2019s hearing following President Donald Trump\u2019s press conference in which he declared a \u201ccrime emergency\u201d in Washington, federalized the Metropolitan Police Department, and mobilized the D.C. National Guard. Trump, who has repeatedly floated threats of federalizing the capital city, amped up his rhetoric against D.C. home rule after the attack against Coristine.\n\u201cCrime in Washington, D.C., is totally out of control,\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Aug. 5, which included an apparent photo of Coristine after the attack. \u201cLocal \u2018youths\u2019 and gang members, some only 14, 15, and 16-years-old, are randomly attacking, mugging, maiming, and shooting innocent Citizens, at the same time knowing that they will be almost immediately released. The most recent victim was beaten mercilessly by local thugs.\u201d\nMetro police officers observed a group of about 10 youths who surrounded and began \u201cassaulting\u201d Coristine, while Bryant remained in Coristine\u2019s vehicle parked on Swann Street, according to the police report. Coristine told officers in the report that leading up to the attack, \u201che saw the suspects approach and make a comment about taking the vehicle\u201d. The police officer apprehended two suspects, whom Coristine and Bryant positively identified, while the other juveniles fled on foot.\nThe two 15-year-olds arrested by the officers appeared in court at the hearing on Monday, according to the Washington Post. The attorney for the juvenile girl requested a lesser detention level as she said there was no compelling evidence her client was one of Coristine\u2019s attackers, though she was in the area. The attorney for the juvenile boy also requested a different detention, asking for his client to be put in a shelter house.\nDC POLICE UNION BLAMES COUNCILMAN FOR CRIME SURGE: \u2018IT\u2019S YOUR FAULT\u2019\nThe D.C. Superior Court declined to comment on Briggs\u2019s decision as the case is a juvenile case and therefore confidential in the D.C. Superior Court Family Court Division.\nD.C.\u2019s Youth Services Center, where the two juveniles are reported to be held, is the district\u2019s 88-bed youth detention center with an on-site youth education program through the Maya Angelou Academy and provides around-the-clock care for detainees, according to the D.C. Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services website."

      "text": "The United States has vehemently rejected the International Maritime Organization\u2019s \u201cNet-Zero Framework\u201d proposal, established earlier this year, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the global shipping industry by imposing the first international carbon tax on vessels.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy released a statement Tuesday lambasting the framework, saying the administration would not accept any international agreement that would \u201cunduly or unfairly burden\u201d the U.S.\n\u201cWhatever its stated goals, the proposed framework is effectively a global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable UN organization,\u201d the statement read.\nThe secretaries claimed that the fuel standards detailed in the net-zero framework would ultimately benefit China and make it impossible to use lower-emissions options, such as liquified natural gas and biofuels, to fuel the shipping industry.\n\u201cUnder this framework, ships will have to pay fees for failing to meet unattainable fuel standards and emissions targets,\u201d they continued. \u201cThese fees will drive up energy and transportation and leisure cruise costs. Even small vessels would incur millions of dollars in fees, directly driving up costs for American consumers.\u201d\nMembers of the International Maritime Organization, a specialized agency within the United Nations that oversees the shipping industry, came to an agreement in April on charging shipping companies for greenhouse gas emissions released by their vessels.\nThe fee is intended to accelerate a transition to the use of cleaner fuels.\nIf ship owners exceed certain thresholds of emissions, they would face a minimum tax of $100 for every ton of carbon dioxide emitted over the lowest baseline.\nThose that exceed higher emissions thresholds will be forced to pay a $380 fee.\nIf adopted, the tax would go into effect in 2028.\nThe U.S. was notably absent from the agreement, as the Trump administration leveled threats against members who supported the fee at the time. U.S. officials reiterated those threats on Tuesday.\n\u201cOur fellow IMO members should be on notice that we will look for their support against this action and not hesitate to retaliate or explore remedies for our citizens should this endeavor fail,\u201d the secretaries said.\nThe international tax is expected to raise upward of $40 billion by 2030 and reduce emissions by 8% in the same time frame. The agreement did not go as far as some members had wanted, as several developing nations had hoped to see a blanket levy on the industry.\nOut of the 176 IMO member states, 63 voted in favor of the agreement in April, including China, Brazil, and the EU. Sixteen members voted against.\nThe framework could be adopted as soon as October, but it will require a two-thirds majority vote in favor.\nUN SETS CARBON TAX ON SHIPPING IN DEFIANCE OF TRUMP THREAT\nIt was not clear what type of reciprocal measures the Trump administration would impose if the framework is approved this fall. The U.S. only makes up roughly 0.57% of worldwide commercial shipping, with around 180 vessels bearing U.S. flags.\n\u201cThe Trump Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists,\u201d the secretaries said Tuesday. \u201cWe will fight hard to protect the American people and their economic interests.\u201d"
