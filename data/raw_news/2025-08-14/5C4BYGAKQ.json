  "description": "The NBA is getting ready to jump into the 2025-26 season with new TV partners, a stacked Western conference and a wide-open Eastern conference.",
  "content": "With new TV partners for the NBA, massive intrigue in the stacked Western conference and a wide-open Eastern conference, the league is cannonballing into the 2025-26 season.\n\nStarting with opening night on NBC on Oct. 21, followed by two nights of games on ESPN and then a Friday night on Amazon Prime, marquee players, fascinating matchups and championship contenders will be featured on the NBA\u2019s national TV schedule, which was released Thursday, Aug. 14.\n\nNBC rejoins coverage of the league after a two-decade absence, and Amazon Prime gets its first shot at NBA games as part of the NBA\u2019s new, 11-year, $76 billion TV deal. ESPN/ABC remains part of the league\u2019s coverage as well.\n\nHere are unique details of the NBA\u2019s 2025-26 schedule:\n\nWhat to know about the 2025-26 NBA schedule\n\nThis season, there are 247 national TV games, up from 172 in 2024-25.\n\nAs part of the new TV deal, in general, Monday NBA games are on Peacock; Tuesday on NBC; Wednesday on ESPN; Thursday on Prime Video; Friday on Prime Video and ESPN; Saturday on Prime Video in the afternoon and ABC at night; and Sunday on ABC in the afternoon and NBC at night.\n\nESPN and ABC also have the five Christmas games plus the NBA Finals.\n\nPrime Video will feature doubleheaders on Fridays and stream the quarterfinals, semifinals and final of the NBA Cup and all six play-in games.\n\nNBC and Peacock kick off the season with two games on Oct. 21 and will air the four Martin Luther King Jr. Day games. NBC and Peacock are also home to NBA All-Star Weekend events, including All-Star Saturday night and the All-Star Game on Feb. 15.\n\nThe NBA will play games on Election Day, Novermber 4, this season \u2013 which it did not do in 2022, 2023 and 2024.\n\nEach team has at least two national TV games with the defending champion Oklahoma City Thunder, Los Angeles Lakers, New York Knicks and Golden State Warriors appearing on 34 national TV games.\n\nThe average number of back-to-back games for each team is 14.4, a tad down from 14.9 back-to-backs per team in 2024-25. No team has more than 16 back-to-backs, and a team will play never play the day before games during opening-week national TV games; all Emirates NBA Cup games; all Christmas games; the four-game Peacock/NBC schedule on Martin Luther King Jr. Day; the 10-game ABC Saturday schedule and eight-game ABC Sunday schedule; and the 11-game NBC Sunday schedule.\n\nThe NBA plans to launch a digital feature that will make it easier for fans to watch and stream games through NBA.com, the NBA app, team platforms and partner sites.\n\nOffseason moves once again altered the NBA landscape. Here are a few notable players who will visit their former team for the first time in 2025-26:\n\u2022 Khris Middleton was traded from the Bucks to the Washington Wizards last season but will play at Milwaukee for the first time since that trade on Oct. 22. He was part of the Bucks\u2019 2021 championship.\n\u2022 The Houston Rockets' big new addition, Kevin Durant, plays at Phoenix on Nov. 24.\n\u2022 Myles Turner left Indiana and signed with the Bucks in free agency and will return to play the Pacers on Nov. 3.\n\u2022 Boston traded Jrue Holiday, who helped the Celtics win the title in 2024, to Portland, and Holiday and the Blazers play at Boston on Jan. 26. Two days later on Jan. 28, Kristaps Porzingis, who also won a title with the Celtics in 2024, returns to Boston as a member of the Atlanta Hawks.\n\u2022 Michael Porter Jr. won a title with Denver in 2023, but the Nuggets traded him to Brooklyn in the offseason. The Nets travel to Denver for a Jan. 29 game.\n\u2022 Brook Lopez, like Middleton, was a key figure on Milwaukee\u2019s 2021 title squad, and he undoubtedly will receive a warm welcome when the Clippers play at Milwaukee on March 29.\n\nThe 1,230-game schedule from Oct. 21 through April 12 is loaded with quality games. We take a look at the 25 games you can\u2019t miss, including Houston at Oklahoma City on opening night and the Los Angeles Lakers at Golden State in the final week of the regular season.

Plus, it's the tip-off game and former Thunder player Kevin Durant gets to watch OKC raise the banner.\nDenver Nuggets at Minnesota Timberwolves\nMonday, Oct. 27 at 9:30 p.m. (Peacock exclusive)\nThese two teams typically play each other physically, and it's a rematch of the thrilling 2024 conference semifinal series that went seven games.\nOrlando Magic at Atlanta Hawks\nTuesday, Nov. 4 at 8 p.m. (NBC and Peacock)\nBoth these teams retooled \u2014 with the Magic adding Desmond Bane and the Hawks nabbing Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is and Nickeil Alexander-Walker \u2014 and both could be darkhorses in a wide-open Eastern Conference.\nMinnesota Timberwolves at New York Knicks\nWednesday, Nov. 5 at 7:30 p.m. (ESPN)\nIt's another battle between familiar opponents, with the ramifications of the Karl-Anthony Towns-Julius Randle trade still unsettled.\nMilwaukee Bucks at Cleveland Cavaliers\nMonday, Nov. 17 at 8 p.m. (Peacock exclusive)\nGiannis Antetokounmpo may use a game like this as a barometer to see where Milwaukee stacks up against some of the better teams in the East.\nGolden State Warriors at Miami Heat\nWednesday, Nov. 19 at 7 p.m. (ESPN)\nAlthough this won't be Jimmy Butler's first game back in Miami \u2014 he played back in March \u2014 Butler didn't acknowledge Heat players Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro before or after that game.\nHouston Rockets at Golden State Warriors\nWednesday, Nov. 26 at 10 p.m. (ESPN)\nThis is a rematch of the fascinating, physical first-round playoff series from last year, a series in which there was a scuffle seemingly every night.\nNew York Knicks at Detroit Pistons\nMonday, Jan. 5, 2026 at 7 p.m. (Peacock exclusive)\nAnother rematch of a fascinating physical playoff series, this will be a good test to see if the Pistons have developed further.\nOklahoma City Thunder at Cleveland Cavaliers\nMonday, Jan. 19, 2026 at 2:30 p.m. (NBC and Peacock)\nThe Thunder and Cavaliers had the best records in the NBA last season, each winning at least 64 games, with the Thunder winning the title.\nIndiana Pacers at Oklahoma City Thunder\nFriday, Jan. 23 at 9:30 p.m. (Amazon Prime)\nWith star Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton out and center Myles Turner no longer in Indy, this matchup won't have the same juice that a typical NBA Finals rematch would have. It's still an intriguing watch, as the Pacers play a style that can give OKC fits.\nLos Angeles Lakers at Cleveland Cavaliers\nWednesday, Jan. 28, 2026 at 7 p.m. (ESPN)\nWill this be LeBron James\u2019 final game in Cleveland, where he started his career and led the franchise to its only NBA championship?\nLos Angeles Clippers at Denver Nuggets\nFriday, Jan. 30, 2026 at 10 p.m. (ESPN)\nThe Nuggets beat the Clippers in a seven-game first round series last season and both are eyeing a deep run this season \u2014 the Nuggets relying on Nikola Joki\u0107 and the Clippers relying on a bunch of players in their mid-30s.\nMinnesota Timberwolves at Memphis Grizzlies\nMonday, Feb. 2 at 9:30 p.m. (Peacock)\nBy this point in the season, we should have an idea of who the Grizzlies are under new coach Tuomas Iisalo, and whether he can make Memphis a contender with its young, athletic roster.\nOklahoma City Thunder at San Antonio Spurs\nWednesday, Feb. 4 at 9:30 p.m. (ESPN)\nThe Thunder are the team of the present and future with MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in the Western Conference, but the Spurs are climbing with Victor Wembanyama.\nDalla Mavericks at San Antonio Spurs\nSaturday, Feb. 7 at 6 p.m. (Prime)\nThis should be an entertaining matchup between this year's No. 1 overall draft pick in Mavericks forward Cooper Flagg and the 2023 one in Spurs forward Victor Wembanyama.\nNew York Knicks at Cleveland Cavaliers\nTuesday, Feb. 24 at 8 p.m. (NBC and Peacock)\nOn paper, these are the two best teams in the Eastern Conference, and this very well could be a preview of the conference finals.\nCleveland Cavaliers at Detroit Pistons\nFriday, Feb. 27 at 7 p.m. (ESPN)\nIf the Pistons are to break out further as legitimate contenders in the East, this will be an appropriate test.\nHouston Rockets at Miami Heat\nSaturday, Feb. 28 at 3 p.m. (Prime)\nLast season, these two teams fought when Rockets forward Amen Thompson tossed Heat guard Tyler Herro to the floor. Some bad blood may linger.\nSan Antonio Spurs at New York Knicks\nSunday, March 1 at 1 p.m. (ABC)\nVictor Wembanyama compiled 42 points, 18 rebounds, four assists and four blocks at Madison Square Garden last season. However, the Knicks won 117-114.\nDallas Mavericks at Boston Celtics\nFriday, March 6 at 7 p.m. (ESPN)\nA Maine native, Cooper Flagg grew up a Celtics fan and the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 draft gets his first chance to play in the Garden.\nDenver Nuggets at Los Angeles Lakers\nSaturday, March 14 at 8:30 p.m. (ABC)\nSeemingly every time these two teams play, the games tend to be thrilling and go down to the wire.\nSan Antonio Spurs at Milwaukee Bucks\nSaturday, March 28 at 3 p.m. (Prime)\nJust sit back and watch Giannis Antetokounmpo go at Victor Wembanyama, a matchup both players relish.\nLos Angeles Lakers at Dallas Mavericks\nSunday, April 5 at 7:30 p.m. (NBC and Peacock)\nWho can resist Luka Don\u010di\u0107 returning to Dallas and playing against the team that traded him for Anthony Davis?\nLos Angeles Lakers at Golden State Warriors\nThursday, April 9 at 10 p.m. (Amazon Prime)\nThe last LeBron James vs. Steph Curry matchup? Is there any way they could be teammates in 2026-27?\nOklahoma City Thunder at Denver Nuggets\nFriday, April 10 at 10 p.m. (Amazon Prime)\nThe Thunder needed seven games to beat the Nuggets in the second round in May.

      "text": "NBA media rights deal finalized with ESPN, Amazon, NBC. What to know about megadeal\nLive sporting events still pay.\nThat\u2019s the message derived from the NBA\u2019s new TV and media rights deal that will net the league approximately $76 billion in a 11-year deal \u2013 $6.9 billion per season \u2013 from Disney (ABC/ESPN), NBC and Amazon, a person familiar with the deal told USA TODAY Sports.\nThe person was not authorized to speak publicly because details of the deal were still being tweaked. The NBA's Board of Governors, scheduled to meet next week, still must approve the agreement.\nThe Athletic was first to report the news.\nThe NBA\u2019s new TV deal annually almost triples the current agreement which began in 2015-16 and ends after the 2024-25 season. The new contract will kick in starting with 2025-26 and end in 2036-37.\nTurner Sports (TNT) is not part of the new agreement. Turner Sports does have an opportunity to match a portion of the deal, but the match involves more than a dollar amount, according to the person who spoke with USA TODAY Sports.\nDisney will pay $2.6 billion, NBC $2.5 billion and Amazon $1.8 billion annually in a deal that introduces a more prominent streaming service to the NBA\u2019s media partners. Bringing Amazon into the fold is not a surprise given it has a deal to stream WNBA games, and the league has crafted a working relationship with the company.\nThe return of the NBA on NBC\nCould \"Roundball Rock\" make a comeback? The \"NBA on NBC\" theme song, one of the most iconic in history, could make another appearance as the Peacock network is back in the basketball business, agreeing to a broadcast deal to carry the league's third package of games. NBC takes over for Turner Sports.\nComcast\u2019s NBCUniversal reportedly will pay $2.5 billion a year for its package. The Finals are still scheduled to air exclusively on ABC and ESPN.\nOverall, the NBA has agreed to a new media rights deal that would pay the league just about $7 billion a season and commence in the 2025-2026 season.\nThe previous media deal, announced in 2014, was worth $24 billion \u2212 $2.67 billion annually \u2212and continued the league's relationship with ESPN/ABC and TNT.\nAmazon's part in the NBA TV deal\nThe NBA is now in the streaming business.\nThe league and Amazon agreed to a deal in which the streaming service would pay $1.8 billion a year to broadcast games. The company's deep pockets would add to its sports portfolio, which includes the NFL, which it pays $1 billion a year for \"Thursday Night Football.\"\nAmazon is slated to become the home of the NBA's In-Season tournament, per reports.\nESPN and ABC have had the premiere NBA regular season and postseason package since the 2002-03 season, snagging those rights from NBC, which aired games for 12 years during the height of the Michael Jordan era.\nWhat does this mean for the NBA TNT crew?\n\"Inside the NBA,\" Turner's outstanding studio show, could see its last season in 2025.\nErnie Johnson said that he would remain at Turner if the network lost its NBA rights. Charles Barkley said if TNT moves on from basketball, he'll become a free agent and is not sure about the show moving forward, especially after Johnson's comments.\nThe show has won 18 Sports Emmy Awards, including six for best weekly show, with Johnson and Barkley winning multiple Emmys for best studio host and studio analyst, respectively."
