      "title": "Powell to give his last Jackson Hole speech under watchful gaze of Wall Street and the White House",
      "summary": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to speak at the Jackson Hole symposium amid conflicting economic signals: weak July hiring and higher-than‑target inflation. While a rate cut could appease Wall Street and the Trump administration, the Fed may hold rates steady to curb inflation, reflecting its dual mandate. Powell’s tenure has been marked by political pressure from President Trump, including criticism over Fed projects and attempts to influence Fed officials, yet he has maintained a calm, data‑driven approach. The upcoming speech will likely weigh the need for a rate cut against the risk of stoking inflation, with economists divided on the optimal path forward.",
