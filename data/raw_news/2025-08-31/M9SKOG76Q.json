  "description": "VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESS Newswire / August 28, 2025 / CoTec Holdings Corp. (TSXV:CTH)(OTCQB:CTHCF) (\u201cCoTec\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is pleased to announce the completion of its 2025 sonic drilling and bulk sampling testing programme at the Lac Jeannine Iron Tailings Project, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada (\u201cLac Jeannine\u201d, or the \u201cProject\u201d).

  "content": "VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESS Newswire / August 28, 2025 / CoTec Holdings Corp. (TSXV:CTH)(OTCQB:CTHCF) (\u201cCoTec\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is pleased to announce the completion of its 2025 sonic drilling and bulk sampling testing programme at the Lac Jeannine Iron Tailings Project, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada (\u201cLac Jeannine\u201d, or the \u201cProject\u201d). The Company has engaged Corem to complete the metallurgical testing and has commenced a process to appoint a EPCM provider for the Feasibility Study. The Feasibility Study is expected to commence in Q3, 2025.\n\nJulian Treger, CoTec CEO commented; \u201cCoTec has progressed its discussions with strategic partners to move rapidly onto preparation of a Feasibility Study with the support of all stakeholders, including the Government of Qu\u00e9bec, First Nations and other interested parties. The results from this next phase of drilling and bulk sample collection will allow CoTec to increase its current resource estimate for Lac Jeannine and potentially unlock additional material outside of the tailings dam to reprocess.\n\nThe Company is very excited to commence a Feasibility Study regarding the recovery and production of critical mineral iron ore concentrate at competitive cost structures which can deliver high purity iron concentrates for the green steel industry. The Lac Jeannine Project offers great potential for the resource industry to recover the economic benefit of large Fe tailing sites.\u201d\n\nIn June 2024 CoTec announced the completion of an initial Mineral Resource Estimate (the \u201cMRE\u201d) and positive Preliminary Economic Assessment (\u201cPEA\u201d) for the Project[i]. Based on open-pit extraction methods and the production of a gravity concentrate via conventional processing techniques and at a discount rate of 7.0% (and based solely on the MRE), the pre-tax NPV is US$93.6M, and its IRR is 38%, and the after tax NPV is US$59.5M, and its IRR is 30%. As part of the Feasibility Study, the Company is including the application of the Salter Cyclone Multi-Gravity Separators (\u201cMGS\u201d) technology for the recovery of additional iron ore from the Project.\n\nThe completed drilling targeted upgrading the existing Inferred Mineral Resource of 73 million tonnes (Mt) at 6.7% total Fe for 4.9 Mt of contained total Fe to Indicated and to extend the Project to a larger portion of the Adjacent Tailings. The inclusion of the Adjacent Tailings has the potential to almost double the life of mine with no additional capex unlocking substantial upside potential.\n\u2022 An infill and expansion programme totalling 572 meters of sonic drilling for 12 holes, drilled up to 58 meters, was completed on the historical tailings of the previous Lac Jeannine iron ore mine operated by the Qu\u00e9bec Cartier Mining Company between 1959 and 1985.\n\u2022 Additional bulk sampling has also been concluded, a total of 7 tonnes of tailings and waste rock dumps were recovered to assess their iron content and has been shipped to Corem\u2019s testing facility in Qu\u00e9bec.\n\u2022 Bulk sampling and assay results are expected in Q4 2025.\n\nThe Independent Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101 for the Lac Jeannine Mineral Resource, Mr. Christian Beaulieu, P.Geo., is a member of l\u2019Ordre des g\u00e9ologues du Qu\u00e9bec (#1072). The Qualified Person has reviewed and approved the scientific and technical content of this announcement relating to the Lac Jeannine Mineral Resource.\n\nAbout CoTec\n\nCoTec Holdings Corp. (TSXV:CTH)(OTCQB:CTHCF) is redefining the future of resource extraction and recycling.

      "text": "CoTec is a next-generation resource company focused on transforming undervalued mineral assets into high-margin operations through the deployment of breakthrough extraction and processing technologies.\nOur approach targets low-grade and complex deposits that have historically been uneconomic. By leveraging technologies that dramatically reduce water and energy usage compared to traditional methods, CoTec unlocks new sources of critical minerals with improved economics and sustainability.\nWe currently hold investments in six transformative technologies and three mineral assets, providing exposure to key commodities such as rare earths, iron ore, and copper. Our strategy is to acquire and operate assets where our technologies offer a clear advantage\u2014creating value through scalability, strategic partnerships, and ultimately spinning off these businesses as standalone operations.\nCoTec is publicly listed on the TSX Venture Exchange and OTCQB under the symbols TSX-V: CTH and OTCQB: CTHCF.\nCoTec invests in disruptive, scalable technologies that have the potential to fundamentally change how minerals and metals are extracted, refined, and processed. We focus on early-stage innovations with commercial potential and back them with decades of operational experience and a highly engaged Board of Directors.\nWhat sets CoTec apart is our dual network: deep roots in the global resource extraction industry, and strong connections to technology funds, universities, innovation labs, and forward-thinking mining professionals. This unique positioning enables us to accelerate the development and deployment of next-generation technologies.\nFor more advanced technologies, CoTec pursues joint ventures and partnerships to fast-track commercial applications. In an industry often slow to adopt change, we bring an entrepreneurial mindset and a nimble approach\u2014ready to move where incumbents hesitate.\nWe scale value through a two-pronged strategy:\nCoTec is building a new kind of resource company\u2014one that brings together innovation and ownership to deliver profitability, efficiency, and long-term value.\nAt CoTec, we believe the future of resource production will be defined by innovation. We\u2019re not just following the transition\u2014we\u2019re building it, by backing breakthrough technologies that can unlock value where others can\u2019t.\nGlobal demand for critical minerals is accelerating, but traditional mining methods alone won\u2019t meet the moment. CoTec is pioneering a new model: we invest in and deploy proven, disruptive technologies that make it possible to extract and process materials more efficiently, more cleanly, and from sources previously considered uneconomic\u2014such as legacy stockpiles, tailings, and recycled material.\nWhat sets us apart is our strategy. We don\u2019t just fund technology\u2014we own it, and integrate it into undervalued assets we control, creating a clear path from innovation to production. Our goal is to build a portfolio of scalable, cost-effective operations that can meet the growing demand for critical minerals\u2014with faster timelines, lower capital intensity, and stronger margins.\nWe\u2019ve already screened hundreds of technologies, invested in only the most credible and commercially viable, and are now entering the next phase: applying them to real-world assets to create long-term value."
