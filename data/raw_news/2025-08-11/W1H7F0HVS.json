  "content": "Published scientific research fuels the breakthroughs that shape our world \u2014 but what happens when that research is totally fake?\n\nResearchers at Northwestern University said the number of junk scientific publications is growing, and bad actors are profiting.\n\n\"These people are ruining it for all of us,\" said Northwestern University researcher and professor of engineering science and applied math Lu\u00eds Amaral.\n\nAmaral and fellow Northwestern researcher Reese Richardson said they have always known there were fake scientific studies floating around.\n\nBut it wasn't until they started studying the issue \u2014 with the help of several helpful sleuths \u2014 that they discovered the problem was much bigger than anyone thought. They showed CBS News Chicago four research papers on four different types of cells \u2014 but the papers all \"borrowed\" the same set of images.\n\n\"We did this analysis, and we found out something that was extraordinarily scary,\" said Amaral. \"Essentially, the number of fraudulent papers is doubling every year and a half.\"\n\nAmaral and Richardson's study on the problem was published earlier this month. In a nutshell, the publication of fraudulent science is outpacing the publication of legitimate science.\n\n\"Everywhere we looked, we were seeing indications that there was systematic fraud being produced,\" Richardson said.\n\nBut why would anyone spend the time publishing fake research? Amaral and Richardson say there are two main reasons.\n\nThe first is buying a reputation.\n\n\"They do this out in the open,\" said Richardson. \"It is not hard to find paper-mill advertisements at all.\"\n\nAmaral and Richardson showed CBS News Chicago hundreds of advertisements that have appeared online \u2014 asking for anywhere from $100 a publication to about $3,000 in exchange for authorship.\n\nThe second reason for the fakes is to push for a certain point of view \u2014 for example, backing a dietary supplement for financial gain.\n\n\"So there are lots of people with a point of view, and it has become very easy for them to make it appear like there are hundreds of experts, thousands of publications that are very highly cited about all of these,\" said Amaral.\n\nIn a 2024 post on his blog, Richardson specifically cited an example of how a researcher with a financial interest in the turmeric industry was able to push fake research on the benefits of turmeric.\n\nRichardson wrote that Bharat Aggarwal, who worked at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston from 1989 to 2015, authored more than 120 articles about the compound curcumin in turmeric \u2014 claiming that it therapeutic potential for cancers, Alzheimer's disease, and most recently, COVID-19.\n\nAt first, MD Anderson seemed to endorse Aggarwal's research, and the FAQ page on the cancer center's website even recommended that visitors buy curcumin wholesale from a company that paid Aggarwal as a speaker, Richardson wrote. But in 2012, MD Anderson Cancer Center launched a research fraud probe against Aggarwal, which led to the retraction of 30 articles \u2014 some of them about curcumin, Richardson wrote.\n\nStill, while Aggarwal retired from MD Anderson in 2015, he has gone on authoring articles and appearing at conferences, Richardson wrote.\n\nCurcumin does not work well as a treatment for any disease, Richardson wrote. But even though Aggarwal's research has been discredited, the volume of studies published on curcumin keeps growing \u2014 and they also often show signs of fraud, Richardson wrote.\n\nAmaral and Richardson say they're raising the red flag about the fakes now \u2014 at a time when the future of federal funding for some legitimate science is uncertain.\n\n\"There is only greater competition, and a more scarce pool of resources, for scientists to use and do genuine science,\" said Richardson.\n\n\"If actually, there is an entire stream of research that is actually making false claims\u2026 it puts all of our health at risk,\" added Amaral.\n\nThe authors argue their findings should serve as a wake-up call to the scientific community, which needs to act before we all lose confidence in the scientific process.",

      "text": "Bharat B. Aggarwal is an Indian-American biochemist who worked at MD Anderson Cancer Center from 1989 to 2015. His research focused on potential anti-cancer effects and therapeutic applications of herbs and spices. Aggarwal was particularly drawn to curcumin, a non-toxic compound found in turmeric that has long been staple in Ayurvedic systems of medicine. He authored more than 120 articles about the compound from 1994 to 2020. These articles reported that curcumin had therapeutic potential for a variety of diseases, including various cancers, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and, more recently, COVID-19. In his 2011 book Healing Spices: How to Use 50 Everyday and Exotic Spices to Boost Health and Beat Disease, Aggarwal recommends \u201ctaking a daily 500 mg curcumin supplement for general health\u201d.\nMD Anderson Cancer Center initially appeared to be fully on board with Aggarwal\u2019s work. At one point, their website\u2019s FAQ page recommended visitors buy curcumin wholesale from a company for which Aggarwal was a paid speaker (see \u201cSpice Healer\u201d, Scientific American). However, in 2012 (following observations of image manipulation raised by pseudonymous sleuth Juuichi Jigen), MD Anderson Cancer Center launched a research fraud probe against Aggarwal which eventually led to 30 of Aggarwal\u2019s articles being retracted. Only some of these studies were about curcumin specifically, but most concerned similar natural products.\nRetractions rarely number this high for a single author; according to the Retraction Watch leaderboard, only 26 other people have authored this many retracted studies. Aggarwal\u2019s retracted articles feature dozens of instances of spliced Western blots and duplicated images, as well as several instances where mice were implanted with tumors exceeding volumes considered ethical. PubPeer commenters have noted irregularities in many publications beyond the 30 that have already been retracted. Aggarwal retired from M.D. Anderson in 2015, but has continued to author articles and appear at conferences.\nCurcumin doesn\u2019t work well as a therapeutic agent for any disease. Though it is safe for human consumption in most forms and will show activity in essentially any in vitro assay you throw at it (via a process known as assay interference), no well-powered clinical trials have ever found it to be an effective medicine. Consider the following summary from Nelson et al. 2017:\n\u201c[No] form of curcumin, or its closely related analogues, appears to possess the properties required for a good drug candidate (chemical stability, high water solubility, potent and selective target activity, high bioavailability, broad tissue distribution, stable metabolism, and low toxicity). The in vitro interference properties of curcumin do, however, offer many traps that can trick unprepared researchers into misinterpreting the results of their investigations.\u201d\nDespite curcumin\u2019s apparent lack of therapeutic promise, the volume of research produced on curcumin grows each year. More than 2,000 studies involving the compound are published annually. Many of these studies bear signs of fraud and involvement of paper mills. As of 2020, the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) has spent more than 150 million USD funding projects related to curcumin. Funding increased drastically in the 2007 fiscal year, shortly after Aggarwal began to publish in earnest about the compound and the same year he declared curcumin \u201cthe Indian solid gold\u201d.\nThis proliferation of research on curcumin has fueled its popularity as a dietary supplement. Grand View Research estimated the global market for curcumin as a pharmaceutical to be around 30 million USD in 2020. Manufacturers are routinely scolded by the United States Food and Drug Administration for making false claims about the health effects of these supplements.\nCurcumin is a valuable case study in how unimpeded fraud can distort an entire research field to the detriment of genuine research. Despite indications that Aggarwal\u2019s research on curcumin ought not to be considered reliable, a majority of articles and an even greater majority of NIH-funded studies about curcumin still cite Aggarwal\u2019s work. It seems unlikely that this explosion in funding and research would have materialized if Aggarwal had not engaged in large-scale research fraud.\nScientific fraud, especially at this scale, is alarming. However, there is a common refrain that instances like this are an exceedingly rare, insular threat and that any harm done to human knowledge by them will inevitably be neutralized by science\u2019s remarkable tendency for self-correction. Once the history books are written, these instances will be little more than footnotes, parked between the Bates method and orgone.\nHowever, self-correction has a high cost in the present: hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars, countless hours spent toiling by junior scientists, thousands of laboratory animals sacrificed, thousands of cancer patients enrolled in clinical trials for ineffective treatments, and countless people who have eschewed expensive and invasive but effective cancer treatment in favor of a store-bought spice, encouraged by research steeped in lies.\nLeave a comment"

      "text": "Rash of shootings in Chicago's Austin neighborhood may have stemmed from party, sources say\nTwo people are dead, and at least seven others were injured, in a series of three different shootings in the South Austin neighborhood on Chicago's West Side overnight Saturday into Sunday.\nSocial media posts showed a huge party in the area as police arrived. Police have not said if the shootings are all connected, but CBS News Chicago has learned they may have stemmed from the party.\nSome social media posters showed hundreds of people in the streets in South Austin overnight, calling it a Club Jroy event.\nAnother post said the event went on for 10 blocks. Some videos also show the start of some of the violence.\nSocial media video documented the shooting started around midnight on Lamon Avenue near West End Avenue \u2014 though a police incident report placed the first shooting at 1:40 a.m.\nIn that incident, Chicago police said officers responded to a person shot and found the victim, a 20-year-old woman, with multiple gunshot wounds to her arms. She was taken to Mt. Sinai Hospital, where she was listed in good condition.\nJust before 3 a.m., a mass shooting transpired about a block away, around West End and La Crosse avenues. A woman was killed and five others were wounded:\n- A 22-year-old woman was shot in the back and was taken to Mt. Sinai Hospital, where she was pronounced dead.\n- A 29-year-old woman was hit in the right elbow and was taken to Rush University Medical Center in good condition.\n- A 29-year-old man was hit in the right leg and taken to Loretto Hospital in critical condition.\n- An 18-year-old man was shot in the chest and left arm and was taken to Stroger Hospital of Cook County in critical condition.\n- An 18-year-old man was grazed on the left hand. He was treated and released on the scene.\n- A 17-year-old boy was hit in the left thigh and was taken to Mt. Sinai in critical condition.\nAt 4:37 a.m., another shooting transpired \u2014 this one on Maypole Avenue near Lavergne Avenue. Two 18-year-old men were approached by two others, who fired guns in the directions of the teens as a fight ensued.\nOne of the 18-year-olds, identified as Kaleb Williams, was hit twice in the back and was taken to Stroger Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. The other 18-year-old was hit in the arm and was taken to Mt. Sinai, initially listed in good condition.\nThe numbers added up quickly.\nA police source told CBS News Chicago that police officers were so outnumbered, they had to call in units from near O'Hare International Airport, the Northwest Side, and downtown.\nCBS News Chicago tried to approach Mayor Brandon Johnson at a public event Sunday, asking the mayor to talk to us about the shootings and police staffing, but he would not stop for comment.\nMeanwhile, the organizers who promoted the event on social media acknowledged in a video clip that he had thought about canceling.\nCBS News Chicago tried reaching the promoter through social media platforms, but have not heard back."

      "text": "A sense of sham\nFrom retirement, David Bimler has embarked on a second career: exposing fraudulent research.\nDavid Bimler is on his way to Paris when we video call, his destination an invite-only symposium of scientific sleuths from around the world. He\u2019s a member of a small community working to expose fake scientific papers\u2014work important enough that the French government is sponsoring their meet-up.\nOver the past decade, Bimler\u2019s work has led to at least a thousand papers being retracted: removed, for good, from the body of global scientific knowledge. Like research itself, these investigations are collaborative. Most of Bimler\u2019s fellow sleuths know him only by his online pseudonym, Smut Clyde: the result of a name generator which suggested combining the name of a pet (Mrs Smut the cat, sadly deceased) with a childhood street (Clyde Road, Wairoa). Binomial nomenclature: the silly version.\nBimler grew up on a Hawke\u2019s Bay farm, and at university, he gravitated towards physics, embarking on a PhD \u201cin the esoteric intricacies of lattice-gauge field theory\u201d, he says, at the University of Canterbury. He became overwhelmed by the feeling that his PhD thesis would make little contribution to human understanding, dropped out, and went travelling. Eventually, he ended up back in a PhD programme\u2014this time in the field of perceptual psychology, investigating how the brain processes various stimuli. His supervisor particularly wanted him to study the cries of babies. \u201cSoon I realised that evolution has designed them not to be very pleasant to listen to,\u201d he says, \u201cand I got more interested in how other people perceive baby cries, rather than listening to them myself.\u201d\nAfter that, Bimler moved into the broader field of perception and colour vision\u2014\u201cthe mechanics of what goes on in our brains, and how we see colours\u201d.\nIn the 1990s, he worked part-time for the Government Communications Security Bureau, better known as the GCSB, and though he cannot say what he was doing, he describes his current detective work as \u201ca natural continuation\u201d of it, \u201can outlet for all of this training I got\u201d.\nIn 2009, back full-time in academia, he started blogging, and hit his stride writing about the dingy corners of science: flimsy research, quack medical treatments, fake conferences, and sham scientific journals that looked legitimate at a glance, but would publish anything you paid them to, even if you made a joke research paper by cobbling together phrases from an online surrealism generator. Which a couple of frustrated psychology academics did. The paper\u2019s first paragraph contained the line, \u201cNeither cognitive neuropsychiatry nor cognitive neuropsychology is remotely informative when it comes to breaking the ice with buxom grapefruits.\u201d Four journals accepted it for publication.\nThe silliness of it all appealed to Bimler\u2014\u201cIt was, \u2018Ho, ho, here\u2019s some really weird, flaky science for readers to laugh at\u2019\u201d\u2014but it didn\u2019t last. The field of bad science was changing, and a more subtle form of cheating was taking place.\nThis new wave of fraud wasn\u2019t as funny. It took place in complex, niche fields, like non-coding RNA or coordination polymers. From 2013 onwards, sham papers were being mass-produced\u2014there seemed to be factories, called paper mills, producing them on an industrial scale.\nOne way of creating fraudulent scientific papers is to take parts of existing papers, rewrite them using synonyms, and Frankenstein them together. Then, steal an image from another person\u2019s work.\nSome papers are run through software that changes all the words to synonyms, so that they can\u2019t be identified in a plagiarism search. If you\u2019re reading a paper that describes \u201cbreast cancer\u201d as \u201cbosom peril\u201d, says Bimler, then it\u2019s probably a good idea to be suspicious.\nBimler discovered he had a talent for spotting fraudulent images, especially Western blots, which show how proteins in a sample of blood or tissue have been separated and identified. A Western blot looks like a series of monochrome stripes, or, in Bimler\u2019s description, \u201cas if Mondrian hurt his head falling downstairs but continued to paint while experiencing temporal-lobe seizures\u201d. Bimler and other sleuths were constantly finding Western blots that had been copied and pasted from one paper to the next. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like art,\u201d says Bimler. \u201cYou learn to recognise the style of a particular artist. And so, after a while, you start recognising a particular style of Western blot.\u201d\nDo these images matter, in the context of a scientific paper? \u201cIf you haven\u2019t got the right images, you haven\u2019t got the data that your whole experiment is based on.\u201d\nIn 2022, Bimler published an investigation that traced 800 papers about medical applications of crystallography back to one paper mill. His detective work had \u201ccrossed the boundary of being a hobby and become an obsession\u201d, he says.\nBimler is wizardly in both appearance and humour: his critiques usually appear in the form of jokes, or at least extremely colourful insults.\nHe\u2019ll use the word \u201celeemosynary\u201d as though everybody knows what it means, just as he\u2019ll describe a scammer as a \u201cclueless wazzcock\u201d. To him, scientific fraud is \u201cshenanigans\u201d. (\u201cDefinitely, shenanigans had occurred,\u201d he\u2019ll say. Or: \u201cThere was strong evidence of shenanigans.\u201d)\nBimler lives with his partner in Wellington, where he\u2019s a fixture at the local live-music bar. Since his retirement, he\u2019s appeared in both Science and Nature, the world\u2019s pre-eminent journals, as a fraud detection expert. It doesn\u2019t escape his notice that he\u2019s contributing to science by removing papers from the world\u2014as well as by adding his own research to it. (A new paper about colour vision is in the works.)\nBehind the humour, Bimler is terribly serious. Paper mills seem to be targeting biomedical science, especially cancer research, with significant human costs. \u201cThe whole field is becoming contaminated by paper-mill production,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are dying because of fake papers, because these fake results get laundered into clinical advice. That means that legitimate cancer researchers are wasting money trying to extend results that were never true in the first place.\u201d In other words, Bimler\u2019s work\u2014this whole thing\u2014is much more than either a hobby or an obsession."

      "text": "February the fourteenth starts like most other days for Elisabeth Bik: checking her phone in bed, she scrolls through a slew of Twitter notifications and private messages from scientists seeking her detective services. Today\u2019s first request is from a researcher in Belgium: \u201cHi! I know you have a lot of people asking you to use your magic powers to analyse figures, blots and others but I just wanted to ask your opinion\u2026\u201d\nAfter pouring a cup of coffee, Bik sits down at the long, wooden dining table that serves as her workstation at her home in California. She checks her e-mails on a giant 34-inch curved monitor, and takes a closer look at the Belgian message. Attached are images of western blots \u2014 the results of a common test to detect proteins in biological samples \u2014 from a published research paper. The writer wants to know: does Bik see anything fishy in this paper? Have these pictures been digitally altered?\nBik, a microbiologist from the Netherlands who moved to the United States almost two decades ago, is a widely lauded super-spotter of duplicated images in the scientific literature. On a typical day, she\u2019ll scan dozens of biomedical papers by eye, looking for instances in which images are reused and reported as results from different experiments, or where parts of images are cloned, flipped, shifted or rotated to create \u2018new\u2019 data (see \u2018Are you a super-spotter?\u2019).\nHer skill and doggedness have earned her a worldwide following. \u201cShe has an uncommon ability to detect even the most complicated manipulation,\u201d says Enrico Bucci, co-founder of the research-integrity firm Resis in Samone, Italy. Not every issue means a paper is fraudulent or wrong. But some do, which causes deep concern for many researchers. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible problem that we can\u2019t rely on some aspects of the scientific literature,\u201d says Ferric Fang, a microbiologist at the University of Washington, Seattle, who worked on a study with Bik in which she analysed more than 20,000 biomedical papers, finding problematic duplications in roughly 4% of them (E. M. Bik et al. mBio 7, e00809-16; 2016). \u201cYou have postdocs and students wasting months or years chasing things which turn out to not be valid,\u201d he says.\nBik is not the world\u2019s only image sleuth, but she is unique in how publicly she presents her work. Many image checkers work behind the scenes, publishing their findings in research papers and writing privately to journals; a few are hired by journals or institutions. Some who flag up image problems work under pseudonyms, preferring not to be identified. But Bik posts her finds almost every day on Twitter and other online forums, in the process teaching others how to spot duplications and pressuring journals to investigate papers. In so doing, she\u2019s generated an \u201cavalanche of reactions\u201d and awareness about the problem, says Bucci. Bik estimates that her discoveries have led to at least 172 retractions and more than 300 errata and corrections \u2014 but all too often, she says, her warnings seem to be ignored.\nIn April 2019, Bik announced that she had left her paid job at a biomedical start-up firm and would pursue image integrity work full-time, free of charge, for at least a year. A year on, she shows no signs of changing course \u2014 even though she has faced harassment, and at times been overwhelmed with requests. She\u2019s also shared her files with computer scientists trying to develop software to spot duplicated images across millions of papers, although the programs will probably always need human verification. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying it so much that I feel I just want to keep on doing this,\u201d she says.\nHooked by a double smudge\nBik stumbled into image sleuthing around 2013, when, as a staff scientist at Stanford University in California, she read articles about scientific integrity and plagiarism. Out of curiosity, she googled quotes from her own published papers, and quickly found that other authors had lifted text without giving credit. \u201cI was hooked. I was angry,\u201d she says. \u201cI immediately got fascinated about it, like how other people get fascinated by reading about crimes.\u201d At one point, while examining a PhD thesis containing plagiarized text, something even more compelling caught her eye: a western-blot image with a distinctive smudge. The same image appeared in another chapter, supposedly for a different experiment. The chapters had also appeared as research articles, with the same errors, Bik saw. She e-mailed journal editors in January 2014; in June, she anonymously reported the papers online at PubPeer, a website where scientists can discuss published papers. These were Bik\u2019s first reports of suspected manipulation in the literature. After an investigation by Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, the articles were retracted in 2015 and 2016.\nHunting for and cataloguing these images became a hobby. Then Bik contacted Fang and Arturo Casadevall, a microbiologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. The trio decided that Bik\u2019s rare talent could lead to an in-depth inquiry of the frequency of problems in biomedical work. They sampled 20,621 papers, with Bik screening each \u2014 a task Fang says only she could do \u2014 before passing on her finds to Fang and Casadevall for corroboration. \u201cIt\u2019s like a magic trick,\u201d says Fang. \u201cWhen it\u2019s pointed out to you how it works, you can start to see it.\u201d The team found 782 papers with what they termed \u201cinappropriate\u201d duplications, and Bik notified the relevant journals. The team reported the work in 2016 in mBio, at which Casadevall is editor-in-chief.\nProblematic images found in 4% of biomedical papers\nBik spent so much of her spare time on duplicated images that last year she decided to leave her job as director of science at Astarte Medical in Foster City, California. \u201cI realized I was getting more enthusiastic about image duplication work than my real job,\u201d she says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an impressive decision to make,\u201d says Jennifer Byrne, a molecular biologist at the University of Sydney in Australia and herself a data-integrity sleuth who hunts for faulty genetic sequences in published papers. \u201cIt was very brave and, to be honest, pretty selfless.\u201d Bik does not get paid for most of her work, but does some occasional paid consulting, and receives modest sums through a Patreon crowdfunding page. After decades of working and saving, she expects her current situation will be sustainable indefinitely.\nThe duplication database\nBik now operates out of a light-filled dining room, with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking a garden filled with fruit trees and other plants, which she has catalogued in a spreadsheet. She also has a spreadsheet for her collection of nearly 2,000 turtle figurines \u2014 gathered from travels and friends \u2014 which she keeps in a wall of glass cabinets. Most prized of all her spreadsheets, however, is a collection of more than 3,300 questionable papers, most of them flagged because of an issue with their images. (Bik sometimes raises other concerns with papers, such as around plagiarism or conflicts of interest.)\nOn a day without interruptions, Bik can peruse 100 papers or so, adding between 1 and 20 hits to her database (see \u2018Super-spotter test: advanced level\u2019). A repeated smudge here or there, or a familiar smattering of data points: the visual indicators of duplication leap out at Bik from the screen. The collection is large enough to generate its own leads. It was looking at other papers by authors in her mBio data set, for instance, that led Bik last November to a case that generated her widest media coverage so far: a cluster of papers co-authored by Cao Xuetao, a prominent immunologist who has advocated for stronger research integrity in China, and who is the president of Nankai University in Tianjin. (Most of the articles listed Cao\u2019s other affiliation, at the National Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology in Shanghai.) Bik and other pseudonymous commenters flagged apparent issues in more than 60 papers at PubPeer.\nChinese ministry investigates duplications in papers by university president\nChina\u2019s ministry of education said it would investigate the articles, and Cao replied at PubPeer that he would re-examine the manuscripts, and that he was confident that the publications remained valid. Some authors replied swiftly on the site to point to honest errors. In one case, apparent duplicate images were in fact supposed to represent the same experiment but were not clearly labelled as such, an explanation that Bik accepts. In another, authors posted raw data and said the data seemed similar only after being processed for a paper. In still others, authors said there had been accidental mistakes, and by May this year, 13 of the flagged papers had received corrections, most stating that scientific conclusions weren\u2019t affected. (Cao and China\u2019s education ministry didn\u2019t comment further for this article.)\nSometimes, Bik\u2019s finds have pointed to suspected large-scale operations. This year, she and others have flagged a series of more than 400 papers that, they say, contain so many similarities that they could be the product of a \u2018paper mill\u2019 \u2014 a company that produces papers to order. Several image detectives worked to flag and collate the papers, including pseudonymous sleuths @mortenoxe, @TigerBB8 and @SmutClyde, who posted a list of papers in January, on a blog run by science journalist Leonid Schneider. \u201cFinding these fabricated images should not rely solely on the work of unpaid volunteers,\u201d Bik wrote in February on her own blog. Journals say they are now investigating the papers, many of which are authored by doctors in Chinese hospitals, and some retractions are already being prepared.\nBik\u2019s data have revealed some insights into factors that correlate with image duplication. Her mBio paper reported that duplicated images had a slight tendency to occur more frequently in lower-impact journals. The paper also examined a subset of 348 articles flagged in PLoS ONE: taking into account the frequency of publication in the journal, it seemed that papers from China and India were more likely to contain problematic images. But Bik doesn\u2019t target one country\u2019s authors, she says. \u201cI search for problematic papers, regardless of what country they are from,\u201d she wrote in November. In all, Bik has flagged up duplications in papers with lead authors from 49 countries.\nGamified sleuthing\nNearly every day, Bik posts images with suspected problems to Twitter under the hashtag #ImageForensics, challenging her audience \u2014 which has almost tripled in the past year to more than 60,000 followers \u2014 to spot the matches before she posts her answers (see \u2018Super-spotter test: duplications all over\u2019). The puzzles attract numerous guesses within minutes, and some eagle-eyed players spot issues that she misses. (She gives out emoji medals to top performers.) Bik says she hears from some followers who have picked up skills from her and spotted problematic images while peer-reviewing manuscripts. \u201cI feel I\u2019m changing people\u2019s way of looking at these images,\u201d she says. The work is sometimes overwhelming for Bik, who calls herself a \u201csuper introvert\u201d. Last November, she tweeted: \u201cI am getting so many (anonymous) emails with people who want me to check certain authors or papers that I cannot possibly follow up. So many names \u2026 And so much hidden pain among honest scientists about these dishonest coworkers.\u201d\nBik also posts detailed reports on what she sees to PubPeer, and occasionally comments there to support other tipsters. Many PubPeer users post their criticisms under pseudonyms \u2014 as does Bik in some cases, if she feels very worried about litigious authors. But she has posted more than 2,100 comments under her own name at the site since 2014. \u201cWhat distinguishes Elisabeth is her willingness to identify herself, which is extremely admirable. It certainly helps with people taking the allegations seriously,\u201d says Mike Rossner, a former managing editor at the Journal of Cell Biology and president of Image Data Integrity, a consultancy firm in San Francisco, California.\nBeing unemployed and independent gives Bik the freedom to speak her mind, she says. \u201cThis one looks like nobody gave a fork about putting together a good science paper,\u201d she tweeted in March, with an accompanying figure panel that contained multiple duplicated images. Last July, Bik commented on an image: \u201cFor those of you who did not get an NIH R01 grant around 2005, this is where that money was spent on instead.\u201d\nBut there is also risk, especially for someone who refers to herself as \u201cblunt and snarky\u201d on her Twitter biography. \u201cAt some point, I am afraid people will sue me,\u201d she says. She tries to keep her critiques to research papers, rather than accusing their authors. Bik has not faced a lawsuit, but has been harassed and has sometimes taken time off Twitter. One person e-mailed her former colleagues at Stanford arguing that she had abused her research grant funding by pursuing image integrity investigations during work hours. (Bik says this was untrue.) Another posted personal information on PubPeer (now removed). \u201cI\u2019ve been called a bitch a couple of times,\u201d she says. \u201cIt comes with the work I do.\u201d\nBecause she posts under her real name, Bik says she errs on the side of caution, sometimes deciding not to flag cases online, especially those with blurry or low-resolution images. On her own science-integrity blog, many entries begin with some version of the phrase: \u2018This post is not an accusation of misconduct\u2019. Suspicious images don\u2019t always point to corrupt actions, she says: researchers might have mistakenly uploaded a file twice when preparing figures, for instance. Then there are technical artefacts: membrane-thin slices cut sequentially from a piece of tissue can stick together along one edge and flip open butterfly-style, creating an apparent mirrored duplication. Defects on an old microscope can create dark spots that seem the same on every image.\n\u201cShe has a good track record,\u201d says Bernd Pulverer, chief editor of The EMBO Journal, who calls Bik a world leader in manual image screening. \u201cThe things she calls out are usually real issues.\u201d\nPublic or private\nAlthough many praise Bik for her work, some say the concerns shouldn\u2019t be aired in public before they are flagged privately to journals or research institutions. \u201cIt\u2019s very problematic,\u201d says Lauran Qualkenbush, president of the US Association of Research Integrity Officers. She says that, in cases in which foul play is suspected, a public outing might hinder investigative procedures by universities. \u201cIf someone did conduct research misconduct intentionally, and then they\u2019re alerted to the concern, it\u2019s a great opportunity for them to destroy evidence,\u201d she says.\nBik \u2014 in common with other image sleuths \u2014 says she\u2019s tried informing journals privately, but the case often seems to go nowhere or take too long to resolve. (She also notes that researchers have opportunities to destroy evidence even if investigations occur in private.) Between 2014 and 2015, Bik reported all 782 questionable papers from her 2016 mBio study directly to journals through e-mail. Some journals were unprepared for the sheer volume of Bik\u2019s reports. She flagged 348 papers of concern to PLoS ONE in a raft of 30 e-mails, each with 10 or 20 attachments. \u201cThat obviously created a backlog because we were not equipped to deal with it,\u201d says editor-in-chief Joerg Heber. Eventually, in 2018, the journal formed a three-person team dedicated to investigating image integrity and other publication ethics cases full-time. \u201cWe published around 100 retractions last year. Many of these were among cases that had been raised by her,\u201d says Heber. The team is still working through Bik\u2019s original tips, as well as other cases. Bik gives PLoS ONE credit for its efforts, and says she receives regular notifications of PLoS ONE retractions and corrections that have stemmed from her leads. But with many of the nearly 800 cases in the mBio data set still unresolved, Bik\u2019s patience is wearing thin. \u201cI can tell you that 60\u201370% have not been addressed after five years, so now, yes, I\u2019m going to take it more publicly,\u201d she says.\nThe due-diligence process to check concerns with papers often takes much longer than people expect, Pulverer says. He and Heber note that waiting for responses and raw data from authors, and sometimes research institutions, can be time-consuming.\nBik says she realizes that investigations take time. But she argues that journals could use expressions of concern more quickly and frequently to notify other researchers of potential problems, while possibly years-long investigations are pending. Heber says PLoS ONE uses expressions of concern when it has gathered enough information to be concerned, but might hold off if an investigation is running smoothly, in favour of reaching a resolution such as a correction or retraction. Nature\u2019s editor-in-chief, Magdalena Skipper, says that expressions of concern, which alert readers to \u201cserious concerns\u201d with a paper, are \u201ca formal and permanent part of the scientific record; as such, we endeavour to use them judiciously, adding them to papers once we have evidence that it is appropriate to do so\u201d.\nThese days, Bik typically reports her discoveries directly on PubPeer. Some journals and publishers track activity on the site, so she can reach journal editors and the public. \u201cIt\u2019s more important to flag these papers and not worry about what happens behind the scenes with these institutes,\u201d she says.\nResearch ethics: 3 ways to blow the whistle\nMany \u2014 including Bik \u2014 argue that combating image manipulation and duplication requires system-wide changes in science publishing, such as greater pre-screening of accepted manuscripts. \u201cMy preference is not to have to clean up the published literature, but to do it beforehand,\u201d says Rossner. He helped to introduce universal image pre-screening of accepted manuscripts at the Journal of Cell Biology nearly 20 years ago. At the EMBO Press, says Pulverer, journals have pre-screened accepted papers for faulty images since 2013. But most journals still do not pre-screen or (as with Nature) spot-check only a subset of papers before publication. \u201cImage screening is not common right now,\u201d says Chris Graf, director of research integrity at the publisher Wiley.\nBut the tide is slowly turning; Wiley publishes a few journals that screen images, and is \u201cpreparing to launch a screening service\u201d with the Journal of Cellular Biochemistry and the Journal of Cellular Physiology, Graf says. The journal Science has editorial coordinators who check accepted manuscripts for signs of image manipulation, but they don\u2019t have capacity to check for some issues, such as whether figures have been flipped, rotated or duplicated, says executive editor Monica Bradford.\nA job for AI?\nMany researchers say automation is the key to improving image integrity at a large scale. \u201cWe cannot, unfortunately, clone Elisabeth,\u201d says Daniel Acuna, a computer scientist at Syracuse University in New York, whose group is one of a handful working on algorithms to detect problematic images. Although Bik excels at finding duplicated images in a single paper, computers could help to find more duplications between papers by comparing hundreds of thousands or millions of papers \u2014 an unfeasible task for humans, he says. In 2018, Acuna\u2019s team published on the bioRxiv preprint server preliminary results of an analysis that extracted 2 million images from 760,000 papers (D. E. Acuna et al. Preprint at bioRxiv http://doi.org/dtp2; 2018). It proved too computationally intensive to compare every image with every other, but the team looked at image reuse within and across papers by the same authors. After manually examining a sample of more than 3,700 of the matching images that the software flagged, the researchers identified 40 cases that they all agreed were probably fraudulent; almost half of these involved the same image being used to represent different results in different papers.\nCurrent technology is good at detecting outright duplications, and flipped or rotated copies, says Bucci. His company, Resis, uses proprietary software to scan scientific manuscripts for its clients, which include journals and research institutions. But complex problems are tougher, such as two images that share a small overlapping area, but are otherwise completely different. Advances in machine learning could be the key to detecting these and other subtle patterns automatically, he says.\nThe science institutions hiring integrity inspectors to vet their papers\nBut better software will need more data. Machine-learning algorithms require training with an abundance of images that are known to contain duplications. Bik has shared with Acuna images from hundreds of \u2018dirty\u2019 and \u2018clean\u2019 papers from her 2016 study. And at the Humboldt University of Berlin, researchers funded by the publisher Elsevier are developing a searchable database of images from retracted papers. For now, the collection has fewer than 500 entries, and most are in the life sciences and medicine and contributed by Elsevier, so the team wants more publishers to participate. The publisher says that some of its journals are piloting image-checking software, and its goal is to provide all its journals with automated systematic checking.\nUntil recently, Bik was unimpressed by the software available. Now, she says, \u201cI have full confidence that in the next two years, computers will be usable as a mass way of screening manuscripts.\u201d But both Bik and Acuna say that people will always need to check the results of such programs, especially to weed out instances where images can and should look similar in certain parts.\nFor now, Bik has plenty of work to do. This morning\u2019s tip from Belgium looks like it might be a hit. Some of the western-blot bands \u2014 normally fuzzy and rounded like tiny black caterpillars \u2014 sport unusually sharp, pixellated edges, she says; these could be an innocent artefact introduced when a picture is compressed to a smaller size, or could suggest the application of photo-editing tools. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask him for the rest of the paper,\u201d says Bik."

      "text": "Family finally moves into suburban Chicago house after being hampered by seller's code violations\nSara and Todd Hovey had everything was packed \u2014 the papers signed, the money transferred \u2014 and they were all ready to move into their suburban Chicago home until an unexpected hiccup cost them five months and tens of thousands of dollars.\nThe Hoveys have finally moved into the house. But the whole past year for the Hoveys felt like a game they weren't winning.\n\"I would have never imagined that we'd have to weather a storm like this, but I think it shows the strength, you know, of our marriage, really,\" said Sara Hovey.\nFirst, water damage forced the couple from their Chicago condo. Then, they bought the house of their dreams in Morton Grove, but couldn't move in.\nCBS News Chicago detailed their drama in a report back in April.\n\"Everyone I tell this story too is just like, baffled,\" Hovey said at the time.\nThe split-level house had new floors, and a gleaming kitchen with quartz countertops and stainless-steel appliances too. Every detail in the home had been \"meticulously redone,\" according to the real estate listing description.\nBut it turned out that all the renovations were done without permits.\nMorton Grove slapped the seller with code violations after the sale to the Hoveys was completed, which prevented them from getting a deed.\n\"All the funds were disbursed,\" said Hovey. \"So we're just like hanging, holding our breath, living in a mostly packed rental with two kids like, like going through boxes, trying to find thing that we needed for the day.\"\nStress shot through the roof.\n\"There were holes in almost every wall,\" said Todd Hovey.\nConstruction issues became the Hoveys' problem.\n\"When our electricians and building company came in, this was basically all torn apart because all of that needed to be rewired,\" said Todd Hovey as he pointed to a wall.\nMechanical, structural, and plumbing changes were needed too, according to an agreement the Hoveys signed with the Village of Morton Grove.\n\"Over a hundred thousand dollars that we've had to pay for just what the village required us to do,\" said Sara Hovey.\nMorton Grove Village Administrator Chuck Meyer confirmed the Hoveys made the proper repairs to get transfer stamps needed for a deed.\n\"Transfer stamps are a mechanism for us to just make sure that anything outstanding with the property is addressed before it changes owners,\" said Meyer.\nThe key phrase there is \"before it changes owners.\" In the case of the Hoveys, they are still trying to figure out how they caught up as buyers in what is usually a seller's issue.\nWhy do they have to deal with tens of thousands of dollars in repairs and a five-month moving delay?\nTheir next play is taking things to court. Until then, they will try to settle into their new suburb.\n\"All of our neighbors have come out and said hi to us, and, you know: 'Sorry you guys had a rocky start. Welcome to the neighborhood,'\" said Sara Hovey.\nThe lawyer and real estate agent for the seller told CBS News Chicago in April that he would be the one to \"make the house compliant,\" but that was not what happened. Neither the seller nor his representatives would comment on this story.\nThe Hoveys said they also feel misled by Advocus Title Insurance Company, which completed their transaction. That company denies all wrongdoing, and issued this statement:\n\"To be clear, Advocus's role as a title insurer is limited to title insurance and settlement services. We are not responsible for the condition of the property, inspections, permits, or\u2014most relevant to this dispute\u2014transfer stamps. These matters fall outside the scope of insuring title. Portraying the title insurer as responsible because the buyer cannot move into the property due to building permit, transfer stamps, and occupancy issues is unfair and inaccurate.\n\"Real estate transactions involve multiple agreements, each assigning distinct responsibilities. Buyers and sellers are bound by the real estate contract, while title companies like Advocus operate under the terms and conditions of the title policy. Our involvement begins only after the real estate contract is executed between the buyer and seller, and we have no say over its terms.\n\"For this transaction, the standard 8.0 Multi-Board Residential Real Estate Contract was used. We encourage CBS to review Sections 19(a), 24(a), and 24(h), which directly address responsibilities related to transfer taxes, uncorrected building code issues, final permit issues, and the obligations of the buyer and seller-key issues raised in this matter.\n\"Regarding transfer stamps, responsibility for obtaining them rests solely with the buyer and seller. Both parties, represented by experienced real estate attorneys, instructed Advocus to proceed with closing despite the stamps being unavailable.\n\"While we sympathize with the buyers' concerns, this situation arose from a potential breakdown of communication and/or contractual obligations between buyer and seller. Some issues fall outside the scope of title insurance and are not the responsibility of the title company.\n\"Where issues did fall within the scope of the title insurance policy, Advocus met all obligations: We received the transfer stamps on May 23, 2025, and recorded the deed on the same day, thereby ensuring the protection of the buyers' ownership interest in the property. To be clear, any unresolved permit, occupancy and construction issues have nothing to do with title matters.\""

      "text": "Massive party may have been linked to 4 shootings on Chicago's West Side over weekend\nMany questions remained Monday about a slew of shootings in Chicago's South Austin neighborhood over the weekend.\nCBS News Chicago has learned it is believed that the shootings were connected to a massive party with hundreds of people in the street.\nTwo people lost their lives, and at least 11 others were wounded, across four separate shootings.\nA witness who lives on the block said there is an older community that lives on Maypole Avenue near the scene of the party and the shootings, and never in her many years there has she seen a crowd so big as the one Saturday night into Sunday morning.\nThe witness did not want to speak on camera, but said the 18-year-old boy who was killed in one of the shootings, Kaleb Williams, died in front of her door.\nRing camera video next door to where Williams was shot showed a huge police presence. A few women seemed to take cover on a stoop in the video.\nNeighbors said the sounds woke them up \u2014 young people in the street, and then gunshots.\nThe first shots were fired in the 200 block of North Lamon Avenue in the wee hours Sunday. Police said this shooting happened at 1:40 a.m., though social media video documented it earlier.\nChicago police said officers responded to a person shot and found the victim, a 20-year-old woman, with multiple gunshot wounds to her arms. She was taken to Mt. Sinai Hospital, where she was listed in good condition.\nAt 1:47 a.m., four people were shot in the 4500 block of West Wilcox Street \u2014 a few blocks to the south and east, and technically in the adjoining West Garfield Park neighborhood, being east of Cicero Avenue.\nIn the Wilcox Street shooting, two men were taken to Mt. Sinai Hospital. A 28-year-old man suffered a graze wound to the leg and was in good condition. Another 28-year-old man was hit in the head and grazed in the neck and was in serious condition.\nThe two teens were taken to Stroger Hospital of Cook County. A 15-year-old boy was hit multiple times in the body and was in good condition. A 16-year-old was also hit multiple times in the body and was in serious condition.\nAt 2:48 a.m., police said six people were shot around West End and La Crosse avenues. A 22-year-old woman was killed and five others were wounded \u2014 a 29-year-old woman, and four boys and men ages 17 to 29.\nThree of the male victims were reported in critical condition.\nAt 4:37 a.m., another shooting transpired \u2014 this one on Maypole Avenue near Lavergne Avenue. Police said there was a quarrel with two people in a car, and the people in the car opened fire.\nWilliams was hit twice in the back and was taken to Stroger Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. The other 18-year-old was hit in the arm and was taken to Mt. Sinai, initially listed in good condition.\nIn all, there were four crime scenes and over a dozen victims. Police were overwhelmed.\n\"A huge area,\" said former Chicago police Supt. Anthony Riccio. \"It's very manpower intensive, and it could tie up officers for hours.\"\nRiccio said it appears the four scenes were all related to the unauthorized party, which was advertised on social media.\n\"It's also possible the officers knew about it, but didn't expect the scope of it; didn't expect it to be 800 or 1,000 people,\" Riccio said.\nRiccio explained how difficult it is for police to handle such a large scene \u2014 a reason why reinforcements sometimes have to be called in from other nearby districts and departments. In the case of the party in the South Austin neighborhood over the weekend, Chicago police officers were called in from O'Hare International Airport, the Northwest Side, and downtown.\n\"It's not uncommon to call in assistance, sometimes from other districts in the city, but it's not uncommon to call in suburban departments for help as well,\" said Riccio.\nRiccio said police are now hoping that someone \u2014 anyone within that large crowd \u2014 will come forward with information to help them solve the two murders.\nAs of late Monday, only one person had been taken into custody on accusations of throwing a brick at a Chicago police vehicle. No one else has been arrested."
