      "feedback": "The base-case anchor is solid (AI/cloud productivity, backlog ~$368B, cloud CAGR 19–23% 2024–2030) but the piece lacks a crisp, first-principles causal chain from backlog to earnings visibility to long-duration multiples and understates cross‑asset transmission; to lift to world-class, rewrite as: (1) build a tight AB-model causal chain that moves from AI-capex/backlog to revenue/FCF growth and margin, then to valuation via the 12–18% justness premium and the 1.8–2.2% dividend yield, anchoring every link to 0G3A676BP, 4LQD15CFU and TN66GHPAT; (2) define horizons clearly (Near-term 0–12m, Medium 1–2y, Long >2y) with explicit triggers and invalidation points (e.g., backlog trajectory QoQ, IBM hiring trends, AI-productivity milestones, dividend prints, policy-rate moves) and map how each would reprice risk assets; (3) impose a three-scenario framework (base, accelerant with AI-capex upside, and policy-tightening) with explicit quantitative sensitivities tied to the cited ranges; (4) spell out a concise cross-asset transmission map: AI-driven capex boosts equities via exposure to platform leaders, policy/inflation dynamics shift discount rates affecting long-duration multiples, and EURUSD regimes interact with risk premia (cite 5S9GJV2O3; UVEQ2SJ0W; HWGNUP2XG); (5) embed precise numbers so claims aren’t generic (retire abstract phrases; keep 368B, 19–23%, 1.8–2.2%, 12–18% as anchor values) and add explicit inflection points that would cause multiples to re-rate; (6) tighten citation hygiene by eliminating placeholders like Ja/9TBD?, ensuring every assertion has a source, and reconciling any potential conflicts between backlog strength and tightening capital/risk premia; (7) deliver as a tight executive brief with a three-part structure (base-case anchor, cross-topic transmission, watch-list with decisive signals and timeframes) to satisfy the horizon/style constraint. Citations should stay attached to the relevant claims (0G3A676BP; 4LQD15CFU; TN66GHPAT; 5S9GJV2O3; UVEQ2SJ0W; HWGNUP2XG).",
