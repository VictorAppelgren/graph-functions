  "content": "\u2022 AI chip repair firms in China are thriving due to heavy demand surge\n\u2022 Chinese shops simulate data centers and fix hundreds of chips monthly at scale\n\nA quiet but growing business has emerged in China that focuses on repairing Nvidia\u2019s advanced AI chips, despite strict US export controls.\n\nReports from Reuters found around a dozen small firms, mainly based in Shenzhen, claiming they service large numbers of Nvidia\u2019s H100 and A100 GPUs, even though these chips were officially banned from sale to China in 2022.\n\nOne company told the news agency it repairs up to 500 Nvidia AI chips every month - and with roughly 12 similar firms operating year-round, that could amount to tens of thousands of chips annually.\n\nMany of these units are worn down from heavy use, especially as some have run around the clock for years in AI training workloads.\n\n\u201cThere is really significant repair demand,\u201d Reuters was told by the co-owner of a Shenzhen firm that moved into AI hardware in late 2024.\n\nThat demand led to the creation of a second company purely to handle AI chip repair.\n\nTheir facility includes a server room that can simulate data center conditions with up to 256 servers.\n\nAnother shop that shifted from GPU rentals to repairs told Reuters it fixes around 200 chips per month, typically charging about 10% of the original purchase price.\n\nNvidia cannot legally support or replace restricted GPUs within China. An Nvidia spokesperson said only the company and approved partners are authorized to offer the necessary service and support, adding that running restricted chips without full infrastructure is not viable long-term.\n\nThe potentially high failure rate raises concerns about what will happen to tens of thousands of aging A100s and earlier GPUs once they fail.\n\nThe existence of such a repair sector is down to the widespread smuggling of banned chips into China, something we\u2019ve reported on previously.\n\nWhile Nvidia recently began offering the H20 GPU in China to comply with export restrictions, many customers there still prefer the banned H100 for training LLMs.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 Two million people watched this video of a mini PC being built from a slab of aluminum\n\u2022 China has spent billions of dollars building far too many data centers for AI\n\u2022 Microsoft to stop using China-based engineers for US military tech support",

  "summary": "A growing business in China, mainly based in Shenzhen, is thriving due to a surge in demand for AI chip repair services. Around a dozen small firms, mostly of which repair large numbers of Nvidia\u2019s H100 and A100 GPUs, which are officially banned from sale to China in 2022. One company reportedly repairs up to 500 Nvidia AI chips per month, potentially amounting to tens of thousands of chips annually. This demand led to the creation of a second company solely to handle AI chip repairs. Despite legal options, many in China still prefer banned GPUs for AI workloads and pay for repairs. The existence of this sector is due to the smuggling of banned chips into China, which Nvidia has previously reported is widespread.",

Robotic arms extract GPU modules, pick-and-place systems reassemble them onto redesigned boards, and automated soldering equipment finalizes the electrical work, before visual inspection systems confirm alignment and build quality.\nThe process is fast, repeatable, and efficient, far beyond what might be expected of a small workshop, but what makes this enterprise even more notable is the sheer volume of RTX 5090 cards seen in the video, despite restrictions on their export to China.\nNvidia has not officially released the 5090D variant, designed to comply with U.S. sanctions, and yet shelves of full-power RTX 5090 units can be seen undergoing retrofitting.\nGaming models with three-fan cooling are too large for server chassis, and their power connectors are often positioned awkwardly for rack use, so the cards are physically modified to fit data center constraints.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nThe redesigned blower cards shift the power input to the tail end of the PCB, simplifying cable routing and avoiding risk of overheating.\nFrom a hardware standpoint, the GPUs function identically.\nBy shifting them onto slimline, server-compatible boards, Chinese firms are essentially creating their own high-end AI accelerators.\nIf hardware intended for gamers can be so easily adapted for AI research and model training, then questions about the effectiveness of the current export controls surely have to be asked.\nIt\u2019s clear from the scale of the operation in the video that there is strong demand for AI accelerators built from repurposed RTX 5090 cards.\nFor AI developers in China, it means they can get the computing power they need without having to rely on official supply channels.\nVia Guru3D.com\nYou might also like\nWayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

We\u2019ve reviewed models like the SER8, SER9, Beelink ME mini, and GTR7 and always come away impressed. The company's most recent release, the GTR9 Pro, is powered by a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 processor and delivers 126 TOPS for next-gen AI.\nThe video, from SatisFactory Process, has so far been watched by nearly two million viewers, and for good reason. The 22-minute showcase explores how Beelink\u2019s mini PCs are made from start to finish, and it's mesmerizing.\nIt begins with raw aluminum being pressed and CNC-machined into a case. From there, you see the entire transformation: polishing, chemical cleaning, abrasive blasting, electroplating, laser engraving, and dozens of small, meticulous assembly steps.\nOne of the most striking things is just how much of the work is done by hand.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nFrom installing components on the motherboard to applying thermal pads and screwing together daughterboards, human workers are visible at almost every stage.\nThere are multiple quality control checks throughout, including electrical testing, visual inspections, firmware flashing, and more.\nThe build is topped off with packaging, accessories, plastic wrapping, and factory seals before heading out the door.\nPart of what makes the video so watchable - and that 22 minutes absolutely flies by - is that it\u2019s not flashy or promotional. There\u2019s no voiceover, no music. Just the sound of real machines and real people building something.\nMany of the comments under the video echo the same feeling: surprise at the number of steps involved, appreciation for the amount of human care, and admiration for a company willing to show the entire process.\nAs one commenter observed, \u201cThis is the best advertisement a company can do\u201d - and it really is.\nWatch and enjoy the video below.\nYou might also like\n- These are the best business laptops around\n- And these are the best workstations available today\n- Compact workstation PC appears with some outstanding features\nWayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

      "text": "China has spent billions of dollars building far too many data centers for AI and compute - could it lead to a huge market crash?\n80% of the country's new data center capacity is unused, reports say\n- DeepSeek is just one of the many reasons China's AI growth simply didn't materialize\n- Up to 80% of new data center capacity hasn't been used according to local sources\n- Should this capacity hit the wider market, it could cause a major headache to data center developers\nChina\u2019s AI infrastructure boom is faltering, as according to a report in MIT Technology Review, the country built hundreds of data centers to support its AI ambitions, but many are now sitting unused.\nBillions were invested by both state and private entities in 2023 and 2024, with the expectation that demand for GPU rentals would keep growing, but uptake has in fact dropped off, and as a result many operators are now struggling to survive.\nMuch of the early momentum was driven by hype. The government, keen for China to become a global leader in AI, encouraged local officials to fast-track data center construction with the result that more than 500 projects were announced nationwide, and at least 150 were completed by the end of 2024, according to state-affiliated sources. However, MIT Technology Review says local publications are reporting that up to 80% of this new computing capacity remains idle.\nSelling off GPUs\nLocation is also a problem, MIT Technology Review notes. Facilities built in central and western China, where electricity is cheap, now face issues meeting latency requirements. In cities like Zhengzhou, operators are reportedly even giving away free compute vouchers in an attempt to lure users.\nIn some regions, developers began selling off GPUs after failing to secure long-term clients.\nXiao Li, a data center project manager who spoke with MIT Technology Review, said many WeChat groups that once boasted about Nvidia chip deals have gone quiet. \u201cIt seems like everyone is selling, but few are buying,\u201d he noted.\nShould this capacity hit the wider market, it could cause a major headache to data center developers, flooding an already soft sector with even more supply and pushing prices down further.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nOne reason for the drop in demand is the rise of DeepSeek, which upended the global tech economy when it launched in January 2025.\nIts open source reasoning model, R1, matches the performance of ChatGPT o1 but at a lower cost, shifting interest away from model training and toward inference - the real-time use of AI models, which requires different infrastructure.\nMany of the data centers built during the rush were designed for large-scale training, not the low-latency demands of real-time reasoning.\nDespite the oversupply, the Chinese government reportedly remains committed. Central authorities held an AI symposium in early 2025, and firms like Alibaba and TikTok owner ByteDance have announced major investments.\nFor many early data center investors however, expectations have collapsed. The infrastructure was built, but the demand it was meant to supply simply hasn\u2019t arrived.\nYou might also like\nWayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

      "text": "Report claims Nvidia will sell a special version of its most powerful GPU to China to comply with US export restrictions, but that won't be enough\nCheaper, weaker GPUs might be China\u2019s golden ticket to massive AI infrastructure growth\n- A watered-down Nvidia RTX Pro 6000 is still potent enough to keep China\u2019s AI ambitions alive\n- Nvidia\u2019s workaround isn\u2019t top-tier, but it could still flood China\u2019s data centers\n- Export rules slow performance, but they can\u2019t stop parallelized AI scaling by Chinese CSPs\nIn response to US export restrictions introduced in April 2025, Nvidia is reportedly preparing a special edition of its RTX Pro 6000 GPU for the Chinese market.\nA report from TrendForce claims this new version will switch from high-bandwidth memory (HBM) to the slower but more accessible GDDR7.\nThe switch will allow the chip to comply with new regulations that prohibit GPUs with HBM-level memory bandwidth or advanced interconnect capabilities, resulting in a scaled-down GPU, but not one lacking power.\nNot the best, but enough for decent AI work\nThe RTX Pro 6000 is a potent chip. Even after being watered down, TrendForce estimates its performance will fall between Nvidia\u2019s older L40S and the L20 China edition. This places the chip well within the range of GPUs capable of meaningful AI workloads.\nWhat\u2019s driving interest is not just availability, but capability, even with the downgrade. Critics have pointed out that a cut-down version of a very powerful card is still extremely capable, especially if it's priced more affordably.\nAs a result, Chinese cloud service providers (CSPs) are expected to scale horizontally, buying more units and optimizing for larger node deployments.\nYes, this approach will be more expensive and consume more power, but that\u2019s just a numbers game - CSPs will need to increase infrastructure investment and manage higher power demands. The downside, of course, is that such workarounds are inherently inefficient.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nNonetheless, if the price per unit is right, the aggregate performance could still meet, or even exceed, current needs.\nIt may not be the fastest setup in traditional terms, but in parallelized environments, the performance gap could narrow. That said, Chinese chipmakers like Huawei and Cambricon are working to fill the gap left by restricted access to top-tier Nvidia GPUs.\nIf the special edition RTX Pro 6000 succeeds, it might delay the domestic adoption of homegrown alternatives. If it fails, it could accelerate them.\nNvidia\u2019s strategy may help it navigate current U.S. restrictions, but it remains an open question whether that will be enough in the long run.\nA weaker chip could still be one of the fastest GPUs on the market, and too powerful to ignore, especially when the line between compliance and capability is so finely drawn.\nYou might also like\n- These are the best AMD graphics cards on the market right now\n- Take a look at the best mini PCs you can buy today\n- Quantum computing startup wants to launch a 1000-qubit machine by 2031\nEfosa has been writing about technology for over 7 years, initially driven by curiosity but now fueled by a strong passion for the field.

      "text": "No AI GPU, no problem: AI firms from China skirt around US chip restrictions by moving petabytes of data on good ol' hard drives - but why not use tape?\nChina is shipping AI training data on hard drives like it's 1999\n- Flying petabytes of AI data is China\u2019s latest workaround for strict U.S. chip controls\n- Physically smuggling hard drives now bypasses surveillance and digital firewalls across multiple jurisdictions\n- GPU-rich Malaysian data centers are becoming ground zero for offshore Chinese AI training\nAs the United States continues to tighten export restrictions on advanced AI chips, such as those produced by Nvidia, Chinese AI companies are turning to a workaround that feels almost analog in today\u2019s digital world.\nRather than relying on online transfers or sanctioned hardware, some firms are physically transporting vast datasets on hard drives across borders.\nA report from the Wall Street Journal claims four Chinese tech workers recently flew into Malaysia, each carrying 15 high-capacity hard drives, totaling an astonishing 4.8 petabytes of data, intended for training large language models.\nBig data continues to enter China despite restrictions\nUS restrictions have made it increasingly difficult to acquire high-end AI GPUs through legal channels.\nAlthough Nvidia maintains, \u201cthere is no evidence of chip diversion,\u201d on-the-ground reports suggest otherwise, with a black market for smuggled Nvidia GPUs thriving in China.\nSome of these chips are reportedly entering the country through subsidiaries and partners in neighboring nations.\nHowever, that route is becoming more expensive and riskier due to heightened scrutiny and diplomatic pressure from Washington on these intermediary countries.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nAs a result, companies are shifting tactics: rather than importing restricted chips, they are exporting massive volumes of training data.\nThis is a complex and resource-intensive process. Companies carefully plan the physical transportation of data, distributing drives to avoid detection by customs.\nThey also rent GPU-rich servers in third-party countries such as Malaysia to process the data.\nOne example involves a Chinese firm that used its Singapore-registered subsidiary to sign a data center contract. However, the Malaysian partner later insisted on local registration to avoid regulatory pressure, as Singapore began tightening its own controls.\nDespite increasing efforts by US agencies, enforcement gaps and logistical loopholes continue to be exploited. While shipping petabytes of data on hard drives may seem outdated, it sidesteps bandwidth limitations and digital surveillance.\nThe use of hard drives, ranging from large SSDs arrays to high-capacity external HDDs, is central to these covert transfers.\nStill, it raises a question: why not use magnetic tape, especially given that modern LTO-10 formats can store up to 30TB uncompressed and 75TB compressed?\nThe answer likely lies in practicality. Tape solutions require specialized read/write hardware and lack the plug-and-play convenience of high-end HDDs commonly used today.\nYou might also like\n- Here are the best mobile workstations around today\n- We've rounded up the best external hard drives available now\n- Experts warn clicking \"unsubscribe\" on that boring email could actually be a security risk\nEfosa has been writing about technology for over 7 years, initially driven by curiosity but now fueled by a strong passion for the field.

      "text": "The blackmarket for Nvidia H100, A100 AI GPUs is exploding \u2014 US-imposed export sanctions cause Chinese buyers to come up with imaginative techniques to get their hands on precious cargo\n\"There is always a way\" smugglers say\nIn October 2022, the Biden Administration announced that it would impose restrictions on the sale of new semiconductors to China, aiming to slow the progress of the Chinese tech sector.\nThis has meant firms like Huawei have had to become increasingly creative to get around the restrictions, but it\u2019s not easy.\nThe US blocked the importation of advanced Nvidia GPUs to China to tighten control over critical AI technology and this has inadvertently ignited a thriving underground market there. Chinese buyers, undeterred by the sanctions, are employing remarkably ingenious tactics to smuggle in high-end Nvidia GPUs like the H100 and A100.\nThere is always a way\nThe Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reports some travelers are now hiding advanced Nvidia chips in their luggage. The outlet reviewed records, including customs filings, that showed Nvidia chips were being purchased by Chinese buyers in an underground market.\nOne Beijing distributor told WSJ reporters that he receives dozens of chips monthly, claiming \"there is always a way\" to get them into China. Another broker, acting as an intermediary, described using personal contacts at official distribution channels and system integrators in Southeast Asia to source the chips, omitting the model numbers on paperwork to evade detection.\nIn April 2024, Reuters reported Chinese universities and research institutes, including the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Shandong Artificial Intelligence Institute, were able to acquire Nvidia chips through resellers.\nWhile tighter regulations under the Advanced Computing Chips Rule aim to curb this flow, the blackmarket continues to thrive and adapt. As the tech arms race intensifies, both sides are employing increasingly sophisticated measures to outmaneuver each other in this high-stakes game of technological cat and mouse.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nMore from TechRadar Pro\nWayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

  "argos_summary": "In China, a burgeoning industry has emerged focused on repairing Nvidia's advanced AI chips, particularly the H100 and A100 models, despite U.S. export restrictions that prohibit their sale. Small firms, primarily in Shenzhen, are reportedly repairing hundreds of these chips monthly, driven by high demand from AI workloads. Additionally, Chinese companies are creatively circumventing export controls by smuggling GPUs and repurposing gaming graphics cards into AI accelerators, highlighting the ongoing challenges and adaptations within the tech landscape amid strict regulations.",
