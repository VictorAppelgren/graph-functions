  "description": "Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser traveled to Martha's Vineyard for a family commitment after President Donald Trump federalized the city's police.",
  "content": "Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser is out of town Thursday after traveling to Martha's Vineyard for a family matter, Fox News has learned.\n\nThe Democrat was not in the District Thursday, and a source confirmed she traveled north to the Massachusetts island vacation hot spot.\n\nThe mayor was traveling for a \"family commitment,\" according to her office. She's expected back in the city Friday.\n\n\"The mayor has a family commitment and had to pick up her daughter,\" the mayor's office said when asked about her trip to Martha's Vineyard. \"She will return to the District tomorrow.\"\n\nBowser made the trip to the Massachusetts island after President Donald Trump federalized the city's police department Monday after a spate of high-profile crimes.\n\nTrump announced Monday morning during a packed press conference that he was federalizing the Metropolitan Police Department under the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, which allows the president to assume emergency control of the capital's police force for 30 days.\n\n\u2018RADICAL\u2019 DC OFFICIALS TREATED OFFICERS \u2018LIKE CRAP,\u2019 POLICE LEADER SAYS \u2013 7 ATTACKS THAT LED TO TRUMP TAKEOVER\n\n\"Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people,\" Trump said. \"And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.\"\n\nHundreds of National Guard troops have since converged on the nation's capital, and the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Capitol Police and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are assisting with Trump's law and order crackdown and sweeps of the city.\n\nSince the 2020 crime wave, the nation's capital has been rocked by shootings that have left innocent children dead, a trend of juveniles committing carjackings that have turned deadly in some cases; and shoplifting crimes and attacks on government employees, summer interns and others, including the fatal shooting of 21-year-old congressional intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym in June.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers and local leaders have slammed Trump over the move, arguing crime has fallen in recent years after the wildly violent crime trends of 2020 that rocked cities nationwide.\n\nThough crimes have trended downward in recent years after the heavy crime of 2020, the lethality of crimes in D.C. has spiked dramatically, meaning the chances of being victimized in the city have dropped, but the chances of dying as a victim of violent crime have increased.\n\nThe Council on Criminal Justice published a study in July examining violent crime data from 17 large U.S. cities between 2018 and 2024, specifically diving into the lethality of violent crimes in those cities. It found Washington, D.C., had the highest lethality level of the group, which included cities such as Baltimore and Chicago, at a 38% increase in lethality in 2024 compared with 2018.\n\nLethality in D.C. jumped 341% when compared to 2012 data, the study found, reporting there were 13 homicides per 1,000 serious violent crimes in 2012 and 57 homicides per 1,000 serious violent crimes in 2024.\n\nBowser slammed the federalization of the city during a townhall meeting Tuesday.\n\n\"This is a time where community needs to jump in,\" Bowser said during the meeting community leaders, which was . \"We all need to, to do what we can in our space, in our lane, to protect our city and to protect our autonomy, to protect our home rule and get to the other side of this guy and make sure we elect a so that we have a backstop to this authoritarian push.\"\n\nShe called Trump's effort \"an intrusion on our autonomy.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhen Trump first federalized the city, Bowser called the move \"unprecedented\" but added that she wasn't \"totally surprised.\"",

      "text": "Washington, D.C.'s mayor struck a dramatically different tune Tuesday regarding President Donald Trump's federalization of the city's police force, diverging from her original response to the matter.\n\"This is a time where community needs to jump in. We all need to, to do what we can in our space, in our lane, to protect our city and to protect our autonomy, to protect our home rule, and get to the other side of this guy, and make sure we elect a Democratic House so that we have a backstop to this authoritarian push,\" Bowser said during town hall with community leaders, which was livestreamed on X.\nShe called Trump's effort \"an intrusion on our autonomy.\"\nMonday, the mayor's comments were significantly less inflammatory, when she simply called the move \"unprecedented\" but said she wasn't \"totally surprised.\"\nDuring the meeting, she also pleaded with parents to be aware of what their children are doing, and suggested that mobs of juveniles committing crimes are not actually criminals.\n\"You've heard me talking about youth a lot in the last several months, especially youth who are participating in really destructive, disruptive behavior with these kind of youth takeovers,\" Boswer said. \"Some of them are our kids. Some of them are coming across the region to descend on places like the Navy Yard. So parents \u2014 this is not the first time you've heard me say this \u2014 so parents, you really need to know where your kids are.

In just the few days since President Trump has gotten involved, over 100 dangerous criminals have been removed from the streets along with illegal weapons and drugs. Where Democrat leaders failed, President Trump will succeed \u2014 DC will be safe and clean again thanks to bold actions from President Trump.\"\nWhen asked for further clarification about Bowser's Tuesday comments, the mayor's press secretary, Daniel Gleick, directed Fox News Digital to crime statistics Bowser mentioned during the same town hall that the White House disputed.\n\"MPD has been doing the job with community and all of their partners in government to drive down violent crime in the District of Columbia,\" Bowser said. \"We have, in fact, experienced a 26% decrease, and that's on top of the 35% decrease we saw in violent crime last year. Having said that, we never take our foot off the gas, and we're never satisfied with any level of crime.\"\nBut those statistics, as the White House noted, may have been manipulated by a D.C. police commander, who is on administrative leave pending an investigation into the matter.\nGleick responded to that report by pointing to comments Bowser made in a separate interview with NBC4 Tuesday.\nTRUMP TAKES CONTROL OF METRO POLICE, DEPLOYS NATIONAL GUARD TO TAKE ON WASHINGTON CRIME\nBowser said, \"The chief of police had concerns about one commander, investigated all seven districts and verified that the concern was with one person. So, we are completing that investigation, and we don't believe it implicates many cases.\"\nAccording to the NBC4 report, Bowser said MPD leadership only found crime statistics reporting anomalies in one of Washington's seven police districts.\nJuvenile crime has been a point of emphasis amid the Trump administration's federalization move.\nOn the night of May 17, a mob of about 100 teenagers terrorized the Navy Yard neighborhood a block from Nationals Park.\nIt was the second such teen takeover in less than a month.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAt about 8 p.m., police began receiving calls about disorderly conduct, but the situation quickly turned violent. One group of teens beat two bystanders, punching them, knocking them to the ground and then stomping on them, according to WUSA9.\nThere was at least one other similar incident that night.\nFox News Digital reached out to the DOJ for comment.\nEditor's note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly attributed a quote.

      "text": "President Donald Trump on Monday moved to federalize policing in the nation's capital, following years of unchecked violent crime in Washington, D.C.\nThe polarizing move has caused an uproar from opponents, and celebrations from supporters who want to see an end to violence in the city. The move comes after Washington has garnered national attention with a string of high-profile incidents in recent months and years that precipitated Trump's move.\nHowever, not everyone agrees with Trump's new plan.\nFox News contributor and former D.C. homicide detective Ted Williams is among those who oppose the federal intervention. \"While the president may mean well, this is going nowhere fast,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"D.C. is not a war zone. The lawsuits for constitutional violations are coming. This is overkill.\"\nHe also said criminals will just wait out the federalization, and return when National Guard troops are pulled from the streets.\n\"Jo Jo and his boys are going on vacation and will return after this crazy experiment ends.\"\nNational Fraternal Order of Police President Joe Gamaldi likes Trump's plan.\n\"Their average homicide rate has doubled in the last 10 years. They used to average less than 100 homicides. Now they average over 200,\" Gamaldi said, a claim which is backed up by the city's own data.\n\"And it's because you have a radical element on that city council that has defunded their police. They have embraced revolving door criminal justice policies. And frankly, they treated the hardworking men and women of law enforcement in that town like crap. So, of course, they need help. You have to do something, otherwise it's going to get out of control.\"\nBelow is a list of some of the most notorious crimes the city has seen.\n1. Ex-DOGE staffer beaten by teens in attempted carjacking\nIn the early morning hours of Aug. 3, an ex-Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer was beaten during an attempted carjacking in the city's Logan Circle neighborhood.\nEdward Coristine, known as \"Big Balls,\" was confronted by a group of teens while out with his significant other. Police said he pushed the woman into his vehicle to protect her and bore the brunt of the wrath of the criminals.\nTRUMP IS THREATENING TO 'FEDERALIZE' DC WITH NATIONAL GUARD AND MORE. HERE'S HOW THAT COULD PLAY OUT\nNearby patrol officers intervened, and the attackers escaped on foot, but not before Coristine was left bloodied.\nA 15-year-old male and a 15-year-old female have been arrested in connection with the crime. They face charges of unarmed carjacking.\n2. Congressional intern shot dead\nEric Tarpinian-Jachym, 21, was shot June 30 on the 1200 block of 7th Street, Northwest. He died a day later. He was a student at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst and was interning for Rep. Ron Estes, R-Kan.\nSeveral people exited a vehicle and began firing shots. The Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) said Tarpinian-Jachym was not the target of the shooting.\nA 16-year-old male and an adult female were shot, but both survived. The FBI is assisting MPD in the case's investigation. No suspects have been captured.\n3. Two Israeli Embassy staffers shot and killed\nOn May 21, two Israeli Embassy staffers were shot and killed while leaving an event at the Capital Jewish Museum.\nThe victims were Yaron Lischinsky, an Israeli, and Sarah Milgrim, an American.\nElias Rodriguez, 31, of Chicago was captured immediately. He has been charged not only with the murders, but with federal hate crimes. He allegedly shouted \"Free, free Palestine!\" while in custody.\nTRUMP TO HOLD NEWS CONFERENCE ON DC CRIME AFTER FEDERAL AGENTS HIT STREETS\n4. Roving teen mob wreaks havoc in Navy Yard neighborhood\nOn the night of May 17, a mob of about 100 teenagers terrorized the Navy Yard neighborhood a block from Nationals Park.\nIt was the second such teen takeover in less than a month.\nAt about 8 p.m., police began receiving calls about disorderly conduct, but the situation quickly turned violent.
