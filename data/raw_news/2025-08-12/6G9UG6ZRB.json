  "content": "While structured data (e.g., ledgers, KPIs) integrates easily into finance systems, semi-structured data (e.g., invoices, PDFs) requires extra processing through OCR, NLP or RPA to become actionable.\n\n\u201cData is the new oil\u201d is a long-overused clich\u00e9. But like oil, data can be refined and structured. Like clich\u00e9s, data can always be applied in relevant contexts.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nAnd quality data, which has always helped grease the wheels of commerce, is now helping finance teams and chief financial officers (CFOs) build real-time back-office systems that can move at the speed of business.\n\nThe catalyst is not just a greater volume of data, but cleaner, standardized, and more context-rich information delivered in real time. This improved data structure and delivery velocity is helping reframe the CFO\u2019s role from scorekeeper to strategist, enabling them to activate insights derived from better-structured data across payments, supply-chains and procurement.\n\nFor example, better-structured supply-chain data means that figures are standardized across vendors, integrated with financial systems, and enriched with metadata that adds strategic context.\n\nInstead of reconciling disparate spreadsheets from procurement, logistics and warehouse teams, CFOs can now operate from a unified dashboard that links shipment statuses directly to working-capital projections. Standardized frameworks like the Supply Chain Operations Reference Model and ISO-compliant reporting make supplier comparisons straightforward.\n\nRead more: Why CFO Now Stands for \u2018Chief Forecasting Officer\u2019\n\nThe modern CFO is now likely to be involved in vendor selection, production scheduling, and even logistics routing decisions. Against this backdrop, as well as the ongoing tariff-driven uncertainty, historical analytics can deliver only so much.\n\nWhat CFOs increasingly want and need is forward-looking clarity. High-quality, granular data can help forecast supply chain disruptions and optimize working-capital deployment.\n\n\u201c[Accounts receivable (AR)] is no longer about settling the past. It\u2019s about predicting the future of cash,\u201d Pamela Novoa Ralli, head of product management at FIS, told PYMNTS in an interview published Tuesday (Aug. 5). \u201cIt\u2019s moving from a responsive to a proactive view.\u201d\n\nPYMNTS Intelligence in the June CAIO Report, \u201cThe Enterprise Reset: Tariffs, Uncertainty and the Limits of Operational Response,\u201d found that 60% of firms reported that they are addressing today\u2019s tariff-induced challenges through tighter partner coordination, smarter sourcing contract terms, more dynamic price modeling and greater alignment between finance and procurement function. These are all areas where structured or semi-structured data can play a key role in giving CFOs a multi-dimensional view of every operational dollar.\n\nThe challenges, however, are not insignificant. Many companies still operate on legacy ERP systems that are difficult to integrate with modern analytics platforms. Data quality can pose a hurdle when legacy systems hold data in incompatible formats, while some suppliers may also remain hesitant to share granular cost or performance data, seeing it as a competitive vulnerability. And within finance teams, there\u2019s often a skills gap.\n\nSee also: CFOs Embrace Data Clouds Amid Shift Away From Pure-Play Record-Keeping\n\nUnderstanding the Data Types Behind the Finance Engine\n\nAs corporate finance departments expand their reliance on analytics, the distinction between structured and semi-structured data has become a critical factor in how effectively the Office of the CFO can forecast, report, and activate insights.\n\nStructured data, which refers to information stored in rigid formats such as databases, ERP tables and spreadsheets, remains the backbone of corporate finance. It includes general ledger entries, accounts payable records, tax filings and financial KPIs. This data type is inherently machine-readable, making it straightforward to analyze, audit and feed into business intelligence platforms.\n\nYet, finance teams are increasingly confronted with semi-structured data \u2014 information that carries some organizational tags or markers but lacks the rigid schema of traditional systems. Examples range from invoice PDFs and XML bank statements to contract management systems.\n\nWhile semi-structured data can contain valuable financial and operational insights, extracting them requires additional processing through tools such as optical character recognition (OCR), natural language processing (NLP) and robotic process automation (RPA).\n\nThe primary hurdle is integration. Structured data flows easily into dashboards and regulatory filings. Semi-structured data often lives in silos and is buried in email attachments, embedded in procurement portals, or locked inside vendor-submitted documentation. The delay in converting it into usable formats can slow decision-making, impede compliance and obscure risk indicators.\n\nForward-leaning finance organizations are responding with centralized data lakes, AI-assisted classification systems, and finance-specific machine learning models. These tools aim to automate the ingestion of semi-structured data, standardize it and merge it with the company\u2019s structured financial records, powering greater operational agility and unlocking the potential of the finance function.",

      "text": "Volatility, high interest rates and persistent pressure on liquidity are turning back-office functions into boardroom concerns. Perhaps nowhere is this shift more apparent than in accounts receivable (AR).\nHistorically, AR departments functioned primarily as bill collectors: issuing invoices, chasing late payments and managing exception workflows. Automation, where it existed, focused on digitizing the invoice lifecycle and improving efficiency.\nBut thanks to advances in artificial intelligence (AI), predictive analytics and enterprise data integration, what was once a transactional cost center is now being recast as a forward-looking engine of working capital optimization, risk mitigation and customer experience management.\n\u201cAR is no longer about settling the past. It\u2019s about predicting the future of cash,\u201d Pamela Novoa Ralli, head of product management at FIS, told PYMNTS. \u201cIt\u2019s moving from a responsive to a proactive view.\u201d\nAfter all, in today\u2019s environment, having visibility into future cash flow is no longer a luxury but frequently a requirement.\n\u201cAI allows predictability features to be at the core of the AR solution, instead of what we have seen in the last 10 years, which is about looking at the past and focusing on efficiency and effectiveness of the current state,\u201d Novoa Ralli said.\nBy applying machine learning models to historical payment data, behavioral signals and macroeconomic variables, modern AR systems can generate highly accurate forecasts of days sales outstanding (DSO), flag early signs of customer distress and even recommend optimal follow-up strategies based on real-time conditions.\nOf course, while the potential of artificial intelligence in AR is tantalizing, achieving full autonomy is a complex journey.\nRead the report: AI Power: The Technology Transforming Accounts Receivable\nNavigating the Road to AI-Powered AR Autonomy\nPerhaps the most important, and misunderstood, aspect of AI in AR is how it integrates with existing infrastructure. Contrary to fears of expensive rip-and-replace mandates, modern AI solutions are typically designed to surround rather than supplant legacy ERP and CRM systems.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about ripping out your existing systems. It\u2019s about wrapping them with intelligence,\u201d Novoa Ralli said.\nThat \u201cintelligent wrapper\u201d often takes the form of cloud-based AI layers that plug into existing platforms via APIs, ingesting data from multiple sources and delivering insights back into the systems finance teams already use.\nThis approach reduces time-to-value, mitigates risk and allows companies to incrementally scale their AI adoption. But successful implementation still requires investment in three foundational enablers: data governance, change management and cross-functional collaboration.\n\u201cWe see a much more educated AR user that understands data management \u2026 and is then able to drive cross-functional collaboration around AI deployment,\u201d Novoa Ralli said. \u201cCompanies are investing a lot in data governance. That is the first step toward anything related to AI.\u201d\n\u201cTrue autonomy isn\u2019t about fewer humans \u2026 it\u2019s about better judgment at machine speed,\u201d she said.\nAs for how to get there, six key milestones can help guide the way toward next-generation AR solutions. The first is specialization.\n\u201cWhat you see a lot [of] right now is generic agents,\u201d Novoa Ralli noted, stressing that next-generation AR solutions require agents specialized in specific domains such as credit, disputes, collections and reconciliation.\nSecond, when it comes to predictive analytics, trustworthy forecasts are key. While predictive analytics isn\u2019t new, the emphasis now is on improving the reliability of AI-powered insights.\nThird, self-service portals that operate as robust platforms enabling end-to-end user autonomy will be a crucial part of the user architecture.\nAutonomous credit management, continuous learning and embedded compliance round out the six crucial modernization markers.\n\u201cCompliance is evolving in front of our eyes \u2026 the ability for the system to self-regulate and to educate the user on their data management is also going to be critical,\u201d Novoa Ralli said.\nThe Future of AR Is Relationship Intelligence at Scale\nNowhere is the impact of artificial intelligence more visible than in dispute resolution. Traditionally, companies managed disputes reactively: waiting for customer complaints, then launching time-consuming investigations.\nWith AI, this process is being inverted. By analyzing patterns in disputes over time, AI models can predict which customers or invoice types are most likely to trigger issues. Some systems now go a step further, suggesting proactive outreach or invoice adjustments to preempt conflict entirely.\n\u201cEvery dispute is a data point,\u201d Novoa Ralli said.\nThe result: lower dispute volumes, faster resolution times and improved customer satisfaction. In industries with complex billing processes \u2014 like telecommunications, manufacturing or logistics \u2014 these improvements can translate to millions in recovered revenue and reduced churn.\nCredit management, too, is undergoing a reinvention. While traditional credit scoring models have long used static datasets and opaque methodologies, AI is enabling a more nuanced and transparent approach.\nFor its part, FIS is piloting the concept of a \u201ctrust score\u201d \u2014 an explainable, auditable model that not only generates a risk score but shows users how it arrived at that conclusion. The goal is to enhance both the accuracy and credibility of credit assessments.\n\u201cOur core value is: can you show me the data?\u201d Novoa Ralli said. \u201cWe want systems that tell you the answer and also how they got there.\u201d\nWant to know the best time to call a customer about an upcoming invoice? The system will tell you \u2014 based on payment patterns, calendar activity, and behavioral signals. Wondering whether a one-time delay signals risk? The AI will assess it in context.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see a lot more intelligence around relationship management and total value of the relationship and not just invoice-level transactions,\u201d said Novoa Ralli, pointing to the fact that the AR function is increasingly no longer just about collecting cash but about managing risk, optimizing liquidity and deepening customer relationships.\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter."

      "text": "With the U.S. on Thursday (July 10) threatening additional tariffs of up to 50% on countries like Brazil and materials like copper, the operational migraine that keeping up with each new announcement brings doesn\u2019t appear to be going away any time soon.\nAnd while some businesses are implicitly embracing the TACO (the acronym being used for \u201cTrump always chickens out\u201d) trade and counting on the administration ultimately backing down, the most forward thinking B2B firms are betting on time to cash mastery by treating liquidity not just as a financial metric but as a dynamic business asset.\nTime to cash (T2C) is a strategic framework that reimagines how enterprises manage the end-to-end flow of money \u2014 from invoice issuance to final reconciliation in the bank account. More than a narrow look at days sales outstanding (DSO), T2C spans revenue realization, disbursement strategy, working capital optimization and the underlying technology stack that enables it all.\nFor chief financial officers (CFOs), that means moving beyond static cash flow reports toward a more real-time, predictive and action-oriented model. Time to cash isn\u2019t just a reporting concern; it\u2019s becoming a core strategic differentiator. Companies that can both accelerate inflows and intelligently manage outflows may be able to enjoy a material advantage in volatility by reinvesting faster, borrowing less and pivoting with precision.\nRead more: How B2B Payments Data Turns Customer Retention Into a Growth Strategy\nThe CFO as Ecosystem Architect\nTime to cash is not new\u2014it\u2019s the cousin of \u201corder to cash\u201d (O2C), a well-established supply chain and finance process. But what\u2019s different today is how holistic and strategic it\u2019s become. Time to cash now encompasses lead qualification, contracting, fulfillment, invoicing, collections and even embedded finance. Every department, from marketing to customer success, is being evaluated on its ability to reduce friction and latency.\n\u201cHow long is the invoice in the building?\u201d Edenred Pay CFO Joe Denson told PYMNTS during a discussion about payables automation. \u201cIdeally, you\u2019re measuring handling time in minutes, not days. How many people are involved? Fewer is better, as long as separation of duties and controls are preserved. And can I get the data in a way that\u2019s sortable and manageable? \u2026 AP automation allows finance staff to stop doing manual tasks like entering invoices or looking up suppliers.\u201d\nTo help with identifying where businesses sit currently, Visa and PYMNTS Intelligence created a dynamic benchmarking report that can help users take a deeper look into how their DPO (days payable outstanding) and other metrics stack up against peers and outperformers within their chosen industries.\nThe sales-to-cash cycle remains an operational blind spot in many organizations. But finance teams are beginning to assert more control by partnering with sales, credit and collections to streamline invoicing, reduce disputes and better segment customers by risk profile.\nAutomation also plays a key role here. Intelligent accounts receivable (AR) systems can tailor outreach based on customer behavior, apply payments at the invoice level and trigger dynamic collections workflows. When orchestrated well, revenue realization becomes a repeatable engine, not a firefighting exercise.\nSee also: For CFOs, the Tech Stack Is the Business Strategy\nLiquidity Becomes a Competitive Weapon\nTechnology alone doesn\u2019t drive velocity. What distinguishes high-performing firms is a cash-first culture. One that embeds liquidity awareness into daily operations across sales, procurement and operations.\nIn these organizations, cash conversion is a shared KPI. Deal desk terms are evaluated for DSO impact. Procurement teams balance cost and payment terms in tandem. Inventory is managed with liquidity, not just logistics, in mind.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of change going on, and it all centers around working capital,\u201d David Bork, senior vice president, Boost 100 Business Development at Boost Payment Solutions, told PYMNTS.\nStill, PYMNTS Intelligence data has found that tariffs and other supply chain disruptions have forced most middle-market U.S. goods and retail companies into reactive mode. This can result in payments staying stuck in last century, with paper checks and manual data entry still common elements of accounts receivable.\nPYNTS Intelligence has also found that when it comes to cash flow, security and convenience, virtual cards offer AP and AR departments a suite of advantages. At the end of the day, B2B companies want a simple, secure, consumer-like digital payments experience, Greg Castro, president of PayTrace by North, writes in a new PYMNTS eBook, \u201cHalftime 2025: Charting the Future of Payments.\u201d"

      "text": "Today, however, trade volatility has gone from exception to norm, and traditional Excel-based forecasting no longer suffices.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have visibility, we can\u2019t move forward,\u201d Luc Les\u00e9n\u00e9cal, CEO of Parisian fashion company Saint James, said in a July 3 report by The New York Times.\nSince the start of 2025, businesses around the globe have been subject to tariff whiplash. President Donald Trump announced new Canadian tariffs Thursday night (July 10).\nIn this kind of environment, the old planning tools like manual Excel models, static quarterly forecasts and generalized revenue targets are no longer fit for purpose. Spreadsheet forecasting in 2025\u2019s landscape is like navigating a thunderstorm with a paper map. Businesses need the equivalent of an always-on business radar, and CFOs are being tasked with creating it.\nFor companies with much of their revenue exposed to international trade, accurate and adaptive financial forecasting is no longer a best practice, it\u2019s essential for survival. This reality is turning CFOs into chief forecasting officers while positioning them as a new nerve center for strategic decision making.\nRead also: Forget the TACO Trade, B2B Firms Are Betting on Time to Cash\nThe Rise of Forecasting-First Finance\nIn the traditional model, finance operated like a rear-view mirror. Teams tallied up what happened, compared it to the plan, and adjusted the next plan accordingly. But that traditional approach no longer suffices. The future needs to be forecast, and it may also need to be financed. PYMNTS Intelligence data found that 1 in 5 small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) without access to financing fear they may not survive the trade-induced operational tumult.\nThe entire office of the CFO \u2014 including financial planning and analysis, treasury, controllership, tax, investor relations and strategy \u2014 is being restructured around real-time forecasting, decision intelligence and scenario modeling. As traditional planning cycles break down, forecasting agility has become the CFO\u2019s most valuable currency.\nFirms can\u2019t make an equipment investment with 6-month-old assumptions, and solving that problem requires cross-departmental cooperation when it comes to modeling scenarios with, for example, five different interest rate paths and three trade regimes.\nThis forecasting transformation is underpinned by a new generation of enterprise tools, replacing the fragmented spreadsheets of the past.\nCompanies are implementing integrated planning platforms that connect ERP, procurement, logistics, treasury and risk management systems into a single financial model. These platforms ingest real-time data from global operations and allow finance teams to simulate changes in volumes, costs and working capital on demand.\nAgainst this backdrop, the integration of artificial intelligence isn\u2019t just automating old tasks but reframing how finance contributes to strategy. AI models and advanced regressions are being used to simulate scenarios, identify patterns and highlight leading indicators across vast datasets.\nSee also: Trump\u2019s Global Tariffs Position CFOs as New Supply Chain Architects\nHow CFOs Are Unlocking Forecasting as a Strategic Weapon\nThe implications of this CFO shift go beyond better numbers. As forecasting becomes more predictive and granular, it can shape decisions traditionally led by product, marketing or sales.\nFinancial visibility and predictive forecasting are important when exploring new pricing strategies. The PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201cTariffs and Business Uncertainty: The Current State of Play\u201d showed that 42% of goods firms and 21% of services firms are planning to increase prices in reaction to the tariffs.\nSeparate PYMNTS Intelligence in the June CAIO Report, \u201cThe Enterprise Reset: Tariffs, Uncertainty and the Limits of Operational Response,\u201d found that 60% of firms reported that they are addressing today\u2019s tariff-induced challenges through tighter partner coordination, smarter sourcing contract terms, more dynamic price modeling and greater alignment between finance and procurement function.\nThe transformation is still underway. Many companies are grappling with fragmented systems, siloed data and a talent gap in advanced analytics. Others struggle to embed insights from finance into day-to-day decisions outside the C-suite.\nAgility is a competitive advantage, so finance teams are stepping into a new role not just as stewards of capital \u2014 but as architects of growth."

      "text": "American enterprises are under pressure. Between renewed tariff hikes, global supply chain instability and rising operational costs, many firms face decision points that could shape their futures.\nAnd that can put the finance team in the hot seat, or command center, depending on the business.\nYet the response from large enterprises to today\u2019s ongoing macro uncertainty and supply-chain challenges, according to new research from PYMNTS Intelligence\u2019s June 2025 CAIO Report, \u201cThe Enterprise Reset: Tariffs, Uncertainty and the Limits of Operational Response,\u201d is not one of sweeping transformation but of strategic hesitation.\nThe report found that a minority of companies, fewer than 6%, are taking bold steps like reshoring manufacturing or redesigning products in light of tariff and trade turbulence. Instead, most are opting for temporary cost-cutting, incremental pricing changes and cautious contract renegotiations.\nThe backdrop to this cautious recalibration is a volatile trade environment. From semiconductor restrictions to energy tariffs, the global business landscape is being reshaped not by market forces but by regulatory chess matches.\nEnterprises now confront a set of \u201cknown unknowns\u201d: rising tariff threats, supply bottlenecks and sudden price spikes. It\u2019s at this nexus where operational discipline, financial data and focused resilience are shaping a smarter, more deliberate transformation.\nTariffs, Tension and Tactical Thinking\nThe PYMNTS Intelligence report data found that nearly all firms (96%) say tariffs have negatively impacted their operations, and 84% cite persistent shortages as an ongoing challenge. Yet, fewer than 1 in 4 (23%) plan to make long-term operational changes in the next year.\nAt first glance, it may seem irrational for companies to not reconfigure their supply chains or rethink their cost structures in the face of prolonged uncertainty. But the truth is more nuanced. Moving a major supplier or changing a production site, for example, isn\u2019t like flipping a switch. It involves compliance reviews, customer approvals and major capital expenditure.\nAt the same time, any executives are betting that tariffs are temporary. There\u2019s a belief \u2014 hope, even \u2014 that cooler heads will prevail and mitigate aggressive trade stances. Additionally, despite years of digitization talk, many companies may still lack the real-time visibility needed to confidently make cross-border structural decisions.\nSo, what are companies doing? A majority of firms (60%) surveyed report they are addressing these challenges through tighter partner coordination, smarter sourcing contract terms, more dynamic price modeling and greater alignment between finance and procurement functions.\nRead the report: The Enterprise Reset: Tariffs, Uncertainty and the Limits of Operational Response\nThe Emerging Strategic Model of Discipline as Growth Center\nIn this vein, firms are leveraging internal data, including procurement and payment analytics, to monitor supplier performance and maintain operational continuity without upending established workflows. Many firms are prioritizing improvements to existing systems to avoid unnecessary complexity.\nMore than half of surveyed enterprises are renegotiating supplier and logistics terms to gain pricing leverage and reduce exposure. The report found that technology investment is rising, particularly in systems that offer better visibility into cash flow, vendor risk and procurement performance.\nThese adjustments reflect a deeper integration between finance, operations and procurement functions \u2014 something many organizations accelerated during the pandemic and are now institutionalizing.\nThe findings from report suggest a broader shift underway: the emergence of a strategic model that prioritizes real-time insight, cross-functional alignment and controlled responsiveness. Rather than pursuing large, immediate transformation, organizations are building resilience through readiness \u2014 preparing the groundwork for change, but executing with discipline.\nUltimately, today\u2019s tactical posture is not a sign of delay, but preparation. Many enterprises are using this period of uncertainty to sharpen their internal capabilities and modernize systems, so they are better positioned for more transformative moves in the future."

      "text": "For decades, enterprise software has been anchored in databases, their primary function to store and manage records with precision.\nThe role of the CFO \u2014 often seen as the guardian of these records \u2014 has revolved around ensuring compliance, accuracy and financial clarity. But in the last few years, the paradigm has begun to shift. The emergence of the data cloud is transforming how enterprises think about their most valuable asset: data.\nEnterprise software 1.0 was built on a transactional foundation. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) and financial management systems were designed to track every dollar and asset with a strict, structured approach. Companies invested heavily in systems that could reliably handle their financials, procurement and customer records.\nWhile these tools have served their purpose well, they operate under a fundamental constraint: they are optimized for structured data and record-keeping, not for the dynamic insights that modern enterprises demand.\nCompanies today don\u2019t just need to record history; They need to predict the future. The emergence of data clouds is reshaping this equation, while at the same time challenging enterprise CFOs to move beyond being record-keepers to becoming strategic data stewards, able to leverage real-time insights for decision-making.\nSee also: Why Every Business Now Wants a Data Lakehouse\nFrom Structured Records to Fluid Insights\nThe traditional model of enterprise software is rigid, relying on predefined schemas that dictate how data is stored and accessed. This rigidity is both a strength that ensures consistency and reliability, as well as a limitation that makes real-time analysis and unstructured data integration difficult.\nThe rise of the data cloud changes this dynamic by introducing elasticity, allowing organizations to ingest, store and analyze massive datasets without predefined constraints.\nPlatforms like Snowflake have built their business on separating compute from storage, a radical departure from the traditional database model. Databricks, with its Lakehouse architecture, merges the best of data lakes and warehouses, breaking down silos and allowing for more flexible analytics.\nMeanwhile, open table formats such as Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake are making interoperability across cloud environments easier, ensuring that data is no longer confined to proprietary systems.\nThe marketplace is increasingly realizing the value of these approaches. Databricks this January raised $5 billion in financing, its largest debt raise ever, and one that follows a $10 billion equity funding round in December that raised its valuation to $62 billion. Snowflake last week (Feb. 27) said it is opening a new Silicon Valley \u201cAI hub\u201d and investing up to $200 million in startups.\nWith the data cloud, CFOs can move from simply tracking past performance to shaping future outcomes. For example, a CFO at a global manufacturing firm can now integrate operational data from supply chain systems with external market data to anticipate disruptions. Rather than waiting for quarterly reports, they can assess cash flow in real-time, running predictive models to determine the optimal time for capital investments.\nSimilarly, financial controllers can automate compliance and auditing processes, reducing human error and freeing up resources for higher-value tasks.\nRead more: This Week in B2B Was About Unlocking Trapped Payments Data\nLooking Ahead to a Data-Driven Future for CFOs\nHistorically, finance teams operated within well-defined silos, with data housed in different systems \u2014 ERP software, customer relationship management (CRM) platforms, and supply chain databases. Extracting insights required cumbersome ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, slowing down decision-making. The modern data cloud helps to eliminate these inefficiencies by enabling seamless data integration across disparate systems.\n\u201cThe middle to back office, they\u2019re no longer just a cost center,\u201d Meghan Oakes, vice president of customer success at FIS, told PYMNTS. \u201cThey\u2019re a value-added partner for everybody within the business. There are many different aspects of that middle to back office that are now at the forefront of how companies operate.\u201d\nStill, the data cloud is not a silver bullet. It comes with its own risks, many of which can be serious. Last year, the enterprise data cloud landscape witnessed a Snowflake data breach that snowballed to include AT&T, Santander Bank, Advance Auto Parts, Ticketmaster parent company LiveNation and over 160 of the world\u2019s largest companies.\nAs enterprises continue to embrace the data cloud, the nature of enterprise software itself is evolving. Traditional record-keeping systems are giving way to intelligent platforms that leverage AI and automation to deliver actionable insights. This transformation could hold the potential to redefine how CFOs and finance teams operate in the coming years."

      "text": "What happens when large companies face disruption in the global business environment but are uncertain about how it might unfold and how long it will last? If they\u2019re enterprise-level goods and retailers in the United States, most don\u2019t rush to replace their foreign suppliers with domestic ones, for a start.\nU.S. business leaders are now making hard decisions as U.S. tariffs on imports undergo significant fluctuations and overseas supply chains come under strain. Still, hardly any are rejiggering their operations to make them U.S.-based and dependent on American materials and supplies. Instead of reshoring\u2014a goal of the Trump administration\u2019s trade agenda to bring American manufacturing home\u2014they\u2019re negotiating with suppliers, cutting overhead costs and raising prices. That suggests they\u2019re betting that the current back-and-forth of the tariffs regime will ultimately result in more favorable (for them) trade deals or lower-than-proposed levies. This stance resembles the \u201cTACO\u201d (\u201cTrump always chickens out\u201d) view held by many investors who share the same sentiment. PYMNTS Intelligence research shows that most firms are reacting to the shifting global trade war with a wait-and-see approach that\u2019s focused on near-term responses, not long-term structural changes.\nThese are just some findings from \u201cThe Enterprise Reset: Tariffs, Uncertainty and the Limits of Operational Response,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence study. Data was collected from a survey of 60 CFOs\u2014each representing a U.S. company generating at least $1 billion in annual revenue\u2014that was conducted May 6, 2025, through May 16, 2025.\nThe \u201cTACO\u201d Mindset\nMarkets call it the \u201cTACO\u201d trade\u2014Trump Always Chickens Out. The phrase captures investor skepticism that sweeping tariffs will fully materialize as currently laid out for the long haul. Leaders of enterprise companies appear to be applying a similar logic as they assess how to respond and make tactical changes in the present.\nJust 5.9% of firms in May reported reshoring their foreign suppliers, down from 9.1% the month before. Roughly one in three (35%) enterprises surveyed said they might diversify their international suppliers. This share is down from 45% who said the same in April. The share of companies that have already made that move rose to 29% in May from 26% a month earlier.\nNearly all (96%) of goods and retail firms\u2014the sector most directly impacted by tariffs\u2014say the levies present a chance to support the U.S. economy. Eight in 10 of those companies say tariffs will free up financial resources to invest in innovation.\nCFOs make short-term fixes as tariff uncertainty continues.\nBut those widespread beliefs aren\u2019t driving investment. What they are driving is short-term tactical responses intended to cope with uncertainty now. More than nine in 10 goods and retail companies identified negative impacts associated with tariffs. These include planning challenges and higher costs for reconfiguring their supply chains. Nearly seven in 10 (69%) fear that retaliatory tariffs from major trading partners, including Canada, China, Mexico and the European Union, will harm their exports. The findings reveal a disconnect between what large companies claim is possible and what they are actually doing on the ground, as well as their expectations for the future. This thesis aligns with PYMNTS Intelligence\u2019s analysis showing that 94% of enterprise CFOs in goods have not attempted reshoring. Like other firms, these retailers are making defensive adjustments designed to buy time while the global trade war unfolds.\nThe survey data indicate that companies are opting for margin management over significant structural changes. Just over one in two CFOs say they are likely to raise prices in response to tariffs. Nearly three in 10 report having already done so (28%). Thirty-five percent have cut operational costs, including employee salaries, while 72% say further cuts are possible. These tactical adjustments significantly outpace structural ones. Just 10% of enterprises reported redesigning their products to use different materials in May, down from 27% in April.\nIn other words, enterprises don\u2019t appear to be acting like tariffs at their current levels are here to stay. Instead, they seem to be hoping to run out the clock. That\u2019s the TACO mindset: Make tactical moves in the short term to survive without betting on a future that may never arrive.\nTariff Uncertainty Is Universal\u2014But Action Is Cautious\nThe actions enterprises have taken so far reflect their current assessments of the impact of tariffs today. In the goods sector, 89% of CFOs say the duties are expected to have a mostly or entirely negative effect on their business finances. Just 3.8% see any upside. That contrast becomes sharper across sectors. In services, which are likely to be indirectly affected by tariffs through shifts in spending and other spillover macroeconomic effects, only 27% expect a negative impact. Interestingly, in technology, none do. In fact, 58% of tech CFOs believe tariffs will have a mostly or entirely positive effect. This is possibly due to their reliance on outsourced labor for coding and software development, an area not impacted by tariffs.\nIn the technology sector, the lack of immediate cost exposure likely allows firms to maintain flexibility. Their posture can be more opportunistic, rather than reactive. The bifurcation is structural: CFOs of firms dependent on physical goods and cross-border sourcing experience tariffs as a financial drag. Companies built around services or software are less likely to.\nYet for the average enterprise, the difference isn\u2019t abstract\u2014it\u2019s concrete and operational. Surveyed firms have responded with cost cuts, supplier renegotiations, hiring freezes and pricing changes. More than half are negotiating with suppliers for better pricing. Over three in 10 are leveraging just-in-time inventory. Nearly one-third are reducing their operational costs, and nearly four in 10 anticipate potential hiring freezes or layoffs. These actions, taken under pressure, are less signs of permanent, long-term transformation and more signs of coping in the near term.\nSupply Chain Overhauls Remain on Pause Due to Tariff Uncertainty\nTrue, goods firms expect near-term disruption. Eighty-four percent of goods sector CFOs say they expect shortages or delays in getting products this year. At the same time, 72% expect that to happen in the next three to 12 months. Two-thirds expect raw material costs to rise during this period. Fewer than one in four believe their firms will enhance their supply chain resilience within a year.\nThe timeline to rebuild is long. Among goods firms, 61% say resilience improvements could take up to three years\u2014a period that bumps up the end of President Trump\u2019s second term. Services firms show a similar lag: More than eight in 10 expect higher costs and 67% expect shortages, but only half foresee supply chain gains within 12 months. The technology sector is an interesting outlier: 100% of companies expect higher input costs and 75% expect shortages. Just 30% say resilience will arrive within the next three months, with eight in 10 expecting that within the next 12 months. In short, firms are being asked to make long-term decisions on a dime. Next to none are taking big risks around these choices.\nEven where firms see a long-term upside, near-term action remains rare. Notably, six in 10 goods and retail firms say tariffs are a chance to support the U.S. economy; eight in 10 tech firms say the same.\nIn nearly every sector, action on supply chain transformation trails behind expectations of cost pressure and delay. The outcome is a playbook of temporary margin management\u2014price increases, cost cuts, renegotiations\u2014not structural redesign.\nRead More\nPYMNTS Intelligence is the leading provider of information on the trends driving executive decisions in response to U.S. tariff policies.
