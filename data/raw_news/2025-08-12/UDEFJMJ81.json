  "description": "Here are 12 companies proving that because of more women contemplating motherhood over 40, the work-caregiving crossroads is a high-growth market.",
  "content": "For decades, motherhood over 40 was framed as a compromise. It meant climbing the corporate ladder, with family as a tradeoff. In the past couple of years, births to mothers under 20 by 73% since 1990, while births to women over 40 have increased by 193%. This shift in birth patterns indicates a trend towards women having children later in life.\n\nof mothers with children under 18 are in the workforce, yet mothers of children under six have lower participation rates than those with older kids. At the same time, the U.S. fertility market is booming, valued at $36.5 billion in 2024 and projected to more than double by 2034. Here are 12 companies proving that because of more women contemplating motherhood over 40, the work-caregiving crossroads is a high-growth market with the power to reshape industries from childcare to eldercare to fertility.\n\nServing more than 50,000 parents with a 92% monthly retention rate, Joy pairs parents with expert coaches and on-demand toolkits to help them negotiate flexible hours, design return-to-work plans, and set boundaries. Founder Emily Greenberg adds that most of Joy\u2019s users are Millennial and Gen X parents who delayed parenthood for career or financial stability, bringing a strategic mindset to raising children.\n\nAfter giving birth prematurely and struggling to find a pediatrician, Allofam founder Heidi Schaler created a platform that matches families with vetted pediatricians, lactation consultants, child psychologists, and other specialists. Parents can filter by language, care philosophy, and needs. Allofam has served 20 families and partnered with two Denver clinics. Older parents, Schaler says, seek providers who treat the whole family, not just the symptoms.\n\nAmanda Lukof, a former corporate lawyer, founded Eleplan while raising young children and caring for her adult brother with autism. She recognized that many mothers in their late 30s and 40s are \u201csandwich generation\u201d caregivers, juggling the needs of both young children and aging relatives. Eleplan addresses this by consolidating care plans, medical histories, and schedules in one secure place, saving caregivers an average of over 80 hours per year. Today, the platform serves over 250 users through 12 partnerships.\n\nLaunched by Kelly Hubbell, a working mother whose life transformed after hiring a house manager, Sage Haus offers services from meal prep to executive-assistant-style household coordination. Clients, 80% of whom are in dual-career or senior-leadership households, gain back 15\u201330 hours a week. The company grew 480% year-over-year, serving 68 households and reaching over 4,000 additional through free resources in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nFounded by Maggie Gremminger and Meredith Patrick, Leona helps employers treat parental leave as a retention strategy. It creates reintegration plans, coaches teams on empathetic communication, and turns a life transition into a culture-building opportunity, meeting the expectations of senior-level mothers.\n\nPoppins Payroll automates tax filing, direct deposit, and compliance for families employing caregivers, making the arrangement legal and fair while granting caregivers access to benefits like Social Security. Founder Mike Wussow has helped over 65,000 families nationwide, a solution particularly relevant to later parents relying on in-home childcare.\n\nFounded by Eloise Drane, a fertility advocate with 17 years in surrogacy and egg donation, Fertility360 reframes fertility as a long-term plan, not a crisis. It integrates education, early planning, emotional health support, and financial readiness for IVF, surrogacy, and egg freezing, serving women who delayed family building for career or financial stability.\n\nLaunching with 500 people on the waitlist, StorkFund combines high-yield savings, employer contributions, and provider discounts for fertility, parental leave, childcare, and education. Founded by Javeste Dulcio, the company has 75 providers in its pipeline and employer interest from seven companies, including a Fortune 500.\n\nFounded by Stephanie Fornaro, a court-appointed special advocate for children, Hello Nanny matches families with vetted nannies, family assistants, and household managers. With a 90% placement success rate and a network of over 5,000 nannies, it has supported 1,500 families and seen 300% lead growth in 2025.\n\nFounded by Jen Saxton, a mother who had children at 35 and 38, Tot Squad partners with retailers like Target and Amazon so parents can register for services (lactation support, prenatal massage, and doula care) alongside traditional products. It has served 50,000 families through over 20 partnerships.\n\nGiveCare delivers personalized, 160-character micro-interventions (stress reduction, curated resources, appointment prompts) while tracking caregiver well-being in real time. Founder Ali Madad spent seven years caring for both parents while raising four children, and built the platform for the growing number of dual caregivers balancing children and eldercare.\n\nFounded by Lauren Levinger and Amrit Tietz, Spread The Jelly publishes unfiltered motherhood stories on autism care, maternal health inequities, queer parenting, and more. In 10 months, it has reached approximately two million monthly views and built a community of over 26,000.\n\nAcross childcare, fertility, workplace policy, care coordination, and storytelling, these founders share one truth: they are reshaping the caregiving economy from the inside out for women comfortable with motherhood over 40. They are making it intentional, inclusive, and fully integrated into modern work and life.",

Alex has patiently walked us through confusing tax situations and, more importantly, ultimately taken care of them for us. It's also been insanely easy to reach a human at Poppins when necessary and everyone has been incredibly kind.\nI wish I had started this journey with Poppins instead of trying to do it myself! Thanks, Alex and the PP team!\nI used Poppins Payroll for several years to handle compensation for caregivers for my parents. The service was fast, professional, personal, and\u2014to coin a phrase\u2014practically perfect in every way. Would so highly recommend this for anyone who needs to pay household employees.\nPoppins Payroll has been an amazing service for us through the 5 years we've used a nanny for our little ones. It's super easy to update nanny hours each week, and I never had to think about the taxes. Poppins Payroll took care of everything and was so reliable. Definitely recommend this service!!\nMy experience with Poppins Payroll since 2020 has been exemplary. This tool has simplified paying and managing my nanny's taxes, defining convenience in household payroll. The automation is spot on. Calculations and filings are taken care of, ensuring compliance without my constant oversight. When I've needed help, their support has been prompt and knowledgeable, providing solutions with minimal disruption. The peace of mind Poppins Payroll offers, knowing that payroll is under control, is invaluable.\nPoppins Payroll has been wonderful. They make everything so easy and seamless. We had several complicated questions along the way and they always responded SO QUICKLY with a clear and complete answer. We recommend it to all our friends!\nPoppins Payroll has been an excellent and completely seamless experience! I was nervous about taxes and dealing with a household employee on the payroll and everyone at Poppins put me at ease, the actual payroll system and website functionality was easy (never had an issue), but perhaps best of all? When I had an urgent question or a time-sensitive concern, I could get a friendly, knowledgeable person on the phone quickly with no phone trees or hassle at all. Excellent all around!\nSimply the best payroll service - competitively priced and the team go above and beyond to provide great support. I've used other payroll services and would recommend Poppins Payroll above other services I've used.\nHighly recommend this service. It checked every box. Easy to sign up and set up, easy to use, good pricing and great customer service. The couple times I had questions they were extremely responsive and helpful. Very happy with the decision to go with Poppins over other options I considered after significant research.\nThis took any hassle and headache out of making sure my son's sitter was paid accurately and on time, with all necessary documentation, and that tax requirements were met. It saved a lot of time and gave me the peace of mind that everything was handled as it needed to be. I barely even had to think about it. I highly recommend this service to anyone using a nanny or regular babysitter care for their kids.\nI found Poppins to be a great company to work with. Probably one of the best companies I've worked with in the past decade. Poppins took care of getting the tax ids that I needed instead of making me wade through that process. Taxes were paid on time. I got emails along the way so there were no surprises when large withdrawals were made to pay taxes. And when I called with questions, humans answered the phones, usually with no hold time. They do customer service like it used to be done, before phone trees were invented. I wish more companies were like this one."

      "text": "July 2025\nThe global fertility market size is calculated at USD 36.57 billion in 2024, grew to USD 39.88 billion in 2025, and is projected to reach around USD 87.05 billion by 2034. The market is expanding at a CAGR of 9.06% between 2025 and 2034. The growing awareness of IVF, the rising adoption of assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs), and the escalating rates of infertility globally are anticipated to drive market expansion shortly. Moreover, the presence of different treatment alternatives is expected to enhance the fertility market throughout the forecast period.\nFertility refers to the inherent capability of an organism to attain a clinical pregnancy via a complex biological mechanism called reproduction, aided by the reproductive system, to generate offspring and ensure the continuation of the species. The increasing prevalence of infertility globally is a significant contributor to market expansion. Major factors contributing to infertility involve lifestyle alterations such as unhealthy eating and obesity, stress, and alcohol use, along with medical issues like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometrial tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Additionally, due to late pregnancy, the declining egg quality in aging women contributes to infertility rates. According to WHO estimation for 2024, approximately 1 in every 6 people of reproductive age will experience infertility for a lifetime worldwide. The market is experiencing substantial innovation, primarily fueled by progress in ART techniques such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). These enhancements are expanding treatment choices and elevating success rates, consequently raising the demand for the fertility market.\nAI, especially machine learning (ML), is revolutionizing the fertility industry by improving diagnostics, personalizing treatments, and increasing success rates. ML algorithms can evaluate genetic, medical, and lifestyle information to forecast fertility problems and customize personalized treatment strategies. In IVF, machine learning enhances embryo selection, raising success rates and minimizing the number of cycles needed. Apps and wearables powered by AI provide real-time tracking of fertility, utilizing data to forecast ovulation and identify hormonal imbalances. Moreover, AI-powered genomic analysis aids in customized therapies and embryo selection, minimizing genetic risks. AI decreases treatment costs and enhances accessibility by automating routine tasks, resulting in more efficient fertility care. Nonetheless, as AI increasingly integrates into fertility, ethical issues like data privacy, discrimination, and oversight of decisions must be considered. Guaranteeing transparency and oversight will be essential for the safe and effective application of fertility practices.\nRising Need for Assisted Reproductive Technology (AST)\nThe need for sophisticated fertility procedures such as IVF, IUI, and IVF without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is continually increasing. This rise is mainly attributed to reasons like later childbearing, increased awareness of fertility choices, and ongoing advancements in reproductive technology. Moreover, shifting societal standards, changing lifestyle preferences, and the increasing demand for family planning assistance are encouraging more people and couples to seek fertility treatments, leading to a heightened need for these services.\nThe phenomenon of women giving birth later in life, usually after the age of 35, is known as \"advanced maternal age\" or postponed childbearing. In recent years, this trend has gained popularity in numerous developed nations because of different social, economic, and cultural influences. Nonetheless, postponing childbirth can profoundly impact both individuals and society. Women opting to have children at a later age might encounter an increased risk of complications such as miscarriage, pregnancy problems, and genetic disorders in their offspring. Consequently, there has been an increase in the demand for fertility services and treatments like IVF, egg freezing, and various reproductive technologies to assist individuals delaying parenthood.\nHigh-Cost Fertility Treatment\nThe steep expense of fertility procedures, especially IVF, poses a significant financial obstacle for numerous individuals. Due to limited insurance coverage and considerable differences, these treatments may discourage individuals from seeking assistance. Certain individuals can manage to pay for just one or two treatment cycles, diminishing their likelihood of achieving success. Stress, a significant contributor to fertility issues, can also have a detrimental impact, and infertility treatments can be exhausting emotionally. This emotional pressure can additionally influence the success of the therapies. Moreover, in specific areas, particular reproductive methods are governed by legal or ethical standards, constraining the choices accessible to individuals seeking help. IVF therapy is a major financial strain because it typically costs between $11,000 and $18,000 each cycle, including diagnostics and medication.\nOpportunity\nMedical Regeneration and Stem Cell Treatment\nResearchers are investigating stem cell therapy as a possible remedy for women experiencing early ovarian failure or diminished ovarian reserve. Stem cells may be introduced into the ovaries to encourage the growth of new follicles and enhance ovarian performance. These stem cells can originate from different sources, including bone marrow or adipose tissue. Moreover, researchers are investigating stem cells' capability to restore and heal the endometrium (the lining of the uterus). This may help women suffering from issues such as Asherman's syndrome, which leads to infertility or recurrent miscarriages, or those with a thin endometrium. Stem cell therapy is under research as a potential solution for male infertility, given that spermatogonia stem cells can be cultivated and collected in vitro.\nBy offering, the assisted reproductive technology segment registered its dominance over the global fertility market in 2024. Due to ART methods such as IUI, ICSI, and IVF, a wider variety of people now enjoy improved access to fertility services. This has resulted in the expansion of the fertility clinic market and associated services. Improvements in ART methods have also lowered the risks linked to reproductive therapies while enhancing success rates. Advancements like time-lapse imaging of embryos, vitrification of eggs and embryos, and preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) have improved results for patients. The demand for ART services has risen because of reasons such as the growing occurrence of same-sex parenthood, postponed childbearing, and infertility caused by medical interventions. The increasing application of ART has generated ethical issues, such as the disposal of embryos, the selection of genetic characteristics, and the commercialization of human reproduction.\nBy offering, the fertility drugs segment is expected to grow at a significant rate in the fertility market during the forecast period. Due to its accessibility and comparatively cheaper cost when compared to more involved treatments like IVF, more people are using fertility medicines as a first treatment choice as knowledge of reproductive concerns grows. Additionally, fertility medications are less intrusive, which appeals to couples looking for easier, non-invasive procedures. Fertility drugs are now a more dependable option for many people due to improvements in drug formulations and increased efficacy. The need for these therapies is also being driven by lifestyle factors, delayed childbirth, and increased infertility rates.\nClomid, which is frequently used to induce ovulation in women with irregular cycles, is an example of the growing need for fertility medications. Similarly, for women who do not react to oral medicines, injectable gonadotropins are used to increase ovulation. These medications are more common than more costly procedures like IVF since they provide a less intrusive and more economical alternative.\nBy end-user, the fertility clinics segment held a dominant presence in the fertility market in 2024. Fertility clinics are essential in the reproductive sector by providing a range of services to individuals and couples facing infertility challenges. These services encompass sperm donation, egg preservation, fertility evaluation, IUI, and IVF. The fertility industry has expanded swiftly in recent years due to reasons such as postponed parenthood, heightened awareness of fertility options, and progress in reproductive technology. Consequently, fertility clinics have grown worldwide, encompassing both large, specialized facilities and smaller, independent practices.\nFor instance,\nBy end-user, the hospital segment is projected to grow at a significant rate during the coming years. Specialized fertility clinics can operate independently or are commonly located in hospitals. These clinics provide numerous treatments, such as IVF, IUI, fertility exams, and further reproductive therapy. For individuals undergoing medical treatments like chemotherapy or radiation that may affect their fertility, hospitals provide fertility preservation procedures, such as freezing sperm or eggs. Hospitals typically collaborate with reproductive specialists, including endocrinologists, embryologists, and fertility doctors, to offer state-of-the-art fertility treatments. Additionally, hospitals offer educational resources, support groups, and counseling to help individuals and couples deal with infertility concerns.\nEurope dominated globally and held the largest share of 34% in the fertility market in 2024. In recent years, the need for fertility treatments has increased throughout Europe, fueled by factors such as evolving lifestyles, postponed childbearing, and rising infertility rates. Fertility treatment laws differ across countries, with certain nations maintaining more lenient regulations that permit various reproductive services, whereas others enforce tighter rules. Across Europe, many fertility clinics offer services that include advanced reproductive treatments as well as fundamental fertility assessments. These clinics frequently offer tailored care and assistance for individuals and couples receiving treatment. Owing to variations in regulations and expenses among countries, certain individuals might opt to pursue fertility treatments overseas, visiting another European country for care.\nIn Germany, businesses are increasingly utilizing digital technology to promote market expansion, the expansion of the market in Germany is fueled by innovations in medical technology, increased awareness of infertility and treatment options, and elevated success rates for IVF. The National Library of Medicine reports that approximately 3% of children in Germany are conceived via in vitro fertilization (IVF), emphasizing the growing dependence on this reproduction method. For instance, in April 2024, the Berlin-based fertility company Ovom Care secured $5.34 million in seed funding to improve its Ovom Technology Ecosystem and grow its hybrid care model nationwide.\nThe market is driven large by encouraging government programs, favorable government laws, regulations, and rising investments. In January 2024, the French government proposed offering complimentary fertility tests for 25-year-olds as part of routine health checkups to address rising infertility rates and declining birth rates. Additionally, in June 2023, France passed a law allowing single women and same-sex couples to access IVF and other fertility treatments. This reform, which received widespread public support, enables women to pursue fertility care without the need for a male partner, making fertility services more inclusive in the country.\nAsia-Pacific is anticipated to grow at the fastest rate in the fertility market during the forecast period. The increasing demand for fertility treatments is due to postponed childbearing, shifts in lifestyle, and the rising incidence of infertility problems. Improvements in assisted reproductive technologies (ART), including ICSI, PGT, and IVF, have increased the accessibility and effectiveness of fertility treatments. In the Asia Pacific area, governmental financial aid and subsidies are assisting in making these treatments more economical for couples. Heightened awareness of reproductive health matters and the reduction of stigma surrounding infertility have resulted in more individuals looking for assistance. Furthermore, numerous nations are revising their ART regulations to ensure treatments are more accessible and inclusive for a broader variety of people.\nThe National Health Commission has published guidelines aimed at enhancing fertility rates in China, with continuous talks about increasing access to fertility services for single women. These efforts are anticipated to further boost demand in China\u2019s expanding fertility services market. In June 2023, Beijing declared that beginning July 1, 16 categories of assisted reproductive technologies would be included in its healthcare system. This initiative seeks to address China\u2019s falling birth rate, which fell to a historic low of 6.77 births for every 1,000 individuals last year. The treatments that are covered consist of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo transfer.\nThe expansion of the market is influenced by various crucial elements, such as improvements in assisted reproductive technologies, the emergence of fertility tourism, enhanced government backing, and heightened awareness of fertility therapies. Moreover, there is an increasing acceptance of IVF as a practical choice for couples seeking to conceive, along with the rising incidence of infertility cases. In February 2024, the Maharashtra government declared that it would provide free IVF treatments at certain government hospitals, a service that usually costs more than \u20b92 lakh in private facilities. This program seeks to address infertility issues throughout the state, ensuring that IVF is available to numerous couples, including those living in rural communities. This action aims to instill hope in infertile couples by offering cutting-edge fertility treatments for free, irrespective of their financial circumstances.\nIn 2023, North America comprised a substantial portion of the fertility services market, ranking as the notable area by market size. The area provides key players for major participants, fueled by elements like a significant population, heightened understanding of fertility therapies, the rising appeal of IVF, increasing infertility statistics, and the tendency towards postponed pregnancies. Moreover, North America has experienced significant investments and technological progress in fertility services, which has further driven market expansion.\nThe U.S. dominates the market, bolstered by government programs. In April 2023, the federal government introduced a benefits program for its employees, providing a median lifetime benefit of $20,000 for fertility treatments. Employees have the option to choose plans that provide coverage for a range of fertility services, offering up to $25,000 each year for IVF and up to three artificial insemination cycles annually, thus enhancing access to fertility treatments.\nThe worldwide fertility services market has experienced significant growth lately, driven by developments in medical technology, changing social norms, and increased awareness of infertility issues. Fertility services encompass a wide array of treatments, including basic assessments and counseling, as well as more complex procedures such as IVF and genetic testing. Infertility has emerged as a major public health issue worldwide, impacting roughly 15% of couples. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that infertility rates are increasing because of factors like lifestyle decisions, postponed marriage, environmental factors, and health issues.\nIn January 2025, according to Gameto co-founder Dina Radenkovic, Fertilo offers families a potentially quicker, safer, and more affordable option by addressing the main drawbacks of traditional IVF, including protracted treatment cycles, serious side effects, and mental and physical strain. In addition to highlighting the first use of iPSC technology in IVF and the enormous potential of our technique, this milestone represents a turning point in reproductive health.\nBy Offering\nBy End-user\nBy Region\nJuly 2025\nJuly 2025\nJuly 2025\nJuly 2025"
