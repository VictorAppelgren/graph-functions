      "feedback": "Your draft mixes multiple assets (ust10y, spx, tech earnings) and omits explicit causal links to the canonical handles required by the acceptance gate. Tighten the focus to a single handle—preferably ust10y for rate‑driven moves—by re‑phrasing each line to start with the handle, then the driver, and ending with a concrete catalyst window. For example, rewrite “Fed rate cut” as “ust10y | Sep 16‑17 2025 | Fed rate cut (3YAQ8JUPL) | Fed minutes, NFP, CPI (97MD1FHW8) | 70%” and similarly for the spread steepening, sticky inflation, and concentration risk, ensuring each has a clear transmission path (Fed → ust10y → equity risk premium → spx). Add explicit magnitude ranges (e.g., ust10y 4.10‑4.20 %) and probability brackets derived from the cited sources. Remove any mention of “tech earnings” unless you map it to a handle like spx and provide a causal chain (e.g., spx → tech earnings → equity risk premium). Ensure every line contains at least one dated catalyst window and a single canonical handle with sign and magnitude. This will satisfy the acceptance gate and produce a concise, actionable 4‑line output.",
