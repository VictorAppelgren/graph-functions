      "feedback": "The draft is too broad, unfocused, and verbose for a 4‑6‑sentence investor brief. Tighten it by (1) grouping the narrative into three core pillars—Fed policy, AI/tech valuation, and sector‑specific catalysts (Netflix, Ford, Japanese banks)—and summarizing each pillar in a single, data‑driven sentence; (2) replace generic “Fed dovishness” with the 85 % probability of a 25‑bp cut (OGK8WLL69) and the 1.5 % S&P rally (T7HLAX8QN); (3) quantify AI upside by citing Nvidia’s 3.5 % pre‑MIT‑study surge and the 3‑5 % pullback (MSPXAOHU8); (4) for Netflix, state the 15.9 % YoY revenue lift, 86.9 % FCF jump, and the 51.7× P/E that could compress to 35–40× if the $18 bn spend normalizes (61SVFUKBY, A88B7V8PY); (5) for Ford, highlight the 4.3 % margin, 10.1 % ROIC, 10.3× forward P/E, and the $1.3 bn EV loss (W2622L6WW); (6) for Japanese banks, quantify overseas push by Mizuho’s $489 bn assets and MUFG’s 120.7 trn yen (PA57YBYVQ) and note the risk of low domestic growth; (7) trim redundant citations, keep only those directly supporting a numeric claim; (8) replace filler “key risks” with a concise bullet list of top three risks (Fed tightening, AI market correction, oil price spike >$70) and watch signals (Fed minutes, Nvidia Q2, Brent, Netflix Q3). The result should be a crisp, 5‑sentence executive summary that meets the 4–6‑sentence constraint and delivers clear catalysts, risks, and watch items.",
