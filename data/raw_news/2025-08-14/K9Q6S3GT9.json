  "title": "Bluesky rolls out massive revamp to policies and Community Guidelines",
  "description": "Bluesky is updating its rules.",
  "content": "Two years after launching, social network Bluesky is revising its Community Guidelines and other policies, and asking for feedback from its users on some of the changes. The startup, a competitor to X, Threads, and open networks like Mastodon, says its new policies are meant to offer improved clarity and more detail around its user safety procedures and the appeals process.\n\nMany of the changes are being driven by new global regulations, including the UK Online Safety Act (OSA), the EU Digital Services Act (DSA), and the US TAKE IT DOWN Act.\n\nSome of the changes represent an effort by Bluesky to purposefully shape its community and the behavior of its users, nudging them to be nicer and more respectful of others. This comes after a series of complaints and media articles suggesting the community has a tendency towards self-seriousness, bad-news sharing, and a lack of humor and diversity of thought.\n\nFor regulatory compliance, Bluesky\u2019s Terms of Service have been updated to comply with online safety laws and regulations, and to require age assurance where required. For instance, in July, the UK\u2019s Online Safety Act began requiring that platforms with adult content to implement age verification, which means Bluesky users in the country have to either scan their face, upload their ID, or enter a payment card to use the site.\n\nThe process for complaints and appeals is also now more detailed.\n\nOne notable update references an \u201cinformal dispute resolution process,\u201d where Bluesky agrees to talk on the phone with a user about their dispute before any formal dispute process takes place. \u201cWe think most disputes can be resolved informally,\u201d Bluesky notes.\n\nThat\u2019s quite different from what\u2019s taking place at larger social networks, like Facebook and Instagram, where users are being banned without any understanding of what they did wrong and no way to get in touch with the company to complain.\n\nBluesky also says it will allow users to resolve certain claims of harm in court, instead of through arbitration. This is also somewhat unusual for tech companies that often prefer to mediate disputes outside the courts.\n\nHowever, Bluesky users may be more interested in the proposed changes to the Community Guidelines, which they\u2019re invited to offer feedback about. (The changes go into effect Oct. 15, 2025 after the feedback period completes).\n\nThese revised guidelines are organized around four principles: Safety First, Respect Others, Be Authentic, and Follow the Rules. These general principles are meant to guide Bluesky\u2019s moderation decisions around whether content should be labeled or removed, if the company can suspend or ban your account, or, in some cases, report you to law enforcement.\n\nBluesky\u2019s rules include many common-sense policies around not promoting violence or harm (including self-harm and animal abuse), not posting content that\u2019s illegal, that which sexualizes minors (including in roleplay), and disallowing harmful actions like doxxing and other non-consensual personal data-sharing, or posting spam or malicious content, among other things.\n\nIt carves out provisions for journalism, parody, and satire. For instance, journalists engaged in \u201cfactual reporting\u201d can post about criminal acts and violence, mental health, online safety, and other topics, like warnings of online viral challenges that may be harmful.\n\nWhere Bluesky may get into trouble is with the nuances of what\u2019s considered a \u201cthreat,\u201d \u201charm,\u201d or \u201cabuse.\u201d\n\nThe policy states that users should \u201crespect others\u201d by not posting, promoting, or encouraging \u201chate, harassment, or bullying.\u201d As an example, the policy bans exploitive deepfakes and content that \u201cincites discrimination or hatred,\u201d meaning posts that attack individuals or groups based on \u201crace, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or other protected traits.\u201d\n\nThis is an area where Bluesky has faltered before, when, in earlier days, its moderation decisions strained its relationship with the Black community, and, in another case, when its failure to moderate angered the trans community.\n\nMore recently, the company has been facing backlash that it\u2019s become too left-leaning, where users were quick to criticize, post hateful replies, and where the community generally lacked humor.\n\nThe original idea behind Bluesky was to provide users with tools to create the community they want, including not only blocking and reporting tools, but others, like subscribable block lists or opt-in moderation services that align with your values. However, Bluesky users have still shown a preference for the app itself to handle much of the moderation, railing against its trust and safety department when it made decisions they disagreed with.\n\nIn addition, Bluesky\u2019s Privacy Policy and Copyright Policy were also rewritten to comply with global laws around user rights, data transfer, retention and deletion, takedown procedures, transparency reporting, and more. These both go into effect on September 15, 2025, and there is no feedback period for either.",

If we do, you agree to fully cooperate with our defense of the claim.\n12. Limitation of Liability\nSummary: Bluesky isn\u2019t responsible for any problems caused by other people\u2019s posts or third-party claims. If something goes wrong, Bluesky\u2019s responsibility is limited to $100\u2014unless Bluesky did something really bad, like broke the law or acted on purpose to hurt someone.\nExcluded Damages. To the fullest extent permitted by law, and except for claims covered under the Exceptions to Exclusion below, Bluesky and its affiliates will not be liable for:\nIndirect, special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages\u2014such as lost profits, business interruption, or loss of data;\nCosts for substitute services;\nAny third-party claims, including those arising from User Content.\nAll third-party claims are expressly excluded from Bluesky's liability, regardless of cause or theory of liability.\nExceptions to Exclusion. The exclusions in this Section do not apply to claims of death or personal injury based on:\nBluesky's fraud or criminal misconduct;\nGross negligence or willful misconduct by Bluesky;\nViolations of statutory rights that cannot be contractually disclaimed under applicable law.\nMonetary Cap. Except for claims falling within the Exceptions to Exclusion, Bluesky's total cumulative liability for all claims arising out of or related to these Terms\u2014whether in contract, tort, statute, or otherwise\u2014is limited to one hundred U.S. dollars (US$100).\nScope & Legal Validity. These limitations apply to the maximum extent allowed by law. If any jurisdiction limits or prohibits certain exclusions or limitations, those exclusions or limitations will apply to the extent allowed, and the remainder of this Section will remain enforceable.\n13. Governing Law, Jurisdiction, Venue, Dispute Resolution, and Arbitration\nSummary: If there's a problem, email us and we'll try to fix it. If that doesn't work, most issues have to go to private arbitration, not court\u2014unless it's about a safety issue like an injury. You can't join a group lawsuit against Bluesky unless we say it's okay. These rules still apply if you delete your account.\nGoverning Law and Jurisdiction. These Terms and any disputes or claims arising out of or relating to them (including non-contractual disputes) are governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law principles.\nJurisdiction and Venue. Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, any legal action that is not subject to arbitration must be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Delaware. You and Bluesky consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in those courts and waive any objections based on forum or convenience.\nMandatory Local Law Exception. If you reside in a jurisdiction that requires the application of its own local laws, courts, or other mandatory procedures for non-arbitral disputes\u2014such as Brazil\u2014then those mandatory provisions will apply instead of the Delaware governing law and venue provisions in this Section, but only to the extent required by applicable law.\nDispute Resolution and Arbitration.\nInformal Resolution. Most disputes can be resolved informally. If you have an issue with the services, you agree to contact us first and allow us at least 60 days to resolve the dispute before initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. You can do this by contacting us atsupport@bsky.app. In order for your informal resolution request to be valid and for us to respond, you must provide us with: your name, your email address, a statement that you are invoking the pre-arbitration informal dispute resolution process, the jurisdiction where you live (city and state, province, or county), your account handle, the specific amount of damages and/or other relief you are seeking, all supporting evidence in your possession that will help us resolve the dispute, links to or descriptions of the location of any evidence you know of but do not possess that will help us resolve the dispute, and whether you intend to pursue arbitration if we cannot resolve your dispute informally and, if so, what your claim will be in arbitration.\nYou agree that after you submit your informal resolution request, you will participate with us via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to resolve the dispute informally. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference, but we will have a company representative fully participate in the conference.\nThe statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process required by this paragraph. You agree that participating in the informal dispute resolution process described in this paragraph is a necessary pre-condition to filing an arbitration demand.\nMandatory, Mutual Arbitration of Disputes. If the Informal Resolution process listed above does not resolve your dispute, you agree that, subject only to the below carve-out and to the maximum extent permitted by local laws, you will resolve any dispute, disagreement, or claim relating to these Terms through final and binding arbitration by AAA (U.S.) or ICDR (UK/EU), seated in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we agree to a different location. Both parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement. Each party shall select one arbitrator; the pair appoint a third.\nThe AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. To start arbitration, submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to Bluesky as specified in the AAA Rules.\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. If we prevail in arbitration we'll pay all of our attorneys' fees and costs and won't seek to recover them from you, unless the arbitrator determines your claims were frivolous. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.\nCarve-Out for Safety Claims. Arbitration does not apply to claims that fraud, criminal misconduct, or gross negligence by Bluesky caused death or personal injury. Those matters may be brought in court or arbitration, at the claimant's choice, subject to these Terms.\nWaiver of Class Actions. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND BLUESKY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF, CLASS MEMBER, OR REPRESENTATIVE IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nIf any part of this Waiver of Representative Actions is found to be unenforceable, Section 13.D (\"Dispute Resolution and Arbitration\") shall be deemed void in its entirety.\nNothing in this section shall prohibit the AAA's consolidation of the administration of multiple claims pursuant to the AAA Rules.\nBluesky's Discretion to Consolidate. Notwithstanding the foregoing waiver, Bluesky may, at its sole discretion, elect to consolidate multiple arbitrations involving similar issues or claimants into a single consolidated arbitration or class-arbitration-like proceeding. Any such consolidation will occur only under the applicable AAA rules.\nSmall Claims and Injunctive Relief. This clause, \"Dispute Resolution and Arbitration,\" does not restrict you from bringing eligible claims in small claims court. It also does not waive your statutory rights under the law of your country of residence.\nTo the extent that you or we prevail on a claim in arbitration and seek public injunctive relief (injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.\nSurvival. This Section survives account Termination.\n14. Updates to Terms\nWe may update these Terms periodically. We will always post the revised version here and we will notify you through the App, website, or other communication channel if we make any material changes.\nIt\u2019s your responsibility to review the Terms regularly.

      "text": "Amy Brown was not screaming. She was not crying. She was not throwing up.\nBut on Bluesky she said that she was doing all three, simultaneously. Brown\u2019s husband visited a Walgreens while he was on a business trip in Ohio in February. He told her the prices were cheaper than in California, where they live.\nThe price disparity led her to post that she was screaming, crying, and throwing up. Several Bluesky users responded to tell her she was exaggerating, and that nobody could possibly care that much. They were right. She didn\u2019t. She was referencing one of the internet\u2019s common sayings, one used so often that it\u2019s the name of a Spotify compilation.\nWhat Brown experienced is familiar to any former Twitter/X user gathering their bearings on the young and decidedly more earnest social network Bluesky: a distinct humor-detection issue. Some users are unable to decipher jokes, or they are deliberately trying to miss the point to make a different one. Many Bluesky users migrated over from X, where the top DOGE who did Nazi-like salutes on television is live-tweeting the destruction of American infrastructure. That\u2019s a different and much more serious problem. Still, the seeming obliviousness-slash-self-seriousness of many Bluesky users is grating when you\u2019re not used to it.\n\u201cThey're speaking a completely different language than me,\u201d Brown says. \u201cWe're both speaking English, but I'm speaking internet.\u201d\nBrown, a former social media manager for Wendy\u2019s, joined Bluesky in 2023. Her X account was banned after she impersonated Elon Musk for almost two hours on November 4, 2022.\nThe \u201cincident,\u201d as she calls it, happened shortly after X announced paid verification. Brown changed her profile picture to one of a balding entrepreneur and edited her display name to \u201cElon Musk (real).\u201d She convincingly emulated his voice, posting musings like \u201cmy wife left me lol\u201d and \u201cmy penis is NOT weird.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t know whether she\u2019d be banned for her behavior on X, but she was OK with the possibility. \u201cIt's like, Elon's already the main character on this platform every day, and now he owns it. Do I really want to be here anymore?\u201d she says.\nWhile you can still find plenty of this kind of humor on Bluesky, there are a surprising number of people genuinely confused by it. There are several factors to blame here.\nFirst is the clash between former users of X and Facebook. Anyone who logged their time on the Everything App is familiar with the language of Twitter: posts steeped in irony, in-group references, platform-specific history. When they left X, they brought all that wisecracking, insidery drollery with them. They even brought their pig-shitting-on-its-own-testicles JPEGs.\nMeanwhile, former power users of Facebook, Instagram, and Threads are accustomed to their own barometers of funny. While Twitter felt like an intentional way to primarily interact with mostly strangers, and a familiar face might cause the user a moment of horror, Facebook was the opposite\u2014at least initially, before it became Click FarmVille for engagement bait and advertisements for oddly specific custom novelty tees.\nBluesky also got a big boost in users from mainstream television: MSNBC ran multiple segments about the social network, including bumps on Morning Joe, The Weekend, All In With Chris Hayes, and The Rachel Maddow Show. Regular MSNBC viewers who took the plunge might not be as familiar with the tenor and style of online conversation on the smart-ass social web.\nThe lack of humor detection is made worse by tech: algorithmically curated content, \u00e0 la Bluesky\u2019s Discover feed, surfaces random posts to random people. A Maddow referral on Bluesky might see an ex-Twitter user\u2019s vivid description of what they\u2019d do to the Hamburglar if they saw him in person and react with genuine horror and confusion. It\u2019s also PEBKAC issue\u2014problem exists between keyboard and chair. You cannot force a person to understand a joke. The only action more futile is to get mad about it.\nIf these disparate groups have anything in common, it\u2019s disgust with gigantic tech companies led by unpalatable CEOs, paired with a yearning to post in the lingua franca of their previously beloved platforms. Everyone\u2019s brains are broken in different ways. I empathize with those who don\u2019t get the joke. But I empathize more with the people trying to make them.\nTo paraphrase an Axios story from last year, America is in the midst of a gullibility crisis. People can\u2019t tell what\u2019s AI, a manipulated screenshot, a joke, or a lie. Many of us have opened up our relationship with reality. And the political climate has exacerbated the issue, according to Josh Gondelman, a comedian who previously worked as a producer and writer on Desus & Mero and wrote for Last Week Tonight With John Oliver.\n\u201cSince Trump\u2019s run for the presidency, there has been a rapidly accelerating not-getting-jokes on the internet,\u201d Gondelman says.\nBy Gondelman\u2019s recollection, Bluesky hit a point where it was populated enough with active users to be both fun and useful at some point within the past six months. \u201cBut that also means it hit the tipping point where it\u2019s populated enough to be annoying,\u201d he says, laughing.\nMattie Lubchansky, an Ignatz Award\u2013winning cartoonist, author, and illustrator, describes herself as \u201ca primarily joke-posting kind of person.\u201d The humor-detection issue of Bluesky is part of a broader phenomenon she has observed, which she calls \u201criff collapse.\u201d\nThe day after the 2025 Oscars, Lubchansky posted: \u201ci haven't seen any of the oscar movies this year, nor have i seen any movie ever made. i'm afraid that the people trapped inside the screen will be angry at me for not helping them escape; and once they are out i will be punished. anyway, here's how the awards validated an opinion i already had.\u201d\nThe replies that followed were earnest opinions and arguments about Oscar-nominated films. Some people asked for movie recommendations. Some unironically recommended she check out The Purple Rose of Cairo. Only a handful of people seem to have understood that she was joking. Lubchansky says she sees this type of \u201criff collapse\u201d happen daily, and she thinks it\u2019s because of the influx of new users from Meta and X.\nBut the frustrations around new social platforms isn\u2019t new. Networks will continue to pop up, ideally, and longtime users will continue to be annoyed by newbies.\nIn the early-to-mid-1990s, people often first accessed the internet when they arrived at college. Around September of every year, a bunch of new users would log on to their university\u2019s network and start poking around the forums and discussion groups.\n\u201cThe internet old timers would be very frustrated, because the new people didn\u2019t know the social norms,\u201d says technologist, writer, and former WIRED contributor Anil Dash. \u201cExactly the phenomenon we\u2019re seeing right now.\u201d September, for the most online netizens, was a dreaded time of the year. AOL opened the floodgates, allowing anyone to access the internet at any time. AOL\u2019s bloom coincided with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which deregulated the telco industry and brought internet connectivity to homes and institutions across the US.\nThis period was called the Eternal September, with \u201cwave after wave of newbies getting online,\u201d Dash says.\nThe pattern has repeated itself with LiveJournal and even Twitter. Actor and investor Ashton Kutcher appeared on CNN in 2009 and challenged the network to see whose account could hit 1 million Twitter followers first. (Kutcher won.) The stunt led to a rush of users flooding the microblogging platform.\nLubchansky thinks this moment presents an opportunity for people to examine their reply etiquette.\n\u201cRead the whole post before you respond. Take a moment to respond. And if you're going to respond with a joke, and we're not friends already, go look and see if somebody's made it already,\u201d Lubchansky says. \u201cBecause there's a really good chance they have.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Brown considers the block function on Bluesky to be a favor to its recipient.\n\u201cIf someone comes into my comments and they just really, really don't understand, usually I just block them so we don't run into each other again,\u201d she says. \u201cNo hard feelings.\u201d It\u2019s a different approach than the norm on X, where quote-tweets viciously insulting the original post are part of the platform\u2019s noxious fabric.\n\u201cI'm not trying to repeat the part of Twitter where the internet makes me mad every day,\u201d Brown says.\nSatirical site The Onion has the fifth largest Bluesky account, with over 1.2 million followers. Onion CEO Ben Collins doesn\u2019t mind people replying to jokes in earnest. On the contrary, he says it\u2019s \u201cthe funniest part of the internet.\u201d\n\u201cIt means more people are seeing your jokes,\u201d he says. \u201cIf everyone is immediately breaking out into uproarious applause at your joke, your audience is too small.\u201d\nAs someone who regularly used and posted on Twitter for years, I share the frustration when one of my jokey posts is misread or taken as fact. But it also strikes me as unfair to shame someone because they haven\u2019t been slamming their head on the same wall of the internet that I have.\nNot everyone crawled here from the radioactive sewer of X dot com. As we all get settled along with our new neighbors, it might be helpful to remember that. If not, at least Bluesky has very robust blocking features."

      "text": "Bluesky, the decentralized social network and frontrunner alternative to Twitter, has been hailed as a wonderland of funny posts and good vibes. But a moderation policy change that followed a death threat against a Black user has many on Bluesky questioning if the platform is safe for marginalized communities after all.\nBluesky had around 50,000 users by the end of April. Its users have doubled since then, and as it gains more, it also faces increased pressure to crack down on hate speech and other violent comments. As a soon to be federated platform, Bluesky is at a turning point that could set the precedent for moderating decentralized social networks. Though robust moderation wasn\u2019t one of Bluesky\u2019s founding principles, many users expect the site to be more proactive in refusing platform bigotry \u2014 even if it conflicts with Bluesky\u2019s decentralized goals.\nBluesky has not announced a specific timeline for federation. In a May 5 blog post, the Bluesky team said it plans to launch a \u201csandbox environment\u201d to begin the testing phase of federation \u201csoon.\u201d\nIt started in the hellthread last month. The thread, which initially formed when a coding bug notified every single user in the thread every time another user responded to it, grew into a chaotic, seemingly infinite discussion board with countless subthreads. Initially a shitposting outlet, the thread has devolved into a hotbed of discourse \u2014 opening the door for rampant racism.\nAveta, a software engineer who has invited hundreds of Black users to Bluesky in hopes of recreating Black Twitter, replied in the thread asking people to stop posting R. Kelly memes. Aveta is well known on Bluesky for expanding the Black community on the platform, and is an outspoken advocate for acknowledging Black influence on internet culture.\nLast month, she had a dispute with Alice, a Bluesky user who went by cererean, over comments that Alice made about the growing Black community. Alice made multiple racist posts in the past month, including one that said that Black users are welcome to create their own spaces if they don\u2019t want to be somewhere that \u201creflects the demographics of the Anglosphere.\u201d\nIn response to another comment about Aveta\u2019s hellthread interactions, Alice suggested that Aveta get shoved off \u201csomewhere real high.\u201d Aveta, who declined to comment out of fear of harassment, described Alice\u2019s comment as a death threat in posts on Bluesky.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $600+ before prices rise.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nOther users reported Alice\u2019s comment as a violation of Bluesky\u2019s policy prohibiting extreme violence. Bluesky\u2019s moderation team did not initially ban Alice, and invoked further outrage among users when Bluesky CEO Jay Graber announced a change in the platform\u2019s policies that appeared to excuse comments like Alice\u2019s.\n\u201cWe do not condone death threats and will continue to remove accounts when we believe their posts represent targeted harassment or a credible threat of violence. But not all heated language crosses the line into a death threat,\u201d Graber said in a weekend thread. \u201cWisely or not, many people use violent imagery when they\u2019re arguing or venting. We debated whether a \u201cdeath threat\u201d needs to be specific and direct in order to cause harm, and what it would mean for people\u2019s ability to engage in heated discussions on Bluesky if we prohibited this kind of speech.\u201d\nUnder Bluesky\u2019s new policy, any post that threatens violence or physical harm \u2014 whether literal or metaphorical \u2014 will result in a temporary account suspension. Repeat offenders will be banned from Bluesky\u2019s server, but once Bluesky finishes the \u201cwork required for federation,\u201d Graber said, users will be able to move to a new server with their mutuals and other data intact.\nLike Mastodon, Bluesky aims to be a decentralized, federated social network. It isn\u2019t federated yet, so all users still interact on Bluesky\u2019s server and have to abide by Bluesky\u2019s policies. Once it is federated, any users on any server on AT Protocol will be able to \u201copt in\u201d to a community labeling system that would include certain content filters.\nThat means that under Bluesky\u2019s new content moderation policy, a user who was suspended for hate speech or making violent threats would still be able to engage with other servers running on AT Protocol. Bluesky has always been transparent about becoming a decentralized social network, but the swift action it previously took against users who threatened others convinced many Bluesky early adopters that the platform would continue to shut down violent or hateful rhetoric.\n\u201cWhile this may not be your vision necessarily, I think a lot of people are less concerned with moving to a new instance of Bluesky, than making sure bigots are not able to have *any* instance on here,\u201d Ben Perry, a Bluesky user also known as tedcruznipples, replied to Graber\u2019s thread. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be given the opportunity to have federation and proliferate their message.\u201d\nBluesky rolled out custom algorithms the day after Graber announced the new moderation policy. The feature allows users to choose from Bluesky\u2019s \u201cmarketplace of algorithms\u201d instead of just seeing content from the \u201cmaster algorithm\u201d that most social media sites employ. Like Twitter lists, users will be able to toggle between the \u201cWhat\u2019s hot\u201d tab, a tab of people they follow and tabs for custom feeds they\u2019ve pinned. The \u201cCat Pics\u201d feed shows, predictably, cat pics, while other feeds lean more toward memes and NSFW content.\nBut many Bluesky users \u2014 particularly Black Bluesky users \u2014 questioned the timing of the roll out. Rudy Fraser, who created a custom algorithm for Black users called Blacksky, said it was unfortunate that Bluesky tried to offer custom algorithms as a \u201csolution\u201d to the moderation debate.\n\u201cAs if a new feature would resolve the underlying issue and as if they couldn\u2019t just ban the offending user,\u201d Fraser said. \u201cSome form of programmable moderation is on the horizon, but there\u2019s not yet a prototype to see how it would work\u2026 There are already ways around the NSFW tags for example. They need to find those bugs before they reach critical mass.\u201d\nModerating decentralized social networks is a challenge that by definition offers no easy solutions. In the case of Bluesky, establishing and enforcing centralized community guidelines for all users seems antithetical to Bluesky\u2019s aspirational system of federation and customizable moderation. On Mastodon, moderation is unique to each server, and one server\u2019s policies can\u2019t be enforced on another server with a different set of rules. To be listed under Mastodon\u2019s server picker, servers must commit to the Mastodon Server Covenant, which requires \u201cactive moderation against racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia.\u201d While most prominent servers abide by the Covenant, unlisted servers aren\u2019t held to a minimum standard of moderation.\nThe fediverse, a portmanteau of \u201cfederated universe,\u201d promises a vast social network that can exist beyond the authority of a single institution. Though there are benefits to that level of independence, the approach to community-led moderation is often optimistic at best, and negligent at worst. Platforms can absolve themselves of the burden of moderation \u2014 which is labor intensive, costly and always divisive \u2014 by letting users take the wheel instead.\nAllowing communities to moderate themselves also allows violent hate to go unchecked. In a recent skeet, software developer Dare Obasanjo pointed out that many \u201ctechno-optimistic\u201d approaches to content moderation fail to account for context.\n\u201cA user with a virulent racist history wishing harm on a BIPOC is different from the same comment in a debate about MCU versus DCEU movies from otherwise well behaved users,\u201d Obasanjo wrote. \u201cA legalistic discussion of whether \u2018someone should push you off of a tall building\u2019 is a ban worthy offense misses the point completely. The question is whether you tolerate openly racist people wishing harm on BIPOC on your app or not?\u201d\nBluesky employs automated filtering to weed out illegal content and do a first pass of labeling \u201cobjectionable material,\u201d as described in a blog post about the platform\u2019s composable moderation. Then, Bluesky applies server-level filters that allow users to hide, warn, or show content that may be explicit or offensive. Bluesky plans to let users opt-in to certain filters to further customize their individual feeds. The ACLU, for example, can label certain accounts and posts as \u201chate-speech.\u201d Other users will be able to subscribe to the ACLU\u2019s content filter to mute content.\nGraber wrote that the layered, customizable moderation system aims to \u201cprioritize user safety while giving people more control.\u201d The company hasn\u2019t publicly clarified whether or not it plans to hire human moderators as well.\nModeration in Bluesky\u2019s early days has been met with mixed reception from users. In April, Bluesky banned a user who went by Hannah for responding to Matt Yglesias with, \u201cWE ARE GOING TO BEAT YOU WITH HAMMERS.\u201d Many Bluesky users protested the ban, and insisted that the user was joking. Days later, Bluesky swiftly banned another account that had harassed other users with transphobic comments.\nHannah\u2019s hammer ban resurfaced on Bluesky in wake of the moderation policy change. Black Bluesky users questioned why the threat against Aveta wasn\u2019t taken as seriously as Hannah\u2019s reply. Mekka Okereke, director of engineering at Google Play, described Hannah\u2019s comment as \u201cmetaphorical and inappropriate,\u201d but pointed out that \u201cpeople just can\u2019t empathize when Black women are the subject.\u201d\n\u201cAnd as I\u2019ve said on here before, \u2018echo chamber\u2019 is a specific term mostly used by right wing news outlets to describe any place that tries to make Black, brown, and LGBTQIA people feel safe,\u201d Okereke said in a post. \u201cAnd the \u2018truth matters\u2019 philosophical pedantism only seems to come out when we\u2019re talking about making Black women feel safe online.\u201d\nPariss Athena, who founded the job board Black Tech Pipeline, conceded that no online space is truly safe, but pointed out that direct racism, transphobia and anti-Blackness are \u201cnot blurred lines.\u201d\n\u201cAccountability and permanent action needs to be taken the way that they are offline,\u201d she wrote in a post. \u201cWhat\u2019s odd is that these things have already happened on Bluesky but it seems to move much slower when it comes to Black ppl.\u201d\nUsers once praised the platform for refusing to harbor hate speech \u2014 a decision that seems hollow to many Black Bluesky users after the most recent moderation policy change. Bluesky set itself apart from Twitter not only for its customizable features, but also for what appeared to be a serious interest in protecting marginalized groups. The recent policy changes, however, leave many doubtful that Bluesky can maintain that safety.\nFraser isn\u2019t sure that Bluesky is ready to be \u201cproper stewards of a safe space for marginalized groups,\u201d but is determined to stay on the platform for the time being.\n\u201cI am genuinely optimistic for the protocol\u2019s potential and hope they will make a clearer effort to build alongside marginalized communities going forward,\u201d Fraser said. \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer in \u2018Nothing about us without us.\u2019\u201d"

      "text": "Bluesky is adding age verification to its platform in the UK as part of efforts to comply with the country\u2019s Online Safety Act. In an update on Thursday, the platform says it will let users verify their age by scanning their face, uploading an ID, or entering a payment card.\nBluesky will perform age verification through Kid Web Services (KWS), an Epic Games-owned tool that developers can use to implement age verification and parental controls on their platforms. If users don\u2019t want to verify their age, or if they\u2019re under 18, they will still be able to have an account with certain features limited. Bluesky will block \u201cadult-appropriate content\u201d and turn off certain features, such as direct messaging.\nThe UK passed the Online Safety Act in 2023, which privacy advocates have warned will \u201clead to a much more censored, locked-down internet for British users.\u201d Another part of the law is coming into force on July 25th, requiring sites and apps containing porn and harmful content to provide \u201chighly effective age assurance.\u201d Platforms that don\u2019t comply with the new rules will face fines of up to \u00a318 million ($24 million) or 10 percent of their worldwide revenue, whichever is higher.\nOnce the age requirements take effect, Bluesky says it will show a notification to users in the UK asking them to verify their age. Based on the images shared by Bluesky, it looks like UK users will first have to register their email with KWS, which will send them instructions on how to verify their age. \u201cIn addition to these updates, we\u2019ll continue to look at how we\u2019re doing to shield children from unwanted content, and how we can improve,\u201d Bluesky writes in the update."

      "text": "- Billionaire Mark Cuban, who has been an active Bluesky user and supporter for several months now, said this week he thinks the social media platform has gotten \u201cruder and more hateful.\u201d Its liberal-heavy user base makes it challenging to raise questions or have debates with other users, even if their political ideologies align, he said.\nAfter Elon Musk bought Twitter (now X) in late 2022, the vibes on the platform started changing, and many accounts that were verified lost their status. But the mass exodus from X came in late 2024 following the U.S. presidential election and Musk throwing his support\u2014and millions\u2014behind Donald Trump.\nBy December 2024, the platform had lost about 2.7 million active Apple and Android users in just two months, with competitor Bluesky absorbing nearly all of those users. Colloquially, it became somewhat of a safe haven for liberal users who wanted to drown out the noise of President Trump\u2019s reelection.\n\u201cIt\u2019s people wanting to just try something new. It\u2019s people finding their community here,\u201d Bluesky CEO Jay Graber told Vox Media\u2019s Peter Kafta in a June 4 podcast. \u201cI think in general it\u2019s both people looking for something and people looking to get away from something.\u201d\nBetween November 2024 and this May, Bluesky grew from about 10 million users to 30 million, according to a Pew Research Center analysis. Many news influencers\u2014people who regularly post about current events on the platform\u2014lean left politically, according to the analysis.\nOne such figure was billionaire Mark Cuban, who supported former Vice President Kamala Harris during her presidential run in 2024, although he didn\u2019t give her a penny for her campaign, he said in October. Cuban became a regular Bluesky user, having posted nearly 2,000 times since November 2024. When he first joined the platform, he famously posted: \u201cHello Less Hateful World.\u201d\nBut Cuban has changed his tune. In a series of posts this week, Cuban argued Bluesky has become too much of an echo chamber, and is sending more users back to X.\n\u201cEngagement went from great convos on many topics, to agree with me or you are a nazi fascist,\u201d Cuban wrote. \u201cWe are forcing posts to X.\u201d\nThe former Shark Tank star and Dallas Mavericks owner also said he thinks Bluesky users have \u201cgrown ruder and more hateful.\u201d\n\u201cEven if you agree with 95% of what a person is saying on a topic, if there is one point that you might call out as being more of a gray area, they will call you a fascist etc.,\u201d said Cuban, whose current net worth is about $8.33 billion, according to Bloomberg.\nBluesky did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\nCuban also re-posted a Washington Post opinion article published Sunday titled \u201cThe Bluesky bubble hurts liberals and their causes.\u201d Author Megan McArdle argued Bluesky\u2019s left-leaning user base segregates it into a political silo. Cuban agreed.\n\u201cThe lack of diversity of thought here is really hurting usage,\u201d Cuban wrote in a separate Bluesky update including the Washington Post article. \u201cThe moderation and block tools on here are so advanced, if you see someone you don\u2019t want to see on here, just block them. Don\u2019t attack them.\u201d\n\u201cThere used to be great give and take discussions on politics and news. Not so much any more,\u201d Cuban added. \u201cDoesn\u2019t have to be this way.\u201d"

      "text": "Instagram users have for weeks complained about a significant increase in accounts being mistakenly banned or suspended. Many suspect, without direct evidence, that the issues may have to do with the use of AI automation.\nReached for comment, Meta has so far not offered an on-record statement.\nAccording to a growing number of social media posts, including on sites like Reddit and X, Instagram users report that their accounts were banned even though they had not violated the company\u2019s terms of service or other policies. In addition, when they submitted an appeal to have their account reviewed, some claimed they received no response.\nOthers pointed out that they have no other way to directly contact a member of Meta\u2019s support team, leaving them at a loss for what to do next.\n\u201cI\u2019ve already submitted multiple appeals, uploaded my ID, and tried reaching out to Meta through all the official channels, but I\u2019ve been completely ignored. It feels like I\u2019m shouting into a void,\u201d wrote one Reddit user (u/Dyrovicious) about having their personal Instagram account banned.\n(We should note that Meta offers Verified account subscriptions for creators and businesses that offer priority access to customer service.)\nThe Instagram Reddit community\u2019s top posts are nearly entirely focused on the ban wave and have been for weeks. On X, users are flooding Instagram\u2019s replies with pleas for the company to do something about the account suspensions or, at the very least, acknowledge the problem publicly. A Change.org petition about the bans now has over 4,000 signatures.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $600+ before prices rise.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nThe situation has gotten so tense that some are now threatening to file a class action lawsuit against Meta over the bans.\nOf course, large internet companies will inevitably encounter a certain number of false positives due to their reliance on automated moderation systems, which occasionally make mistakes. However, an excessive number of bans is something that\u2019s become a more recent focus \u2014 and one where many immediately suspect AI may be at fault.\nFor instance, Pinterest earlier this year was facing a similar problem with mass bans, which saw users complaining that their actions and posts hadn\u2019t violated the company\u2019s policies. One group of users had also threatened legal action over the bans at the time. Pinterest in May finally admitted that the mass bans were a mistake caused by an \u201cinternal error,\u201d but wouldn\u2019t pinpoint the exact cause. The company claimed that the error was not due to AI moderation, though.\nIn Instagram\u2019s case, the issues aren\u2019t just affecting personal use of the app but also people\u2019s livelihoods, as businesses have been caught up in the mass bans.\n\u201cThis is my livelihood, my full-time job. I heavily rely on Instagram for leads,\u201d wrote one Reddit user (u/Paigejust) about their suspension.\n\u201cThis ban has directly affected my business and all of the hard work and branding that I\u2019ve spent countless hours pouring into my business, my gym, and my students,\u201d a gym owner on Reddit (u/CourtShaw) shared.\nWithout access to internal company data, it\u2019s hard from the outside to tell whether recent bans represent an uptick in the number of typical false positives or not. To date, Meta has not publicly acknowledged the issue.\nIn addition, some of the Instagram users affected have reported that they\u2019re being falsely banned for serious offenses, including CSE (child sexual exploitation). They pointed out that this is a career and reputation-ruining accusation, leaving them highly concerned."

But I pushed myself to go to an English-speaking university, and that opened up a door. Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead? Whenever I interview people, I ask about those key moments in somebody\u2019s life where they\u2019ve made career decisions. And I think about companies in the same way\u2014there are these crucible moments that have an enormous bearing on ultimate outcomes.\nRoelof's Sessions\nWhat Sequoia Sees Coming Next\nAs one of the most influential VCs of the modern era, Roelof Botha has seen it all; booms, busts, and billion-dollar breakout bets.

You\u2019ll have until August 28th to submit comments, and then they\u2019ll go into effect on October 15th. You can view our updated Community Guidelines on our Support Page.\nOur Terms of Service have been updated to reflect new legal requirements and give users more control in case of disagreements. Changes include clarifying eligibility and age assurance to comply with new regional regulations, as well as introducing a formal appeals process. We\u2019ve also expanded our dispute resolution section to prioritize informal resolution.\nThe new Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Copyright Policy will go into effect on September 15th. You can view these updated policies on our Support Page.\nBelow is an overview of what\u2019s being updated:\n1. Community Guidelines\nWe believe the best policies are created in partnership with the people they serve. Our draft Guidelines incorporate lessons from our community's growth and feedback, and your input will help us ensure they're ready to support Bluesky's future. We started by creating a draft that we think improves on our current Guidelines. Below are some of the updates we\u2019ve proposed; here is the form to use for feedback.\n- Clearer Structure: Organized around four key principles\u2014Safety First, Respect Others, Be Authentic, and Follow the Rules\u2014with specific examples of allowed and prohibited content under each.\n- Harm Categories Clarified: Updated with more examples, to align with the UK Online Safety Act (OSA), the EU Digital Services Act (DSA), and the US TAKE IT DOWN Act.\n- Enforcement Procedures: Introduced progressive enforcement model and clarified content moderation logic as required by the OSA and DSA.\n- Appeals & Redress: Aligned with the DSA and now includes out-of-court and judicial remedy guidance for EEA users.\n2. Terms of Service (ToS)\n- Eligibility and Age Assurance Section: Updated to clarify compliance with online safety laws and regulations (e.g., US Children's Online Privacy Protection Act [COPPA], OSA, DSA) and to require age assurance where necessary.\n- Moderation and Illegal Content: Added detail on proactive moderation and illegal content responses to comply with the DSA.\n- Complaints and Appeals: Introduced detailed appeals process to comply with the DSA.\n- Dispute process: We have provided users with greater control in the event that we have a disagreement.\n- We\u2019ve added details about using the informal dispute resolution process, including an agreement that we will talk on the phone before proceeding to any formal dispute process. This is because we think most disputes can be resolved informally.\n- We\u2019ve added a specific detail around liability: if a user makes a claim that we did something wrong that caused certain types of harm, they can choose to resolve that claim in court rather than through arbitration.\n- We are giving users a choice when it comes to any dispute we must resolve through arbitration. That means users choose one arbitrator, Bluesky chooses one arbitrator, and those two arbitrators choose a third.\n3. Privacy Policy\n- User Rights: Enhanced transparency around data subject rights under the EU and UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other global privacy laws.\n- International Data Transfers: Updated to explain safeguards used for transfers outside EU and UK.\n- Retention and Deletion: Strengthened clarity on deletion limitations due to decentralized architecture; consistent with DSA and data minimization requirements.\n- Jurisdiction-Specific Sections: Added information that applies to some of our users based on the jurisdiction where they live.\n4. Copyright Policy\n- Streamlined Takedown Procedure: Ensures compliance with US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), DSA, and similar laws.\n- Abusive Reporting Clause: Added mechanisms to deter fraudulent takedown misuse, compliant with the DSA.\n- Transparency Reporting: Aligned with the DSA by clarifying that we will include required information in transparency reports."

      "text": "Now with 25 million users, Bluesky is facing a test that will determine whether or not its platform will still be seen as a safe space and place of refuge from the toxicity of X. In recent days, a large number of users on Bluesky have been urging the company to ban one newcomer for his opinions and works shared both on and off the platform.\nWriter and podcast host Jesse Singal joined Bluesky 12 days ago to the horror of much of the Bluesky community. Singal has been cataloged by GLAAD\u2019s Accountability Project for his writings on transgender issues and other matters. The GLAAD project \u201ccatalogs anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and discriminatory actions of politicians, commentators, organization heads, religious leaders, and legal figures, who have used their platforms, influence, and power to spread misinformation and harm LGBTQ people.\u201d\nHe is now the most blocked user on the social network, and user outrage over his participation on the platform is growing. People are demanding that Bluesky take a stand: It\u2019s either a place that promises it won\u2019t host bad actors, or it\u2019s a place that promises not to inflate the reach of bad actors thanks to its various moderation tools.\nIt cannot be both.\nIn Bluesky\u2019s earlier days, trans users, like many other marginalized groups, and Black and queer users, flocked to the social network from Twitter (now called X) after Elon Musk bought it and began to promote more right-wing and conservative views. Bluesky has many custom tools that allow people to control their own social networking experience, including block lists, layered moderation, custom feeds, custom algorithms, labeling services, and more. This allows users to do things like block groups of users they may not want to interact with \u2014 like MAGA supporters, for instance, who can be found on a dedicated block list.\nMany in the community who escaped Twitter now feel their Bluesky experience is at risk because of Singal\u2019s joining. As a high-profile user, he brings a network of followers with him, which could lead to increased harassment, they say.\nUsers can point to a wide number of Singal\u2019s writings and opinions as points of reference for his bad reputation, but for Bluesky to ban him, he would have to have violated its terms of service and guidelines specifically.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $600+ before prices rise.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nSome Bluesky users say he has done so: He has already engaged in targeted harassment on the platform and has a long history of harassing trans folks, they say, and has shared private medical information without patients\u2019 consent \u2014 a charge Singal disputes.\nA new Change.org petition is circulating arguing Bluesky should simply ban Singal.\nAs of the time of writing, the petition asking Bluesky to enforce its guidelines already has over 18,000 signatures, including one from singer Lizzo.\nBluesky users have also reported Singal\u2019s account en masse, leading the company to ban him, reinstate him, and then label his account intolerant by its moderation service. (That means users can go into their Bluesky settings to turn on or off or set to be warned about posts that fall into this category.)\nBut many Bluesky users don\u2019t want to just moderate and ignore Singal, they want him gone. It\u2019s become a dealbreaker.\nBy keeping him, Bluesky risks harming the community, depleting its goodwill, and losing users, while also sending a signal to others that bad actors and harassers are welcome there.\nBut by banning Singal, Bluesky could come under attack from the next head of the FCC, Brendan Carr, who is ready to come after social networks he believes are suppressing conservative views. Whatever Bluesky does here will attract attention, for better or for worse.\nThis is not the first time Bluesky has faced user backlash over moderation issues. The startup strained its relationship with some Black users after failing to crack down sufficiently on hateful and violent rhetoric last year.\nIn February, the company hired a former Twitter/X Trust & Safety exec, Aaron Rodericks, to lead Bluesky\u2019s efforts and hopefully prevent further problems. Rodericks is now receiving a massive amount of inbound from Bluesky users, asking him to take action on Singal\u2019s account.\nAhead of publication, Bluesky did not return requests for comment. Singal has declined to comment.\nAfter publication, the Bluesky Safety account shared the following statement on the platform:\nIn the past month alone, over 12M people joined Bluesky, with daily active users growing 10x. We received more reports in two days than in all of last year, and have integrated new systems and quadrupled our moderation team to try and keep up. Sometimes, we have to work quickly to correct errors.\nWe recently introduced a new system to detect impersonation. This tool automatically flagged some accounts that were taken down, then reinstated. Other prominent impersonation accounts were quickly removed, contributing to a false perception that we take action based on behavior outside of Bluesky.\nThe current controversies reveal weaknesses in the clarity of our Community Guidelines and failures in our communications. This has led to understandable confusion about how we interpret our guidelines. We need to be more transparent \u2013 without revealing to bad actors how to circumvent our systems.\nOur growing moderation team needs clear evidence and well-defined rules to make decisions that can be consistently enforced, so they action accounts based primarily on content and behavior that appears in our app, where the context and authenticity can be directly verified.\nWe do not currently take action on accounts that share Bluesky screenshots with commentary, unless that commentary violates our Guidelines. We will take action when someone\u2019s private information is shared without their consent, but only when it is personally identifiable and verifiable in-app.\nOur moderation team continues to monitor and review all received reports, and will action accounts based on in-app violations of our Community Guidelines. We want our actions to be clear and consistent, recognizing that we have more work to do to make that happen.\nWe\u2019ve been working on an improved version of our Community Guidelines that provides greater detail and more examples, and plan to release it early next year and solicit feedback from the community. As we grow, we will continue to learn and adjust.\nModeration decisions draw intense public scrutiny from many places. That\u2019s why Bluesky\u2019s architecture is designed to enable communities to control their online spaces, independent of the company or its leadership. We will continue to work on empowering people with more control over their experience.\nWe talked with Singal after publication of this article; he declined to comment. This article was also updated to include Bluesky\u2019s statement after publication and to correct an error."

      "text": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\nFor a different perspective on what\u2019s happening with Bluesky, check out our colleague Luke Winkie\u2019s piece here.\nBluesky\u2019s big breakthrough as an alternative to the Elon Muskified Twitter was seven months ago. It hasn\u2019t lasted. Or, at least, its enormous growth right after Donald Trump\u2019s reelection has not kept up.\nThe site got a surge of new sign-ups almost immediately after the election and, shortly after the inauguration, crossed 30 million accounts. But user growth has slowed, with the site now at about 36.5 million accounts, and it appears that more and more of those accounts are becoming ghosts as users abandon the platform. Unique posters and unique likers of posts have been in steady downward descent for months. Though Bluesky has more users now than after the election, it is a smaller, less active digital community. Bigger than 2023, when it was accessible only via invitation code, but not quite big.\nBoth of us, Alex and Nitish, have made Bluesky our primary microblogging app. Choosing it was a big commitment for two people whose brains are infected with an insatiable appetite to post and read posts. For us, Bluesky has supplanted X. But most people have not made that move, and because they haven\u2019t, they may not be familiar with Bluesky\u2019s favorite topic: Bluesky. For weeks, one of the site\u2019s most popular conversation topics has been why more people aren\u2019t using it. Theories abound, and we think that the most popular one\u2014that Bluesky\u2019s lack of traction has to do with a tilt toward liberal users\u2014misses the point.\nThere\u2019s not one exact answer, but after several hundred hours each (yikes!) scrolling and posting on the platform, we have a few ideas about what\u2019s happening to the most promising X competitor. We\u2019re now prepared to share this conversation with you so that you, too, can enter the arena.\nAlex Kirshner: Nitish! You have been wasting your time primarily on Bluesky, rather than X, for half a year now. How would you say your digital life has changed?\nNitish Pahwa: Alex! It\u2019s certainly been interesting. I\u2019m a longtime Bluesky adopter, going back to the referral-code days, but after I fully quit X postelection, I made it my microblog of choice, especially as more ex-Xers joined. That was a phenomenal surge, and not only did it help to populate the site (my God, those early days were desolate), but it brought so many users with interests beyond niche tech and politics stuff\u2014pop culture, basketball, comedy, etc. We even got a few random but fun celebrities who are still posting, like Flavor Flav and Mina Kimes and even the Portland Trail Blazers.\nThat burst of excitement has settled down a bit, and I\u2019m both nervous and uncertain about what comes next. I\u2019ve found a lot of pure joy on the platform, connected with new folks, and curated lists for myself to make the most of the experience. But Bluesky does feel like the concentration of old #Resistance Twitter, conjoined with a dash of Facebook refugees.\nThat is exactly the cocktail we\u2019re talking about, accounting for a solid majority of everyday users.\nIt can certainly be exhausting; I know people who\u2019ve dropped out after finding that none of their nonpolitics articles or posts ever really take off (much as I\u2019ve tried to help out). And it hasn\u2019t yet become the Live experience that was so essential to old Twitter. Things did get poppin\u2019 during the Jake Paul\u2013Mike Tyson fight, the GNX drop, and the Super Bowl, especially the halftime show. But it\u2019s few and far between, and it\u2019s not yet been enough to distract from the more grating aspects of the feed.\nDo you find yourself missing X, then?\nI don\u2019t, though I have a burner there for moments like the Elon\u2013Trump scrape. (As an aside: It\u2019s also funny to me how people still pretend that X is a bustling town square. We all knew that Twitter was shedding users long before Elon took over! And X is still losing tweeters who aren\u2019t on alternative networks. But anyway.)\nI\u2019ve overall appreciated Bluesky and still think there\u2019s potential here, but I also understand why people have dropped off, and that doesn\u2019t feel great. But I\u2019m curious about your thoughts.\nBluesky has the thing I want most: a nice community of a few thousand people (\u201cmy mutuals\u201d) who riff about sports and TV and seem to want to live in a better world. Plus, it doesn\u2019t have the thing I want least: blue-check-marked accounts replying to links to my Slate stories with: \u201cHmm, Kirshner. Interesting last name. Jew?\u201d These things should be the foundation of a delightful social media experience. But I don\u2019t think they have been, and I\u2019ve been trying to unpack why I often feel madder after scrolling than I ever did on Twitter. Please psychoanalyze me.\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re alone there! Unfortunately, the jokes are far outweighed by the solemnity. My friend Ashwin Rodrigues wrote a sharp piece about this headlined \u201cBluesky Can\u2019t Take a Joke\u201d\u2014the reaction to which, naturally, all but proved his point. It\u2019s not just an honest-to-goodness New York Times reporter telling Chris Hayes that he\u2019s spreading misinfo for re-skeeting(?) a clearly mocked-up NYT screenshot; it\u2019s people who can\u2019t even comprehend why Bluesky should also be a place where people can enjoy themselves, even though American democracy is crumbling, etc.\nSome Bluesky users don\u2019t seem to want that kind of bifurcation. There are periodic viral posts to the effect of \u201cHow are you posting about Andor while American-made bombs fall on Gaza?\u201d Or last week\u2019s viral moments of various Bluesky users telling people that the Trump\u2013Musk meltdown was \u201ca distraction\u201d or that it was misogynistic to joke that \u201cthe girls are fighting.\u201d And those are outlier takes that most users find ridiculous, but I suspect they\u2019ve contributed to a collective bad rep. It\u2019s always this sort of post that I see working its way onto X or Instagram in the context of making fun of Bluesky.\nKen White had a good observation: that critics \u201chave an exaggerated expectation of Twitter alternatives, imposing norms of decorum, civility, productivity, etc. that they absolutely do not impose on Twitter.\u201d\nI do appreciate so many of the people on Bluesky, who help me feel so much less insane these days when it comes to reckoning with Democratic cowardice, A.I. hucksters, and bullshit punditry. But, even though it\u2019s less algorithm-centric than so many other platforms, it falls into the rage-bait trap that comes for all social media. The most engaged users are also the ones likeliest to boost and reshare the same bad news you heard just hours ago, to ask why you\u2019re not weighing in on every little injustice that lands hour after hour, and to repost up a storm of the most depressing shit you\u2019ve ever seen\u2014and they\u2019re also the least likely to converse with you when you just wanna talk about Shoreline Mafia\u2019s return.\nSocial media incentives, man. Elon Musk started literally paying people to post on X, proportional to how often their posts got seen. Bluesky does nothing like that, but because it\u2019s a platform full of people who are either sad, angry, or desperate about the state of the world, the kinds of posts that proliferate around that platform are mostly not fun posts. There\u2019s no Bluesky virality for quote-posting a pic of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and the Jenners at a Knicks game. And I don\u2019t know if a million screenshots of executive orders have made me a better citizen.\nThis weekend was a perfect exhibit of all the crisscrossing tensions we\u2019ve been identifying here. On one hand, you had a decent amount of folks posting about significant cultural events, in sports (the French Open, the NBA Finals) and even theater (the Good Night, and Good Luck livestream, the Tony Awards). But that all ran headlong into the political horrors we saw erupt at the same time, like the militant federal crackdown on the pro-immigrant protesters in L.A., and Israel\u2019s interception of the Madleen aid flotilla. Frankly, I\u2019m not sure any social media\u2014much less an underresourced startup whose leaders prioritize steady operation over far-flung growth\u2014is equipped to handle these clashes of reality right now.\nI wonder how many of us are subliminally expecting that a social media site can do that, if for no other reason than social media is where people spend time and consume news.\nI don\u2019t think that Bluesky can, or should, be the space for the public to actually organize and act against democratic crisis. But when it comes to the basic function\u2014understanding what\u2019s all happening in the world right now\u2014I\u2019d much rather have Bluesky over the alternatives. Christopher Mims, from the Wall Street Journal, made the point over the weekend that \u201con X it\u2019s \u2018LA is burning; deport them all.\u2019 \u201d\nSmug X-ers love to say Bluesky is a bubble that fences off libs from reality, but frankly, we\u2019re now seeing all their skewed misrepresentations of what\u2019s happening in L.A. translating into mainstream coverage! And, look, I can scroll past stupidity on Bluesky , but on X it\u2019s very likely I\u2019m just going to see Substackers raging nonstop over an account full of cherry-picked Bluesky screenshots. Like, the critics of Bluesky would have much stronger points if they \u2026 knew what the platform is actually like, both its strengths and weaknesses?\nMy eyes roll into the back of my head when people, like this Washington Post columnist, assess that Bluesky\u2019s problem is that it\u2019s a liberal bubble that lacks a diversity of views. People fight on Bluesky all the time. They fight with each other over politics. They pick fights with media organizations, including us at Slate. They pick fights with Bluesky\u2019s moderation team, in an old-school Twitter way. The platform has a significant left-of-center bent, and I wouldn\u2019t claim that it\u2019s never hive-minded into a wrong conclusion. But, God, have you ever seen Twitter hive-mind something? It turns out that when groups of people think, sometimes they will groupthink. And unlike X, Bluesky isn\u2019t algorithmically tilting the political discourse in one direction.\nBluesky does have big structural problems related to politics. The same genre of events that drove people to the platform in the first place (eroding norms, human suffering in all its forms, the chance to litigate Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign strategy) is all that many people want to talk about. But my Bluesky experience isn\u2019t lacking because I\u2019m surrounded by liberals and leftists. It\u2019s lacking because there are roughly 14 people there with whom I can bitch about the Pittsburgh Pirates, compared to hundreds on X. (Though it feels, for some reason, as if Bluesky really does adore tennis?) The platform needs more people posting about more things.\nI think what we should care about is that a substantive platform even exists that encourages dialogue over A.I. slop, that encourages people to share their original work, that doesn\u2019t drown out their conversation with unmoderated and arbitrary racism. After Elon\u2019s takeover, X lost all value to me as a journalistic resource\u2014for finding sources and reliable information and for getting my pieces out there. I\u2019m not the only one whose engagement there fell off quite starkly as Musk tweaked the algorithm to downplay tweets with links and boost all the $8 blue-check buyers and their slop instead.\nOutlets as varied as Wired and McSweeney\u2019s have explicitly credited Bluesky with reviving their engagement and audience sources in the post-Twitter, post-Facebook age. I think that should be what the platform leans in to\u2014offering a way for creators to find healthier exposure and routes to audience building again, instead of selling their soul for a video on X that\u2019ll get downranked as soon as you start casting doubt on the reality of \u201cwhite genocide.\u201d\nI mean, let\u2019s be frank: The audience for microblogging and text-based content is smaller than it used to be. But what Bluesky\u2019s very existence has proved is that there is still firm demand for this style of media and that it holds for so many people with all kinds of interests\u2014Rap Twitter, NBA Twitter, Lit Twitter, etc. Honestly, I think the fact that its critics feel the need to shit on it is just proof positive! But, dear God, we need more fun and more shitposters. Let this be my call to all you jokesters out there: Please join us. Let\u2019s talk about Not News and crack esoteric riffs. I\u2019ll boost you every single time, I promise.\nPart of the challenge here is that Twitter, at its best, was like a giant state university. It could be all things to all comers, which was a rare trick, and it was as big or as small as you wanted it to be. It had every student club imaginable. Bluesky is more of a small liberal arts college, and look: Oberlin has its advantages over Ohio State. I bet the dorms are nicer, and not everyone needs to go to a school with a zillion people, many of whom are deranged. (Shoutout to my Ohio State football pals.) But I do think that when some kind of annoying kid from Greek life shows up on the Bluesky quad one day, users there should go out of their way to tell him to bring his friends.\nSpeaking as a state university grad: absolutely."

Bluesky Labeler Guidelines\nLabels help the Bluesky community to control their experience by contributing content classifications.

The less bias you have when applying a label, the more trust that users can have in your labeling service.\n- Be upfront about what you're labeling, why, and how, to help users decide whether to rely on your judgments.\n- Consider proportionate interventions when applying labels. Use a scalpel, not a sledgehammer. In general, it's best to start by labeling content before labeling an entire account.\n- Should you choose manual moderation, accept reports against the labeling parameters you have designed, assign labels, and review appeals in a timely manner.\n- Do not:\n- Use labels in a way that is abusive, harassing, or targeting of specific accounts, groups, or protected characteristics.\n- Design labels that use profanity, spurious allegations, derogatory terms, or harmful tags.\n- Label maliciously (i.e. knowingly mischaracterizing content as harmful or problematic when it plainly does not go against your stated policies or guidelines)\n- Accept compensation for specific labeling actions - or attempt to extort individuals to have labels applied or removed.\n- Claim to represent Bluesky or to show false affiliation with other entities.\n- Deploy labeling services in a way that undermines Bluesky's network stability.\n- Use labeling accounts or services to evade moderation or blocks on your main account, or deploy labels in an attempt to do so.\nViolations of this guidance may result in remediations such as deletion of labels, temporary or permanent suspension of accounts, and steps up to and including disassociating your labeling service from Bluesky Social.\n8. Bluesky Developer Guidelines\nBluesky reserves the right to block the content of any Developer Application on Bluesky Social if the Developer Application does not adhere to the Bluesky Terms. Bluesky further reserves the right to block a Developer Application on Bluesky Social that does not comply with the following rules:\n- Don't spam.

The updates are influenced by global regulations and aim to foster a more respectful community, addressing past criticisms of the platform's culture. Notably, Bluesky is implementing age verification in the UK and introducing a more detailed appeals process for moderation decisions, while also allowing users to resolve certain disputes in court rather than through arbitration.",
