  "title": "Next year\u2019s Siri revamp sounds like it could truly be worth the wait",
  "description": "Apple has several major new Siri upgrades coming that constitute a total revamp, and it sounds like they could truly be worth the wait.",
  "content": "Siri is overdue for some major AI upgrades. They were originally set to arrive earlier this year, but have been pushed into 2026 instead. But according to a recent report, it sounds like they could truly be worth the wait.\n\nSiri is getting a complete overhaul in iOS 26.4, powered by LLMs\n\nIf you follow AI developments very closely, you\u2019ll know that while other tech companies are regularly shipping new advancements, Apple\u2019s AI output has been lacking.\n\nThere are plenty of solid Apple Intelligence features currently available, but Siri has been a pain point.\n\nSiri got a few minor upgrades in iOS 18, but the biggest changes are now expected in iOS 26.4 next spring.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman recently highlighted the potential impact of these changes: \u201cIf Apple nails this, it\u2019s not just a nice ease-of-use upgrade \u2014 it\u2019s the fulfillment of the vision Siri promised nearly 15 years ago.\u201d\n\nTaken together, these upgrades amount to a total overhaul for Siri.\n\nApple will greatly expand not only what Siri can do, but also how it all happens thanks to an LLM-based architecture.\n\nLike we saw at WWDC last year, Siri will be able to take action inside of apps, and across apps, without you ever lifting a finger. Per Gurman, \u201cEssentially, Siri [will] operate your apps like you would \u2014 with precision, inside their own interfaces.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s being described sounds like a truly \u201cnew era\u201d for Siri.\n\nA new era for Siri that\u2019s truly compelling\n\nImagine the intelligence of ChatGPT, but unleashed on all the apps on your iPhone, iPad, Mac, Vision Pro, and more. And with knowledge of how you normally use your devices.\n\nThat\u2019s the new Siri being promised.\n\nThese capabilities certainly expose the heightened importance of user privacy compared to competing AI offerings.\n\nIn fact, the more I consider the scope of what Apple is working on, the more clear it seems that shipping early this year would have been extremely risky.\n\nThere\u2019s tremendous upside if Apple gets this right, but delivering a lackluster system would have been tough to recover from.\n\nSiri\u2019s new capabilities, grounded in the brand new LLM-based architecture, sound like the kind of changes we\u2019ve all been waiting for.\n\nAnd though that wait has been longer than expected, if Apple can deliver what it\u2019s promised, we should be in for quite the upgrade.\n\nHow are you feeling about Apple\u2019s forthcoming Siri upgrades? Let us know in the comments.\n\u2022 AirPods Pro 2 (now only $169, down from $249)",

One of those features is an upgraded version of Siri powered by more advanced large language models, or LLMs. The news was detailed in a new report today from Bloomberg.\n\u2018New Siri\u2019 with iOS 19\nMark Gurman reports that this is being referred to as \u201cLLM Siri\u201d inside Apple. The upgraded assistant is currently being tested as part of a separate app but will replace the current Siri interface when it launches.\nThe report details that while Apple plans to unveil LLM Siri as part of iOS 19 and macOS 16 next year, the new platform won\u2019t actually launch until spring 2026.\nThe revamped Siri will rely on new Apple AI models to interact more like a human and handle tasks in a way that\u2019s closer to ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini. It also will make expanded use of App Intents, which allow for more precise control of third-party apps. And the software will be able to tap into features from Apple Intelligence, such as the ability to write and summarize text.\nAs part of iOS 18.1, Apple debuted a new design for Siri with improvements to Apple product knowledge and better handling of multiple commands, a new Type to Siri feature, and other small upgrades. iOS 18.2 will further upgrade Siri with ChatGPT integration. iOS 18.2 is currently in beta testing and will be released to everyone in December.\nWith iOS 18.3 and beyond next year, Siri will be able to perform app actions and understand your personal context to answer questions.\nApple\u2019s goal is to bring the functionality of ChatGPT in-house as part of this new LLM Siri launching with iOS 19 and emphasize its platform\u2019s user privacy benefits over the competition.\niOS 19 and macOS 16 are expected to be announced at WWDC 2025 next June.\nFollow Chance: Threads, Bluesky, Instagram, and Mastodon.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "According to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, Apple is aiming to ship its brand new App Intents feature, allowing Siri to take actions for you, next Spring \u2013 alongside its long-promised Siri overhaul. These features were initially on track to launch during the iOS 18 release cycle, though Apple faced engineering delays. Now, they should launch by ~iOS 26.4, according to current reporting.\nApple\u2019s Siri delays sure have been disappointing, and Apple likely shouldn\u2019t have announced the features without having a near-final version complete internally \u2013 but nonetheless, Apple made some bold promises for AI. The company offered a vision for an all-new Siri that\u2019d be able to actually do things for you, by taking actions in apps.\nThat\u2019s been a hard promise to deliver on, but according to Gurman, it sounds like Apple is making progress, though they aren\u2019t free of concerns quite yet:\nThe plan now is to ship the feature alongside a broader Siri infrastructure overhaul in the spring and market it heavily. But there\u2019s some concern inside the company, I\u2019m told. Engineers have been struggling to ensure that the system works with a sufficient number of apps and is accurate enough to handle high-stakes scenarios. There are worries about the software failing in categories where precision is nonnegotiable, like in health or banking apps.\nApple is reportedly working with a number of large companies to conduct testing prior to the rollout, to ensure things work properly. From the sounds of things, App Intents won\u2019t be available universally when they finally roll out next spring. The company is even considering \u201csharply limiting what Siri can do \u2014 or excluding those areas altogether\u201d for sensitive categories.\nNonetheless, Apple has a lot banking on these critical Siri promises they made at WWDC24. Hopefully they\u2019ll finally stick the landing. Given Siri\u2019s already awful reputation, it\u2019d be hard to imagine how Apple would recover from its already poor position in the AI race if the new App Intents-infused Siri made a critical mistake that severely impacted someones life.\nSave money with Renewed iPhone deals, tariff free:\n- iPhone 15 (128GB) \u2013 $495 on Amazon\n- iPhone 15 Plus (128GB) \u2013 $544 on Amazon\n- iPhone 15 Pro (128GB) \u2013 $645 on Amazon\n- iPhone 15 Pro Max (256GB) \u2013 $728 on Amazon\nFollow Michael: X/Twitter, Bluesky, Instagram\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "Apple says we\u2019re living in \u2018a new era\u2019 for Siri thanks to Apple Intelligence. Is that true? Sort of. But the answer is a whole lot messier than you might expect, and getting even more so with the latest Mark Gurman report.\nApple\u2019s polarizing iOS 18.1 decision\nLast month when iOS 18.1 arrived, Apple made an interesting decision.\nIt gave Siri with Apple Intelligence a brand new look, but didn\u2019t change its features hardly at all.\nThe \u2018new\u2019 Siri has a beautiful glowing design that makes it look AI-infused.\nBut the AI isn\u2019t really there yet.\nIn iOS 18.1 (on supported Apple Intelligence devices) Siri has gained:\n- new knowledge about Apple products\n- better understanding when you stumble over your words\n- improved context retention between requests\nYou can also now type to Siri by double-tapping the bottom of your display.\nThe start of a new era? Yes, but just barely. And it\u2019s confusing for users.\nComing next for Siri in iOS 18.2 and beyond\nNext month, iOS 18.2 will bring Siri one highly anticipated upgrade: ChatGPT integration.\nSiri will be able to send certain requests it can\u2019t handle to ChatGPT, making Apple\u2019s assistant a lot more useful overall.\nBut importantly, iOS 18.2 also lets you send any request directly to ChatGPT if you\u2019d like. Simply start your Siri request with, \u201cAsk ChatGPT.\u201d\nThen, likely with iOS 18.4 in the spring, Apple is expected to add three more powerful Siri upgrades:\n- personal context awareness to provide more capable assistance related to your data\n- many new in-app actions across Apple and third-party apps\n- knowledge of the content on your screen at any given time\nFinally, Mark Gurman just reported yesterday that there\u2019s a new \u2018LLM Siri\u2019 coming in a version of iOS 19 and macOS 16. We may see it demoed in June at WWDC, but it likely won\u2019t arrive on devices until spring 2026 via a software update.\nWhen Apple announced that its AI features would roll out gradually over the course of the year ahead, many criticized Apple, but I took a more optimistic view. There are all kinds of benefits to Apple Intelligence being a gift that keeps giving.\nBut with Siri specifically, I think the critics have a fair point.\nThe problem of a staggered Siri rollout\nRight now, Siri in iOS 18.1 looks brand new (for AI-compatible iPhones). But in terms of features, it\u2019s barely changed.\nAnd this is a problem because Siri\u2019s usefulness depends entirely on trust. Do you trust that it can do the thing you ask it to do?\nFor many of us, we\u2019ve tried asking Siri things in the past, and it failed. So we gave up ever asking again.\nThe same cycle is set to repeat itself with Siri\u2019s \u2018new era.\u2019\nSince Apple\u2019s opted not to launch one big \u2018new Siri\u2019 at once, but instead a bunch of smaller changes over time, it\u2019s going to be very hard to get users on board with the assistant\u2019s upgrades.\nTop comment by NihilRiv3r\nIt\u2019s one of those frustrating scenarios where it was done poorly but in a few years when Apple intelligence is truly out and is the personal assistant we were promised, nobody will care about the weird initial rollout.\nSiri needs to re-earn users\u2019 trust. And it will have to do that with gradual improvements that most people can\u2019t keep straight on their own.\nIt\u2019s possible Apple\u2019s strategy will succeed, but right now I\u2019m doubtful.\nOne thing\u2019s for sure: it\u2019s going to be a messy season ahead for Siri and its users.\nWhat do you think of Apple\u2019s strategy for Siri? Let us know in the comments.\nBest accessories for iPhone, iPad, and Mac\n- MagSafe Qi2 3-in-1 iPhone charger\n- AirPods Pro 2 (currently just $169, down from $249)\n- 100W USB-C power adapter for fast charging\n- tomtoc laptop/tablet sleeve bag\n- Anker USB-C 8-in-1 hub with Ethernet, HDMI, SD, more\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

The new version, powered by large language models (LLMs), aims to enhance Siri's capabilities, allowing it to perform actions within and across apps with greater precision. This upgrade is seen as a critical step towards fulfilling the original vision of Siri, but concerns remain about its reliability and the gradual rollout of features, which may affect user trust.",
