  "content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. When Dale Earnhardt, the NASCAR champion known as \"The Intimidator,\" died in a crash during the 2001 Daytona 500, the sport lost more than a driver\u2014it lost a symbol of grit, rural pride, and Southern determination. Away from the track, Earnhardt's refuge was hundreds of wooded acres in Mooresville, North Carolina, where he hunted, fished, and spent time far from the roar of an engine. Today, that same land is at the center of a bitter family and community dispute. Teresa Earnhardt, Dale's widow and stepmother to his children, controls the property through Earnhardt Farms LLC. Public records show she owns around 400 acres of what was once her late husband's private escape. Over the years, Teresa became the primary steward of much of Dale's estate, a position that has sometimes caused friction within the family.\n\u2022 The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market \u2014 and you can too at just $2.90/share.\n\u2022 \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share. Now, she's asking the Mooresville Board of Commissioners to rezone the property from residential-agricultural to industrial use. The change would clear the way for Denver-based developer Tract to build the Mooresville Technology Park, a massive data center campus with a projected investment topping $30 billion over the next two decades. That figure includes land preparation, construction, infrastructure, utilities, and technology upgrades. Supporters of the plan point to big economic gains. During a presentation to the board, Tract Senior Director, Entitlements Kristin Dean said the Mooresville Technology Park would create 277 \"recession-resistant\" jobs, 195 of them paying more than $125,000 a year. She also estimated it would \"generate hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue for Mooresville, Iredell County, and local public schools over 20 years.\" Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? But while developers painted a picture of economic windfalls, Kerry Earnhardt, Dale's eldest son, saw something entirely different. In a late-July Facebook post, referring to a Charlotte Observer headline about the meeting that mentioned his father's name, he wrote:\n\n\"My Dad would be livid for his name to be associated in this title! Frankly, I'm ashamed our family name is involved in the request to rezone a community that is thriving as a Rural Residential/Agriculture zone to be changed to Industrial. \"Infrastructures like this don't belong in neighborhoods where people's natural resources will be depleted, wildlife will be uprooted, and the landscape and lives of the people that call this area home will forever be changed. I'd rather see homes built with people loving the land we live on... the way this area was intended to be! \"I look forward to Monday's meeting at the Mooresville Town Hall.\" The post quickly spread among locals opposed to the rezoning, many echoing his concerns about the project's potential to upend the area's character. \"No Data Center\" signs now line rural roads near the property. Residents warn the project could permanently alter the area's character, increase traffic, and damage property values. See Also: In a $34 Trillion Debt Era, The Right AI Could Be Your Financial Advantage \u2014 Get Your Demo Mooresville Mayor Chris Carney shares some of those concerns. He told the Observer it's difficult to support the rezoning without knowing who would operate the facility\u2014whether that's a tech giant such as Apple, Amazon, or Google. He added that if the board were split 3-3, he would likely vote \"no.\" \"So we, as a group, have had a really hard time with that, and I just can't imagine anybody voting yes without the answer,\" Carney said. At a recent board meeting, voices from the community made their stance clear. According to NBC News, Former NASCAR engineer H.A. Mergen told commissioners, \"This land is Dale's legacy\u2014make no mistake about it. I believe we all know what Dale would want his legacy to be.\" Donna Jones, who lives half a mile from the site, asked, \"Who's going to want to buy or build a house next to a data center?\" For supporters, the proposal is a chance to bring high-paying jobs and lasting tax revenue to Mooresville. For opponents, it's an irreversible break from the quiet, open space Dale Earnhardt valued in life. The Mooresville Board of Commissioners will hold a public hearing in September before making its decision. That single vote will determine whether the late NASCAR legend's onetime sanctuary becomes one of North Carolina's largest tech developments\u2014or remains a stretch of countryside tied to his legacy.

      "text": "Location isn't the only factor that determines if a house is a good investment. There's a lot that goes into finding a great deal, but real estate investor Graham Stephan recently identified the top factor investors should look for in a home.\n\"The best houses are the ones that are really dated,\" Stephan said in a recent clip.\nBuying a new home limits your profit potential, and investing in a nightmare home can result in a lot of sunk costs and very little to show for it. However, if you focus on dated homes, the profits can be promising. Stephan expanded on this point and shared a valuable lesson for real estate investors.\nDon't Miss:\n- The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market \u2014 and you can too at just $2.90/share.\n- \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share.\nToday's Best Finance Deals\nBuy Undervalued Properties That You Can Fix Up\nStephan emphasizes buying undervalued properties that you can fix up. Some sellers won't want to waste their time renovating a home and prefer to sell it at a discount. These types of opportunities allow investors to step in with sweat equity and boost the property's value.\nThe issue with buying a new property is that an investor doesn't have as many ways to enhance that property and boost its value. If the kitchen is state-of-the-art, you have fewer options to improve it than a kitchen that hasn't been changed in more than 40 years.\nHowever, not every fixer-upper is a great deal. Stephan encourages investors to focus on properties that need cosmetic upgrades. These properties should be structurally sound. It's best to avoid properties that have issues with the roof or foundation.\nTrending: Accredited Investors: Grab Pre-IPO Shares of the AI Company Powering Hasbro, Sephora & MGM\u2014Secure $0.63 Shares Before 8/14\nCompare The Listing To Other Properties\nBefore you buy a property that needs some fixing, you should compare its market price with a similar property in the area that doesn't need any fixing. For instance, if a fixer-upper costs $500,000, and a similar, up-to-date property costs $600,000, there is a $100,000 gap.\nIf it only costs $70,000 to get the property in good condition, your $500,000 property will become a $600,000 property.. However, if it costs $150,000 to update the same $500,000 property, you're under $50,000.\nAnticipating the total costs of bringing the home up to date and calculating the gap between the current price and how much the home can be worth with some upgrades can help you make better investment decisions. Keeping these numbers in mind can help you distinguish the difference between profitable fixer-uppers and homes with no shot at profitability.\nSee Also: $100k+ in investable assets? Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes \u2013 no cost, no obligation.\nFlip Or Rent\nSome people fix up properties and proceed to flip them right away, while others fix a property and then list it as a rental unit. Stephan likes to have tenants so his properties can generate cash flow, but there are pros and cons to both approaches.\nFlipping a property gets it off your hands sooner. You get the capital, which you can reinvest into another fixer-upper and repeat the process. Fixing and flipping properties isn't passive, but you don't have to deal with any tenant nightmares. However, if you flip a property within one year, your profits will be subject to the short-term capital gains tax rate.\nIf you are comfortable working with tenants or have a good property manager, you can make more money in the long run with a rental property. You will generate cash flow that can go toward paying off the mortgage and building equity in your home. Some investors decide to convert the fixed property into a rental for a few years before putting it back on the market. Other investors want to hand the property off to their children so their heirs can benefit from step-up basis.\nFlipping or renting is a big decision, but you only get to make that decision if you invest in a worthwhile fixer-upper. Stephan's advice to focus on properties that need cosmetic improvements can save you plenty of headaches.\nRead Next: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here\u2019s how you can earn passive income with just $10.\nImage: Shutterstock\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "Benzinga Money is a reader-supported publication. We may earn a commission from the advertisers associated with this article. Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nAmerica has a debt problem, and recent policy is making it worse. President Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Beautiful Bill\u201d is expected to add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, and economists project that the debt-to-GDP ratio will go from 100% to 120% in the same timespan.\nAs a result, corporations and consumers will be stuck with high interest rates until something changes.\nThat change might just come from artificial intelligence, one company argues.\nRange is an AI-powered wealth management platform for high earners that centralizes investments, taxes, estate plans, and more in one account. The platform uses advanced AI technology to deliver personalized financial guidance at fees 75-90% lower than traditional advisors, making expert wealth management more accessible. Today, Range serves nearly 2,000 clients managing over $6 billion in assets.\nTaresh Batra, Range\u2019s vice president of Investments, says these AI-driven productivity gains could be the key to accelerating GDP growth while bringing inflation and interest rates down. \u201cHigher growth and lower interest rates as a result of AI could be a panacea for the markets,\u201d Batra says.\nProductivity is Key\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office uses the following formula to measure and forecast the country\u2019s GDP, or Gross Domestic Product:\nReal GDP Growth = Labor Growth(x labor contribution) + Capital Growth(x capital contribution) + Productivity\n\u201cOf these variables, changes in productivity have the largest impact on GDP growth,\u201d Batra says. \u201cTechnological innovation has been the driver of productivity over the course of history.\u201d\nAI, Batra argues, has the potential to improve productivity and benefit the economy in the coming years, similarly to how the dot-com boom did in the mid-1990s.\nHere\u2019s how:\n- Direct Economic Growth: With AI, companies and workers can be more productive without requiring additional resources.\n- More Jobs, Not Less: While AI may automate certain tasks, history shows that technology creates more jobs than it replaces. In fact, 60% of today\u2019s jobs didn\u2019t exist in 1940. The World Economic Forum projects AI will generate a net gain of 78 million new jobs this decade alone. Range itself exemplifies this trend by employing CFPs, CPAs, and CFAs who collaborate closely with AI engineers to build smarter financial tools.\n- Increased Tax Revenues: \u201cHigher productivity usually leads to higher corporate profits, wages, and economic activity\u2014all of which generate increased tax receipts,\u201d Batra says. \u201cMore government revenue means less need to borrow.\u201d\n- Disinflationary Pressure: \u201cLess government borrowing leads to lower inflationary pressure,\u201d Batra says. \u201cIn addition, productivity improvements reduce the cost of producing goods and services, which slows down inflation.\u201d\n- Improved Debt Dynamics & Lower Rates: Lower inflation means the Federal Reserve can lower interest rates, which helps stimulate the economy and allows the government to spend less on interest expense and spend more money on the private sector.\nWhat\u2019s more, we\u2019re already seeing measurable productivity gains in industries that have integrated AI tools into their workflow. Even if policymakers fail to rein in spending in the coming years, AI-driven productivity gains in the private sector may allow us to \u201cgrow our way\u201d out of fiscal distress.\n\u201cIf AI delivers even modest incremental productivity gains of 1-1.5% annually, the US could potentially maintain or reduce current debt-to-GDP levels despite continued spending growth,\u201d Batra says.\nAI Is Transforming, Not Destroying the Job Market\nYes, the rise of AI has resulted in people losing their jobs. This, however, is not a new phenomenon.\nTake farming, for example. Around 70% of people were employed in agriculture in the early 1800s, but that number is now less than 2% thanks to the creation of farming machines and other advancements.\nAt the same time, technological innovations not only created new jobs to replace the ones lost. They added new roles that previously never existed.\n\u201cRemarkably, 60% of the jobs people are employed in today didn't exist in 1940,\u201d Batra says. \u201cThat means nearly 90% of employment growth over the last 80 years resulted from technology creating entirely new categories of work.\u201d\nThe World Economic Forum\u2019s Future of Jobs Report estimates that AI and related technologies will create a net gain of 78 million new roles this decade.\nRange is living proof of this. They\u2019ve hired CFPs, CPAs, and CFAs as critical subject matter experts to help their AI engineers build and validate their platform.\n\u201cThese aren't traditional roles\u2014they represent the emergence of new types of knowledge workers who combine domain expertise with technological fluency,\u201d Batra says.\nHow You Could Bring the Power of AI Into Your Wealth Management With Range\nIn just four short years, Range has signed up almost 2,000 high income members and advises them on more than $6 billion in assets.\nCurrently in beta, Range\u2019s proprietary AI engine is capable of delivering financial insights and guidance in seconds, potentially allowing you to capitalize on opportunities and avoid any potential pitfalls \u2014 for example, if you should buy an investment property or if you can retire early based on your complete financial picture\nRange also operates on a flat-fee pricing model and offers portfolio management with 0% Assets Under Management fees, so you won\u2019t pay more as your net worth continues to grow.\nDisclaimers\nPlease be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.

That company might just grow its revenue by 32,481% in three years, help users earn and save $325 million and be named Deloitte's fastest-growing software company in North America. That\u2019s what Mode Mobile did. You can still get in for just $0.30 per share.\nReaching Financial Stability One Tap at a Time\nMost Americans can\u2019t afford a $1,000 emergency bill. That means many are one car breakdown or ER visit away from serious financial trouble. There's no quick fix to such a big financial challenge that over 50% of Americans face. However, it's safe to bet that the masses will flock to any good solutions. Mode Mobile created one such solution years ago by allowing people to earn money doing what they already spend a third of their waking hours on \u2013 tapping, scrolling and looking at their smartphone screens.\nMode Mobile developed a smartphone called EarnPhone, which allows users to earn and save money by playing video games, listening to music and reading the news. With the phone priced at an affordable $99, the barriers to adoption are low. However, users can earn income on their existing devices as well. This extreme competitiveness has allowed Mode Mobile to attract over 50 million registered beta users. Launching the finalized version could bring in millions more, helping the company reach its goal of $150 million in annual revenue within three years.\n6,955,000,000 Users to Go\nCurrently, seven billion smartphones worldwide provide functionality or entertainment but take all the profits. Mode Mobile\u2019s disruption offers the same benefits but allows users to earn money at a time when the prices of goods are skyrocketing. Just like Airbnb lets users earn extra cash by renting out their bedrooms and Uber allows users to make money on their rides back home from work, Mode Mobile wants to enable its users to make money from their phones. However, its total addressable market is much larger than Airbnb\u2019s and Uber\u2019s \u2013 currently at over $1 trillion.\nYou can invest in Mode Mobile at $0.30 per share with a minimum investment of $4,950. Plus, the company is offering the chance to earn up to 120% in bonus shares, if you invest more. All funding rounds open to non-accredited investors, including Mode Mobile\u2019s, are limited in time. So, if you\u2019d like to be part of the future it's building, consider acting soon.\nDisclaimer:\nAN OFFERING STATEMENT REGARDING THIS OFFERING HAS BEEN FILED WITH THE SEC. THE SEC HAS QUALIFIED THAT OFFERING STATEMENT, WHICH ONLY MEANS THAT THE COMPANY MAY MAKE SALES OF THE SECURITIES DESCRIBED BY THE OFFERING STATEMENT. THE OFFERING CIRCULAR THAT IS PART OF THAT OFFERING STATEMENT IS AVAILABLE HERE.\nMode Mobile recently received their ticker reservation with Nasdaq ($MODE), indicating an intent to IPO in the next 24 months. An intent to IPO is no guarantee that an actual IPO will occur.\nThe Deloitte rankings are based on submitted applications and public company database research, with winners selected based on their fiscal-year revenue growth percentage over a three-year period.\nDisclaimer: Please be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.

      "text": "Far from the roaring speedways, NASCAR legend Dale Earnhardt was an outdoorsman who liked to hunt and fish. There was plenty of space to do both on his sprawling land near Mooresville, North Carolina, a quiet town 30 miles north of Charlotte.\nNow that land is at the center of a battle over the future of Mooresville that has galvanized residents and pitted Earnhardt\u2019s widow, who wants to develop the property into an enormous data center, against one of Earnhardt\u2019s children, who has joined the fight to stop her.\nThe proposed $30 billion Mooresville Technology Park would stretch across 400 undeveloped acres, adding several new buildings and an electrical substation. Teresa Earnhardt, Dale Earnhardt\u2019s widow, is seeking approval from the Mooresville Board of Commissioners to rezone his onetime sanctuary as industrial land. Tract, a Denver-based company that builds data centers and leases them to technology companies, has proposed constructing a new campus on that site.\nKerry Earnhardt, Dale Earnhardt\u2019s eldest son, is part of a growing group of residents urging the board to vote \u201cno.\u201d\n\u201cMy Dad would be livid for his name to be associated\u201d with the project, Kerry Earnhardt posted on Facebook last week, ahead of a community meeting that drew hundreds of people. \u201cInfrastructures like this don\u2019t belong in neighborhoods where people\u2019s natural resources will be depleted, wildlife will be uprooted, and the landscape and lives of the people that call this area home will forever be changed.\u201d\nTeresa Earnhardt, Dale Earnhardt\u2019s third wife, who was married to him from 1982 until his death in a racing crash in 2001, did not respond to requests for comment. This is not her first dispute over Earnhardt\u2019s legacy: A decade ago, she sued Kerry Earnhardt, her stepson, after he started an \u201cEarnhardt Collection\u201d home and furniture line, saying he was violating her trademark rights in their shared famous last name; ultimately, Kerry Earnhardt prevailed.\nThe Mooresville Board of Commissioners is scheduled to vote on the rezoning after a public hearing in September, but on Friday afternoon Mayor Chris Carney cast doubt on the project's future.\nCarney, who previously told NBC News he was uncertain on the venture, posted a video on Facebook saying he doesn\u2019t feel able to vote \u201cyes\u201d because Tract hasn\u2019t yet said which tech company would ultimately use the data center. And he suggested other board members shared his concerns.\n\u201cNo matter what, you can only trust if you know who your final partner is going to be, and we just don\u2019t know that,\u201d said the mayor, who would only cast a vote if there's a tie among the board's six members.\nTract declined to comment to NBC News. A Tract spokesperson said in a statement to The Charlotte Observer Friday that the company was \"both disappointed and surprised\" and that it was \"carefully evaluating our next steps.\"\nRepresentatives for Tract have glowingly pitched the project to residents, saying the center will be \u201ca good neighbor\u201d while generating hundreds of millions of dollars for the local government.\nEarnhardt family disputes aside, the fight in Mooresville echoes similar debates across the country as communities grapple with the potential economic benefits and environmental downsides of giant data centers that are swallowing land and resources to feed America\u2019s insatiable demand for computing power.\nCrowds of people have packed meetings from Arizona to Alabama to express fears that these projects could overtax the electric grid, pollute the water and air, and generally disrupt their rural peace with hulking structures emitting a high-tech hum. Supporters, who often include local officials and business development groups, pitch the data centers as a way to infuse economic opportunity and tax revenue into struggling areas and make good use of land that would otherwise sit vacant.\nThe White House is also praising the projects amid the country\u2019s artificial intelligence race against China. In July, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to fast-track federal permitting for data centers.\nThere are already more than 5,400 data centers across the U.S., with many more on the way. The consulting company McKinsey said in April that it forecasts roughly $7 trillion in global spending on data centers in the next five years, sparked in large part by demand for processing power to meet the needs of tech companies racing to build and develop advanced artificial intelligence systems.\nData centers, often massive buildings dedicated to housing computing and data storage capacity, can strain local power and water resources. A study by the Environmental and Energy Study Institute found that large data centers can consume up to 5 million gallons of water per day.\nWhile tech companies\u2019 need for data centers is only growing, opponents of these projects have begun making headway in stopping them. In Arizona, the Tucson City Council on Wednesday voted against Amazon\u2019s Project Blue data center, worried that it would raise utility costs. In Oldham County, Kentucky, a data center developer pulled out of a project last month and the county\u2019s fiscal court passed a moratorium on data centers after community pushback over environmental concerns.\nData Center Watch, a group funded by AI firm 10a Labs that tracks local opposition, found in May that $64 billion in data center developments in the U.S. had been blocked or delayed in the previous year.\n\u201cThe volume, speed, and effectiveness of local opposition are reshaping the landscape of political risks for the data center industry,\u201d Data Center Watch said in a statement to NBC News.\nWendy Reigel, an activist in Chesterton, Indiana, routinely gives advice to other communities fighting data centers after she started a successful movement against a $1.3 billion project in her town last year. She tells those who ask for her help that developers often present the centers as a done deal, but that isn\u2019t the case.\n\u201cIn the end, people need hope,\u201d she said, \u201cand then they need information, and then they got to work their rear ends off.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what the organizers in Mooresville have been doing. About 200 people crowded a Board of Commissioners meeting last Monday, many wearing red T-shirts to signal their opposition to the project. All 10 people who spoke at the meeting raised concerns, questioning Tract\u2019s promises about jobs and worrying about the center\u2019s demand for water in a drought-prone region.\n\u201cDoes a data center belong in the middle of a thriving rural residential community?\u201d Kerry Pennell, who lives near the proposed site, said afterward. She helped distribute about 170 \u201cNo Data Center\u201d lawn signs that now dot the surrounding roads. \u201cI don\u2019t want an industrial wasteland a mile from my house,\u201d she said. \u201cI can hear crickets at night.\u201d\nRen\u00e9 Earnhardt, Kerry Earnhardt\u2019s wife, was among the speakers at the meeting who advocated protecting the open land and the town\u2019s quiet charm from overdevelopment.\n\u201cWealth and power are a destructive combination if used recklessly,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much of this Earth that can be gambled away until there\u2019s nothing left.\u201d\nTract representatives did not speak at the meeting, but the company has previously pushed back on the residents\u2019 criticisms. The nearest residents will hear nothing louder than the thrum of a refrigerator, Tract will pay for infrastructure upgrades that will supply the center with plenty of water and electricity, and the project will generate about 1,000 jobs during construction and 200 permanently, the company said in a presentation. The company currently has 10 projects underway in five states, including Texas, Virginia, Minnesota and Nevada.\nDonna Jones, 54, was drawn to Mooresville\u2019s quiet and safety a decade ago when she and her husband were looking for a place to raise their sons. They bought chickens, then goats and ducks, and they never worried when the boys played outside.\n\u201cWe had a little farm, and we thought we had paradise,\u201d she said.\nThat little farm is about half a mile from the proposed data center. She worries that the disruption will make it difficult to stay, and just as difficult to leave.\n\u201cThese are our lives,\u201d she said. \u201cOur property value. What\u2019s going to happen to that? Who\u2019s going to want to buy or build a house next to a data center?\u201d\nIn a town where many residents still remember Dale Earnhardt or are friendly with his kin, there is a feeling of protectiveness around the racing star, which extends to the land where he spent time.\n\u201cDale was a hero of mine,\u201d said H.A. Mergen, who spoke at Monday\u2019s board meeting. \u201cThis land is Dale\u2019s legacy \u2014 make no mistake about it. I believe we all know what Dale would want his legacy to be.\u201d"

      "text": "Retirement, ideally a period of relaxation and enjoyment after years of hard work, is often envisioned as a time to pursue hobbies, travel or simply unwind. But without a solid financial plan, many Americans worry they\u2019ll outlive their money. This fear is often more acute among married couples, who face the added complexity of planning for two people with varying financial needs.\nIf you're 50 or older and have over $100,000 in investable assets, now is the time to take retirement planning seriously. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be difficult. WiserAdvisor's free tool matches you with a vetted financial advisor that meets your needs, with no obligation to hire.\n60% of Americans Lack a Retirement-Specific Account\u2013 Do you?\nA NerdWallet study, using the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances, indicates that 60% of Americans lack a retirement-specific account. The disparity in average household retirement savings by age group further illustrates this issue:\n- Under 35: $49,130 (median: $18,880)\n- Ages 35 to 44: $141,520 (median: $45,000)\n- Ages 45 to 54: $313,220 (median: $115,000)\n- Ages 55 to 64: $537,560 (median: $185,000)\n- Ages 65 to 74: $609,230 (median: $200,000)\nThese figures show a significant gap between average and median savings, pointing to a broad spectrum of financial preparedness across different age groups. Those nearing retirement, especially those with $250,000 or more in retirement savings, stand to benefit most from expert, fiduciary guidance.\nTo guide couples in their retirement planning, T. Rowe Price, a reputable global investment management firm, provides savings benchmarks as multiples of income, varying by household income and marital status.\nFor example, a dual-income married couple with an annual income of $75,000 at age 55 should have retirement savings equal to five times their income, which should increase to 8.5 times by age 65. These benchmarks scale up for higher-income brackets, and for those with $250,000 or more in assets, strategic investment planning becomes especially important.\nFind a Vetted Financial Advisor\nIf you\u2019ve worked hard to build a nest egg of $100,000 or more, WiserAdvisor can connect you with a trusted, independent fiduciary advisor who understands the unique financial needs of pre-retirees and retirees.\nFiduciary advisors are legally required to put your interests first. They can help you:\n- Create a tax-smart drawdown plan\n- Manage and grow a diversified investment portfolio\n- Maximize Social Security strategies\n- Protect assets for your spouse or heirs\n- The matching service is fast and free\u2014and designed specifically for individuals with significant investable assets who are looking for personalized, high-quality advice.\nTake the first step toward a more confident retirement. If you have at least $100,000 in investable assets, WiserAdvisor can match you with a pre-screened fiduciary financial advisor in your area.\nBook here to get started; no cost, no obligation.\nBenzinga Money is a reader-supported publication.
