  "description": "Data quality is one of the biggest barriers to AI implementation",
  "content": "Industry 4.0 is reshaping the manufacturing industry and one of the key catalysts to its success is AI. But, given its productivity and quality benefits, why do over 60% of UK manufacturers not have AI implemented into their operations? It\u2019s not as simple as other plug-and-play add-ons, AI needs to be fed on quality data and that\u2019s lacking in today's manufacturing industry.\n\nAI systems are only as good as the data they are fed on. Here, Nicholas highlights the roadmap data needs to follow before it can be fed into AI systems to gain actionable insights \u2013 from data cleaning and storage to the hybrid pathway to smart factories.\n\nAI success hinges on AI-ready data. So much so that Gartner predicts 60% of AI projects unsupported by AI-ready data will be abandoned by the end of 2026. There is no shortage of data in the manufacturing industry. Data comes from machine sensors, IoT devices, and control systems but this raw data is not AI-ready straight away. First, it must be cleaned, contextualized, structured, and processed.\n\nAI can easily miss signals or raise false alarms when it\u2019s fed on uncontextualized data. For manufacturers to ensure this is the case, a data platform with secure governance and quality control is required. This foundation can ensure AI is fed accurate and reliable data. Here are the steps manufacturers need to take to make AI-ready data a reality:\n\nThe multiple sources of data in the manufacturing industry can cause headaches for AI when trying to interpret and understand the data. Ensuring data is accurate, consistent, and complete is crucial.\n\nContextual metadata such as machine ID, timestamps, digital product passports, and batch numbers can help manufacturers fix errors, handle missing values, validate sensor outputs, remove duplicates, and flag anomalies before data is fed into AI platforms.\n\n2: Management & Security \u2013 clear data ownership is key in the most cyberattacked industry\n\nFor three years running, manufacturing has been the most cyberattacked industry and with data coming from multiple sources, the threat of cyberattacks is vast. Manufacturers need to ensure sensitive data is securely managed by utilizing role-based access control and encryption.\n\nFirst, clear ownership of data needs to be established with access rights and compliance rules, then a data catalogue can be developed so stakeholders know where data is, when it\u2019s available, and how to access it.\n\n3: Make data silos a thing of the past \u2013 centralize and contextualize data\n\nOne of the biggest barriers to effective data use in manufacturing is the siloing of Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT). To overcome this, data must be brought into a central platform. But consolidation alone isn\u2019t enough \u2013 standardized definitions are needed to align data from the top floor to the factory floor.\n\nUsing a unified namespace or knowledge base helps connect equipment, processes, and sensor streams, reducing confusion and enabling consistency across the business.\n\nWith these foundations in place, manufacturers can transform raw industrial data into a structured digital twin. The next step? Feeding that data into advanced analytics and machine learning.\n\n4: Old legacy and batch processes won\u2019t cut it \u2013 time to upgrade your system\n\nOnce raw manufacturing data has been cleaned and contextualized, the next challenge facing manufacturers is where the data can be stored and processed. Many manufacturers still operate with outdated legacy databases and nightly batch processes which are unable to operate at the speed of Industry 4.0. In fact, over one-quarter of UK organizations have stated legacy technology as a key barrier to AI growth.\n\nEnter, modern data architectures. These systems are flexible, scalable, and capable of handling large datasets and enable high-stake manufacturing environments such as supply chains, production lines, and maintenance schedules to operate with real-time insights.\n\nIn enabling real-time data insights, data can no longer be stored in data lakes, a traditional centralized system that can store large quantities of raw data in its native format. These are great for encapsulating sensor readings or machine logs for deeper analysis but without governance or structure they can quickly turn into \u2018data swamps\u2019. To move to the next level manufacturers, need to adopt a data lakehouse.\n\nA data architect that combines the scale and flexibility of data lakes with the governance and schema management of a data warehouse allows for all areas of the business to work from one unified platform. This means everyone from data scientists who are interested in the raw, unstructured data, to business analysts who want well-structured data tables can work and collaborate using the same system.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. Through enabling machine learning, business intelligence and predictive analysis, data lakehouses can store data cheaply while enforcing structure to foster collaboration and speed up analysis.\n\n6: Speed is everything on the factory to reduce maintenance downtime\n\nGiven the fast-paced nature of the manufacturing industry, data loses value if it arrives late. Take a factory setting for example. If a crucial machine overheats or malfunctions, it needs to be reported and flagged instantly for maintenance to be actioned.\n\nReal-time streaming technologies process sensor data the moment it\u2019s generated, enabling immediate action when issues arise. But the benefits go further \u2013 automated fault detection can spot anomalies in machine temperature or vibration, while live dashboards give operators instant visibility into throughput and quality.\n\nThe result? Faster response times, fewer disruptions, and smarter process adjustments reduce downtime, minimize waste, and boost efficiency.\n\nIn today\u2019s modern manufacturing industry, many data architectures process all data following an edge-to-cloud model. Edge computing devices in the factory handle the here-and-now tasks such as local inference for anomaly detection or filtering sensor noise and cloud computing devices store large-scale analytics, historical data analysis, and advanced AI model training. This hybrid model gives manufacturers low latency at the edge and the ability to tap into the vast quantities of data in the cloud systems.\n\nThe predictive maintenance aspect of the manufacturing digital transformation journey will benefit greatly from this approach as the edge devices do the real-time monitoring and the cloud utilizes aggregated data from multiple locations to refine AI models. This is crucial for manufacturers as a recent McKinsey report stated that predictive maintenance can reduce maintenance costs by 10 to 40% and downtime by 50% and increase asset lifetime by 20 to 40%.\n\nManufacturers must handle data with care to unlock AI\u2019s true potential\n\nThe manufacturing industry is almost there in unlocking the true potential of AI. Manufacturers already have the data they need to make some strategic shifts and benefit from the powers of Industry 4.0 and AI. It\u2019s not a simple process turning raw industrial data into AI-ready data, but the efficiency, quality, and profitability benefits make the process worth it!\n\nWe've featured the best IT Automation software.\n\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

Chat GPT\n- What is it: A fast, multimodal AI assistant from OpenAI that can understand and respond using text, images, audio, and even video.\n- Ideal for: Anyone who needs a flexible AI to help with writing, research, coding, image generation, file analysis, or even live conversations.\nI\u2019ve used ChatGPT for everything from writing blog drafts to debugging code and summarizing PDFs, and honestly, it\u2019s only getting better. The newest version, GPT-4o, is seriously fast and can now handle not just text but also images, audio, and videos (with Sora). It\u2019s like having a researcher, writer, translator, and creative partner all in one tab.\nThe voice capabilities of ChatGPT are only getting better with each passing day. You can have real-time conversations with ChatGPT using natural speech, and it actually responds with tone, pauses, and emotion. If you\u2019ve used earlier versions, the leap in responsiveness and clarity is obvious.\n\u2705You want an AI that can handle many tasks in one place: ChatGPT is great for writing, research, brainstorming, and file analysis without needing separate apps.\n\u2705You value customization and memory: With saved instructions and session memory, it gets better the more you use it.\n\u2705You need fast, natural-sounding voice interactions: GPT-4o\u2019s voice mode feels surprisingly human, ideal for hands-free workflows or accessibility use.\n\u274cYou rely on live, verifiable sources: While ChatGPT is improving, its browsing still isn\u2019t as integrated or reliable as Google\u2019s.\n\u274cYou want seamless collaboration with real-time documents: It doesn\u2019t sync directly with tools like Docs, Sheets, or shared calendars.\n\u274cYou prefer a visually guided interface: Most interactions are still chat-based, and there\u2019s no dashboard or modular layout for managing outputs.\nStill, my favourite update this year from ChatGPT is how the o-series models (like o3 and o4-mini) are starting to behave like real agentic assistants. They can decide when to use tools like web search, file readers, or DALL\u00b7E image generation on their own.\nIf you use it regularly, you also get smart memory and deeper personalization. It remembers your preferences, writing style, and past interactions, which makes back-and-forth workflows much smoother over time.\nI keep using it for more clarity and understanding, and it\u2019s fabulous how it remembers my past inputs. Here, you can see how it tells me about my previous doctor visits and the related details.\nChatGPT\u2019s free plan now includes access to GPT-4o with basic limits, which is more than enough for casual use. The ChatGPT Plus plan is $20/month, and it offers higher usage caps and faster access to new features (like image generation and longer memory). Team and Enterprise plans unlock more tools for collaborative and business use.\nBest All-in-One AI Assistant for Everyday Use\nChatGPT has matured from a simple text generator into a full-featured multimodal assistant that handles everything from writing and brainstorming to coding, file analysis, and visuals. With its consistent rollout of features and intuitive UI, it remains one of the most accessible tools in the AI space. Try GPT-4o for free or upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for $20/month to unlock more tools, memory, and better performance.\n2. Google Gemini\n- What is it: A multimodal AI chatbot by Google that works across text, images, code, and voice, with deep integration into Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and more.\n- Ideal for: People who use Google Workspace daily and want an AI that can help plan, write, organize, and multitask across their personal ecosystem.\nGemini has quietly become one of the smartest AI assistants out there, especially after the release of Gemini 2.5 Pro. I\u2019ve used it to pull data from Sheets, draft emails from long threads, and even clean up messy trip itineraries in Docs. It feels like a real assistant that knows where everything is.\n\u2705You\u2019re already embedded in Google\u2019s ecosystem: Gemini works best with access to your Gmail, Calendar, Docs, and other apps.\n\u2705You want a multimodal AI for visual + voice tasks: Its power to analyze images, respond to voice, and interact with media is a major strength.\n\u2705You care about fact-checking and accuracy: Gemini\u2019s auto-verification with Search makes it better for tasks that require up-to-date, factual info.\n\u274cYou need a tool for freeform creativity: Gemini can feel stiff when writing fiction, dialogue, or creative copy.\n\u274cYou\u2019re not comfortable sharing personal data: The AI\u2019s personalization relies heavily on your Google activity and history.\n\u274cYou expect full control over the assistant\u2019s behavior: Unlike ChatGPT, you can\u2019t deeply customize tone, response style, or role behavior yet.\nGemini's native integration with Google products, like Gmail, Calendar, and Photos, is probably the biggest reason it\u2019s a popular tool among the masses. You can ask it to summarize documents, draft replies, create tasks, and analyze photos. It also verifies answers with Google Search, which greatly reduces hallucinations.\nThat said, Gemini isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s incredible for structured tasks, but when I used it for open-ended brainstorming, it felt a bit flat compared to ChatGPT. Creativity and tone control still lag. Also, the personalization can be hit or miss, like it remembers your activity, but sometimes leans too heavily on past searches.\nYou can try Gemini for free, but Gemini Advanced ($20/month) gives you access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, 1M token context windows, and all the deep integrations. If you already live inside Google Workspace, it\u2019s an easy upgrade.\nGoogle Gemini \u2013 Best AI Assistant for Google Workspace Users\nIf your digital life revolves around Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and Calendar, Gemini is the AI you want in your corner. Built with native integration across Google Workspace and powered by the Gemini 2.5 model, it\u2019s designed to reduce busywork and surface insights across your files and tools.

Grok AI\n- What is it: An AI chatbot by AI focused on advanced reasoning, real-time search, and productivity, built into X (formerly Twitter) and now available across platforms.\n- Ideal for: Power users and developers who want deep reasoning, real-time search, and a flexible coding or document creation workspace.\nI picked Grok AI over Claude and Perplexity because it\u2019s evolving fast and is more than just a chatbot now. While Claude has a clean tone and Perplexity excels at retrieval, Grok 3 felt more capable when thinking through complex prompts, especially in math, logic, and scientific tasks. That alone made it worth exploring deeper.\n\u2705You want an AI with advanced reasoning: Grok 3\u2019s \u201cThink\u201d and \u201cBig Brain\u201d modes outperform most chatbots for logic-heavy, scientific, or technical tasks.\n\u2705You\u2019re a developer or power user: Grok Studio is great for perfect for coding, testing, and writing in one AI-assisted workspace.\n\u2705You want real-time summaries from the web: Its DeeperSearch feature taps into live web and X (Twitter) content, making it ideal for staying current.\n\u274cYou prefer polished UX and structured output: Grok\u2019s interface and tone still feel rough compared to Gemini or ChatGPT.\n\u274cYou\u2019re not on X or don\u2019t want to be: Full access requires an X Premium+ subscription, which may be a dealbreaker for those avoiding the platform.\n\u274cYou want advanced multimodal features now: While Grok has vision and voice features, they\u2019re newer and not as refined or widely integrated yet.\nIt comes with a canvas where I can write and test code or work on documents with AI help in real time. It's perfect for tasks where you want the AI to assist without bouncing between tabs.\nIt also has a built-in Deep/Deeper Search tool that pulls live data from the web and X, which is pretty powerful when summarizing trending topics with context. But it does take some time. My query, \u201cWhy is gold value soaring?\u201d took almost three minutes to process.\nNot to forget, Grok\u2019s UX can sometimes feel clunky, especially compared to Gemini or ChatGPT. Its tone occasionally leans too casual or offbeat. And while vision and memory features are improving, they\u2019re not as refined just yet.\nGrok is free on X, but the SuperGrok subscription provides full access, including Grok 3, Studio, Vision, and multilingual voice support. If you're technical or already active on X, it\u2019s surprisingly powerful.\nGrok AI \u2013 Best Reasoning-Based AI Assistant for Power Users\nGrok is built for people who want more thinking and less fluff. Whether you\u2019re analyzing complex ideas, coding in real time, or digging into breaking topics, Grok 3\u2019s deep reasoning and live web search help you move faster. Its integration with X and tools like Grok Studio gives it an edge for developers and tech-savvy users. Try the free version today.\nBest AI image generators\n1. Google Imagen\n- What is it: A text-to-image generator by Google that produces highly detailed, fast-rendering images across a wide range of styles and languages.\n- Ideal for: Designers, marketers, and creative teams who want photorealistic or stylized visuals with precise control over prompts and edits.\nWhen it comes to image quality and prompt accuracy, Google Imagen 3 is one of the strongest models I\u2019ve tested. I picked it over tools like Midjourney or DALL\u00b7E for two things: control and speed. Imagen gets the little things right, be it the textures, color gradients, and most importantly, prompt comprehension.\n\u2705You want extremely high-quality visuals from detailed prompts: Imagen 3\u2019s precision and realism are top-tier.\n\u2705You work in multiple languages or need fast iteration: It's efficient, multilingual, and great for creative prototyping.\n\u2705You want flexible image editing: Its step-by-step editing system saves time and frustration during revision.\n\u274cYou need full creative freedom without restrictions: Access is gated, and public availability is still catching up.\n\u274cYou want stylized, experimental results: other tools like Midjourney or Runway often deliver more artistic unpredictability.\nI gave it a prompt to \"Create an image of a mouse teaching rocket science to a class full of humans,\" and the result was pretty accurate. But as I\u2019m someone who never feels satisfied with an AI\u2019s first response, I decided to make it more lifelike.\nThe prompt was \u201cmake it more realistic,\u201d and the result is below.\nThis is exactly where it truly stands out, i.e., refining the images even better. You can edit elements step by step, which speeds up creative workflows massively. It\u2019s also noticeably fast, around 40% quicker than its previous version and supports multi-language prompts, which are super useful when testing in non-English scenarios.\nThe realism is impressive, though it leans more toward clean, polished outputs than artistic styles. It\u2019s not for pixel-level control or style blending like Midjourney, but for fast, good-looking visuals within a familiar setup, it nails the job.\nGoogle Imagen \u2013 Best AI Image Generator for Fast, Accurate Results\nImagen 3 strikes a strong balance between speed and fidelity, making it a go-to for design teams and marketers who want great visuals without spending hours tweaking prompts. With improved language understanding, better text rendering, and faster generation, Imagen is ready for creative production at scale. You can test it through ImageFX for free, or access premium tools and API integration via Google Vertex AI.\n2. ChatGPT 4o Images\n- What is it: A multimodal AI model by OpenAI that can generate, understand, and refine images based on natural language prompts, built into the broader ChatGPT 4o experience.\n- Ideal for: Creators and marketers who want to generate high-quality, stylized images while staying inside a flexible AI assistant that also handles writing, code, audio, and more.\nYou probably don\u2019t think of ChatGPT as an image generator but you should now. With the rollout of GPT-4o, OpenAI quietly upgraded its DALL\u00b7E 3 integration, and it\u2019s surprisingly capable. I\u2019ve been using it when I want visuals that tie directly into the text I\u2019m working on, whether it\u2019s for a pitch deck, a social post, or just testing visual concepts while writing copy.\nThe big win here is context. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re working on a product idea. You can describe the branding, voice, and features, and then say, \u201cNow create a realistic product shot based on everything we\u2019ve discussed\u201d.\n\u2705You want an AI that can generate and refine images in context, especially alongside your writing or research.\n\u2705You value ease of iteration: Edits like \u201cmake it sunset\u201d or \u201cadd more trees\u201d are just a prompt away.\n\u2705You\u2019re already using ChatGPT for content and want light design tools built in.\n\u274cYou want cinematic or surreal results: Other tools like Midjourney still outperform it in artistic complexity.\n\u274cYou don\u2019t plan to pay: image generation is locked behind the ChatGPT Plus paywall if you want a lot of images at once.\nAnd it actually does it, pulling context from the conversation so far. That kind of continuity is hard to beat.\nIt\u2019s also now easier to refine images using natural language. You can click \u201cEdit\u201d on a generated image and just describe the changes like \u201cmake it night-time\u201d or \u201cadd a streetlamp in the background.\u201d This makes iterative creation feel more like a conversation than a design tool.\nThat said, output quality still leans clean and literal. It\u2019s not as visually wild as Runway. Also, you can\u2019t adjust parameters like aspect ratio or style weight yet, which limits granular control.\nYou can use image generation features in ChatGPT for free. However, you can only generate 2-3 images. To get more, subscribe to ChatGPT\u2019s Plus plan for $20/ month.\nChatGPT 4o (Images) \u2013 Best Image Generator for Content + Visuals in One Flow\nIf you already use ChatGPT to write, code, or brainstorm, image generation is now built right in, so no need to switch apps. ChatGPT 4o\u2019s image generation (powered by DALL\u00b7E 3) works best when paired with longer conversations, giving you context-aware visuals with just a few clicks. It\u2019s simple, fast, and surprisingly smart for marketing assets, social creatives, and mockups. Free users can try a few images, but for full access, upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for $20/month.\n3. Adobe Firelfy\n- What is it: Adobe\u2019s AI-powered image generator designed for commercial use, with deep integration across Photoshop, Illustrator, and other Creative Cloud tools.\n- Ideal for: Designers, agencies, and content teams who need AI-generated visuals that are safe for commercial use and easy to edit inside Adobe apps.\nAdobe Firefly isn\u2019t the flashiest image generator but it\u2019s hands-down the most practical for professional creatives. I use it when I need visuals that won\u2019t raise legal eyebrows or when I want a smoother pipeline into tools like Photoshop or Express. Everything you generate is trained on licensed and rights-cleared content, so it\u2019s built from the ground up with commercial usage in mind.\n\u2705 You want AI visuals that are safe for commercial use: No copyright gray areas.\n\u2705 You already use Photoshop or Illustrator and want AI to speed up mockups or edits.\n\u2705 You care about editable layers and tight integration with your design workflow.\n\u274c You\u2019re looking for highly stylized or abstract art: Firefly sticks to safe, polished outputs.\n\u274c You don\u2019t use Creative Cloud tools: Standalone use feels limited by comparison.\n\u274c You want unlimited generation for free: Credits run out fast on the free plan.\nThe real magic happens after generation. You can push Firefly outputs straight into Photoshop and tweak layers, masks, or elements without needing to start from scratch. If you\u2019ve ever tried editing a Midjourney image in Photoshop, you\u2019ll know how big of a time-saver this is.\nI especially like the Generative Fill tool. You can erase part of a photo and tell Firefly what to replace it with, something like \u201cadd clouds here\u201d or \u201creplace this background with an office,\u201d and it fits in perfectly. It\u2019s clean, quick, and feels native to the editing experience.\nWhere it lags a bit is imagination. Firefly tends to stay within safe, brand-friendly boundaries. Don\u2019t expect surreal lighting or stylized chaos here as it\u2019s built for clean outputs, not experimental art.\nFirefly is available for free with limited credits, but to unlock faster rendering and full resolution downloads, you\u2019ll need a Creative Cloud plan, which starts at $19.99/month for individuals.\nAdobe Firefly \u2013 Best AI Visual Tool for Designers & Agencies\nFirefly is Adobe\u2019s answer to AI-powered content creation, but what makes it stand out is its seamless integration with the entire Creative Cloud suite. Whether editing in Photoshop, generating concepts in Illustrator, or refining brand visuals, Firefly gives you AI-generated assets that are ready to use in your workflow and safe for commercial projects. It\u2019s built for speed, collaboration, and compliance. You can try Firefly as part of the Creative Cloud All Apps plan, perfect for teams and creators working at scale.\nBest AI website builders\n1. Wix\n- What is it: Wix is one of the best website builders that uses AI to generate complete site layouts, content blocks, and branding elements.\n- Ideal for: Solo creators, freelancers, and small businesses who want a professional-looking site without hiring a developer.\nWix is one of the most established website builders out there, and its AI integrations make the setup process even faster. You just describe the kind of site you want, like business, portfolio, online store, and Wix creates a draft with layout, copy, images, and even a logo if you need it.\nWhile testing, its AI builder took only a few prompts and quickly generated a full website draft, complete with layout, text sections, colors, and a basic logo. The results really came down to how well I described the site\u2019s purpose and style. That means if your prompts are clear, the AI builder delivers something surprisingly useful.\n\u2705 You want a working site in minutes: Wix AI delivers full-page layouts and content within a few prompts.\n\u2705 You prefer editing with visuals, not code: The drag-and-drop interface gives you full design flexibility.\n\u2705 You want built-in tools beyond design: From payments to SEO to client bookings, Wix includes essential features for your online store and more.\n\u274cYou want total creative control from the start: The AI template might feel too structured for pixel-perfect custom design.\n\u274cYou need backend access or custom apps: Wix isn\u2019t built for advanced logic or server-side development.\nImportantly, the first draft came together pretty quickly, with relevant text sections and smart layout decisions I could immediately tweak. I then used the AI Text Generator to rewrite my homepage bio and dragged in a new image section, which the AI resized automatically. But if you don\u2019t like any of it, you can simply start over with a fresh layout instantly.\nNow, even though the initial layout setup took a moment, editing everything after that was simple. I renamed pages, swapped in new images, and adjusted sections without needing any design software.\nOutside the editor, Wix covers most of what you\u2019d need to run a website, like payments, bookings, email marketing, SEO tools, and even basics like logo creation and color presets. I like how it\u2019s all built in, so you\u2019re not constantly jumping between different apps just to get set up.\nBest AI Website Builder for Creative Control Without Code\nWix combines fast site generation with one of the most flexible editors out there. You can start with a few prompts, adjust layouts, rewrite content, and even rework your branding. Wix also comes with built-in tools for payments, SEO, bookings, and email campaigns, enough to run a small business without adding anything extra. The free plan is available with AI tools and templates. Premium plans start at \u00a317/month with a custom domain and eCommerce options.\n2. Hostinger\n- What is it: Hostinger is an all-in-one website hosting and building platform. It offers AI-generated sites, performance hosting, and beginner-friendly design features.\n- Ideal for: Beginners and solo creators who want a fast, affordable, and clean website without coding.\nHostinger\u2019s AI website builder takes a refreshingly minimal approach. You describe your idea in a few lines, like what the site is about, your preferred tone, color preferences, and the AI instantly turns that into a fully structured website. Layouts come prefilled with relevant text, images, and pages, often ready in under a minute. It\u2019s built for speed but leaves room for control, especially when you need to refine the details of the site.\nOnce the demo site was ready, I used its drag-and-drop editor to tweak the layout. Moving sections, changing colors, swapping images, and adjusting fonts felt easy to manage. There were 14 core elements to work with, including contact forms, image galleries, adding social icons, and a library of prebuilt sections for things like policies or service blocks. In my opinion, it wasn\u2019t overly flexible, but it offered enough control to get the site looking close to what I had in mind without much extra effort.\n\u2705 You want a website instantly from a sentence: Hostinger generates usable layouts and content in under a minute.\n\u2705 You\u2019re new to web design: No-code editor, auto backups, and mobile editing make the platform beginner-friendly.\n\u2705 You want extra AI tools bundled in: From SEO and blog writing to logos and product pages, Hostinger includes an entire toolkit.\n\u274c You need a very niche or complex layout: The first AI version may feel too basic unless your prompt is specific.\n\u274c You want long-term pricing consistency: Renewal costs rise significantly after the initial term.\nHonestly, Hostinger has a versatile ecosystem of AI tools. You get an AI writer, blog generator, SEO assistant, logo maker, and even a heatmap tool that predicts what people will click on.\nFor online stores, it helps generate product descriptions and email campaigns. The toolkit even includes a page generator that builds new layouts from a single sentence.\nHere, some pages may feel a bit generic if your input is vague, and you\u2019ll still need to do some editing, but overall, Hostinger strikes a smart balance between automation and manual control. It\u2019s fast, friendly, and a great pick for anyone starting from zero.\nBest AI Website Builder for Speed and Simplicity\nHostinger lets you launch a polished site in under a minute. Its AI builder creates a ready-to-edit layout from just one sentence, while extras like an AI writer, SEO assistant, and image generator help you fill out your content. It\u2019s fast, beginner-friendly, and comes bundled with hosting, email, and eCommerce tools. Grab a 75% discount on Hostinger\u2019s Premium Website Builder plan on a four-year term at just $2.99/mo.\n3. GoDaddy\n- What is it: GoDaddy is a business-first website platform that combines AI site building, e-commerce, and branded marketing tools.\n- Ideal for: Entrepreneurs and small business owners who want built-in tools for branding and sales.\nGoDaddy is best known as a domain provider for years, but it now offers a full-blown website builder that helps small businesses go from buying a domain to launching a complete site instantly.\nIts AI-powered website builder is equally good and a great starting point for a non-technical person. Under this, you just answer a few questions about your business and what you're trying to do. It then builds a complete website tailored to your category, whether it's photography, wellness, real estate, or something else.\nAnd since the layout comes with ready-made sections and prefilled text, you don\u2019t have to build webpages manually. It works well for local businesses or solo projects that need something clean and functional without getting stuck in design details.\n\u2705 You want a business site that markets itself: From captions to logos and emails, GoDaddy\u2019s AI helps drive engagement.\n\u2705 You\u2019re starting from scratch: Templates, themes, and automatic layout blocks guide you step by step.\n\u274c You want advanced design freedom: Customization is there, but more limited compared to open-ended builders.\nThe editor strikes a balance between AI support and hands-on control. You can experiment with new themes, switch colors, tweak fonts, and reposition layout blocks. There\u2019s also an AI logo maker and \u201cCreate with AI\u201d section that lets you generate everything from logos to social posts and captions. Even if you need a \u201cbook now\u201d button or gallery, simply describe what you need, and GoDaddy adds it automatically.\nGoDaddy puts just as much focus on marketing as it does on site design. You can generate social captions with AI, track email performance, and drop in eCommerce features like PayPal buttons without much setup. Even the free plan lets you accept payments. Plus, the social tools feel built-in rather than bolted on, with things like Google Photos access and quick caption prompts that actually make posting easier.\nWhile the single-page limit on the free plan might feel restrictive, it\u2019s a great starting point. GoDaddy also provides 24/7 support with an AI help assistant, which makes it super easy to get answers on the fly.\nBest AI Website Builder for Small Business and E-commerce Launches\nGoDaddy\u2019s AI Website Builder is both easy to use and powerful enough.

You can get started with the Basic Website Building plan at just $9.99/ month (41% discount) if you opt for the yearly package.\nBest AI virtual assistants\n1. Apple Siri\n- What is it: Siri is Apple\u2019s built-in voice assistant, now powered by Apple Intelligence, which delivers smarter, more contextual help across iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple Watches.\n- Ideal for: Apple users who want voice-driven assistance for everyday tasks, smart control, and system-wide context.\nEver since Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone, Apple has set the standard for tech innovation. So it\u2019s no surprise that the launch of Apple Intelligence is turning heads.\nWhether it\u2019s powering the latest iPhones, Macs, or even the ever-familiar voice assistant Siri, Apple is aiming to make everyday tasks feel effortless with intelligence that\u2019s context-aware, private, and seamlessly baked into your devices.\nClearly, Siri has moved well beyond timers and quick texts now. With the arrival of Apple Intelligence, you can now think of Siri as a real assistant. For example, if you change your mind mid-way while giving a command like \u201cSet an alarm. Wait, make that a 15-minute timer,\u201d Siri will understand it instantly.\nLast week, I asked it to send a file, and even without naming the app or saying the full contact name, it figured out exactly what I meant.\n\u2705 You work within the Apple ecosystem: Siri works across your iPhone, iPad, Mac, HomePod, and Apple Watch without extra setup.\n\u2705 You want privacy-first assistance: Most requests are processed on-device without leaving your hardware.\n\u2705 You need native voice control for daily tasks: From messages to timers to smart home scenes, Siri handles it all.\n\u274c You use mostly non-Apple products: Siri\u2019s strengths are deeply tied to Apple hardware and software.\n\u274c You rely on web-based productivity: It doesn\u2019t match Google Assistant or ChatGPT for open-ended queries yet.\nMoreover, Siri saw what was on the screen, understood the context, and handled the task without needing more input. This intuitiveness stays constant whether you\u2019re sending a message, playing music, or finding directions; it just works.\nSiri can connect to ChatGPT (with permission) to summarize documents, write creative pieces, or analyze photos, all without swiping screens or changing apps. You can ask it to explain system settings, draft an email, or pull up information from other apps, and it handles the request smoothly.\nBut I still see a lot of room for improvement here. Like, to test the most advanced features, having newer iPhones with iOS 18 or later is mandatory.\nAnd while Siri works beautifully within Apple\u2019s ecosystem, it\u2019s less effective for tasks that require external web tools or extensive automation.\nThat being said, with Apple devices, Siri now feels like a built-in sidekick. It picks up on your habits and quietly gets better, all without giving up your privacy.\nBest AI Virtual Assistant for Apple Users\nWith the rollout of Apple Intelligence, Siri has become significantly smarter. It can now understand on-screen context, follow up on previous commands, and even tap into ChatGPT when it needs extra help. Whether you\u2019re scheduling a meeting, sending a quick message, or just asking how to screen record, Siri blends seamlessly into your routine. It\u2019s available for free on all supported Apple devices running iOS 18 and above.\n2. Google Assistant\n- What is it: Google\u2019s longtime voice-powered assistant for Android and smart devices, now transitioning to Gemini for more advanced, AI-driven help.\n- Ideal for: Android users who want voice-based assistance for everyday tasks, real-time answers, and device-wide control.\nGoogle Assistant works across phones, tablets, smart speakers, and even in-car systems, so it\u2019s always within reach when you need it.\nWhether you\u2019re in the kitchen, driving, or just relaxing on the couch, you can use it to get things done without picking up your device.\nDuring testing, I asked it to check the weather, play music on a speaker, and add smoothie ingredients to my list. Commands like \u201cCall Dad\u201d and \u201cRemind me to drink water\u201d responded instantly.\nI even started a workout with Nike Run Club using just my voice. Notably, the Voice Match feature recognized who was speaking and kept responses personal on shared devices.\n\u2705 You rely on Google apps daily: Assistant connects natively with Gmail, Calendar, Maps, and Android settings.\n\u2705 You want effortless, real-time responses: Commands for reminders, timers, media, or location info are fast and hands-free.\n\u274c You don\u2019t want to relearn your assistant later: With Gemini taking over, sticking with Assistant now might just delay the switch.\nNow, Google is beginning to move away from Assistant and introduce Gemini, its next-generation virtual assistant powered by generative AI. This is a much smarter, more conversational experience that understands context better and works more seamlessly with apps. The transition is already underway on many new Android phones and will continue throughout the year.\nGemini builds on what Assistant already did well but adds a few new tricks. It can generate images, summarize documents, translate in real time, and offer more fluid conversations across devices.\nYou can still use Google Assistant on many devices, and it continues to handle everyday tasks and Google app integrations reliably.\nBut Gemini is where Google is heading. It brings more intelligence, flexibility, and awareness to your phone, home, and even your car.\nBest AI Virtual Assistant for Everyday Google Tasks\nGoogle Assistant still helps you manage your day with hands-free commands across Android phones, smart speakers, and other connected devices. It works directly with Gmail, Maps, Calendar, and smart home tools, making it easy to check reminders, get directions, or control your lights with just your voice. It continues to run reliably on millions of devices worldwide and remains free to use on Android phones and Google smart devices through 2025.\n3. Amazon Alexa\n- What is it: Amazon\u2019s voice assistant built into Echo devices and now evolving into Alexa Plus, a more conversational AI powered by generative technology.\n- Ideal for: Smart home users and Amazon shoppers who want hands-free control, productivity features, and built-in entertainment across devices.\nAlexa has grown from being a voice-controlled speaker into a full-fledged home assistant, and with the arrival of Alexa+, powered by generative AI, Alexa remembers more, responds with more personality, and handles tasks independently across apps and services.\nOn my Echo device, Alexa handles my reminders, helps me control smart lights with voice prompts, plays music, and even gives delivery updates without a hitch. With Alexa+, it feels more like talking to someone than giving commands.\nNow, it can pick up on incomplete questions, remember preferences like dietary needs, and even follow through on multi-step tasks, like finding a plumber and booking a visit.\n\u2705 You use Alexa for your smart home devices: Alexa+ improves everything from device control to alerts and media playback.\n\u2705 You\u2019re already a Prime member: Alexa+ is free for Prime users and available across Echo devices and mobile apps.\n\u274c You need AI for work or productivity workflows: Alexa+ is still more home- and lifestyle-focused than business-oriented.\nSmart home control feels smoother now. I could move music or video across devices and get Ring alerts when a package arrived, all without picking up my phone.\nYou can upload photos, event flyers, or even study material, and Alexa+ can summarize them or turn them into To-Dos or flashcards. It remembers key dates, routines, and even personal notes like family recipes or gift ideas.\nAlexa Plus is rolling out in phases, starting with Echo Show users, and is included free with a Prime membership.\nIf you just want the Alexa+ subscription, it costs $19.99/ month right now. It\u2019s built for what Amazon calls ambient intelligence, something that\u2019s always available, constantly learning, and ready to help whether you\u2019re on a speaker, phone, or browser.\nWhile the full rollout is still underway, Alexa Plus already feels like a smarter, more capable version of the original.\nBest AI virtual assistant for smart homes and everyday tasks\nA smarter upgrade to Amazon\u2019s voice assistant, Alexa+, uses generative AI to handle complex requests. It remembers your preferences and acts across apps and devices without additional prompts. It\u2019s built into Echo speakers and displays, with proactive alerts, personalized routines, and smart home control that works even across rooms. It comes included for free with Amazon Prime, or is available for $19.99/month excl. Early access rolling out to Echo Show users in the U.S.\nBest AI Notes Apps\n1. Jaime\n- What is it: An AI note-taker that records and summarizes meetings without using bots.\n- Ideal for: Founders, managers, sales teams, or recruiters who need instant, structured summaries of meetings\nAI note-taking tools handle tasks like reviewing meetings, creating summaries, or managing action items. Jamie does all of this automatically, so you can stay focused on the conversation.\nI tested Jamie in both virtual and in-person meetings. The clean interface kept distractions away, with no bots, popups, or glitches interrupting the experience.\nJust one click to \u201cstart meeting,\u201d and Jamie ran in the background. In under ten minutes post-call, Jamie dropped a polished transcript with key takeaways and action items, all neatly tagged by the speaker.\n\u2705 You want accurate meeting notes without bots: Jamie records privately in the background, no pop-ins or distractions.\n\u2705 You need summaries and transcripts fast: You get the full output in 10 minutes with tasks, decisions, and speakers tagged.\n\u2705 You care about privacy and compliance: Jamie is GDPR-compliant, and your data never gets used for AI training.\n\u274c You need live transcription: On the downside, Jamie only processes recordings after meetings end.\n\u274c You rely heavily on mobile: Jamie is currently desktop-only with no mobile app.\nYou\u2019ll also find a built-in assistant. Simply hit Command+J and the AI will help you draft emails, search meeting history, or brainstorm ideas.\nOn a call with a Spanish-speaking client, Jamie handled both languages without any glitches or wrong understandings. I also added terms like \u201cSDK rollout\u201d to the custom word list, and they came through clearly in the summary. It helped keep the transcription accurate, even when the discussion got more technical.\nThere\u2019s no real-time transcription or mobile app yet, and you\u2019ll need to manually share notes or copy content into tools like Slack.\nWhile there aren\u2019t any major bugs, the exporting options are limited. Even some users on G2 have reported issues with older conversations or audio sync.\nThat said, the summaries themselves are reliable, bot-free, and feel especially useful if you value privacy or want a clean, distraction-free way to keep track of meetings.\nBest bot-free AI notes app for private, accurate meeting summaries\nJamie captures meetings quietly in the background, transcribes them with high accuracy, and highlights tasks and key takeaways, without any bots or browser extensions. Its AI assistant helps with writing follow-ups, searching across meetings, or drafting ideas post-call. The free plan includes 10 meetings/month. Opt for their paid plans, which begin at \u20ac24/user/month with longer meetings, priority support, and more AI usage.\n2. Fireflies.ai\n- What is it: An AI meeting assistant that joins calls, records conversations, and turns them into searchable transcripts and summaries.\n- Ideal for: Teams that host regular meetings and want searchable records, auto-summaries, or integrations with CRM and project tools.\nTo see if it really works, I used Fireflies on a mix of team calls and one-on-ones. It handled speaker identification surprisingly well and got the meeting structure right almost every time.\nWhen the call ended, the summary showed up in my inbox. It was neatly organized by topic with time-stamped highlights.\nFireflies automatically joins your Zoom, Meet, or Teams calls, records the conversation, and transcribes it with solid accuracy. No reminders or setup needed.\nAfter the meeting, it delivers AI-generated summaries with action items, key highlights, and organized sections like \u201cPricing\u201d or \u201cNext Steps,\u201d so you can skip the note-taking and stay focused.\n\u2705 You want detailed, time-stamped meeting recaps: Fireflies breaks down calls into labeled sections with summaries, questions, and next steps.\n\u2705 You use apps like Slack, Notion, or Salesforce: Fireflies has direct integrations with over 60 tools for easy sharing.\n\u2705 You manage a global team: With support for 100+ languages and speaker ID, it\u2019s built for multilingual meetings.\n\u274c You need complete accuracy out of the box: Some AI summaries need edits if the call includes crosstalk or poor audio.\n\u274c You\u2019re only looking for mobile or in-person note capture: The mobile app exists, but it is more limited than the desktop experience.\nThe Fireflies Chrome extension is pretty useful for those who connect on Google Meet often. It adds a live transcript sidebar during your calls, so you can follow along in real time. And you don\u2019t need to invite the bot, just join the meeting, and Fireflies will capture everything from your browser.\nFireflies\u2019 AskFred made it easy for me to find what you needed. For example, when I asked \u201cWhat did Alex say about onboarding?\u201d and it pulled the exact response from the notes. This means you don\u2019t need to scroll through the whole transcript for a simple answer.\nIf your team relies on tools like Slack, Notion, or Google Docs, Fireflies\u2019 integrations are a real plus.\nYou can send notes to a shared Slack channel or clip soundbites into Notion to follow up later. Fireflies works quietly in the background, surfaces what matters, and saves you time after every call.\nBest AI notes app for teams that need transcripts, not just summaries\nFireflies turn every call into searchable notes, summaries, and insights, which is perfect for busy teams. With support for 100+ languages, smart filters, and deep integrations with CRMs and project tools, it becomes more than just a transcription tool. The free plan includes unlimited transcription and limited AI summaries. You can subscribe to its paid plans starting at $10/user/month with unlimited summaries, AI apps, and integration support.\n3. Notion AI\n- What is it: An all-in-one AI assistant built into Notion for writing, research, task planning, and workspace queries.\n- Ideal for: Notion power users, content teams, students, or managers who want AI help across notes, databases, and documents.\nPart of Notion workspace, Notion\u2019s AI helps you summarize, reformat, translate, brainstorm, and get answers from your notes without switching tools.\nI used Notion to tidy up a messy project doc, pull action items from team sync notes, and turn revision material into a toggle-style quiz guide\nUnlike regular AI notetakers, Notion is context-aware. Let\u2019s say you have a transcript from a writing workshop you attended. You can ask Notion to summarize something like \u201cThe importance of search intent while writing a blog.\u201d It doesn\u2019t just search keywords. It scans the entire page, or even your whole workspace, to understand what matters. Then it delivers a clear, relevant answer.\nYou can even narrow that search to a specific doc, database, or tagged goal using @mentions. It also pulls content from connected tools like Google Drive or Slack and adds citations when needed.\n\u2705 You already use Notion as your main workspace: Notion AI is built into the tools you\u2019re already using, from notes to docs to calendars.\n\u2705 You want an all-in-one AI assistant: It handles writing, editing, summarizing, translating, and even extracting data from other tools.\n\u2705 You need workspace-level search: Ask it to find updates, draft pages, or summarize anything across your workspace.\n\u274c You don\u2019t use Notion at all: It only works inside Notion, so it won\u2019t help with external docs or tools unless integrated.\n\u274c You need a perfect structure every time: Some summaries or tables need edits to match your format or tone.\nThere\u2019s also an AI Chat that works like a workspace-wide command center. It runs on GPT\u20114 and Claude to help with prompts or planning. I asked for a 5K training schedule and got a full week-by-week plan with toggles.\nIf you're not sure where to begin, the Notion templates gallery is worth checking out. It comes with a bunch of pre-built layouts for everything from meeting notes and study planners to editorial calendars and startup CRMs. You can add a template, then ask AI to help you populate or personalize it instantly.\nSome features still need polishing. The study tools often require manual edits, and summaries may lose detail unless you specify it to keep the original phrasing.\nBest AI assistant for Notion users who want writing, search, and task help\nNotion brings AI tools like GPT-4 and Claude straight into your Notion docs, making it perfect for summarizing, brainstorming, writing, and workspace querying. It helps you clean up text, generate tasks, build custom dashboards, or auto-fill databases. A free trial is available in all accounts. If you want more, go for Notion\u2019s paid plan at $10/user/month with full feature access and integrations.\nBest AI voice generators\n1.

Murf.ai starts at $29/month or $19/ month if billed yearly.\n2. Play.ht\nPlay.ht is a text-to-speech (TTS) service that allows users to convert written text into realistic-sounding audio. The software offers a range of options for users, including male voices, female voices, and multiple languages.\nOne of the main advantages of Play.ht is its ease of use.

It\u2019s important to note that Google Translate's strength lies in its extensive language support, as it provides translations for over 100 languages. On top of that, the translator also seamlessly integrates with Google products like Chrome and Google Docs. This makes it convenient for you to access translations while working on different projects and sites.\nAgain, even for informal purposes, Google Translate is a big show. It is super helpful for talking to people from different countries, sharing funny memes, or figuring out what foreign songs or movies are all about. It's like a language bridge for both casual and formal conversations.\nSimilarly, if you want to make your conversations easier, the voice-to-text function in the software lets you speak and have it translated. It not only provides translations but also perceives the sound. Additionally, Google Translate displays the part of speech when translating a single word and suggests other possible variations.\nAlthough Google Translate is very useful, it does have a few limitations we must throw light on. Sometimes, it has trouble with idiomatic expressions, which can make the translations sound strange. Meanwhile, at times, the accuracy of complex sentences can also be inconsistent. This is more of a concern since translations are confusing at times. Furthermore, there are worries regarding the privacy policies of Google Translate due to the fact that the translated material is stored and utilized for training purposes.\n2.

This feature is commonly used for remote interpretation services and lets the interpreters provide live translations. Plus, for educational purposes, Microsoft Translator offers inclusivity through live captioning and cross-language understanding which brings a more engaging learning environment for students and parents alike. It also handles domain-specific terms through custom models, which improve its utility in specialized fields.\nOverall it features a user-friendly interface, like text-to-speech and speech translation features. With all this, you can translate text instantly or in batches, and it even supports a wide range of formats, from simple text to complex documents. Plus, its integration with other Microsoft products, such as Outlook and Word further improves its accessibility and convenience for everyday use.\n4.

It stands out because of its advanced neural network technology through which it delivers translations that are not just precise but also capture the subtle details of the original text.\nWe love that DeepL pays close attention to the small details that make languages unique. This makes it the top pick for experts and regular people who want accurate translations. DeepL can understand phrases that have special meanings or certain linguistic values, which helps the translations sound natural and real in the language they're being translated into.\nOne of the standout features of DeepL is its ability to translate entire documents while retaining their original formatting. Users can upload PDF, Word (.docx), and PowerPoint (.pptx) files which makes it particularly useful for business and academic settings where maintaining the integrity of the document's layout is crucial.\nDeepL also offers a glossary and dictionary feature, which allows users to add specific terminology to ensure translations are accurate and consistent with industry jargon. On top of that, DeepL deals with 32 languages, including a variety of European and some Asian languages.\nFor those looking to refine their writing, DeepL offers the DeepL Write Beta, which helps fix grammar and punctuation mistakes, rephrase sentences, and adjust the tone of the text. This feature is great for professionals who need to produce polished, high-quality written content.\nWhen it comes to performance, DeepL is often compared to other major translation services like Google Translate, Systran, Microsoft Translator, and Amazon Translate. While Google Translate supports more languages, DeepL is frequently praised for its higher accuracy, particularly for European languages.\nBest AI music generators\n1.

      "url": "https://www.techradar.com/pro/how-to-unlock-ais-industrial-value-while-managing-its-risks",
      "text": "How to unlock AI's industrial value while managing its risks\nRamping up AI to boost efficiency, streamline tasks and improve profitability.\nDespite this enthusiasm, hurdles such as unstructured data, uncertain model accuracy, and gaps in governance are preventing many organizations from getting the full benefit of AI tools.\nFirms that rely on large-scale, around-the-clock operations know the stakes are high. A system outage or an unforeseen failure can cost millions, disrupt the supply chain, and harm overall competitiveness. A study by Aberdeen Research found unplanned downtime in manufacturing can cost up to US$260,000 per hour.\nAgainst this backdrop, AI can predict issues before they occur, helping companies repair equipment proactively and keep downtime to a minimum. Yet concerns linger around data reliability, potential algorithmic bias, and whether AI\u2019s recommendations are truly explainable and safe. A carefully planned approach is key to overcoming these challenges, so that AI becomes a true value driver.\nChief Technologist at Aspen Technology.\nIdentifying key risks and overcoming them\nWhen setting up a new asset to work in the field, organizations will necessarily have no data to draw on. That\u2019s where they can access learning from first principles models, coupled with simulation models to ensure a balanced set of data, availability of unlikely scenarios, and therefore enable extrapolation to new regimes of operation.\nData from the field can then be used to refine the model (close the simulation reality gap), or to predict future outcomes based on historical observations. With predictive maintenance technology, it is also possible to identify abnormalities by building models from normal modes of operation.\nTo enable this, companies need strong governance policies, as well as processes for labelling, storing, and updating data. While a sizable upfront investment may be needed, the payoff is significant: well-organized data fuels accurate models that deliver meaningful results.\nAnother challenge involves explainability. Some AI-generated recommendations can seem like a \u201cblack box\u201d e.g., when models rely on complex neural networks. For day-to-day industrial operations, trust is crucial, as operators must be able to understand how and why decisions are made.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nIncluding interpretable features and highlighting key decision drivers helps build that trust. When people know the rationale behind AI findings, they become more willing to follow them, improving adoption rates.\nWell-designed dashboards that map input factors to recommend outputs have their part to play here. However, they will be not sufficient in themselves in achieving trust. Organizations should ensure that they select the right tool for the job in hand.\nA complex model can be necessary for complex nonlinear behavior. However, while a complex model can address simple use cases, this comes at a cost, for example explainability, challenges with extrapolation, risk of overfitting, large data requirements etc. It is therefore important to select the right tool for the job. Generally, the simplest approach that solves the problem is preferable.\nTrust can be further assured by the use of first principles guardrails that provide peace of mind and highlight that a provider has a thoughtful approach to AI.\nIn addition, there is the question of bias. Historical data sometimes reflects outdated practices or inconsistent recording methods, and if this data is used without scrutiny, algorithms may carry forward biases into their predictions.\nRegular auditing of model performance, along with diverse data sets and ongoing feedback from subject matter experts, can mitigate these risks. Proactively revisiting the data strategy and staying aware of evolving regulations also helps organizations stay one step ahead.\nFinally, AI\u2019s integration with existing workflows demands attention. Even the most advanced algorithms will struggle if they fail to mesh with established processes. For instance, if plant operators need to switch between multiple tools or can\u2019t easily act on an AI-driven alert, the system\u2019s value quickly diminishes. Seamless product integration, visualizing AI insights, training operators on new procedures, and ensuring IT infrastructure can handle added data loads are often a make-or-break factor for success.\nPractical steps to harness industrial AI\nA strategic roadmap for AI adoption starts with identifying use cases that promise strong returns. Many companies find early success in areas like predictive maintenance, where AI models spot signals of potential future breakdowns and enable timely fixes. Another example are hybrid models that allow the creation and sustainment of models from data in the field.\nThis accelerates the model building for complex processes and improves the representation for design optimization or control, thus supporting efficiency and sustainability improvements. Another best practice is merging automation with human expertise. While AI excels at e.g., sorting through large data sets to pinpoint trends or anomalies, seasoned operators understand the practical nuances of running a plant.\nCollaboration between people and technology ensures that strategic decisions blend intuitive knowledge with data-driven recommendations. By keeping humans in the loop, organizations lessen the odds of unexpected failures and maintain trust among the workforce.\nTo secure buy-in across management levels, pilot programs need to show quick, tangible benefits. If a narrow project using AI for quality checks significantly reduces scrap in a factory, the cost savings and improved customer satisfaction help support broader initiatives. Documenting these early gains and calculating the return on investment helps justify scaling AI across multiple sites, which often involves more complex budgeting and approvals.\nAs expansion proceeds, robust model governance becomes essential. Models must be monitored for \u201cdrift,\u201d when real-world conditions change. Deploying self-adapting AI technology or regular checkpoints with engineering and data science teams helps ensure the technology performs as expected.\nEnterprises can also set up review boards or specialized groups to vet new AI solutions, confirm compliance with regulations, and measure alignment with corporate targets such as safety or sustainability.\nLastly, organizations should build long-term expertise within their teams. Successful AI adoption isn\u2019t a one-time event; it\u2019s a continuous journey of refinement, learning, and adaptation. Training employees to understand AI fundamentals, interpret analytics, and collaborate with data scientists goes a long way toward embedding AI into the corporate culture. This level of internal capability also positions companies to pivot faster as new technologies emerge.\nWe've featured the best AI chatbot for business.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "5 ways manufacturers can embark on their AI journey\nManufacturers can embrace real, practical applications of AI\nAI is no longer just a buzzword. The manufacturing industry has reached a stage where both the technology and the mindset exist to embrace real, practical applications of AI and create tangible value on the factory floor.\nFor many manufacturers, that journey doesn\u2019t require starting from scratch. In fact, it can start with the data humming quietly inside the ERP software you already trust every day.\nBy turning that wealth of real-time production, inventory, and supplier data into fast, predictive insight, manufacturers can cut waste, dodge disruptions, and outpace competitors \u2013 all without ripping out existing systems.\nIn other words, the path to an AI-powered factory floor begins not with wholesale reinvention, but with smarter use of what\u2019s already at your fingertips.\nWith that in mind, here are five practical ways manufacturers can start unlocking that value, without needing to reinvent the wheel.\nRegional Vice President UK&I, Epicor.\n1. Tap into real-time data for faster, smarter decisions\nERP systems hold a wealth of real-time operational data. AI can analyze this information quickly, helping manufacturers optimize daily processes like procurement, inventory planning, and customer service.\nTo make the most of this data, manufacturers don\u2019t need to start from scratch. With AI tools like dashboards, real-time alerts, and insights built right into existing systems, it\u2019s easier to spot trends, track performance, and act on changes as they happen. Instead of digging through reports or jumping between platforms, teams get the information they need right when they need it, helping them make smarter, faster decisions with more confidence.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nFor example, with embedded tools in place, AI can forecast demand patterns and suggest order schedules, helping avoid stockouts or excess inventory that ties up cash. It can also consolidate customer data across touchpoints, providing clearer insights into behavior and preferences, supporting better service and more targeted communications.\nWhen used well, AI turns existing data into a powerful decision-making engine.\n2. Make small tech enhancements that deliver big gains\nRather than undertaking a full system overhaul to benefit from AI, many manufacturers have turned to optimization and focusing on enhancing the tools they already have in place, through the form of \u201cmicro innovations.\u201d\nBy making small, targeted upgrades to existing systems, manufacturers can deliver measurable improvements in efficiency and performance without disrupting day-to-day operations. On the factory floor, we\u2019re seeing smart tech guide workers through complex tasks, improve workforce scheduling, and streamline everything from planning and forecasting to last-mile delivery.\nThese \u201cmicro-innovations\u201d are easier to roll out and less risky than large-scale digital transformation, making them a practical choice in today\u2019s cautious investment climate. And by improving what\u2019s already in place, manufacturers can unlock more value with minimal disruption and less cost.\n3. Free up teams by automating manual tasks\nAI\u2019s real strength lies in removing the repetitive jobs that eat up time and limit productivity. From processing supplier quotes to managing documents, many of these tasks can now be handled by AI tools, freeing up staff to focus on higher-value work.\nFor example, instead of manually sorting through customer records or tracking down compliance paperwork, AI can surface the right information instantly. This not only saves time but reduces the risk of errors. It also improves employee experience, as teams spend less time on admin and more time doing work that adds real value.\nManufacturers can take advantage of these efficiencies by applying AI to the systems they already use every day. Rather than building something new, it\u2019s about enhancing what\u2019s already in place. That way, IT automation becomes a practical, accessible step in the broader AI journey, not a major leap.\n4. Focus on clear, practical use cases\nThe most effective AI projects start with a clear problem to solve. Whether it\u2019s improving customer service, reducing waste, or managing risk in the supply chain, the best results come from targeted, purpose-driven use cases.\nManufacturers can start by looking at the everyday problems that slow things down, like repetitive tasks, frequent errors, or processes that take too long or cost too much. Once those pain points are clear, it\u2019s easier to work backwards and see where AI could help. It\u2019s also worth speaking to the people on the ground \u2014 they usually know exactly where things get stuck and where small improvements could make a big difference.\nFor instance, one practical use case is demand forecasting \u2014 analysing historical trends, seasonal shifts, and supplier timelines to ensure the right stock is in the right place at the right time. Another is improving visibility by merging data across departments to build a clearer, shared picture of operations.\nStarting small and staying focused is the best way for manufacturers to prove value quickly and build momentum for wider AI adoption.\n5. Build confidence with governance and control\nAI is a powerful tool, but it must be implemented responsibly. Manufacturers operate in complex, often highly regulated environments, and any AI system must align with strict data access, compliance, and security standards.\nThat means AI tools should respect user permissions and keep data contained within trusted environments. Just as importantly, outputs need to be monitored and validated, ensuring humans stay in the loop, particularly when decisions carry operational or financial risk.\nStrong governance builds trust. And when teams trust the technology, they\u2019re more likely to use it \u2014 and use it well.\nThe future starts with what you already have\nMany manufacturers already have what they need to start unlocking the benefits of AI \u2014 a lot of the tools, data, and systems are often already in place. The key is taking that first step.\nBy focusing on small, high-impact opportunities and making better use of the data already at their fingertips, AI becomes less of a leap and more of a natural next move.\nYou don\u2019t need a big bang strategy. Just the right tools, clear priorities, and a willingness to start.\nWe list the best business plan software.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Best database software of 2025\nMake building and managing databases easier\nThe best database software makes it simple and easy to make the building and managing of your databases better.\nThere are many different options, all of which allow for the retrieval of datasets in different ways. And there are many different priorities that may affect the database architecture, whether it's query speed, storage format, security or even integration issues.\nMany people will be familiar with the basic set of columns and rows of a simple database, such as one made with Microsoft Access, but these days databases can be multi-layered, use different query languages, and work with different storage formats such as XML.\nOf course, you can design your own database, and there are various text editors and IDE's available for coding your applications to run them.\nAnd major database software such as MySQL Community Server is now open source software. With all that in mind, we\u2019re going to look at some of the powerhouses of the database world, from simple and straightforward solutions, to ones with more complex architecture that may require extensive customization.\nTo assess what areas they perform well in, we compared these database software across numerous aspects. We looked at their performance, scalability, interface, security, and automation features. We also looked at their pricing, customer support, configurability, and the quality of tools they offer, among other aspects.\nWe've also listed the best SQL online courses.\nThe best database software of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest database software for management\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMicrosoft Azure offers a wide range of database software and management options, hardly surprising as Microsoft has been a leading developer of database formats for decades.\nWhile home users may (or may not!) be familiar with Microsoft Access, which comes as part of the Microsoft Office suite of apps, MySQL has been one of Microsoft's most valuable gifts to the open source community.\nAlthough MySQL is increasingly in competition with other database types, not least PostgreSQL and non-relational databases such as NoSQL, Microsoft can cater for these and more with its cloud-based Azure offering.\nThe Microsoft Azure platform is already an industry leading service, but databases and database management remain core to that. And while some users may feel overwhelmed by the many options in Azure, the one that allows databases to be fully managed can provide some relief.\nPricing is dependent upon the actual Azure services being subscribed to, but estimates are available allow with introductory offers to help ease new users into the Azure ecosystem.\nRead our full Microsoft Azure review.\nTake a look at our Microsoft discount codes for the best Microsoft offers and savings.\nBest database software cloud DBaaS\n2. Oracle Database\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Oracle Database offers a database as a service (DBaaS) platform that runs in the cloud, and features at the heart of Oracle's cloud service provision. It aims to provide a wide range of benefits for enterprises and database administrators alike.\nFor a start, it aims to provide improved agility and innovation, offer faster time to market, while reducing risks and lowering costs over traditional on-premises databases. It's also designed to withstand hardware failure and offers a full-stack of patching software, firmware, clustering, and virtualization. Performance and capacity can be easily scaled as and when needed.\nThe use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) means that many routine functions can be automated, reducing workload stress for database administrators and allowing them to focus on more high-value tasks.\nBetter still, Oracle provide an \"always free\" tier with their cloud services, which includes the use of two Oracle Autonomous Databases, as well as access to tools such as Oracle Application Express (APEX) and Oracle SQL Developer.\nBest customizable database software\n3. TeamDesk\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you\u2019re looking for a powerful database solution that\u2019s also easy to use, then it\u2019s worth checking out TeamDesk. It provides you with the tools to create custom databases quickly without any prior technical knowledge.\nWhat\u2019s great about TeamDesk is that it runs on the cloud through its own secure servers, so you don\u2019t need to invest in your own hardware. According to the company, it\u2019s achieved a 99.96% uptime record over the past six years, making it a reliable choice.\nThe software runs on PC, Mac, iPhone, Android and Windows Phone. To set up a database, you can either choose from a library of predefined templates or build your own from scratch. Once you\u2019ve done that, you\u2019re able to remove and add functionalities as your business grows.\nIn terms of pricing, there are several plans available. The starter package lets you add up to five users with an unlimited amount of tables, records, storage space and customer support. However, there\u2019s a team edition available and an enterprise edition as well. At any rate, you can sign up for a 14-day free trial to test the waters.\nBest database software for Mac\n4. TablePlus\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLooking for an on-premise database management platform? Then look no further than TablePlus. Available for the Mac and Windows, it lets you create and manage a plethora of relational databases from one user interface, including the likes of MySQL, SQLite, Redis, Amazon Redshift and Postgres.\nIt lets you create, query, edit and save databases easily from a native app that\u2019s fast and easy-to-use. However, one of the defining features of this software is that it comes with native TLS encryption to ensure that important business data never gets into the wrong hands.\nAs for other features, there are multi-tab and multi-window modes so you can get a quick overview of various datasets. And you can track changes you\u2019ve made to your databases through a function called Code Review. You can also split databases into tabs and highlight different datasets to increase productivity.\nThis software is used by major companies and organizations such as Spotify, Apple, Intel, FastMail, Stanford University, Shutterstock, and Rocket Internet.\nBest database software for ease-of-use\n5. Knack\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTargeted at organizations of all sizes, Knack is probably one of the most diverse and easy-to-use database management solutions out there. The cloud-based platform is used by thousands of businesses across the world, including Fortune 500 companies, startups, educational institutions and charities.\nIt offers a range of tools that aim to transform the way you organize business data. You can structure it based on metrics such as names and emails, link records together, and gain a better insight into your data by using a range of formulas and equations. What\u2019s more, the interface is easy-to-use and requires no coding knowledge.\nTo get real-time data insights, you can set up dashboards kitted out with charts, graphs and pivot tables. You can also conduct searches across datasets and make use of flexible filters. And just like TeamDesk, there\u2019s a variety of pre-built templates available, meaning you can set up advanced databases quickly.\nThe software comes with some neat e-commerce abilities, too.

      "text": "Best encryption software of 2025\nKeep your data secret and safe\nWe list the best encryption software, to make it simple and easy to make your data more secure and private.\nEncryption software has become increasingly important, as it's become easier than ever for hackers, rogue apps, and even media giants to be able to access your personal details, and even your data.\nFor personal users this can mean anything from your personal files to all of your photos being potentially exposed or even deleted by a malware attack, which could be devastating.\nFor businesses it's even more serious, as they have a legal duty to protect customer records, and if hacked the exposure of any sensitive or confidential information can result in steep fines, brand damage, and long-term financial loss.\nWhile there are a number of security solutions available, everything from free anti-malware tools for home consumers and cloud anti-virus for business, even simple human error can undermine these attempts to secure data.\nEncryption software is already deployed by some large corporations and government agencies to protect data, but it's also available and now accessible for a wider range of users.\nOnce properly setup, even if your security software fails, thieves/hackers/snoopers would still find it almost impossible to do anything with any encrypted data that might be exposed.\nBelow we list the best encryption software tools.\nWe've featured the best ransomware protection.\nThe best encryption software of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest encryption software overall\nReasons to buy\nMicrosoft OneDrive may not be the first option that comes to people's minds when they think of encryption software, but what a lot of people don't realize is that it comes with its own secure and encrypted file storage area in the form of the Personal Vault.\nYou can choose which files and folders to include, and these will become locked and encrypted. However, while the default is for only you to be able to access them, there is the option to share specific files and folders with other users.\nThis is great because OneDrive works really well as a small business and personal cloud storage solution, so the ability to encrypt files is a great bonus.\nAdditionally, OneDrive is an excellent choice for anyone who is committed to using Microsoft's services, as it offers neat integration with Outlook.com, the company's popular email platform, for instance. OneDrive also ties in nicely with Windows and there is a selection of reasonable mobile apps to facilitate access on the move.\nFor personal use, pricing starts at around $7 / \u00a36 / AU$10 per month or $70 / \u00a365 / AU$100 yearly.+\nRead our full Microsoft OneDrive review.\nOur Microsoft discount codes can help you save on your next purchase.\nBest encryption software for free\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nVeraCrypt is one of the most popular security tools, providing you with enterprise-grade encryption for important data.\nThe system is quite easy to use, and all it really does is add encrypted passwords to your data and partitions. All you have to do is give the tool a few details about your data, such as volume size, location and specified hashing algorithms \u2013 and then the program does its thing.\nWhat\u2019s also nifty about VeraCrypt is that it\u2019s immune to brute-force attacks, so you never have to worry about hackers decrypting your passwords and other sensitive data. The basic version of the software is completely free, as well.\nRead our full VeraCrypt review.\nBest encryption software for compression\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSecure IT from Cypherix is a file encryption program that also compresses your files. This means that it may take a little longer than some other programs, but it does mean your files are potentially more manageable after.\nSecure IT 2000 offers file and folder encryption, compression and file shredding all in one with command line processing and secure emails. It runs on all versions of Windows (32-bit as well as 64-bit).\nA master password is required to access any files, which can be a little limiting if you'd prefer to have different passwords for different files, not least if you're looking to share some of them with family and/or friends.\nRead our full Secure IT review.\nBest encryption software for small teams\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWhile free software can be convenient for some, it\u2019s not always as powerful as premium offerings, and AxCrypt is a good bet if you want something reliable. The software has been designed specifically for individuals and small teams within businesses.\nIt provides strong security, with files protected by either 128-bit or 256-bit AES encryption, which should thwart any intruders. There are also cloud storage capabilities thrown into the mix \u2013 the software will automatically protect files saved on services such as Google Drive and Dropbox.\nAxCrypt is fully multilingual, and it can work with languages such as Dutch, French, German, Italian, Korean, Spanish, Swedish, Russian and Portuguese \u2013 with more support planned for the future. As well as this, there\u2019s passport management, and you can access your encrypted files through a smartphone app.\nThere is a free version but it's very limited and perhaps best thought of as a way to trial the software and help become used to the interface and basic functions.\nRead our full AxCrypt encryption tool review.\nBest encryption software for individuals\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAlthough it\u2019s important to protect assets on company computers, it\u2019s also crucial to add protection to any device that stores critical data. For instance, most employees have access to their company emails and other accounts on their smartphones, and they need to be protected.\nFolder Lock is a good option when it comes to adding encryption to your mobile devices. The app can protect your personal files, photos, videos, contacts, wallet cards, notes and audio recordings stored in your handset.\nThere are some other hidden security features, too. Not only is there encryption, but you can also set a decoy password, hacker deterrents, log unauthorized login attempts, back up all your passwords and get notified on potential brute-force attacks.\nThe basic app is free to download, with a pro version available for a one-time fee which opens up more advanced and useful security features for around $40 / \u00a335 / AU$60.\nRead our full Folder Lock review.\nOther Encryption Software to consider\nConcealer is a file encryption program specifically for Apple Mac computers. Rather than encrypt all files on your harddrive, instead it provides an encrypted area for you to drag files into - which means you need to ensure you delete the original copy so as to avoid having both encrypted and non-encrypted versions on your harddrive. You can also choose your preferred encryption strength as 128 or 256-bit.\nRenee File Protector is another piece of file encryption software for Windows, but this one allows you to have different passwords for different files or folders, effectively creating multiple security levels. Alternatively, you can just stick with a master password if required. And if you forget any of your passwords, Renee File Protector can provide prompts to allow you to recover them, which is handy.\nSensiGuard doesn't just encrypt your files and folders, it also hides them so that they will remain hidden from unauthorized users, which is a potentially useful feature. Additionally, you can also securely shred files, which means that it's even harder for hackers to locate any sensitive files on your harddrive that you've already encrypted, or deleted.\nWe've featured the best business VPN.\nBest encryption software FAQs\nWhich encryption software is best for you?\nWhen deciding which encryption software to use, first consider what your actual needs are, as budget software may only provide basic options, so if you need to use advanced tools you may find a more expensive platform is much more worthwhile. Additionally, higher-end software can usually cater for every need, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may require from your encryption software.\nHow we tested the best encryption software\nTo test for the best encryption software we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, then we tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each encryption software platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best small business software of 2025\nMake work easier to do\nWe list the best small business software, to make it simple and easy to work better and more effectively.\nWhile there are obvious basics, such as productivity suites and accounting software, it's always good to have a general idea of what different types of software are out there, so that the moment you identify a need, you can identify a solution. This is especially the case when you start to grow and find yourself wanting to communicate and collaborate with new employees, customers, or suppliers.\nLuckily, there is a lot of competition online in the business software market, and while there are big name products priced for big name clients, there are always smaller and cheaper packages which can be just as good. The challenge is to find not just the type you need, but the one that comes in at the right price for you.\nHowever, even some of the more seemingly expensive software suites sometimes have a free tier, so you can try it out and see if it works for you - and if it does, you can grow into the software as your business cashflow improves.\nEven better is that sometimes there are free alternatives to paid-for brand name suites, though often it's the case that you get what you pay for, and cheap or free can come with limitations.\nWe'll therefore look to list a wide range of software types that it's good to be familiar with, and feature the best on the market, so that should you develop a need for anything in particular, you already have an idea of what to look for.\nHere are the best small business software solutions currently available.\nYour Business All-in-One. Email, Docs, Storage & AI in a Single Suite. Get Google Workspace Today and save 15% on Starter, Standard and Plus for 12 months (Flex & Commit).\nWe\u2019ve also picked out the best small business web hosting.\nThe best small business software of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest small business software: Best office software\nReasons to buy\nThere are many rivals, but Microsoft still provides the best office software suite, and Microsoft 365 delivers a cloud version you can use on the go as well as at home or in the office. This makes it the workhorse of many businesses of every size, from sole traders to enterprises.\nThe first thing going for Microsoft 365 is its familiarity - if you've used Microsoft Office before you'll easily find your way around this platform. Even if you haven't and have used rivals instead the same still applies because Microsoft Office is the market leader that others attempt to copy.\nThe second is that Microsoft 365 works in the cloud, which offers several advantages, the first being that you can use it on the go with your smartphone or tablet, but the second being that all your documents are saved online in the cloud with OneDrive. This means you don't have to worry about losing important files to a hard drive crash, and also that you can switch between devices without losing your work.\nPricing can seem a little more expensive than it used to be for buying a standalone license for Microsoft 365 Personal, which provides you with Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Publisher, and Access, with online emails served by Outlook, and OneDrive for cloud storage of documents.\nThere's also Microsoft 365 Home which offers up to six licenses which could be ideal and cost-efficient for distributing around employees if you have five or less. Microsoft 365 Business Premium is targeted at larger businesses and includes Sharepoint, Microsoft Exchange, and Microsoft Teams.\nAltogether, Microsoft 365 delivers what you need in terms of an office software and admin platform, and remains superior in terms of functionality than rivals. Additionally, expect to find many suppliers and contractors also using it, making it easy to share, swap, or send send files between your both without any problems.\nRead our full Microsoft 365 review.\nBest small business software: Best for communications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBelieve the hype, or at least part of it \u2013 Slack may not have killed off email just yet, and it can turn into a time sink if you're not disciplined in how it's deployed, but it's also fair to say that this communications platform has helped transform the way that a lot of small business teams keep in touch.\nLike all the best software tools, the basic idea is very simple: real-time messaging in web browsers, mobile apps, and desktop clients. Team members can chat one to one, or in groups, or in channels based around topics (sales, finances, products and so on).\nWhat Slack does well though is bring that simple idea to life very intuitively, with a slick and responsive interface, and a host of integrations, plug-ins and shortcuts to keep the conversation flowing. All the functions you think you might need, from file transfers to video calling, are right there for you.\nYou don't get much out of Slack for free but it gives you a feel for the app, and should be fine for smaller teams. At the highest pricing tier, you get round-the-clock support and a guaranteed support response time of four hours, as well as unlimited message archives.\nRead our full Slack review.\nBest small business software: Best project management software\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGot both a team and multiple projects to manage? Asana helps you work out who should be doing what at any given moment, maximizing the chances of everything coming together on deadline (though you do need a certain amount of talent and hard work from your staff as well, of course).\nAs with the other software tools in this list, it's not just the features that Asana has that make it special \u2013 it's the way those features are wrapped up in an elegant and accessible interface that's easy to navigate around and works across mobile apps and the web without missing a beat.\nWe also like the way Asana integrates very well with more than a hundred other products and services. All the big names are included \u2013 Dropbox, Slack, Gmail, Salesforce and so on \u2013 and this means Asana is flexible enough to fit right into whatever workflow you've got set up at the moment (or want to try in the future).\nWhether you're mapping out the steps in a project, assigning duties and responsibilities, checking on the current status of a plan or trying to get a 'big picture' look at exactly what's happening at any given moment, Asana makes the process much more straightforward than you might expect.\nRead our full Asana review.\nBest small business software: Best sales and marketing app\nReasons to buy\nHubspot is a platform that provides a range of tools for content management, sales and marketing, and social media advertising. Hubspot goes way beyond simply setting up a website and editing its content, as much as delivering a wide-ranging toolkit to help improve conversions, and ranks as our top pick for best content marketing tools as well as features in our best CRM software.\nIt does this by offering options for split testing, content hosting, communications within a sales team and with customers, along with goals and targets that can be tracked using Hubspot's analytics software.\nThere are also a number of additional integrations available, not least Salesforce, Google Workspace, and Microsoft 365.\nAll in all, Hubspot probably isn't the best at any individual feature that it offers, but the comprehensive set that it does offer makes it a clear market leader, and the best at what it does.\nEven better, there's a free tier for trying out Hubspot.\nRead our full HubSpot review.\nBest small business software: Best accounting software\nReasons to buy\nSage Accounting makes a good first impression with its clear and gimmick-free pricing. The top Sage Accounting plan offers decent value and there is also a 30-day free trial.\nFor this, you get modules to manage quotes, invoices, handle and submit tax online, smart bank feeds and reconciliation, cash flow forecasting, some detailed reports, multiple currency support, project tracking and more, all available from your desktop or via a mobile app.\nAll this is well presented and generally easy-to-use. If you run into trouble, detailed web help and video tutorials are only a click or two away, with the offer of \u201cfree unlimited 24/7 telephone and email support\u201d that should help make any newbie comfortable.\nSage also has a more basic offering called Accounting Start. This doesn't include support for quotes, estimates or vendor bills, and has no cash flow forecasts and could be enough for start-ups as well as small businesses.\nRead our full Sage Accounting review.\nBest small business software: Best antivirus\nReasons to buy\nAvast Business is an excellent business antivirus and online security platform, giving you various tools such as antivirus, firewall, email protection, anti-spam and the ability to sandbox applications for complete security. Avast Business also includes a number of tools for your servers, and ranks top of our best business antivirus as well as our best antivirus in 2021 guide.\nThe AV protection you get is generally rated as good by independent testing, with Avast's engine blocking 99.7 per cent of threats in AV-Comparative's Real-World Protection report.\nThe free version of Avast has long been considered one of the best for home users, but If value for money and simplicity are key factors, Avast Business could be a sensible choice.\nRead our full Avast Business Antivirus review.\nBest small business software: Best small business tools\nReasons to buy\nBitrix24 provides a vast suite of powerful business tools: collaboration, instant messaging, telephony, project management, document handling, scheduling, employee management, and more.\nIf you prefer to keep things simple then you can concentrate on the excellent CRM, which is a capable system all on its own. Contacts and communications are logged, leads assigned to sales managers, emails sent, calls recorded, quotes and invoices issued. Detailed reports keep you up-to-date and there's convenient access via the mobile app.\nBitrix24's unusually generous free account supports 12 users and includes 5GB storage, but if you need more, there are additional paid-for accounts which offer more and for more users.\nOverall, Bitrix24 is offers a powerful suite of tools that is especially going to be handy for small businesses and start-ups to help them develop and grow through improved productivity, all in one platform.\nRead our full Bitrix24 review.\nOther small business software to consider\nWe've barely touched the surface of all the different software options a small business might want to consider, not least as there are multiple areas of interest and a strong range of competitors who want to offer the best product for you. However, here are a few more that get honorable mentions, either because they're positioned so well in their respective industries, or they offer a wider ranger of features-and all of them geared toward small businesses:\nPaypal is a long-established merchant gateway provider for taking online payments, and has since moved into physical retail as well as pay and go mobile card readers. All of which means that if you need a payment provider, Paypal can cover you well, no matter what sort of business you have. There's no monthly fee for the basic plan, which will cover online ordering, which helps reduce upfront fees. And once you're well established with a good sales volume and turnover, if you'd prefer to cut down transaction fees then you can switch to a merchant account where for a monthly fee upfront you'll pay mostly interchange rates on each transaction.\nZoho provides so many different software and apps for small business the bigger question might not be what they do, but what they don't. Zoho provides such a comprehensive range of solutions that it's impossible to do the company justice here, suffice to say that they-currently-provide at least 45 apps covering everything from sales, help desk, finance, people, IT, office, project management, and collaboration. What's even better is that not only do these all integrate with each other, but also often integrate with other popular business software platforms. If you need to do something, Zoho probably have already released software to do it!\nAdobe Creative Cloud is probably another toolkit to consider here, not least because of Adobe's real strengths in creativity and design, as well as PDF management-something every business will have to address at some point. Adobe sell different apps in different groups, however, so it's important to ensure you're looking at the correct set. However, don't be surprised if you end up subscribing to multiple apps, not least the creativity bundle that includes Photoshop, and Adobe Acrobat for creating, editing, annotating, and signing PDF files.\nSalesforce is possibly the leading sales solution for businesses of many sizes. Whether you're looking to focus on online or offline marketing, telephone or email sales, then this is an all-in-one platform that aims to bring customer sales and relationships together. However, it's not just about logging numbers and ticketing as much as improving all-round efficiency. This means you can look to improve key metrics across all processes, not least your sales and CRM channels, ensuring both a good synchronicity and efficiency between them.\nGoing mobile? We've featured the best small business apps.\nBest small business software FAQs\nWhich type of small business software is best for you?\nWhen deciding which small business software to download and use, first consider what your actual needs are, as sometimes platforms that aim to do a lot of different things may not offer such an extensive range of tools as one that focuses on one particular area. Additionally, budget software options can sometimes provide all the tools you may need, but higher-end software can really cater for the specialist, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may need to save on the pain of changing to a different software platform later on.\nHow we tested the best small business software\nTo test for the best small business software we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, whether as a download or as an online service. We then tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each software platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best IT Automation software of 2025\nAutomate systems that handle repeatable and mundane technical issues\nWe list the best IT Automation software, to make it simple and easy to set up and manage a single platform to automate systems that handle repeatable and mundane technical issues.\nIT operations involve a lot of work and effort. It starts from mundane tasks like setting up computers and keeping their operating systems updated to complex ones like managing devices remotely and configuring the internal network according to custom specifications. The tasks can be too overwhelming for staff, which is why many companies now employ IT automation tools to make things easier.\nIT automation deals with systems that handle repeatable and mundane technical tasks. Automation platforms perform the simple work that humans would have otherwise spent much time doing over and over again.\nThere are a lot of IT automation systems out there, with each having different specialties. It can be challenging to pick the best ones, but that\u2019s why we\u2019re here. We tested different IT automation platforms to identify the best ones. We narrowed our list based on important factors including pricing, ease of use, customer support, features, etc. After reading this review, it should be easy to make a good choice.\nReader offer: Get a 14-day free trial on NinjaOne\nNinjaOne is a cloud-based IT management platform designed for IT professionals. It offers features like remote monitoring, patch management, asset tracking, and automated remediation, enabling efficient device management across various environments. With capabilities such as secure remote access, real-time alerts, and mobile device management, NinjaOne streamlines IT operations.\nWe've also featured the Best IT asset management tools.\nThe best IT Automation software of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest IT Automation software for IT service management (ITSM)\n1. SysAid\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSysAid is a platform designed to automate IT service management tasks. It utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to help enterprises automate their IT tasks and free up time they can use elsewhere.\nFor instance, SysAid offers ticket automation; it can automatically prioritize your IT tickets and send them to the right personnel that'll take care of the problem. It prioritizes tickets according to your pre-programmed instructions and what the AI system learns from studying your usage.\nYou can also automate repetitive IT tasks, e.g., resetting printers, granting access to software, and transferring files. You can use this platform to automatically onboard new employees and get them familiar with your IT setup. You\u2019ll get a full audit trail of the automated actions that you can review for compliance and security purposes.\nSysAid doesn\u2019t have standard pricing. Your bill depends on the features you want and your custom IT infrastructure, so you\u2019ll have to contact the company\u2019s sales team for a quote. There\u2019s no free plan but there\u2019s a free trial period to test the features before making your final purchase decision.\nBest IT Automation software for endpoint management\n2. NinjaOne\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNinjaOne is popular remote monitoring and IT management platform. It\u2019s very good for automating endpoint management, which refers to managing and supervising devices connected to a network.\nThis platform lets you write automation scripts to handle a lot of behind-the-scenes IT tasks. For example, you can write scripts to automatically back up files at specific times for each connected computer or a script to automatically update antivirus software when required. If you\u2019re not good at programming, you can use the drag-and-drop interface to create automations.\nNinjaOne's scripting engine works in various programming languages, including Javascript, ShellScript, Powershell, etc., and you can automate almost anything on a macOS or Windows operating system. You can control what devices to deploy the automation on. For instance, you can run automation for individual devices or for entire organizations and dynamic groups.\nNinjaOne is more than just endpoint management software. It offers broad IT service management features for enterprises. The drawback is that there\u2019s a steep learning curve if you want to utilize most of the platform\u2019s features.\nBest IT Automation software for robotic process\n3. UiPath\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUiPath is the world\u2019s most popular robotic process automation (RPA) tool, enabling enterprises to automate many IT tasks and free up time and effort to put them to use elsewhere.\nUiPath offers broad automation features. You can build and deploy different types of robots. The platform even comes with ready-made robots designed for various use cases, e.g., healthcare, finance, manufacturing, etc. A good example is using robots to process invoices and vendor payments and generate accounting reports.\nA good thing about UiPath is that you don\u2019t need deep coding experience to create robots on the platform. It offers a drag-and-drop interface to create robots by simply moving modules from one place to another. Your coding expertise still helps to create advanced robots, but it\u2019s not necessary, unlike with many rival RPA platforms.\nUiPath offers excellent customer support. You can contact a human support representative whenever you want and you also have access to a large collection of user guides, manuals, and video tutorials concerning all aspects of the platform. The drawback is that UiPath is pretty expensive, starting at $420 monthly.\nBest IT Automation software for large businesses\n4. Atera\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAtera is a remote monitoring and management software. It enables IT teams to stay on top of their technical infrastructure and ensure that things are always in good shape.\nThis platform incorporates artificial intelligence to help IT personnel automate a lot of tasks. The AI system can analyze common ticket requests and craft intelligent responses (though not always accurate). This feature helps you cut down on your ticket response and management time. AI can answer simple inquiries while your IT staff focuses on the more complex ones. The AI system can even tag and prioritize tickets for the IT staff to handle.\nYou can generate automation scripts using Atera's AI system. The platform comes with over 1,000 ready-made scripts but you can generate additional ones. Atera gives you deep visibility into all devices connected to your network, and you can automate software updates and patches.\nThis tool is very user-friendly, with an intuitive interface that\u2019s easy to understand and navigate. It also has mobile apps, which makes it convenient to use on the go.\nBest IT Automation software for Azure users\n5. Microsoft System Center\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nCloud computing is a major part of IT operations nowadays. Many enterprises are migrating from on-premise IT infrastructure to the cloud, and Microsoft Azure is one of the main cloud computing providers they choose.\nMicrosoft's System Center makes it easy to control and manage your IT infrastructure. You can manage all your Azure infrastructure from one place and automate a lot of tasks. For example, you can automatically monitor and troubleshoot your servers at specific periods to detect any issues before they morph into something more serious. You can allocate virtual machines depending on demand instead of renting unnecessary server space with hopes of future demand.\nMicrosoft doesn\u2019t offer a free plan for System Center, which is a disadvantage. Pricing can also run up to thousands of dollars annually, which makes it suitable for large organizations with significant IT budgets.\nA good thing about System Center is that it also enables you to manage on-premise IT infrastructure (servers and PCs) and not just cloud-based ones only.\nBest IT automation tool FAQs\nHow to choose an IT automation platform\nCost\nCost is the first thing to consider when choosing any software. You need to choose something that you can afford in the long term. Pricing for automation tools usually depends on the number of tasks and how big your IT infrastructure is, so it should be easy to estimate how much you\u2019ll pay beforehand. Always read the fine print to see if there are any hidden costs and check if there\u2019s a free trial to test the features before making your final decision.\nEase of use\nYour automation platform should be easy to use and navigate. It should have an intuitive interface that a layman can understand. Complex interfaces can frustrate users and cause costly mistakes.\nCustomer support\nThings can go wrong at any time, and you\u2019ll need external help to solve your issues. Ensure you choose an IT automation platform with a solid reputation regarding customer service; check user reviews to confirm this. You should be able to contact a human support representative via email, telephone, or live chat when you need one. You should also have access to additional support resources such as user guides and video tutorials.\nEssential features of an IT automation tool\n1. Robotic Process Automation (RPA)\nRobotic process automation (RPA) entails building and deploying software robots to handle repetitive tasks. For example, you can build bots to scrape websites and extract contact information or create bots to process employee payroll based on the number of hours worked.\nYour IT automation platform should let you build RPA bots, preferably with a drag-and-drop interface.\n2. Incident management\nYou should be able to manage technical incidents with ease. Your tool should give automatic alerts whenever it detects an IT incident and contact the personnel assigned to that issue beforehand. This feature takes away a lot of stress during the inevitable IT incident.\n3. Endpoint management\nThe tool should enable IT staff to manage multiple devices connected to the enterprise network and automate many tasks. For example, you should be able to install software automatically on all connected devices. It could be a new software recommended by management or an update to an already installed software. You can also automatically check for viruses and security bugs and deploy fixes immediately.\nEndpoint management automation makes IT management much easier for everyone, especially in large organizations.\nHow we tested the best IT automation tools\nWe test by evaluating numerous factors. To start with, we look at the feature set, the range of tools available, and what size of businesses this would be ideal for. We consider how easy the setup is, the simplicity of the interface, and whether there's sufficient documentation and tutorials for users to utilize necessary options optimally.\nWe assess how well the service integrates with other relevant apps, and check the overall scalability of the service. We also analyze whether there are collaboration features for multiple users, and lastly, we judge the quality of the customer service and the different pricing plans available.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nWe've listed the best IT asset management software.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

Unlike some of their competition that take a totally web-based portal approach, Power BI also offers downloadable software, so you can run your analytics either in the cloud or via a reporting server.\nThere is a generous sixty day trial of the software, which promises to \u201cConnect hundreds of data sources,\u201d including Microsoft applications, and other sources such as Facebook, Sybase and Oracle which can then prep data for subsequent data analysis on the fly, allowing reports to be created in just a matter of minutes.\nPricing begins at the Power BI Desktop tier for a single user, which is fully functional, and free. The next tier up is Power BI Pro and supports collaboration between users, and real time data analysis, and includes a 60 day trial.\nTake a look at our Microsoft discount codes for the best Microsoft offers and savings.\nBest business intelligence platform for analytics\n2. Tableau Desktop\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTableau Desktop endeavors to do more than make charts, but rather to show \u201clive visual analytics.\u201d A slick interface with drag and drop buttons allows the user to quickly be able to spot trends in the data. There is a lengthy list of supported data sources, including Microsoft Excel, Google Analytics, Box and PDF files.\nTableau enjoys the ability to connect with pretty much any type of database, as well as use a whole range of data blending options, to output into an even bigger selection of charts. Dashboard visualizations can be easily shared, and are mobile friendly.\nTableau Desktop becomes an expensive option for a single user, making this more expensive than other competing solutions. On balance, it also includes the associated application of Tableau Prep under the Tableau Creator package.\nBest simple business intelligence platform\n3. Dundas BI\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDundas is a browser based business intelligence tool with 25 years of experience. It is designed to be a single tool to transform data into visual data analytics with \u201cgranular control over almost all visual design elements.\u201d\nData files can be incorporated with drag and drop functionality allowing end users to analyze data without involvement from IT. The HTML5 interface allows it to be used across a variety, including mobile, devices.\nThere is a free 45 day trial, but after the pricing is opaque and requires a quote, but there are options to lease annually, or own for perpetuity.\nBest web-based business intelligence platform\n4. Zoho Analytics\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nZoho Analytics is the business intelligence tool from the folks that have plenty of experience with web-based business tools, namely the venerable Zoho Office. Zoho Reports is a robust solution, that can integrate data from a variety of files, including Microsoft Office documents, URL feeds, and databases, such as MySQL, along with applications, of course from Zoho, but also outside their ecosystem including data from the cloud from Box, DropBox, Google Drive and other applications (for example Salesforce, Quickbooks and Google Analytics).\nData can then be blended via integrated mathematical and statistical formulas, for example marketing costs in an Excel file, with sales data in a cloud database, to create a visually attractive and informative report. This is all done via a simple online interface, and functions can be applied via a simple drag and drop, with reports that can be easily viewed via the portal, or also printed or emailed.\nBest business intelligence platform for enterprises\n5. Sisense\nReasons to buy\nSiSense is a business intelligence tool that seeks to simplify the complexities of data analysis by building in IoT, machine learning and AI into their platform. They claim it is so simple and streamlined, that you can go from \u201cdata to dashboard in just 90 minutes.\u201d While we can argue the validity of that claim, their list of clients, including the likes of GE, Philips, Fujitsu, NBC and Airbus would back up that this is a top tier product.\nMain features include the ability to embed white label analytics with customizations, mashup live or cached data, analyze data across your entire landscape or focus on specific areas such as object, data, or system.\nSisense is an enterprise BI program that can be run in the cloud, or on premises. However, there no flat-rate pricing is provided for either model. Their custom pricing is based on an annual subscription model, but it requires a price quote, and is unfortunately not available on their website.\nOther business intelligence tools to consider\nWe've only scratched the surface when it comes to BI, as there are many providers in the market. However, the caveat is always that a software platform is only as good as its programmers, and data always needs to be the best quality - too many managers presume that processes and workflows are being correctly followed when they may not be and therefore undermine analyzes. Additionally, while there are comprehensive BI tools available there are also ones that focus on particular areas, such as sales or distribution, in order to provide more detailed and focused insights:\nLooker is another full-spectrum analytics and business intelligence platform that provides real-time reporting. To get the most out of it some MySQL knowledge would be helpful, but training materials are provided as required. Even without, Looker is an easy to use platform for data discovery that can accommodate a number of third-party sources.\nQualtrics Research Core is more focused on working through developing, collating, and analyzing survey data, and uses its own AI to tease out trends and actionable insights. This can be especially useful when applied to sales and marketing campaigns for analyzing not just results but can also be used to identify ideal price points.\nAdobe Analytics is a tool especially dedicated to tracking the customer journey online, and provides data to analyze how to more effectively engage with them according to their sources, ie, social media. It's able to work with complex databases to generate quick results, which can then be exported or printed easily.\nWe've also featured the best business laptops.\nBest business intelligence platform FAQs\nWhich business intelligence platform is best for you?\nWhen deciding which business intelligence platform to download and use, first consider what your actual needs are, as sometimes cheaper software may only provide basic options, so if you need to use advanced tools you may find a more expensive platform is much more worthwhile. Additionally, higher-end software can really cater for every need, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may require from your business intelligence platform.\nHow we tested the best business intelligence platform\nTo test for the best business intelligence platform we first set up an account with the relevant software provider, then tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations, analyzing data from different sources and looking at different ways to present the results. The aim was to push each business intelligence platform platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "The basis for successful AI: data quality and structure\nAI's success hinges on clean data, transforming SMBs across industries\nAs artificial intelligence becomes more integral to businesses across all industries, small and medium-sized companies are slowly integrating it. In 2024, only 26% of these types of businesses used the technology, despite 76% recognizing its value.\nHowever, as AI's benefits become more pronounced, these businesses will only benefit from integrating it into their operations. As a critical tool, AI can help these businesses build and foster stronger relationships with clients, develop innovative solutions that allow them to compete better with larger institutions and increase efficiency, allowing them to focus on business growth.\nVice President and Global AI Practice Leader at Unisys.\nTransformative potential AI has for small-and medium-sized businesses\nIn the coming years, small and medium-sized businesses must incorporate AI to remain competitive in an ever-changing business landscape. The good news is that AI can enable smaller organizations to break through competitively and provide more personalized offerings to clients across industries.\nThe impact across industries is telling. In the accounting and finance industry, the shift to AI can empower businesses to move from traditional number-crunching services to personalized advisory relationships. Within sales and marketing, AI can go beyond providing predictive insights and can offer real-time personalization to improve sales conversion rates.\nAI can provide employees with seamless service and connectivity in the IT industry, where building a digital workplace is the standard. Furthermore, within customer service, AI-powered agents and chatbots help maintain a consistent brand voice across all client engagements while automating inquiries and communications to provide answers at a previously impossible pace.\nThe bottom line: no matter the industry, AI is improving business outcomes, and small- to medium-sized businesses have much to gain from the technology.\nWhere to start: clean data is crucial for successful AI integration\nIt is clear that AI has many benefits, but an AI algorithm is only as good as the data it learns from. Clean, well-structured data is essential for AI models to function accurately and efficiently. AI systems can produce biased, misleading or outright incorrect results without it. Data must be accurate, complete, consistent, unique, valid and timely.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nOne of the most significant risks of poor data quality is bias. If an AI model is trained on incomplete, inconsistent or skewed data, it will replicate and even amplify those biases. Overrepresenting data from one source while unnecessarily reducing the representation of another can have serious consequences, from discriminatory hiring practices to inaccurate medical diagnoses.\nIn short, AI models rely on patterns within datasets to make predictions and decisions. The outputs will be unreliable if the data contains errors\u2014such as duplicates, missing values or incorrect labels.\nFurthermore, inconsistent and inaccurate data could slow down processing times, increase business costs, and require extensive human intervention to correct mistakes. On the other hand, when data is clean, AI models can train faster and operate more effectively, saving both time and resources. Whether it\u2019s customer interactions, financial transactions or healthcare records, people need to know that AI-driven decisions are based on reliable information.\nPoor data quality erodes confidence, while clean data strengthens the credibility of AI systems. Good, clean data is the foundation of successful AI. Without it, even the most sophisticated models will fail to deliver meaningful results. Ensuring high data quality should be a top priority for any organization looking to use AI.\nSteps to take to improve data quality\nFor small and medium-sized businesses to reap the benefits of AI, they must use modern data management tools to guard data quality, including implementing high data quality standards, data structuring and data governance policies.\nThe first step is to clean and structure the data into a format that AI algorithms can efficiently process and analyze to extract meaningful insights and make accurate predictions. Data is gathered from various sources, including databases, files and application programming interfaces. Once collected, data cleaning is performed to remove inconsistencies, errors and irrelevant information. The data is then converted into a format suitable for AI algorithms, such as numerical values, vectors or graphs.\nData structuring techniques vary based on the type and purpose of the data. For example, relational databases store data in tables with rows and columns, making them ideal for structured data. In contrast, NoSQL databases offer more flexibility by storing data in various formats, making them suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data.\nFinally, data storage ensures that the structured data is efficiently organized and accessible for AI processing. Each step is critical for optimizing AI performance and delivering accurate, meaningful insights.\nEnsuring data governance\nOrganizations need a robust data governance framework to maintain high data quality. This internal governance structure\u2014like a cross-functional committee or task force\u2014sets policies, processes and accountability measures.\nFirst, this framework should assign clear roles and responsibilities for managing data, which will help ensure accountability and safeguard critical information. Next, businesses must enforce data controls and standardize formatting and data structures across systems to promote consistency.\nOnce organizations have established their framework, they should maintain real-time updates and scheduled data refreshes, keeping data relevant. Additionally, compliance with validation rules and predefined formats must be maintained.\nFinally, businesses of all sizes must provide user-friendly interfaces, clear documentation and efficient retrieval systems to ensure data is accessible and valuable. Comprehensive data coverage across all relevant systems and processes is necessary.\nAI has the potential to transform small and medium-sized businesses significantly. However, the success of these AI initiatives depends heavily on the quality and structure of the data they utilize. By improving data quality through robust standards, effective structuring, comprehensive governance policies and modern management tools, these businesses can fully leverage AI to gain a competitive edge and drive innovation.\nWe've featured the best small business software.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Best cloud computing provider of 2025\nVirtual IT infrastructure for Digital Transformation\nWe list the best cloud computing services, to make it simple and easy to manage your computing in the cloud to help with digital transformation.\nCloud services have revolutionized computing, not least through IaaS, PaaS, and especially SaaS, which have allowed businesses to develop virtualized IT infrastructure and deliver software through the cloud, independent of a user's operating system.\nEven better still, businesses can also mix and match cloud services from different providers to ensure maximum efficiency and cost effectiveness. For larger businesses especially the economic benefits can be significant.\nBecause cloud services are run through software platforms and virtualized networks, it means that it's easy to access and analyze data for the purposes of analytics as well as for business intelligence purposes. The result is IT infrastructure management that allows for insights that would have previously been much more difficult to access.\nCloud computing services also offer the advantage of being scalable, which means not only can you access additional resources exactly as you need them, but you are also charged only for the services you use so there's no need to buy in extra hardware for additional redundancy.\nThis especially applies to when storing data, as online cloud storage can be treated as effectively limitless. Even though you might be using cloud databases for your structured data, you can also archive everything else into massive data lakes for additional processing using AI and machine learning for greater insights.\nAltogether, cloud services offer unparalleled potential for improving business performance and increasing profits, and here we'll look at the best cloud computing service provider.\nKamatera cloud computing: Start free trial with $100 credit\nKamatera\u2019s cloud computing services offer scalable infrastructure, flexible pricing, and enterprise-grade reliability. With globally distributed data centers and always-on tech support from live humans, you can deploy, manage, and scale your cloud resources without paying for unnecessary features.\nThere are endless cloud computing services out there, and choosing the best one can be an uphill battle. It\u2019s essential to select an ideal one based on your requirements. Otherwise, you might find it strenuous to build and maintain your platform.\nThere are many things to consider including cost, pricing, security, features, ease of use, etc. We tested various cloud computing vendors and selected the best ones for you. Each one has its advantages and disadvantages but, overall, are some of the best cloud platforms you can find.\nWe've featured the best business cloud storage.\nThe best cloud computing service of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest cloud computing provider for reliability\n1. Amazon Web Services\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the world\u2019s biggest cloud computing provider. It kickstarted the cloud revolution and has occupied the number one spot for a long time.\nAWS has the largest data center network of all cloud providers, so it\u2019s very reliable and offers solid performance. You can host your application in the region where your customers are closest. For instance, if you\u2019re in the U.K. and observe that most of your customers come from the U.S., you can choose a U.S.-based data center to offer faster speed.\nAWS is known for being user-friendly. It's built for quick and easy access, and you can monitor or modify your data just when you want. This cloud platform offers a lot of web application services, so you have a broad choice of features to adopt. You can choose the best server operating system depending on which programming languages power your app.\nAWS is also known for being very safe and secure. The platform has had few noteworthy security incidents since its founding in 2006.\nHowever, there are some drawbacks. A common customer complaint is that AWS\u2019s billing system is confusing, leaving users prone to making mistakes that increase their costs. Another complaint is the high costs of dedicated support from AWS experts.\nBest cloud computing provider for scalability\n2. Microsoft Azure\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAzure is a cloud computing service offered by Microsoft, the American tech giant best known for its Windows operating system. It allows you to build and run your applications on the cloud with ease.\nAzure has a large network of over 200 data centers spread across the globe. This network guarantees high availability and redundancy, with Azure offering a service level agreement (SLA) of 99.95% (roughly 4.38 hours of downtime per year).\nAzure has invested a lot of resources into security. It offers built-in controls for detecting and thwarting cyber threats; it applies artificial intelligence and machine learning to aid this process. The company has a team of over 3,500 cybersecurity experts working to safeguard its cloud network.\nScalability shouldn't be a worry when using Azure. You can start with small computing resources and increase them as your business grows. The platform uses the pay-as-you-go method, making it cost-effective as you scale.\nBut a notable drawback of using Azure is its complex user interface. You\u2019ll likely find it more difficult to navigate Azure than AWS and some other rival platforms.\nTake a look at our Microsoft discount codes for the best Microsoft offers and savings.\nBest cloud computing provider for Google\n3. Google Cloud\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGoogle Cloud is an eponymous cloud computing service offered by Google, the tech company best known for its search engine. Google got into the cloud game later than most competitors but nonetheless has built a strong customer base.\nGoogle Cloud dedicates a lot of resources to security. It uses artificial intelligence and machine learning systems to detect and counter cyber threats. Users have access to a host of cybersecurity features to keep sensitive data secure.\nThis platform is famous for its high performance. Ask many customers the best thing about choosing Google Cloud, and you\u2019ll likely hear about performance. Google has a lot of hardware and software expertise that it leveraged to design servers and server management software that works as fast as possible.\nAnother good thing you\u2019ll hear about Google Cloud is that the platform makes it easy for multiple users to collaborate within the same interface and access the same features. This platform also offers comprehensive support resources, including tutorials, how-to articles, an online community, and human support.\nThe main complaint that you\u2019ll hear about Google Cloud is that it\u2019s expensive, which is true. It costs more to use Google Cloud than rival platforms like AWS and Azure, but many people think the tradeoff for high performance is worth it.\nBest cloud computing provider for enterprises\n4. IBM Cloud\nReasons to buy\nIBM Cloud is a cloud computing service offered by the eponymous tech giant IBM. The solution offers PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS.\nAs hardware and virtual-based servers are combined into one on demand cloud-platform, you have complete control. IBM refer to their hardware servers as \u2018bare metal\u2019. These provide clients with sole access to their entire server. This reduces the \u2018noisy neighbor\u2019 effect and greatly improves performance.\nIBM Cloud is integrated and managed by a single system that can be controlled via web portal, API (Application Programming Interface) or mobile apps. IBM Cloud\u2019s Bluemix developing solution has a wide range of cloud SaaS management tools.\nIBM Cloud also offers full server customization. This means that everything that is included in the server is handpicked by you. This way you do not have to pay for features that you might never use.\nBest distributed cloud computing provider\n5. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\nReasons to buy\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure offers two main service provisions available: cloud architecture, and storage data.\nCloud architecture includes data management, cloud databases, and applications, while the Oracle Data Cloud is primarily for driving big data analytics for business intelligence insights. Oracle also provides a range of SaaS platforms such as HCM, EPM, SCM, and social media tools.\nFor those who do sign up, aside from a 30-day free trial, Oracle Cloud also offers a free service tier which includes unlimited access to two autonomous databases which come with Oracle Application Express (APEX) and Oracle SQL.\nBest open source cloud computing OS\n6. CloudLinux\nReasons to buy\nCloudLinux isn't so much a cloud computing provider, but rather a cloud platform you can build across your own servers. This means that if you'd prefer to have tight control over your cloud network rather than going with third-parties, you can host it yourself. While this presents a different set of challenges, it also offers a range of benefits, especially for those companies already heavily invested in their own IT infrastructure.\nCloudLinux is a distro of specifically built for virtualized cloud operations to power shared hosting services, by allocating and limiting server resources to each tenant. Additionally, each tenant is partition from each other, in other to create a more secure environment. The result is a hosting platform that has built in redundancy, stability, and security, in order to provide a better hosting environment.\nAll cloud services require a degree of technical knowledge to work with, so for those with extensive expertise CloudLinux offers the opportunity to be far more in control of your own services and how they are configured.\nBest cloud computing provider for Europe\n7. OVHCloud\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOVHcloud is a French cloud computing provider focused on European customers. It is the largest cloud hosting provider in Europe and the third-largest globally based on physical servers.\nOVHcloud gives you access to virtual private servers or dedicated servers. You can choose the type you want and the region you want it to be in. Your choice depends on the type of online platform you're hosting, as some servers are faster than others.\nThis platform has the largest data center network in Europe, so it\u2019s an ideal choice if most of your customers are based in this region. Furthermore, OVHcloud is affordable compared to most rival platforms.\nWhen testing OVHcloud, we observed that its customer support wasn\u2019t as good as what you\u2019d get on rival platforms. You need to pay a significant sum for dedicated human support, which puts it at a disadvantage.\nBest cloud computing provider for cost-effectiveness\n8. DigitalOcean\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDigitalOcean is one of the most popular low-cost cloud providers. It doesn\u2019t offer as much sophisticated features as you\u2019d find on rival platforms like Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud. It focuses more on offering simple cloud computing features for an affordable price and does its job well.\nDigitalOcean has 15 data centers worldwide, much smaller than the network of the likes of AWS and Azure. Its reliability and performance are good but not as good as what you\u2019d get on these rival platforms. The attraction of DigitalOcean is trading lower costs for fewer features and performance.\nIt's pretty easy to spin up cloud servers on DigitalOcean to host your application. The platform is easy to navigate, so you shouldn\u2019t face difficulties navigating it. You can choose different types of managed cloud databases, clusters, and APIs. You can also access complementary features such as security firewalls, load balances, and a DNS management system.\nBest cloud computing provider FAQs\nHow to choose a cloud computing provider\nCost\nCost is the number one consideration in selecting a provider. It\u2019s essential to pick something that you can afford to avoid running into trouble in the future. Cloud services are unique such that they don\u2019t usually have a straightforward pricing structure. What you\u2019ll pay depends on the features that you select. The good thing is that cloud services offer their pricing details beforehand so that you can have a good estimate of what you\u2019ll pay.\nSecurity\nYou\u2019ll be storing a lot of sensitive data on your cloud provider. Thus, it must have advanced security features to prevent data leaks or theft. Losing customer data can hamper your reputation and even bring about legal lawsuits. Similarly, losing sensitive business data can harm your competitive advantage, so your cloud platform must be secure.\nFeatures\nWhat features do the platform offer? Can you choose the type of servers you want? Can you spin up GPUs? Does it offer complementary services such as domain names and DNS management? Etc.\nEase of use\nYou need a platform that\u2019s easy to understand and navigate. Otherwise, you can get frustrated or make costly mistakes by choosing features you didn\u2019t intend to choose.\nWhat are the essential features of a cloud provider?\nOn-demand self-service\nYou should be able to spin up cloud instances and use them without external help. You should be able to monitor the servers you've rented and their allotted storage capacities. External help can always be a complementary feature, but the important thing is that every good cloud provider must offer a self-serve option.\nSolid uptime\nA cloud provider should have their servers up and running as faultlessly as possible. Of course, no platform is perfect, so you may experience occasional downtimes. However, every cloud provider should offer at least 99.9% uptime. Otherwise, you may lose money because of unnecessary server issues preventing your online platform from working.\nAnalytics\nAn ideal cloud computing platform should let users analyze what features they\u2019ve used and give them a breakdown of how it affects their costs. This way, a user can easily identify which features are generating high costs and which ones aren\u2019t, and use this information to optimize their spending.\nPay-As-You-Go\nPay-as-you-go is the best pricing structure because you only pay for the computing features you use. This way, you avoid paying for unnecessary things that you may not use, and you save significant sums in the long run.\nHow we tested the best cloud computing providers\nWe test by evaluating numerous factors. To start with, we look at the feature set, the range of tools available, and what range of business type and size the cloud computing service would be ideal for. We consider how easy the setup is, the simplicity of the interface, and whether there's sufficient documentation and tutorials for users to utilize necessary options optimally.\nWe assess how well the service integrates with other relevant services, such as security perimeters and user apps. We also looks at pricing models and flexibility, and lastly, we judge the quality of the customer service and the different pricing plans available.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

With Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Outlook forming the core programs, these cover everything from documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and emails - in effect covering most essential office needs. In addition to that, OneDrive offers online saving and backups to keep your files safe.\nWhile there are alternatives to MS Office, most rivals attempt to play catch-up with Microsoft rather than provide innovative new features, and MS Office still remains the office suite with the most comprehensive range of features. And even if you do use one of these alternatives, the chances are you are going to be working with document formats created specifically for MS Office, and handle data from customers and suppliers who are using the MS Office platform.\nWhile MS Office does have its critics, the bottom line is that nobody does office productivity better than Microsoft, and the core applications in Office have yet to be bettered.\nThe yearly Personal plan costs around $70 / \u00a365 / AU$105 and includes up to 1 TB of cloud storage per user for up to 5 devices.\nRead our full Microsoft 365 review.\nBest productivity tool for collaboration\nReasons to buy\nAsana has been around since 2008, making it a veteran in the collaboration arena, and companies such as Intel, Uber, Pinterest and TED all use it as their core method of communication.\nIt\u2019s been designed as an easy way for companies to track the work of employees and to get the best possible results.

Contacts and communications are logged, leads assigned to sales managers, emails sent, calls recorded, quotes and invoices issued. Detailed reports keep you up-to-date and there's convenient access via the mobile app.\nBitrix24's unusually generous free account supports 12 users and includes 5GB storage, but if you need more, the Plus account offers more features.\nOverall, Bitrix24 is offers a powerful suite of tools that is especially going to be handy for small businesses and start-ups to help them develop and grow through improved productivity, all in one platform.\nRead our full Bitrix24 review.\nBest free productivity app\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTodoist straddles the categories of time management tools and to-do lists, with an element of project management thrown in for good measure. Despite touching on multiple genres, the tool remains easy to use, making it possible to manage multiple project with ease, and see at a glance what you still have to do.\nThe website or app gives you a daily and weekly overview of what work you have to do, what appointment you have, or whatever else you choose to track. If you're working with a group of people and find that your workload is getting a little heavy, you can delegate tasks to others.\nThe free version limits you to working with five people and having 80 active projects on the go at any one time, and this should be more than enough for most people, but Premium and Business plans are available for a fee. Todoist offers integration with dozens of apps and services so it can tie in neatly to your existing workflow.\nRead our full Todoist review.\n2. RescueTime\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nRescueTime not only tracks the time you spend doing different things on your computer or mobile \u2013 such as visiting particular websites or using specific apps \u2013 it does so automatically. Running in the background as it does, RescueTime quietly logs your activity without serving as a distraction.\nIt's possible to set yourself targets and alerts, and the idea is that these goals will help you to develop better working habits. It enables you to see just how you spend your day on your digital devices so you can better understand where the time has gone. There free version of the app enables you to look back at three months of data for analysis, but paid-for packages (which start at $6 per month) have no limits and includes a number of extra features.\nFor most people, the free version will be more than enough, and the fact that it is available for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android and ChromeOS means that it is possible to track work across multiple devices and platforms.\n3. Beeminder\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBeeminder is quite a unique tool that can be used to track and monitor everything from running or trips to the gym, to logging how often you write, or managing a to-do list. Available as an app, or usable online, Beeminder is endlessly flexible \u2013 you define your goal (whatever that may be) and you are tasked with logging your progress. There is a degree of gamification to things here; you're aiming to stick to the 'yellow brick road', which means that, at least on average, you are hitting your targets.\nAnything that can be plotted on a graph can be tracked \u2013 number of words written, number of hours worked, number of contracts signed \u2013 and sticking within the golden zone can be hugely incentivizing. If you're willing to commit fully, you can add your credit card details to your account so you can be fined for failing to stay on track. Beeminder is not for everyone one, but it is so unique, it is well worth giving it a try to see if it works for you.\n4. Toggl\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nToggl is described by its developers as \u2018insanely simple time tracking\u2019, and that's a pretty fair summary. If you take a look at the website, it is the premium versions of the service that are pushed, but there is a free version suitable for teams of up to five people.\nToggl is available for multiple platforms and synchronization means that you can move between devices and stick track your work. There's a lot to explore here, including manual and automated track of activity, a Pomodoro timer, automatic detection of idle time, reminders, integrations with various apps and services and much, much more.\nThe beauty of Toggl, however, is that it is so flexible and customizable. What ever you're looking to monitor, you can probably bend it to your will. The detailed reports are impressive, but it's a bit of shame to see that there is no invoicing option in an otherwise feature-packed tool.\n5. Clockify\nReasons to buy\nClockify grabs the idea of clocking on and off for a shift and runs with it. It is a very simple tool, but that's precisely what will make it so appealing to people \u2013 after all, if you're busy with work, you don't to be overwhelmed with a complex tool for tracking what you're doing!\nClockify is essentially a basic stopwatch so you can easily record how long you spend working on different project. Just start the timers, and you can add labels, descriptions and project details, and just hit stop when you're done. You can configure timers to start as soon as you open your browser so you don't need to remember to do so.\nClockify integrates with Trello, Asana, Jira, Todoist and more, and you can use the website and apps to view details reports and breakdown of how you have spent your time. If you would like to keep Clockify available at all times without the need to dedicate a browser tab to it, you'll be pleased to hear that there is a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that keep it just a click away. There are also mobile apps, and desktop versions for macOS, Windows and Linux.\nBest productivity tool FAQs\nWhich productivity tool is best for you?\nWhen deciding which productivity tool to download and use, first consider what your actual needs are, as sometimes free platforms may only provide basic options, so if you need to use advanced tools you may find a paid platform is much more worthwhile. Additionally, free and budget software options can sometimes prove limited when it comes to the variety of tools available, while higher-end software can really cater for every need, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may require.\nHow we tested the best productivity tools\nTo test for the best productivity tools we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, whether as a download or as an online service. We then tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each software platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?
