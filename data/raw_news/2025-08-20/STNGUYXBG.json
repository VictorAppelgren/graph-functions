  "content": "The parent company of Booking.com has agreed to pay $9.5 million to resolve a lawsuit filed by Texas over deceptive marketing practices tied to hidden hotel fees, according to Reuters. The settlement, announced Tuesday by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, marks the largest agreement of its kind reached by a U.S. state against a hotel operator or online travel agency.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nBooking Holdings, which also owns Priceline.com and Kayak, was accused of engaging in \u201cdrip pricing,\u201d a tactic where mandatory charges such as resort, amenity, destination, and utility fees were grouped under a single taxes and fees line item only at checkout. Paxton said this practice misled consumers by making advertised prices appear cheaper than they really were, creating what he described as a \u201cbait and switch\u201d advantage over competitors.\n\nPer Reuters, the settlement requires Booking to change its pricing disclosures so that fees are presented to customers upfront. While the specific terms of the agreement were not immediately available, Paxton noted that the state had previously reached similar resolutions in 2023 with Choice Hotels, Hilton, and Marriott.\n\nBooking, headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut, denied any wrongdoing in the case. The company stated that it remains committed to transparency and emphasized that resort fees are generally set and retained by the hotels themselves. It added that its approach aligns with recent efforts by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to standardize how prices are displayed.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the crackdown on so-called \u201cjunk fees\u201d has been a policy focus in recent years. Former U.S. President Joe Biden had pushed for stronger oversight of fees that increase consumer costs without delivering clear benefits. In December, the FTC finalized its Junk Fees Rule, requiring hotels, ticketing platforms, and vacation rental operators to disclose total prices upfront.\n\nHowever, the rule faced dissent within the agency. FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson opposed the measure, arguing that with Biden leaving office, decisions on new regulations should be left to the incoming Trump administration.",
