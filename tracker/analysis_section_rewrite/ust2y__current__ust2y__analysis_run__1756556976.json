      "feedback": "Your draft is on the right track but needs tightening to meet Argos’ “action‑over‑prose” standard. 1) **Canonical mapping** – explicitly tie every claim to a handle: e.g., “UST 10‑year rose 2.3 bps to 4.23 % (ust10y ↑ 2–3 bp)”; “UST 2‑year fell 32 bps to 3.637 % (ust2y ↓ 30–35 bp)”; “DXY ticked up to 98.06 (dxy ↑ ≈ 0.2 pts).” 2) **Magnitude ranges & horizon** – state a 0–3‑week range for each handle (ust10y 4.20–4.30 %, ust2y 3.60–3.70 %, dxy 97.8–98.2). 3) **Catalyst window** – add the next PCE release (2025‑09‑??) and Fed policy meeting (2025‑09‑??) as the key near‑term trigger, and note the tariff expiration mid‑October as a secondary catalyst. 4) **Causal chain** – rewrite the paragraph to explicitly link: PCE → Fed dovish stance → 10‑year term‑premium → yield; high‑yield savings → short‑term rates; tariff status → dollar strength → 10‑year. 5) **Quantify & cite** – replace vague “high‑yield savings” with “savings yields > 4 % (YB1U5ZK2N)” and “dollar index at 98.06 (97MD1FHW8)”. 6) **Remove drift** – the sentence about “high‑yield savings products” can be shortened or omitted if it doesn’t add actionable insight. 7) **Invalidation** – explicitly list what would invalidate the view: an early Fed cut, core PCE > 0.3 %, dollar rally > 0.5 pts, tariff expiration → dollar weakens. 8) **Inline citations** – attach each claim to its source ID in parentheses (e.g., (97MD1FHW8), (YB1U5ZK2N), (1DEM6P1Y2)). 9) **Conciseness** – trim the paragraph to a single, tightly‑structured block that follows the “direction, magnitude, horizon, catalysts, invalidation” format. 10) **Check duplication** – ensure no overlap with other topics; if a similar view exists on UST yields elsewhere, merge or reference it. Implement these edits and the analysis will satisfy the acceptance gate.",
