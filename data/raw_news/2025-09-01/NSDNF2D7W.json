  "description": "Google says AI Mode now handles complex STEM questions better and surfaces key details sooner, timed for back to school.",
  "content": "Google\u2019s Robby Stein says this week\u2019s AI Mode model update improves performance on complex STEM questions, timed for students returning to class.\n\nThe note follows July and August updates that positioned AI Mode more directly for learning and study workflows.\n\nGoogle hasn\u2019t posted a formal changelog for this specific tuning, and Stein didn\u2019t share example queries or metrics.\n\nVery excited about this week\u2019s AI Mode model update. We\u2019re seeing big improvements for complex STEM questions\u2013 great for students heading back to school. Overall responses should also be tighter, easier to scan and get to the point up front before elaborating.\n\nIn July, Google detailed education-oriented additions to AI Mode, including Canvas for multi-session planning, support for image and upcoming PDF uploads on desktop. Those updates framed AI Mode as a study helper that can analyze course materials and keep long-running projects organized.\n\nIn August, Google announced agentic capabilities, opt-in personalization, and a major expansion of AI Mode availability. That suggests Google is iterating on both capability and reach heading into the school year.\n\nSeparately, Stein said that Google is testing ways to surface more links directly inside AI responses. He noted embedded link carousels are live on desktop, with mobile coming soon. Google is rolling out model updates to improve inline links within the answer text.\n\nWhat We Don\u2019t Know\n\nGoogle hasn\u2019t provided a technical breakdown of the STEM improvements or shared before-and-after examples. There\u2019s also no separate blog post specific to this model tweak.\n\nUntil Google publishes more details, treat this as incremental tuning within a broader series of summer updates.\n\nExpect further iteration on AI Mode. We\u2019ll continue to monitor any measurable changes in how AI Mode summarizes and cites sources as these updates are rolled out.",

      "text": "Google says it\u2019s actively working to surface more source links inside AI Mode.\nRobby Stein, VP of Product for Google Search, outlined changes designed to make links more visible.\nStein wrote on X that Google has been testing where links appear inside AI answers and that the long-term \u201cnorth star\u201d is to show more inline links.\nHe added that people are more likely to click when links are embedded with context directly in the response.\nStein stated:\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been experimenting with how and where to show links in ways that are most helpful to users and sites\u2026 our long term north star is to show more inline links.\u201d\n1/ Excited about the work the team is doing to create AI experiences in Search that highlight useful links and encourage onward exploration. We\u2019ve been experimenting with how and where to show links in ways that are most helpful to users and sites, and you\u2019ll be seeing some of\u2026\n\u2014 Robby Stein (@rmstein) August 25, 2025\nWhat\u2019s Changing\nLink Carousels On Desktop.\nGoogle has launched carousels that surface multiple source links directly inside AI Mode responses on desktop. Stein said mobile support is coming soon.\nThe idea is to present links with enough context to help people decide where to go next without hunting below the answer.\n2/ We\u2019ve found that people really prefer and are more likely to click links that are embedded within AI Mode responses, when they have more context on what they\u2019re clicking and where they want to dig deeper. We\u2019ve launched embedded link carousels in AI Mode responses on desktop,\u2026\n\u2014 Robby Stein (@rmstein) August 25, 2025\nSmarter Inline Links\nGoogle is rolling out model updates that decide where inline links appear within the response text.\nThe system is trained to place links at moments when people are most likely to click out to see where information came from or to learn more.\nStein noted you might see fluctuations over the next few weeks as this is deployed, with a longer-term push toward more inline links overall.\n3/ We\u2019re also launching some model updates to improve how we show inline links (links that are embedded directly within text) in AI Mode responses. We train the model to understand where and when people are most likely to want to click out, see where info is coming from and learn\u2026\n\u2014 Robby Stein (@rmstein) August 25, 2025\nWeb Guide\nSeparately, Google\u2019s Web Guide experiment uses a custom Gemini model to group useful links by topic.\nIt launched in Search Labs on the \u201cWeb\u201d tab and, for opted-in users, will begin appearing on the main \u201cAll\u201d tab when systems determine it could help for a query.\nGoogle introduced Web Guide in July and indicated it would expand beyond the Web tab over time.\n4/ We\u2019re also expanding our Web Guide experiment in Labs, which is a new approach to intelligently surfacing and organizing the most useful web links with AI \u2013 even for your hardest queries. We\u2019ve gotten some really positive feedback as we\u2019ve tested this on the \u201cWeb\u201d tab. So in\u2026\n\u2014 Robby Stein (@rmstein) August 25, 2025\nRelated: Google Web Guide: How It\u2019s Reshaping The SERP And What It Means For Your SEO Strategy\nWhy It Matters\nHow Google presents links in AI Mode can influence how people reach your site.\nPlacing carousels within the answer and adjusting inline placements differ from links that appear only below the response. This may change click behavior depending on the query and presentation.\nLooking Ahead\nGoogle is trying to strike a balance between innovation and supporting publishers. Expect continued testing around link density, placement, and labeling as Google refines AI mode.\nFeatured Image: subh_naskar/Shutterstock"

      "text": "Google is expanding AI Mode in Search with new tools that include PDF uploads, persistent planning documents, and real-time video assistance.\nThe updates begin rolling out today, with the AI Mode button now appearing on the Google homepage for desktop users.\nPDF Uploads Now Supported On Desktop\nDesktop users can now upload images directly into search queries, a feature previously available only on mobile.\nSupport for PDFs is coming in the weeks ahead, allowing you to ask questions about uploaded files and receive AI-generated responses based on both document content and relevant web results.\nFor example, a student could upload lecture slides and use AI Mode to get help understanding the material. Responses include suggested links for deeper exploration.\nGoogle plans to support additional file types and integrate with Google Drive \u201cin the months ahead.\u201d\nCanvas: A Tool For Multi-Session Planning\nA new AI Mode feature called Canvas can help you stay organized across multiple search sessions.\nWhen you ask AI Mode for help with planning or creating something, you\u2019ll see an option to \u201cCreate Canvas.\u201d This opens a dynamic side panel that saves and updates as queries evolve.\nUse cases include building study guides, travel itineraries, or task checklists.\nCanvas is launching for desktop users in the U.S. enrolled in the AI Mode Labs experiment.\nReal-Time Assistance With Search Live\nSearch Live with video input also launches this week on mobile. This allows you to utilize AI Mode while pointing your phone camera at real-world objects or scenes.\nThe feature builds on Project Astra and is available through Google Lens. Start by tapping the \u2018Live\u2019 icon in the Google app, then engage in back-and-forth conversations with AI Mode using live video as visual context.\nChrome Adds Contextual AI Answers\nLens is getting expanded desktop functionality within Chrome. Soon, you\u2019ll see a \u201cAsk Google about this page\u201d option in the address bar.\nWhen selected, it opens a panel where you can highlight parts of a page, like a diagram or snippet of text, and receive an AI Overview.\nThis update also allows follow-up questions via AI Mode from within the Lens experience, either through a button labeled \u201cDive deeper\u201d or by selecting AI Mode directly.\nLooking Ahead\nThese updates reflect Google\u2019s vision of search as a multi-modal, interactive experience rather than a one-off text query.\nWhile most of these tools are limited to U.S.-based Labs users for now, they point to a future where AI Mode becomes central to how searchers explore, learn, and plan.\nRollout timelines vary by feature. So keep a close eye on how these capabilities add to the search experience and consider how to adapt your content strategies accordingly."

      "text": "Google is adding agentic booking features to AI Mode in Search, beginning with restaurant reservations for U.S. Google AI Ultra subscribers enrolled in Labs.\nWhat\u2019s New\nBooking Reservations\nAI Mode can interpret a detailed request, check real-time availability across reservation sites, and link you to the booking page to complete the task.\nFor businesses, that shifts more discovery and conversion activity inside Google\u2019s surfaces.\nRobby Stein wrote on The Keyword:\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to roll out today with finding restaurant reservations, and expanding soon to local service appointments and event tickets.\u201d\nPlanning Features\nGoogle is introducing planning features that make results easier to share and tailor queries.\nIn the U.S., you can share an AI Mode response with others so they can ask follow-ups and continue research on their own, and you can revoke the link at any time.\nSeparately, U.S. users who opt in to the Labs experiment can receive personalized dining suggestions informed by prior conversations and interactions in Search and Maps, with controls in Google Account settings.\nHow It Works\nUnder the hood, Google cites live web browsing via Project Mariner, partner integrations, and signals from the Knowledge Graph and Maps.\nNamed partners include OpenTable, Resy, Tock, Ticketmaster, StubHub, SeatGeek, and Booksy. Dining is first; local services and ticketing are next on the roadmap.\nAvailability\nAvailability is gated. Agentic reservations are limited to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S. through the \u201cAgentic capabilities in AI Mode\u201d Labs experiment.\nPersonalization is U.S. and opt-in, with dining topics first. Link sharing is available in the U.S. Global access to AI Mode is expanding to more than 180 countries and territories in English, with additional languages planned.\nLooking Ahead\nAI Mode is moving from answer generation to task completion.\nIf your category relies on reservation or ticketing partners, verify inventory accuracy, hours, and policies now, and make sure your structured data and Business Profile attributes are clean.\nTrack how bookings and referrals appear in analytics as Google widens coverage to more tasks and regions."
