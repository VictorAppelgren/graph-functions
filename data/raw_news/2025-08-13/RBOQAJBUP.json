  "title": "Divorce Tax Planning After the One Big Beautiful Bill Act",
  "description": "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act introduced tax credits, higher deduction limits and a new way for kids to save. If you\u2019re divorced, see how you might be affected.",
  "content": "Taxes touch every family in all formats - single, married, separated, and divorced. The tax implications introduced by the One Big Beautiful Bill Tax Act (OBBBA or the Act), signed into law on July 4th, 2025, have far-reaching implications, especially for families navigating the complexities of divorce.\n\nWe will review three provisions from the Act that could impact separated and divorced families with dependent children. Further below, we'll break down two changes made to itemized deductions - these may have an impact on your return regardless of dependent status.\n\nBefore diving into the details, it\u2019s important to understand two foundational concepts that influence how the changes may apply to you:\n\u2022 Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) - Many deductions and credits are subject to income thresholds based on your AGI or MAGI. AGI can be found on line 11 of your tax return Form 1040 and includes all income sources minus deductions such as eligible IRA or HSA contributions. Your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is your adjusted gross income with some of these adjustments added back. MAGI is calculated differently for each benefit.\n\u2022 Tax filing status - Whether you file as Single, Head of Household (HOH), Married Filing Jointly (MFJ), or Married Filing Separately (MFS) affects your eligibility for various benefits as they frequently impact the income thresholds.\n\nFor personalized advice, please consult your wealth planning team and a qualified tax professional.\n\nNow, let\u2019s discuss three specific provisions that may impact you and your family.\n\nWhile no dollar amount can quantify the value of care you provide, the Child Tax Credit (CTC) is designed to help offset some of the costs associated with raising children under the age 17 at the end of the tax year.\n\nThe Act increases the CTC from $2,000 to $2,200, indexed for inflation, starting in 2025. While $200 may not appear to be a dramatic increase, keep in mind that tax credits generally offer more tax reduction than deductions.\n\nThe CTC credit is subject to income limitations. Single and Head of Households filers are phased out by $50 for each $1,000 that a taxpayer\u2019s MAGI is over $200,000. Similarly, for joint filers, the credit begins to phase out at the same rate with MAGI over $400,000. For more information on the phase out and potentially refundable portion of the CTC, review the IRS\u2019s webpage.\n\nIf separated or divorced, typically the custodial parent claims the CTC, but the custodial parents may sign a release to allow the non-custodial parent to claim the credit. Generally, the custodial parent is the parent with whom the child lives with for the majority of nights during the tax year. If the child spends an equal number of nights with each parent, the parent with the higher AGI typically claims the CTC. For more information, consider reviewing the following IRS resources below. Additionally, contemplate the potential implications of the CTC in child support settlement agreements.\n\u2022 Support Test for Children of Divorced or Separated Parents (or Parents Who Live Apart):\n\nStarting in 2026, the maximum Dependent Care Flexible Savings Account (DCFSA) contribution increases from $5,000 to $7,500 a year. DCFSAs allow for pre-tax savings to pay for eligible dependent care services, and could potentially reduce your tax burden. The increased contribution limit could be especially helpful for single or divorced parents managing childcare costs independently.\n\nFor example, imagine a single parent in the 22% marginal tax bracket. By maximizing contribution to the DCFSA, they could reduce their taxable income by $7,500 and potentially save up to $1,650 in taxes ($7,500*22%).\n\nTo promote savings and financial stability for young Americans, in 2026, individuals will have access to a new savings tool for minors called \u201cTrump Accounts.\u201d These accounts are expected to be rolled out as soon as January 2026, with participating financial institutions. For children born in 2025 through 2028, the Federal Government is seeding the account with a $1,000 grant.\n\nAdditionally, up to $5,000 of after-tax dollars can be contributed annually to the Trump Account per beneficiary under the age of 18, and practically anyone can contribute to the custodial account. Unlike an individual retirement account (IRA), the minor is not required to have earned income to make or receive contributions. In fact, even employers are eligible to contribute up to $2,500 to their employees\u2019 accounts. The funds contributed by an employer are not counted as earned income to the minor, but the employer\u2019s contribution does count towards the $5,000 annual contribution limit.\n\nThe funds will be invested in an index fund that tracks the S&P 500, and withdrawals are prohibited before the beneficiary is 18. When the funds are withdrawn for eligible expenses, the investment growth is taxed at capital gains rates rather than ordinary income tax rates, which are typically more favorable. Expenses related to education, homeownership, or entrepreneurship, are generally qualified expenses.\n\nThe creation of these accounts could provide a timely opportunity to discuss your children\u2019s financial futures. Additionally, these accounts could potentially be a strategic tool in divorce settlements, especially when planning for a child\u2019s future education or financial security.\n\nIn addition to the changes mentioned above, there are two provisions that have the potential to increase your deductions if you itemize or could factor into your decision to itemize vs. taking the standard deduction this tax year.\n\nPrior to the passage of the Act, the SALT deduction was limited to $10,000 with no income cap. Effective in 2025, the Act increases the SALT deduction from $10,000 to $40,000 (up to $20,000 for MFS), subject to earning limits. In 2030, barring congressional action, the maximum SALT deduction will be reset to $10,000.\n\nFor those who earn less than $500,000 annually, a full $40,000 deduction could be available. If earnings are between $500,001 and $600,000, the deduction is reduced. If income exceeds $600,000, the deduction reverts to the $10,000 cap.\n\nFor example, if an individual is in the 24% tax bracket and owes approximately $25,000 in federal taxes, and their state and local income taxes total around $15,000, then the SALT deduction could result in roughly $3,600 in tax savings ($15,000 x 24%), if they itemize their tax deductions. This tax change may affect the division of marital property and tax strategy.\n\nOther provisions that may affect decisions around property are the changes to the mortgage interest deduction.\n\nUnlike the SALT deduction, the mortgage interest deduction is not affected by income\n\nlevel or filing status. Instead, it is limited by the size of the mortgage on qualifying homes. The mortgage interest deduction applies to both primary and second homes, provided they meet IRS qualifications.\n\nUntil further congressional action, the Act codifies that taxpayers who itemize could deduct interest paid on their mortgage(s) of $750,000 or less ($375,000 if MFS). For example, if a Single filer has a $1,000,000 mortgage that started in in 2018, they could potentially deduct up to 75% of the interest paid for the year ((750,000/1,000,000)*100) = 75%). If the interest rate were 5%, the filer could possibly deduct up to $37,500 (750,000*5%) of interest expenses for the year.\n\nFor families going through a divorce, the possible deduction could be an important consideration, especially when dividing residences. A Wealth Advisor and tax professional can help estimate the long-term value of this deduction and guide decisions around refinancing, buyouts, or property transfers.\n\nFrom enhanced credits, expanded savings opportunities, and revised deductions, understanding how the Act applies to your unique situation is key to making informed, strategic decisions that support you and your family. What provisions from the OBBBA may make the biggest impact on you and your financial future?",

      "text": "The following are questions preparers frequently ask about who may claim the EITC if the child's parents are divorced, separated or live apart at all times during the last 6 months of the calendar year.\nGenerally, only one person may claim the child as a qualifying child for purposes of the head of household filing status, the child tax credit/credit for other dependents, the dependent care credit/exclusion for dependent care benefits, the dependency exemption and the EITC.\nThere is a special rule for divorced or separated parents or parents living apart for the last 6 months of the calendar year. A parent who has custody of the child (custodial parent) may provide the parent without custody (noncustodial parent) with a written declaration granting the noncustodial parent ability to claim dependency exemption and the child tax credit/credit for other dependents. If the requirements of the special rule are satisfied, then the child is treated as the qualifying child of the noncustodial parent for purposes of the child tax credit or credit for other dependents and the dependency exemption. However, only the custodial parent can claim the head of household filing status, the dependent care credit/exclusion for dependent care benefits, and the EITC for the child, under the general rules.\nFor more information, see Applying the tiebreaker rules to divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart) in Publication 501 and Special rule for divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart) in Publication 596. Generally, the custodial parent is the parent who has physical custody of the child for the greater portion of the calendar year. See Publication 501, Dependents, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information, for more information.\nThe parents may only alternate claiming the EITC from year to year if they change the pattern of who has physical custody of the child each year. To be a qualifying child of a taxpayer for the EITC, the child must meet a residency test that includes living with the taxpayer in the United States for more than half of the year. The special rule for divorced or separated parents allows only the noncustodial parent to claim the child as a dependent for the purposes of the child tax credit/credit for other dependents and the dependency exemption and does not apply to the EITC. For more information, see Publication 501, Dependents, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information.\nYour client is probably not properly claiming the EITC. If parents are divorced and do not live together, the custodial parent may sign a release which allows the noncustodial parent to claim the child as a dependent and claim the child tax credit/credit for other dependents for the child, and dependency exemption, if the requirements are met.\nTo claim the EITC, generally, the child must have lived with the taxpayer in the United States for more than half of the year. If the residency requirement for a qualifying child is not met, your client may not claim his son as a qualifying child for the EITC.\nIf your client meets the income test and other requirements, they may be able to claim the self-only EITC.\nTo document that a child meets the residency requirement to be a qualifying child for the EITC, refer to Form 886-H-EIC PDF. The form is also available in Spanish PDF. The IRS sends this form with audit letters. The form has information on the documentation the IRS accepts to prove age, relationship, and residency.\nAs a preparer, you are not required to review a copy of the documentation but informing your client about what's needed in case of an audit is a best practice. If you do review a document and use the information to determine eligibility for or to compute the amount of the EITC, you must keep a copy of the document in your records.\nWhile in this situation, the children lived with each parent for more than half the year and all other requirements were met for them to be the qualifying children of both parents for the year, the spouses may claim the EITC only if they file a joint return because they don\u2019t meet the special rule that allows married but separated spouses to claim the EITC without filing a joint return. The special rule requires that the taxpayer either lived apart from their spouse for the last 6 months of the year, or that the taxpayer was legally separated according to their state law under a written separation agreement or a decree of separate maintenance and lived apart from their spouse at the end of the year. See Publication 596, Earned Income Credit PDF.\nBecause the couple in this example is still married, did not live apart for the last 6 months of the year, and was not legally separated under state law, neither spouse is eligible to claim the EITC unless they file a joint return with their spouse.\nA married taxpayer may claim the EITC without filing a joint return with their spouse if they lived with a qualifying child for more than half of the year and meet either of the following two requirements:\n- The taxpayer lived apart from their spouse for the last 6 months of the year, or\n- Was legally separated according to state law under a written separation agreement or a degree of separate maintenance and lived apart from their spouse at the end of the year\nSee Publication 596, Earned Income Credit PDF, for more information.\nThe IRS no longer accepts a copy of a divorce decree to show who has the right to claim a child as a dependent if the decree was executed after December 31, 2008. A noncustodial parent who claims the child as a dependent must file Form 8332 or a substantially similar statement with the return or, with Form 8453 for an electronic return.\nIf the divorce decree was executed before January 1, 2009, the IRS may accept certain pages of the divorce decree as a substitute for a Form 8332 if the decree unconditionally provides that the noncustodial parent may claim the child as a dependent, the custodial parent signs the decree, and the decree otherwise conforms to the substance of Form 8332."

It answers some basic questions: who must file, who should file, what filing status to use, who qualifies as a dependent, and the amount of the standard deduction.\nWho Must File explains who must file an income tax return. If you have little or no gross income, reading this section will help you decide if you have to file a return.\nWho Should File helps you decide if you should file a return, even if you aren't required to do so.\nFiling Status helps you determine which filing status to use. Filing status is important in determining whether you must file a return and whether you may claim certain deductions and credits. It also helps determine your standard deduction and tax rate.\nDependents explains the difference between a qualifying child and a qualifying relative. Other topics include the SSN requirement for dependents, the rules for multiple support agreements, and the rules for divorced or separated parents.\nStandard Deduction gives the rules and dollar amounts for the standard deduction\u2014a benefit for taxpayers who don't itemize their deductions. This section also discusses the standard deduction for taxpayers who are blind or age 65 or older, as well as special rules that limit the standard deduction available to dependents. In addition, this section helps you decide whether you would be better off taking the standard deduction or itemizing your deductions.\nHow To Get Tax Help explains how to get tax help from the IRS.\nThis publication is for U.S. citizens and resident aliens only. If you are a resident alien for the entire year, you must follow the same tax rules that apply to U.S. citizens. The rules to determine if you are a resident or nonresident alien are discussed in chapter 1 of Pub. 519.\nNonresident aliens.\nIf you were a nonresident alien at any time during the year, the rules and tax forms that apply to you may be different from those that apply to U.S. citizens.

For details, see Table 1 and Table 2. You must also file if one of the situations described in Table 3 applies. The filing requirements apply even if you owe no tax.\n| IF your filing status is... | AND at the end of 2024 you were...* | THEN file a return if your gross income was at least...** |\n| single | under 65 | $14,600 |\n| 65 or older | $16,550 | |\n| head of household | under 65 | $21,900 |\n| 65 or older | $23,850 | |\n| married filing jointly*** | under 65 (both spouses) | $29,200 |\n| 65 or older (one spouse) | $30,750 | |\n| 65 or older (both spouses) | $32,300 | |\n| married filing separately | any age | $5 |\n| qualifying surviving spouse | under 65 | $29,200 |\n| 65 or older | $30,750 | |\n| * If you were born before January 2, 1960, you're considered to be 65 or older at the end of 2024. (If your spouse died in 2024, see Death of spouse, later. If you're preparing a return for someone who died in 2024, see Death of taxpayer, later.) | ||\n| ** Gross income means all income you receive in the form of money, goods, property, and services that isn't exempt from tax, including any income from sources outside the United States or from the sale of your main home (even if you can exclude part or all of it). Don't include any social security benefits unless (a) you're married filing a separate return and you lived with your spouse at any time during 2024, or (b) one-half of your social security benefits plus your other gross income and any tax-exempt interest is more than $25,000 ($32,000 if married filing jointly). If (a) or (b) applies, see the Form 1040 and 1040-SR instructions to figure the taxable part of social security benefits you must include in gross income. Gross income includes gains, but not losses, reported on Form 8949 or Schedule D. Gross income from a business means, for example, the amount on Schedule C, line 7; or Schedule F, line 9. But in figuring gross income, don't reduce your income by any losses, including any loss on Schedule C, line 7; or Schedule F, line 9. | ||\n| *** If you didn't live with your spouse at the end of 2024 (or on the date your spouse died) and your gross income was at least $5, you must file a return regardless of your age. |\nYou may have to pay a penalty if you are required to file a return but fail to do so. If you willfully fail to file a return, you may be subject to criminal prosecution.\nGross income.\nGross income is all income you receive in the form of money, goods, property, and services that isn't exempt from tax. If you are married and live with your spouse in a community property state, half of any income defined by state law as community income may be considered yours. For a list of community property states, see Community property states under Married Filing Separately, later.\nSelf-employed persons.\nIf you are self-employed in a business that provides services (where products aren't a factor), your gross income from that business is the gross receipts. If you are self-employed in a business involving manufacturing, merchandising, or mining, your gross income from that business is the total sales minus the cost of goods sold. In either case, you must add any income from investments and from incidental or outside operations or sources.\nFiling status.\nYour filing status generally depends on whether you are single or married. Whether you are single or married is determined at the end of your tax year, which is December 31 for most taxpayers. Filing status is discussed in detail later in this publication.\nAge.\nAge is a factor in determining if you must file a return only if you are 65 or older at the end of your tax year. For 2024, you are 65 or older if you were born before January 2, 1960.\nFiling Requirements for Most Taxpayers\nYou must file a return if your gross income for the year was at least the amount shown on the appropriate line in Table 1. Dependents should see Table 2 instead.\nYou must file an income tax return for a decedent (a person who died) if both of the following are true.\n-\nYour spouse died, or you are the executor, administrator, or legal representative.\n-\nThe decedent met the filing requirements described in this publication at the time of the decedent\u2019s death.\nFor more information, see Final Income Tax Return for Decedent\u2014Form 1040 or 1040-SR in Pub. 559.\nDeath of spouse.\nIf your spouse died in 2024, read this before using Table 1 or Table 2 to find whether you must file a 2024 return. Consider your spouse to be 65 or older at the end of 2024 only if your spouse was 65 or older at the time of death. Even if your spouse was born before January 2, 1960, your spouse isn't considered 65 or older at the end of 2024 unless your spouse was 65 or older at the time of death.\nA person is considered to reach age 65 on the day before the person\u2019s 65th birthday.\nExample.\nYour spouse was born on February 14, 1959, and died on February 13, 2024. Your spouse is considered age 65 at the time of death. However, if your spouse died on February 12, 2024, your spouse isn't considered age 65 at the time of death and is not 65 or older at the end of 2024.\nDeath of taxpayer.\nIf you are preparing a return for someone who died in 2024, read this before using Table 1 or Table 2. Consider the taxpayer to be 65 or older at the end of 2024 only if the taxpayer was 65 or older at the time of death. Even if the taxpayer was born before January 2, 1960, the taxpayer isn't considered 65 or older at the end of 2024 unless the taxpayer was 65 or older at the time of death.\nA person is considered to reach age 65 on the day before the person\u2019s 65th birthday.\nSee Dependents to find out if you are a dependent. |\n| If your parent (or someone else) can claim you as a dependent, use this table to see if you must file a return. | |\nIn this table, unearned income includes taxable interest, ordinary dividends, and capital gain distributions. It also includes unemployment compensation, taxable social security benefits, pensions, annuities, and distributions of unearned income from a trust. Earned income includes salaries, wages, tips, professional fees, and taxable scholarship and fellowship grants. Gross income is the total of your unearned and earned income. |\n|\n| If your gross income was $5,050 or more, you usually can't be claimed as a dependent unless you are a qualifying child. For details, see Dependents. | |\n| Single dependents\u2014Were you either age 65 or older or blind? | |\n| \u25a1 | No. You must file a return if any of the following apply.\n|\n| \u25a1 | Yes. You must file a return if any of the following apply.\n|\n| Married dependents\u2014Were you either age 65 or older or blind? | |\n| \u25a1 | No. You must file a return if any of the following apply.\n|\n| \u25a1 | Yes. You must file a return if any of the following apply.\n|\nTo determine whether you must file a return, include in your gross income any income you earned or received abroad, including any income you can exclude under the foreign earned income exclusion. For more information on special tax rules that may apply to you, see Pub. 54.\nIf you are a U.S. citizen and also a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico, you must generally file a U.S. income tax return for any year in which you meet the income requirements. This is in addition to any legal requirement you may have to file an income tax return with Puerto Rico.\nIf you are a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico for the whole year, your U.S. gross income doesn't include income from sources within Puerto Rico. It does, however, include any income you received for your services as an employee of the United States or any U.S. agency. If you receive income from Puerto Rican sources that isn't subject to U.S. tax, you must reduce your standard deduction, which reduces the amount of income you can have before you must file a U.S. income tax return.\nFor more information, see Pub. 570.\nIf you had income from Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, or the U.S. Virgin Islands, special rules may apply when determining whether you must file a U.S. federal income tax return. In addition, you may have to file a return with the individual territory government. See Pub. 570 for more information.\nDependents\nA person who is a dependent may still have to file a return. It depends on the person\u2019s earned income, unearned income, and gross income. For details, see Table 2. A dependent must also file if one of the situations described in Table 3 applies.\nResponsibility of parent.\nIf a dependent child must file an income tax return but can't file due to age or any other reason, a parent, guardian, or other legally responsible person must file it for the child. If the child can't sign the return, the parent or guardian must sign the child's name followed by the words \u201cBy (your signature), parent for minor child.\u201d\nEarned income.\nEarned income includes salaries, wages, professional fees, and other amounts received as pay for work you actually perform. Earned income (only for purposes of filing requirements and the standard deduction) also includes any part of a taxable scholarship. See chapter 1 of Pub. 970 for more information on taxable and nontaxable scholarships.\nChild's earnings.\nAmounts a child earns by performing services are included in the child\u2019s gross income and not the gross income of the parent. This is true even if under local law the child's parent has the right to the earnings and may actually have received them. But if the child doesn't pay the tax due on this income, the parent is liable for the tax.\nUnearned income.\nUnearned income includes income such as interest, dividends, and capital gains. Trust distributions of interest, dividends, capital gains, and survivor annuities are also considered unearned income.\nElection to report child's unearned income on parent's return.\nYou may be able to include your child's interest and dividend income on your tax return. If you do this, your child won't have to file a return. To make this election, all of the following conditions must be met.\n-\nYour child was under age 19 (or under age 24 if a student) at the end of 2024. (A child born on January 1, 2006, is considered to be age 19 at the end of 2024; you can't make the election for this child unless the child was a student. Similarly, a child born on January 1, 2001, is considered to be age 24 at the end of 2024; you can't make the election for this child.)\n-\nYour child had gross income only from interest and dividends (including capital gain distributions and Alaska Permanent Fund dividends).\n-\nThe interest and dividend income was less than $13,000.\n-\nYour child is required to file a return for 2024 unless you make this election.\n-\nYour child doesn't file a joint return for 2024.\n-\nNo estimated tax payment was made for 2024 and no 2023 overpayment was applied to 2024 under your child's name and SSN.\n-\nNo federal income tax was withheld from your child's income under the backup withholding rules.\n-\nYou are the parent whose return must be used when making the election to report your child's unearned income.\nFor more information, see Form 8814, Parents\u2019 Election To Report Child\u2019s Interest and Dividends, and its instructions.\nOther Situations\nYou may have to file a tax return even if your gross income is less than the amount shown in Table 1 or Table 2 for your filing status. See Table 3 for those other situations when you must file.\nWho Should File\nEven if you don't have to file, you should file a tax return if you can get money back. For example, you should file if one of the following applies.\n-\nYou had income tax withheld from your pay.\n-\nYou made estimated tax payments for the year or had any of your overpayment for last year applied to this year's estimated tax.\n-\nYou qualify for the earned income credit. See Pub. 596 for more information.\n-\nYou qualify for the additional child tax credit. See Schedule 8812 (Form 1040) for more information.\n-\nYou qualify for the refundable American opportunity credit. See Form 8863.\n-\nYou qualify for the premium tax credit. See Form 8962.\nForm 1099-B received.\nEven if you aren't required to file a return, you should consider filing if all of the following apply.\n-\nYou received a Form 1099-B, Proceeds From Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions (or substitute statement).\n-\nThe amount in box 1d of Form 1099-B (or substitute statement), when added to your other gross income, means you have to file a tax return because of the filing requirement in Table 1 or Table 2 that applies to you.\n-\nBox 1e of Form 1099-B (or substitute statement) is blank.\nFiling Status\nYou must determine your filing status before you can determine whether you must file a tax return, your standard deduction (discussed later), and your tax. You also use your filing status to determine whether you are eligible to claim certain other deductions and credits.\nThere are five filing statuses.\n-\nSingle.\n-\nMarried filing jointly.\n-\nMarried filing separately.\n-\nHead of household.\n-\nQualifying surviving spouse.\nMarital Status\nIn general, your filing status depends on whether you are considered unmarried or married.\nUnmarried persons.\nYou are considered unmarried for the whole year if, on the last day of your tax year, you are either:\n-\nUnmarried, or\n-\nLegally separated from your spouse under a divorce or separate maintenance decree.\nState law governs whether you are married or legally separated under a divorce or separate maintenance decree.\nDefinition of marriage.\nA marriage of two individuals is recognized for federal tax purposes if the marriage is recognized by the state or territory of the United States in which the marriage is entered into, regardless of legal residence. Two individuals who enter into a relationship that is denominated as marriage under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction or an American Indian tribe are recognized as married for federal tax purposes if the relationship would be recognized as marriage under the laws of at least one state or territory of the United States, regardless of legal residence. Individuals who have entered into a registered domestic partnership, civil union, or other similar relationship that isn\u2019t denominated as a marriage under the law of the state or territory of the United States where such relationship was entered into aren\u2019t lawfully married for federal tax purposes, regardless of legal residence. See Considered married, next.\nDivorced persons.\nIf you are divorced under a final decree by the last day of the year, you are considered unmarried for the whole year.\nDivorce and remarriage.\nIf you obtain a divorce for the sole purpose of filing tax returns as unmarried individuals, and at the time of divorce you intend to and do, in fact, remarry each other in the next tax year, you and your spouse must file as married individuals in both years.\nAnnulled marriages.\nIf you obtain a court decree of annulment, which holds that no valid marriage ever existed, you are considered unmarried even if you filed joint returns for earlier years. File amended returns (Form(s) 1040-X) claiming single or head of household status for all tax years that are affected by the annulment and not closed by the statute of limitations for filing a tax return. Generally, for a credit or refund, you must file Form(s) 1040-X within 3 years (including extensions) after the date you filed your original return or within 2 years after the date you paid the tax, whichever is later. If you filed your original tax return early (for example, March 1), your return is considered filed on the due date (generally April 15). However, if you had an extension to file (for example, until October 15) but you filed earlier and we received it on July 1, your return is considered filed on July 1.\nHead of household or qualifying surviving spouse.\nIf you are considered unmarried, you may be able to file as head of household or as a qualifying surviving spouse. See Head of Household and Qualifying Surviving Spouse, later, to see if you qualify.\nMarried persons.\nIf you are considered married, you and your spouse can file a joint return or separate returns.\nConsidered married.\nYou are considered married for the whole year if, on the last day of your tax year, you and your spouse meet any one of the following tests.\n-\nYou are married and living together.\n-\nYou are living together in a common law marriage recognized in the state where you now live or in the state where the common law marriage began.\n-\nYou are married and living apart but not legally separated under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance.\n-\nYou are separated under an interlocutory (not final) decree of divorce.\nSpouse died during the year.\nIf your spouse died during the year, you are considered married for the whole year for filing status purposes.\nIf you didn't remarry before the end of the tax year, you can file a joint return for yourself and your deceased spouse. For the next 2 years, you may be entitled to the special benefits described later under Qualifying Surviving Spouse.\nIf you remarried before the end of the tax year, you can file a joint return with your new spouse. Your deceased spouse's filing status is married filing separately for that year.\nMarried persons living apart.\nIf you live apart from your spouse and meet certain tests, you may be able to file as head of household even if you aren't divorced or legally separated. If you qualify to file as head of household instead of as married filing separately, your standard deduction will be higher and your tax may be lower. See Head of Household, later.\nSingle\nYour filing status is single if you are considered unmarried and you don't qualify for another filing status. To determine your marital status, see Marital Status, earlier.\nSpouse died before January 1, 2024.\nYour filing status may be single if your spouse died before January 1, 2024, and you didn't remarry before the end of 2024. You may, however, be able to use another filing status that will give you a lower tax. See Head of Household and Qualifying Surviving Spouse, later, to see if you qualify.\nOn Form 1040 or 1040-SR, show your filing status as single by checking the \u201cSingle\u201d box on the Filing Status line near the top of the form. Use the Single column of the Tax Table, or Section A of the Tax Computation Worksheet, to figure your tax.\nMarried Filing Jointly\nYou can choose married filing jointly as your filing status if you are considered married and both you and your spouse agree to file a joint return. On a joint return, you and your spouse report your combined income and deduct your combined allowable expenses. You can file a joint return even if one of you had no income or deductions.\nIf you and your spouse decide to file a joint return, your tax may be lower than your combined tax for the other filing statuses. Also, your standard deduction (if you don't itemize deductions) may be higher, and you may qualify for tax benefits that don't apply to other filing statuses.\nOn Form 1040 or 1040-SR, show your filing status as married filing jointly by checking the \u201cMarried filing jointly\u201d box on the Filing Status line near the top of the form. Use the Married filing jointly column of the Tax Table, or Section B of the Tax Computation Worksheet, to figure your tax.\n.If you and your spouse each have income, you may want to figure your tax both on a joint return and on separate returns (using the filing status of married filing separately). You can choose the method that gives the two of you the lower combined tax unless you are required to file separately..\nSpouse died.\nIf your spouse died during the year, you are considered married for the whole year and can choose married filing jointly as your filing status. See Spouse died during the year under Married persons, earlier.\nIf your spouse died in 2025 before filing a 2024 return, you can choose married filing jointly as your filing status on your 2024 return.\nDivorced persons.\nIf you are divorced under a final decree by the last day of the year, you are considered unmarried for the whole year and you can't choose married filing jointly as your filing status.\nBoth you and your spouse must include all of your income and deductions on your joint return.\nAccounting period.\nBoth of you must use the same accounting period, but you can use different accounting methods.\nJoint responsibility.\nBoth of you may be held responsible, jointly and individually, for the tax and any interest or penalty due on your joint return. This means that if one spouse doesn't pay the tax due, the other may have to. Or, if one spouse doesn't report the correct tax, both spouses may be responsible for any additional taxes assessed by the IRS. One spouse may be held responsible for all the tax due even if all the income was earned by the other spouse.\nYou may want to file separately if:\n-\nYou believe your spouse isn't reporting all of their income, or\n-\nYou don't want to be responsible for any taxes due if your spouse doesn't have enough tax withheld or doesn't pay enough estimated tax.\nDivorced taxpayer.\nYou may be held jointly and individually responsible for any tax, interest, and penalties due on a joint return filed before your divorce. This responsibility may apply even if your divorce decree states that your former spouse will be responsible for any amounts due on previously filed joint returns.\nRelief from joint responsibility.\nIn some cases, one spouse may be relieved of joint responsibility for tax, interest, and penalties on a joint return for items of the other spouse that were incorrectly reported on the joint return. You can ask for relief no matter how small the liability.\nThere are three types of relief available.\n-\nInnocent spouse relief.\n-\nSeparation of liability (available only to joint filers whose spouse has died, or who are divorced, who are legally separated, or who haven't lived together for the 12 months ending on the date the election for this relief is filed).\n-\nEquitable relief.\nYou must file Form 8857, Request for Innocent Spouse Relief, to request relief from joint responsibility. Pub. 971 explains the kinds of relief and who may qualify for them.\nSigning a joint return.\nFor a return to be considered a joint return, both spouses must generally sign the return.\nSpouse died before signing.\nIf your spouse died before signing the return, the executor or administrator must sign the return for your spouse. If neither you nor anyone else has been appointed as executor or administrator, you can sign the return for your spouse and enter \u201cFiling as surviving spouse\u201d in the area where you sign the return.\nSpouse away from home.\nIf your spouse is away from home, you should prepare the return, sign it, and send it to your spouse to sign so it can be filed on time.\nInjury or disease prevents signing.\nIf your spouse can't sign because of injury or disease and tells you to sign for them, you can sign your spouse's name in the proper space on the return followed by the words \u201cBy (your name), Spouse.\u201d Be sure to sign in the space provided for your signature. Attach a dated statement, signed by you, to the return. The statement should include the form number of the return you are filing, the tax year, and the reason your spouse can't sign, and it should state that your spouse has agreed to your signing for them.\nSigning as guardian of spouse.\nIf you are the guardian of your spouse who is mentally incompetent, you can sign the return for your spouse as guardian.\nSpouse in combat zone.\nYou can sign a joint return for your spouse if your spouse can't sign because they are serving in a combat zone (such as the Persian Gulf area, Serbia, Montenegro, Albania, or Afghanistan), even if you don't have a power of attorney or other statement. Attach a signed statement to your return explaining that your spouse is serving in a combat zone. For more information on special tax rules for persons who are serving in a combat zone, or who are in missing status as a result of serving in a combat zone, see Pub. 3.\nPower of attorney (POA).\nIn order for you to sign a return for your spouse in any of these cases, you must attach to the return a POA that authorizes you to sign for your spouse. You can use a POA that states that you have been granted authority to sign the return, or you can use Form 2848. Part I of Form 2848 must state that you are granted authority to sign the return.\nNonresident alien or dual-status alien.\nGenerally, a married couple can't file a joint return if either spouse is a nonresident alien at any time during the year. However, you and your spouse can choose to be treated as U.S. residents for the entire year and file a joint return if one spouse was a nonresident alien at the end of the taxable year (the nonresident spouse) and the other was a U.S. citizen or resident at the end of the taxable year. This choice remains in effect in subsequent years until terminated. You and your spouse can also choose to file as U.S. residents for the entire year if both of you are U.S. citizens or residents at the end of the year and either (or both) of you were a nonresident at the beginning of the year (the dual-status spouse(s)). You can only make this choice for 1 year, and it doesn\u2019t apply to any future years.\nIf you and your spouse are making either of these choices to be treated as U.S. residents for 2024, check the box in the Filing Status section and enter the name of the nonresident spouse or dual-status spouse(s) (whichever applies to you) in the entry space. Also check the box and enter their name if you and your nonresident spouse made the choice to be treated as residents in a prior year and the choice remains in effect. See the Instructions for Form 1040 and Pub. 519 for more information on how to make this choice.\nMarried Filing Separately\nYou can choose married filing separately as your filing status if you are married. This filing status may benefit you if you want to be responsible only for your own tax or if it results in less tax than filing a joint return.\nIf you and your spouse don't agree to file a joint return, you must use this filing status unless you qualify for head of household status, discussed later.\nYou may be able to choose head of household filing status if you are considered unmarried because you live apart from your spouse and meet certain tests (explained later under Head of Household). This can apply to you even if you aren't divorced or legally separated. If you qualify to file as head of household, instead of as married filing separately, your tax may be lower, you may be able to claim certain tax benefits, and your standard deduction will be higher. The head of household filing status allows you to choose the standard deduction even if your spouse chooses to itemize deductions. See Head of Household, later, for more information.\n.You will generally pay more combined tax on separate returns than you would on a joint return for the reasons listed under Special Rules, later. However, unless you are required to file separately, you should figure your tax both ways (on a joint return and on separate returns). This way, you can make sure you are using the filing status that results in the lowest combined tax. When figuring the combined tax of a married couple, you may want to consider state taxes as well as federal taxes..\nHow to file.\nIf you file a separate return, you generally report only your own income, credits, and deductions.\nSelect this filing status by checking the \u201cMarried filing separately\u201d box on the Filing Status line near the top of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Enter your spouse's full name in the entry space at the bottom of the Filing Status section and enter your spouse's SSN or ITIN in the space for spouse's SSN on Form 1040 or 1040-SR. If your spouse doesn't have and isn't required to have an SSN or ITIN, enter \u201cNRA\u201d in the entry space below the filing status checkboxes. For electronic filing, enter the spouse's name or \u201cNRA\u201d if the spouse doesn't have an SSN or ITIN in the entry space below the filing status checkboxes. Use the Married filing separately column of the Tax Table, or Section C of the Tax Computation Worksheet, to figure your tax.\nIf you choose married filing separately as your filing status, the following special rules apply. Because of these special rules, you usually pay more tax on a separate return than if you use another filing status you qualify for.\n-\nYour tax rate is generally higher than on a joint return.\n-\nYour exemption amount for figuring the alternative minimum tax is half that allowed on a joint return.\n-\nYou can't take the credit for child and dependent care expenses in most cases, and the amount you can exclude from income under an employer's dependent care assistance program is limited to $2,500 (instead of $5,000 on a joint return). However, if you are legally separated or living apart from your spouse, you may be able to file a separate return and still take the credit. See What\u2019s Your Filing Status? in Pub. 503 for more information.\n-\nYou can't take the earned income credit unless you have a qualifying child and meet certain other requirements.\n-\nYou can't take the exclusion or credit for adoption expenses in most cases.\n-\nYou can't take the education credits (the American opportunity credit and lifetime learning credit), or the deduction for student loan interest.\n-\nYou can't exclude any interest income from qualified U.S. savings bonds you used for higher education expenses.\n-\nIf you lived with your spouse at any time during the tax year:\n-\nYou can't claim the credit for the elderly or the disabled, and\n-\nYou must include in income a greater percentage (up to 85%) of any social security or equivalent railroad retirement benefits you received.\n-\n-\nThe following credits and deductions are reduced at income levels half those for a joint return.\n-\nThe child tax credit and the credit for other dependents.\n-\nThe retirement savings contributions credit.\n-\n-\nYour capital loss deduction limit is $1,500 (instead of $3,000 on a joint return).\n-\nIf your spouse itemizes deductions, you can't claim the standard deduction. If you can claim the standard deduction, your basic standard deduction is half the amount allowed on a joint return.\n.There are special rules that allow a separated spouse to claim the earned income credit under certain circumstances. See the line 27 instructions in the Instructions for Form 1040 and Schedule EIC (Form 1040) to see if you meet the qualifications to claim the earned income credit even though you are married and don\u2019t file a joint return..\nAdjusted gross income (AGI) limits.\nIf your AGI on a separate return is lower than it would have been on a joint return, you may be able to deduct a larger amount for certain deductions that are limited by AGI, such as medical expenses.\nIndividual retirement arrangements (IRAs).\nYou may not be able to deduct all or part of your contributions to a traditional IRA if you or your spouse was covered by an employee retirement plan at work during the year. Your deduction is reduced or eliminated if your income is more than a certain amount. This amount is much lower for married individuals who file separately and lived together at any time during the year. For more information, see How Much Can You Deduct? in chapter 1 of Pub. 590-A.\nRental activity losses.\nIf you actively participated in a passive rental real estate activity that produced a loss, you can generally deduct the loss from your nonpassive income up to $25,000. This is called a special allowance. However, married persons filing separate returns who lived together at any time during the year can't claim this special allowance. Married persons filing separate returns who lived apart at all times during the year are each allowed a $12,500 maximum special allowance for losses from passive real estate activities. See Rental Activities in Pub. 925.\nCommunity property states.\nCommunity property states include Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. If you live in a community property state and file separately, your income may be considered separate income or community income for income tax purposes. See Pub. 555.\nYou can change your filing status from a separate return to a joint return by filing an amended return using Form 1040-X.\nYou can generally change to a joint return any time within 3 years from the due date of the separate return or returns. This doesn't include any extensions. A separate return includes a return filed by you or your spouse claiming married filing separately, single, or head of household filing status.\nOnce you file a joint return, you can't choose to file separate returns for that year after the due date of the return.\nException.\nA personal representative for a decedent can change from a joint return elected by the surviving spouse to a separate return for the decedent. The personal representative has 1 year from the due date (including extensions) of the return to make the change. See Pub. 559 for more information on filing income tax returns for a decedent.\nHead of Household\nYou may be able to file as head of household if you meet all the following requirements.\n-\nYou are unmarried or considered unmarried on the last day of the year. See Marital Status, earlier, and Considered Unmarried, later.\n-\nYou paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home for the year.\n-\nA qualifying person lived with you in the home for more than half the year (except for temporary absences, such as school). However, if the qualifying person is your dependent parent, your dependent parent doesn't have to live with you. See Special rule for parent, later, under Qualifying Person.\n.If you qualify to file as head of household, your tax rate will usually be lower than the rates for single or married filing separately. You will also receive a higher standard deduction than if you file as single or married filing separately..\nHow to file.\nIndicate your choice of this filing status by checking the \u201cHead of household\u201d box on the Filing Status line near the top of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. If the child who qualifies you for this filing status isn't claimed as your dependent in the Dependents section of Form 1040 or 1040-SR, enter the child's name in the entry space at the bottom of the Filing Status section. Use the Head of a household column of the Tax Table, or Section D of the Tax Computation Worksheet, to figure your tax.\nTo qualify for head of household status, you must be either unmarried or considered unmarried on the last day of the year. You are considered unmarried on the last day of the tax year if you meet all the following tests.\n-\nYou file a separate return. A separate return includes a return claiming married filing separately, single, or head of household filing status.\n-\nYou paid more than half the cost of keeping up your home for the tax year.\n-\nYour spouse didn't live in your home during the last 6 months of the tax year. Your spouse is considered to live in your home even if your spouse is temporarily absent due to special circumstances. See Temporary absences, later.\n-\nYour home was the main home of your child, stepchild, or foster child for more than half the year. (See Home of qualifying person, later, for rules applying to a child's birth, death, or temporary absence during the year.)\n-\nYou must be able to claim the child as a dependent. However, you meet this test if you can't claim the child as a dependent only because the noncustodial parent can claim the child using the rules described later in Children of divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart) under Qualifying Child or in Support Test for Children of Divorced or Separated Parents (or Parents Who Live Apart) under Qualifying Relative. The general rules for claiming a child as a dependent are explained later under Dependents.\nYou may be considered unmarried for the purpose of using head of household status but not for other purposes, such as claiming the EIC. Different tests apply depending on the tax benefit you claim.\n.If you were considered married for part of the year and lived in a community property state (listed earlier under Married Filing Separately), special rules may apply in determining your income and expenses. See Pub. 555 for more information. .\nNonresident alien spouse.\nYou are considered unmarried for head of household purposes if your spouse was a nonresident alien at any time during the year and you don't choose to treat your nonresident spouse as a resident alien. However, your spouse isn't a qualifying person for head of household purposes. You must have another qualifying person and meet the other tests to be eligible to file as head of household.\nChoice to treat spouse as resident.\nYou are considered married if you choose to treat your spouse as a resident alien. See chapter 1 of Pub. 519.\nTo qualify for head of household status, you must pay more than half of the cost of keeping up a home for the year. You can determine whether you paid more than half of the cost of keeping up a home by using Worksheet 1.\nWorksheet 1. Cost of Keeping Up a Home\n| Amount You Paid |\nTotal Cost |\n|\n| Property taxes | $ | $ |\n| Mortgage interest expense | _____ | _____ |\n| Rent | _____ | _____ |\n| Utility charges | _____ | _____ |\n| Repairs/maintenance | _____ | _____ |\n| Property insurance | _____ | _____ |\n| Food eaten in the home | _____ | _____ |\n| Other household expenses | _____ | _____ |\n| Totals | $ | $ |\n| Minus total amount you paid | () | |\n| Amount others paid | $ | |\n| Note. TANF and other governmental payments. Under proposed Treasury regulations, if you received Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) payments or other similar payments and used the payment to support another person, those payments are considered support you provided for that person, rather than support provided by the government or other third party. Amounts paid out of funds received in the child\u2019s or qualifying person\u2019s name, such as Social Security, are considered paid by the child, not you. If the total amount you paid is more than the amount others paid, you meet the requirement of paying more than half the cost of keeping up the home. |\nCosts you include.\nInclude in the cost of keeping up a home expenses such as rent, mortgage interest, real estate taxes, insurance on the home, repairs, utilities, and food eaten in the home.\nCosts you don't include.\nDon't include the cost of clothing, education, medical treatment, vacations, life insurance, or transportation. Also don't include the value of your services or those of a member of your household.\nSee Table 4 to see who is a qualifying person. Any person not described in Table 4 isn't a qualifying person.\nExample 1\u2014child.\nYour unmarried child lived with you all year and was 18 years old at the end of the year. Your child didn't provide more than half of their own support and doesn't meet the tests to be a qualifying child of anyone else. As a result, this child is your qualifying child (see Qualifying Child, later) and, because this child is single, this is your qualifying person for head of household purposes.\nExample 2\u2014child who isn't qualifying person.\nThe facts are the same as in Example 1, except your child was 25 years old at the end of the year and your child\u2019s gross income was $6,000. Because your child doesn't meet the age test (explained later under Qualifying Child), your child isn't your qualifying child. Because the child doesn't meet the gross income test (explained later under Qualifying Relative), the child isn't your qualifying relative. As a result, this child isn't your qualifying person for head of household purposes.\nExample 3\u2014your friend.\nYour friend lived with you all year. Even though your friend may be your qualifying relative if the gross income and support tests (explained later) are met, your friend isn't your qualifying person for head of household purposes because your friend isn't related to you in one of the ways listed under Relatives who don't have to live with you, later. See Table 4.\nExample 4\u2014friend's child.\nThe facts are the same as in Example 3, except your friend's 10-year-old child also lived with you all year. Your friend\u2019s child isn't your qualifying child and, because the child is your friend's qualifying child, your friend\u2019s child isn't your qualifying relative (see Not a Qualifying Child Test, later). As a result, your friend\u2019s child isn't your qualifying person for head of household purposes.\nHome of qualifying person.\nGenerally, the qualifying person must live with you for more than half of the year.\nSpecial rule for parent.\nIf your qualifying person is your parent, you may be eligible to file as head of household even if your parent doesn't live with you. However, you must be able to claim your parent as a dependent. Also, you must pay more than half the cost of keeping up a home that was the main home for the entire year for your parent.\nIf you pay more than half the cost of keeping your parent in a rest home or home for the elderly, that counts as paying more than half the cost of keeping up your parent's main home.\nDeath or birth.\nYou may be eligible to file as head of household even if the qualifying person who qualifies you for this filing status is born or dies during the year. To qualify you for head of household filing status, the qualifying person (as defined in Table 4) must be one of the following.\n-\nYour qualifying child or qualifying relative who lived with you for more than half the part of the year they were alive.\n-\nYour parent for whom you paid, for the entire part of the year your parent was alive, more than half the cost of keeping up the home your parent lived in.\nExample.\nYou are unmarried. Your parent, who you claim as a dependent, lived in an apartment alone. Your parent died on September 2. The cost of the upkeep of the apartment for the year until your parent\u2019s death was $6,000. You paid $4,000 and your sibling paid $2,000. Your sibling made no other payments toward your parent\u2019s support. Your parent had no income. Because you paid more than half of the cost of keeping up your parent\u2019s apartment from January 1 until your parent\u2019s death, and you can claim your parent as a dependent, you can file as head of household.\nTemporary absences.\nYou and your qualifying person are considered to live together even if one or both of you are temporarily absent from your home due to special circumstances such as illness, education, business, vacation, military service, or detention in a juvenile facility. It must be reasonable to assume the absent person will return to the home after the temporary absence. You must continue to keep up the home during the absence.\nAdopted child or foster child.\nYou may be eligible to file as head of household if the person who qualifies you for this filing status was an adopted child or foster child and you kept up a home for this person in 2024, the person was lawfully placed with you for legal adoption by you in 2024, or the person was an eligible foster child placed with you during 2024. The person is considered to have lived with you for more than half of 2024 if your main home was this person's main home for more than half the time since the child was adopted or placed with you in 2024.\nKidnapped child.\nYou may be eligible to file as head of household even if the child who is your qualifying person has been kidnapped. You can claim head of household filing status if all the following statements are true.\n-\nThe child is presumed by law enforcement authorities to have been kidnapped by someone who isn't a member of your family or the child's family.\n-\nIn the year of the kidnapping, the child lived with you for more than half the part of the year before the kidnapping.\n-\nIn the year of the child\u2019s return, the child lived with you for more than half the part of the year following the date of the child\u2019s return.\n-\nYou would have qualified for head of household filing status if the child hadn't been kidnapped.\nThis treatment applies for all years until the earlier of:\n-\nThe year there is a determination that the child is dead, or\n-\nThe year the child would have reached age 18.\nQualifying Surviving Spouse\nIf your spouse died in 2024, you can use married filing jointly as your filing status for 2024 if you otherwise qualify to use that status. The year of death is the last year for which you can file jointly with your deceased spouse. See Married Filing Jointly, earlier.\nYou may be eligible to use qualifying surviving spouse as your filing status for 2 years following the year your spouse died. For example, if your spouse died in 2023 and you haven't remarried, you may be able to use this filing status for 2024 and 2025. The rules for using this filing status are explained in detail here.\nThis filing status entitles you to use joint return tax rates and the highest standard deduction amount (if you don't itemize deductions). It doesn't entitle you to file a joint return.\nHow to file.\nIndicate your choice of this filing status by checking the \u201cQualifying surviving spouse\u201d box on the Filing Status line near the top of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. If the child who qualifies you for this filing status isn\u2019t claimed as your dependent in the Dependents section of Form 1040 or 1040-SR, enter the child\u2019s name in the entry space at the bottom of the Filing Status section. Use the Married filing jointly column of the Tax Table, or Section B of the Tax Computation Worksheet, to figure your tax.\n|\n|\n| See the text of this publication for the other requirements you must meet to claim head of household filing status. | |||||\n| IF the person is your . . . | AND . . . | THEN that person is . . . | |||\n| qualifying child (such as a son, daughter, or grandchild who lived with you more than half the year and meets certain other tests)2 | the child is single | a qualifying person, whether or not the child meets the citizen or resident test. | |||\n| the child is married and you can claim the child as a dependent | a qualifying person. | ||||\n| the child is married and you can't claim the child as a dependent | not a qualifying person.3 | ||||\n| qualifying relative4 who is your father or mother | you can claim your parent as a dependent5 | a qualifying person.6 | |||\n| you can't claim your parent as a dependent | not a qualifying person. | ||||\n| qualifying relative4 other than your father or mother (such as a grandparent, brother, or sister who meets certain tests) | your relative lived with you more than half the year, and your relative is related to you in one of the ways listed under Relatives who don't have to live with you, later, and you can claim your relative as a dependent5 | a qualifying person. | |||\n| your relative didn't live with you more than half the year | not a qualifying person. | ||||\n| your relative isn't related to you in one of the ways listed under Relatives who don't have to live with you, later, and is your qualifying relative only because your relative lived with you all year as a member of your household | not a qualifying person. | ||||\n| you can't claim your relative as a dependent | not a qualifying person. | ||||\n| 1 A person can't qualify more than one taxpayer to use the head of household filing status for the year. | |||||\n| 2 The term \u201cqualifying child\u201d is defined under Dependents, later. Note: If you are a noncustodial parent, the term \u201cqualifying child\u201d for head of household filing status doesn't include a child who is your qualifying child only because of the rules described under Children of divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart) under Qualifying Child, later. If you are the custodial parent and those rules apply, the child is generally your qualifying child for head of household filing status even though the child isn't a qualifying child you can claim as a dependent. | |||||\n| 3 This person is a qualifying person if the only reason you can't claim the person as a dependent is that you can be claimed as a dependent on another taxpayer's return. | |||||\n| 4 The term \u201cqualifying relative\u201d is defined under Dependents, later. | |||||\n| 5 If you can claim a person as a dependent only because of a multiple support agreement, that person isn't a qualifying person.

It doesn't matter whether you actually filed a joint return.\n-\nYour spouse died in 2022 or 2023 and you didn't remarry before the end of 2024.\n-\nYou have a child or stepchild (not a foster child) whom you can claim as a dependent or could claim as a dependent except that, for 2024:\n-\nThe child had gross income of $5,050 or more,\n-\nThe child filed a joint return, or\n-\nYou could be claimed as a dependent on someone else\u2019s return.\nIf the child isn\u2019t claimed as your dependent in the Dependents section on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, enter the child\u2019s name in the entry space at the bottom of the Filing Status section. If you don\u2019t enter the name, it will take us longer to process your return.\n-\n-\nThis child lived in your home all year, except for temporary absences. See Temporary absences, earlier, under Head of Household. There are also exceptions, described later, for a child who was born or died during the year and for a kidnapped child.\n-\nYou paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home for the year. See Keeping Up a Home, earlier, under Head of Household.\nExample.\nYour spouse died in 2022 and you haven\u2019t remarried. During 2023 and 2024, you continued to keep up a home for you and your child who lives with you and whom you can claim as a dependent. For 2022, you were entitled to file a joint return for you and your deceased spouse. For 2023 and 2024, you can file as a qualifying surviving spouse. After 2024, you can file as head of household if you qualify.\nDeath or birth.\nYou may be eligible to file as a qualifying surviving spouse if the child who qualifies you for this filing status is born or dies during the year. You must have provided more than half of the cost of keeping up a home that was the child's main home during the entire part of the year the child was alive.\nAdopted child.\nYou may be eligible to file as a qualifying surviving spouse if the child who qualifies you for this filing status you adopted in 2024 or was lawfully placed with you for legal adoption by you in 2024. The child is considered to have lived with you for all of 2024 if your main home was this child's main home for the entire time since this child was adopted or placed with you in 2024.\nKidnapped child.\nYou may be eligible to file as a qualifying surviving spouse even if the child who qualifies you for this filing status has been kidnapped. You can claim qualifying surviving spouse filing status if all the following statements are true.\n-\nThe child is presumed by law enforcement authorities to have been kidnapped by someone who isn't a member of your family or the child's family.\n-\nIn the year of the kidnapping, the child lived with you for more than half the part of the year before the kidnapping.\n-\nIn the year of the child\u2019s return, the child lived with you for more than half the part of the year following the date of the child\u2019s return.\n-\nYou would have qualified for qualifying surviving spouse filing status if the child had not been kidnapped.\n. As mentioned earlier, the filing status qualifying surviving spouse is available for only 2 years following the year your spouse died..\nDependents\nThe term \u201cdependent\u201d means:\n-\nA qualifying child, or\n-\nA qualifying relative.\nAll the requirements for claiming a dependent are summarized in Table 5.\n| This table is only an overview of the rules. For details, see the rest of this publication. | ||\n|\n||\n| Tests To Be a Qualifying Child | Tests To Be a Qualifying Relative | |\nIf the child meets the rules to be a qualifying child of more than one person, generally only one person can actually treat the child as a qualifying child. See Qualifying Child of More Than One Person, later, to find out which person is the person entitled to claim the child as a qualifying child. |\n|\n|\n| 1 There is an exception for certain adopted children. | ||\n| 2 There are exceptions for temporary absences, children who were born or died during the year, children who were adopted or lawfully placed for adoption during the year, children who are eligible foster children placed during the year, children of divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart), and kidnapped children. | ||\n| 3 There is an exception if the person is disabled and has income from a sheltered workshop. | ||\n| 4 There are exceptions for multiple support agreements, children of divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart), and kidnapped children. |\nChild tax credit.\nYou may be entitled to a child tax credit for each qualifying child who was under age 17 at the end of the year if you claimed that child as a dependent. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 1040.\nCredit for other dependents.\nYou may be entitled to a credit for other dependents for each qualifying child who does not qualify you for the child tax credit and for each qualifying relative. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 1040.\nExceptions\nEven if you have a qualifying child or qualifying relative, you can claim that person as a dependent only if these three tests are met.\nThese three tests are explained in detail here.If you can be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer, you can't claim anyone else as a dependent. Even if you have a qualifying child or qualifying relative, you can't claim that person as a dependent.\nIf you are filing a joint return and your spouse can be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer, you and your spouse can't claim any dependents on your joint return.\nException.\nIf you can be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer, you can claim someone else as a dependent if the person who can claim you (or your spouse if filing a joint return) as a dependent files a return only to claim a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid.\nYou generally can't claim a married person as a dependent if that person files a joint return.\nException.\nYou can claim a person as a dependent who files a joint return if that person and that person\u2019s spouse file the joint return only to claim a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid.\nExample 1\u2014child files joint return.\nYou supported your 18-year-old child who lived with you all year while your child\u2019s spouse was in the Armed Forces. Your child\u2019s spouse earned $35,000 for the year. The couple files a joint return. You can't claim your child as a dependent.\nExample 2\u2014child files joint return only as claim for refund of withheld tax.\nYour 18-year-old child and your child\u2019s 17-year-old spouse had $800 of wages from part-time jobs and no other income. They lived with you all year. Neither is required to file a tax return. They don't have a child. Taxes were taken out of their pay, so they file a joint return only to get a refund of the withheld taxes. The exception to the joint return test applies, so you aren't disqualified from claiming each of them as a dependent just because they file a joint return. You can claim each of them as dependents if all the other tests to do so are met.\nExample 3\u2014child files joint return to claim American opportunity credit.\nThe facts are the same as in Example 2, except no taxes were taken out of your child\u2019s pay or your child\u2019s spouse\u2019s pay. However, they file a joint return to claim an American opportunity credit of $124 and get a refund of that amount. Because they filed a joint return claiming the American opportunity credit, they aren\u2019t filing it only to get a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid. The exception to the joint return test doesn't apply, so you can't claim either of them as a dependent.\nYou generally can't claim a person as a dependent unless that person is a U.S. citizen, a U.S. resident alien, a U.S. national, or a resident of Canada or Mexico. However, there is an exception for certain adopted children, as explained next.\nException for adopted child.\nIf you are a U.S. citizen or U.S. national who has legally adopted a child who isn't a U.S. citizen, U.S. resident alien, or U.S. national, this test is met if the child lived with you as a member of your household all year. This exception also applies if the child was lawfully placed with you for legal adoption and the child lived with you for the rest of the year after placement.\nChild's place of residence.\nChildren are usually citizens or residents of the country of their parents.\nIf you were a U.S. citizen when your child was born, the child may be a U.S. citizen and meet this test even if the other parent was a nonresident alien and the child was born in a foreign country.\nForeign students' place of residence.\nForeign students brought to this country under a qualified international education exchange program and placed in American homes for a temporary period generally aren't U.S. residents and don't meet this test. You can't claim them as dependents. However, if you provided a home for a foreign student, you may be able to take a charitable contribution deduction. See Expenses Paid for Student Living With You in Pub. 526.\nQualifying Child\nFive tests must be met for a child to be your qualifying child. The five tests are:\nThese tests are explained next..If a child meets the five tests to be the qualifying child of more than one person, there are rules you must use to determine which person can actually treat the child as a qualifying child. See Qualifying Child of More Than One Person, later..\nTo meet this test, a child must be:\n-\nYour son, daughter, stepchild, or foster child, or a descendant (for example, your grandchild) of any of them; or\n-\nYour brother, sister, half brother, half sister, stepbrother, or stepsister, or a descendant (for example, your niece or nephew) of any of them.\nTo meet this test, a child must be:\n-\nUnder age 19 at the end of the year and younger than you (or your spouse if filing jointly);\n-\nA student under age 24 at the end of the year and younger than you (or your spouse if filing jointly); or\n-\nPermanently and totally disabled at any time during the year, regardless of age.\nExample.\nYour child turned 19 on December 10. Unless this child was permanently and totally disabled or a student, this child doesn't meet the age test because, at the end of the year, this child wasn't under age 19.\nChild must be younger than you or your spouse.\nTo be your qualifying child, a child who isn't permanently and totally disabled must be younger than you. However, if you are married filing jointly, the child must be younger than you or your spouse but doesn't have to be younger than both of you.\nExample 1\u2014child not younger than you or your spouse.\nYour 23-year-old sibling, who is a student and unmarried, lives with you and your spouse, who provide more than half of your sibling\u2019s support. Your sibling isn't disabled. Both you and your spouse are 21 years old, and you file a joint return. Your sibling isn't your qualifying child because your sibling isn't younger than you or your spouse.\nExample 2\u2014child younger than your spouse but not younger than you.\nThe facts are the same as in Example 1, except your spouse is 25 years old. Because your sibling is younger than your spouse and you and your spouse are filing a joint return, your sibling is your qualifying child, even though your sibling isn't younger than you.\nStudent defined.\nTo qualify as a student, your child must be, during some part of each of any 5 calendar months of the year:\n-\nA full-time student at a school that has a regular teaching staff and course of study, and a regularly enrolled student body at the school; or\n-\nA student taking a full-time, on-farm training course given by a school described in (1), or by a state, county, or local government agency.\nFull-time student.\nA full-time student is a student who is enrolled for the number of hours or courses the school considers to be full-time attendance.\nSchool defined.\nA school can be an elementary school, a junior or senior high school, a college, a university, or a technical, trade, or mechanical school. However, an on-the-job training course, correspondence school, or school offering courses only through the Internet doesn't count as a school.\nVocational high school students.\nStudents who work on \u201cco-op\u201d jobs in private industry as a part of a school's regular course of classroom and practical training are considered full-time students.\nPermanently and totally disabled.\nYour child is permanently and totally disabled if both of the following apply.\n-\nYour child can't engage in any substantial gainful activity because of a physical or mental condition.\n-\nA doctor determines the condition has lasted or can be expected to last continuously for at least a year or can lead to death.\nTo meet this test, your child must have lived with you for more than half the year. There are exceptions for temporary absences, children who were born or died during the year, adopted or foster children, kidnapped children, and children of divorced or separated parents.\nTemporary absences.\nYour child is considered to have lived with you during periods of time when one of you, or both, is temporarily absent due to special circumstances, such as:\n-\nIllness,\n-\nEducation,\n-\nBusiness,\n-\nVacation,\n-\nMilitary service, or\n-\nDetention in a juvenile facility.\nDeath or birth of child.\nA child who was born or died during the year is treated as having lived with you more than half the year if your home was the child's home more than half the time the child was alive during the year. The same is true if the child lived with you more than half the year except for any required hospital stay following birth.\nChild born alive.\nYou may be able to claim as a dependent a child born alive during the year, even if the child lived only for a moment. State or local law must treat the child as having been born alive. There must be proof of a live birth shown by an official document, such as a birth certificate. The child must be your qualifying child or qualifying relative, and all the other tests to claim the child as a dependent must be met.\nAdopted child or foster child.\nYou can treat your adopted child or foster child as meeting the residency test as follows if you adopted the child in 2024, the child was lawfully placed with you for legal adoption by you in 2024, or the child was an eligible foster child placed with you during 2024. This child is considered to have lived with you for more than half of 2024 if your main home was this child's main home for more than half the time since this child was adopted or placed with you in 2024.\nKidnapped child.\nYou can treat your child as meeting the residency test even if the child has been kidnapped, but the following statements must be true.\n-\nThe child is presumed by law enforcement authorities to have been kidnapped by someone who isn't a member of your family or the child's family.\n-\nIn the year the kidnapping occurred, the child lived with you for more than half of the part of the year before the date of the kidnapping.\n-\nIn the year of the child\u2019s return, the child lived with you for more than half the part of the year following the date of the child\u2019s return.\nThis treatment applies for all years until the earlier of:\n-\nThe year there is a determination that the child is dead, or\n-\nThe year the child would have reached age 18.\nChildren of divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart).\nIn most cases, because of the residency test, a child of divorced or separated parents is the qualifying child of the custodial parent. However, the child will be treated as the qualifying child of the noncustodial parent if all four of the following statements are true.\n-\nThe parents:\n-\nAre divorced or legally separated under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance;\n-\nAre separated under a written separation agreement; or\n-\nLived apart at all times during the last 6 months of the year, whether or not they are or were married.\n-\n-\nThe child received over half of the child\u2019s support for the year from the parents.\n-\nThe child is in the custody of one or both parents for more than half of the year.\n-\nEither of the following statements is true.\n-\nThe custodial parent signs a written declaration, discussed later, that they won't claim the child as a dependent for the year, and the noncustodial parent attaches this written declaration to their return. (If the decree or agreement went into effect after 1984 and before 2009, see Post-1984 and pre-2009 divorce decree or separation agreement, later. If the decree or agreement went into effect after 2008, see Post-2008 divorce decree or separation agreement, later.)\n-\nA pre-1985 decree of divorce or separate maintenance or written separation agreement that applies to 2024 states that the noncustodial parent can claim the child as a dependent, the decree or agreement wasn't changed after 1984 to say the noncustodial parent can't claim the child as a dependent, and the noncustodial parent provides at least $600 for the child's support during the year.\n-\nIf statements (1) through (4) are all true, only the noncustodial parent can:\n-\nClaim the child as a dependent; and\n-\nClaim the child as a qualifying child for the child tax credit, the credit for other dependents, or the additional child tax credit.\nExample\u2014earned income credit.\nEven if statements (1) through (4) are all true and the custodial parent signs Form 8332 or a substantially similar statement that the custodial parent won\u2019t claim the child as a dependent for 2024, this doesn\u2019t allow the noncustodial parent to claim the child as a qualifying child for the earned income credit. The custodial parent or another taxpayer, if eligible, can claim the child for the earned income credit.\nCustodial parent and noncustodial parent.\nThe custodial parent is the parent with whom the child lived for the greater number of nights during the year. The other parent is the noncustodial parent.\nIf the parents divorced or separated during the year and the child lived with both parents before the separation, the custodial parent is the one with whom the child lived for the greater number of nights during the rest of the year.\nA child is treated as living with a parent for a night if the child sleeps:\n-\nAt that parent's home, whether or not the parent is present; or\n-\nIn the company of the parent, when the child doesn't sleep at a parent's home (for example, the parent and child are on vacation together).\nEqual number of nights.\nIf the child lived with each parent for an equal number of nights during the year, the custodial parent is the parent with the higher AGI.\nDecember 31.\nThe night of December 31 is treated as part of the year in which the night begins. For example, the night of December 31, 2024, is treated as part of 2024.\nEmancipated child.\nIf a child is emancipated under state law, the child is treated as not living with either parent. See Examples 5 and 6.\nAbsences.\nIf a child wasn't with either parent on a particular night (because, for example, the child was staying at a friend's house), the child is treated as living with the parent with whom the child normally would have lived for that night, except for the absence. But if it can't be determined with which parent the child normally would have lived or if the child would not have lived with either parent that night, the child is treated as not living with either parent that night.\nParent works at night.\nIf, due to a parent's nighttime work schedule, a child lives for a greater number of days, but not nights, with the parent who works at night, that parent is treated as the custodial parent. On a school day, the child is treated as living at the primary residence registered with the school.\nExample 1\u2014child lived with one parent for a greater number of nights.\nYou and your child\u2019s other parent are divorced. In 2024, your child lived with you 210 nights and with the other parent 156 nights. You are the custodial parent.\nExample 2\u2014child is away at camp.\nIn 2024, your child lives with each parent for alternate weeks. In the summer, your child spends 6 weeks at summer camp. During those 6 weeks, your child is treated as living with you for 3 weeks and with your child\u2019s other parent, your ex-spouse, for 3 weeks because this is how long the child would have lived with each parent if the child had not attended summer camp.\nExample 3\u2014child lived same number of nights with each parent.\nYour child lived with you 180 nights during the year and lived the same number of nights with the child\u2019s other parent, your ex-spouse. Your AGI is $40,000. Your ex-spouse's AGI is $25,000. You are treated as your child's custodial parent because you have the higher AGI.\nExample 4\u2014child is at parent\u2019s home but with other parent.\nYour child normally lives with you during the week and with the child\u2019s other parent, your ex-spouse, every other weekend. You become ill and are hospitalized. Your ex-spouse lives in your home with your child for 10 consecutive days while you are in the hospital. Your child is treated as living with you during this 10-day period because your child was living in your home.\nExample 5\u2014child emancipated in May.\nYour child turned 18 in May 2024 and became emancipated under the law of the state where your child lives. As a result, your child isn't considered in the custody of either parent for more than half of the year. The special rule for children of divorced or separated parents doesn't apply.\nExample 6\u2014child emancipated in August.\nYour child lives with you from January 1, 2024, until May 31, 2024, and lives with the child\u2019s other parent, your ex-spouse, from June 1, 2024, through the end of the year. Your child turns 18 and is emancipated under state law on August 1, 2024. Because your child is treated as not living with either parent beginning on August 1, your child is treated as living with you the greater number of nights in 2024. You are the custodial parent.\nWritten declaration.\nThe custodial parent must use either Form 8332 or a similar statement (containing the same information required by the form) to make the written declaration to release a claim to an exemption for a child to the noncustodial parent. Although the exemption amount is zero for tax year 2024, this release allows the noncustodial parent to claim the child tax credit, credit for other dependents, or additional child tax credit, if applicable, for the child. The noncustodial parent must attach a copy of the form or statement to their tax return.\nThe release can be for 1 year, for a number of specified years (for example, alternate years), or for all future years, as specified in the declaration.\nPost-1984 and pre-2009 divorce decree or separation agreement.\nIf the divorce decree or separation agreement went into effect after 1984 and before 2009, the noncustodial parent may be able to attach certain pages from the decree or agreement instead of Form 8332. The decree or agreement must state all three of the following.\n-\nThe noncustodial parent can claim the child as a dependent without regard to any condition, such as payment of support.\n-\nThe custodial parent won't claim the child as a dependent for the year.\n-\nThe years for which the noncustodial parent, rather than the custodial parent, can claim the child as a dependent.\nThe noncustodial parent must attach all of the following pages of the decree or agreement to their tax return.\n-\nThe cover page (write the other parent's SSN on this page).\n-\nThe pages that include all of the information identified in items (1) through (3) above.\n-\nThe signature page with the other parent's signature and the date of the agreement.\nPost-2008 divorce decree or separation agreement.\nThe noncustodial parent can't attach pages from the decree or agreement instead of Form 8332 if the decree or agreement went into effect after 2008. The custodial parent must sign either Form 8332 or a similar statement whose only purpose is to release the custodial parent's claim to an exemption, and the noncustodial parent must attach a copy to their return. The form or statement must release the custodial parent's claim to the child without any conditions. For example, the release must not depend on the noncustodial parent paying support.\n.The noncustodial parent must attach the required information even if it was filed with a return in an earlier year..\nRevocation of release of claim to an exemption.\nThe custodial parent can revoke a release of claim to an exemption. For the revocation to be effective for 2024, the custodial parent must have given (or made reasonable efforts to give) written notice of the revocation to the noncustodial parent in 2023 or earlier. The custodial parent can use Part III of Form 8332 for this purpose and must attach a copy of the revocation to their return for each tax year the custodial parent claims the child as a dependent as a result of the revocation.\nRemarried parent.\nIf you remarry, the support provided by your new spouse is treated as provided by you.\nTo meet this test, the child can't have provided more than half of the child\u2019s own support for the year.\nThis test is different from the support test to be a qualifying relative, which is described later. However, to see what is or isn't support, see Support Test (To Be a Qualifying Relative), later. If you aren't sure whether a child provided more than half of their own support, you may find Worksheet 2 helpful.\nExample.\nYou provided $4,000 toward your 16-year-old child's support for the year and the child provided $6,000. Your child provided more than half their own support. This child isn't your qualifying child.\nFoster care payments and expenses.\nPayments you receive for the support of a foster child from a child placement agency are considered support provided by the agency. Similarly, payments you receive for the support of a foster child from a state or county are considered support provided by the state or county.\nIf you aren't in the trade or business of providing foster care and your unreimbursed out-of-pocket expenses in caring for a foster child were mainly to benefit an organization qualified to receive deductible charitable contributions, the expenses are deductible as charitable contributions but aren't considered support you provided. For more information about the deduction for charitable contributions, see Pub. 526. If your unreimbursed expenses aren't deductible as charitable contributions, they may qualify as support you provided.\nIf you are in the trade or business of providing foster care, your unreimbursed expenses aren't considered support provided by you.\nExample 1.\nA foster child lived with a married couple, the Smiths, for the last 3 months of the year. The Smiths cared for the foster child because they wanted to adopt the child (although the child had not been placed with them for adoption). They didn't care for the foster child as a trade or business or to benefit the agency that placed the foster child in their home. The Smiths' unreimbursed expenses aren't deductible as charitable contributions but are considered support they provided for the foster child.\nExample 2.\nYou provided $3,000 toward your 10-year-old foster child's support for the year. The state government provided $4,000, which is considered support provided by the state, not by the child. See Support provided by the state (welfare, food benefits, housing, etc.), later. Your foster child didn't provide more than half of their own support for the year.\nScholarships.\nA scholarship received by a child who is a student isn't taken into account in determining whether the child provided more than half of their own support.\nTANF and other governmental payments.\nUnder proposed Treasury regulations, if you received Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) payments or other similar payments and used the payment to support another person, those payments are considered support you provided for that person, rather than support provided by the government or other third party.\nTo meet this test, the child can't file a joint return for the year.\nException.\nAn exception to the joint return test applies if your child and the child\u2019s spouse file a joint return only to claim a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid.\nExample 1\u2014child files joint return.\nYou supported your 18-year-old child who lived with you all year while the child\u2019s spouse was in the Armed Forces. Your child\u2019s spouse earned $35,000 for the year. The couple files a joint return so this child isn't your qualifying child.\nWorksheet 2.

See Multiple Support Agreement, Support Test for Children of Divorced or Separated Parents (or Parents Who Live Apart), or Kidnapped child under Qualifying Relative. |\nExample 2\u2014child files joint return only as claim for refund of withheld tax.\nYour 18-year-old child and your child\u2019s 17-year-old spouse had $800 of wages from part-time jobs and no other income. They lived with you all year. Neither is required to file a tax return. They don't have a child. Taxes were taken out of their pay, so they file a joint return only to get a refund of the withheld taxes. The exception to the joint return test applies, so this child may be your qualifying child if all the other tests are met.\nExample 3\u2014child files joint return to claim American opportunity credit.\nThe facts are the same as in Example 2, except no taxes were taken out of either spouse's pay. However, they file a joint return to claim an American opportunity credit of $124 and get a refund of that amount. Because claiming the American opportunity credit is their reason for filing the return, they aren't filing it only to get a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid. The exception to the joint return test doesn't apply, so this child isn't your qualifying child.\n.If your qualifying child isn't a qualifying child of anyone else, this topic doesn't apply to you and you don't need to read about it. This is also true if your qualifying child isn't a qualifying child of anyone else except your spouse with whom you plan to file a joint return..\n.If a child is treated as the qualifying child of the noncustodial parent under the rules for children of divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart), described earlier, see Applying the tiebreaker rules to divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart), later..\nSometimes, a child meets the relationship, age, residency, support, and joint return tests to be a qualifying child of more than one person. Although the child is a qualifying child of each of these persons, generally only one person can actually treat the child as a qualifying child to take all of the following tax benefits (provided the person is eligible for each benefit).\nThe other person can\u2019t take any of these benefits based on this qualifying child. In other words, you and the other person can\u2019t agree to divide these tax benefits between you.\nTiebreaker rules.\nTo determine which person can treat the child as a qualifying child to claim these five tax benefits, the following tiebreaker rules apply. For purposes of these tiebreaker rules, the term \u201cparent\u201d means a biological or adoptive parent of an individual. It does not include a stepparent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the individual.\n-\nIf only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the parent.\n-\nIf the parents file a joint return together and can claim the child as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the parents.\n-\nIf the parents don't file a joint return together but both parents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the child as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child lived for the longer period of time during the year. If the child lived with each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat the child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the higher AGI for the year.\n-\nIf no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for the year.\n-\nIf a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no parent does so claim the child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for the year, but only if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any of the child's parents who can claim the child.\nSubject to these tiebreaker rules, you and the other person may be able to choose which of you claims the child as a qualifying child.\n.You may be able to qualify for the earned income credit under the rules for taxpayers without a qualifying child if you have a qualifying child for the earned income credit who is claimed as a qualifying child by another taxpayer. For more information, see Pub. 596..\nExample 1\u2014child lived with parent and grandparent.\nYou and your 3-year-old child Jordan lived with your parent all year. You are 25 years old and unmarried, and your AGI is $9,000. Your parent's AGI is $15,000. Your child\u2019s other parent didn't live with you or your child. You haven't signed Form 8832 (or a similar statement).\nJordan is a qualifying child of both you and your parent because Jordan meets the relationship, age, residency, support, and joint return tests for both you and your parent. However, only one of you can claim Jordan. Your child isn't a qualifying child of anyone else, including Jordan\u2019s other parent. You agree to let your parent claim Jordan. This means your parent can claim Jordan as a qualifying child for all of the five tax benefits listed earlier, if your parent qualifies for each of those benefits (and if you don't claim Jordan as a qualifying child for any of those tax benefits).\nExample 2\u2014parent has higher AGI than grandparent.\nThe facts are the same as in Example 1, except your AGI is $18,000. Because your parent's AGI isn't higher than yours, your parent can't claim Jordan. Only you can claim Jordan.\nExample 3\u2014two persons claim same child.\nThe facts are the same as in Example 1, except you and your parent both claim Jordan as a qualifying child. In this case, you, as the child's parent, will be the only one allowed to claim the child as a qualifying child. The IRS will disallow your parent's claim to the five tax benefits listed earlier based on Jordan. However, your parent may qualify for the earned income credit as a taxpayer without a qualifying child.\nExample 4\u2014qualifying children split between two persons.\nThe facts are the same as in Example 1, except you also have two other young children who are qualifying children of both you and your parent. Only one of you can claim each child. However, if your parent's AGI is higher than yours, you can allow your parent to claim one or more of the children. For example, if you claim one child, your parent can claim the other two.\nExample 5\u2014taxpayer who is a qualifying child.\nThe facts are the same as in Example 1, except you are only 18 years old and didn't provide more than half of your own support for the year. This means you are your parent's qualifying child. If your parent can claim you as a dependent, then you can't claim your child as a dependent because of the dependent taxpayer test, explained earlier, unless your parent files a return only to claim a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid.\nExample 6\u2014separated parents.\nYou, your spouse, and your 10-year-old child all lived in the United States for all of 2024. On August 1, 2024, your spouse moved out of the household. In August and September, your child lived with you. For the rest of the year, your child lived with your spouse, the child's other parent. Your child is a qualifying child of both you and your spouse because your child lived with each of you for more than half the year and because your child met the relationship, age, support, and joint return tests for both of you. At the end of the year, you and your spouse still weren't divorced, legally separated, or separated under a written separation agreement, so the rule for children of divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart) doesn't apply.\nYou and your spouse will file separate returns. Your spouse agrees to let you treat your child as a qualifying child. This means, if your spouse doesn't claim your child as a qualifying child, you can claim this child as a qualifying child for the child tax credit and the exclusion for dependent care benefits (assuming you otherwise qualify for both tax benefits). However, you can't claim head of household filing status because you and your spouse didn't live apart for the last 6 months of the year. As a result, your filing status is married filing separately. You can't claim the earned income credit because you don't meet the requirements for certain separated spouses to claim the earned income credit when they don\u2019t file a joint return. You and your spouse didn't live apart for the last 6 months of 2024 and while you did live apart at the end of 2024, you aren't legally separated under a written separation agreement or decree of separate maintenance. Therefore, you don't meet the requirements to take the earned income credit as a separated spouse who is not filing a joint return. You also can't take the credit for child and dependent care expenses because your fling status is married filing separately and you and your spouse didn't live apart for the last 6 months of 2024.\nExample 7\u2014separated parents claim same child.\nThe facts are the same as in Example 6, except you and your spouse both claim your child as a qualifying child. In this case, only your spouse will be allowed to treat your child as a qualifying child. This is because, during 2024, the child lived with your spouse longer than with you. If you claimed the child tax credit for your child, the IRS will disallow your claim to the child tax credit. If you don't have another qualifying child or dependent, the IRS will also disallow your claim to the exclusion for dependent care benefits. In addition, because you and your spouse didn't live apart for the last 6 months of the year, your spouse can't claim head of household filing status. As a result, your spouse\u2019s filing status is married filing separately. Your spouse can't claim the earned income credit because your spouse doesn't meet the requirements to claim the earned income credit for certain separated spouses. You and your spouse didn\u2019t live apart for the last 6 months of 2024 and, while you did live apart at the end of 2024, you aren't legally separated under a written separation agreement or decree of separate maintenance. Therefore, your spouse doesn\u2019t meet the requirements to take the earned income credit as a separated spouse who isn\u2019t filing a joint return. Your spouse also can't take the credit for child and dependent care expenses because your spouse\u2019s filing status is married filing separately and you and your spouse didn't live apart for the last 6 months of 2024.\nExample 8\u2014unmarried parents.\nYou, your 5-year-old child, Marley, and Marley\u2019s other parent lived together in the United States all year. You and Marley\u2019s other parent aren't married. Marley is a qualifying child of both you and the other parent because Marley meets the relationship, age, residency, support, and joint return tests for both you and the other parent. Your AGI is $12,000 and the other parent's AGI is $14,000. The other parent agrees to let you claim Marley as a qualifying child. This means you can claim Marley as a qualifying child for the child tax credit, head of household filing status, the credit for child and dependent care expenses, the exclusion for dependent care benefits, and the earned income credit, if you qualify for each of those tax benefits (and if the other parent doesn't claim Marley as a qualifying child for any of those tax benefits).\nExample 9\u2014unmarried parents claim same child.\nThe facts are the same as in Example 8, except you and Marley\u2019s other parent both claim Marley as a qualifying child. In this case, only the other parent will be allowed to treat Marley as a qualifying child. This is because the other parent\u2019s AGI, $14,000, is more than your AGI, $12,000. If you claimed the child tax credit for Marley, the IRS will disallow your claim to this credit. If you don't have another qualifying child or dependent, the IRS will also disallow your claim to head of household filing status, the credit for child and dependent care expenses, and the exclusion for dependent care benefits. However, you may be able to claim the earned income credit as a taxpayer without a qualifying child.\nExample 10\u2014child didn't live with a parent.\nYou and your sibling\u2019s child, Reid, lived with your parent all year. You are 25 years old, and your AGI is $9,300. Your parent\u2019s AGI is $15,000. Reid\u2019s parents file jointly, have an AGI of less than $9,000, and don't live with you or Reid. Reid is a qualifying child of both you and your parent because Reid meets the relationship, age, residency, support, and joint return tests for both you and your parent. However, only your parent can treat Reid as a qualifying child. This is because your parent's AGI, $15,000, is more than your AGI, $9,300.\nApplying the tiebreaker rules to divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart).\nIf a child is treated as the qualifying child of the noncustodial parent under the rules described earlier for children of divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart), only the noncustodial parent can claim the child as a dependent and claim the child tax credit, additional child tax credit, or credit for other dependents for the child. However, only the custodial parent can claim the credit for child and dependent care expenses or the exclusion for dependent care benefits for the child. Also, generally, the noncustodial parent can't claim the child as a qualifying child for head of household filing status or the earned income credit. Instead, generally, the custodial parent, if eligible, or other eligible person can claim the child as a qualifying child for those two benefits. If the child is the qualifying child of more than one person for these benefits, then the tiebreaker rules determine whether the custodial parent or another eligible person can treat the child as a qualifying child.\n.The noncustodial parent may be able to claim the self-only earned income credit if they meet other requirements. See Pub. 596 and Schedule EIC and its instructions for more information..\nExample 1.\nYou and your 5-year-old child, Kody, lived all year with your parent in the United States. Your parent paid the entire cost of keeping up the home. Your AGI is $10,000. Your parent's AGI is $25,000. Kody\u2019s other parent lived in the United States all year, but didn't live with you or Kody.\nUnder the rules explained earlier for children of divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart), Kody is treated as the qualifying child of Kody\u2019s other parent, who can claim the child tax credit for the child. Because of this, you can't claim the child tax credit for your child. However, those rules don't allow Kody\u2019s other parent to claim Kody as a qualifying child for head of household filing status, the credit for child and dependent care expenses, the exclusion for dependent care benefits, or the earned income credit.\nYou and your parent didn't have any childcare expenses or dependent care benefits, so neither of you can claim the credit for child and dependent care expenses or the exclusion for dependent care benefits. But Kody is a qualifying child of both you and your parent for head of household filing status and the earned income credit because Kody meets the relationship, age, residency, support, and joint return tests for both you and your parent. (The support test doesn't apply for the earned income credit.) However, you agree to let your parent claim Kody. This means your parent can claim Kody for head of household filing status and the earned income credit if your parent qualifies for each and if you don't claim Kody as a qualifying child for the earned income credit. (You can't claim head of household filing status because your parent paid the entire cost of keeping up the home.) You may be able to claim the earned income credit as a taxpayer without a qualifying child.\nExample 2.\nThe facts are the same as in Example 1, except your AGI is $25,000 and your parent's AGI is $21,000. Your parent can't claim Kody as a qualifying child for any purpose because your parent\u2019s AGI isn't higher than yours.\nExample 3.\nThe facts are the same as in Example 1, except you and your parent both claim Kody as a qualifying child for the earned income credit. Your parent also claims Kody as a qualifying child for head of household filing status. You, as the child's parent, will be the only one allowed to claim Kody as a qualifying child for the earned income credit. The IRS will disallow your parent's claim to head of household filing status unless your parent has another qualifying child or dependent. Your parent can\u2019t claim the earned income credit as a taxpayer without a qualifying child because your parent\u2019s AGI is more than $18,591.\nQualifying Relative\nFour tests must be met for a person to be your qualifying relative. The four tests are:\nAge.\nUnlike a qualifying child, a qualifying relative can be any age. There is no age test for a qualifying relative.\nKidnapped child.\nYou can treat a child as your qualifying relative even if the child has been kidnapped, but the following statements must be true.\n-\nThe child is presumed by law enforcement authorities to have been kidnapped by someone who isn't a member of your family or the child's family.\n-\nIn the year the kidnapping occurred, the child met the tests to be your qualifying relative for the part of the year before the date of the kidnapping.\n-\nIn the year of the child\u2019s return, the child met the tests to be your qualifying relative for the part of the year following the date of the child\u2019s return.\nThis treatment applies for all years until the earlier of:\n-\nThe year there is a determination that the child is dead, or\n-\nThe year the child would have reached age 18.\nA child isn't your qualifying relative if the child is your qualifying child or the qualifying child of any other taxpayer.\nExample 1.\nYour 22-year-old child, who is a student, lives with you and meets all the tests to be your qualifying child. This child isn't your qualifying relative.\nExample 2.\nYour 2-year-old child lives with your parents and meets all the tests to be their qualifying child. This child isn't your qualifying relative.\nExample 3.\nYour 30-year-old child lives with you. This child isn\u2019t a qualifying child because the age test isn\u2019t met. This child may be your qualifying relative if the gross income test and the support test are met.\nExample 4.\nYour 13-year-old grandchild only lived with you for 5 months during the year. Your grandchild isn\u2019t your qualifying child because the residency test isn\u2019t met. Your grandchild may be your qualifying relative if the gross income test and the support test are met.\nChild of person not required to file a return.\nA child isn't the qualifying child of any other taxpayer and so may qualify as your qualifying relative if the child's parent (or other person for whom the child is defined as a qualifying child) isn't required to file an income tax return and either:\n-\nDoesn't file an income tax return, or\n-\nFiles a return only to get a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid.\nExample 1\u2014return not required.\nYou support an unrelated friend and your friend\u2019s 3-year-old child, who lived with you all year in your home. Your friend has no gross income, isn't required to file a 2024 tax return, and doesn't file a 2024 tax return. Both your friend and your friend\u2019s child are your qualifying relatives if the support test is met.\nExample 2\u2014return filed to claim refund.\nThe facts are the same as in Example 1, except your friend had wages of $1,500 during the year and had income tax withheld from their wages. Your friend files a return only to get a refund of the income tax withheld and doesn't claim the earned income credit or any other tax credits or deductions. Both your friend and your friend\u2019s child are your qualifying relatives if the support test is met.\nExample 3\u2014earned income credit claimed.\nThe facts are the same as in Example 2, except your friend had wages of $8,000 during the year and claimed the earned income credit. Your friend's child is the qualifying child of another taxpayer (your friend), so you can't claim your friend's child as your qualifying relative. Also, you can't claim your friend as your qualifying relative because of the gross income test explained later.\nChild in Canada or Mexico.\nYou may be able to claim your child as a dependent even if the child lives in Canada or Mexico. If the child doesn't live with you, the child doesn't meet the residency test to be your qualifying child. However, the child may still be your qualifying relative. If the persons the child does live with aren't U.S. citizens and have no U.S. gross income, those persons aren't \u201ctaxpayers,\u201d so the child isn't the qualifying child of any other taxpayer. If the child isn't the qualifying child of any other taxpayer, the child is your qualifying relative as long as the gross income test and the support test are met.\nYou can't claim as a dependent a child who lives in a foreign country other than Canada or Mexico, unless the child is a U.S. citizen, U.S. resident alien, or U.S. national. There is an exception for certain adopted children who lived with you all year. See Citizen or Resident Test, earlier.\nExample.\nYou provide all the support of your children, ages 6, 8, and 12, who live in Mexico with your parent and have no income. You are single and live in the United States. Your parent isn't a U.S. citizen and has no U.S. income, so your parent isn't a \u201ctaxpayer.\u201d Your children aren't your qualifying children because they don't meet the residency test. But because they aren't the qualifying children of any other taxpayer, they may be your qualifying relatives and you may be permitted to claim them as dependents. You may also be able to claim your parent as a dependent if the gross income and support tests are met.\nTo meet this test, a person must either:\n-\nLive with you all year as a member of your household, or\n-\nBe related to you in one of the ways listed under Relatives who don't have to live with you below.\nRelatives who don't have to live with you.\nA person related to you in any of the following ways doesn't have to live with you all year as a member of your household to meet this test.\n-\nYour child, stepchild, or foster child, or a descendant of any of them (for example, your grandchild). (A legally adopted child is considered your child.)\n-\nYour brother, sister, half brother, half sister, stepbrother, or stepsister.\n-\nYour father, mother, grandparent, or other direct ancestor, but not foster parent.\n-\nYour stepfather or stepmother.\n-\nA son or daughter of your brother or sister.\n-\nA son or daughter of your half brother or half sister.\n-\nA brother or sister of your father or mother.\n-\nYour son-in-law, daughter-in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law.\nExample.\nIn 2018, you and your spouse began supporting your spouse\u2019s unmarried parent, Gene. Your spouse died in 2023. Despite your spouse\u2019s death, Gene continues to meet this test, even if Gene doesn't live with you. You can claim Gene as a dependent if all other tests are met, including the gross income and support tests.\nFoster child.\nA foster child is an individual who is placed with you by an authorized placement agency or by judgment, decree, or other order of any court of competent jurisdiction.\nJoint return.\nIf you file a joint return, the person can be related to either you or your spouse. Also, the person doesn't need to be related to the spouse who provides support.\nFor example, you provide more than half the support of your spouse\u2019s stepparent. Your spouse\u2019s stepparent may be your qualifying relative even if the stepparent doesn't live with you. However, if you and your spouse file separate returns, your spouse's stepparent can be your qualifying relative only if the stepparent lives with you all year as a member of your household.\nTemporary absences.\nA person is considered to live with you as a member of your household during periods of time when one of you, or both, is temporarily absent due to special circumstances, such as:\n-\nIllness,\n-\nEducation,\n-\nBusiness,\n-\nVacation,\n-\nMilitary service, or\n-\nDetention in a juvenile facility.\nIf the person is placed in a nursing home for an indefinite period of time to receive constant medical care, the absence may be considered temporary.\nDeath or birth.\nA person who died during the year, but lived with you as a member of your household until death, will meet this test. The same is true for a child who was born during the year and lived with you as a member of your household for the rest of the year. The test is also met if a child lived with you as a member of your household except for any required hospital stay following birth. The test is also met for an adopted or foster child if you adopted the person in 2024, the person was lawfully placed with you for legal adoption by you in 2024, or the person was an eligible foster child placed with you during 2024 and your main home was the person\u2019s main home for the entire time since the person was adopted or placed with you in 2024.\nIf your dependent died during the year and you otherwise qualify to claim that person as a dependent, you can still claim that person as a dependent.\nExample.\nYour parent, who met the tests to be your qualifying relative, died on January 15. You can claim your parent as a dependent on your return.\nLocal law violated.\nA person doesn't meet this test if at any time during the year the relationship between you and that person violates local law.\nExample.\nYour significant other lived with you as a member of your household all year. However, your relationship violated the laws of the state where you live because your significant other was married to someone else. Therefore, your significant other doesn't meet this test and you can't claim them as a dependent.\nTo meet this test, a person's gross income for the year must be less than $5,050.\nGross income defined.\nGross income is all income in the form of money, property, and services that isn't exempt from tax.\nIn a manufacturing, merchandising, or mining business, gross income is the total net sales minus the cost of goods sold, plus any miscellaneous income from the business.\nGross receipts from rental property are gross income. Don't deduct taxes, repairs, or other expenses to determine the gross income from rental property.\nGross income includes a partner's share of the gross (not net) partnership income.\nGross income also includes all taxable unemployment compensation, taxable social security benefits, and certain amounts received as scholarship and fellowship grants. Scholarships received by degree candidates and used for tuition, fees, supplies, books, and equipment required for particular courses aren\u2019t generally included in gross income. For more information about scholarships, see chapter 1 of Pub. 970.\nDisabled dependent working at sheltered workshop.\nFor purposes of the gross income test, the gross income of an individual who is permanently and totally disabled at any time during the year doesn't include income for services the individual performs at a sheltered workshop. The availability of medical care at the workshop must be the main reason for the individual's presence there. Also, the income must come solely from activities at the workshop that are incident to this medical care.\nA \u201csheltered workshop\u201d is a school that:\n-\nProvides special instruction or training designed to alleviate the disability of the individual; and\n-\nIs operated by certain tax-exempt organizations or by a state, a U.S. territory, a political subdivision of a state or territory, the United States, or the District of Columbia.\nPermanently and totally disabled has the same meaning here as under Qualifying Child, earlier.\nTo meet this test, you must generally provide more than half of a person's total support during the calendar year.\nHowever, if two or more persons provide support, but no one person provides more than half of a person's total support, see Multiple Support Agreement, later.\nHow to determine if support test is met.\nYou figure whether you have provided more than half of a person's total support by comparing the amount you contributed to that person's support with the entire amount of support that person received from all sources. This includes support the person provided from the person\u2019s own funds.\nYou may find Worksheet 2 helpful in figuring whether you provided more than half of a person's support.\nPerson's own funds not used for support.\nA person's own funds aren't support unless they are actually spent for support.\nExample.\nYour parent received $2,400 in social security benefits and $300 in interest, paid $2,000 for lodging and $400 for recreation, and put $300 in a savings account.\nEven though your parent received a total of $2,700 ($2,400 + $300), your parent spent only $2,400 ($2,000 + $400) for your parent\u2019s own support. If you spent more than $2,400 for your parent\u2019s support and no other support was received, you have provided more than half of your parent\u2019s support.\nChild's wages used for own support.\nYou can't include in your contribution to your child's support any support paid for by the child with the child's own wages, even if you paid the wages.\nYear support is provided.\nThe year you provide the support is the year you pay for it, even if you do so with borrowed money that you repay in a later year.\nIf you use a fiscal year to report your income, you must provide more than half of the dependent's support for the calendar year in which your fiscal year begins.\nArmed Forces dependency allotments.\nThe part of the allotment contributed by the government and the part taken out of your military pay are both considered provided by you in figuring whether you provide more than half of the support. If your allotment is used to support persons other than those you name, you can claim them as dependents if they otherwise qualify.\nExample.\nYou are in the Armed Forces. You authorize an allotment for your surviving parent that your surviving parent uses to support themselves and their sibling. If the allotment provides more than half of each person's support, you can claim each of them as a dependent, if they otherwise qualify, even though you authorize the allotment only for your surviving parent.\nTax-exempt military quarters allowances.\nThese allowances are treated the same way as dependency allotments in figuring support. The allotment of pay and the tax-exempt basic allowance for quarters are both considered as provided by you for support.\nTax-exempt income.\nIn figuring a person's total support, include tax-exempt income, savings, and borrowed amounts used to support that person. Tax-exempt income includes certain social security benefits, welfare benefits, nontaxable life insurance proceeds, Armed Forces family allotments, nontaxable pensions, and tax-exempt interest.\nExample 1.\nYou provide $4,000 toward your parent's support during the year. Your parent has earned income of $600, nontaxable social security benefits of $4,800, and tax-exempt interest of $200, all of which your parent uses for self-support. You can't claim your parent as a dependent because the $4,000 you provide isn't more than half of the total support of $9,600 ($4,000 + $600 + $4,800 + $200).\nExample 2.\nYour sibling takes out a student loan of $2,500 and uses it to pay college tuition. Your sibling is personally responsible for the loan. You provide $2,000 toward their total support. You can't claim them as a dependent because you provide less than half of their support.\nSocial security benefits.\nIf spouses each receive benefits that are paid by one check made out to both of them, half of the total paid is considered to be for the support of each spouse, unless they can show otherwise.\nIf a child receives social security benefits and uses them toward their own support, the benefits are considered as provided by the child.\nSupport provided by the state (welfare, food benefits, housing, etc.).\nBenefits provided by the state to a needy person are generally considered support provided by the state. However, payments based on the needs of the recipient won't be considered as used entirely for that person's support if it is shown that part of the payments weren't used for that purpose.\nTANF and other governmental payments.\nUnder proposed Treasury regulations, if you received TANF payments or other similar payments and used the payments to support another person, those payments are considered support you provided for that person, rather than support provided by the government or other third party.\nFoster care.\nPayments you receive for the support of a foster child from a child placement agency are considered support provided by the agency. See Foster care payments and expenses, earlier.\nHome for the aged.\nIf you make a lump-sum advance payment to a home for the aged to take care of your relative for life and the payment is based on that person's life expectancy, the amount of support you provide each year is the lump-sum payment divided by the relative's life expectancy. The amount of support you provide also includes any other amounts you provided during the year.\nTo figure if you provided more than half of a person's support, you must first determine the total support provided for that person. Total support includes amounts spent to provide food, lodging, clothing, education, medical and dental care, recreation, transportation, and similar necessities.\nGenerally, the amount of an item of support is the amount of the expense incurred in providing that item. For lodging, the amount of support is the fair rental value of the lodging.\nExpenses not directly related to any one member of a household, such as the cost of food for the household, must be divided among the members of the household.\nExample 1.\nA married couple lives with their two children and one of their parents. Their parent gets social security benefits of $2,400, which the parent spends for clothing, transportation, and recreation. The parent has no other income. The married couple\u2019s total food expense for the household is $5,200. They pay the parent\u2019s medical and drug expenses of $1,200. The fair rental value of the lodging provided for the parent is $1,800 a year, based on the cost of similar rooming facilities. Figure the parent's total support as follows.\n| Fair rental value of lodging | $ 1,800 | |\n| Clothing, transportation, and recreation | 2,400 | |\n| Medical expenses | 1,200 | |\n| Share of food (1/5 of $5,200) | 1,040 | |\n| Total support | $6,440 |\nThe support the married couple provide ($1,800 lodging + $1,200 medical expenses + $1,040 food = $4,040) is more than half of the parent's $6,440 total support.\nExample 2.\nYour parents, Aubrey and Bailey, live with you, your spouse, and your two children in a house you own. The fair rental value of your parents' share of the lodging is $2,000 a year ($1,000 each), which includes furnishings and utilities. Aubrey receives a nontaxable pension of $4,200, which Aubrey spends equally between Aubrey and Bailey for items of support such as clothing, transportation, and recreation. Your total food expense for the household is $6,000. Your heat and utility bills amount to $1,200. Bailey has hospital and medical expenses of $600, which you pay during the year. Figure your parents' total support as follows.\n| Support provided | Aubrey | Bailey |\n| Fair rental value of lodging | $1,000 | $1,000 |\n| Pension spent for their support | 2,100 | 2,100 |\n| Share of food (1/6 of $6,000) | 1,000 | 1,000 |\n| Medical expenses for Bailey | 600 | |\n| Parents' total support | $4,100 | $4,700 |\nYou must apply the support test separately to each parent. You provide $2,000 ($1,000 lodging + $1,000 food) of Aubrey's total support of $4,100\u2014less than half. You provide $2,600 to Bailey ($1,000 lodging + $1,000 food + $600 medical)\u2014more than half of Bailey\u2019s support of $4,700. You meet the support test for Bailey, but not for Aubrey. Heat and utility costs are included in the fair rental value of the lodging, so these aren't considered separately.\nLodging.\nIf you provide a person with lodging, you are considered to provide support equal to the fair rental value of the room, apartment, house, or other shelter in which the person lives. Fair rental value includes a reasonable allowance for the use of furniture and appliances, and for heat and other utilities that are provided.\nFair rental value defined.\nFair rental value is the amount you could reasonably expect to receive from a stranger for the same kind of lodging. It is used instead of actual expenses such as taxes, interest, depreciation, paint, insurance, utilities, and the cost of furniture and appliances. In some cases, fair rental value may be equal to the rent paid.\nIf you provide the total lodging, the amount of support you provide is the fair rental value of the room the person uses, or a share of the fair rental value of the entire dwelling if the person has use of your entire home. If you don't provide the total lodging, the total fair rental value must be divided depending on how much of the total lodging you provide. If you provide only a part and the person supplies the rest, the fair rental value must be divided between both of you according to the amount each provides.\nExample.\nYour parents live rent free in a house you own. It has a fair rental value of $5,400 a year furnished, which includes a fair rental value of $3,600 for the house and $1,800 for the furniture. This doesn't include heat and utilities. The house is completely furnished with furniture belonging to your parents. You pay $600 for their utility bills. Utilities aren't usually included in rent for houses in the area where your parents live. Therefore, you consider the total fair rental value of the lodging to be $6,000 ($3,600 fair rental value of the unfurnished house + $1,800 allowance for the furnishings provided by your parents + $600 cost of utilities) of which you are considered to provide $4,200 ($3,600 + $600).\nPerson living in their own home.\nThe total fair rental value of a person's home that the person owns is considered support contributed by that person.\nLiving with someone rent free.\nIf you live with a person rent free in that person\u2019s home, you must reduce the amount you provide for support of that person by the fair rental value of lodging the person provides you.\nProperty.\nProperty provided as support is measured by its fair market value. Fair market value is the price that property would sell for on the open market. It is the price that would be agreed upon between a willing buyer and a willing seller, with neither being required to act, and both having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.\nCapital expenses.\nCapital items, such as furniture, appliances, and cars, bought for a person during the year can be included in total support under certain circumstances.\nThe following examples show when a capital item is or isn't support.\nExample 1.\nYou buy a $200 power lawn mower for your 13-year-old child. The child is given the duty of keeping the lawn trimmed. Because the lawn mower benefits all members of the household, don't include the cost of the lawn mower in the support of your child.\nExample 2.\nYou buy a $150 television set as a birthday present for your 12-year-old child. The television set is placed in your child's bedroom. You can include the cost of the television set in the support of your child.\nExample 3.\nYou pay $5,000 for a car and register it in your name. You and your 17-year-old child use the car equally. Because you own the car and don't give it to your child but merely let your child use it, don't include the cost of the car in your child's total support. However, you can include in your child's support your out-of-pocket expenses of operating the car for your child\u2019s benefit.\nExample 4.\nYour 17-year-old child, using personal funds, buys a car for $4,500. You provide the rest of your child's support\u2014$4,000. Because the car is bought and owned by your child, the car's fair market value ($4,500) must be included in your child\u2019s support. Your child has provided more than half of their own total support of $8,500 ($4,500 + $4,000), so this child isn't your qualifying child. You didn't provide more than half of the child\u2019s total support, so the child isn't your qualifying relative. You can't claim this child as a dependent.\nMedical insurance premiums.\nMedical insurance premiums you pay, including premiums for supplementary Medicare coverage, are included in the support you provide.\nMedical insurance benefits.\nMedical insurance benefits, including basic and supplementary Medicare benefits, aren't part of support.\nTuition payments and allowances under the GI Bill.\nAmounts veterans receive under the GI Bill for tuition payments and allowances while they attend school are included in total support.\nExample.\nDuring the year, your child receives $2,200 from the government under the GI Bill. Your child uses this amount for their education. You provide the rest of your child\u2019s support\u2014$2,000. Because GI benefits are included in total support, your child\u2019s total support is $4,200 ($2,200 + $2,000). You haven't provided more than half of your child\u2019s support.\nChildcare expenses.\nIf you pay someone to provide child or dependent care, you can include these payments in the amount you provided for the support of your child or disabled dependent, even if you claim a credit for the payments. For information on the credit, see Pub. 503.\nOther support items.\nOther items may be considered as support depending on the facts in each case.\nThe following items aren't included in total support.\n-\nFederal, state, and local income taxes paid by persons from their own income.\n-\nSocial security and Medicare taxes paid by persons from their own income.\n-\nLife insurance premiums.\n-\nFuneral expenses.\n-\nScholarships received by your child if your child is a student.\n-\nSurvivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance payments used for the support of the child who receives them.\nSometimes no one provides more than half of the support of a person. Instead, two or more persons, each of whom would be able to claim the person as a dependent but for the support test, together provide more than half of the person's support.\nWhen this happens, you can agree that any one of you who individually provides more than 10% of the person's support, but only one, can claim that person as a dependent. Each of the others must sign a statement agreeing not to claim the person as a dependent for that year. The person who claims the person as a dependent must keep these signed statements for their own records. A multiple support declaration identifying each of the others who agreed not to claim the person as a dependent must be attached to the return of the person claiming the person as a dependent. Form 2120, Multiple Support Declaration, can be used for this purpose.\nYou can claim someone as a dependent under a multiple support agreement for someone related to you or for someone who lived with you all year as a member of your household.\nExample 1.\nYou, and your siblings, Sam, Bobbi, and Dani, provide the entire support of your parent for the year. You provide 45%, Sam provides 35%, and Bobbi and Dani each provide 10%. Either you or Sam can claim your parent as a dependent; the one who doesn\u2019t must sign a statement agreeing not to claim your parent as a dependent. The one who claims your parent as a dependent must attach Form 2120, or a similar declaration, to their return and must keep the statement signed by the other for their records. Because neither Bobbi nor Dani provides more than 10% of the support, neither can claim your parent as a dependent and neither has to sign a statement.\nExample 2.\nYou and your sibling each provide 20% of your parent's support for the year. The remaining 60% of your parent\u2019s support is provided equally by two persons who are unrelated. Your parent doesn't live with them. Because more than half of your parent\u2019s support is provided by persons who can't claim your parent as a dependent, no one can claim your parent as a dependent.\nExample 3.\nYour parent lives with you and receives 25% of their support from social security, 40% from you, 24% from a relative, and 11% from a friend. Either you or the relative can claim your parent as a dependent if the other signs a statement agreeing not to. The one who claims your parent as a dependent must attach Form 2120, or a similar declaration, to your parent\u2019s return and must keep for your parent\u2019s records the signed statement from the one agreeing not to claim your parent as a dependent.\nIn most cases, a child of divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart) will be a qualifying child of one of the parents. See Children of divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart) under Qualifying Child, earlier. However, if the child doesn't meet the requirements to be a qualifying child of either parent, the child may be a qualifying relative of one of the parents. In that case, the following rules must be used in applying the support test.\nA child who doesn\u2019t meet the requirements to be a qualifying child of either parent will be treated as the qualifying relative of the child\u2019s noncustodial parent if all four of the following statements are true.\n-\nThe parents:\n-\nAre divorced or legally separated under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance;\n-\nAre separated under a written separation agreement; or\n-\nLived apart at all times during the last 6 months of the year, whether or not they are or were married.\n-\n-\nThe child received over half of the child\u2019s support for the year from the parents (and the rules on multiple support agreements, explained earlier, don't apply).\n-\nThe child is in the custody of one or both parents for more than half of the year.\n-\nEither of the following statements is true.\n-\nThe custodial parent signs a written declaration, discussed later, that they won't claim the child as a dependent for the year, and the noncustodial parent attaches this written declaration to their return. (If the decree or agreement went into effect after 1984 and before 2009, see Post-1984 and pre-2009 divorce decree or separation agreement, later. If the decree or agreement went into effect after 2008, see Post-2008 divorce decree or separation agreement, later.)\n-\nA pre-1985 decree of divorce or separate maintenance or written separation agreement that applies to 2024 states that the noncustodial parent can claim the child as a dependent, the decree or agreement wasn't changed after 1984 to say the noncustodial parent can't claim the child as a dependent, and the noncustodial parent provides at least $600 for the child's support during the year.\n-\nCustodial parent and noncustodial parent.\nThe custodial parent is the parent with whom the child lived for the greater number of nights during the year. The other parent is the noncustodial parent. The term \u201cparent\u201d means a biological or adoptive parent of an individual. It doesn\u2019t include a stepparent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the individual.\nIf the parents divorced or separated during the year and the child lived with both parents before the separation, the custodial parent is the one with whom the child lived for the greater number of nights during the rest of the year.\nA child is treated as living with a parent for a night if the child sleeps:\n-\nAt that parent's home, whether or not the parent is present; or\n-\nIn the company of the parent, when the child doesn't sleep at a parent's home (for example, the parent and child are on vacation together).\nEqual number of nights.\nIf the child lived with each parent for an equal number of nights during the year, the custodial parent is the parent with the higher AGI.\nDecember 31.\nThe night of December 31 is treated as part of the year in which it begins. For example, the night of December 31, 2024, is treated as part of 2024.\nEmancipated child.\nIf a child is emancipated under state law, the child is not under the custody of either parent and time lived with a parent after emancipation does not count for purposes of determining who is the custodial parent.\nAbsences.\nIf a child wasn't with either parent on a particular night (because, for example, the child was staying at a friend's house), the child is treated as living with the parent with whom the child normally would have lived for that night. But if it can't be determined with which parent the child normally would have lived or if the child wouldn't have lived with either parent that night, the child is treated as not living with either parent that night.\nParent works at night.\nIf, due to a parent's nighttime work schedule, a child lives for a greater number of days, but not nights, with the parent who works at night, that parent is treated as the custodial parent. On a school day, the child is treated as living at the primary residence registered with the school.\nWritten declaration.\nThe custodial parent must use either Form 8332 or a similar statement (containing the same information required by the form) to make the written declaration to release a claim to an exemption for a child to the noncustodial parent. Although the exemption amount is zero for tax year 2024, this release allows the noncustodial parent to claim the child tax credit, credit for other dependents, or additional child tax credit, if applicable, based on the child being a qualifying child. The noncustodial parent must attach a copy of the form or statement to their tax return.\nThe release can be for 1 year, for a number of specified years (for example, alternate years), or for all future years, as specified in the declaration.\nPost-1984 and pre-2009 divorce decree or separation agreement.\nIf the divorce decree or separation agreement went into effect after 1984 and before 2009, the noncustodial parent may be able to attach certain pages from the decree or agreement instead of Form 8332. The decree or agreement must state all three of the following.\n-\nThe noncustodial parent can claim the child as a dependent without regard to any condition, such as payment of support.\n-\nThe custodial parent won't claim the child as a dependent for the year.\n-\nThe years for which the noncustodial parent, rather than the custodial parent, can claim the child as a dependent.\nThe noncustodial parent must attach all of the following pages of the decree or agreement to their tax return.\n-\nThe cover page (write the other parent's SSN on this page).\n-\nThe pages that include all of the information identified in items (1) through (3) above.\n-\nThe signature page with the other parent's signature and the date of the agreement.\nPost-2008 divorce decree or separation agreement.\nThe noncustodial parent can't attach pages from the decree or agreement to the tax return instead of Form 8332 if the decree or agreement went into effect after 2008. The custodial parent must sign either Form 8332 or a similar statement whose only purpose is to release the custodial parent's claim to an exemption, and the noncustodial parent must attach a copy to their return. The form or statement must release the custodial parent's claim to the child without any conditions. For example, the release must not depend on the noncustodial parent paying support.\n.The noncustodial parent must attach the required information even if it was filed with a return in an earlier year..\nRevocation of release of claim to an exemption.\nThe custodial parent can revoke a release of claim to an exemption that they previously released to the noncustodial parent. For the revocation to be effective for 2024, the custodial parent must have given (or made reasonable efforts to give) written notice of the revocation to the noncustodial parent in 2023 or earlier. The custodial parent can use Part III of Form 8332 for this purpose and must attach a copy of the revocation to their return for each tax year the custodial parent claims the child as a dependent as a result of the revocation.\nRemarried parent.\nIf you remarry, the support provided by your new spouse is treated as provided by you.\nChild support under pre-1985 agreement.\nAll child support payments actually received from the noncustodial parent under a pre-1985 agreement are considered used for the support of the child.\nExample.\nUnder a pre-1985 agreement, the noncustodial parent provides $1,200 for the child's support. This amount is considered support provided by the noncustodial parent even if the $1,200 was actually spent on things other than support.\nAlimony.\nPayments to a spouse that are alimony or separate maintenance payments, or similar payments from an estate or trust, aren't treated as a payment for the support of a dependent.\nParents who never married.\nThis special rule for divorced or separated parents also applies to parents who never married and lived apart at all times during the last 6 months of the year.\nMultiple support agreement.\nIf the support of the child is determined under a multiple support agreement, this special support test for divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart) doesn't apply.\nSocial Security Numbers (SSNs) for Dependents\nYou must show the SSN of any dependent you list in the Dependents section of your Form 1040 or 1040-SR.\n.If you don't show the dependent's SSN when required or if you show an incorrect SSN, certain tax benefits may be disallowed..\nNo SSN.\nIf a person whom you expect to claim as a dependent on your return doesn't have an SSN, either you or that person should apply for an SSN as soon as possible by filing Form SS-5, Application for a Social Security Card, with the Social Security Administration (SSA). You can get Form SS-5 online at SSA.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf or at your local SSA office.\nIt usually takes about 2 weeks to get an SSN once the SSA has all the information it needs. If you don't have a required SSN by the filing due date, you can file Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, for an extension of time to file.\nBorn and died in 2024.\nIf your child was born and died in 2024, and you don't have an SSN for the child, you may attach a copy of the child's birth certificate, death certificate, or hospital records instead. The document must show the child was born alive. If you do this, enter \u201cDIED\u201d in column (2) of the Dependents section of your Form 1040 or 1040-SR.\nAlien or adoptee with no SSN.\nIf your dependent doesn't have and can't get an SSN, you must show the ITIN or adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN) instead of an SSN.\nTaxpayer identification numbers for aliens.\nIf your dependent is a resident or nonresident alien who doesn't have and isn't eligible to get an SSN, your dependent must apply for an ITIN. For details on how to apply, see Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number.\nTaxpayer identification numbers for adoptees.\nIf you have a child who was placed with you by an authorized placement agency, you may be able to claim the child as a dependent. However, if you can't get an SSN or an ITIN for the child, you must get an ATIN for the child from the IRS. See Form W-7A, Application for Taxpayer Identification Number for Pending U.S. Adoptions, for details.\nStandard Deduction\nMost taxpayers have a choice of either taking a standard deduction or itemizing their deductions. If you have a choice, you can use the method that gives you the lower tax.\nThe standard deduction is a dollar amount that reduces your taxable income. It is a benefit that eliminates the need for many taxpayers to itemize actual deductions, such as medical expenses, charitable contributions, and taxes, on Schedule A (Form 1040). The standard deduction is higher for taxpayers who:\n-\nAre 65 or older, or\n-\nAre blind.\n.You benefit from the standard deduction if your standard deduction is more than the total of your allowable itemized deductions. .\nPersons not eligible for the standard deduction.\nYour standard deduction is zero and you should itemize any deductions you have if:\n-\nYour filing status is married filing separately, and your spouse itemizes deductions on their return;\n-\nYou are filing a tax return for a short tax year because of a change in your annual accounting period; or\n-\nYou are a nonresident or dual-status alien during the year. You are considered a dual-status alien if you were both a nonresident and resident alien during the year.\n.If you can be claimed as a dependent on another person's return (such as your parents' return), your standard deduction may be limited. See Standard Deduction for Dependents, later. .\nStandard Deduction Amount\nThe standard deduction amount depends on your filing status, whether you are 65 or older or blind, and whether another taxpayer can claim you as a dependent. Generally, the standard deduction amounts are adjusted each year for inflation. The standard deduction amounts for most people are shown in Table 6.\nDecedent's final return.\nThe standard deduction for a decedent's final tax return is the same as it would have been had the decedent continued to live. However, if the decedent wasn't 65 or older at the time of death, the higher standard deduction for age can't be claimed.\nIf you are age 65 or older on the last day of the year and don't itemize deductions, you are entitled to a higher standard deduction. You are considered 65 on the day before your 65th birthday. Therefore, you can take a higher standard deduction for 2024 if you were born before January 2, 1960.\nUse Table 7 to figure the standard deduction amount.\nDeath of taxpayer.\nIf you are preparing a return for someone who died in 2024, consider the taxpayer to be 65 or older at the end of 2024 only if the taxpayer was 65 or older at the time of death. Even if the taxpayer was born before January 2, 1960, the taxpayer isn't considered 65 or older at the end of 2024 unless the taxpayer was 65 or older at the time of death.\nA person is considered to reach age 65 on the day before the person\u2019s 65th birthday.\nIf you are blind on the last day of the year and you don't itemize deductions, you are entitled to a higher standard deduction.\nNot totally blind.\nIf you aren't totally blind, you must get a certified statement from an eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist) stating that:\n-\nYou can't see better than 20/200 in the better eye with glasses or contact lenses, or\n-\nYour field of vision is 20 degrees or less.\nIf your eye condition isn't likely to improve beyond these limits, the statement should include this fact. Keep the statement in your records.\nIf your vision can be corrected beyond these limits only by contact lenses that you can wear only briefly because of pain, infection, or ulcers, you can take the higher standard deduction for blindness if you otherwise qualify.\nYou can take the higher standard deduction if your spouse is age 65 or older or blind and:\n-\nYou file a joint return, or\n-\nYou file a separate return and your spouse had no gross income and can't be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer.\nDeath of spouse.\nIf your spouse died in 2024 before reaching age 65, you can't take a higher standard deduction because of your spouse. Even if your spouse was born before January 2, 1960, your spouse isn\u2019t considered 65 or older at the end of 2024 unless your spouse was 65 or older at the time of death.\nA person is considered to reach age 65 on the day before the person\u2019s 65th birthday.\nExample.\nYour spouse was born on February 14, 1959, and died on February 13, 2024. Your spouse is considered age 65 at the time of death. However, if your spouse died on February 12, 2024, your spouse isn't considered age 65 at the time of death and isn't 65 or older at the end of 2024.\n.You can't claim the higher standard deduction for an individual other than yourself and your spouse. .\nThe following examples illustrate how to determine your standard deduction using Table 6 and Table 7.\nExample 1.\nA married couple is filing a joint return for 2024. Both are under age 65. Neither is blind, and neither can be claimed as a dependent. They decide not to itemize their deductions. They use Table 6. Their standard deduction is $29,200.\nExample 2.\nThe facts are the same as in Example 1, except that one of the spouses is blind at the end of 2024. They use Table 7. Their standard deduction is $30,750.\nExample 3.\nA married couple is filing a joint return for 2024. Both are over age 65. Neither is blind, and neither can be claimed as a dependent. If they don't itemize deductions, they use Table 7. Their standard deduction is $32,300.\nStandard Deduction for Dependents\nThe standard deduction for an individual who can be claimed as a dependent on another person's tax return is generally limited to the greater of:\n-\n$1,300, or\n-\nThe individual's earned income for the year plus $450 (but not more than the regular standard deduction amount, generally $14,600).\nIf you (or your spouse if filing jointly) can be claimed as a dependent on someone else's return, use Table 8 to determine your standard deduction.\nEarned income defined.\nEarned income is salaries, wages, tips, professional fees, and other amounts received as pay for work you actually perform.\nFor purposes of the standard deduction, earned income also includes any part of a taxable scholarship or fellowship grant. See chapter 1 of Pub. 970 for more information on what qualifies as a scholarship or fellowship grant.\nExample 1.\nYou are 16 years old and single. Your parents can claim you as a dependent on their 2024 tax return. You have interest income of $780 and wages of $150. You have no itemized deductions and use Table 8 to find your standard deduction. You enter $150 (earned income) on line 1, $600 ($150 + $450) on line 3, $1,300 (the larger of $600 and $1,300) on line 5, and $14,600 on line 6. Your standard deduction, on line 7a, is $1,300 (the smaller of $1,300 and $14,600).\nExample 2.\nYou are a 22-year-old college student and can be claimed as a dependent on your parents' 2024 tax return. You are married filing a separate return. Your spouse doesn't itemize deductions. You have $1,500 in interest income and wages of $3,800 and no itemized deductions. You find your standard deduction by using Table 8. You enter earned income of $3,800 on line 1. You add lines 1 and 2 and enter $4,250 on line 3. On line 5, you enter $4,250, the larger of lines 3 and 4. Because you are married filing a separate return, you enter $14,600 on line 6. On line 7a, you enter $4,250 as the standard deduction amount because it is smaller than $14,600, the amount on line 6.\nExample 3.\nYou are single and can be claimed as a dependent on your parents' 2024 tax return. You are 18 years old and blind, and have interest income of $1,300, wages of $2,900, and no itemized deductions. You use Table 8 to find the standard deduction amount. You enter wages of $2,900 on line 1 and add lines 1 and 2 and enter $3,350 on line 3. On line 5, you enter $3,350, the larger of lines 3 and 4. Because you are single, you enter $14,600 on line 6 and $3,350 on line 7a. This is the smaller of the amounts on lines 5 and 6. Because you checked one box in the top part of the worksheet, you enter $1,950 on line 7b, then add the amounts on lines 7a and 7b and enter the standard deduction amount of $5,300 on line 7c.\nExample 4.\nYou are 18 years old and single and can be claimed as a dependent on your parents\u2019 2024 tax return. You have wages of $7,000, interest income of $500, a business loss of $3,000, and no itemized deductions. You use Table 8 to figure the standard deduction amount. You enter $4,000 ($7,000 \u2212 $3,000) on line 1, add lines 1 and 2, and enter $4,450 on line 3. On line 5, you enter $4,450, the larger of lines 3 and 4, and, because you are single, $14,600 on line 6. On line 7a, you enter $4,450 as the standard deduction amount because it is smaller than $14,600, the amount on line 6.\nWho Should Itemize\nYou should itemize deductions if your total deductions are more than the standard deduction amount. Also, you should itemize if you don't qualify for the standard deduction, as discussed, earlier, under Persons not eligible for the standard deduction.\nYou should first figure your itemized deductions and compare that amount to your standard deduction to make sure you are using the method that gives you the greater benefit.\nWhen to itemize.\nYou may benefit from itemizing your deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040) if you:\n-\nDon't qualify for the standard deduction,\n-\nHad large uninsured medical and dental expenses during the year,\n-\nPaid interest and taxes on your home,\n-\nHad large uninsured casualty or theft losses,\n-\nMade large contributions to qualified charities, or\n-\nHave total itemized deductions that are more than the standard deduction to which you are otherwise entitled.\nIf you decide to itemize your deductions, complete Schedule A (Form 1040) and attach it to your Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Enter the amount from Schedule A (Form 1040), line 17, on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 12.\nElecting to itemize for state tax or other purposes.\nEven if your itemized deductions are less than your standard deduction, you can elect to itemize deductions on your federal return rather than take the standard deduction. You may want to do this if, for example, the tax benefit of itemizing your deductions on your state tax return is greater than the tax benefit you lose on your federal return by not taking the standard deduction. To make this election, you must check the box on line 18 of Schedule A (Form 1040).\nChanging your mind.\nIf you don't itemize your deductions and later find that you should have itemized\u2014or if you itemize your deductions and later find you shouldn't have\u2014you can change your return by filing Form 1040-X.\nMarried persons who filed separate returns.\nYou can change methods of taking deductions only if you and your spouse both make the same changes. Both of you must file a consent to assessment for any additional tax either one may owe as a result of the change.\nYou and your spouse can use the method that gives you the lower total tax, even though one of you may pay more tax than you would have paid by using the other method. You both must use the same method of claiming deductions. If one itemizes deductions, the other should itemize because the other spouse won't qualify for the standard deduction. See Persons not eligible for the standard deduction, earlier.\n2024 Standard Deduction Tables\n.If you are married filing a separate return and your spouse itemizes deductions, or if you are a dual-status alien, you can't take the standard deduction even if you were born before January 2, 1960, or are blind..\nTable 6.Standard Deduction Chart for Most People*\n| IF your filing status is... | YOUR standard deduction is... |\n| Single or Married filing separately | $14,600 |\n| Married filing jointly or Qualifying surviving spouse | 29,200 |\n| Head of household | 21,900 |\n| * Don't use this chart if you were born before January 2, 1960, or are blind, or if someone else can claim you (or your spouse if filing jointly) as a dependent.
