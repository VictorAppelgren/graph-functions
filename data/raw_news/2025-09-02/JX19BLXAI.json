  "description": "The Sony WF-C710N are fantastic value for money",
  "content": "If you\u2019re looking for great headphone deals, whether you\u2019re in the US or the UK, there\u2019s one name that stands out right now. Today, you can buy the Sony WF-C710N Earbuds at Amazon US for $89.99 (was $129.99), or get the same earbuds at Amazon UK for \u00a379 (was \u00a399.99).\n\nIn the US, that\u2019s not quite the cheapest-ever price, as they dropped as low as $78 earlier in the year \u2013 but it is the second-best price we\u2019ve ever seen. In the UK, it\u2019s the lowest they\u2019ve ever been and the first-ever price cut for the popular earbuds, which punch well above their weight.\n\nWe\u2019ve previously described the Sony WF-C710N Earbuds as the \u201cbest earbuds for noise cancellation you can get for the price\u201d. Lofty praise indeed from our audio expert, and the price cut makes them even more appealing to those who want more for less.\n\nOur Sony WF-C710N earbuds review is full of praise, awarding the buds an impressive 4.5-star review. Described as \u201coutrageously good for the level\u201d, these earbuds boast vastly improved active noise cancellation, better call quality and stamina, and handy additions like auto-off.\n\nAuto-off is a feature you\u2019d expect as standard with pricier fare, but there are more expensive entries in the best earbuds which lack that. For the price, these are the best budget earbuds around if you\u2019re keen to enjoy a reliable brand with features like auto-off, Multipoint and strong ANC.\n\nIf you want to spend more on the best wireless earbuds, there are some good AirPods deals around. If you\u2019re looking for an over-ears solution, why not check out the Bose headphone deals going on?",

      "text": "The best wireless earbuds, all real-world tested: I've covered wireless buds for 10 years, and these are the best for all budgets\nOur reviewers spent well over 600 hours testing the earbuds in this guide: here\u2019s my definitive verdict\nI\u2019ve been managing guides to the best wireless earbuds for over five years, and testing and reviewing earbuds for well over a decade now, so I understand better than most the myriad options out there in 2025, and how confusing it can be to find the perfect one for you \u2013 and crucially, at the right price.\nI crafted this guide to the best wireless earbuds alongside our Audio Editor, Becky Scarrott (formerly of What Hi-Fi?) to make choosing a new pair of buds as simple as possible. You\u2019ll see that each pair was championed by one of us, and we tell you specifically why we chose them. The selections are based on around 600 hours of testing by us and our expert reviewers. Of course, we tested many more earbuds besides the ones you'll see recommended here, directly comparing the each proposition to the known class-leaders at the price and with strict adherence to our rigorous earbuds testing methodology.\nI want to make sure we cover all key needs \u2013 different budgets, different phone platforms, and different levels of audiophilia. So let's talk more about budget for a moment: these days, few people buy earbuds at full price, instead waiting until the (very regular) sales events. In some ways, those are the real prices of these earbuds, so I\u2019ve tried to include the price you should aim to pay in each write-up. I hope this helps you find a set you'll be happy with, for a competitive real-world price.\nThe quick list\nWant to cut to the chase and find out which wireless earbuds are the best? Below, you\u2019ll find a roundup of our choices. You can also jump to a more detailed review of every pick, along with our price comparison tool to help you find the best deals.\nBest overall\nThe best wireless earbuds overall\nThese highly accomplished buds are all-rounders, delivering excellent sound, strong ANC, and features like triple-point connectivity. Comfortable, versatile, and great across the board, they\u2019re easily our top pick.\nBest mid-range\nThe best mid-priced wireless earbuds\nWe gave these buds a rare 5-star score in our review \u2013 and for good reason. In terms of build quality, features and, most notably, performance, they far exceed expectations for the price. An easy recommendation.\nBest budget\nThe best budget wireless earbuds\nNothing delivers fun and expansive audio, high-quality active noise cancellation, good app-based features, and the company's signature cool design, all for a fantastic budget price.\nBest for ANC\nThe best wireless earbuds for noise blocking\nThe new best-of-the-best for noise cancellation, and with a really enjoyable and lively sound to match. Despite being slightly chunky, they comfortable and secure in the ear, too.\nBest for Apple\nThe best wireless earbuds for Apple fans\nThese work seamlessly with Apple products for auto-switching between devices, using Find My if they're lost, Dolby Atmos spatial audio, and more. The sound and ANC are superb, too.\nBest open earbuds\nThe best wireless open earbuds\nOpen earbuds are booming, and these rank among the best-sounding pairs we\u2019ve tested, and are very well-priced. They're also very comfortable, though there's no ANC and the app is a pain to load on Android.\nLoad the next products...\nBest for Samsung\nThe best wireless earbuds for Samsung users\nThese buds have special sauce with Samsung phones, including very hi-res audio and spatial audio, that makes them a perfect fit, along with great sound and noise cancellation.\nBest for sound\nThe best wireless earbuds for supreme sonic clarity\nWith the best sound we\u2019ve heard from wireless buds, the Pi8s are an audiophile\u2019s dream. ANC is as good as Bose, fit is excellent, and there\u2019s optional wired connection. Our top pick for sound \u2013 but honestly, they\u2019re amazing all-round.\nBest for battery life\nThe best wireless earbuds for battery life\nWith 10 hours from the buds with ANC on, and 48 hours from the case, these earbuds go on and on and on. The cool screen on the case is a highlight too, as is the sound.\nI lead TechRadar\u2019s audio coverage, and I\u2019ve worked in tech writing and editing for 17 years. I actually worked on TechRadar before it even launched 17 years ago, and this is my third stint here. As a writer, I reviewed early neckband wired earbuds, and as an editor I\u2019ve covered the rise of true wireless earbuds ever since the very first models around nine years ago. I\u2019ve tested these products over their whole evolution from \u2018convenient but weird\u2019 to \u2018the main kind of earbuds that anyone buys\u2019. I developed the earbuds testing methodology used for reviewing the buds in this guide.\nAbout this guide\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nTesting and enjoying wireless earbuds is inherently a subjective experience \u2013 while you can measure their audio output scientifically, that doesn\u2019t automatically translate into musical talent, and doesn\u2019t tell you much about their value. But testing subjectively also makes it hard to rate and rank them, since we can\u2019t demonstrate it over the internet, so here\u2019s how I approach it.\nThe main thing is that we\u2019ve scored and rated these earbuds in different areas in comparison to each other, based on our direct comparisons, so that while our scores in this guide might be subjective, they are still consistent. To ensure that consistency, we created our earbuds testing methodology, to make sure that reviewers are using some of the same tracks for sound comparisons (our playlist is public, and you can try it at home), with equivalent-quality audio sources, and are testing the microphones and battery life in the same way.\nMicrophones are the one part of wireless earbuds\u2019 performance that can be communicated over the internet, so while we\u2019ve scored them here, I\u2019ve also included recordings so that you can make your own judgement.\nWe check and update this guide all the time, looking for how new releases or price drops may affect our rankings \u2013 I include an update log, so that we\u2019re transparent about how it\u2019s evolved over time.\nAugust 4, 2025\nSwitched the Nothing Ear (a) to our 'Best budget' option after recent price drops. Added the Cambridge Audio A100 as our 'Best mid-range' pick. Removed the 'Best cheap ANC' entry, because that's now well covered by the Nothing. Added the new Bose QuietComfort Ultra 2nd Gen as our best pick for active noise cancellation. Added several new entries we've recently tested into the 'More we've tested' section based on recent reviews.\nThe best wireless earbuds you can buy\nThe best wireless earbuds overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n1-minute summary: I'm blown away by what the Technics EAH-AZ100 can do. Even though they're far from cheap, they're somehow amazing value, because they not only pack in so many great features (including triple-point Bluetooth connectivity, which is still something only the older Technics EAH-AZ80 and this newer model can do), but they sound absolutely phenomenal with the active noise cancellation turned on, thanks to their Magnetic Fluid speaker driver, which has been distilled from Technics' much more expensive in-ear monitors. It's a bit of a shame that they sound noticeably worse with the ANC turned off, though I personally never have it turned off, so this minor flaw won't stop me from loving these buds. I should also note that if the best possible noise cancellation is your priority, then Bose still has these beat \u2013 but the ANC is very good in general.\nThe Technics are just such incredible all-rounders, and offer so much: they're comfortable and fairly light, they switch instantly between three devices of any platform, they support Dolby Atmos from any compatible device, they sound good enough to satisfy audiophiles, the 10-hour battery life with ANC on is great\u2026 their faults are real picky stuff, and I think they're the real deal for most people.\nRead our full Technics EAH-AZ100 review\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want a vibrant and revealing sound: With the ANC turned on, these walk the very fine line between being insightful and honest to the music, and being energetic and just plain fun to listen to.\n\u2705 You want to switch between devices easily: The triple-point connectivity is almost unique, and makes it seamless to move between phone, tablet and laptop without re-pairing no matter what company they're from.\n\u2705 You want comfortable and fairly small buds: Technics has fit all of this tech into lightweight and pretty small earbuds, so they're good for people for small or larger ears, and stay comfortable for long periods.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You like to listen without noise cancellation turned on: The sound is immediately and clearly weaker when you turn the ANC off, so if you like to do that often, they're not such a hit.\n\u274c You need the absolute best noise cancellation: They don't do this badly at all, but the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds at #4 on the list can do it just that bit better.\n\u274c You're on a budget: They're so good that they're easily worth the price of $299 / \u00a3259, but several premium options here \u2013 plus their predecessor, the Technics EAH-AZ80 \u2013 can be found for significantly less.\nShow full expert analysis \u25bc\nIn-depth analysis\nYou can't really fault these buds in this department. Wireless connectivity includes regular Bluetooth audio, plus LDAC hi-res support, and future-proof LC3 Bluetooth LE Audio tech. You can tweak the sound from the app using the EQ settings. Battery life is really strong in most standard use cases, with 10 hours of life with ANC on from the buds \u2013 though this can go up to 12 with ANC off, or down to around seven when using LDAC's higher-quality streaming. 10 hours is a great result for standard listening, though. You can charge them over USB-C (with 90 minutes of use from a 15-minute quick charge) or wirelessly. There's adaptive noise cancellation that's very effective even if it's not quite best-in-class, and there's a 'Voice Focus AI' mode for picking up your voice more clearly in calls. The cream and sprinkles on this well-stacked cake are the head-tracked Dolby Atmos spatial audio support, and the triple-point Bluetooth pairing. This means the AZ100 can stay connected to three devices at one, switching between them instantly when needed, no matter who made them. Pretty much no other earbuds offer this, except Technics' own AZ80, and it's so useful.\nThe sound quality of the Technics EAH-AZ100 is pretty damn stunning, especially for a pair of earbuds priced competitively with other mainstream premium earbuds, and not priced like the hardcore audiophile stuff. We said in our review that \"they\u2019re a balanced and insightful listen, more than capable of bringing order to the ear no matter how unruly a recording might think it is.\" They're very highly detailed, but not unforgivingly so, and can lay out all the elements of a recording with total precision and control. But they're not analytical or plain; they have an expert level of depth and energy across the frequencies to help you get lost in those well-laid tracks. We said that \"low-frequency activity is deep, punchy and textured\" while \"the midrange is open and informative, with a whole stack of detail.\" Treble is solid and committed without become overly hard at any point. They're basically the ideal balance between being revealing and insightful to original recordings, and adding entertainment to get you through commute. However\u2026 that's all the case with the ANC turned on. With it turned off, we said \"low frequencies lose a degree of substance, and the overall presentation becomes rather flimsy and lightweight.\" Competitors manage to hold the same sound profile in both modes, so this is the only flaw here.\nThese are Technics' smallest and lightest flagship true wireless earbuds yet, and they come with give different sizes of in-ear tips in the box \u2013 which is to say: Technics really wants you to be comfortable, and it succeeded. The black and silver finishes are nice, and they feel very well-made. The carrying case is pleasingly slimline, so it won't bulge in a pocket, and it feels solid. The touch controls work well in our experience, and you can customize what they do. The app is well laid-out as well, though it's maybe not a masterpiece of visual design.\nThe Technics EAH-AZ100 are easily worth their asking price of $299 / \u00a3259 / AU$499. In fact, when you compare them to other earbuds of the same price, they start to look like a huge bargain \u2013 how has Technics' got this many features in, without sacrificing audio quality to the value gods, in a size this small? Obviously, they're still a high price, though, and they lack aptX hi-res support, which is really the only knock to their value package.\nTechnics EAH-AZ100 test results\nSound quality (ANC on) | 5 / 5 |\nSound quality (ANC off) | 4 / 5 |\nMic quality | 4 / 5 |\nBattery life (ANC on) | 10 hours |\nBattery life (ANC off) | 12 hours |\nThe best mid-range wireless earbuds\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n1-minute summary: Cambridge Audio\u2019s true wireless earbuds have always been good, but the Melomania A100 take them to a new level of bang-for-your-buck. We gave these earbuds a rare full five stars in our review because, for a very reasonable price, you get everything you need. They\u2019re packed with features, including solid noise cancellation, a neat charging case, and thoroughly entertaining sound. When it comes to getting truly satisfying sound, I don't think you can do any better for the price \u2013 but you don't have to give up on modern features to get there. A connoisseur's choice, without the price tag that usually comes with such a label.\nRead our full Cambridge Audio Melomania A100 review\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You have a high-quality source player: With top-tier codec support and excellent sound quality, the A100 buds are the ideal match for serious audio setups.\n\u2705 You prefer a tailored fit: The ultra-slim charging case slips easily into any pocket \u2013 no bulky bulges or outfit compromises required.\n\u2705 You appreciate the extras: If the name Matt Berry means anything to you, having him as your audible feedback voice is a small but endlessly enjoyable bonus.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want spatial audio or a few more advanced features: The feature list here is good, but it doesn't quite have everything.\n\u274c You like a splash of color: Plenty of similarly-priced rivals come in more than just black or white, if variety is your thing.\n\u274c You prioritize bass: Look, the sound is great here, especially for the money. But we did note in our review that at the low-end there are some integration issues.\nShow full expert analysis \u25bc\nIn-depth analysis\nThe Cambridge Audio Melomania A100 buds are packed with features, and what you get here is so very good for the price. There are buds that cost much, much more that don\u2019t boast specs this good. For starters, they feature Bluetooth 5.4 with support for aptX Adaptive, aptX Lossless, and LDAC, plus multipoint pairing. Six mics handle ANC, calls, and voice control, enhanced by echo-cancelling tech for clearer sound. They use Class AB amplification, which is a step above the usual Class D, alongside a dual-core Qualcomm Kalimba DSP and 10mm Neodymium drivers for crisp and powerful audio. Battery life will give you up to 11 hours (or 39 with the case) with noise cancellation turned off, and a 10-minute quick charge gives you more than three hours of playback. A full recharge takes around 70 minutes via USB-C. They\u2019re also IPX5-rated, so they\u2019ll handle sweat, everyday splashes and light rain with ease. The intuitive Melomania app offers EQ presets, a 7-band equaliser, ANC settings (including \u2018low\u2019, \u2018medium\u2019 and \u2018high\u2019), gaming mode, sleep mode and wear detection. An added bonus is audible feedback is voiced by actor and comedian Matt Berry \u2013 great news if you\u2019re a fan.You don't get spatial audio, or a few other tweaks you might get elsewhere \u2013 but we can easily live without them.\nThe Melomania A100 buds deliver a lively, detailed and balanced sound that manages to avoid the overblown bass that can be common at this price point. Highs are crisp without harshness, mids are open and expressive, and bass is punchy yet controlled. Now, there is a slight disconnect between the low-end and midrange, but the overall cohesion and tonality impress. The soundstage is spacious and well-defined, with strong dynamics and clarity even in more complex orchestral tracks. Despite their precision, these buds do manage to remain engaging and fun to listen to. Active noise cancellation is also excellent here for the price. It\u2019s effective, unobtrusive and capable of handling most external noise without affecting sound quality all that much.\nThe Cambridge Audio Melomania A100 earbuds go for a sleek stem-style design, weighing just 4.7g per earbud for a light and comfy fit. The compact charging case is pocket-friendly, though it is slightly fiddly to open. Available in black or white, build quality and finish are excellent here. Touch controls are reliable.\nWith the Melomania A100, Cambridge Audio has knocked it out of the park. These true wireless earbuds offer features and performance that outshine anything else at this price. They're comfortable, packed with features, easy to control and sound exceptional. For $149 / \u00a3119, nothing else comes close in value.\nCambridge Audio Melomania A100 test results\nSound quality (ANC on) | 4.5 / 5 |\nSound quality (ANC off) | 4.5 / 5 |\nMic quality | 2.5 / 5 |\nBattery life (ANC on) | 6 hours |\nBattery life (ANC off) | 11 hours |\nThe best wireless earbuds on a budget\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n1-minute summary: I cannot believe the price of these earbuds for what you get. Not only do they look the absolute business, they sound it too. Nothing's 2024-issue earbuds are the cheaper siblings to the flagship Nothing Ear (which launched on the self-same day), but unless you want the hearing test and subsequent personalized sound profile reserved for the flagship set, I'd save your money and opt for these. You do get in-ear detection, excellent ANC, a low-lag toggle for gaming, detailed sound quality, issue-free multipoint to two devices, an ear tip fit test plus a Find My Earbuds feature, which issues a rattlesnake-style sound from whichever bud you're trying to locate. They're a joy to listen to, especially given their lowly sub-$100 / \u00a3100 asking fee, which continues to be reduced in price. And let's not forget that those pinch-able stems now offer you a direct line to ChatGPT whenever you need it, as long as you have a Nothing phone with the latest Nothing OS installed. Hardly nothing worth shouting about, I think you'll agree\u2026\nRead our full Nothing Ear (a) review\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want great ANC for less: These offer the best noise-nixing power we've heard for the price.\n\u2705 You go for serious sound quality: The Ear (a) are a seriously fun and zealous listen, aided by their support for LDAC higher-res wireless tech.\n\u2705 You like your tech bold-looking: I've never had so many people stop me and ask what my earbuds are (I had the yellow set).\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want spatial audio support: The similarly priced Sony WF-C700N offer this from certain services, but you won't find it here.\n\u274c You need top-tier stamina: 5.5 hours with noise cancellation on is distinctly average \u2013 again, the Sony buds mentioned above offer 7.5 hours.\n\u274c You'd like Nothing's hearing test and personalized sound profile: For that, you'll need to shell out a little more, for the flagship Nothing Ear.\nShow full expert analysis \u25bc\nIn-depth analysis\nIf you need buds that do what's casually referred to as 'the basics' today \u2013 fuss-free fit, good sound, great ANC, clear calls, bit of EQ adjustment, decent on-ear controls \u2013 these are that product. And they do better than the basics too: if you've got a Nothing Phone (2), Phone (1) or Phone (2a), Nothing has integrated both its Nothing earbuds and Nothing OS with ChatGPT, to offer users instant access to the chatbot directly from those pinch stems. However comfortably you sit with AI's introduction, it certainly adds value at the level. Nothing's Clear Voice Technology has been upgraded here, and it makes call-handling a breeze. Also here: Bluetooth 5.3 and LDAC support for higher-res audio, which is a rarely-seen inclusion at this level. There's no onboard spatial audio wizardry, and you don't get the Nothing Ear's curated sound profile tech (which is similar to the Ear (2)'s splendid personalized hearing tests, if you're familiar). However, you do get in-ear detection, a low-lag toggle for gaming, issue-free multi-point pairing to two devices, an ear tip fit test and a Find My Earbuds feature, which issues a rattlesnake-style sound from whichever bud you're trying to locate. You can opt for High, Mid, Low, and Adaptive noise cancellation profiles. High is very good: you can see why it drops the battery life from 9.5 hours without ANC to 5.5 with it\u2026\nHow good's the sound quality in the Nothing Ear (a)? Stream the intro of The Who's Substitute \u2013 ideally on an Android phone with LDAC support. Tell me those guitar strings and shaker aren't every bit as spine-tingling as you could ever hope to get for such a low price\u2026 But you don't need to use hifalutin' codecs to get the goods \u2013 even when I stream lossy Spotify tracks (or better Apple Music ones, from my iPhone) the Nothing Ear (a) buds deal with them admirably. For dynamic build and nuance, the Nothing Ear (a) are meaty and arresting, prioritizing fun and energy over that integrated hi-fi listen some might prefer \u2013 but for me, I can't pick fault with that; not when there's so much here to celebrate sonically. As long as you don't expect them to be better than something that sells at nearly three times the price (which would hardly be fair), the Nothing Ear (a) will delight you.\nCan I just say that I really dig the design here and leave it at that? So many people said they loved the look of them. You've got pictures after all\u2026 oh, we need more? OK, well the case is transparent which means you'll know if you've put 'em both back in to charge, but here are plenty of flourishes here which will make you go 'ah, nice'. One is the pinch stems, which work even if you have gloves on (unlike touch capacitive options), another is the right-red, left-white dots also help you match the colors for charging. Also, it is emphatically not a case of 'same buds, different box' from Nothing with this iteration. The drivers are different to all Nothing Ears that have been before them and although they're smaller, they're better \u2013 it's all to do with tweaks to the dual-chamber design under the hood, which now includes two extra vents for improved airflow and means Nothing's been able to get 10%-15% flow more from the Ear (a)'s driver. After switching out to the smaller ear tips (you only get three, but it's plenty with this design), I also find the Ear (a) to be a cinch to wear \u2013 although if you've particularly small ears you may need to try before you buy, and my guide to the best earbuds for small ears is worth consulting. You don't get wireless charging support at this price, but the IPX2 rating of the case (for mild water resistance) is more than you get with plenty of pricier options, and the earbuds themselves boast an IP55 rating, which means they're dust- and water-resistant.\nThey're five-star buds for a reason. Despite being as good-looking as any earbuds can be for this money, it's not a case of style over substance; the ANC is excellent for the level and you even get LDAC and ChatGPT support for extra sound-per-pound value. As always, I want to note that if you're prepared to spend $299 / \u00a3279 / AU$429 (aka triple the money) there's better noise-cancellation available in the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, but that's hardly a fair fight. At one point, I would've nudged you towards the Sony WF-C700N at this price-point, but considering the Nothing Ear (a) are getting cheaper and cheaper, in my honest opinion, the Nothing look more stylish and perform easily as well. They're hands-down our best budget choice these days.\nNothing Ear (a) test results\nSound quality (ANC on) | 4.5 / 5 |\nSound quality (ANC off) | 4.5 / 5 |\nMic quality | 3.5 / 5 |\nBattery life (ANC on) | 5.5 hours |\nBattery life (ANC off) | 9.5 hours |\nThe best wireless earbuds for ANC\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n1-minute summary: Just when I thought Bose\u2019s noise-cancelling chops couldn't get much better in a set of earbuds, the QCU Earbuds 2 land on my desk and prove me wrong. I enjoyed the greater dynamism, punch, energy and zeal this time around \u2013 and their ability to do great work with sound applies to the ANC too. This particular Bose iteration provides a sonic backdrop as welcomingly silent, cocoon-like and relaxing as I\u2019ve ever experienced in an in-ear design. But that's far from the end of the praise where this particular Bose vintage is concerned \u2013 and yes, that is a reference to the wine-like colorway. This time around, you also get an embedded wax guard to avoid any gunk sneaking past the outer shells, wireless charging from the box, and multi-point connectivity that works seamlessly, things the original Ultras bizarrely lacked on their release. Some of the best earbuds on the market for energetic sound and class-leading noise cancellation? Without a doubt.\nRead our full Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen) review\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 Noise cancellation is paramount: These earbuds block outside sound better than anything else we've tested to date.\n\u2705 You like an exuberant, energetic sound: When it comes to vibrancy and attack, Bose's new buds are overflowing \u2013 they're a really enjoyable listen.\n\u2705 You want to feel a secure fit: These Bose buds are somewhat bulky, but they're held in place safely by fitting both in the ear canal and sitting against the outside of the ear too.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want a more neutral, hi-fi sound: We had a great time with the super-lively sound, but purists may prefer the Technics or Bowers & Wilkins options here.\n\u274c You want a slim, light bud: At 7.7g per earbud, they rank among the heavier options \u2013 you'll feel them in the ear more than some here.\n\u274c You're on a budget: Getting the best noise cancellation available doesn't come cheap \u2013 though you might find the first-gen Ultras for a good deal these days.\nShow full expert analysis \u25bc\nIn-depth analysis\nThe new Bose Ultra are largely the same as the first, but now you get wireless charging included in the case as standard (the previous model required a weird accessory to add this). So that means you get Snapdragon Sound for higher-res audio support with a compatible phone, a custom head-tracked spatial audio system that works with every audio source (and is quite impressive), Bose's CustomTune tech that customizes the sound for your ear shape automatically, and multi-point Bluetooth pairing to two sources. Obviously, the active noise cancellation is the star of the show, and it's not just that it's the best at actually doing the work \u2013 we also love the different modes and adjustments that Bose makes possible within its app. They're easy to fiddle with, and it's definitely worth having different settings for the office than a busy commuter bus. Minor downside to note: the EQ adjustments are just three-band, when most rivals will over between five and 10. The battery life of six hours remains very much average.\nThe ANC isn't the only impressive thing coming from these buds \u2013 the sound quality is top-tier as well. In the review, we said \"sonically, the QCUE 2nd Gen are a rare treat across the frequencies\", and praised how well they can punch down with bass while still leaving textured and layered mids room to breathe, and treble that shines above the rest of the mix. They're earbuds capable of giving that greatest of audio gifts: unlocking new elements of your favorite music. We said that they reveal \"sonic articles that lesser earbuds cannot unearth\", and are great for detail. The only thing to note is they're a particularly lively set of buds, and some people prefer a more neutral approach. We said that \"for detail and neutrality, you'll get just a little more from the aforementioned Technics EAH-AZ100, but for bass impact and zeal, the Bose buds take it.\" If you like big energy in your music, these will satisfy.\nThese are so similar in design to the previous Bose Ultra that only an expert could tell them apart \u2013 unless you get the beautiful new plum color option, of course. Outside of that, the only obvious change from the last model is a new insert in the ear tip, over the driver, designed to keep ear wax at bay. This means that they're still pretty bulky earbuds by today's standards, but we didn't mind this \u2013 the combination of a good in-ear fit, plus an extra rubber grip on the outside, keeps them in place solidly but comfortably. There are different options for both in-ear and the external 'fins', but a fit check mode in the app will tell you if they're in properly, so you know you're getting the best seal against outside noise.\nThese are obviously not cheap at all at $299 / \u00a3299 / AU$450, but they're also priced in-line with other premium earbuds, and yet the noise cancellation is a clear step beyond any of them. And now that Bose has really nailed the sound and added the few missing features we wanted that previous versions lacked, we have to say that we can't find any fault with the price in comparison to the competition.\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds test results\nSound quality (ANC on) | 5 / 5 |\nSound quality (ANC off) | N/A |\nMic quality | 4 / 5 |\nBattery life (ANC on) | 6 hours |\nBattery life (ANC off) | N/A |\nThe best wireless earbuds for Apple fans\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n1-minute summary: I still use AirPods Pro 2 all the time, for exactly the reason they remain the most popular earbuds on the planet: they work so seamlessly with my Apple gear, they sound great, they're super-light and comfortable, and the active noise cancellation is right near the top of the class. The auto-switching between devices is so useful, and as a movie fan I really enjoy the Dolby Atmos spatial audio support. And I can't tell you how often I've made use of the nearly-unloseable case, with tech that means your iPhone can literally point you towards them (and the case can make noise). But I also don't want to understate how much I like their small and slim case, and non-bulky bud design. As with all AirPods, they're only really recommendable if you only want to connect them Apple gear, because they lack device-neutral multi-point switching or any kind of app control on Android. You can get better sound quality too, and Bose beats them for noise cancellation power. But as a complete package for Apple users, AirPods Pro 2 are incredibly hard to argue with \u2013 and because they regularly drop to under $170 / \u00a3180, they're actually excellent value too.\nRead our full Apple AirPods Pro 2 review\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want superb sound and noise cancellation: The audio quality is extremely strong, and the noise cancellation is nearly as good as you can right now.\n\u2705 You're in the Apple ecosystem: They've got lots of extra features for iPhone users, including Spatial Audio and Find My support \u2013 and they switch seamlessly between all your devices.\n\u2705 You want small and light earbuds: The case is smaller and slimmer than the competition, and the buds themselves are lighter than average.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want good battery life: These are distinctly average when it comes to the battery \u2013 most buds match or beat them, even with similar features.\n\u274c You want to involve non-Apple devices: Android users miss out on the majority of features, and they won't auto-switch between an iPhone and, say, a Windows PC.\n\u274c You want them in anything other than white: We really wish Apple would offer some colors, like it does for AirPods Max. But no.\nShow full expert analysis \u25bc\nIn-depth analysis\nLet's start with the assumption that you're the Apple-head that the AirPods Pro 2 want you to be. They're deeply rich in features, including lots of cutting-edge tech to match the best competitors. There's excellent active noise cancellation that's amazing at cutting out everything from engine noise to office chatter, and an Adaptive Transparency Mode that lets in outside sound, but constantly tweaks how much depending on whether loud noises are happening. They have options such as Conversation Awareness, that drops the ANC when someone speaks to you, too. The head-tracked spatial audio support is great, and works with Dolby Atmos 3D sound \u2013 and will be personalized for your ear shape, helping precision and quality. The AirPods auto-switch between Apple devices, and you don't need to pair them \u2013 if your iCloud is signed in, they'll switch when you try to play something, which works really well and is very useful. The Find My support here is best-in-class \u2013 a UWB chip means your iPhone can literally point an arrow towards your hidden AirPods case, and the case can play a sound when needed. Battery life is rather average at around six hours with ANC on (less with spatial audio on as well), but you get lots of charges from the case, so it's fine. And the AirPods Pro 2 are even approved as hearing aids for mild-to-moderate hearing loss, and they'll check your hearing. Now, if you're not on iPhone, you get basically none of these features except noise cancellation. And it's also a shame that there's no hi-res audio support even now.\nThe AirPods Pro 2 offer seriously impressive sound, reaching from deep bass to sweet and natural high notes. We said in our review that they have \"a clear ability to separate out different elements in the music, a strong ability to reproduce bass, a crispness in voice especially, and all combined with excellent spatial a0udio playback and mind-blowing noise cancellation.\" They're well-suited to basically any genre, though they have a slightly energetic and forward presentation that makes them a little more suited to pop and rock than acoustic or classic \u2013 but that's if we're being picky. Audiophiles will find an extra step of clarity, insight and range from other options \u2013 especially if you step up to the Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 \u2013 but the AirPods Pro 2 overall offer extremely strong sound for music, and their head-tracked spatial audio is excellent for movies. It really feels like you're in a home theater with speakers, rather having sound pushed directly in your ears, and the AirPods Pro 2 handle speech well, and have enough dynamic range to feel exciting in movies.\nThe AirPods Pro 2 are extremely well-made, and both the case and buds are smaller than almost any other premium earbuds. The case feels absolutely solid, as do the buds. Both are rated for IPX4 waterproofing, so should stand up to sweat or being rained on a little. At 5.3 grams (0.19 ounces) each, the buds are as light as high-end earbuds come, and whole not everyone likes the stick design, it does help to put their center of gravity near your head, so they feel like they'll stay solidly in your ears without also feeling weighty. On the famous sticks, you've got pinch-based controls for pausing music or switching ANC modes, and we love this: it's much more comfortable than pushing a button into your ear, and more reliable than touch controls, and works with gloves. You can also swipe the stems to change volume, though this doesn't work with gloves. In the current version, there's a USB-C port for charging, as well as wireless charging tech that works with Qi, MagSafe and even the Apple Watch's charger.\nWith an official price now of $249 / \u00a3229 / AU$399, AirPods Pro 2 are very good value compared to the likes of the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds Ultra or Sony WF-1000XM5, given their features \u2013 especially with the addition of a hearing-aid mode (in countries where this has launched). But even better is that they regularly drop to around $169 / \u00a3179, and they're really exceptional value for that price. But their value is all based around you having all the Apple gear to make the most of them!\nApple AirPods Pro 2 test results\nSound quality (ANC on) | 4.5 / 5 |\nSound quality (ANC off) | 4.5 / 5 |\nMic quality | 4.5 / 5 |\nBattery life (ANC on) | 6 hours |\nBattery life (ANC off) | 9 hours |\nThe best wireless open earbuds\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n1-minute summary: Open earbuds are booming in popularity, and from the options available today, I think the Huawei FreeArc are the best for msot people, by a hair. These are the best-sounding open wireless earbuds we\u2019ve tested so far for close to this price, with a soundstage and energy that outshine the rest. While open designs tend to sacrifice audio detail for situational awareness, the FreeArc buds manage to balance both. They\u2019re also comfortable, lightweight and stay secure during workouts as well as day-to-day life. The IP57 rating is a nice bonus too, making them great for outdoor or gym use. I do have some caveats, though: there's no ANC, and you have to sideload the Android app if you want to use it, though iPhone and Huawei users won\u2019t have this issue. But the FreeArc still strike an impressive balance between comfort, sound quality and value, and I think they're the best alternative to the more traditional in-ear buds in this guide for this price.\nRead our full Huawei FreeArc review\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You care about sound quality: If audio fidelity matters to you but you still want the benefits of an open design, the FreeArc buds are your best bet.\n\u2705 You\u2019re working with a mid-range budget: The Huawei FreeArc may not be super-cheap but if you're spending in the mid-range, they offer excellent value for money.\n\u2705 You have an iPhone or Huawei phone: Android users might struggle with the app setup, but iPhone and Huawei users can expect a smoother experience.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want to wait between charges: There's decent battery life from the buds themselves, but the case only adds 23 hours total. If you don\u2019t regularly top up your devices, that might feel a little limiting.\n\u274c You want to listen in noisy places: They shine in quiet settings, where the sound quality can really stand out. But in loud environments, background noise can easily overpower your audio.\n\u274c You have an Android phone and want to use the app: As we've mentioned, installing the app is frustrating for Android users. Not impossible, but possibly not worth it \u2013 though you can use them without the app.\nShow full expert analysis \u25bc\nIn-depth analysis\nThe Huawei FreeArc buds keep things fairly simple feature-wise. You\u2019ll get the basics you need here, such as touch controls, Bluetooth 5.3 and voice assistant support, along with a companion app for customization. However, some rivals are charging ahead with extras, particularly with active noice cancellation, which the FreeArc lack. The IP57 rating means the earbuds are dust and water resistant, which is great news for workouts. But the charging case has no water protection and feels a little basic overall. Battery life clocks in at 7 hours per charge with a total of 23 hours using the case, which is fine but definitely not best-in-class these days. One of the most notable downsides here is that Android users may find the app difficult to access and install, though things are much smoother on iOS or Huawei phones. So while they\u2019re not the most feature-packed option, the FreeArc buds still deliver what matters most in this category.\nWhere the FreeArc truly shine is sound. For an open design, the audio is stunningly good. You get a wide soundstage, punchy bass, and crisp highs, which is a rare combo in buds that don\u2019t sit in your ear canal. Music feels alive, energetic and full of detail, especially in quiet environments. The tuning is refined and balanced whatever you're listening to, offering enough presence to rival some traditional wireless earbuds. We found ourselves repeatedly surprised by the clarity and fullness of the audio. That said, the lack of ANC means they\u2019re best used in quieter spaces. If sound is your top priority and you want to stay aware of your surroundings, these are as good as open earbuds get.\nThe FreeArc buds are thoughtfully designed for comfort and stability. They're open and lightweight with a design that gently hugs the outside of your ear, staying secure without the need to wedge into your ear canal. That\u2019s a big win if you find traditional earbuds uncomfortable. During testing, they held firm during runs and workouts, outperforming many other open designs. The IP57 rating means they\u2019re built to withstand sweat, rain and dust. For open earbuds, getting both comfort and stability right is a rare feat and we're happy to say that Huawei has nailed it here.\nFor the price, the Huawei FreeArc buds offer exceptional value. Open earbuds often make compromises when it comes to sound but the FreeArc don\u2019t just hold their own, they outperform much of the competition. The sound is far better than you\u2019d expect at this price and the stable, comfortable design makes them ideal for everyday use, especially if you need awareness of your surroundings. If you\u2019re looking for open wireless earbuds that actually sound great and feel good to wear all at a fairly affordable price for most people, this is the pair we\u2019d recommend first.\nHuawei FreeArc test results\nSound quality (ANC on) | N/A |\nSound quality | 5 / 5 |\nMic quality | 2.5 / 5 |\nBattery life (ANC on) | N/A |\nBattery life | 7 hours |\nThe best wireless earbuds for Samsung fans\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n1-minute summary: I think it's fair to say that Samsung took some pages from the AirPods book with its latest Pro earbuds, switching them to 'golf club' design with stems, and keeping some of their best features exclusive to Samsung Galaxy devices. It means that for users of other Android devices, I'd generally point you to other options \u2013 but for Samsung owners, they're pretty damn great, and those exclusive options are juicy. The head-tracked spatial audio is really effective, and Samsung's devices support Dolby Atmos, so you're getting the best version of it. The 24-bit Hi-Res Audio support is kind of mind-blowing as a feature, and means you really eke the most out of music streaming services with lossless support. The AI features are not really essential yet, but I suspect they'll get developed and improved rapidly, so they're future-proof. Most importantly, these earbuds sound excellent and offer strong active noise cancellation, so make an excellent package for the Galaxy fans \u2013 especially because Samsung tends to get aggressive with discounts, so they'll probably be great value if you buy smartly.\nRead our full Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You have a Samsung Galaxy phone: The Buds 3 Pro offer a load of extra smarts when used with Samsung phones, including spatial audio and AI features.\n\u2705 You want Samsung's best audio quality: Samsung's 24-bit audio (again, if you have its own phones to use with the buds) is superb for elite music fans.\n\u2705 You want strong active noise cancellation: These are highly effective at cutting off the outside world, without being big and bulky.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want big features on another phone brand: General Android users won't get as much from these buds, and iPhone users don't even get an app to control them.\n\u274c You want the absolute best value: They're excellent, but they're not cheap, and non-Samsung owners won't get as much out of them.\n\u274c You don't like a stick design: Samsung changed from its previous buds-only design to a stick design that's especially futuristic. It won't be for everyone.\nShow full expert analysis \u25bc\nIn-depth analysis\nThe Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are well-equipped, but mostly if you have a Samsung phone to match them with. The active noise cancellation is seriously good no matter what phone you have, and impressed us a lot \u2013 but there's an AI-powered Adaptive mode for it that only works with Samsung phones, though we found it not to make much of a difference. The other AI features are also, frankly, not much of a draw. However, the Samsung-exclusive head-tracked spatial audio works well, and the (also exclusive) 24-bit/96kHz wireless audio support is a very nice boon for music fans who use the likes of Tidal or (perhaps improbably) Apple Music for higher-quality files. There's no multi-point switching between non-Samsung devices, so while they're very well-featured for Samsung owners, anyone else is better off elsewhere.\nOur review said that these are \"some of the best wireless earbuds I\u2019ve tested for sound\", and this was helped by the (Samsung exclusive) Ultra High Quality Sound wireless tech and the Adaptive EQ for personalizing the audio. We found the sound to be energetic and dynamic, with great weight to the bass and clarity to the treble. The soundstage is wide, and songs get the chance to be suitable big when they should be, and with individual instruments able to be picked out of the mix easily. They're right up there with the best buds for this kind of price.\nThe move to an AirPods-like design with a stick, instead of the circular blob design that Samsung previously used, will divide people. Doubly so, since the stem is triangular and has a light on it \u2013 very angular and futuristic. However, they're lightweight, and they're comfortable to wear, so if you don't mind the look, there are no complaints in using them generally. However, we found the eartips to be difficult to remove safely \u2013 it's very easy to tear them. So be careful if you need a size other than Medium; pull carefully by grabbing near where they attach to the buds, and keep your nails well clear.\nThe official price of $249 / \u00a3219 / AU$399 is very competitive against other premium earbuds if you're a Samsung owner \u2013 less so otherwise, since so many options are locked away. However, Samsung often does aggressive deals on its earbuds during sales season, so you might see some prices much lower than this \u2013 they'll become even better if so. But again, we'd still say they're really for Samsung owners only.\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3 test results\nSound quality (ANC on) | 4.5 / 5 |\nSound quality (ANC off) | 4 / 5 |\nMic quality | 3.5 / 5 |\nBattery life (ANC on) | 6 hours |\nBattery life (ANC off) | 7 hours |\nThe best wireless earbuds for sound\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n1-minute summary: Let's not be coy; the Pi8 are are completely different to the unreliable (and quite uncomfortable) Pi7 S2 that Bowers & Wilkins put its name to before them. The company approached the challenge of solving the older siblings' snafus with both humility and grace too, completely redesigning the driver housings \u2013 to look, it must be said, not unlike the also-excellent 2023 Technics EAH-AZ80 \u2013 and adding an upgraded DAC, DSP and amplifier. Yes, the Pi8 effectively bypass Qualcomm's digital-to-analog converter for even better audio quality compared to their direct rivals. B&W's commitment to sound doesn't surprise me though; what does is fact that they can nullify noise as well the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds or the AirPods Pro 2. That feeling of being wrapped in a comforter of silence happens, but without any sense of wind-tunnel nausea. Also, you finally get on-ear volume control, which something I've been begging companies to implement for years, particularly in this premium sector. There's no spatial audio with head-tracking and no ear-tip fit tests or hearing profiles. No, B&W wants music (unaltered and at its most detailed) to be the star of the show here and the company has met the brief and then some. I cannot fault the sound quality the Pi8 earbuds are able to deliver wirelessly, or when using the case as a transmitter for aptX Adaptive quality at up to 24-bit/96kHz. And that is not something I often write.\nRead our full Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 review\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You prioritize sound quality above all else: These buds offer the most zealous, balanced, detailed audio I've heard in a true wireless earbuds design. And the ANC? It's top-tier too.\n\u2705 You want buds that really fit: B&W has reworked everything here. Put them in and just leave them \u2013 no twisting, wedging or jamming them in again.\n\u2705 You want a wired connection too: The case for the Pi8 can be connected to USB-C ports or 3.5mm ports, and beams the sound to the buds in high quality \u2013 perfect for in-flight entertainment.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want spatial audio: No dice here, I'm afraid, in any form.\n\u274c You want personalized sound tests: No, you don't get that here either.\n\u274c You need to access ANC profiles and volume at all times: You have to choose between on-ear volume control, scrolling between your ANC profiles, or accessing your voice assistant.\nShow full expert analysis \u25bc\nIn-depth analysis\nAside from the excellent ANC (have I said it enough? The noise cancellation here is really very good) there's also a useful 'Pass Through' mode that lets you hear a colleague talking next to you \u2013 on the odd occasion you really need that. There's no 'adaptive' ANC option and I don't care \u2013 when the full-fat version works this well, why get granular? Now, the ace up the sleeve: aside from the no-nonsense, pocketable appeal of the Pi8's case, you can plug that USB-C port (USB-C to 3.5mm and USB-C cables are supplied) into a non-Bluetooth wired source and it'll double as a wireless audio re-transmitter in aptX Adaptive quality up to 24-bit/96kHz. Yes, in-flight entertainment systems and tray tables just got much less stressful! There are no hearing tests, ear-tip fit tests, personalized sound profiles or head-tracked spatial audio processing here, but these are things we can live without. They more than make up for it in other areas.\nI don't know if I've ever written a TechRadar 'Sound' review section so wholly positive. It feels as if the B&W Pi8 happily unpack, weigh, open out, examine, layer and finally present whatever music I send to them with the talented hand of a French p\u00e2tissier, revealing juicy bass frequencies few earbuds can relay. I'm also struck by the pin-point accuracy of article placement in mixes. Vocals spring out from my cheekbones, my temples and beneath my chin in raucous and zealous mixes. Refreshingly, noise cancellation and ambient profiles never make anything go off kilter either. For musicality, neutrality, attack, drive, dynamic nuance, balance across the frequencies and all the other things I usually pick apart, Bowers & Wilkins' back-to-the-drawing-board approach has paid off. Wow, these earbuds sound good\u2026\nThe redesign here was necessary, even if the earpieces might not look quite as high-end as the metallic, Swiss-watch style driver housings of the Pi7. It's a plastic build, but it's premium matte plastic that seems to murmur 'I'm expensive' and the point is, they fit so well you'll feel a millionaire when wearing them. (Are you a millionaire? Thank you for stopping by.) The mic and sensors on the older Pi7 models weren\u2019t in the best position, but this has all been fixed for Pi8. Right under the touch-sensitive top plate are the mics and sensors \u2013 as far away from your head and ear folds as it's possible to put them. I typically switch to the smaller set when choosing ear tips, but since the neck of the earbud isn't long (and the design is so well weighted), I don't think the tip size is too important here. They might look a little bulky (and they do weigh 7g each), but they fit naturally and unobtrusively. One minor negative (and it's similar to the one I encountered with the JBL Live Beam 3, directly below this entry) is that you need to ditch a set of on-ear control functions again. Yes, you can now get on-ear volume control by long-pressing either Pi8 earbud, but to get it you need to forego scrolling through ANC profiles and access to your voice assistant. That's where my gripes end though, because when you factor in that case retransmission feature, this is a beautiful design from Bowers & Wilkins \u2013 and a ripping up of the design playbook that probably didn't come easy.\nSonically the Pi8 are the best earbuds I've heard in a wireless design, and I accept that you need to pay a premium for that \u2013 because the inescapable truth is that the Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 are not cheap. Want excellent, unadulterated, high-quality audio in a comfortable build? It's here. Basically, if you value sound quality above all else, this is the product I'd point you to. It's not the cheapest, but it is the best for sound. For stamina however, the Pi8 can be beaten (it's no good having great audio and wireless transmission from the case if you're caught needing a battery top-up before the flight), and if you want spatial audio, or hearing tests mixed in with the ANC, you'll also be better served with other options in this list.\nBowers & Wilkins Pi8 test results\nSound quality (ANC on) | 5 / 5 |\nSound quality (ANC off) | 5 / 5 |\nMic quality | 4 / 5 |\nBattery life (ANC on) | 6.5 hours |\nBattery life (ANC off) | 8.5 hours |\nThe best wireless earbuds for battery life\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n1-minute summary: The fact that they're in this guide as my 'best for battery' recommendation is valid \u2013 there's a whacking great touchscreen on the box and try as I might, I couldn't get it to affect the 12-hour stamina within the earbuds, or the 48-hour total including the case, during my tests. I'll be honest though, I also really wanted to get these earbuds into this guide to highlight both their lock-screen wallpaper novelty (which might put people in mind of the Polaroid stickers people used to adorn their phones with a few years ago), and that their sound is deadly serious. The audio quality in the Live Beam 3 is delicious; that famous Harman curve of rich bass and elevated treble, now represented in the best way. Also of note is Personi-Fi, which creates an excellent personalized sound profile, and JBL's splendid call-handling perks. OK, the spatial audio profiles didn't wow me, and the ANC is fine rather than ground-breaking, but so much else did surprise me that they're more than worthy of a spot here. And did I mention, they're not even JBL's flagship earbuds, so prices are refreshingly low?\nRead our full JBL Live Beam 3 review\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want the best battery: If you want a reliable pair of buds you'll rarely need to charge, you've found them. 10 hours with ANC on from the buds, and 48 hours total is massive.\n\u2705 You like cool new tech ideas: Some people might think the screen on the case is a gimmick, others will love this addition and make great use of it \u2013 it works well.\n\u2705 You enjoy personalized sound profiles: Fire up JBL's Personi-Fi test and get to listening \u2013 you'll soon see what all the fuss is about.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You're not always a fan of in-ears: They were comfy during testing, but some people might find they go too far into your ear canals.\n\u274c Spatial audio is a priority: You do get some sense of immersion, but you won't get that directional, three-dimensional 'where are my earbuds' style presentation here.\n\u274c You want only-the-best ANC: The noise-cancellation here is good and there are plenty of options for tweaking it \u2013 but you won't get that 'bubble of silence' feeling you get from Bose earbuds\nShow full expert analysis \u25bc\nIn-depth analysis\nYou think I'm going to lead with the smart case don't you? Sorry\u2026 Call-handling is fantastic, thanks to the numerous options JBL's supplied to enhance it, including Sound Level Optimizer, Sound Setting, Voice Setting, VoiceAware and Private Call Mode \u2013 all of which I've explained in-depth in my review. Suffice to say that during my tests, a combination of these meant my friend on the other end said I sounded as if I was just talking on the phone \u2013 rare. That surgical attention to detail continues across the board with the Live Beam 3. Take the EQ: six EQ presets; Adaptive EQ for real-time adjustments; the option of toggling on 'Low Volume EQ' and even 'Leakage Compensation' to sort the sonics if the tips you've fitted don't provide a tip-top seal. ANC is a similar story. Customize functionality by toggling Adaptive ANC and/or Auto Compensation, which adjusts things based on your ear canal and wearing status once more \u2013 and if you switch Adaptive ANC off, you're presented with a slider that offers seven increments of noise-nixing. Does it nix noise as deftly as the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds or the AirPods Pro 2 can? Not quite. And she same goes for the JBL Beam 3's spatial audio profiles (movies, music or gaming have been supplied). But that's the only reason I knocked half a star off in this rating. And I haven't even mentioned Personi-Fi! After various hearing tests, you're presented with a written report, which offers a mini verdict on the compensation required for each ear and a shiny new profile just for you. And the screen means that if you like putting a picture of your dog, snake or significant other on your earbuds (and why ever not?) there's no other case currently on the market that'll let you do that.\nIt seems a shame to listen to lowly Spotify streams when Sony's LDAC (from a compatible device such as a Sony Xperia smartphone) is on the menu. The JBL Live Beam 3 are cohesive, responsive and zealous across the frequencies. They're able to unearth an extra ounce of detail through the strummed guitars and vocal in Noah Kahan's acoustic Stick Season, but can also serve up Melissa Etheridge's guttural I'm the Only One vocal confidently and without muddying the track's bass-walking, axe-stalking grimy country feel. This sound sees JBL at its best again, and you love to see it \u2013 sonically, they're a huge hit. Think big, exuberant sound that knows when to have it large, but also when to pull back just a touch to let certain instruments shine. It feels like high-end sound for mid-range money, and again, that's a rare thing.\nDespite my small ears, I found these easy to wear, although it's worth noting that the earpiece design does sit quite far into your ear canals. Those who find this kind of fit claustrophobic \u2013 see also, AirPods Pro 2 \u2013 may want to look at JBL's other designs, although again, it may not be an issue for you. The on-ear touch functions require a compromise (you need to ditch a set of functions \u2013 either Playback Control, Ambient Sound Control, or Volume Control) which is a minor negative when other options let you do it all, but that's where my criticism ends. You'll either love the case or hate it, but I think it's very fun. It means the box is deeper than your average case, but the little lanyard loop on the top right (as you look at the screen) is very cute \u2013 because you've now got lock-screen wallpaper to show off! What you need to know is that the build quality \u2013 not just of the case but of the buds nestled inside (and the companion app keeping everything accessible and in check) \u2013 feels resoundingly expensive. And actually, it isn't.\nThe JBL Live Beam 3's enviable battery life plus the joyous sound and call quality (with their plethora of customizations) are more than worthy of the money here. And the noise cancellation will serve all but the most picky. Oh, and there's the fun touchscreen case \u2013 which doesn't affect the commendable stamina. Given the competitive asking price of the JBL Live Beam 3 (Bose's closest alternative costs $299 / \u00a3299 / AU$449, which is $100 / \u00a3120 or AU$200 more than the JBL \u2013 and there's no screen on the case there) there's an incredible amount to enjoy here for the money.\nJBL Live Beam 3 test results\nSound quality (ANC on) | 4 / 5 |\nSound quality (ANC off) | 4 / 5 |\nMic quality | 4 / 5 |\nBattery life (ANC on) | 10 hours |\nBattery life (ANC off) | 12 hours |\nBest wireless earbuds test results comparison\nMore wireless earbuds we've tested\nAceFast AceFit Pro: A pair of open buds that look cool, but ultimately disappoint in several key areas, including a poor battery life, lack of features and several critical design issues. Read our full AceFast AceFit Pro review to find out more.\nAKG N5: There\u2019s plenty to like about the AKG N5, from impressive audio quality to a solid feature set. But design quirks and underwhelming battery life hold them back from standing out in a competitive field. As we found in our full AKG N5 review, they\u2019re premium buds, just not quite at a price that feels justified.\nApple AirPods 4: Apple's newest ice-white stemmed buds arrived in September 2024, in two flavors. You can see our full AirPods 4 review for our thoughts on the non-ANC model, but the cheaper set don't feature here because, honestly, we think you can do better for your money.\nAnker Soundcore Liberty 5: These Anker buds are a great cheaper alternative to AirPods, which is what they're probably designed to be. They deliver detailed audio, solid bass and they're packed with features. Audiophiles would ultimately be disappointed, however, and ANC isn't anything special either. But do take a look at our Anker Soundcore Liberty 5 review for the full story.\nAnker Soundcore Aeroclip: Open earbuds are having a real moment, and as you\u2019ll see in our Anker Soundcore Aeroclip review, we loved this fresh take on the form factor, which clips around your ear. The audio is surprisingly good, and the fit is comfortable. There\u2019s some sound leakage and not quite enough waterproofing to make them a top pick \u2013 but if you\u2019re after an open design, they\u2019re well worth checking out.\nAnker Soundcore C40i: Another pair of open earbuds that have some notable pros, like decent 3D audio and an impressive bass response. But they ultimately can't compete with the sheer amount of top-performing rivals in this category, especially when comfort and battery life are lacking. Take a look at our full Anker Soundcore C40i review for more.\nApple AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation: These sound great and have noise cancellation that's far better than we ever expected anything without a real in-ear seal to achieve. They also have impressive spatial audio, and lots of other smart features for iPhone users, which we explored in our AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation review. However, the AirPods Pro 2 are basically always around the same price as these, and they're superior, so these don't make the list while that's true.\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (1st Gen): The audio and ANC superiority of the new model has kicked these out of our list above, but if you can find them for a great discount while stocks last, we'd happily recommend them! They'll be a bargain around the $200 / \u00a3200 mark \u2013 especially because their noise cancellation is still second-best-in class. Here's our full Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds review for more on them.\nBowers & Wilkins Pi6: These B&W buds feel premium, are comfortable to wear and sound great. As you'll see from our Bowers & Wilkins Pi6 review, we really enjoyed testing them. However, they are a little pricey, especially considering they're light on some of the top-tier features we'd expect to see, and we experienced some minor connectivity issues.\nCMF Buds Pro 2: We recently tested these budget buds that come in a range of funky color options that put the usual beige, white and black options to shame. And we liked parts of them very much in our CMF Buds Pro 2 review, but the overall package just doesn't match the likes of the Nothing Ear (a) above, or other options.\nEarfun Air 2 NC: These budget wireless earbuds are well worth considering if you're looking for effective ANC at a very low price. However, read our Earfun Air 2 NC review and you'll discover they don't deliver in terms of detail and we don't love the design either. Still, for the money they're not bad at all.\nEdifier Lolliclip: Another strong open earbud option, the Lolliclip wraps around your ear and delivers impressive sound for the design. Uniquely, they also offer health tracking features like heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring. The companion app is a bit underwhelming, and EQ options are limited \u2013 but definitely check out our full Edifier Lolliclip review if you\u2019re curious.\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro 2: Battery life in Google's August 2024-issue flagship buds is good, plus they're small and (hang it all) ridiculously cute-looking, but otherwise these Google buds were sadly disappointing across the board. We don't want to knock them any more here \u2013 we just want you to be aware of why they're not featured \u2013 but read our Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 review to find out why.\nHappy Plugs Clip: Another pair of open earbuds and while these may look cool and we liked the charging case, they ultimately disappointed in some critical ways. Audio quality is poor, they're lacking in features and the design leaves a lot to be desired. Read the full details in our Happy Plugs Clip review.\nHuawei FreeArc: If you\u2019re curious about the open earbud trend, Huawei\u2019s FreeArc buds are a great place to start. You\u2019ll get top-tier sound, a comfortable fit, and a solid price point. As we note in our Huawei FreeArc review, they\u2019re not flawless \u2013 getting the app can be tricky on some devices, and battery life is just okay \u2013 but if you\u2019re intrigued, they\u2019re well worth a closer look.\nJLab Epic Open Sport: With thumping bass and an open ear design, these buds are a great choice for fitness. But they're not exactly cheap and competition is fierce in the open earbuds space, which is why they didn't quite make this guide but are still well worth considering if you need sports buds. Take a look at our full JLab Epic Open Sport review for more.\nLG xboom Buds: We\u2019re not going to lie, we were a bit disappointed by these buds. Yes, they sound good, especially the bass, and you get solid Auracast support plus a great companion app. But they fall short on style and comfort, which kept them out of our top picks. However, it\u2019s worth reading our full LG xboom Buds review if you\u2019re curious.\nNoble FoKus Rex5: These bold-looking buds are finished to an incredibly high standard with great specs and a sound we described as \"speedy and insightful\" in our Noble FoKus Rex5 review. However, if your ears are on the small side, you're unlikely to get on with them as they're quite big. And if you like bass, they're lacking a bit in that low end.\nOpenRock S: The open earbuds category is getting competitive and the OpenRock S do a good job at justifying themselves, with a stable fit, solid battery and affordable price. But they feel a little too functional with a charging case that's too chunky and an overall sound that falls short when compared to rivals. Read all the details in our OpenRock S review.\nSony LinkBuds Fit: We rated these as being some of the most comfortable and stable earbuds we've ever tested in our Sony LinkBuds Fit review, which is obviously perfect for the fitness audience they're aimed at. We said that their \"bold sound\" is ideal for workouts, and while the ANC isn't amazing, it does a good enough job. Annoyingly, though, the touch controls aren't as reliable as we'd like, and we really think they should come with more sizes of in-ear tips. Still, if you want Sony quality in workout buds, they're well worth consideration.\nSony WF-1000XM5: A massive pair of earbuds (metaphorically \u2013 they're really rather small in literal terms) that aren't on our list. Why? Well, they're good, but we don't think they're better than competing models at the same price \u2013 ie. Bose and Technics. As we said in our Sony WF-1000XM5 review, the ANC was sadly weaker than expected, and sonically they are beaten by the Technics EAH-AZ100 sitting pretty at the top of this guide.\nSony WF-C700N: These are five-star earbuds, and you can read why in our full Sony WF-C700N review, but the short version is that they're super-comfortable, have lots of great features, and sound fantastic for their affordable price. So why aren't they in the list? Because the Noting Ear (a) kicked them out by hitting all of the notes above, but slightly better in most ways. It's a tough world out there\u2026\nSony WF-C710N: If you\u2019re after another budget-friendly option, check out our Sony WF-C710N review. They\u2019re not in this main guide because they\u2019re not perfect \u2013 no LDAC support, the new colorway looks a bit cheap, and the on-ear controls could be better. But if you want affordable ANC that performs surprisingly well, they\u2019re definitely worth a look.\nXiaomi Buds 5 Pro: Xiaomi's February 2025-issue wireless buds are better than the non-Pro Buds 5 (we tested the 'regular' Bluetooth option, not the concurrently-released Wi-Fi-enabled set) but they're twice the price, and although our Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro review is largely positive, we just felt there are better options out there for the money.\nHow to choose the best wireless earbuds\nWith so many wireless earbuds to pick from, how do you know which are right for you? There are a few key considerations you need to bear in mind.\nThe first is price. How much can you afford? You can get a good pair of wireless earbuds for under \u00a3100/$100. But often you do get what you pay for in terms of connectivity, build and noise cancellation.\nNext up is form. Do you intend to hit the gym, bike or pavement with your earbuds? Then you'll need a design that'll stay put. Or maybe small and minimal is what you're after, so opt for a pair of discrete true wireless buds.\nThe best sounding earbuds are exactly that \u2013 our pick of the wireless earbuds that sound fantastic. These are far from the best cheap earbuds out there, but if you're passionate about hearing music with clarity, richness and powerful bass, these are the ones you need to consider.\nIt's still important to pick earbuds that feel good in your ears, but the models in our guide above have been picked for sound quality first and foremost, with those that excel in extra features such as noise cancellation or workout-friendly designs noted separately.\nWhat kind of speakers do wireless earbuds use?\nAll the wireless earbuds in our guide produce their sound using dynamic drivers, so that's one tech element you don't have to thing about. This is the most common kind of speaker technology in everything from big loudspeakers to over-ear headphones to earbuds. To explain how dynamic drivers work, and why they\u2019re so dominant in wireless earbuds, we spoke to Andy Kerr, Director of Product Marketing and Communications at Bowers & Wilkins, which has over 60 years of experience creating these kinds of drivers in both headphones and loudspeakers.\n\u201cDynamic drivers use a magnet, a voice coil (typically made from winds of copper wire wound around a circular form), and a diaphragm/drive unit (a thin cone of material that makes the sound). The narrow end of the diaphragm's cone is attached to the voice coil; the wide end of the diaphragm is held in place by a rubber surround, also called \u2018suspension\u2019. When electrical current is supplied to the voice coil, it becomes electromagnetic. This creates a push-pull interaction between the coil and the magnet, which it is coiled around, causing the coil to move up and down over the magnet rapidly. Since the coil is attached to the bottom of the drive unit, its movement pushes the drive unit up and down in response, creating sound pressure waves that your ears and brain translate into sound,\u201d explains Kerr.\n\u201cA single dynamic driver can be made very compact, is light, and is highly efficient in terms of battery life, which is of course hugely relevant in the age of wireless earbuds. Dynamic drivers are also very popular in headphone designs essentially because they give companies like Bowers & Wilkins a way to use our knowledge and experience from designing and manufacturing them \u2013 for both loudspeakers and headphones \u2013 while customizing and continually improving the technology over time. For example, our approach to drive unit design combines stiffness in the material (for accuracy and fast response) plus good excursion (meaning how far the diaphragm is capable of moving, for deeper bass performance) that's equally important for both earbuds and loudspeakers.\"\nDynamic drivers are not the only earbuds driver technology available: planar magnetic is the most common other type, and we\u2019re about to see the launch of more earbuds using a new solid-state driver. Some earbuds also combine a dynamic driver with a smaller solid-state driver to create a wider sound range, which is often known as dual-driver technology. It\u2019s possible to have more than two drivers in earbuds, but it\u2019s very uncommon in wireless earbuds.\nWhat is noise cancellation in earbuds?\nOne of the hottest features in wireless earbuds right now is active noise cancellation (ANC) \u2013 this used to be the preserve of premium buds, but is now common even among many budget models.\nAll in-ear earbuds block some noise thanks to the seal formed between the ear tips and your ear canal. This stops a lot of noise coming in, and is known as 'passive' sound isolation.\nBut active noise cancellation goes a step further to remove outside noise from what you're hearing. The technology was introduced by Bose, and the company has been making ANC tech for over 30 years, so we asked John Rule, Senior Engineer at Bose Corporation, to explain noise cancellation.\n\"Today, noise cancellation in the majority of headphones and earbuds is achieved through a combination of both active and passive technologies. For active noise reduction, sophisticated electronics work with microphones both inside and outside the earcups to sense the sound around you and then measure, compare, and react \u2013 instant by instant \u2013 to produce an opposing cancellation signal,\" says Rule.\nImagine you're trying to walk in a straight line, and someone is pushing you from one side to stop you walking straight. That's outside noise, interfering with what speakers are trying to do. Now imagine someone pushes you from the other side in a way that exactly balances out the first push, so you're walking straight again \u2013 that's active noise cancellation, counteracting the interference by 'cancelling' it out.\nBose's John Rule emphasizes that it's not just the circuitry doing the work, though. He says, \"Passive noise reduction also plays a role in headphone performance. When you place an earcup over your ear or an earbud in your ear, some noise is physically blocked. The cup or bud design, materials used, clamping force of the headband, shape of the ear tips, and many other factors contribute to a comfortable fit while providing a good seal against incoming noise. When active and passive elements are combined, the result is cancellation of the noise you don\u2019t want to hear, such as a plane engine or annoying vacuum. This lets you hear what you want, whether that\u2019s your music or silence.\"\nWireless vs true wireless: what's the difference?\nWireless earbuds have existed for a while now, basically since Bluetooth was invented. Though battery-powered and not physically connected to your phone, they have a cord connecting both buds \u2013 and sometimes a band around the neck too.\nTrue wireless earbuds have no cord whatsoever. While wireless allows us to wear headphones a few feet away from our music players, True Wireless cuts the cord between the earbuds, giving us true freedom. If you're looking to go full wireless, we also have a round-up of the best true wireless headphones, but you'll find our top picks here, too.\nWireless headphones are traditional over-ear or on-ear headphones without the wire \u2013 the two earcups are connected by a headband. Check out the best wireless headphones for more.\nWhich brand of wireless earbuds is best?\nIn this guide we've included all of the best audio tech and earbuds brands on the market today. But the question of which brand is best depends on what you're looking for.\nSony is certainly one of the best wireless earbuds brands, and one of the best audio brands generally. It consistently brings out great-sounding products and has led the way with fantastic true wireless earbuds year-on-year. The Sony WF-1000XM5 didn't make it into this list for reasons given a little above, but we still gave them a very positive review! You really can't go wrong at any budget with Sony's range right now.\nIf you're looking for a pair of premium wireless earbuds and have a high budget for a new pair, then check out high-end brands like Bose \u2013 though Technics is a great audio name that's currently having a fantastic product run. Otherwise, if you're looking for a budget pair of earbuds, the Nothing Ear (a) are currently our best budget choice. But Earfun and JLab also make some of our favorite cheaper wireless earbuds.\nWhich wireless earbuds are best?\nRight now, we currently rate the Technics EAH-AZ100 as our favorite balancing price, sound quality and features. They're not cheap, but they're worth every penny.\nHowever, if you have more specific priorities, you might want to consider other buds in our list. Like the the Nothing Ear (a) if you're on a budget. Or the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds if you want the best ANC buds you can buy.\nWhat are the best value for money wireless earbuds?\nAll of the options in our best wireless earbuds guide are good value for money. However, if you're looking for a budget pair of buds we've got some of those too.\nThe Nothing Ear (a) are our top budget pick because they're cheap, offer great audio and they're comfortable. Top value all round. If you're looking for super budget, the JLab Go Air Pop are incredibly cheap at under \u00a320/$20. They sound great for the price and are light, small and comfy. If you want a pair of budget buds that also pack in ANC, take a look at the Earfun Air Pro 3, which are discounted at the time of writing to $79 / \u00a379.\nWhich is better: Bose or Beats?\nIn the battle between Bose and Beats, it depends what you're looking for. In our opinion, Bose is the better option for sheer audio performance and noise cancelling tech. The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds can't be beaten in terms of ANC.\nHowever, Beats earbuds offer a great fit and excellent sound. Particularly the Beats Fit Pro, which we highly recommend if you're looking for a pair of earbuds for working out. They're also a little more affordable than Bose options and have a more stylish design.\nWhich wireless earbuds are just as good as Apple AirPods?\nThe most recent AirPods Pro 2 are excellent if you want a comfy fit, quality audio and have an iPhone as there are some feature only iOS users can access. They're even a little cheaper than a lot of the competition, which is not something we get to say about Apple a ton\u2026 However, the Technics EAH-AZ100 have them beaten for cross-platform support and sound quality. In terms of ANC, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds are a little better than AirPods Pro 2.\nWhen it comes to the cheaper AirPods models, we think there are lots of better option, especially for value. The Nothing Ear (a) are the big alternative we'd point you towards if you're looking at non-pro AirPods.\nWhat are the best wireless earbuds for Android?\nOur top three picks in this guide are all a perfect match for Android phones, and cover a broad range of budgets: we think the Technics EAH-AZ100 are the best overall, but at a premium price; the Nothing Ear (a) are an incredible option that's more affordable but still has premium features for a budget option.\nHowever, if you have a Samsung phone in particular, you should strongly consider the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, which have special features that specifically work with Samsung phones, including great spatial audio and higher-quality audio support.\nHow we test the best wireless earbuds\n\u2611\ufe0f More than 2,400 audio reviews\n\u2611\ufe0f 16 years of product testing\n\u2611\ufe0f Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\n\u2611\ufe0f Nearly 200,000 hours testing tech\nWe've tested every pair of wireless earbuds in this guide to ensure they meet some key criteria, all detailed in our full reviews. But to give you an insight into our process, we\u2019ve detailed what we\u2019re looking for below. You can read our full article on how we test earbuds if you want to learn more.\nAudio: We're looking (listening?) for earbuds that sound good first and foremost \u2013 we want to hear clear, rich audio that does justice to every genre. We listen to both high-quality source music, as well as lower-quality streams, as well as movies and videos. Voices should be natural, instruments should stand out from each other, and there should be a good sound balance overall between bass, mid-range and treble.\nSound quality testing: The starting point of our process is that our reviewers use a particular playlist of songs as their first port of call for listening to the sound quality of the earbuds. We'll listen to these songs with active noise cancellation turned both on and off, to see if there are any differences in the detail or balance. The playlist is available for anyone to copy on your streaming service of choice, with notes on elements to listen out for, if you'd like to try it.\nComparison: This isn't the only music our reviewers will listen to, obviously \u2013 but by using these songs as the starting point, we can make specific and direct comparisons between earbuds, while will make it easier for you to follow the subtlety of their differences, we hope. Then our reviewers can use other tracks to explore the individual nuances of each pair of earbuds.\nANC: In terms of active noise cancellation, we want to find buds that work well to drown out ambient noise day-to-day in a variety of environments. We test them in our pretty typical office environment, out walking in city traffic, and on public transport.\nMicrophone testing: We also test the microphones, and to help you choose the right earbuds, we record ourselves reading a particular passage, and embed them here, so you can simply play back the recordings and see what you think. These are recorded indoors and to a basic recording app, for consistency \u2013 we'll also test them out in the wind and with background noise, during cellular calls, as part of our overall judgment.\nFeatures: We also consider battery life, testing claims ourselves to ensure that most of the buds we pick will last long enough to not be annoying. And then we look at extra features, such as sound personalization and other app support \u2013 this can make a big difference to the overall value of two earbuds that are the same price.\nValue and comparison: Of course, all of our testing is then balanced against lots of other factors, not the least of which is price. We know that a pair of cheap earbuds won't sound as good as premium ones \u2013 so we're judging them against competition at the same kind of price, not against something wildly different.\nLatest updates to the best wireless earbuds\nAugust 4, 2025\nSwitched the Nothing Ear (a) to our 'Best budget' option after recent price drops. Added the Cambridge Audio A100 as our 'Best mid-range' pick. Removed the 'Best cheap ANC' entry, because that's now well covered by the Nothing.

We've gathered this roundup of the headphones we're currently watching for the biggest offers - and our price comparison software will bring you all the lowest rates every half an hour.\nWe cover all the best headphones released, including over-ear headphones, noise-canceling headphones, and wireless headphones, so there's plenty on offer. Luckily, you'll find some pretty low-cost headphone deals here, so you won't have to break the bank to find a pair that should last. Prices start at around $20 / \u00a320 on our list this week, and what's more, most of these headphones have been impartially reviewed by us, so you know what you're getting here.\nBest headphone deals\n1. Apple AirPods 4\nApple's latest AirPods at a discounted price\nHeadphone type: In-Ear | Weight: .15 oz | Connectivity: Bluetooth | Bluetooth range: 800ft | Battery life: 6 hours **Battery life (charging case):** 30 hours\nApple's all-new AirPods 4 were released in September of 2024 and are available in two models: one with active noise cancellation, priced at $179 / \u00a3179, and one without, costing $129 / \u00a3129.\nApple says the AirPods 4 are the best-fitting AirPods ever and feature a new refined contour and shorter stem. The AirPods include Apple's H2 chip that supports personalized spatial audio and voice isolation to improve the quality of phone calls in loud conditions. Other features include new controls for playing music and muting calls, a case that delivers 30 hours of battery life, and support for USB-C for wireless charging.\n2. Apple AirPods Pro 2\nApple earbuds with premium sound and noice cancellation\nHeadphone type: In-Ear | Weight: .18 oz | Connectivity: Bluetooth | Bluetooth range: 15m | Battery life: 6 hours **Battery life (charging case):** 30 hours\nIn September 2022, Apple's AirPods Pro 2 were launched with a starting price of $249 / \u00a3249 / AU$399. The earbuds feature enhanced noise cancellation and overall sound quality thanks to Apple's new H2 chip and improved in-ear detection and touch controls for volume adjustment. The 2nd generation AirPods Pro also pack an extended battery life and a redesigned case that provides up to 30 hours of total listening time with Active Noise Cancellation using the MagSafe Charging Case.\nThanks to the release of the AirPods 4, you can find impressive AirPods Pro 2 sales, with record-low prices reaching well below $200 / \u00a3200.\n3. Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)\nApple's cheapest earbuds\nHeadphone type: In-Ear | Weight: .14 oz | Connectivity: Bluetooth | Bluetooth range: 10m | Battery life: 5 hours **Battery life (charging case):** 24 hours\nDon't discount the Apple AirPods; while they may indeed be a pricier option, recent sales have driven prices down to an almost bargain price point, so much in fact, you can often pick them up for as low as $99 / \u00a3110.\nThere\u2019s a lot about the AirPods that we like. They sound great, their battery life and charging speeds run laps around the competition, and it\u2019s hard to overstate just how seamless the pairing process is. If the prices go down even further, as we expect later this year, they could just be a great value pickup - especially for those with an iOS device.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\n4. JBL Tune 510BT\nCheap over-ear headphones\nHeadphone type: Over-Ear | Weight: 5.6 oz | Connectivity: Bluetooth | Battery life: 40 hours\nThe JBL Tune 510BT have over 50,000 positive reviews on Amazon and are one of the best-selling headphones on the site. The over-ear headphones come with JBL's renowned Pure Bass sound to deliver powerful audio and feature Wireless Bluetooth 5.0 Streaming, so you can stream music and podcasts and take calls from your device. You also get an impressive 40 hours of battery life plus a quick five-minute recharge, which gives you two additional hours of listening time.\nThe best part about JBL's headphones is perhaps the price, retailing at just $49.95 / \u00a339.99 and frequently discounted during holiday sales.\n5. Sony WH-1000XM5\nSony's latest over-ear headphones\nHeadphone type: Over-Ear | Weight: 4.5 oz | Connectivity: Wireless | Battery life: 30 hours\nThe Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones follow their predecessor's steps by offering superb sound, active noise cancellation, and an expensive price tag. Sony's headphones retail for $399/\u00a3380/AU$650, which is more than the previous generation, the Sony 1000XM4s, which were priced at $349/\u00a3350/AU$549 at launch.\nSony's WH-1000XM5 offer improved noise cancellation, voice microphones for better video and audio calls, and an impressive 40 hours of battery life. Perhaps the most significant change in the WH-1000XM5 is the new design. Sony has gone with a sleeker and curvier style with slimmer headphones for superior comfort.\n6. Sony WH-1000XM4\nPremium headphones frequently on sale\nHeadphone type: Over-Ear | Weight: 4.5 oz | Connectivity: Wireless | Battery life: 30 hours\nThe Sony WH1000XM4 are ranked in the top spot of TechRadar's best noise-cancelling headphones list, offering industry-leading digital noise cancellation technology. Whether traveling, walking, or in a busy office, these headphones will adapt to the sounds around you and block out background noise accordingly. The Bluetooth headphones also include Touch Sensor controls so you can easily skip tracks, control volume, answer phone calls, and more. The Sony WH1000XM4 provide up to 30 hours of battery life, with quick charging if you need a fast recharge.\nThe premium headphones don't come cheap, retailing for $349 / \u00a3349 / AU$549, but thanks to the release of Sony's WH1000XM5, you'll frequently find deals on the headphones, especially during holiday sales.\n7. Sony WH-CH510\nBudget over-ear headphones\nHeadphone type: Over-Ear | Weight: 4.6 oz | Connectivity: Wireless | Battery life: 35 hours\nThe Sony WH-CH510 is our top pick for the best budget over-ear headphones, offering industry-leading digital noise cancellation technology. Whether you're traveling, walking, or in a busy office, these headphones will adapt to the sounds around you and block out background noise accordingly. The Bluetooth headphones also include Touch Sensor controls so you can easily skip tracks, control volume, answer phone calls, and more. The Sony WH-CH510 provide up to 35 hours of battery life, with quick charging if you need a fast recharge.\n8. JLab Go Air True Wireless Earbuds\nBargain true-wireless earbuds\nHeadphone type:: In-ear | Weight:: 3.2 oz | Frequency response:: 20Hz-20kHz | Drivers: 8mm | Connectivity: Bluetooth | Wireless range: 30ft | Battery life: 5 hours\nNo longer is true-wireless tech a feature reserved for the most premium of buds, thanks to the JLab Go Air - a pair of totally wireless earbuds available for the almost unbelievable price of just $29 / \u00a329.\nSure, these are definitely on the more \"budget\" end of things, and subsequently, you shouldn't expect world-beating audio, amazing build quality, or premium features like active noise cancellation, but for $30 - you're definitely getting a pair of functional buds here.\nAvailable in white, khaki green, black, and navy blue, the JLab Go Air True Wireless Earbuds feature an IPX5 sweatproof rating, 5 hours of battery life, and three different equalizer settings, which you can use to cater to your tracks of choice. Overall, that's not bad in our books and definitely worth considering if you want to get your hands on a pair of truly wireless buds without spending the $99 that the (admittedly much better) Lypertek Tevi go for these days.\n9. JBL Tune 750BTNC\nGreat headphones which are often discounted\nHeadphone type: : Over-ear | Weight:: 7.76 oz | Drivers:: 40mm | Connectivity:: Bluetooth | Battery life:: 22\nWant a pair of extremely solid, Bluetooth headphones that also pack in excellent active noise cancellation for under $100? Check out the JBL Tune 750BTNC.\nWhile the JBL Tune 750BTNC have an official listing price of $129 / \u00a3120, we often see them go for as little as $99 / \u00a389, which makes them one of the best headphone deals around right now. For that price, you're getting a ton of excellent features for the money, including active noise cancellation, great audio, and a pretty damn sturdy pair of headphones for the price.\nThe only downside we've found with these headphones is the lack of the latest Bluetooth support. These are on a slightly older version so don't quite have the wireless range of the newest premium headphones. There's also no waterproofing on these JBL's either, but otherwise, they get a hearty recommendation for us.\n10. Tascam TH-02\nThe cheapest studio-quality over-ears\nHeadphone type:: Over-ear closed back | Weight:: 1.01 lbs | Drivers:: 50mm | Sensitivity:: 98 dB \u00b1 3dB | Connectivity:: Wired (3.5mm)\nIf you're looking for a cheap, no-nonsense set of wired headphones for your work desk or home use, check out the Tascam TH-02. These fully over-ear closed-back headphones aim to provide a detailed, studio-ready audio experience, but most importantly, retail for just $20 / \u00a320 at Amazon currently.\nTascam is a trusted brand that has been around for many years, and the TH-02 is a good choice over the many nameless and unbranded headphones that tend to sit at this price point. You're getting some powerful drivers here, as well as a fairly robust (albeit slightly dated) plastic design that should last for a good time.\nOf course, you probably won't want to be seen out with these giant old-school headphones, but for home use and sitting at the office desk, these headphones will give you plenty of quality and isolation for the price.\n11. AKG K92\nQuality over-ears from an Industry giant\nHeadphone type: Over-Ear | Weight: 1.2 lb | Frequency response: 16Hz-20KHz | Drivers: 40mm | Connectivity: Wired\nWhen it comes to headphones, the general consensus is that you very much get what you pay for. But with AKG's K92, what you're getting is so much more. These headphones offer a level of sound quality that far outstrips their budget price tag. That being said, these are some of the largest cans you might ever find, and therefore might not be the best choice for anyone out there who has a petite noggin. Specs-wise, however, it's all good. The K92's professional 40mm drivers offer an extended 16 - 20,000Hz frequency response with a 113 dB SPL/V sensitivity level. It has a cable length of about 9 feet (3 meters) and weighs around 200 grams.\n12. 1MORE Triple Driver\nGreat value wired earphones that are often on sale\nHeadphone type: In-ear | Weight: 0.6 oz | Frequency response: 20-40kHz | Drivers: 3 proprietary | Connectivity: Wired (3.5mm)\nOne for the audiophiles among you, the 1MORE Triple Driver offers quite simply some of the best audio quality available for under $100, and even better news, they also happen to go on sale frequently for as little as $70 / \u00a380 right now.\nFor that price, you're getting a pair of specially tuned, audio engineer-approved earbuds that have a pretty novel set of (as the name suggests) proprietary drivers to blast out all your favorite tunes in perfect clarity. Subsequently, you can expect great performance from these, and the built and fit isn't too shabby either.\nRemember though, these are fully wired earphones and therefore are subject to tangles, snagging, and general noises unless careful. If you'd prefer wireless, then definitely check out the other great recommendations on our list.\n13. Lypertek Tevi true wireless earbuds\nAstoundingly good value earbuds\nHeadphone type: In-ear | Weight:: 3.53 oz | Frequency response:: 20Hz-20KHz | Drivers:: 6mm | Connectivity: Bluetooth | Battery life: 10 hours\nThe Lypertek Tevi firmly get our nod for the best true wireless earbuds you can buy under $100, and even better news for headphone deals hunters is that they are often discounted to just $89 / \u00a389.\nFor that price, what's on offer here is pretty unbeatable. Not only have they got a great, balanced sound, but the excellent battery life, USB-C charging, and waterproofing just make for an overall awesome value package here.\nWhile their asking price is firmly on the higher end, especially when compared to the cheaper options on our list, these headphones look, feel and sound like a much more premium set in themselves. Subsequently, if you're happy to spend that little extra that week, you definitely won't be disappointed with these great mid-range earbuds from Lypertek.\n14. Amazon Echo Buds\nAlexa powered earbuds\nWeight: 7.6 grams | Battery Life: 5 hours | Connection: Wireless | Bluetooth: 5.0 | Noise Cancellation: Yes | IPX rating: IPX4 (earbuds only)\nThe Amazon Echo Buds were released in 2019 with an affordable starting price of $129.99/\u00a3119.99. Thanks to sale events like Prime Day, we've seen the earbuds drop to as low as $99.99/\u00a389.99.\nThe earbuds include Active Noise Reduction technology that was developed by Bose and feature an advanced microphone that allows you hands-free access to Amazon Alexa. The Alexa-enabled earbuds allow you to skip songs, adjust the volume, ask questions, and more completely hands-free. The sweat-resistant earbuds provide up to five hours of battery life and come in three different sizes for a secure and comfortable fit.\n- If you're interested in wireless headphones see more of the best cheap wireless headphone deals and sales\nMackenzie Frazier is the deals editor in the US for TechRadar at Future plc.

At the 2023 Apple September event, the AirPods Pro 2 received an upgrade and now come with a USB-C charging case, so you don't have to rely on a Lightning cable, plus additional dust resistance and Lossless Audio with Apple Vision Pro.\nThanks to recent holiday sales, we've already seen impressive AirPods Pro deals, with record-low prices reaching $189.99 in the US.\nThe original AirPods Pro were released in 2019 with a starting price of $249 / \u00a3249 / AU$399. While the earbuds are no longer available to purchase from the Apple store, you can sometimes find the original AirPods Pro on sale at third-party retailers.\nThe AirPods Pro were the first AirPods to include active noise-canceling technology to keep outside distractions away from your music, which is excellent for those noisy commutes or keeping your concentration going at work. The AirPods Pro are also water and sweat resistant, making them much better suited to the gym than the standard AirPods, and they come with multiple tips so you can adjust to the best fit for you.\n- Check out AirPods Pro deals direct from Apple\nThe best AirPods Max deals\nApple quietly released the AirPods Max in December of 2020 as Apple's most expensive headphones with a starting price of $549.99 / \u00a3549.\nThe AirPods Max not only stand out because of their price, but the Apple headphones also feature an over-ear design, which is a first from the AirPods line. Apple claims the AirPods Max bring the magic of AirPods to an over-the-ear design, which means you're getting Active Noise Cancellation, powerful H1 Chips, and an enhanced audio experience.\nThe AirPods Max also feature a unique design with a breathable knit mesh headband and a stainless steel frame with memory foam earcups for ultimate comfort. The Apple headphones come in several sleek color choices, such as space gray, silver, sky blue, green, and pink, and provide up to 20 hours of battery life.\n- Check out AirPods Max deals direct from Apple\nHow much are AirPods?\nThe official AirPods' price is $159 in the US and \u00a3159 in the UK and $249 in Australia. So you shouldn't pay any more. Although, we have seen some stores cheekily push the price up when stock thins out. If you're looking for the version with the wireless charging case, then prices shoot up to around $199 in the US and \u00a3199 in the UK.\nExpect the usual outlets to charge closer to the MSRP and, better yet, potentially dip below it around the key shopping seasons. Fingers crossed we don't have to wait long for some proper Apple AirPod sales though!\nAs an alternative, there are lots of wireless earphone and headphone deals in our Beats headphone deals page and other brands are covered in our wireless headphone deals page.\nWhat about the original 2016 Apple AirPods?\nThese models have been discontinued and phased out at most stores now. On the rare occasions that we do spot unused stock units, they're actually the same price as the new and improved 2019 versions.\nShort version: get the 2019 models instead via one of the deals in the comparison chart above. To be sure they are the new ones, look out for H1 chip and hands-free Siri functionality in the description if the title doesn't say something along the lines of '2019' or 'latest/newest version'.\nShould I wait for a cheaper AirPods deal?\nYou might be waiting a while for seriously big discounts. Last year around Black Friday, we were seeing $20 discounts selling out in minutes, and it was one of the most popular deals we highlighted in our extensive roundups of the hottest offers. We saw similar discounts in the UK too - much better than last year's $7 discount but still no flash sales around right now.\nThings have actually been better overall this year though with much better deals available in various regions. We're regularly seeing discounts of $15/\u00a320 outside of peak seasonal discounts, so you should be able to beat the recommended asking price to be honest.\n- Apple fan in general?

Before joining TechRadar, I spent three years at What Hi-Fi? testing everything the world of audio had to offer; before that, I was a professional dancer. My love of music ties it all together.\nAugust 8, 2025\nRefreshed the introduction. Added several new models to our 'More we've tested' section, including the Anker Soundcore Liberty 5 and Final Audio ZE3000 SV.\nThe best budget earbuds you can buy\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe best budget wireless earbuds overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want affordable ANC: These buds deliver some of the best inexpensive noise cancellation we've tested, as well as great sound quality.\n\u2705 You care about style: We got so many compliments when we were trialling these \u2013 it's easy to see why.\n\u274c You want spatial audio: You won't find it here. Look at the Sony WF-C700N or Sony WF-C510 for some support for this.\n\u274c You have very small ears: The design worked well during testing and there are small tips to choose from, but they won't suit the smallest of ears.\nThe Nothing Ear (a) are our favorite affordable earbuds, the pick we think best balance price and performance. Now, officially they cost $99 / \u00a399 / around AU$192, which means they only just squeak into our definition of budget \u2013 but you will find them discounted by up to 25% most of the time, which makes them even better value.\nThey're packed with features, including in-ear detection, multipoint to two devices, an ear tip fit test, and a Find My Earbuds feature. You can also toggle on low lag for gaming, and there's Bluetooth v5.3 here, as well as LDAC support for hi-res audio.\nBoth call quality and active noise cancellation have been massively improved over Nothing buds that came before them. During our testing, we were blown away by the noise-cancelling power on offer here, although did comment that we can see why battery life takes such a hit when it's on \u2013 it's really that good.\nHow do they sound? Great, especially for the price. In our review, we said the sound is fun and energetic. We wrote: \"There's so much here to celebrate sonically that I cannot pick fault.\"\nDesign-wise, expect the cool, transparent and minimal aesthetic Nothing has become known for. And not only do they look fantastic, but the case has been upgraded and is now small and more pocketable and the fit is extremely comfort for all-day listening.\nWe know it's tempting to go for the cheapest buds you can find. But if you want a reliable pair that represent excellent value in terms of design, comfort, sound and features, the Nothing Ear (a) are a very impressive set of buds and a choice that won't disappoint.\nRead our full Nothing Ear (a) review\nThe best super cheap budget wireless earbuds\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want small buds: They're tiny and as light as a feather, which makes these buds compact and comfortable.\n\u2705 You want ANC on a budget: It's rare you'd get such cheap buds with ANC built-in, which works well here.\n\u274c You want excellent sound quality: The audio is great for the price, but it won't impress audiophiles who want best-in-class quality, take a look at the Nothing Ear (a) at #1 instead.\n\u274c You care about style: It's not that these buds look bad, but they're not as stylish as other options in this guide.\nIf you're after budget-friendly earbuds that aren't just cheap but are incredibly cheap yet still deliver solid performance across the board, the JLab Go Pop ANC are our top pick. In our review, we noted that these buds \"have all the hallmarks of an instant budget favorite,\" offering good sound, a comfortable design, essential features, and ANC \u2013 all for an impressive $29.99 / \u00a329.99 / AU$69.99.\nThese earbuds are packed with features you wouldn't typically expect at this price point, the standout being ANC. While the ANC here won't give you the near-silent experience of premium buds, it\u2019s surprisingly effective, reducing a significant amount of external noise. You can even adjust the ANC strength through the JLab app. The app also offers customizable touch controls and multiple EQ options, including presets like Bass Boost, Music, and Movie modes. Battery life is solid, too, with 7 hours of playback on the buds (with ANC on) and about 24 hours in total when including the charging case.\nSound quality is another area where the Go Pop ANC shine. While the soundstage is a bit narrow and there are no 'lossless' codecs for audiophiles, the audio quality still impresses. As we mentioned in our review, \"bass was surprisingly impactful and treble was sharp enough to add some flair to the overall listening experience.\"\nIf there's one downside, it's the design. The JLab Go Pop ANC earbuds have a somewhat plasticky, cheap look. However, considering the price, it's a minor complaint. Despite their modest appearance, they are lightweight, comfortable for extended wear, and boast an IP55 waterproof rating. The compact charging case is also a plus, featuring a foldable USB-C cable built into the base for easy charging on the go.\nThese earbuds won\u2019t compete with top-tier models, but for the price, they offer exceptional value. If you're looking for a budget option that delivers solid sound, useful features, and even ANC for less than the cost of a night out, the JLab Go Pop ANC buds are hard to beat.\nRead our full JLab Go Pop ANC review\nThe best mid-range budget wireless earbuds\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You need solid all-rounder buds for less: Few buds tick all the boxes in terms of comfort, good ANC, solid sound and top battery life for under $100/\u00a3100.\n\u2705 You won\u2019t want to have to charge them all the time:\nThere are several great features here, but practically speaking, battery life is arguably the best.\n\u274c You need ANC that puts you in a cocoon of silence: ANC is good here, but it doesn\u2019t deliver that almost eerie bubble of silence you get from higher end buds.\n\u274c You want class-leading sound: We enjoyed listening to music, but they're not at the top of the pile for neutrality, expanse or dynamic clarity.\nThe EarFun Air Pro 3 buds don't look particularly special, but they're a really great pair of all-rounder earbuds. As well as bringing you an excellent nine hours of battery life (with an additional 36 from the case), there's also multipoint pairing and some next-gen features that make these buds even more special, including support for Bluetooth LE Audio \u2013 and Auracast.\nThe ANC from the EarFun Air Pro 3 aren't on a par with the best noise-cancelling earbuds you can buy, but they cost less than half the price of many of those rivals and the level of noise-nixing is good enough for focusing at work and diminishing most extraneous low-level sounds while travelling.\nAudio-wise, the EarFun Air Pro 3 buds are powerful and punchy from the get-go. During our testing, we listened to Stevie Nicks' Edge of Seventeen and the signature sound was bang on, with big, booming vocals and oodles of energy. Through the lower registers, things can get a little muddied and cluttered, particularly through heavier tracks, but it's a relatively minor issue at this level.\nAt 52g they're lovely and light and although the units do feel a bit plasticky, they're incredibly comfortable.\nThe EarFun Air Pro 3 earbuds deliver a generous dollop of everything most people will need from a pair of true wireless earbuds today, and they do it all for well under $100/\u00a3100.\nRead our full Earfun Air Pro 3 review\nThe best budget open earbuds\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 Sound is your top priority: Most rivals sacrifice sound for an open design, but audio fidelity is top-notch here for the price.\n\u2705 You want a solid fit: The around-ear design means they won't move, no matter whether you're running or just moving around at home.\n\u274c You want the Android app and you're not tech-savvy: You have to sideload the app on Android phones, though you don't need it for basic use \u2013 this isn't a problem on iPhone or a Huawei phone.\n\u274c You want to listen in noisy environments: Open earbuds are designed to let in outside sounds \u2013 great if that's what you want, but they'll be overwhelmed in really loud places.\nOpen earbuds are booming in popularity and the Huawei FreeArc are our top pick if you're looking for a solid, affordable option. Priced at \u00a399.99 (around $130 / AU$200), they\u2019re right at the top end of what we\u2019d consider budget. But they\u2019re still excellent value, especially as they\u2019ll likely be discounted over time.\nMost importantly, they sound fantastic. In fact, we\u2019d even say they\u2019re the best-sounding open earbuds we've tested so far. In our review, we praised their wide soundstage and noted that they don\u2019t sound like open earbuds at all, which is a big compliment. That\u2019s a huge plus considering open designs have typically meant compromising on audio quality.\nDesign-wise, they\u2019re lightweight, comfortable and hook over the top of the ear rather than clipping to the side like some rivals do. The buds support gesture controls and have an IP57 rating, making them a great choice for workouts, too.\nThey\u2019re not perfect. Battery life is decent at seven hours from the buds but the 23 hour total with the case is below average compared to rival buds.\nAndroid users may also find the app setup frustrating, because it requires side-loading the app \u2013 this isn't the case for iPhone or Huawei users. You can use them without the app, though, and if you do, you'll still get clear, open sound without blowing your budget.\nRead our full Huawei FreeArc review\nThe best USB-C earbuds\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You value comfort: They fit well with no messing around and were comfortable enough for all-day listening sessions during our testing.\n\u2705 You'd like a fun look: We love the sleek design of these earbuds, as well as the choice of cool colors.\n\u274c You want them for walking: A lack of volume buttons on the controller and some cable noise don't make them the best option for extensive walking around.\n\u274c Audio is a priority for you: Considering their price, sound here is clear and decent. Although it does lack bass and detail.\nThe Skullcandy Set USB-C earbuds are a cheap and stylish choice for anyone after wired buds with a USB-C connection. They\u2019re simple, but sleeker than most rivals, with a curved design and a choice of four colors. The in-line remote is handy, though basic \u2013 there\u2019s no volume control here. You do get an IPX4 rating, meaning they\u2019ll hold up well in light rain or a bit of sweat.\nWe were especially impressed with the fit of these wired earbuds when we tested them. Thanks to the included small and large ear gels, you get a more personalized feel, and they\u2019re comfy enough to wear for hours. They stay put too, no need to constantly adjust them like other buds we\u2019ve tried.\nThat snug fit helps with noise isolation as well. Don\u2019t expect active noise cancellation levels of silence here, but they do a good job of keeping distractions out so you can focus on your music. One minor downside is you will hear some cable rustling if you\u2019re moving around or brushing the wires.\nSound-wise, they\u2019re good for the price. You won\u2019t get the richness or dynamism of more expensive earbuds, but audio quality holds up well \u2013 even at higher volumes, there\u2019s no tinny distortion. For budget buds, that\u2019s a win. If you\u2019re a fan of wired earbuds and want something reliable without spending much, these are a great choice. They\u2019re also perfect as a back-up pair when your wireless buds are out of juice.\nRead our full Skullcandy Set USB-C review\nThe best 3.5mm wired earbuds\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You like nice things: Sleek, small and made from shiny aluminum, these buds look and feel more premium than they are.\n\u2705 You need a 3.5mm connection: Other wired buds cater to USB-C, like the Skullcandy Set USB-C at #5, but these are our top choice is you need a 3.5mm connection instead.\n\u274c You want really high-end sound: The audio here is solid, reliable and enjoyable, but they're cheap for a reason.\n\u274c You want a bass-heavy listen: Within the soundscape, it's the bass that feels like it's particularly lacking and means they don't hit higher sonic heights.\nThe SoundMagic E11C earbuds might be an older pick, but they\u2019re still our top recommendation if you want wired buds with a 3.5mm headphone jack.\nLike the Skullcandy Set USB-C at #5, they look more premium than their price suggests. With an aluminum build, dark silver finish and silver-plated copper cable designed to enhance audio, the design feels sleek and refined. T\nhe buds themselves are small and come with three sizes of eartips, so most users should get a snug, comfortable fit. We found them comfortable enough for all-day wear with no need to readjust. The inline remote is simple but effective with volume and play/pause buttons that are responsive and easy to use.\nThese buds are ideal for anyone still using devices with a 3.5mm jack \u2013 think older iPhones or certain Android phones, laptops and audio gear. Just make sure your device is compatible before buying.\nSound quality is solid for the price. While you won\u2019t get crystal-clear separation or audiophile-grade detail here, volume levels are strong and the overall sound is punchy enough for casual listening. Some frequencies can feel a little muddied but the decent passive noise isolation helps enhance the experience.\nThe E11Cs remain a great budget option for wired earbud fans. They\u2019re not aiming for perfection but they deliver reliable performance, comfort and surprisingly good sound for the price.\nRead our full SoundMagic E11C review\nThe best budget wireless earbuds for battery life\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You need budget buds with stamina: A 39 hour max is pretty good for $80 earbuds \u2013 and you won\u2019t be using the battery-draining ANC that much, given how we rate the efficacy.\n\u2705 You want something for workouts/outdoors: The IPX5 rating is better than the vast majority of earbuds, and means they'll stand up to sweat or rain.\n\u274c You need 'bubble of silence' noise nixing: Zen Air SXFI do feature active noise cancellation, but the effect is relatively minor.\n\u274c You take a lot of calls with your earbuds in: The mics on these earbuds could be better, making ambient mode a little painful, and they aren\u2019t the best for recording voice notes.\nThe Creative Zen Air SXFI's tempting price tag looks even better when you check out the premium-feel design with plenty of advanced features, including active noise cancellation and Creative\u2019s proprietary \u2018spatial holography\u2019 mode, Super X-Fi. Honestly, the 'extra' perks aren't the best thing about these earbuds \u2013 we didn't rate Creative's proprietary spatial audio tech (called either SXFI or 'Super X-Fi spatial audio' in Creative's marketing), the ANC was resoundingly average and we think you should leave the Ambient mode alone.\nWhat you will get, alongside a supplementary high-end cloth bag to put the case into (unusual!) is an IPX5 rating, meaning they can actually withstand jets of water \u2013 or the sweatiest of spin classes and a rainy 10k run before breakfast.\nWe liked the sound quality a lot, as long as you leave the novel extra sound profiles out of the picture \u2013 and for their $80 / \u00a370 price tag the Creative Zen Air SXFI's 39-hour battery life makes them some of the best stamina-per-pound value earbuds we've tested.\nElsewhere, Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity is a great thing to see on the spec sheet. Basically, these earbuds get the key metrics \u2013 comfort, durability, stamina and sound quality \u2013 just right, so provided you're willing to overlook the more experimental (and not totally successful) implementation of their premium features, they've still got an awful lot going for them.\nRead our full Creative Zen Air SXFI review\nThe best budget wireless neckbuds\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a neckband: If you don't want to go fully wireless, these are a top alternative, keeping each bud anchored without the annoying wire to your source device.\n\u2705 You want cheap gym earbuds: These are some of our top picks for budget workout buds; the neckband keeps them in place, plus there's a splash-proof IPX4 rating.\n\u274c You want truly wireless earbuds: If you want a little case where your two earpieces go to roost, you'll feel short-changed here.\n\u274c You want ANC: Passive noise isolation is good here, but you won't have total immersion.\nThe SoundMagic E11BT buds aren't packed with features (there's no ANC whatsoever), but they remain our top pick for budget buds if you prefer a neckband-style design. They boast good connectivity, control via an inline remote and continuous playback for up to 20 hours, provided you don't max out the volume during your workout.\nLargely speaking, the audio quality provided by the E11BTs is very good indeed, with an impressive amount of oomph and drive for such small earbuds. Vocals are clear and smooth thanks to their custom-tuned drivers and there's good bass depth and clout too.\nOverall, the E11BTs are comfortable to wear thanks to ergonomically-designed eartips and a flat neckband that shouldn\u2019t irritate you while running or working out. With an IPX4 rating, they'll also withstand even super-sweaty training sessions.\nThe SoundMagic E11BTs are an extremely capable pair of wireless in-ear earphones and given their low price they're fantastic value. Aside from an occasionally overstated treble (but we're really nitpicking here) we found it difficult to fault them. This particular model is seeing limited stock in the UK at the moment, so we recommend checking out the 1More Penta Driver P50 wired earbuds as an optional alternative.\nRead our full SoundMAGIC E11BT review\nThe best cheap wireless earbuds without ANC\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You like clear and forward sound: Bass here is lacking a little, but for detailed vocals and treble-first sound, these buds sound excellent.\n\u2705 You want affordable Sony buds: There are other Sony buds that are budget, but these are the cheapest yet still packed with everything that makes the brand great.\n\u274c You need ANC: If you're used to ANC, choosing buds without it might be hard to get used to \u2013 especially if you spend time commuting or in a busy office.\n\u274c You want them for long trips: So, the battery in the buds is great. The charge in the case isn't. They'll last for long trips, but not for days without power.\nMany people look for ANC to block out noise during commutes, busy offices, or flights, but not everyone needs it. Sometimes, it's useful to stay aware of your surroundings, and some find ANC\u2019s silence unsettling. If you don't need noise-cancelling, there are still plenty of earbuds that offer great sound, a comfortable fit, and solid features \u2013 often at a lower price. Our top pick for budget earbuds without ANC is the Sony WF-C510, showing that Sony can excel at budget options just as well as high-end ones. They\u2019re similar to the WF-C700Ns but nearly half the price.\nLet's start with the sound. While you won\u2019t get audiophile-level quality or deep bass, these buds still offer a highly enjoyable listening experience. This is partly due to Sony\u2019s DSEE (Digital Sound Enhancement Engine), which restores the range of compressed audio from streaming services. It gives the WF-C510 an edge over other budget options, as long as you remember to activate it in the app.\nWe praised the design in our review, calling it \"stellar,\" noting: \"the buds stuck in my ears like the Abba songs they played stayed stuck in my head.\" This secure fit is thanks to the \"grippy\" material on the tips and the lightweight build \u2013 just 5g per bud. They stayed put during workouts and cycling, so no worries about them falling out. The case is also compact and lightweight, though it only offers one extra charge, which is disappointing compared to rivals that offer two or three. Still, with 11 hours of battery life on a single charge, the buds are great for long journeys \u2013 just don\u2019t count on the case for extended trips without a power source.\nFeature-wise, you get the basics. There\u2019s no ANC, wear detection, low-latency mode, or 'find my' locators \u2013 features you'd find in pricier models. But overall, the WF-C510 buds offer excellent value, packing many of the things we love about Sony into a budget-friendly package.\nRead our full Sony WF-C510 review\nMeet the team\nTechRadar's audio tech team has had years and years of experience testing the best headphones, hi-fi systems and Bluetooth speakers.

These earbuds all performed well in some respects when we tested them, but just didn't quite make our main guide \u2013 we explain why below.\nAnker Soundcore C40i\nThese clip-on style buds deliver impressive bass considering their design and we do recommend them if you want open earbuds on a budget. But they don't fit as well or sound as good as the Huawei FreeArc in our guide above.\nRead the full Anker Soundcore C40i review\nAnker Soundcore Liberty 5\nThese earbuds were fine during tested. We rated their detailed audio, features and bass. But you can do generally better for the price and ANC wasn't anything special.\nRead the full Anker Soundcore Libery 5 review\nApple AirPods 4\nWe rated the Apple AirPods 4 for their fun, dynamic sound and spatial audio \u2013 the fit is also surprisingly stable even though there are no tips. Although there are better options for your money, if you're a die-hard Apple fan, take a closer look at our review and have at them.\nRead the full Apple AirPods 4 review\nCMF Buds Pro 2\nThese CMF buds are extremely cheap and come in a range of fun colors. But unfortunately that's about all they have going for them. Sound is fine, for the price, but pay more and you'll be much happier overall.\nRead the full CMF Buds Pro 2 review\nEarfun Air 2 NC\nThese Earfun earbuds deliver punchy bass and customizable ANC at a budget price. But they're a little weaker than we'd like on sound, especially when it comes to detail and balance. So while they're a solid choice, they don't beat other options in this guide, especially for audio alone.\nRead the full Earfun Air 2 NC review\nEarfun Air Pro 4\nTake a look at our Earfun Air Pro 4 review for a pair of buds that we thought were good. But we were ultimately let down by a cluttered user experience with an overwhelming number of options.\nRead the full Earfun Air Pro 4 review\nEarfun OpenJump\nA decent pair of open earbuds that are cheap and boast an impressive battery life. But ultimately, plenty of rivals manage to offer an open fit and good audio, whereas these buds fall short in the sound department.\nRead the full Earfun OpenJump review\nEdifier LolliClip\nThese open buds have ANC, which is rare and help them stand out in an increasingly crowded space. You'll also find health tracking features and some seriously solid sound. However, we had to mark them down in our testing as the app isn't quite up to standard.\nRead the full Edifier LolliClip review\nFinal Audio ZE3000 SV\nThe design of these buds is good, they're light, comfortable and compact. We also rated the sound for being balanced and detailed. But ultimately the audio is a little too lacklustre for us to recommend them alongside much stronger rivals.\nRead the full Final Audio ZE3000 SV review\nHappy Plugs Clip\nIt's hard to recommend these open earbuds because although we liked that they were light and super cheap, everything else was lacking, including sound and design. There are plenty of similar clip-on style rivals that offer much better value.\nRead the full Happy Plugs Clip review\nJLab JBuds Open Sport\nCheck out our JLab JBuds Open Sport review for an affordable pair of open earbuds that may suit some people but ultimately didn't fit as securely as we'd hoped and were a little weak when it came to mid-range sound performance.\nRead the full JLab JBuds Open Sport review\nOnePlus Buds 3\nIf you get these OnePlus buds with a OnePlus phone or tablet, you're in luck. They have spatial audio, a lightweight design and solid ANC. But battery life is just average and they're quite bass-heavy. So although they're decent, you'll find better in the guide above.\nRead the full OnePlus Buds 3 review\nOnePlus Buds Pro 3\nWe rated the amazing sound and impressive battery life these buds had to offer in our OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review. But although they're great for those with more money to spend, they're not budget buds and are ultimately too pricey for this guide.\nRead the full OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review\nSony WF-C700N\nThey sat at the top of this guide for a long time and it's easy to see why. Audio is great, they're comfortable and packed with features. They're getting on a little now, which means they're excellent value while they're still around \u2013 and even slightly cheaper than Nothing at time of writing.\nRead the full Sony WF-C700N review\nSony WF-C710N\nThey're right at the top end of budget, so we're not sure they can earn a place in this guide. But they're packed with features and ANC is very impressive indeed, making them excellent value \u2013 especially if you can find them discounted during sale events.\nRead the full Sony WF-C710N review\nXiaomi Buds 5\nTake a look at our Xiaomi Buds 5 review and you'll see that we like that these buds offer good, cheap sound. But there are too many issues here to make this guide, including poor ear grip, a so-so battery life and an app that disappoints.\nRead the full Xiaomi Buds 5 review\nHow to choose the best budget wireless earbuds\nBuying a pair of the best budget earbuds can be a challenge. You might uncover a real gem or land yourself with a pair or buds that barely work, let alone sound good. All of the the affordable earbuds in this list come with our recommendation.\nActive noise cancellation: But often you do get what you pay for in terms of connectivity, build and noise cancellation. In fact, ANC is the first thing to be omitted from the spec sheet in the budget realm. For example, you need to be looking at models such as the EarFun Air Pro 3 and Nothing Ear (a) if you want active noise cancellation in your budget buy. If that's not an essential feature for you, then it's even worth looking at cheaper models in a brand's lineup. For example, the Earfun Air 2 is a more stripped back version of the Air Pro 3 that offers great money for value.\nAudio quality: If you're all about the sound quality, look for earbuds that support Hi-Res Audio such as aptX Adaptive or LDAC, as long as your phone supports them. This doesn't guarantee good sound quality, though \u2013 but if audio is a priority, and it looks like the audio quality is good anyway, this is how to get the best from the earbuds.\nBattery life: Battery life in budget wireless earbuds is getting better all the time, but it still pays to dig into the details. Don\u2019t just glance at the 'total' battery life figure, as this includes the extra charge you get from the case. That\u2019s fine for understanding how often you'll need to charge the case, but the most important thing is to check the battery life of the earbuds themselves, since that's the figure that might leave you sad and tune-less. Pay close attention to the figures with ANC turned on and off; the difference can be dramatic. If you love using ANC, you might be disappointed to find your buds running out of juice much sooner than expected.\nDesign: Before you add the earbuds to your online shopping cart, it's also worth having an idea of what kind of earbuds you need. There are two kinds of wireless earbuds: neckbuds that have a cable connecting each earbud but connect via Bluetooth to your phone, and true wireless earbuds that have no cables at all. The former is a dying breed but still, certain active users and athletes prefer it.\nStability: If you intend to workout with your earbuds, then you'll need buds that will stay put, so look out for interchangeable eartips and fins to hold them in place. Check out our guides for the best running headphones and best workout headphones, or even the best bone conduction headphones for more inspiration.\nUsability: As we mentioned earlier, budget buds usually come with some compromises. If the sound is solid and the fit feels good, you might wonder where the trade-offs are \u2013 and often, it\u2019s in the day-to-day usability. That includes all the little things you might not think about at first, like is there a companion app, and if so, is it actually nice to use? (Some budget buds skip the app entirely.) Do they have on-ear volume control, and do they auto-pause when you take them out? These finer details can make a big difference, so it\u2019s worth checking.\nHow we test the best budget wireless earbuds\n\u2611\ufe0f More than 3,000 headphones reviewed\n\u2611\ufe0f 16 years of product testing\n\u2611\ufe0f Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\n\u2611\ufe0f Nearly 200,000 hours testing tech\nWe're constantly testing the best cheap wireless earbuds to determine which can be included in this list. But to make the cut, we need them to tick a number of boxes. We have a more detailed breakdown of how we test earbuds at TechRadar but we've outlined a brief summary of the methodology below.\nThe biggest consideration we make when determining if a pair of earbuds makes our list is pricing. Being available for under \u00a3100/$100/AU$150 is what we determine to be relatively cheap. This is closely followed by how solid the sound quality is, which features a pair of earbuds offers (such as decent battery life or mic quality) and the level of comfort they deliver .\nWe always test earbuds in a number of different sound environments across a vast selection of musical genres with a wide-range of connectivities (mainly wired and Bluetooth). We listened to podcasts and albums in both quiet rooms and busy aeroplanes, to ensure we knew how they'd handle varying levels of noise too. We also wore them while walking and, often, working out, which meant we could speak to their comfort levels, ANC if available, and how secure they are in your ear.\nWe also put those battery claims to the test, making sure we got a sense of how quickly the juice drains from the buds and the case itself during both extensive listening sessions and shorter ones.\nOf course, these earbuds aren't going to compare with the high-end buds that you'll find our best wireless earbuds guide, which are double \u2013 or even triple \u2013 the price, but our testing is independent, which means we can assure you that you're getting the best sound-per-pound experience.\nLatest updates to the best budget wireless earbuds\nAugust 8, 2025\nRefreshed the introduction.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nSony has taken its smash-hit affordable noise-cancelling earbuds and changed the colorway, companion app, mic array, size, and stamina. You still don't get lossless LDAC or the company's top-tier DSEE upscaler, but you still do get the 360 Reality Audio (if you can find the content these days) and, now, auto-off when you remove a bud. But the real star of the show is noise cancellation: it's outrageously good for the level. Okay, some of the more minor gripes I'd have loved to see fixed haven't been addressed \u2013 and the competition makes it much harder to win convincingly \u2013 but if budget ANC is top of your wish list, then the Sony WF-C710N can make your wish come true.\nPros\n- +\nANC is vastly improved\n- +\nBetter call quality and stamina\n- +\nAuto-off is a welcome addition\nCons\n- -\nStill no LDAC\n- -\nOn-ear controls could be better\n- -\nNew colorway looks a tad cheap\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nSony WF-C710N: Two-minute review\nSony's WF-C710N earbuds find themselves in a similar spot to The White Album in 1968: you want to better the absolute barn-stormer that was Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band a mere year later? Good luck. But of course, the Beatles managed it (was it transcendental meditation, or was it simply a clean mind?). So, has Sony done the same with its update on the WF-C700N? Well actually yes, Dear Prudence, even though Sony admittedly had two years to work on its follow-up.\nThe model the C710N are based on topped our pick of the best noise-cancelling earbuds in the budget space for over a year following their release, until Nothing's (a)-suffixed set of buds came in and did almost everything the Sony buds did just that little bit better \u2013 and looked slightly classier doing it. And although there are improvements here, a few in-app foibles and initial pairing issues left me struggling to find a reason to pick the Sony WF-C710N over the rivals\u2026 until I tested the ANC.\nHere, Sony has truly upped its game. On a packed commuter train, I drifted off into my own happy bubble of music. I genuinely didn't expect the blissfully quiet backdrop they served up. The uptick in ANC efficacy is almost certainly aided by the extra mic in each earpiece, but however Sony achieved it, it's commendable.\nAlso, (because I'm still talking about those mics), call quality is very good for the money here, thanks to Sony's new AI-enhanced voice pickup technology. So, if you regularly take calls on your earbuds, there's an extra value add.\nThe overall sound profile and fit? It's still good despite the size increase \u2013 but it's not better than the outgoing model (Sony has essentially said that little about the driver and acoustic setup changed), so if you've picked up the older set for a discount, you may be tempted to stick with them unless you need that improved ANC.\nIn fact, other than the much-improved noise cancellation, it's a case of incremental upgrades rather than anything headline-grabbing or ground-breaking.\nYes, there's now a 'Find Your Equalizer' tab, but it works by asking you to pick from a selection of pre-made sound profiles rather than dishing out any otoacoustic tests or splodges to denote where your hearing might be lacking, unlike JBL's Personi-Fi or Nothing Ear's hearing tests (although it's true that you have to pay a little more to get those). The two basic 'Which do you prefer?' tests offered by the WF-C710N don't feel quite as comprehensive, detailed, or involved as those rivals.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAlso back for 2025 is Sony's entry-level DSEE upscaler, so Spotify streams will sound better, plus there's that Sony-special 360 Reality Audio support. However, since Tidal parted ways with the format, your only source options for listening to this particular spatial-audio-adjacent offering now are Amazon Music Unlimited and Nugs.net.\nDo I still like the new transparent blue colorway now that I've tested it? Not as much as I'd wanted to. The shiny plastic avidly collects fingerprint smudges, and at the risk of stating the bleedin' obvious (as these cases have almost always been plastic, dear reader), this one feels overly plastic. It's also a little bigger than the older model. That said, Sony's more traditional matte black, off-white and pink colorways are available too.\nFor sound, there's no addition of LDAC, but they're still a solid listen with good volume and energy levels, albeit sacrificing a modicum of dynamic nuance, detail and sonic placement to get there. They're still good for the level, but that's my point, good is simply no longer great in budget 2025 noise-cancelling earbuds.\nTo really hammer it home: in 2023, when the WF-C710N's predecessor made its grand entrance, earbuds bearing these kinds of features had never been seen at that level. But the competition really upped its game in the following 24 months, didn't it? One can even buy inexpensive open earbuds with excellent ANC now (see the Honor Earbuds Open), something unheard of, even considered impossible, until very recently. So, the fact that these Sony earbuds fit well, boast slightly better stamina and offer auto-off isn't quite enough to trounce the competition these days. But the ANC? If you prioritise noise-nixing, that'll make up the difference\u2026\nSony WF-C710N review: Price & release date\n- Released on March 25, 2025\n- Priced $119 / \u00a3100 / AU$189\nYes, Sony has won this territory before (see the April 2023-issue Sony WF-C700N I keep going on about), but that was before the excellent Nothing Ear (a) arrived, a year later in 2024.\nThe fact that Sony released these follow-up earbuds at the same MSRP as their older counterparts is welcome but unsurprising news: we've seen it with everything from AirPods to Bluetooth speakers. Why? Because competition is rife, and once-flagship tech (comprehensive ANC, wearer detection, EQ tweaks, spatial audio tech, customisable on-ear functions, and so on) keeps trickling down to entry-level products.\nIf you've done even a little research into this end of the market, you'll know the current class leader is the Nothing Ear (a) mentioned above, with the insanely cheap $30 / \u00a330 / AU$70 JLab Go Pop ANC or even the $69 / \u00a359 / AU$110 (approx.) Earfun Air 2 NC not far behind.\nSo have the few extra perks offered by the new WF-C710N \u2013 slightly better battery, an auto-off feature, improved call quality, a rudimentary equalizer test and much better noise cancellation \u2013 trounced the Nothings? Depending on your priorities, yes, but it's all about that last point\u2026\nSony WF-C710N review: Specs\nDrivers | 5mm |\nActive noise cancellation | Yes |\nBattery life | 8.5 hrs (NC ON) / Max. 12 hrs (NC OFF); up to 30 hours with the case |\nWeight | 5.2g per bud |\nConnectivity | Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C, Sony 360 Reality Audio, AAC, SBC |\nFrequency range | 20Hz - 20kHz |\nWaterproofing | IPX4 |\nOther features | Sony Sound Connect companion app, ambient sound, wind-reduction mics |\nSony WF-C710N review: Features\n- Dual noise sensor tech (feedback and feedforward mics) for ANC\n- Auto-off is a welcome addition\n- AI-enhanced voice pickup for clearer calls\nLet's start with the above bullet points: call-handling? It was good before, but it's even better now. That's thanks to the implementation of AI-enhanced voice pickup technology, which works a treat even on crowded, windy and rainy London Soho streets during rush hour (trust me on this one).\nWearer detection for auto-off is perhaps the biggest usability perk added this time around, which means music pauses when you remove one bud (or both) and resumes once you put it back in. It doesn't sound like a big deal, but once you're used to it, you'll always be reaching for buds that can do it.\nOK, so Sony's 360 Reality Audio \u2013 24 object-based channels arranged in a 360-degree soundstage (launched back in 2019) \u2013 isn't the big ticket feature it used to be, since few streaming platforms support it and Tidal waved goodbye to its support in July 2024.\nAs noted, Sony's Headphones Connect app is gone, but it's been replaced by the Sony Sound Connect app. Adaptive Sound Control still takes the wheel as far as noise profiles go, optimized according to what you're doing \u2013 yes, they know when you're 'Staying'. And although you can't manually up the noise cancellation levels on the fly (although you can tailor the ambient awareness on a slider from 1-20), if you tap the cog under 'Optimize switching for you', you can tailor each sound profile according to your actions. So if you want Adaptive ANC to kick in on your commute, here's how you do it.\nThat extra mic has paid dividends because the WF-C710N's dual noise sensor tech (feedback and feedforward mics) provides much more robust noise-cancellation performance. On a packed train from London to Dorset, I was struck by how cocooned in my music I felt.\nAny omissions worth mentioning? Although there's multi-point to two devices now (you can toggle it off if you want, but why would you?), there's still no LDAC support. Why mention this? Because the WF-C710N's main rival, the Nothing Ear (a) do boast it.\nAlso, while there's now a 'Find Your Equalizer' tab in the app, it's a little basic compared to any hearing tests to create splodge-type graphs of your hearing profile you might have tried. Essentially, playing your choice of music, there are five profiles to pick from, and then a further four based on your initial pick. It's more than the older model offered, but given the lengths the competition is going to these days (see JBL, Nothing and Denon to name a few, and, of course, the AirPods Pro 2, for a surcharge), it feels a little basic. Yes, the WF-C710N are budget earbuds, but the Nothing Ear with their lengthy hearing tests are roughly the same price now\u2026\n- Features score: 4.5/5\nSony WF-C710N review: Sound quality\n- Agile, fun, energetic listen\n- Minor treble distortion if we're being picky\n- LDAC would be a great addition\nThe sound, as with the older option, is good for the money, but there are incremental gains to be had here. The opening keys in Grian Chatten's All of the People are textured and three-dimensional. There's a human quality to the depressing of each key that most entry-level earbuds cannot convey through the upper midrange.\nOut of the box, the older WF-C700N feel just a little congested and treble-centric in direct comparison \u2013 although it took me a while to set up this comparative test, since once paired to either set of buds, my phone flat-out refused to pair to its siblings, and I'm still unsure why. Anyway, the Beatles' Helter Skelter is a great test of the stereo imaging, and with the C710N, drums sit dutifully in my right ear (until the fill, when the kick drum darts between each ear) as the driving bass sits in my left concha with pinpoint precision.\nIn more layered, complex and groove-heavy tracks (Michael Jackson's Billie Jean, for instance), timing and musicality are bang on across the frequencies. I can detect a minor shortfall in dynamic nuance to get all of that exuberance and volume \u2013 these are loud and proud earbuds, and for the most part, that's great news. There's just a small compromise to be made in the leading edges of lower-mids and bass notes, and just a shred of distortion through the treble, very occasionally.\nLook, I'm nitpicking \u2013 and I'm better able to do it because the noise cancellation here provides such a glorious backdrop. Of course, you can tweak the sonic curve to your liking in the Sound Connect app, but it's important to note that, by default, these are zealous, unafraid earbuds. Compare them to the excellent Technics EAH-AZ100 and you'll get a greater rise and fall through each pensive, building musical passage in Dom Sigales' The Ghost is Me, with exhalations of breath, jagged keys, and waves of strings given an extra ounce of due diligence to be impactful. It's hardly a fair test given the price difference (the EAH-AZ100 retail for $299 / \u00a3259 / AU$479), but it's important to note that the sound is very good here for the money, rather than just very good, period.\n- Sound quality score: 4.5/5\nSony WF-C710N review: Design\n- Bigger but still ergonomic earpieces\n- Case is a little bigger \u2013 and a little cheap?\n- Capacitive touch controls aren't very customisable\nThese are still some of the most comfortable earbuds I've had the pleasure of wearing (besides the aforementioned Technics), even though the buds and case are bigger this time around. While 4.6g to 5.4g may not sound like much of a size increase, it is noticeable. Given that the WF-C700N really were small, that's perhaps not such a bad thing, depending on your ears.\nI still found them easy to fit. That said, the shinier plastic of my glass blue colorway did affect the in-ear security, and the right one fell out on a train. I don't think the fit was an issue, as they feel beautifully weighted and slipped easily into my ears with very little work. I think I just need a more matte, brushed plastic finish \u2013 and that is available.\nOne potential bone of contention is the case: it's bigger \u2013 well, deeper \u2013 than the older WF-C700N case, and it feels a shade off high-end. Do I love the transparent finish? I'm not sure. Seeing the little red, yellow and black cables under the casework is novel, but the overall aesthetic feels a bit (dare I say it) cheap and cheerful, compared to the way Nothing has implemented transparent sections within its earbuds design language.\nAnd the physical button is gone. I liked it, but it seems I'm in the minority. And to be honest, the new touch capacitive sensor is aided by a slightly larger concave top plate to help your finger find it, and it works fairly reliably.\nMy main gripe with this? You can now control volume in addition to playback, sound modes, and access to a virtual assistant, but a little more scope for customisation on what each tap does would be a huge bonus. Right now, the only way to up the volume a little is a quadruple press on the right earbud, and a quadruple press on the left lowers it just a tad. As you can probably imagine, these constant quick presses are hit-and-miss. Ah, well \u2013 and it hurts your tragus and external auditory meatus (the bit right before your ear canal) a little, after a while.\n- Design score: 4/5\nSony WF-C710N review: Value\n- For ANC, there's real value-for-money here\n- 360 Reality Audio isn't the draw it once was \u2013 LDAC would be excellent\n- Nothing's products look and feel more premium\nBefore the Nothing Ear (a) arrived, with their LDAC and great audio quality, I'd have no issue recommending the Sony WF-C710N above all else. But times have changed. Nothing's earbuds are here, and they are impossible to ignore.\nThe design of the Sony WF-C710N is fine rather than groundbreaking, and the feature set is good, although 360 Reality Audio support is not the big draw it once was.\nThen again, here I sit at our shared table-slash-desk, my partner hitting the keys of his MacBook Pro keyboard heavily, because he's under a tight deadline and is stressed. Can I hear him? Not really. And there's the value, folks \u2013 because I've never heard ANC this good for this money\u2026\n- Value score: 4.5/5\nShould I buy the Sony WF-C710N?\nSection | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nFeatures | Auto-off is a lovely addition \u2013 LDAC would be even better | 4.5/5 |\nSound quality | Energetic and zealous, with just a minor shortfall in dynamic nuance | 4.5/5 |\nDesign | A little bigger and a little slippier \u2013 but still good | 4/5 |\nValue | ANC top of your list? Have at 'em | 4.5/5 |\nBuy them if...\nYou need great ANC for budget money\nThese earbuds are some of the most gifted at noise-nixing as I've tried for the money, thanks to that new mic array.\nYou have an Amazon Music Unlimited account\nLink Amazon Music Play Now (after taking photos of your ears, all guided by the app) and you unlock Sony's proprietary 360 Reality Audio for Sony's own spatial audio solution.\nYou like earbuds that pause the music when you take one out\nThe WF-C710N now have wearer detection, and you love to see it.\nDon't buy them if...\nYou prioritize on-ear volume control\nYou can do it, but you still need to press each bud four times quickly to get an incremental increase or decrease. It's a bit much.\nYou're expecting buds the same size as the C700N\nThere's a difference: the C710N are a little bigger and heavier owing to that extra mic and capacitive touch plate\nYou want LDAC\nNo dice, sadly. You'll need to look to Nothing's Ear (a)\nSony WF-C710N review: Also consider\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Sony WF-C710N | Nothing Ear (a) | Sony WF-C510 |\n|---|---|---|---|\nPrice | $119 / \u00a3100 / AU$189 | $99 / \u00a399 / AU$192 | $59.99 / \u00a354.99 / AU$109 |\nDrivers | 5mm dynamic | 11mm custom driver | 6mm dynamic |\nActive noise cancellation | Yes | Yes | No |\nQuoted battery life | 8.5hrs (ANC on) 12hrs (ANC off) plus a total of 30 hours in the case | 5.5hrs (9.5hrs without ANC) 24.5hrs total with case (42.5hrs without ANC) | 11 hours (buds) 11 hours (case) |\nWeight | 5.2g per earpiece | 4.8g per earpiece | 4.6g per earpiece |\nConnectivity | Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C (SBC, AAC) | Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C (LDAC, SBC, AAC) | Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C (SBC, AAC) |\nFrequency range | 20Hz - 20kHz | 20Hz - 20kHz | 20Hz - 20kHz |\nWaterproofing | Yes, IPX4 | Yes, IP54 buds (IPX2 case) | Yes, IPX4 |\nOther features | Sony 360 Reality Audio, basic EQ test, auto-off | 3 mics per bud, Custom EQ, Bass Enhance, Find My Earbuds, fit test | Sound Control for ambient awareness |\nNothing Ear (a)\nThe battery life isn't as good, and the ANC is close but no cigar. But if you need a better level of dust- and waterproofing and want LDAC audio support, these buds are oh-so-stylish and just slightly cheaper than the Sony WF-C710N.\nRead our Nothing Ear (a) review for more information\nSony WF-C510\nWhat if you want quality Sony sound in Sony's smallest earbuds (smaller than the WF-C710N) and even better battery life, because you don't care about ANC? This is the model you need, and you'll save money. But just to be clear, the noise cancellation is the WF-C710N is very good\u2026\nSee our Sony WF-C510 review for the full scoop\nHow I tested the Sony WF-C710N\n- Tested for two weeks, compared against the Sony WF-C700N and Technics EAH-AZ100\n- Used in the office, walking through London, on a train, and at home\n- Listened to Apple Music Lossless tracks, Qobuz, Deezer and Spotify on an iPhone 12 Pro and a MacBook Pro\nAs always when testing portable earbuds, the Sony WF-C710N became my musical companions for two weeks \u2013 after a thorough 48-hour run-in period.\nThey accompanied me to work (walking brusquely to Weymouth station at an ungodly hour; boarding a train to London Waterloo; and at the office \u2013 yes, I really do this) and throughout a long weekend at Seaham, collecting sea glass from the stunning County Durham shoreline.\nTo better test the comfort and battery life claims of the Sony WF-C710N, I wore them throughout the working day on numerous occasions \u2013 and as you can see from the above over-share, my working days can be long.\nTo get through it all, I listened to various playlists (spanning everything from Korn to Dom Sigalas) on Apple Music and Tidal, but also to podcasts and albums on Qobuz and Deezer \u2013 and YouTube tutorials (mostly about making music on Cubase and using Cakewalk, since you ask) from my MacBook Pro.\nI\u2019ve been testing audio products for well over five years now. As a dancer, aerialist and musical theater performer in another life, sound quality, fit and user experience have always taken priority for me personally \u2013 but having heard how wonderful ANC can be when done well, I know what to look for.\n- First reviewed: April 2025\nBecky became Audio Editor at TechRadar in 2024, but joined the team in 2022 as Senior Staff Writer, focusing on all things hi-fi.

The result is an industry leading noise cancellation system with 11 presets and the comfort and support of less high pressure headphones. The audio quality is as one would expect at such a high price tag, but you'll be buying these headphones for their sleek design and unique ability to shut out the rest of the world.

The noise cancellation was second to none until the 700 model was announced and now holds up as a fantastic value for money headset. This is the latest set of Bose headphones to be introduced to the QuietComfort range, which balances high-quality audio and noise cancellation technology with a focus on a relaxing, comfortable listening experience. They're also considerably cheaper than the Bose 700 model, and give the latest headphones from the world's leading audio wizards a run for their money.\nBose SoundLink 2\nDelivers impressive sound at an affordable price\nWeight: 6.9 ounces | Battery life: 8 hours | Connection: Wireless | Bluetooth: 4.0 | Earcup Controls: Yes | Noise Cancellation: No\nIf you want fantastic sounding headphones at a relatively low price, the Bose SoundLink 2 model is for you. The around the ear headphones deliver a powerful, crisp sound with light noise cancellation that helps block out noisy environments. The Bose earphones also include an advanced microphone system with controls on the earcup that allow you to take and end calls without touching your device. The SoundLink headphones only provide up to 15 hours playtime but that's the trade-off you get when purchasing an older model for a substantially cheaper price.\nBose QuietComfort 25\nHeadphones fit for a king and an excellent value for all\nWeight: 6.9 ounces | Battery Life: 32.8 hours | Connection: Wired | Inline Controls: Yes | Noise Cancellation: Yes\nWith the Bose QuietComfort 25 range, you'll be treated to a deluxe set of headphones that delivers an unparalleled audio experience that's well worth the price of admission.

You might have to check further afield for available units or resign yourself to a different model.\nBose SoundSport Wireless Headphones\nBig sound and simple setup\nWeight: 0.63 ounces | Battery life: 6 hours | Connection: Wireless | Bluetooth: 4.2 | Inline Controls: Yes | Noise Cancellation: No\nIf you need your power song to give even more umph, then the Bose SoundSport might give you exactly that extra push you\u2019re looking for. With the unmistakable sound signature of the US audio heavyweight, these lightweight wireless earbuds feature a comfortable and secure fit thanks to the StayHear+ tips.\nFor runners with NFC-enabled smartphones and music players, the SoundSport buds can be paired in the blink of an eye. For an extra $50 you can pick up the Pulse edition which features a built-in heart rate monitor. Depending on your training method, this could be a worthwhile investment as we've found their heart rate monitor to generally be fairly precise.\nBose SoundSport Free Wireless Earbuds\nWireless earbuds built for quiet environments\nWeight: 2.8 ounces | Battery Life: 5 hours | Connection: Wireless | Bluetooth: Yes | Inline Controls: Yes | Noise Cancellation: No\nThe Bose SoundSport Free are an excellent sounding pair of wireless headphones with an ultra-reliable connection. They can easily withstand the abuses of working out, however their poor fit and open design may turn casual listeners away.\nBose have a foothold on leading audio products, but that's not to say their current lineup will suit everyone's interests.

      "text": "The best earbuds for every budget, all TechRadar tested and recommended\nThe best earbuds from Apple, Sony, Technics and more all rigorously tested\nSince becoming a full-time audio writer in 2019, I\u2019ve personally reviewed more than 160 audio products \u2013 but TechRadar\u2019s legacy stretches much further back. Our team has been testing earbuds since 2006, and we\u2019ve reviewed more than 300 pairs to date. Only the top performers make it onto this list, each one vetted through our detailed in-house earbuds testing process.\nAs we move through 2025, the majority of listeners are choosing the best wireless earbuds thanks to improved Bluetooth codecs, longer-lasting batteries, and sleeker, more comfortable designs. While this guide spotlights the highest-rated wireless options, we\u2019ve also included a few standout wired models for those who value affordability or hi-res audio. Every pair here has been tested thoroughly by our experts for audio performance, noise cancellation, mic clarity, and battery life, so you know you\u2019re getting quality.\nOur current top pick is the Technics EAH-AZ100, offering crystal-clear call performance, immersive sound, and rare triple-device multipoint support. For under $100/\u00a3100, the Nothing Ear (a) stands out for its unbeatable balance of quality and price, while the Cambridge Audio Melomania A100 recently entered this list as our top mid-range pick with energetic sound, great specs and solid ANC.\nIf you're shopping on a tighter budget, head to our best budget wireless earbuds guide or take a look at our full roundup of the best wired earbuds.\n\u2b63 Read more\nWhy you can trust TechRadar's choices\nWe\u2019ve tested all of the earbuds in this guide ourselves, and our audio review team is led by me, Becky Scarrott, TechRadar's Audio Editor. I work with our Managing Editor for Entertainment, Matt Bolton, to craft our buying guides, and we have decades of combined experience in the audio tech industry,\nI've reviewed over 150 audio products since becoming a tech journalist, ranging from super-budget earbuds to high-end Hi-Res Audio music players. Before joining TechRadar, I spent three years at What Hi-Fi? testing everything the world of audio had to offer; before that, I was a professional dancer. My love of music ties it all together.\nWe worked with our expert reviewers on a process that combines objective and comparative testing \u2013 including ANC performance, clarity, and battery longevity \u2013 with the all-important subjective listening experience, because you can't judge how earbuds truly sound or feel based on numbers alone.\nWe evaluate these earbuds not just on audio quality, but also on comfort, useful features and connectivity, and overall value for money. We know your priorities may be slightly different to ours, so we try to include as much useful information as we can about where each pair of buds excels or has issues, so you can make up your own mind. Of course, our individual reviews have far more information in them.\nEvery pair of earbuds here was tested in-depth by an experienced reviewer, and we regularly scrutinize this list to make sure we think it represents the best options currently available, even if prices have changed over time.\n8 August 2025\nRefreshed the introduction. Switched the original Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds for the newer Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen) as our 'Best for ANC' pick. Added several new entries to our 'Other earbuds we've tested' section. Checked the whole guide for older products and made sure everything is up to date.\nThe quick list\nWant to cut straight to the best earbuds around? You'll find a roundup of our top choices here. You can jump to a more in-depth write-up for each product, and see the latest deals on them.\nBest overall\nThe best earbuds overall\nDelivering detailed sound with triple-point connectivity and now an even smaller earpiece, Technics' follow up flagship earbuds somehow manage to better their superb initial effort\nBest budget\nThe best budget wireless earbuds\nFor a very affordable price, you get energetic and rich sound quality, the best active noise cancellation we've heard for now well under $100/\u00a3100, great features, and a cool design.\nBest mid-range\nThe best mid-range earbuds\nA solid pair of sleek buds that combine highly enjoyable audio, great specs and effective ANC all for a surprisingly low price \u2013 you'll find exceptional sound-per-pound value here.\nBest for ANC\nThe best earbuds for noise cancellation\nBose has always done active noise cancellation very well, and the newest version of these buds are as good as you can get. They also boast device-agnostic head-tracked immersive audio and lossless support.\nBest for Apple\nSuper-smart earbuds for iPhone owners\nWith fantastic noise cancellation, high-quality audio, an unlosable case and tons more Apple-specific features, these buds offer an unmatched experience if you're all-in on Apple.\nBest for Samsung\nThe best earbuds for Samsung owners\nA top choice for those with a new-ish Samsung Galay phone. These buds sound phenomenal, have great ANC, and deliver spatial audio. Don't expect the AI features to wow, though.\nLoad the next products\u2026\nBest for battery\nThe best for battery life\nUp to 12 hours from just the buds or up to 48 hours (yes, two whole days!) in total is some serious stamina.

We've tested each one extensively, so you can be sure that our recommendations can be trusted.\nThe best earbuds overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You need the best sound around: Like their older siblings, there\u2019s nothing artificial about the way the Technics EAH-AZ100 sound; they offer a convincingly detailed and dynamic listen whatever music we feed them.\n\u2705 You want to switch between devices: Triple-point connectivity is a world-first in a product like this, and it\u2019s brilliantly convenient\n\u274c You need earbuds that last long into the night: Even at its best, the battery life available here is nothing special, though it's not bad.\n\u274c You need the ultimate in ANC: There are many less-capable noise-cancelling earbuds, but if silence is imperative look to the Bose buds at #4 on this list.\nThe 2025-issue Technics EAH-AZ100 buds feel premium (because they are), are packed with features, offer triple-point connectivity, a lovely small earpiece and a sound that really needs to be heard to be believed in a wireless design.\nIn pretty much every aspect we tested, the Technics EAH-AZ100 made a rock-solid case for themselves, solidifying Technics' spot at the top of the wireless earbuds tree. They look excellent, their control options work flawlessly, comfort is impressive, and they sound engaging, exciting and thoroughly musical. From their thorough specification (which covers everything from adaptive ANC to Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity with LDAC compatibility) to a design that's smaller, lighter and yet somehow no less premium in look and feel to their slightly bigger EAH-AZ80 siblings, the Technics EAH-AZ100 are ready to do battle \u2013 and for us, they win out in almost every respect.\nUnless you prefer stellar battery life or bubble-of-silence noise-cancellation over top-tier sound quality, the EAH-AZ100 are the real deal. One other thing of note while we're on the topic of noise cancelling: we'd advise keeping it switched on to get the best quality audio (and here we assure you, you won't be disappointed). Switch ANC off and the punchy, beautifully-handled low frequencies somehow lose a modicum of bite and substance somehow, which is why they didn't achieve the full five stars despite their considerable sonic talents, comfort and features.\nRead our full Technics EAH-AZ100 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nSound quality | Balanced, vibrant and detailed, but low frequencies do lose some substance with ANC off. | 4.5/5 |\nFit & comfort | Small, light and five ear tips ensure a perfect fit, you'll also find responsive voice and touch controls. | 5/5 |\nValue | Premium buds through and through with tactile materials, let down only with ANC turned off, which isn't a deal-breaker. | 4.5/5 |\nThe best budget earbuds\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want strong noise cancellation: At this price, this is the best noise-blocking power we've heard.\n\u2705 You're serious about sound: These are a fun and responsive set of buds, with wireless hi-res support via LDAC as a bonus.\n\u274c You really want spatial audio: It's not here, but the similarly priced Sony WF-C700N will give it to you.\n\u274c You need a big battery life: The 5.5-hours life with ANC is not very impressive \u2013 the Sony earbuds mentioned above offer 7.5 hours.\nThe Nothing Ear (a) rocketed the company from being an audio also-ran to 'these are the best value buds you can get for the price' \u2013 and that goes double following reductions in price. As an added bonus, they're available in black, white or a fun yellow color too.\nThey were our top mid-range pick here for a while, but they've fallen in price over time, which means you can now find them for around $80/\u00a380 and sometimes even less. That puts them in the budget category in our books, and they're a fantastic affordable option for anyone who wants great specs, sound and ANC.\nWe said in our review that \"for the money, Nothing has tweaked its recipe to near perfection here\" \u2013 the sound is as detailed and agile as you could want from earbuds at this price, and is great fun to listen to.\nThat goes for features, too \u2013 the noise cancellation is as good as we've tested for the price, you get smart features such as wear detection to auto-pause them when you take them out, there's multi-point pairing for instant switching between devices, there's a Find My mode, there's LDAC hi-res support\u2026 the only thing missing is spatial audio, and that's not standard on affordable buds.\nThe 5.5-hour battery life is the only element that's below average, but we can totally live with that \u2013 though if you want longer, look at the Sony WF-C710N.\nRead our full Nothing Ear (a) review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nSound quality | As meaty, fun, zealous and accurate as this money buys \u2013 even then they're excellent value. | 4/5 |\nFit & comfort | Extremely comfortable to wear in a small and pocketable design. They're also very fun and stylish to look at. | 5/5 |\nValue | Solid sound-per-pound value here, especially considering you can now find them much cheaper than they were at launch. | 5/5 |\nThe best mid-range earbuds\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You use a high-quality audio source: With top-tier codec support and superb sound, the A100 will make your music sound excellent.\n\u2705 You like a clean look: The slim, pocket-friendly case here won\u2019t bulk out your clothes \u2013 sleek earbuds for a sleek outfit.\n\u274c You want all the extras: If you're after heart-rate monitoring or spatial audio, other earbuds offer more bells and whistles.\n\u274c You love bold colors: If black and white don\u2019t excite you, you\u2019ll find more vibrant options elsewhere at a similar price.\nIf you want energetic and enjoyable audio without spending a fortune, the Cambridge Audio Melomania A100 earbuds are well worth your time. They offer a rare mix of premium features, long battery life and clear, detailed sound, all at a mid-range price that feels like a steal.\nThe Cambridge Audio Melomania A100 buds deliver impressive clarity and energy across the board, with support for high-end codecs, like LDAC and aptX Lossless. They\u2019re tuned with real balance, avoiding the bloated bass you often get at this level. While the low-end can occasionally feel slightly separate from the mids, the overall tuning is lively and musical, with sparkling highs and an open, expressive midrange.\nANC is surprisingly capable too \u2013 not quite Bose-level, but excellent for the price, and it doesn\u2019t interfere with the sound quality either. Battery life is another win here, offering up to 11 hours per charge with ANC off (a more-standard 6.5 hours with it on) and up to 39 hours total with the case. Fast charging via USB-C gives you over three hours of playback from a 10-minute top-up too, which is handy if you're always on the move.\nDesign-wise, the A100 buds have the stem-style shape popularized by Apple, but keep things clean and compact. They\u2019re light, comfortable and secure in the ear, with IPX5 water resistance for workouts and rain showers. The slim charging case is easy to slip into a pocket, though the buds can be slightly fiddly to remove from it. Touch controls are responsive, and Cambridge\u2019s Melomania app adds lots of personalization \u2013 including custom EQ presets and ANC levels. One standout detail is the option to have voice feedback delivered by the actor Matt Berry. It\u2019s niche, sure, but very fun if you\u2019re a fan.\nIf you want smart, great-sounding earbuds with standout value, the Melomania A100 are some of the best around at this mid-range price. They\u2019re not feature-stuffed like some fitness-focused rivals, and you won\u2019t get flashy color options, but when it comes to pure audio quality and thoughtful design, they punch well above their price tag.\nRead our full Cambridge Audio Melomania A100 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nSound quality | Expect stunning clarity for the money here \u2013 easily the best at the level by some degree, with support for high-end codecs, too. | 4.5/5 |\nFit & comfort | Solid, ergonomic, thoughtfully made with a selection of ear tips for a reliable fit and a choice of black or white designs. | 5/5 |\nValue | The best sound-per-pound wireless design on the market at this mid-range price. | 5/5 |\nThe best earbuds for noise cancellation\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want best-in-class ANC: They deliver the most impressive bubble-of-silence noise cancellation we\u2019ve heard in earbuds \u2013 even better than the previous model.\n\u2705 You enjoy head-tracked, immersive audio: Choose between fixed or moving spatial sound, paired with your preferred ANC level, for a truly tailored listening experience.\n\u274c You already own the Ultras: If wireless charging, a new color, and a slight ANC upgrade don\u2019t excite you then you can skip this refresh.\n\u274c You need long battery life: Battery performance is fine, but rivals like the Technics EAH-AZ100 at the top of this list last significantly longer.\nThe Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) are our pick for the best noise-cancelling earbuds in this guide, and for good reason. They take the place of the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds that came before them and although they don't add enough to justify an upgrade if you do already have the originals, for everyone else the second gen version is a much better proposition.\nSo let's start with the ANC, because these buds are great in other ways, but it's the bubble-of-silence ANC that sets them apart from the rest. It really is best-in-class and rivals might come close, but can't beat them. There are also different ANC 'modes' to choose from too. There's the same level of battery life here that there was with the originals, which is 6 hours from the buds and 24 hours from the case. However, Bose adds wireless charging this time, as well as a new deep plum colorway.\nThese buds deliver fantastic audio. In our review, we said they're particularly suited to music lovers who want zealous audio quality as it's powerful and booming. There are also excellent mics for call handling. As well as the ANC, another top selling point is the immersive, head-tracked audio. You get to choose whether you want your own personal surround-sound performance fixed or moving, and in conjunction with whatever level of ANC you want. They do miss a few features though, including LDAC support.\nDesign-wise, they're very similar-looking to the older model. One key difference is an 'embedded ear wax guard', which prevents any of the stuff produced naturally by our ears finding its way beyond the casework and into the driver housings. During testing, we didn't have an issue with fit and comfort. They were stable and a fit test ensures you get the best fit and seal so ANC performs at its best. Then again, the earpieces are still on the larger side and they are rather conspicuous when worn.\nThey're certainly not cheap, but then we'd never expect a bargain from Bose, especially with noise-nixing this good. Having said that, they might be expensive but they are excellent value if ANC is your top priority. They genuinely cannot be beaten.\nRead our full Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nSound quality | Immersive audio is wildly fun and engaging but even with all profiles off, the sound is zealous and powerful. | 5/5 |\nFit & comfort | Maybe a little bulky for some still, but there's a good fit test and we found them to be secure and comfortable during testing. | 4.5/5 |\nValue | For ANC, they're excellent value as it's best-in-class here. But they're not exactly cheap. | 4.5/5 |\nThe best earbuds for Apple fans\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want great sound: These sound superb and shut out the real world so well \u2013 and the spatial audio is best-in-class too.\n\u2705 You've got all manner of Apple things: If you've got an iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac and so on, then you'll really get the benefit from the seamless switching.\n\u274c You want big battery life: There's nothing wrong with the battery life here, but it's very much average in the buds \u2013 though the amount from the case is good.\n\u274c You don't have an iPhone: Android users won't get anywhere near the full experience, because a lot of setup and control options are done in iOS' Settings app.\nThe Apple AirPods Pro 2 are excellent earbuds that have a strong claim to be the best option for Apple lovers. One of the top features here is the active noise cancellation, which competes with the Bose option above for effectiveness at blocking out almost all external noises (though we rate the Bose slightly higher). The Adaptive Transparency Mode is also a nice trick, adjusting its blocking of outside sounds on the fly. In terms of battery, you get six hours with ANC on and 30 hours with the case too \u2013 and that case is IPX4 water resistant and has a speaker and wireless tracking chip, so if you lose it your phone can literally point you towards it, or it can be found by the 'Find My' network.\nAudio performance is great, and it's vastly improved over the original AirPods Pro. There\u2019s rich sound across genres, and a wide and expansive soundstage, bookended by deep-yet-controlled bass and clear, elevated treble. There's lots of detail, and it's energetic too \u2013 if we were to criticize it, we might say it's a little too forward compared to the more natural and neutral sound of the Technics at the top of this list. Spatial audio is a very impressive trick of these buds too, especially with movies \u2013 it really feels like you're sitting in a home theater rather than having sound pumped directly into your years.\nThe crucial part for why you'd choose these over other options, though, is the extra features they include for those with lots of Apple gear. On top of the Find My support, they switch between your Apple devices seamlessly, they can share audio with other AirPods or Beats headphones, they offer personalized audio tweaks, and even optimized battery charging to help make sure they last longer. But to access all of this, you must use them with iPhone. With anything else, you're looking at basic 'they play music and you can switch between noise cancellation and Transparency' functionality.\nThey're excellent all-rounder buds, and during sales events are regularly available for a little less than the premium competition \u2013 who would think Apple would be the more budget option, eh?\nRead our full Apple AirPods Pro 2 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nSound quality | Awesome sound quality here, if a little safe. But ANC is top notch and Spatial Audio works well. | 5/5 |\nFit & comfort | A functional, easy-to-use shape. They handily come with extra ear tips, which makes them a solid choice for smaller ears. | 5/5 |\nValue | They're regularly available with huge discounts, and have so many features it's amazing \u2013 the only problem is that the features only work with Apple devices. | 4.5/5 |\nThe best earbuds for Samsung phone users\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You have a newer Samsung phone: To access all of the best features, you'll need a new-ish Galaxy device.\n\u2705 You want great, immersive sound: Audio is excellent here, as is ANC and spatial audio. You can really cocoon yourself in sound.\n\u274c You want the best value: These buds aren't cheap, and many of their features are only good if you have a Samsung phone as well. The Nothing Ear (a) are most of the way there for cheaper and across platform.\n\u274c You tend to need to replace ear tips: If you like to tinker with the fit of your buds, they may not be the safest option \u2013 they're fiddly and delicate.\nThe Samsung Buds 3 Pro are our top pick if you have a Samsung phone, especially a more recent Galaxy device. The best thing about these Samsung buds is they sound stunning. Our reviewer wrote: \u201cFrankly, these earbuds sound fantastic, with some of the best sound in any earbuds I\u2019ve tested.\u201d We explained in our review that you can expect both \u201cmeaty bass\u201d and \u201cdefined treble\u201d. Which means whatever genre of music you prefer, you should get a great audio experience here. You\u2019ll notice the sound is incredibly immersive and that\u2019s because the active noise cancellation is top notch, too, we called it \u201cheavy duty and impressive\u201d in our review. Most ambient noises, even the louder ones, are nixed thanks to the ANC tech onboard.\nWith ANC on, expect six hours of battery in the buds themselves and 30 hours from the case. This is decent compared to rivals \u2013 although not at all spectacular \u2013 and it\u2019s a welcome improvement over the Samsung Buds 2 Pro. Samsung has also added a bunch of new features into these buds, including some of the brand\u2019s AI features. But there\u2019s a catch: you\u2019ll need one of Samsung\u2019s newer Galaxy devices to \u201cunlock\u201d many of these features. This includes the brand\u2019s AI features, like the language interpreter, improved codec support, the voice restorer and smart dynamic ANC. We\u2019d expect some of these features to only be available on the Galaxy, but it\u2019s a shame ANC is limited. This means these buds only really make sense for Galaxy owners.\nDesign-wise, the Samsung Buds 3 Pro look very AirPods-like. That\u2019s pretty common across all true wireless earbuds these days, but with the tip, small body and stems that point downwards, we wouldn\u2019t blame you for mistaking them for Apple\u2019s buds at first glance. Happily, they\u2019re comfortable to wear for long periods and light too, so they\u2019re unlikely to feel heavy, even after listening for hours. One design drawback is that the tips are really difficult to remove. You\u2019re likely to get there eventually, but we\u2019ve heard reports of people tearing the tips in an effort to switch them out.\nThe downside of the Samsung Buds 3 Pro is that they're premium priced in combination with having many features limited to Samsung phones. Now, considering how good the audio is, they can still be good value \u2013 but those on other platforms would be better off with Bose's buds, or saving and going for the Nothing Ear (a).\nRead our full Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nSound quality | Sound here is excellent with a high max volume and useful EQ just adding to the magic. | 4.5/5 |\nFit & comfort | A design that's very similar to Apple. Comfortable, but really tricky to replace the ear tips. | 4/5 |\nValue | Not the best value for money here. Although they do make a lot of sense if you have a newer Samsung phone and want immersive audio. | 3.5/5 |\nThe best for battery\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You take long road trips: The class-leading maximum battery life of 48 hours is akin to two whole days of playback. During testing, these claims proved genuine too (and the case doesn't drain it!)\n\u2705 You like to wear your heart on your sleeve: You can upload a photo of your beloved right there on the case \u2013 and when you open the box, it flips the other way up so everyone will still see it properly too.\n\u274c You want top-tier spatial audio: There are three immersive profiles here (movies, music and gaming), but, sadly, each one is a shade off a fully immersive, Dolby Atmos-type presentation\n\u274c You desire comprehensive on-ear functionality: Here, you have to select two out of three options for on-ear controls \u2013 volume, playback and ANC. You can't have all three.\nHere's a feature that no other option within this list offers: a color touchscreen screen on the case. It's a lot of fun \u2013 you can select a lock-screen wallpaper from any of the photos on your smartphone, and the image even flips so it stays the right way up when you snap open the case \u2013 but that isn't why the JBL Live Beam 3 are in this roundup.\nNo, the real star here, aside from the vastly improved audio quality over the older and slightly disappointing JBL Tour Pro 2, is the stamina. The battery life is nothing short of excellent at up to 12 hours from the earbuds alone, minus noise cancellation, or 10 hours with it engaged (and nearer nine with adaptive ANC on). On that note, we've recently reviewed the newer JBL Tour Pro 3, but we think the upgrades don't warrant the price hike, which is why the Live Beam 3 is still our pick for battery.\nThe case also delivers three further charges \u2013 we've tested it and the screen doesn't drain it \u2013 taking your total audio playback time up to a class-leading 48 hours. To put that into perspective, Apple's priciest Pro-suffixed AirPods offer 5.5 hours with its top-tier Spatial Audio deployed, or a maximum of 30 hours including the case. Big difference in those figures, no?\nThe JBL Live Beam 3 also boast great value when it comes to the feature set, including a few novel bits and pieces you don't find elsewhere \u2013 including \"Personi-Fi\", which is basically hearing test of each ear to better tailor the sound to your liking.\nOK, the spatial audio profiles aren't going to knock your socks off. JBL has offered a total of three immersive soundscapes for music, movies and games, but if you're imagining sonic articles darting past you in a three-dimensional space you'll be disappointed. Also the ANC is good rather than excellent and the on-ear controls work well but involve a compromise. Look past these minor snafus and you'll find the fit is great, the battery is seemingly never-ending and, honestly, the sound is refreshingly good for bass and detail. View the screen as a lovely extra for the money and you won't go far wrong.\nRead our full JBL Live Beam 3 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nSound quality | Expect big, exuberant sound that also boasts a lot of detail. | 4.5/5 |\nFit & comfort | They're comfortable to wear \u2013 though some may find they do fit far into your ear. | 4/5 |\nValue | The features and audio here are good for the price, but that excellent battery life makes them even more worth it. | 5/5 |\nThe best earbuds for supreme sound\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 Audio quality is important to you: Wonderful sound with great noise cancellation; if you want one of the best listening experiences from a pair of buds, you'll find it here.\n\u2705 You want good travel buds: You can connect the case to any wired source, including in-flight movie systems, and it beams the sound to the buds. Convenient!\n\u274c You'd like to try spatial audio: The sound here is fantastic, but there's no spatial audio. If you've been keen to try it, look elsewhere.\n\u274c You want lots of on-ear controls: You'll have to decide if you want on-ear volume control or access to ANC options, not both.\nLooking for the closest you'll get to sonic excellence in a pair of true wireless earbuds with the key mod cons? Meet the exceptionally accomplished Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 buds. Let's begin with the sound, which is outstanding. In every conceivable way, including musicality, balance and dynamic nuance, you're getting best-in-class audio. As you'd expect, higher quality streams from the likes of Qobuz and Apple Music sounded exceptional, but we rate these B&W buds for making the most of every music source they can get. In our review, we wrote: \"everything was served up with a flourish\" whether that was high-res audio files or Spotify tracks.\nNoise cancellation is at the same impeccably high standard. In our review, we wrote: \"That cocooned feeling of leaving the outside world behind kicked straight in but without any sense of wind-tunnel nausea or my eardrums being unceremoniously sucked into a vacuum.\" This is thanks to B&W's accomplished audio tech, as well as an incredibly snug and comfortable fit, creating the perfect seal for the ANC to work its magic.\nAnother nice added feature is that the charging case can double as a wireless audio re-transmitter in aptX Adaptive transmission (up to 24-bit/96kHz quality). What this means is you can plug it into a non-Bluetooth source (most usefully an in-flight entertainment system) and the audio will be transmitted to the buds. This makes them an excellent choice for long flights.\nThe buds are available in several color options, all with a premium matte plastic finish that we said in our review \"seems to murmur 'I'm expensive' when you pluck them from their small, pebble-shaped case.\" As well as looking nice, they're among the most comfortable buds we've ever tested. This is likely down to B&W putting in considerable efforts to redesign the Pi7 buds that came before them and the result is buds that have very well distributed weight and require zero twisting or adjusting \u2013 this is extremely rare, even with the best buds we've trialled.\nThese buds are incredibly close to perfect. Battery life is a little average at 6.5 hours from the buds and a further 13.5 hours from the case, but it's a worthy sacrifice for everything else you get here. Which is excellent, high-quality audio in a comfortable and premium build. If audio quality is your top priority, these are the buds for you.\nRead our full Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nSound quality | Genuinely some of the best sound we've ever heard from wireless buds \u2013 impossible to beat. | 5/5 |\nFit & comfort | A very comfortable fit that didn't require any twisting or faffing, at least in our experience. | 5/5 |\nValue | You don't get all of the bells and whistles, like hearing tests, but if sound is your priority, which it should be, the value here is great. | 4.5/5 |\nThe best open earbuds\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You don't want to be cut off from the outside world: Open earbuds don't isolate you from sounds around you, so they keep you more aware while delivering the music.\n\u2705 You want rich sound quality too: The reason we like these open earbuds in particular is how deep and energetic the sound is \u2013 you don't feel like the open design is holding them back for audio quality.\n\u274c You're on Android and aren't tech savvy: You have to sideload the app on most Android phones, which is a bit of a pain. No problem on iPhone or Huawei phones, though (and you can use them without the app).\n\u274c You listen in loud environments: With no ANC and no passive sound isolation, their flip side of the coin to their awareness is that they can't be overwhelmed by outside sounds.\nOpen earbuds have become very popular recently, especially if you want to stay aware of your surroundings while you're working out or commuting. But in a fast-growing market packed with compromises, the Huawei FreeArc do manage to stand out and they\u2019re the best-sounding open earbuds we\u2019ve tested, which is no small achievement considering how tricky it is to deliver rich, dynamic audio without the in-ear seal you\u2019ll find from most other buds in this guide.\nThe soundstage on these is surprisingly wide for open buds with depth and clarity. Music sounds crisp and full of energy, particularly in quiet settings, where you can properly appreciate the tuning and detail. It genuinely surprised us how immersive the experience was during our testing. At times, we forgot we were listening to open earbuds entirely, which is just about the highest compliment we can give.\nThese buds also get high marks for comfort and security. Open designs can be fiddly, but the FreeArc buds sit snugly just outside the ear canal and barely moved during workouts when we tested them. The buds themselves are IP57-rated, which means they\u2019ll handle rain, dust, and sweat without trouble \u2013 although the charging case doesn\u2019t share that durability. And while the 7 hours of battery life per charge is solid, the 23 hour total with the case is a little underwhelming compared to some rivals.\nThere are a few other caveats here too. If you have an Android phone then installing the companion app can be frustrating because you have to sideload it. And while these earbuds sound excellent, they don\u2019t offer ANC, which some competitors are starting to include even in open designs. That means noisy environments can drown out the audio a bit \u2013 it's a trade-off.\nEven so, these are minor complaints. Given the sound quality, comfort and price, the Huawei FreeArc easily earn their place as our top open earbud pick.\nRead our full Huawei FreeArc review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nSound quality | The best-sounding open earbuds we've had the pleasure of testing so far. A great soundstage, though some rivals now do ANC. | 5/5 |\nFit & comfort | Designed to be lightweight and comfortable, whether you're just walking or working out. | 4/5 |\nValue | Great sound, especially for an open design, at a decent price point. | 4.5/5 |\nThe best wired earbuds\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a solid pair of buds: With great sound and a quality built for a low price, these are reliable and worth every penny.\n\u2705 Looks matter: We love the rose gold accents on these earbuds and their cool, angular design.\n\u274c You want to connect to a USB-C phone: These are 3.5mm jack headphones \u2013 consider the SoundMagic E80D instead.\n\u274c You like a premium experience: They look, feel and sound more premium than they should, but the remote and cable need improving.\nWe first tested the 1More Triple Driver earphones way back in 2017. However, the world of wired earbuds tends to move slowly than true wireless these days, which means they're still our top recommendation for most people looking for a reliable, great-looking wired option with an enjoyable sound at a great value, low price. That's why they're also still our #1 pick in our best wired earbuds guide.\nThe audio quality here can be beaten \u2013 you'll find better from many rivals, especially the Technics EAH-AZ100 at #1 in this list \u2013 but you have to pay a lot more for it. These 1More buds bring you bold and enjoyable sound, especially considering their low price and small size. In our 1MORE Triple Driver earphones review, we wrote: \"Music is exquisitely detailed with a good sense of space.\" Even more than seven years on, after testing many more earbuds, that rings true. It's also worth noting that, although there's no active noise cancellation, the earbuds do manage to create a decent seal, which leads to a pleasing amount of noise isolation.\nThe earbuds are made from aluminum and have some rose gold accents with an interesting, slightly angled design, which we think combine to give the buds a much more premium aesthetic than you'd guess from their price tag. They come with a selection of foam and silicone ear tips, which should help most people get a snug fit that's comfortable enough for long periods of listening. The only thing we noted during testing is they did stick out a little from our ears. Their cable is wrapped in fabric for extra durability but the small three-button remote that's attached to it felt a little more cheap and plastic than we'd have liked.\nWith a bold, balanced and detailed sound, superb build quality for the price and reliable, wired design, we think the 1More Triple Driver In-Ear Earphones represent great value \u2013 despite the fact they're much older than rivals in this list. It's worth mentioning here that we think if you have the money and want to stick with wired, the excellent FiiO FH19 are our latest recommendation \u2013 but you'll need deep pockets\nRead our full 1More Triple Driver In-Ear Earphones review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nSound quality | Sound quality is balanced, warm and detailed. Solid quality for the price. | 4/5 |\nFit & comfort | A fairly comfortable design that sticks out a little, but should suit most people. | 4/5 |\nValue | Already good value, but as they're getting old now you'll find them significantly reduced, so they're even easier to recommend. | 5/5 |\nThe best cheap USB C earbuds\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You crave comfort: These earbuds were easy to wear all day during our testing and stayed in our ears securely.\n\u2705 You want understated style: Expect a sleek and minimal design with a range of different color options to choose from.\n\u274c You like to have control: The controller on the buds is limited and doesn't have volume up/down buttons, not ideal for walking.\n\u274c You want excellent sound: There's decent sound for the price here, but no bassy depths or sonic details \u2013 you'd need to pay more for that.\nIf you're looking for a pair of wired USB-C earbuds, this set from Skullcandy may not offer the best high-end sonic experience compared to other options in this list, but they're a stylish and reliable choice \u2013 especially considering they're incredibly affordable at $31.99/\u00a329.99 (about AU $50). We tested even cheaper USB-C buds, and this are basically as cheap as we'd recommend going \u2013 especially if you can find them on sale.\nIn our review we made it clear that these buds \"don't whip up top-drawer sound\", especially where detail and dynamism are concerned. That being said, sound quality is decent, especially considering their price. Similarly-priced budget buds that we're reviewed sound and feel much more cheap and tinny in comparison.\nAs you'd expect, there's no active noise cancellation for this price. But thanks to good included ear tips, they have a \"noise-isolating fit\". This won't reduce all ambient noise, but it does do a decent job at keeping you focused on your music regardless of your surroundings. These ear tips come in three different sizes, which meant in our review we wrote that the buds are \"very pleasant to wear\", even for long periods of time.\nAs well as feeling good, we liked how the buds look too. In our review we said: \"They sport a sleek, curved look, and come in four snazzy colorways.\" They also have an IPX4 water-resistant rating, which means they're rain- and sweatproof. The only notable frustrating design feature is there are no volume up/down buttons on their controller, which feels limiting.\nThese aren't the best buds in our guide, far from it \u2013 but they're comfortable, they sound solid and they look good. If that's all you ask, enjoy.\nRead our full Skullcandy Set USB-C review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nSound quality | Expect solid all-round audio here, which is good for the price and design \u2013 though it does sound a little thin at times. | 3.5/5 |\nFit & comfort | A sleek design that doesn't sacrifice comfort. Expect some cable noise though, which can be frustrating. | 4/5 |\nValue | You get all the essentials here.

The almost-in-ear fit was secure during testing and we liked the design. But the open earbuds space is becoming increasingly competitive, so there just weren't enough reasons to buy them over rivals. But do take a look at our AceFast AceFit Pro review if you've been in the market for a pair of open buds.\nActivo Q1 hybrid IEM headphones: Part of the Astell & Kern high-end audio brand, these Activo buds are a fantastic option for audiophiles, but are a little specialist for this guide. If audio quality is a top priority for you, and you don\u2019t mind paying for it, read our Activo Q1 hybrid IEM headphones review.\nActivo Volcano: From Astell & Kern\u2019s lifestyle sub-brand, these wired IEMs offer punchy bass, versatile connectivity, and a premium build \u2013 all at a price that\u2019s surprisingly accessible (by A&K standards, anyway). While audiophiles might crave more refinement, the sound quality is solid for casual listening. For most people, they\u2019re well worth a look \u2013 check out our Active Volcano review for the full breakdown.\nAKG N5: You'll get great-sounding audio here, as well as top features and a USB-C dongle in the case \u2013 very handy and flexible. But it's hard to recommend strongly them because they feel a little too expensive compared to rivals and the battery life is disappointing. Read our full AKG N5 review to find out more.\nAnker Soundcore AeroClip: Another strong contender for the best open earbuds pick. These Anker buds clip around your ear rather than sitting in or over it. We were impressed by both the sound quality and the fit, and while we think the Huawei FreeArc in the list are better value overall, this are our favorite affordable clip earbuds at the time of their release. Still, they\u2019re well worth a look, check out our full Anker Soundcore AeroClip review for all the details.\nAnker Soundcore C40i: If you're looking for a decent pair of open earbuds, you'll get an impressive bass response, easy-to-use app and customizabe controls here. But, as you'll see in our Anker Soundcore C40i review, they're ultimately let down by disappointing battery life, a fit that's fine but not exactly comfortable and the fact you'll need to tweak the sound before you start listening.\nAnker SoundCore Liberty 5: These earbuds pack a punch with big bass, customizable sound, and a stacked feature set \u2013 all at a fair price. But fussy touch controls, a bland design, and average ANC hold them back. A solid option, but in a crowded field, they don\u2019t quite rise to the top. Read our full Anker SoundCore Liberty 5 review to find out more.\nApple AirPods 4: We've reviewed Apple's cheaper AirPods 4, and found them to be\u2026 fine. They have fun and full audio quality, improved comfort, and great spatial audio \u2013 but they're lacking in detail and are a bit too expensive for their quality level. We explore it in-depth in our full AirPods 4 review.\nApple AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation: As we said in our AirPods 4 with ANC review these are the best open-ear buds for iPhones. The noise cancellation is impressive despite the lack of a full ear seal, and they deliver a fun, detailed sound. Spatial audio is excellent, they\u2019re ultra-light, and battery life exceeds Apple\u2019s (admittedly underwhelming) promise. But here\u2019s the catch: you can get the AirPods Pro 2 for the same price regularly, and they\u2019re better.\nBose QuietComfort Earbuds (2024): Our full Bose QuietComfort Earbuds (2024) review raves about the noise cancellation and general sound quality here. The only drawbacks being the chunky case and lack of higher-res codecs. They may be a better option to the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds for sheer bang-for-buck \u2013 if you want the best ANC for a mid-range price, consider these.\nBowers & Wilkins Pi6: There\u2019s little wrong with these B&W buds \u2013 they sound great and have a lovely build \u2013 but it\u2019s all about the competition, as there are similar options at the same price in this guide with more features and better connectivity. Read our Bowers & Wilkins Pi6 review.\nEarfun Air 2 NC: These Earfun earbuds deliver punchy bass and customizable, effective ANC at a low price. But take a look at our Earfun Air 2 NC review to see why we think they were a little weak on sound, which means we'd continue to recommend the Sony WF-C510 buds above as our best cheap option.\nEdifier LolliClip: If you like the idea of open earbuds but you're not sure which to choose, these clip-on buds are a fun option. You get impressive sound and even some noise-cancelling. As you'll see in our Edifier LolliClip review, they also stand out with health-tracking features, like heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring. They fall short on EQ settings and app support, but overall they\u2019re a unique alternative.\nEdifier Stax Spirit S10: These buds sound fantastic and fit well. So why didn't they make the list? Well, as you'll see in our Edifier Stax Spirit S10 review, we experienced some odd pairing problems during our testing and the battery life is disappointing, too.\nFinal Audio ZE3000 SV: We liked the design of these buds. They're compact, light and comfortable. But although we liked the sound for its balance and detail, it's overall lacklustre and just not up to the standard of rivals in this guide. Do read our full Final Audio ZE3000 SV review to find out more.\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro 2: As you'll find in our Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 review, these tiny buds deliver a solid choice of noise-cancelling and transparency modes, decent sound and an impressive battery life. But the fit wasn't up to standard, and for a similar price you can find rival buds that perform better in almost every way.\nHappy Plugs Clip: As we found in our full Happy Plugs Clip review, these open earbuds missed the mark. While the charging case is sleek and the design initially impressed us, the audio quality is underwhelming, features are lacking, and the fit proved impractical during testing. With competition heating up in the open earbud space, these just don\u2019t make the cut.\nJLab Go Pop ANC: For a very cheap pair of buds that also (surprisingly!) deliver ANC, these from JLab are a great option. Take a look at our JLab Go Pop ANC review to find out why we rate them so highly.\nLG xboom Buds: We really wanted to like these buds and granted in our LG xboom Buds review we did highlight that the LG app is nice, ANC is decent, and bass is, well, very bassy. But otherwise, there's not much going for them and you can do better for the price.\nNoble FoKus Rex5: There\u2019s a great standard of build and finish here, as well as great specs. But these bold buds don\u2019t quite nail everything in the way they need to for their high asking price. Still, do take a look at our Noble FoKus Rex5 review if you\u2019re tempted by buds with a unique look to them.\nNothing Ear: The big sibling of the Nothing Ear (a) are very good, but they cost dangerously close to the cheaper (a) version and don't stand out as being dramatically better. Read our full Nothing Ear review for more, but we think the cheaper version nailed the price-to-performance ratio.\nNothing Ear Open: Open-ear buds are a big trend, but sadly Nothing hasn't hit the mark in the same way its other earbuds do. The fit and sound just aren't right, as our Nothing Ear Open review digs into.\nOnePlus Buds 4: ANC is excellent here. Not quite Bose levels, but up there. We also rated the light design and the sound is bassy. But other than that, they're a bit of a letdown. The app isn't as slick as it should be, the controls are fiddly and they're more expensive than the previous version. Read our OnePlus Buds 4 review for the full story.\nOnePlus Buds Pro 3: Read our OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review to learn all of the ways OnePlus' latest buds improve on the Pro 2s. They're packed with features, sound superb (especially for the price) and have a great battery life. But they can't compete with some of the similarly-priced buds in this guide. Some core features, like ANC and voice commands, fell short and we're not convinced the design will have mass appeal.\nOpenRock S: If you\u2019re after open earbuds that are stable, easy to use and offer solid battery life, the OpenRock S deliver on those basics. But as we noted in our full OpenRock S review, they fall short in key areas \u2013 the maximum volume is low, and the case is bulky. They\u2019re decent for the price, but with competition ramping up fast, it\u2019s worth shopping around if your budget allows.\nShure SE215: As you\u2019ll see in our Shure SE215 review, these Shure wired earbuds are a very strong choice, with impressive bass. They might not beat the 1More buds in the list above in every respect for overall bang-for-buck, but if noise isolation is a priority, we\u2019d recommend taking a look at them as alternatives.\nSony MDR-EX15AP: We recently tested these colorful wired earbuds, which are incredibly cheap. But, as you\u2019ll see from our Sony MDR-EX15AP review, that's really the only thing they have going for them. We say: spend a little more and you\u2019ll be much more satisfied.\nSony WF-1000XM5: Unfortunately, these Sony buds didn't perform as well as we'd have liked. But, the recent WH-1000XM6 leaks lead us to believe that the WF-1000XM6s can't be far away, and we've even compiled a list of 6 upgrades we want to see in Sony's new flagship buds, whenever they do arrive\u2026\nSony WF-C510: These Sony buds were our best budget pick before they were replaced by the Nothing Ear (a). As you'll see from our Sony WF-C510 review, they\u2019re still a solid affordable option, offering clear sound support for Sony\u2019s 360 Reality Audio, and an impressive 11 hours of battery life. However, with no ANC on board, the Ear (a) just edge them out overall \u2013 but the Sony are cheaper, so if you want something even lower-priced, we love them.\nSony WF-C710N: If you're in the market for affordable buds, take a look at our Sony WF-C710N review because they're a solid choice. ANC is the star of the show here \u2013 especially considering the price \u2013 but everything else is done well too. They're not perfect, on-ear controls don't always work well and the new colorway can look a bit cheap, but they almost made this guide.\nMeet the team\nOur audio tech team put hundreds of pairs to the test in a range of environments in order to determine if they're worth recommending or not. How do we know what to look for? Because we've collectively got years (make that decades) of experience reviewing all sorts of headphones, from expensive, noise-cancelling buds that block out the world to budget earbuds that are cheap and cheerful.\nBecky Scarrott is the Audio Editor at TechRadar.

Some of the top waterproof earbuds can even be used for swimming. The best bone-conducting headphones are popular for fitness fans too, because they don't block outside sounds.\nIf you're going to be wearing your earbuds for long periods, then comfort and weight are a top priority.\nWe\u2019ve included both wired and wireless earbuds on this list, but you don't have to compromise on audio quality by going wire-free \u2013 the B&W Pi8 above are proof of that. If you do opt for wireless or true wireless earbuds, make sure the battery life is up to scratch, otherwise you may find yourself caught short without any music in the middle of your commute.\nThe best earbuds for you should sound good to your ears. Which means if you're a dedicated audiophile, look for buds that support Hi-Res Audio codecs, like LDAC and aptX HD Bluetooth for stellar connectivity.\nWe also recommend you consider your budget. If you want cheap earbuds you may have to sacrifice features, like ANC or a long battery life. It\u2019s all about weighing up what\u2019s more important to you.\nFinally, the brand you choose will depend on what you're looking for \u2013 but we're careful with our lists. That means all of the earbuds and in-ear headphones above come from brands we trust. Still, if you're not sure where to start looking, respected brands like Sony, Apple, Cambridge Audio, Jabra, and Nura are good places to start.\nAre earbuds waterproof?\nSome are, but not all of them. Always check the IP rating. Many modern earbuds are water- and sweat-resistant to a point, which means they\u2019re fine for workouts or getting caught in the rain but wouldn't survive a dip in a pool.\nLook for ratings like IPX4 (mostly splash-resistant) or IPX7 (can survive full submersion) in our best waterproof headphones guide if you need something more rugged. Just remember that even waterproof buds often have cases that aren\u2019t water-resistant.\nDo earbuds emit radiation?\nSort of. But it\u2019s very low-level and considered completely safe. Wireless earbuds use Bluetooth, which is a wireless technology that emits non-ionizing radiation (that's the same type used in Wi-Fi and mobile phones).\nThere\u2019s currently no solid evidence that Bluetooth radiation from earbuds is harmful and it's far below the safety limits set by global health organizations.\nWhat earbuds have the best bass?\nIf you love deep, punchy bass, then look for models specifically tuned for low-end performance. We commented on the solid bass from the Technics EAH-AZ100, Apple AirPods Pro 2, Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, and JBL Live Beam 3 buds above, so take your pick depending on your other preferences.\nIf bass is a priority, then we'd also recommend that you look for earbuds that let you adjust EQ settings in their companion apps. That way you can dial in the exact sort of thump you want.\nDo earbuds damage hearing?\nWell, they can if you were to listen at high volumes for a very long time. Prolonged exposure to loud audio in any form is one of the leading causes of hearing loss, especially if you were to use earbuds that sit close to your ear canal.\nHowever, it's worth mentioning that using noise-cancelling earbuds can actually help protect your ears, because you won\u2019t need to crank up the volume to block out the world quite as much, and they can stop loud outside sounds from damaging your ears.\nA good rule we've heard experts recommend is to listen at around 60% volume for no more than 60 minutes at a time \u2013 though most earbuds here, you probably won't need the volume that high.\nDo earbuds have microphones?\nYes, most modern earbuds \u2013 especially most of the wireless ones we're recommending here \u2013 come with built-in microphones.\nBut don't be spooked. These microphones are essential for phone calls, controlling voice assistants and even for effective noise cancellation. Because they listen for exterior sounds, like traffic or voices, and help the earbuds create an \u201canti-noise\u201d signal to cancel it out before it reaches your ears. The more mics (and the smarter the tech to go with them), the better the noise-blocking tends to be.\nHow long should earbuds last?\nThat depends on how you use and care for them. As a general rule, most earbuds will give you two to three years of solid performance before the battery life starts to decline.\nTaking care of the battery (not letting them fully run out of power, not leaving them in extreme heat) can help them last longer. Even once the battery starts to go, it usually just means a shorter total playing time, not that they stop working suddenly.\nWired earbuds can last much longer, sometimes even a decade or more, as long as you don't break the cable.\nIn both wired and wireless cases, however, water and/or sweat can be the silent killer. If you wear earbuds to the gym that don't promise any waterproofing, sweat may get in and damage them.\nWhich earbuds have the longest battery life?\nSome of the best performers in our guide above include the JBL Live Beam 3 and Cambridge Melomania A100.\nBut you'll want to look for the amount of battery you get from the buds themselves in a single charge as well as the amount you get from the case. Because some of the buds listed here deliver a relatively short amount of time from the buds, but hours and hours from the case.\nFor example, the Nothing Ear (a) only give you 5.5 hours from the buds, but 24.5 hours from the case. If you have an opportunity to stop listening and charge them, that shorter bud battery life won't be an issue.\nBut if you want guaranteed all-day-wear, the JBL Live Beam 3 offer an impressive 12 hours from the buds and 48 hours in total, including the case.\nHow we test the best earbuds\n\u2611\ufe0f More than 2,400 audio reviews\n\u2611\ufe0f 15 years of product testing\n\u2611\ufe0f Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\n\u2611\ufe0f Nearly 200,000 hours testing tech\nWe've tested each of the top earbuds in this guide to make sure they tick some key boxes, which are reflected in our full review.\nFeatures: One of these is the features \u2013 whether they compare well to other earbuds in the same price for elements such as connection options, smart app controls, active noise cancellation and battery life. We test all these features in different ways. We try the active noise cancellation in different real-world environments, and we check battery life by running them down and tracking the timing.\nAudio: Most importantly, we also want to be sure the sound is excellent, with clarity and a decent level of bass. We listen to music from a range of sources, from social apps and YouTube, to lower-quality streams from the likes of Spotify, to high-quality files from streamers such as Apple Music and Tidal. We'll listen to a range of genres, and we'll use a mix of new music and tracks we've known for years and in which we can hear all the subtle differences.\nComfort: Next is comfort and wearability. You need to know you'll be able to pop the best in-ear buds in your ears for hours at a time, so they have to feel secure and comfortable. Some seem naturally designed for a snug fit, others come with different silicone tip options to help you get the fit just right. In terms of design, we also look for compact buds, those that don't stick out of your ear too much and (in the case of true wireless designs) earbuds that come with a small charging case for slipping into a backpack, handbag or even a pocket.\nValue: And when we've tested all this, we judge them on their value, which essentially means how all of the above balances against their price, and the price of other earbuds.\nComparison: At the time of writing, we're beginning a new testing procedure for earbuds to enable us to add more direct comparison between buds, to make it easier for you to choose which one will suit you best. We'll re-test our current favorite earbuds using the new system, and we'll use it for reviews in the future. You can read the full information about how we test earbuds at TechRadar at that link, but the crucial part is that we're adding certain specific and repeatable tests that all of our reviews can use, so we know we're getting a fair and even comparison between earbuds.\nSound quality testing: The major part of this is a particular playlist that will be used for sound-quality testing, from a specific source device and music service. Our reviewers will also test other songs and sound sources, but this playlist provide a baseline comparison, and you can copy the playlist to make your own comparisons, if you like.\nMicrophone quality testing: We'll also test the microphone quality for picking up speech by recording us talking, and we'll make those recordings available to hear on the site, so you can compare them yourselves, if you want. And we'll detail exactly how long the battery lasts in real-world use, and provide that information for easy comparison too, in tables. At the moment, we're still working on gathering this information, so please bear with us \u2013 an even better buying guide is coming!\nLatest updates to the best earbuds\n8 August 2025\nRefreshed the introduction. Switched the original Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds for the newer Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen) as our 'Best for ANC' pick. Added several new entries to our 'Other earbuds we've tested' section. Checked the whole guide for older products and made sure everything is up to date.\n3 July 2025\nExpanded the introduction with more information about our testing. Updated the Nothing Ear (a) entry to be our 'best budget' pick, based on long-term changes to its price. Added the Cambridge Melomania A100 as our new 'best mid-range' choice, following its recent review. Updated all of our entries to reflect the market in 2025, and added scorecards to each, so readers can see how they compare at a glance. Added several new entries into our FAQs section. Added some recently reviewed earbuds into our list of other products we've tested.\n1 June 2025\nSwapped the Shokz OpenFit for the Huawei FreeArc as our 'best open earbuds' pick, based on recent testing. Added several new options we've reviewed this month into our list of other earbuds we've tested, including the AKG N5 and OpenRock S.\nSee more updates\u2026\n1 May 2025\nAdded the Shokz OpenFit as our 'best open earbuds' pick. Updated the 'also consider' section to include several of the earbuds we've tested recently that are great but don't quite make the cut for this guide.\n3 April 2025\nRewrote the introduction and included a mention to the upcoming Sony WF-C710N, which we're currently reviewing. Added the LG xboom Buds to our 'also consider' section.\n7 March 2025\nRefreshed and tightened up the introduction. Edited the 'also consider' section to condense down our recommendations.\n10 February 2024\nChecked all recent reviews against the options on this list, and updated the list of other earbuds we've tested we've recently.\n9 January 2024\nReplaced the Technics EAH-AZ80 with the Technics EAH-AZ100 in the top spot in this guide. Rewrote the intro to reflect this and added other options to our 'also consider' section\n19 December 2024\nChecked all entries against our latest reviews, and updated the 'Also Consider' section with recent reviews of earbuds that didn't make onto our curated list.\n21 November 2024\nAdded the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds in as our 'best for ANC' pick, removing the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2 that are currently out of stock in most places so not worth recommending.\n7 November 2024\nRefreshed the introduction. Added new images to each entry to give readers a better look at the devices. Itemized our 'how we test' section to add more clarity about our reviewing process. Added a 'meet the team' section to give you an insight into our combined tech knowledge and expertise. Added news and suggestions to several of our entries, like the JBL Tour Pro 3 in our JBL Live Beam 3 entry. Added some extra recommendations into our 'also consider' section, like the Edifier Stax Spirit S10.\n11 October 2024\nSwapped the JLab JBuds Mini for the Sony WF-C510 as our 'best budget' pick. Switched the Samsung Buds 2 Pro for the Samsung Buds 3 Pro based on our review as our 'best for Samsung' choice. Swapped the Final Audio ZE8000 Mk2 out for the Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 in our 'best for sound' category. Added several recent reviews to our 'Also consider' section, including AirPods 4 and OnePlus Buds Pro 3.\n3 September 2024\nAdded the 1More Triple Driver In-Ear Headphones as our 'Best wired' pick based on our review, and recent testing of the competition.\n30 July 2024\nAdded the JLab JBuds Mini as the best super-cheap option, and updated the 'Also Consider' section with information on the latest products that didn't make it into this list.\n1 July 2024\nAdded the JBL Lve Beam 3 as our top choice for battery life, thanks to their 48-hour total. Removed the older 1More Triple Driver wired set, since the Skullcandy Set USB-C occupy that wired space extremely well, if you're looking for something inexpensive and wired.\n7 June 2024\nWe added the Skullcandy Set USB-C wired earbuds as the best super-cheap wired buds that we'd actually recommend buying, based on testing of several big-name budget options.\n9 May 2024\nSwapped the Sony WF-C700N for the Nothing Ear (a) as the best mid-range option. They're extremely close in quality, but the Nothing's slightly better noise cancellation and hi-res support just win out.\n8 April 2024\nConsidered adding the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 to this guide, but after discussing with the team, we've decided that while these 2024-issue earbuds are very good indeed, other products narrowly edge them in each key aspect (ie. sound, ANC, battery life, feature set) \u2013 so there's no clear reason for their inclusion. Updated the intro here to reflect the WF-1000XM4 being no longer readily available, hence their departure from this list, and explained why the Technics EAH-AZ80 are now our top pick. Added new links to the buying guides to better direct readers.\n19 March 2024\nRemoved the Sony WH-1000XM4 due to stock running out at last. Technics EAH-AZ80 moved to number 1, Sony WH-C700N moved to number 2, JLab Go Air Pop moved to number 3.\n8 February 2024\nAdded the Beats Fit Pro as our best workout buds, reflecting what's in our dedicated guide.\n22 January 2024\nAdded Final ZE8000 MK2, and removed the now-discontinued Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 Plus. Updated all copy throughout.\n10 November 2023\nAdded more information about how we test, and added a link to our Black Friday earbuds deals coverage.\n8 October 2023\nChecked all entries against current reviews to ensure list is relevant.\n6 September 2023\nRefreshed entries to reflect current prices/value ahead of sales events later in the year.\n30 August 2023\nChanged the main image.\n24 August 2023\nRewrote each product entry to summarize the features, sound quality, design and value of each review, including adding in 'buy it if' and 'don't buy it if' boxouts.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nBecky became Audio Editor at TechRadar in 2024, but joined the team in 2022 as Senior Staff Writer, focusing on all things hi-fi.
