  "description": "Bank of Thailand Governor Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput says the country faces a lot of structural challenges, but he thinks 2025 GDP growth target is intact. He speaks with Haslinda Amin on \"Insight with Haslinda Amin.\" (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "THE BANK OF THAILAND HEADQUARTERS IS THE GOVERNOR. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US TODAY. MY PLEASURE. HASLINDA: IT IS SUCH A POIGNANT MOMENT RIGHT NOW, WITH THE SITUATION POLITICALLY IN THE COUNTRY AND HOW YOUR TERM AS ENDING AS WELL. IT'S ALMOST LIKE WE ARE BACK TO SQUARE ONE, READ EXACTLY HOW IT ALL STARTED. HOW ARE YOU LOOKING AT THE POLITICAL SITUATION HERE? AS YOU MENTION, IT'S THE POLITICAL SITUATION THAT'S BEEN CHALLENGING. I WILL HAVE SEEN BEFORE THE END OF MY FIVE YEARS FOR PRIME MINISTER'S PROBABLY. THERE'S BEEN CERTAINLY A LOT OF TURMOIL ON THAT FRONT. THE PROBLEM FOR US HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THOSE CHALLENGES, WE NEED REALLY DEEP, LONG-TERM STRUCTURAL REFORM. THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS SUCH A LIMITED HORIZON, SO MUCH TURNOVER LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO DO THAT. HARD TO TALK ABOUT STRUCTURAL CHANGES AND REFORMS, GIVEN THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS ALWAYS LOOKING NEAR TERM. THERE'S JUST NO CERTAINTY IN TERMS OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION. HOW BIG A RISK IS THIS CURRENT SITUATION TO THE ECONOMY? ? WHICH IS ALREADY STRUGGLING TO TURN AROUND? 2% GROWTH IS HALF OF WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. I WOULD SAY THIS. ONE THING THAT WE'VE BEEN FORTUNATE ABOUT HIS OUR BUFFERS ARE REASONABLY STRONG. FROM A VULNERABILITY STANDPOINT, THE CHANCES OF THE COUNTRY HEADING INTO A CRISIS ARE FAIRLY LOW. HASLINDA: WHY? WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S LOW? WE LOOK AT THE USUAL THINGS THAT CAUSE A CRISIS. YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT. YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE HIGH LEVELS OF FOREIGN DEBT. YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE LOW EXTERNAL RESERVES. ON THAT FRONT, WE ARE OK. IT'S A BANKING CRISIS. OUR BANK'S OR LIQUID. WELL-CAPITALIZED AND WHATNOT. THERE ARE NPL'S THAT ARE INCREASING BUT THEY ARE WELL PROVISIONED. CHANCES OF A BANKING CRISIS, REASONABLY LOW. FISCAL SITUATION IS NOT AS GOOD AS IT ONCE WAS. THERE ARE CHALLENGES ON THAT FRONT. I THINK IT'S NOT APPROACHING GREEK CRISIS TYPE LEVELS. ON THE WHOLE, THE CHANCES OF US HAVING A BIG DOWNSIDE CRISIS ARE LOW. THAT SAID, THE UPSIDE IS LIMITED. THAT'S A BIG ISSUE. IF YOU LOOK RIGHT NOW, ONE THING THAT'S CLEAR FROM ALL OF THIS UNCERTAINTY IS THAT THIS UNCERTAINTY IS GOING TO BE WITH US FOR QUITE SOME TIME. THAT'S AN OVERHANG IN TERMS OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND WHAT IT'S LOOKING FOR. IN TERMS OF POLICY INITIATIVES, WE WANT TO SEE THAT LONG-TERM PERSPECTIVE, DEEP STRUCTURAL REFORM. YOU ARE NOT LIKELY TO SEE THAT. IT'S A DEAL THAT'S TALKED ABOUT GOING THROUGH. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED A FOUR-MONTH PROCESS AND THEN ELECTIONS. ELECTIONS TAKE A WHILE FOR THE NEW GOVERNMENT TO COME IN. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AT LEAST BALLPARK EIGHT MONTHS WHERE YOU HAVE THE GOVERNMENT WHICH IS NOT THERE AND IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO PASS. HASLINDA: MIGHT THAILAND HAVE TO RETHINK ITS GROWTH TARGET? NO. THE 2% GROWTH TARGET IS INTACT. WHEN WE CAME OUT WITH THAT NUMBER, WE WERE SOMEWHAT CRITICIZED. IF AN'S HAVE TURNED OUT TO PROVE US CORRECT. LARGELY, IS THE FIRST HALF LOOKED GOOD, THE FIGURE THAT CAME OUT WAS 3%. EVEN IF THE SECOND HALF GOES TO 1%, YOU WILL SEE A 2% NUMBER. IT'S UNLIKELY TO SEE SOMETHING BELOW 1%. EVEN DESPITE ALL THE TARIFFS AND SLOW DOWN AND WHATNOT. FOR US RIGHT NOW, WHEN WE LOOK AT IT, WE ARE FAIRLY CONFIDENT THAT WE EXPECT TO SEE A 2% FIGURE THIS YEAR. THE WORD IS NEXT YEAR. WE HAVE RIGHT NOW PUBLIC 1.7% FIGURE FOR NEXT YEAR. I WOULD SAY WITH ALL THE UNCERTAINTY, THERE IS SOME RISK TO THAT. THE RISK COMES WITH THE BUDGET. IF THE ELECTIONS HAPPEN AND THE NEXT YEAR BUDGET GETS DELAYED, THAT IT'S THE FOURTH QUARTER CALENDAR YEAR FIGURE NEXT YEAR, PUTTING SOME DOWNSIDE RISK. HASLINDA: WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT CHINA. THAILAND -- CHINA IS A RISK TO THAILAND AS WELL. ALSO THE MARKET FOR TOURISM. THE DATA SO FAR HAS BEEN MIXED. IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD. WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE PROPERTY SECTOR IN THAILAND, GOLDMAN SAID THAT PRICES COULD GO DOWN AS MUCH AS 10% IN 2027. THAT'S NOT GOOD NEWS FOR SENTIMENT. THAT WOULD IMPACT TALENT EVEN MORE. HASLINDA: -- > > YEAH. THE BIG RISK FOR US, WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE RAPID PRICE INCREASES THAT YOU SAW IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND WHATNOT. THIS IS A HUGE PROPERTY BUBBLE HAPPENING HERE IN THAILAND. BACK TO CHINA. FOR ME THAT'S WHERE THE RISK IS. FOR US, IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT ON THE BROAD PICTURE OF THE ECONOMY. WHY? IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE EXPORTS. CHINA IS AN IMPORTANT DESTINATION, BOTH IN TERMS OF FINAL GOODS AND ALSO PART OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN GOING ELSEWHERE. THE A BIT -- BIG IMPACT IS ON TOURISM. AS YOU MENTION, TOURISM IS A HUGE FOOTPRINT HERE IN THAILAND. THE CHINESE TOURISM WILL COME BACK. LAST YEAR, WE SAW ABOUT SIX TO 7 MILLION CHINESE TOURISTS. THIS YEAR TO DATE, 3 MILLION. WE EXPECT BY THE FULL YEAR TO SEE ABOUT FOUR. THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT DROP-OFF. WHILE THE TOTAL TOURISM SPENDING HAS BEEN HOLDING UP REASONABLY WELL, BECAUSE WE SEE MORE EUROPEAN TOURISTS WHO TEND TO SPEND MORE AND STAY LONGER, THERE'S A DISTRIBUTION EFFECT. THE CHINESE TOURISTS GO TO CERTAIN KINDS OF SPENDING AND WHATNOT. THAT SEGMENT IS HIT VERY HARD. YOU GO AROUND A LOT IN CERTAIN AREAS AND YOU SEE THE RESTAURANTS BEING VERY QUIET AND WHATNOT. HASLINDA: THE PICTURE IS NOT LOOKING PRETTY. SOME ARE SUGGESTING THAT THE CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADE MAY HAPPEN. IS THERE BASIS TO THAT? IF YOU LOOK AT THE CREDIT RATING REPORT, THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME MORE FISCAL CONSOLIDATION WHICH WE AT THE BANK OF THAILAND HAVE BEEN SAYING THE SAME THING. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE FISCAL CONSOLIDATION, ESPECIALLY OVER THE MEDIUM TERM. WE NEEDED TO DO A LOT OF THE PHYSICAL STUFF THAT WE DID DURING COVID BUT NOW IT'S A TIME TO TIGHTEN OUR BELTS. SO YEAH. IF WE DON'T SEE CLEARER SIGNS OF IMMEDIATE FISCAL CONSOLIDATION, PARTICULARLY METRIC, THEY'VE BEEN FLAGGING AND PAYING ATTENTION TO INTEREST PAYMENTS AS A SHARE OF THE BUDGET AND THAT'S BEEN HEAPING UP. THE OTHER THING THEY CITED WAS THE POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY AS ONE OF THE POSSIBLE TRIGGERS. SO YEAH. THAT IS CERTAINLY A POSSIBILITY. IS THERE REASON TO THINK THAT THAILAND NEEDS MORE RATE CUTS THEM HAS ALREADY BEEN PRICED IN BY THE MARKET? YEAH. I SHOULD CAFFE OUT THIS BY SAYING THAT MY TERM IS ENDING. I WILL NOT BE AT THE NEXT MEETING. I CAN'T COMMENT ON WHAT OUR THINKING HAS BEEN TODAY. I THINK THAT FOR US, MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE IS REASONABLY COMFORTABLE NOW. WHEN WE SET RATES, DO SO AND OUTLOOK DEPENDENT MANNER. THE OUTLOOK FOR THIS YEAR SEEMS PRETTY MUCH CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING. I FEEL THAT THE RATES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THAT AND THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE NEW RISK THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. THE UNCERTAINTY HAS MORE TO DO WITH NEXT YEAR. WE NEED TO SEE HOW THINGS EVOLVE ON THAT FRONT. THE THING I WOULD URGE ALSO TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT WE DO HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF POLICY STATE -- SPACE LEFT. RATES ARE 1.5%. THAT'S THE FOURTH LOWEST IN THE WORLD. ONLY JAPAN, CHINA, THE SWISS HAVE LOWER RATES THAN WE DO. NOT A WHOLE LOT OF POLICY SPACE ROOM LEFT TO CUT RATES. I THINK ONE OF THE LESSONS WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT THERE WILL BE SHOCKS THAT WE NEVER ANTICIPATED THAT WILL COME ALONG. IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN A POLICY SPACE TO TRY TO HANDLE THOSE THINGS. HASLINDA: YOU SAID THAT 1.5 IS ALREADY LOW. GIVEN THE CURRENT SITUATION AND ECONOMY, TERMINAL RATES SHOULD BE BELOW 1%. UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES YUQIAN: YUQIAN: SHOULD RATES GO BELOW 1%? WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN? A MATERIAL DETERIORATION IN THE OUTLOOK. WE ARE OUTLOOK DEPENDENT. IF WE SEE A MATERIAL DETERIORATION, THAT WOULD WARRANT FURTHER RATE CUTS. HAVE TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE HAVE A FLEXIBLE INFLATION TARGET FRAMEWORK. WE DON'T LOOK JUST AT THE GDP NUMBERS. WE ALSO LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE FINANCIAL STABILITY FRONT. VERY HIGH DEBT. THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE. ALSO WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE INFLATION TERMS. WE TAKE THOSE THREE THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION. HASLINDA: THROUGHOUT YOUR TIME, YOU RESISTED CALLS TO CUT RATES FURTHER. GIVEN WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW WITH GREATER CLARITY ON WHERE INFLATION IS, INFLATION HAS BEEN PRETTY BENIGN. SHOULD YOU HAVE CUT MORE? SHOULD YOU HAVE CUT EARLIER TO ENSURE THAT GROWTH IS ACTUALLY BETTER THAN WHERE IT IS TODAY? ONE CAN ALWAYS ARGUE ABOUT WHETHER AT THE MARGIN, SHOULD HAVE CUT 25 BASIS POINTS YOUR THERE. SOONER, LATER, SLOWER, WHATEVER. BROAD STROKES, I THINK WE ARE BALLPARK WHERE WE NEED TO BE. WHY DO I SAY THAT? IF YOU LOOK, IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOGMATIC IN TERMS OF OUR APPROACH TO RATES. RIGHT NOW, THERE ARE STILL CALLS FOR US TO CUT RATES. LOOK AT WHAT WE DID OVER A FIVE-YEAR TERM. WHEN COVID HIT, WE BROUGHT RATES DOWN TO 0.5%. YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT IT TAKES. THEN WE HAVE THE UKRAINE THING. INFLATION HERE, PEAK. 7.9%. HIGHEST IN THE REGION. WE WERE FACING CALLS CONSISTENTLY THAT WE WERE BEHIND THE CURVE, WE NEEDED TO RAISE RATES. FASTER AND BUY MORE. CHUNKY BITS. 50 BASIS POINTS TIME. WE SAW OUR ECONOMY RECOVERING MUCH MORE SLOWER THAN US BECAUSE WE ARE SO TOURISM DEPENDENT. WE TOOK A GRADUAL, MEASURED APPROACH. WE RAISE SOME BACK TO 2.5%. AIMING TO GET IT BACK TO NEUTRAL WITCHES BALLPARK IN THAT RANGE. THEN COME THE NEXT PHASE, WE WERE FACING STRUCTURAL HEADWINDS. RECOVERY HAS BEEN SLOWER THAN EXPECTED IN THE HOUSEHOLD INCOME FRONT. WE WENT AND WE GOT NEW SHOCKS WITH THE TARIFF SHOCKS AND WHATNOT. WITHOUT THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO MOVE FROM A NEUTRAL STANCE TO A MORE ACCOMMODATIVE ONE. THAT LED TO OUR NEXT STAGE OF LOWERING RATES DOWN. I KNOW THAT ON THE OPTICS, IT'S EASY, IT'S EASY TO SAY YOU SHOULD CUT RATES. WHY? GROWTH IS BELOW YOUR POTENTIAL. INFLATION IS BELOW YOUR TARGET. FROM A FINANCIAL STABILITY STANDPOINT, CREDIT ISN'T GOING THAT FAST. IT'S OUR JOB TO NOT DO THE EASY THING. IT'S OUR JOB TO LOOK BENEATH THE NUMBERS AND NOT JUST LOOK AT THE HEADLINE NUMBERS AND LOOK AT WHY THOSE NUMBERS ARE WHY THEY ARE. WHY IS GROWTH LOWER THAN POTENTIAL? HASLINDA: IT IS YOUR JOB TO LOOK AT INFLATION AND GROWTH. LACKLUSTER GROWTH AT 2%. IF YOU HAD CUT RATES 200 BASIS POINTS INSTEAD OF THE 100 THAT YOU DID, WOULD GROWTH HAVE BEEN HIGHER? SHORT ANSWER, VERY LITTLE. THAT'S WHY I SAY IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK BEHIND THE NUMBERS AND LOOK AT MY GROWTH IS SO LOW. WHY IS INFLATION BELOW TARGET? IF YOU LOOK AT THE GROWTH PATTERN IN THAILAND, EVERY TIME WE GET HIT WITH A CRISIS AND WE RECOVER, IT TAKES US A WHILE TO RECOVER. WE COME BACK AT A SLOWER GROWTH TRAJECTORY. POST-1997 CRISIS, 5%. 2008, GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS. CRACKED DOWN TO 3%. AFTER COVID, DOWN TO 2%. THAT'S THE TREND YOU ARE SEEING WHICH DOES NOT REFLECT THE CYCLICAL STUFF ABOUT WHETHER RATES ARE AT THIS OR THAT LOW. THAT REFLECTS STRUCTURAL STUFF WE ARE SEEING. A LACK OF RESILIENCE IN THE ECONOMY THAT WE ARE NOT ABLE TO REBOUND FROM THESE CRISES. A LOT OF STUFF LIKE DEMOGRAPHICS. A FEW PEOPLE WORKING. THE ONLY WAY TO GET GROWTH UP IS TO GET HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY. WE HAVEN'T BEEN GETTING NEW KINDS OF TECHNOLOGY, INCREASING OUR CAPACITY ON THAT FRONT. THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS WE NEED TO ADDRESS. RATE CUTS ALONE ARE NOT GOING TO DELIVER THAT. YOU LOOK AT INFLATION, BELOW THE TARGET. IT'S BEEN A BIT NEGATIVE FOR A COUPLE MONTHS NOW. OUR JOB, LOOK BEHIND THE NUMBERS. LOOK AT, WHY IS INFLATION COMING BELOW TARGET? IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF THIS DEFLATIONARY PROBLEM, NEGATIVE WAGE PRICE SPIRAL. PEOPLE AREN'T SPENDING BECAUSE THEY EXPECT PRICES TO GO DOWN. NO. IT'S BECAUSE OF SUPPLY-SIDE STUFF. A LOT OF IT IS ENERGY AND RAW FOOD. THAT'S NOT STUFF THAT INTEREST RATES CAN AFFECT. AGAIN, WE LOOK AT THE BROADER PICTURE. WE DON'T SEE THAT BIG RISK OF DEFLATION. AGAIN, I TAKE YOUR POINT. IT LOOKS LIKE WE SHOULD BE CUTTING BUT IT'S OUR JOB. HASLINDA: YOUR SUCCESSOR IS KNOWN TO BE PRO RATE CUT. AGGRESSIVELY PUSHING FOR THAT, IN LINE WITH WHAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN PROPOSING. IS THERE A SENSE THAT HE WAS CHOSEN AS GOVERNOR BECAUSE OF THE STANCE THAT HE'S ADOPTED? THERE WAS A VERY WELL RESPECTED DEPUTY GOVERNOR WHO WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE TO TAKE UP THAT POSITION. IT'S NOT FOR ME TO COMMENT ON WHAT THE SELECTION COMMITTEE AND WHAT THE MINISTER OF FINANCE DID. I WON'T GO THERE. I WOULD SAY, GETTING BACK TO WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT. IF WE CUT RATES SOONER, WHETHER WE WOULD'VE SEEN A STRONGER GROWTH IMPACT. LIKE I SAID, THE THING THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER IS, IF YOU CUT THE UPSIDE, WHAT DO YOU GET FROM IT? HOW MUCH ROOM, HOW MUCH POLICY SPACE DO YOU HAVE LEFT? KEEP IN MIND THAT WE GOT CALLS TO CUT RATES WAY BACK BEFORE THE TARIFF STUFF HAPPENED. IMAGINE IF WE HAD CUT RATES. WE GOT THE TARIFF SHOCKS. HASLINDA: I'D LIKE TO GET BACK BECAUSE FED INDEPENDENCE, BOT INDEPENDENCE IS A HUGE CHRISTIAN FOR THE MARKET RIGHT NOW. WHAT THE -- MESSAGE DO YOU THINK THIS IS SENDING TO INVESTORS INTERESTED IN PUTTING MONEY IN THAILAND WHEN INDEPENDENCE IS IN QUESTION. ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE FED OR FOR THE BANK OF THAILAND? HASLINDA: BOTH CENTRAL BANKS, I UNDERSTAND SITUATIONALLY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE UNDER PRESSURE. THAT'S WHAT WE SEE HAPPENING NOT JUST IN THAILAND BUT IN MANY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. I THINK OF ANYTHING, WE'VE DEMONSTRATED THAT WE ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN INDEPENDENCE AND TRY TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT AND NOT PAY. WE NEED TO LISTEN BUT NOT TO HEED TO THE DEMANDS OF GOVERNMENT. I THINK IN A SENSE, INDEPENDENCE HAS BEEN WHAT I WOULD CALL TRIED AND TRUE AND PROVEN. I WOULD EMPHASIZE THIS. YUQIAN: SO FAR. -- HASLINDA: SO FAR. GOING FORWARD, THE FINANCE MINISTER SAID NOW THE BOT AND THE MINISTRY WILL WORK HAND IN GLOVE. MEANING THAT THE BOT WILL DO WHAT'S IN LINE WITH THE GOVERNMENT. WORKING TOGETHER DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO DO EXACTLY WHAT THE INDUSTRY TELLS YOU TO DO. IN TERMS OF COLLABORATION, THERE'S MANY OF THE -- MANY THINGS THAT WE HAVE. DURING MY TERM WHEN THERE WAS TURBULENCE ON THE POLITICAL SIDE, WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE. THE INDEPENDENCE OF ANY CENTRAL BANK, INCLUDING THE BANK OF THAILAND, IS NOT JUST ABOUT ONE PERSON. IT'S ABOUT THE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK THAT YOU HAVE. IT'S ABOUT THE LEGAL SET UP THAT YOU HAVE. IT'S ABOUT THE WHOLE INSTITUTIONAL SETUP. HASLINDA: SO YOU WERE CONFIDENT THAT THE GOVERNOR WILL NOT CUT RATES MORE AGGRESSIVELY THAN WHAT'S NEEDED? I CAN'T COMMENT ON THE UPCOMING DECISION. HASLINDA: THE CONCERN IS THERE. HE STANDS FOR AGGRESSIVE CUTS. HE MAY BE DOING THAT. IS THERE A CONCERN THAT HE MIGHT END UP DOING IT? YOU WILL HAVE TO ASK HIM. IT'S NOT FOR ME TO COMMENT. I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THE EMBASSY HAS BEEN THINKING AND HAS BEEN THINKING. WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SAY WAS THAT THE INDEPENDENT CENTRAL BANK IS DEEPER THAN JUST ONE PERSON. IT'S BEEN ABOUT 80 YEARS. SILENT, TECHNOCRATIC PEOPLE. 3100 PEOPLE HERE WORKING. SO IT'S PART OF THE DNA OF THE PLACE. I DON'T THINK IT IS SOMETHING THAT DEPENDS UPON ONE PERSON. THERE'S A WHOLE ECOSYSTEM AROUND IT. WE WILL HAVE TO SEE. I'M NOT SAYING THAT THERE ARE NO RISKS. WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE. THERE WILL BE CHANGES IN THE COMMITTEE. IN HIS SPEECH RECENTLY. LET'S GET BACK TO OUR GUEST TODAY. WHAT'S THE SENSE YOU ARE GETTING FROM THE REPEATED CALLS FOR THE FED TO CUT RATES? FED INDEPENDENCE IS A BIG QUESTION FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD. LAGARDE SAYING THAT IT IS A DANGER TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. YEAH. I GUESS THE TERM THAT WE USE IS UNFORTUNATE. THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT ECONOMISTS DISAGREE ON. I THINK ONE THING THAT THEY TEND TO AGREE ON IS THAT CENTRAL-BANK INDEPENDENCE IS A GOOD. IT'S A TRIED AND PROVEN THING THAT IT WORKS, IT'S IMPORTANT. THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU VIOLATE CENTRAL-BANK INDEPENDENCE HISTORICALLY AND ACROSS THE WORLD. ANY COUNTRIES THAT VIOLATE THAT, THE PROBLEMS THAT ARISE. THE COME ABOUT WHEN YOU VIOLATE THAT. IT'S A HARD LESSON. A SHAME THAT IS BEING NOT REMEMBERED AS WELL. ESPECIALLY AT THE PLACE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE WORLD'S SAFE HAVEN. THERE A DANGER THAT THERE ARE SPILLOVERS. INCREASES THE CHALLENGE THAT IT HAPPENS SOMEWHERE ELSE. PEOPLE CAN SAY, WHY NOT? WHAT MIGHT THE REPERCUSSIONS BE FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD? THE MOST IMPORTANT CENTRAL BANK IN THE WORLD SETS A POLICY TONE FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD. HOW MIGHT THIS PLAY OUT? I DON'T KNOW. TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. TO THE POINT THAT LAGARDE SAID, THIS IS DANGEROUS TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. HOW MIGHT THIS PLAY OUT? I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WILL PLAY OUT. JUST THE KINDS OF THINGS WE ARE SEEING. HASLINDA: WE ARE ALREADY SEEING THAT. YIELDS ARE GOING UP IN THE DOLLAR IS WEAKENING. THOSE ARE THE IMMEDIATE MARKET EFFECTS. REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW THE REST OF IT PLAYS OUT. LIKE I SAID, SOME OF THE EFFECTS THAT WE WORRY ABOUT REGARDLESS OF HOW IT PLAYS OUT IS -- HOW DO I PUT THIS? IT INCREASES THE SCOPE OF WHAT'S ACCEPTABLE. NOT QUITE THE WORD. IN THE REALM OF THE POSSIBLE. THINGS THAT WE NEVER THOUGHT OR WERE LIKELY. I THINK IT'S ALSO BROUGHT INTO STARK RELIEF THAT A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE TOOK FOR GRANTED THAT WE THOUGHT WERE CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT WE THOUGHT WERE GUARDRAILS WERE JUST NORMS. THOSE NORMS CAN BE VIOLATED. SO YEAH. THOSE WILL BE SOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT. HASLINDA: TAKE A LOOK AT THE CURRENT GLOBAL BOND RAMMED. 30 YEAR YIELDS INCHING CLOSER TO 5%. SURELY THESE ARE SIGNS THAT SOME OF MY OPPOSITION AS THE GOVERNOR WILL BE LOOKING REALLY CLOSELY. YEAH. AGAIN, NOT ENTIRELY WELCOME. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BROADER PHYSICAL PICTURE, THE SITUATION GLOBALLY IS NOT A GOOD ONE. PUBLIC DEBT IS WAY TOO HIGH. WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE KIND OF FISCAL CONSOLIDATION THAT WE NEED TO SEE. COVID WAS ESSENTIAL THING. WE NEEDED TO DO THE FISCAL STUFF AT THAT POINT. WE REALLY NEEDED TO RETRENCH AFTER THAT AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT HAPPENING AS WE SHOULD. YOU HAVE YIELDS GOING UP. IT DOES CREATE VULNERABILITIES THAT WE NEED TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR EMERGING MARKETS IN PARTICULAR WHEN YOU SEE HIGH-YIELD AREA THEY TAKE ACTION, IT WAS ONLY THE BOND VIGILANTES THAT COULD MAKE TRUMP LISTEN. I WOULD ARGUE THE FIRST IMMEDIATE CHANNEL THAT HITS EMERGING MARKETS IN THIS REGION IS LESS ON THE BOND MARKET SIDE. MOST OF OUR ECONOMIES ARE BANK BASED. EVEN IF GLOBAL YIELDS GO UP IN OUR YIELDS GO UP, IT HITS US LESS. THE MAIN CHANNEL THAT HITS US AS THE DOLLAR. WHAT WE SEE WITH THE DOLLAR BECOMING AS WE SEE CURRENCIES IN THE REGION TEND TO APPRECIATE. ONE THING THAT WE NORMALLY WOULD EXPECT AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS WITH THE TARIFF SHOCKS, WE WOULD NORMALLY EXPECT THE TARIFF IMPOSING COUNTRY TO APPRECIATE AND THE CURRENCIES AND THE OTHER REGION TO DEPRECIATE. IT'S GONE THE OTHER WAY AROUND. THAT'S BECAUSE THE EXCHANGE RATE WHICH NORMALLY WE WOULD WANT TO ACT AS A SHOCK ABSORBER, TO NOT PLAY THAT ROLE. I THINK THE APPRECIATION OF THE EXCHANGE RATES HAS EXACERBATED SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES TO THE TARIFF SHOCK. HASLINDA: HOW MUCH APPETITE IS THERE TO MANAGE THAT? THE SOLIDER IS SET TO DEPRECIATE EVEN MORE FROM HERE. THAT'S THE EXCITATION OF THE MARKET AT LEAST. YEAH. I THINK MOST OF THE COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, WE HAVE AN X CHANGE RATE SYSTEM. WE DON'T HAVE A TARGET LEVEL THAT WE SET. WE ALLOW THE EXCHANGE RATE TO MOVE IN LINE WITH FUNDAMENTALS. AGAIN, THE MOVEMENTS HAVE BEEN QUITE MARKED. OUR VOLATILITY HAS GONE UP QUITE A BIT. IT'S ABOUT 8% NOW CLOSE TO THE KOREAN WON. HIGHER VOLATILE CURRENCY IS NOT GOOD FOR US. IN TERMS OF OUR RESPONSE, IT'S BEEN MORE TO MANAGE THE VOLATILITY,. HASLINDA: SOME TALK ABOUT COMPETITIVE DEVALUATION. IF YOU CONTINUE TO SEE A DECLINE FROM HERE, THAT IS SENTIMENTAL TO YOUR ECONOMY AS WELL. LIKE I SAID, A LOT OF THE COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, THERE'S ENOUGH OF US THAT ARE STILL AROUND THAT STILL REMEMBER 1997 ASIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS. A LOT OF US ARE RETIRING LIKE MYSELF. THERE'S STILL A BUNCH OF US AROUND THAT REMEMBER THAT AND RECOGNIZE THE LESSONS AND THE DANGERS OF TRYING TO DO TOO MUCH IN TERMS OF TRYING TO KEEP EXCHANGE RATES AT A CERTAIN LEVEL FOR COMPETITIVE REASONS. HASLINDA: I'VE COVERED THIS REGION FOR A LONG TIME. JUST WHEN THERE ARE SIGNS THAT THE REGION IS PICKING UP AND GROWTH IS INTACT, HERE WE ARE. NOT JUST IN THAILAND OR INDONESIA. WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IN COUNTRIES LIKE INDONESIA AND THAILAND, WE SEE SIGNS OF IT HERE OR ELSEWHERE. IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO LOOK AT THE GROWTH. IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE -- PAY ATTENTION TO ISSUES OF INEQUALITY, OPPORTUNITY. THE RISE OF POPULISM THAT WE SEE IN A LOT OF PLACES REFLECTS THE FACT THAT GROWTH HAS DELIVERED TO PEOPLE. SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY WELL-OFF. I THINK IT'S THAT SENSE OF LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY. IT CREATES A SENSE OF FRUSTRATION. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO. HASLINDA: WHEN YOU EXPECT TARIFFS TO BITE, AND THE REGION IS LOOKING AT TARIFFS, ANYTHING BETWEEN 10 AND 40%. YOU CONNECT SPEC THE REGION TO BE SETTLED. WHAT POLICIES NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD TO ENSURE THAT GROWTH REMAINS INTACT? FOR US IN THAILAND, FAR TOO LONG, EVERY SINGLE GOVERNMENT OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS, THE FOCUS HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON SHORT-TERM STIMULUS. WE USE THE TERM OF A WAKE-UP CALL. WHAT WILL HAPPEN EVENTUALLY AS THEY WILL TAKE A WHILE TO PLAY OUT. THINGS WILL REALIGN. THERE'S AN ACTION AND THERE WILL BE REACTION. WE DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WILL PLAY OUT. 15% OF THE FINAL IMPORT DEMAND. HASLINDA: YOU'VE NEVER NAVIGATED A TURBULENT FIVE-YEAR TERM. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WOULD'VE DONE DIFFERENTLY, ANY DECISION? YES. AGAIN, IN TERMS OF THE BROAD STROKES OF WHAT WE ARE DOING IN TERMS OF THE ADJUSTMENT ON THE MONETARY POLICY FRONT, I THINK BROADLY WE GOT THAT RIGHT. THE RIGHT CALLS AT THE RIGHT TIME. THE BIG CALLS. AGAIN, I'M NOT SAYING EXACTLY EVERY 25 BASIS POINT UP OR DOWN. YOU CAN ALWAYS ARGUE ABOUT WHETHER THAT SHOULD'VE BEEN 25 BASIS POINTS HIGHER OR LOWER. THAT STUFF I TAKE. THE BROADPOINT TOURS OF WHAT WE DID, BRINGING RATES DOWN A LOT DURING COVID, NOT RAISING TO RAPIDLY DURING THE UKRAINE THING, GRADUALLY LOWERING THEM DOWN. PROBABLY THAT WAS RIGHT. MY TAKE AWAY NOW, WE GOT ALL THE STUFF RIGHT. THE ONE THING THAT I AM PROUD OF IS THAT WE DIDN'T JUST PAY ATTENTION TO THE SHORT-TERM STUFF. WE TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PUT IN PLACE THE LONGER-TERM FOUNDATIONAL STUFF. WE DID THINGS ON THE FINANCIAL LANDSCAPE. OPEN INFRASTRUCTURE. OPEN PAYMENTS. OPEN DATA. OPEN COMPETITION. VIRTUAL BANKS. CROSS-BORDER PAYMENTS. THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WE CONTINUE TO DO. THE THING I WOULD'VE DONE DIFFERENTLY, THERE WAS SOME STUFF ON THE LONGER-TERM STRUCTURAL AGENDA WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE A WHOLE LOT HARDER TO DO THEN I HAD THOUGHT. THE LEAD TIME TO DO IT TOOK LONGER THAN I THOUGHT BECAUSE IT WAS A LOT OF PUSHBACK. I WISH I HAD STARTED THAT STUFF SOONER. FOR EXAMPLE, CREDIT GUARANTEES. THAT'S IMPORTANT. WE'VE SEEN THAT. I WORRY ABOUT THAT. WE NEED A WAY TO ADDRESS THE CREDIT RISK ON THAT. WE'VE BEEN PUSHING THIS THING BUT IT PUT -- TOOK LONGER THAN WE EXPECTED. WE SHOULD'VE STARTED THAT SOONER. THE OTHER THING THAT'S IMPORTANT IS OPEN DATA. I THINK THAT'S THE REAL GAME CHANGER. TRYING TO GET THE FLOW OF DATA TO FLOAT AROUND. GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF PUSHBACK AND RESISTANCE WE GOT, I WISH I HAD DONE THIS SOONER. I WISH I HAD HAD THE LEAD TIME TO DO IT AND TAKE US FURTHER ALONG. HASLINDA: CONGRATULATIONS ON",

  "summary": "Thailand's Prime Minister, who has been in office for five years, discusses the country's political and economic situation, highlighting the structural challenges facing the country. He argues that the political and administrative challenges are particularly acute, with a 2% growth rate of 2% compared to what is being seen in other Asian countries. The government is struggling to address these challenges, particularly in the political aspect of the economy. The country's infrastructure is inadequate, with the government's limited ability to adapt to these challenges. Despite this, the chances of a major economic crisis are considered low, but the potential for this is expected to be with us for a long time. The Thai government has been criticized for not adequately addressing these issues, with its focus on a comprehensive, long-term structural reform. The BOT's Sethaput team is also focusing on the future of the country\u2019s economy.",
