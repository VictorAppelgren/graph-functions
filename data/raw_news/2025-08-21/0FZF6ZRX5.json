      "text": "- Hayes says treasury firms must win passive index fund support, warning discounts could trigger broader market risks.\n- Hayes called Trump\u2019s memecoin launch a political watershed, predicting other leaders may adopt tokens for campaign fundraising.\n- See what Wall Street is buying with instant access to ratings on 1,000 top stocks, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and more. Unlock all ratings now.\nArthur Hayes, the former BitMEX co-founder once indicted for Bank Secrecy Act violations, is carving out a new chapter that blends health, finance, and disruption.\nWhat Happened: Pardoned by U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this year, Hayes is now directing both capital and attention toward ventures ranging from stem cell therapy to digital asset treasury companies, according to Bloomberg.\nHayes recently revealed that he has invested heavily in a stem cell enterprise operating clinics in Bangkok and Mexico, where he has been a patient for over a year.\n\"I want to live as long as possible, as healthy as possible,\" Hayes said in a video interview, emphasizing the global momentum for more permissive stem cell regulations.\nHe has since joined the board of the company, which is preparing for a rebrand.\nHis renewed visibility comes after Trump's March pardon cleared charges against Hayes and his BitMEX co-founders Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed, who in 2022 pleaded guilty and each forfeited $10 million in penalties.\nDespite legal hurdles, Hayes remained an influential voice in crypto markets through his widely read essays, one of which inspired Ethena's synthetic dollar, now the world's third-largest stablecoin.\nHayes's family office, Maelstrom, has also been active in backing \"digital asset treasury\" companies, public firms accumulating crypto holdings as a balance sheet strategy.\nAlso Read: Goldman Sachs Projects Stablecoin Market Could Reach Trillions\nThese entities, collectively holding around $110 billion in Bitcoin according to CoinGecko, are emerging as a bridge for institutions seeking exposure through familiar corporate structures.\nYet Hayes's partner at Maelstrom, Akshat Vaidya, warned the frenzy may risk overheating the market.\nHayes himself sees the model's survival hinging on whether these firms can attract passive index fund allocations.\nWhy It Matters: The movement has drawn political endorsements as well.\nTrump Media & Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, raised over $2 billion earlier this year to purchase Bitcoin BTC/USD, while firms aligned with Trump's network, such as Alt5 Sigma Corp., have announced multi-billion-dollar crypto accumulation plans.\nTrump and his family have simultaneously expanded into crypto mining and meme coins, even launching personal tokens that soared on social media hype before sharp reversals.\nTo Hayes, the participation of politicians marks a turning point.\n\"If you have the president of the empire creating his own memecoin and it's freely tradable, I think that gives license to other politicians to use meme coins as a way to do campaign finance,\" he said.\nHayes dismissed volatility as irrelevant, instead framing Trump's token experiment as validation of a new crypto-driven political and financial era.\nAs longevity research, speculative tokens, and corporate crypto treasuries converge, Hayes represents a generation of crypto pioneers testing the limits of both capital and regulation in industries once thought untouchable.\nRead Next:\nImage: Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Details here \u2192\nBitcoin's BTC/USD recent pullback signals the digital asset is maturing into a more stable market, according to Anthony Pompliano, founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management.\nWhat Happened: \"What I think we're watching is a market that's maturing, institutions are coming in, it's getting bigger. And so what you're starting to see is kind of muted volatility,\" Pompliano told CNBC on Thursday.\n\"And that means that people who are hoping Bitcoin is gonna go to $400,000, $500,000 in a bull market, this cycle is probably not gonna happen. But also people who think that you're gonna get\u2026 85, 90% drawdowns in the bear markets, that's probably not gonna happen either.\"\nPompliano noted that Bitcoin's drawdowns in this cycle have been around 10\u201315%, compared with the 30% pullbacks seen in earlier bull markets.\nHe said the changing composition of Bitcoin holders, from retail traders to institutions and ETFs, is helping dampen volatility and establishing Bitcoin as a more durable asset.\n\"Bitcoin has gone from a contrarian trade to consensus trade,\" he said. \"In order to do that, you need it to become less volatile.\"\nHe added that institutional investors and public companies are less likely to panic sell, unlike retail traders driven by \"fear and greed.\"\nThis, he argued, represents a \"natural and good sign for Bitcoin in the long run.\"\nAlso Read: Trump\u2019s Pardon Frees Arthur Hayes To Pursue Stem Cell Enterprises And Bitcoin Treasuries\nWhat\u2019s Next: Looking ahead, Pompliano said Bitcoin's current price levels near $112,000\u2013$113,000 appear \"pretty oversold,\" with seasonality and potential Fed policy shifts possibly fueling a rebound in September and October.\n\"Starting in September, we should see Bitcoin kind of come back alive again,\" he said.\nOn the long-term outlook, Pompliano maintained confidence in Bitcoin reaching $1 million but cautioned that it is unlikely to occur this cycle. \"Bitcoin will definitely go to a million at some point in the future,\" he said. \"I just think this cycle, it's very unlikely.\"\nWhile acknowledging that some investors are rotating into Ethereum ETH/USD or stablecoin businesses like Circle CRCL, Pompliano reiterated his stance that \"Bitcoin is the king. It's been the king. It's going to remain the king.\"\nHe also flagged that some large holders are shifting into ETFs for security reasons, but predicted most in the community will continue to prioritize self-custody, adhering to the principle of \"not your keys, not your coins.\"\nRead Next:\nImage: Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

That shift won't happen overnight, but the writing is on the wall.\"\nChen emphasized that markets should prepare for this transition with multi-currency settlement systems, robust hedging tools, and regulatory frameworks that enable global participation.\nStablecoins, she added, will remain central to the shift by serving as \"the connective tissue between RWAs, DeFi, and traditional markets.\"\nShe described regulatory clarity as the biggest obstacle to widespread adoption, noting that institutions remain hesitant without firm rules on securities classification and cross-border compliance.\n\"Custody and interoperability also remain pain points,\" she said, pointing to the challenge of safely holding tokenized assets and enabling seamless transfers across different blockchains.\nLiquidity, she added, must deepen before RWAs can scale meaningfully.\nDespite hurdles, Chen argued that RWAs are the \"logical next step\" after stablecoins in bridging traditional and decentralized finance.\n\"Imagine unlocking trillions in illiquid assets\u2014real estate, private credit, even art\u2014and making them tradable, composable, and accessible through DeFi. That's not just a new product set\u2014it's an entirely new market structure.\"\nAlso Read: Buckle Up Dollar Bulls, China Is Reportedly Considering Its Own Yuan-Linked Stablecoins\nWhy It Matters: Her comments come as Bitget announced the launch of the world's first RWA Index Perpetual Contracts.\nThe contracts, set to go live on Aug. 20, will allow users to trade tokenized traditional assets such as TSLAUSDT (RWA), NVDAUSDT (RWA), and CRCLUSDT (RWA), tokenized versions of Tesla TSLA, Nvidia NVDA and Circle CRCL stock.\nBitget said the indices will aggregate pricing data from multiple token issuers to ensure fair and flexible pricing.\n\"These contracts bridge the gap between TradFi and DeFi by giving traders exposure to tokenized stocks in a familiar perpetual format,\" Chen said.\nAt launch, pricing will draw from issuers on the xStocks platform, with additional providers expected later this quarter. Leverage will be capped at 10x and only isolated margin mode supported to mitigate early-stage risks.\nFor Chen, success in RWAs will hinge on both credibility and usability. \"When big names like BlackRock enter tokenization, credibility rises\u2014but so does competition,\" she said.\n\"Differentiation will come from radical transparency, bulletproof compliance, and seamless user experience. Whoever makes RWA access as easy as buying Bitcoin will win,\u201d Chen said.\nRead Next:\nImage: Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
