There is a young man who's 17 years old who is on the ledge wanting to jump, but before he jumps he wants to talk to me,\" Winkler recalled to Fox News Digital on the Televerse red carpet.WATCH: \u2018HAZARDOUS HISTORY\u2019 HOST HENRY WINKLER SHARES THE WILDEST HAZARD HE EVER FACED ON SET \"Where I got the nerve to talk to this guy, I don't know.

I think of myself as a grateful guy,\" he said. \"My gratitude allows the journey \u2014 with all the bumps and the bruises and all of the success \u2014 to equal out.\"As for meeting his idols, Winkler recalled the moment he met fellow Hollywood actor Robert De Niro.

      "text": "When Marlee Matlin ended her tumultuous relationship with William Hurt, she leaned on her mentor, Henry Winkler, for support.\nThe Oscar winner is detailing her rise to Hollywood stardom in a new documentary, \"Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore.\"\nAccording to the film, Matlin turned to the \"Happy Days\" star after she ended her relationship with actor William Hurt. In the documentary, Matlin claimed that her \"Children of a Lesser God\" co-star had a \"habit of abuse.\" Hurt died in 2022 at age 71.\nHENRY WINKLER'S DAUGHTER SHARES THE TRUTH ABOUT GROWING UP WITH 'HAPPY DAYS' STAR AS HER DAD\nThe 59-year-old, who is deaf, told Fox News Digital through an interpreter that turning to Winkler during a difficult time in her life was a no-brainer.\n\"He didn\u2019t make it hard for me to reach out to him,\" said Matlin. \"He was always available. It was like an open door \u2013 an open door to his heart and my heart. And he knew that.\"\n\"He knows that he\u2019s done that to a lot of people,\" she shared. \"But to have that close relationship, I was just very, very fortunate. And I knew that both he and his wife were gold to me. I don\u2019t think if I had Henry in my life, I would be here. I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve made it this far. I don\u2019t think so.\"\nHurt and Matlin starred in the 1986 film about a deaf woman\u2019s romance with a hearing-speech teacher. Matlin was 19 when she was cast opposite Hurt, 35.\nWhile the relationship was plagued with problems, Matlin did credit Hurt for inspiring her to check into the Betty Ford Center after using up every bit of cocaine and marijuana she had in their New York City apartment.\nHowever, post-rehab, Matlin realized their relationship would not be the same.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\"I walked out of that house and never went back,\" she said in the film.\nWinkler encouraged a sober Matlin to visit him and his wife Stacey Weitzman at their California home. There, they could \"talk.\" Matlin took up his offer.\nThe actor, who catapulted to fame as \"The Fonz,\" described Matlin knocking on his door.\nWATCH: 'HAPPY DAYS' STAR HENRY WINKLER SHARES HIS FONDEST MEMORY FROM THE SHOW\n\"\u2019I just broke up with my boyfriend,\u2019\" Winkler recalled Matlin telling him in the film. \"\u2019Can I stay with you just for the weekend?\u2019 \u2018Sure. Stace, what do you think?\u2019 \u2018Of course.\u2019\"\n\"Two years later, she finally moved out!\" Winkler chuckled.\nMatlin said Winkler and his family took her in \"as if I were one of their own.\"\nWinkler noted that Matlin was not \"completely whole at that time.\"\n\"What I told her was, \u2018If you know what you want without ambivalence, if you\u2019re clear about what you want, everything else will fall into place,'\" he said in the film.\nNot only did Matlin begin to heal, but she also found true love. In 1993, she married Kevin Grandalski, a police officer, at Winkler\u2019s home.\nLIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\"You just knew,\" said Winkler in the film about the romance. \"This is different. This is where a home is made. [And] there was no other thing to do, there was no other place for her to get married, except in our yard, in her home away from home.\"\nWinkler first saw a 12-year-old Matlin on stage in a Chicago variety show. In the documentary, Winkler recalled how Matlin\u2019s mother took him aside and asked if he could warn her daughter from pursuing an acting career because it would be too difficult for her. Winkler replied, \"You got the wrong guy.\"\nWinkler became a friend and mentor to the then-aspiring actress. Their friendship has lasted for decades.\n\"I think anyone who has that kind of mentor would understand and appreciate how important he was to me,\" Matlin explained for Fox News Digital.\n\"He provided a place for me to feel safe,\" she said. \"I could always depend on the fact that he was a person who believed in me, genuinely, believed, and helped build my own self-confidence and trust the fact that he allowed me to be open and see the world more clearly. I'm so fortunate\u2026 that I was one of the people that he really cares about, truly cares about, genuinely cares about.\"\n\"He was probably one of the most famous people in the world at times,\" Matlin beamed. \"He was more famous than the President, in my opinion, and one of the most beloved people in the world. So, who would've ever thought that he would take the time and give attention to someone like me, the little girl that I was when he met me, the little deaf girl when he didn't even know American sign language?\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"He didn't know anything about being deaf, about deaf culture,\" Matlin continued. \"But you know what? It didn't matter to him. He acknowledged, of course, yes, that I communicated. He didn't ignore the fact that I was deaf, but at the same time, he treated me with love and respect, as anyone should to anyone. And I grabbed that moment when we first met, knowing that he was the real deal.\"\nWinkler, 79, said in a statement sent to Fox News Digital, \"When we first saw her at age 12, it was evident how powerful and talented she was. She will always be part of our lives.\"\nMatlin is the youngest and first deaf best actress Academy Award winner. Her memoir, \"I'll Scream Later,\" was published in 2009. In it, the actress said she was molested as a child and alleged abuse from Hurt during their relationship.\n\"I didn't know that you could ask for help,\" Matlin told Fox News Digital. \"I didn't know that while screaming for help, I didn't know that I could go out and seek out help, as opposed to while it was happening\u2026 hoping that somebody would come. But no one did while I was screaming. No one did\u2026 I don't want to dwell on that, but that's what happened.\"\nFollowing the book\u2019s publication, Hurt issued a statement to Access that read, \"My own recollection is that we both apologized, and both did a great deal to heal our lives. Of course, I did, and do apologize for any pain I caused. And I know we both have grown. I wish Marlee and her family nothing but good.\"\nThe documentary\u2019s director, Shoshannah Stern, who is also deaf, told Fox News Digital through an interpreter that she admired Matlin\u2019s bravery in speaking before the #MeToo movement.\n\"Everyone had so much doubt,\" said Stern. \"And then asking Marlee, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you leave?\u2019 \u2018Why did you stay in that relationship?\u2019 I just felt that they just re-traumatized her\u2026 The questions that they asked made it worse, asking, \u2018Did you think that those events happened to you because you were deaf?\u2019 And Marlee continuing to say, \u2018I didn\u2019t know.\u2019\u2026 And people just overlooking that comment over and over, not understanding what she meant and her strength.\"\n\"She didn\u2019t know that abuse was abuse at the time,\" said Stern. \"And that\u2019s what happens to so many deaf people in the world.\"\nThe work continues for Matlin, along with telling her story.\n\"I was determined to prove [my critics wrong],\" Matlin told Fox News Digital about pursuing a Hollywood career. \"It just made me want to roll up my sleeves, even more, to prove to them that I\u2019m a deaf woman who loves acting as much as anybody else\u2026 I didn\u2019t get into this business for nothing. It was a dream come true. So why shouldn't I be able to do another film?\"\n\"But if it happened today, I would\u2019ve made a lot of noise back then,\" Matlin reflected. \"I didn\u2019t know how to speak out against those who\u2026 wanted to put me in a negative light\u2026 As a result of all those criticisms, I had to grow up so quickly.\n\"I was 19 years old when I got into [\u2018Children of a Lesser God\u2019], I turned 20 during the making of the film, and I had a much older boyfriend. It was my first film, and I was trying to get sober, and everything was coming at once. And they were more interested in pulling me down than all the other things that I was going through.\"\n\"Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore\" premieres June 20."

We're having so much fun hanging, and this is sort of our great excuse to come together, so thank you.\"\nThe foursome starred on the popular family-friendly sitcom together from 1974 to 1984, except for Howard, who left the show in 1980 after its seventh season.

Everybody respected each other. Then, he created a softball team, and we played every Sunday. Then we traveled all over the country. Then we traveled all over the world.\"\nIn a separate Instagram post shared on the events page, the four men can be seen posing for photos while holding a certificate. The caption explained the certificates signify the declaration by the President of Allegheny County Council that April 5 will now be known as Happy Days Day in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\nWinkler and Howard previously reunited on stage at the 2024 Emmy Awards, to honor the 50th anniversary of \"Happy Days.\" The pair walked out onto the stage, which was recreated to look like the set of Arnold\u2019s Drive-In."
