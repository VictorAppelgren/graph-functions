      "text": "Zero Day marks the second political thriller series that has earned Lesli Linka Glatter an Emmy nom for best directing.\n\u201cI always try to mix it up,\u201d the nine-time Emmy nominee (seven of which she earned for Homeland) says of the Netflix limited series that stars Robert De Niro as a former U.S. president tasked with investigating a catastrophic cyberattack.\nHere, the president of the DGA, which was involved in the recent passage of AB 1138 \u2014 a new law that bumps California\u2019s film and television tax credit up to 35 percent \u2014 shares her hope that her new project, a TV adaptation of Araminta Hall\u2019s 2020 novel, Imperfect Women, leads by example.\nRelated Stories\nThe Zero Day script came to you with De Niro attached. What does it take for you to say yes to a script these days?\nI don\u2019t want to be telling the same story over and over or in the same genre; hence doing things like Now and Then and the pilot of the Gilmore Girls and Homeland or Mad Men or Zero Day. [When] the pilot was sent to me, I read it and thought, \u201cOh my God.\u201d If I start to read something and I start to see it and feel it and taste it, I know I\u2019m the right person to direct it. I often read things that are really, really good, but I\u2019m not the right person. I don\u2019t feel that thing in my heart and my gut that tells me this is the one. I rely on those instincts.\nYou\u2019re now doing Apple TV+\u2019s Imperfect Women. Where are you in the process?\nI\u2019m working very closely with the writer and showrunner, Annie Weisman. The book is based in England, [but the series] is based in L.A. Annie has very skillfully taken so much of the core of the book, but translated it a different way. We have a great cast: Kerry Washington, Elisabeth Moss, Kate Mara, Joel Kinnaman and Leslie Odom Jr. It\u2019s about women\u2019s friendship, and of course there\u2019s a crime involved and it\u2019s very juicy and doesn\u2019t go where you think it\u2019s going to go. I\u2019m very fortunate to be filming in L.A. now. We have to keep our industry alive. Storytelling is so important, and I think right now it\u2019s even more important. And it\u2019s a huge business. We want to be sure that we don\u2019t let that go away.\nBefore Zero Day, you were working on another political thriller, The Banker\u2019s Wife, until it got scrapped because of the pandemic. Could it get picked back up?\nIt was supposed to shoot in six different countries, then COVID happened. I literally was packed to go to Budapest for I don\u2019t know how long, since I was directing all eight hours. Sadly, it was one of the really good projects because it was such a big, international thriller, and it just went by the wayside. Maybe it will [be revived]. You never know if something is interesting material and a world we haven\u2019t really seen. I think there\u2019s lots of merit to it. I\u2019m developing a lot of different projects with my writing partner because I love that process. We\u2019re so fortunate to be doing this crazy job in this crazy way and collaborating with a huge group of people. Moving an army to make things happen is kind of what we directors do.\nThis story first appeared in an August stand-alone issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

      "text": "Pity the Emmy voters this year, at least those tasked with casting a ballot for the live variety special.\nForget past winner nostalgia trips from Elton John or Archie Bunker (and apologies to fellow 2025 nominees like Saturday Night Live and the Oscars). The real showdown we\u2019ve been waiting for is between two cultural icons who delivered some of the most lauded and groundbreaking live performances of the decade: Kendrick Lamar\u2018s zeitgeist-slapping Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show versus Netflix\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9 Bowl Christmas Day spectacular.\nRelated Stories\nThe former felt like a bullet fired into the heart of the culture, the latter like a perfectly cut diamond reflecting decades of influence. And each, in their own way, was notably political, Lamar landing blows about racial inequity, and Beyonc\u00e9, by steeping her show in tradition, reclaiming country as a Black musical expression in an age when some of its biggest white stars have weaponized it on behalf of MAGA. At a moment when entertainers are being marginalized or told, once again, to shut up and sing, this duo, on the nation\u2019s biggest stages, resisted. They absolutely did sing, but they did anything but shut up.\nFor critical darling Lamar, 2024 was arguably the biggest year of his 15-year career. The Compton native\u2019s ability to mine his own history and street cred, lace it with humor both rich and dark, and synthesize it into next-level storytelling had already cemented his GOAT status among fans \u2014 not to mention, of course, the leveling up on his feud with Drake upon the release of \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d\nBy the time Lamar took the stage for the Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show in February, the track had peaked at No. 1 on Spotify in 10 countries and swept the Grammys. With the beef so widely known that both your parents and your kids had heard about it, Lamar could have simply taken a victory lap at the Superdome, where he was headlining the game\u2019s first-ever solo rap halftime show. Instead, the Pulitzer winner delivered a rapid-fire, career-spanning set wrapped in a video game motif that doubled as cultural commentary. Two narratives emerged: one broad, about a politically divided America (the game followed the Trump inauguration by just a few weeks), and one personal, aimed squarely at the Drake feud in a performance that made it clear for his rival that it was Game Over.\nFrom a stage shaped like PlayStation controller buttons, dancers in red, white and blue formed an American flag with their backs turned to one another. Samuel L. Jackson\u2019s Uncle Sam heckled him (\u201cToo loud, too reckless, too ghetto!\u201d); Lamar dueted with frequent collaborator SZA; and Serena Williams, a fellow Compton native, made a cameo, Crip Walking across the turf.\nThe Super Bowl halftime show hasn\u2019t always been fluff \u2014 Prince and Bruce Springsteen performed it during the 2000s, and of course there was the national reckoning over TV standards after Nipplegate in 2004 \u2014 but too often it has been hypey and unserious, dating back to when pop music entered the stadiums in the \u201980s and early \u201990s. And until this year, politics had never entered the fray.\nBut at a tense moment for the country following the inauguration, Lamar elevated the halftime show without sacrificing his artistry, letting flashes of Compton and barbed political commentary onto one of the world\u2019s biggest stages. He even teased the lawsuit-spurring \u201cNot Like Us\u201d lyric that alleged Drake was a pedophile. In just 13 minutes, Lamar made the halftime show feel alive, relevant and urgent in a way it hasn\u2019t in years.\nPerhaps the last artist to truly dazzle on that stage? Beyonc\u00e9, who shook the Super Bowl in 2013. Halftime spectacles are her thing now, and with Netflix, she created an event of her own: the NFL\u2019s 2024 Christmas Day Halftime Show, instantly branded as Beyonc\u00e9 Bowl.\nShot with the precision of a Super Bowl broadcast and the gloss of a prestige concert film, the performance transformed Houston\u2019s NRG Stadium into a runway, a dance floor and a pulpit for Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s genre-hopping career. Opening with her entrance in a gleaming white ensemble, the set offered a tight 14-track tour through her Grammy-winning Cowboy Carter, interwoven with earlier hits like \u201cBreak My Soul\u201d from Renaissance and the ubiquitous \u201cFreedom\u201d from Lemonade \u2014 made even more omnipresent months earlier by Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign playlist.\nEver since her headlining set at Coachella 2018, Beyonc\u00e9 has been synonymous with next-level stagecraft. In Houston, those expectations \u2014 plus the feat of launching a new halftime tradition for the world\u2019s biggest streamer \u2014 were met with ease and precision. Her croon of Cowboy Carter\u2018s \u201c16 Carriages\u201d atop a horse gave way to a soaring five-woman rendition of The Beatles\u2019 \u201cBlackbird.\u201d Soon, she was flanked by two massive brass bands and an army of dancers, as the intimacy exploded into a pyrotechnic spectacle. It was a dazzling ode to country, rodeo and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Texas roots, balancing reverence and reinvention (e.g., a cover of Dolly Parton\u2019s \u201cJolene\u201d), with guests including Shaboozey and Post Malone. The special was hailed as \u201cthe future of concert streaming,\u201d and it\u2019s easy to see why.\nAnd so the Emmy race boils down to this: the verve of the present tense in Lamar\u2019s politically charged, rivalry-infused halftime takeover, or Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s lush, meticulously crafted homage to the past, both the country\u2019s and her own.\nFor voters, the choice is one of the year\u2019s toughest calls. And it makes one thing clear: These performers are not like us, or pretty much anyone else who came before.\nThis story first appeared in an August stand-alone issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

      "text": "Throwing a big bash for the Fourth of July and need a themed playlist?\nThe Hollywood Reporter has rounded up a list of songs about the good ole U.S.A., from Woody Guthrie\u2019s \u201cThis Land Is Your Land\u201d to Lee Greenwood\u2019s \u201cGod Bless the USA.\u201d\nHowever, not all of them are exactly patriotic or positive in their view of America and its citizens. Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u201cBorn in the U.S.A.\u201d is often misunderstood as a nationalistic anthem (it actually was intended to draw attention to the negative effects of the Vietnam War), while Green Day\u2019s \u201cAmerican Idiot\u201d is a criticism of the American media.\nRead on for more, and click here to see a list of Hollywood\u2019s most patriotic movies.\nThis list was originally published in 2015.\n-\n\u2018God Bless the USA\u2019\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m proud to be an American/ Where at least I know I\u2019m free/ And I won\u2019t forget the men who died/ Who gave that right to me/ And I gladly stand up/ Next to you and defend her still today/ \u2018Cause there ain\u2019t no doubt I love this land/ God bless the USA\u201d\nPerhaps the most patriotic song on this list, \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d is a staple at fireworks shows on the Fourth of July. It also continues to be performed by Lee Greenwood himself on a national level at various events, including at the 2017 and 2025 presidential inaugurations of Donald Trump, the Republican National Convention and various Trump rallies.\nTrump and Greenwood also have become friends, with the two teaming up to sell the \u201cGod Bless the USA Bible\u201d last year.\n-\n\u2018Back in the U.S.A.\u2019\n\u201cWhere hamburgers sizzle on an open grill night and day/ Yeah, and a juke-box jumping with records like in the U.S.A.\u201d\nThe song\u2019s lyrics were reportedly based on Chuck Berry\u2019s return to America following a trip to Australia, where he witnessed the poor living standards of Australian Aborigines.\n-\n\u2018Surfin U.S.A\u2019\n\u201cYou\u2019d see \u2019em wearing their baggies/ Huarachi sandals too/ A bushy bushy blonde hairdo/ Surfin\u2018 U. S. A.\u201d\nThe summer song makes reference to multiple American surf spots, including Del Mar, Swami\u2019s and Trestles. Interestingly, only one member of The Beach Boys, Dennis Wilson, actually surfed.\n-\n\u2018This Land Is Your Land\u2019\n\u201cFrom California, to the New York Island/ From the Redwood forest, to the Gulf Stream waters/ This land was made for you and me\u201d\nWoody Guthrie wrote the song to combat what he believed to be an unrealistic and overly romanticized interpretation of the United States in Irving Berlin\u2019s \u201cGod Bless America.\u201d\n-\n\u2018America\u2019\n\u201cSo we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner pies/ And we walked off to look for America\u201d\nSimon & Garfunkel\u2019s song describes the cross-country trip of two hitchhikers, whose initial hope gives way to sadness as they attempt to find \u201cthemselves\u201d as they discover the country. The \u201cKathy\u201d referred to in the song was Kathy Chitty, Paul Simon\u2019s onetime love-interest.\n-\n\u2018American Woman\u2019\n\u201cAmerican woman, get away from me/ American woman, mama, let me be\u201d\nThe Guess Who song was conceived from a live jam during a Kitchener, Ontario, concert with the studio recording featuring the original improvised lyrics in their entirety. Though the song often is thought of as anti-American and chauvinistic, Jim Kale, the group\u2019s bassist, has said: \u201cThe popular misconception was that it was a chauvinistic tune, which was anything but the case. The fact was, we came from a very strait-laced, conservative, laid-back country, and all of a sudden, there we were in Chicago, Detroit, New York \u2014 all these horrendously large places with their big city problems. After that one particularly grinding tour, it was just a real treat to go home and see the girls we had grown up with. Also, the war was going on, and that was terribly unpopular. We didn\u2019t have a draft system in Canada, and we were grateful for that. A lot of people called in anti-American, but it wasn\u2019t really. We weren\u2019t anti-anything. John Lennon once said that the meanings of all songs come after they are recorded. Someone else has to interpret them.\u201d\nLenny Kravitz famously covered the song for the Mike Myers film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.\n-\n\u2018Born in the U.S.A.\u2019\n\u201cI was born in the U.S.A., born in the U.S.A./ Got in a little hometown jam/ So they put a rifle in my hand\u201d\nThough it is often misunderstood as a nationalistic anthem, Bruce Springsteen intended the song to call attention to the negative effects of the Vietnam War and how veterans were treated after they returned home.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if anybody could imagine what [Vietnam War veterans\u2019] particular experience is like,\u201d Springsteen told Rolling Stone in 1984. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could, you know? I think you had to live through it. But when you think about all the young men and women that died in Vietnam, and how many died since they\u2019ve been back \u2014 surviving the war and coming back and not surviving \u2014 you have to think that, at the time, the country took advantage of their selflessness. There was a moment when they were just really generous with their lives.\u201d\nThe song ranked 275th on the Rolling Stone\u2019s \u201c500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\u201d\n-\n\u2018American Girl\u2019\n\u201cWell, she was an American girl/ Raised on promises/ She couldn\u2019t help thinkin\u2018/ That there was a little more to life somewhere else\u201d\nThe song was rumored to be written about a girl who died by suicide after jumping from a residence hall at the University of Florida in Gainesville, where Tom Petty grew up. The singer rebuffed those allegations.\n-\n\u2018American Pie\u2019\n\u201cWe were singin\u2018 bye-bye, Miss American Pie/ Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry.\u201d\nThis song is best known for its cryptic lyrics that have led to much speculation and a slew of interpretations. It is believed to be about the late singer Buddy Holly, who died in a plane crash and to whom Don McLean dedicated his American Pie album.\n-\n\u2018Kids in America\u2019\n\u201cNew York to East California. /There\u2019s a new wave coming I warn you. /We\u2019re the kids in America.\u201d\nThough the song says different, Kim Wilde was not actually a kid in America. She grew up in west London, the daughter of rocker Marty Wilde, who wrote the song with son Ricky.\n\u201cMy dad\u2019s head went into a fantasy, this idea of everything being better in America,\u201d Kim once said of the meaning behind the tune. \u201cOf course for his generation, that was very true. Everyone was going to drive in movies and drinking milkshakes and having hamburgers in America. We weren\u2019t doing things like that in the U.K. I think a lot of that got caught up in the lyrics \u2014 all the kids in America are having a better, more interesting, more dangerous time than we were here.\u201d\n-\n\u2018Fortunate Son\u2019\n\u201cSome folks are born made to wave the flag/ Ooh, they\u2019re red, white and blue/ And when the band plays \u2018Hail to the chief\u2019/ Ooh, they point the cannon at you, Lord\u201d\nCreedence Clearwater Revival lead singer John Fogerty told Rolling Stone that the song was inspired by David Eisenhower, grandson of President Eisenhower, and Julie Nixon, the daughter of President Nixon, saying, \u201cyou just had the feeling that none of these people were going to be involved with the [Vietnam] war.\u201d\n-\n\u2018American Idiot\u2019\n\u201cDon\u2019t wanna be an American idiot./ Don\u2019t want a nation under the new media.\u201d\nThe song title is a pretty good giveaway that this isn\u2019t a rousing patriotic anthem. With its scathing criticism of the American media and national values, Green Day lead vocalist Billy Joe Armstrong never intended the song to be another \u201cAmerica the Beautiful.\u201d Armstrong was inspired to write \u201cAmerican Idiot\u201d after hearing the Lynyrd Skynyrd song \u201cThat\u2019s How I Like It\u201d on his car radio and strongly disagreeing with its pro-redneck sentimentalities.\n-\n\u2018Jack & Diane\u2019\n\u201cLittle ditty about Jack and Diane/ Two American kids growin\u2018 up in the heartland\u201d\nAccording to John Mellencamp (then performing as John Cougar), \u201cJack & Diane\u201d was written about a relationship he had with a girl who lived near his hometown of Seymour, Indiana.\n-\n\u2018Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue\u2019\n\u201cMan, it\u2019s gonna be hell/ When you hear Mother Freedom/ Start ringin\u2019 her bell\u201d\nToby Keith\u2019s father\u2019s death in a car accident and the tragedy of the 9/11 terrorist attacks prompted Keith to write a song about his father\u2019s faith in the United States. Keith initially refused to record the song and only sang it live at his concerts for military personnel.\nKeith would go on to write another patriotic song about his father, 2011\u2019s \u201cMade in America.\u201d\n-\n\u2018White America\u2019\n\u201cCountry of ours, the stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect/ The women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech the United States\u201d\nEminem wrote the song to combat allegations from parents and politicians, including Second Ladies Lynne Cheney and Tipper Gore, that he had influenced criminal behavior in young white Americans.\n-\n\u2018Party in the U.S.A.\u2019\n\u201cSo I put my hands up/ They\u2019re playin\u2018 my song/ I know I\u2019m gonna be OK/ Yeah, it\u2019s a party in the U.S.A.\u201d\nMiley Cyrus has stated that she feels that the song does not properly reflect her musical capabilities and background, citing that when the song was recorded, she had never actually listened to a Jay-Z song \u2014 an artist who is referenced in the lyrics. Still, it\u2019s become a Fourth of July staple.\n-\n\u2018Made in America\u2019\n\u201cI pledge allegiance to my Grandma/ For that banana pudding, our piece of Americana/ Our apple pie was supplied through Arm and Hammer\u201d\nOff of Jay-Z and Kanye West\u2019s Watch the Throne album, the inspirational ballad deals with themes of family, childhood and the American Dream. R&B singer Frank Ocean wrote the vocals for the track.\n-\n\u2018Pink Houses\u2019\n\u201cOh, but ain\u2019t that America/ For you and me/ Ain\u2019t that America/ Something to see, baby/ Ain\u2019t that America /Home of the free, yeah/ Little pink houses/ For you and me.\u201d\nJohn Mellencamp (then performing as John Cougar Mellencamp) has said the song is actually a critique on American life, not a celebration. The chorus (above) is meant to be sarcastic.\n\u201cThis one has been misconstrued over the years because of the chorus \u2014 it sounds very rah-rah. But it\u2019s really an anti-American song,\u201d Mellencamp has said. \u201cThe American Dream had pretty much proven itself as not working anymore. It was another way for me to sneak something in.\u201d\n-\n\u2018Independence Day\u2019\n\u201cLet freedom ring, let the white dove sing/ Let the whole world know that today/ Is a day of reckoning/ Let the weak be strong, let the right be wrong/ Roll the stone away, let the guilty pay/ It\u2019s Independence Day\u201d\nIt sounds like a patriotic anthem, but it\u2019s more of an empowering message of how an a woman escaped her abusive husband after setting her house on fire \u2014 thereby getting her own \u201cindependence day.\u201d However, after it was released, many folks didn\u2019t get the meaning of the song.\n\u201cSome people just don\u2019t understand what the song is about at all,\u201d singer Martina McBride has said.\nHowever, the song has had an impact on victims of domestic violence. \u201cI started getting all these letters \u2014 handwritten letters, back in the day \u2014 from women saying, \u2018This is my song,\u2019\u201d McBride said. \u201cI got a few letters that said, \u2019I heard this song on the radio, I\u2019ve been battered for 10 years, and I left. This was the thing that made me realize that it\u2019s not my fault, that I need to make a change.\u2019\u201d\n-\n\u2018The Star Spangled Banner\u2019\n\u201cAnd the rocket\u2019s red glare, the bombs bursting in air/ Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there/ O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave/ O\u2019er the land of the free and the home of the brave?\u201d\nFrancis Scott Key\u2019s tune is, for obvious reasons, as patriotic as you can get. America\u2019s National Anthem has been sung by scores and scores and scores of famous faces at sporting events, military celebrations, graduations and much more.\nBut the most famous rendition might belong to Whitney Houston, who performed it in January 1991 \u2014 just days after the Persian Gulf War started \u2014 at Super Bowl XXV in Tampa, Florida. Due to public demand, Arista Records then released a single of her performance, with proceeds donated to the American Red Cross Gulf Crisis Fund.\nHouston said of her performance at the Super Bowl: \u201cIf you were there, you could feel the intensity. You know, we were in the Gulf War at the time. It was an intense time for a country. A lot of our daughters and sons were overseas fighting. I could see, in the stadium, I could see the fear, the hope, the intensity, the prayers going up, you know, and I just felt like this is the moment. And it was hope, we needed hope, you know, to bring our babies home and that\u2019s what it was about for me, that what I felt when I sang that song, and the overwhelming love coming out of the stands was incredible.\u201d\nAfter the September 11 attacks, Arista rereleased the song, with proceeds donated to firefighters and victims of the terrorist attacks.\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day"

      "text": "MTV VMAs: 27 of the Awards Show\u2019s Wildest Moments of All Time\nFrom Kanye West's infamous stage crash to Madonna locking lips with Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, THR looks back at the most memorable moments from the show's three-decade history.\nThe MTV Video Music Awards are never without over-the-top performances and buzzworthy moments, and this year\u2019s show is sure to be no different.\nThe awards show debuted in 1984 with one of the most memorable moments of all time: Madonna\u2019s performance of \u201cLike a Virgin\u201d (see below). Since then, artists from Kanye West to Miley Cyrus have created their own watercooler moments that have given the VMAs a reputation for being a tad bit crazier than your typical awards show.\nThis year, the VMAs will air for the first time on CBS (it\u2019ll also be simulcast on MTV and stream on Paramount+). What new celebrity antics might we see come Sept. 7? Only time will tell, but in the meantime, take a look below at 27 of the most memorable moments over the past three decades (interestingly, many artists pop up more than once here; we\u2019re looking at you, Miley and Britney).\n-\nMadonna performs \u201cLike a Virgin\u201d in a wedding dress (1984)\nThe singer, who was nominated for best new artist for her \u201cBorderline\u201d video, hit the stage in a wedding dress and garters, along with a belt featuring a buckle that read \u201cBOY TOY,\u201d to perform \u201cLike a Virgin.\u201d She began her performance atop a giant three-tiered wedding cake before making her way down the floor, where she ended the song writhing on the floor. \u201cI think we all know she had a few drinks, because she had to get up the nerve to crawl around like she did,\u201d Les Garland, former executive vp programming at MTV, told Billboard in 2014. \u201cShe stole the show.\u201d\n-\nPee-Wee Herman makes comeback after indecent-exposure arrest (1991)\nPaul Reubens, best known for his Pee-Wee Herman character, was arrested in 1991 in an adult movie theater in Florida for indecent exposure. Many thought his career was over, especially given he was best known for a character who was currently the star of a kids show. After the news broke, CBS pulled the remaining reruns of Pee-Wee\u2019s Playhouse from its schedule, and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us removed all Pee-wee toys from its shelves. Despite public support from celebrity pals including Cyndi Lauper and Joan Rivers, Reubens laid low until that year\u2019s VMAs, where he was met with thunderous applause when he opened the show with a joke: \u201cHeard any good jokes lately?\u201d\n-\nPrince gives a cheeky performance (1991)\nPrince took the stage to perform \u201cGett Off\u201d in pants that were designed to seemingly show off his butt cheeks. However, years later, Stacia Lang, who served as Prince\u2019s costume designer from 1990-93, told CNN that it was more of an illusion than viewers might have thought. Lang said that she used a thin, net-like fabric known as marquisette to make it appear like he was exposing his derri\u00e8re. \u201cThere was a beautiful, white, pure, really heavy French lace that we took right away to the dyers and had that dyed bright citron yellow,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd also (the dyer) had to dye up several fabrics that would create the illusion that his rear end was showing.\u201d\n-\nMichael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley make out (1994)\nThen-newlyweds Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley were facing skepticism about the authenticity of their marriage. They opened the show with their first public appearance as a couple. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to be here,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cAnd just think, nobody thought this would last,\u201d he added, nodding his head toward Presley, before taking off his sunglasses and kissing her onstage.\n\u201cHe knew I didn\u2019t love that,\u201d Presley told Oprah Winfrey in 2010, the year after Jackson died. \u201cI would be there, uncomfortably. And his hand was blue after we got off that stage. \u2026 I had squeezed it so hard. \u2026 But as his wife, I needed to do some things like that.\u201d\n-\nBeastie Boys\u2019 Adam Yauch rushes the stage in disguise (1994)\nBefore Kanye West cut Taylor Swift\u2019s speech off in 2009, Beastie Boys member Adam Yauch was the first to do it. In 1994, Yauch, dressed as his alter-ego Nathaniel Hornblower (whose outfit resembled a leprechaun\u2019s), stormed the stage as R.E.M. accepted their award for best director for \u201cEverybody Hurts.\u201d Declaring, \u201cThis is an outrage! This is a farce!\u201d Yauch argued that Spike Jonze should have won the award for directing Beastie Boys\u2019 \u201cSabotage\u201d music video.\n-\nVan Halen\u2019s reunion doesn\u2019t go as expected (1996)\nThe band reunited with David Lee Roth for the first time in over a decade, to present the award for best male video. However, Roth kept interrupting the group and going on tangents.It was their first time together onstage since their 1984 tour wrapped. Van Halen had recently split with singer Sammy Hagar, and Roth had been brought back to record some new songs for a compilation album, according to Rolling Stone, leading many fans to think that an announcement of a reunion tour was imminent.\n\u201cWe have to make an announcement,\u201d Roth said, in his first interruption. \u201cWe have to address a subject here. This is the first time we\u2019ve actually stood onstage together in over a decade.\u201d\nHe then interrupted again, cutting off bassist Michael Anthony: \u201cHave you noticed how things have changed a lot since the last time we were up here?\u201d he asked the crowd. \u201cIt used to be, \u2018I want my MTV!\u2019 And now it\u2019s like, \u2018Gimme your fucking MTV or I\u2019ll blow your head off, man.\u2019\u201d Guitarist Eddie Van Halen then took Roth and gently but firmly pushed him aside, though Roth began thrusting his hips and making other gestures off to the side. According to Rolling Stone, Roth stood behind Beck as he accepted the award for \u201cWhere It\u2019s At\u201d and continued to make distracting movements.\n\u201cI felt his onstage antics were embarrassing and disrespectful to Beck,\u201d Eddie later said. \u201cBackstage, he spit in my face. We get shuffled off to the first mob press conference and everyone was yelling and screaming questions and Dave wasn\u2019t answering any of them. I just kind of walked up to him and say, \u2018Look, here\u2019s what is happening. Two songs for Best Of Volume One. Warner Bros. would like us to do two videos and that is it. If you think we\u2019re going on tour in the summer, forget it. We\u2019re not going to go out there and take your money. If we ever do a tour with Roth in the future we\u2019ll have to write and record a new album. Also, I\u2019m getting a new hip on Dec. 6, so that\u2019s going to throw a wrench in the works.\u2019\u201d\n-\nFiona Apple declares \u201cthis world is bullshit\u201d (1997)\nAt the 1997 VMAs, Fiona Apple decided to skip all of the \u201cthank yous\u201d during her acceptance speech for best new artist and instead used her time at the podium to deliver a poignant message. \u201cI didn\u2019t prepare a speech and I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m glad that I didn\u2019t because I\u2019m not gonna do this like everybody else does it,\u201d the singer said. \u201cWhat I wanna say is \u2026 this world is bullshit. You shouldn\u2019t model your life about what you think we think is cool and what we\u2019re wearing and what we\u2019re saying and everything. Go with yourself.\u201d\n-\nDiana Ross gets handsy with Lil\u2019 Kim (1999)\nWhile presenting the award for best hip-hop video in 1999, Diana Ross got up-close and a little too personal with Lil\u2019 Kim, who came to the show wearing a purple jumpsuit that revealed her left breast (which she covered with a pasty). Instead of greeting the rapper with a customary hug or handshake, Ross reached over and gave her co-presenter\u2019s exposed breast a jiggle.\n-\nMichael Jackson receives the nonexistent \u201cartist of the millennium\u201d award (2000)\nA miscommunication at the 2000 VMAs led to Michael Jackson delivering a heartfelt acceptance speech for an award that didn\u2019t exist. That year, MTV planned to allocate some show time to celebrate the King of Pop\u2019s birthday. But when Britney Spears introduced Jackson onstage as someone she considers to be the \u201cartist of the millennium,\u201d Jackson mistakenly thought he was receiving an official award for that title.\n-\nRage Against the Machine\u2019s Tim Commerford rages against Limp Bizkit (2000)\nIn 2000, Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim Commerford climbed atop a 15-foot-tall set piece onstage in protest after Limp Bizkit won the moonman for best rock video.\nCommerford refused to come down and was subsequently arrested and spent the night in jail.\n\u201cMy reasons were my personal reasons,\u201d Commerford later said of why he did it. \u201cTotally personal politics.\u201d\n-\nBritney Spears performs \u201cI\u2019m a Slave 4 U\u201d with a live python (2001)\nThe singer performed \u201cI\u2019m a Slave 4 U\u201d while holding an Albino python draped over her shoulders in 2001. In 2016, she told E! News of the iconic moment: \u201cIt\u2019s insane! Why did I do that?\u201d Asked if she\u2019s ever do it again, she replied: \u201cHell, no! It\u2019s so dumb. No! Never!\u201d\nHowever, in 2023, she posted about the performance on Instagram that it was one of her favorites of all time and noted she wrote about it in her memoir, The Woman in Me: \u201cOne of my favorite performances was with an albino python \u2026 I still remember how scared I felt when I was handed this snake and took the stage !!!\u201d\n-\nMichael Jackson surprises fans by joining \u2018N Sync for performance (2001)\nThe King of Pop took the stage with \u2018N Sync to show off his signature moves in 2001 at the end of their performance of \u201cPop.\u201d\n-\nMacy Gray takes self-promotion to a new level (2001)\nMacy Gray wanted everyone to know exactly when her second album, The Id, would be released. In a next-level act of self-promotion, she wore a gown to the 2001 VMAs bearing the following message in all caps on the front: \u201cMy new album drops Sept. 18, 2001.\u201d While onstage, she told the audience: \u201cMusic and videos are all good, but I want everyone to take a moment and just focus on my dress.\u201d She showed off the front and then turned around to reveal another message, in all caps \u2014 \u201cBuy it!\u201d \u2014 on her derri\u00e9re.\nDesigner Betsey Johnson applauded the move (\u201cshe\u2019s her best advertisement\u201d), while other critics called it a \u201ctacky\u201d and \u201cugly dress\u201d but acknowledged that she did get the headlines she was looking for with the stunt.\n-\nAndy Dick portrays Christina Aguilera\u2019s \u201ccousin\u201d (2001)\nAndy Dick took the stage as \u201cDaphne Aguilera,\u201d the \u201ccousin\u201d of Christina Aguilera, for a skit.\nHe took the stage to perform a song in a hot pink outfit with several backup dancers. Toward the end, he became annoyed and \u201cslapped\u201d a backup dancer that got in his way. He then went out into the audience, walked over the top of the seats and \u201cattacked\u201d Xtina herself, who saw the humor in the whole bit.\nHe originated the character on his MTV series The Andy Dick Show.\n-\nEminem takes on Moby and Triumph the Insult Comic Dog (2002)\nIn 2001, Moby called Eminem \u201da misogynist, a homophobe, a racist and an anti-Semite.\u201d In response, Eminem called Moby a \u201c36-year-old bald-headed f*g\u201d in his hit song \u201cWithout Me.\u201d At the 2002 VMAs, Triumph the Insult Comic Dog was making jokes with a game Moby, when the puppet (Robert Smigel) referenced the feud and then tried to talk to Eminem, who brusquely shut him down. When Eminem later took the stage to accept an award, presented by Christina Aguilera, he was booed after he called Moby a \u201clittle\u201d girl and said he would \u201chit a man with glasses.\u201d For his part, Triumph has been quoted as saying of the incident: \u201dI only wish Eminem could relax and enjoy all he has: his unique talent and his smooth white hair, which brings to mind a beagle\u2019s nutsack. He should lighten up \u2026 I mean, my mom was a bitch too, but I don\u2019t go writing songs about it.\u201d -\nMadonna kisses Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera (2003)\nBefore Madonna made headlines for laying one on Drake during her surprise guest set at the 2015 Coachella festival, the singer turned heads when she kissed both Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera during their joint performance of \u201cLike a Virgin\u201d and \u201cHollywood\u201d at the 2003 awards show. Spears and Aguilera wore wedding gowns and descended down from a giant multi-tiered cake set piece, in a nod to Madonna\u2019s 1984 performance, and did some writhing of their own, while the latter showed up in a black jacket and top hat. After some dance moves, Madonna then locked lips with first Spears and then Aguilera.\n-\nFat Joe and 50 Cent trade barbs (2005)\nFat Joe took the stage at the 2005 VMAs to present an award, but not before saying: \u201cI\u2019d like tell the people at home I feel so safe tonight with all this police protection, courtesy of G-Unit,\u201d the hip-hop group formed by 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo. Later in the show, after G-Unit performed, 50 called out Fat Joe in a bleep-filled moment: \u201cFat Joe is pussy, man. Pussy boy. Fuck boy.\u201d\nIn his 2022 memoir, Fat Joe wrote about the incident: \u201cHalfway through the show, I went out on the stage to give Missy Elliott an award. What the audience at home didn\u2019t see was that during the commercial break beforehand, 50 Cent got out of his seat and started walking the house. He went up to the audience in the cheap seats and started waving to me. It was like he was daring me to get off the stage and physically confront him. Then he went down to the floor and started slapping fives with Jay-Z and Diddy.\u201d Then 50 Cent came out onstage just before Fat Joe was scheduled to perform. \u201cI was saying to myself, OK, we\u2019re about to fight. We\u2019re about to get it on right here at the VMAs,\u201d Joe wrote. \u201cWhen the show came back on \u2014 this is live TV, mind you \u2014 he went back to his seat. The G-Unit started yelling at me while I\u2019m reading off the teleprompter. The Terror Squad, offstage in the wings, started barking back. That\u2019s when I dropped my jab: \u2018I feel safe with all the police protection courtesy of G-Unit.\u2019\u201d Fat Joe also said the incident cost him a $20 million endorsement deal for a new shoe with the Jordan brand as well as other deals.\nFor his part, 50 Cent said last year that he regrets spending time feuding with Fat Joe. He attributed their beef due to their similar personalities. \u201cWhen we\u2019re at odds, we are at odds, and we did that for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of his loyalty to Irv Gotti and Ja Rule, Joe wasn\u2019t happy with things that were making me happy. It was easy for me to say, \u2018F\u2014 you,\u2019 because we weren\u2019t on the same page.\u201d He added: \u201cNow he\u2019s like my friend, and I don\u2019t care that he has relationships with people I don\u2019t. He\u2019s always had those relationships.\u201d They have even hit the stage together in recent years (see below).\n-\nBritney Spears draws concern with \u201cGimme More\u201d performance (2007)\nThe pop singer hit the stage again in 2007 to perform \u201cGimme More\u201d but drew concern from the public and critics who remarked that she seemed out of it for the performance. She later revealed in her memoir, The Woman in Me, that she\u2019d had an awkward run-in with ex-boyfriend Justin Timberlake ahead of her performance. \u201cIt had been a while since I\u2019d seen him,\u201d she wrote. \u201cEverything was going great in his world. He was at the top of his game in every way, and he had a lot of swagger. I was having a panic attack. I hadn\u2019t rehearsed enough. I hated the way I looked. I knew it was going to be bad.\u201d\nShe continued: \u201cThere was a problem with my costume and with my hair extensions. I hadn\u2019t slept the night before. I was dizzy. It was less than a year since I\u2019d had my second baby in two years but everyone was acting like my not having six-pack abs was offensive, I couldn\u2019t believe I was going to have to go out onstage feeling the way I felt. I went out there and did the best I could at that moment in time, which \u2014 yes, granted \u2014 was far from my best at other times. I could see myself on video throughout the auditorium while I performed; it was like looking at myself in a fun-house mirror.\u201d\nA video of her rehearsal, which went much better than the live performance, was released later.\n-\nKanye West interrupts Taylor Swift\u2019s acceptance speech (2009)\nPerhaps the most buzzed-about moment of all, Kanye West rushed the stage in the middle of Taylor Swift\u2019s acceptance speech soon after the pop star was awarded a trophy for best female video at the 2009 VMAs. Claiming that her music video for \u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d wasn\u2019t worthy of the prize, the rapper told her, \u201cYo, Taylor \u2014 I\u2019m really happy for you. Imma let you finish, but Beyonc\u00e9 had one of the best videos of all time.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 later brought Swift back to the stage to properly present her speech when she won the night\u2019s biggest honor, video of the year. \u201cI remember being 17-years-old up for my first MTV award with Destiny\u2019s Child, and it was one of the most exciting moments in my life,\u201d she told the audience. \u201cSo, I\u2019d like for Taylor to come out and have her moment.\u201d\nIn 2015, Swift presented the Video Vanguard Award to West, where she jokingly referred to the incident when addressing the night\u2019s other winners: \u201cI\u2019m really happy for you, and Imma let you finish, but Kanye West has had one of the greatest careers of all time.\u201d\n-\nLady Gaga wears a dress made of raw meat (2010)\nLady Gaga shocked viewers \u2014 and angered animal rights groups \u2014 when she donned a dress made of raw meat at the 2010 Video Music Awards. She said the dress was meant as a statement against the U.S. military\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d policy regarding people who identified as LGBTQ serving in the armed forces.\n\u201cI was speaking with my artistic friends about if we wanted to make any statements while we were at the MTV Video Music Awards, and we did want to make a statement,\u201d Gaga told Vogue in 2021. \u201cBecause at the time, they were trying to repeal \u2018Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell,\u2019 but we decided to do the meat dress because I thought to myself, if you were willing to die for your country, what does it matter how you identify?\u201d\nShe added: \u201cIt smelled like meat. It was thrilling to wear. There\u2019s a corset under [the dress], but the corset was sewn to the meat. So this is actually a garment. They didn\u2019t just drape meat over me and cross their fingers.\u201d\nThe dress was preserved as a form of jerky and is currently on display at the Haus of Gaga museum inside the Park MGM casino in Las Vegas.\nA year later, Lady Gaga made headlines again at the VMAs. Though she was \u201cabsent\u201d from the 2011 awards show, her alter-ego, Jo Calderone, made an appearance. The pop star \u2014 donning a black blazer, sideburns and a black wig \u2014 stayed in character for the entire ceremony, even while performing her single \u201cYou and I.\u201d\n-\nBeyonc\u00e9 debuts her baby bump (2011)\nBeyonc\u00e9 performed her single \u201cLove on Top\u201d at the 2011 awards show dressed in a modest blazer and black slacks. At the end of her set, she unbuttoned her jacket and exposed her growing baby bump, publicly announcing her pregnancy and garnering rousing applause from the audience (and husband Jay-Z, who was standing in front). She would give birth to their first daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, on Jan. 7, 2012.\n-\nMiley Cyrus waves her foam finger and twerks with Robin Thicke (2013)\nThe \u201cWrecking Ball\u201d singer joined Robin Thicke onstage for a racy performance of her song \u201cWe Can\u2019t Stop\u201d and his hit \u201cBlurred Lines,\u201d during which Cyrus twerked in front of Thicke and made suggestive gestures with a foam finger.\nFollowing the show, the FCC was flooded with complaints from outraged viewers who deemed the performance \u201ccrude\u201d and \u201cshameful.\u201d\nThicke later said: \u201cWe knew what we were getting ourselves into. We\u2019re entertainers, and the VMAs is the perfect place for a little shock and awe. Yeah, we kind of knew when we were in rehearsal. \u2026 We were like, \u2018OK, if you touch me with your foam finger all over my crotch, obviously a few people are going to have something to say about this.\u2019 But that was the whole point. I mean, the whole point was to excite and provoke and entertain.\u201d\nFor her part, Cyrus said she wanted to make history with the performance. \u201cI don\u2019t pay attention to the negative,\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cMadonna\u2018s done it, Britney\u2018s done it. Every VMA performance, anyone that performs, that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for \u2014 you\u2019re wanting to make history. Me and Robin, the whole time said, \u2018You know we\u2019re about to make history right now.\u2019\u201d Of the people who continued talking about the performance in the days that followed, she said: \u201cThey\u2019re overthinking it. You\u2019re thinking about it more than I thought about it when I did it. I didn\u2019t even think about it, \u2019cause that\u2019s just me.\u201d\n-\nEx-homeless man accepts Miley Cyrus\u2019 award (2014)\nWhen Cyrus won video of the year in 2014 for \u201cWrecking Ball,\u201d she let a once-homeless man accept the award of her behalf in an effort to raise awareness about youth homelessness. Jesse Helt, then 22, accepted the honor and spoke about his own experience as a teary-eyed Cyrus watched.\n\u201cThank y\u2019all, my name is Jesse and I accept this award on behalf of the 1.6 million runaways and homeless youth in the United States who are starving, lost and scared for their lives right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI know this because I am one of these people. I\u2019ve survived in shelters all over. \u2026 Though I may have been invisible to you in the streets, I have a lot of the same dreams that brought many of you here tonight.\u201d\nCyrus bought the suit he wore to the show and paid for his hotel room.\nIt was later revealed that he had a warrant out for his arrest in his home state of Oregon for \u201ccriminal mischief\u201d and \u201cattempted burglary\u201d in 2010. Attending the show violated the terms of his probation. He was sentenced to six months in jail after turning himself in. Two years later, he put the trophy she let him keep up for sale, reportedly to pay for costs associated with his unborn baby.\n-\nKanye West announces he\u2019s running for president (2015)\nKanye West accepted his Video Vanguard honor by first standing onstage for roughly two minutes listening to the applause, without saying anything. Then, in a lengthy and rambling speech, he questioned the meaning of awards shows, criticized MTV for replaying his 2009 VMAs moment with Swift repeatedly to generate bigger ratings and admitted he\u2019d \u201crolled up a little something\u201d to smoke before coming out onstage. He ended his speech by saying: \u201cI\u2019m confident. I believe in myself. We the millennials, bro. This is a new mentality. We not gonna control our kids with brands. We not going to teach hate to our kids. We\u2019re going to teach our kids that they can be something, that they can believe in themselves. If my grandfather was here right now, he would not let me back down. I don\u2019t know what I finna lose after this. It don\u2019t matter though, because it\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about ideas, bro, new ideas, people with ideas, people who believe in truth. And yes, as you probably could have guessed by this moment, I have decided in 2020, to run for president.\u201d He did run, in fact, and conceded the day after the election, which Joe Biden won. In 2022, he announced that he was running again, in the 2024 election, but his campaign eventually petered out.\n-\nMiley Cyrus and Nicki Minaj air their beef (2015)\nThe two artists have a history of bickering with one another. This particular dispute started when Nicki Minaj\u2019s \u201cAnaconda\u201d wasn\u2019t nominated for video of the year in a category that did include other nominees like Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus, who also was the VMAs host that year. Minaj tweeted her frustration over the snub: \u201cWhen the \u2018other\u2019 girls drop a video that breaks records and impacts culture they get that nomination\u201d and \u201cIf your video celebrates women with very slim bodies, you will be nominated for vid of the year.\u201d For her part, Swift replied: \u201c@NICKIMINAJ I\u2019ve done nothing but love & support you. It\u2019s unlike you to pit women against each other. Maybe one of the men took your slot.\u201d\nCyrus, meanwhile, was asked about Minaj in an interview with The New York Times. \u201cYou know what I always say? Not that this is jealousy, but jealousy does the opposite of what you want it to \u2014 that\u2019s a yoga mantra,\u201d she replied. \u201cPeople forget that the choices that they make and how they treat people in life affect you in a really big way. If you do things with an open heart and you come at things with love, you would be heard and I would respect your statement. But I don\u2019t respect your statement because of the anger that came with it. And it\u2019s not anger like, \u2018Guys, I\u2019m frustrated about some things that are a bigger issue.\u2019 You made it about you. Not to sound like a bitch, but that\u2019s like, \u2018Eh, I didn\u2019t get my VMA.'\u201d\nShe continued: \u201cWhat I read sounded very Nicki Minaj, which, if you know Nicki Minaj is not too kind. It\u2019s not very polite. I think there\u2019s a way you speak to people with openness and love. You don\u2019t have to start this pop star against pop star war. It became Nicki Minaj and Taylor in a fight, so now the story isn\u2019t even on what you wanted it to be about. Now you\u2019ve just given E! News \u2018Catfight! Taylor and Nicki Go at It.'\u201d\nCut to the VMAs just a few days later. Minaj won for best hip-hop video and then turned to Cyrus and said: \u201cBack to this bitch that had a lot to say about me the other day in the press. Miley, what\u2019s good?\u201d Cyrus responded: \u201cHey, we\u2019re all in this industry. We all do interviews, and we know how they manipulate shit. Nicki, congratu-fucking-lations.\u201d\n-\nMiley Cyrus suffers wardrobe malfunction (2015)\nThat year\u2019s host generated more headlines out of the VMAs when she suffered a wardrobe malfunction backstage. She appeared on camera behind a black curtain doing her hosting duties. When someone went to walk by her, the curtain fell and showed off her nude breast. It quickly cut away and Cyrus could be heard saying: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? Oh, sorry. My tit\u2019s out?\u201d The Parents Television Council released a statement in response: \u201cAre we surprised that Miley Cyrus exposed herself to millions of viewers, and to more people who will inevitably see the news in the mainstream media? About as surprised as we\u2019ll be if the sun rises in the east tomorrow morning.\u201d The FCC also received some complaints from upset viewers. In 2022, Cyrus suffered yet another wardrobe malfunction while performing on her NBC special Miley\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve Party.\n-\nDrake professes his love for Rihanna (2016)\nHe may have won over romantics with his speech but not his intended target. Drake presented Rihanna \u2014 whom he\u2019d previously dated \u2014 with the Video Vanguard Award in 2016, starting out by talking about how they met before either had achieved their current level of fame. He ended his remarks by declaring: \u201cShe\u2019s someone I\u2019ve been in love with since I was 22 years old. She\u2019s one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life, I\u2019ve looked up to her even though she\u2019s younger than me. She\u2019s a living, breathing legend in our industry.\u201d (He\u2019d also taken out a billboard to congratulate her on her honor. She posted a photo of it on Instagram with the caption, \u201cWhen he extra ?\u2013!!!\u201d)\nIn 2018, she told Vogue that the 2016 VMAs moment made her \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d \u201cThe VMAs is such a fan-focused awards show, so having that energy around me, and knowing the people who had received the award in the past, made it feel like a big deal,\u201d she said. \u201cWaiting through that speech was probably the most uncomfortable part. I don\u2019t like too many compliments. I don\u2019t like to be put on blast.\u201d She also said then: \u201cWe don\u2019t have a friendship now, but we\u2019re not enemies either. It is what it is.\u201d (She\u2019s been with A$AP Rocky since 2020; they have two kids together and a third on the way.)"

      "text": "The 40 Greatest Needle Drops in Film History\nFrom Tarantino to 'Trainspotting,' these iconic music cues didn\u2019t just soundtrack great movies \u2014 they transformed how we hear the songs forever.\nMusic has been an indivisible part of movies from the start, or at least since cinemas begin hiring piano players to provide live accompaniment to silent features. The first sound movies were musicals. Studios were worried audiences wouldn\u2019t stick around just to hear actors talk. By the \u201930s, the symphonic soundtrack had become an essential part of any feature.\nBut we had to wait for the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll revolution to bring us the needle drop, the use of a preexisting track that complements, collides with or completes the images onscreen, creating something bigger than either alone. The cue of Bill Haley\u2019s \u201cRock Around the Clock\u201d in Blackboard Jungle (1955) is one of the Ur-drops. Directors never looked back.\nA great needle drop can set a tone or define a character. It can elevate or undercut the action or emotion onscreen. The best reframe one\u2019s relationship with the song \u2014 does anyone, after seeing Reservoir Dogs, listen to \u201cStuck in the Middle With You\u201d the same way again? \u2014 and deliver a pop music distillation of a movie\u2019s mood and message. Do the Right Thing is \u201cFight the Power.\u201d \u201cFight the Power\u201d is Do the Right Thing.\nOur first draft of the best needle drops in film history ran to more than a hundred tracks. You could fill a top 40 list with just a handful of directors. The films of Quentin Tarantino, Danny Boyle, Sofia Coppola and Paul Thomas Anderson are essentially mixtapes in movie form. As for Martin Scorsese \u2026 don\u2019t get us started. So we set a few ground rules: just one song per artist and one song per director (Marty being the sole exception). We tried to embrace a range of film styles and musical genres, with a bias toward tracks that, once heard in their movie context, are never quite the same again. We picked head-banging triumphs, karaoke sing-alongs and can\u2019t-stop-dancing tunes. Some are anthems of rebellion. Some are whispered laments. All are unforgettable.\n-\n\u2018American Graffiti\u2019 \u2014 \u201cGreen Onions\u201d by Booker T. and the MGs\nWhen The Fast & the Furious was still a glint in the eyes of a wee Vin Diesel, George Lucas was showing how you soundtrack a drag race. The slow-rolling cool of this Stax soul classic, with its effortless swagger, is a sonic shortcut to American Graffiti\u2018s early \u201960s nostalgia (\u201cWhere were you in \u201962?\u201d), a world of hot rods, diner pit stops and backseat romance. The soundtrack to Lucas\u2019 ode to post-war Americana features nonstop pop and rock hits of the era, starting with Bill Haley & His Comets\u2019 \u201cRock Around the Clock\u201d and ending with The Beach Boys\u2019 \u201cAll Summer Long.\u201d Securing the rights to all these songs reportedly cost so much that it left no room for a traditional score (Elvis Presley is notably absent because he was too expensive). -\n\u2018Another Round\u2019 \u2014 \u201cWhat a Life\u201d by Scarlet Pleasure\nThomas Vinterberg\u2019s bittersweet, Oscar-winning ode to alcoholism ends with a moment of 200-proof joy as Mads Mikkelsen gets plastered and channels his inner Fred Astaire in an Old Hollywood dance sequence as corny as it is transcendent. Blasting over the top is this Danish pop-rap track, which, suitably enough, has become the country\u2019s go-to party tune for New Year\u2019s celebrations nationwide. -\n\u2018Apocalypse Now\u2019 \u2014 \u201cThe End\u201d by The Doors\nThe opening sequence of Apocalypse Now remains American cinema\u2019s definitive master class in the poetic marriage of music and image. Helicopter blades thump rhythmically across the frame as the camera holds on a hazy tableau of tropical foliage. Doors guitarist Robby Krieger\u2019s shamanistic guitar line then wends its way into the scene like the onset of an acid trip, and in the precise moment that Jim Morrison\u2019s haunting baritone abruptly intones, \u201cThis is the end, beau-ti-ful friend \u2026\u201d, the jungle explodes into all-consuming napalm hellfire. The surreal, mournful atmosphere of the song perfectly establishes the ecstatic truth Apocalypse Now is seeking: This is not just a war film, but a journey into whatever comes after existential despair and derangement. -\n\u2018Beau Travail\u2019 \u2014 \u201cRhythm of the Night\u201d by Corona\nClaire Denis\u2019 Beau Travail ends with one of cinema\u2019s most transcendent codas: Disgraced Legionnaire Galoup (Denis Lavant), after being broken and brutalized by his military training, finally cuts loose, alone on the dance floor, gyrating to Corona\u2019s Europop hit. After 90 minutes of mounting tension, Denis gives Galoup, and the audience, a euphoric release, as his coiled limbs practically explode and his body finally speaks. -\n\u2018The Big Lebowski\u2019 \u2014 \u201cHotel California\u201d by The Gipsy Kings\nAs comedic needle drops go, nobody fucks with the Jesus. The Coen brothers are masters of music deployed for ironic effect, and this one remains an all-timer. The scene makes for two hilarious needle drops in one. The slow opening guitar of the Gipsy Kings\u2019 flamenco cover of \u201cHotel California\u201d \u2014 by The Eagles, the band Jeff Bridges\u2019 the Dude famously hates \u2014 introduces us to John Turturro\u2019s Jesus Quintana, hair-netted, purple-jumpsuitted and strutting to the lane to tap his bowling ball with the tip of his tongue in a revolting ritual of swagger and concentration. Of course, he bowls a perfect strike, and just as the pins explode, the Gipsy Kings\u2019 cover kicks into high gear and Jesus breaks into a loose-limbed victory jig. The Dude intones as the scene winds down, \u201cFucking Quintana, that creep can roll, man.\u201d -\n\u2018Blue Velvet\u2019 \u2014 \u201cIn Dreams\u201d by Roy Orbison\nOrbison\u2019s dreamy ballad, featuring \u201cthe candy-colored clown\u201d that obsesses psycho Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), is at the nightmarish heart of David Lynch\u2019s early masterpiece. Lynch uses repetitive drops, from Dean Stockwell\u2019s terrifying lip-synch to Dorothy Vallens\u2019 (Isabella Rossellini) desperate night club performance, to blur the line between beauty and horror, linking the characters in their shared obsession with controlling the object of their desires. \u201cIn dreams, you\u2019re mine, all the time.\u201d -\n\u2018Boogie Nights\u2019 \u2014 \u201cSister Christian\u201d by Night Ranger\nPaul Thomas Anderson proved himself a graduate of the Martin Scorsese school of incongruous needle drops with the \u201ccoke deal gone bad\u201d scene from Boogie Nights. A speedo-wearing Alfred Molina, freebased off his tits, sings along to Night Ranger\u2019s kitschy power ballad. But the top 40 mood is cut with rising menace (those exploding firecrackers don\u2019t help). All that\u2019s needed is a tempo change \u2014 to Rick Springfield\u2019s \u201cJessie\u2019s Girl\u201d \u2014 to trigger violent chaos. -\n\u2018Call Me by Your Name\u2019 \u2014 \u201cLove My Way\u201d by The Psychedelic Furs\nEven more than Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet softly sobbing to Sufjan Stevens over the film\u2019s closing credits, this period-appropriate New Wave anthem succinctly captures the tortured feeling of repressed love at the heart of Luca Guadagnino\u2019s romantic masterpiece. You can almost taste the longing as Chalamet\u2019s Elio, alone on the sidelines, watches Oliver (Armie Hammer) dad dance his white socks off. -\n\u2018Casino\u2019 \u2014 \u201c(I Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction\u201d by Devo\nWhen Martin Scorsese turns a Rolling Stones classic on its head, you can be sure he knows what he\u2019s doing. In Casino, he uses Devo\u2019s jittery New Wave cover of \u201c(I Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction\u201d to electrify the montage showing Ace Rothstein\u2019s empire beginning its violent collapse. It\u2019s almost an inside joke: Scorsese\u2019s films so famously feature Rolling Stones songs (in fact, Casino uses the Stones\u2019 original \u201cSatisfaction\u201d elsewhere, and \u201cGimme Shelter\u201d is featured in no less than three Scorsese films: Goodfellas, Casino and The Departed) that dropping Devo\u2019s robotic 1978 cover highlights how off-kilter everything has become. A needle drop that generates real cinematic tension while also winking at the audience\u2019s expectations \u2014 all while Nicky Santoro and company careen off the rails in Vegas. -\n\u2018Children of Men\u2019 \u2014 \u201cIn the Court of the Crimson King\u201d by King Crimson\nAlfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s dystopian masterpiece is packed with striking music cues, but none is as evocative as King Crimson\u2019s prog-rock opus. The 1969 song plays in one of the film\u2019s rare moments of respite \u2014 when Theo (Clive Owen) visits a sanctuary of art (the \u201cArk of the Arts\u201d) amid a future of global infertility and unrest. As Theo glides through the broken city and enters his wealthy cousin\u2019s secluded hideaway, the mellotron-rich strains of King Crimson fill the air, lending the scene a singular atmosphere of eerie, elegiac grandeur. -\n\u2018Chungking Express\u2019 \u2014 \u201cDreams\u201d by The Cranberries / Faye Wong\nWong Kar-wai\u2019s vividly alive anthology rom-com is a film practically built on pop-song repetition. The Mamas and the Papas \u201cCalifornia Dreamin'\u201d haunts the film\u2019s first half beautifully, but the movie\u2019s most whimsical and infectious musical motif is \u201cDreams,\u201d both the original Cranberries hit and the Cantonese version recorded by Chungking Express\u2018 star, Faye Wong. As Wong, in her adorable pixie cut, falls helplessly for Tony Leung\u2019s impossibly handsome beat cop, it\u2019s all there in the jangle of \u201cDreams'\u201d guitar and the hopeful longing of the lyrics (\u201cOh my life is changing every day, in every possible way \u2026\u201d). Impatient, giddy young love set amid Hong Kong\u2019s relentless hustle and flow. -\n\u2018Clueless\u2019 \u2014 \u201cKids in America\u201d by The Muffs\nAs far as \u201990s teen nostalgia needle drops go, this one is hard to beat. Clueless opens with an unforgettable blast of pure pop-punk bliss as The Muffs\u2019 \u201cKids in America\u201d plays over a montage tour of Cher Horowitz\u2019s (Alicia Silverstone) ultra-fabulous Beverly Hills high school life \u2014 friends, pool parties, outfits! The movie\u2019s lovable tone is instantly established \u2014 a soft satire/celebration of privileged teen superficiality, but with a heart of gold. -\n\u2018Donnie Darko\u2019 \u2014 \u201cMad World\u201d by Gary Jules and Michael Andrews\nEcho and the Bunnymen\u2019s \u201cThe Killing Moon\u201d sets the tone with one of recent cinema\u2019s great suburban alienation openings, as a young Jake Gyllenhaal hops on his road bike to glide through the quiet hills of upper-middle-class 1980s America. But it\u2019s Gary Jules and Michael Andrews\u2019 delicate, haunting cover of Tears for Fears\u2019 \u201cMad World\u201d that delivers the film\u2019s most poignant moment: a devastating closing montage as Donnie\u2019s family and community awaken to the emotional aftershocks of his sacrifice \u2014 a feels-filled fantasy for angst-ridden teenage boys everywhere (\u201cThe dreams in which I\u2019m dying are the best I\u2019ve ever had \u2026\u201d). -\n\u2018Do the Right Thing\u2019 \u2014 \u201cFight the Power\u201d by Public Enemy\nSpike Lee\u2019s magnum opus taps the energy and righteous fury of Public Enemy\u2019s Black Power rap anthem. From the opening credits, as Rosie Perez pops, locks, boxes and boogies to Chuck D.\u2019s call to arms, to the film\u2019s climax, when Radio Raheem\u2019s boombox, playing \u201cFight the Power\u201d on a loop, meets the business end of Sal\u2019s baseball bat. Both summer jam and war cry, it\u2019s a five-minute, 23-second distillation of Lee\u2019s vision, mood and message. -\n\u2018The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\u2019 \u2014 \u201cSpeed\u201d by Atari Teenage Riot\nThe F&F franchise is known for its roof-thumping original tracks, but for his stand-alone sequel, Justin Lin picked this Atari Teenage Riot track to rev up the opening race sequence, when our fish out of water hero Sean (Lucas Black) takes on Tokyo\u2019s drift racers. The digital hardcore hits your body as hard as Sean\u2019s Nissan Silvia hits the wall, ATR\u2019s glitchy rage perfectly channeling the film\u2019s raw velocity. -\n\u2018Fight Club\u2019 \u2014 \u201cWhere Is My Mind\u201d by The Pixies\nPicking The Pixies\u2019 alt-rock classic to close a film about a man with dissociative identity disorder is the most obvious of needle drops. David Fincher pulls it off perfectly. \u201cYou met me at a very strange time in my life,\u201d Edward Norton\u2019s character, his face half-blown off, mutters to Marla, as drums burst and the skyline collapses in front of them. Black Francis\u2019 lyrics evoke the film\u2019s themes of disconnect and disorientation as Fincher\u2019s visuals illustrate the ecstasy/horror of destruction and new beginnings. -\n\u2018Frances Ha\u2019 \u2014 \u201cModern Love\u201d by David Bowie\nNoah Baumbach\u2019s Frances Ha delivers pure joy in its most famous sequence: Greta Gerwig\u2019s title character dashing and dancing through Manhattan to David Bowie\u2019s anthem \u201cModern Love.\u201d The scene is a direct homage to a 1986 French film (Leos Carax\u2019s Mauvais Sang), in which a similar sprint to the same song occurs. But even if you didn\u2019t catch the cinephile reference, the moment has become an exhilarating and indelible sequence for a whole new generation of film lovers. It\u2019s a needle drop that feels simultaneously spontaneous and cleverly choreographed, much like Frances herself. -\n\u2018Get Out\u2019 \u2014 \u201cRedbone\u201d by Childish Gambino\nJordan Peele opens Get Out with Childish Gambino\u2019s woozy throwback hit \u201cRedbone,\u201d using its \u201cstay woke\u201d refrain as a sly thematic warning. The song plays over the film\u2019s opening scene, establishing a funky yet slightly eerie tone as protagonist Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) gets ready for a trip with his girlfriend (Allison Williams), effectively urging him \u2014 and the audience \u2014 not to get caught sleeping. No such luck. -\n\u2018Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai\u2019 \u2014 \u201cFast Shadow\u201d by Wu-Tang Clan\nThe whole ethos of Jim Jarmusch\u2019s Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai is essentially a Wu-Tang Clan needle drop in the form of an offbeat indie movie (with a few references to Seijun Suzuki and Jean-Pierre Melville thrown in for film buffs). Directly inspired by Wu-Tang\u2019s founding vision of a Staten Island hip-hop brotherhood bound by martial arts philosophy, the film follows Forest Whitaker as Ghost Dog, a hit man for the New Jersey mafia who lives by the ancient warrior code of the samurai. The film\u2019s animating spirit, undoubtedly, is the soundtrack composed and assembled by RZA \u2014 the first effort in what would become a distinguished screen career for the visionary Wu-Tang ringleader (culminating in scores for Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Kill Bill: Volume 1 & 2). Head-bumping moments abound in the picture, but when Whitaker slips a CD into his stereo while assembling his pistol in anticipation of battle, and Fast Shadow\u2019s beat kicks Method Man\u2019s flow into relentless motion, the scene transcends to a higher plane: a Ouroboros of impossibly cool musical and movie influences, stalking the streets in a hoodie and trench coat. -\n\u2018Girlhood\u2019 \u2014 \u201cDiamonds\u201d by Rihanna\nC\u00e9line Sciamma hadn\u2019t licensed rights to Rihanna\u2019s glittering anthem when she shot this scene, in which her Black teen protagonists, in their best shoplifted clothes, dance and lip-synch in front of the mirrors in their hotel room. But the pop star quickly gave her approval once she saw the clip, which shows the power of music to transcend circumstance and reframes joy as resistance. -\n\u2018Goodfellas\u2019 \u201cLayla\u201d by Derek and the Dominos\nArguably, the single best use of the needle drop in cinema history. By contrasting the soaring beauty of the piano interlude to Derek and the Dominos\u2019 power ballad with a montage of corpses, creatively whacked by Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) as he cleans shop following the Lufthansa heist, Scorsese transitions the film from hopeful Kennedy-era nostalgia to a dark, ultra-violent future. -\n\u2018Good Will Hunting\u2019 \u2014 \u201cMiss Misery\u201d by Elliott Smith\nWithout the achingly authentic music of the late, great Elliott Smith, it\u2019s quite possible that much of Good Will Hunting would have felt like a contrivance (How do you like them apples, Matt and Ben?). Throughout the movie, it\u2019s Smith\u2019s contributions that lend the story its realest undercurrents of delicate, introspective warmth. In a masterstroke, Gus Van Sant convinced Smith to write an original song for the ending, which resulted in \u201cMiss Misery,\u201d Will\u2019s bittersweet sendoff as he drives into the unknown in search of his love (\u201cI had to go see about a girl \u2026\u201d). The song also earned Smith an Oscar nomination, creating one of the most incongruously poignant musical moments in the awards show\u2019s history: a craggy and palpably nervous Smith, alone onstage with his guitar and fragile voice, performing for all of Hollywood\u2019s glitterati. -\n\u2018The Graduate\u2019 \u2014 \u201cThe Sound of Silence\u201d by Simon & Garfunkel\nThe rare use of an end-credit needle drop that reframes an entire film. What could have been a triumphant romantic climax \u2014 Benjamin rescues Elaine at the altar and the couple run off together \u2014 is turned existential thanks to the strains of Simon & Garfunkel\u2019s plaintive ballad playing over the long shot of Katharine Ross, in her wedding gown, slowly realizing what she\u2019s done, while a dead-eyed Dustin Hoffman stares off into the middle distance. -\n\u2018La Haine\u2019 \u2014 \u201cNon, Je ne regrette rien / Sound of da Police\u201d by \u00c9dith Piaf / KRS-One\nThe mashup as cinematic mission statement. La Haine, Mathieu Kassovitz\u2019s visceral portrait of French inner-city youth, takes flight in this rooftop DJ scene fusing \u00c9dith Piaf\u2019s classic chanson \u201cNon, je ne regrette rien\u201d with KRS-One\u2019s scorching boom-bap rap \u201cSound of da Police.\u201d In the fleeting but unforgettable sequence, a DJ (played by Cut Killer) scratches Piaf\u2019s 1960 ballad together with KRS-One\u2019s protest anthem and blasts it out his window. The camera starts in the room alongside him, before pulling out, taking flight through the window and soaring over the banlieues, as if riding the hybrid musical energy that encapsulates all of the rage, identity and contradictions of the world below. -\n\u2018Love Actually\u2019 \u2014 \u201cGod Only Knows\u201d by The Beach Boys\nRom-com maestro Richard Curtis deploys The Beach Boys\u2019 1966 masterpiece just as his sprawling ensemble cast finds resolution in a succession of emotional reunions inside Heathrow Airport\u2019s arrivals hall. Brian Wilson\u2019s shimmering harmonies and that joyful French horn melody do the heavy lifting as the characters\u2019 scenes dissolve into footage of actual public embraces between loved ones of all varieties, elevating the movie\u2019s sentimentality into something genuinely moving (some might even argue the ending is rescued from schmaltz via Wilson\u2019s pop genius). -\n\u2018The Matrix\u2019 \u2014 \u201cWake Up\u201d by Rage Against the Machine\nAs Neo chooses to \u201cwake up\u201d from the simulated reality of the Matrix and accept his destiny as \u201cthe one\u201d to lead the revolt against the machines, RATM\u2019s explosive track detonates over the end credits. It\u2019s an on-the-nose drop from the Wachowskis that lands perfectly, with a guitar riff of hard-rock rebellion and Zack de la Rocha\u2019s voice spitting pure prophecy. -\n\u2018Moonlight\u2019 \u2014 \u201cHello Stranger\u201d by Barbara Lewis\nBarry Jenkins\u2019 Moonlight is a master class in emotional restraint, and nowhere is that more evident than the diner reunion between Chiron and Kevin (Trevante Rhodes and Andr\u00e9 Holland). When Kevin puts Barbara Lewis\u2019 1963 R&B ballad on the jukebox, the lyrics do what words can\u2019t: reconnect two men who once shared a fleeting moment of tenderness. As Lewis sings, \u201cIt seems like a mighty long time,\u201d the space between them collapses, and the film opens its heart. -\n\u2018Napoleon Dynamite\u2019 \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re Going to Be Friends\u201d by The White Stripes\nSometimes a needle drop simply charms your socks off. Case in point: Napoleon Dynamite\u2019s opening credits, set to The White Stripes\u2019 \u201cWe\u2019re Going to Be Friends.\u201d Jack and Meg White\u2019s now-timeless acoustic ditty plays as we see a series of quirky, nostalgia-steeped still-life shots \u2014 student ID cards, tater tots on a plate, a \u201cliger\u201d drawing \u2014 all creatively arranged to show the film\u2019s credits. The song\u2019s lyrics about school friendship and its childlike melody instantly establish the film\u2019s sincere, offbeat approach to cringe humor. Director Jared Hess loved it so much he mailed an early cut to the band to request approval. (Of course, they said yes \u2014 making Napoleon Dynamite the first film to feature a White Stripes song, long before it became Conan O\u2019Brien\u2019s podcast theme song.) The result is one of the most endearing credit sequences of the 2000s. -\n\u2018Office Space\u2019 \u2014 \u201cDamn It Feels Good to Be a Gangsta\u201d by Geto Boys\nThe essence of Mike Judge\u2019s enduring cult classic Office Space resides in its hilarious juxtaposition of gangsta rap and the nebbish world of white-collar malaise. The move simultaneously highlights the farcical nature of the protagonists\u2019 \u201cstruggle,\u201d while also transforming their mundane devotion to slacking off into something akin to a triumphant act of rebellion, perfectly capturing the film\u2019s sarcastic but deeply relatable spirit. -\n\u2018Past Lives\u2019 \u2014 \u201cYou Know More Than I Know\u201d by John Cale\nNear the climax of Celine Song\u2019s subtle romantic drama, Nora\u2019s childhood soulmate, Hae Sung, and her husband, Arthur, share a charged, awkward moment while waiting for the check in a late night New York bar. Playing softly \u2014 but unmistakably \u2014 in the background is John Cale\u2019s elegiac ballad \u201cYou Know More Than I Know.\u201d The song perfectly captures the complicated emotions and quiet realities between these two very different but decent men, each of whom knows a profound part of Nora that the other will never fully access. The effect is subtle yet powerful \u2014 a needle drop that articulates unspoken understanding and gentle sorrow, laying the emotional groundwork for the devastating goodbye still to come. -\n\u2018Reservoir Dogs\u2019 \u2014 \u201cStuck in the Middle with You\u201d by Stealers Wheel\nNo one does the upbeat-music-paired-with-shocking-violence combo better than Tarantino. And nowhere better than in his debut, playing Stealers Wheel\u2019s \u201cDylanesque, pop, bubble-gum favorite\u201d over an ear-cutting torture scene, heightening both the humor and the horror. As suave psychopathic Mr. Blonde, its peak performance from the late, great Michael Madsen, showing off both his razor work and his soft shoe. -\n\u2018Rocky III\u2019 \u2014 \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d by Survivor\nName a song more synonymous with a movie than \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d and Rocky III. Ironically, the rock anthem wasn\u2019t Sylvester Stallone\u2019s first choice. After failing to secure the rights to Queen\u2019s \u201cAnother One Bites the Dust,\u201d Sly turned to the then-little-known band Survivor and asked them to write \u201csomething street, something with a pulse.\u201d The band lifted lyrics straight from the script \u2014 zeroing in on Apollo Creed\u2019s warning that Rocky had lost the \u201ceye of the tiger\u201d \u2014 and timed their power-chord blasts to match the punches onscreen. It\u2019s now impossible to imagine the movie training montage without it. -\n\u2018The Royal Tenenbaums\u2019 \u2014 \u201cThese Days\u201d by The Velvet Underground & Nico\nFrom the very start, Wes Anderson\u2019s inimitable aesthetic has leaned heavily on impeccably curated soundtracks (think back to the masterful use of The Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201c2000 Man\u201d at the climax of his first feature, Bottle Rocket). His filmography is littered with dozens of music cues that hit with all of the arresting poignancy of unruly teenage emotion \u2014 which happens to be his most enduring theme. But The Royal Tenenbaums arguably contains his magnum opus of musical moments: the use of Nico\u2019s \u201cThese Days\u201d during Richie and Margot\u2019s reunion. In this achingly tender scene, Richie Tenenbaum (Luke Wilson), fresh off a failed tennis career and an emotional breakdown, watches his adopted sister Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) step off a Green Line bus in slow motion. As she approaches \u2014 fur coat, heavy eyeliner, cigarette in hand \u2014 Nico\u2019s voice floats in: \u201cI\u2019ve been out walking \u2026 These days I seem to think a lot about the things that I forgot to do \u2026\u201d The effect is mesmerizing \u2014 a lifetime of unspoken feeling distilled into a prolonged moment of eye contact. -\n\u2018Running on Empty\u2019 \u2014 \u201cFire and Rain\u201d by James Taylor\nTaylor\u2019s musically sweet, lyrically devastating ballad is the perfect encapsulation of Sidney Lumet\u2019s elegy to \u201960s idealism. Playing over the Pope family as they wash up after dinner, dancing and singing along, the song is both balm and burden. Anti-war activists on the run from the FBI, the Popes know how fleeting this moment of domestic bliss will be. -\n\u2018Sir\u00e2t\u2019 \u2014 \u201cAmber Decay\u201d by Kangding Ray\nSir\u00e2t is by far the newest title on this list \u2014 it premiered to acclaim at the Cannes Film Festival in May and has yet to receive a wide release \u2014 but its status as a future cult classic already feels assured. How can a film \u2014 in story and setting \u2014 possibly capture the sublime grandeur of the most austere and intense techno? Sir\u00e2t is a feature-length answer to that question. French producer Kangding Ray\u2019s \u201cAmber Decay\u201d sets the tone and the stakes early, as a booming analog sound system is assembled and a piratical rave takes shape deep in the Moroccan desert. As Ray\u2019s ambient anthem echoes off the cliffs, a father and young boy stumble through the writhing dancers, searching for a daughter and sister who has gone missing. Is this a vision of hell or the last refuge of broken bodies and minds straining to feel alive? Before long, filmmaker Oliver Laxe makes clear it\u2019s both: The whole broken world is a rave, and we\u2019re all just clinging to the music. -\n\u2018Trainspotting\u2019 \u2014 \u201cBorn Slippy\u201d by Underworld\nDanny Boyle cues could fill an entire list of epic needle drops, with at least a dozen from Trainspotting alone. But the single best is Underworld\u2019s club anthem, its pounding four to the floor beat, and Karl Hyde\u2019s self-loathing chant (\u201cLager lager lager\u201d) playing over the film\u2019s final scene, when Renton (Ewan McGregor) chooses life by betraying his junkie mates, stealing their cash and making off into the London streets. -\n\u2018Valley Girl\u2019 \u2014 \u201cI Melt With You\u201d by Modern English\nMartha Coolidge set the standard for the romantic dating montage with this pure slice of \u201980s delight. Modern English\u2019s New Romantic ballad, playing over scenes of courtship between Deborah Foreman\u2019s eponymous Valley Girl, in all her pink-sweatered, feathered lock glory, and Randy, the spiky punk bad boy, played by Nicolas Cage in his first leading role, is a synth-laced distillation of teenage longing.\n-\n\u2018Wayne\u2019s World\u2019 \u2014 \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d by Queen\nWayne and Garth and the boys headbang to Queen\u2019s magnum opus in a beat-up AMC Pacer. A glorious comedy set piece balanced on the edge between mocking parody and heartfelt tribute, it revived Freddy Mercury for a new generation. Suburban metalheads around the world finally felt seen. -\n\u2018The Worst Person in the World\u2019 \u2014 \u201cI Said Goodbye to Me\u201d by Harry Nilsson\nNorwegian director Joachim Trier\u2019s 2021 breakout is packed with offbeat and nostalgic needle drops, but his use of Harry Nilsson\u2019s soft rock ballad is particularly poignant. As Julie (Renate Reinsve) leaves longtime lover Aksel for new beau Eivind, Nilsson\u2019s bittersweet lyrics suggest she feels the loss of the old relationship more than the joy of the new. The happy times with Eivind may prove just as fleeting. -\n\u2018Zodiac\u2019 \u2014 \u201cHurdy Gurdy Man\u201d by Donovan\nDavid Fincher\u2019s magisterial police procedural opens on a serene Fourth of July night in 1969. A young couple sits in a car, flirting and killing time, as Donovan\u2019s psychedelic folk-rock single \u201cHurdy Gurdy Man\u201d plays quietly over the radio. But when sudden, unspeakable violence descends upon them, the volume picks up, and a bone-chilling dissonance takes hold between the song\u2019s mellow haze and the Zodiac Killer\u2019s brutality. Bad men are out there, lurking \u2026 By the time the Hurdy Gurdy Man\u2019s ominous drone returns for the film\u2019s finale, it has been fully transformed into an anthem of dread. Mood-setting at its most masterful."
