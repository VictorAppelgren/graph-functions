      "summary": "Fed officials warn that core inflation remains sticky, especially in non‑housing services, and that the Fed may need to cut rates in September as a precautionary move.  Despite a low unemployment rate, inflation could rise to around 3%, limiting the room for aggressive cuts.  Political pressure on the Fed, exemplified by Governor Cook’s lawsuit against President Trump, is viewed as a real but currently muted risk that could destabilize markets if it leads to ultra‑low rates and higher inflation.",
