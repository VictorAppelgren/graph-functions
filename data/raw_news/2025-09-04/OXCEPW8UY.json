  "description": "Every AI strategy must also be a data strategy.",
  "content": "One of the key messages we are using in the market is \u201cEveryone\u2019s ready for AI except your data.\u201dThe funny thing about this statement is that we didn\u2019t come up with it. We heard versions of this sentiment from customers, and there is truth to it, so we decided to just tell it back to them.\n\nAs AI becomes a growing business imperative, management teams need to ask: Is our data quality good enough? Is our data well-governed and secure? What are the risks of inaccurate data? Many organizations still have work to do to get their data into the necessary state of readiness, but not because they\u2019ve neglected data management. They haven\u2019t. It\u2019s just that AI is more demanding and less forgiving. In the past, a data error might have meant a missed business opportunity. Now, faulty data can lead to AI bias or hallucinations\u2014a more serious misfire that harms customer relationships and brand value. This helps explain why \u201cdata and AI\u201d has become the new catch phrase; the two are inseparable. But that means data quality must meet a higher threshold.McKinsey recently pointed to \u201cat-scale data quality checks\u201d as a way to build confidence in AI and ensure readiness for governance tools and development protocols as part of its AI Trust Maturity Model.\n\nI\u2019m having frequent conversations with CEOs and other business leaders who are anxious to understand how to proceed, and it\u2019s top of mind in the board meetings I attend at Informatica, Box, and The Tech Interactive. As board members, we have a responsibility to assess both strategic opportunities and risks, which means enterprise AI is often on the agenda. Here\u2019s the rub: You can\u2019t have trusted AI without top-quality data. That implies clean, accurate, and timely data, but it\u2019s more than that. There must be comprehensive governance, cross-functional committees for effective integration and implementation, and training, education, and ethical guidelines. In other words, execution requires a top-down commitment, which is why data for AI is rising to a board-level concern. That wasn\u2019t the case even a few months ago. To start the year, there was barely a mention of data-readiness for AI in reports on board priorities from consulting firms like PwC and EY. But the pace of change is forcing corporate management to take notice.\n\nWhat can the board and other executive leaders do to ensure their companies go above and beyond traditional data management practices to produce \u201cAI-grade\u201d data? A good starting point is a clear-eyed assessment of an organization\u2019s data landscape, including which assets are most essential to operations, the platforms and infrastructure used to manage those data stores, and how much of it has been migrated to the cloud, which is a factor in AI-readiness. C-level executives should also ensure their AI strategies and business goals are well-aligned. Whether the objective is to expand into new regions, drive product development and revenues, or lower costs through supply-chain efficiencies, data-driven AI solutions can be brought to bear\u2014but only if data is high-caliber.\n\nThe first steps in AI implementation are development, testing, and pilot projects, to be followed by wider rollouts. This is where data curation and quality management get put to the real-world test with customers and partners. That\u2019s true whether it involves generative AI, private models based on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), or agentic AI. Other data and AI essentials are the ability to monitor, measure, and improve. Many organizations are still in the early stages with AI, but as they scale up and out, the executives responsible for oversight will need metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess progress and evaluate the effectiveness of their investments. These AI dashboards can also be invaluable for risk management. A word of warning to business leaders who decide to get involved with AI data: Don\u2019t be surprised if you encounter a mess. Corporate data systems are notoriously fragmented and complex. A survey by analyst firm BARC and sponsored by Informatica found that data quality and lineage were the most-cited challenges and obstacles to AI, identified by 45% of respondents.\n\nYet, given the growing role that AI has for many organizations, there\u2019s no turning back. My advice is to follow best practices in modern data management, and you will be headed in the right direction\u2014toward trusted data that is well-tuned for AI. Like so much of what we do as stewards for the companies we build and guide, business performance will depend largely on how we handle AI\u2019s opportunities and challenges. That\u2019s why every AI strategy must also be a data strategy.",

We support board members in their oversight role by helping them address complex boardroom issues. Find out more.\nRead more\nBoards can foster robust dialogue by questioning how management is reducing costs in a targeted way and reinvesting capital to develop capabilities to support growth. Through rigorous oversight of the portfolio review process, boards can press management on how it evaluates underperforming business units or non-strategic assets. They can support divestment actions that free up capital for more profitable ventures and oversee how metrics designed to measure investment decisions impartially are helping CEOs act with confidence.\nMany companies will continue to invest in artificial intelligence (AI) as they move from a multitude of AI use cases to a prioritized set of investments that can be applied at scale to improve value optimization and creation. Notably, two-thirds of directors responding to the survey think management should prioritize AI to capture market opportunities and greater internal efficiencies over mitigating risks. Just one-third said mitigating AI risks should be prioritized even if it reduces speed to market or slows internal process improvements. This imbalance underscores the need for robust debate and constructive deliberation to establish that the board and the management team are aligned on risk appetite with respect to AI investments.\nDirectors will embrace transaction-led transformation, survey responses show. Directors who think their company\u2019s strategy will change over the next three years ranked the pressure to grow via transactions as a top driver of that change, along with increased competition and AI. Deal volume is expected to increase in 2025, underscoring the importance of boards\u2019 overseeing how their companies are optimizing their portfolios to enable agility and capital strength. Further, boards will play an important role in overseeing how companies are truly transforming through capital strategy decisions that may require reimagining the enterprise."

Corporate governance needs to adapt to that change.\nAs a director, your oversight responsibilities have greatly expanded amid this global uncertainty. Even experienced boards can\u2019t always foresee emerging risks like cyber attacks, data loss, regulatory shifts and extreme weather. However, you are rising to the challenge by adding members with essential skills, deepening your understanding of corporate strategy and enhancing governance practices. What hasn\u2019t changed: a commitment to leading the company to a position of strength.\nIn this period of historic change \u2014 marked by rapid shifts in policy and evolving market dynamics \u2014 your role in providing oversight and finding clarity and direction among the noise has never been more critical.\nYou are stepping up with fresh thinking and bold leadership.

While our 2024 Annual Corporate Director Survey finds that almost all respondents believe their boards are capable of guiding their companies through a crisis, previous surveys have found that many companies still do not have a formal escalation plan in place. This suggests an overconfidence that may lead boards to downplay a potential enterprise-level risk or, worse, ignore it altogether. Operational disruptions due to extreme weather, supply chain snarls, cyber attacks or political unrest can occur at any time. A holistic risk management process may not be able to stop a bad actor intent on harming your company, but boards that form a strategy for understanding crises can help their companies be resilient in the face of interconnected risks that are emerging with unprecedented velocity.\nLearn why preparation is key to a company's crisis recovery.
