  "title": "Washington should lower temperature on Taiwan invasion threat, US report says",
  "description": "China said to be \u2018highly unlikely\u2019 to invade the island, according to report.",
  "content": "As the US Congress works to finish its annual defence authorisation bill, with new measures aimed at countering China\u2019s influence, a report released Wednesday argues that Washington would be better served by toning down rhetoric about Taiwan and reducing defence investments premised on a looming Chinese invasion there.\n\nBeijing is \u201chighly unlikely\u201d to invade Taiwan, with its chances of success increasingly improbable, authors of the Stimson Centre report, \u201cRethinking the Threat: Why China is Unlikely to Invade Taiwan\u201d, said.\n\nThe authors, Dan Grazier, MacKenna Rawlins, and James Siebens \u2013 all researchers at the Washington-based think tank \u2013 contend that strategic, political, economic and practical military reasons all argue against it, laying out one of the more comprehensive cases to challenge what they call Washington\u2019s \u201cthreat inflation\u201d.\n\nBeijing sees Taiwan, a self-governed island, as a renegade province to be eventually reunited with the mainland, by force if necessary. Most countries, including the US, do not recognise Taiwan as an independent state, but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take it by force and is committed to arming Taiwan.\n\nIn recent years, Washington has grown increasingly anxious about a mainland takeover of Taiwan. Some warn that Chinese President might use an invasion to divert attention from domestic economic troubles, while others view the People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s of the Taiwan Strait\u2019s median line as signs of growing aggression. These anxieties surfaced in popular culture with last month\u2019s debut of Zero Day Attack, a Taiwanese drama about a fictional PLA assault.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s public that Xi has ordered his military to be capable of invading Taiwan by 2027. The PLA is building the military needed to do it. Training for it every day. And rehearsing for the real deal,\u201d Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said at the Shangri-La Dialogue in May.",

  "summary": "A report by the Stimson Centre suggests that the US should reduce its rhetoric about Taiwan and reduce its defence investments based on a potential invasion by China. The authors argue that Beijing is unlikely to invade Taiwan due to several reasons including strategic, political, economic, and military reasons. They also suggest that the Chinese President, President Xi Jinping, may use an invasion to distract from domestic issues. Most countries, including the US, do not recognise Taiwan as an independent state but are opposed to any attempt to take it by force.",

Despite Beijing\u2019s repeated calls over the years for peaceful reunification the military option has never been taken off the table.\nThe People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) \u2013 so named by the Communist Party as a reference to its seizure of cities during the conflict \u2013 has been increasingly active around Taiwan.\nWith Lai now six months into his term, a tally by the Post, based on the almost-daily figures released by the island\u2019s defence ministry, has revealed how the PLA turned up its pressure on the island since Lai was sworn in in May.\nThe analysis, which examined tracking data from the past 18 months, showed that the PLA has deployed more aircraft, increasingly closer to the island, with a higher number of sorties, and a higher percentage of those sorties, crossing the median line that divides the Taiwan Strait."
