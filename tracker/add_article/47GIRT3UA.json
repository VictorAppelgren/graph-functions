Job openings fell to a 10‑month low and unemployment exceeded job openings for the first time since the pandemic, raising uncertainty over Fed policy. Meanwhile, China’s yuan has strengthened sharply against the dollar, a deliberate policy move that may signal Beijing’s willingness to negotiate with Washington amid trade tensions.",
