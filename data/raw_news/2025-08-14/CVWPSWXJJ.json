  "content": "Paramount president Jeff Shell said upcoming job cuts at the newly-formed media giant will be \u201cpainful\u201d \u2013 but they will also be quick.\n\nThe former NBC Universal executive, who was tapped by David Ellison to be his top lieutenant after Paramount\u2019s long stalled $8.4 billion merger with Skydance finally closed last week, expects $2 billion in cuts in one fell swoop.\n\n\u201cWe do not want to be a company that has layoffs every quarter,\u201d Shell said Wednesday in Los Angeles, citing constant waves of cuts under Paramount\u2019s previous leadership.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s going to be painful. It\u2019s always hard, but we don\u2019t want to be a company that every quarter is laying people off. It is important for us to get done what we\u2019re doing in one big thing and then be done with it.\u201d\n\nEllison, the CEO of Paramount Skydance, Shell and other brass touted their vision to revive the flagging company during a press conference last week in New York.\n\nThe son of billionaire Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison said restructuring could \u201cexceed\u201d the $2 billion target, but declined to provide a timeline of when the axe would fall.\n\nHe also said that Paramount\u2019s new executive team doesn\u2019t buy into the idea that a company can be cut into growth \u2013 a statement reiterated at the LA press conference attended by Ellison, Shell, Paramount+ leader Cindy Holland, TV Media boss George Cheeks, film heads Dana Goldberg and Josh Greenstein and Chief Operating Officer Andy Gordon.\n\nEllison has already made some bold moves since taking the reins of Shari Redstone\u2019s media empire.\n\nOn Monday, Paramount announced that it acquired the exclusive rights to show all events from the Ultimate Fighting Championship in the US from TKO Group in what amounts to a $7.7 billion, seven-year deal, beginning in 2026.\n\nThe news helped catapult the company\u2019s stock, which trades under the ticker PSKY, by 37%. On Thursday, it gave back some of those gains, losing 4%, to close at $14.38.",

      "text": "Skydance CEO David Ellison feels the heat, melts down while taking questions as \u2018new Paramount\u2019 press conference goes off the rails\nBudding media mogul David Ellison finally took the reins of the \u201cnew Paramount\u201d on Thursday \u2013 but quickly felt the heat after being grilled about any side deals made with President Trump to get the stalled merger across the finish line.\nThe Skydance CEO was at Paramount\u2019s headquarters in Times Square to tout his vision as the new chief of the media giant.\nBut the 42-year-old tech scion turned red and stammered, and then refused to answer a question posed by The Post columnist Charlie Gasparino, who asked about the status of a reported $20 million in MAGA ads that Skydance agreed to run on top of Paramount\u2019s $16 million settlement with President Trump.\nGasparino was first to report the so-called side agreement by Ellison\u2019s legal team to run PSAs once Skydance took over the company.\nIt was later touted by Trump as an integral part of the multi-million settlement that involved alleged biased editing of a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris during the heat of the 2024 presidential campaign.\n\u201cWe were not involved in the settlement in any way,\u201d Ellison said. When asked if that was a no comment, Ellison shrugged off the question and moved on to the Q&A with other journalists.\n\u201cI think you know, very clear that basically, we complied with all the laws, including the anti-bribery laws,\u201d he added, citing Skydance\u2019s July 29 reply to three US senators who had inquired about the company\u2019s involvement with the Paramount-Trump settlement.\nThe CEO said they were focused on \u201cdriving the business forward\u201d and \u201cfocusing on the future,\u201d before he was asked again whether he had a deal with Trump to give him $20 million of advertising airtime.\n\u201cLook, we are not going to politicize anything today like that,\u201d he said, before he began to stammer. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 I\u2019m not going to do that today. You know, one of the things we\u2019re really excited about, about this company, is that we actually make movies and tell stories, we believe that if you\u2019re breathing, you\u2019re our audience, and we want to entertain first, to entertain everyone.\u201d\nEllison\u2019s reticence came as sources told The Post the new company, called Paramount Skydance Corp., remains under FCC investigation over \u201cwoke\u201d management policies and alleged bias at Paramount-owned CBS News.\nFCC chair Brendan Carr, who signed off on the merger after intense scrutiny, looks to apply pressure on Ellison to make good on his promise to end diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and left-wing bias at CBS, sources close to the situation said.\nThe White House also wants Ellison to make good on promise to run the pro-MAGA public services ads, the sources added.\nEllison brushed off questions about whether Bari Weiss would join CBS News or whether the new company would acquire her start-up, The Free Press, after the two were reportedly spotted chatting it up at the Allen & Co. powwow in Sun Valley, Idaho, last month.\nPrior to the merger getting the thumbs-up from the FCC, Skydance agreed to install an ombudsman at CBS News to review \u201ccomplaints of bias or other concerns.\u201d\nFormer NBCUniversal boss Jeff Shell, who takes over as president, said that the ombudsman is \u201cmeant to be a transparency vehicle.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not being overseen by the FCC or anybody else,\u201d Shell said. \u201cBut we do believe in transparency in the news division and frankly in every other business that we are in.\u201d\nThe merger puts an end to media heiress Shari Redstone\u2019s ties to a company forged by her late legendary father, Sumner Redstone.\nAs part of the deal, Larry Ellison, Skydance and Gerry Cardinale\u2019s RedBird Capital purchased the Redstone family\u2019s controlling 77% stake in Paramount Global through their company National Amusements.\nRedstone will receive $180 million in severance and other benefits on top of her stock, and will exit the board of directors. Her 20% stake in National Amusements will reportedly fetch her about an additional $350 million.\nOverall, Skydance agreed to fork over $2.4 billion for the Redstone family\u2019s stake, $4.5 billion to non-NAI Paramount shareholders and an additional $1.5 billion in new capital to help pay down debt and recapitalize the company\u2019s balance sheet, the company said.\n\u201cWe embark on the exciting next chapter of this legendary company,\u201d David Ellison said to kick off the press conference.\nThe new publicly traded company, which will be listed under the symbol PSKY, combines Paramount\u2019s struggling legacy brands like CBS and MTV, its Paramount+ streaming service, and prized film and TV library, with Skydance\u2019s production and technological capabilities.\nSkydance Paramount will be restructured into three divisions: studios, direct-to-consumer and TV media.\n\u201cMoving forward, we will work with conviction and optimism to transform Paramount into a tech-forward company that blends the creative heart of Hollywood with the innovative spirit of Silicon Valley,\u201d David Ellison told the assembled media.\nParamount had also faced heat after pulling the plug on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d days after the merger was approved.\nThe company said it will axe the show next May for financial reasons. The top-rated late-night program reportedly lost $50 million last year, The Post previously reported.\nMeanwhile, Ellison said that he would stand by the embattled news division, which is home to last-place shows \u201cCBS Mornings\u201d and \u201cCBS Evening News.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re obviously going to be fierce defenders of our talent,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cWe always have been.\u201d\nHe also gave a shout-out to \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d which he said has \u201ca long tradition of impactful reporting led by seasoned journalists committed to accuracy, integrity and public trust.\u201d\nShell said the company is having discussions with many news execs to come onboard after rumors swirled about Sky News executive chairman David Rhodes potentially joining the company and retaking his old job as CBS News president."

Her jeans. Her story. We\u2019ll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way. Great jeans look good on everyone.\u201d\nThe Post has sought comment from Sweeney and American Eagle."

All of the UFC\u2019s events will now be accessible with only a Paramount+ subscription in the U.S., and select numbered events will also air on CBS.\n\u201cThis historic deal with Paramount and CBS is incredible for UFC fans and our athletes,\u201d UFC president Dana White said in a statement. \u201cFor the first time ever, fans in the U.S. will have access to all UFC content without a Pay-Per-View model, making it more affordable and accessible to view the greatest fights on a massive platform. This deal puts UFC amongst the biggest sports in the world. The exposure provided by the Paramount and CBS networks under this new structure is a huge win for our athletes and anyone who watches and loves this sport.\u201d\nESPN, UFC\u2019s current rightsholder, has been using a pay-per-view model, which TKO Group president Mark Shapiro called \u201ca thing of the past.\u201d\nESPN and Disney owned UFC\u2019s rights for the last five years while paying an average of $500 million per year.\nThe deal with Disney expires at the end of this year.\nWith the Skydance-Paramount deal closing this past Thursday, TKO Group \u2014 which owns the UFC and WWE \u2014 was able to come to an agreement rather quickly, according to CEO David Ellison, who spoke to the Financial Times.\nParamount and CBS have had a longstanding relationship with the NFL, and this deal should continue to bring mixed martial arts to the forefront of sports programming.\n\u201cWhen you look at the incredible portfolio of sports that Paramount has with the NFL, Uefa, Masters and March Madness, there really was a lull in the summer, and now with the UFC, we really do have a very strong year-long sports offering on both Paramount+ and CBS,\u201d Ellison told the Financial Times.\nCBS will air the Super Bowl in 2028, when they will be in year two of their deal with the UFC.\nThere was talk earlier this year of UFC potentially linking up with Netflix, not to mention a possible ESPN renewal.\nIn addition to the U.S. rights of UFC, Paramount is said to be \u201cinterested in buying UFC\u2019s international rights,\u201d according to CNBC.\nThe UFC deal comes days after WWE landed a five-year, $1.6 billion deal with ESPN to have their premium live events streamed on their new direct-to-consumer app."

      "text": "Hertz customers charged for minor damages by AI scanners can fight back using these phone apps\nRental car drivers are arming themselves with new AI-powered apps to fend any bogus charges from the growing use of the same technology by major companies like Hertz and Sixt.\nOne such application, Proofr, launched last month, offers users the ability to create their own digital evidence.\n\u201cIt eliminates the \u2018he said, she said\u2019 disputes with rental car companies by giving users a tamper-proof, AI-powered before-and-after damage scan in seconds,\u201d Proofr CEO Eric Kuttner told The Post.\nBoth Sixt and Hertz have recently faced backlash from renters who accused the companies of sideswiping them with outrageous charges for minor damages \u2014 including one Hertz renter who claimed being slapped with $440 penalty for a one-inch scuff on one of the car\u2019s wheels.\nProofr\u2019s system not only identifies scratches and dents but also timestamps, geotags and securely stores the images to prevent alteration.\n\u201cBecause AI is now being used against consumers by rental companies to detect damage, Proofr levels the playing field,\u201d Kuttner told The Post.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the easiest way to protect yourself from surprise damage bills that can run into the thousands all for less than the average person spends on coffee monthly.\u201d\nThe service costs $9.90 per month, with a three-day free trial available for new users.\nThe technology powering Proofr relies on sophisticated image analysis.\nAccording to Kuttner, the company employs \u201ca state of the art AI image analysis pipeline to detect and log even subtle damage changes between photo sets.\u201d\nEach scan undergoes encryption, receives a timestamp and gets locked to the specific location to ensure authenticity.\nThe system\u2019s AI models have been trained using thousands of real-world images to improve accuracy.\nEarly adopters have already successfully used the app to challenge damage claims.\nDespite launching only recently, Kuttner noted that users have won disputes against what they considered unfair charges, though the company remains relatively unknown to the broader public.\nAnother player in this space, Ravin AI, has taken a different approach after initially working with rental companies.\nThe company previously partnered with Avis in 2019 and Hertz in 2022 during early experiments with AI inspections.\nHowever, Ravin has since shifted its focus toward insurance companies and dealerships, currently working with IAG, the largest insurance firm in Australia and New Zealand.\nRavin\u2019s founder and CEO, Eliron Ekstein, told The Drive that the company\u2019s pivot away from rental partnerships stemmed partly from concerns about customer treatment.\n\u201cWhen you work for a car rental company, if you go about this in the wrong way, then you\u2019re actually going against their interests. Because you\u2019re going against their customers in the end,\u201d Ekstein told The Drive.\n\u201cAnd we quickly realized that if we maximize our proceeds in that business, we\u2019re actually going against their customers and themselves at the end of the day.\u201d\nThe recent wave of customer complaints about AI-generated damage claims prompted Ravin to make its technology freely available to consumers through a demo on its homepage.\nThe system, trained on two billion images over ten years, allows users to scan their vehicles and receive reports documenting any differences between before and after photos.\nEkstein believes rental agencies are currently charging excessive fees for minor blemishes to \u201cjustify the cost\u201d of their scanning equipment.\nHe pointed to ProovStation\u2019s marketing language, which promises to turn \u201croutine inspections into gold mines of untapped opportunities,\u201d as evidence of this profit-focused approach.\nHertz and Sixt have begun implementing automated vehicle inspection systems from companies like UVeye and ProovStation at multiple locations, with other rental agencies watching closely.\nThese AI scanners detect damage without human review, potentially flagging every minor imperfection on returned vehicles.\nTesting of these consumer apps reveals both promise and limitations. The Drive\u2019s evaluation found Ravin\u2019s system missed two obvious paint chips while incorrectly identifying a reflection as minor damage.\nSimilarly, Proofr\u2019s app, while featuring an attractive interface, experienced repeated crashes during image saving, according to The Drive.\nThese issues highlight ongoing challenges in the technology, particularly regarding photo conditions and lighting.\n\u201cWho takes the image, what time, [and] what angle\u201d can dramatically affect results, Ekstein acknowledged, noting that environmental factors remain one of the biggest obstacles for accurate damage detection.\nDespite these limitations, Ekstein stressed the importance of transparency in damage claims.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go after scuffs \u2014 that goes against the whole service culture of those companies,\u201d he told The Drive.\nHe argued that rental companies should only pursue claims for substantial damage costing at least $700 to repair, and customers should receive detailed repair estimates rather than flat fees.\nKuttner frames this technological shift as a pivotal moment.\n\u201cWe believe this is a turning point for AI moving from something that works for companies to something that works for everyone,\u201d he told The Post.\nThe Post has sought comment from Hertz, Sixt, UVeye and ProovStation."
