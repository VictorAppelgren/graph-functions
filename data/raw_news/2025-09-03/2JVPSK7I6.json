  "title": "FirstClub bucks India\u2019s speed obsession, quickly triples valuation to $120M with premium approach",
  "description": "FirstClub has raised $23 million in a Series A round co-led by Accel and RTP Global to expand its premium quick commerce platform.",
  "content": "While quick commerce in India has become synonymous with 10-minute deliveries \u2014 and the hottest play for startups and investors \u2014 FirstClub is taking a slower, more curated route. Yet just three months after launching its app, the eight-month-old startup has tripled its valuation. At a post-money valuation of $120 million, the Bengaluru-based startup has raised $23 million in a Series A round (comprising more than 90% equity and the rest in debt) co-led by returning investors Accel and RTP Global. The round also saw participation from Blume Founders Fund, 2am VC, Paramark Ventures, and Aditya Birla Ventures. This new funding comes just eight months after FirstClub raised its $8 million seed round at a $40 million valuation in December. E-commerce in India \u2014 the world\u2019s second-largest shopper base \u2014 has surged to approximately $60 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV) and is expected to grow at 18% annually, reaching $170\u2013$190 billion by 2030, per a recent Bain & Company report. Nearly one in every ten retail dollars in India is projected to be spent online by the end of the decade. Over the past few months, the market has shifted from traditional e-commerce, where deliveries typically took two to three days, to ultra-fast fulfillment \u2014 chiefly driven by the rise of quick-commerce startups. This shift has even prompted incumbents like Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart to enter the fray with their own rapid delivery offerings. However, FirstClub sees a gap: rather than racing to be the fastest, the startup is betting on quality. It is targeting the top 10% of Indian households \u2014 roughly 20 million of them \u2014 with premium products and a curated experience. Launched in June, the startup currently serves customers in a few localities of Bengaluru with four dark stores, which it calls \u201cclubhouses.\u201d Dark stores are fulfillment centers that look like retail stores but serve only online orders. The company stocks over 4,000 curated stock-keeping units from brands across packaged foods, fresh produce, bakery, dairy, and nutrition. \u201cBased the last three months\u2019 data, it\u2019s quite clear that consumers are happy to wait if they are getting a very differentiated selection, a good quality of products, a differentiated service, and a very hand-holding sort of an experience,\u201d said Ayyappan R, founder and CEO of FirstClub, in an interview. The startup currently sees an average order value of \u20b91,050 (approximately $12) \u2014 about twice that of leading quick-commerce platforms when delivering groceries \u2014 along with a 60% repeat purchase rate, the executive told TechCrunch.\n\nThe founder hit the ground running with experience under his belt. Before founding FirstClub in December, Ayyappan spent over a decade at Flipkart, India\u2019s largest homegrown e-commerce company, where he led teams at its subsidiaries Myntra (a fashion e-commerce site) and Cleartrip (a travel booking site). He was previously part of the team at Indian consumer goods giant ITC, focusing on strategies to expand grocery market and outlet coverage. Those experiences helped him quickly turn FirstClub from a concept into a business. \u201cIn a span of six months, we have been able to build an end-to-end tech platform,\u201d he recalled. The startup has also established its own supply chain network and partnered with select brands to offer exclusive products. Currently, 60% of the products on its platform are exclusive. \u201cWe are not indexing on the delivery speed, but we are saying that the products you get here, you would not find elsewhere, whether it is offline or online,\u201d Ayyappan told TechCrunch. FirstClub has also hired a third-party consumer panel to test products that will be featured on its platform. \u201cIf I take an example of, say, paneer (cottage cheese in Hindi), 20 products from very, very different brands of paneer are tested by this consumer panel, which is done as a blind test, and whatever comes as the best, the top-three products, these will get onto the platform,\u201d the founder stated. The startup began its journey with grocery as the first category. It found that while the competition is quite intense in this space, with most quick commerce companies, including Blinkit and Swiggy\u2019s Instamart, offering groceries through their platforms, there is room for a differentiated selection of premium-quality items, Ayyappan said. FirstClub aims to expand beyond groceries into new categories, including children\u2019s food, pet food, and nutraceuticals. It is venturing into cafes in the next 30 days, Ayyappan told TechCrunch, with a differentiated approach that will not include preheated food but instead freshly made items. The startup also plans to enter the home and general merchandise categories within the next six months. This will include home decor, home essentials, home care, furnishing, and even utensils, the founder said. FirstClub\u2019s customer base is 70% women. As a result, the company not only curates products tailored to them but is also expanding into categories most relevant to their needs. Sharing more customer insights, Ayyappan told TechCrunch that FirstClub\u2019s customers are primarily in the income bracket of \u20b91.5 million (around $17,000) annual household income. The startup prevents customers from checking out if their cart value is under \u20b9199 (roughly $2.40) to select the right customers. Further, the app is designed for a browser-led experience rather than a search-led one, which is typical of most quick commerce platforms. This approach encourages users to spend more time exploring options, improving retention and enabling the startup to deliver a curated experience based on customer insights. The startup has also banned from its supply chain products containing over 200 ingredients that can harm consumers, the founder said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019ll offer a large selection and let the consumer choose what they want,\u2019 versus the platform taking ownership \u2014 saying every single product it sells has to be top-notch quality,\u201d Ayyappan noted. FirstClub essentially wants to bring the kind of experience that retailers like Costco, Whole Foods, Trader Joe\u2019s, and TJ Maxx offer in North America, the founder stated. \u201cWe want to be present to the consumers across multiple channels and multiple platforms,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably a slotted delivery, subscription delivery, offline, so all of these would come into the picture as well.\u201d With the fresh funding, the startup also plans to expand its clubhouses to up to 35, covering most of Bengaluru this year, before entering a new city. \u201cWe might invite the consumers to our clubhouses as well to showcase this is how hygienic [they are], and this is how we maintain the quality,\u201d Ayyappan said. The startup currently has a headcount of 185 employees, including a 75-person operational staff.",

The deliberations are ongoing and the timeline may slightly change, the source cautioned.\nA Flipkart spokesperson said the Bengaluru-headquartered e-commerce firm is \u201ccommitted to meeting evolving customer expectations and delivering excellence in value, selection and speed, with more initiatives expected on this front in the coming months.\u201d\nFlipkart, valued at over $30 billion, has been steadily laying the groundwork to improve its delivery time for quite a while. It has heavily invested in its supply chain infrastructure over the years, with a particular focus on reducing delivery times for grocery items. These efforts have allowed Flipkart to offer same-day and next-day delivery options.\nThe new foray comes at a time when Flipkart is also exploring the possibility of acquiring the instant-delivery startup Dunzo, TechCrunch reported last month. The overarching ownership of Reliance on Dunzo has complicated the conversations, however, the report added.\nFlipkart\u2019s interest in quick-commerce coincides with the ambitious expansion plans of instant-commerce players such as Swiggy, Zepto, and Zomato\u2019s BlinkIt. These companies are aggressively widening their product offerings, venturing beyond grocery delivery to include a diverse range of items, from daily essentials to electronic gadgets, in a bid to capture a larger slice of India\u2019s burgeoning e-commerce pie.\n\u201cWe view these potential developments as increasing the relevance of the quick commerce market and a validation that the quick commerce model is working well,\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note Thursday, reacting to this TechCrunch story. \u201cThat said, we believe this market could remain relatively more competitive than food delivery.\u201d\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

      "text": "Report\nExecutive summary\nIndia has become a retail powerhouse over the last decade, ascending to the third largest retail market globally in 2024. The Indian e-retail market has surged to approximately $60 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV), boasting the world\u2019s second-largest online shopper base.\nIndia\u2019s consumption and discretionary spending have faced headwinds in recent years, with private consumption growth slowing from 11% pre-Covid (2017\u201319) to ~8% post-Covid (2022\u201324). This decline is driven by higher inflation and a stagnation of real wages. The stress in consumption is evident in e-retail growth in 2024 being 10%\u201312%, compared to historical growth rates of over 20%.\nHowever, the recent fiscal and monetary policy interventions are expected to drive a rebound in e-retail growth, especially from the festive period of 2025, on account of revival in the consumption cycle. Long-term market fundamentals remain robust, with e-retail projected to exceed 18% growth over the next six years, reaching an estimated $170\u2013$190 billion in GMV, with nearly 1 in 10 retail dollars spent on e-retail by 2030. This growth will be fueled by increased discretionary spending as India\u2019s per capita GDP surpasses $3,500\u2013$4,000\u2014a crucial tipping point unlocking discretionary and e-retail spending globally. States in India with per capita GDP above $3,500 already exhibit 1.2 times higher e-retail penetration than other regions.\nHigh-frequency categories such as grocery, lifestyle, and general merchandise will drive e-retail growth, accounting for two out of every three dollars spent on e-retail by 2030. These categories are set to see a two- to fourfold increase in e-retail penetration over this period.\nGrowth will continue to reshape India\u2019s shopping landscape. User adoption is already spreading from Tier-2 to Tier-3 cities, with three in five new shoppers since 2020 coming from cities designated Tier-3 or smaller. This growth is unlocking access for consumers in remote, brand-starved areas, as evidenced by the 1.2 times higher e-retail shopper penetration in the Northeast compared to the rest of India. The seller base is also diversifying, with 60% of new sellers since 2021 hailing from Tier-2 or smaller cities.\nWritten in collaboration with\nWritten in collaboration with\nThree disruptions\u2014quick commerce, trend-first commerce (especially in fashion), and hyper-value commerce\u2014will define the next chapter of growth. Each of these models is at a different level of maturity. Together, their evolution will shape the future of India\u2019s e-retail landscape.\nQuick commerce (Q-commerce; less than 30-minute delivery): Q-commerce is revolutionizing how consumers buy in India, with over two-thirds of all e-grocery orders and a tenth of overall e-retail dollars spent on these platforms. Indian q-commerce players have bucked global trends and scaled profitably. India\u2019s unique structural advantages, including high population density and close access to a network of low-rent dark stores, have enabled this growth. Q-commerce has since attracted multiple players, which has made the consumer value proposition richer.\nQ-commerce is projected to grow at over 40% annually through 2030, driven by expansion across categories, geographies, and customer segments. While q-commerce began with grocery, 15%\u201320% of its GMV now comes from categories such as general merchandise, mobile phones, electronics, and apparel. Expansion beyond major cities has also fueled growth, though the top six metros still account for the lion\u2019s share of GMV.\nQ-commerce players have improved unit economics by increasing order values, lowering supply chain costs, and enhancing gross margins (via direct sourcing from producers and farmers, and deploying monetization levers such as advertising and platform fees). However, to sustain profitable growth, companies must adapt their business models for markets beyond major metros, manage rising competition, and optimize supply chains as the market evolves into a two-speed proposition\u2014offering select products in under 15 minutes and a wider assortment within an hour.\nTrend-first commerce (frequent launches of trendy collections at affordable prices): This model is rapidly gaining momentum in India. Trend-first fashion alone is expected to grow fourfold, reaching approximately $8 to $10 billion by 2028, with more than half of this revenue from online sales. Interestingly, this model is also quickly expanding beyond fashion, with the role of trendy assortment expanding in categories such as beauty (e.g., Korean glass skin routine), electronics (e.g., vibrantly colored smartwatches), and luggage.\nIndia\u2019s unique demographics\u2014with a large base of young, value-conscious consumers who are active on social media\u2014position it perfectly for the trend-first commerce boom. The rapidly expanding influencer and supplier ecosystems will only further accelerate this growth.\nGlobally, trend-first fashion has thrived by following a tech-driven, repeatable playbook involving four key components: (1) investing in social media to target Gen Z; (2) offering hyper-trendy, low-priced collections with daily launches driven by advanced trend-spotting algorithms; (3) utilizing a test-and-scale model to quickly introduce and restock popular styles; and (4) providing a bespoke user experience that emphasizes novelty and rewards user engagement.\nIn India, multiple players are looking to capture a slice of this market. Offline brands such as Zudio (by Trent), H&M, and Zara have successfully offered a compelling \u201ctrends-first\u201d proposition to Indian consumers. Meanwhile, online platforms, such as Flipkart Spoyl, Myntra Fwd and Shein, along with emerging brands like Urbanic, Snitch, and NewMe, are also looking to win over Gen Z consumers and trend-savvy millennials.\nHyper-value commerce (ultra-low price assortment): Hyper-value commerce has seen a global surge, exemplified by the success of Temu in the US, which accounted for roughly half of all American e-retail app downloads within a year of launch. Temu\u2019s 55\u201360 million monthly active users were just shy of Amazon\u2019s 65\u201370 million US users as of January 2025, with GMV having grown at over 40% annually to between $14\u2013$16 billion by the end of 2024.\nIn India, hyper-value commerce\u2019s contribution to e-retail has scaled from around 5% of e-retail GMV in 2021 to more than 12% in 2024. These platforms have gained strong traction among lower-middle-income consumers, particularly in Tier-2 or smaller cities, by focusing on an affordable product assortment. Additionally, these platforms have rapidly expanded their seller base by offering seller financing and zero-commission models.\nIndia\u2019s e-retail market, akin to the broader retail landscape, is diverse, with purchase behavior varying dramatically by age, region, city tier, and e-retail maturity:\n- Age: The gradual rise of Gen Z (born between 1997\u20132012), accounting for almost 40% of e-retail shoppers, has been the most salient shift in India\u2019s shopper base. Gen Z shopper behavior stands out. Gen Z split their shopping basket, with half of them shopping from over five e-retail platforms annually; these shoppers are also more experimental, spending three times more on insurgent fashion brands vs. older cohorts. Heavily influenced by social media, 70% of Gen Z shoppers discover brands online and make quicker purchase decisions, browsing fewer search listings than millennials before buying. Over 90% of Gen Z digital transactors prefer Unified Payment Interface (UPI) for digital payments. A rise in Gen Z income and the addition of more Gen Z to the workforce will make it a crucial cohort for brands to solve for.\n- Region: Socioeconomic and cultural factors influence consumer behavior across India\u2019s diverse regions. In the North, brands are often associated with status, which is evident in the higher share of branded searches in men\u2019s fashion. Conversely, in the South, shoppers view brands as markers of quality, manifesting in more branded searches in electronics. There are numerous examples of these regional distinctions. For instance, consumers in the North gravitate toward trendier styles, like boot-cut jeans and bold hair colors, whereas consumers in the Northeast demand smaller apparel sizes, reflecting petite body frames. Shopping behavior also varies within a few hundred kilometers within a region, or even within a few kilometers within a city, influenced by urbanization, affluence, and cultural factors. In Rajasthan\u2019s eastern districts, close to student hubs such as Kota and Jaipur, sports footwear is more popular, whereas casual footwear prevails in southern districts. Similarly, in Bengaluru, younger residents in Koramangala favor party snacks and ready-to-eat products, while neighborhoods like JP Nagar and Banashankari show a different consumption profile.\n- City tier: Shoppers in Tier-2+ cities show comparable spending power to bigger cities, with average selling prices being in line or only marginally lower in categories such as electronics, appliances, and general merchandise. Shoppers from these cities are also increasingly embracing premium brands and attributes. Interestingly, shoppers in smaller cities often view sponsored listings as a marker for quality. Retailers must adapt their strategies to cater to the growing consumer base in these cities that values both affordability and quality.\n- E-retail maturity: Mature markets such as Coimbatore and Vadodara, marked by high e-retail penetration and affluence, see about 40% higher e-retail spend per shopper compared to nascent markets such as Prayagraj and Warangal. Consumers from these markets favor premium products, with 10%\u201325% higher average selling price across categories vs. nascent markets. These shoppers also display a stronger preference for insurgent brands.\nThese differences in purchase behavior indicate massive opportunity for retailers. Brands and sellers can harness the diversity of consumer preferences across India by (1) tailoring their range and assortment to reflect regional variation in features and price points; (2) creating products that align with emerging trends (e.g., Korean-inspired fashion) and market whitespaces; (3) using targeted e-retail advertising (display and search) to enhance brand awareness and drive sales; and (4) improving conversion by focusing on ratings and reviews, offering faster delivery options, and enhancing catalogs.\nE-retail market overview\n- India\u2019s e-retail market has scaled to an impressive ~$60 billion in 2024. Notably, with over 270 million Indians shopping online in 2024, India has pipped the US to become the second-largest e-retail market in terms of online shoppers.\n- The e-retail market growth has slowed down to 10%\u201312% in 2024 vs. more than 20% seen historically, largely due to macroeconomic and consumption stress. Consumption growth has declined from approximately 11% pre-Covid (2017\u201319) to approximately 8% post-Covid (2022\u201324), a change caused by inflationary pressure and stagnating real wages.\n- Despite near-term macroeconomic headwinds, the long-term prospects remain strong. The e-retail market is expected to scale to $170\u2013$190 billion by 2030, growing at over 18% annually. Nearly 1 in 10 retail dollars is projected to be spent on e-retail by 2030, fueled by an uptick in discretionary spending as India\u2019s GDP per capita crosses the crucial $3,500\u2013$4,000 threshold, a key tipping point observed in e-retail spending globally.\n- Categories with high purchase frequency, such as grocery, lifestyle, and general merchandise, are set to contribute around 70% of incremental growth, with penetration levels expected to climb two to four times from current levels.\n- E-retail continues to democratize the shopping landscape in India. E-retail penetration has expanded from Tier-2 cities to Tier-3 and smaller cities. Almost 60% of new customers since 2020 hail from Tier-3 and smaller cities. The seller landscape is also evolving, with over 60% of new sellers onboarded since 2021 from Tier-2 and smaller cities.\nDisruption in e-retail\nThree disruptive business models\u2014quick commerce, trend-first commerce, and hyper-value commerce\u2014are changing the tapestry of India\u2019s e-retail market:\n- The dramatic rise of quick commerce (i.e., delivery in less than 30 minutes) has been one of the most defining hallmarks of India\u2019s e-retail market over the last two years. In 2024, more than two-thirds of all e-grocery orders and one-tenth of e-retail spend happened on q-commerce platforms. Q-commerce is forecasted to grow by over 40% annually until 2030, fueled by expansion across categories, geographies, and customer segments. Players have also unlocked a profitable model to scale up through a blend of customer-facing and back-end initiatives. The space is also becoming more competitive, with new entrants such as Flipkart Minutes, Myntra\u2019s M-now, BigBasket\u2019s BB Now, and Amazon\u2019s Tez joining the race.\n- Trend-first commerce (i.e., frequent launch of trendy assortment at affordable prices) has picked up the pace, particularly in fashion. Trend-first fashion is expected to quadruple to $8\u2013$10 billion by 2028, with more than half the spends online. Globally, trend-first fashion players, such as Shein and Fashion Nova, have scaled through a tech-driven repeatable playbook involving leveraging social media to target Gen Z, offering hyper-trendy, affordable collections, deploying test-and-scale models to launch and replenish popular styles, and delivering an engaging user experience. India\u2019s vast base of young, value-conscious, social-media-savvy shoppers will fuel this boom. However, the influencer ecosystem and local manufacturing capabilities will have to evolve further to enable the model to realize full potential.\n- Hyper-value commerce (i.e., offering a wide range of ultra-low price point assortments) has witnessed a surge globally, as evidenced by the success of Temu in the US. Within a year of launch, the app amassed nearly half of e-retail app downloads and currently boasts 55\u201360 million monthly active users, closely trailing Amazon\u2019s 65\u201370 million in the US, as of January 2025. In India, hyper-value commerce platforms\u2019 share of e-retail GMV has surged over the last three years to reach 12%\u201315%. Players have gained traction with lower-middle-income consumers, especially in Tier-2 and smaller cities, due to affordable product offerings. These platforms have also rapidly onboarded sellers by offering attractive growth with a zero-commission model and seller financing.\nWinning in \u201cmany Indias\u201d\nIndia\u2019s e-retail landscape is heterogeneous, reflecting \u201cmany Indias.\u201d Variations in purchase behavior exist across age, region, city tier, and e-retail maturity:\n- The scale-up of e-retail spend by Gen Z (born between 1997 and 2012) has been particularly notable. Representing 40% of India\u2019s e-retail shoppers, Gen Z boasts 1.5 times the e-retail spend share on categories such as lifestyle, beauty, and electronics compared to other age groups. Gen Z has a distinct shopping behavior\u2014they are more experimental, rely heavily on social media for brand discovery, make faster purchase decisions, and show a marked preference for UPI for digital payments.\n- E-retail spending patterns vary widely across regions, shaped by deep-rooted socioeconomic and cultural differences. For instance, North India leans toward trendier fashion while the Northeast sees higher demand for smaller apparel sizes due to generally petite body frames. These nuances can be observed within a few hundred kilometers in a region or even within a few kilometers in a city, influenced by varying catchment-level demographics and affluence.\n- E-retail spending of shoppers in Tier-2 and smaller cities is broadly at par with that of Metro/Tier-1 cities, with similar or only slightly lower average selling prices across categories. These shoppers are also showing a growing interest in premium brands and features. This growth is driven by faster delivery options, cash-on-delivery availability, and e-retail ads serving as indicators of quality.\n- E-retail purchase behavior also varies based on e-retail maturity. In mature cities characterized by high e-retail penetration and affluence, the e-retail spend per shopper is around 40% more than in nascent cities. Shoppers in these cities show a strong preference for premium brands and attributes, with average selling prices elevated by 10%\u201325% across categories. They also demonstrate greater adoption of insurgent brands across categories.\nBrands and sellers can capitalize on the nuances of \u201cmany Indias\u201d by (a) adapting their product range and assortment, (b) developing new products aligned with evolving trends and market whitespaces, (c) leveraging targeted e-retail advertising (display and search) to improve brand awareness and kick-start a growth flywheel, and (d) enhancing conversion by building a critical mass of ratings, offering faster delivery options, and optimizing product catalogs."

      "text": "Even as quick commerce is slowly fading in many markets and several heavily funded startups have folded shop in the past two years, India is emerging as a striking outlier where the model \u2014 of delivering items to customers in 10 to 20 minutes \u2014 appears to be working.\nIndia\u2019s quick commerce market has witnessed a staggering tenfold growth between 2021 and 2023, fueled by the sector\u2019s ability to cater to the distinct needs of urban consumers seeking convenience for unplanned, small-ticket purchases. Despite this rapid expansion, however, quick commerce has only captured a modest 7% of the potential market, with a total addressable market (TAM) estimated at $45 billion, surpassing that of food delivery, according to JM Financial.\nThe quick commerce players \u2014 Zomato-owned Blinkit, Swiggy\u2019s Instamart and YC Continuity-backed Zepto \u2014 can reach an estimated 25 million households, who are likely to spend an average of 4,000 to 5,000 rupees ($48 to $60) per month, according to Bank of America.\nThe top players are expected to expand their reach to 45 to 55 cities within the next 3 to 5 years, up from the current 25 cities, BofA added. Regular customers of quick commerce platforms typically order three to four times per month, with retention rates as high as 60% to 65%. Top users, however, make even more frequent transactions, ranging from 30 to 40 times per month, BofA analysts wrote in a note Monday.\n\u201cQuick commerce model had its own challenges in Europe and USA but in India, especially in top markets, product-market fit development was led by users liking the experience when things are delivered faster to them at doorstep,\u201d the analysts wrote. \u201cThese users don\u2019t want to go back to local corner stores and spend 10 to 15 minutes/fuel extra. The usage started from top cities like Bengaluru, Delhi-NCR, Kolkata etc and then has moved to even smaller cities like Indore, Pune, Rajkot etc.\u201d\nZomato\u2019s Blinkit leads the quick commerce market in India, having cornered as much as 46% of the market share by GMV in the quarter that ended in December, according to a separate analysis.\nSwiggy\u2019s Instamart follows with a 27% share; newcomer Zepto has quickly gained ground, securing 21% of the market; and Bigbasket\u2019s BB Now trails with a 7% share, brokerage firm JM Financial said. Reliance Retail\u2013backed Dunzo, which pioneered the quick commerce model in India, has virtually ceded its entire market share to competition.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $600+ before prices rise.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\n\u201cWith more than 10 active players, the space was very competitive a couple of years back,\u201d JM Financial wrote of the quick commerce market in a recent note. \u201cIt appeared that an intense phase of multi-year cash-burn would soon follow. However, contrary to expectations, several players including some well-funded ones folded early in their endeavour. While some faced funding challenges, a few others were affected by structural issues such as lack of product market fit, inability to solve the hyperlocal complexity, inability to build a robust end-to-end supply chain and \u2026 failure to create a strong brand recall.\u201d\nAs quick commerce players vie for a larger slice of the market, the success of their ventures hinges on the development of efficient supply chains. Companies are making substantial investments in dark store operations, streamlining inventory management and establishing direct partnerships with FMCG manufacturers and farmers. By circumventing traditional distribution channels, these firms aim to enhance product quality, expedite delivery times, and boost overall operational efficiency, industry analysts said.\nDark stores, the backbone of quick commerce operations, have significantly expanded their product offerings, now carrying over 6,000 SKUs per store, a substantial increase from the 2,000 to 4,000 SKUs they housed just a few years ago. In contrast, traditional neighborhood kirana stores, which are ubiquitous across Indian cities, towns, and villages, typically stock between 1,000 and 1,500 items, according to JM Financial. Large modern retail stores, on the other hand, offer a much wider selection, with 15,000 to 20,000 items available to customers.\nThere has also been a noticeable surge in average order value among quick commerce players, which has risen to up to 650 rupees ($7.8) from the previous range of 350 to 400 rupees. This increase in average order value sets quick commerce apart from kirana stores, where customers typically spend between Rs 100 and Rs 200 per transaction.\nWhile the convenience offered by quick commerce is undeniable, profitability remains a concern for investors. Blinkit \u2014 which Zomato acquired in 2022 \u2014 aims to achieve adjusted EBITDA break-even by the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, while Zepto has set its sights on EBITDA profitability in 2024. Swiggy\u2019s Instamart is also focusing on profitability, with the parent company indicating that the peak of investments in the business is now behind them. Swiggy turned its food delivery business profitable last year.\nMany of these players are trying to improve their margins by increasingly looking beyond the grocery category. All the top three players today sell consumer electronics items, a category that makes about half of the sales on Flipkart and Amazon India by GMV, according to people familiar with the matter. (So it should not come as a surprise that Flipkart is weighing entering the quick commerce market by as early as May this year.)\nAdditionally, advertising revenues currently account for around 3% to 3.5% of quick commerce platforms\u2019 total revenue and could easily reach 4.5%, primarily driven by direct-to-consumer platforms, BofA said. These platforms are also exploring private label strategies in certain categories, it added."

      "text": "Amazon on Tuesday said it is piloting a quick commerce service in India that will see the U.S. tech giant delivering grocery and other items in 15 minutes or less.\nThe firm is the sixth major entrant in India\u2019s quick-commerce market, which is currently clocking more than $6 billion in annual sales. Zomato-owned BlinkIt, Swiggy, and Nexus-backed Zepto currently dominate the sector in India, which is operational in roughly two dozen cities.\nAmazon said it is initially piloting the service in Bengaluru.\n\u201cOur strategy has always focused on \u2018Selection, Value and Convenience\u2019 and our vision is to build a large profitable business in India,\u201d said Samir Kumar, the new country manager of Amazon India, in a statement.\n\u201cSo, while we focus on implementing our strategy to offer the largest selection at fastest speeds and greatest value to customers in every single pin-code across the country, we are excited to start a pilot to give our customers a choice to get their everyday essentials in 15 min or less.\u201d\nThe quick-commerce model \u2014 delivering items to customers within 10 to 15 minutes \u2014 hasn\u2019t worked in most parts of the world, but it\u2019s increasingly finding success in India, where a range of retailers and internet firms, from food delivery giant Swiggy to online cosmetics platform Nykaa, are gearing up their supply chain ecosystems to accommodate for faster deliveries.\nMyntra, the top fashion e-commerce retailer in India, launched its own pilot of its quick commerce offering in Bengaluru last week. And Flipkart, Amazon\u2019s biggest rival in India, launched its own quick-commerce service in August.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

It\u2019s also one of its biggest moves in the world\u2019s second largest internet market.\nAmazon entered the Indian market a decade ago, investing more than $7.5 billion to build and scale its e-commerce offering. But 10 years on, the Indian e-commerce market has barely made a dent in the overall $1.1 trillion retail market, growing at less than 15% yearly.\nSome industry experts and analysts believe that quick-commerce might be the future of e-commerce in India.\nQuick commerce in India is expected to show exponential growth, with projections from investment firm CLSA indicating a sixfold increase between FY24 and FY27, reaching a total addressable market of $27 billion.\nCurrently representing 3% of the grocery and 1% of the retail market, this segment is expected to expand to 5% and 2%, respectively, within a decade, CLSA said in a report on Tuesday.\nMeanwhile, Amazon has been criticized for being too slow in India. Amazon has not been able to capitalize on white spaces across quick-commerce, smaller towns and categories like apparel, Rahul Malhotra, an analyst at Bernstein, told TechCrunch in a recent interview."

      "text": "Even as quick commerce startups are retreating, consolidating or shutting down in many parts of the world, the model is showing encouraging signs in India. Consumers in urban cities are embracing the convenience of having groceries delivered to their doorstep in just 10 minutes. The companies making those deliveries \u2014 Blinkit, Zepto and Swiggy\u2019s Instamart \u2014 are already charting a path to profitability.\nAnalysts are intrigued by the potential of 10-minute deliveries to disrupt e-commerce. Goldman Sachs recently estimated that Blinkit, which Zomato acquired in 2022 for less than $600 million, is already more valuable than its decacorn food delivery parent firm.\nAs of earlier this year, Blinkit held a 40% share of the quick commerce market, with Swiggy\u2019s Instamart and Zepto close behind, according to HSBC. Flipkart, owned by Walmart, plans to enter the quick commerce space as soon as next month, further validating the industry\u2019s potential.\nInvestors are also showing strong interest in the sector. Zomato boasts a valuation of $19.7 billion despite minimal profitability, processing around 3 million orders a day. In comparison, Chinese giant Meituan, which processes more than 25 times as many orders daily, has a market cap of $93 billion. Zepto, which achieved unicorn status less than a year ago, is finalizing new funding at a valuation exceeding $3 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.\nConsumers are buying the quick commerce convenience, too. According to a recent Bernstein survey, the adoption was highest among millennials aged 18 to 35, with 60% of those in the 18 to 25 age bracket preferring quick commerce platforms over other channels. Even the 36+ age group is adopting digital channels, with over 30% preferring quick commerce.\nWhile India\u2019s rapid urbanization makes it a prime target for quick commerce, the industry\u2019s unique operational model and infrastructure needs could limit its long-term growth and profitability. As competition intensifies, the impact of quick commerce is likely to be felt more acutely by India\u2019s e-commerce giants. But what makes India\u2019s retail market so attractive for quick commerce players, and what challenges lie ahead?\nThe opportunity for quick commerce in India\nIndia\u2019s e-commerce sales stood at $60 billion to $65 billion last year, according to industry estimates. That\u2019s less than half of the sales generated by e-commerce firms on China\u2019s last Singles Day and represents less than 7% of India\u2019s overall retail market of more than $1 trillion.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nReliance Retail, India\u2019s largest retail chain, clocked a revenue of about $36.7 billion in the financial year ending in March, with a valuation standing at $100 billion. The unorganized retail sector \u2014 the neighborhood stores (popularly known as kirana) that dot thousands of Indian cities, towns and villages \u2014 continues to dominate the market.\n\u201cThe market is huge and, on paper, ripe for disruption. Nothing done so far has made a material dent in the industry. This is why any time a new model shows signs of functioning, all stakeholders shower them with love,\u201d said a seasoned entrepreneur who helped build the supply chain for one of the leading retail ventures.\nIn other words, there\u2019s no shortage of room for growth.\nOne of the factors behind the quick commerce\u2019s fast adoption is the similarity it has with the kirana model that has worked in India for decades. Quick commerce firms have devised a new supply chain system, setting up hundreds of unassuming warehouses, or \u201cdark stores,\u201d strategically situated within kilometers of residential and business areas from where large numbers of orders are placed. This allows the firms to make deliveries within minutes of order purchase.\nThis approach differs from that of e-commerce players like Amazon and Flipkart, which have fewer but much larger warehouses in a city, generally situated in localities where rent is cheaper and farther from residential areas.\nThe unique characteristics of Indian households further contribute to the appeal of quick commerce. Indian kitchens typically stock a higher number of SKUs compared to their Western counterparts, necessitating frequent top-up purchases that are better serviced by local stores and quick commerce rather than modern retail. Additionally, limited storage space in most Indian homes makes monthly bulk grocery shopping less practical, and customers tend to favor fresh food purchases, which quick commerce can easily accommodate.\nAccording to Bernstein, quick commerce platforms can price products 10% to 15% cheaper than mom-and-pop stores while maintaining about 15% gross margins due to the removal of intermediaries. Quick commerce dark stores have rapidly expanded their SKU count from 2,000 to 6,000, with plans to further increase it to 10,000 to 12,000. These stores are replenishing their stocks two to three times a day, according to store managers.\nBattling e-commerce\nZepto, Blinkit and Swiggy\u2019s Instamart are increasingly expanding beyond the grocery category, selling a variety of items, including clothing, toys, jewelry, skincare products and electronics. A TechCrunch analysis finds that the majority of items listed by Amazon India in its bestsellers list are available on quick commerce platforms.\nQuick commerce has also become an important distribution channel for major food brands in India. Consumer goods giant Dabur India expects quick commerce to drive 25% to 30% of the company\u2019s sales. Hindustan Unilever, the Indian arm of the U.K.\u2019s Unilever, has identified quick commerce as an \u201copportunity we will not let go.\u201d And for Nestle India, \u201cBlinkit is becoming as important as Amazon.\u201d\nWhile quick commerce doesn\u2019t need to expand beyond the grocery category, which itself is more than a half-trillion-dollar market in India, their expansion into electronics and fashion is likely to be limited. Electronics drive 40% to 50% of all sales on Amazon and Flipkart, according to analyst estimates. If quick commerce can crack this market, it will pose a significant and direct challenge to e-commerce giants. Goldman Sachs estimates that the total addressable market in grocery and non-grocery for quick commerce companies in the top 40-50 cities is about $150 billion.\nHowever, the sale of smartphones and other high-ticket items is more of a gimmick and not something that can be done at a large scale, according to an e-commerce entrepreneur.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense. What quick commerce is good at is forward-commerce. But smartphones and other pricey items tend to have a not-so-insignificant return rate.\u2026 They don\u2019t have the infrastructure to accommodate the reverse-logistics,\u201d he said, requesting anonymity as he is one of the earliest investors in a leading quick commerce firm.\nQuick commerce\u2019s current infrastructure also doesn\u2019t permit the sale of large appliances. This means you cannot purchase a refrigerator, air conditioner, or TV from quick commerce. \u201cBut that\u2019s what some of these firms are suggesting, and analysts are lapping it up,\u201d the investor said.\nFalguni Nayar, founder of skincare platform Nykaa, highlighted at a recent conference that quick commerce is primarily taking share from kirana stores and would not be able to keep as much inventory and assortment as specialty platforms that educate customers.\nThe quick commerce story in India remains an urban phenomenon concentrated in the top 25 to 30 cities. Goldman Sachs wrote in a recent analysis that the demand in smaller cities likely makes it difficult for fresh grocery economics to work.\nE-commerce giant Flipkart will launch its quick commerce service in limited cities as soon as next month, seeing an opportunity to woo customers of Amazon India. The majority of Flipkart\u2019s customers are in smaller Indian cities and towns.\nAmazon \u2014 increasingly scaling down on its investments in e-commerce in India \u2014 has so far shown no interest in quick commerce in the country. The company, which offers same-day delivery for some items to Prime members, has questioned the quality of products from firms making \u201cfast\u201d deliveries in some of its marketing campaigns.\nAs brands increasingly focus on quick commerce as their fastest-growing channel and more consumers embrace the convenience and value proposition of 10-minute deliveries, the stage is set for a fierce battle between quick commerce and e-commerce giants in India."
