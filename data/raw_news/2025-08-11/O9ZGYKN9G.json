  "content": "We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nIf homeowners thought a recent surge in home equity levels had plateaued, a new report released on Monday showed that to be far from the case. Tappable home equity levels hit yet another new high in the second quarter of 2025, according to the August 2025 Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) Mortgage Monitor report. Borrowers entered the third quarter of the year \"with a record $17.8 trillion in total equity, including $11.6 trillion in tappable equity that can be accessed while maintaining a 20% cushion,\" the report stated. \"Roughly 48 million mortgage holders had tappable equity, with the average homeowner holding $213,000 in accessible value.\"\n\nIf you're one of the millions of homeowners with tappable equity \u2013 and also one of the millions of Americans coping with high borrowing costs and inflation-related expenses \u2013 you may be wondering how you can borrow some of this money right now. Fortunately, there are multiple ways to do so, some of which offer the lowest interest rates available right now. Below, we'll break down three cost-effective and reliable ways to borrow home equity now that levels have hit a new high.\n\nStart by seeing how much equity you could borrow with a home equity loan here.\n\nHow to borrow home equity with levels hitting a new high\n\nThere are multiple ways in which homeowners can borrow their home equity, three of which may be particularly advantageous in today's market:\n\nA home equity loan allows homeowners to use their home equity via a lump sum of money, which may be attractive now with home equity amounts so high. Average home equity loan rates are under 8.50% right now, making them materially cheaper than credit cards and personal loans. And, if the funds are used for select projects and home renovations, owners may be eligible to deduct the interest paid on the loan from their taxes for the years in which the funds were used. Just avoiding overborrowing now, too, as your home is collateral in these exchanges, and you could risk foreclosure if you're unable to make payments as agreed to.\n\nSee what home equity loan rate offers you'd be eligible for now.\n\nA home equity line of credit (HELOC) operates as a mix between a home equity loan and a credit card. Instead of the lump sum of money the loan provides, the HELOC functions as a revolving line of credit in which you'll only be responsible for payments on the amount utilized, not the full line of credit you've been approved for.\n\nCurrently, HELOC rates are just around 8%, making them one of the least expensive ways to borrow money, not just in the home equity climate but overall. HELOCs also have the same tax benefits that home equity loans do, but home equity loans have fixed interest rates and HELOCs have variable ones that are subject to change based on market conditions, although that could be an advantage now, ahead of predicted rate cuts later this year.\n\nGenerally only available for homeowners age 62 and older, this unique home equity borrowing option comes with a distinct advantage in that repayments won't need to be made monthly in the same way they would with a home equity loan or HELOC. Instead, homeowners will only need to pay back the equity they borrowed when they sell the home or in the event of the death of the homeowner. So, for senior homeowners looking to exploit today's elevated home equity environment but want to avoid adding another bill into the mix, this could be the way to do so.\n\nLearn more about your reverse mortgage options here.\n\nWith home equity levels at another new high, homeowners in need of extra financing or who want to build an emergency funding source may want to familiarize themselves with the top ways to borrow equity now. Home equity loans, HELOCs and reverse mortgages all offer cost-effective and reliable ways to borrow. But with the funding source being your most prized financial asset, and the risk of potentially losing it if you're unable to make payments, it's important to explore each option's pros and cons carefully before getting formally started with an application.",

      "text": "What is a HELOC?\nStubborn inflation and higher interest rates are straining Americans' budgets and adding to rising debt. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported an increase of $394 billion in household debt in the fourth quarter of 2022. Total household debt now equals $16.90 trillion, $2.75 trillion higher than in the same period in 2019, just before the pandemic recession.\nNot looking to stand pat, many are looking for strategies to pay off their debt. One way homeowners can achieve this goal is by taking out a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Understanding how a HELOC works and the benefits it delivers can help you decide if a HELOC is worth it for you.\nIf you think you could benefit from taking out a HELOC then start exploring your options here now or use the table below to check your eligibility.\nWhat is a HELOC?\nA HELOC is a second mortgage that enables you to cash out some of the equity in your home. The equity amount is your home's current value minus what you owe on the mortgage. If approved, lenders typically allow you to borrow up to 85% of your home's equity. Like a credit card, a HELOC is a revolving line of credit, so you can borrow money only when you need to, and repay the debt as you go.\nA HELOC consists of two periods:\n- Draw period: You can borrow as little or as much as you want during this borrowing period, typically lasting from two to 10 years. Depending on your lender, your payments during the draw period may be interest-only or include only a portion of the principal.\n- Repayment period. After the draw period, you'll enter the repayment period, where you can no longer borrow money. You'll follow a repayment schedule to zero out your balance by the end of the period, which is usually 20 years. Alternatively, your lender may require you to make a large \"balloon payment\" to pay off the balance. It's essential that you understand the terms of your HELOC, including the payment schedule to repay the loan, before you sign for one.\nKeep in mind, a HELOC is a secured mortgage that uses your home as collateral. As such, you could lose your home to foreclosure if you fall behind on your payments.\nWho benefits from taking out a HELOC?\nA home equity line of credit is a valuable tool that may help you achieve a specific financial goal. Here's who might benefit from taking out a HELOC:\n- Borrowers who need funds to pay for a large expense. This can include a major home renovation or a car repair. If you use the HELOC on a home improvement that increases your home's value, you may be eligible for a tax deduction.\n- Homeowners who want to consolidate high-interest credit cards with a lower-interest loan. According to recent data from the Federal Reserve, the average interest rate for credit cards is 20.40%. If you have sufficient equity and meet eligibility requirements, you may be able to consolidate high-interest credit cards with a HELOC with a lower APR ranging from 7.75% to 11%.\n- Parents who want to help their child pay for college. Generally speaking, you should exhaust your financing options for federal grants and student loans before turning elsewhere for funds. If you've done that and still need additional funds, a HELOC may offer lower interest rates than a private student loan can.\nIf a HELOC sounds beneficial for your situation then start exploring your options online now. You can also use the table below to find some local options based on your zip code.\nHow do you get a HELOC?\nThe timeline for obtaining a HELOC varies by lender, but the process could take two to six weeks. Follow these steps to get a HELOC and minimize or avoid delays.\n- Ensure you have sufficient home equity: Lenders typically look for you to have a minimum of 15% to 20% equity to qualify for a HELOC.\n- Shop and compare: As with other types of loans, it's wise to compare mortgage interest rates, fees and terms from multiple lenders to find the best HELOC available. You can shop your HELOC options by clicking here.\n- Gather important documents: Contact the lender and ask what documents you must have when you apply for a HELOC. Typical information you must submit includes your ID, account statements, proof of income and mortgage statements. Having these documents ready to submit can help the process go efficiently. If your lender requires an appraisal, schedule one early to allow time for an appraiser to inspect your property and prepare a report.\n- Fill out an application: With your documents on hand, you can quickly submit your application. After you apply, be prepared to send any additional documents your lender requests. Your lender will then underwrite your loan, meaning they will review your income, credit score and other qualifications to determine if you're eligible for a new line of credit.\n- Accept and close the loan. If approved, all that's left is to accept and sign your loan documents. You must wait through a three-day rescission period before you can begin drawing on your HELOC. During this \"cooling off\" period, you can cancel your loan if you change your mind.\nYou can use the table below to start researching rates and HELOC options now.\nWhen a HELOC isn't your best option\nWhile HELOCs come with numerous benefits, they're not for everyone. For example, a HELOC would have little value to you if you don't have enough equity to achieve your goal, such as funding a home improvement project. Additionally, getting a HELOC may not make sense if you plan on selling your home in a few years since you must pay off your HELOC before you can close on the sale. Review your financial goals and consult your accountant or financial advisor before getting a HELOC.\nThe bottom line\nFinancial experts often advise against using a HELOC to finance a vacation, wedding, or a depreciating asset like a car or boat. Similarly, be careful about what you use any credit product for because you should never pay interest on money you don't truly need.\nAs a line of credit, a HELOC helps you control debt by allowing you to borrow money on an as-needed basis, up to your credit limit. By contrast, other types of loans may approve you and fund your account with a set amount, which may be more than you need."

      "text": "Home equity loans: How to decide between a fixed or variable rate\nHomeowners looking for some extra cash have access to an incredibly valuable resource: their home's equity.\nWhether you're looking to start home repairs or renovations that can increase the value of your home, pay down existing high-interest debt, cover college expenses or another costly endeavor, a home equity loan can help.\nHome equity loans are borrowed against the equity you've built up in your home over time. Interest rates on these loans are typically lower than rates on personal loans or credit cards. In fact, many of today's top home equity rates are under 10% APR.\nThe interest rate you qualify for itself is important \u2014 and can depend on a number of factors, from your credit score, income, home value and more \u2014 but the type of interest rate you choose can make a difference in the overall cost over time, too.\nHere's what to know about fixed interest rates compared to variable interest rates and how to decide which is right for you.\nIf you're looking to tap into your home equity, start by comparing today's best home equity rates now.\nShould you choose a fixed or variable rate home equity loan?\nMore often than not, home equity loans carry fixed interest rates. That means you're given a lump sum loan and assigned an interest rate that will remain the same over the lifetime of the repayment period. You can then use this interest rate and the loan term, as well as the amount you borrow, to determine exactly how much you'll owe each month until the balance is paid.\nVariable interest rates work a bit differently. These rates can change based on overall economic conditions, so the rate you lock in today may rise or fall over time (though the exact details depend on your lender and loan terms). The loan itself could grow more or less expensive over time, and it can be difficult to calculate the actual cost upfront. Some lenders offer variable interest on home equity loans, but you're more likely to get a variable rate with a home equity line of credit (HELOC).\nUltimately, timing can be an important factor in choosing your loan type. If you anticipate interest rates will rise, it could be good to lock in a fixed rate now. But if you think rates will go down between now and when you pay off your loan in full, you could save a lot of money by choosing a variable rate loan.\n\"Today's interest rates are likely higher than they will be longer term, therefore choosing a variable rate is the wiser option in many cases,\" says Julia Colantuono, CFP, APMA, financial planner and founder of One Financial Design. However, she says, \"If someone would prefer peace of mind knowing their rate won't go up, they could choose a fixed rate, and if interest rates go substantially lower they can refinance.\"\nCompare home equity rates you can qualify for today.\nWhen to choose a fixed rate\n- When you want to lock in a solid rate. If you believe rates will go up in the future, locking in a fixed rate today can help you avoid higher costs later on.\n- When you want to budget exactly. A fixed interest rate will allow you to make standard monthly payments over the lifetime of your loan, so you don't have to worry about price fluctuations.\n- When you want a lump sum loan. Many home equity loans come with fixed interest rates, while you're more likely to find variable rates with a HELOC.\nWhen to choose a variable rate\n- When you believe rates may drop. You can't predict the future, but when interest rates are high and there's a chance they could fall in the near future, a variable rate may help you save money over time.\n- When you know you can make the payments. While fixed interest rates can be good for budgeting, the monthly payments under a variable rate plan may be more flexible. You should only choose a variable interest rate if you're confident you'll be able to make your monthly payments in full and on time, even if they increase in the future.\n- When you'd rather have the option to pull from a line of credit. When you choose a HELOC, which more commonly offers variable rates, you don't have to pay interest on the full amount you qualify for. Instead, you can choose how much you want to borrow from the line of credit and only pay interest on that.\nThe bottom line\nHome equity can be a lucrative resource for homeowners looking to access some extra cash. But the type of interest your home equity loan charges can make a big difference in the total amount you'll pay over the lifetime of the loan. While fixed interest rates are good for budgeting a consistent monthly payment, variable rates offer the possibility of lower monthly payments in the future. Consider today's high interest rate environment and your own repayment plan before you make a decision.\nStart exploring your options today with today's best home equity rates."

      "text": "Everything to know about reverse mortgages\nIf you're struggling with the rising costs of inflation, tapping your home equity may provide some relief. With products like cash-out refinances, home equity loans or HELOCs, you can turn that equity into cash and use it for any purpose \u2014 whether it's to fund home renovations, pay off debt or even just cover monthly expenses.\nIf you're a senior, you also have a fourth option: A reverse mortgage.\nThis unique opportunity isn't available to everyone but, if you need cash, it may be worth pursuing. Check out what you can qualify for now.\nWhat is a reverse mortgage?\nA reverse mortgage is a type of mortgage loan that works in reverse. Instead of you making monthly payments to your lender, the lender makes payments to you. This might be a one-time, lump-sum payment, a line of credit or monthly payments over many years. Reverse mortgages are only for seniors \u2014 so borrowers 62 and older. In some cases, lenders may allow down to 55.\nHow does a reverse mortgage work?\nReverse mortgages allow you to pull from your home equity. You can think of them as an advance on your home's eventual sale. The lender pays you or gives you a line of credit to withdraw from, and once you no longer live in the home (you sell it, move to a long-term facility or pass away), the balance comes due. You or your heirs can then repay the lender out of pocket or via your home's sale proceeds.\nWhile you're in the home, you make no payments to your lender. You also won't owe taxes on the reverse mortgage payments you receive either. The IRS considers them loan proceeds \u2014 not taxable income.\nHow much money can you get from a reverse mortgage?\nA lot of factors impact how much money you can get from a reverse mortgage, including the age of the youngest borrower, how much equity you have in your home and the type of reverse mortgage loan you're choosing.\nWith a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) \u2014 a type of government-backed reverse mortgage \u2014 you can receive up to $970,800. Some lenders offer private loan options that offer well into the millions.\nIf this sounds appealing to you, you can easily get started right now. Lenders can assist you and let you know how much money you can potentially get out of your home.\nHow much does a reverse mortgage cost?\nThere are several costs associated with reverse mortgages. First, there are upfront closing costs. These include origination fees, appraisal fees, title search fees, costs for a credit check and more. The cost of these fees varies widely by lenders, but on HECMs, just the origination fee can equal as much as $6,000.\nYou will also owe a Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP) on HECM loans. Upfront, this costs 2% of your total reverse mortgage amount. And you'll pay the MIP annually \u2014 0.5% of your outstanding loan balance \u2014 and may have a monthly service fee (this is capped at $30 to $35, depending on the type of interest rate you have).\nYour lender may let you finance your closing costs and use your loan payments to cover them but it will reduce the amount of cash you can access in the long run.\nWhat are the basic requirements to get a reverse mortgage?\nIf you're using a government-backed reverse mortgage (HECM), you'll need to be at least 62 years old to qualify.\nYou will also need to:\n- Own your home or have paid down a significant amount of your mortgage\n- Live in the house as your primary residence\n- Be current on all federal debts\n- Have the funds to continue paying property taxes, home insurance premiums and HOA fees\n- Participate in a HUD-approved HECM counseling session\nPrivate reverse mortgages may have different requirements so make sure you do your homework.\nWho would benefit from a reverse mortgage?\nReverse mortgages can be helpful if you need extra income in retirement. They also help free up cash flow, as they eliminate your monthly housing payments.\nA reverse mortgage isn't a good idea if you don't have the money to cover insurance and taxes on your property. HECMs require borrowers to stay current on these charges while they live in the home. Failing to do so could lead to foreclosure.\nTwo more things to know about reverse mortgages\nIf you're considering a reverse mortgage, make sure you have a plan for your property should you pass away. While you can still leave the home to an heir, they will be responsible for any loan balance you leave behind. This might mean paying off your reverse mortgage out of pocket or, in many cases, selling your home to repay the lender. In most cases, the balance will come due in 30 days.\nFinally, be diligent when choosing which lender to work with. Reverse mortgage scams are common, so learn to recognize the red flags. These might include high-pressure sales tactics or not disclosing the fees and risks associated with these loans.\nYou should search and compare lenders to find the best one for you. You can easily start the process today.\nConsider cash-out refinancing, too\nIf a reverse mortgage doesn't sound like it will help fulfill your financial goals then consider cash-out refinancing, instead. The process works by replacing your current mortgage with a larger one, then using those funds to pay off your existing loan. You receive the excess amount (the difference between your new loan balance and your old one) back in cash.\nYou can potentially receive a large amount of money by going this route (maybe even larger than if you did a reverse mortgage since the latter is dependent on the equity in your home). You can then use this money to pay down debts or simply as a reliable source of income to pay bills and expenses.\nThe benefits of cash-out refinancing are multiple. Explore your options now and see what you can qualify for."

      "text": "What is home equity?\nIn an economic climate plagued by decades-high inflation and uneven stock market performance, millions of Americans may find themselves looking for new and innovative ways to make ends meet. This can take the form of everything from passive income streams to refinancing to relying on traditional credit forms like credit cards or personal loans.\nHomeowners have a unique alternative to pursue: their own homes. Or, specifically, the equity they've built up during their time in the home. In this article, we will break down what home equity is, how to calculate it and how you can use those funds via a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC).\nExplore your home equity loan options online now to see if a home equity loan or HELOC is right for you.\nWhat is home equity?\nSimply put, home equity is the amount of money you currently have invested in your home. It's a combination of the number of payments you've made toward your mortgage principal and the value of your home on the current market.\nLet's say you initially purchased your home for $500,000 but have made enough payments that you now owe $400,000. While you've been paying your mortgage, your home's value has increased from $500,000 to $600,000. In this case, you have $200,000 worth of home equity ($100,000 you've paid off of the mortgage loan plus the $100,000 your home has grown in value).\nThat said, home equity doesn't always add up favorably. In some instances, you may have paid your mortgage down, but the value of the home dropped during the same period. In these instances, the only equity you can use is from the payments you've made (since there isn't any new value).\nA real estate professional or lending institution can set up a formal appraisal of your home to accurately determine how much equity you currently have.\nHow can you use your home equity?\nIf you're one of the millions of homeowners who have seen their property rise in value in recent months or years, chances are high that you're sitting on a significant amount of home equity. You can use it in multiple ways to help pay for expenses. Here are two primary ones to know:\nHome equity loans\nHome equity loans act as a second mortgage. Homeowners simply deduct a portion of the equity they have in their homes to use as they see fit. Home equity loans have multiple advantages, namely their lower interest rate and interest tax deduction eligibility if used for IRS-approved home repairs and improvements.\nExplore your home equity loan options here now.\nHELOCs\nHELOCs work similarly to home equity loans, but instead of getting a large sum of money at one time, a HELOC acts more as a credit card. It's a revolving line of credit to be used as the homeowner sees appropriate. HELOCs also have lower interest rates than credit cards or personal loans, and they're also tax-deductible if used correctly.\nThey're generally divided into two periods: a draw period when you borrow as much as you want or need (usually limited to 85% of your home's equity) and a repayment period when you won't be able to borrow any more money and must pay back what you've borrowed.\nExplore your HELOC options here now.\nThe bottom line\nHomeowners looking for ways to pay for rising expenses should strongly consider turning to their homes - and the equity they've built up - as a low-interest credit alternative. Home equity can be used in multiple ways, including with a home equity loan or a HELOC. And if used for eligible reasons, the interest the homeowner pays on these credit forms may be tax-deductible for the year it was used."

      "text": "What are today's HELOC and home equity loan interest rates?\nIn the elevated interest rate climate of recent years, there have been few affordable borrowing options to choose from. Personal loan interest rates, for example, have been frozen at around 12% for months while credit card interest rates have declined recently, but only from a recent record high of 23%. Double-digit rates for both make borrowing with either especially cost-prohibitive right now, even with the potential for interest rate cuts to be issued later in 2025.\nOne smart and effective way to borrow, however, is readily available for homeowners right now via their home equity. With the average equity level comfortably sitting over $300,000 currently, borrowing with a home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC) makes sense. And with rates here significantly lower than most alternatives, and with those rates poised to drop alongside a declining federal funds rate in the months ahead, either could be the ideal way to borrow a large sum of money at an affordable cost.\nBefore getting started, homeowners should first familiarize themselves with today's average HELOC and home equity loan rates, both of which change often based on market conditions.\nStart the process by seeing how much home equity you could borrow here now.\nWhat are today's HELOC and home equity loan interest rates?\nAs of August 8, 2025, here's what the average home equity loan interest rates are, according to Bankrate:\n- 5-year home equity loans: 8.25%\n- 10-year home equity loans: 8.41%\n- 15-year home equity loans: 8.28%\nThe average HELOC rate is now 8.13%, according to Bankrate. However, all of these rates are nationwide averages, and the offers you may receive will be impacted by location, lender, credit profile, and more. Take the time, then, to shop around to find the lowest rates and best terms.\nStart shopping for HELOCs and home equity loans online today.\nWhat to know about borrowing with a HELOC and home equity loan\nHELOCs and home equity loans both use your equity as the funding source, but the way they operate differs. Home equity loans come with fixed interest rates and provide the homeowner with a lump sum of money of which repayments will be expected to be made immediately.\nHELOCs, on the other hand, come with variable interest rates and provide the homeowner with a revolving line of credit using the home as the funding source. Payments will only need to be made on the amount of credit used, not the full line of credit you've been approved for. And, for an initial draw period, interest-only payments will be required before the repayment period kicks in (typically after 10 or 15 years).\nIn addition to lower interest rates when compared to alternative borrowing products, both HELOCs and home equity loans have some attractive tax benefits. If the owner uses either product for IRS-eligible home repairs and renovations, they may be able to deduct the interest they paid from their taxes for the year or years in which the product was used. Still, with the home functioning as collateral and the possibility of it being foreclosed on if payments aren't made as agreed to, it's critical for homeowners to choose the right product for their needs and budget.\nThe bottom line\nHELOC and home equity loan rates are lower than many alternative borrowing products right now, and they're poised to decline further if the Federal Reserve cuts rates again later this year. Still, not every lender will offer the same rates and terms, and with your home as collateral, it's critical to shop around to find the right product for your budget and financial goals."

      "text": "Can you lose your home with a home equity loan?\nHome equity loans have historically been one of the less expensive ways to borrow money. But, in recent years, they've been one of the only ways to do so. While inflation surged and interest rates spiked, the cost of using a credit card or personal loan rose in tandem. Although home equity loan interest rates weren't immune from this trend, they remained relatively low. And now, with inflation much cooler and multiple interest rate cuts since issued, they've dropped even further. The average home equity loan rate is now in the low 8% range, making them almost three times cheaper than credit cards.\nWith the average home equity loan amount at approximately $320,000 right now, and the rates on home equity loans markedly lower than many alternatives, homeowners may be considering their loan options now. Before getting started, however, borrowers should carefully consider both the pros and cons of borrowing money this way \u2013 and that extends to knowing the risks of being unable to repay all that's been withdrawn. Below, we'll break down what to know and how to avoid losing your home by using a home equity loan.\nStart by seeing how much equity you'd be eligible to borrow here.\nCan you lose your home with a home equity loan?\nIn short: yes, you can lose your home if you fail to repay your home equity loan in full, based on the repayment terms you agreed to when you took out the loan. Unlike credit cards or personal loans, in which no collateral is at stake (thus their higher interest rates), home equity loans put your home in the middle of the borrowing equation. Fail to make your payments and you could, potentially, lose your home to the lender in the process. So borrowers must do all they can to avoid this realistic scenario. Otherwise, the lender could foreclose on the property in which the funds were withdrawn and sell the home at an auction.\nSo, how do you avoid losing your home in this process? Fortunately, there are multiple ways to do so. Here are four:\nShop around for rates and lenders\nTo avoid losing your home when borrowing with a home equity loan it's critical that you first find the most affordable rates and terms. This will better ensure ease of repayment over the common 10- or 15-year repayment periods. And one of the better ways to do this is by shopping around for rates and lenders. Don't just your current mortgage lender automatically (you're allowed to use a different bank). Instead, see what rates and offers competitor lenders have available and then use those to go back to your existing lender to see if they can beat it.\nShop for home equity loans online today.\nDon't overborrow\nWith an average six-figure amount of home equity, in today's climate, it can be tempting to overborrow. But that would be a mistake, especially if you're trying to avoid losing your home to a lender. Instead, compile a realistic budget. Determine precisely how much you need and only apply for that amount. And, if you have leftover money, consider using it to repay a portion of the loan versus spending it frivolously on other, unimportant items.\nUse it for the right reasons\nUtilizing your home equity loan funds for items like home repairs can potentially boost your home's value and you may even qualify for a tax deduction. Using it for depreciating assets like vehicles or other big-ticket items, however, could cause you to quickly become \"underwater,\" owing more to the home lender than your home's worth. Do all you can to avoid this situation, then, by being judicious and strategic with your intended uses for the loan funds - or risk having the home eventually foreclosed on.\nMonitor the market for refinancing opportunities\nIf you already have a home equity loan or, ultimately, make some of the poor choices above, it's important to remember that you have refinancing opportunities. Home equity loans can be refinanced into different rates and terms, allowing you to potentially regain some critical control over the money you've borrowed. Considering that home equity loan rates have fallen significantly over the last 12 months, approximately, now may be a smart time to act for existing borrowers. You may be surprised at how much you can save.\nSee what home equity loan refinance rate you'd be eligible for here.\nThe bottom line\nYes, home equity loan borrowers can lose their homes if they ultimately fail to make all of their repayments to the lender. But there's a lot that can happen before then and multiple steps to take to avoid the worst-case scenario. By making one or more of the above moves during your home equity loan borrowing process, you can better improve your chances of success \u2013 and ensure that the home in question remains fully under your control."

Taxes are due in just a few short weeks (April 18 for the 2022 filing year) and if you haven't already submitted your return you should probably get moving. You can file quickly and painlessly online with a professional tax service.\nFor homeowners, filing a return is a mixed bag. For those with substantial interest left on their mortgage, it can be a valuable deduction to take each year. But as that interest goes down and equity grows the refund may not be as large.\nFortunately, there's another way homeowners can benefit when filing their returns. Those who took out a home equity line of credit (HELOC) last year may be able to deduct the interest they paid. This can only happen if specific requirements are met. But, in an economic environment still dealing with inflation and high-interest rates, every dollar counts.\nLearn more about how a HELOC can qualify as a tax deduction and why this type of credit may be worth it for some homeowners from a trusted expert. Start exploring your HELOC options here and check your eligibility.\nIs a HELOC tax-deductible?\nIf you took out and used a HELOC in 2022 then its interest may be deductible for the return you're about to file. If you applied and are using one now, however, you'll have to wait until next year to get credit. Those who used a HELOC in 2022 can use it as a deduction if it was used to make major home improvements, the IRS says.\n\"Interest on home equity loans and lines of credit are deductible only if the borrowed funds are used to buy, build, or substantially improve the taxpayer's home that secures the loan,\" the IRS explains online. \"The loan must be secured by the taxpayer's main home or second home (qualified residence), and meet other requirements.\"\nIf these conditions aren't met, the IRS notes, the deduction isn't eligible. So, if you used a HELOC to pay off student loan debt or to pay for a wedding, it won't qualify.\n\"Generally, you can deduct the home mortgage interest and points reported to you on Form 1098 on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 8a,\" the IRS says. \"However, any interest showing in box 1 of Form 1098 from a home equity loan, or a line of credit or credit card loan secured by the property, is not deductible if the proceeds were not used to buy, build, or substantially improve a qualified home.\"\nNot sure if you'd qualify? Online tax services can help you sort through your return to help maximize your deductions.\nWhy a HELOC is worth it\nIn addition to its potential tax deduction each year, a HELOC has other advantages that may appeal to homeowners in search of extra funding. Here are two additional benefits to know:\n- Interest rates are lower than other credit options. Interest rates on HELOCs are around 6% to 7%, depending on your credit score and other personal factors. While that may not be as low as your mortgage rate, it's still better than a personal loan (around 10% currently) or a credit card (think 20% or more). You can check what HELOC interest rates you're eligible to receive here now.\n- You only pay for what you need. Unlike some other credit types, with a HELOC you'll only pay interest on the amount you actually use - not the amount you were approved for. So, if you apply for a line of credit for $100,000 but only use $20,000 of that amount you'll only be on the hook for the interest from the latter amount.\nFind out if a HELOC is right for you by exploring your local options here or by using the table below.\nThe bottom line\nInterest tied to HELOCs, assuming the HELOC is used for IRS-approved reasons, may be tax deductible. But that's not the only reason why homeowners should turn to HELOCs instead of other credit options. This type of credit generally offers lower interest rates than credit cards and personal loans. And you'll only pay interest on what you use - not the full amount you were approved for at the time of application. Get started with a HELOC now!"

Given the current state of the economy, many are looking for options to make ends meet or pay off debt.\nThose strapped for cash may turn to credit cards or personal loans to get through a rough financial spot or tap into their 401(k) for funds to pay down debt balances.\nAnother option to access cash is to take out a home equity loan. These loans have numerous advantages but are not ideal in other scenarios. It really depends on your personal situation. Before you proceed, it's essential to gain a better understanding of home equity loans. You can check your home equity loan options online here now to see if it's right for you.\nWhat is a home equity loan?\nA home equity loan is a second mortgage that allows you to borrow a lump sum of money against the equity in your home. Like your first mortgage, a second mortgage is secured by your property.\nHome equity is the difference between your home's current value and the amount you owe on your mortgage. For example, let's say you initially purchased your home for $300,000. Over time, your home's value rises to $400,000 while your monthly payments lower your loan balance to $250,000. In this scenario, you would have $150,000 in home equity ($400,000 -$250,000).\nGenerally, lenders will let you borrow 80% of your home's equity, or 80% loan-to-value (LTV). So using the above example, you may be able to borrow $120,000 (80% of $150,000).\nHome equity loans usually have fixed interest rates, and repayment terms range from five to 30 years. The interest rate you receive will depend on numerous factors, including your income, credit history, home value and the existing balance on your home loan.\nBenefits of using a home equity loan\nHome equity loans boast several benefits, such as:\n- Lower interest rates: Since your home secures the loan and reduces your lender's risk, home equity loans often come with lower interest rates than other credit options like credit cards and personal loans.\n- Possible tax deduction: The IRS may allow you to deduct the interest on your home equity loan if you use the funds to build or make significant improvements to a qualified residence. Consult with your accountant or tax professional to determine your eligibility for this deduction.\n- Easy to budget: With a fixed interest rate, your payment remains the same over the life of the loan. As such, you can include your costs in your long-term budget and plan accordingly.\nIf you think you could benefit from using a home equity loan then get started today. Check eligibility and your local offers here.\nHow to apply for a home equity loan\nBefore applying for a home equity loan, make sure you'll have at least 20% equity in your home remaining after taking out the loan. Lenders typically look for a credit score of at least 620 and regular on-time payments on your existing mortgage. Maintaining a debt-to-income ratio (DTI) of 43% or less is also important. DTI measures the amount of your monthly debt bills against your monthly gross income.\nIf you have adequate equity and you want to take out a home equity loan, follow these steps:\n- Get loan estimates from multiple lenders to compare rates and repayment terms.\n- Select the loan offer that best suits your needs.\n- Review the disclosure documents that detail the terms of the loan agreement and proceed only if you agree.\n- Get a home appraisal if your lender requires one, and submit any supporting documents your lender requests.\n- Close on the home equity loan and receive funding, typically in one lump sum.\nRemember, the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) protects your right to change your mind and cancel your loan without losing money, so long as you do so within three days.\nWhen a home equity loan may not be beneficial\nIn certain scenarios, a home equity loan may not be your best option.\nYou might consider other options if the interest rate on a new home equity loan is higher than your existing accounts or other forms of credit. For example, if you plan on using funds from a new loan to consolidate debt, it may not be advantageous if current home equity interest rates are higher than those on the debts you wish to pay off. Current home equity loan rates generally range from 5% to 16%.\nThe most significant disadvantage of a home equity loan is that it puts your home at risk if you don't make your payments. If your source of income is unreliable or you carry a substantial amount of debt, getting a home equity loan probably isn't your best financial move.\nFinancial experts typically recommend against getting a home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC) for short-term expenses like an expensive vacation or wedding. Depending on your loan term, you could pay interest on the loan amount for years or even decades, long after you've enjoyed the benefit.\nThe bottom line\nA home equity loan is a valuable tool to help you tap into your home's equity for cash you can use to pay for home repairs, renovations and other purposes. If you're considering a home equity loan, run the numbers to make sure it makes financial sense. Remember to account for closing costs on a new home equity loan, typically 2% to 5% of the loan amount.\nAlso, consider alternatives, such as a HELOC. A HELOC is a credit line that works like a credit card. It allows you to borrow only what you need in smaller increments as needed, up to your approved limit. Like a home equity loan, your home secures your HELOC, which puts your home at risk.\nIf you plan on taking out a home equity loan, get multiple loan estimates and select the loan offer with the interest rates and terms that are most advantageous for you.

And the mortgage interest deduction is still a substantial one for millions of homeowners.\n\"You can deduct home mortgage interest on the first $750,000 ($375,000 if married filing separately) of indebtedness,\" the IRS says. \"However, higher limitations ($1 million ($500,000 if married filing separately)) apply if you are deducting mortgage interest from indebtedness incurred before December 16, 2017.\"\nAnd don't forget, while the tax deductions for home equity loans and HELOCs are favorable, you're still using your home as collateral for this sort of credit. So make sure you've explored all of your credit options thoroughly before signing on the dotted line.

While that may be down from the $327,000 level it hit in the second quarter of 2024, it still represents a large, six-figure sum of money available to homeowners now, even accounting for the traditional 20% equity threshold many lenders will require borrowers to keep in their homes.\nAnd while that amount of money can be utilized in any number of ways, from financing home projects and renovations to paying for a college education and consolidating debt, it won't be cost-free, either.

However, unlike a home equity loan with a rate that will remain fixed until refinanced, a HELOC has a variable interest rate subject to adjustments monthly for borrowers. That could make it even more affordable in the months ahead, as many expect interest rate cuts to resume later in the year, potentially as soon as the June Federal Reserve meeting.\nThat noted, there are other ways to borrow your home equity besides just with a home equity loan or a HELOC. Cash-out refinancing, for example, may be considered. This is when you take out a new loan larger than your mortgage balance, pay off the balance and pocket the difference between the two as cash. But that will likely be a much more expensive way to access your equity because the exchange of loans will also require an exchange in interest rates, meaning your currently low mortgage interest rate could surge from where it is now. So, crunch the numbers and compare your cash-out refinance costs to what's available with a HELOC to accurately determine which is more financially appropriate for you.\nTechnically, the very cheapest way to get equity out of your home is with a reverse mortgage. Unlike HELOCs, home equity loans and cash-out refinances, a reverse mortgage won't require any monthly repayments to be made at all. The equity withdrawn, however, will need to be repaid in full if the homeowner dies or if the home is resold. Additionally, most reverse mortgage options are reserved for homeowners age 62 and older, so this is not a readily available alternative.\nAnd what if you elected to forego home equity borrowing, specifically, for other credit options? Well, in that case, a HELOC will still be your cheapest option. With personal loan interest rates averaging around 12% now and credit card interest rates just slightly below a record 23%, neither offers a cost-effective alternative right now.\nThis all said, the interest rate climate is dynamic and, depending on the product, rates change daily. So, it's important to monitor the market for changes that could impact rates and offers. But, right now, if you're looking for the cheapest way to borrow home equity specifically, a HELOC is your least costly choice.\nSee what HELOC rate you'd be eligible for here.\nThe bottom line\nHomeowners in need of inexpensive financing would be hard-pressed to find a better option than a HELOC right now. Not only does a HELOC have lower interest rates than a home equity loan, but it won't require you to exchange your currently low mortgage rate the way a cash-out refinance would nor would you have to meet age requirements the way a reverse mortgage mandates. That all said, the HELOC's variable rate makes its future costs impossible to predict with precision, so potential borrowers would be served well by calculating a variety of realistic repayment scenarios to ensure long-term borrowing affordability."

  "argos_summary": "Home equity levels have reached a record high of $17.8 trillion, with $11.6 trillion in tappable equity available to homeowners. This surge presents opportunities for borrowing through home equity loans, HELOCs, and reverse mortgages, each offering different benefits and risks. Home equity loans provide a lump sum with fixed rates, while HELOCs offer a revolving line of credit at variable rates, making them currently the cheapest option for accessing home equity. Homeowners are advised to carefully consider their financial situation and the implications of using their home as collateral before borrowing.",
