      "summary": "The article reports that the U.S. has quietly restricted Ukraine’s use of U.S.-made ATACMS long‑range missiles, limiting Kyiv’s ability to strike targets in Russia, a move that has frustrated President Trump. Meanwhile, Ukraine has carried out a third strike on the Druzhba pipeline, cutting Russian crude oil flow to Hungary and Slovakia, prompting Hungarian officials to condemn the attacks and accuse Ukraine of undermining energy security. Trump publicly expressed anger over the pipeline strikes and hinted at possible sanctions or a withdrawal from the peace process if progress stalls. The piece highlights tensions between U.S. policy, Ukrainian military actions, and European energy concerns.",
