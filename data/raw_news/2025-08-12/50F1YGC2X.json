She made several small appearances on British film and television, one of which was produced by actor Hugh Grant.\nGrant helped propel Hurley into the Hollywood scene when she attended the premiere of his film Four Weddings and a Funeral as his plus-one. Shortly after that red carpet appearance, Hurley secured her longtime spokesmodel contract with Est\u00e9e Lauder.\nIn 1997, Hurley landed a starring role in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery. Over the next few years, she had roles in several major Hollywood films, including Bedazzled (2000) and Serving Sara (2002). She later starred in 14 episodes of Gossip Girl as Diana Payne and 40 episodes of The Royals as Queen Helena. Son Damien Hurley directed her in 2024\u2019s Strictly Confidential.\nElizabeth dated Grant from 1987 to 2000. She moved on with producer Stephen Bing, but their relationship ended when Bing refused to acknowledge he fathered Elizabeth\u2019s son, Damien. (A paternity test later confirmed that Bing is the father.) The actress was married to Indian businessman Arun Nayar from 2007 to 2010, and she rebounded with Australian cricketer Shane Warne, to whom she was briefly engaged. They split in 2013. Elizabeth\u2019s next public relationship wasn\u2019t until April 2025, when she revealed via Instagram that she was dating Billy Ray Cyrus."

      "text": "Machine Gun Kelly publicly addressed rumors of a romance with Sydney Sweeney.\nDuring an appearance on the Sunday, August 10, episode of Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, MGK, whose real name is Colson Baker, was asked point-blank about his relationship with Sweeney, 27.\nAndy Cohen read from a question card that contained a viewer query from \u201cKyle P.\u201d The TV host said, \u201cMGK, Kyle P wants to know if there\u2019s any truth to the rumor that you and Sydney Sweeney were more than just friends.\u201d\nMGK, 35, responded while shaking his head and looking directly down the camera barrel, \u201cKyle P, shut up, dude,\u201d at which Cohen and the audience laughed loudly.\nIn May, photos published by Page Six showed the musician and Sweeney hugging at a Las Vegas club opening. Later that month, MGK shared an Instagram carousel that included a snap of himself posing alongside Sweeney as they flashed peace signs at the camera. (Patrick Schwarzenegger and Hollywood hair stylist Glen Oropeza were also in the snap.)\nAn Instagram Story shared by Sweeney at the time, published by the outlet, also featured a photo of herself posing with Schwarzenegger, 31, and MGK at the Vegas event.\nBoth MGK and Sweeney are currently single after the musician\u2019s split from Megan Fox was confirmed by Us Weekly in December 2024, and Sweeney\u2019s engagement to Jonathan Davino was called off in May. (MGK shares a daughter, Saga, 4 months, with Fox, 39, in addition to daughter Casie, 16, whom he shares with ex Emma Cannon.)\nMGK and Sweeney have been friends for years, with Sweeney starring in MGK\u2019s 2021 directorial debut, Downfalls High. The pair also appeared in the 2019 film Big Time Adolescence alongside MGK\u2019s close friend Pete Davidson.\nMGK\u2019s appearance on WWHL also saw an audience member ask him who his dream musical collaboration would be, living or dead, to which he responded, \u201c I like Frank, man, Frank Sinatra. I\u2019ll do that.\u201d\nHe was also asked by Cohen about how age, which garnered an interesting response from MGK: \u201cIt\u2019s a weird thing, dude, I don\u2019t know if it exists.\u201d\nCohen likened MGK\u2019s \u201cconnection to\u201d his age to that of Mariah Carey, who told Harper\u2019s Bazaar in July that she doesn\u2019t \u201callow\u201d herself to age, which drew MGK to say, \u201cI just don\u2019t know many facts about my life, so I\u2019m starting to just be like, like, my skin, if it just rips open, it heals really quick, there\u2019s just things where I\u2019m starting to be, like, who\u2019s my dad, you know?\u201d\nHinting that he may have otherworldly origins, MGK noted that he once asked his mother if there was any \u201cperiod of time where you went missing,\u201d which provided an unusual answer.\n\u201cShe told me she got abducted at one point so I was just, like,\u201d MGK said with a shrug."

      "text": "Simone Biles\nSimone Biles is the most-decorated gymnast in history with 11 Olympic medals and 30 World medals. She made her Olympic debut at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro, winning individual gold medals in all-around, vault and floor. She returned for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics but withdrew from the team competition and individual all-around meets to focus on her mental health. Biles won bronze in the balance beam competition and earned a silver medal for the team all-around. In 2023, Biles won her eighth U.S. Gymnastics title, breaking the 90-year-old U.S. title record previously held by Alfred Jochim. She returned for the 2024 Paris Olympics, winning gold with the team and individually for vault and all-around. She took home silver in the floor exercise.\nBiles came forward in 2018 as one of the many elite gymnasts who accused former Team USA doctor Larry Nassar of sexual assault. Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in state prison after pleading guilty to sexual assault of minors and an additional 60 years in federal prison.\nBiles previously dated fellow gymnast Stacey Ervin Jr. from 2017 to 2020. She started dating NFL star Jonathan Owens in 2020, and the couple tied the knot in 2023."

      "text": "The official cause of death for Kelly Clarkson\u2019s ex-husband, Brandon Blackstock, has been confirmed.\nSilver Bow County Coroner Dan Hollis told Us Weekly on Monday, August 11, that Blackstock\u2019s cause of death was melanoma, a form of skin cancer, and the manner of his death was natural causes. \u201cBrandon Blackstock passed away peacefully at his home in Butte, Montana on August 7th under hospice care surrounded by his family,\u201d Hollis said in a statement.\nBlackstock died on August 7 after privately battling cancer for three years. He was 48.\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years. He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family,\u201d a family rep told Us in a statement. \u201cWe thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family\u2019s privacy during this very difficult time.\u201d\nOne day earlier, Clarkson, 43, alerted fans to Blackstock\u2019s illness when she put her Las Vegas residency on pause, though she didn\u2019t reveal the nature of his condition at the time.\n\u201cUnfortunately, I need to postpone the remainder of the August Studio Session dates in Las Vegas,\u201d she announced via Instagram on August 6. \u201cWhile I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children\u2019s father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them. I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.\u201d\nClarkson and Blackstock wed in October 2013 and went on to welcome daughter River, 11, and son Remington, 9. During their marriage, Blackstock worked as the singer\u2019s manager. Clarkson ultimately filed for divorce in June 2020 after nearly seven years. The pair finalized the proceedings in March 2022 following a messy legal battle.\nPrior to his relationship with Clarkson, Blackstock was married to Melissa Ashworth from 2001 to 2012. The exes shared daughter Savannah, 23, and son Seth, 18.\nIn January 2022, Blackstock became a first-time grandfather when Savannah gave birth to her and now-husband Quentin Lee\u2019s son, Lake. Savannah announced in July that the couple are expecting their second baby.\nOutside of his marriage to Clarkson, Brandon had another Hollywood connection via his father, Narvel Blackstock, who was Clarkson\u2019s manager earlier in her career. Narvel was previously married to Reba McEntire from 1989 to 2015, during which time she was stepmom to Brandon and his two sisters, Chassidy and Shawna. Narvel and McEntire\u2019s son, Shelby, who was born in 1990, was Brandon\u2019s half-brother."
