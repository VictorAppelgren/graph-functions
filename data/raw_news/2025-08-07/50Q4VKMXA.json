  "title": "e.l.f Beauty Hit by China Tariffs",
  "description": "e.l.f beauty has declined to give an outlook for 2026, citing tariff uncertainty. Mandy Fields, e.l.f. CFO, says the company is confident that it will continue growing from its portfolio of products and the recent acquisition of Rhode. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "This is interesting because we saw a lot of companies pull their guidance back in the last reporting season only to reinstate. This season you're taking a different route here, actually declining to give 2026 guidance. What more clarity do you need on tariffs at this point to have confidence in saying these are the numbers for next year? Well, thanks so much for having me, Katie. From a tariff perspective, there still remains a number of outcomes on the tariff front. And until we have more certainty there, we're not issuing guidance. But what we did do this time around is give more perspective on what we expect for the first half of the year since we do have better visibility to that. Our first half of the year ends in the September quarter. And what we said is that we expect our net sales to be better than what we delivered in Q1. We're going to have the addition of road in those numbers as well. And we expect our adjusted EBIT margins to be about 20%, which I think is pretty solid given the tariff headwinds that we're facing. Those adjusted EBIT margins would only be down about 300 basis points on a year over year basis. Well, I'm glad you brought up road and that acquisition because one of the questions that analysts seem to have was how much is organic growth versus just the acquisition of road. Right. And in the first quarter, I'm proud to say that we just delivered our 26th consecutive quarter of net sales growth and market share growth. And we're really the only beauty company to be able to deliver 26 consecutive quarters of market share growth. So very proud of that and that is all led by our existing portfolio. Road will not contribute to our results until August. We just closed on that acquisition on August 5th. And so they will now be a contributor to our growth. But the growth that we've seen has really been driven by health, beauty and our existing portfolio of brands that I that's great answer considering the fact that analysts were worried this was all due to road. What does organic growth look like to you? I mean obviously with Road it's going to be great compared to last year, but organically, will you continue to grow and can can you put maybe a percentage number on it? Yeah, we continue to believe that we are going to pick up market share as we move forward, as we have done for these last 26 quarters. And over the longer term, what we see for our beauty is an opportunity to more than double our sales, whether that be through cosmetics, skin care or the growth that we see from an international standpoint. And so over the coming years, we do believe that we will be double the size of where we are today. And I think road just helps to accelerate that. Looking forward to watching that evolve. I do want to talk a little bit about the pipeline here, what you're working on right now, what new products are coming and are there any timelines that you can give us? Sure. We're really excited about our skin tint that we just launched. That is SPF mineral sunscreen, multi benefit skin tint, and we've been working on that one for quite some time and it's incredible. If you saw our earnings call yesterday, one of the beauty influencers out there, McKayla called it one of the best products that she thinks Alpha's ever launched. And so you can get that now it's $18 versus a prestige item at 48. So really still speaking to our value proposition. In fact, our value proposition is super important in this environment and 75% of our portfolio is at $10 or less, which really speaks to consumers. Can I ask about financing? Because it's on the Bloomberg terminal? When I hit Didi, I asked to see what kind of debt you have out. I'm used to seeing a lot more here. You've got very little in terms of debt, really just loan that I can see here and weighted average cost of capital at 12.8% CC on the Bloomberg terminal is a little higher than I'd normally see for a company your size. But on the debt side, it's nothing. So are you going to issue bonds? Yes. So from a leverage standpoint, we're very pleased with how we're positioned, even with the acquisition of road on a net leverage basis to our adjusted EBITDA. We're still only going to be about two times levered and so very much manageable. You know, I've been in companies where we have a lot more debt load, but, you know, I don't want to put us in that position here at Alpha. And so we're going to be mindful of how we borrow. And we've done that very responsibly over the years and feel great about both our our leverage position and our cash flow.",
