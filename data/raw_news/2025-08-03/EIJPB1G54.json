  "description": "The Rich Are Using Self-Directed IRAs To Invest In Crypto, Startups\u2014And Even Cows. Should You?",
  "content": "More investors are shaking off Wall Street's rigidity to explore unconventional retirement holdings such as cryptocurrencies, private startups, and even livestock.\n\nAt the center are self\u2011directed investment retirement arrangements, custodial accounts that empower you to move beyond index funds and opt for digital assets, farmland, or a startup equity stake, IRA Financial says. These accounts have become a bridge between traditional retirement saving and more personalized wealth\u2011building strategies.\n\nAccording to a Lansons survey, 26% of Americans are planning to invest in alternative assets within the next few years, and 48% more say they might consider it, with active investors open to allocating around 25% of their portfolios to private equity, farmland, digital collectibles, and other non-traditional assets.\n\u2022 $100k+ in investable assets? Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes \u2013 no cost, no obligation.\n\u2022 Accredited Investors: Grab Pre-IPO Shares of the AI Company Powering Hasbro, Sephora & MGM\u2014Just $0.63 Before NASDAQ Launch\n\nSelf-directed IRAs operate under the same Internal Revenue Service rules as traditional accounts but offer a far broader universe of eligible investment options, Rocket Dollar says. Allowed assets include real estate, private equity, precious metals, digital assets, and yes, even livestock like cows or racehorses, so long as the investment is handled by the IRA trustee and rules are strictly followed.\n\nInvesting in agriculture with an IRA can mean purchasing farmland or leasing it out to operators, with revenue flowing tax\u2011deferred into the IRA. Over time, the land may appreciate. My IRA Lender says farmland IRAs also open the door to small farms, apple orchards, corn and grain fields, or even herds of cattle, though the upkeep must be outsourced, and prohibited transactions avoided.\n\nAccording to My IRA Lender, using an IRA to buy farmland allows income and gains from the land to flow back into the IRA on a tax\u2011deferred basis.\n\nHigh-net-worth individuals have placed substantial capital into farmland, a tangible asset often considered a hedge against inflation and volatility. Warren Buffett once remarked he'd rather own U.S. farmland than all the gold, and in an interview with Bloomberg, Michael Burry called agricultural land potentially \"very valuable,\" especially in the long term. The trend is supported by analysis showing that farmland can generate stable returns and low correlation with public markets.\n\nDigital Assets Beyond Bitcoin: How Crypto Fits In\n\nThe crypto boom ignited a surge in retail demand for digital asset exposure, especially for investors interested in retirement accounts. A global survey by Coinbase COIN and EY\u2011Parthenon found that as of January, 86% of institutional investors either already had exposure to digital assets or planned to this year. A strong majority, or 83%, said they intend to increase crypto allocations, with 59% aiming for more than 5% of total assets under management.\n\nTrending: \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share.\n\nRetail investors are increasingly taking the same path, an EY-Parthenon survey says. Many are expanding beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum into altcoins, staking, and tokenized assets that provide access to opportunities once reserved for institutions.\n\nSeveral well-known investors and companies are jumping into crypto as part of a broader \"crypto-treasury\" strategy, according to The Wall Street Journal. MicroStrategy MSTR CEO Michael Saylor, pioneered this approach in 2020 by selling shares and debt to build a massive Bitcoin position, with the company now worth more than $115 billion. Former Barclays BCS CEO Bob Diamond has also joined the trend through Atlas Merchant Capital, partnering with major investors to form a $305 million fund to buy a new crypto token called Hyperliquid.\n\nStartup Equity and Private Placements: Access the Next Unicorn\n\nSelf\u2011directed Roth IRAs can hold private startup investments and venture deals, allowing capital growth to unfold inside a tax\u2011advantaged structure. According to Madison Trust, these plans enable direct participation in private equity, venture capital, and private placement deals, well aligned with the multi\u2011year horizon of IRA investing.\n\nPerhaps the most famous example is Peter Thiel, who used a self\u2011directed Roth IRA to invest in early PayPal PYPL shares with just $1,700. As PayPal, and later Facebook and Palantir PLTR, surged in value, those holdings remained inside the Roth and grew tax\u2011free, reportedly accounting for over $5 billion in value without a tax liability, Alto IRA reports.\n\nThat kind of structure lets investors pursue private opportunities alongside the tax benefits typical of a Roth IRA. Of course, compliance is essential as deals must avoid prohibited transactions, and income from pass-through entities may trigger unrelated business taxable income, IRA Financial says. Legal expertise and a proper custodian help manage these complexities.\n\nInvestor gains in a self\u2011directed Roth, if structured properly, can compound aggressively over time, especially when early stakes in startups go on to scale significantly.\n\nSee Also: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here\u2019s how you can earn passive income with just $10.\n\nPlatforms such as IRA Financial have become central to this shift. As a leading custodian for self\u2011directed IRAs and Solo 401(k) accounts, IRA Financial provides tools for individuals to manage non\u2011traditional assets inside a retirement account. The company specializes in helping investors hold assets like real estate, crypto, farmland, precious metals, and private equity while maintaining compliance with IRS rules.\n\nIts flat\u2011fee structure, expert guidance, and support for checkbook IRAs and Roth strategies have made it a preferred choice for investors who want more control over their retirement funds. The platform's services extend to handling trustee tasks, tax filings, and reporting, allowing investors to focus on building wealth in the areas they know best. IRA Financial has earned industry recognition for innovations such as crypto\u2011enabled retirement investing and real\u2011time online account management.\n\nBy removing many of the traditional limitations of retirement accounts, IRA Financial gives investors the ability to move beyond Wall Street's menu of stocks and bonds and pursue a strategy that aligns with their knowledge, goals, and risk tolerance.\n\nThe post\u2011crypto boom landscape has created a new appetite for alternative assets. From farmland leases to startup equity, the options inside a self\u2011directed IRA can be as unconventional as they are potentially rewarding.\n\nSelf\u2011directed IRAs offer a structure where these ambitions can be realized without abandoning tax advantages. For those who want more control over how their retirement money works, platforms like IRA Financial represent a pathway to build a portfolio that looks very different from Wall Street's standard playbook.\n\nRead Next: Are you rich?

Learn more\nNEW YORK - From collectibles like art, fine wine, and sports memorabilia to traditional private market investments such as private equity, infrastructure, and timberland, alternative assets have attracted growing attention in recent years. While these investments have historically been limited to institutional investors and the ultra-wealthy, digital platforms are now expanding access and lowering the bar for entry.\nHowever, trust and awareness remain significant barriers to broader adoption among retail investors, according to our recent survey, conducted by Opinium.\nThe survey found that one in four Americans (26%) are either planning to invest in alternative assets within the next few years or will strongly consider it. Additionally, 48% of respondents expressed cautious interest, saying they might invest in alternatives in the near future.\nBut interest is only part of the story. Our report uncovers where investor curiosity meets confusion - and what\u2019s holding many back from taking the next step. From the appeal of alternatives in uncertain markets to the surprising gaps in platform awareness and the trust factors that could unlock adoption, the findings offer a fresh, data-backed look at a rapidly shifting investment landscape.\nDownload the report to explore the insights and opportunities, reshaping the future of retail investing.\nMethodology\nLansons partnered with strategic insights agency Opinium to conduct a nationally representative survey of 2,000 Americans. The survey was weighted using the latest figures from the U.S. Census Bureau. \u201cActive Investors\u201d is defined as anyone who has an individual investment account, including in stocks, bonds, crypto, etc.\nThe study was conducted from September 26th, 2024, to October 1st, 2024."

      "text": "Crypto is moving out of the backroom and into the mainstream; financial institutions should take note\nThe growth of digital assets started much like a grassroots movement. Those seeking an alternative way to create wealth or individuals who championed the decentralization of financial power have been the foundation of crypto from the start. Retail investors continue to make up a meaningful segment of investors and demand in the burgeoning digital asset ecosystem. Their expectation is to increase allocations, seek out ways to access new services from traditional financial firms, embrace tokenization and experiment with new use cases to make digital assets more than simply stores of value. Financial firms and merchants will be successful in capturing these new customers through the expansion of services retail investors are clamoring for around payment systems, wealth management, retirement planning, trading, custody, and lending products connected to digital assets.\nSurvey methodology\nConducted in March 2024, the survey aimed to better understand how retail investors think about digital assets (including sentiment, allocations, future expectations, tokenization, and payments); 1,034 retail investors were surveyed. This included 570 self-reported accredited investors and 464 non-accredited investors. Survey respondents self-reported \u201caccredited investor\u201d status with this being defined as >$1m in assets or >$200k in income for each of the past three years. Respondents were roughly 50/50 male and female and included a mix of investors who have/are currently invested in digital assets (e.g., crypto, stablecoins) and digital asset products (e.g., funds, trusts, derivatives), and those who have never invested. Survey respondents were globally distributed with 464 from the US, 227 from Europe, 185 from Canada, 128 form Asia, and three from rest of world."

      "text": "- Warren Buffett is one of the greatest investors of all time, which has led to him becoming the fifth-richest person in the world.\n- The legendary investor says the true measure of success in life has nothing to do with how much money you have.\n- The next correction is closer than you think. Find out how Tom Gentile plans to trade it, live on Wednesday.\nBillionaire Warren Buffett is one of the greatest investors of all time, but that doesn't make him successful by his standards. There's only one measure of success in life \u2014 according to the \"Oracle of Omaha\" \u2014 and it doesn't have anything to do with money.\nWhat To Know: With a net worth of more than $155 billion, Buffett is widely considered one of the most successful investors of all time, but not by his own measures.\nAccording to a CNBC report citing Alice Shroeder's \"The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life,\" students at the University of Georgia once asked the Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK-A) BRK CEO about his definition of success.\nBuffett reportedly told the crowd that one's success in life should only be measured by the number of people who are important to you and who actually love you.\n\"I know people who have a lot of money, and they get testimonial dinners and they get hospital wings named after them. But the truth is that nobody in the world loves them. If you get to my age in life and nobody thinks well of you, I don\u2019t care how big your bank account is, your life is a disaster,\" Buffett said.\nMoney can buy lots of things, especially when you reach billionaire status, but love is not for sale, he said, explaining that it's actually quite the opposite.\n\"The only way to get love is to be lovable. It\u2019s very irritating if you have a lot of money. You\u2019d like to think you could write a check: I\u2019ll buy a million dollars\u2019 worth of love. But it doesn\u2019t work that way. The more you give love away, the more you get,\" Buffett said.\nIn 2006, the billionaire investor pledged to slowly give all of his Berkshire Hathaway stock to philanthropic foundations. More than 99% of his wealth is set to go to philanthropy during his lifetime or at death.\nNow at 94 years of age, Buffett currently has an estimated net worth of $157.9 billion, making him the fifth-richest person in the world, according to Forbes.\nAfter donating roughly $4 billion at an annual charity dinner in 2022, the Berkshire CEO passed Bill Gates as the biggest philanthropist of all time, per Forbes. To Gates\u2019 credit, he announced earlier this month that he plans to give away \u201cvirtually all\u201d of his wealth over the next 20 years.\nRead Next:\n- From Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway To Jeff Bezos\u2019 Amazon \u2014 Bitcoin Is Now Outshining These Wall Street Titans\n- Billionaire Warren Buffett\u2019s Daughter Asked Him For A $41,000 Loan To Remodel Her Tiny Kitchen \u2014 His Response: \u2018Why Not Go To The Bank?\u2019\nSome elements of this story were previously reported by Benzinga and it has been updated.\nImage: Shutterstock.\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "Key Takeaways\n- ProPublica published the Lord of the Roths, which received spirited reviews.\n- Tech Mogul Peter Thiel used a retirement account for investments that yielded $5Btax-free gains.\n- Alto IRA makes what ProPublica calls \u201csupercharged investment vehicles\u201d accessible and affordable for everyday individual investors.\nProPublica published the hotly discussed Lord of the Roths: How Tech Mogul Peter Thiel Turned a Retirement Account for the Middle Class Into a $5 Billion Tax-Free Piggy Bank. From news reports to Twitter and even the halls of Congress, the collective response was immediate and predictably divided.\nSome praised him for having the foresight to invest funds from a self-directed IRA in the then-startup, Paypal. Others accused the Paypal co-founder of unfairly profiting from a tax-advantaged investment vehicle intended to provide middle-class Americans a means to build a healthy nest egg.\nWhether existing IRA regulations make smart tax policy is debatable, and Congress may decide to revisit these rules. But at the time Thiel invested in the company he was co-founding using a self-directed Roth IRA, he did so in accordance with IRA rules.\nWe\u2019ll explain how Roth IRAs work, as well as how companies like Alto, with its Alto IRA account, make what ProPublica calls \u201csupercharged investment vehicles\u201d accessible and affordable for you to do the same.\nWhat is a Roth IRA?\nTraditional IRAs have been around since the mid-1970s. By that time, employee pensions were already in rapid decline. So Congress\u2014concerned by the number of people with no retirement savings\u2014created the independent retirement account (IRA).\nThe idea was simple: As with a 401(k), you contribute to an investment plan pre-tax up to a certain amount each year. Likewise, earnings from dividends, gains, and interest aren\u2019t taxed until you make a withdrawal upon reaching 59 1/2 years of age. Upon withdrawal, you\u2019ll be taxed on your earnings based on your current income tax rate.\nIt was, and is, a good idea for many investors. The problem was that few Americans were using them. So in 1997, Congress established the Roth IRA.\nA Roth IRA is similar to a traditional IRA in that it shares the same set of yearly contribution limits and can be invested in the same ways. The main differences are that you invest after-tax money and pay no income taxes upon withdrawal, except in the case of an early withdrawal.\nNot only do your investments grow tax-free in a Roth IRA, no matter how big it becomes, but your withdrawals are also tax-free (subject to a five-year holding period upon contribution). You can even sell your holdings and reinvest the money in further opportunities, all within the tax-free confines of your Roth IRA.\nThis is exactly what Peter Thiel did.\nHow Peter Thiel used a self-directed Roth IRA to amass a fortune\nIn 1999\u2014the year Thiel made his initial Roth IRA investment\u2014the maximum yearly contribution for IRAs was just $2,000. However, the Clinton Administration, concerned the ultra-wealthy might abuse the new Roth IRAs as tax shelters, barred earners above a certain income level from participating.\nBut Thiel was making less than the $110,000 earnings cap when he made his $1,700 contribution and used his Roth IRA to purchase his founding PayPal shares.\nWhat does it mean for a Roth IRA to be self-directed?\nBasically, self-directed means investors (or an advisor working on the investor\u2019s behalf) choose the investments based on their own investment criteria rather than criteria set by a prospective custodian\u2019s investment committee.\nHis savvy paid off. Within three years, PayPal had gone public and was bought by eBay, catapulting Thiel\u2019s IRA to around $28.5 million.\nHe then sold his shares in PayPal and began to reinvest the money, including a $500,000 pre-IPO stake in Facebook that would become worth an estimated $1 billion! And because he did so within his Roth IRA, these investment gains were all tax-free and available for continued reinvestment.\nIRA contribution limits\nThe IRS revises IRA contribution limits every few years. In 2021, $6,000 is the maximum contribution. However, people 50 and older can contribute $7,000 per year (the additional $1,000 is referred to as a \u201ccatch-up\u201d contribution).\nMaking an investment strategy of the wealthy accessible to everyone\nPeter Thiel\u2019s success may seem unrealistic for the average investor, and it\u2019s true he had some very unique opportunities given his close involvement with PayPal and Silicon Valley, but remember he started with $1,700. Regardless, you don\u2019t have to be well-connected or already wealthy to invest like him.\n\"We all should have the ability and access to these types of investment opportunities.\"\nEric Satz,\nCEO and Founder, Alto\n\u201cThe point of AltoIRA is to make alternative assets accessible in a cost-effective manner for all individuals,\u201d Alto CEO and founder, Eric Satz, told Fintech Today. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have $500,000 to be able to invest in Facebook. You can have $500 or $5,000 or $50,000. The ROI is the same. The absolute dollars may be different, but we all should have the ability and access to these types of investment opportunities.\u201d\nSo if you think you\u2019ve found the next Facebook, you do you! Just be aware that you\u2019re responsible for lining up the deal and doing due diligence to ensure the investment is legal.\nWhy portfolio diversification is a must\nNew technology may mean opportunities once out of reach for everyday people are now accessible, but it\u2019s still important to remember that no investment is without risk. There was no guarantee PayPal would succeed, and it\u2019s likely Peter Thiel himself has made losing investments over the years.\nFor this reason, it\u2019s crucial that you do your homework before investing.\nRisk is also why portfolio diversification is so important. A healthy investment portfolio typically depends on a mix of not just traditional assets\u2014such as stocks and bonds\u2014but also alternative, or non-traditional, assets. There\u2019s a reason for this. If all your investments are in, say, stocks and the market takes a dive right before you\u2019re set to retire, your portfolio may not recover in time. Diversifying your portfolio allows you to mix potentially high-reward (but also high-risk) investments with lower-risk (but also unlikely to yield exceptional returns) investments.\n\u201cPortfolio diversification is not only, I think, the best tool we can employ, it\u2019s also a free tool,\u201d says Satz. \u201cI encourage people to not bet it all on red. Not put it all in crypto, not put all their money in real estate, not put all their money in the public markets, but instead, spread it out, reduce volatility and, over time, increase returns.\u201d\nTo see this concept in action, look no further than the investment strategies of the ultra-rich. Whereas the average investor holds only about 2\u20135% of their portfolio in alternative assets, the largest pension and endowment funds average around 25\u201350%. Not only does diversification help mitigate risk, but alternative assets\u2014while at times riskier\u2014tend to offer higher returns.\nThe bottom line\nYou don\u2019t need to be Peter Theil to invest in the next Facebook.\nIf ProPublica\u2019s piece and Thiel\u2019s investment outcomes show us anything, it\u2019s that a Roth IRA can be an incredibly powerful investment vehicle with the right investments. And hopefully, it brings more attention to the fact that it\u2019s never been easier for everyday people to invest in private companies\u2026 not just the Peter Thiels of the world.\nThat\u2019s the core of Alto\u2019s mission: To make investing opportunities once available only to the well-connected, accessible to everyone and, in return, help more Americans invest for the retirement they want.\nAs Eric Satz is fond of saying, \u201cKnow it can be done.\u201d\nInvest in alternative assets using tax-advantaged retirement funds."

      "text": "The legendary Omaha investor Warren Buffett is often quoted saying, \u201cIf you don\u2019t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\u201d In other words, passive income is something all professionals can and should strive for; otherwise, they\u2019ll never make money work for them. In the age of rapid technological and financial transformation, achieving passive income is more accessible than ever. You can invest in expertly vetted, cash-flowing rentals starting as low as $10.\nBuffett has been exceptionally good at heeding his own advice. His investment company Berkshire Hathaway is raking in $3.5 billion per year in passive dividends from four stocks alone. But it took a long time to get to that point. The Oracle of Omaha had invested in these stocks long before they yielded as much as they do today. However, his market-beating track record is almost impossible to outdo and a team of financial experts heavily aids it that Berkshire Hathaway has under its roof. Real estate could be a much more viable option if you don\u2019t have the means to invest in individual stocks without exposing yourself to severe risks.\nDespite occasional setbacks, real estate remains one of the most robust long-term investments today. Home prices have doubled in 68 of the 100 largest U.S. urban areas in less than ten years. Statistically speaking, you\u2019d have at least 100% more if you had invested in home equity in any of them ten years ago. But doing that required a substantial upfront cost. Through fractional real estate investing, however, you can now invest in the shares of a home listed on an investment platform and receive passive rent dividends while your stake goes up with the market.\nCurrently, single-family homes in the U.S. return an average of 8.5%. Fundrise goes out of its way to outperform that and return as much as you would get by actively investing in real estate units, only with zero effort and headache.\nJust like Warren Buffett, Arrived hires an array of financial experts whose primary goal is to find and acquire the most promising single-family rentals in the U.S. The platform selects only 0.2% of considered properties, and you can invest in their shares before they sell out.\nFundrise currently boasts a community of 385,000 active investors who eagerly await new offerings. Unsurprisingly, they generally sell out in weeks or even days, but the platform regularly drops new listings. A new batch of prime single-family rentals may be available right now, and you can secure their shares for as little as $10.\nMore Fractional Real Estate Investment Platforms\nDisclaimer: Please be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.

      "text": "In the United States, the concept of being rich is often a subject of discussion, curiosity and, sometimes, aspiration. Charles Schwab's 2023 Modern Wealth Survey provides insights into this topic, revealing that the average American equates being wealthy with a net worth of approximately $2.2 million.\nAlthough the most recent data from the Federal Reserve reveals the average American household is a millionaire with a net worth of $1.06 million, looking at the median or midpoint value portrays a more accurate picture. Based on the October report from the Federal Reserve, the median net worth of U.S. households overall is $192,900.\nHave over $100K in investable assets and want to make sure you retire with a multi-million nest egg? Speak to a professional \u2014 Take your free retirement quiz today and speak to a vetted fiduciary financial adviser.\nBut how spot-on are Americans\u2019 perceptions of wealth?\nTop 2% wealth: The top 2% of Americans have a net worth of about $2.472 million, aligning closely with the surveyed perception of wealth.\nTop 5% wealth: The next tier, the top 5%, has a net worth of around $1.03 million.\nTop 10% wealth: The top 10% of the population has a net worth of approximately $854,900.\nThese figures illustrate a dramatic wealth gradient in the U.S., indicating a substantial increase in net worth needed to move from the top 10% to the top 2%.\nUnderstanding Wealth Beyond Numbers\nWealth is not solely about the figures in your bank account or investment portfolio; it's also about how you perceive and use your resources. Here are some tips and perspectives to understand and potentially achieve wealth.\nSavings and spending habits: Being able to save, that is, spending less than you earn, is a foundational aspect of accumulating wealth. Establishing robust financial habits like budgeting and goal-setting can pave the way to wealth, regardless of the specific dollar amount.\nLiving below your means: In a world where consumerism is rampant, living below your means is a key principle. This might involve cutting unnecessary expenses, like reducing monthly subscriptions or dining out less frequently. Such habits not only bolster savings but also prepare you for financial emergencies.\nAffording desires: The ability to save and spend wisely often leads to the capacity to afford what you desire, whether it is a new vehicle or a vacation. Achieving financial goals is a strong indicator of wealth.\nLife goals over money: Wealth is not just about accumulating money but also about fulfilling life aspirations. Whether it's running a business, becoming debt-free or saving for retirement, having a clear vision is crucial.\nMoney as a tool: Viewing money as a means to improve your life, rather than a source of stress, can shift your approach to wealth. Small steps like allocating extra funds toward high-interest debt can help in building a brighter financial future.\nFlexibility and options: Wealth often equates to having choices \u2014 whether it's taking time off for family, investing in a business idea or learning a new skill. This flexibility is a significant indicator of wealth.\nPreparing for retirement: A key aspect of being wealthy is having a solid retirement plan. This involves understanding how much to save and starting early to build a financial foundation for the golden years.\nFind a Vetted Financial Advisor\n- Finding a fiduciary financial advisor doesn't have to be hard. SmartAsset's free tool matches you with up to 3 financial advisors that serve your area in 5 minutes.\n- Each advisor has been vetted by SmartAsset and is held to a fiduciary standard to act in your best interests. Get on the path toward achieving your financial goals!\nA Subjective Concept\nWhile having a net worth of about $2.2 million is seen as the benchmark for being rich in America, it's essential to remember that wealth is a subjective concept. Healthy financial habits and personal perspectives on money are crucial in defining and achieving wealth. By focusing on smart financial planning and aligning money with personal values and goals, people can navigate their path toward what they consider to be wealthy.\nFinancial advisors can provide tailored advice and strategies to help achieve specific financial goals. Leveraging their expertise, people can effectively pursue their unique definition of wealth, encompassing asset growth, retirement security and other financial aspirations.\nTake Action: Locate a financial advisor near you, for free.\n*Jeannine Mancini has written about personal finance and investment for the past 13 years in a variety of publications, including Zacks, The Nest and eHow.

Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nWhile many companies tout and claim AI capabilities, only one has developed a technology that\u2019s delivering triple-digit returns on investment for some of the largest Fortune 1000 companies.\nTake Hasbro for example. When the iconic toy company wanted to relaunch HeroQuest\u2014a beloved 1980s board game\u2014they faced a familiar marketing challenge\u2014how to reach both nostalgic fans and new audiences in a fragmented digital landscape.\nTheir solution came from a company most people have never heard of, despite its growing influence with major brands. Using RAD Intel's AI-powered platform, Hasbro achieved over 120% improved paid performance, nearly 90% higher engagement rates, and doubled content effectiveness \u2013 impressive results in today\u2019s highly competitive, noisy gaming market.\nNamed a \u201cgroundbreaking step for the creator economy\u201d by Fast Company, Rad Intel has already attracted the interest of more than 9,000 investors, including insiders from Adobe, Fidelity Ventures, Google, Meta, Amazon, and YouTube, and raised more than $41 million.\nHaving seen its valuation grow 1,600% in just four years, RAD Intel is now offering accredited investors an early opportunity to join a company that other investors have called their \u201cbest seed investment ever.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s more, RAD Intel has secured its official NASDAQ ticker\u2014RADI. It\u2019s locked in and marks a significant step toward the public markets, backed by real traction and accelerating scale.\nFrom A Fortune 1000 Secret to an $85M Valuation\nFounded by serial entrepreneur Jeremy Barnett and tech veteran Bradley Silver, RAD Intel has quietly built a strong client roster and boasts activations across the likes of Fortune 1000 brands, including Hasbro, Skechers, Home Depot, Sephora, Fenty, Sweetgreen, MGM, Omnicom, Since Tomorrow, Glossier, Athelta, and The North Face.\nThe company's rise hasn't gone completely unnoticed by institutional investors, either. RAD Intel has secured over $49 million in funding from venture capitalists, Fortune 1000 companies and tech industry insiders\u2014including Adobe, and insiders from Google, Amazon, YouTube, and Meta.\nThat traction is opening doors fast\u2014embedding Rad Intel in every critical moment where brands battle for consumer attention and measurable growth. Investors have seen the company\u2019s valuation grow from $5 million to $85 million in just four years, in large part due to being a leader in AI.\nAccording to Boston Consulting Group, companies that are already scaling AI\u2014like Rad Intel\u2014 expect a 60% higher revenue growth over the next three years than their peers. Additionally, AI leaders achieved 1.5 times higher revenue growth, 1.6 times greater shareholder returns, and 1.4 times higher ROIs.\nAI That Actually Works: 12+ Years of Research Behind the Tech\nAI is everywhere these days, but RAD Intel's technology stands apart. Built on more than a decade of research and development \u2014 and years of real-world client success.\n\"We've created an artificial intelligence that understands the language of the internet,\" CEO Jeremy Barnett told Forbes last year. The proprietary AI analyzes datasets from Reddit, Google, and social platforms to gauge real-time sentiments and trends, helping brands make data-driven decisions rather than relying on outdated assumptions or personal bias.\nThe platform's capabilities solve three marketing challenges:\n1. The Audience Problem\nRAD Intel's persona generator reveals exactly who a brand's customers are\u2014their topics, interests, and the triggers that drive them to action. It eliminates guesswork in customer targeting.\n2. The Influencer Problem\nThe platform's AI identifies the perfect personalities to deliver a brand's message for maximum ROI, ranking influencers based on expertise, audience demographics, and authentic engagement.\n3. The Content Problem\nBefore content creation begins, RAD Intel's technology reveals what customers care about, who's best to deliver the message, and the key ingredients for content that resonates\u2014and often goes viral.\nThe capabilities have delivered impressive results across industries:\n- For Sweetgreen: nearly 200% improved ad performance and 25%+ improved cost per acquisition\n- For The Black Tux: 40% cost savings and over 90% campaign lift\n- For Ro Health: nearly 4x ROI and 5x engagements\n- For MGM Resorts: nearly 3.3x ROI and 482,000 engagements\nGrowth Strategy: Doubling Down on Success\nRAD Intel isn't just adding clients\u2014it's deepening relationships with existing ones. Contracts for 2025 have already doubled from 2024, with expanded agreements from top clients like Hasbro and Omnicom added to the fold.\nThe company is also implementing a novel growth strategy called \"Artificial Intelligence Buyouts\" (AIBOs), which refers to acquiring small and medium-sized marketing agencies and integrating RAD Intel's AI technology to boost their capabilities and profitability.\nAccording to its website, the company \u201caims to acquire legacy marketing agencies and integrate RAD Intel's technology to deliver material revenue synergies and operational efficiencies.\" They're targeting agencies with $5 million to $30 million in revenue that are EBITDA positive with strong recurring client bases, established sales forces and experienced client success teams.\nThis strategy will allow RAD Intel to scale rapidly through acquisition while bringing AI capabilities to traditional agencies\u2014creating value for both the acquired businesses and RAD Intel investors.\nExpanding the AI Edge\nRad Intel recently raised $12 million through its Reg A funding round, which it will use to fuel several growth initiatives:\n- Further development of RAD Intel's technology to improve paid advertising across Google, TikTok, and Meta\n- Innovation of enterprise solutions with API partners like TikTok to enhance content insights\n- Recruitment of top-tier talent across AI, product development, operations, and sales\n- Implementation of additional self-serve features for enterprise clients\n- Continuous improvement of client success rates through AI-informed performance analytics\nEntrepreneur magazine recognized RAD Intel as \"positioned to influence the market\" in the AI revolution, noting that \"the true winners in the AI revolution will be those who can effectively leverage it to solve real-world problems.\"\nLimited-Time Investment Opportunity\nInterested accredited investors have an opportunity to join before it's too late. This pre-IPO high-growth startup is currently offering equity shares at $0.63 each, with a minimum investment of $4,999.68.\nAs Fast Company said, \"It's only a matter of time before RAD's platform is a household name.\" For accredited investors looking to participate in the AI transformation of marketing, this offering represents an opportunity to join over 9,000 others who have already recognized RAD Intel's potential to reshape how brands connect with consumers in the digital age.\nDisclaimers\nPlease be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.

Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nYou see a shocking number of ads daily \u2013 researchers estimate between 6,000 and 10,000 and 375 to 625 per waking hour. In the modern age, most of them come from social media apps whose entire business model revolves around constantly showing you ads and keeping 100% of the revenue. But what if users got a share? That company might just grow its revenue by 32,481% in three years, help users earn and save $325 million and be named Deloitte's fastest-growing software company in North America. That\u2019s what Mode Mobile did. You can still get in for just $0.30 per share.\nReaching Financial Stability One Tap at a Time\nMost Americans can\u2019t afford a $1,000 emergency bill. That means many are one car breakdown or ER visit away from serious financial trouble. There's no quick fix to such a big financial challenge that over 50% of Americans face. However, it's safe to bet that the masses will flock to any good solutions. Mode Mobile created one such solution years ago by allowing people to earn money doing what they already spend a third of their waking hours on \u2013 tapping, scrolling and looking at their smartphone screens.\nMode Mobile developed a smartphone called EarnPhone, which allows users to earn and save money by playing video games, listening to music and reading the news. With the phone priced at an affordable $99, the barriers to adoption are low. However, users can earn income on their existing devices as well. This extreme competitiveness has allowed Mode Mobile to attract over 50 million registered beta users. Launching the finalized version could bring in millions more, helping the company reach its goal of $150 million in annual revenue within three years.\n6,955,000,000 Users to Go\nCurrently, seven billion smartphones worldwide provide functionality or entertainment but take all the profits. Mode Mobile\u2019s disruption offers the same benefits but allows users to earn money at a time when the prices of goods are skyrocketing. Just like Airbnb lets users earn extra cash by renting out their bedrooms and Uber allows users to make money on their rides back home from work, Mode Mobile wants to enable its users to make money from their phones. However, its total addressable market is much larger than Airbnb\u2019s and Uber\u2019s \u2013 currently at over $1 trillion.\nYou can invest in Mode Mobile at $0.30 per share with a minimum investment of $4,950. Plus, the company is offering the chance to earn up to 120% in bonus shares, if you invest more. All funding rounds open to non-accredited investors, including Mode Mobile\u2019s, are limited in time. So, if you\u2019d like to be part of the future it's building, consider acting soon.\nDisclaimer:\nAN OFFERING STATEMENT REGARDING THIS OFFERING HAS BEEN FILED WITH THE SEC. THE SEC HAS QUALIFIED THAT OFFERING STATEMENT, WHICH ONLY MEANS THAT THE COMPANY MAY MAKE SALES OF THE SECURITIES DESCRIBED BY THE OFFERING STATEMENT. THE OFFERING CIRCULAR THAT IS PART OF THAT OFFERING STATEMENT IS AVAILABLE HERE.\nMode Mobile recently received their ticker reservation with Nasdaq ($MODE), indicating an intent to IPO in the next 24 months. An intent to IPO is no guarantee that an actual IPO will occur.\nThe Deloitte rankings are based on submitted applications and public company database research, with winners selected based on their fiscal-year revenue growth percentage over a three-year period.\nDisclaimer: Please be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.

      "text": "Retirement, ideally a period of relaxation and enjoyment after years of hard work, is often envisioned as a time to pursue hobbies, travel or simply unwind. But without a solid financial plan, many Americans worry they\u2019ll outlive their money. This fear is often more acute among married couples, who face the added complexity of planning for two people with varying financial needs.\nIf you're 50 or older and have over $100,000 in investable assets, now is the time to take retirement planning seriously. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be difficult. WiserAdvisor's free tool matches you with a vetted financial advisor that meets your needs, with no obligation to hire.\n60% of Americans Lack a Retirement-Specific Account\u2013 Do you?\nA NerdWallet study, using the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances, indicates that 60% of Americans lack a retirement-specific account. The disparity in average household retirement savings by age group further illustrates this issue:\n- Under 35: $49,130 (median: $18,880)\n- Ages 35 to 44: $141,520 (median: $45,000)\n- Ages 45 to 54: $313,220 (median: $115,000)\n- Ages 55 to 64: $537,560 (median: $185,000)\n- Ages 65 to 74: $609,230 (median: $200,000)\nThese figures show a significant gap between average and median savings, pointing to a broad spectrum of financial preparedness across different age groups. Those nearing retirement, especially those with $250,000 or more in retirement savings, stand to benefit most from expert, fiduciary guidance.\nTo guide couples in their retirement planning, T. Rowe Price, a reputable global investment management firm, provides savings benchmarks as multiples of income, varying by household income and marital status.\nFor example, a dual-income married couple with an annual income of $75,000 at age 55 should have retirement savings equal to five times their income, which should increase to 8.5 times by age 65. These benchmarks scale up for higher-income brackets, and for those with $250,000 or more in assets, strategic investment planning becomes especially important.\nFind a Vetted Financial Advisor\nIf you\u2019ve worked hard to build a nest egg of $100,000 or more, WiserAdvisor can connect you with a trusted, independent fiduciary advisor who understands the unique financial needs of pre-retirees and retirees.\nFiduciary advisors are legally required to put your interests first.

If you have at least $100,000 in investable assets, WiserAdvisor can match you with a pre-screened fiduciary financial advisor in your area.\nBook here to get started; no cost, no obligation.\nBenzinga Money is a reader-supported publication.

      "text": "Can You Invest in Agriculture With Your Self-Directed IRA?\nOne of the many alternatives available for self-directed IRA inventors is agriculture. Agriculture investments can help your retirement funds grow in two ways: First, a farm produces crops, and these crops generate income when sold. Second, the value of the land may increase over time, resulting in tax-deferred capital gains. Farmland investments combine diversity and the ever-present need for food with a growing population, making the assets a potentially viable, long-term addition to your retirement portfolio. Let\u2019s discuss a bit more about investing in farmland with your self-directed IRA, and what you can expect from the process.\nTo learn more about alternative investments you can take advantage of with your self-directed IRA, contact the team at First Western Federal Savings Bank. Our lenders will walk you through how non-recourse loans can be used in tandem with your self-directed IRA to invest in real estate and more.\nInvesting in Agriculture Using an IRA\nWith a self-directed IRA, you have the option of using your retirement funds to invest in horses, cows, small farms, corn and grain fields, apple orchards, and so much more. But, investing in an individual farm, or even a herd of animals, often requires a significant initial capital investment, as well as the continual expense of overseeing agricultural activities, caring for animals, and/or leasing farm equipment.\nAll expenses related to the investment must be made through the IRA, so the IRA must have sufficient funds to pay these amounts. Having to rely on outside capital to cover expenses can lead to the loss of tax benefits or the incurrence of penalties. Also, all income generated by the investment must be paid into your IRA.\nOwning a farm outright is a great investment, but can take millions of dollars to make it profitable, not to mention a lot of knowledge, experience, and hard work. A better way to create income from a farmland investment in the IRA is to lease the farm out to an agricultural operator. The income from the lease goes right into the self directed IRA, tax free or tax deferred. And the value of the farmland continues to appreciate.\nWhy Investing in Farmland Makes Sense\nSome investors compare farmland to real estate because they are both tangible assets that produce yield and can have an appreciating value on the underlying investment. Investing in farmland, however, means tapping into all of the benefits of the investment without the burdens of capital gains taxes or income taxes on profit distributions. Any profit distributions you receive go right into your retirement account. This allows the profit to grow tax-deferred, which ultimately means you keep more of your investment and grow your retirement nest egg more aggressively.\nTrustee\u2019s Role\nAlthough you make the decisions concerning your self-directed IRA, it is up to the account trustee to handle the actual management of the account and its holdings, including farmland. The trustee makes the purchase and sale of properties and pays property taxes and other bills out of the IRA funds. When the IRA receives income from the farm, the trustee reinvests it according to your instructions.\nProhibited Transactions\nAdditionally, an agricultural investment that provides a personal benefit to the investor is considered a prohibited transaction by the IRS. An example of this would be the purchase of a timber stand where the investor wants to hunt. You also cannot purchase a piece of agricultural property you or a family member owns with a self-directed IRA. The IRS considers this self-dealing. Furthermore, you\u2019re also unable to perform any work on the IRA-opened property yourself \u2014 your IRA must hire a trustworthy property manager to do so, but you\u2019ll be the one who has to find a good fit.\nSome more prohibited transactions and conflicts of interests include:\n- You can\u2019t draw a salary from the farm\n- You can\u2019t hire your spouse, children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, or those of your spouse, nor any entity they control\n- You can\u2019t commingle your personal funds with the IRA funds\n- You can borrow money, but only a non-recourse loan. You can\u2019t sign a personal guarantee or pledge anything as collateral that is outside the IRA\n- You can\u2019t take the livestock depreciation deduction\nThe Bottom Line\nAlternative investments with your self-directed IRA allow an abundance of opportunities. Adding farmland assets to your portfolio is an opportunity that can mature and strengthen over time with the proper care, but like many other investments, has to be done with purpose. Due diligence, research, and care can help grow your investment and your portfolio, even if you don\u2019t have a green thumb!\nTo learn more about what you can invest in with your self-directed IRA, especially when used in tandem with a self-directed IRA, then contact the lenders at First Western Federal Savings Bank. Our lenders would be happy to discuss your current situation and financial goals and assist you in diversifying your portfolio. Give us a call today."
