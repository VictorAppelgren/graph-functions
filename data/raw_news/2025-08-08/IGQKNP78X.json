  "description": "CUSMA renegotiation could lead to a deepening of the US-Canada relationship, but that could come at the cost of trade independence. Read on.",
  "content": "The Canadian government failed to reach a trade deal with the United States before the Aug. 1 deadline. As a result, U.S. President Donald Trump increased the blanket tariff on imports of Canadian goods from 25 per cent to 35 per cent, while tariffs on steel, aluminum and some automotive imports have remained unchanged. Crucially, the so-called \u201cCUSMA exemption\u201d on goods that are compliant with the existing Canada-U.S.-Mexico trade agreement has also remained in place.\n\nMany have pointed out that the lack of a deal makes Canada an outlier among U.S. trading partners. The EU, the U.K., South Korea, Japan and many others managed to clinch a deal before the deadline. Even Mexico, which did not reach a deal, was given a formal 90-day extension.\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\u2022 There was an error, please provide a valid email address. A welcome email is on its way. If you don't see it, please check your junk folder. The next issue of Top Stories will soon be in your inbox. We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again\n\nBut looking at the U.S. agreements with other countries, one can genuinely question whether Canada could have successfully lowered its effective tariff rate, even with a deal. So far all the trade deals reached by the U.S. include some tariffs. More importantly, no country has escaped the 50 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminum, except for the U.K., which faces 25 per cent tariffs. With little chance that Canada could have avoided tariffs on steel and aluminum, reducing the effective tariff rate would have been a tall order.\n\nMoreover, the extreme focus on the state of current negotiations and the need for an immediate deal to avoid tariffs overlooks a much bigger threat to Canada: The CUSMA renegotiation scheduled for Summer 2026. Considering that, any deal reached now might only be a band-aid that will be ripped off next year \u2014 and it may hurt.\n\nThe importance of CUSMA for Canada cannot be overstated. Canada\u2019s effective tariff rate on exports to the U.S. is one of the lowest in the world, primarily due to the CUSMA exemption.\n\nAs such, a major trade irritant for the U.S. has been third countries\u2019 use of Canada and Mexico to circumvent tariffs, with China, for example, making significant investments in manufacturing in Mexico, evidenced by the foreign direct investment data.\n\nWith that in mind, one of the aims of the U.S. administration with the CUSMA renegotiation could be to move from a Free-Trade Agreement to something that more closely resembles a customs union. Such an arrangement would mean that Canada and Mexico would have to commit to match the tariffs the U.S. imposes on every other country, potentially leading to a difficult choice for Canada.",

      "text": "William Watson: A lament for the postwar trading system\nSkimming WTO tariff data for 2024 evokes nostalgia for a liberal world trading regime that in just six months Donald Trump has largely demolished\nMy beach reading this summer is the WTO\u2019s World Tariff Profiles 2025. Yes, it\u2019s a brick: I do like to snooze on the beach. The title says 2025 because that\u2019s when it comes out. But the tariffs are all for 2024. Scrolling through the tables already produces nostalgia for a time now maybe gone for good. The proud tower of the postwar liberal trade regime, though not quite yet fallen, is under severe bombardment from Washington.\nThe Proud Tower was a 1966 book by American historian Barbara Tuchman, a followup to her wildly successful The Guns of August, the story of how, almost accidentally, European leaders started World War I. The Proud Tower was a series of sketches of the Edwardian era that trench warfare pounded into ruins. The phrase itself Tuchman got from Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s \u201cThe City in the Sea\u201d: While from a proud tower in the town/Death looks gigantically down.\n(Texans, take note: One of the book\u2019s chapters tells how U.S. House speaker Thomas Reed handled the \u201cdisappearing quorum.\u201d The rule used to be that if House members didn\u2019t respond when their name was called, they didn\u2019t count towards the quorum and so by staying silent could block proceedings. Reed simply directed the clerk to count everyone present. When one member objected, Reed replied he was only \u201cmaking a statement of the fact that the gentleman from Kentucky is present. Does he deny it?\u201d Whether Reed would have used the police to track down absent members, as Texas is currently doing with its disappearing quorum, is impossible to say.)\nThe apparently imminent end of the WTO regime won\u2019t involve as much death and destruction as the end of the long peace did in 1914. But over the past few decades liberal trade has helped lift literally billions of people around the world out of poverty and that will be put at risk.\n- William Watson: Tell Canadians: What does the U.S. want and what won\u2019t we give?\n- William Watson: AI predicts Trump tariffs will raise U.S. prices\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nReading through the tables, how different a time last year already seems! The simple average of U.S. tariffs was 3.3 per cent. The simple average on non-agricultural products: 3.1. The equivalent percentages for us were 3.8 and 2.0.\nHow is it we had a higher average tariff than they did (3.8 per cent versus 3.0) but a lower tariff on non-agricultural products (2.0 versus 3.1)? Because our ag tariffs were higher: 15.0 per cent versus the Americans\u2019 5.0 per cent. Agriculture is the most protected sector everywhere. All over the world, farmers know how to do politics. Money may be the mother\u2019s milk of politics, but cow\u2019s milk is its obsession.\nWhen you weight the tariffs by how much trade they cover, U.S. tariffs were 2.2 per cent overall and just 2.0 per cent on non-ag products. That compares with 3.4 and 2.3 per cent for us. We talk a good game about what great free-traders we are but our average tariffs were higher than the Americans\u2019. (Our sanctimony may be one reason they think we\u2019re nasty.)\nPre-Trump, Americans were hardly simon-pure. Last year their average tariff on dairy products was 15.4 per cent, their highest 200. But we had that beat. By kilometres. Our average dairy tariff in 2024 was 209.4 per cent, our highest 663. That is correct: 663 per cent. I can\u2019t actually find the 663 per cent tariff in our own customs tariff schedule. You\u2019ve got to wonder what Canadian dairy product could be so important to Canadian sensibilities that we need to tax its importation at more than 600 per cent. Brie moulded in the shape of a beaver maybe?\nStrangely, these extreme dairy tariffs are a WTO success story. They represent the \u201ctariffication\u201d of what had been outright bans on imports. In successive rounds of negotiations, countries agreed to replace such bans with their (very high) tariff equivalents and then over time negotiate the tariffs down, which they have been doing, albeit slowly. For decades, agriculture had been untouchable. Then in the 1990s the WTO started working on it.\nBarbara Tuchman wrote that the Edwardian Age \u201cwas an edifice of grandeur and passion.\u201d The postwar trading system was itself an impressive diplomatic structure, built, like a medieval cathedral, painstakingly over decades. As for passion, trade data sometimes evoke it in the emotionally shrivelled folk drawn to economics. But the statesmen who put the system together in 1944\u2019s Bretton Woods Conference and after were clearly driven, very passionately, by iron determination not to repeat the beggar-thy-neighbour policies of the Great Depression that had led to a second global war.\nBut that time seems to be over. Now, to figure out what\u2019s happening to tariffs, an annual publication like the WTO\u2019s profiles won\u2019t do. The non-partisan Yale Budget Lab is having to produce almost daily reports on \u201cThe State of U.S. Tariffs.\u201d As of Aug. 1, the date of its latest report, the average effective U.S. tariff was 18.27 per cent. That\u2019s versus 2.4 per cent on Inauguration Day.\nThe demolition of this edifice is the work of one man. Granted, his coming to office is the result of powerful social forces, including backlash against the harm done to the poorer members of richer countries by the trade liberalization the WTO oversaw (even if technology is more responsible for their distress).\nPerhaps he will go down in history as these people\u2019s great liberator from global elites. My own bet, and wish, is that in time he will be linked forever in an infamous triad: Smoot, Hawley, Trump.\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

      "text": "Does Canada still deserve to be considered a \u2018trading nation\u2019?\nCharles St-Arnaud: Dismal export performance of the past 25 years suggests we have work to do\nCanadians often refer to their country as a \u201ctrading nation.\u201d That\u2019s because the economic foundations of Canada were built on trade, first as French and British colonies and later as a sovereign nation that has pursued free trade agreements around the world. As a result, a large share of our historical prosperity has been derived from trade.\nHowever, looking at the dismal performance of exports during the past 25 years, you have to wonder whether Canada still deserves to be considered a trading nation. After quadrupling since the 1960s, exports per capita have been flat since 2000, a stunning break in the trend.\nSimply put, after being responsible for about half of Canada\u2019s improvement in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita between 1960 and 1999, exports did not contribute much to the country\u2019s prosperity during the past quarter century.\nThis situation contributes to what I have called the \u201cLost Decades\u201d \u2014 a period when mediocre underperformance in the non-energy sector was masked by the oil and gas investment boom that ended in 2014.\nDespite the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and now the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), the growth in the total amount of goods Canada exports to the United States has persistently underperformed the growth in the total amount of goods Canada imports from the United States since the late 1990s, after having increased in tandem since the early 1960s.\nSimilarly, when Canada and the European Union signed the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) in 2017, the share of Canadian exports to the EU was about eight per cent of total exports. Since the pandemic, it has been half this level.\nIn addition, this poor performance hides a divergence between energy exports, which have increased about 40 per cent in volume since the early 2000s, and non-energy exports, which have increased a more modest 15 per cent. Similarly, services exports have more than doubled over the period.\nThe mediocre export performance over the past two and a half decades is concerning, and especially worrying at a time when Canada is facing a trade war with its main trading partner and desperately in need of diversifying its customer base.\n- Trump 'elephant in the room' of Canada's election\n- FP Video on Trump's fiscal footprint\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nA lack of competitiveness is the main culprit for the poor performance in exports. Canada used to stand in eighth place in the International Institute for Management Development\u2019s World Competitiveness Ranking; it has since dropped to 19th.\nCanada\u2019s persistently weak productivity growth is certainly not helping on the competitiveness front. Chronic underspending on productive investment over multiple decades is the principal cause of its weak productivity performance.\nCanada currently spends almost as much on home renovations and home ownership transfer costs as a share of GDP as it does on investment in machinery, equipment and intellectual property. More importantly, there is evidence that household borrowing over the past 30 years has crowded out business investment.\nSome have advanced the idea that the divergence between the energy and non-energy sectors during and following a commodity boom suggests the Canadian economy may have suffered from \u201cDutch Disease,\u201d an economic phenomenon where a boom in natural resources leads to currency appreciation, which results in a country\u2019s non-resource exports being less competitive both domestically and internationally.\nHowever, some preliminary analysis and the fact that the start of the non-energy exports\u2019 underperformance predates the oil investment boom suggest that globalization may have played a much bigger role in Canada\u2019s mediocre export performance.\nMany of the sectors that underperformed are ones that were more likely to be relocated due to globalization (textiles, furniture, electronics, etc.). However, Canada was not a victim of globalization, but rather a casualty; the country simply failed to adapt to the new reality.\nThe situation raises important questions. Can the country reclaim its title of a \u201ctrading nation,\u201d where exports contribute to its prosperity? And, in the context of the trade war with the U.S., can the country sustainably increase its exchanges with non-U.S. countries?\nTo reclaim its status as a trading nation, the country will need a clear plan to solve its lack of competitiveness. This includes encouraging spending on productive investment, whether it be machinery, equipment, infrastructure, intellectual property or research and development.\nIt also involves improving efficiencies in the private and public sectors by streamlining regulations and the tax system. Canada should draw inspiration from the successes in other small open economies with similar economic values, such as Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden and Australia.\nCanada needs to draw on its comparative advantage. In the commodity space, the country is blessed with a large endowment of energy, both conventional and renewable, critical and industrial minerals, and agricultural products.\nCanada also has one of the most educated workforces, with one of the highest percentages of adults with tertiary education in the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Canada must find a way to unleash this talent and become a service export powerhouse.\nOne thing is for certain: in light of the country\u2019s performance over the past two decades, it cannot rely on being a low-cost supplier in a globalized world.\nDiversifying Canada\u2019s exports will require sustained effort. The gravitational pull from the U.S. \u2014 with its similarities to Canada and its 350 million consumers representing 25 per cent of the world economy \u2014 will be impossible to fully escape.\nExpanding beyond North America will involve more than just trade deals. It will require building relationships with other nations using Canada\u2019s trade commissions. It will also require enhanced access to trade financing to ensure exporters have the financial support needed.\nIn short, it will mean having a much less risk-averse approach to trade and embracing the discomfort of trading with lesser-known parts of the world.\nCharles St-Arnaud is the chief economist at Alberta Central.\nBookmark our website and support our journalism: Don\u2019t miss the business news you need to know \u2014 add financialpost.com to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here.\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.
