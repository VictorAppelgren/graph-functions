      "summary": "Mortgage rates on September 4 2025 were largely unchanged, with the 30‑year fixed rate at 6.45% (up 0.01 pp from the week before) and the 15‑year fixed at 5.40% (down 0.48 pp). The 30‑year jumbo rate held steady at 6.65%. Fed policy and inflation remain the main drivers, and experts see little chance of a significant rate decline in the near term.",
