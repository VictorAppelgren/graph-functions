  "title": "Best Summer Beauty Essentials to Stay Cool During the Heat",
  "description": "The face mists, claw clips and handy gadgets to bring with you on any summer adventure.",
  "content": "We tend to think of summer as the most carefree season, but the warmer months also bring beauty challenges, with heat, humidity and sun exposure taking their toll on skin and hair. To combat issues like frizz, dryness and irritation, a few on-the-go essentials can go a long way. Here are the best products to help you keep your cool.\n\u2022 None Megababe\u2019s Thigh Rescue Anti-Friction Stick prevents the painful chafing that often accompanies barelegged summer styles, with pomegranate extract and vitamin E to soothe and protect tender skin.\n\u2022 None A spritz of Caudal\u00ede\u2019s Beauty Elixir mist refreshes and rehydrates tired, overheated skin with mint essential oils and orange blossom water.\n\u2022 None The Copenhagen brand Maanesten\u2019s claw clips and hair pins \u2014 we love the shell- and bow-shaped options \u2014 keep heat-trapping long hair off your neck, and offer casual outfits an easy style boost.\n\u2022 None Herban Essentials\u2019 towelettes are a convenient and gentle way to wipe away sweat or grime and keep any odors at bay, thanks to their antimicrobial essential oil scents, including lavender, peppermint and eucalyptus. Future of Cool\u2019s menthol wipes naturally deodorize sweaty skin with witch hazel, while imparting a minty chill.\n\u2022 None When the air is still, make your own breeze with a portable fan. The French brand Duvelleroy makes intricately crafted hand-held styles with detachable cords for slipping around the wrist. The Japanese brand Ibasen makes their folded and rounded fans according to Edo-era tradition, printing dramatic illustrated scenes onto each. But if you want maximum cooling with the least effort, try JisuLife\u2019s wearable, battery-powered neck fan \u2014 the closest thing to your own personal air-conditioner.",
