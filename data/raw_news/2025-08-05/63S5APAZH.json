  "title": "Helldivers 2 devs stay true to their word, immediately roll out a patch full of fixes after the studio's \"Super Earth sanctioned vacation,\" but one major issue still remains",
  "description": "\"No status effects fix... it's jover\u2026\"",
  "content": "Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead is sticking to its word with promises to focus \"100% on bug fixing and optimization\" following the studio's return to the office, with a new patch full of bug and crash fixes going out earlier today.\n\nArrowhead staff recently went on a well-deserved two-week vacation. However, the game wasn't in the best state before that, with some bugs arriving during the last patch (that being the software kind, not the Helldivers 2 enemy faction). This led to the that \"we should have left things in a better state with the last update\" and that \"we know the game isn't in tip top shape right now.\"\n\nDespite seemingly only arriving back in the office yesterday, Arrowhead has released a brand today. Now that the devs are back from \"Super Earth sanctioned vacation,\" the new update tackles some of the bugs like one that would cause some emotes to snap \"the Helldiver torso when standing near a Hellpod drop\" and \"an issue where some players were unable to access items tied to their DLC or Warbonds.\" That's not to mention crashes that occurred during weapon customization, enemies despawning, and when you were killed by explosions.\n\nHowever, the biggest issue with the previous patch was how it seemed to have broken status effects , which isn't mentioned at all in these notes, nor is it listed in the batch of known issues. This, understandably has caused some of the responses on Reddit to be rather panicked. \"No status effects fix... it's jover\u2026\" says one comment, while another gives out the more dramatic \"I have zero intention on ever touching this game again\" (I'm sure we'll see them back online tomorrow).\n\nMeanwhile others are taking the more diplomatic and realistic approach, as another user says: \"They returned to work yesterday my dudes. I'd say this is a pretty solid start, and quickly taken care of too. Why are there so many comments about what has still to be sorted. This is clearly a hotfix to address some of the main issues.\"\n\nGiven that Arrowhead has been one of the more responsive teams when it comes to community feedback over the last year and change where Helldivers 2 has been incredibly popular, I think giving the team the benefit of the doubt is warranted here.\n\n\"We actually won\": Helldivers 2 players pull off a miracle at the 11th hour, killing 47 million enemies of Democracy in a week and earning 3 cities that sound like terrible places to live.",

      "text": "\"We actually won\": Helldivers 2 players pull off a miracle at the 11th hour, killing 47 million enemies of Democracy in a week and earning 3 cities that sound like terrible places to live\n\"Vigorous, spirited efforts by the Helldivers\" have paid off\nThe latest Helldivers 2 Major Order was a doozy. On July 22, High Command instructed the Helldivers to kill a set number of a wide range of enemies of Democracy, around 48 million total, hoping to simultaneously generate \"patriotic war footage\" and clear the air for the construction of three new \"Maximum Security Cities.\" Well, it took a little helping hand from developer Arrowhead, but players just barely pulled it off.\nYesterday, an \"adjustment\" for the Major Order, which sure seemed like a wink and a nudge from Arrowhead as the studio clearly hoped players could pull this off, slashed the number of kills necessary for one part of the command, bringing the total bounty down to 47 million kills. Players had no problem killing Impalers, Fleshmobs, or Shriekers, but tanky Leviathans and Factory Striders proved more difficult. So, the invisible hand of Arrowhead offered a boost.\nIn honor of the \"innovative Leviathan hunting techniques\" players displayed \u2013 that is, catapulting Hellbombs at the things \u2013 the Leviathan kill count was reduced, seemingly freeing players up to blitz the Factory Striders just in time.\nIn typical Helldivers fashion, some players celebrated before the battle was actually won, reveling in the Major Order prediction calculating a 100.2% completion rate on the remaining Factory Strider kills. Fortunately, these folks were not punished for their hubris; we cleared the Major Order by the skin of our teeth, turning the community into a triumphant chorus.\n\"FREEDOM PREVAILS! WE'VE DONE IT, DIVERS! REJOICE IN LIBERTY!\" one Helldiver declares, posting from a machine with a broken caps lock key.\n\"We actually won the M.O.!\" another Reddit user writes.\nSo, what did we get for our efforts? High Command says \"vigorous, spirited efforts by the Helldivers to generate patriotic war footage for our citizens has had the desired effect,\" leading \"citizen nightmare incidences\" to a \"6-month low.\"\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nBetter still, \"construction has begun in earnest on three Maximum Security Cities.\" Just, uh, try not to think about the realities of living in one of these cities, which are so pro-Democracy that they'll monitor every facet of your life to make sure you're democratic enough. Security measures include:\n- Facial recognition cameras \"pre-installed in every block and building\"\n- Soldier and drone patrols\n- Dedicated \"surveillance satellites\"\n- Background checks, with applicants \"rigorously scanned\" to ensure \"every resident is as patriotic and vigilant against dissidence as possible\"\nAnyone else love Democracy? I sure do. Can't get enough of the stuff. In fact, I have to wake up early to have more time in the day to love Democracy.\nAustin has been a game journalist for 12 years, having freelanced for the likes of PC Gamer, Eurogamer, IGN, Sports Illustrated, and more while finishing his journalism degree.

Helldivers 2 has just unleashed a fresh Illuminate invasion and dropped huge weapon customization options in the Galactic Emergency update, and a new Heart of Democracy update is also on the horizon, if a Czech PlayStation Threads account leak is to be believed.\nIn a since-deleted post, PlayStation's Czech Threads account apparently revealed that the new update would be coming May 20 and will be called Heart of Democracy. The name and the recent Illuminate push toward Super Earth imply that we'll soon be fighting on our home planet, desperately trying to repel the invaders.\nOfficial Playstation account for the Czech Republic dropped info on the next title update. \"Heart of Democracy\" - May 20th#Helldivers2 pic.twitter.com/gelJbnYMqRMay 13, 2025\nIt would make sense given the Illuminate maps, too. They're all on colonized worlds in fabricated cities, so it hopefully wouldn't be too much extra work to place similar maps on Super Earth itself. Maybe that's the direction we'll be heading in if we fail to hold the planets surrounding the bastion of managed democracy itself.\nThe current major order to hold Widow's Harbor, Pilen V, and New Haven in the Altus Sector, just next to the Sol Sector, expires in six days, May 20, so the timing lines up perfectly with the leaked update.\nHelldivers 2 developer Arrowhead previously acknowledged that the team had stalled with updates in recent months and promised \"we are cooking,\" so it should come as no surprise that we're getting a lot of updates in such a small time frame.\nIn the meantime, there's lots to do for endgame players as new weapon customization and attachment options have been added. These are more than just cosmetics, as the attachments change the stats on many primary weapons. Now you'll finally have a use for all those requisition slips.\nIf you want to shoot more than just Terminids, Automatons, and Illuminate, check out or ranking of the best FPS games you can play right now.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nI'm Issy, a freelancer who you'll now occasionally see over here covering news on GamesRadar.

      "text": "Helldivers 2 CEO says \"we know the game isn't in tip top shape right now\" and Arrowhead devs are back from vacation to focus \"100% on bug fixing and optimization\"\n\"We should have left things in a better state with the last update\"\nHelldivers 2 developer Arrowhead is well aware of the myriad bugs and optimization issues players are dealing with, and after a two-week vacation reset, CEO Shams Jorjani has committed to focusing on that stuff.\nRight about two weeks ago, the official Arrowhead Twitter account shared, \"the team is entering Swedish Summer Protocol: 2 weeks of lakes, fika & tactical sunbathing,\" assuring determined freedom fighters, \"service continues, the Galactic War rages on, and Super Earth still needs you. We'll be back soon, recharged and ready to drop even harder.\"\nWell, true to its word, the folks at Arrowhead took the next couple of weeks off, and their break just happened to start a few days after a balance patch dropped. It seems that update came with some bugs of its own, as Jorjani acknowledged on the official Helldivers 2 Discord that the game needs bug squashing and optimization.\nTo be clear, these messages were sent shortly after Arrowhead jetted off on its vacation, but it's notable that Jorjani explicitly committed to addressing the game's performance post-vacation.\n\"Most people are back on the 4th (office closure ends),\" Jorjani said. \"And we'll be focusing 100% on bug fixing and optimization. Sorry for the inconvenience. We know the game isn't in tip top shape right now.\"\nJorjani also admitted \"we should have left things in a better state with the last update.\"\nSince it sounds like the majority of the Helldivers team just got back to the office today, they'll presumably be head down on bugs and optimization for a little while, but Jorjani also confirmed armor color customization is \"high on the list\" and that \"we want to take our time with such a feature\" and not rush anything \"until it's in a good place.\"\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\n\"So probably not coming soon, but coming,\" he said.\nAfter earning an English degree from ASU, I worked as a corporate copy editor while freelancing for places like SFX Magazine, Screen Rant, Game Revolution, and MMORPG on the side. I got my big break here in 2019 with a freelance news gig, and I was hired on as GamesRadar's west coast Staff Writer in 2021. That means I'm responsible for managing the site's western regional executive branch, AKA my home office, and writing about whatever horror game I'm too afraid to finish.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "The Helldivers 2 guide to managing democracy\nOur Helldivers 2 guides are all here, with gear, enemies, missions more\nOur Helldivers 2 guide hub contains all the info that a loyal soldier of Super Earth would ever need, with information on weapons, enemies, challenges, missions, tier lists and plenty, plenty more. It's worth keeping an eye on GamesRadar's guides content - Helldivers 2 is constantly in flux, with updates and balances changing what you can expect, but we're always keeping on track of things, with the most essential guides laid out below.\nBasic Helldivers 2 guides\nTo start with, let's cover the real fundamental technicals, and the sorts of things that even prospective players might want to check before buying the game.\n- Can I play Helldivers 2?\n- Developers Arrowhead famously live by the mantra that \"A game for everyone is a game for no one\" - but does that include you? If you have specific needs from your games, we'll explain if there's Helldivers 2 crossplay and cross-platform compatibility, as well as answering the important question for lovers of Single Player: can you play Helldivers 2 Solo?\n- Before the fighting starts\u2026\n- There are a few things you might want to be clear on before you start shooting down Terminids. Our Helldivers 2 tips should help you out as you go into your first few operations, but you may also be wonderinder where the Helldivers 2 rename ship function is, if you're not thrilled with the first title you christened it with. And if you want to be selective with your dialogue, where's the Helldivers 2 push to talk button?\nServer Problems, Error Codes and Glitches\nHelldivers 2 has not had the most stable reputation so far. Oh sure, the game itself is superb, at least when it's working. Unfortunately, what with server overload and a few other problems, there are moments where it isn't - and that's where our Helldivers 2 errors and server status page will help you out. One server error that has thankfully now been fixed involved Helldivers 2 not giving rewards after missions, and while it's no longer an issue, it might be good to know how to handle it in case similar issues occur in the future.\nWeapons, Armor, Stratagems and Loadouts\nKnowing what weapons, armor and equipment to bring into Helldivers 2 is essential, as your choice of guns and Stratagems will definitely mean the difference between success and annihilation.\n- Weapons and Guns\n- To start with, we'll explain how to unlock weapons in Helldivers 2, as it's not the most obvious process and all the great guns will require some work to obtain first. But once you do, our Helldivers 2 best weapons page comes with a full tier list for every firearm in the game and more besides, even breaking down the best weapons for fighting specific kinds of enemies! As you up the difficulty of your missions Helldivers 2 armor-piercing weapons become even more important too, so it's good to know exactly how punching through armor works.\n- Armor, Stratagems and Equipment\n- Beyond that, there's plenty more to choose. Make sure you're dressed up in the Helldivers 2 best armor, for one thing, as well as equipping all the Helldivers 2 best stratagems, allowing you to call in superweapons or rain death about those damn automatons! Finally, you might've noticed all the Helldivers 2 Boosters, special perks you can equip - but how do they work, and are they worth the high investment price?\nEnemies and bosses\nThe enemies of Helldivers 2 are all lethal in different ways, with some trying to swarm the player in hordes, while others unleash deadly barrages of ranged attacks - or even just soaking up damage before they club you into the floor with barely a scratch on them. Let's cover your foes, and how you can take them down.\n- Bestiary and factions\n- Yes, we went to the effort of assembling a full Helldivers 2 enemies list, with every foe and how to beat them explained here. Not only that, but we've also got the Helldivers 2 factions explained here, including theories about a future third faction!\n- Bosses and specific enemies\n- There's plenty of enemies either tough enough to warrant their own guide on how to beat them, or who have been tied to challenges where hunting them down earns you rewards. Here you can find out how to kill\u2026\nProgression, XP, and Samples\nThe Helldivers 2 progression system is a bit confusing at first, largely because it's essentially made up of several smaller systems that link in some ways. Earning XP by completing missions and objectives during operations is how you'll level up, unlocking new Stratagems and titles as you climb. However it's a slow process, so you might want to know how to level up fast in Helldivers 2 to get the best Stratagems ASAP.\nAs you unlock more Stratagems, you'll want to start upgrading these with Ship Modules, which you pay for with varying amounts of Common, Rare, and Super Samples. Learning how to farm Samples in Helldivers 2 can really speed up the process of unlocking these Ship Modules, as they're by far the hardest things to unlock the in game.\nMissions and objectives\nFinally, once you're in the field - what do you do? How do you complete your objectives successfully? There's no shortage of challenges and missions to complete in the name of Super Earth, and we've explained all the ones that have given players the biggest problems.\nIf you're trying to do some industrial sabotage, knowing how to destroy Fuel Silos in Helldivers 2 is crucial. If you've got to carry information across enemy lines, then you need to know how to Transport the Hard Drive in Helldivers 2. Finally, learning how to rescue science teams in Helldivers 2 and evacuate civilians will help you tackle one of the most infamously hard mission types in the whole game!\nIf you're also caught in the midst of a multi-week battle to save planets from encroaching enemies, you need to know what to how to beat these time-sensitive Helldivers 2 Defend Campaigns.\n\u00a9 GamesRadar+.

      "text": "Helldivers 2 adds \"500+ hours\" of progression with its big \"s**t your pants\" update, and Arrowhead's CEO wants to know: \"What is the pant situation like?\"\n\"That one off hand joke really really got out of hand,\" admits Shams Jorjani\nHelldivers 2 developer Arrowhead has been teasing something big for a while now, with the recent hint of \"exciting news to come\" compounded with the humorous promise made by CEO Shams Jorjani that something in the third-person shooter's pipeline would make everyone \"shit [their] pants.\" Today, it's become apparent what the studio was hinting at with the latest update, and the studio's boss has been checking in on the \"pant situation.\"\nJorjani's promise (arguably, threat) that \"you'll shit your pants\" thanks to Helldivers 2 has reached peak meme status in the democracy-loving fanbase over the last couple of weeks, with Reddit going \"overboard\" by the CEO's own description. Following the flood of jokes, he acknowledged that Arrowhead had \"better deliver,\" and it definitely looks like it's pulled it off.\nAs well as three new Illuminate enemies to deal with, Helldivers 2's latest update adds weapon customization for most primary weapons, has removed the rotation of items in the Superstore (everything is simply available all the time now), and has implemented plenty of balance changes, too.\nFor example, in a new patch notes deep dive video, design director Niklas Malmborg explains that fire damage now \"kind of scales with the surface area of the enemy,\" making big foes like Chargers take more damage than smaller ones when they've been set on fire.\nWeapon customization is also a massive deal, and in its own dedicated video, Malmborg says Arrowhead will \"continue expanding on it,\" as it has \"more stuff in store.\" It sounds like \"maybe in the future,\" sidearms and melee weapons might get some love here. Even as things stand, though, some primary weapons have around 20 customizations for you to unlock, which the design director estimates adds \"500+ hours\" of extra progression to the game.\nConsidering just how much Arrowhead has added with the update, I couldn't help but picture a rather satisfied smile on Jorjani's face when he took to the official Discord server earlier, asking: \"What is the pant situation like?\"\nLoyal Helldivers have delivered, too. Over on Reddit, the game's subreddit is full of comments ranging from \"sweet liberty, my pants!\" to \"my pants are shitted. Congratulations.\"\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nWhile others have apologised to the CEO, admitting that \"we were not familiar with his game\" when the pant soiling jokes took off, some say they've had faith all along. \"Never doubted the shattening,\" one proclaims.\nAs one fan in Discord requests that \"everyone please tell Mr. Jorjani that you shit your pants,\" the CEO responds in a way that feels almost too wholesome considering the context. \"That one off hand joke really really got out of hand. I love you all.\"\nBe sure to check out our roundup of all the biggest changes in the Galactic Emergency Helldivers 2 update patch notes.\nI'm GamesRadar+'s Deputy News Editor, working alongside the rest of the news team to deliver cool gaming stories that we love.
