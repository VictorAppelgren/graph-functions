      "feedback": "Your draft anchors well on Netflix’s near‑term fundamentals and the AI/compute backdrop, but it underdelivers on a disciplined, 3–6 month scenario map, lacks explicit trigger/invalidation logic, and blends long‑horizon value calls with near‑term dynamics in a way that dilutes actionable insight. For world‑class quality, rebuild as a tight, three‑to‑four‑scenario framework tied to concrete timing windows and observable signals, then stack macro/flows/valuation to a clear base case, 1–2 alternatives, and explicit watch‑list cues. Specifically: (1) replace the broad narrative with a 0–2/2–4/4–6 month catalyst timeline, assigning each window a probability band and an explicit go/no‑go trigger (e.g., NFLX Q2/Q3 results lines, ad‑tier uptake pace, password‑sharing controls and international ARPU, AI capex momentum; 0–6 months calendar anchors like earnings cadence); (2) build a crisp causal chain from the AI/infra cycle (data‑center demand to compute ecosystem capex) through to Netflix’s monetization levers and margin path, citing STBVARD8F (945 TWh implied data‑center demand), 61SVFUKBY (Q2 growth and P/E context), and A88B7V8PY for valuation framing; (3) quantify base case with sourced numbers (NFLX: 15.9% rev growth, 86.9% FCF gain in Q2; P/E ~51.7; 13.1% 2024–2027 revenue CAGR as a reference; 300M+ households as a market context) and specify plausible ranges; keep the 2030 view only as context, not as the horizon for the 3–6 month scenario; (4) craft 1–2 alt paths (e.g., faster international ARPU/margin reacceleration vs. sharper multiple compression with slower international growth) with explicit price/return implications; (5) embed invalidation signals (e.g., if NFLX subscriber growth stalls internationally by X% or the AI capex cycle decelerates, if S&P returns re‑rating converges valuations to broad market multiples); (6) integrate and reconcile critical non‑NFLX pieces (KO/Costa Coffee; Disney park dynamics from U3ZK13ZQI; Alphabet/dividend angle from A88B7V8PY and YX2J8NHZ1) as portfolio context rather than tangential digressions, and reference each claim to the appropriate source IDs (61SVFUKBY, A88B7V8PY, STBVARD8F, U3ZK13ZQI, YX2J8NHZ1) to avoid any sourcing gaps or conflicts; (7) end with a clean base case, 1–2 alt scenarios, a risk/constraint section, a watch‑list signal sheet, and a concise confidence rating, ensuring no extraneous YouTube/board detail unless it directly informs the Netflix thesis; (8) ensure a tight, citation‑dense narrative with claims tethered to data points (e.g., 8.8% Nielsen share for Netflix; Costa Coffee sale price around £2B; Disney’s Lightning Lane shift) rather than vague platitudes. This will sharpen the transmission from macro and policy to Netflix‑specific cash flow and multiple‑reversion risk, and align the piece squarely with the horizon/style constraints.",
