      "feedback": "Your draft captures the headline drivers but falls short of a world‑class synthesis because it treats each factor in isolation, offers only surface‑level causal links, and lacks the quantitative depth, scenario framing, and precise watch signals that a top‑tier analysis demands. To upgrade it, first rewrite the macro narrative as a clear causal chain: CPI + PPI ↑ → Fed rate hikes → higher discount rates → compression of P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples, with sector‑specific knock‑on effects (e.g., consumer staples vs. growth tech). Quantify each link (e.g., current Fed rate 5.25‑5.50 %, projected 5.75‑6.00 % by year‑end; CPI 2.7 % vs. 3.0 % threshold; oil supply 2.5 m bpd vs. demand 1.8 m bpd). Add a structured scenario table (Base: Fed slows, CPI 2.8 %, oil price $70/bbl; Upside: Fed pauses, CPI 2.5 %, oil $80/bbl; Downside: Fed hikes, CPI 3.2 %, oil $60/bbl) and tie each to expected S&P 500 moves (±4‑6 %). Replace vague “risk premia” language with concrete metrics (e.g., implied yield curve steepening, VIX spikes). Include a concise watch‑list: CPI July release (date), Fed minutes & policy statement (next meeting), EIA oil inventory report (weekly), S&P 500 crossing 200‑day MA (threshold ±2 %). Ensure every claim is backed by a source ID (e.g., LZG5YWQMC for CPI, V7GV8YBQU for Fed expectations, J99EM2TPZ for oil supply). Clarify ambiguous figures (e.g., “73,000 jobs” → “73 k jobs added in July, 1.5 % YoY” with citation). Add a brief technical snapshot: 200‑day MA level, 50‑day trend, relative strength index. Finally, tighten prose: break long sentences, use bullet points for risks and catalysts, and keep the paragraph under 200 words while preserving all critical details.",
