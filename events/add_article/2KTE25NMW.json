The Huthis, who have fired missiles and drones at Israel in support of the Gaza war, claimed the raid hit a central building and an oil facility. Israel said the strikes targeted military sites and were a response to repeated Huthi aggression, while the Huthis vowed to keep fighting until the Gaza blockade ends.",
