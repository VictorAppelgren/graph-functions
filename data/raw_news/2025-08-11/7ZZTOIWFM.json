  "title": "No Ejections Or Arguments Mar Debut Of First Female Umpire",
  "description": "Jen Pawol has broken into the majors as the first female umpire.",
  "content": "Atlanta was the perfect place to introduce the first female umpire.\n\nBobby Cox, who managed the Braves for 29 years in two separate stints, was ejected by umpires 158 times during the regular season and three more times in the post-season.\n\nJen Pawol didn\u2019t eject anyone in her Aug. 9 debut, when she umpired at first base in the opener of a day/night doubleheader between the Braves and visiting Miami Marlins and moved to third for the nightcap.\n\nNor did she provoke or participate in any arguments over her ball-and-strike calls when she worked home plate in the Sunday afternoon series finale.\n\nNow \u2013 except for her ponytail \u2013 she\u2019s one of the guys, though maybe not quite one of the \u201cmen in blue.\u201d\n\nPawol, 48, has been a minor-league umpire for 10 years, starting in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League in 2016.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty amazing when we took the field, and it seemed like quite a few people started clapping and saying my name, so that was pretty intense and very emotional,\u201d she told The Atlanta Journal Constitution between games Saturday.\n\n\u201cWhen we walked the field [is when it hit me],\u201d Pawol said. \u201cWe walked early as a crew, and Gooch [crew chief Chris Guccione] and I were looking at each other, and I said, \u2018This is it! This is what we worked for!\u2019\n\n\u201cI think it hit me then and we had a really special moment at the end where I went through the final pitcher check for the top of the ninth. We kind of hugged and it really hit me.\u201d\n\nUmpires are supposed to be anonymous figures, people needed to preside over a game but not get attention from fans in the ballpark.\n\nThey are routinely criticized, booed, and yelled at \u2013 especially when their calls go against the home team \u2013 but never applauded.\n\nWhen Pawol\u2019s name was read over the public address system at Truist Park, she not only received applause but a standing ovation. Like Jackie Robinson in 1947, she had not only cracked a glass ceiling but shattered it.\n\nCalled up from the minors earlier in the week, Pawol described herself as \u201ca fully charged battery ready to go.\u201d\n\nShe admitted she was overcome with emotion \u2013 a feeling neutral umpires rarely enjoy.\n\n\u201cIt was super emotional to finally be living that phone call that I\u2019d been hoping for and working towards for quite a while,\u201d Pawol told The Associated Press, \u201cand I just felt super full.\u201d\n\nThe New Jersey native said reaching the major leagues was like a dream come true.\n\n\u201cIt was just incredible,\u201d she said. \"I\u2019m so grateful to my family and to Major League Baseball for creating such an amazing work environment.\n\n\u201cTo all the umpires I work with \u2026 it\u2019s been just an amazing camaraderie. We\u2019re working hard but we\u2019re having fun. I am so thankful.\u201d\n\nSaturday wasn\u2019t the first time the Major League trailblazer saw her name etched in baseball\u2019s record books.\n\nPawol became the first woman to umpire a Triple-A championship in 2023 and the first in 34 years to work a Triple-A game earlier that season. A year later, she also became the first woman since 2007 to umpire a spring training exhibition game.\n\nLater that year, she reached MLB\u2019s Umpire Call-Up list -- after working more than 1,200 games in the minors.\n\nA one-time softball player who got her start as a softball umpire, Pawol had pointed herself toward the big leagues in what seemed like a Quixotic quest. Established umpire Ted Barrett saw her and invited her to umpire camp but warned it could take 10 years to reach the majors \u2013 if she ever did.\n\nOther women \u2013 notably Pam Postema and Bernice Gera \u2013 tried and failed.\n\nBut Pawol, a three-time All-Conference selection as a catcher for Hofstra, had perseverance.\n\nNow she\u2019s the female version of Jackie Robinson: if she succeeds, she will create a new avenue for other women who want to be involved in baseball.\n\nThere\u2019s one woman in the Baseball Hall of Fame already \u2013 former Newark Bears owner Effa Manley \u2013 and several who work as broadcasters, publicists, executives, and even uniformed coaches. But Pawol is the first and only umpire.\n\nShe\u2019s in a League Of Her Own.\n\n\u201cIts been absolutely unbelievable,\u201d said Pawol, whose supporters include fellow umpires as well as players, coaches, managers and even a female arbiter from another sport (NFL referee Sarah Thomas). \u201cIt\u2019s been blowing up my phone.\n\nPawol\u2019s seven seasons umping NCAA softball (2010-16) were her ticket to MLB Umpire Camp in Vero Beach, the one-time spring training home of the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nOne of her biggest boosters has been Guccione, who revealed that his daughter wanted to meet the first female ump.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the proudest moments I've had in my career,\u201d he said. \u201cI've been blessed with working playoffs, two World Series, and All-Star Games, but this is right up there. It gives me chills even thinking about it.\n\n\u201cThis is just a great role model for girls and women. She's an incredible person who works hard but also likes to have fun.\u201d\n\nBetween games of the Saturday twinbill, Pawol and Guccione met reporters and posed for photographers. She also sent the cap she wore in her first game to the Hall of Fame.\n\nThe trek to the majors is arduous, she admitted.\n\n\u201cI'm aware of the gravity, I'm aware of the magnitude,\u201d Pawol said earlier. \u201cI believe that I'm going to be a very good steward and representative for young girls and women, and boys and men, that this is possible.\u201d\n\nHer advice to other young women is simple: give it a try.\n\n\u201cIt's a long road, not an overnight road, and not one promotion,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are countless things that you have to do do. And I think a lot of people give up along that road.\u201d\n\nCompared to players, umpires don\u2019t make a lot of money \u2013 especially in the minors. But if they\u2019re among the handful who reach the big leagues, starting pay is usually about $150,000. That increases to more than $450,000 as arbiters accrue service time.\n\nAl Clark, who umpired in the majors for 26 years, revealed in his autobiographical Called Out But Safe that he chose the profession rather than follow in the footsteps of his sportswriter dad.\n\n\u201cI wanted to eat steak and not hamburger,\u201d he said.",
