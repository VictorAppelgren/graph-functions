      "feedback": "The analysis draft presents a solid overview of the current macroeconomic landscape, but it could benefit from enhanced clarity and depth in several areas. First, strengthen the causal chain by explicitly linking how tariffs influence inflation and employment dynamics, perhaps by providing specific examples or data points to illustrate these effects. Additionally, ensure that the discussion aligns with the multi-year horizon focus by incorporating longer-term implications of current trends, such as how sustained inflation might affect the Fed's policy trajectory over the next few years. The analysis should also quantify the potential impacts of tariff-induced inflation on consumer prices and corporate margins, avoiding vague statements. Lastly, increase citation density by referencing specific data points or studies to support claims, and ensure that all critical sources are reconciled, particularly regarding conflicting views on the impact of tariffs. Overall, aim for a more structured approach that clearly delineates the causal relationships and potential future scenarios, while maintaining a concise format.",
