  "title": "California Farms Feed America. They Can\u2019t Do It Without Immigrants.",
  "description": "We need a bipartisan solution that ensures a stable farm work force and protects farmworker families and the future of American agriculture.",
  "content": "California is by far the largest food producer in the United States. In 2023, our state\u2019s agricultural economy was worth nearly $60 billion. The state\u2019s roughly 63,000 farms grow over a third of all vegetables and around three-quarters of the fruits and nuts produced nationwide.\n\nThe lettuce and tomato on your hamburger very likely came from California. The almonds and pistachios you snack on as well. There\u2019s a good chance the olive oil on your pasta is from California. Did you pair that with a glass of wine? Probably California, too.\n\nThis bounty all depends on a reliable, skilled and experienced labor force that is overwhelmingly made up of immigrants: Over 80 percent of California\u2019s hired farmworkers surveyed between 2015 and 2019 were from Mexico, and more than half were undocumented. Nationwide, an estimated 80 percent of farmworkers were born outside of the United States, and around half are undocumented.\n\nThese immigrants are nothing less than the backbone of America\u2019s food supply, doing jobs that few native-born Americans seek. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids targeting them now will have real consequences for all Americans, very likely including higher grocery prices and fewer options in the produce aisle.",
