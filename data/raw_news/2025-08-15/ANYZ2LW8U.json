  "content": "Millions of users of Meta Platforms\u2018 (NASDAQ:META) Facebook in the U.S. are set to receive their long-awaited compensation for a data privacy breach that occurred over a decade.\n\nThe distribution of the settlement payments, which will be handled by Angeion, the company overseeing the settlement, will commence in August 2025 and continue for 10 weeks, reported The Hill.\n\nCheck out the current price of META stock here.\n\nThe settlement came after Meta, Facebook's parent company, agreed to pay $725 million to resolve allegations that it allowed users' personal data to be shared with third parties, including the controversial consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.\n\nTrending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market \u2014 and you can too at just $2.90/share.\n\n\n\nAnyone in the U.S. who had a Facebook account between 2007 and 2022 qualified for a share of the settlement. Angeion, the settlement administrator, reviewed around 28 million claims to confirm their legitimacy, ultimately approving at least 17 million of them.\n\nIf you submitted a claim by the August 2023 deadline and it was approved, your payment will be sent via the method you chose when filing\u2014either as a direct bank deposit, a mailed prepaid gift card, or a PayPal transfer.\n\nAlthough the number of claimants was substantial, the individual payouts are expected to be relatively modest. The exact amount will depend on the duration of the user\u2019s active Facebook account, with lawyers estimating a median payment of around $30.\n\nSee Also: In a $34 Trillion Debt Era, The Right AI Could Be Your Financial Advantage \u2014 Get Your Demo\n\nThis lawsuit and the subsequent settlement are part of a larger narrative surrounding Meta\u2019s handling of user data. Cambridge Analytica illegally harvested Facebook user data to influence political ads, notably in the 2016 U.S. election and Brexit vote. The scandal sparked intense scrutiny of Facebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, prompting significant regulatory reforms and raising global concerns over tech companies' handling of personal data and privacy protections.\n\nIn July 2025, a trial began in Delaware where Meta shareholders sought $8 billion in damages from top executives, including Mark Zuckerberg and Peter Thiel, over alleged failures to protect user data following the scandal.\n\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook, also announced a ban on political, electoral, and social issue advertising in the European Union in response to new regulations aimed at enhancing transparency in online advertising following the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal.",

      "text": "Benzinga Money is a reader-supported publication. We may earn a commission from the advertisers associated with this article. Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nAmerica has a debt problem, and recent policy is making it worse. President Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Beautiful Bill\u201d is expected to add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, and economists project that the debt-to-GDP ratio will go from 100% to 120% in the same timespan.\nAs a result, corporations and consumers will be stuck with high interest rates until something changes.\nThat change might just come from artificial intelligence, one company argues.\nRange is an AI-powered wealth management platform for high earners that centralizes investments, taxes, estate plans, and more in one account. The platform uses advanced AI technology to deliver personalized financial guidance at fees 75-90% lower than traditional advisors, making expert wealth management more accessible. Today, Range serves nearly 2,000 clients managing over $6 billion in assets.\nTaresh Batra, Range\u2019s vice president of Investments, says these AI-driven productivity gains could be the key to accelerating GDP growth while bringing inflation and interest rates down. \u201cHigher growth and lower interest rates as a result of AI could be a panacea for the markets,\u201d Batra says.\nProductivity is Key\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office uses the following formula to measure and forecast the country\u2019s GDP, or Gross Domestic Product:\nReal GDP Growth = Labor Growth(x labor contribution) + Capital Growth(x capital contribution) + Productivity\n\u201cOf these variables, changes in productivity have the largest impact on GDP growth,\u201d Batra says. \u201cTechnological innovation has been the driver of productivity over the course of history.\u201d\nAI, Batra argues, has the potential to improve productivity and benefit the economy in the coming years, similarly to how the dot-com boom did in the mid-1990s.\nHere\u2019s how:\n- Direct Economic Growth: With AI, companies and workers can be more productive without requiring additional resources.\n- More Jobs, Not Less: While AI may automate certain tasks, history shows that technology creates more jobs than it replaces. In fact, 60% of today\u2019s jobs didn\u2019t exist in 1940. The World Economic Forum projects AI will generate a net gain of 78 million new jobs this decade alone. Range itself exemplifies this trend by employing CFPs, CPAs, and CFAs who collaborate closely with AI engineers to build smarter financial tools.\n- Increased Tax Revenues: \u201cHigher productivity usually leads to higher corporate profits, wages, and economic activity\u2014all of which generate increased tax receipts,\u201d Batra says. \u201cMore government revenue means less need to borrow.\u201d\n- Disinflationary Pressure: \u201cLess government borrowing leads to lower inflationary pressure,\u201d Batra says. \u201cIn addition, productivity improvements reduce the cost of producing goods and services, which slows down inflation.\u201d\n- Improved Debt Dynamics & Lower Rates: Lower inflation means the Federal Reserve can lower interest rates, which helps stimulate the economy and allows the government to spend less on interest expense and spend more money on the private sector.\nWhat\u2019s more, we\u2019re already seeing measurable productivity gains in industries that have integrated AI tools into their workflow. Even if policymakers fail to rein in spending in the coming years, AI-driven productivity gains in the private sector may allow us to \u201cgrow our way\u201d out of fiscal distress.\n\u201cIf AI delivers even modest incremental productivity gains of 1-1.5% annually, the US could potentially maintain or reduce current debt-to-GDP levels despite continued spending growth,\u201d Batra says.\nAI Is Transforming, Not Destroying the Job Market\nYes, the rise of AI has resulted in people losing their jobs. This, however, is not a new phenomenon.\nTake farming, for example. Around 70% of people were employed in agriculture in the early 1800s, but that number is now less than 2% thanks to the creation of farming machines and other advancements.\nAt the same time, technological innovations not only created new jobs to replace the ones lost. They added new roles that previously never existed.\n\u201cRemarkably, 60% of the jobs people are employed in today didn't exist in 1940,\u201d Batra says. \u201cThat means nearly 90% of employment growth over the last 80 years resulted from technology creating entirely new categories of work.\u201d\nThe World Economic Forum\u2019s Future of Jobs Report estimates that AI and related technologies will create a net gain of 78 million new roles this decade.\nRange is living proof of this. They\u2019ve hired CFPs, CPAs, and CFAs as critical subject matter experts to help their AI engineers build and validate their platform.\n\u201cThese aren't traditional roles\u2014they represent the emergence of new types of knowledge workers who combine domain expertise with technological fluency,\u201d Batra says.\nHow You Could Bring the Power of AI Into Your Wealth Management With Range\nIn just four short years, Range has signed up almost 2,000 high income members and advises them on more than $6 billion in assets.\nCurrently in beta, Range\u2019s proprietary AI engine is capable of delivering financial insights and guidance in seconds, potentially allowing you to capitalize on opportunities and avoid any potential pitfalls \u2014 for example, if you should buy an investment property or if you can retire early based on your complete financial picture\nRange also operates on a flat-fee pricing model and offers portfolio management with 0% Assets Under Management fees, so you won\u2019t pay more as your net worth continues to grow.\nDisclaimers\nPlease be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.

      "text": "Benzinga Money is a reader-supported publication. We may earn a commission from the advertisers associated with this article. Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nThree of the same VC firms that backed Uber, Venmo, and eBay, respectively, are all investing in another private company: Pacaso.\nVenture backing in companies like Pacaso is nothing new. After all, early-stage companies often have the potential to deliver the most outsized returns.\nBut, recent regulatory updates have opened the door for individual investors to invest alongside these venture capitalists. Normally, everyday investors have to wait for a company to go public before they can invest, missing out on that early gain potential. Now, some companies are opening up investment opportunities to the public.\nThis type of investing has already seen some great success stories. For example, in 2016, 433 people invested an average of $2,730 in a private startup named Revolut. Fast-forward to today, those $2,730 stakes are worth over $1 million, up 89,900%.\nToday, thousands of investors have joined big-name VCs in taking a chance on Pacaso. It's no surprise, considering Pacaso's resum\u00e9:\n- The company has made $110M in gross profits to date\n- Pacaso's co-founder sold his last company to Zillow for $120M\n- They operate in over 40 vacation destinations across the US, Mexico, UK, and France\n- The company reserved the Nasdaq ticker PCSO\nBut the growth potential is where the excitement is. Below we'll reveal more about how Pacaso has ramped up and built a competitive moat so quickly, and how you can share in their growth.\nNext-Generation Co-Ownership\nAfter his $120M exit and subsequent role as a Zillow executive, Austin Allison created Pacaso\u2019s game-changing co-ownership model. Powered by proprietary tech and an innovative structure that eliminates the headaches of traditional vacation home ownership, it\u2019s already leaving a mark. Here\u2019s how:\n- Seamless Transactions: Clients easily buy, finance, and resell, shares of luxury homes through Pacaso\u2019s intuitive platform\n- Turnkey Ownership: Pacaso handles maintenance, scheduling, and furnishing; owners simply enjoy their vacation homes\n- Maximized Value: Homes that once sat empty up to 90% of the year now stay occupied nearly year-round, benefiting owners and local economies\nThe demand for their services and expertise is real. In top destinations, co-ownership is growing 21% annually in the US, and Pacaso homes have appreciated nearly 10% since 2021 \u2013 roughly double the growth of the broader luxury market.\nScaling Into 10 New International Destinations\nPacaso is already leading the charge in the $1.3 trillion US vacation home market, combining real estate innovation with tech-driven efficiency to generate multiple revenue streams. These include transaction service fees on every sale, recurring property management fees, and exclusive financing options tailored to co-owners.\nNow, the platform\u2019s global reach is growing quickly, and they\u2019re already seeing strong returns in the $500B global market. In 2024, they set records in Paris and London. Meanwhile, Cabo (Mexico) is the #3-most-searched destination on their platform. No surprise Europe and Mexico have accounted for 22% of their revenue over the past two years.\nNow, they\u2019re taking international expansion to an entirely new level. They recently announced 10 new international destinations will be added to their platform, spread across Italy, the Caribbean, and Mexico. That means Pacaso\u2019s unique model is poised to dominate a combined $1.8T in vacation home markets.\nWhy Investors Are Paying Attention\nThere are many reasons why firms managing a combined $180B+ in assets, and 10,000+ individual investors have already backed Pacaso, including:\n- Proven Leadership: Allison is joined by executives with decades of real-estate and startup experience.\n- Strong Growth Metrics: Full-year 2024 financials showed a 21% YoY increase in gross real estate volume and a 24% improvement in adjusted EBITDA.\n- Surging Demand: 40% of Americans want to buy a vacation home in the next year (Coldwell Banker)\nAfter impressive full-year earnings showed gross profit grew 41%, and with continued growth and expansion ahead, Pacaso is really hitting their stride.\nPacaso is offering securities through the use of an Offering Statement that has been qualified by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Tier II of Regulation A. A copy of the Final Offering Circular that forms a part of the Offering Statement may be obtained from: invest.pacaso.com. Reserving the ticker symbol is not a guarantee that the company will go public.

      "text": "Meta Platforms Inc. META has announced a ban on political, electoral, and social issue advertising in the European Union (EU) due to the \u201cunworkable requirements\u201d of the new rules.\nWhat Happened: Meta, the parent company of social media giants Facebook and Instagram, as well as messaging app WhatsApp, is set to implement the ban from October, reported AFP. The new EU regulations, known as the Transparency and Targeting of Political Advertising (TTPA), are aimed at enhancing transparency in online advertising following the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal.\nCheck out the current price of META stock here.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been vocal about his discontent with the EU\u2019s regulations, previously accusing the EU of \u201ccensorship\u201d and equating fines to tariffs. The company is currently facing a 200-million-euro ($235-million) fine for violating personal data rules on Facebook and Instagram, with the possibility of additional daily penalties if changes are not made.\nMeta is not alone in this move. Google GOOGL GOOG last year also revealed plans to block political advertising in the EU from October 2025 due to similar challenges and legal uncertainties.\nSEE ALSO: Donald Trump Announces 15% Tariff Trade Agreement With EU, Ending Months Of Trade Uncertainty\nWhy It Matters: This decision by Meta comes amid a series of regulatory challenges faced by the company in the EU. Earlier in July, Meta, along with other tech giants, fought back against a tax case in Italy that could alter how digital services are taxed across the EU.\nAdditionally, WhatsApp, owned by Meta, was warned of a potential exit from the Russian market due to national security concerns. These instances highlight the increasing regulatory scrutiny faced by Meta in the region.\nFurthermore, the EU\u2019s stringent regulations have not only affected Meta but also other tech companies. For instance, Apple Inc. AAPL was expected to dodge daily EU fines by accepting changes to its App Store rules and fees. This growing regulatory pressure on tech companies in the EU could potentially reshape the digital landscape in the region.\nBenzinga\u2019s Edge Rankings place Amazon in the 90th percentile for quality and the 93rd percentile for growth, reflecting strong performance in both areas.
