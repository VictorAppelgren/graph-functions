  "title": "Victoria Mboko Has Won A Masters Title And Why Stop There?",
  "description": "Victoria Mboko beat major champions left, right and center at the Canadian Open. The U.S. Open is the next challenge for an 18-year-old who has the maturity of an elder.",
  "content": "Victoria Mboko is only 18 years old, but presents more insouciance than innocence on the court. Her Canadian Open title win showcased the teenager\u2019s ability to keep calm and carry on when elders and betters are losing their heads.\n\nFacing defeat at 4-5 and 5-6 in the third set against Elena Rybakina in the semifinal, Mboko refused to accept that misused phrase, \u201cthe inevitable.\u201d Naomi Osaka obliterated her in the first set of the final, but then realised she was in a fight she couldn\u2019t win. While Mboko beamed in the Montreal moonlight, Osaka might have been forgiven for reminiscing about how tennis was much more fun as a 19-year-old.\n\n\u2018Emma Raducanu rules\u2019 mean that any fanfare has to be put strictly on hold. After all, the Burlington resident hasn\u2019t gone straight to the major table to grab a big one yet. She\u2019s beaten four major title winners though, including Coco Gauff, which is not something Raducanu had to achieve to win that incredible U.S. Open title.\n\nWinning a WTA 1000 first, earning a $752,275 pay check and then upgrading to head of the class at Flushing Meadows would probably be a fairytale too far. What is certain is that Mboko has weapons and a mind that sees and computes in real time.\n\nAfter Lois Boisson\u2019s march to the French Open semifinals, wildcards in the women\u2019s game are certainly rocking the place. Mboko\u2019s success feels like something that has come entirely from left field, but Paris was one of the first signs that something was brewing just as Raducanu\u2019s Wimbledon 2021 run made some sit up and take notice.\n\n\u201cShe hits the ball hard, and then she has a great serve. She has, you know, huge power. She moves on the court well,\u201d Zheng Qinwen said after defeating the Canadian in the third round at Roland Garros. Those are qualities that will tick a lot of the major boxes. Free points on serve and the ability to run balls down are going to be a difference maker in a game where athleticism can create opportunities others don\u2019t get.\n\nCoach Nathalie Tauziat\u2019s imprints are on helping the wider tactical acumen too, mixing up the \u200bslice and the approach with a package of volley highlights. Such a skillset means Mboko will never be as green as the grass. There is nothing one-dimensional about the world No. 24. She started the year ranked at 350, which proves that there\u2019s no time like the present.\n\nOne of the most striking features of Mboko\u2019s success is her ability to play as if she were in the park. Her calmness and composure under pressure are a skill that is absolute gold dust in the highly pressurised chamber of elite sport. It was six-time world snooker champion Steve Davis who once said that the trick was to \u201cplay as if it means nothing when it means everything.\u201d She\u2019s got that ability to switch to leisure and freedom mode when others might get tight.\n\n\u201cPretend like you\u2019re playing somewhere else, that you\u2019re not at a Grand Slam. It\u2019s another clay-court tournament. That way, I don\u2019t put as much pressure on myself and the points,\u201d Mboko said after beating Lulu Sun in the first round at the French Open. In Montreal, she carried out this action plan to perfection.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to say professional players have nothing to lose when they are on the brink of defeat. That\u2019s another lazy phrase that demeans the dynamic of sport. Picking the harder option to be the last woman standing takes huge effort and belief.\n\nMboko\u2019s hard labor of love has been spent on accumulating wins on the ITF Tour, clocking up five titles. Eventually, she got a wild card for the Miami Open and pushed Paula Badosa in a third-set tiebreaker. A 53-9 win record in 2025 is the barometer for a winning habit that has become second nature under the big lights.\n\nOnly time will tell if she can follow through when the interest level and external volume press more tightly up against the window of her small and trusted team. Comparisons with Raducanu come again here as she likes a trusted team around her.\n\nOsaka was front and centre back when she was a teen, taking it to her idol Serena Williams at the U.S. Open in 2018. In her acceptance speech, Mboko namechecked the Japanese as someone she looked up to during her childhood.\n\nOsaka is in a different sphere right now, a player who has suffered on and off the court despite never losing a major final. Mboko would give everything for her record, but without the troubles. \u201cI want to go there (New York) with a positive mindset. I want to have as much fun as possible.\u201d Sounds like a good plan. It\u2019s only a game.",

      "text": "How Victoria Mboko stunned the tennis world to win her 1st career title\nCanadian teen will be among 32 seeded players this month at her U.S. Open debut\nWatching how Victoria Mboko sliced through the National Bank Open competition and took down four Grand Slam winners to her first WTA title, it's hard to imagine the 18-year-old Canadian was once nervous before tennis matches and easily flustered on the court.\nFollowing a stunning and memorable victory over former world No. 1 Naomi Osaka in Montreal, Mboko discussed on Monday how she wanted 2025 to be different on the court after finishing last year ranked 350th.\n\"I wanted to have a different mindset going into this year. I wanted to be very confident with myself, confident with my team and comfortable. I wanted to have a good support system,\" Mboko told Anastasia Bucsis at CBC Sports headquarters in Toronto, just 57 kilometres east of her native Burlington, Ont.\n\"I think sometimes in tennis, the mental aspect is almost more important than what you're able to produce on court and your talent and ability to do something. If you have a clear mindset of what you want to do, nothing's going to stop you.\"\nMaking strides at controlling her emotions, Mboko noted, has been a key element of her improvement.\n\"On court, a lot of thoughts are racing through my head but when you're positive with yourself and stay comfortable and confident, you don't think about it too much. When you don't think and [just] play, it's going good,\" added the American-born daughter of Congolese parents, who is now ranked 24th and higher than any other Canadian singles player.\nAs she raised the National Bank Open trophy before an appreciative crowd of 11,000 at IGA Stadium last Thursday evening, Mboko understood it was a special moment in tennis history. She became the third Canadian to win the hometown tournament in the Open Era, joining Bianca Andreescu (2019) and Faye Urban (1969), and the first to do so in Montreal.\nBut it wasn't until the morning after when she realized the magnitude of her accomplishment. Suddenly, she was more recognizable on the street and life was about to become hectic.\nHowever, she was able to relax during a five-plus hour drive home to Burlington with her parents. She wore headphones, scrolled her phone, watched TikTok, listened to music and slept.\n\"I'd be scrolling and see a video of me playing. I was like, 'Oh, my God, scroll, scroll,\" Mboko said, laughing. \"I'm not a fan of seeing myself [competing].\"\nBut many Canadians were captivated for a few days by Mboko's athletic talent.\n- She downed top-seeded Coco Gauff (the 2025 French Open and 2023 U.S. Open champion) and No. 23 Sofia Kenin (the 2020 Australian Open champ), both in straight sets.\n- In the semifinal, Mboko suffered a wrist injury and lost the first set 6-1 before battling back to take the next two 7-5, 7-6 (4) against ninth-seeded Elena Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion.\n- The Canadian teen rallied from another rough opening set in Thursday's final for a 2-6, 6-4, 6-1 win over Osaka, who hasn't won a tournament since the 2021 Australian Open.\nMboko, meanwhile, is the youngest woman to knock off four Grand Slam winners in the same tournament since a 17-year-old Serena Williams did so at the 1999 U.S. Open to capture the first of her Open-era record 23 major titles. She boasts a 53-9 win-loss record in all competitions this year.\n\"It proves that anything is possible,\" said Mboko, who hopes to represent Canada at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. \"It seems intimidating when you're playing the top 10 [women] in the world and such amazing athletes and players [but] they're human.\n\"I just had that mindset going into [the] matches, playing the best I possibly can with as much focus as [possible] \u2026 and it worked.\"\nWATCH | Mboko reflects on improbable run to NBO victory:\nA promising junior player hampered by a knee injury the previous two years, Mboko went undefeated through her first 22 matches of this season. After winning five of six tournaments on the lower-level ITF Tour and reaching the final of a WTA 125 event in Italy, Mboko had an impressive Grand Slam debut, advancing to the third round of the French Open as a qualifier.\nShe moved inside the top 100 for the first time and rose another 15 spots with a second-round appearance at Wimbledon.\nUp next for Mboko is the U.S. Open in New York later this month, where she will realize her childhood dream. The Canadian will be among 32 seeded players \u2014 giving her a more favourable path at the season's final Grand Slam \u2014 after securing an automatic entry with her NBO title. Mboko opted to sit out this week's Cincinnati Open to rest her sore wrist.\nWATCH | Mboko defeats Osaka to win National Bank Open:\n\"I hope to go there with a positive mindset. I want to have as much fun as possible,\" she said.\nMboko's success in Montreal has inspired other young Canadian tennis players. Denise Fernandez, coach of Saskatchewan's team at the Canada Games this week in St. John's, said Mboko's title win sets a positive example.\nThe fact that [Mboko's] only 18, our juniors can relate because she's not that much older than they are,\" Fernandez said of Mboko, who won the 2022 and 2023 Saskatoon Challenger tournaments.\nThe tennis community in Thunder Bay, Ont., is growing in part to the on-court achievements of Canadian professional players like Mboko.\n\"The kids see it on TV, adults see it on TV,\" said Jamie Grieve, director at the Thunder Bay Community Tennis Centre. \"That's why our memberships are on [an] all-time high [of about 500] this year.\"\nAdded Valerie Tetreault, National Bank Open tournament director: \"Everybody is inspired by [Mboko] who keeps surprising us by her composure, her maturity, her level of play as well, and the self-belief that she has. She's showing us that anything is possible.\""

      "text": "'Allez Vicky' - Mboko emerges as tennis' new star\n- Published\nWildcard Victoria Mboko won her first WTA title by coming from behind to beat four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka in the Canadian Open final.\nFor the second successive match, the 18-year-old Canadian had to show resilience after conceding the opening set but rallied to win 2-6 6-4 6-1.\nMboko began the year ranked 333rd in the world but has risen to 24th after a win that delighted her home crowd.\n\"I was super happy to be playing in Montreal for the first time ever. I just remember feeling nervous, but really taking in the moment as much as I possibly could,\" Mboko said.\n\"When I won my first round, I was super happy and super content. I would have never thought that I would have made it to the final, let alone win the tournament.\n\"I have so many emotions going through my head, I can't even express it.\"\nMboko beat four Grand Slam champions en route to collecting the title in front of 11,000 spectators.\nThe final of the men's Canadian Open, which was being played between Ben Shelton and Karen Khachanov at the same time in Toronto, had to be halted when the crowd broke out in celebration after learning Mboko had won her match.\nAmerican Shelton, who won 6-7 (5-7) 6-4 7-6 (7-3), looked confused at the reaction and asked \"what's going on?\" before walking over to speak with the chair umpire.\n\"Congrats on the title Vicky Mboko. I had no idea what was going on at the time but Toronto went nuts for you,\" Shelton wrote on Instagram.\nMboko overcomes sloppy start\nMboko has made a habit of starting slowly on home soil over the past two weeks - coming from a set down to win on three occasions.\nShe struggled to find her rhythm early with 22 unforced errors allowing Osaka to wrap up the opening set in 38 minutes.\nThe second set was chaotic with seven breaks of serve but Mboko took control with a break to lead 5-2.\nServing for the set, she came up with three double faults to hand the break back but did go on force a decider after holding in her next service game.\nMboko broke to love in the opening game of the third set but was unable to consolidate as Osaka hit straight back.\nBut the local favourite went on to win the final five games, drawing chants of \"Allez Vicky\" as she sealed victory.\nMboko has appeared at two Grand Slams this year - reaching the third round of the French Open and the second round at Wimbledon.\nThe US Open, which begins on 24 August, is up next but Mboko was keen to temper expectations.\n\"I'll be playing it for the first time, so there's a lot of new beginnings for me,\" Mboko said.\n\"Although I'm experiencing everything for the first time this year, I think along the way it's obviously going to be an up-and-down journey, but I just want to enjoy the process as much as possible.\n\"Not everything will go my way or not everything is going to be positive but I'm just really happy to be in this situation... I think it builds character.\"\n'US Open is the objective'\nAfter beginning the season with a 22-match unbeaten run on the second-tier ITF Tour, Mboko has shown over the past two weeks that she can mix it with the elite - beating Grand Slam winners Coco Gauff, Sofia Kenin, Elena Rybakina and Osaka.\nIt's validation of hard work from the age of three, and for parents who landed in a very different United States in 1999 - one which provided solace from political unrest in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nBut it's in Toronto where Mboko - who was born in Charlotte in the US - was inspired to play tennis.\n\"I remember going there as a kid and watching all the great players playing,\" Mboko told the Women's Tennis Association.\n\"We were watching a lot of Serena and Venus [Williams], and that's where I took a lot of inspiration, because Serena was literally the greatest of all time. I used to see how the pros are and I used to be in so much awe of them. And now I'm seeing them like right beside me.\"\nMboko's coach Nathalie Tauziat - a former world number three and Wimbledon finalist in 1998 - has overseen Mboko's remarkable form after previously guiding her in the junior ranks.\n\"I think what is important for her is to see us not panic when something happens. I remember at the beginning of the year, she always told me: 'Oh, you're so calm during the match,\" Tauziat said.\n\"The US Open is the objective - who knows, maybe she can do something good? Here, we are going match by match, and hoping for no injury.\"\nOsaka's rebuild continues\nOsaka was appearing in her second WTA final of the year and just her third since lifting the Australian Open title for the second time in 2021.\nThe 27-year-old parted company with coach Patrick Mouratoglou in July but looked energised in Montreal.\nAfter beating four seeds to reach the final, Osaka's experience appeared to be giving her the edge when claiming the opening set.\nBut the Japanese star, who is aiming to get her career back on track after an inconsistent period following her return from a maternity break, couldn't last the distance.\n\"I'm happy to have played the final. Victoria played really well. I completely forgot to congratulate her on the court, but she did really amazing,\" Osaka said.\n\"It's funny, this morning I was very grateful and I don't know why my emotions flipped so quickly.\"\nRelated topics\n- Published31 January"

      "text": "After Naomi Osaka completed her first win of a much-trailed comeback at the Brisbane International, the BBC\u2019s opening words of their online report read \u201cNew mother.\u201d Parenthood came before mention of the player and that may be especially appropriate in the case of the post-match comments that a new life status has brought. After her first outing in 15 months on the circuit, the Japanese tweeted: \u201cDear moms, everybody and every body is different. Don\u2019t compare yourself to anyone, you\u2019re beautiful and you\u2019re loved.\u201d\nIt\u2019s been a long journey back to the tennis court for the four-time Grand Slam champion. Osaka\u2019s first child was born in July last year and appears to have had a profound effect on how she looks through the prism of life. \"I'm the type of person that can't really think about myself. I make rash decisions and she's helped me mature so much already. I'm a lot more comfortable with who I am and I'm just very thankful for every day,\u201d she told BBC Sport.\nThere\u2019s nothing new in tennis players becoming mothers and returning to the court full of vigor and vim to remake their mark. Like Caroline Wozniacki most recently, Osaka wants to show her daughter that anything is possible in life, that things are not bound in old motherhood tales of living only once as a free agent before birth. \u201cI never wanted to have to choose between tennis and a family. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair,\u201d Serena Williams famously said. Things are gradually shifting.\nIt is unquestionable that whatever the pain and strain of her ongoing depression, something that was fomented after that groundbreaking US Open win over her hero Serena Williams in 2018, Osaka has come back with new tools to cope. There\u2019s been the trauma of a complicated birth with the best end result possible, a healthy daughter. The former world No.1 believes that her physical pain barrier is now at a higher threshold through natural forces. This added steel was not quite enough to see her get past Karolina Pliskova in a tight three-set battle on Wednesday, but the vital signs of her tennis skills look good too.\nOsaka lost the momentum of her tennis career when she withdrew from the French Open in 2021 (and eventually Wimbledon) the day after being fined $15,000 and given a warning over absences from post-match press conferences. The pressure cooker then started to boil over as she mentioned her battles with anxiety, depression and the expectations of the media in a social media post. This wasn\u2019t so much a press that built a star up to knock her down, but rather an athlete who wanted to shut the door on the protocol of probing traditional press duties. She claimed the media had little care for her mental health or others.\nHer transparency at the most vulnerable moment of her sporting career certainly gained a lot of traction. Osaka's temerity in fighting traditional ways of acquiescing to the expected duties of a player opened up a whole new debate about the symbiotic relationship between the media and athletes.\nOsaka has spent the time away from the court taking back control of the narrative by creating her own sports agency Evolve with Stuart Duguid. \u201cI've spent my career doing things my way, even when people told me that it wasn't what was expected or traditional,\" she told Sportico in an email. Nick Kyrgios, another very busy content creator off the court, was the company's first client.\nA month later, it was announced that the 26-year-old had set up a media production company alongside LeBron James called Hana Kuma. Its strapline was 'disrupting the default', which is exactly what Osaka continues to do. She was the first Japanese to win a major and the first Asian No. 1 so this venture about 'empowering' and 'culturally specific' stories was another platform for her to voice and direct her story.\nThere is a famous Japanese saying that reads \u201cparental feelings are stronger than what the child feels for parents.\u201d Naomi Osaka version 2.0 has the foundation of a strong bond that can add extra energy to her game. She has even changed her way of looking at defeat through the eyes of her child. \"I do feel different. I mean, of course I feel sad, but the sadness is me being like, 'Aww, I wish I could have done better, because I know I\u2019m spending so much time away from her (Shai), so I want it to be worth it somehow.\u201d It's so far so good for the latest circle of life."

      "text": "It was only this summer when Emma Raducanu admitted that, at times, she wishes she had never won the US Open. It was a stark admission, a refreshing piece of honesty that sounded more like a scar than a success. The British star came from left field to claim the crown at Flushing Meadows at the age of 18, winning ten straight matches without dropping a set. It was an incredible passage of sustained play that left opponents baffled.\nThe payoff hasn't been half as much fun.\nThat wonderful anonymity, hitting power and confidence has never been seen again since that most unlikely triumph. If the perfect storm a couple of years ago felt like a modern-day fairytale, the follow-up has been nothing but an extended descent into the cruelty of modern competitive sport. She is now ranked 133, having recently had surgeries on both her wrists and ankle to miss out on the French Open and Wimbledon. New York will also come too soon as the 2021 winner continues her rehabilitation.\nBillie-Jean King is a big fan of the British star and has made her feelings clear on the way to resist the drip of negativity from certain quarters over the last 24 months.\"If you want to be a professional athlete, it's tough. And you've got to learn not to listen to criticism, you got to learn all these things and that's why I say don't take anything personally because once you learn that, you're okay,\u201d said King.\nThe first stinging criticism originated from a sporting coach in another sphere, even if it was unwittingly. \u201cWhat have you seen her on \u2013 the front page of Vogue and Harper\u2019s Bazaar or whatever it is, wearing Christian Dior clothes. All that is a distraction around her,\u201d England's rugby coach Eddie Jones (now sacked) said at the time. Jones was jumped on by many sections of the media for the comments, but it opened up a rather risible line of questioning that hasn\u2019t stopped. In his defence, the Australian claimed he had written to Raducanu to clarify the wider point about young people handling distractions.\nA year ago, her agent was insisting that she had left \u201cmillions on the table\u201d in sponsorship deals. As Raducanu's body and mind rejected the pressures that came with the job, the off-court commercial juggernaut was blamed for everything. Niggling injuries became commonplace and coaching relationships had all the permanency of gig economy workers. That is the latest stick to beat Britain\u2019s first female singles champion since Virginia Wade. Andy Murray got off lightly.\nRaducanu has worked with five different coaches after the biggest of breakthroughs. Another easy attack mode to make is the accusation of parental micro-management within a sport that has been famous for some unhealthy father-daughter relationships. The truth is not as dramatic or as clear. It is easy to hustle a woman just out of her teens for doing nothing of note after winning a major. The clickbait will continue until something significant happens on the playing surface.\nThe 20-year-old hasn\u2019t hit a competitive ball since April. In the last five competitive tournaments she has played, she has only managed to win back-to-back matches on one occasion. Tour life has become almost as painful as her physical issues. The will she or won\u2019t she narrative has changed from whether a second Slam could be on the cards to whether she is even a contender.\nIt is not what external voices say that matters. A visit to the practice courts last week is a welcome step in the right direction. However, a Google\nBrand Raducanu is a real, living person with a backlog to die for already. That is of no interest right now. The second album is proving to be difficult but time is most definitely on her side. As Ons Jabeur feels the pain of her performance anxiety, Raducanu knows that she already has secured the blue tick of a major. The trick now is to relaunch as if the previous incarnation is stocked away in a vault.\nShe doesn\u2019t need to be freed from her history; that is very much part of her journey. What counts now is how Raducanu can recapture the spirit, the devil-may-care attitude so that results take care of themselves. As her social media post hinted on her return from surgery, this is the fun part."
