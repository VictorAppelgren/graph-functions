  "content": "BROOKLYN Beckham and Nicola Peltz have shared more stunning snaps from their wedding row renewal - after \"cruelly\" snubbing his parents David and Victoria.\n\nNone of the Beckhams were invited to the lavish ceremony on August 2 \u2014 presided over by Nicola\u2019s billionaire dad Nelson \u2014 and only read about it on an US website.\n\nBudding chef and photographer Brooklyn\u2019s original wedding with Nicola took place on Nelson\u2019s estate in Palm Beach, Florida, with Brooklyn\u2019s sister Harper among the bridesmaids in April 2022.\n\nNow, opting for a repurposed dress which her mum Claudia wore when she married tycoon Nelson in 1985, the Bates Motel actress has given a further glimpse into her magical moment.\n\nShe also sported the same original \u00a31.3million ring for her special day.\n\nNew images show her switching up her look for their afterparty, donning a baby blue bodycon gown complete with scarf detail.\n\nShe swept her dark locks into a half-up style and kept her make-up fresh and glowing.\n\nThe Lola star was seenenjoying a romantic kiss with Brooklyn before they joined their pals for a series of happy group snaps.\n\nThe Beckhams' eldest child then whipped off his jacket as he posed for a series of pictures by a pool table.\n\nThe fresh snaps came after Nicola posed topless with her mum, 70, in more behind the scenes images of their special day - and the pair declared war against the \"toxic\" Beckhams.\n\nThe Sun exclusively revealed David and Victoria's fears that Brooklyn has \"quit\" the family for good following the new ceremony.\n\nAfter seeing photos of the happy couple, friends of the couple have asked: \u201cIs the moment Brooklyn declared himself no longer a member of the Beckham family?\u201d\n\nThe Beckham family feud has now rumbled on for four years \u2014 before Brooklyn, 26, and Nicola, 30, originally got married in 2022, The Sun can reveal.\n\nLast night a source said: \u201cThis was the final kick in the teeth for David and Victoria.\n\n\u201cSeeing Nelson having such a pivotal role at the ceremony was heartbreaking for David especially. Not one member of the 30-plus extended family knew about the wedding, or were invited.\n\n\u201cHis grandparents are devastated too as Brooklyn has always been so close to them.\n\n\u201cAt the original wedding, for example, Liberty - the daughter of Victoria\u2019s sister, Louise \u2014 was a bridesmaid but even she has been cut off now. The rift runs far deeper than people realise.\n\n\u201cIt feels cruel and spiteful. This is no longer a game. It has gone beyond all that.\n\n\u201cThis is a family who feel they have lost their precious boy - and see no way back.\n\nHonestly, they are now questioning why he even wants to keep the \u2018Beckham\u2019 surname - will he revert to Peltz?\n\n\"August 2nd 2025 - is this the day Brooklyn formally declared himself no longer a part of the Beckham family?\"\n\nRecently, The Sun exclusively revealed how Brooklyn and Nicola will not feature in fashion designer Victoria's upcoming documentary.\n\nThe Spice Girl singer's long-awaited Netflix programme is due for release in October.\n\nIt is understood she will not touch on the simmering feud - although she has promised there will be \u201ctears\u201d in the four-parter.",
