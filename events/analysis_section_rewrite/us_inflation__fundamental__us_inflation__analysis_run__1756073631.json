      "feedback": "Strong core intuition, but the write‑up needs a formal, multi‑year regime map, tighter first‑principles anchors, and precise, source‑driven quantification to reach world‑class quality. Actionable edits: 1) Add a regime map with explicit regimes and transition conditions (e.g., Regime A: policy‑supported transition with retraining and targeted income safeguards; Regime B: disorderly UBI with identity/psychological costs; Regime C: rapid but unprofitable EV transition for legacy autos). Tie each regime to a concise causal chain: AI displacement raises unemployment risk; policy design (retraining, income supports) modulates demand and labor‑supply equilibrium; prices/handshakes in markets (durables, income stocks) respond accordingly. 2) Ground the invariants with first‑principles anchors available in sources (e.g., NL5YYTLF2 cites 25% of US employment with high automation risk; use that as the structural shock input; Ford‑related pieces (22PL3Q360, W2622L6WW) supply regime‑dependent pricing in cyclical/EV transitions and income‑tilted appeal). Where possible, quote ranges and cite exactly (e.g., Ford up ~17% in 2025; dividend ~5% range; EV losses like $1.3B in Q2) and reconcile conflicting takes from Fool versus Yahoo/Nasdaq coverage (cite 22PL3Q360 and W2622L6WW for dividend/EV narrative; 2QRLB974F as corroborating/alternative market framing). 3) Structure the transmission to market pricing more explicitly: outline the channel from labor‑market identity psychology (NL5YYTLF2) to household balance sheets, to durable‑goods demand and to equities with income focus (O’Leary rules in 1GVYF2V8O). 4) Specify catalysts and invalidation points with precision: Finland’s UBI trial (limited employment effect) as a falsification risk for blunt UBI; policy shifts on retraining funding or guaranteed income; corporate EV profitability milestones (Ford’s EV losses; EV capex cadence) as triggers; 5) Quantify uncertainty and add sensitivity: present ranges (automation exposure 25% of jobs; Ford forward P/E around 8–11; ROIC/EV margins as discussed in the Fool materials) and show how these shift across regimes. 6) Expand critical source coverage and reconcile conflicts: explicitly acknowledge where sources diverge (Ford’s long‑term upside vs. income appeal; EV profitability trajectory) and present a reconciled base‑case vs. bear/optimistic paths. 7) Tighten the horizon language to multi‑year (3–5 and 7–10 year) with a base case, key risks, watch signals, and stated confidence. Implement these edits by converting the prose into a compact, cited map: anchor the multi‑year structure with NL5YYTLF2 for the identity cost channel, 1GVYF2V8O for investor behavior rules, 22PL3Q360/W2622L6WW for Ford/EV timing and income thesis, and support with corroborating Fool coverage (2QRLB974F, 22PL3Q360). This will elevate depth, firmness of causal links, and rigor in forecast overtu, while maintaining adherence to the SECTION FOCUS and source constraints.",
