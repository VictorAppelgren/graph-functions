Generate Key Takeaways\n\nTourists were fined for secretly building a holiday shack in part of a Great Barrier Reef national park.\n\nAccording to reporting by 7News, eighteen individuals were fined after they secretly built a cabin in Australia's Curtis Island National Park.\n\nThe Department of Environment, Science and Innovation received reports and surveillance of the illegal building and launched a compliance investigation.\n\nTheir investigation found a relatively high-tech construction, filled with bunk beds, solar panels, rainwater tanks, a veranda, a barbecue, and cooking facilities. Not only that, the individuals associated with the shack were taking part in other prohibited activities, like hunting with firearms and using unauthorized vehicles in the park.\n\nTo build this construction, the intruders had to cut down trees to make space, and their use of illegal four-wheel drives damaged fragile ecosystems.\n\nThe Curtis Island National Park is filled with rare birds, as well as turtle nesting grounds, endangered species, and delicate dunes. The disruptive actions of the shack builders put the natural beauty spot and all of its many inhabitants at risk.\n\nUnder the Nature Conservation Act 1992, all fires and structures are completely banned from Curtis Island National Park, according to 7News.\n\nThe Department of Environment, Science and Innovation (DESI) tracked down and fined the rogue builders and people who visited the shack. It fined 18 people a total of $7,606, which will hopefully act as a deterrent to others and help protect the area.\n\nThough the rules and regulations at National Parks may seem quite strict on the surface, they are in place so that we can all visit these spots of natural beauty without damaging them.\n\nIt's so easy for ecosystems to be harmed by invasive species of plants and insects that can accidentally be carried in on people's shoes or clothes, which is why it's important to check you're not bringing in any mud, seeds, or pests from elsewhere.\n\nWhen these areas are already at such high risk, the last thing they need is selfish acts of destruction from people who want to turn a National Park into their holiday home.\n\nDESI commented, per 7News, \"Curtis Island is a national park, not a private playground.\"\n\nThe organization added, \"Queensland's national parks are for everyone to enjoy, not for a select few to exploit for personal gain.\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

      "text": "About Curtis Island\nPark features\nCurtis Island is the third largest continental island in Queensland. Located in the southern region of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area the island contains a very high diversity of landforms and ecosystems. The island is a unique part of the central Queensland coast. Coastal heath and littoral rainforest scatter the sand dunes and beach ridges, while extensive salt flats make up the large plain on the northern section of the island.\nThe small settlement of Southend is the entry point for your stay on the southern end of this scenic island. Driving north from here you will reach Southend Conservation Park, Curtis Island Conservation Park and Curtis Island National Park. The parks offer tranquil ocean vistas and stretches of uninhabited beaches.\nThe endangered Capricorn yellow chat has been recorded in remnant wetlands on Curtis Island Conservation Park to the island\u2019s north. The threatened flatback turtle nests on the island's beaches.\nLooking after the park\n- Toilets are not provided\u2014use a portable toilet. A toilet waste dump point is available to dispose of toilet waste 18km to the south near the Oceanview junction\n- Generators and chainsaws are prohibited.\n- Read and obey signs. Some areas of the park are closed to public access. Please read all signs and do not enter restricted or protected areas.\n- Keep wildlife wild. Do not feed or interfere with native animals. All plants, animals and natural features are protected. Disturb nothing.\n- Take rubbish with you. Bins are not provided. Please help and collect rubbish left by others. A council rubbish transfer station is located north of Southend.\n- Avoid clearing plants and leaf litter when setting up camp. All vegetation\u2014including grasses, vines, fallen timber and leaves\u2014are part of the natural ecosystem. Remember, all plants are protected on national parks and collecting is not permitted.\n- Cook without campfires. Fires are prohibited in the park, please use a gas or liquid fuelled stove for cooking. Open fires are also prohibited on tidal land (beaches).\nBe pest-free!\nOur precious Great Barrier Reef World Heritage islands are among the most pest-free islands in the world. They need your help to stay this way. Please Be pest-free! , Be pest-free! video\u2014YouTube before your visit.\nBefore you visit, please check that your boat, clothing, footwear and gear are free of soil, seeds, parts of plants, eggs, ants and insects (and their eggs), spiders, lizards, toads, rats and mice.\nBe sure to:\n- Unpack your camping gear and equipment and check it carefully as pests love to hide in stored camping gear.\n- Clean soil from footwear and gear as invisible killers such as viruses, bacteria and fungi are carried in soil.\n- Check for seeds in pockets, cuffs and hook and loop fastening strips, such as Velcro.\nWhile you are on the islands, remove soil, weeds, seeds and pests from your boat, gear and clothes before moving to a new site. Wrap seeds and plant material, and place them in your rubbish.\nEveryone in Queensland has a General Biosecurity Obligation to minimise the biosecurity risk posed by their activities. This includes the risk of introducing and spreading weeds and pests to island national parks.\nSee the guidelines on caring for parks for more information about protecting our environment and heritage in parks.\nPark management\nQueensland Parks and Wildlife Service (QPWS) manage Curtis Island National Park, Conservation Park and State Forest for the enjoyment of visitors and the conservation of our natural and cultural heritage. Work is currently being undertaken to manage feral animals\u2014pigs, foxes and cats\u2014to conserve biodiversity on the island. Signs will be in place when pest control activities are being undertaken. Please comply with sign directions for your own safety.\nTourism information links\nGladstone Information Centre\nwww.gladstoneregion.info\nMarina Ferry Terminal\nBryan Jordan Drive\nGladstone QLD 4680\nPhone: (07) 4972 9000\nEmail: gladstonevic@gapdl.com.au\nCurtis Ferry Services\nwww.curtisferryservices.com.au\n215 Alf O'Rourke Drive\nGladstone QLD 4680\nPhone: (07) 4972 6990\nEmail: info@curtisferryservices.com.au\nFor tourism information for all regions in Queensland see Queensland Holidays.\nNature, culture and history\nCurtis Island contains a high diversity of regional coastal vegetation and landscape types that are in near \u2018natural condition\u2019 and are considered excellent examples of their type. This diversity, within well-defined boundaries, presents Curtis Island as a major natural asset where connectivity and resilience of ecosystems and habitats has been maintained.\nThe vegetation communities, many of which are \u2018endangered\u2019 or \u2018of concern\u2019, include wetlands, littoral rainforests, eucalypt forests and woodlands, lowland melaleuca swamps, open heathlands, low shrublands and dune communities. Although the island occurs in one of the drier zones of the Queensland coast, it contains a diversity of vegetation with both tropical and sub-tropical floristics.\nCurtis Island has biogeographical significance for species and communities that are at their distribution limits including 33 plant species including four mangrove species, the southernmost rookery site of the \u2018vulnerable\u2019 flatback turtle Natator depressus and the most southern occurrence of a tropical marine plain community. These features supported the listing of the eastern half of Curtis Island on the Register of the National Estate in 1993.\nThe 4,000ha marine plain is major habitat for the critically endangered Capricorn yellow chat Epthianura crocea subsp macgregori, migratory waders and other significant wetland species. Located in the north of the island, the marine plain is part of the \u2018Northeast Curtis Island\u2019 listing in the Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia. \u2018Northeast Curtis Island\u2019 is a highly significant wetland at regional, state and national levels.\nThere are also significant historical values such as the Cape Capricorn lighthouse precinct, Sea Hill pilot station, quarantine station and recent years marked the end of 150 years of cattle grazing."
