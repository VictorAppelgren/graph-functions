      "feedback": "The draft correctly links the Fed’s September 25‑bp cut and the 2.5 % July CPI to a 0.5–1 % DXY rally, but it lacks several key elements for a world‑class view: (1) every claim must carry a direct citation to a source ID; add a CPI citation (e.g., (B1KYJ1GPU)) and a 2‑yr/10‑yr spread citation (Z7O1DCHS7) to the sentence that states the 57 bp steepening; (2) quantify the risk of a Fed hike by stating the potential DXY reversal (≈‑50 bp) and the probability (≈ 14 %) derived from the 86 % cut probability; (3) explicitly map each driver to its canonical handle—e.g., fed_policy, us_core_cpi, us_pce, us_nfp, ust2y, ust10y, us_mortgage_rates—and include the handle in the text; (4) tighten the watch list to a bullet format: • Early‑August CPI (Aug 3) – confirm 2.5 % reading (B1KYJ1GPU); • September Fed meeting (Sep 25) – minutes for cut confirmation (XTQIQRP5K); • Aug 30 PCE (7XH2DKEKV) – > 3 % triggers 50–100 bp upside; • Aug 31 NFP (7XH2DKEKV) – payrolls > expected triggers 50–100 bp upside; • 2‑yr/10‑yr spread (Z7O1DCHS7) – flattening < 30 bp invalidates rally; (5) remove the paragraph that merely repeats “Fed policy decisions (LF0UUL917)(7XH2DKEKV) directly set the short‑term rate environment” as it drifts without a new causal link; (6) add a concise transmission line: “Fed cut → 2‑yr yield ↓ → 10‑yr yield ↑ (steepening) → real yield differential ↑ → DXY ↑ (LF0UUL917)(Z7O1DCHS7)”; (7) ensure the short‑term dip to 95.8 by Aug 31 is clearly tied to the 200 bp decline (Z7O1DCHS7) and that the 0.5–1 % medium‑term rally is anchored to the 86 % cut probability and 57 bp steepening (B1KYJ1GPU)(Z7O1DCHS7). Once these edits are applied, the view will satisfy the acceptance gate: it maps to the canonical handle **dxy** with explicit sign (+0.5‑1 %) and magnitude, and it contains a dated catalyst window (Sep 25 Fed meeting, Aug 3 CPI) with a clear causal chain.",
