  "title": "I support Trump taking control of DC police \u2014 the Constitution is on his side",
  "description": "President Donald Trump's D.C. police takeover could signal the end of home rule as administration asserts federal control over the nation's capital city and its law enforcement.",
  "content": "President Donald Trump announced Monday that his administration would take over the District of Columbia police and also deploy 800 national guard soldiers and new federal law enforcement units in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\"This is Liberation Day in D.C., and we\u2019re going to take our capital back,\" Trump said at a White House news conference flanked by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Attorney General Pam Bondi and other senior administration officials. \"It\u2019s going to be a model. And then we\u2019ll look at other cities also. But other cities are studying what we\u2019re doing,\" Trump said. \"We\u2019re going to have a safe, beautiful capital, and it\u2019s going to happen very quickly.\"\n\nDemocratic leaders responded with their usual eloquence. \"Violent crime in Washington, D.C. is at a thirty-year low. Donald Trump has no basis to take over the local police department. And zero credibility on the issue of law and order. Get lost,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., posted on X.\n\nRepeating the same talking point as many other elected Democrats, Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., questioned Trump\u2019s move by comparing it to his delay in calling out the National Guard to step the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nUS ATTORNEY PIRRO SAYS ADMINISTRATION WON\u2019T TOLERATE \u2018OUT OF CONTROL\u2019 CRIME IN THE NATION\u2019S CAPITAL\n\nDespite Democratic complaints, few should question the need for greater public safety in our nation\u2019s inner cities. But under our federal system, crime remains the purview of the states. \"The regulation and punishment of intrastate violence\u2026 has always been the province of the States,\" the Supreme Court observed in United States v. Morrison (2000). As the great Chief Justice John Marshall declared a century ago, Congress \"has no general right to punish murder committed within any of the States,\" and it is \"clear [that] congress cannot punish felonies generally.\"\n\nCriminal justice sits at the very core of the states\u2019 police power \u2013 their general right to regulate the people and activity within their borders \u2013 aside from the specific, narrow areas (such as regulating interstate commerce) delegated by the Constitution to the federal government.\n\nBut that is not the case with Washington, D.C. The Constitution specifically creates the District of Columbia as a city beyond the power of any state. As James Madison explained in Federalist No. 43, the \"seat of government\" must fall only under the power of the nation. Otherwise, he warned, \"the public authority might be insulted, and its proceedings interrupted with impunity,\" and the state where the capital resided \"might bring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence, equally dishonourable to the government and dissatisfactory to the other [states].\" The Framers wanted the national government located in a city that would not be under any partisan control.\n\nTRUMP ACTIVATES NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS TO ADDRESS \u2018TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL\u2019 CRIME IN WASHINGTON\n\nBut in 1973, Congress passed a Home Rule Act (with President Richard Nixon\u2019s support) that created a mayor, a city council, and some limited rights to self-government.\n\nUnder the Constitution, there is no true local government in D.C.; the entire city is but a subdivision of the national government. Trump\u2019s takeover of the D.C. police and his deployment of troops and federal law enforcement does not intrude on any rights of local government because, unlike the case with deployment of troops in Los Angeles earlier this year, there is no need to pay respect to a state\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nWASH POST EDITORIAL SEES POSSIBLE SHORT TERM SUCCESS IN TRUMP'S DECISION TO SEND NATIONAL GUARD TO DC\n\nThe president needs no state\u2019s permission to deploy U.S. troops and federal law enforcement to protect federal property, facilities, and personnel.\n\nEven if D.C. home rule did not run contrary to the Framer\u2019s design for the nation\u2019s only federal city, Trump would still have authority to take Monday\u2019s action. The president has an obligation to ensure public safety in D.C. Under Article II of the Constitution, the president has the duty to \"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\"\n\nAll laws in the District of Columbia are federal laws. If the mayor and city officials are allowing rising crime, especially because of lenient laws and policies toward offenders, the president should intervene. He has the constitutional responsibility to restore common-sense law enforcement methods that will protect those who work and live in Washington.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nThe 1973 Home Rule Act itself, even if it is constitutional, recognizes the president\u2019s authority. It allows him to take over the D.C. police for 30 days in the case of an emergency. The president could declare the high number of murders \u2013 the capital city has always had one of the nation\u2019s highest murder rates, and currently sits at the fourth highest \u2013 an emergency. While murders in 2024 fell, they were coming down from a pandemic high; murders in D.C. are still far higher than the 2012 low. In any event, the Home Rule Act provision only applies to the D.C. police; the Act does not \u2013 and could not \u2013 limit the president\u2019s authority to deploy troops or the FBI to protect the federal city.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s decision to restore law and order in the District of Columbia is only the first step. He can take the necessary second step by working with Congress to end home rule and restore the control of the elected branches of government over the District.\n\nJust as he has asserted his control over the bureaucracy by firing agency heads, he could test the constitutional waters by removing the mayor and other D.C. officials. They, too, are only assistants to the president who help him fulfill his responsibility to execute federal law; if they fail to perform, he can and should replace them.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA half-century ago, Congress and the president gave in to the misguided idea that residents of D.C. had a democratic right to manage their own affairs. But the Framers did not want D.C. to fall under anyone\u2019s partisan control, especially those who would use their control of the District to influence the federal government itself (recall the harassment of Trump officials that went unpunished during his first term).\n\nTrump and Congress should admit that home rule has failed and start making D.C. the great federal city it should be.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JOHN YOO",

      "text": "Nancy Pelosi is an American Democratic politician and former Speaker of the House of Representatives. Elected to Congress in 1987, she is one of the most senior Democratic Party leaders and represents California\u2019s 11th Congressional District. Under her second term as Speaker, the House impeached former President Donald Trump twice, but he was acquitted both times by the Senate.\nPelosi is the daughter of another political powerbroker, Thomas D'Alesandro Jr., who served in the House and was the mayor of Baltimore. Her husband, Paul Pelosi, is a venture capital investor who owns his consulting and real estate firm. The couple has a combined net worth estimated to be $120 million. In May 2022, her husband was arrested in Napa County for a DUI after crashing into another vehicle and released on bail at $5,000.\nAs Speaker under the Obama administration, Pelosi was pivotal in the passage of several key legislation such as the Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act. In 2010 she lost her Speakership after Republicans gained over 63 seats \u2014 one of the largest victories in the history of Congress.\nDuring the Trump administration, Pelosi had a contentious relationship with the 45th president that played out in public and private settings. For over a month between December 2018 and January 2019, the federal government shut down after Democratic leaders, including Pelosi, could not agree with \"Trump\" over an appropriations bill to fund the construction of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. It was the largest government shutdown in U.S. history. Moreover, moments after Trump's 2020 State of the Union speech to Congress, Pelosi ripped up her copy of his remarks."

      "text": "A month before he died in April 1994, former President Richard Nixon wrote a letter to then-President Bill Clinton offering what Clinton later called \"wise counsel, especially with regard to Russia.\" The contents of that letter have now been declassified by the Clinton presidential library and appear prophetic.\nIn the seven-page letter, dated March 21, 1994, and discussed by history professor Luke Nichter in the Wall Street Journal, Nixon gave a blunt assessment of the political situation in Russia, predicting accurately that relations between Moscow and Kyiv would deteriorate and that someone like Putin could come to power. Nixon, 81 at the time, wrote the letter after he returned from a two-week trip to Russia and Ukraine.\nWhile the former president is infamous for departing the White House amid scandal in 1974, his legacy includes being the architect of d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union during the Cold War. In 1972, Nixon became the first U.S. president to visit Moscow, where he signed the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty with Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev. Nixon spent the years following his presidency taking foreign trips on behalf of the United States and offering counsel based on decades of experience to guide U.S. policy in the post-Cold War era.\nNixon considered the survival of political and economic freedom in Russia \"the most important foreign policy issue the nation will face for the balance of this century.\" With that understanding, he told Clinton that based on what he saw in Russia, a fledgling democracy under former Russian President Boris Yeltsin was in danger.\nRUSSIA EVADES WORLD'S SANCTIONS WITH LESSONS LEARNED FROM IRAN: \u2018AN ALLIANCE OF CONVENIENCE\u2019\n\"As one of Yeltsin\u2019s first supporters in this country and as one who continues to admire him for his leadership in the past, I have reluctantly concluded that his situation has rapidly deteriorated since the elections in December, and that the days of his unquestioned leadership of Russia are numbered,\" Nixon wrote. \"His drinking bouts are longer and his periods of depression are more frequent. Most troublesome, he can no longer deliver on his commitments to you and other Western leaders in an increasingly anti-American environment in the Duma and in the country.\"\nNixon foresaw that relations between Russia and Ukraine would dissolve. He called the situation in Ukraine \"highly explosive.\"\n\"If it is allowed to get out of control,\" Nixon told Clinton, \"it will make Bosnia look like a PTA garden party.\"\nPUTIN BIDING TIME FOR REVENGE ON MERCENARY WARLORD, CIA CHIEF SAYS: \u2018ULTIMATE APOSTLE OF PAYBACK\u2019\nThe former president advised Clinton to strengthen American diplomatic representation in Kyiv, recounting conversations with American businessmen who complained that the embassy was \"understaffed and inadequately led.\"\nNixon also urged Clinton to develop relationships with Yeltsin's potential successors. \"Bush made a mistake in sticking too long to Gorbachev because of his close personal relationship. You must avoid making that same mistake in your very good personal relationship with Yeltsin,\" he wrote.\nHe was unsure who would rise to power next. \"There is still no one who is in Yeltsin\u2019s class as a potential leader in Russia,\" Nixon wrote. He informed Clinton that a nationalist and populist tide in Russia could produce a \"credible candidate for president\" \u2014 a mere five years before Putin's Russian nationalist regime took hold.\n\"The Russians are serious people. One of the reasons Khrushchev was put on the shelf back in 1964 is that the proud Russians became ashamed of his crude antics at the U.N. and in other international forums,\" Nixon wrote.\nThe letter also reveals some of Nixon's dislike for career diplomats. \"I learned during my years in the White House that the best decisions I made, such as the one to go to China in 1972, were made over the objections of or without the approval of most foreign service officers,\" he wrote. Nixon advised Clinton to chart his own course and not to be held back by his staff. \"Remember that foreign service officers get to the top by not getting into trouble. They are therefore more interested in covering their asses than in protecting yours.\"\nClinton in later years would remember Nixon's advice fondly. \"After he died, I found myself wishing I could pick up the phone and ask President Nixon what he thought about this issue or that problem, particularly if it involved Russia,\" he said in 2013."

      "text": "Key facts about President Donald Trump: What to know\nDonald Trump served as the 45th President of the United States and was re-elected in 2024 to become the 47th President. He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump. Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022.

      "text": "President Donald Trump announced Monday that he is activating approximately 800 National Guard troops and is taking over the Metropolitan Police Department to tackle crime in Washington, after beefing up federal law enforcement presence in the nation's capital Saturday.\n\"I'm deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in Washington, DC,\" Trump told reporters at a Monday press conference. \"And they're going to be allowed to do their job properly.\"\nTrump also said that he would federalize the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington to respond to crime, placing it under the authority of Attorney General Pam Bondi.\nNational Guard troops are reserve forces that are mobilized in response to state and federal operations, including natural disasters, and are typically overseen by their respective state governments. However, Trump controversially deployed National Guard troops from California to respond to immigration riots in June, bypassing California Gov. Gavin Newsom to dispatch the troops.\nThe federal government oversees the District of Columbia National Guard.\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said that Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll will operationalize the D.C. National Guard, and signaled that more National Guard troops could be roped into the deployment down the line.\n\"You will see them flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week,\" Hegseth told reporters Monday. \"At your direction as well, sir, there are other units we are prepared to bring in. Other National Guard units, other specialized units. They will be strong, they will be tough, and they will stand with their law enforcement partners.\"\nTrump\u2019s remarks come just after he promised Washington would be \"LIBERATED\" from \"Crime, Savagery, Filth, and Scum\" in a post on Truth Social Monday morning. He said in the post that the \"days of ruthlessly killing, or hurting, innocent people, are OVER!\"\nTrump floated the idea of taking over Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department and utilizing National Guard troops to manage crime in Washington Wednesday, following the assault of a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer on Aug. 3 in Washington\u2019s Logan Circle.\nTRUMP THREATENS TO FEDERALIZE DC AFTER EX-DOGE EMPLOYEE 'BIG BALLS' VIOLENTLY BEATEN\n\"What a shame \u2013 rate of crime, the rate of muggings, killings and everything else, we\u2019re not going to let it, and that includes bringing in the National Guard, maybe very quickly, too,\" Trump told reporters Wednesday at the White House.\nTrump also told reporters at the time he was open to taking over Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department because crime in the nation\u2019s capital is \"ridiculous.\"\nWhile a temporary federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department is justified in cases of emergency, Trump's move will likely be challenged in court over whether the situation in Washington qualifies as an emergency.\nTrump has historically railed against violence in Washington, and said Tuesday that crime is \"totally out of control\" in the nation's capital.\nMeanwhile, crime in Washington is on the decline. Violent crime is down 26% this year, in comparison to the same timeframe in 2024, according to Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department. Likewise, assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 20%, and homicides are down by 12%.\nWATCH: TRUMP HINTS HE WILL FEDERALIZE DC SOON, BRING IN NATIONAL GUARD AFTER \u2018BIG BALLS\u2019 ATTACK\nWashington\u2019s Mayor Muriel Bowser challenged Trump\u2019s description of the city during an interview with MSNBC Sunday, and voiced concerns about the possibility of activating the National Guard to tackle the city\u2019s crime.\n\"Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false,\" Bowser said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"I\u2019m concerned about them not being used efficiently, and I just think that\u2019s not the most efficient use of our Guard,\" Bowser said.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nThis is a breaking news story and will be updated."

      "text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation is the top federal law enforcement agency in the United States. The organization operates within the Department of Justice and is a part of the U.S. intelligence apparatus. The FBI reports directly to the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence. The FBI Driector is appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. The Bureau also acts as a domestic intelligence and security service and is a leading counter-terrorism organization. There are over 200 categories of crimes in which the FBI has jurisdiction. The current FBI director is Christopher Wray, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump in 2018.\nThe responsibilities of the Bureau extend to many federal crimes, including embezzlement, money laundering, sedition, terrorism, treason, cybercrime, organized crime, extortion, piracy, racketeering, and hijacking. Moreover, The FBI also does background checks and investigates all individuals being considered for employment at the top levels of the federal government, such as the White House.\nThe Bureau investigates all civil rights violations such as police brutality and racial discrimination and collects evidence in civil rights cases involving the U.S. government. The Bureau's Uniform Crime Reporting program publishes a summary of all criminal activity in the U.S. every year.\nThe FBI has more than 50 field offices in major cities and more than 400 satellite offices in smaller cities and regions across the United States. Its headquarter is in Washington D.C. at the J. Edgard Hoover Building \u2014 named after the Bureau's longest-serving director. More than 10,000 special agents are employed by the FBI to do investigative work and usually serve with the Bureau for 10 years or more. The FBI's domestic and national security efforts are comparable to Russia's FSB and the United Kingdom's MI5. The Bureau has a yearly budget of nearly $10 billion and employs more than 35,000 people."

      "text": "The Washington Post editorial board offered limited support for President Donald Trump's decision to federalize the Washington D.C. police force and send National Guard troops into the city to combat crime, but noted that \"longer-term solutions\" are needed to make a longstanding impact.\n\"However unpopular he might be in the deep-blue District, Trump is trying to deliver on the law-and-order message of his presidential campaign,\" the Post stated on Monday. \"He might not delve into the weeds of criminal justice, but lawmakers in the city and on Capitol Hill have an opportunity to enact policies that will help.\"\nTrump's decision to federalize the D.C. police force and send National Guard troops to the city on Monday came on the heels of a foiled carjacking involving one of his administration's staffers.\nTRUMP'S PLAN TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD IN DC SPARKS BACKLASH FROM RESIDENTS\u2014BUT SOME WELCOME IT\nEdward Coristine, nicknamed \"Big Balls,\" a programmer formerly appointed to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), was assaulted around 3:00 a.m. last Sunday by a group of teenagers in the city\u2019s Logan Circle neighborhood. The teens attempted to carjack him and a woman, whom police identified as his significant other, according to authorities.\nThe paper's editorial board urged the Trump administration, as well as federal and local lawmakers, to commit to enacting \"sustainable fixes\" to crime in the city.\n\"It\u2019s one thing to get tough, but it\u2019s also essential to enact sustainable fixes. Crime is a serious problem, and fighting it requires a serious commitment \u2014 from this administration, as well as federal lawmakers, the mayor, the D.C. Council, prosecutors and local judges,\" they argued.\nTRUMP CLAIMS DC CRIMES TROUNCE STATS FROM NOTORIOUSLY VIOLENT CITIES WORLDWIDE\nThe Post contended that while the increased security on the streets of D.C. may \"deter crime and keep some troublemakers from going out after dark for the rest of the summer,\" his efforts will likely have \"limited value\" unless more sustainable actions are taken, and warned that a prolonged presence of troops in the city could eventually \"agitate residents.\"\nAccording to the editorial board, what D.C. desperately needs is more police officers, but achieving that goal would require the help of Congress in restoring the city's budget.\n\"In 2023, then-Police Chief Robert J. Contee III warned that the city\u2019s force had fallen to a half-century low of about 3,350 officers, forcing the city to spend millions of dollars on overtime. D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) and the D.C. Council have already dedicated millions in their recent budget to increase staffing, as part of a goal to reach 4,000 officers by 2031,\" the editorial reported. \"Congress could restore the city\u2019s budget, which it cut while averting a shutdown earlier this year.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\nOther than increasing the number of police officers in the city, The Post pointed out two other major issues facing D.C. \u2014 both having to do with the city's youth. The paper argued that it is imperative that the city continues to prosecute juvenile offenders and also tackle the school system's truancy problem.\n\"If the D.C. attorney general\u2019s office applies justice consistently, young people can expect real consequences when they hurt others. In 2024, 73 percent of juvenile cases were prosecuted \u2014 up from less than half in 2019. That\u2019s an improvement, but the number could be higher,\" The Post asserted. \"The city also has trouble with truancy, which is closely intertwined with youth crime. Strides have been made to keep students in school. The overall number of chronically absent kids reached pre-pandemic levels last year. Still, more than half of D.C. high-schoolers continued to miss 10 percent of the academic year.\"\nIn conclusion, the paper's editorial board maintained that the issues facing D.C. \"are not the types of problems that can be easily tackled from the Oval Office or by swarming the city\u2019s streets with Humvees,\" and noted that these problems require \"sustained attention\" to ensure that crime continues to fall after the National Guard leaves the city.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nFox News' Stephen Sorace contributed to this report."
