  "content": "The Genius Owala Water Bottle Trick We Wish We'd Known About Sooner originally appeared on Parade.\n\nEvery now and then a new water bottle reigns supreme among the hydrated girls and boys, and lately, the crown belongs to the Owala FreeSip Bottle. If you don't own one yourself, you've likely seen them around.\n\nWhat Is the Owala Water Bottle?\n\nThe smooth-topped, insulated, leak-proof water bottle comes in a slew of bright or muted pastel color block designs. What's special about this bottle is the combination lid, which features a mouth spout in addition to a built-in removable sip straw, allowing for a very personalized water-drinking experience.\n\nAs someone who recently joined the Owala water bottle hive, I have to say this bottle is quite state-of-the-art. I get to cater to my hydration needs at any given moment\u2014if I need to guzzle, I use the spout, and if I'm in the middle of a treadmill run and need water fast, I sip through the straw.\n\nThe only issue with the straw? The material of the straw itself\u2014it's plastic. Before you freak out that you shelled out money on an Owala, fear not. What if we told you there was an easy, affordable way to sip water from your Owala?\n\nRelated: How To Tell if You Aren't Drinking Enough Water\n\nWhat Is the Owala Water Bottle Trick?\n\nStraw company Koala Straws recently took to TikTok to share a way to replace the plastic straw that comes with your Owala bottle with a metal straw. This clever swap means you won't expose your water (or yourself) to plastics, and your water will taste colder. When you're parched, what more could you ask for?\n\nHow to Install a Metal Water Bottle in Your Owala Water Bottle\n\nFirst, measure the dimensions of your Owala straw and search online or in stores for a metal straw of an identical size. Koala Straws sells metal straws that are custom-made to fit various sizes of Owala bottles. Open your Owala, unscrew the plastic straw, and insert the metal straw. Close and use your bottle as normal.\n\nRelated: Best Bottled Water to Drink, Ranked by The Water Sommelier\n\nOther Ways to Take Care of Your Owala Water Bottle\n\n1. Clean the spout gasket. This is the grey piece of silicone attached to the inside of the lid. You can use a sponge or dishcloth to clean the crevices where mold can grow.\n\n2. Give it a deep clean. Hand washing is fine most of the time, but every so often, run the lid and cup through the dishwasher.\n\n3. Pay special attention to the straw. Water bottle straws can get a little funky, so be sure to run a straw cleaner through yours regularly to make sure it's sparkly clean.\n\nRelated: We Tried the Viral All-Natural Way to Keep Flies From Bugging You Outside to See If It's Worth the Hype\n\nThe Genius Owala Water Bottle Trick We Wish We'd Known About Sooner first appeared on Parade on Aug 11, 2025\n\nThis story was originally reported by Parade on Aug 11, 2025, where it first appeared.",
