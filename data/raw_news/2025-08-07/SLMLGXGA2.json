  "description": "Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva is not backing down from his criticism of President Donald Trump, even as his country faces a staggering 50% tariff.",
  "content": "As President Donald Trump\u2019s global tariffs go into effect, Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva remains staunchly opposed to making deals with the U.S. The South American leader has been an outspoken critic of U.S. tariffs, which he sees as a bullying tactic.\n\n\"The day my intuition says Trump is ready to talk, I won't hesitate to call him,\" Lula told Reuters. \"But today my intuition says he doesn't want to talk. And I won't humiliate myself.\"\n\nMore than 60 countries and the European Union were hit with new tariffs just after midnight on Thursday. While the baseline rate is 10%, select nations, like Brazil, face additional penalties that push the total tariff up to 50%.\n\nIn the past, Lula slammed Trump\u2019s tariffs as \"unacceptable blackmail.\"\n\nTRUMP'S GLOBAL RESET OF TRADE RELATIONSHIPS WILL REMAIN IN THE SPOTLIGHT THIS WEEK\n\nOn July 31, one day after announcing an additional 40% tariff on Brazil, Trump said that Lula \"can talk to me anytime he wants.\" The Brazilian president seemed to respond in a post on X without mentioning Trump by name. He said that his country has \"always been open to dialogue.\"\n\n\"The ones who determine Brazil's direction are the Brazilians and their institutions. At this moment, we are working to protect our economy, businesses, and workers, and to respond to the tariff measures of the U.S. government,\" Lula wrote.\n\nTRUMP CALLS FOR IMMEDIATE END TO \u2018UNJUST\u2019 TRIAL OF FORMER BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT JAIR BOLSONARO\n\nThe dispute between Trump and Lula goes deeper than trade deals. The White House has been open about its opposition to Brazil\u2019s treatment of its former President Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nThis was emphasized in an executive order that Trump signed last month in which he decried \"the Government of Brazil\u2019s politically motivated persecution, intimidation, harassment, censorship, and prosecution\" of Bolsonaro.\n\nLula told Reuters that Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court \"does not care what Trump says, and it should not.\" He also reportedly said that Bolsonaro was a \"traitor to the homeland\" who should face another trial for provoking Trump\u2019s intervention.\n\n\"But this now is not a small intervention. It's the president of the United States thinking he can dictate rules for a sovereign country like Brazil. It's unacceptable,\" Lula said.\n\nBRAZIL\u2019S EX-PRESIDENT AND MAJOR TRUMP ALLY BOLSONARO PLACED ON HOUSE ARREST\n\nBolsonaro, who was defeated by Lula in 2022, was recently placed under house arrest amid ongoing legal proceedings over his alleged attempt to overturn the country's presidential election results.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBrazil\u2019s president is seemingly unafraid of entering negotiations with Trump. Though he said that there were no pending reciprocal tariffs, Lula told Reuters he was planning to call the leaders of BRICS member states to discuss a possible joint response to the U.S.\n\nAdditionally, according to Reuters, Lula said Brazil was looking at joining a collective complaint with other countries at the World Trade Organization.",

      "text": "Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Addresses Threats to the United States from the Government of Brazil\nADDRESSING A NATIONAL EMERGENCY: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order implementing an additional 40% tariff on Brazil, bringing the total tariff amount to 50%, to deal with recent policies, practices, and actions by the Government of Brazil that constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.\n- The Order declares a new national emergency using the President\u2019s authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) and establishes an additional 40% tariff to address the Government of Brazil\u2019s unusual and extraordinary policies and actions harming U.S. companies, the free speech rights of U.S. persons, U.S. foreign policy, and the U.S. economy.\n- The Order finds that the Government of Brazil\u2019s politically motivated persecution, intimidation, harassment, censorship, and prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and thousands of his supporters are serious human rights abuses that have undermined the rule of law in Brazil.\nUSING LEVERAGE TO SAFEGUARD OUR INTERESTS: President Trump has consistently reaffirmed his commitment to defending the United States\u2019 national security, foreign policy, and economy against foreign threats, including by safeguarding free speech, protecting U.S. companies from unlawful censorship coercion, and holding human rights abusers accountable for their lawless behavior.\n- Recently, members of the Government of Brazil have taken unprecedented actions to tyrannically and arbitrarily coerce U.S. companies to censor political speech, deplatform users, turn over sensitive U.S. user data, or change their content moderation policies on pain of extraordinary fines, criminal prosecution, asset freezes, or complete exclusion from the Brazilian market. This undermines not only the viability of U.S. companies\u2019 business operations in Brazil but also the policy of the United States in promoting free and fair elections and safeguarding fundamental human rights at home and abroad.\n- For example, since 2019, Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes has abused his judicial authority to threaten, target, and intimidate thousands of his political opponents, shield corrupt allies, and suppress dissent, often in coordination with other Brazilian officials, including other justices on Brazil\u2019s Supreme Federal Court, to the detriment of U.S. companies operating in Brazil.\n- Justice de Moraes has unilaterally issued hundreds of orders to secretly censor his political critics. When U.S. companies have refused to comply with these orders, he imposed substantial fines, ordered the companies\u2019 exclusion from Brazil\u2019s social media market, threatened their executives with criminal prosecution, and, in one case, froze the assets of a U.S. company in Brazil in an effort to coerce compliance.\n- In fact, in addition to jailing individuals without trial for social media posts, Justice de Moraes is currently overseeing the Government of Brazil\u2019s criminal prosecution of Paulo Figueiredo, a U.S. resident, for speech he made on U.S. soil, and has supported criminal investigations into other U.S. persons after they exposed his gross violations of human rights and corruption.\n- President Trump is defending American companies from extortion, protecting American persons from political persecution, safeguarding American free speech from censorship, and saving the American economy from being subject to the arbitrary edicts of a tyrannical foreign judge.\nPUTTING AMERICA FIRST: By imposing these tariffs to address the Government of Brazil\u2019s reckless actions, President Trump is protecting the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States from a foreign threat. In line with his election mandate, President Trump has also taken other actions to achieve peace through strength and ensure foreign policy reflects U.S. values, sovereignty, and security.\n- On Day One, President Trump signed an \u201cAmerica First Policy Directive\u201d to the Secretary of State that declared that the United States\u2019 foreign policy must always put the interests of America and its citizens first.\n- Consistent with this directive, on May 28, 2025, Secretary Rubio announced a visa restriction policy targeting foreign nationals responsible for the censorship of protected expression in the United States.\n- Pursuant to that policy, on July 18, President Trump directed Secretary Rubio to revoke visas belonging to Justice de Moraes, his allies on the Court, and their immediate family members for their role in enabling Justice de Moraes\u2019 human rights violations against Brazilians and free speech violations against Americans.\n- Preserving and protecting the free speech rights of all Americans and defending American companies from coerced censorship will remain at the forefront of President Trump\u2019s America First foreign policy strategy.\n- President Trump has successfully used tariffs in the past to advance America\u2019s interests and address other urgent national security threats and is doing so again today."

      "text": "President Donald Trump is calling for an immediate end to the trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who he said is the victim of \"unjust\" politically motivated attacks.\nThe Brazilian leader is facing an investigation and an upcoming trial accusing him of leading an attempted coup to stay in office after his 2022 election defeat. Earlier this week, Bolsonaro's son, Eduardo, was at the White House for meetings.\nHe later said in a video posted to social media that \"decisions are being made\" with respect to possible sanctions against Brazilian Supreme Federal Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes that the U.S. has been considering.\n\"I have seen the terrible treatment you are receiving at the hands of an unjust system turned against you. This should end immediately!\" Trump wrote in a letter he sent to Bolsonaro, which the president posted on his Truth Social account Thursday evening.\nPROSECUTORS TIED TO JAN. 6 CAPITOL RIOT CASES FIRED BY JUSTICE DEPARTMENT: REPORTS\n\"I share your commitment to listening to the voice of the people and I am very concerned about the attacks on free speech \u2013 both in Brazil and in the United States \u2013 coming out of the current government. I have strongly voiced my disapproval both publicly and through our Tariff policy.\"\nLast week, Trump threatened a 50% tariff on products from Brazil in a letter to the country's president that cited the ongoing case against Bolsonaro.\nIn November, Federal Police filed a 884-page report with Brazilian Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet detailing the scheme that alleged Bolsonaro and 33 others participated in a plan to remain in power despite losing to current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. They allege it involved systematically sowing distrust of the electoral system among the populace, drafting a decree to give the plot a veneer of legality, pressuring top military brass to go along with the plan and inciting a riot in the capital.\nA panel of justices on Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court accepted the charges against Bolsonaro in March, and it ordered the former leader to stand trial. All five justices ruled in favor of accepting the charges, which included accusations involving a plan to poison Bolsonaro's successor and kill a Supreme Court judge.\nWHITE HOUSE PUSHES BACK FORCEFULLY ON EPSTEIN FILE CRITICISM: 'ASININE SUGGESTION'\nUnder Brazilian law, a coup conviction carries a sentence of up to 12 years. When combined with the other charges, it could result in a sentence of decades behind bars.\nIn his letter to Bolsonaro, Trump said it was his \"sincere hope\" that the government in Brazil \"changes course, stops attacking political opponents, and ends their ridiculous censorship regime.\"\n\"I will be watching closely,\" Trump added.\nFor his part, Bolsonaro has denied any wrongdoing, telling reporters, \"I have no concerns about the accusations, zero.\"\nTRUMP'S TREASURY DEPARTMENT TARGETS DANGEROUS VENEZUELAN PRISON GANG WITH SANCTIONS ON 6 TOP LEADERS\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe Washington Post reported Thursday that, according to four sources familiar with the situation, the U.S. is considering levying sanctions against Judge Moraes, who is leading the case against Bolsonaro. The sanctions, according to the sources who spoke with the Post, would come under the Magnitsky Act, which allops the U.S. to impose sanctions against foreign nationals accused of corruption.\nAfter Trump threatened 50% tariffs on Brazil over the case against Bolsonaro, his successor, Lula, vowed retaliation.\n\"If there\u2019s no negotiation, the reciprocity law will be put to work. If he charges 50 (% tariffs) from us, we will charge 50 from them,\" Lula said, according to The Associated Press. \"Respect is good. I like to offer mine, and I like to receive it.\"\nFox News Digital's Emma Colton contributed to this report."

      "text": "Chinese President Xi Jinping will not attend this week\u2019s BRICS Summit in Brazil, marking the first time the Chinese leader has missed the gathering of major emerging economies. The abrupt decision has triggered widespread speculation about internal political dynamics within China and the fraying cohesion of BRICS itself.\nChina\u2019s official explanation \u2014 a \"scheduling conflict\" and the fact that Xi already met with Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva earlier this year, according to the South China Morning Post \u2014 has been met with skepticism. Premier Li Qiang will attend the summit in Xi\u2019s place, continuing a recent trend of Xi scaling back his appearances on the global stage.\n\"That doesn\u2019t make sense,\" said Gordon Chang, an expert on U.S.-China relations. \"There are many other countries at the BRICS summit, not just Brazil. To me, it\u2019s extremely significant that Xi Jinping is not going. It suggests turbulence at home \u2014 there are signs he\u2019s lost control of the military and that civilian rivals are reasserting power. This is a symptom of that.\"\nRUSSIA'S PUTIN HOSTS CHINA'S XI AT MASSIVE MOSCOW MILITARY PARADE ON RED SQUARE\nBryan Burack of the Heritage Foundation agrees that Xi\u2019s absence underscores deeper issues: \"It\u2019s another indication that BRICS is not going to be China\u2019s vassalization of the Global South.\" He noted that countries like Brazil and Indonesia have recently imposed tariffs on China over industrial overcapacity and dumping, moves that suggest widening rifts within the group.\n\"China is actively harming all those countries for the most part, maybe with some exceptions, through its malign trade policies and dumping and overcapacity.\"\nTensions with India and global trade pressure may also be factors\nSome analysts point to rising China-India friction as a contributing factor in Xi\u2019s decision to skip the summit.\n\"China has been at war with India for decades, essentially,\" Burack said. \"These are fundamentally opposing interests. It\u2019s difficult to see China changing its behavior in the near term, and that will keep tensions high.\"\nIndia\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to take a leading role at the gathering, potentially another deterrent for Xi\u2019s attendance.\nAnother key leader \u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 is only expected to address the group by video.\nAFTER TRUMP'S DEPARTURE, G7 LEADERS FAIL TO REACH AGREEMENTS ON KEY ISSUES\nBRICS: United in name, divided in decades-long tensions\nFormed by Brazil, Russia, India and China and later joined by South Africa, BRICS was envisioned as a non-Western counterweight to G7 dominance. It has expanded to include Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, the UAE and, most recently, Indonesia, strengthening its economic footprint.\nEconomist Christian Briggs highlighted BRICS\u2019s massive scale: \"BRICS now comprises 12 full members and up to 23 when counting partners. Collectively, they account for over 60% of the world\u2019s GDP and around 75% of the global population. They control vast natural resources and a growing share of global trade flows.\"\nYet despite its scale, the bloc remains ideologically and strategically fragmented. \"It\u2019s a group of countries that hate each other,\" Burack said bluntly. \"China is harming many of them through unfair trade practices. There\u2019s not a lot of incentive for real unity.\"\nCurrency ambitions and strategic divergences\nThe alliance\u2019s aspirations to challenge the U.S. dollar through alternative payment systems and a potential BRICS currency have gained media traction \u2014 but experts caution against overestimating this threat.\n\"There\u2019s been a lot of fearmongering about a BRICS currency,\" said Burack. \"But the interests of these countries are completely divergent. There\u2019s more smoke than fire when it comes to a currency challenge to the dollar.\"\nChang echoed this skepticism: \"The only country that can challenge the dollar is the United States. Weakness in the dollar is due to what we are doing domestically, not what the BRICS are doing.\"\nStill, Briggs offered a counterpoint, arguing that BRICS members are already reshaping global currency flows.\n\"They\u2019re moving away from the dollar into digital yuan, rupees, rubles. China has launched a SWIFT alternative already adopted by the Caribbean banking sector \u2014 trillions of dollars are shifting.\"\nMACRON CHIDES TRUMP, CHINA OVER TRADE, UKRAINE, GAZA: POLICIES 'WILL KILL GLOBAL ORDER'\nIs BRICS still a threat to U.S. influence?\nWhile its cohesion remains questionable, BRICS poses a long-term challenge to U.S. influence \u2014 particularly in regions where Washington has retreated diplomatically and economically.\n\"China filled the void left by the U.S. in places like Africa,\" said Briggs. \"Now it controls about 38% of the world\u2019s minerals. Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s economy has doubled despite sanctions, because they preemptively reduced reliance on the dollar.\"\nYet Chang sees India as a brake on any aggressive anti-Western tilt. \"BRICS has an \u2018I\u2019 in it\u2014and that\u2019s India. Modi doesn\u2019t want to be part of an anti-Western bloc. As long as India\u2019s in BRICS, the rest of the world is safe.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nA missed opportunity \u2014 or a calculated power move?\nTo some, Xi's no-show signals instability in Beijing. To others, the opposite: it demonstrates confidence in China's dominance over the other BRICS members.\n\"He doesn\u2019t have to be there,\" Briggs contended. \"Xi\u2019s power allows him to delegate. China is trading with nearly 80% of the world now. He\u2019s moving the agenda forward even in absentia.\"\nWhat\u2019s clear is that BRICS continues to evolve \u2014 its internal contradictions as visible as its geopolitical ambitions. Whether Xi's absence marks a retreat or a recalibration remains one of the key questions hovering over the summit in Brazil."

      "text": "President Donald Trump's global reset of trade relationships will remain in the spotlight this week as his administration moves forward with sweeping new taxes on imports.\nThe White House said last week that the new tariff rates, originally slated to take effect Aug. 1, will come into force on Thursday in order to give U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials additional time to prepare to collect the duties.\nWHERE TRUMP'S TARIFFS STAND NOW AND THE WINDING ROAD THAT LED US HERE\nIn the days leading up to the Aug. 1 deadline, Trump announced trade deals with Japan, the European Union, and South Korea. So far, 11 of the U.S.'s top 15 trading partners have agreed to broad trade deals.\nLast week, Trump raised import tariffs on goods from Canada to 35%, signaling a widening rift with America\u2019s second-largest trading partner.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt previously singled out Ottawa during a July 17 press briefing, saying \"our neighbors to the north have been pretty difficult to deal with\" when asked about the ongoing trade talks.\nWHITE HOUSE SAYS CANADA HAS BEEN 'DIFFICULT' AS TRADE DEADLINE LOOMS\nSpeaking to CBS News on Sunday, Dominic LeBlanc, Canada\u2019s lead on U.S. trade relations, said Prime Minister Mark Carney is likely to hold talks with President Trump \"over the next number of days.\"\nMeanwhile, the U.S. struck temporary truces with China and Mexico as trade representatives continue negotiations.\nTRUMP ANNOUNCES TRADE DEAL WITH EUROPEAN UNION\nSo far this year, the U.S. has collected over $150 billion in tariff revenues, according to Treasury data. In July alone, collections exceeded $29 billion, the highest monthly total to date in 2025.\nTrump administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have previously said the tariffs could generate more than $300 billion in revenue for the federal government.\nAmerican consumers often end up bearing the cost of tariffs, as U.S. businesses pass along higher prices to offset the economic burden."

He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump. Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022.

      "text": "On Monday, Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest amid ongoing legal proceedings over his alleged attempt to overturn the 2022 presidential election results.\nThe case has gripped the nation since its inception in 2023 and has intensified international scrutiny, especially as it unfolds under the authority of a Supreme Court justice recently sanctioned by the Trump administration in the United States.\nJustice Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing the case, accused Bolsonaro, 70, of violating court-imposed restrictions.\nAccording to the ruling, first reported by the Associated Press, Bolsonaro used a Sunday protest in Rio de Janeiro to publicly address supporters using a cellphone owned by one of his three sons, all of whom are lawmakers.\nTRUMP ADMIN SANCTIONS BRAZILIAN JUDGE OVERSEEING BOLSONARO COUP-PLOT PROBE\nBolsonaro\u2019s brief message, \"Good afternoon, Copacabana, good afternoon my Brazil, a hug to everyone, this is for our freedom,\" was deemed a violation of his release conditions.\nBolsonaro\u2019s legal team announced plans to appeal, arguing that the statement was symbolic, not criminal, and did not justify additional restrictions.\nMounting International Fallout\nThe political stakes have now extended well beyond Brazil. The case triggered backlash from President Trump, a longtime Bolsonaro ally, who tied newly imposed U.S. tariffs on Brazilian imports to what he called an ongoing \"witch hunt.\" His remarks have further strained the already delicate diplomatic relationship between the two nations.\nIn a pointed statement on X, the U.S. State Department\u2019s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs condemned the Brazilian court\u2019s actions, writing: \"Putting even more restrictions on Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s ability to defend himself in public is not a public service. Let Bolsonaro speak!\"\nAPPEALS COURT GRANTS TRUMP SHORT-TERM WIN OVER BOASBERG IN IMMIGRATION RULING\nThe bureau also warned that individuals involved in what it described as \"sanctioned behavior\" would be held accountable.\nThe statement marked a sharp escalation, particularly as it followed closely on the heels of sanctions imposed by the U.S. Treasury Department, under Trump\u2019s administration, against Justice de Moraes. He was designated a \"U.S.-sanctioned human rights abuser\" and accused of weaponizing the judiciary to silence political opponents.\nThe Basis for Sanctions\nSecretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent accused de Moraes of leading an unlawful crackdown:\n\"Alexandre de Moraes has taken it upon himself to be judge and jury in an unlawful witch hunt against U.S. and Brazilian citizens and companies. He is responsible for an oppressive campaign of censorship, arbitrary detentions, and politicized prosecutions\u2014including those against former President Jair Bolsonaro,\" Bessent said.\nTRUMP FOE JUDGE BOASBERG RULES DEPORTED MIGRANTS CAN CHALLENGE REMOVALS, IN BLOW TO ADMIN\nThese sanctions were imposed under Executive Order 13818, issued during Trump\u2019s first term in 2017. The order declared a national emergency concerning global human rights abuses and corruption and expanded upon the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act passed in 2016. The law empowers the U.S. government to impose financial and travel sanctions on foreign officials accused of human rights violations.\nDespite growing international pressure, the Brazilian government has yet to issue a formal response.\nDetails of the Case\nBrazilian prosecutors allege that Bolsonaro led a coordinated effort to delegitimize, and ultimately overturn, the results of the 2022 election, including planning violent acts and even an alleged assassination plot targeting President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and Justice de Moraes. Bolsonaro lost the election by a narrow margin.\nA panel of Supreme Court justices accepted the charges in March, ultimately ordering Bolsonaro to stand trial.

A defendant who knowingly violates precautionary measures\u2014especially for the second time\u2014must face legal consequences.\"\nFox News' Alec Schemmel and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\nStepheny Price is a writer for Fox News Digital and Fox Business.
