      "text": "History Sings at The Barns\nby Wolf Trap\nin Foundation, The Barns\nFeb 26, 2025\nEvery year, The Barns at Wolf Trap welcomes patrons for extraordinary performances from rock legends and opera stars to country icons and chamber musicians. With each show, The Barns\u2019 hand-hewn timber beams resonate with world-class music and the spirit of those who built, restored, and cherished them.\nThis year, the German Barn celebrates its 300th anniversary\u2014one of The Barns\u2019 two historic structures\u2014in a milestone that embodies founder Catherine Filene Shouse\u2019s vision to honor the past while building something new.\nTake a step back in history and explore the rich journey of how The Barns came to be with the timeline below.\nBUILDING THE BARNS\nThe Barns is composed of two historic structures that create a one-of-a-kind performance setting. The larger German Barn serves as the main performance space, while the smaller Scottish Barn houses the warm and intimate dining and reception areas.\nBefore the German Barn and Scottish Barn became \u201cThe Barns,\u201d they each had a story all their own.\n1725: A German Craftsman\u2019s Legacy\nThe German Barn was built in 1725 by Johann Peter Kniskern in Blenheim, NY (Schoharie County). Kniskern initially designed the structure to serve only a small group of people and as a humble home to seven cows and two horses. Nestled among its hand-hewn beams, the building contained a traditional German \u201cSwing Beam,\u201d that allowed horses to be unhitched and turned into stalls without obstruction.\nLearn More About Johann Peter Kniskern\nJohann Peter Kniskern (1683-1759), born in Reinheim, Hesse, was a key figure among the Palatinate Germans who fled war, harsh winters, high taxes, and religious oppression in 1708. Recruited by the British government to extract naval supplies from New York\u2019s forests, Kniskern and his family arrived in England in 1709. Serving as listmaster aboard the Lion of Leith, he led the first ship of Palatines to New York on June 13, 1710. After Crown support ended in 1712, Kniskern guided a group westward to settle in the Schoharie Valley in 1713.\n1791-1792: Scottish Heritage in New York\nThe Scottish Barn was crafted by a Scotsman from the Jackson, NY area between 1791 and 1792. The barn\u2019s original owner, Joseph Valentine, was born in Long Island in 1750, fought in the American Revolution, and was likely a descendant of the Lancashire, England Valentines.\nBuilt in the traditional Scottish style, this first-generation Scotch barn was constructed much as the carpenters would have built in their homeland. It was designed to house five cows and two horses, and while the main timbers were still hand-hewn, they were larger, benefiting from the size and straightness of American trees.\nA TIMELESS VISION\n1979: The Dream for a Concert Hall\nNearly two centuries after the construction of each barn, Wolf Trap founder Mrs. Catherine Filene Shouse found inspiration for a new kind of performing arts venue. Mrs. Shouse attended an outstanding concert in a historic barn in Maine and quickly sought to replicate the experience as a gift to Washington, DC-area audiences.\nThrough a recommendation from the legendary opera conductor and Wolf Trap musical director, Sarah Caldwell, Mrs. Shouse hired Mary Otis Stevens and her architectural firm, Design Guild, to create a year-round concert hall and reception space with barn-like structures.\nLearn More About Mary Otis Stevens\nMary Otis Stevens (b. 1928) is a pioneering American architect who grew up in the Hudson River Valley in NY and currently resides in Cambridge, MA. Stevens earned a philosophy degree from Smith College in 1949 and subsequently graduated from MIT\u2019s architecture program in 1956. Stevens\u2019 fascination of the vernacular traditions of American architecture led her to be selected by Mrs. Shouse for The Barns project. She founded the Design Guild firm in 1975, which developed The Barns\u2019 architectural designs, preliminary drawings, and construction documents.\nMrs. Shouse\u2019s priority was to create a natural musical environment that didn\u2019t need sound enhancements, like many of Europe\u2019s esteemed concert halls. Stevens understood this, and thanks to her research on early American vernacular architecture, she and Mrs. Shouse agreed to a design featuring two original, antique barns.\nFinding the Right Barns\nStevens knew that choosing the right barns was crucial to realizing Mrs. Shouse\u2019s vision. She sought out renowned barn preservationist and historian Richard Babcock, an expert in Hudson River Valley barns. Known for his masterful restoration of pre-Revolutionary structures, Babcock held a reputation for repurposing historic buildings with exceptional craftsmanship\u2014making him the perfect collaborator.\nFortunately, Babcock had an impressive inventory of historic northeastern barns, including the German \u201cSwing Beam\u201d Barn he purchased earlier from Harold and Gertrude Kniskern and the Scottish Barn from Frank Seymour.\nStevens and Babcock explored potential options in his barn collection and quickly identified the German Barn as a perfect match.\n\u201cWe swung the hay doors open and Mary\u2019s eyes lit up with delight. She said it was love at first sight and that she would try to incorporate the barn into the Wolf Trap project.\u201d \u2013Richard Babcock\nSubsequently, they visited the smaller, second barn of Scotch design and Stevens was equally impressed. Babcock sent drawings of both barns to Stevens at the Design Guild, and the work to create a world-class venue began.\n\u201c\u2026these barns exhibit the building traditions of the settlers\u2019 home countries. These historic barns are Temples in wood.\u201d \u2013Mary Otis Stevens, architect\nA VENUE TAKES SHAPE\n1980-1981: The Dream Begins\nMrs. Shouse was pleased with Stevens\u2019 selection of the German Barn and Scottish Barn for Wolf Trap and a contract was drawn up for Babcock relocate the structures to Vienna, VA.\nEach barn was measured and documented with drawings and photographs, then carefully dismantled and brought to Babcock\u2019s workshop in Hancock, MA. The barns were restored there with slight modifications to accommodate the new concert functions.\nRebuilding History in Virginia\nIn late 1980, Babcock and his team of craftsmen transported the restored barns piece-by-piece from Hancock, MA to Vienna, VA and re-erected them by hand, using gin poles.\nMrs. Shouse chose The Barns location in part because of the proximity to her private residence which allowed artists such as Beverly Sills or cellist Mstislav Rostropovich to stop by for lunch.\nOnce the structures were reassembled, Stevens built around them and developed an atrium to merge the historic barns with the stage areas, staff offices, restrooms, and kitchen. A central courtyard served as an overflow space and facilitated the circulation of audiences.\nStevens made two major changes to the outside\u2014she built a series of square windows on the side wall of the Scottish Barn, and while preserving the silhouette, she added to the German Barn with the stage at the back. Where the old German Barn ended, the stage began.\nA Preview of What\u2019s to Come\nMrs. Shouse formally donated The Barns at Wolf Trap in 1981 as a diverse and intimate year-round performance space for local arts lovers.\nIn October 1981, The Barns welcomed patrons for a preview season featuring Glenn Jacobsen and Edward Mattos, An Evening of Gilbert & Sullivan by The London Savoyards, the film From Mao to Mozart: Isaac Stern in China, Baroque Music Works, the Wolf Trap Chamber Group, and The No Elephant Circus.\nA MUSIC SPACE FOR ALL\n1982: The Barns Debuts\nThe Barns officially opened in January, 1982, with performances by The Columbine and Primavera String Quartets, instantly striking a perfect chord.\nThe Washington Post praised The Barns\u2019 historic charm writing, \u201cThe space feels right. It suits its new purpose like an old glove. The aged textures of those hand-hewn hardwood beams and studs have something to do with this quality, but it\u2019s also due to space itself, almost as if Johann Peter Kniskern had something more than hay and horses in mind when he built the barn\u2026\u201d\n1982-2000s: A Stage for Legends and Rising Stars\nIn its first decade, The Barns became a destination for renowned artists across genres. From Tony Bennett, Judy Collins, and Preservation Hall Jazz Band to Mary Chapin Carpenter, Vince Gill, and The Washington Ballet, the venue attracted a wide range of extraordinary talent.\nThe cozy venue also transformed into the summer home of Wolf Trap Opera starting in 1982 with performances of Mozart\u2019s Cosi fan tutte, Stravinsky\u2019s A Soldier\u2019s Tale, and Haydn\u2019s The Apothecary. The premier summer residency program, which continues today, launches the careers of emerging opera stars and features innovative productions.\nLater in 1985, The Barns introduced BARNSTORM!, a beloved children\u2019s series featuring folk music, mime, puppetry, and storytelling, which ran through 1996.\n1990s-2000s: Iconic Performances and Rising Stars\nThe 1990s and 2000s carried on with an exceptional slate of icons, legends, and rising stars like Harry Connick, Jr., Alison Krauss & Union Station, The Dixie Chicks, Zakir Hussain, Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo, The Avett Brothers, Kristin Chenoweth, B\u00e9la Fleck, Chris Thile, and Toots & The Maytals who graced the stage.\nClassical music remained a cornerstone of each season and the Discovery Series launched in 1996 to showcase masterful chamber artists. The series was renamed to Chamber Music at The Barns in 2014 and continues today to host the best of the genre including Wu Han, David Finckel, Pinchas Zukerman, Chamber Society of Lincoln Center, and many more.\n2010s: Renovation and Evolution\nThe talent continued to grow at The Barns with remarkable performances by Brandi Carlile, Graham Nash, Patti LuPone, Art Garfunkel, DeeDee Bridgewater, Sheila E, Ronnie Spector & The Ronettes, Old Dominion, and Omara Portuondo, among many others.\nIn 2018, The Barns underwent an exciting renovation that marked the first time major changes were made to the venue since its opening. Led by design firm Gensler and general contractor L.F. Jennings, the refresh featured a glass-covered atrium, a new front entrance, upgraded patron amenities, and a coat of warm red paint on the exterior. The enhancements seamlessly blended The Barns\u2019 historic essence with modern amenities, all made possible thanks to the philanthropic support of Dan and Gayle D\u2019Aniello.\n2020s: Blending Modern Comfort with Historic Charm\nIn 2021, audiences at The Barns were welcomed by a fresh wave of enhancements designed to elevate their experience. A revitalized bar area and an expanded kitchen allowed for a more robust pre-show menu, while long-awaited improvements transformed backstage spaces. Performers benefited from a new backstage crossover, an accessible elevator to dressing rooms, and refurbished pre-show areas\u2014ensuring both comfort and convenience without compromising The Barns\u2019 historic nature.\nJust a few artists who have already made their mark at The Barns this decade are T Bone Burnett, The Del McCoury Band, Darren Criss, Tanya Tucker, Mavis Staples, Pinchas Zukerman, Ali Sethi, Kelli O\u2019Hara, The Miro Quartet, Darlene Love, Booker T. Jones, and The Last Bandoleros, with many more to come.\nAdditionally, each spring the German Barn now hosts local students and educators as a part of Wolf Trap\u2019s Grants for Performing Arts Teachers program.\nCELEBRATING THE BARNS\nToday, 300 years after the German Barn was first constructed, it is no doubt builder Johann Peter Kniskern would be thrilled to see his craftmanship celebrated and expanded on in such remarkable ways. As architect Mary Otis Stevens shared, \u201cWhat most delights me about The Barns at Wolf Trap is how they have met their challenges and continue to be a beloved cultural amenity.\u201d\nIndeed, The Barns at Wolf Trap is living proof that history not only lasts\u2014it sings.\n\u201cBarnstorming Wolf Trap Farm,\u201d Benjamin Forgey, The Washington Post, January 8, 1982; \u201cBarn-Theater at Wolf Trap,\u201d The New York Times, January 7, 1982; \u201cJohann Peter Kniskern \u2013 Builder of the German Barn,\u201dRobert & Patricia Sheehy, 2024, Wolf Trap Foundation Archives, Vienna, VA; \u201cMary Otis Stevens Biography and Remarks,\u201d 2024, Wolf Trap Foundation Archives, Vienna, VA; Mary Otis Stevens Materials and Wolf Trap Images, MIT Museum Archive; The Barns at Wolf Trap, Richard Babcock and Jack Sobon, 1982, Wolf Trap Foundation Archives, Vienna, VA; \u201cRichard Babcock\u2019s Involvement with The Barns,\u201d Richard Babcock, Wolf Trap Foundation Archives, Vienna, VA\nRecommended Posts\nWolf Trap Member Benefits at The Barns\nAug 11, 2025 - Experience, The Barns\nWolf Trap Opera\u2019s Visionary Women\nJun 04, 2025 - Foundation, Opera\nWolf Trap Opera Alumni Shine Brightly\nJun 03, 2025 - Foundation, Opera"
