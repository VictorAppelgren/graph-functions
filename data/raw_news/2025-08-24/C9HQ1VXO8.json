  "title": "How Much Does It Cost To Replace The CP4 Pump On A Ford 6.7 Power Stroke? Here's What Owners Say",
  "description": "Having problems with the CP4 Pump on your Ford? Replacing the pump may be the only solution if its gone too far, but that repair won't be a cheap one.",
  "content": "The good news is that only a low percentage, 10% or less, of CP4 pumps will fail prematurely. However, the general consensus on what constitutes a \"premature\" failure is anything under 100K miles, way less than the expected lifespan of a typical 6.7 Power Stroke engine.\n\nThe most significant issue with the CP4 failure on these engines is the shrapnel released into the fuel system when the pump dies. It's the metal shards that necessitate the replacement of the entire fuel system, which drives the repair cost upwards of $15K. Not only does it require replacing the pump and injectors, but the high-pressure fuel lines have to be replaced, and the entire fuel system cleaned at a minimum.\n\nThere's really no way to prevent a CP4 pump destined for failure from doing so, but there are some steps you can take to help prolong the life of the majority of them. First, you'll want to stay on top of essential diesel engine maintenance, especially anything related to the fuel system. Next, using a diesel fuel additive, like Hot Shot's Secret, provides extra lubrication for the CP4 pump's internal components that are prone to failure.\n\nEven with a fuel additive, most owners advise buying good-quality diesel fuel from busy stations with high volume. Finally, a CP4 Disaster Prevention Kit, mentioned above, is cheap insurance against catastrophe in the event of a CP4 pump failure. Even if the pump never fails, the prevention kit still provides an extra layer of fuel filtering.",

      "text": "5 Essential Diesel Engine Maintenance Tips You Should Know\nDiesel engines are renowned for their remarkable low-end torque, longevity, and sterling fuel economy. Diesel fuel packs 10% to 15% more energy than gasoline or petrol, enabling it to go 35% farther on a gallon of diesel fuel. Moreover, diesel engines have larger, sturdier internal components and a larger oil capacity to handle more abuse. Diesel engines produce peak torque at lower engine speeds, so they don't need to rev like a Honda S2000 to climb slopes or pull heavy loads.\nHowever, diesel motors require proper maintenance to tick like a clock at every start. Warning signs like poor fuel economy, rough idling, difficulty starting, low power output, and bluish smoke from the exhaust means it's time to visit the shop and give your diesel a much-needed check-up. Before any symptoms rear their ugly heads, here are five diesel engine maintenance tips that every diesel owner should know for their truck.\nDiesel maintenance essentials\nDiesel engines could run above 1,000,000 miles before requiring a major overhaul, but there's a catch: Diesel mills require frequent maintenance over the engine's lifespan. A typical diesel would generally need fewer trips to the garage than a gas-powered vehicle, but the repair costs are higher if something goes wrong. Nothing lasts forever, but applying these maintenance hacks will add more miles to your trusty diesel mill.\n- Change the oil frequently. The oil change intervals would depend on the make and model of your ride. Refer to the owner's manual to determine when to change the oil. An average diesel pickup truck requires an oil change every 5,000 to 7,000 miles, but the rule of thumb is to change the oil every three months for workhorse diesel engines that do a lot of hauling, towing, and climbing.\n- Regularly change the oil and air filters. Diesel engines running on clogged or filthy oil and air filters will have less power and more smoke. It's a good idea to change the oil filter in every oil change, and to clean or replace the air filter at least once a year (or every 15,000 miles).\n- Give the diesel a few moments to warm before stepping on the go-pedal. Diesel engines may be larger, heavier, and more durable than a gasoline mill, but they are no less susceptible to excessive friction from cold starts. Allow the engine to idle for at least a minute (or longer in icy weather) before putting it in gear, allowing the oil to circulate and apply its lubricating powers to internal components before the action begins.\n- Replenish or drain the coolant. Diesel engines require more frequent coolant changes than gasoline, with most requiring a coolant drain every two years, or 30,000 miles. Since diesels operate at higher compression ratios, the vibrations in each cylinder would cause the coolant to cavitate over time, damaging the water pump impeller and causing coolant degradation.\n- Periodically inspect and change the fuel filters. Dirty or clogged-up fuel filters could affect fuel injector performance. Replace the fuel filters every 10,000 to 25,000 miles."

      "text": "How Many Miles Will A 6.7 Power Stroke Engine Last?\nFord's 6.7 Power Stroke diesel is still in use in Super Duty F-series trucks after launching in 2011. There have been three generations of the 6.7-liter Power Stroke, and the later versions score higher in durability and reliability. No engine is perfect, but experts and real-world users consider the 6.7 Power Stroke diesel one of history's most reliable V8 engines despite its faults. First-gen examples from 2011 to 2014 have known issues with the ceramic turbocharger ball bearings and Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) sensors, and pre-2020 models are known to suffer injection pump failures.\nDespite this, there's no arguing that the 6.7-liter Power Stroke engine is a paragon of efficiency and power output. The 2025 F-Series Super Duty is available with Standard Output and High Output versions of the 6.7 Power Stroke. The standard version produces 475 horsepower and 1,050 lb-ft of torque, while the high-output variant has up to 500 horsepower and 1,200 lb-ft of torque. Those numbers unlock a maximum tow rating of 30,000 lbs. and up to 40,000 lbs. with a gooseneck hitch.\nThe 6.7 is the longest-running iteration of the Blue Oval's Power Stroke diesel engine family for a reason. Some examples have upwards of 1 million miles on the clock with the original engine and transmission. We don't find that surprising since Ford has engineered the 6.7 Power Stroke to be a reliable workhorse.\nThe Ford 6.7 Power Stroke is ready for the long haul\nThe 6.7 Power Stroke has tough internals. It has common rail direct injection, piston-cooling jets, and a graphite iron engine block to deliver lasting durability. Moreover, the engine has a diesel particulate filter, exhaust gas recirculation, and selective catalytic reduction for lower emissions. All those features have made the 6.7 an emblem of diesel reliability. \"My 2011 work truck has 313,000 miles, and it's been a great truck so far,\" said u/ungerz28 on the r/Diesel subreddit.\n\"I work for a railroad, and we have at least five 6.7s with over 350,000 miles and intact emissions,\" added u/awr90. Care will save any car, but proper maintenance will make reliable engines last longer. Regularly changing the oil, replacing the necessary filters, and maintaining the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system and diesel particulate filters (DPF) are essential to keeping diesel engines \u2014 including the 6.7 Power Stroke \u2014 ticking like a clock."
