  "title": "The Detroit Pistons Might Have Priced Themselves Out Of Malik Beasley",
  "description": "The Pistons can no longer offer Malik Beasley the three-year, $42 million contract that they reportedly discussed before he popped up in a federal gambling investigation.",
  "content": "Shortly before NBA free agency began at the end of June, ESPN's Shams Charania broke the news that federal authorities were investigating Detroit Pistons guard Malik Beasley \"on allegations of gambling related to NBA games and prop bets.\" The timing could not have been worse for Beasley, who was set to become an unrestricted free agent and reportedly had a major payday awaiting him.\n\nAccording to Charania, Beasley and the Pistons were \"in discussions\" about a three-year, $42 million contract that they would have given him via their $14.1 million non-taxpayer mid-level exception. However, once Beasley got ensnared in the gambling investigation, the Pistons instead pivoted to giving Caris LeVert a two-year, $28.9 million contract with their non-taxpayer MLE.\n\nOn Friday, Beasley\u2019s attorneys told Charania that he \"is no longer a target\" of the gambling investigation after they had \"extensive conversations and meetings with the Eastern District of New York.\" Unfortunately, the Pistons are no longer able to offer him the same three-year, $42 million contract that he otherwise was in line to receive since they\u2019ve already spent their non-taxpayer MLE on LeVert.\n\nSince Beasley originally signed a one-year, $6 million contract with the Pistons in 2024, they only have non-Bird rights on him. They're allowed to re-sign him to a contract starting at 120% of what he earned last season, or $7.2 million, but that's a far cry from the roughly $14 million starting salary that he was previously expected to receive.\n\nOther teams are now in position to outbid Detroit for Beasley, although the Pistons could try to pitch him on a one-year paycut for larger riches in 2026.\n\nWhich Teams Can Outbid Detroit For Beasley?\n\nAt the moment, the Brooklyn Nets are the only team with any available salary-cap space. However, they aren't the only threat to sign Beasley. Multiple teams still have some or all of their non-taxpayer MLE available, as Keith Smith of Spotrac relayed.\n\nThe Miami Heat and Sacramento Kings can\u2019t offer Beasley much more than Detroit can, although the lack of state income tax in Florida could work in the Heat\u2019s favor. (The nation-high state income tax in California could work against the Kings in that regard, too.) The reigning champion Oklahoma City Thunder can offer him roughly $1.3 million more than the Pistons, although they already have 15 guaranteed contracts on their books and have plenty of depth at shooting guard.\n\nThe Chicago Bulls have an open roster spot and are roughly $38.6 million below the luxury-tax line, so they have the wherewithal to spend their full non-taxpayer MLE on Beasley. However, that final roster spot is presumably bookmarked for Josh Giddey, who\u2019s stuck in a restricted-free-agency standstill. Even if the Bulls were interested in opening another roster spot for Beasley, they likely wouldn\u2019t do so before knowing exactly how much Giddey will cost them next year. Crossing into luxury-tax territory figures to be a non-starter for them.\n\nThe same goes for the Charlotte Hornets, who are currently $11.7 million below the tax line. They need to begin showing progress at some point, but a team that won 19 games last season and hasn\u2019t made the playoffs since 2015-16 has no business paying the luxury tax yet. Besides, they just spent the No. 4 overall pick on fellow 2-guard Kon Knueppel, whom they'd presumably like to see in the starting lineup sooner than later.\n\nThat leaves the Nets and Washington Wizards as perhaps the biggest legitimate threats to the Pistons for Beasley. Either one could essentially view him as a short-term rental that they'd aim to flip for future-focused compensation, perhaps by the Feb. 5 trade deadline. Both are currently over the 15-man regular-season roster limit, although the Nets have four players on non-guaranteed contracts whom they could waive to make more room.\n\nHowever, the Nets and/or Wizards might prefer to preserve their non-taxpayer MLE to use as an in-season trade exception. If that\u2019s the case, the Pistons may still have a shot to re-sign Beasley even if they can't match other teams' potential offers.\n\nWhile the Pistons can only sign Beasley to a contract starting at $7.2 million this year, they could try to pitch him on taking a two-year deal with a second-year player option. That would allow him to test free agency again next offseason, which might give him a better chance to cash in barring another surprise right before free agency begins.\n\nIf Beasley does re-sign with the Pistons this year, they'll have Early Bird rights on him next offseason. That would allow them to sign him to a new contract starting at either 175% of what he earned in 2025-26 or 105% of the average salary in 2025-26, which is currently $13.9 million. That still might not match the projected non-taxpayer MLE in 2025-26 ($15.0 million), but it isn't far off, and the Pistons could offer Beasley higher annual raises (8%) than any other team (5%).\n\nIf the final average salary lands at $13.9 million this season, the Pistons could start Beasley\u2019s next contract at $14.6 million in 2026-27 and give him a four-year, $65.5 million deal in total. If he signed with another team via the projected $15.0 million non-taxpayer MLE, he'd have a slightly higher starting salary, but the smaller annual raises would cause his four-year deal to top out at $64.7 million.\n\nAll of those are rough estimates and remain subject to change, but either way, there likely won't be much of a difference between Beasley taking the non-taxpayer MLE from another team next offseason and re-signing with the Pistons via Early Bird rights. He'd still have to make peace with earning less this year than he could with another team, but he could make up some of those lost earnings next offseason.\n\nIf he's comfortable in Detroit and believes he'll have a similar role even after the offseason additions of LeVert and Duncan Robinson, Beasley might be willing to take that leap of faith. But if he thinks he'd be at risk of fading into the background in a de facto contract year, he might be more open to exploring his other options.\n\nThe timing of the gambling investigation could not have been worse for either Beasley or the Pistons, both of whom had to audible right before free agency began. The Pistons made the best of a bad situation by landing LeVert and Robinson, but Beasley\u2019s fate remains less clear. Either way, he's no longer looking at the same payday in Detroit as he was two months ago.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all stats via NBA.com, PBPStats, Cleaning the Glass or Basketball Reference.

      "text": "NBA free agent Malik Beasley, who is under investigation in a federal gambling probe, was evicted from his high-rise apartment in Detroit on Wednesday, according to court records.\nBeasley's landlord sued him twice this year in Michigan's 36th District Court for a total of $21,505 in unpaid rent, the records show. The first case was dismissed in March, but the court issued an eviction order in the second suit -- for $7,355 -- after Beasley failed to respond.\nNo attorney is listed for Beasley in the eviction lawsuit. Steve Haney, who is Beasley's attorney in the federal gambling investigation, told ESPN that he is not representing Beasley in this matter.\nBeasley's social media posts in recent weeks indicate that he has been traveling in Europe.\nBeasley, 28, is the third NBA player known to be investigated by the Eastern District of New York for gambling allegations in the past 18 months. The allegations against him are from the 2023-24 season, when he was with the Milwaukee Bucks, sources told ESPN. He has not been charged with a crime.\n\"An investigation is not a charge,\" Haney previously told ESPN. \"Malik is afforded the same right of the presumption of innocence as anyone else under the U.S. Constitution. As of now, he has not been charged with anything.\"\nBeasley was coming off a resurgent season with the Detroit Pistons and was in discussions with the team about a three-year, $42 million deal, according to ESPN's Shams Charania. The discussions have been put on hold, according to Charania.\nBeasley has earned nearly $60 million during his nine-year NBA career.\nBeasley is also being sued by his former marketing agency, Hazan Sports Management, which alleges that he struggled to pay back a $650,000 advance earlier this year. The Detroit News reported in July that Beasley also owes debts to a celebrity barber, a dentist and a company that provides bridge loans to professional athletes."

      "text": "Federal authorities are investigating Detroit Pistons guard Malik Beasley on allegations of gambling related to NBA games and prop bets, sources told ESPN on Sunday.\nThe allegations are from the 2023-24 season, when Beasley played for the Milwaukee Bucks, sources said. Beasley averaged 11.3 points in 79 games that season, during which he made a career-high 77 starts.\nAt least one prominent U.S. sportsbook detected unusually heavy betting interest on Beasley's statistics beginning around January 2024, a gambling industry source told ESPN's David Purdum.\nA gambling industry source pointed to a game between the Bucks and the Portland Trail Blazers on Jan. 31, 2024. The odds on Beasley recording fewer than 2.5 rebounds moved significantly at sportsbooks before the game, shortening from around +120 to around -250 due to a surge of action on the under. Beasley finished with six rebounds, and the bets that were deemed unusual lost.\n\"An investigation is not a charge,\" Beasley's attorney, Steve Haney, told ESPN. \"Malik is afforded the same right of the presumption of innocence as anyone else under the U.S. Constitution. As of now he has not been charged with anything.\"\nHaney told ABC News in a brief phone interview Sunday afternoon that he has been in touch with prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of New York, which he understands is leading the investigation.\nBeasley, 28, and the Pistons were in talks on a three-year, $42 million contract to bring the free agent sharpshooter back to Detroit but now talks are on pause, sources said.\nThe Pistons told ESPN on Sunday that they are aware of an investigation into Beasley and are deferring further comment to the NBA.\n\"We are cooperating with the federal prosecutors' investigation,\" NBA spokesman Mike Bass told ESPN.\nThe nine-year veteran averaged 16.3 points while appearing in all 82 games last season, his first with the Pistons. He made 319 3-pointers, the most in a season in Pistons franchise history.\nLast year, former Toronto Raptors forward Jontay Porter was banned by the NBA after a league investigation found Porter disclosed confidential information to sports bettors and wagered on games.\nEarlier this year, it was announced that Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier was under federal investigation for activity related to unusual betting patterns surrounding him in a March 2023 game when he was playing for the Charlotte Hornets. Rozier has not been charged with any crime, nor has he faced any sanction from the NBA.\nIn 2020, when Beasley played for the Minnesota Timberwolves, he pleaded guilty to a felony charge of threats of violence and was sentenced to 120 days in jail, which he served after the 2020-21 season. He also was suspended for 12 games by the NBA in 2021 as a result of the guilty plea.\nBeasley has been a journeyman since spending his first six seasons with the Denver Nuggets and Timberwolves; the Pistons were his fifth team in four years.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

      "text": "Malik Beasley is no longer a target of the federal gambling investigation conducted by the Eastern District of New York, his attorneys, Steve Haney and Mike Schachter, told ESPN on Friday, potentially reopening free agency for one of the NBA's top shooters.\nHaney and Schachter told ESPN that they had extensive conversations and meetings with the Eastern District of New York and received determination on Beasley not being considered the target after allegations regarding gambling on NBA games and prop bets during the 2023-24 season.\n\"Months after this investigation commenced, Malik remains uncharged and is not the target of this investigation,\" Haney told ESPN. \"An allegation with no charge, indictment or conviction should never have the catastrophic consequence this has caused Malik. This has literally been the opposite of the presumption of innocence.\"\nA spokesperson for the US. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York declined to comment on the matter Friday.\nESPN reported on June 29 that Beasley was under a federal investigation -- which resulted in all of his free agent negotiations and offers being halted one day before the official start of free agency. At the time, NBA spokesperson Mike Bass said: \"We are cooperating with the federal prosecutors' investigation.\"\nSources said that Beasley and the Detroit Pistons were set to complete a three-year, $42 million contract to bring the 28-year-old guard back but that proposal evaporated after the franchise became aware of the federal investigation, and sources said other interested teams paused conversations with Beasley as well.\nSeveral teams have maintained contact with Beasley's representation during the past few weeks about his status, sources said.\nBeasley, who finished second in the 2024-25 Sixth Man of the Year race, averaged 16.3 points while appearing in all 82 games last season, his first season with Detroit over a nine-year NBA career. Beasley made 319 3-pointers, the most in a season in Pistons franchise history and the second most in the NBA that season, trailing Minnesota Timberwolves All-NBA star Anthony Edwards by one trey. Beasley also ranked second in total points and total made 3-pointers off the bench, and he made 248 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers, the most by any player in a season since player tracking began in 2013-14, according to GeniusIQ.\nBeasley signed a one-year contract with the Pistons in the 2024 offseason. As a result of Detroit signing Caris LeVert to the full midlevel exception, the maximum Beasley can re-sign with the Pistons for is $7.2 million, according to ESPN's Bobby Marks. In the absence of Beasley, Detroit signed LeVert, Duncan Robinson and Javonte Green to shore up its wing and guard corps.\nTeams that have an exception to sign Beasley to a contract greater than $7.2 million include the Chicago Bulls, Indiana Pacers, New Orleans Pelicans, Sacramento Kings and Washington Wizards. The Brooklyn Nets also have cap space of more than $20 million.\nDuring the 2023-24 season on which the allegations centered, Beasley averaged 11.3 points in 79 games for the Milwaukee Bucks and made a career-high 77 starts.\nAt least one prominent U.S. sportsbook detected unusually heavy betting interest on Beasley's statistics beginning around January 2024, a gambling industry source told ESPN's David Purdum. A gambling industry source pointed to a game between the Bucks and the Portland Trail Blazers on Jan. 31, 2024. The odds on Beasley recording fewer than 2.5 rebounds moved significantly at sportsbooks before the game, shortening from around +120 to around -250 due to a surge of action on the under. Beasley finished with six rebounds, and the bets that were deemed unusual lost.\nLast year, former Toronto Raptors forward Jontay Porter was banned by the NBA after a league investigation found Porter disclosed confidential information to sports bettors and wagered on games. Earlier this year, it was announced that Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier was under federal investigation for activity related to unusual betting patterns surrounding him in a March 2023 game when he was playing for the Charlotte Hornets. Rozier has not been charged with any crime, nor has he faced any sanction from the NBA, and his attorney, Jim Trusty, told Purdum that his client is not a target of the investigation.\nThe National Basketball Players Association reiterated Friday that there has been no evidence of more of an issue with gambling in the league outside Porter.\n\"NBA players compete at the highest level with the utmost integrity and are concerned that prop bets have become an increasingly alarming source of player harassment, both online and in person,\" an NBPA spokesperson said. \"If tighter regulations can help minimize that abuse, then we support taking a closer look at them.\"\nIn 2020, when Beasley played for the Timberwolves, he pleaded guilty to a felony charge of threats of violence and was sentenced to 120 days in jail, which he served after the 2020-21 season. He also was suspended for 12 games by the NBA in 2021 as a result of the guilty plea."

  "argos_summary": "Malik Beasley, a Detroit Pistons guard, is under federal investigation for alleged gambling on NBA games, which halted his talks for a three\u2011year, $42\u202fmillion contract that the Pistons had planned to use their non\u2011taxpayer mid\u2011level exception. The Pistons instead signed Caris LeVert, exhausting that exception and limiting Beasley to a maximum $7.2\u202fmillion one\u2011year deal under the team's non\u2011Bird rights. Other teams with available exceptions\u2014such as the Nets, Wizards, Bulls, and Kings\u2014could outbid Detroit, while Beasley\u2019s attorneys claim he is no longer a target of the investigation, potentially reopening free\u2011agency options. The situation leaves Beasley uncertain whether to re\u2011sign with Detroit for a lower salary or pursue offers from other franchises that can afford a higher pay\u2011grade.}",
