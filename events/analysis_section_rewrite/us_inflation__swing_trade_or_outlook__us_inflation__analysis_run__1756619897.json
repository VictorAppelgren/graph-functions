      "feedback": "Your draft mixes several assets and scenarios without a clear causal chain or handle mapping, and it repeats identical “Up/Down” lines that dilute the signal. Tighten the focus to **DXY** only, using the canonical handle `dxy`. Replace the 5‑line “Up/Down” block with exactly **four** concise scenario lines: two Up, two Down, each following the required format (Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %). Use the evidence from the source: Fed cut probability (86 % for 9/25), steepening 2‑yr/10‑yr spread (current 60 bp), tariff truce, and Ukrainian sentiment. Cite IDs inline (e.g., (Z7O1DCHS7)(XTQIQRP5K)(7XH2DKEKV)). Assign probabilities that reflect the stated likelihoods: e.g., 70 % for the 1‑3 mo upside, 60 % for the 3‑6 mo upside, 30 % for the 1‑3 mo downside, 20 % for the 3‑6 mo downside. Remove the two “Up” lines that simply list target levels (95.8, 96.5) and the two “Down” lines that duplicate the same logic; those are redundant and violate the 4‑line rule. After the scenario block, add a **Swing Trade Plan** line for DXY: Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence 0–100. For example, “Up | 1‑3 mo | Fed cut + tariff risk‑off | 95.8 | 95.2 | 96.5 | 1:1 | Fed cut or tariff rollback | 70 % | 80”. Ensure the entry, stop, and target are realistic (e.g., 95.8 ± 0.6 bp). Finally, delete any sentences that drift from DXY or lack a causal link; every line must reference a driver, a watch signal, and a probability with an ID citation. This will satisfy the acceptance gate and produce a concise, actionable swing‑trade outlook.",
