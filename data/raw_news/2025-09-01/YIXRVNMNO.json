  "description": "Apple\u2019s commitment to end-to-end encryption is so strong that it withdrew a key privacy feature from the UK market rather...",
  "content": "Apple\u2019s commitment to end-to-end encryption is so strong that it withdrew a key privacy feature from the UK market rather than be forced to compromise it globally. The company also faced pressure on this front from the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act (DSA).\n\nIn a surprising twist, the White House came out in support of strong encryption, and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is now urging Apple and other tech giants to stand firm on the issue \u2026\n\nI describe the most recent events as surprising as you may recall that Apple was previously involved in a long-running battle with the FBI over compromising the security of iPhones.\n\nIndeed, less than a year ago Trump came out in strong opposition to Apple, stating that the FBI must be allowed to force Apple to unlock access to the iPhones of suspects. This echoed earlier comments he made back in 2020. The FBI said in 2019 that end-to-end encryption (E2EE) \u201cinfects\u201d law enforcement.\n\nFast forward to this year, and suddenly the US government is opposed to iCloud backdoors. Trump even threatened to cancel a US-UK trade deal unless Britain backed down \u2013 which it recently did.\n\nIn addition to its battles in the UK, Apple was also facing pressure over strong encryption in the EU. The DSA requires tech giants to take steps to prevent the storage and transmission of child sexual abuse materials (CSAM), and some interpretations of this suggest that this would require backdoors into E2EE.\n\nWired reports that the US Antitrust Authority has asked Apple and others how they plan to address \u201cincorrect international regulatory requirements\u201d imposed by the DSA \u2013 specifically those which would require compromising E2EE. The FTC has now written to those same companies asking for assurances that they will not comply.\n\nIt says US tech giants who compromise E2EE may break US law on deceptive practices.\n\nFTC chairman Andrew Ferguson said he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to enforce the law.\n\nThis is, frankly, hilarious. The US has gone from threatening Apple if it didn\u2019t compromise strong encryption to now threatening it if it does \u2013 with Trump endorsing each of the conflicting stances.\n\nComical or not, the whole situation is good news for privacy, as it would now make it extremely embarrassing for the current administration, at least, to make a second U-turn and pose a threat to strong encryption.\n\u2022 Most of your iCloud data isn\u2019t fully protected \u2013 here\u2019s how to change that",

      "text": "We learned earlier this year that the British government had secretly ordered Apple to create a backdoor into encrypted data for all iCloud users worldwide. Specifically, it wanted a way to see personal data protected by Apple\u2019s introduction of Advanced Data Protection (ADP), which extended end-to-end encryption to almost all iCloud data, meaning not even the iPhone maker could access it.\nApple has been fighting the secret order in secret court hearings, but it now appears that the US government is using technology agreement negotiations to force Britain to back down \u2026\nThe secret demand for an iCloud backdoor\nAs we noted at the time, the British government\u2019s demand that Apple allow it access to all iCloud accounts globally was as technically clueless as it was outrageous.\nFirst, much of the data is protected by end-to-end encryption (E2EE). This means that Apple does not hold a copy of the key, and would be unable to decrypt it.\nSecond, even for the data Apple could supply, there are already legal mechanisms in place for law enforcement agencies to request it. They simply need to go to a judge to apply for a court order. The judge will weigh the interests of justice against those of privacy and make an individual determination based on the specific circumstances in that case. Where a judge agrees to issue a court order, Apple complies with these to the extent that it is able to do so.\nThird, the government tried to avoid public scrutiny of its demand by using legislation which did not permit Apple to reveal that it had received the demand, and the court case to argue about it would also be held in secret.\nApple\u2019s clever response\nApple came up with a clever response. While it could not directly reveal the British government\u2019s demand, it instead announced that it could no longer offer ADP in the UK.\n\u201cApple can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the United Kingdom to new users and current UK users will eventually need to disable this security feature. ADP protects iCloud data with end-to-end encryption, which means the data can only be decrypted by the user who owns it, and only on their trusted devices. We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK [\u2026] As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.\u201d\nThis message was crystal clear. Essentially \u201cwe cannot tell you that the British government ordered us to build a backdoor into ADP, nor that we refused.\u201d\nThe British government reportedly set to back down\nThe government had been insistent that it would not back down on its demand, but the Financial Times reports that the US government has found a way to pressure it into doing so \u2013 by threatening UK-US technology agreements.\n\u201cThis is something that the vice-president is very annoyed about and which needs to be resolved,\u201d said an official in the UK\u2019s technology department. \u201cThe Home Office is basically going to have to back down.\u201d\nTwo officials said the UK decision to force Apple to break its end-to-end encryption \u2014 which has been raised multiple times by top officials in Donald Trump\u2019s administration \u2014 could impede technology agreements with the US [\u2026]\nThe officials both said the Home Office [\u2026] would probably have to retreat in the face of pressure from senior leaders in Washington\nApple and both governments declined the FT\u2019s requests for comment.\nHighlighted accessories\n- Official Apple Store on Amazon\n- Anker 511 Nano Pro ultra-compact iPhone charger\n- Spigen MagFit case for iPhone 16e \u2013 adds MagSafe support\n- Apple MagSafe Charger with 25w power for iPhone 16 models\n- Apple 30W charger for above\n- Anker 240W braided USB-C to USB-C cable\nPhoto by Dima Pechurin on Unsplash\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "A senior FBI official who testified to Congress during its battle with Apple over access to a locked iPhone has said that end-to-end encryption \u2018infects\u2019 law enforcement.\nThe remark was made as Apple and other tech companies warn of the danger of compromising strong encryption after the Australian government passed a law which would require them to help access encrypted messages on demand \u2026\nThe WSJ quotes FBI executive assistant director Amy Hess.\nThe so-called going-dark issue, or the government\u2019s inability to access data as devices get more encoded and difficult to crack, \u201cis a problem [that] infects law enforcement and the intelligence community more and more so every day,\u201d said Amy Hess, executive assistant director with the FBI, in an interview. Ms. Hess, who previously oversaw the FBI\u2019s science and technology branch, testified to Congress on the problem during Apple\u2019s 2016 clash with the bureau.\nGovernments want access to user data to solve crimes and track potential threats. Silicon Valley companies, fearful that this access could be misused for spying or exploited by hackers, continue to build products that are so securely encrypted that the tech companies themselves are sometimes unable to access the data on them. And many tech companies are resisting any efforts to weaken their encryption capabilities.\nApple is one of nine companies to have told the Australian government that banning end-to-end encryption places its citizens at risk of having their personal data exposed.\nLast week, a coalition of civil society groups, trade associations and nine tech companies, including Facebook, Apple, Google, Twitter and Microsoft filed comments with the Australian government warning that the law, passed in December, could create back doors into technology products.\nThe law passed in Australia is vague, stating that tech companies must help the government gain access to encrypted messages, but without defining the scope of that assistance. In the case of end-to-end encrypted messages, it wouldn\u2019t be possible for the companies to help, as they would have no access to the encryption keys.\nApple said at the time that the \u2018broad and vague terms\u2019 of the law could be interpreted in many different ways, one of which would be a requirement to weaken encryption. There is also concern that the Australian law could set a precedent for the US.\nAustralia is part of the so-called Five Eyes intelligence network which last month issued statements declaring that \u2018privacy is not an absolute\u2018 and the use of end-to-end encryption \u2018should be rare.\u2019 All of the Five Eyes nations \u2013 Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the USA \u2013 have said they would seek access to encrypted emails, text messages and voice communications via new legislation, suggesting that Australia is being used as a test case.\nThis concern was echoed by a think tank.\n\u201cWhat happens here will ricochet everywhere,\u201d said Fergus Hanson, the head of the International Cyber Policy Centre at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\nThe British government has previous said that Apple \u2018cannot get away with\u2019 offering apps with end-to-end encryption. Both Messages and FaceTime are end-to-end encrypted.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.\nComments"

      "text": "The latest Apple/FBI war of words in the Pensacola case has once again highlighted the huge challenge Apple has in communicating the reality of the debate, in a world in which most people have no understanding of the core issue.\nTo a non-technical person, the debate appears to be a moral one. The FBI says that it needs access to data from terrorists and criminals, and Apple wants to prevent this. FBI, good; Apple, bad.\nTo anyone who understands the technology, the debate is very different \u2026\nThe debate is this:\nDo you want secure iPhones, which will sometimes mean that law enforcement agencies cannot access all the data they want (but will usually be able to access most of it)? Or do you want iPhones to contain a deliberate insecurity which would allow them to be accessed by the FBI \u2013 but which will inevitably be discovered and used by criminals and foreign states?\nIn simpler terms, do you want your iPhone to be secure or not?\nThat is the entire Apple/FBI debate.\nHow can Apple successfully communicate the reality of the debate in terms anyone can understand? Just as I did for the Apple/Google contact tracing API, here is my attempt at it.\nApple already helps the FBI\nEvery time the FBI has a court order allowing it to access personal data belonging to a suspected terrorist or criminal, Apple offers all of the assistance it can.\nIt will hand over a copy of the iCloud backup of the iPhone. This doesn\u2019t contain all of the data stored on the phone, but it does have most of it \u2013 including the Notes that enabled the FBI to link the Pensacola shooter to Al-Qaeda (top photo).\nApple will also provide account information, transactional data, and so on. In short, Apple will \u2013 when given legal authority \u2013 hand over all of the information it possesses about an iPhone and its owner.\nFor most iPhones, the FBI doesn\u2019t need Apple\u2019s help\nThe FBI can break into most iPhones without Apple\u2019s help.\nApple is engaged in a constant game of cat-and-mouse with hackers \u2013 some of them state entities operating with essentially unlimited resources. The hackers try to find vulnerabilities in iOS, and Apple tries to block them.\nKeeping pace requires Apple to regularly update iOS with new security patches. Sometimes hardware vulnerabilities are discovered, which means that hackers can get access even when the iPhones are running the latest version of iOS. At any given moment, there will be vulnerabilities Apple doesn\u2019t yet know about and so can\u2019t yet fix.\nMost of the vulnerabilities discovered are sold to companies like Zerodium, which will, in turn, make them available to anyone who wants to pay for them. Including the FBI.\nThis was true in both high-profile cases\nThere have been two high-profile cases in which the FBI has demanded Apple\u2019s assistance cracking an iPhone belonging to a suspected terrorist: San Bernardino and Pensacola.\nIn both cases, Apple handed over all of the data it had. And in both cases, the FBI was able to use commercial services to crack the phones to get the rest of the data.\nApple cannot just unlock phones for the FBI\nThere is no magic way to unlock an iPhone. The safeguards Apple builds into iOS are designed to stop anyone unlocking an iPhone without the owner\u2019s permission. Apple is no more able to unlock your iPhone than I am.\nWhy not provide a backdoor?\nIt is impossible to provide a backdoor that can be used only by the good guys. Any weakness Apple builds into iOS for use by the FBI will inevitably be discovered by others, and used by the bad guys.\nAn iPhone can be secure against everyone, or secure against no-one; there is no in-between option here.\nApple/FBI debate in summary\nYour iPhone can be secure, or insecure. The FBI wants it to be insecure. Apple wants it to be secure. What do you want?\nThat, then, is my attempt to explain the debate in terms normal people can understand. Perhaps you could test it on some of your non-technical friends and let me know whether it does the job?\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.\nComments"

      "text": "Trouble is brewing for the Digital Services Act (DSA), the landmark European law governing big tech platforms. On August 21, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), sent a scathing letter to a number of tech giants, including Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple. The letter's subject: the European Digital Services Act cannot be applied if it jeopardizes freedom of expression and, above all, the safety of US citizens.\nThe opening of the letter\u2014signed by FTC chairman Andrew Ferguson\u2014features a prominent reference to the First Amendment of the US Constitution, namely freedom of speech: \u201cOnline platforms have become central to public debate, and the pervasive online censorship in recent years has outraged the American people. Not only have Americans been censored and banned from platforms for expressing opinions and beliefs not shared by a small Silicon Valley elite, but the previous administration actively worked to encourage such censorship.\u201d\nThe Trump Administration's Lunge\nThe Trump administration intends to reverse course, and it is in this direction that the attack on \"foreign powers,\" the European Union and in the United Kingdom, and in particular on the Digital Services Act and the Online Safety Act, begins. The letter also indirectly references GDPR, the European regulation on the protection of personal data, whose measures are \"aimed at imposing censorship and weakening end-to-end encryption\" with the result of a weakening of Americans' freedoms, according to the letter.\nPrivacy and End-to-End Encryption: The Issues on the Table\nIn the letter, the US Antitrust Authority specifically asked the 13 companies to report \"how they intend to comply with incorrect international regulatory requirements\" (the deadline for scheduling a meeting was set for August 28) and recalled their \"obligations towards American consumers under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" that could distort the market or compromise safety.\nAnd it is precisely on the security front, and especially on the adoption of end-to-end encryption, that the FTC calls big tech companies to order: \"Companies that promise that their service is secure or encrypted, but fail to use end-to-end encryption where appropriate, may deceive consumers who reasonably expect this level of privacy.\" Furthermore, \"certain circumstances may require the use of end-to-end encryption, and failure to implement such measures may constitute an unfair practice.\" The weakening of encryption or other security measures to comply with laws or requests from a foreign government may therefore violate Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the document states.\nWhat Happens in Case of Disputes and Interference\nIn a tweet on X, Ferguson wrote flatly that \"if companies censor Americans or weaken privacy and communications security at the request of a foreign power, I will not hesitate to enforce the law.\"\n\"In a global society like the one we live in, overlaps and interferences between different legal systems are natural. Just think of those, in the opposite direction, between European privacy legislation and the famous American Cloud Act,\" Guido Scorza, a member of the Italian Data Protection Authority, told WIRED. Scorza believes that in the event of significant discrepancies, \u201cit will be up to the US government and the European Commission to identify corrective measures capable of guaranteeing the sovereignty, including digital, of each country.\u201d\nThis article originally appeared on Wired Italy and has been translated from Italian."

      "text": "Apple\u2019s Advanced Data Protection (ADP) is a privacy feature very few people have been using. Non-techies had never heard of it, and even some geeks hadn\u2019t enabled it.\nSo Apple standing up to the UK government\u2019s attack on ADP might not seem a big deal \u2013 but I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s way more important than it might seem, for three reasons \u2026\nThe British government\u2019s worldwide attack on ADP\nWe previously outlined what ADP is, and why it matters, but the executive summary is that it extends end-to-end encryption to almost all your iCloud data. That means that Apple has no access, and therefore cannot grant access to any government agencies who come knocking on its door.\nADP was introduced in 2022, and it\u2019s fair to say that it didn\u2019t make much of a splash. It remains off by default, so about the only people who enabled it were security-conscious geeks. Until now.\nApple effectively revealed a secret order\nThe repressive legislation used states that companies that receive one of these orders cannot reveal this fact. The idea is that tech companies can be forced to expose their customers\u2019 personal data without being able to warn them of this fact.\nIt would have been illegal for Apple to tell the world that it has been ordered to create backdoor access to ADP. What the company cleverly did instead was announce that it was withdrawing ADP from the UK, without explaining its reason.\n\u201cApple can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the United Kingdom to new users and current UK users will eventually need to disable this security feature. ADP protects iCloud data with end-to-end encryption, which means the data can only be decrypted by the user who owns it, and only on their trusted devices. We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK [\u2026] As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.\u201d\nThis message was crystal clear. Essentially \u201cwe cannot tell you that the British government ordered us to build a backdoor into ADP, nor that we refused.\u201d\nAdditionally, we now know that Apple has appealed the secret order it\u2019s not allowed to tell us about.\nThe iPhone maker has made its appeal to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, an independent judicial body that examines complaints against the UK security services, according to people familiar with the matter.\nIt\u2019s of course not Apple who leaked information only Apple would have because that would be illegal.\nApple has made a niche feature headline news\nThe UK and US are two members of a key international intelligence alliance known as the Five Eyes. This is the agency which told the tech industry back in 2018 that \u201cprivacy is not absolute\u201d and end-to-end encryption \u201cshould be rare.\u201d These are countries who keep each other\u2019s secrets.\nBut because the British government over-reached by demanding access not just to accounts owned by its own citizens, but by iCloud users worldwide, and because Apple effectively revealed the secret order without revealing the secret order, that led the US government to speak up \u2013 and to do so publicly.\nTrump\u2019s Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard wrote in a letter responding to Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona that she was not made aware of the UK\u2019s secret demand by her UK counterparts. However, she suggested, the UK government may have broken a bilateral privacy and surveillance agreement in making the demand.\nA combination of the British government\u2019s stupidity and Apple\u2019s strong stance means that what was previously a niche featured used by a tiny proportion of iCloud users is now headline news.\nThat\u2019s important for three reasons\nFirst, the saga has dramatically increased public awareness of end-to-end encryption in general, and Advanced Data Protection in particular.\nSecond, governments around the world now know that this type of secret order \u2013 even with gagging clauses \u2013 won\u2019t protect them from public disclosure, because Apple can be counted on to make the matter very public.\nThird, it\u2019s put the US government in a very awkward position if it too wanted to issue one of these secret orders under similar legislation of its own. It not only knows that Apple would tell us about the order without telling us about the order, but that it would be attacked for hypocrisy after criticizing the British government\u2019s action.\nApple isn\u2019t just standing up to the UK government, it\u2019s standing up to all governments worldwide who might like to follow the British example.\nHighlighted accessories\n- Anker 511 Nano Pro ultra-compact iPhone charger\n- Spigen MagFit case for iPhone 16e \u2013 adds MagSafe support\n- Apple MagSafe Charger with 25w power for iPhone 16 models\n- Apple 30W charger for above\n- Anker 240W braided USB-C to USB-C cable\nPhoto by Peter Forster on Unsplash\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "CSAM\nApple\u2019s efforts to detect Child Sexual Abuse Materials (CSAM).\nTable of contents\nWhat is CSAM?\nWhile US federal law uses the term child pornography, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) explains why the term CSAM is preferred.\nNCMEC chooses to refer to these images as Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) to most accurately reflect what is depicted \u2013 the sexual abuse and exploitation of children. Not only do these images and videos document victims\u2019 exploitation and abuse, but when these files are shared across the internet, child victims suffer re-victimization each time the image of their sexual abuse is viewed [\u2026]\nWhile CSAM is seen and transmitted on computers and through other technology, these images and videos depict actual crimes being committed against children. The human element, children at risk, must always be considered when talking about this offense that is based in a high-tech world.\nHow is it usually detected?\nThe usual way to detect CSAM is when cloud services like Google Photos scan uploaded photos and compare them against a database of known CSAM images. This database is provided by NCMEC and similar organizations around the world.\nThe actual matching process uses what\u2019s known as a hash, or digital fingerprint. This is derived from key elements of the image, and is deliberately fuzzy so that it will continue to work when images are resized, cropped, or otherwise processed. This means there will sometimes be false positives: an innocent image whose hash happens to be a close enough match to a CSAM one.\nHow is Apple detecting CSAM?\nApple made an announcement in early August 2021 about its own plans to begin scanning for CSAM.\nApple has chosen to take a somewhat different approach, which it says better protects privacy. This process is:\n- Apple downloads the CSAM database hashes to your iPhone\n- An on-device process looks for matches with hashes of your photos\n- If fewer than 30* are found, no action is taken\n- If 30+ matches are found, low-resolutions of your photos are manually examined by Apple\n- If the photos are found to be innocent, no further action is taken\n- If manual review confirms them as CSAM, law enforcement is informed\n*Apple initially said only that there was a threshold of matching images, without revealing what it was, but Craig Federighi implied in an interview that this is 30 images.\nWhat concerns have been raised?\nConcerns have been raised by cybersecurity experts, human rights organizations, governments, and Apple\u2019s own employees. Four main concerns have been raised, explained here:\n- Accidental false positives could ruin someone\u2019s reputation\n- Deliberate false positives (aka collision attacks) could be created to achieve the same goal\n- Authoritarian governments could add political posters and similar to the database\n- The same hash-based on-device searches could be later applied to iMessage\nAdditionally, because Apple simultaneously announced an entirely separate feature designed to detect nude photos in iMessages sent or received by children, many non-technical people conflated the two, thinking Apple was scanning our photos for nudes.\nHow has Apple responded?\nApple engaged in a flurry of rapid-fire PR activity designed to correct misapprehensions and address genuine concerns. This included a leaked internal memo, a series of background briefings, interviews, and a six-page FAQ.\nApple said that images were only scanned if they were synched with iCloud, so customers could opt out if they wished. It added that the risk of either accidental or deliberate false positives was statistically insignificant, as it required multiple matches before an account was flagged. Even then, an Apple employee would review images before any report to law enforcement.\nThe company said it would roll out the feature on a country-by-country basis, and would refuse any government demand to add political images to the database \u2013 a promise it cannot realistically make.\nSince then, things have gone complete quiet, with no sign of any move by Apple to actually launch CSAM scanning.\nWhy has this proven so controversial?\nGoogle, Amazon, Facebook and many other tech giants already routinely scan for CSAM and report instances to law enforcement. Apple is merely joining in, and trying to use a more privacy-focused approach, by performing the actual comparison on-device. So why so much controversy?\nIn part, for the reason explained earlier: Apple\u2019s mistake in simultaneously announcing two different features.\nBut the outrage was entirely predictable, given the years Apple has spent touting its privacy credentials.\nThe company has put up huge billboards. It has run amusing ads. It has an entire privacy microsite. Its CEO talks about privacy in every interview and public appearance. The company attacks other tech giants over privacy. It fought the entire ad industry over a new privacy feature.\nAny risk that customer privacy will be compromised, however small the likelihood, and however well-intentioned the reason, was bound to raise eyebrows.\nApple may not be able to keep its head down much longer, however, as a UK CSAM law could force the issue."

Follow along with all our coverage related to privacy, security, what Apple and other companies are doing to keep your information safe, and what steps you can take to keep your information private.\nApple\u2019s commitment to end-to-end encryption is so strong that it withdrew a key privacy feature from the UK market rather than be forced to compromise it globally. The company also faced pressure on this front from the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act (DSA).\nIn a surprising twist, the White House came out in support of strong encryption, and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is now urging Apple and other tech giants to stand firm on the issue \u2026\n9to5Mac Security Bite is exclusively brought to you by Mosyle, the only Apple Unified Platform.Making Apple devices work-ready and enterprise-safe is all we do.

What\u2019s most alarming is that these videos have millions of views, and metrics show that over a hundred thousand have been sold.\nI usually reserve Security Bite for digital security topics, but this discovery was too riveting to ignore. As first reported by 404 Media, the trackers are being compared to Apple AirTags\u2014but for the wrong reasons\u2026\nEarlier today, the Russian government announced a new rule requiring all phones and tablets to ship with MAX, its state-backed messenger app, preinstalled. Here are the details.\nA former Meta product manager has claimed that the social network circumvented Apple\u2019s privacy protections, as well as cheating advertisers, and fired him when he repeatedly raised the issue internally.\nMeta is said to have found ways to identify Apple users even after they refused consent for app tracking, in order to avoid an estimated $10 billion loss of revenue \u2026\nThe US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) carried out a record number of phone searches of travelers arriving at, or returning to, the US in the last quarter.\nThe legal position on these searches is unclear when it comes to US citizens, but there are steps you can take to protect your privacy \u2026\nThe UK has retreated from a controversial order that would have forced Apple to provide a backdoor to American users\u2019 data, according to a statement from US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Here are the details.\nIf you were holding a competition for the scummiest business model, then data brokers would be very high up the list. These companies make money by buying personal data from app and website owners and selling it to companies who want to spam us.\nA US Senator has now drawn attention to the latest sketchy practice by these companies: making it harder for us to opt out by hiding that option from search results \u2026\n9to5Mac is brought to you by Incogni:Protect your personal info from prying eyes.

This has been called into question over scam apps accepted into the App Store, and the same questions are being asked regarding the Tea app.\nThe so-called dating advice app has been revealed to have major security vulnerabilities, which have exposed private chats and personal data of tens of thousands of women \u2026\nIntroduced for Private Browsing sessions in Safari 17.0, Advanced Fingerprinting Protection was also optionally available for regular non-private sessions. With iOS 26, it will be enabled by default. Here\u2019s what that means.\nTwo major security vulnerabilities in the Tea app \u2013 which claims to make dating safer for women \u2013 have exposed the private chats and personal data of at least tens of thousands of users.\nThe app, designed to allow women to share \u201cred flags\u201d for men they had dated, claimed four million active users after it hit the top slot in the App Store last week \u2026\n9to5Mac is brought to you by Incogni:Protect your personal info from prying eyes.

Additionally, the US has recently revived a bill very similar to the British legislation.\nWhile the law was presented as a way to prevent children accessing adult websites, the reality is very different, and we\u2019re already seeing the privacy risks of good intentions being turned into bad legislation \u2013 with iMessage and FaceTime in the firing line \u2026\n9to5Mac Security Bite is exclusively brought to you by Mosyle, the only Apple Unified Platform.Making Apple devices work-ready and enterprise-safe is all we do.

Unfortunately, macOS Preview doesn\u2019t support file-level password protection, but there are quick workarounds that don\u2019t require third-party software or downloading anything not already on your Mac.\nAmazon has confirmed it\u2019s in the process of buying Bee, an Apple Watch app and wearable that records everything it hears.\nThe platform describes itself as \u201ca personal Al that transforms your conversations, tasks, places and more into summaries, personal insights and timely reminders\u201d \u2026\nThe company behind encrypted email service Proton Mail has today launched a new freemium AI chatbot which promises that your chats will remain completely private.\nProton Lumo offers five protections it says aren\u2019t matched by any of the existing mainstream AI services like ChatGPT and Gemini, and has even thrown shade at Apple Intelligence privacy \u2026\nMore than 10,000 organizations around the world are at risk from hackers after a serious security flaw was discovered in Microsoft\u2019s popular Sharepoint platform, used to store and share confidential documents. The majority of companies at risk are said to be in the US.\nUpdate: Bloomberg reports that the National Nuclear Security Administration was among the organizations breached \u2013 see the end of the piece \u2026\nApple has been fighting the secret order in secret court hearings, but it now appears that the US government is using technology agreement negotiations to force Britain to back down \u2026\nA new report suggests that many people who belong to Gen Z use Find My and other apps to permanently share their location with groups of friends.\nA study earlier in the year found that 40% of Gen Z adults share their location with three or more people, and a new piece found it was common to location-share with double digit numbers of friends \u2026\nThe United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is seeking pitches from tech companies for a forensic tool intended to find \u201chidden language\u201d in messages on smartphones searched at the border \u2026\nA Qantas data breach resulting from a cybersecurity attack has put up to 6M customer records at risk of exposure, with names, email addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth confirmed to be included.

But if you\u2019re in the European Union, there\u2019s now an important update: the rollout won\u2019t be happening for you\u2026 yet."

This time, comments by former president Donald Trump at a Wednesday rally have brought the issue back to the front of public discussion, as he put responsibility on Apple to aid the investigation.\nTrump\u2019s rally comments place responsibility on Apple\nSeveral outlets reported Wednesday that Trump made comments at a North Carolina rally calling on the FBI to pressure Apple into unlocking his attempted assassins\u2019 apps and phones:\n\u201cThey must get Apple to open the foreign apps, and they must get Apple to likewise open the six phones from the second lunatic.\u201d\nTrump is referring to phones confiscated by the FBI from both of his would-be assassins.\nStephanie Lai explains at Bloomberg:\nThe former president said that the FBI had been unable to access \u201cthree potentially foreign-based apps\u201d on the phone of Thomas Matthew Crooks, the Pennsylvania man who shot at and grazed Trump\u2019s ear during a rally in July.\nTrump also said that alleged would-be assassin Ryan Wesley Routh, who was captured after a shootout with US Secret Service at Trump\u2019s Florida golf club, had six cell phones that the FBI had \u201clikewise been unable to penetrate.\u201d\nThe FBI has not shared any further details in this case. Previously, reported indicated that Crooks\u2019 phone was a Samsung, however. And as far as I am aware, there has not been official comment on whether Routh\u2019s devices are iPhones or not. But per Trump\u2019s comments, it seems that they might be.\nIt is unclear what Apple could do to help open apps on a Samsung phone, or if perhaps the initial reporting on the device\u2019s identity was incorrect. In any case, Trump\u2019s calls for Apple\u2019s involvement could lead to another public controversy involving the FBI.\nContext that led to this moment\nBack in July, the FBI announced they had successfully gained access to Crooks\u2019 phone. But per Trump\u2019s remarks, it seems certain encrypted apps may be the issue, not the phone\u2019s OS itself. It is unclear whether Routh\u2019s six devices are presenting the same challenge, but it sounds as though they haven\u2019t been accessed at all yet.\nBecause details are so few at this point, reporting has been a bit scattered. Generally, it is believed that encrypted messaging apps were involved in the FBI\u2019s investigation. And some reporting mentions encrypted foreign accounts, too.\nApple, for its part, has historically held firm that it cannot build tools to access locked iPhones or encrypted data without compromising the privacy and security of its entire user base.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "The UK has retreated from a controversial order that would have forced Apple to provide a backdoor to American users\u2019 data, according to a statement from US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Here are the details.\nIn a post on X, Gabbard said the decision came after months of work with President Trump and Vice President Vance \u201cto ensure Americans\u2019 private data remains private.\u201d She said that, as a result, the UK has agreed to drop the mandate.\nAs reported by Reuters, \u201cBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer was in Washington on Monday along with other European leaders to meet Trump and discuss Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine,\u201d so it is possible this issue may also have been discussed.\nA bit of context\nBack in January, as first reported by The Washington Post, UK authorities confidentially issued a so-called technical capability notice under the country\u2019s Investigatory Powers Act, a law that gives the government sweeping powers to compel tech companies to weaken encryption.\nThe order would have required Apple to turn off Advanced Data Protection for iCloud (ADP) for US users, so that UK agencies could access cloud backups, voice memos, and other encrypted content.\nIn response to the mandate, Apple removed iCloud end-to-end encryption features from the UK, and in a statement provided to 9to5Mac at the time, the company said the following:\n\u201cApple can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the United Kingdom to new users and current UK users will eventually need to disable this security feature. ADP protects iCloud data with end-to-end encryption, which means the data can only be decrypted by the user who owns it, and only on their trusted devices. We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy. Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end encryption is more urgent than ever before. Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom. As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.\u201d\nWhile the mandate has been dropped, marking a win for Apple and for privacy more broadly, there is no word at this time on when, or even if, ADP will be restored in the UK, as there is no word yet on how this relates to other users worldwide.\nLimited time Mac deals on Amazon\n- Mac mini (M4) 16GB/256GB: $499 (17% off)\n- MacBook Air, 15-inch, M4, 16GB/256GB: $999 (was $1,199)\n- MacBook Pro, 14-inch, M4, 16GB/512GB: $1,299 (19% off)\n- Studio Display, Nano-Texture Glass, VESA Mount Adapter: $1,649 (13% off)\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "US President Donald Trump has again demanded that Apple compromise the security of iOS to unlock iPhones seized in criminal cases, saying that the company \u201cholds the keys to many criminal minds.\u201d His attack on Apple\u2019s privacy measures were made in an interview with CNBC.\n\u2018Frankly I\u2019ve helped them a lot. I\u2019ve given them waivers, because it\u2019s a great company, but it made a big difference,\u2019 Trump told Squawk Box co-host Joe Kernen, referring to tariff waivers in US-China trade war.\n\u2018They could have given us that information. It would have been very helpful. Apple has to help us. And I\u2019m very strong on it. They have the keys to so many criminals and criminal minds\u2019 \u2026\nWe recently learned that the FBI was able to unlock an iPhone 11 Pro using GrayKey, and Trump\u2019s demand comes on the day we\u2019re learning that the agency was able to unlock another iPhone 11 using Cellebrite kit.\nTrump\u2019s comment is ironic given that Bloomberg reports the phone in question contained data that a congressional committee wanted as part of the impeachment proceedings against the president.\nIt took the Federal Bureau of Investigation about two months to unlock the Apple iPhone 11 that was seized from Lev Parnas, the indicted associate of Rudy Giuliani [\u2026]\nThe lawyer, Joseph Bondy, told the judge last month that he would turn over the iPhone data and other documents subpoenaed by the House committee investigating President Donald Trump. Parnas is a Ukrainian-born US citizen who\u2019s charged with illegally funneling foreign money into US elections. He has pleaded not guilty and is out on bail.\nParnas had been working with Giuliani to dig up political dirt in Ukraine on Hunter Biden and his father, former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s top Democratic rival in next year\u2019s presidential election. Trump\u2019s demand on a July phone call with Ukraine\u2019s leader to announce an investigation into the Bidens prompted the impeachment inquiry in the US.\nThe length of time needed to crack the iPhone 11 is likely because it\u2019s better protected than older phones, though it\u2019s that possible that Parnas used a longer alphanumeric passcode that would slow a brute-force attack.\nIn the case of the Pensacola shooting, however, the phones are much older ones that can be trivially cracked. An unpatchable exploit known as checkm8 allows any iPhone from the 4s to the iPhone X to be jailbroken, even devices running iOS 13, which makes attacking them far easier. The Pensacola devices are an iPhone 5 and an iPhone 7.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.\nComments"

With Incogni, you can scrub your deeply sensitive information from data brokers across the web, including people search sites. Incogni limits your phone number, address, email, SSN, and more from circulating. Fight back against unwanted data brokers with a 30-day money back guarantee.\nApple uses two different forms of encryption for your iCloud data \u2013 a strong form for particularly sensitive data like the Health and Journal apps, but a weaker one for a lot of other data you still wouldn\u2019t want falling into the wrong hands.\nFortunately the company gives you the option of switching to strong encryption for all your iCloud data, and while there are a few steps involved, it\u2019s a worthwhile security and privacy safeguard \u2026\nWhat\u2019s the deal with iCloud encryption?\nThere are two main approaches to encrypting data:\n- Encryption at rest (aka \u2018weak encryption\u2019)\n- End-to-end encryption (aka E2EE or \u2018strong encryption\u2019)\nBy default, Apple uses a mix of the two, as you can see below.\nThe difference between them is simple, and concerns who holds a key with the ability to decrypt the data. For iCloud data:\n- Weak encryption: Your devices + Apple\n- Strong encryption: Your devices only\nWhich data is fully protected?\nBy default, Apple uses strong encryption for the things on the left, but weak encryption for the things on the right:\n| Strong encryption | Weak encryption |\n|---|---|\n| Passwords and Keychain | iCloud Backups (Device and Messages) |\n| Health data | iCloud Drive |\n| Journal data | Photos |\n| Home data | Notes |\n| Messages in iCloud | Reminders |\n| Payment information | Safari Bookmarks |\n| Apple Card transactions | Siri Shortcuts |\n| Maps | Voice Memo |\n| QuickType Keyboard learned vocabulary | Wallet Passes |\n| Safari | Freeform |\n| Screen Time | |\n| Siri information | |\n| Wi-Fi passwords | |\n| W1 and H1 Bluetooth keys | |\n| Memoji |\nThat leaves a lot of sensitive data not fully protected, with three particular examples jumping out: photos, notes, and backups of your messages.\nWhy should you care?\nYou might trust Apple, and therefore think it\u2019s not a big deal if the company also holds a key.\nHowever, Apple having a key creates two risks. First, if a hacker ever gained access to iCloud servers and encryption keys, they would then be able to access your data.\nSecond, law enforcement can get court orders demanding that Apple hand over data, and you may well be caught up in an investigation despite being completely uninvolved. For example, investigators might demand your data because you were identified as being in the same location as a suspect at the same time.\nFor both reasons, you may well feel it\u2019s best to apply strong encryption to all your iCloud data. Apple allows you to do so by enabling a feature called Advanced Data Protection (ADP). Note that you cannot currently enable this in the UK because we have a technically illiterate government, but it looks likely this will soon change.\nAre there any downsides to boosting security?\nYes: with strong encryption, Apple can no longer access your data, and therefore cannot help you recover it. For example, currently if you forget your iCloud password, and can prove your identity to Apple\u2019s satisfaction, the company may be able to help you recover some of your data. With ADP enabled, Apple would have no way to help.\nFor this reason, Apple does require you to take a couple of precautions:\n- Create an account recovery key (which acts like a backup password)\n- Add a recovery contact (someone you trust who can help you regain access)\nHow do you enable Advanced Data Protection?\nI recommend checking out our very detailed instructions and video guide. But the short version is this:\nAdd a recovery key\n- Settings \u2192 <your name> \u2192 Password & Security \u2192 Recovery Key\n- Recovery Key \u2192 Turn On Recovery Key \u2192 Use Recovery Key\n- Enter your passcode when prompted\n- Make a note of the 28-character recovery key\n- Enter this (to prove that you noted it correctly)\nSince a recovery key is intended for use when you\u2019ve lost access to all your Apple devices, you\u2019re advised to go low-tech with this: write it down and stick it in a safe.\nAdd a recovery contact\nYour recovery contact won\u2019t be able to access your data (unless they have physical access to your devices), but will be able to generate another recovery key. They will need to own at least one Apple device.\n- Settings \u2192 <your name> \u2192 Sign-In & Security \u2192 Recovery Contacts\n- Tap Add Recovery Contact\nEnable ADP\n- Settings \u2192 <Your Name> \u2192 iCloud\n- Scroll down and tap the Advanced Data Protection panel\n- Tap Turn on Advanced Data Protection\n- Tap Review Recovery Methods\n- Tap Contacts Up to Date to confirm your recovery contact is correct\n- Enter your recovery key to confirm you have access to this\n- Enter your device passcode\n- Tap Done when you see confirmation that ADP is enabled\nIt\u2019s a slightly convoluted process, but that\u2019s for good reason: Apple wants to ensure you know what you are doing and will be able to recover your own data if you ever forget your iCloud password.\n9to5Mac is brought to you by Incogni: Protect your personal info from prying eyes.

      "text": "AAPL Company\nBreaking news from Cupertino. We\u2019ll give you the latest from Apple headquarters and decipher fact from fiction from the rumor mill.\nAAPL is a California-based computer company that became the most successful smartphone company in the world.\nTable of contents\nAAPL defined by Apple\nHere\u2019s how Apple defines itself:\nApple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Apple\u2019s five software platforms \u2014 iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS \u2014 provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud. Apple\u2019s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.\nKey AAPL history\nFrom Apple I to iMac\nApple was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs (Steve), Steve Wozniak (Woz), and (briefly) Ronald Wayne as a business partnership: Apple Computer Company. The following year it became Apple Computer, Inc. The company\u2019s first product was the Apple I, a personal computer hand-built by Woz and sold in part-completed kit form. The Apple II and Apple III followed.\nThe modern Apple as we know it today began in 1983, with the launch of the first personal computer with a graphical user interface, the Lisa. Way too expensive to succeed, it was replaced by the Macintosh in 1984, launched with the single showing of a Ridley Scott commercial during the Super Bowl. The Macintosh transformed the world\u2019s understanding of what a computer was, and would eventually lead to Microsoft adopting the GUI approach.\nSteve Jobs and then Apple-CEO John Scully fell out in 1985, when Steve wanted to focus on the Macintosh while Scully wanted to put more attention on the Apple II, which was still selling well. That led to Steve being forced out of the company and going off to form NeXT.\nApple focused on selling Macintosh models at the highest possible margins, but would eventually fall foul of a mix of unsustainable pricing in the face of competition from Windows machines, and an overly complex product lineup. By 1996, the company was in trouble, and in 1997 Steve was brought back, along with the NeXT operating system, which would eventually form the basis of Mac OS X.\nSteve simplified the Mac lineup and had industrial designer Jony Ive work on a whole new look for a consumer desktop Mac, the colorful iMac. The iMac, like the original Macintosh, again changed the world\u2019s understanding of what a computer was, and who should want one.\nFrom Apple Computer, Inc. to Apple, Inc.\nIn 2001, Apple launched the iPod. Although this wasn\u2019t the first mp3 player, it was massively better than anything on the market at the time, and succeeded in turning a geeky piece of technology into a consumer electronics product with mass-market appeal.\nThe success of the iPod paved the way into other mobile devices. Apple was working on what would eventually become the iPad, when Steve realized that this was the basis of a smartphone. He diverted the team\u2019s work into this, to launch the iPhone in 2007. The iPad launched later, in 2010.\nThe iPhone was yet another transformational product. While most other smartphones of the time were clunky devices with a keyboard and stylus, the iPhone was a sleek-looking device operated with a finger, and so simple that no user guide was needed. It was with the launch of the iPhone that Apple Computer, Inc. was renamed to Apple, Inc.\nFrom Intel to Apple Silicon\nWhile the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and more are made with Apple-designed processors, the Mac lineup has historically relied on third-party companies for its CPUs. Over the years, Macs progressed from Motorola 680000 series chips through PowerPC to Intel.\nIn 2020, Apple began a two-year transition to the final stage in that journey, with Macs too finally getting Apple-designed chips. The first such is the M1 chip, used in the latest Mac mini, MacBook Air, and 13-inch MacBook Pro. Other Apple Silicon Macs followed.\nAAPL today\nApple is one of the largest companies in the world. It was the first publicly traded company to hit a trillion-dollar valuation in 2018, $2 trillion in 2020, and $3T in 2022.\nThe company\u2019s product lineup includes five different Mac families (MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, Mac Pro, and Mac mini); four iPad ranges (iPad mini, iPad, iPad Air, iPad Pro); four iPhone 12 models (12, 12 mini, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max); three main Apple Watch models (SE, Series 3, Series 6); as well as other products, including Apple TV, AirPods, and HomePod mini.\nIn addition to hardware sales, Apple derives a growing proportion of its income from Services, including the App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple Pay."

  "argos_summary": "Apple has withdrawn its Advanced Data Protection feature in the UK to avoid a government\u2011mandated backdoor, while facing pressure from the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act to weaken end\u2011to\u2011end encryption. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has now urged tech giants to maintain strong encryption, and the White House has publicly backed this stance, marking a reversal from earlier administrations that demanded backdoors. This policy shift signals a tightening of privacy protections that could influence investor sentiment in technology equities and affect regulatory risk premiums in the broader market.",
