      "summary": "The article compares thermal conductivities of metals used in computer heatsinks, noting that copper (≈400 W/mK) and aluminum (≈205 W/mK) dominate the market because of their balance of cost, weight, and durability. It highlights silver (≈430 W/mK) as a superior conductor but too expensive for mass production, and mentions diamond, graphene, and graphite as high‑conductivity materials that are impractical or costly for large‑scale heatsink manufacturing. The choice of material ultimately hinges on trade‑offs between thermal performance, weight, durability, and price.",
