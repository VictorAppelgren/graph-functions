      "feedback": "**Feedback & Action Items**\n\n1. **Canonical Handle Mapping** – The draft talks about “30‑year fixed mortgage rates” but never links to a canonical handle. Add a clear mapping, e.g. `ust10y` (or `ust2y` if you want a short‑term proxy) and state the sign/magnitude:  \n   *“US 30‑year mortgage rates are currently ≈ + 0.5 % above the 10‑yr UST yield (≈ 6.9–7.1 %)”* (↦ ID LF0UUL917).  \n   This satisfies the acceptance gate.\n\n2. **Explicit Catalyst Window** – Include a dated window for each catalyst. For example:  \n   *“Fed policy reversal (Fed meeting July 2025) → ↑ mortgage spread”*  \n   *“CPI release August 2025 → ↑ inflation expectations”*  \n   *“Mortgage originations drop September 2025 → ↑ liquidity premium”*  \n   Each should be bracketed with a short‑term horizon (e.g., 1–3 months).\n\n3. **Citations** – Every substantive claim must be tagged with the source ID. Add inline citations after each key point:  \n   *“The spread has stabilized around 5 bps in the last two quarters (LF0UUL917).”*  \n   Ensure no claim is left uncited.\n\n4. **Naming Convention** – If this is to become a topic, rename it to a canonical form, e.g. `us_mortgage_rates`. Keep the name in lowercase, no underscores, and avoid mixed territories.\n\n5. **First‑Principles Anchor** – Explicitly state the invariant anchor:  \n   *“Real‑rate differential = Fed‑funds rate – 10‑yr UST yield (≈ 5 bps).”*  \n   Then show how this drives the mortgage spread via term premium and liquidity.\n\n6. **Risk & Watch List** – Keep the risk list concise and tied to the handle:  \n   *“Risk 1: Fed rate hike (July 2025) → + 0.3 % spread.”*  \n   *“Watch: Fed minutes, CPI, Treasury curve, mortgage origination volume.”*  \n   Add a confidence rating (e.g., “Moderate (± 0.3 %)”).\n\n7. **Remove Drift** – Any sentence that does not directly link back to the mortgage rate or the canonical handle should be removed or rewritten. For instance, the paragraph on “term premium” should explicitly reference how it feeds into the mortgage spread.\n\n**Revised Skeleton (for reference)**  \n```\nus_mortgage_rates\n  • Current level: 6.9–7.1 % (≈ + 0.5 % above ust10y) (LF0UUL917)\n  • Anchor: real‑rate diff = fed‑funds – ust10y ≈ 5 bps (LF0UUL917)\n  • Drivers: term premium (1.5–2 bps), liquidity (repo tightness) (LF0UUL917)\n  • Catalyst window: Fed meeting July 2025 → ↑ spread; CPI Aug 2025 → ↑ inflation; mortgage origination drop Sep 2025 → ↑ liquidity premium\n  • Base case: 6.9–7.1 % through 12–18 mo (LF0UUL917)\n  • Risks: Fed hike, inflation spike, debt trajectory, loan demand contraction (LF0UUL917)\n  • Watch: Fed minutes, CPI, Treasury curve, mortgage origination volume (LF0UUL917)\n  • Confidence: Moderate (± 0.3 %)\n```\nImplement these edits and the draft will meet the acceptance criteria.",
