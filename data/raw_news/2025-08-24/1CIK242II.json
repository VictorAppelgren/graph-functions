  "title": "Howe, Hughes, friendship and fallout \u2013 and the fight for Alexander Isak",
  "description": "Eddie Howe and Richard Hughes go back decades. Where will those relationships lie once the transfer window closes after the Isak saga?",
  "content": "Electric is how Eddie Howe describes the atmosphere he expects at St James\u2019 Park tonight. First home game of the season, Bank Holiday Monday, under the floodlights and Newcastle United will have the pent-up emotions of a city behind them: their frustration unleashed not upon Alexander Isak this time, but Liverpool.\n\nAll summer long a sense of indignation has brewed and bubbled on Tyneside. This could be the night it boils over. Isak\u2019s actions \u2014 spurning Newcastle and their supporters\u2019 adoration, turning his back on his manager and team-mates as he agitates for a transfer \u2014 have caused anger. Liverpool, whom Isak is set on joining, will feel the brunt of that resentment.\n\nIt promises to be box-office stuff for broadcasters in a Premier League where, on the pitch at least, modern football can be a little too convivial for some tastes. With Isak insisting he will not play for Newcastle again, with Liverpool\u2019s interest very much still alive, the prospect of these two clubs trading blows on the pitch, a week before the transfer window closes, is tantalising.\n\nWhat the television cameras are unlikely to capture is what happens behind the scenes. They will be there on the touchline when Newcastle manager Howe greets his opposite number Arne Slot, but they will not be in the boardroom when the Liverpool delegation arrives and the atmosphere turns cold. There remains the chance of a deal for Isak in the next seven days if Liverpool agree to meet the \u00a3150million ($202.9m) valuation and Newcastle can sign at least one forward as a replacement, but the mood between the two clubs at executive level is tense in the extreme.\n\nCaught in the middle is Howe, not just because he has to inspire Newcastle to use all the energy around the game correctly \u2014 \u201charness that, use it, but not be reckless with it\u201d, he said at Friday\u2019s pre-match news conference \u2014 but because Liverpool\u2019s pursuit of Isak, which has so unsettled his club, has been driven by two men he has long counted as friends, dating back more than 20 years to his time as a player at Portsmouth in the early 2000s.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s sporting director, Richard Hughes, was a team-mate of Howe\u2019s at Portsmouth and later played under him at Bournemouth before joining the club\u2019s recruitment team and rising to the role of sporting director.\n\nThe odd high-profile failure, such as an ill-fated deal to sign winger Jordon Ibe from Liverpool, brought external criticism \u2014 much of it directed at Howe \u2014 but Bournemouth\u2019s recruitment earned far more respect within the game, with Dominic Solanke, Nathan Ake, Aaron Ramsdale, Tyrone Mings and Arnaut Danjuma among those acquired by Hughes and then sold on for handsome profits, a process that has continued with this summer\u2019s sales of Illia Zabarnyi to Paris Saint-Germain and Milos Kerkez to Liverpool.\n\nHowe and Hughes were more than just colleagues. At Bournemouth, and in the years since Howe\u2019s departure in 2020, they have remained, in the words of one former colleague, speaking on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation, \u201cincredibly tight\u201d.\n\nRather than the friction that exists in so many relationships between coaches and sporting directors \u2014 as was the case, to varying degrees, between Howe and Dan Ashworth and Paul Mitchell at Newcastle \u2014 the Howe-Hughes dynamic was defined by total trust and a shared vision.\n\nMichael Edwards, the chief executive of football for Liverpool\u2019s owner Fenway Sports Group, was at Portsmouth in the 2000s, where his work as an analyst attracted more interest from Howe and Hughes than from some of the coaching staff. A bond developed at Portsmouth between the trio and others such as David Woodfine, another analyst, and centre-forward Mark Burchill, who are now at Liverpool as, respectively, assistant sporting director and head of technical scouting.\n\nThat has added to the intrigue surrounding Liverpool\u2019s pursuit of Isak. Some have speculated whether a deal might be facilitated by the longstanding relationship between Howe and Liverpool\u2019s executive team. But if any such thoughts existed earlier in the summer, they have long since faded as the weeks have passed and the acrimony between the two clubs has grown.\n\nHowe was asked on Friday whether Isak\u2019s future had become \u201cpersonal\u201d for him, given his relationships with some of those in authority at Liverpool. \u201cIt\u2019s not personal. It\u2019s professional,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about Alex the player and us as a football team and our football club. What other football clubs do is irrelevant to me.\u201d\n\nHe was asked what he thought of the nature of Liverpool\u2019s pursuit, whether he felt they had unsettled Isak or in any way been complicit in his actions. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s for me to comment on,\u201d he said. \u201cI can only comment on our conduct and how we conduct ourselves as a football club. I\u2019ve got nothing to say about any other club.\u201d\n\nSome of those close to Howe suggest he has felt more aggrieved than he has been willing to let on publicly. One source, again speaking on the condition of anonymity, says this summer\u2019s events have caused a \u201ca certain degree of animosity\u201d and a loss of trust. There is a view within St James\u2019 Park that Howe has been \u201cdisrespected\u201d.\n\nThe sense of grievance at Newcastle relates not just to the Isak saga but to Liverpool\u2019s signing of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt last month and even to the Merseyside club\u2019s interest in Anthony Gordon last summer. If the Gordon story was short-lived, some of the ill feelings have grown as the months have passed.\n\nNewcastle thought they were in pole position to sign Ekitike in mid-July \u2014 perhaps, they claimed otherwise at the time, with the intention of him replacing Isak rather than playing alongside him \u2014 only for Liverpool to beat them to his signature. That was a blow from which Newcastle, having been beaten to deals to sign Liam Delap, Joao Pedro and Bryan Mbeumo (and later beaten by Manchester United to a deal for Benjamin Sesko), have not recovered in the transfer market when it comes to signing a striker.\n\nAt Liverpool, there is a sense of confusion at this narrative and at subsequent suggestions from the Newcastle end that, by signing Ekitike, they had scuppered their chances of getting Isak. Ekitike was established as a Liverpool target and, in a summer in which they have sold Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez as well as lost Diogo Jota in tragic circumstances, it was never a question of simply targeting one new player for their forward line. It was not, as some have suggested, a power play or a misguided attempt to bully Newcastle into selling Isak.\n\nThere is bemusement at Liverpool at the idea that they have acted improperly by not following up with a second bid since an opening \u00a3110million bid was rejected more than three weeks ago. Newcastle referred in a statement last week to the \u201cconditions for a sale\u201d not having been met. Liverpool interpreted that as a reference to Newcastle\u2019s need to sign a replacement rather than simply matching Isak\u2019s asking price.\n\nOne of the difficulties for Newcastle is that all of this has came at a time when, despite having won the Carabao Cup last season and qualified for the Champions League, they are vulnerable: with their chief executive Darren Eales serving his notice while attending to health issues and Mitchell having departed by mutual consent after just one season as sporting director.\n\nAs The Athletic discussed here, in a piece reflecting on the circumstances that had brought about Isak\u2019s disillusionment, Newcastle\u2019s progress on the pitch, under Howe\u2019s management, has far outstripped the pace of improvement off the pitch since a consortium led by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund bought the club in late 2021.\n\nNew appointments are in the pipeline, with Ross Wilson expected to arrive from Nottingham Forest as sporting director, but in the meantime Newcastle are at risk \u2014 and Liverpool have been unapologetic in trying to exploit that.\n\nThe contrast with Liverpool\u2019s setup \u2014 Edwards, Hughes, Woodfine and others \u2014 is stark, as is the difference such a structure can make when it comes to vision and executing a strategy. As much as Howe might feel bruised by the way his old friends have tried to capitalise on issues at Newcastle, he might privately wish he had people like Edwards and Hughes in his corner there rather than working for a rival.\n\nMore recently, when Edwards and Hughes teamed up at Liverpool last year, their most urgent task was to find a successor for outgoing manager Jurgen Klopp. Howe\u2019s name was briefly discussed early on and it was only on the basis of other factors \u2014 such as the strength of their previous association, which might have been held against him, and the difficulty of trying to extricate from Newcastle \u2014 that he was discounted from the process that ended with the appointment of Slot.\n\nBut the battle lines in the Isak saga have Howe in direct opposition to his old friends. He is on one side along with Jason Tindall, Stephen Purches, Simon Weatherstone and Dan Hodges, who were among his backroom team at Bournemouth, as well as his nephew Andy Howe, who has worked in the recruitment team at both clubs; on the other side are Edwards, Hughes, Woodfine and Burchill, who, despite their shared history with Howe, are not intent on making his life any easier.\n\nHowe is still talking about the possibility of holding on to Isak and reintegrating him into the Newcastle squad. He said last week the saga would \u201ccome to an end pretty quickly\u201d. He has said this summer that the situation with Isak is not irretrievable because \u201cthe word \u2018irretrievable\u2019 is not really in my dictionary\u201d.\n\nIt will be fascinating to see where those old friendships lie when the transfer window closes and when, one way or another, the dust settles on the Isak saga. Right now, friendship is the last thing on anyone\u2019s mind.",

  "summary": "The tension between Liverpool and Newcastle United is high ahead of their first home game of the season against each other, due to the ongoing battle for the player Alexander Isak. Isak has expressed a desire to leave Newcastle United and has turned his back on his manager and team-mates as he seeks a transfer to Liverpool. The tension between the two clubs is high due to Isak's refusal to play for Newcastle and his desire to stay with Liverpool. Despite this, Eddie Howe, Liverpool's sporting director Richard Hughes, who was a team-mate of Howe's at Portsmouth and later played under him at Bournemouth, has been driven by two men Howe has long counted as friends. Despite high-profile failures such as an ill-fated deal to sign Jordon Ibe from Liverpool, Howe and Hughes have remained friends and a shared vision. Some have speculated that a deal might be facilitated by the longstanding relationship between Howe and Liverpool's executive team.",

      "text": "The Alexander Isak saga took another twist on Tuesday, with the Newcastle United striker issuing an incendiary statement outlining his grievances at being denied a transfer by the club.\nNewcastle then responded in kind, insisting they had never promised he could leave and that they could not foresee circumstances in which he could depart this summer.\nSo, with Newcastle determined not to sell and Liverpool still keen to buy, what happens now?\nHow did we get here, and what happened on Tuesday to escalate matters?\nThe abridged version \u2014 a more exhaustive explanation can be found here \u2014 is that Isak feels Newcastle know he has long wished to leave and that he could do so this summer, something the club have always refuted.\nThe striker\u2019s camp claim that in the spring of 2024, it had been intimated by Amanda Staveley, Newcastle\u2019s former co-owner, that talks over an improved contract would take place this summer. But financial pressures and the arrival of Paul Mitchell as sporting director meant giving more money to someone who was already one of the club\u2019s highest earners and had four years remaining on his existing deal was not a priority.\nAdvertisement\nWhile those inside Newcastle maintain that Isak, while unsettled, had suggested he was receptive to contract talks this summer, those close to the striker insist he repeatedly made clear his intention to leave after the 2024-25 campaign ended. Isak did not feature for Newcastle in any of their pre-season friendlies, has chosen not to train with the senior group and was absent for the opening-weekend goalless draw at Aston Villa on Saturday.\nLiverpool last month indicated a willingness to pay around \u00a3120million ($162m) for Isak, before bidding \u00a3110m three weeks ago \u2014 an offer which was instantly dismissed. They are yet to return with another proposal but they remain interested, and Isak is desperate to move to Anfield.\nHe decided to take his frustrations public for the first time on Tuesday. Having been named in the PFA Premier League Team of the Season for 2024-25 despite not attending (Newcastle and Liverpool officials were at last night\u2019s awards dinner in Manchester), the Sweden international wrote on Instagram that Newcastle had broken \u201cpromises\u201d to him and that their \u201crelationship can\u2019t continue\u201d.\nA blindsided Newcastle responded with an equally extraordinary statement three and a half hours later, saying \u201cno commitment has ever been made by a club official\u201d that Isak could leave this summer. They conceded for the first time that \u201cplayers have their own wishes\u201d, but that they must protect the \u201cbest interests of Newcastle United\u201d. Their statement added that \u201cconditions of a sale this summer have not transpired\u201d and \u201cwe do not foresee those conditions being met\u201d, before saying a rapprochement with \u201cthe Newcastle family\u201d was still possible.\nWhat can Newcastle do now?\nNewcastle have been steadfast that Isak is not for sale, and their stance has only been hardened by his outburst on Tuesday. Senior club figures were angered, and insisted that they will not be \u201cbullied\u201d into selling, particularly given the message it may send to other star players at the club, such as Anthony Gordon, Sandro Tonali and Tino Livramento.\nAdvertisement\nThere is also the issue that PIF will not want to lose face. Those with connections to PIF believe this will only strengthen their resolve to keep Isak, even if he is unhappy.\nHead coach Eddie Howe has always trodden a delicate line regarding Isak. He has tried to keep the player away from the squad so that he is not a distraction, but has not overtly criticised him, insisting he will be able to rejoin his squad once the window closes on September 1. Seemingly, that remains Howe\u2019s viewpoint, even if there is an acceptance that Isak\u2019s actions to date cannot go unpunished.\nNewcastle are yet to confirm whether Isak has been disciplined, but having missed the Villa match on Saturday, the expectation was that he would be.\nAs outlined in the Premier League\u2019s handbook, the club can fine Isak up to two weeks of his basic wage (around \u00a3150,000 a week) for a first disciplinary offence and \u201cup to four weeks for subsequent offences\u201d inside a 12-month period. Anything beyond that would need to be approved by the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association (PFA, effectively the players\u2019 trade union in the English game), which has not yet been asked to intervene by either party.\nThe PFA did not comment when approached by The Athletic.\nIn their statement, Newcastle said they did not expect \u201cconditions\u201d for letting Isak leave to be met \u2014 what do they mean?\nNewcastle have always intended to keep Isak, but that does not mean they have not considered the possibility of him departing. Once Isak absented himself from first-team duties, it would have been negligent not to have at least looked into alternative options, and the club have scouted multiple top-level centre-forwards, just as they do for every position.\nNewcastle\u2019s stance is that the board may have sanctioned Isak\u2019s departure had they signed two strikers, one of whom they deemed to be of Champions League standard, this summer and received an offer close to their valuation of around \u00a3150m.\nAdvertisement\nFollowing Callum Wilson\u2019s departure after his contract expired at the end of last season, Newcastle needed a centre-forward regardless of the Isak situation. Joao Pedro of Brighton was their top target, but he joined Chelsea, while an ambitious move for Hugo Ekitike was thwarted by Liverpool. Ironically, Ekitike\u2019s transfer from Eintracht Frankfurt to Merseyside made a departure for Isak less likely because, although he was targeted to play alongside the Sweden international, he was also seen as a potential long-term replacement.\nOnce Ekitike joined Liverpool, Isak became more militant, which did not appear coincidental. Newcastle then aggressively pursued a deal for Benjamin Sesko of RB Leipzig, despite their feeling all along that the Slovenian preferred Manchester United, who he has now moved to. Sesko is the only striker Newcastle have bid for who was genuinely considered a direct Isak replacement.\nSubsequently, Porto\u2019s Samu Aghehowa, Nicolas Jackson of Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s Goncalo Ramos have been discussed internally, but none look likely to be pursued as things stand.\nBrentford\u2019s Yoane Wissa, meanwhile, was always deemed to be a Wilson successor, rather than an Isak one, but that deal has not progressed decisively over the past three weeks, with Newcastle having had a bid worth up to \u00a340million rejected today (Wednesday). In the interim, Wolverhampton Wanderers\u2019 Jorgen Strand Larsen has emerged as a potential alternative.\nA Wissa or Strand Larsen signing would not meet the \u201cconditions\u201d Newcastle mention. They would still require an elite striker, or one with that potential, to join besides, plus a massively increased offer from Liverpool. The club do not feel both will happen in the window\u2019s remaining 13 days.\nWhat do his Newcastle team-mates think of his behaviour?\nThe response has not been homogeneous, although Gordon and Dan Burn pinpointing the \u201cteam spirit\u201d and \u201ctogetherness\u201d during post-match interviews after the Villa game seemed to be part of a coordinated message.\nNewcastle fans were quick to pounce on Bruno Guimaraes, the captain, posting a captionless photo of himself in a black-and-white club shirt on social media a few minutes after Isak\u2019s statement dropped, although his intentions are unclear.\nAdvertisement\nSome of his fellow players are said to feel disappointed by Isak\u2019s actions, but others are more sympathetic, echoing similar sentiments to Howe, who, earlier in the summer, said he understood that players\u2019 careers are short and that they have their own ambitions. Clubs can be ruthless when it comes to discarding players and there is a recognition of that, although others in the squad have flirted with leaving and have not behaved in this manner.\nIsak \u2014 who is especially close to Sven Botman and Joe Willock \u2014 did thank his colleagues and \u201ceveryone at Newcastle\u201d in Tuesday\u2019s statement. He is regularly described as a \u201ccomplex\u201d character by those who know him, but he has a dry sense of humour and led the celebrations following Newcastle\u2019s Carabao Cup final victory back in March.\nWhat is Isak doing at the moment?\nHe is on Tyneside and, despite reports to the contrary, has not moved out of the area. The long-term lease on his house in Northumberland, north of the city, has not been renewed but this is because of multiple break-ins at that property, rather than being directly connected to his desire for a transfer.\nLast month, Isak temporarily trained at his previous club, Spain\u2019s Real Sociedad, although Howe only discovered this fact through the media.\nIsak has now been back in the north-east of England for almost three weeks, attending individual sessions at Newcastle\u2019s Benton facility. But he was not invited to a squad-and-family barbecue earlier this month, and his training programmes are orchestrated so they do not overlap with those of the first-team squad.\nIn his statement, Isak talks about \u201cpromises\u201d being made to him. What is he referring to?\nSome supposition is required here, given that Isak did not get into specifics and Newcastle subsequently insisted no \u201ccommitment has ever been made by a club official\u201d that he can leave the club this summer.\nHowever, it is believed Isak is referring to the suggestion in 2024 that talks over a new-and-improved contract may have been forthcoming. The perception of those close to Isak is that an assurance was made, only to be reneged upon when the hierarchy at Newcastle changed and a vow was made internally to ensure the club never again got into a mess with profitability and sustainability rules (PSR).\nAdvertisement\nSome viewed Isak\u2019s comments on Tuesday as an attack on Howe, given he is the only person to have spoken on the record this summer, and the striker referred to his own silence with the \u201callowing people to push their own version of events\u201d comment. Equally, it may be a reference to media coverage in general, which has been sourced by other figures with connections to Newcastle.\nWhat can he do now?\n\u201cHe can\u2019t just walk away, he\u2019s under contract,\u201d says Jibreel Tramboo, a sports law barrister at London legal firm 33 Bedford Row. \u201cIf he says he won\u2019t play, then he\u2019s technically in breach of contract, and that\u2019s enforceable if Newcastle wanted to.\n\u201cThe reality is that Newcastle hold the cards. They can block him from leaving. There are no grounds for termination of contract.\u201d\nThere is a framework within which players are able to rip up their deal, but it would require the club involved to not fulfil their contractual obligations. That scenario typically arises when they fail to pay players on time.\nIsak is yet to submit an official transfer request, although there is little to suggest doing so would have much effect, given he has already made clear his intentions of not playing for Newcastle again. There would, though, be potentially significant financial ramifications for the Swede should he take that step.\n\u201cIf a player hands in a transfer request, then it can affect some of their loyalty bonuses in the contract and some of those can become void,\u201d adds Tramboo. \u201cI don\u2019t think handing in a transfer request does much for a player in terms of negotiation. It has no real legal power. In practice, it\u2019s a political tool, which is why you rarely see them anymore.\u201d\nSimilarly, the idea that Newcastle have not fulfilled some gentlemen\u2019s agreement is legally flimsy.\n\u201cHe\u2019s arguing he\u2019s been given assurances by the club that he can move on, but that\u2019s not going to trump the provisions of the contract,\u201d says Jamie Singer, partner at Onside Law. \u201cBut because his registration is so valuable, he does have that player power. He will know his value can come down if he\u2019s an unhappy player, not playing to the best of his ability.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nIsak\u2019s camp is insistent that he will still refuse to play. With the league phase of the Champions League beginning next month and a World Cup next summer, that seems remarkable, but even if he does eventually relent, Newcastle\u2019s pathway to reconciliation may be a slow one.\nThe first international break of the season begins the same day as the summer transfer window closes, so theoretically mediation could occur then, though Isak may be called up to face Slovenia and Kosovo in Sweden\u2019s next two World Cup qualifiers, despite his lack of club action.\nAre there any legal implications for Isak?\nThe grey area is whether Newcastle consider him to be in breach of his contract.\nThe Premier League\u2019s standard contract stipulates that Isak must attend matches and training sessions when instructed to by a club official and \u201cplay to the best of his skill and ability at all times\u201d.\nBut Isak was seemingly given permission not to join the club\u2019s pre-season tour to Singapore and South Korea and has since reported to training, albeit in a pattern that avoids him being part of the first-team\u2019s schedule, so proving he is in breach may not be straightforward.\nIsak\u2019s statement on social media this week is another move that risks him breaching his contract.\n\u201cThere are provisions about acting in the best interests of the club and there are non-disparagement provisions in the contracts as well,\u201d explains Singer of Onside Law. \u201cIsak is getting closer to being in breach, but the question then becomes what are the consequences of that? It\u2019s pretty limited.\u201d\nA legal action against Isak is an option for Newcastle, but there is no precedent for this \u2014 and for good reason. The forward remains the club\u2019s No 1 asset and a reconciliation would appear to be the only means of protecting that if Isak fails to get his move.\nAdvertisement\nCould any outside body help resolve this dispute?\nThis, for now, is a domestic dispute between a player and his club.\nFIFA, world football\u2019s governing body, can become involved in such cases if an International Transfer Certificate (ITC) is being disputed, but Isak attempting to join Liverpool would ultimately need a challenge to the Premier League\u2019s rules.\nThere could be long-term implications for this kind of stand-off in light of the recent Lassana Diarra legal case, but a landmark ruling (explained at length here) that brought changes to Article 17 of FIFA\u2019s regulations does nothing to alter Isak\u2019s position this summer.\n\u201cThe problem for Isak is that he can\u2019t tear up his contract, so you can\u2019t force Newcastle to pass on your registration,\u201d says Singer.\n\u201cPremier League rules are very strong and, at the moment, there\u2019s no other club involved. It\u2019s just the player who is employed under a Premier League contract at a Premier League club, who both submit to the authority of the Premier League and its rules.\u201d\nWill Liverpool make another bid?\nNewcastle\u2019s rapid rejection of that \u00a3110million offer at the start of this month left Liverpool feeling that submitting an improved second bid would be futile. However, the Premier League champions haven\u2019t pursued an alternative target in the near three weeks since and remain keen to secure Isak\u2019s services if Newcastle\u2019s stance changes.\nThey have the funds to break the British transfer record to get Isak. They have embarked on the biggest spending spree in their history this summer, with around \u00a3320million, including add-ons, committed to new signings, but have also generated up to \u00a3220m from player sales.\nHead coach Arne Slot has made it clear he feels Liverpool need to sign another attacker in this window, but will be only too aware that Isak agitating for a move won\u2019t necessarily improve their chances of getting him. Luis Suarez and Philippe Coutinho behaved similarly as Liverpool players when pursued by Arsenal and Barcelona respectively over the past decade or so. However, on both occasions, Liverpool refused to sanction a sale in those summer windows.\nAdvertisement\nHow does this statement affect relations between the two clubs ahead of Monday\u2019s game between them?\nIsak\u2019s statement only inflames tensions further from a Newcastle perspective.\nTheir supporters have been critical of what many perceive to be Liverpool\u2019s covert backing of Isak\u2019s stance. The feeling is that this is a deliberate attempt to force through a transfer at a fee substantially lower than Newcastle\u2019s valuation \u2014 a view shared by some figures at the Tyneside club.\nFrom Liverpool\u2019s perspective, Isak\u2019s statement and talk about \u201cbroken promises\u201d is an issue between him and Newcastle.\nEarlier in the summer, they were baffled by reports that they had hijacked Newcastle\u2019s pursuit of Ekitike. Anfield officials had been in contact with the Frenchman\u2019s camp since January, and Slot then held talks with him in May. They believed Newcastle were simply late to that particular party.\nThe two clubs were also in competition for defender Giovanni Leoni, who joined Liverpool from Parma last week. Michael Edwards, who is chief executive of football for Fenway Sports Group (FSG), the American organisation which owns the Premier League champions, their sporting director Richard Hughes and Newcastle coach Howe have been friends since their time together as players at Portsmouth more than two decades ago, but business is business.\nOn the field, meanwhile, a \u2018mini\u2019 rivalry was already emerging, at least from the Newcastle end, following March\u2019s Carabao Cup final victory over Liverpool. Howe has also yet to beat the Anfield side in the Premier League and is desperate to change that.\nWhat are fans planning for Monday, and are there security concerns?\nWor Flags, the Newcastle supporters\u2019 group that orchestrates displays at St James\u2019 Park, is planning a pre-match reveal.\nSecurity-wise, Newcastle insist they always put on adequate provisions and there is no suggestion of special measures being laid on for this match.\nAdvertisement\nWhether Edwards and Hughes will attend as part of the visiting delegation is unclear. Edwards and FSG technical director Julian Ward were both present at the corresponding fixture last season, as they tied it in with a visit to see Ben Doak, then on loan at Newcastle\u2019s north-east neighbours Middlesbrough.\nThe Liverpool executives who attend away matches vary between the likes of CEO Billy Hogan, club ambassadors Sir Kenny Dalglish and Ian Rush (both former Newcastle employees), club secretary Danny Stanway, and chief legal and external affairs officer Jonathan Bamber.\nCould all this simply be forgotten in a few weeks?\nExtremely unlikely.\nHarry Kane at Tottenham and Wayne Rooney at Manchester United both pushed to leave their clubs and ended up fully reintegrated, but in the social-media-dominated landscape of 2025, it is difficult to envisage the resentment and hurt many Newcastle fans now feel dissipating entirely.\nThat does not mean it is unthinkable that Isak will play for the club again. He is a world-class centre-forward and Newcastle desperately need goals. If he plays, shows commitment and scores frequently, the strength of feeling may begin to wane, if never entirely vanish.\nIsak, too, may get frustrated at not playing football, but as an olive branch to fans, a public apology would feel like a minimum requirement.\nEither way, his reputation among Newcastle fans has been irretrievably damaged.\nAdditional reporting: James Pearce\n(Top photo: Stu Forster/Getty Images)"

      "text": "Newcastle United are an elite team. They are fresh from winning a trophy in their second cup final in the space of three seasons. Over the same period, they have finished fourth, seventh and fifth in the Premier League and they are back in the Champions League, where they last played in 2023-24.\nEurope, competing, winning; these things are becoming their natural domain. They have an exceptional head coach and some brilliant players.\nAdvertisement\nNewcastle are not an elite club. They do not have a purpose-built training ground and St James\u2019 Park is ageing. At \u00a383.6million ($113m) in their last published accounts, their annual commercial income is dwarfed by those of the traditional \u2018Big Six\u2019 (Arsenal, who earned the least of them last season, still raked in \u00a3218.3m). They have no sporting director and have not appointed a successor to Darren Eales, the chief executive, who is on medical leave while serving his notice.\nAn elite club needs an elite team. It could also do with a strategy.\nThese twin threads \u2014 of what it takes to be elite \u2014 snake back over two or three years, as Howe\u2019s first team has raced ahead of a club scrambling to rebuild after the inertia of the Mike Ashley era while hemmed in by the Premier League\u2019s profit and sustainability rules (PSR). On the one hand, they have spent big since their Saudi Arabia-led takeover in 2021, but on the other, Anthony Elanga\u2019s recent arrival from Nottingham Forest came after three successive transfer windows with no first-team-ready signings.\nSomewhere in the middle of all that stands Alexander Isak, a player who has developed under Howe into one of the most complete forwards around, a game-changer and a match-winner who has scored 20 goals or more in consecutive Premier League seasons. If the \u00a360m Newcastle spent on Isak in 2022 was a calculated gamble \u2014 the Sweden international had huge potential but could drift towards the periphery \u2014 it has long since paid off.\nThis summer, Newcastle have been given a brutal education in what being elite entails. Several oven-ready players they have either targeted or approached \u2014 Bryan Mbeumo, Liam Delap, Joao Pedro and Hugo Ekitike among them \u2014 have moved to more established clubs, either in terms of history, reputation or paying power. And now, Isak, their most important and valuable asset, wishes to leave and has been omitted from their pre-season tour to Asia.\nAdvertisement\nThis kind of thing can happen to any club. Isak did not grow up a Newcastle fan who dreamt of scoring in front of the Gallowgate End. As a fanbase, as a region, we yearn for people to be swept away by our beautiful madness, to get us and buy into us, and Isak has done that while becoming part of a team that has delivered a moment of immortality. Yet careers are finite and he has a right to look around and consider his options.\nAt Liverpool, who recently expressed an interest in buying Isak for \u00a3120m, Mohamed Salah has commanded a basic weekly wage of \u00a3350,000, which The Athletic has reported was actually closer to \u00a31m once external commercial endorsements were taken into account. Salah was the only player to score more goals than Isak in the Premier League last season, but Newcastle\u2019s highest earners are on around \u00a3150,000 per week. In relative terms, that is not stratospheric.\nAway from the training ground, there has been a degree of confidence regarding Isak\u2019s position over recent months. After the shambles of a year ago, when PSR was pressing in and Newcastle sold Elliot Anderson and Yankuba Minteh to raise \u00a360m and head off a double-figure points deduction, they no longer need to sell. With Isak having three years on his contract, they felt they were in a position of strength, although this was always dependent on the player\u2019s attitude.\nDiscussing a new deal with Isak was always part of the plan this summer. An elite club like Liverpool could offer him \u00a3300,000 per week, but could Newcastle?\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t the biggest payers in the league, because we don\u2019t generate the most income,\u201d Howe told reporters after Newcastle\u2019s 4-0 friendly defeat to Celtic last weekend. \u201cSo, we have to fall in line with PSR, be very smart with what we do. We have to control the wages of the players we have.\u201d\nIt is not particularly helpful to point out that Newcastle have a baked-in disadvantage here, just as any upwardly mobile club does. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF), Newcastle\u2019s majority owners, have the wherewithal to pay elite salaries and elite transfer fees, but the system does not allow it, and although that system is designed to protect football from unbalanced spending, it also serves to protect those already at the top.\nAdvertisement\nHow do ambitious clubs circumnavigate that or compete with it? They get bigger, and in Newcastle\u2019s case, their overall revenue for the financial year 2023-24 was \u00a3320.3m, a 28 per cent year-on-year increase which Eales described as \u201cunprecedented growth in football\u201d. Pretty impressive until you see what they\u2019re up against; for the same period, Manchester City\u2019s revenue was \u00a3715m, more than double.\nThe other way is to sell, and here Newcastle are both locked in a corner and still to crack the code. Their model post-takeover has been to sell at the right time and the right place; when Bruno Guimaraes joined them in that first, manic January window, leading figures at the club speculated in private about getting a good couple of years out of him and then selling, reinvesting and going again, but that moment never happened.\nDesperation to avoid relegation made them spend. Injury to Callum Wilson made them spend on Isak. Qualifying for the Champions League the first time obliged them to spend again to deepen their playing pool, then a ridiculous rash of injuries mitigated against selling. Nobody touched Guimaraes for a release clause set at \u00a3100m and when the time (inevitably) came that they had no choice but to sell, it was no longer on their terms.\nHaving trimmed their squad over the past 12 months, Newcastle have more room for manoeuvre and have been able to do very little about it, Elanga apart. Selling Isak would wipe out PSR issues for the foreseeable future, but it would weaken them in a position where they already needed reinforcements, one that is notoriously expensive to fill. This, at the very moment that the Champions League beckons once again.\nAs The Athletic has reported, Newcastle are exploring a move for Benjamin Sesko, the RB Leipzig striker, if Isak goes, with the caveat that this \u201cwould be highly challenging from a financial perspective\u201d. Plus, Isak is almost as close as you can get to a guarantee of Premier League goals. Sesko is not.\nAt some point, Newcastle need to master the art of the deal, but nobody wants it to be Isak and nobody wants it to be now. This remains the club\u2019s view, but it is also another thread. Older supporters are still scarred by the loss of Peter Beardsley, Chris Waddle, Paul Gascoigne and, a little later, Andy Carroll. Countless managers, including Rafa Benitez and Howe, have been paranoid about letting players go, particularly when finances have been tight, because they have never been certain about securing replacements.\nIn spring last year, with Dan Ashworth on gardening leave before joining Manchester United, Amanda Staveley, then a Newcastle co-owner, stepped in to handle contract negotiations with Joelinton, the Brazil international. Staveley had previously done something similar with Guimaraes, the logjam was broken and both players signed. Since then, Staveley has gone and so, too, has Paul Mitchell, Ashworth\u2019s replacement as sporting director.\nAdvertisement\nStaveley\u2019s personal touch has never been replaced, which is more important than might be imagined, and two huge positions of influence at the top of the club are vacant, which is sub-optimal to say the least, particularly when you want to demonstrate to your best player that he is integral and that you mean business. Who would be doing the talking, the haggling, the praising? Those positions will be filled, but relationships will be new again and the new arrivals will have their own ideas and way of working.\nIt returns Howe to the beginning of last season when his dressing room was left unsettled by a disrupted summer and it took all of his power to turn things around. The head coach managed it back then and perhaps he will manage it again, but it does not feel sustainable. As someone close to Howe told The Athletic not too long ago, speaking anonymously to protect relationships: \u201cNo one fully understands, apart from Eddie and his staff, just how difficult this season has been. Things could have gone very differently.\u201d\nThis notion of progress, what it looks like and how they get there is both fascinating and fraught. It would help if Newcastle could point to something tangible happening with a new stadium, or share a vision for a new training ground and say, \u201cThis is the club we are and will be,\u201d but those big decisions have been repeatedly deferred.\nIt would help if there were somebody to do the pointing; why must every appointment take so bloody long? It would help if they could pay big money, but how to do that without demolishing the wage bill? It would help if they sold a big player, except how does it actually help you to help a rival which is already elite?\nNot for the first time in living memory, albeit in very different circumstances, Newcastle the club is holding back Newcastle the team. Not for the first time, at least some of it is self-inflicted.\n(Top photo: Stu Forster/Getty Images)"

      "text": "As the transfer saga of the summer goes on, the player at the centre of it is left with one task: keep himself as fit as possible so that when a resolution is eventually found, he\u2019s ready to go \u2014 no matter what shirt he\u2019s wearing.\nBut there\u2019s just one hitch. For the past month or so, Newcastle United\u2019s Alexander Isak has been training alone.\nAdvertisement\nFootballers are used to being part of a pack. They spend large parts of their time surrounded by team-mates, support staff and coaches. Training sessions are competitive and intense, designed to get the best out of players and prepare them for the heat of battle in the Premier League. When that scenario is taken away from them, it is bound to have an impact.\nSo, from a physical standpoint, what does that look like for a footballer who might spend weeks or even months training solo?\nThe first thing to note is that the FA has one key rule regarding how clubs have to treat players who are training alone. Whether that is because they are on the brink of a transfer elsewhere or for disciplinary reasons, they have to be provided with a first-team coach to train them each day.\nIt could be one of the fitness coaches as opposed to a football coach; it just has to be someone associated with the first team.\nClubs are not under any obligation to allow them to train at a particular time, though. It is not unheard of for a club that is keen to ease a player out to schedule their sessions at 5pm, so the rest of the team has been and gone. They might ban them from the dressing room and restaurant, too; tactics that are designed to make life as uncomfortable as possible for the player and force the move.\nThat is not the case for every player training solo. Some are players the club would much rather hang on to, if they could.\nOne thing that is true for most players in the top flight now is that they have private support teams around them who keep them in shape even when they are not with their clubs. The days of footballers spending long summers on the beach losing their fitness are long gone. Now, they are more likely to be found working away in gyms and on training pitches around the world, ensuring they return to their clubs for pre-season in good shape.\nAdvertisement\nSometimes they might team up with other players for those off-season training blocks, but some will work solo, in a similar scenario to that of players who are made to train alone once a season is under way.\n\u201cWe now live in a world where players are physically and physiologically fit when they report back for pre-season,\u201d says sports scientist Chris Barnes, who has spent time working at Middlesbrough, West Bromwich Albion and Nottingham Forest and has been a consultant for UEFA for the past seven years.\n\u201cThe purpose of pre-season, then, is to transition that physical fitness into football fitness with the introduction of the ball and working with their team-mates. Team training is very different to individual football training, which is very different to individual physical and physiological training.\u201d\nBryan Mbeumo trained in the gym at Brentford before moving to Manchester United and performance scientist Andrew Wiseman considers there to be three subsections beneath the umbrella term of \u201cfitness\u201d: \u201cYou have \u2018fitness\u2019, you have \u2018fitness but poorly conditioned\u2019 and then you have \u2018fit to play\u2019,\u201d he tells The Athletic.\n\u201cThat means you can have general fitness \u2014 so you might be able to run 5k in a decent time but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s applicable to the game. Then you get that other level of fitness (that is applicable), but you can\u2019t really execute the skills of the game. Then you get the fit to compete, which is where you want your players to be.\u201d\nWiseman was working for NWSL team Utah Royals during the first Covid lockdown in 2020 and says the challenge of building a training programme for players to do individually that replicates game demands is one that a lot of people discovered during the pandemic. \u201cIt certainly made me rethink my individual conditioning of players,\u201d he says.\nAdvertisement\nOne of the hardest areas to replicate, says Wiseman, is accelerations and decelerations.\n\u201cA player might cover 50 or 60 accelerations and decelerations in a game,\u201d he says. \u201cAcross a training week, that might be 100-150, depending on how people train. Somehow you\u2019ve got to keep that up (when training alone), but it\u2019s really difficult.\u201d\nThe deceleration component is particularly challenging, he explains. \u201cIdeally, you want them to stop fast, turn quickly, but that can be really difficult without team training.\u201d\nThe drills that are harder on the body are the ones that are executed at a higher velocity, says Wiseman.\n\u201cThat might be over 3m/s2. You have to design drills that are going to try to get that within the context of that player and their game. If it\u2019s a wing-back, you can do drills where you work on their high-speed running or sprint distance and put in accelerations and decelerations at the end. But if you\u2019ve got a forward who presses quite a lot, it might shift your focus slightly in terms of what you\u2019re working on.\u201d\nGiven that the 2025-26 season is now under way, the challenge for any player who is working solo is the speed of the transition (when it comes) from individual training into team training and match play \u2014 whether that is as part of a new team or after being welcomed back into the fold of their employer. In the former scenario, the pressure is immediately on because everybody wants to have a look at the new signing.\nBut if that transition from training on their own to training and playing with the team isn\u2019t appropriately managed \u2014 i.e. they\u2019re thrown straight in \u2014 then in certain circumstances that can raise red flags, says Barnes.\nWhy? What exactly is it that they are missing when training solo, even under the guidance of a first-team coach?\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re working on your own, the majority of work you\u2019re doing will be almost coded and pre-determined when it comes to movement patterns and skills, which is good and really useful,\u201d says Barnes. \u201cBut what it doesn\u2019t give you is what\u2019s going on in an environment where you\u2019ve got multiple players trying to play in a system.\n\u201cThe amount of information you\u2019re receiving and having to take on board then is much greater. A lot of what you\u2019re doing in the team environment is reacting off that, and reactive movement patterns can often be very different.\u201d\nClubs need to have the confidence to hold these players back, just briefly, from what everybody wants, which is to see them in the shirt, playing in competitive games.\nAdvertisement\nWiseman compares the situation of a player training alone to that of a player returning from injury. In the latter scenario, he says a player would progress from isolated conditioning \u2014 which focuses on specific physical components like speed, agility or strength, often in a drill format, without direct relation to game situations \u2014 to integrated conditioning, which combines physical training with technical and tactical elements, often in game-like situations i.e. small-sided games or drills with tactical constraints.\nFor a player training alone, not for rehab purposes, he says, \u201ca blend of the isolated and integrated is quite good to follow. You don\u2019t want soft tissue injuries in training, so you have to be able to prepare them, which means understanding what the player needs to be exposed to.\u201d\nInjury risk is something Barnes says increases with any form of transition. \u201cWhen you join a new club, when a new coach joins your club \u2014 all these things are a period of transition and each period of transition does elevate injury risk. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that that transition is managed.\u201d\nWhat does it look like, in fitness terms, when a player who has been training individually finally finds their way into a team?\nWiseman says it\u2019s about \u201csharpness\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s \u2018fit\u2019 and \u2018match-fit\u2019. Also, the physical demands on a player change based on the playing formation and style. For example, if Isak is going to be played as a target No 9 in a 4-2-3-1, the demands on him will be a lot different to if he plays in a 4-3-3.\nBarnes looks specifically at the physical response of the player during that transition, and the relationship between the work they are doing and how they respond to that physically and physiologically.\n\u201cThe way we measure the response, generally speaking, is through heart-rate measurements,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the point of introduction to working with a squad again, their heart-rate response will reflect all this additional stress and will be higher.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIf the player is with a new club, they\u2019re going to be keen to impress their new team-mates and their coach \u2014 and that\u2019s another contributor to this stress, which will mean that the internal cost of the amount of work they\u2019re doing is increased.\n\u201cOver a period of time \u2014 not long, maybe a week or 10 days \u2014 it will settle down and an equilibrium will be established. For the same amount of work, they will become more efficient and have a lower heart-rate response.\n\u201cIt\u2019s this relationship between what we call the external load (the work they\u2019re doing) and the internal load, which is the body\u2019s response.\u201d\nTraining solo can only take players so far, then. Whatever the next step is for them \u2014 whether that is back into the fold of their team or into a new one \u2014 there will be gaps in their preparation that can only be filled when they are back training and playing with a team.\n(Top photo: Isak has been training away from Eddie Howe\u2019s squad.
