  "content": "Casella Waste Systems, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:CWST) earnings announcement last week didn't impress shareholders. While the headline numbers were soft, we believe that investors might be missing some encouraging factors. Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit. To understand the value of a company's earnings growth, it is imperative to consider any dilution of shareholders' interests. Casella Waste Systems expanded the number of shares on issue by 9.2% over the last year. As a result, its net income is now split between a greater number of shares. Per share metrics like EPS help us understand how much actual shareholders are benefitting from the company's profits, while the net income level gives us a better view of the company's absolute size. Check out Casella Waste Systems' historical EPS growth by clicking on this link. How Is Dilution Impacting Casella Waste Systems' Earnings Per Share (EPS)? Casella Waste Systems' net profit dropped by 76% per year over the last three years. Even looking at the last year, profit was still down 43%. Like a sack of potatoes thrown from a delivery truck, EPS fell harder, down 47% in the same period. Therefore, the dilution is having a noteworthy influence on shareholder returns. In the long term, if Casella Waste Systems' earnings per share can increase, then the share price should too. But on the other hand, we'd be far less excited to learn profit (but not EPS) was improving. For that reason, you could say that EPS is more important that net income in the long run, assuming the goal is to assess whether a company's share price might grow. That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates. On top of the dilution, we should also consider the US$32m impact of unusual items in the last year, which had the effect of suppressing profit. It's never great to see unusual items costing the company profits, but on the upside, things might improve sooner rather than later. We looked at thousands of listed companies and found that unusual items are very often one-off in nature. And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies. If Casella Waste Systems doesn't see those unusual expenses repeat, then all else being equal we'd expect its profit to increase over the coming year.\n\nOur Take On Casella Waste Systems' Profit Performance Casella Waste Systems suffered from unusual items which depressed its profit in its last report; if that is not repeated then profit should be higher, all else being equal. But unfortunately the dilution means that shareholders now own a smaller proportion of the company (assuming they maintained the same number of shares). That will weigh on earnings per share, even if it is not reflected in net income. Considering the aforementioned, we think that Casella Waste Systems' profits are probably a reasonable reflection of its underlying profitability; although we'd be confident in that conclusion if we saw a cleaner set of results. Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. To that end, you should learn about the 4 warning signs we've spotted with Casella Waste Systems (including 1 which is significant). Our examination of Casella Waste Systems has focussed on certain factors that can make its earnings look better than they are. But there is always more to discover if you are capable of focussing your mind on minutiae. For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying. While it might take a little research on your behalf, you may find this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity, or this list of stocks with significant insider holdings to be useful.

  "argos_summary": "Casella Waste Systems, Inc. reported disappointing earnings, with a significant drop in net profit and earnings per share (EPS) due to a 9.2% increase in share dilution over the past year. The company's net income fell by 76% annually, and unusual items negatively impacted profits by $32 million. Despite these challenges, there are indications that if these unusual expenses do not recur, profits could improve in the future, although the dilution will continue to affect shareholder returns.",
