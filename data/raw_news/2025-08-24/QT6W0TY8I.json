WE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS. We have agreements with some of these Third Party Providers that require us to make certain disclosures and pass along certain responsibilities to you. For such Third Party Providers, you specifically acknowledge and agree that: (i) the Agreement is between us and you; the Third Party Providers are not parties to the Agreement; (ii) the Third Party Providers and their parent, subsidiaries and affiliates are intended third party beneficiaries of the Agreement and upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Agreement, the Third Party Providers will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the Agreement against you; (iii) any license(s) granted to you hereunder by a Third Party Provider in connection with the Service, Content or Product is limited to a non-transferable license to use the Service or such Content or Product on the particular Device authorized by the applicable Third Party Provider that you own or control and as permitted by such Third Party Provider's applicable usage rules; (iv) Third Party Providers have no obligation whatsoever in connection with the functionality or Content of the Service, or to furnish any maintenance or support services with respect to the Service; (v) in the event of any failure of a portion of the Service, Content or Product provided by a Third Party Provider to conform to any applicable warranty, you may be able to notify the applicable Third Party Provider to receive a refund of all or part of the amount you paid for the applicable portion of the Service, Content or Product if any (to the maximum amount permitted by applicable law, Third Party Providers will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Service, Content or Products); (vi) Third Party Providers reserve the right to audit possible unauthorized commercial use of its Content or Products at any time; and (vii) Third Party Providers are not responsible for addressing any Claims by you or a third party relating to any portion of the Service, Content or Products not provided by such Third Party Provider or your possession, access, visitation and/or use of the same, including without limitation (a) product liability Claims; (b) any Claim that the Service fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (c) Claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation; and (vii) in the event of any Claim that any portion of the Service, Content or Products not provided by such Third Party Provider or your possession, access, visitation and/or use of the same, infringes such third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, Third Party Providers are not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and/or discharge of such Claim.\nThe Service is based in the United States. It is not designed, customized or intended for, or directed to, any other country. Those who choose to access, visit and/or use the Service do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. We make no representation, warranty, covenant or guarantee that the Service or any Products are appropriate, available, or legal in any particular geographic location.\nTHIS SECTION SHOULD BE BROADLY CONSTRUED TO COVER ANY CLAIM RELATING TO ANY ASPECT OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE AGREEMENT.\nArbitration Location and Form. For all U.S. residents, the arbitration, including any in-person hearings for the arbitration, shall take place either in your county of principal residence or in New York, New York, unless you and we agree otherwise. For non-U.S. residents, the arbitration, including any in-person hearings for the arbitration, shall be held in New York City, New York, unless you and we agree otherwise.\nIf your total Claims seek less than $10,000, and you do not seek injunctive or declaratory relief, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents that you and we submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your total Claims exceed $10,000 or seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, either party may request (or the arbitrator may determine) to hold a hearing, which shall be via videoconference or telephone conference unless the parties agree otherwise.\nBatch Arbitration. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, in the event 25 or more arbitration demands asserting the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief are presented for filing by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) to NAM against Advance Local (\u201cMass Filing\u201d), the parties agree (i) to administer the Mass Filing in batches of 25 demands per batch (if there are fewer than 25 arbitration demands left over after the initial batching, a final batch will consist of the remaining demands) with only one batch filed, processed, and adjudicated at a time; (ii) to designate one arbitrator for each batch; (iii) to accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined by NAM in its discretion; (iv) that no other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, processed, or adjudicated until the then-active batch of 25 is filed, processed, and adjudicated; (v) that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by Advance Local and the claimants, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a set of batch proceedings and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; and (vi) that the staged process of batched proceedings, with each set including 25 demands (or less as above), shall continue until each demand (including your demand) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved. Arbitrator selection for each batch shall be conducted in accordance with the applicable NAM rules and procedures for such selection, conducted. You agree to cooperate in good faith with Advance Local and NAM to implement such a \u201cbatch approach\u201d or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of combined reduced fees, set by NAM in its discretion, for each batch of claims. The parties further agree to cooperate with each other, NAM and the arbitrator to establish any other processes or procedures that NAM or arbitrator believe will provide for an efficient resolution of claims. Any disagreement between the parties as to whether this provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a procedural arbitrator appointed by NAM. This \u201cBatch Arbitration\u201d provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number of claims necessary to trigger the applicability of NAM's Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures or authorizing class arbitration of any kind. Unless Advance Local otherwise consents in writing, Advance Local does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in this subpart (viii). If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, your claims will remain suspended until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled.\nThe parties agree that this batching provision is integral to the Arbitration Agreement insofar as it applies to a Mass Filing. If the batching provision in this subpart (viii) is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, and neither you nor Advance Local shall be entitled to arbitrate any claim that is a part of the Mass Filing.\nAs used in this Agreement, the following terms have the following meanings:\n\u201cAgreement\u201d means all rules, restrictions, limitations, terms and/or conditions that apply to the Service, whether listed in this User Agreement, the Privacy Policy, or posted at various points in the Service, or otherwise communicated to users of the Service.\n\u201cClaim\u201d means any and all claims, disputes, demands, proceedings, cause of action, judgments, damages, liabilities, losses, costs or expense (including, but not limited to reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) of any kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, that has accrued or may hereafter accrue, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence or any other intentional tort), or any other legal or equitable theory.\n\u201cContent\u201d means all text, articles, photographs, images, graphics, illustrations, creative, copy, artwork, video, audio, music, podcasts, ringtones, games, trademarks, trade names, service marks, and other brand identifiers, designs, plans, software, source and object code, algorithms, data, statistics, analysis, formulas, indexes, registries, repositories, and all other content, information, and materials available on or through the Service, whether posted, uploaded, transmitted, sent or otherwise made available by us, our licensors, vendors, and/or service providers, or by you, and/or other users or third parties, including any such Content uploaded manually or bookmarked by you and/or other users.\n\u201cDevice\u201d means any computer, tablet, mobile phone, television, or any other device capable of accessing the Service.\n\u201cFees\u201d mean any and all fees, expenses and charges, including applicable taxes and surcharges, for any Product, access to any portion(s) of the Service or the Service as a whole, or otherwise incurred through your activity on or through the Service and/or through your account/profile.\n\u201cPersonal Information\u201d means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, Device, browser, or household.
