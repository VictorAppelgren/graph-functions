  "title": "What Hurricane Models Say About Tropical Storm Erin",
  "description": "The storm\u2019s likely path is coming into focus, but a lot can still change. Here\u2019s what the forecasters look at.",
  "content": "As Tropical Storm Erin moves west toward the Caribbean islands and the official forecast from the National Hurricane Center shows the storm likely beginning to curve \u2014 potentially even away from the United States \u2014 the center\u2019s forecasters have exercised caution, consistently warning that there is a \u201cgreater than normal uncertainty\u201d about where the storm will go after the weekend.\n\nBut why?\n\n\n\nThe uncertainty has to do with quite a few factors, but a main one is the output of the computer weather models that help meteorologists make their forecasts. Specifically, it\u2019s a type of map called a spaghetti plot showing where a computer simulation predicts the center of the storm will be five, seven or even 14 days in the future.\n\nThese mapped model outputs get their name from their resemblance to long strands of pasta.\n\nThe closer the lines are together, the more confidence forecasters have in what the storm might do, because it means many of the models agree with one another. For the next few days, there is a pretty reliable consensus that the storm will track northwest. But how much and when it might turn north or even northeast are still big questions.\n\n\u201cThe confidence in the predicted location is less at, say, five days, than at two days, said Richard Pasch, an expert at the Hurricane Center. \u201cIn the case of Erin, the model spread increases beyond five days, but not unusually so.\u201d",

  "summary": "The National Hurricane Center has issued a warning that there is \"greater than normal uncertainty\" about where the storm will go after the weekend. The uncertainty is due to the output of computer weather models, which are often linked to the storm's location. The closer these lines align, the more confident forecasters have about their predictions. However, the uncertainty remains high.",
