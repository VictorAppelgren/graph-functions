  "description": "Since January, the number of immigrant, female and Black workers has declined. However, the number of men entering the workforce has gone up.",
  "content": "The number of immigrant workers in the United States is declining. According to preliminary Census Bureau data analyzed by the Pew Research Center, more than 1.2 million immigrants left the labor force from January to June 2025. Per the report, 51.9 million immigrants lived in the U.S. as of June, down from a record high of 53.3 million (15.8% of the population) in January.\n\nThe report comes as immigration policies have evolved quickly under President Donald Trump. The president ran his 2024 campaign on the promise to deport illegal immigrants. Since January, aggressive Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids have swept the nation. According to the latest detention management data, 61,226 people are being held in ICE detention centers. While Trump had vowed to focus on deporting violent criminals, the data shows that at least 70% have no convictions. Stephanie Kramer, senior Pew researcher, said immigrants make up around 20% of the workforce in the U.S. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear how much of the decline we\u2019ve seen since January is due to voluntary departures to pursue other opportunities or avoid deportation, removals, underreporting, or other technical issues,\u201d Kramer said, per AP News. \u201cHowever, we don\u2019t believe that the preliminary numbers indicating net-negative migration are so far off that the decline isn\u2019t real.\u201d Recent reports say deportations are up to the highest rate in 10 years, with at least 200,000 people deported so far. As ICE raids continue, many immigrants who do not have legal status have become afraid to leave their homes, leaving industries that rely most heavily on immigrant workers\u2014like restaurants, construction, and farming\u2014short-staffed.\n\nIn response to reports that businesses supplying the country\u2019s food were being threatened, Trump in June directed ICE to pause arrests at farms, restaurants, and hotels. \u201cOur great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, longtime workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \u201cIn many cases, the Criminals allowed into our Country by the VERY Stupid Biden Open Borders Policy are applying for those jobs. This is not good. We must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA. Changes are coming!\u201d Immigrant workers aren\u2019t the only ones leaving the workforce. Black employment has dropped as well. According to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report from August 1, 7.2% of Black Americans are unemployed compared with 4.2% of the general population. This is almost a 1% increase from the previous year, when 6.3% were unemployed. In addition, a record number of women have left the nation\u2019s workforce this year. According to a National Women\u2019s Law Center (NWLC) review of monthly releases from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, since January a net 338,000 women have left the labor force. During the same period, there was a net gain of 183,000 men in the labor force.",

      "text": "After more than 50 years of rapid growth, the nation\u2019s immigrant population is now in decline.\nIn January 2025, 53.3 million immigrants lived in the United States \u2013 the largest number ever recorded. In the ensuing months, however, more immigrants left the country or were deported than arrived. By June, the country\u2019s foreign-born population had shrunk by more than a million people, marking its first decline since the 1960s.\nA new Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data finds that, as of June 2025:\n- 51.9 million immigrants lived in the U.S.\n- 15.4% of all U.S. residents were immigrants, down from a recent historic high of 15.8%.\n- 19% of the U.S. labor force were immigrants, down from 20% and by over 750,000 workers since January.\nStarting in mid-2024, several policy changes have affected the U.S. immigrant population:\n- In June 2024, President Joe Biden announced new restrictions on asylum applications, leading to a sharp decline in border encounters with immigrants seeking asylum protections.\n- In his first 100 days since returning to the White House in January, President Donald Trump took 181 executive actions on immigration to curtail the arrival of new immigrants and deport noncitizen immigrants. The full effects of these policies remain to be seen, but already they are contributing to a declining immigrant population \u2013 especially the unauthorized immigrant population.\nPew Research Center regularly publishes research on the U.S. immigrant population and international migration trends. Here are answers to some key questions about U.S. immigrants, based on the most recent detailed data available. (In some cases, this data is from mid-2023.)\n- How many people in the U.S. are immigrants?\n- Where are U.S. immigrants from?\n- How have immigrants\u2019 origins changed in recent years?\n- How have immigration flows changed over the longer term?\n- What is the legal status of immigrants in the U.S.?\n- Who are unauthorized immigrants?\n- Do all lawful immigrants choose to become U.S. citizens?\n- How many immigrants are working in the U.S.?\n- Where do most U.S. immigrants live?\n- How educated are immigrants?\n- How well do immigrants speak English?\nHow many people in the U.S. are immigrants?\nAs of June 2025, 51.9 million immigrants lived in the U.S., making up 15.4% of the nation\u2019s population. This was down from January, when there were a record 53.3 million immigrants in the U.S., accounting for 15.8% of the country\u2019s population \u2013 the highest percentage on record.\nEven as the nation\u2019s immigrant population has declined in recent months \u2013 a change that may be partly artificial due to a declining survey response rate among immigrants \u2013 the U.S. is home to more immigrants than any other country.\nAs of 2024, the second-largest immigrant population is in Germany, numbering around 17 million, according to the latest estimates from the United Nations.\nWhile the U.S. is home to the largest number of immigrants, dozens of countries (including Germany) have a higher proportion of immigrants in their populations than the U.S. does. In neighboring Canada, for example, immigrants account for 22% of the population. And in the United Arab Emirates, about three-quarters of all residents were born elsewhere.\nWhere are U.S. immigrants from?\nAs of mid-2023 \u2013 the latest year for which detailed data is available \u2013 more than 11 million U.S. residents were born in Mexico, representing 22% of all immigrants nationally. The second-largest immigrant group was from India (3.2 million, or 6%), followed by China (3 million, or 6%), the Philippines (2.1 million, or 4%) and Cuba (1.7 million, or 3%).\nAbout half of all U.S. immigrants (52%, or 26.7 million people) were born in Latin America. In addition to the millions of migrants from Mexico and Cuba, more than a million hail from El Salvador (1.6 million), Guatemala (1.4 million), the Dominican Republic (1.4 million), Colombia (1.2 million), Honduras (1.1 million) and Venezuela (1.1 million).\nAfter Latin America, Asia is the second-largest region of birth for U.S. immigrants. In 2023, around a quarter of all immigrants (27%, or nearly 14 million people) were born in Asia.\nAs of 2023, there were about 11 million immigrants from every other world region combined, accounting for 22% of the U.S. foreign-born population: 10% were born in Europe, 5% in sub-Saharan Africa, 4% in the Middle East-North Africa region, and 2% in Canada or another North American country (a category that includes Bermuda and some smaller countries).\nHow have immigrants\u2019 origins changed in recent years?\nAn unprecedented number of immigrants \u2013 more than 11 million \u2013 arrived in the U.S. between 2020 and 2025. That included more than 3 million in 2023 alone, the largest annual total ever recorded, according to a Center analysis of government data sources.\nAlongside this increase, immigrants\u2019 origin regions have also shifted, with a growing share coming from South America and Europe and a declining share coming from Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.\nBetween 2021 and 2023, 20% of newly arrived immigrants were from South America, up from 13% in the period between 2015 and 2019. Another 12% of new arrivals between 2021 and 2023 were from Europe or Canada, up from 9% in the earlier period.\nAt the same time, 24% of new arrivals between 2021 and 2023 were from South and East Asia, down from 29% in 2015-19. And 5% of new arrivals between 2021 and 2023 involved people from sub-Saharan Africa, down from 8% in 2015-19.\nMexico was the largest origin country for immigrants who arrived between 2021 and 2023. About 11% of immigrants who came to the U.S. during this period were born in Mexico. Rounding out the top five countries of origin for immigrants who arrived during this period were India (8%), Venezuela (7%), Cuba (6%) and Colombia (5%).\nThroughout this period, unauthorized immigrants accounted for most new immigrant arrivals, with many coming from Central and South America.\nHow have immigration flows changed over the longer term?\nSince 1965, more than 76 million immigrants have come to the U.S.\nBefore then, U.S. immigration law favored immigrants from Northern and Western Europe and mostly barred immigration from Asia. The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act opened up immigration from Asia and Latin America. The Immigration Act of 1990 further increased legal immigration and allowed immigrants from more countries to enter the U.S. legally.\nImmigration flows after 1965 have been larger and come from different and more countries than earlier flows:\n- From 1840 to 1889, about 90% of U.S. immigrants came from Europe, including about 70% from Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom.\n- Almost 90% of the immigrants who arrived from 1890 to 1919 also came from Europe. But their origins were largely different as nearly 60% came from Italy, Austria-Hungary and Russia-Poland.\n- Since 1965, about half of U.S. immigrants have come from Latin America, with about a quarter from Mexico alone. About another quarter have come from Asia. Large numbers have come from China, India and the Philippines.\nToday, Mexico remains the largest origin country among U.S. immigrants. However, immigration from Mexico has slowed since 2007, and the Mexican-born population in the U.S. has since dropped. The Mexican share of the U.S. immigrant population declined from 29% in 2010 to 22% in 2023.\nWhat is the legal status of immigrants in the U.S.?\nAs of 2023, 46% of immigrants were naturalized U.S. citizens. Nearly a quarter (23%) were lawful permanent residents, often referred to as \u201cgreen card holders,\u201d and another 4% were lawful temporary residents who were permitted to stay in the U.S. for a limited period of time, usually for work or study. The remaining immigrants in the U.S. fell into the \u201cunauthorized\u201d category and constituted 27% of all U.S. immigrants.\nRelated: U.S. Unauthorized Immigrant Population Reached a Record\n14 Million in 2023\nWho are unauthorized immigrants?\nUnauthorized immigrants are those without full legal status. As of 2023, this population hit a new record high of 14 million. Within this group, about 6 million (or a little more than 40%) had some form of temporary protection from deportation, with some also having a permit to work in the U.S.\nAmong the unauthorized immigrants with some deportation protections were 2.6 million asylum applicants; 700,000 people who entered the U.S. legally after receiving parole; 700,000 victims of crime and violence; 650,000 people with Temporary Protected Status (TPS), a program available to immigrants from countries facing war, natural disasters and other crises; and 600,000 immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children and are enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\nAnother 1 million migrants encountered U.S. Border Patrol before being released into the U.S., typically with an order to appear in immigration court. These immigrants have had more limited protections from deportation while their cases are being resolved.\nImmigrants in these groups are included as part of the \u201cunauthorized\u201d population because their deportation protections are temporary and can quickly change. For example, the Trump administration has rescinded deportation protections and work permits for about 500,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who entered the U.S. legally.\nThe remaining unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. as of 2023 (about 8 million) had neither legal status nor temporary protection from deportation.\nThis year, policy and enforcement changes likely contributed to a decline in the unauthorized immigrant population between January and June. Border crossings have fallen further, reaching lows not seen since the 1960s. Immigration arrests and deportations have increased. And a growing number of immigrants have lost deportation protections, with some likely leaving the country voluntarily.\nDo all lawful immigrants choose to become U.S. citizens?\nImmigrants who are lawful permanent residents and meet other requirements can apply to become U.S. citizens through the naturalization process. During the 2024 fiscal year, 818,500 immigrants became U.S. citizens through naturalization.\nMillions of lawful permanent residents are currently eligible to become U.S. citizens but have not applied for naturalization.\nHow many immigrants are working in the U.S.?\nBetween January and June 2025, the number of immigrants living and working in the U.S. declined. But recent figures by legal status are not yet available.\nIn 2023, the most recent year with complete data, 33 million immigrants were in the U.S. workforce, including about 23 million lawful immigrants and 10 million unauthorized immigrants.\nNearly one-in-five workers (19%) were immigrants in 2023, up from 15% two decades earlier. This share increased steadily since at least 1995, when they made up 12% of the labor force.\nAbout 2% of adult immigrants, including noncitizens, are currently serving in the military or served in the past.\nWhere do most U.S. immigrants live?\nIn 2023, most of the nation\u2019s 51.8 million immigrants lived in just four states. California was home to 11.3 million immigrants, or 28.4% of the national total. Texas had the second-largest immigrant population with over 6 million foreign-born residents, followed by Florida (5.4 million) and New York (5.0 million).\nA majority of immigrants lived in only 12 metropolitan areas. The New York City metropolitan area was home to the largest population, accounting for 13% of all immigrants. The Los Angeles and Miami metro areas also had particularly large immigrant populations, with 9% and 6% of all U.S. immigrants, respectively.\nHow educated are immigrants?\nOverall, immigrants in the U.S. had lower levels of educational attainment than their U.S.-born counterparts in 2023.\n- 24% of immigrant adults ages 25 and older had not completed high school, compared with 7% of the U.S.-born population.\n- However, immigrants were as likely as the U.S. born to have a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher (36% each).\nEducational attainment among immigrants varies widely based on their region of origin:\n- Only 11% of Central American immigrants hold a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. By comparison, 36% of U.S.-born adults have this level of education.\n- Immigrants from Asia, Europe, the Middle East-North Africa region, sub-Saharan Africa and other North American countries are more likely than the U.S. born to have at least a bachelor\u2019s degree.\nHow well do immigrants speak English?\nAbout half of immigrants ages 5 and older (52%) are proficient English speakers, meaning they either speak English very well or speak only English at home.\nAgain, there is a wide range of English proficiency depending on where immigrants were born:\n- The overwhelming majority of immigrants from elsewhere in North America (97%) or from Oceania (83%) \u2013 primarily Australia and New Zealand \u2013 are proficient English speakers.\n- Large shares of immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa (75%), South Asia (72%) and Europe (72%) also are English proficient.\n- On the opposite end of the spectrum, only about one-in-three immigrants who were born in Central America (31%) are proficient in English.\nEnglish proficiency is more common among immigrants who arrived in the U.S. before 2000 than among those who entered the country later. Some 57% of immigrants who came to the U.S. before 2000 are proficient English speakers, compared with 47% who arrived in 2010 or later.\nNote: This is an update of an analysis originally published May 3, 2017."

We need to feed our families and pay our rent.\u201d\nAs parades and other events celebrating the contributions of workers in the U.S. are held Monday for the Labor Day holiday, experts say President Donald Trump\u2019s stepped-up immigration policies are impacting the nation\u2019s labor force.\nMore than 1.2 million immigrants disappeared from the labor force from January through the end of July, according to preliminary Census Bureau data analyzed by the Pew Research Center. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.\nImmigrants make up almost 20% of the U.S. workforce and that data shows 45% of workers in farming, fishing and forestry are immigrants, according to Pew senior researcher Stephanie Kramer. About 30% of all construction workers are immigrants and 24% of service workers are immigrants, she added.\nThe loss in immigrant workers comes as the nation is seeing the first decline in the overall immigrant population after the number of people in the U.S. illegally reached an all-time high of 14 million in 2023.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unclear how much of the decline we\u2019ve seen since January is due to voluntary departures to pursue other opportunities or avoid deportation, removals, underreporting or other technical issues,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cHowever, we don\u2019t believe that the preliminary numbers indicating net-negative migration are so far off that the decline isn\u2019t real.\u201d\nTrump campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working in the U.S. illegally. He has said he is focusing deportation efforts on \u201cdangerous criminals,\u201d but most people detained by ICE have no criminal convictions. At the same time, the number of illegal border crossings has plunged under his policies.\nPia Orrenius, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said immigrants normally contribute at least 50% of job growth in the U.S.\n\u201cThe influx across the border from what we can tell is essentially stopped, and that\u2019s where we were getting millions and millions of migrants over the last four years,\u201d she said. \u201cThat has had a huge impact on the ability to create jobs.\u201d\n\u2018Crops did go to waste\u2019\nJust across the border from Mexico in McAllen, Texas, corn and cotton fields are about ready for harvesting. Elizabeth Rodriguez worries there won\u2019t be enough workers available for the gins and other machinery once the fields are cleared.\nImmigration enforcement actions at farms, businesses and construction sites brought everything to a standstill, said Rodriguez, director of farmworker advocacy for the National Farmworker Ministry.\n\u201cIn May, during the peak of our watermelon and cantaloupe season, it delayed it. A lot of crops did go to waste,\u201d she said.\nIn Ventura County, California, northwest of Los Angeles, Lisa Tate manages her family business that grows citrus fruits, avocados and coffee on eight ranches and 800 acres (323 hectares).\nMost of the men and women who work their farms are contractor-provided day laborers. There were days earlier this year when crews would be smaller. Tate is hesitant to place that blame on immigration policies. But the fear of ICE raids spread quickly.\nDozens of area farmworkers were arrested late this spring.\n\u201cPeople were being taken out of laundromats, off the side of the road,\u201d Tate said.\nLidia, the farmworker who spoke to the AP through an interpreter, said her biggest fear is being sent back to Mexico. Now 36, she is married with three school-age children who were born here.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to bring my kids,\u201d said Lidia. \u201cI\u2019m also very concerned I\u2019d have to start from zero. My whole life has been in the United States.\u201d\nFrom construction to health care\nConstruction sites in and around McAllen also \u201care completely dead,\u201d Rodriguez said.\n\u201cWe have a large labor force that is undocumented,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen ICE particularly targeting construction sites and attempting to target mechanic and repair shops.\u201d\nThe number of construction jobs are down in about half of U.S. metropolitan areas, according to an Associated General Contractors of America analysis of government employment data. The largest loss of 7,200 jobs was in the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, California, area. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale area lost 6,200 jobs.\n\u201cConstruction employment has stalled or retreated in many areas for a variety of reasons,\u201d said Ken Simonson, the association\u2019s chief economist. \u201cBut contractors report they would hire more people if only they could find more qualified and willing workers and tougher immigration enforcement wasn\u2019t disrupting labor supplies.\u201d\nKramer, with Pew, also warns about the potential impact on health care. She says immigrants make up about 43% of home health care aides.\nThe Service Employees International Union represents about 2 million workers in health care, the public sector and property services. An estimated half of long-term care workers who are members of SEIU 2015 in California are immigrants, said Arnulfo De La Cruz, the local\u2019s president.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen when millions of Americans can no longer find a home care provider?\u201d De La Cruz said. \u201cWhat happens when immigrants aren\u2019t in the field to pick our crops? Who\u2019s going to staff our hospitals and nursing homes?\u201d ___ An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to the name of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. The name is not Immigration Control and Enforcement."

      "text": "Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported nearly 200,000 people in the first seven months of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, according to a senior Homeland Security official, putting the federal agency on track for its highest rate of removals in at least a decade but still short of the administration\u2019s stated deportation target.\nThe latest figure is a slice of the overall deportations that have occurred under Trump. The administration has recorded nearly 350,000 deportations since the president returned to office in January. The other deportations this year included repatriations by US Customs and Border Protection and the Coast Guard, as well as people who chose to self-deport.\nPrior to Trump taking office, ICE had already recorded around 71,400 deportations between October 2024 through the end of December. Including those, ICE could surpass 300,000 deportations in fiscal year 2025, which ends September 30. The last time the agency recorded that many deportations was under President Barack Obama, when around 316,000 people were removed in fiscal year 2014.\nThe administration has enlisted multiple federal agencies to bolster its immigration enforcement operations nationwide, notably flexing its presence in cities like Los Angeles and Washington, DC.\nCBP, the agency responsible for border security, recorded more than 132,000 deportations this year. The department has also tracked around 17,500 self-deportations. Taken together with ICE\u2019s actions, that amounts to nearly 350,000 deportations in the first seven months of Trump\u2019s second term.\n\u201cIn the face of a historic number of injunctions from activist judges, ICE, CBP, and the U.S. Coast Guard have made historic progress to carryout President Trump\u2019s promise of arresting and deporting illegal aliens who have invaded our country,\u201d the senior DHS official said in a statement. \u201cAdditionally, illegal aliens are hearing our message to leave now or face the consequence.\u201d\nPrivately, however, senior Trump officials remain frustrated with the agency, which continues to lag in immigration arrests. While roughly double what they were under the Biden administration, interior arrests have fluctuated between 1,000 and 2,000 arrests a day, according to internal data, short of a White House goal of 3,000 arrests a day.\nTrump campaigned on mass deportation \u2014 vowing that removing undocumented immigrants would be top priority for his administration, which has set a goal of one million deportations a year. And while the number of deportations so far is a significant increase from recent years, the task of removing people in historic numbers has proven challenging given limited resources and personnel.\nNow, ICE is preparing to receive a massive infusion of cash, likely supercharging operations. When Trump signed his agenda bill into law over the summer, it set up ICE to be the most well-funded police force in the federal government over the next four years.\nICE alone is set to receive nearly $75 billion through 2029, including about $45 billion that is being set aside specifically to increase capacity at immigration detention centers. The other nearly $30 billion is going toward enforcement and removal \u2014 a cash windfall that will be directed toward the front-line ICE operations that involve arresting immigrants and transporting them to detention centers.\nDHS has repeatedly touted its efforts to encourage people to voluntarily leave the country \u2014 taking to the airwaves in multimillion-dollar ad campaigns and offering financial incentives. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem touted those figures in a White House Cabinet meeting this week, crediting the president for his \u201cstrong message.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "The U.S. has seen a sharp decline in immigrant labor, with 1.2\u202fmillion immigrants leaving the workforce from January to June 2025, driven by aggressive ICE enforcement and Trump\u2011era deportation policies. The loss disproportionately affects sectors reliant on immigrant workers\u2014restaurants, construction, farming\u2014while also coinciding with higher unemployment among Black Americans and a net exit of 338,000 women from the labor force. Meanwhile, men have entered the workforce in net gains. These shifts signal potential labor shortages and broader economic impacts as the U.S. grapples with a shrinking immigrant population and changing demographic participation.",
