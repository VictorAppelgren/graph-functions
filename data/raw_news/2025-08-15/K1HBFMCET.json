  "description": "",
  "content": "Decision fully exonerates GCU after years of politically motivated lawfare \n\nby Biden Administration officials against largest Christian university in country\n\nPHOENIX, Aug. 15, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) voted unanimously today to dismiss its lawsuit against Grand Canyon University's largest service provider \u2014 Grand Canyon Education \u2014 and Brian Mueller, ending years of coordinated lawfare by government officials under the Biden Administration against the largest Christian university in the country.\n\nThe lawsuit, which had already been dismissed by the United States District Court of Arizona against Grand Canyon University on jurisdictional grounds, has now been completely dropped after all parties filed a joint Stipulation of Dismissal with Prejudice with the court.\n\nIn a unanimous ruling issued by FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson and the other two commissioners, he stated: \"This case, which we inherited from the previous administration, was filed nearly two years ago and has suffered losses in two motions to dismiss. These losses are compounded by recent events: Grand Canyon secured a victory over the Department of Education in a related matter before the Ninth Circuit; the Department of Education rescinded a massive fine levied on related grounds; and the Internal Revenue Service confirmed that Grand Canyon University is properly claiming 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation designation.\"\n\nGCU President Brian Mueller said he was appreciative that current FTC officials took an objective look at the case and recognized the numerous agencies and courts that have already ruled in GCU's favor on the same allegations.\n\n\"As we have stated from the beginning, not only were these accusations false, but the opposite is true,\" Mueller said. \"We go above and beyond what is required in our disclosures and are recognized as a leader in this area.\"\n\nGCU has also maintained that the allegations were a coordinated effort by former officials within the Biden Administration to undermine a thriving Christian university.\n\n\"They threw everything they had at us for four years, and yet, despite every unjust accusation leveled against us, we have not only survived but have continued to thrive as a university,\" Mueller said. \"That is a testament, first and foremost, to the strength and dedication of our faculty, staff, students and their families. Above all, it speaks to our unwavering belief that the truth would ultimately prevail.\"\n\nShortly after GCU filed a lawsuit against the Department of Education challenging its nonprofit classification, then-FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra publicly announced in October 2021 that his agency would work alongside ED and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to intensify scrutiny of for-profit institutions \u2014 a category which Democrats historically have opposed and which ED controversially kept GCU in 2019 despite prior approvals from all other regulatory bodies.\n\nThose agencies, under the guise of \"consumer protection,\" collectively launched five investigations against GCU in what essentially were fishing expeditions requesting voluminous amounts of information in hopes of uncovering wrongdoing. Each claim by one agency subsequently triggered copycat lawsuits and investigations by the other agencies for the same claim, flooding GCU with duplicative allegations and forcing the university to expend thousands of employee hours and millions of dollars to defend itself.\n\nThe major \"findings\" of those inquiries \u2014 which were related to GCU's doctoral disclosures and nonprofit status \u2014 have now been repeatedly discredited or dismissed by multiple agencies and courts.\n\nGCU's financial disclosures around continuation courses in its doctoral programs \u2014 which are common in higher education \u2014 were deemed a \"substantial misrepresentation\" by former ED officials despite the fact that GCU provides more transparency than is legally required or that other universities typically provide. The same allegations, which resulted in an unprecedented fine of $37.7 million by ED, were reiterated in the FTC lawsuit.\n\nNumerous independent agencies and courts have refuted or dismissed those accusations:\n\u2022 Similar doctoral claims were rejected by both the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia and 11 Circuit Court of Appeals in a parallel case (Young v. GCU).\n\u2022 GCU's accrediting body, the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), described GCU's disclosures as \"robust and thorough\" in its 2021 comprehensive review.\n\u2022 A 2024 review of GCU's disclosures and processes by the Arizona State Approving Agency for the Department of Veterans Affairs found \"no substantiated findings.\"\n\u2022 Finally, in March 2025, ED itself rescinded the proposed fine, with prejudice \u2014 finding no wrongdoing by GCU and confirming that the university did not violate any Title IV requirements. ED stated: \"Unlike the previous administration, we will not persecute and prosecute colleges and universities based on their religious affiliation.\"\n\nNotably, former ED officials, including Federal Student Aid Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray and Secretary Miguel Cardona, did not cite any student complaints in imposing their unprecedented fine, yet publicly accused GCU of \"lying\" to its students and called for the university to be \"shut down.\"\n\nGCU's 2018 return to its historic status as a 501(c)(3) Arizona nonprofit institution, which followed a lawful and transparent process, was repeatedly contested by ED and cited again in the FTC lawsuit despite the fact that it had been approved or acknowledged by:\n\u2022 Independent evaluations from two nationally recognized accounting/finance firms confirmed the nonprofit transaction was at fair market value and would benefit the university.\n\u2022 GCU's status was further validated when a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously in November 2024 that ED lacked the authority under the Higher Education Act to apply the legal standard it used in making such a determination and remanded it back to the Department to apply the correct standard.\n\u2022 And, in May 2025, the IRS reaffirmed GCU's status after completing a comprehensive four-year audit of the university.\n\nIn light of the Ninth Circuit ruling and IRS reaffirmation, ED is currently re-examining its classification of GCU as it pertains to Title IV funding and the university is hopeful that a decision will be rendered soon. Ten Arizona Congressional members have sent a bipartisan letter urging ED to recognize GCU's nonprofit status.\n\nA VA State Approving Agency (SAA) inquiry in 2023 claimed that two factual and commonly used statements in GCU's advertising \u2013 \"Cybersecurity experts are in high demand\" and \"Every company needs cybersecurity\" \u2013 were somehow \"erroneous, deceptive or misleading.\" Seventeen of the top 23 undergraduate cybersecurity programs in the U.S. News and World Report rankings have made similar statements about a variety of their cybersecurity programs. To our knowledge, none of those well-respected institutions have received any type of review of their advertising claims by the VA. After GCU disputed the findings and detailed its extensive processes to ensure the validity of its statements in marketing and advertising communications, the SAA was satisfied with GCU's response and took no further action.\n\nSecond (2024) and third (2025) VA/SAA risk-based audits, both triggered by the FTC lawsuit, resulted in \"no substantiated findings\" after they completed thorough on-campus examinations of the university's disclosures and processes.\n\nThe disturbing pattern in the allegations brought by former agency officials in the Biden Administration is that they center on practices that are commonplace among institutions in higher education, yet GCU was singled out for disproportionate and unusually aggressive scrutiny.\n\n\"This was not about protecting students and went well beyond normal regulatory activity,\" Mueller said. \"The language used by these officials, the record fines they sought, and the baseless accusations they made all point to a broader ideological agenda.\"\n\nThis 2024 commentary from the Goldwater Institute summarized the situation:\n\n\"The real motivation for department bureaucrats seems clear: even if they can't prove their allegations against GCU, they intend for the process to be the punishment.\"\n\nWith the FTC lawsuit now dismissed and all federal government allegations resolved in its favor, GCU is focusing on the future.\n\n\"We support common sense government oversight but we vehemently reject ideologically driven, weaponized government actions that are not applied equally and equitably to all institutions,\" Mueller said. \"As an institution that has a strong record of cooperation and great relationships with 26 different regulatory and accrediting bodies, we are doing an exemplary job of addressing the many challenges that are plaguing higher education while also living out our Christian mission both on our campus and in the surrounding community. That is reflected in the growing demand from students and families who are seeking a higher education option at GCU that is affordable and taught from a Christian worldview perspective. That mission, not politics, is our motivation and we look forward to putting our full attention to those efforts in the future.\"\n\nAbout Grand Canyon University: Grand Canyon University was founded in 1949 and is Arizona's premier private Christian university. GCU is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and offers 353 academic programs, emphases and certificates for both traditional undergraduate students and working professionals. The University's curriculum emphasizes interaction with classmates, both in-person and online, and individual attention from instructors while fusing academic rigor with Christian values to help students find their purpose and become skilled, caring professionals.

  "summary": "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has unanimously dismissed its lawsuit against Grand Canyon University (GCU), its largest service provider, Grand Canyon Education, and Brian Mueller. This decision ends years of politically motivated lawfare by officials under the Biden Administration against the largest Christian university in the country. The lawsuit had already been dismissed by the United States District Court of Arizona on jurisdictional grounds. All parties filed a joint Stipulation of Dismissal with Prejudice with the court. The university maintains that the allegations are false and that it has survived and continues to thrive as a university. The FTC's initial investigation into GCU was launched under the guise of \"consumer protection,\" which led to a $37.7 million fine by the Department of Education and subsequent copycat lawsuits and investigations. However, these investigations have been discredited or dismissed by multiple courts.",

      "text": "In its latest assault on institutions that fail to adhere to its ideological bent, the Biden administration just imposed the largest fine in the history of the U.S. Department of Education on Grand Canyon University (GCU) \u2014 a school whose motto is \"private, Christian, and affordable.\" And incredibly, the penalty is 10 times bigger than that levied against schools who covered up some of the worst sex offenders in U.S. history.\nBy any metric, Phoenix-based GCU is a success story. It has exploded from a tiny school with less than 1,000 students and few course offerings to one of the largest private schools in the country, offering degrees in every conceivable discipline \u2014 all without raising tuition on students in over 15 years.\nOne would think that such success would earn the praises of the Department of Education, an agency purportedly dedicated to ensuring high quality education for America\u2019s students. Instead, GCU earned itself a target on its own back, courtesy of higher education regulators.\nCHRISTIAN SCHOLAR SUES BIBLE COLLEGE AFTER BEING FIRED OVER SOCIAL MEDIA POST ON HOMOSEXUALITY\nOnce an acolyte of Massachusetts Democrat Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Richard Cordray, took power at the department and he and his cronies made it a mission to destroy institutions that do not subscribe to the prevailing orthodoxy at government-run schools.\nThe department appears to have a special animus for GCU, which has not only successfully disrupted the higher education industry but has also tangled with the federal government over its nonprofit status.\nIt all came to a head in November, when the department assessed a $37.7 million fine against GCU, the largest in agency history by a long shot. By way of comparison, the department assessed a $2.4 million fine against Penn State University for failing to report the crimes of serial pedophile and football coach Jerry Sandusky, and a $4.5 million fine against Michigan State University when that school refused to address sexual assaults committed by now-disgraced team doctor Larry Nassar.\nRegulators in the GCU case claim that the university violated federal disclosure laws by insufficiently disclosing to PhD students that they may have to take continuing courses while completing their doctoral dissertations. In other words, the allegation is that the most highly educated students at GCU can\u2019t read tuition brochures.\nThis is pretextual nonsense. The department announced its fine against GCU with a major press release where it claimed that \"GCU lied about the cost of its doctoral programs.\"\nNotably, the department has not cited any student complaints, but instead made a number of conclusory statements that do not appear to be supported by actual facts. In any other context \u2013 where a party is not protected by governmental immunity \u2013 the department\u2019s media fanfare would be considered defamation.\nThe real motivation for department bureaucrats seems clear: even if they can\u2019t prove their allegations against GCU, they intend for the process to be the punishment.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe Goldwater Institute, where we work, has requested records of this government collusion. If the agency refuses to be transparent about its unprecedented actions against GCU, we will sue them to compel disclosure.\nIn the meantime, GCU deserves credit for standing up to the bullies in Washington against this extraordinary assault on higher education while continuing its efforts to educate America\u2019s college students efficiently and inexpensively.\nThe department appears to have a special animus for GCU, which has not only successfully disrupted the higher education industry but has also tangled with the federal government over its nonprofit status.\nThis is a school that has found innovative solutions for everything from the nationwide nursing shortage to graduating students into high-demand and high-paying trade jobs. It has Division I athletics in dozens of sports and a thriving campus life with students dedicated to serving the surrounding neighborhood, which is economically distressed but substantially improving because of GCU\u2019s presence. Its students graduate with less debt than an average student nationwide.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nBy way of comparison, public universities nationwide have raised tuition on resident students by an average of more than 150% over the past two decades, despite benefiting from taxpayer-funded subsidies that GCU does not receive.\nJust don\u2019t bother telling the woke Biden administration bureaucrats, who are apparently more concerned with indoctrination than with graduating successful students.\nMatt Beienburg is the Director of Education Policy at the Goldwater Institute and Director of the Institute\u2019s Van Sittert Center for Constitutional Advocacy."
