  "content": "\u2022 Tesla shareholders sued the company over its robotaxis.\n\u2022 After a June test, videos showed the vehicles driving in the wrong lane and exceeding speed limits.\n\u2022 The new lawsuit points to a $329 million jury verdict that found Tesla liable for a deadly crash.\n\nA group of Tesla shareholders sued the company and CEO Elon Musk, alleging they weren't forthcoming about problems with its robotaxi.\n\nThe proposed class action lawsuit, filed in a Texas federal court Monday, says Tesla misled investors, failed to disclose problems with its long-in-the-works robotaxi service, and \"overstated the effectiveness of its autonomous driving technology.\"\n\n\"There was thus a significant risk that the Company's autonomous driving vehicles, including the Robotaxi, would operate dangerously and/or in violation of traffic laws,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nTesla debuted a test of its robotaxis \u2014 fully autonomous cars available through a ride-hailing service \u2014 on June 22.\n\nThere were some hiccups.\n\nAccording to videos posted by influencers and Tesla shareholder who participated in the test in Austin, some cars drove in the wrong lane, exceeded the speed limit, braked at inappropriate times, and had trouble parking without intervention. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it was looking into the irregularities depicted in videos.\n\nShareholders appeared unhappy: Tesla's stock price fell by 6.05% over June 24 and June 25, following reports about the videos and the NHTSA announcement, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit also points to the August 1 jury verdict in a Florida federal court over a deadly crash involving a Tesla on \"Autopilot\" mode.\n\nThe jury awarded the family of and her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, a combined $329 million in total damages. It found Tesla responsible for $242.5 million in combined punitive and compensatory damages in the case.\n\nMiguel Custodio, a personal injury attorney at Custodio & Dubey LLP, said that the jury verdict put the automated driving industry \"on notice.\"\n\n\"If their tech is not 1,000% safe or if the marketing is misleading in any way, there is serious legal and financial exposure,\" he told Business Insider before news of the shareholder lawsuit. \"Everyone welcomes new technology, but not if it is at the cost of human lives.\"\n\nIn addition to naming Tesla and Musk as defendants, the Monday shareholder lawsuit was also filed against Zachary Kirkhorn, who served as CFO until 2023, and the current CFO Vaibhav Taneja.",

      "text": "- Despite many smooth Tesla robotaxi rides, videos of hiccups are being shared online.\n- Autonomous driving experts are concerned about Tesla's \"camera-only\" approach and \"phantom braking.\"\n- The three autonomous driving experts told Business Insider about how they think the launch went.\nTesla's robotaxis are finally on the road \u2014 and on camera.\nThe lucky few who got to ride Tesla robotaxis after last month's launch posted videos of their rides online, and it didn't take long for viewers to identify possible errors by the driverless vehicles. Business Insider asked autonomous driving experts to review those videos and share their thoughts on what they saw, and what might need to be changed before Tesla scales up its long-awaited product.\nTesla's robotaxis launched on Sunday, June 22, in a limited area in Austin. Its \"early access rides\" were only available to a group of Tesla influencers and investors, who have been live-streaming and posting about their rides. Most of the rides appear to have gone smoothly, but there have been some hiccups.\nAccording to the posted videos, the list of robotaxi issues includes speeding more than 10 miles above the limit, driving into the wrong lane, incidents of random braking, issues with the pullover button, and at least two interventions from the safety monitor due to parking issues.\nThe three autonomous driving experts told Business Insider about how they think the launch went, and what may have prompted robotaxi issues caught on camera.\nBI called the influencers and investors to ask about their rides, but did not hear back. Tesla did not respond to a detailed request for comment from Business Insider.\nThe vision-only robotaxi design\nRobotaxi uses an advanced version of Tesla's Full Self\u2011Driving (FSD) software as its central system, complete with eight cameras installed around the vehicle to capture 360\u00b0 visual data. The vehicles do not use any radar or lidar, unlike competitor Waymo, whose cars rely on multiple ways to sense the environment.\nLidar uses laser light pulses to scan the environment, while radar detects objects with radio waves.\nRaj Rajkumar, professor of engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, told BI that while issues with pullover and even driving into the wrong lane could likely be fixed through more training data, incidents of what he described as \"phantom braking\" may have exposed a flaw in the robotaxi design.\nIn one video he saw, YouTuber Kim Java was on a robotaxi ride when, according to the video, it braked with nothing obstructing it, causing her belongings to fall to the floor.\nJava, a YouTuber specializing in tech and clean energy with more than 250 thousand subscribers, can be seen in the video saying, \"That's something that people have talked about being one of the limitations of Full Self-Driving with robotaxi,\" immediately after the braking incident.\n\"To process camera data, one has to use AI and machine learning,\" Rajkumar said. \"But hallucinations are an integral part of how AI operates, and once you hallucinate, phantom braking ends up happening, so a camera-only solution will not be sufficient for a very long time.\"\n\"Imagine being on the freeway at 65 mph and the car suddenly brakes for a phantom object, and there is an 18-wheeler semi truck behind you, and they cannot stop,\" Rajkumar added. \"It could be extremely dangerous, depending on what's happening around you.\"\nSteven Shladover, lead researcher at the Partners for Advanced Transportation Technology program at the University of California, Berkeley, told BI he is concerned that Tesla's camera-only approach without lidar or radar will eventually lead to passenger injuries without intervention.\nShladover reviewed a range of different Tesla robotaxi mishaps, including an apparent incident of speeding and veering into the wrong lane, in addition to the sudden braking.\n\"Automated driving needs a combination of sensor data from cameras, radars, and lidars, as well as precise localization relative to a high-accuracy digital map of the roadway environment and other data such as the local rules of the road and speed limits,\" said Shladover.\n\"Phantom braking\" is a known phenomenon in some Tesla software systems.\nTesla is facing a class-action lawsuit over alleged phantom braking in its Autopilot system, which is \"an advanced driver assistance system\" that is different from the supervised version of Full Self-Driving.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also launched an investigation into Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in 2022 after more than 750 drivers complained to the agency that their Teslas suddenly slammed on the brakes at high speeds while on Autopilot. The investigation and evaluation are still ongoing.\nIn the same year, a Tesla driver who told police they were using the supervised Full Self-Driving was caught in an eight-car pileup due to sudden and unexpected braking. CNN first reported this incident in December 2022, and Tesla did not respond to their requests for comments.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk addressed phantom braking complaints in 2020 on what was then Twitter, but he has not commented further since then.\n\"Is the issue of phantom braking fixed in this release?\" user EV-HQ asked in October 2020. \"Has been a number of people talking about this recently.\"\n\"It should be,\" Musk replied, following up with, \"Meant to say that it should be fixed in the latest wide release. Won't need to wait for FSD.\"\nTesla's robotaxis need more training\nAutonomous driving experts are saying \"not so fast\" when it comes to replacing human drivers entirely, especially for Tesla's robotaxis.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said prior to the launch that a human safety monitor would accompany each robotaxi in the passenger seat out of an abundance of caution.\nFrom what can be seen in the videos, the human monitor can halt the vehicle by pressing an \"In Lane Stop\" button on the touchscreen. This feature can be seen used in a video where a safety monitor stopped a robotaxi from colliding with a reversing UPS truck as the vehicle attempted to park itself.\nThe video in question is posted by Dave Lee, an early Tesla investor and a YouTuber with more than 230,000 subscribers.\n\"There are real robotaxis on American roads, but none is a Tesla,\" Bryant Walker Smith, a professor in engineering and law at the University of South Carolina, told BI. \"Tesla is still relying on safety drivers for its Austin demo \u2014 and rightly so, because its technology is immature.\"\n\"There is a huge difference between launching without safety drivers and testing or demoing with them, akin to climbing up a giant cliff with or without a harness and rope,\" Smith added.\nIt is common for autonomous vehicles to launch with a safety driver first. Waymo's early vehicles, including those in its public pilot programs, initially included a safety driver in the driver's seat. The Wayve self-driving car, which recently launched in London, also comes with a safety driver.\nIt is also common for robotaxis to experience incidents, even years after initial launch.\nIn 2024, Waymo recalled its vehicles twice, once for a fleet of 670 cars after an unoccupied robotaxi hit a telephone pole in Phoenix. Cruise's robotaxis repeatedly caused jams on city roads after launching in San Francisco in 2022. In 2023, a Cruise vehicle dragged a pedestrian initially hit by a human driver for an additional 20 feet instead of stopping, which led to the company's robotaxi business folding.\nRajkumar said that Tesla robotaxi is \"extremely geofenced\" to a region of Austin that, based on screenshots, seems to span 5.5 to 6 miles east to west and 3.5 to 4 miles north to south.\nWaymo, too, has limits on where it can go, and it is unable to drive freeways in most of the cities it operates in.\nRajkumar called the launch \"a good start,\" but said there is still a way to go before the Tesla robotaxi could handle unfamiliar situations on its own, completely free of human intervention.\n\"There is a very long list of things that happen in real life that we do not anticipate when we drive,\" Rajkumar said. \"But we are very intelligent creatures, we know how the world operates and we can decide to take action on it on the fly, even if it's something that we have never ever seen before.\""

      "text": "- Business Insider watched over two hours of Tesla robotaxi ride videos posted by early access riders.\n- The rides were mostly smooth. The robotaxi even made a smart move when a human in a Cybertruck didn't.\n- The service is limited to invited users, mostly Tesla influencers and shareholders.\nI watched over two hours of footage of Tesla's highly anticipated robotaxi service: I saw an Uber-like app experience, the in-vehicle interface, human supervisors, and miles of Austin streets.\nWhile the rides were mostly without incident, I noted a few hiccups from the newly launched autonomous vehicle \u2014 and at least one really smart move.\nAfter years of delays, Tesla's robotaxis were rolled out in Austin on June 22 to about a dozen invited users. The selected riders agreed to certain terms and are mostly Tesla influencers and shareholders.\nThese early access riders have been livestreaming and posting about their experiences since Sunday.\nBusiness Insider reviewed multiple videos posted by riders, and this is what we found so far.\nUser experience\nThe robotaxi ride-hailing app seems straightforward to use and reminiscent of the Uber app, complete with a map, a countdown of how long your wait would be, and even instructions on how to open the Tesla car door (in case you are unfamiliar with its press-and-open handle design). These features are well displayed in a video posted by YouTuber Justin Demaree, who goes by Bearded Tesla Guy on social media.\nFor now, each ride is priced at a $4.20 flat fee. Occasionally, the app may decline a ride due to \"high service demand,\" which happened at least once to Demaree, according to his video.\nThere is a geofence for robotaxis at the moment. Riders cannot go beyond the area that encircles Zilker, South Lamar, South Congress, East Riverside Otorff, and part of the Lakeshore and the Rainey Street Historic District, according to screenshots from Demaree. By comparison, Waymo's service range is about twice the size in Austin, where it also operates.\nThe early access rides are not human-free. Each robotaxi comes with a human in the front passenger seat to monitor the vehicle. No video that Business Insider has watched so far shows a significant intervention from the human supervisor.\nRobotaxis vehicles, which are right now the Tesla Model Y, have a rear screen for backseat passengers with a real-time map showing how far you are from the destination. For those with Tesla accounts, riders can also access existing playlists and podcasts from the rear screen.\nAccording to Sawyer Merritt, a Tesla investor with early access, the screen also automatically logs you out after you leave the robotaxi for privacy protection.\nFor those curious, Tesla\u2019s Robotaxi will automatically log out of all your apps when you exit the vehicle to maintain privacy.\n\u2014 Sawyer Merritt (@SawyerMerritt) June 23, 2025\nWhen you take your next ride, those apps will be automatically logged in when you enter the vehicle. pic.twitter.com/qcnCUGslGk\nWhat it did wrong\nIn a 17-minute ride to the Ann Richards School for Young Women Leaders in Austin, Rob Maurer, who used to run the \"Tesla Podcast,\" was briefly driven into the opposite lane by a robotaxi.\nThe robotaxi started to signal a left turn a few hundred feet ahead of an intersection, but once at the intersection, it decided against the turn and chose to continue straight instead, according to the video.\nIt crossed the double yellow lines and briefly entered lanes that belonged to cars heading in the opposite direction. The move prompted the car behind it to honk at it, but fortunately, from what can be seen on video, there was no oncoming traffic from the opposite side.\nDuring the same ride, the robotaxi also exceeded the 35-mph speed limit on multiple occasions, although most cars around it were also driving above the limit.\nSeparately, some passengers have found that robotaxis make dubious pick-up and drop-off decisions.\nIn a video posted by Demaree, the YouTuber who goes by Bearded Tesla Guy, he and his companion called a robotaxi that chose to pick them up by pulling into a handicapped parking space.\nIn a separate video posted on X, the two riders decided to test out the \"pullover\" button on the rear screen a block before they reached their destination. The move somehow brought the robotaxi to a stop in the middle of the road, even though it says it would pull over at a safe location. A call to a support agent who picked up within seconds eventually sent the robotaxi back on its way.\nTesla RoboTaxi First Public Ride Livestream https://t.co/2KIm1TiieI\n\u2014 Bearded Tesla (@BeardedTesla) June 22, 2025\nA spokesperson for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration told BI that the agency is aware of various robotaxi-related incidents and is in contact with Tesla to obtain more information. The agency also said that an investigation into Tesla's FSD-Supervised/Beta remains open.\n\"NHTSA does not pre-approve new technologies or vehicle systems \u2014 rather, manufacturers certify that each vehicle meets NHTSA's rigorous safety standards, and the agency investigates incidents involving potential safety defects,\" the spokesperson wrote.\nNHTSA looks into all autonomous vehicles, so Tesla is not the only company it is investigating.\nWhat it did right\nFrom the five videos BI has seen, the robotaxi is generally able to make smooth turns without unnecessary hesitation, and keeps a consistent distance between itself and the car ahead.\nIt also knows how to switch into a lane with fewer cars, brake for swerving cars, and yield on left turns.\nDespite occasionally exceeding speed limits, videos did not show it exceeding the limits by more than 5 mph, and it could be attempting to keep up with the general speed of other vehicles.\nDemaree's riding companion said during the ride that he thought the robotaxi's cautiousness when braking at the sight of pedestrians and cyclists had been \"cranked up a little bit.\" The robotaxi braked for a cyclist who would have been in its way had the cyclist not taken a turn in a different direction.\nIn the same video, the robotaxi also managed to get itself out of a sticky situation in a busy grocery store parking lot where the two riders were dropped off. It started out yielding to almost every car, but then the robotaxi asserted itself and was able to get out of the lot.\nTwo nighttime videos also showed notable robotaxi abilities.\nUnlike Waymo, Tesla's more established rival, robotaxis do not have lidar or radar. The vehicles are equipped with eight cameras and a version of the company's Full-Self Driving software that does not require a human behind the wheel. The FSD version available to Tesla owners is a driver-assistance system that requires a human driver's full attention.\nThere are indeed fewer cars on the road at night, but in both videos, the robotaxi made no critical errors in the low-light situations.\nIn one video posted by a tech influencer, who goes by Chrisbtech on TikTok, the robotaxi pulled over to the right side of the road when an ambulance with sirens blasting approached at full speed. Other drivers \u2014 including a human-driven Cybertruck in the next lane \u2014 did not pull over.\n@chrisbtech First Tesla Robotaxi pulling over for an ambulance!\n\u266c original sound - Chris\nOn Monday, Tesla shares rallied as much as 11% at their peak, before landing at 8% at 4 p.m. ET. The rally, however, did not continue through Tuesday.\nTesla, Rob Maurer, Justin Demaree, Sawyer Merrit, and the National Transportation Safety Board did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider."

      "text": "- Tesla is going to trial in Florida federal court over a wrongful-death lawsuit.\n- The suit blames Tesla and its Autopilot system for a 2019 crash that killed a 22-year-old woman.\n- A Tesla in Autopilot mode plowed into a parked SUV, killing the woman and injuring her boyfriend.\nFlorida couple Dillon Angulo and Naibel Benavides Leon were stargazing alongside a Key Largo road in 2019 when a Tesla Model S blew past a stop sign and a flashing red light at a three-way intersection and plowed into a parked SUV.\nBenavides Leon, 22, was killed and Angulo was seriously injured.\nThe Tesla's driver, George McGee, had Autopilot mode engaged at the time. He later said he had dropped his cell phone during a call and bent down to pick it up moments before his Tesla \u2014 without warning \u2014 T-boned Angulo's mother's Chevrolet Tahoe at about 60-miles-per-hour, according to court papers.\n\"Oh my God, I wasn't looking,\" McGee told a 911 operator after the April 25, 2019, crash, a judge's ruling said. \"I looked down and I've been using cruise control.\"\nIs Tesla and its Autopilot driver-assist system, which allows the vehicle to steer itself, switch lanes, brake, and accelerate on its own, to blame for the deadly collision?\nA Miami federal jury will soon consider that in a civil trial set to open Monday in the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida.\nBenavides Leon's family said in court filings that the impact of the crash threw the young woman about 75 feet.\nAt the trial, which is expected to last about three weeks, Tesla's safety features will once again come under the microscope. The electric-car company headed by billionaire Elon Musk could ultimately be ordered to pay out steep monetary damages if a jury finds it liable in the crash.\nLawyers for Tesla didn't immediately return a request for comment by Business Insider for this story, while attorneys for Benavides Leon's family and Angulo declined to comment.\nJudge said a reasonable jury could find Tesla acted recklessly\nBenavides Leon's estate initially sued Tesla over the crash in 2021 in Florida state court before the case was moved to federal court.\nIn March 2024, Benavides Leon's estate and Angulo filed an amended wrongful death complaint against Tesla, arguing in court papers that Tesla's vehicles were \"defective and unsafe for their intended use.\"\nTesla, the lawsuit said, programmed Autopilot \"to allow it to be used on roadways that Tesla knew were not suitable for its use and knew this would result in collisions causing injuries and deaths of innocent people who did not choose to be a part of Tesla's experiments, such as Plaintiffs.\"\n\"Despite knowing of Autopilot's deficiencies, Tesla advertised Autopilot in a way that greatly exaggerated its capabilities and hid its deficiencies,\" said the lawsuit, which pointed to multiple comments from Musk touting the safety and reliability of the software.\nUS District Judge Beth Bloom, who is overseeing the case, said last month in a 98-page order that the plaintiff's lawsuit can move ahead on design defect and failure to warn claims against Tesla. Bloom, however, sided with Tesla on the suit's claims of manufacturing defect and negligent misrepresentation and dismissed them.\nAdditionally, the judge ruled that the plaintiffs can seek punitive damages at trial.\n\"A reasonable jury could find that Tesla acted in reckless disregard of human life for the sake of developing their product and maximizing profit,\" Bloom wrote in her order.\nBloom said in her decision that the plaintiffs provided enough evidence \"affording a reasonable basis to conclude that, more likely than not, a defect in the Autopilot system was a substantial factor\" in the victims' injuries.\nTesla's attorneys have argued in court papers that McGee was solely responsible for the crash and that the collision could have been avoided by an \"attentive driver.\"\nThe company says on its website that Autopilot mode is \"intended for use with a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment.\"\n\"While these features are designed to become more capable over time, the currently enabled features do not make the vehicle autonomous,\" it says.\nAlthough Autopilot is designed to detect vehicles and obstacles, Tesla adds on its website that it is a driver's \"responsibility to always perform visual checks to make sure it is safe and appropriate to move into the target lane.\"\nThe judge said in her ruling that while McGee, who is not a defendant in the lawsuit, conceded that he was responsible for operating his 2019 Tesla \"safely and failed to do so, that does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that he alone is responsible for the resulting collision, particularly given McGee's testimony that he expected Autopilot to avoid the collision.\"\nBenavides Leon's estate and Angulo, the judge wrote, \"have adequately demonstrated that Autopilot's design led Tesla drivers, and McGee in particular, to become complacent and over rely on Autopilot to operate their vehicles.\"\nMcGee said in his deposition that he thought of Autopilot as a \"copilot\" and believed it would keep him in the lane, avoid crashes and direct him where he needed to go, according to Bloom's ruling. McGee previously settled a separate lawsuit with the plaintiffs.\nTesla sued several times over its Autopilot software\nIn recent years, Tesla has faced multiple lawsuits over its Autopilot driver-assist software and has come under increased scrutiny from regulators regarding the technology.\nThe carmaker, however, won two lawsuits in 2023 involving crashes where Autopilot was in use.\nIn one case \u2014 the first US trial over accusations that Tesla's Autopilot was responsible for a fatal crash \u2014 a California state jury found that Tesla was not liable for the 2019 incident that killed Tesla Model 3 owner, Micha Lee, and injured two passengers.\nAn attorney for Tesla argued at the trial that \"classic human error\" caused Lee's vehicle to veer off a highway. \"Autopilot makes a road safer. It is a good thing,\" the lawyer said.\nLast year, Tesla settled a wrongful-death lawsuit brought by the family of Apple engineer Walter Huang, who was killed in a 2018 fiery wreck when his Tesla Model X SUV smashed into a concrete barrier on a California highway as the vehicle was in Autopilot mode.\nThe case was settled for an undisclosed amount at the 11th hour, just before jury selection in the trial was set to begin."

      "text": "- A Florida jury found Tesla partly liable for a 2019 crash that left a 22-year-old woman dead.\n- The federal jury awarded the plaintiffs in the case $329 million in total damages.\n- Tesla, in a statement, called the verdict \"wrong\" and said it plans to appeal.\nIn a major blow to Tesla, a Florida federal jury on Friday found Elon Musk's electric car company partly to blame for a 2019 crash that left a 22-year-old woman dead and her boyfriend seriously injured.\nThe jury sided with the plaintiffs, awarding the family of Naibel Benavides Leon and her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, a combined $329 million in total damages \u2014 $129 million in compensatory damages and $200 million punitive damages.\nJurors, after about six hours of deliberations, awarded $59 million in compensatory damages to Benavides Leon's family and $70 million to Angulo, who suffered a traumatic brain injury and broken bones among other injuries.\nThe jury found Tesla 33% responsible for the crash, with the driver responsible for the rest. Tesla will have to pay the full punitive damages amount, and a third of the compensatory damages, which equals $42.5 million. That's a total payout of $242.5 million.\nThe verdict marks a major defeat for Tesla and its Autopilot driver-assistance feature that the attorneys for the plaintiffs said was engaged at the time of the deadly collision and had design flaws.\nTesla, in a statement, said it plans to appeal \"given the substantial errors of law and irregularities at trial.\"\n\"Today's verdict is wrong and only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla's and the entire industry's efforts to develop and implement life-saving technology,\" said Tesla.\nThe company added, \"To be clear, no car in 2019, and none today, would have prevented this crash. This was never about Autopilot; it was a fiction concocted by plaintiffs' lawyers blaming the car when the driver \u2014 from day one \u2014 admitted and accepted responsibility.\"\nThe plaintiff's attorney, Brett Schreiber, said the verdict \"represents justice for Naibel's tragic death and Dillon's lifelong injuries, holding Tesla and Musk accountable for propping up the company's trillion-dollar valuation with self-driving hype at the expense of human lives.\"\nThe verdict follows a three-week civil trial that included testimony from Angulo, Benavides Leon's family members, and the driver of the Tesla that plowed into a parked SUV and struck the couple as they were stargazing outside the vehicle alongside a Key Largo road.\nThe case stems from a wrongful-death lawsuit that the plaintiffs brought against Tesla. The lawsuit argued that the carmaker's vehicles were \"defective and unsafe for their intended use.\"\nTesla, the lawsuit said, programmed Autopilot \"to allow it to be used on roadways that Tesla knew were not suitable for its use and knew this would result in collisions causing injuries and deaths of innocent people who did not choose to be a part of Tesla's experiments, such as Plaintiffs.\"\n\"Despite knowing of Autopilot's deficiencies, Tesla advertised Autopilot in a way that greatly exaggerated its capabilities and hid its deficiencies,\" said the lawsuit, which pointed to multiple comments from Musk touting the safety and reliability of the software.\nTesla driver George McGee had Autopilot on when his 2019 Model S blew past a stop sign and a flashing red light at a three-way intersection and plowed into Angulo's mother's Chevrolet Tahoe at more than 60-miles-per-hour, the lawsuit said.\nMcGee \u2014 who previously settled a separate lawsuit with the plaintiffs for an undisclosed amount \u2014 said he had dropped his cellphone during a call and bent down to pick it up moments before his Tesla, without warning, T-boned the Tahoe.\nHe testified during the trial that he thought of Autopilot, which allows the vehicle to steer itself, switch lanes, brake, and accelerate on its own, as a \"copilot.\"\n\"My concept was it would assist me should I have a failure\" or \"should I make a mistake,\" McGee said in testimony, adding, \"I do feel like it failed me.\"\n\"I believe it didn't warn me of the car and the individuals and nor did it apply brakes,\" McGee testified.\nAttorneys for Tesla have argued that McGee was solely responsible for the April 25, 2019, crash.\nIn the trial's opening statements, Tesla attorney Joel Smith said the case was about a driver, not a \"defective vehicle,\" and had \"nothing to do with Autopilot.\"\n\"It's about an aggressive driver, not a complacent driver, a distracted driver who was fumbling around for his cellphone,\" Smith said. \"It's about a driver pressing an accelerator pedal and driving straight through an intersection.\"\nTesla's attorneys said that just before the crash, McGee hit the accelerator, overriding the vehicle's set cruising speed of 45 miles per hour and its ability to brake on its own.\nAutopilot mode, Tesla says on its website, is \"intended for use with a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment.\"\nSchreiber, the plaintiff's attorney, said in his opening statements that was McGee was a \"bad actor.\"\n\"But the evidence in this case will show that every actor needs a stage,\" Schreiber said. \"And Tesla set the stage for the preventable tragedy that brings us all here.\""

Trading on the NASDAQ, Tesla offered 13.3 million shares at a price of $17 per share. It raised a total of just over $226 million.\nTesla\u2019s stock price was essentially flat for several years after the 2010 IPO. There wasn\u2019t a lot going on. In 2008, the carmaker had endured a near-death experience, and in the lead-up to the IPO and afterwards, it was selling only one car, the original Roadster. The business plan at this point was for CEO Elon Musk and his team to keep the lights on long enough in order to roll out Tesla's first built-from-scratch car, the Model S sedan. Which eventually happened in 2012.\n| Name | Job |\n|---|---|\n| Robyn M.

  "argos_summary": "Tesla shareholders have filed a class-action lawsuit against the company and CEO Elon Musk, claiming they were misled about the safety and effectiveness of its robotaxi service, following reports of dangerous driving behavior during tests. The lawsuit references a recent jury verdict that found Tesla liable for a fatal crash involving its Autopilot system, resulting in a $329 million damages award. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is also investigating the irregularities observed in the robotaxi's performance.",
