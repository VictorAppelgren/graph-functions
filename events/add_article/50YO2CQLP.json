      "summary": "Six Flags, now the merged entity with Cedar Fair, reported a 9% drop in Q2 attendance and a $100 million revenue decline, prompting a downward 2025 outlook and the announcement that CEO Richard Zimmerman will step down. Analysts warn that the company may need to divest half its parks and could face bankruptcy, with current asset sales already underway (e.g., Six Flags America). Weather has been cited as a major factor, but executives insist the company will rebound in the second half of the year. The merger, completed in July 2024, has sparked shareholder opposition and a potential securities‑fraud lawsuit, while the company seeks new leadership and cost‑cutting measures.",
