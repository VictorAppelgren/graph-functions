  "content": "North Korea is taking inspiration from the West. In Pyongyang, elites drink coffee at a fake Starbucks and pay by mobile phone. About 100 miles away on the east coast, a seaside resort that\u2019s a pet project of the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, is stocked with foreign beers and decked out with water slides, ready to receive tourists.\n\nTo blunt the impact of international sanctions and bring in cash, North Korea is creating the look of prosperity by imitating its capitalist enemies.\n\nThe New York Times obtained footage from three recent visitors to the country: a Russian tourist, a Swedish marathon runner and a Chinese student. While the foreigners had North Korean chaperones and were not allowed to film construction sites and military personnel, they provided a rare glimpse into how Mr. Kim\u2019s modernization plans are nurturing a new culture of consumerism in one of the world\u2019s most isolated and authoritarian countries. The goods they encountered are out of reach for most North Koreans, who earn, on average, a little over $1,000 a year, according to South Korea.",
