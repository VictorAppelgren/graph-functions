  "description": "Square Enix has \"no choice but to act\" against some mods",
  "content": "Just last week, beloved Final Fantasy 14 plug-in Mare Synchronos was taken down following a so-called \"legal inquiry\" \u2013 but after a few days of radio silence from Square Enix on the subsequent drama, director Naoki \"Yoshi-P\" Yoshida has finally made an official statement in response.\n\nThe full announcement from the MMO lead is found on the official Final Fantasy 14 website, titled \"Regarding Mod Usage and Culture,\" and we'd encourage you to read it in full.\n\nYoshi-P opens by declaring that \"this post is not meant to target any one mod specifically,\" but to touch on the general subject of mods, their use, and the \"culture surrounding them,\" writing that he isn't just the game's director \u2013 he says he's \"also a PC gamer, and have been for many years.\"\n\nHe then outlines how he's seen \"numerous positive examples of games with fan-made mods that expand upon existing gameplay,\" but \"these mods are generally created with a vital premise in mind: they are for personal use only, and the individual player is responsible for the mods they use. Furthermore, the mods must not impact the core game, its services, or the intended game design in a negative manner.\"\n\nWhen it comes to Final Fantasy 14, Yoshi-P states that he ultimately doesn't mind if players use mods, as long as they follow two rules: \"that their style of gameplay does not infringe upon others, and that they do not negatively impact the core game, its services, or intended game design.\"\n\nThe director then moves on to more specific examples \"on what 'infringing upon others and 'negatively impacting the intended game design' entail\" \u2013 particularly within the realm of altering character or items' appearances.\n\nThat's where the lead brings up hardcore raiding, including the likes of Savage and Ultimate duties. While many players, myself included, admittedly, strive to complete such raids in the hopes of obtaining special gear or new titles, not everyone wants to (or can, really) put in the amount of effort and time required to emerge successful. That's why they may instead opt to employ the use of cosmetic mods to glam up their Warriors of Light.\n\nAlthough that's apparently okay, it's only okay if others can't see their modded cosmetics, as it \"considerably negates the cooperation, time, and effort invested, not to mention the pride they might have felt in their achievement\" for those who earn the glams or titles via gameplay. \"In this example,\" as Yoshi-P puts it, \"other players have been infringed upon, and the intended design of the game has been negatively impacted.\"\n\nIn such scenarios, the director says mods' usage \"has diminished other players' motivation and circumvented the game's systems.\" This rings true because, he says, \"Even if the creator of the mod simply intended for players to readily access and enjoy their favorite gear, they have detrimentally affected both the game and the wider player community.\"\n\nFans of mods like Mare Synchronos may be wondering \u2013 I know I was \u2013 how this is the case if all parties have the same add-on, which would imply they've consented to seeing others' modded outfits. Yoshi-P addresses this, explaining, \"The issue is that any mod which makes changes visible to others requires the manipulation or rewriting of game files, which is fundamentally even more problematic and destructive.\"\n\nEven if a mod \"provided generous improvements to the game and was well received by all players, the moment a problematic feature is introduced to said mod,\" he writes that Square Enix \"must insist that players stop using it.\" It doesn't all boil down to fairness for raiders, however \u2013 the next point Yoshi-P makes is controversial at best: the Mog Station. We hate to love it, we love to hate it\u2026 but it's a contributing factor here.\n\nAppearance-related mods might allow fans to equip items they'd otherwise have to pay real money for via the online shop, the Mog Station. \"What does that say to the players who go through the trouble of saving up to purchase these goods from the FFXIV Online Store? Are these players losing out by not using a mod?\"\n\nYou might be readying your virtual pitchforks now, saying, \"Square Enix is to blame for trying to make money by demanding that players spend extra on optional items.\" According to Yoshi-P, though, the company has good reasons to operate an online shop like the Mog Station.\n\nBetween \"global inflation\" and server costs, developers have a lot to cover, and it's not cheap. \"We do not want to increase subscription fees for players, if at all possible \u2013 but keeping our game running requires sufficient income,\" as the lead states. \"If we start creating a deficit, FFXIV may no longer be able to operate.\"\n\nI'm not personally sure whether I fully believe the Mog Station is necessary to curb costs or avoid hiking the subscription fees in a world in which we pay for the base game and every expansion pack, but it does evidently play a role in devs' decision-making surrounding mods. After all, Yoshi-P does say they \"are given no choice but to act if mods even incidentally threaten player motivation or the viability of our services.\"\n\nThe final potential problem mods like Mare Synchronos or other cosmetic add-ons may result in is a tad more\u2026 NSFW. It's no secret that roleplayers and other fans use such third-party tools to spice, if you will, their games up a bit \u2013 but Final Fantasy 14 \"itself may be subject to legal measures by regulators in certain countries,\" so things like visible nudity are a no-go, especially as \"laws that regulate the content of video games grow stricter by the year.\"\n\nYoshi-P may be referring to situations like the recent crackdown on adult games and the ever-changing British legality surrounding online access to NSFW material. \"These laws are there to protect minors and for a variety of other reasons, but the fact remains that they are tangibly becoming stricter,\" he concludes. The potential inability \"to provide our services in adherence to the laws of all countries where FF14 is available\" is \"another example of damage dealt to our services.\"\n\nThere's no telling what this means for other cosmetic mods, or whether Mare Synchronos will ever resurface, but I wouldn't hold my breath. On a brighter note, Yoshi-P is \"also considering how to increase the freedom of choice players have in the gear they choose to equip.\"\n\nFinal Fantasy 14 Dawntrail left the MMO's community fatigued and fed up, so Yoshi-P says devs are \"planning to upgrade\" new content that \"can be enjoyed by a wide variety of different players\"",

      "text": "Infamous Final Fantasy 14 plugin that could enable stalking reportedly hit with a cease and desist, with all player data \"permanently and irreversibly deleted\"\nFiles have been taken down, but concerned players still worry about the larger issue that remains\nAn infamous Final Fantasy 14 plugin that MMO fans warned could enable stalking and harassment has now been shut down after those behind it apparently received a cease and desist.\nEarlier this year, despite Final Fantasy 14's Dawntrail expansion adding new blacklist features to help combat issues like harassment in the MMORPG, it was discovered that the addition had made it so that each player had a unique account ID broadcasted to the game's client. Third-party mods and plugins could be used to essentially link characters to their player IDs, making it possible to track down any player's alternate accounts in the process, enabling stalking in the game. A prominent example of such was a plugin called PlayerScope.\nSquare Enix had previously addressed this, having reassured fans that such tools couldn't access things like payment information, and later made a change in patch 7.2, saying that \"to help prevent the identification of account IDs that are not displayed in-game, relevant saved client data has been reset.\" However, players quickly discovered that it was \"very easy\" to reverse the new efforts to hide account IDs, and thus, concerns weren't really alleviated.\nFast forward to today, and a different form of action has seemingly been taken. In a message allegedly taken from Discord (that's been posted to Reddit), it's explained: \"Due to a formal cease and desist notice I received, I've made the decision to permanently shut down the PlayerScope project and all of its supporting infrastructure.\"\nThe PlayerScope developer states that \"the web backend has been taken offline,\" while \"all stored data, including character and user records have been permanently and irreversibly deleted.\" Meanwhile, files for the plugin have been \"completely removed from GitHub and FitFlic, and have also been fully erased from my personal server.\"\nMoving forward, \"there will be no further updates, support, or development from my side, and I am officially stepping away from plugin development entirely,\" the dev continues. \"If any versions of the plugin continue to circulate elsewhere, please be aware that they are not authorized or associated with me in any way.\"\nThat latter point is something which players reacting to the news on Reddit are still wary of, however \u2013 even if PlayerScope is gone, that doesn't mean that other similar plugins can't be used for the same purpose. Sure, the people running them might be a bit scared about doing so after seeing action taken against the main mod, but unless Square Enix can ensure that there's no way to link player IDs with alternate accounts (or view player IDs in the first place, really), then there's still a risk there.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\n\"This doesn't actually solve anything unless they patch the issue that allowed the plugin to exist in the first place, it's a completely hollow gesture,\" one concerned player writes. \"Other databases for the plugin already exist and anyone can and will continue to use them or make new ones until it's patched.\"\n\"Someone probably already has a backup made. While legal threats can slow it down, unless SE implements a better blacklist, this isn't going away,\" says another.\nIt's still a positive thing to see Square Enix take concerns seriously like this, though. Way back in January, director and producer Naoki \"Yoshi-P\" Yoshida revealed that the team was internally discussing \"requesting that the tool in question be removed and deleted\" and potentially \"pursuing legal action,\" so it's not like this development has come out of nowhere.

      "text": "Final Fantasy 14 killed one plugin that enabled player stalking, and now Square Enix is making sure \"prohibited third-party tools\" stay broken as MMO boss Yoshi-P says he \"would appreciate your patience as we resolve this issue\"\nThird time's the charm\nEvery time a developer touches a game, a new vulnerability for unscrupulous characters to exploit may appear. Final Fantasy 14 inadvertently fell foul of that by making it easier for players to stalk each other, even across different characters, with the release of Dawntrail. While one of the most infamous plugins responsible has been shut down, though, Square Enix is now implementing its latest fix to resolve the issue for good.\nLast year, Final Fantasy 14 introduced a blacklist feature that assigned each player a unique ID, allowing it to be tracked across all their characters and accounts. The intention was to combat toxic individuals wholesale, rather than just one of their characters. Still, the result was plugins that could access this backend data, allowing anyone to digitally stalk anyone throughout the world of Eorzea.\nLast month, the developer behind one of the MMO's most infamous plugins was hit with a cease and desist. Their plugin, PlayerScope, is now gone, and all our data with it, but the work to safeguard the MMO from another like it rumbles on.\n\"In Patch 7.3, we will be making even more significant changes to further obscure data that may potentially be used to determine whether characters belong to the same account,\" writes Naoki Yoshida, producer and director of Final Fantasy 14, in a post on the game's website.\nHe adds that this change will affect some tools currently in use, however. Firstly, your mute list will be deleted, so if there were any annoyingly chatty players you were avoiding, you'll have to re-add them. Each individual character, too, as you can no longer simply mute a player's account. The post does note that \"The blacklist feature will continue to function on an account-wide basis.\"\nAny notes you've added to your blacklist will also be deleted due to the restructuring of the data, which aims to keep information hidden from third-party tools. So, you'll have to add all that again.\nYoshida adds, \"The team is preparing safeguards to further enhance the security of data associated with the blacklist feature,\" and he \"wanted to offer my apologies ahead of these improvements, which necessitate resetting certain data and may cause some frustration for our players.\"\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\n\"I'm glad to see they're still working on it,\" writes one player on Reddit. Some aren't convinced, though. \"I remain pessimistic of their changes here, given their history.

Valve has since expanded on the situation in a new press release to multiple sources, including GamingOnLinux and Rock Paper Shotgun. \"We were recently notified that certain games on Steam may violate the rules and standards set forth by our payment processors and their related card networks and banks,\" it writes.\n\"As a result, we are retiring those games from being sold on the Steam Store, because loss of payment methods would prevent customers from being able to purchase other titles and game content on Steam,\" explains Valve. \"We are directly notifying developers of these games, and issuing app credits should they have another game they'd like to distribute on Steam in the future.\" Many games have already been affected by the pressure from payment processors.\nJudging by the information available on SteamDB, over 100 games have been marked as \"retired\" from Valve's storefront in just two days \u2013 many of which are titles with adult-only content. Some were taken down from the platform literally minutes ago, too, so it's evident the situation is ongoing, and the removal of releases that \"violate\" banks' standards is a process rather than a one-off move. Unsurprisingly, PC gamers aren't sure how to feel about it all.\nA recent Reddit thread on the matter proves as much, with many expressing confusion. One admits, \"I don't even understand what issues payment processors have with porn games.\" Others point out that many of the retired games thus far feature controversial sexual themes and terms, like \"incest.\" As of now, though, there's no telling how many developers will be affected by the Steam removals \u2013 but if the last couple of days are anything to go by, it'll probably be a lot.\nHere are some of the most exciting new games this year and beyond to keep an eye on.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nAfter spending years with her head in various fantastical realms' clouds, Anna studied English Literature and then Medieval History at the University of Edinburgh, going on to specialize in narrative design and video game journalism as a writer.

No longer can we roleplay in our wildest modded outfits and feel overjoyed knowing that our fellow Warriors of Light see our flashy low-cut tops and neons. Mare Synchronos, the so-called \"third-party tool,\" as Square Enix so lovingly dubs add-ons and mods, has been taken down following what its creator says was a \"legal inquiry.\" Fans are flagging the situation on platforms like Reddit, and they're understandably upset.\nOne thread sees its poster share the Mare Synchronos creator's Discord message regarding the takedown, and thousands of disappointed responses. \"So many nightclub owners just dropped to their knees,\" writes a fan, amusingly \u2013 although they're not wrong. Another states the mod mastermind's announcement that they must start \"winding it down\" following legal inquiries, \"seems like it was out of nowhere.\"\nAnother online post sees similar reactions from the community, with a commenter assuming, \"Square Enix messing with their freaky fanbase is a bold strategy, let's see if it pays off.\" It's important to note, though, that those who ERP (erotic roleplay, for those fortunate enough not to yet know what that acronym stands for), are definitely not the only people who employ the use of Mare Synchronos. Even if replies share jokes that this is a \"gooner genocide.\"\nFinal Fantasy XIV Mod, Mare Synchronos, is shutting down from r/ffxiv\nWhen you use mods to style your character, whether for hair or for clothes, it's nice to have your fashion on display \u2013 and Mare Synchronos allowed for just that. With over 20,000 users, it's safe to say fans like the add-on for a variety of reasons\u2026 and it's unsurprising that players are unhappy with its sudden takedown. They're not only taking to forums to highlight their dissatisfaction with Square Enix's potential actions, however.\nThe official Steam page for Final Fantasy 14 currently sees the MMO sitting with \"Mixed\" reviews \u2013 and yes, the recent influx of negative feedback is due in part to the removal of Mare Synchronos. \"RIP Moon [Mare Synchronos], canceled my sub I've been paying for,\" reads one such review. \"Without Moon, it's not worth it for me personally.\" Another fan simply writes that their negative review is due to \"banned mods.\"\nThere's no telling what the future holds for Mare Synchronos and other beloved third-party Final Fantasy 14 tools, plug-ins, add-ons, mods, or whatever you'd like to call them, but for now, it seems that our games will look a little more dull (albeit more SFW) and our Warriors of Light a little less frilly. Here's hoping fashionistas, gpose enthusiasts, nightclub owners, roleplayers, and modders alike prevail.\nWhile you're here, have a browse through some of the other most exciting new games coming this year and beyond to keep an eye on.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nAfter spending years with her head in various fantastical realms' clouds, Anna studied English Literature and then Medieval History at the University of Edinburgh, going on to specialize in narrative design and video game journalism as a writer.

Casual players felt that there was a lot to do in the hardcore realm, but not in their own, and vice versa.\nYoshi-P admits, \"So that has been my direction, wherein I wanted to create a clear direction of the type of content for each type of player in our player base.\" When developers look at things from the outside, they may see \"that there is a large variety of content in the game\" \u2013 but when they step into fans' shoes, where it looks as though there are 10 types of content, \"there might only be three types of content for that player.\"\nOn the other hand, another player might see those 10 and only register \"four types of content for me.\" Put simply, it's more of a subjective experience than the objective one devs would like it to be \u2013 but Square Enix is taking this into account: \"Looking back at this feedback that we've received, I want to make a major change in our policy of content release, and we have been spending a lot of resources on developing the various types of content in the game.\"\nThe director and MMO's overall team \"want to make sure that players do take the time to play the content and enjoy it\" \u2013 hence the ongoing focus on variety. \"We want to have content which can be enjoyed by a wide variety of different players,\" as Yoshi-P outlines. \"With that in mind, I would say that we are planning to upgrade our content release as it were.\" Devs want to take all of the mixed Dawntrail reviews into account for said upgraded releases.\n\"This feedback that we've received in the past one or so years has been a big learning [point] for us, so we do want to take this in to provide more interesting experiences for the players.\" As a longtime player, both casual and hardcore, I'm intrigued to learn more about what this so-called \"upgrade\" to future content will look like.\nYoshi-P also recently revealed that there could be fewer content drops in favor of \"many more players\" being able to enjoy what Square Enix does cook up \u2013 so there's no telling how it'll all play out. One thing we can expect, now that Final Fantasy 14's Dawntrail story has concluded, is that \"the fate of the world\" will be on your shoulders once more, narratively speaking.\nBe sure to check the Gamescom 2025 schedule for a quick rundown of the most exciting new games announced, or browse through our recap of Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 and the Future Games Show at Gamescom 2025 as well.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nAfter spending years with her head in various fantastical realms' clouds, Anna studied English Literature and then Medieval History at the University of Edinburgh, going on to specialize in narrative design and video game journalism as a writer.

      "text": "Regarding Mod Usage and Culture\n* We request the cooperation of media outlets and those intending to repost this comment elsewhere: Please do not summarize or provide only excerpts. We respectfully ask that you link readers to this comment instead.\nHello, everyone. Producer and Director Naoki Yoshida here. I'd like to address the recent feedback and discussion among the community regarding in-game mods.\nThis post is not meant to target any one mod specifically, but I'd like to touch on the general subject of mods, their use, and the culture surrounding them. I thank you in advance for your understanding.\nFirstly, while I am in charge of FFXIV, I am also a PC gamer, and have been for many years. I've spoken about this multiple times in the past, but my own personal stance regarding mods\u2500that I do tolerate them\u2500has not changed.\nIn the past twenty or so years, I've seen numerous positive examples of games with fan-made mods that expand upon existing gameplay.\nHowever, these mods are generally created with a vital premise in mind: they are for personal use only, and the individual player is responsible for the mods they use. Furthermore, the mods must not impact the core game, its services, or the intended game design in a negative manner. I personally feel that these rules should be followed by all mod creators and users.\nThat being said, if players continue to uphold the above premise of mods enhancing one's personal enjoyment of the game and acknowledge that they are taking responsibility for what they download, I personally see no reason to track down or investigate gamers for the general use of mods.\nOf course, from my position leading FFXIV, I still feel that it is vital for players to follow our user agreement and other rules. Additionally, I'd like to stress the importance that players follow two rules: that their style of gameplay does not infringe upon others, and that they do not negatively impact the core game, its services, or intended game design, as mentioned above.\nIt is my sincerest hope that everyone can continue playing FFXIV, as well as other PC games, in ways that are enjoyable to them.\nBelow, I'd like to elaborate on what \"infringing upon others\" and \"negatively impacting the intended game design\" entail. These are merely examples, so I don't mind if you skip over them. Please keep in mind that these theoretical examples do not single out any particular mod. Furthermore, this is not a criticism of those who create or use mods\u2500the following is meant to deepen everyone\u2019s understanding of our stance on this matter.\nAltering Item and Character Appearances\nIn FFXIV, we have several extremely high-end duties that challenge players to their limit, known as Ultimate raids. To defeat the enemies within these raids, players must dedicate a significant amount of time and effort. As their reward for clearing, they earn the title of \"Legend,\" as well as job-specific weapons with specialized visual effects.\nLet's say Player A loves Ultimate raids and is motivated to challenge them at every opportunity. After they clear, they proudly equip their new title and weapon as proof of their party's diligent efforts to earn them.\nMeanwhile, we have Player B, who makes use of a specific mod. This mod allows them to bypass the conditions for obtaining in-game items, making it possible for them to equip any item in the game (including items that must be purchased with real money). Player B is busy with work, and although they have the motivation, their circumstances prevent them from progressing through any of the Ultimate raids. They decide instead to install a mod, so that they can at least see what it looks like to have their own character equipped with one of the Ultimate raid weapons.\nPlayer B uses said mod to equip a set of items, which only displays on their client's screen. To other players, Player B's model is only wearing default gear, but on Player B's monitor, they're equipped with a dazzling Ultimate weapon. They take a screenshot of their character and decide to use it as their desktop background.\nIn this case, Player A has followed the rules of the game and worked hard with their party to clear the Ultimate raid, earning themselves a weapon and a title as evidence of their feat. When other players come across Player A using their title and Ultimate weapon, they see a \u201cLegend\u201d who has overcome one of the game\u2019s most punishing duties. On the other hand, should they encounter Player B, they would simply see a character with their default gear.\nLet\u2019s imagine a scenario in which Player A and B cross paths in-game. On Player B\u2019s screen, Player A appears with their brand-new title and Ultimate weapon\u2500the same weapon that they appear to themselves as having equipped. Conversely, on Player A\u2019s screen, Player A appears with their title and hard-won weapon, while Player B appears in their default gear.\nIn other words, Player A sees the rewards each player has earned fairly within the context of the game\u2019s rules. Player B sees a modified version of the game, but these changes are visible only to Player B themselves, and thus fall within the realm of individual enjoyment. (Please note that this is not intended as a judgment on the virtue of one approach versus the other.)\nSimilarly, if a player chooses to install a mod, the risk of encountering a computer virus, for example, is borne by the individual. Additionally, mods that do not adversely affect other players, and which ensure visual changes are only visible to the individual user, can be said to narrowly maintain the integrity of the game\u2019s design\u2500although, of course, this is open to interpretation.\nHowever, if a mod was updated and its changes became visible not just to the individual mod user, but to other players too, what would the implications be? Player A (with their title and gear earned from hours of concerted effort with their friends) and Player B (with their mod-derived gear), are now on a level playing field, so to speak. This development may not concern Player B, but for Player A, it considerably negates the cooperation, time, and effort invested, not to mention the pride they might have felt in their achievement. After all, their rewards are now available to anyone with the mod installed, albeit lacking the corresponding in-game attributes.\nIn this example, other players have been infringed upon, and the intended design of the game has been negatively impacted. Although Player B may have been unaware of the mod\u2019s precise functionality, their usage has diminished other players\u2019 motivation and circumvented the game\u2019s systems. Even if the creator of the mod simply intended for players to readily access and enjoy their favorite gear, they have detrimentally affected both the game and the wider player community.\nIn response, our only options would be to ask that players cease using the mod, or to request that the mod creator removes the functionality causing the problem. Of course, we could also implement preventative measures in-game, but this would divert programming resources from other areas, potentially damaging the enjoyment of other players in the long run.\nThe scenario outlined above is just one example, but I hope it helps clarify the differences between mod usage within the realm of individual enjoyment, and mod usage which is damaging to the game itself. Some players might ask \u201cwell, what about a mod which only makes changes visible to other users of the same mod?\u201d The issue is that any mod which makes changes visible to others requires the manipulation or rewriting of game files, which is fundamentally even more problematic and destructive.\nEven supposing that this theoretical mod provided generous improvements to the game and was well received by all players, the moment a problematic feature is introduced to said mod, we must insist that players stop using it.\nAnother example of such a feature: a mod that allows players to freely equip optional items and display them to others. What does that say to the players who go through the trouble of saving up to purchase these goods from the FFXIV Online Store? Are these players losing out by not using a mod?\nSome may say that Square Enix is to blame for trying to make money by demanding that players spend extra on optional items. We operate our servers and data centers twenty-four hours a day, three-hundred-sixty-five days a year with the hope that our players can enjoy a reliable gaming experience. Currently, global inflation is taking its toll at a rapid pace, driving up server electricity costs, the cost of land, and even the price of servers themselves. We do not want to increase subscription fees for players, if at all possible\u2500but keeping our game running requires sufficient income. If we start creating a deficit, FFXIV may no longer be able to operate. This is an example of damage dealt to the services we provide.\nIn these cases as well, we ask that players refrain from using such mods, or remove the offending function from the mod itself. I personally understand that modding culture is rooted in good intentions, but we are given no choice but to act if mods even incidentally threaten player motivation or the viability of our services.\nLet's consider another theoretical mod: one that displays your character entirely naked. If this presentation is displayed only on the user's screen, that might fall into the category of personal use and responsibility. (Bear in mind that this is my personal interpretation, and not a discussion of whether that behavior is right or wrong.) However, if the user posts a screenshot of their naked character publicly on social media, FFXIV itself may be subject to legal measures by regulators in certain countries.\nLaws that regulate the content of video games grow stricter by the year. These laws are there to protect minors and for a variety of other reasons, but the fact remains that they are tangibly becoming stricter. We have a duty to provide our services in adherence to the laws of all countries where FFXIV is available, and if we are unable to do so, the distribution of our game can be prohibited. This is another example of damage dealt to our services.\nAllow me to repeat myself when I say that I do not intend for these examples to be a censure of mod users or creators. I only wish to provide some tangible examples of how using certain mods can damage other players, FFXIV, and the services we provide, regardless of the mod's original intent.\nAs always, we will do our utmost to keep creating a world which all players can enjoy. Even though it may take time to do so, it is my hope to incorporate player feedback and officially fulfill as many functionality requests as possible. I am also considering how to increase the freedom of choice players have in the gear they choose to equip.\nWhile paying respect to the long-standing tradition of modding PC games, I ask that all players in turn respect our game by enjoying their fun within the confines of some basic rules.\nWith that business aside, I was very pleased to announce the next Fan Festival yesterday, on the twelfth anniversary of FFXIV. This wouldn't have been possible without you, our players. Thank you all so much for your support thus far, and we hope to have the pleasure of your company as we continue along this incredible journey for years to come.\n(And one more thing: for those wondering what comes after the Japan Fan Fest...while I can't give any details just yet, rest assured you won't have to wait long.)\nFINAL FANTASY XIV Producer & Director\nNaoki Yoshida"
