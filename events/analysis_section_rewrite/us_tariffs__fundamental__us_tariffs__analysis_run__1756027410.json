      "feedback": "This draft synthesizes several relevant sources, but to reach world-class quality you should restructure into a formal, multi‑year regime map anchored by first‑principles and explicit regime conditions, tightly link causal chains to market pricing, and quantify with the cited numbers; specifically, start with a concise invariant framework (horizon: multi‑year structural) built on five anchors: terms of trade and policy reaction function (tariff regimes and deregulation), real rate differentials and BoP risk, productivity and supply‑chain reconfiguration, external finance/portfolio flows through payments tech, and the per‑country regulatory state’s persistence (draw these from RHFWI02JT for tariff framework, 9W8ZUIBDY for deregulation/competition order, QRX2HD4X0 for fintech/capital‑flow implications, 2SJORBV6H for exogenous protectionism like Japan’s anti‑dumping, and 5M9M1KACF for Intel/CHIPS‑Act governance). Then replace the current narrative with a regime map (Baseline, Escalation, Deregulation/Policy Reversal, and Geopolitics Shock) with clear transition triggers and invalidation conditions: e.g., Trigger A: steel tariff quota talks falter; Trigger B: EU exemption timetable misses the agreed timeline; Trigger C: CRA‑style rule reversals accelerate or legal challenges succeed; Trigger D: equity‑stake/foreign‑policy actions on semiconductors crystallize into durable policy. For each regime, state the transmission to prices, production, and capital: tariff pass‑through to consumer prices (cite 1.8% short‑run price lift and 18.6% import tariff burden from RHFWI02JT; translate to regime‑dependent pass‑through bands), production plans (e.g., Adyen’s embedded‑finance dynamics in QRX2HD4X0 show how payments platforms can reprice/services in cross‑border trade, a channel plausible under tariff stress), and capital allocation (Intel CHIPS Act governance and potential state equity as in 5M9M1KACF). Tighten the base case with explicit numbers from sources only: 15% broad EU tariff with zero on cars and exemptions (RHFWI02JT), near‑term 1.8% aggregate price impact (RHFWI02JT), 18.6% tariff burden (RHFWI02JT), Adyen’s H1 metrics (€1,093.5m net revenue, 20% YoY; 28% EBITDA growth) as a demonstration of how payments platforms can absorb shocks and reallocate capital (QRX2HD4X0), and Japan’s anti‑dumping probe as a cross‑border protection‑ism signal (2SJORBV6H). Reconcile conflicts by explicitly mapping each claim to its source, e.g., acknowledge Biden‑era competition rhetoric (9W8ZUIBDY) while treating Trump’s market‑friendly deregulation (Unleashing Prosperity framework) as a regime‑level risk that could reverse or coexist with prior rules (cite Forbes pieces in 9W8ZUIBDY and 4). Replace the single paragraph causal chain with a compact, tabular or bullet‑dense regime map (without leaving gaps) that ends with a base case, a short list of principal risks (tariff escalation, legal challenges to tariffs, regulatory reversals with CRA, and geopolitical disputes on semiconductors), what to watch (cadence of tariff announcements/exemptions, steel quota outcomes, Intel CHIPS governance developments, and Adyen’s geographic expansion signals), and a stated confidence level. Finally, tighten the prose toward clarity and discipline: every assertion should point to a specific ID, every numerical claim should be anchored to a cited figure, and the tone should emphasize regime dynamics and probabilistic pathways rather than a static snapshot. Actionable edits: insert an invariants box, add a regime‑map section with triggers/invalidations, recast the causal chain as regime‑specific transmission to prices/investment, explicitly quantify pass‑through and price‑level effects using RHFWI02JT figures, integrate cross‑border financing channels via QRX2HD4X0, reconcile regulatory/deregulatory narratives with 9W8ZUIBDY and the CRA piece (5), and add a concise watchlist with a short‑range and a multi‑year horizon.",
