      "feedback": "This draft shows solid regime framing and many credible Ford data points (EV loss ≈ $1.3B, adj. margin ≈ 4.3%, ROIC ≈ 10.1%, forward P/E ≈ 10.3, dividend ~5%), but it does not yet meet SECTION FOCUS as a world‑class swing view: you pepper the piece with non‑Ford assets, you include an extra “Long” line, and you fail to deliver the exact 4 movers (2 Up, 2 Down) plus a 1–2 line Outlook in the required format with clean, first‑principles causal ties. Actionable edits: (1) drop all non‑Ford sections/assets (Shopify, Moscow note, IPOs, ETFs, etc.) or relegate them to a separate framing that clearly ties back to Ford risk/return; (2) implement exactly four Movers: Up 3–6 months; Up 6–12 months; Down 3–6 months; Down 3–6 months. Each line must be: Direction | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability % (anchored to material) with in‑line citations after any quantitative claim (e.g., 22PL3Q360; 65UUBU0OR); (3) remove the standalone “Long” line and replace the Swing‑Trade plan with a single Outlook line if Ford is tradable, or two lines max if you must show alternatives. The Outlook line(s) should read: Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence %. Use a Ford‑specific trigger (e.g., EV margin inflection crossing a defined threshold, tariff relief timing, or a real‑rate regime shift) and attach explicit invalidation rules per line (e.g., EV margin fails to inflect by QX, tariff relief delayed beyond Y months). (4) hard‑bind the causal chain to first principles: state the invariants (ROIC vs WACC, real‑rate/discount rate, tariff/monetary policy) and map each mover to a concrete catalyst and an invalidation path; (5) quantify, not narrate: quote or bind every assertion to a source number (EV loss, ROIC, margin, P/E, dividend) and reconcile any conflicts by selecting a base case and listing a one‑line alt interpretation with its own trigger rather than mixing them in the four movers. (6) tighten the watchlist and catalysts to Ford‑specific milestones only (Model E cash flow, EV‑margin milestones, tariff/news flow, real‑rate trajectory) and drop or clearly segregate JD Power quality signals unless they explicitly drive valuation or cash flow in the base case. (7) ensure the probability bands are defensible from the cited evidence (e.g., Up 3–6m ≈ 25%, Up 6–12m ≈ 30%, Down 3–6m ≈ 30%, Down 3–6m ≈ 15% with citations) and label any subjective weighting; (8) prune the final macro/regime paragraphs unless you recast them as a concise, Ford‑only attachment to the base case, with a single, crisp line for the Swing Trade Outlook. Applied cleanly, the 4 movers should mirror the core numbers and catalysts from 22PL3Q360 and 65UUBU0OR, use exact, sourced citations after factual lines, and deliver a tight, asset‑centric Swing Trade (if Ford is tradable) or a concise Outlook line (if not).",
