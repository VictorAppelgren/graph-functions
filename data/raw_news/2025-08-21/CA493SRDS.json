  "description": "Apple TV+ has increased its price yet again. Find out the new cost of an Apple TV+ monthly subscription inside.",
  "content": "Apple TV+ has made another big change to its price tag. Per Apple, Apple TV+ will raise the price for streaming subscriptions in the U.S. and international markets by 30% starting August 21, 2025. This will bring the cost up from $9.99 per month to $12.99. Current Apple TV+ customers will see this new subscription cost within 30 days of their next renewal date.\n\nIn an official statement, Apple claimed that it had to raise streaming prices due to the launch of recent movies and shows on Apple TV+ without ads.\n\n\u201cSince it launched, Apple TV+ has expanded its deep library of hundreds of Apple Originals, with thousands of hours of premium programming across genres and brand-new releases weekly \u2014 all ad-free,\u201d said Apple. \u201cSubscribers can explore a rich offering of thrilling dramas, epic sci-fi, feel-good comedies, and live sports.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Apple TV+ has hiked up its prices. In October 2023, the streaming platform raised its monthly cost from $6.99 to $9.99 in the U.S. In fact, the original subscription cost in November 2019 was only $4.99 per month.\n\nThe new price for an ad-free Apple TV+ puts it near platforms like Paramount+, Peacock, and Amazon Prime Video, which offer ad-free subscriptions for $12 to $14 per month.\n\nConsidering the amount of content Apple produces and releases, it\u2019s no wonder the streaming giant is asking for more money. Apple has reportedly lost over $1 billion per year since launching Apple TV+, despite it having around 45 million subscribers in March 2025.\n\nSo far, Apple TV+ has released prominent shows like Slow Horses, The Morning Show, Shrinking, and Severance, along with Apple Original Films like Highest 2 Lowest, F1, CODA, and Killers of the Flower Moon.\n\nWhile Apple TV+ continues to share several popular films and shows, subscribers will now have to pay a little more each month to stream such expensive productions on their TV and computer screens.",

      "text": "\u201cKillers of the Flower Moon is very much an example of the aging master who dug a grave for crime opuses with The Irishman.\u201d\n- Scorsese in his brutal Irishman groove\n- DiCaprio as you've never seen him before\n- David Grann's devastating history lesson brought alive\n- Weak bladders will burst\n- Short attention spans will drift\n\u201cWhy you can trust Digital Trends \u2013 We have a 20-year history of testing, reviewing, and rating products, services and apps to help you make a sound buying decision. Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\n\u201cYour murderers come with smiles, they come as your friends.\u201d So said Henry Hill in Goodfellas, right before one of those friends \u2014 the one played with a tiger\u2019s grin of ill intentions by Robert De Niro \u2014 tries to trick him into a one-way trip to Florida. Hill\u2019s words of warning (a rat\u2019s guide to not being eaten by the other rats) echo through the Martin Scorsese canon of greed, betrayal, and death. And they take on a freshly damning historical context in the director\u2019s monumental new movie, Killers of the Flower Moon, in which a string of slayings in 1920s Oklahoma becomes a microcosm for America\u2019s oldest project, its original sin: the genocide of the indigenous. The murderers come with smiles here, too. They come with the same smile.\nThe story is damnably, outrageously true. Scorsese and his co-writer, Eric Roth, adapted it from David Grann\u2019s 2017 book of the same name, a nonfiction page-turner that reads like crackerjack fiction. Pulling you quickly through a breadth of research with his crisp prose, Grann laid out the early-20th-century fortune and misfortune of the Osage Nation, made rich overnight by the discovery of oil, then hounded by an endless parade of white interlopers hoping to wrest the money away. When prominent members of the tribe began turning up dead, it was clear that the tactics had escalated beyond even the shadiest legal maneuvers to cold-blooded murder.\nThe conspiracy would draw federal agents to Osage County, and lead to the first major case of J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s recently formed FBI. Grann\u2019s bestseller is largely built around that investigation, led by a one-time Texas ranger named Tom White. White is a character in the movie, too \u2014 a stoic agent played by Jesse Plemons. But he\u2019s far from the central figure, and doesn\u2019t show up for a good long while. Scorsese and Roth have applied a different structure to these events, forgoing the murder-mystery procedural angle in favor of something more intimate and eccentric: They\u2019ve reframed the story around the relationship between Mollie Burkhart (Lily Gladstone), whose Osage family is directly targeted by the killers, and Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), a WWI veteran who starts as her chauffeur and then becomes her husband.\nIt\u2019s Ernest\u2019s wealthy uncle, William King Hale (De Niro) \u2014 fabled \u201cfriend of the Osage\u201d and a folksy white cattleman and philanthropist \u2014 who plays matchmaker. He plants the idea of a courtship during a long, insinuating conversation between Scorsese\u2019s two regular muses, one burying his inner Max Cady under a twinkling veneer of dandyish civility, the other playing much denser than usual. Ernest, we quickly see, is too dumb or too greedy or too craven to realize that he\u2019s being gently pulled into something bigger than himself, something nefarious and far-reaching. He\u2019s being initiated into a plan.\nThat plan unfolds gradually, as Scorsese threads the romance of Ernest and Mollie \u2014 who genuinely fall in love, against her better judgment and regardless of ulterior motives \u2014 through the expanding horror of what happens to her family, beginning with the disappearance of her sister, Anna (Cara Jade Myers). At 200-plus minutes, Killers of the Flower Moon takes its time, but doesn\u2019t drag. How could it, with editor Thelma Schoonmaker once more shaping the flowing path of conspiratorial incident, like a river winding steadily and unstoppably across open country? She and Scorsese tease out the evil in a different way than Grann did; rather than offer a string of shocking revelations, they make us privy to the dark motives and then watch as they\u2019re almost casually pursued by a growing ensemble of lowlifes, a rumble of guitar signaling constant danger ahead.\nDabbling in the trappings, at least and at last, of cowboy cinema (believe it or not, this is Marty\u2019s first Western of sorts), Scorsese sketches landscapes from one end of the widescreen frame to the other, and sweeps his camera over a ranch dotted with bovine as far as the eye can see. But his vision is not romantic. It glorifies neither outlaw country, nor the federal agents reigning it in: Though the 10-gallon lawman White and his posse do eventually arrive to take the Wild out of the West, they\u2019re much too late to save the day. If loads of Westerns are really about the death of an older America, Killers of the Flower Moon extends that elegiac focus to the slow-motion massacre that\u2019s defined our country from the bitter start. Bookending rituals, opening and closing the movie, make it clear where the film\u2019s sympathies forever lie.\nMollie \u2014 shattered by compounding losses, sick with heartache and disease \u2014 is the movie\u2019s grieving conscience. Gladstone, who made her breakthrough playing an achingly vulnerable cowgirl in Kelly Reichardt\u2019s Certain Women, cuts through the corrupt dimwit chatter with as little as a weary stare. But just as history and scoundrels conspired to diminish Mollie, so does the movie strategically sideline her. Those who objected to Anna Paquin bearing mute witness in Scorsese\u2019s last movie, the similarly fatalistic The Irishman, might lodge similar complaints against a film that doesn\u2019t tell this story entirely or even predominantly from the Osage vantage. It\u2019s possible to imagine another version by, about, and more explicitly for an indigenous audience.\nOf course, one of the trickiest things about Scorsese\u2019s work is that the moral perspective often doesn\u2019t belong to the central characters. He is forever fascinated by the weak and culpable, and risks charges of valorizing scoundrels by getting into their heads and bending movies around their vices, their flaws, their mistakes. Killers of the Flower Moon is classic Scorsese in that respect \u2014 and it\u2019s a shape it most clearly adheres to in the film\u2019s long final act of familiar snitching and courtroom reckoning, making it a kissing cousin to the backstabbing back stretches of Goodfellas and The Wolf of Wall Street. In other ways, this is very much the aging master who dug a grave for crime opuses with The Irishman. He brings that same depth of detail, that same patient deliberation, and that focus on a cog of violent history, slowly enveloped by his guilt, in multiple senses of the word.\nKillers of the Flower Moon is, at last, a great bellow of outrage echoing through the void of Ernest Burkhart, one of this director\u2019s most pathetic, interesting specimens, a human jellyfish complicit in his complacency. DiCaprio, teeth browned and intellect dimmed like an expiring light bulb, makes Ernest a simple man of simple desires without simplifying the contradiction within him. Can his love be real when it puts no barrier between him and unspeakable evil? By its quietly devastating final minutes, Scorsese has whittled down the vast, unfathomable scope of his historical epic to a close-up portrait of moral cowardice at its clammiest. No sympathy for the devil here.\nKillers of the Flower Moon opens in theaters everywhere Friday, October 20, and comes to Apple TV+ at a later date."

      "text": "Throughout its first four seasons, Slow Horses has become one of the most acclaimed shows on Apple TV+. The series, which is adapted from a series of novels by Mick Herron, follows a group of mediocre spies working at MI-5 who have done something to deserve a demotion at some point in their careers. Despite each spy\u2019s faults, they almost always find themselves at the center of some season-long conspiracy that requires them to save the nation.\nThe show has earned rave reviews since its first season, and it\u2019s starting to pick up steam at the Emmys. Thankfully, it shows no signs of slowing down, and as we prepare for the show\u2019s fifth season, here\u2019s everything we know about Slow Horses:\nHas Slow Horses been renewed for another season?\nSlow Horses has already been renewed for seasons 5 and 6. Production on season 5 has been completed, while filming is underway for season 6. We don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll get any more beyond that, but six seasons is more than most shows receive in the modern streaming era.\nWhen will Slow Horses season 5 be released?\nWhile we don\u2019t have an exact release date for the fifth season yet, Apple TV+ has teased that it should be coming in the summer of 2025. The fourth season debuted in September of 2024, so this season would be coming less than a year later. It\u2019s possible that the show could even come in early September, which would put the seasons exactly a year apart.\nWhat will the plot of this season of Slow Horses be?\nThis season is set to be adapted from London Rules, the fifth book in Herron\u2019s Slough House series. Here\u2019s the official synopsis from Apple TV+: \u201cIn season 5 of Slow Horses, everyone is suspicious when resident tech nerd Roddy Ho has a glamorous new girlfriend, but when a series of increasingly bizarre events occurs across the city, it falls to the Slow Horses to work out how everything is connected. After all, Jackson Lamb knows that in the world of espionage, \u2018London Rules\u2019 should always apply.\u201d\nChristopher Chung has also said that this season will put a bigger emphasis on his character, Roddy. \u201cThere is a bigger focus on Roddy than there is in the book. There\u2019s a lot more of me, and I may even throw in a dance move or two [laughs]. Everyone gets a moment in the spotlight, which is great, but I had read the six or seven books that were out when I was cast, and because London Rules has such a heavy focus on Roddy, I was hoping we would get to season 5,\u201d Chung explained to GamesRadar+.\nOf course, the main fallout from the show\u2019s fourth season will be the revelation of River\u2019s real father. We already know that Hugo Weaving, who played mercenary Frank Harkness in the show\u2019s fourth season and was revealed to be River\u2019s father, will be returning for the show\u2019s sixth season but will be skipping this upcoming installment.\nWho is in the cast for Slow Horses season 5?\nMost of the principal cast members from previous seasons are expected to return for this new installment.\n- Gary Oldman as Jackson Lamb\n- Jack Lowden as River Cartwright\n- Kristin Scott Thomas as Diana Taverner\n- Rosalind Eleazar as Louisa Guy\n- Christopher Chung as Roddy Ho\n- Saskia Reeves as Catherine Standish\n- Aimee-Ffion Edwards as Shirley Dander\n- Ruth Bradley as Emma Flyte\n- James Callis as Claude Whelan\n- Tom Brooke as J.K. Coe\nIs there a trailer for the fifth season yet?\nThe first teaser for season 5 came at the end of the show\u2019s fourth season and shows Roddy and Jackson being fired upon outside of Roddy\u2019s apartment. We also get brief glimpses of the rest of the cast and the season\u2019s overarching plot, which seems to involve a terrorist threat. River and Louisa also appear to share a kiss in the teaser, although it seems like Louisa might not be into it.\nHere\u2019s a rundown of our reviews for each season\nAs we mentioned up top, Slow Horses has been well-reviewed throughout its run on Apple TV+, but that doesn\u2019t mean that every season is created equal.\nIn our review of the show\u2019s first season, we were amazed by how strongly the show started and by how carefully it balances its comedic and dramatic elements: \u201cNot quite a comedy, not quite a full-on espionage thriller, Slow Horses is a compelling series that keeps you guessing about where the story will take its hard-luck agents. By veering off the beaten path with its spy saga, the show offers up something unique that busts open the conventions of its genre and delivers more than you hoped for \u2014 and that\u2019s no small feat with a cast of misfit spies who can\u2019t help disappointing everyone around them.\u201d\nThe show\u2019s second season is not quite as strong as the first but still delivers plenty of thrills and adds an emotional wallop that is far more devastating than anything in season 1. By shifting the focus away from River, at least to some extent, the show also gave the rest of its great cast more room to breathe and showcase their skill.\nThe third season might be the show\u2019s most impressive because it has exactly the right mix of genuine stakes and comedy, often intermixed in a single season. This season also closely mirrors something like a Mission: Impossible movie, with the Slough House team going rogue for an extended period and being actively hunted by the rest of MI-5.\nSeason 4, meanwhile, helped to cement the show as one of the best ongoing dramas on TV. \u201cIf the title of \u2018The Best Show on TV\u2019 still even exists or matters anymore, then Slow Horses is making a consistent and increasingly compelling case for it to hold that particular crown,\u201d we wrote in our review. \u201cIt may be about the shabbiest of British spies, but there\u2019s an effortlessness behind all of its latest season\u2019s funniest and most thrilling moments that is exhilarating to experience.\u201d"

Directed by Joseph Kosinski, who previously helmed Top Gun: Maverick, this sports drama follows veteran racer Sonny Hayes (Pitt) when he is called upon by his old rival (Javier Bardem) to return to Formula One racing to partner up with a young rookie, Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris), in the last few races of the season.\nAfter taking on the world of aerial combat, Kosinski brings his distinctive brand of cinematic flair to this depiction of competitive racing. Naturally, this makes for another captivating, blood-pumping blockbuster achievement. Though it seems to have left a better story in the rearview mirror, F1 makes up for it with a bevy of charismatic performances, engrossing visuals, and stirring moments.\nThe story runs a familiar track with mixed results\nF1\u2018s opening scene hooks its viewer with its introduction of the laid-back Sonny and his dazzling first race. This presents enough thrills and mystery to leave audiences wanting to see more of his character and learn more about him in the coming attractions. But beyond that, F1 presents a predictable story of an aged athlete, described in the film as \u201cthe greatest who never was,\u201d as he tries to educate a younger prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and regain his former glory. It\u2019s essentially Top Gun: Maverick with race cars, but that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing.\nThough the story of F1 is familiar, it still presents the right amount of severe character drama and lighthearted quips between Sonny, Joshua, and their teammates to make this an enjoyable summer blockbuster. Nevertheless, the script could ease up on the amount of expositional, on-the-nose dialogue, as journalists and news personalities fill the audience in on the story with heavy-handed commentary with very little subtlety.\nAlso, F1\u2018s story seems to brush past the challenges that the characters face, such as forged legal documents, Sonny\u2019s vision problems, and his post-traumatic stress, without much difficulty or consequence. Despite its potholes, F1 features plenty of emotional and even inspiring moments that fit well in the sports film genre, particularly that fiery crash scene and Sonny\u2019s climactic \u201cflight\u201d to the finish line. Overall, F1 presents a fun story with a decent amount of tension. However, the film struggles to ground itself in reality.\nTraditional characters with compelling actors\nIn F1, Sonny Hayes is a cocky, loose-cannon racing veteran who doesn\u2019t play by the rules, similar to Tom Cruise in Top Gun: Maverick. Meanwhile, Joshua Pearce is Sonny\u2019s younger, equally arrogant partner, who\u2019s desperate to prove himself and reach the top, which naturally leads to friction between the two. While this is the kind of dynamic seen between Maverick and Rooster in Top Gun: Maverick, Sonny and Joshua lack any prior history together to make their conflict more engaging.\nInstead, their relationship is more of a clash of like-minded egos, and the film doesn\u2019t spend enough time dissecting them and their backstories to make their characters feel true and unique. Likewise, Sonny and Joshua\u2019s development feels rushed at times. Though the latter experiences the most growth in the film and follows Sonny\u2019s example, his character presents so much more dramatic potential. Joshua talks about having to climb out from nothing to become the famed racer he is today, which could say a lot about the state of modern athletes. Instead, the film fails to expand upon his character to make him seem especially distinctive or relevant.\nLikewise, Sonny is presented as a divorced husband and father coping with a gambling addiction and a traumatic racing accident, and there are some nuances to his character aching to be unlocked. However, F1 seems to speed past all that without adding anything fresh and captivating to his character. Pitt at least touts his trademark charisma in the role of Sonny, making his jerk of a character a lovable, entertaining presence in the film.\nAt the same time, many members of the film\u2019s supporting cast shine just as brightly as Pitt. Idris brings the right balance of solemn intensity and cocky swagger as Joshua. Javier Bardem brings plenty of drama and humor as Sonny\u2019s friend and struggling new boss, Ruben Cervantes. Kerry Condon, in particular, wins with her performance as Sonny\u2019s tech director/love interest, Kate McKenna, sharing palpable chemistry with Pitt. Her character also stands out for the way she keeps her team together, arguably making her the movie\u2019s secret weapon.\nStunning action and visuals\nLike with the pilots in Top Gun: Maverick, Kosinski places viewers right in the driver\u2019s seat with the drivers as they battle each other with their cars like the chariot riders in Ben-Hur. This film immerses its audience thanks to the thrilling, up-close camerawork of the racers and their vehicles by Oscar-winning cinematographer Claudio Miranda (who also worked on Top Gun: Maverick). The panning shots filmed atop the moving cars are among the film\u2019s most distinctive visual achievements, giving viewers a heart-pounding view of all the excitement.\nF1 keeps up the intensity with super-swift editing courtesy of Stephen Mirrione, jumping from one character to another, from inside the cars to outside on the sidelines. The movie hardly gives its audience the time to breathe with its breakneck depiction of Formula One racing, making it all the more gripping. The thrills and emotion are also elevated by an excellent soundtrack and original musical score from the ever-reliable Hans Zimmer.\nIs F1 worth a watch?\nFor those looking for an eye-catching, heart-pounding underdog story to enjoy in theaters this summer, F1 is the right choice. Kosinski\u2019s movie doesn\u2019t add that much depth or innovation in terms of storytelling, but it is still a sight to behold. F1 is a cinematic roller coaster from start to finish, with the film making up for its shortcomings with compelling performances from the cast and immersive action.\nF1 is now in theaters."

      "text": "\u201cShrinking is another earnest and infectiously sincere dramedy series from several of the writers and producers behind Ted Lasso.\u201d\n- An impressive ensemble cast\n- Harrison Ford's standout supporting performance\n- An earnest approach that allows for moments of both comedy and heartbreak\n- Several uneven early episodes\n- An occasionally grating protagonist\n- Several characters take a few episodes to become fully realized\n\u201cWhy you can trust Digital Trends \u2013 We have a 20-year history of testing, reviewing, and rating products, services and apps to help you make a sound buying decision. Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nShrinking is a messy, absurd, and occasionally moving comedy about a group of messy, absurd, and occasionally insightful people. It is, in other words, the natural result of a creative collaboration between Ted Lasso co-creator Bill Lawrence, Ted Lasso star and writer Brett Goldstein, and Jason Segel. Across its first nine episodes, the Apple TV+ series runs headfirst into the difficult emotional terrain of its story with the same playful spirit that has, for better or worse, come to define many of Lawrence\u2019s previous TV efforts, including Scrubs, Cougar Town, and yes, Ted Lasso.\nShrinking does not, however, emerge quite as fully formed in its first episode as Lawrence and Goldstein\u2019s other Apple TV+ hit. The series, which premieres this week, struggles at first with its characterizations and treatment of certain characters. Shrinking\u2018s initial attempts to balance comedy and heartbreak aren\u2019t always successful, either. However, there are moments of brilliance scattered throughout Shrinking\u2019s uneven initial episodes, and it doesn\u2019t take long for the series to start to emerge as the first truly great ensemble TV comedy of the year.\nAt the center of the series\u2019 ensemble is Jimmy (Segel), a once-capable therapist who was sent into an intense emotional spiral by the death of his wife, Tia. By the time Shrinking begins, Jimmy\u2019s self-destructive coping methods have become so repetitive that his next-door neighbor, Liz (Christa Miller), reacts to him partying loudly in his backyard at 3 a.m. with the same tone of parental disappointment she would if she\u2019d just caught one of her sons breaking curfew. As has been the case with many of his past characters, Segel makes the most out of Jimmy\u2019s shortcomings by bringing the same commitment to the character\u2019s moments of self-pity as he does his often cartoonish outbursts.\nShrinking\u2019s messy premiere episode follows Jimmy as he decides to finally break out of his own cycle of drugs and general cynicism. Unfortunately for everyone in his life, Jimmy determines that the best way for him to do so is not only to start telling all of his patients what he thinks about them, but also to become unethically entangled in their lives. Shrinking, to its credit, doesn\u2019t ever reward Jimmy for this decision, and the series never acts as though his sudden shift in strategy is anything other than yet another attempt on his part to avoid dealing with his own crippling grief.\nJimmy\u2019s numerous off-screen mistakes have inevitably had an effect on those around him. His daughter, Alice (Lukita Maxwell), has been so thoroughly abandoned by her father in the year since her mom\u2019s death that she\u2019s essentially turned to Miller\u2019s Liz to provide the parental supervision Jimmy hasn\u2019t. Alice\u2019s presence in her life has, in turn, only exacerbated Liz\u2019s struggles with her own form of Empty Nest Syndrome, while Jimmy\u2019s former best friend, Brian (Michael Urie), has been left wondering what he did to make Jimmy decide to unceremoniously cut him off.\nAt work, Jimmy\u2019s colleague, Gaby (Jessica Williams), has resorted to ignoring the emotional baggage of her forthcoming, unavoidable divorce. Jimmy\u2019s mentor and boss, Paul (Harrison Ford), meanwhile, has already been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease by the time Shrinking\u2019s premiere begins. Despite his best efforts at presenting himself as Shrinking\u2019s unflinching elder statesman, Paul\u2019s diagnosis has similarly forced him to begin revisiting his estranged relationship with his daughter, Meg (Lily Rabe), in the hopes that he might be able to make up for some of his past mistakes.\nIf this sounds like a lot of emotional turmoil for Shrinking to try and sift through, that\u2019s because it is. The series doesn\u2019t always balance its multiple subplots as satisfyingly as it should, either. However, there\u2019s an openheartedness to the way in which Shrinking treats its characters and their problems that not only makes the series all the more endearing, but also prevents it from ever wallowing in darkness or heartbreak for too long. Whenever Segel\u2019s Jimmy seems like he\u2019s entered an unstoppable descent into total misery, someone like Williams\u2019 Gaby, Ford\u2019s Paul, or Miller\u2019s Liz shows up again to bust his chops and lift both him and Shrinking back up.\nHowever, the series does struggle to figure out the roles of several characters in its early episodes. Miller\u2019s Liz initially oscillates between being a parental adversary for Jimmy and the butt of every other character\u2019s jokes, and there are moments where Shrinking seems unsure of how to fully integrate Williams\u2019 Gaby into its multiple stories. Both of those problems are solved when Gaby and Liz become friends around halfway through Shrinking\u2019s first season, which allows both Williams and Miller to establish a comedic dynamic together that is among the show\u2019s best. The formation of Gaby and Liz\u2019s friendship also marks the moment when Shrinking begins to operate less like a dysfunctional workplace series and more like a laid-back hangout comedy.\nShrinking\u2019s midseason shift proves to be mostly for the better. While its transition toward a looser narrative structure does result in its central premise \u2014 Jimmy\u2019s reckless new therapy tactics \u2014 essentially falling by the wayside, the adoption of a more leisurely pace gives Shrinking the chance to become a true ensemble comedy. Stars like Williams, Miller, and Urie all find their groove in the second half of Shrinking\u2019s first season, and the series, in turn, finally seems to nail down its depiction of their characters around the same time. Jimmy\u2019s grief also, paradoxically, seems to manifest itself in more nuanced ways the less that Shrinking focuses on it.\nAcross Shrinking\u2019s first nine episodes, though, it\u2019s Harrison Ford\u2019s Paul who makes the biggest and most memorable impression. The actor turns out to be perfectly cast as Jimmy\u2019s wise but withholding superior, one whose empathy for his prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s situation is expressed through the private therapy sessions he conducts with Maxwell\u2019s Alice. Here, Ford is just as gruff and sarcastic as ever, but he\u2019s also allowed to be silly and heartfelt in ways that he\u2019s rarely been given the chance to be on-screen before. Shrinking is arguably worth investing in just for the episode in which Ford\u2019s Paul gets accidentally stoned and ends up munching on a bag of Doritos with Miller\u2019s Liz.\nFord\u2019s performance rings with the same level of sincerity that permeates all of Shrinking. The series is an ambitious and emotionally resonant dramedy that isn\u2019t afraid to let its characters be as messy as possible. At times, that messiness can extend past Shrinking\u2019s characters and into the show itself, but those instances are ultimately few and far between. By the time the series has reached its layered, emotionally complicated ninth episode, Shrinking has already earned its place as one of the more impressive ensemble comedies that have premiered in recent months.\nAt its best, the series is able to do what all great TV dramedies should, which is smoothly shift between moments of comfort, heartbreak, and humor all within the span of a few seconds. The fact that it\u2019s able to do so is not only a testament to the strength of Shrinking\u2019s creative team, but also the collective talent of its undeniably impressive, lovable cast.\nShrinking premieres Friday, January 27 on Apple TV+. Digital Trends was given early access to the first nine of the season 1\u2019s 10 episodes."
