  "content": "THE STATE-CONTROLLED AIRLINE AND THE FIFTH LARGEST CARRIER IN ASIA. JOINING US EXCLUSIVELY IS THE CEO. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE POLITICAL SITUATION HERE IN THAILAND. IS THAT IMPACTING SENTIMENT IN ANY WAY? IS THAT IMPACTING YOUR BUSINESS IN ANY WAY? YES. MAYBE IT IS IMPACTING THE CONFIDENCE OF THE COUNTRY. ACTUALLY, THAI AIRWAYS, AS WE LAID ON THE STRATEGY, WE'VE BEEN BECOMING A NETWORK ALLY. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE. IN THE PAST, WE MOSTLY CARRY POSITIVE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES INTO THAILAND BACK AND FORTH. NOW WE CAN CARRY A PASSENGER FROM ONE COUNTRY THROUGH BANGKOK INTO THE OTHER DESTINATION. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE FROM THE PAST AND NOW. THIS IS THE WAY WE CAN REDUCE RATES WITHOUT RELYING HEAVILY ON ONE SINGLE MARKET. HASLINDA: IN TERMS OF THAILAND AS A HOLIDAY DESTINATION, HAS THAT BEEN IMPACTED AT ALL IN ANY WAY? ARE YOU SEEING A DECLINE IN NUMBERS? ADD TO THAT, WE'VE GOT THE SITUATION BETWEEN THAILAND AND BODIO. AS A VISITOR OR A TRAVELER COMING TO THAILAND, THE ONLY AREA THAT'S DROPPING IS THE CHINA MARKET. THE REST OF THE MARKET, INDIA, AUSTRALIA, OTHER PARTS OF ASIA STILL GROWING. AS I SAID, THE ONLY IMPACT IS CHINA. CHINA THERE IS OTHER ISSUES. IT'S A DIFFERENT PICTURE BETWEEN THAILAND AND THAI AIRWAYS. MOSTLY THE GROUP TRAVELS WITH THE CARRIER. SOME OF THEM INTO BANGKOK. SO THEN CROSSING INTO BANGKOK TO OTHER COUNTRIES. HASLINDA: YOU ARE SEEING GROWTH PART FROM CHINA WHEN IT COMES TO PASSENGER NUMBERS. CAN YOU SHED SOME LIGHT AS TO WHAT THE NUMBERS LOOK LIKE? WE FLIGHT 11 CITIES IN EUROPE. TWO OF THEM ARE DOUBLE DAILY. FINANCIALLY, WE HAVE A SHORT-TERM PLAN TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY TO EUROPE. AS WE SEE THE NUMBER FROM EUROPEAN COMING INTO BANGKOK. AGAIN, GOING THROUGH BANGKOK TO OTHER REGIONS. THE NUMBER OF THE INCREASE ACROSS THE EUROPEAN TRAVELER AND ALSO INDIA INTO THAILAND AND AUSTRALIA INTO THAILAND, NORTH ASIA, MAYBE JAPAN IS SLOWING DOWN. THERE'S A LOT OF TIMES GOING TO JAPAN AND KOREA. AS A CONCLUSION, FROM THE OTHER AREA, GOINGS TWO TO 3% FROM LAST YEAR. SHOWING THAT THERE IS STILL SOME DEMAND. HASLINDA: GIVEN THE OPTIMISM THAT YOU ARE EXPRESSING, WHAT ARE YOUR EXPANSION PLANS FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS? AS I SAID, WE ARE SITUATED IN BANGKOK. THE EXPANSION WAS MOSTLY TO EUROPE, ESPECIALLY BY INDIA AND CHINA IN THE FUTURE. NARROWBODY THIS YEAR. NEXT YEAR IN TOTAL, 17 OF THEM. CAN FLY UP TO SIX HOURS WHICH CAN CONNECT OUR INTERCONTINENTAL CENTER FOR REGIONAL CITIES IN ASIA. THAT'S OUR STRATEGY. ON TOP OF THAT, NOT ONLY FITTING OUR AIRCRAFT BY OURSELVES BUT ALSO USING OUR PARTNER LIKE A STAR PARTNER. WE HAVE A LOT OF SPA SPECIAL. THIS WILL STRENGTHEN OUR NETWORK BY SELLING A TICKET TO THEM ALSO. THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF COLLABORATION WITH OTHERS. HASLINDA: RIGHT. YOU TALK ABOUT TAKING DELIVERY OF NEW AIRCRAFT. WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF AIRCRAFT AT THIS POINT IN TIME. WHAT CONVERSATIONS ARE YOU HAVE TO -- HAVING WITH THE LIKES OF AIRBUS AND BOEING? WHAT ARE THE INDICATIONS FROM THEM? FROM AIRBUS, WE CONFIRMED WITH THEM. THIS ONE WILL BE THE AIRCRAFT. 32 OF THEM. IT'S ALREADY CONFIRMED. THE FIRST TWO WILL BE COMING AT THE END OF THIS YEAR AND WILL BE IN PRODUCTION BY EARLY NEXT YEAR. 15 OF THEM NEXT YEAR. THE REST STILL ON TIME. THREE YEARS FROM NOW, WE CAN GET IT ALL. 32. WE JUST HAVE TO COMMIT WITH -- COMMITMENT WITH BOEING. 2023. THE FIRST ONE WILL BE DELAYED A BIT. AT THE INITIAL PLAN, THE MID OF 27. 2027. WE NOTICE BY BOEING THAT IT WILL BE ABOUT A SIX MONTH DELAY. MAINLY COMING AT THE END OF 27. IN TRAFFIC BY EARLY 28. YEAH. HASLINDA: BECAUSE OF THE SHORTAGE OF AIRCRAFT, A LOT OF AIRLINES ARE ACTUALLY TURNING TO SECONDHAND AIRCRAFT. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT AS WELL? YES. DEFINITELY. WE'VE GOT OUR EYES ON THE AIRCRAFT. SO THE DIFFICULT PART IS EVERY ALLY HOLDING THE AIRCRAFT. DELIVERY FROM THE NEW PRODUCTION AIRCRAFT. IT'S RARE TO FIND THE NEWEST AIRCRAFT IN THE MARKET. THERE ARE STILL SOME. WE HAVE TO PUT MORE EFFORT TO GET THAT AIRCRAFT. THE PROBLEM IS IT MAYBE ONE OR TWO OR THREE AIRCRAFT. THOSE AIRCRAFT ARE DIFFERENT IN THE AIRCRAFT. WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT ALSO. IDEALLY, WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ONE SIZABLE NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT WHICH HAVE THE SAME CONFIGURATION. FOR EXAMPLE, 10 OF THEM HAVING THE SAME CONFIGURATION. THAT'S THE MOST DIFFICULT PART. HASLINDA: WE KNOW THAT THAILAND IS STILL IN NEGOTIATIONS TO BRING THE 19% TARIFF DOWN. WE ALSO KNOW THAT A LOT OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE U.S. INVOLVE A COMPONENT INVOLVING AIRCRAFT DEALS. ARE THERE ANY PLANS WHATSOEVER FOR THAI AIR TO BE BUYING MORE BOEING PLANES? AS WE KNOW, WE ALL KNOW THAT WE ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO THE FIRM ORDER OF DREAMLINER. TOGETHER --",
