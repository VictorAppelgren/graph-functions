      "summary": "American Eagle’s high‑profile marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney and NFL star Travis Kelce has driven a surge in customer acquisition and traffic, helping the retailer beat fiscal Q2 earnings expectations and lift its stock by over 8% in after‑hours trading. The company’s revised full‑year guidance now projects comparable sales to be flat, better than analysts’ 0.2% decline forecast, while operating income remains lower due to tariff impacts and a $75 million inventory write‑down. Despite backlash over the campaign’s slogan, the brand has seen double‑digit traffic growth and sold out key items within a day, positioning it for stronger back‑to‑school momentum amid broader retail softness and tariff uncertainty.",
