  "title": "Itauma vs Whyte: Unbeaten prospect says veteran opponent \"playing a sheep to catch the wolf\"",
  "description": "Moses Itauma accuses Dillian Whyte of \"playing a sheep to catch the wolf,\" questioning his British opponent's respectful approach before Saturday's heavyweight fight in Saudi Arabia.",
  "content": "Moses Itauma accused Dillian Whyte of \"playing a sheep to catch the wolf\" as he questioned his opponent's respectful approach before Saturday's heavyweight fight in Saudi Arabia. At a cordial news conference in Riyadh, the Britons exchanged pleasantries, thumbs-ups and handshakes. Veteran Whyte described the unbeaten Itauma, 20, as the future of heavyweight boxing and has been complimentary throughout fight week. Speaking to BBC Sport on Monday, the 37-year-old said there was no weakness in his younger opponent's game. But Itauma's reference to the wolf and sheep metaphor highlights a strategy where the \"sheep\" - a seemingly weaker or harmless player - pretends to be vulnerable in order to catch the stronger and more aggressive \"wolf\" off guard.\n\n\"We're all heavyweights - any fight can end at any point. I'm not delusional,\" said Itauma. \"I know what threat Dillian Whyte poses, I'm not overlooking him, I'm taking him seriously.\" Whyte was quick to dismiss the idea, though, as he insisted: \"Ain't no sheeps around here. A lot of wolves, but no sheeps.\"\n\n'This is the start of greatness'\n\nJamaica-born Londoner Whyte brings a wealth of experience, having won 31 of his 34 professional fights. He has shared the ring with some of the division's biggest names, including Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury, and holds notable wins over Derek Chisora and Joseph Parker. \"I've had a few main events and a few pay-per-views, but there is so much more left for me to achieve in the game,\" added Whyte. His career has stalled in recent years, though. A stoppage win over Ebenezer Tetteh last December was unconvincing, but Whyte appears to be in his best physical shape for some time. \"I'm someone who is not supposed to be here,\" added the 'Body Snatcher'. \"Never had a great amateur career, no support. A kid from Jamaica who has been written off many times, not meant to survive, meant to be dead before I was in my 20s. But here I am doing stuff, so what more can I say?\" Chatham's Itauma is a powerful and agile southpaw, once tipped as the man who could break Mike Tyson's record as the youngest heavyweight champion. Although that timeline has passed, excitement around the Slovakia-born fighter remains high. Itauma has already stopped 10 of his 12 professional opponents and boasts a perfect 24-0 amateur record. \"This is the start of greatness,\" he said.",

If [Joshua v Paul] makes sense and does numbers, why not?\" Whyte told BBC Sport\n\"[Joshua] has won the championship twice, had a lot of fights and done a lot so I don't know.\n\"I'm sure he'll make more money than he did in some of his title fights so sometimes if you can make some money then make some money.\"\nWhyte lost to Joshua in 2015 for the British title in a memorable grudge match.\nA 2023 rematch was scrapped after Whyte failed a drug test. He protested his innocence, claimed he was cleared of any wrongdoing and returned to action in March 2024.\n\"I would love to have a chance to right my wrong,\" Whyte said.\n- Published4 days ago\n- Published14 November 2024\n'The underdog is a very dangerous dog'\nWhyte, who has won 31 of 34 professional fights, lost in a world-title shot against Tyson Fury in 2022 and has struggled for momentum in recent years.\n'The Body Snatcher' stopped Ebenezer Tetteh in December, though looked far from his best.\nBut the Briton still has his sights set on heavyweight glory. He says undisputed champion Oleksandr Usyk is the \"best of the era\" but feels he is ready for another run at a world title.\n\"I don't think I did myself justice last time. I went into the fight, we trained hard but a few things weren't right. Mentally, it wasn't right,\" he added.\nIt was \"partly\" the reason he chose to take on powerful southpaw Itauma. The 20-year-old Chatham heavyweight is considered one of boxing's top prospects, and has stopped 10 of his 12 opponents since turning professional.\n\"Nobody wants to fight [Itauma]. I love fighting, I love competing, I love a test. I like doing what people say I can't do, that it's impossible,\" Whyte added.\n\"The underdog is a very dangerous dog.\"\nRelated topics\n- Published5 August\n- Published28 April 2024\nMore boxing from the BBC\n- Published31 January"

      "text": "'Modern-day gladiator' - the rise of heavyweight hope Itauma\n- Published\n\"The way I see it, I'm a modern-day gladiator. I just get into the arena and have to fight.\"\nTipped by many as the future of the heavyweight division, 19-year-old Moses Itauma is already an imposing figure with an impressive record.\nOn 21 December, he stopped Demsey McKean in one round to register the 11th win in an explosive fledgling professional career which includes nine knockouts.\nUnder the lights in Saudi Arabia - on the undercard of Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk's rematch - Itauma had come a long way from the \"cold\" climes of Slovakia, his mother's home nation, where he spent the first few years of his life.\n\"It's part of my identity, it's not something I would change, but we weren't treated the same way as everyone else,\" Itauma, whose father is of Nigerian heritage, says.\n\"We would stand out because we were the only African Slovak people, but I am proud of my heritage.\n\"I think I got the best of both worlds, that Slovak toughness, mentality, and I'm strong physically from my Nigerian side.\"\nSpeaking to the BBC from his gym in Essex, Itauma - who turns 20 on 28 December - reflects on his journey from the small Slovakian town of Kezmarok to becoming one of the hottest properties in boxing's glamour division.\n- Published5 July 2024\nFrom Enriko to Moses\nThe family moved to Chatham in Kent when Itauma was just three.\nHe began boxing at the age of nine and - although he admits he hated his first session - he enjoyed the social side of being with his gym friends and persevered.\nDuring his teenage years, his talent became apparent with tournament wins around the world.\n\"Where I lived there were a lot of amateurs on the scene, and I was always in and around boxing - I had it good at school and grew close with my friends because I'd see them in class and two hours later I'd see them at the gym,\" he says.\nBefore his 16th birthday, Itauma was sparring with ex-cruiserweight world champion Lawrence Okolie.\nHis talent was noticed by those in the know. When Itauma's elder brother, Karol, signed with Frank Warren's Queensberry Promotions, it wasn't long before he did the same.\nThe promoters preferred the heavyweight's middle name, Moses, to his given forename of Enriko.\nEager to do whatever he could to propel his budding career, Itauma agreed to go by his middle name.\n\"Karol said Moses sounded strong for a heavyweight, so we decided to go with it,\" he said.\nTargeting Tyson's record\nItauma famously said he wanted to beat Mike Tyson's record as the youngest heavyweight world champion at 20, but - while a shot at the title is closer than ever before - it is unlikely to come quick enough.\nHe would need to become world champion by 19 May 2025 to surpass Tyson's record.\n\"I wanted to gun down the Tyson record but I'm doing as much as I can on my side and if I can't get it over the line it's not going to be my fault,\" he says.\nItauma says he has learned the harsh realities of the sport with more established fighters refusing to give him an opportunity through a fear of losing to the prospect.\n\"When I turned professional, I thought if you are good enough to become world champion, you'll become world champion, but that's just not it,\" Itauma says.\n\"People who have already made it wouldn't want to fight me because that's a lose-lose situation.\n\"Whoever the opponent is, that's picked by the crowd and picked by the promoters, that's not picked by me.\"\nDavison tips Itauma as future great\nItauma's trainer Ben Davison knows a thing or two about heavyweights, given his stable includes two-time world champion Anthony Joshua and British champion Fabio Wardley.\nDavison also oversaw the return of Tyson Fury - who Itauma has sparred on several occasions - after a hiatus from the sport.\n\"I asked him, if the opportunity presents itself [a title shot], would you take it with me, and he said yes, but obviously you need to be in the position to get that shot,\" Davison says.\n\"It's great to be around world champions, but obviously they don't get in the ring for you - at the end of the day, it's you who has to fight.\"\nDavison's ambitions seem to match the high hopes of Moses, who he described as talented, coachable, hungry, and willing to fight anyone in the division.\n\"If he keeps his mind on the job, he has the potential to mark himself as one of the best heavyweights that there's ever been,\" Davison adds.\nRelated topics\n- Published17 December 2024\n- Published28 April 2024\nMore boxing from the BBC\n- Published31 January"

  "argos_summary": "Moses Itauma has accused Dillian Whyte of using a deceptive strategy by being overly respectful ahead of their heavyweight fight in Saudi Arabia, suggesting that Whyte is pretending to be vulnerable to catch him off guard. Despite the cordial atmosphere at the press conference, Itauma remains focused on the threat posed by the experienced Whyte, who has expressed admiration for the young fighter's potential. Both fighters are looking to prove themselves, with Whyte aiming to regain momentum in his career and Itauma seeking to establish himself as a future heavyweight champion.",
