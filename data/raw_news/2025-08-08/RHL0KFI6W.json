  "content": "Food Network star Ree Drummond has opened up about the secret to her nearly 30-year marriage to Ladd Drummond.\n\nThe TV personality and her husband, both 56, will celebrate their 29th wedding anniversary in September.\n\nIn her latest Pioneer Woman blog post, the mother-of-four \u2014 whose son's license was just revoked \u2014 revealed that the couple's favorite date night activity is a long drive in her pickup truck.\n\n'At the risk of sounding like an old married couple, we love to take drives together,' the redhead beauty shared.\n\nShe explained, 'There's something about the peace of the pickup. That diesel engine is like background music, and we are focused only on each other. No laptops, devices, TV's...it's such a great time to catch up.'\n\nAbout their destination, Ree said, 'Honestly, it's different every time.'\n\nShe added about their Oklahoma drives, 'Sometimes we stay on the county roads and check on fences or cattle; other times we'll drive east to Pawhuska or west to Ponca City, stopping to get a convenience store Dr Pepper when we get there.\n\n'Other times Ladd will drive into this pasture or that, to show me an area of a creek that I may not have seen before, or \u2014 again \u2014 to check on a cow or a fence.'\n\nThe husband and wife are parents to four kids \u2014 Alex, 28, Paige, 25, Bryson, 22, and Todd, 21.\n\nThe star also revealed in her 2020 book, Frontier Follies: Adventures in Marriage and Motherhood in the Middle of Nowhere, that she fostered a son named Jamar in 2018.\n\nAnd they welcomed their first grandchild, Alex's daughter Sofia, in December 2024.\n\nRee said in the blog post written by Kelsey Hurwitz, 'Now that we're empty nesters, it's not like we don't have lots of time alone at home already.\n\n'But there's something about the safety and sanctity of the pickup that sparks the very best conversations.'\n\nIn December, the author gushed about becoming a grandmother in a heartfelt blog post.\n\nShe announced at the time, 'My sweet little pookie head granddaughter Sofia was born ten days ago, so I thought it would be the perfect time to show you some of my favorite snapshots of the first week-and-a-half of her life.'\n\nThe proud grandparent even said she considered buying a house in Texas to be close to her daughter and the baby.\n\n'I got to stay in Dallas just long enough to fall hopelessly in love with her, and I would be lying if I said I haven't checked Zillow for houses not only on Alex and Mauricio's street, but also on their block and actually right across the street from their house.\n\n'It's sort of like when I return from a vacation in Vail, Colorado and I start searching for houses to buy in Vail because I just don't want that vacation feeling to end. Well, in this case, it's even more profound: I don't want my time with Sofia ever to end, and though neither \"second home\" scenario is very likely at all, a girl (and a grandmother) can sure dream,' she penned.",

And in Ree Drummond's new book, Frontier Follies, she reveals she has a foster son named Jamar\nIn addition, Ree wrote: 'I'm now writing about Jamar because after a year-and-a-half of living in our house, he is an inextricable part of our wacky family.'\nAdding: 'And it's become increasingly strange for me not to talk about him. He's eighteen now, which means the state agency restrictions no longer apply--and most notably, he told me he's tired of feeling like we're trying to hide him from the world.'\nRee and Ladd have four children: sons Bryce, 18, and Todd, 16, and daughters Alex, 23, and Paige, 21.\nShe wrote that Jamar came to be their 'foster son was entirely situational.'\nRee explained that previously, fostering a kid was not something she and husband Ladd every felt called to do but that they couldn't ignore Jamar's circumstances.\nShe said 'long story short, all six foot five inches of him showed up at our house one afternoon, bag in hand, ready to move in.'\nLadd had met him a few times at high school football practice and had the initial idea that he should live with them.\nA few days after his arrival, Jamar got into a bad accident with an ATV, needing a skin graft on his foot as well as a double tendon repair surgery.\nJamar had dreams to continue his football career and the injury was a 'dicey, scary time' because it was six weeks he needed to heal.\nHe ended up gaining thirty pounds during this time because she said she was trying to nurture him when he was bedridden; he has since shed the thirty pounds he gained.\nSo cute: Ladd had met him a few times at high school football practice and had the initial idea that he should live with them\nDue to the injury, it 'forced all of us to get pretty darn close, and fast,' adding that she changed his foot dressing every day, gave his medicine, checked on him through the night.\nLadd took him to his doctor appointments and physical therapy session, while her sons Bryce and Todd helped him in and out of bed as well as helping him wrap his foot in plastic before a shower and spent time with him.\n'We were all up in Jamar's business, and if there'd been any hesitation on any of our parts to interact and get comfortable with one another, his injury quickly knocked down those walls and gave us all a reason to come together.'\nAdding: 'Jamar had to learn to trust us, which wasn't easy. But again, crash course.'\nRee sweetly called him 'my bonus son': He's larger than life, has a hilarious laugh, and is extremely smart - both book and street. He's a great kid who's overcome some difficulties in his life, not to mention a tough accident (and a foster mom who overfed him and unintentionally tried to turn him in a fly fisherman).'\nCute: Ree and Ladd have four children: sons Bryce, 18, and Todd, 16, and daughters Alex, 23, and Paige, 21\nMost watched News videos\n- Naked man on Hammersmith and City line confronted by irate passengers\n- Knife-obsessed teen found guilty of murdering Harvey Willgoose\n- Moment bear walks into home and receives unwelcome fright\n- Man jailed after hurling abuse at cabin crew aboard flight\n- 'Worst Amazon driver' slammed over way he delivers package\n- Erin Patterson's reaction to fate of her lunch guests\n- Is 'Ibiza Bob' hiding a secret with his distinctive hairstyle?\n- Longest flight ever thanks to 'black storm'\n- Sea of Galilee turns blood red sparking fears of 'impending doom'\n- Matt Wright arrives at court with his legal team and wife Kaia\n- Erin Patterson's grim reaction at conclusion of interview\n- Erin Patterson denies having a dehydrator while speaking to police"
