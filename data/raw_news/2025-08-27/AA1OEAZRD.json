  "description": "It's like a very expensive game of Where's Waldo?",
  "content": "More than 80 years ago, the master painting of Portrait of a Lady by Italian painter Giuseppe Ghislandi was stolen by Nazis from a Jewish art dealer in Amsterdam. It hadn\u2019t been seen since it went missing\u2013until this week, when it was spotted in a real estate listing for a home for sale in Argentina. And while that may have seemed like a mystery solved, The Guardian reports that once the portrait was spotted, it suddenly went missing again.\n\nThe painting, a portrait of Contessa Colleoni, was one of more than 1,000 that were looted from the collection of Jacques Goudstikker during World War II, and was last seen in 1940, according to the Lost Art Database. Its possession was traced by Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad (AD), which found that the painting landed in the possession of Nazi Germany\u2019s Supreme Commander of the Air Force, Reichsmarschall Hermann G\u00f6ring, as part of a forced sale. It was then thought to land in the hands of Friedrich Kadgien, an SS officer described by US interrogators as \u201ca snake of the lowest sort,\u201d who fled Germany for Switzerland in 1945, then moved to Brazil and eventually landed in Argentina.\n\nKadgien died in Argentina in 1978, and his family that remained reportedly rebuffed the many efforts of AD to try to track down the art that he escaped Germany with. But when one of Kadgien\u2019s daughters listed the house for sale with an Argentinian realty company, the photo made its first public appearance in nearly a century. Members of the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands told AD, \u201cThere is no reason to think this could be a copy.\u201d\n\nSo mystery solved, right? Well, not so fast. The stroke of good luck that resulted in reporters spotting the painting has also apparently tipped off the family about the situation. When Argentinian police showed up at the house to search for the painting, it had disappeared. Instead, when they entered the home, they found a \u201cgenerously dimensioned tapestry of a landscape and horses\u201d in place of the painting, according to a report from Argentinian newspaper La Naci\u00f3n.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the painting that has been pulled, either. The listing for the home is no longer available via the realty company that was handling the sale, and the daughter of Kadgien has reportedly deleted or changed her social media accounts. No charges have been brought against the family, according to La Naci\u00f3n, but they could face charges for concealing criminal property.",

      "text": "Argentinian police have said they will continue hunting for an old master painting looted by the Nazis and spotted by chance in an estate agent\u2019s listing after a search of the property in the seaside town of Mar del Plata failed to uncover the work.\n\u201cThe painting is not in the house \u2026 but we\u2019re going to keep searching for it,\u201d the federal prosecutor Carlos Mart\u00ednez told local media. He said items that could be useful for the investigation, including two firearms, engravings and prints, had been seized.\nCiting investigators, the Argentinian newspaper La Naci\u00f3n reported that the missing work, Portrait of a Lady by the Italian master Giuseppe Ghislandi, was no longer hanging in the living room of the house, where it had been in the estate agency photo.\nIn its place was \u201ca generously dimensioned tapestry of a landscape and horses\u201d that, marks on the wall suggested, had recently replaced another work. \u201cWhere we found a tapestry, not long ago, there was something else,\u201d a police officer told the paper.\nPortrait of a Lady belonged to Jacques Goudstikker, a leading Jewish art dealer in Amsterdam who died in May 1940 fleeing the invading Nazis. His collection of more than 1,100 artworks, many of them classed as old masters, was acquired for a tiny fraction of its value by Reichsmarschall Hermann G\u00f6ring.\nThe Dutch newspaper AD reported this week that it had uncovered documents suggesting that by the end of war the Ghislandi portrait had fallen into the hands \u2013 it is not clear how \u2013 of Friedrich Kadgien, a high-ranking Nazi official, SS member and one-time senior aide to G\u00f6ring.\nThe painting is thought to have accompanied Kadgien when he fled the Netherlands in 1946, first to Switzerland, then Brazil and finally to Argentina. It is believed to have remained in his family\u2019s possession after he died in Buenos Aires in 1978.\nAuthorities have said one of Kadgien\u2019s two daughters, who owns the Mar del Plata house, and her partner were the subjects of a judicial investigation after complaints filed by the federal police, Interpol and Argentina\u2019s customs agency, Arca.\nThe complaints were prompted by the publication of the AD articles, which the Dutch paper said followed an investigation during which it several times contacted the late Nazi\u2019s daughters, who declined to talk about their father or the artwork.\nThe paper eventually sent a reporter to Argentina, who discovered that a house owned by one of the daughters was for sale and spotted the potentially incriminating photograph of the portrait on the website of the estate agency handling the property.\nAD reported on Wednesday that the property had since been taken off the site by the agency, Robles Casas & Campos, which confirmed it was no longer on their books, and that Kadgien\u2019s daughter had changed her user name on social media.\nLa Naci\u00f3n reported that it understood no charges had yet been brought, but that if the couple were found to have had the work in their possession, they could face possible prosecution for concealing criminal property, with no statute of limitations applying because the alleged offence took place in wartime."

      "text": "More than 80 years after it was looted by the Nazis from a Jewish art dealer in Amsterdam, a portrait by an Italian master has been spotted on the website of an estate agent advertising a house for sale in Argentina.\nA photo shows the painting, Portrait of a Lady (Contessa Colleoni) by the late-baroque portraitist Giuseppe Ghislandi, also known as Fra\u2019 Galgario, hanging above a sofa in the living room of the property, in a seaside town near Buenos Aires.\nThe Dutch newspaper AD said it had traced the work, which features in a database of lost art and is listed by the Dutch culture ministry as \u201cunreturned\u201d after the second world war, after a long investigation \u2013 and with the unwitting help of the estate agent.\nPortrait of a Lady belonged to Jacques Goudstikker, a leading Dutch art dealer who fled the Netherlands in mid-May 1940 to escape the invading Nazis but died after falling in the hold of the vessel carrying him to safety and breaking his neck.\nWithin weeks, Goudstikker\u2019s entire collection of more than 1,100 artworks, including numerous paintings catalogued as old masters, had been bought up, in a forced sale and for a small fraction of its true value, by Reichsmarschall Hermann G\u00f6ring.\nAfter the second world war, some works were recovered in Germany and displayed as part of the Dutch national collection in the Rijkmuseum, before 202 were restored to the dealer\u2019s sole surviving heir, his daughter-in-law Marei von Saher, in 2006.\nPortrait of a Lady was not among them. AD said it had uncovered wartime documents suggesting the painting was one of two in the possession of Friedrich Kadgien, a Nazi official, SS officer and senior aide to G\u00f6ring, who fled to Switzerland in 1945.\nKadgien \u2013 described by US interrogators as \u201cnot a true Nazi\u201d but \u201ca snake of the lowest sort\u201d \u2013 subsequently left Switzerland for Brazil then Argentina, the paper said, where he started a company and a family and died in 1978, aged 71.\nThe paper said it had made attempts over several years to speak to the late Nazi\u2019s two daughters in Buenos Aires about their father and the missing artworks, but had been consistently rebuffed. Eventually, a reporter was dispatched to knock on doors.\n\u201cThere was certainly someone at home, we saw a shadow moving in the corridor, but no one opened,\u201d the journalist, Peter Schouten, reported back. \u201cBy the way, the house is for sale,\u201d he added, attaching a link to the agency, Robles Casas & Campos.\nThe AD reporter Cyril Rosman said: \u201cAs I opened the link the next morning, I started scrolling through the interior photos of the property. Was there anything that said more about Kadgien\u2019s past? Then I saw it. That painting, above the sofa \u2013 photo five \u2026\u201d\nThe paper said art historians believed the painting had every appearance of being the missing work by Ghislandi, one of Italy\u2019s most important late-17th and early-18th-century portraitists, whose works are on display in several museums around the world.\nBram de Klerck of Radboud University in Nijmegen said the composition was \u201cidentical\u201d and the dimensions and colours appeared to match earlier black-and-white photographs, but warned he could not say more based on a photo.\nTwo researchers at the Dutch government\u2019s cultural heritage service, Annelies Kool and Perry Schrier, also told AD there was \u201cno reason to imagine\u201d it was a copy, adding that only an examination of the painting itself could provide confirmation.\nIn addition, Kool and Schrier said they believed they had uncovered a photo of a second missing work known to have been in Kadgien\u2019s possession, a still life by the 17th-century Dutch artist Abraham Mignon, in a social media post by one of his daughters.\nAD said all attempts to speak to the sisters since the discovery of the photo had failed, with one reportedly telling the paper: \u201cI don\u2019t know what information you want from me and I don\u2019t know what painting you are talking about.\u201d\nA US lawyer for the Goudstikker estate told the paper the dealer\u2019s heirs would make every effort to recover the work, and von Saher, 81, said she would not give up her search for the artworks owned by her late father-in-law, which began in the 1990s.\n\u201cMy family aims to bring back every single artwork robbed from Jacques\u2019 collection, and to restore his legacy,\u201d von Saher said."

Dutch authorities and the Cultural Heritage Agency confirmed the painting was likely the missing work, but when Argentine police searched the property it was no longer present, having been replaced by a tapestry.
