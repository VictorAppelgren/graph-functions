  "title": "Sen. Bill Cassidy wants 'oversight' of CDC. Some say he deserves blame for its turmoil.",
  "description": "Some health experts say Cassidy deserves blame for CDC turmoil as a doctor who was concerned about Kennedy\u2019s vaccine views but voted to confirm him.",
  "content": "The turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pushed out the director after clashing over his approach to vaccines has generated bipartisan concern and put a spotlight on a key senator who was instrumental in Kennedy securing his job.\n\nCDC Director Susan Monarez was fired following a dispute with Kennedy over vaccination policy. After Monarez's termination, resignation letters followed on Aug. 27 from CDC Chief Medical Officer Debra Houry and top officials for immunization and contagious diseases.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, responded with a social media post on Aug. 27 saying, \u201cThese high profile departures will require oversight\u201d by a Senate committee he chairs.\n\nThe shakeup comes after Kennedy was criticized for his mixed messaging on a measles outbreak, firing a vaccine advisory panel and cutting $500 million in funding for developing mRNA technology, which is used in the two most common COVID-19 vaccines. Cassidy has spoken out about some of Kennedy\u2019s moves, including slashing funding for mRNA research.\n\nA longtime vaccine skeptic, Kennedy in May withdrew a federal recommendation for COVID shots for pregnant women and healthy children and followed up in June by removing all 17 members of the CDC's expert vaccine panel.\n\nIn addition to calling for oversight after the CDC shakeup, Cassidy also said in a statement on Aug. 28 that the agency\u2019s vaccine advisory panel should indefinitely postpone a Sept. 18 meeting. Kennedy replaced the fired vaccine panel members with hand-picked advisers, including fellow anti-vaccine activists.\n\n\u201cThese decisions directly impact children\u2019s health and the meeting should not occur until significant oversight has been conducted,\u201d Cassidy said.\n\nCassidy said \u201cserious allegations\u201d have been made about the panel\u2019s \u201cmembership, and lack of scientific process being followed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in CDC leadership,\u201d he added.\n\nYet some health experts believe Cassidy deserves blame for what\u2019s happening as a physician in an important leadership position who was concerned about Kennedy\u2019s vaccine views but voted to confirm him anyway. As such, Cassidy needs to do more than oversight said Dr. Thomas Farley, the former top public health official in New York City and Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cCassidy now, I think, does bare some responsibility to stop (Kennedy) from causing more damage,\u201d Farley said, arguing Kennedy needs to be fired.\n\nCassidy's office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA longtime environmental lawyer, Kennedy has no educational background in medicine or health care. He ran for president as an independent in 2024 but dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump.\n\nAmong his most controversial statements that have been discredited: Antidepressants are related to school shootings, wi-fi causes cancer, fluoride in public water systems causes bone cancer and IQ loss, and COVID-19 was \u201cethnically targeted\u201d to attack \u201cCaucasians and Black people\u201d while sparing \u201cAshkenazi Jews and Chinese\u201d people.\n\nCassidy was considered a key swing vote during the confirmation process in January. Kennedy's nomination advanced 14-13 in the Senate Finance Committee with Cassidy's support.\n\n\"I've been struggling with your nomination,\" Cassidy bluntly told Kennedy during the confirmation process. \"Does a 71-year old man who spent decades criticizing vaccines\u2026 can he change his attitudes and approach now that he'll have the most important position influencing vaccine policy in the United States?\"\n\nThe Louisiana senator ultimately cast the decisive vote to move Kennedy\u2019s nomination forward in committee, and joined with every Republican other than Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, in voting on the Senate floor to confirm Kennedy as Health secretary.\n\nCassidy said in his floor speech that Kennedy and members of the Trump administration reached out to reassure him \"about their commitment to protecting the public health benefit of vaccination\" and he received \"assurances.\" The senator also promised to be on guard.\n\n\"If Mr. Kennedy is confirmed, I will use my authority... to rebuff any attempts to remove the public\u2019s access to life-saving vaccines without ironclad, causational scientific evidence that can be defended before the mainstream scientific community and before Congress,\" Cassidy said. \"I will carefully watch for any effort to wrongfully sow public fear about vaccines.\"\n\nCassidy\u2019s role in the confirmation process is now being resurfaced as Kennedy works to reshape the CDC in ways that many medical professionals find alarming.\n\nSome Kennedy critics are pointing the finger at Cassidy for his confirmation vote.\n\n\u201cJust one senator could have prevented most of this by not confirming RFK, Jr. And in my view, Cassidy, as a physician, is really the one to blame!\u201d Dr. Douglas Henley, the former executive vice president and CEO of the American Academy of Family Physicians, wrote on social media Aug. 28 in response to another doctor criticizing Kennedy after the CDC resignations.\n\nFarley believes Cassidy was under significant political pressure to approve President Donald Trump\u2019s HHS pick. He is up for reelection in 2026 in a state Trump carried by 22 percentage points.\n\n\u201cHe gave in to that pressure, so that was a mistake that we all potentially could suffer from,\u201d said Farley, who once worked at the CDC and on a Louisiana vaccination effort with Cassidy before he was senator. \u201cI hope he can figure out how to now fix that mistake.\u201d\n\nMonarez, a who has doctorate in microbiology and previously worked at the Department of Homeland Security, National Security Council and in the White House, was ousted less than one month after the Senate confirmed her to the role. Her attorneys said she was targeted because she \"refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts.\"\n\nKennedy said on Fox News that the CDC \u201cis in trouble, and we need to fix it, and we are fixing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it may be that some people should not be working there anymore,\u201d he added.\n\nFor Kennedy\u2019s critics, the past seven months have only confirmed their reservations about his fitness for the nation\u2019s top health job.\n\nDemocrats have called for Kennedy\u2019s termination amid the CDC upheaval.\n\nRep. Don Beyer, D-Virginia, called Kennedy a \u201ckook\u201d with \u201ccrackpot conspiracy theories\u201d in a social media post on Aug. 28 and said if President Donald Trump doesn\u2019t fire him he will \u201cbear the responsibility for the unnecessary and preventable illnesses and deaths that result.\"",

      "text": "Senate confirms Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services\nWASHINGTON \u2212 The Senate confirmed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the Health and Human Services secretary on Thursday, giving the longtime vaccine skeptic who has vowed to take on \"big pharma\" and ultra-processed food the power to oversee the nation\u2019s food and health care systems.\nKennedy, 71, a longtime environmental lawyer, was confirmed by a vote of 52-48. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who survived polio before Jonas Salk's breakthrough vaccine in the 1950s, voted against Kennedy after raising concerns about his position on vaccination. The former Republican majority leader has angered some of Trump's supporters for votes and views that conflict with the president's.\nAt his confirmation hearing, Kennedy, who has no academic background in medicine or health care, said his \u201cjourney into the issue of health\u201d began with his career as an attorney working with hunters, fishermen and communities along the Hudson River in New York.\n\u201cI learned that human health and environmental health are intertwined and inseparable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe same chemicals that kill fish also sicken human beings.\u201d\nKennedy\u2019s popularity among many, particularly mothers worried about additives and food dyes in the meals they consume, has largely been attributed to him calling out food companies. His platform is called \"Make America Healthy Again.\" The mothers call themselves MAHA Moms.\nHe has said he will \u201creorient federal health agencies toward chronic disease and rid them of Big Pharma\u2019s influence,\" and ban hundreds of food additives and chemicals that are already banned in other countries.\nPresident Donald Trump, for his part, has said he\u2019ll let Kennedy \u201cgo wild\u201d on food, health and medicine.\nAs the head of HHS, Kennedy will oversee the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nEver since Trump announced Kennedy as his pick to head HHS, medical professionals and public officials had been sounding the alarm on Kennedy\u2019s earlier statements undermining confidence in vaccines, including falsely linking them to autism. Decades of studies show vaccines do not cause autism.\nAmong his most controversial statements that have been discredited: Antidepressants are related to school shootings, Wi-Fi causes cancer, fluoride in public water systems causes bone cancer and IQ loss, and COVID-19 was \u201cethnically targeted\u201d to attack \u201cCaucasians and Black people\u201d while sparing \u201cAshkenazi Jews and Chinese\u201d people.\nBut the one that got the most airtime from senators was his views on vaccines.\nThroughout the two hearings, Kennedy insisted he was not \u201canti-vaccine\u201d but \u201cpro-safety.\u201d\n\u201cI'm pro-good science,\u201d he said. \u201cI worked for 40 years to raise awareness about mercury and other toxics and fish. And nobody called me anti-fish.\u201d\nRepublican Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, which questioned him on the second day of hearings, had said he was \u201cstruggling\u201d with his decision on whether to support Kennedy.\nA former physician, Cassidy said he wanted Kennedy to \"come out unequivocally\" and say vaccines are safe and they do not cause autism.\nBut ultimately, Cassidy, who is up for reelection in 2026, ended up supporting Kennedy, citing \u201cserious commitments\u201d he had received from both the candidate and the White House in the intervening days.\nIn a statement explaining his vote Thursday, McConnell noted he survived childhood polio and has watched vaccines \"save millions of lives\" in his lifetime.\nKennedy has \"a record of trafficking in dangerous conspiracy theories and eroding trust in public health institutions,\" the senator said.\n\"I will not condone the re-litigation of proven cures, and neither will millions of Americans who credit their survival and quality of life to scientific miracles,\" McConnell said. The administration \"deserves a leader who is willing to acknowledge without qualification the efficacy of life-saving vaccines and who can demonstrate an understanding of basic elements of the U.S. healthcare system. Mr. Kennedy failed to prove he is the best possible person to lead America\u2019s largest health agency.\"\nKennedy comes from one of the most well-known political dynasties in the U.S. and has suffered tragic losses in the public sphere.\nKennedy is the son of Robert F. Kennedy, who represented New York in the U.S. Senate and served as the U.S. attorney general. He was assassinated in 1968 while running for president. His uncle, President John F. Kennedy, was assassinated in 1963.\nContributing: Riley Beggin\n(This story was updated for clarity and to add new information.)"

      "text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) spoke on the U.S. Senate floor today to detail his decision to vote for Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to serve as U.S. Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Cassidy delivered the speech after voting to advance Kennedy\u2019s nomination in the U.S. Senate Finance Committee. The nomination now awaits a full vote in the U.S. Senate.\nCassidy\u2019s speech as prepared for delivery can be found below:\nMr. President, I\u2019d like to make a statement regarding my vote in Committee on behalf of Robert F. Kennedy to be the Secretary of HHS. First, I thank everyone who has contacted me over the last few days. Almost all have been respectful and seek the best for our country. And I\u2019ve been contacted by text, by phone, by email. And if I did not respond to anyone, it was not to be rude. It\u2019s just I was getting hundreds of messages a day personally and thousands through the office. And I just physically could not.\nNow Mr. President, believe it or not, of these hundreds of people calling me or contacting me, however they did, many of them disagreed with each other. Diametrically, three dimensionally, they disagreed. But the unifying factor is that they all desire the best for our country, even though they differ from each other so much. And maybe that kind of frames my feelings about this nomination.\nFor context, before entering politics, before ever thinking running for political office, I practiced medicine for 30 years in a public hospital for the uninsured. Caring for those who otherwise would not have been able to afford the access to the care that I provided. After seeing patients die from vaccine preventable diseases, I dedicated much of my time to vaccine research and immunization programs. Personally witnessing the safety monitoring, and the effectiveness of immunization. But simply, vaccines save lives.\nThis is the context that informed me when considering Robert F. Kennedy Jr as the nominee to be Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.\nIt was a decision I studied exhaustively. I took very seriously. As I said I would, I spoke with Mr. Kennedy not once, but multiple times over the weekend, including this morning. We had in-depth conversations about the medical literature and the science behind the safety of vaccines. He referred me to studies and people. I reviewed them and spoke to those whom he mentioned I should speak to.\nNow, the most notable opponents of Mr. Kennedy were pediatricians on the front lines of our children\u2019s health who regularly have to combat misinformation; combating vaccine skepticism with correct information\u2014correct information that comes from their education, training and experience as physicians. They are aware of the falling vaccine rates and the inevitability of increasing hospitalizations and deaths of children from vaccine-preventable diseases. They are aware that children are now contracting diseases that they would not have contracted if the children were vaccinated.\nI heard from others impassioned about the need to address chemicals in our food, and a belief that we are victims of large, impersonal forces maximizing profits while sacrificing our health. There is evidence for that. Although food safety is principally a USDA concern, I strongly agree that this is an issue society must address.\nOther RFK supporters are concerned regarding environmental risk. They fear these risks are being ignored by authorities. Mr. Kennedy\u2019s history of environmental activism motivates their support. I pointed out that the Environmental Protection Agency monitors this, not the Department of Health and Human Services but they still feel that he can make a difference.\nSo, as I looked how to resolve this, I returned to where I began. Would it be possible to have Mr. Kennedy collaborate in helping public health agencies re-earn the trust of the American people?\nRegarding vaccines, Mr. Kennedy has been insistent that he just wants good science and to ensure safety. But on this topic, the science is good, the science is credible. Vaccines save lives. They are safe. They do not cause autism. There are multiple studies that show this. They are a crucial part of our nation\u2019s public health response.\nBut as someone who has discussed immunizations with thousands of people, I do recognize that many mothers need reassurance that the vaccine their child is receiving is necessary, effective, and most of all safe.\nWhile I am aligned with Mr. Kennedy as regards to ultra-processed foods, reforming NIH, taking on chronic disease\u2014once more, it still leaves vaccines.\nNow, Mr. Kennedy and the administration reached out seeking to reassure me regarding their commitment to protecting the public health benefit of vaccination.\nTo this end, Mr. Kennedy and the administration committed that he and I will have an unprecedently close collaborative working relationship if he is confirmed. We will meet or speak multiple times a month. This collaboration will allow us to work well together and therefore to be more effective.\nMr. Kennedy has asked for my input into hiring decisions at HHS, beyond Senate-confirmed positions. This aspect of our collaboration will allow us to represent all sides of those folks that were contacting me this weekend.\nHe has also committed that he would work within the current vaccine approval and safety monitoring systems, and not establish parallel systems. If confirmed, he will maintain the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices without changes. CDC will not remove statements on their website pointing out that vaccines do not cause autism. Mr. Kennedy and the administration also committed that this administration will not use the subversive techniques employed under the Biden administration, like sue and settle, to change policies enacted by Congress without first going through Congress.\nMr. Kennedy and the administration committed to a strong role of Congress. Aside from us meeting regularly, he will come before the Committee on a quarterly basis, if requested. He committed that the HELP Committee Chair, whether it\u2019s me or someone else, may choose a representative on any board or commission formed to review vaccine safety.\nIf he is confirmed, HHS will provide a 30-day notice to the HELP Committee if the agency seeks to make changes to any of our federal vaccine safety monitoring programs, and HELP Committee will have the option to call a hearing to further review.\nThese commitments, and my expectation that we can have a great relationship to make America healthy again, is the basis of my support. He will be Secretary, but I believe he will also be a partner in working for this end.\nIf Mr. Kennedy is confirmed, I will use my authority as Chairman of the Senate Committee with oversight of HHS to rebuff any attempts to remove the public\u2019s access to life-saving vaccines without ironclad, causational scientific evidence that can be defended before the mainstream scientific community and before Congress. I will carefully watch for any effort to wrongfully sow public fear about vaccines between confusing references of coincidence and anecdote.\nBut my support is built on assurances that this will not have to be a concern and that he and I can work together to build an agenda to make America healthy again.\nWe need a leader at HHS who will guide President Trump\u2019s agenda to Make America Healthy Again. Based on Mr. Kennedy\u2019s assurances on vaccines and his platform to positively influence Americans\u2019 health, it is my consideration that he will get this done.\nAs I\u2019ve said, it\u2019s been a long, intense process. But I\u2019ve assessed it as I would assess a patient as a physician. Ultimately, restoring trust in our public health institutions is too important and I think Mr. Kennedy can get that done. And as Chairman of the Senate committee with oversight authority of HHS, I will do my best to make sure that is what we accomplish.\nI want Mr. Kennedy to succeed in making America healthy again. His success will be tied to the health of our nation. He has the opportunity to address the most pertinent issues affecting Americans\u2019 health. We also need to reform our health institutions like FDA and NIH. Those, as already been indicated, are my priorities as Chairman of HELP Committee. I look forward to his support in accomplishing this.\nIf confirmed, I look forward to working together with Mr. Kennedy to achieve President Trump\u2019s mission of improving the health of all Americans.\n###"

      "text": "RFK Jr. says COVID may have been \u2018ethnically targeted\u2019 to spare Jews\nDemocratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dished out wild COVID-19 conspiracy theories this week during a press event at an Upper East Side restaurant, claiming the bug was a genetically engineered bioweapon that may have been \u201cethnically targeted\u201d to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people.\nKennedy floated the idea during a question-and-answer portion of raucous booze and fart-filled dinner at Tony\u2019s Di Napoli on East 63d Street.\n\u201cCOVID-19. There is an argument that it is ethnically targeted. COVID-19 attacks certain races disproportionately,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cCOVID-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether it was deliberately targeted or not but there are papers out there that show the racial or ethnic differential and impact,\u201d Kennedy hedged.\nIn between bites of linguini and clam sauce, Kennedy, 69, warned of more dire biological weapons in the pipeline with a \u201c50% infection fatality rate\u201d that would make COVID-19 \u201clook like a walk in the park.\u201d\n\u201cWe do know that the Chinese are spending hundreds of millions of dollars developing ethnic bioweapons and we are developing ethnic bioweapons,\u201d he claimed. \u201cThey\u2019re collecting Russian DNA. They\u2019re collecting Chinese DNA so we can target people by race.\u201d\nThere has been a growing consensus among US intelligence agencies that COVID-19 was man-made and escaped from a lab in Wuhan, China \u2014 but there is no evidence it was designed to spare certain religious groups or ethnicities, and Kennedy offered no studies to support his claims.\nKennedy\u2019s remark echoes well-worn anti-Semitic literature blaming Jews for the emergence and spread of coronavirus which began circulating online shortly after the pandemic broke out, according to The Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry at the University of Tel Aviv\u2019s 2021 Antisemitism Worldwide Report.\nA 2020 Oxford University study found nearly 1 in 5 British people believed Jews created the coronavirus pandemic for financial gain.\n\u201cNo no no no no,\u201d said Dr. Monica Gandhi Professor of medicine and infectious disease at the University of California, San Francisco, and a longtime critic of pandemic-related school closures. \u201cI don\u2019t see any evidence that there was any design or bioterrorism that anyone tried to design something to knock off certain groups.\u201d\nJewish organizations blasted Kennedy for his remarks.\n\u201cThis is crazy,\u201d said Morton Klein, President of the right-leaning Zionist Organization of America. \u201cIt makes no sense that they would do that. I read everything. I was totally against the vaccine. . . I wanted to convince myself it was correct not to take it. I have never seen anything like this.\u201d\nKlein, who said he had been advising Kennedy on Israel issues and called him a \u201cgood friend,\u201d said the remark left him \u201cworried.\u201d\nThe son of former Attorney General Robert Kennedy and nephew of former President Kennedy has in the past palled around with Nation of Islam leader and notorious anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan.\nHe also met with NOI leadership in Los Angeles in 2020 and told them the COVID vaccine had been \u201cgenetically modified to attack black and Latino boys.\u201d\nThe left-leaning Anti-Defamation League went further saying in a statement saying: \u201cThe claim that COVID-19 was a bioweapon created by the Chinese or Jews to attack Caucasians and black people is deeply offensive and feeds into sinophobic and anti-semitic conspiracy theories about COVID-19 that we have seen evolve over the last three years.\u201d\nKennedy\u2019s campaign has drawn in disaffected elements of both the right and left seeking an alternative to mainstream candidates.\nSome polls have shown him garnering 20% support among primary voters.\nKennedy called The Post\u2019s \u201cmistaken,\u201d tweeting Saturday that the event had been off the record, but event organizer Doug Dechert told The Post it was on the record.\nA second event attendee confirmed to The Post Dechert told him the same thing.\n\u201cThe U.S. and other governments are developing ethnically targeted bioweapons and that a 2021 study of the COVID-19 virus shows that COVID-19 appears to disproportionately affect certain races,\u201d Kennedy tweeted \u2014 reiterating his remarks from the dinner. \u201cThe furin cleave docking site is most compatible with blacks and Caucasians and least compatible with ethnic Chinese, Finns, and Ashkenazi Jews. In that sense, it serves as a kind of proof of concept for ethnically targeted bioweapons.\u201d\n\u201cI do not believe and never implied that the ethnic effect was deliberately engineered,\u201d he added \u2014 clarifying his recorded remarks."

      "text": "Schumer demands RFK Jr. declare measles emergency, saying he 'walked' US into outbreak\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer demanded Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. declare a nationwide emergency over spiking measles cases, accusing him of fueling the outbreak by dismantling public health and undermining trust in vaccines.\n\"Under your tutelage as Secretary, you have undermined vaccines, gutted public health funding, and dismantled core federal protections meant to keep Americans safe,\" Schumer wrote in a July 11 letter.\n\"You have walked our country into the nation\u2019s largest measles outbreak in 33 years,\" he added.\nMeasles cases skyrocket, especially in unvaccinated\nA quarter century after measles were eradicated in the U.S., cases have skyrocketed this year, reaching 1,288 confirmed cases across 39 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Three people have died this year. Officials say almost nine in ten of the cases are spread across New Mexico and Texas, the site of a Mennonite community that became the initial hub of the outbreak earlier this year.\nMost cases \u2013 65% \u2013 are in people 19 years old and younger, and the vast majority \u2013 92% \u2013 are unvaccinated people.\nThe outbreak has turned attention and heavy criticism from health experts towards Kennedy's vaccine skepticism and baseless claims that vaccines are dangerous and ineffective. Kennedy has said the measles vaccine weakens over time \u2013 a claim disputed by scientists \u2013 and that \"we can't rely simply on the vaccine\" to address the outbreak.\nHe has also downplayed the measles outbreak, saying more focus should be turned on chronic diseases like diabetes and autism instead.\nIn May, Kennedy directed the CDC to find new \"scientific process\" for treating measles and other diseases with drugs and vitamins. Although vaccines would still be recommended as the best way to prevent the disease, some \"may choose not to vaccinate.\"\nKennedy fired all 17 members of a vaccine advisory last month, refilling it with some vaccine skeptics who have announced their first priority would be retooling vaccine recommendations for children.\nKennedy's drastic cuts to department programs and slashing of thousands of workers at the department have sparked alarm from public health experts and outrage from Democratic lawmakers. Kennedy said in April he would sack 10,000 Health and Human Services employees as part of the Trump administration's efforts to downsize the federal workforce.\nSince then, the department has faced a myriad of legal challenges, most recently from top medical organizations over Kennedy dropping the COVID vaccine from the list of recommended shots for children and pregnant women.\nHHS said the CDC still recommends the measles vaccine as the best way to protect against the disease.\n\"The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,\" an HHS spokesperson said in a statement. \"People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get inoculated and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.\"\nSchumer is the latest Democrat on Capitol Hill to upbraid Kennedy in recent days over the measles outbreak.\n\"We have a record-breaking number of measles cases in America,\" Sen. Patty Murray, D-WA, wrote on X, accusing Kennedy of filling the vaccine panel with \"unvetted vaccine skeptics.\"\n\"Where is our public hearing on this crisis?\"\nThe measles vaccine is 97% effective at preventing the disease when administered in the recommended two doses, according to the CDC.\nSince the start of the COVID pandemic, when skepticism of vaccines surged, buoyed by online conspiracies and distrust of public health institutions, measles vaccinations have dropped across the nation."

      "text": "RFK Jr. clears key Senate committee, moving Trump's HHS pick to full Senate\nWASHINGTON \u2015 Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump's nominee to be the nation's top health official, moved closer toward confirmation Tuesday, with the Senate Finance Committee voting along party lines to send his controversial nomination to the full Senate.\nBy a 14-13 vote, the committee voted to advance Kennedy, who has faced intense scrutiny over his past anti-vaccine statements and questions about how he would lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\nThe key swing vote putting Kennedy over the edge was Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a physician who fell in line with the Republican majority and voted for Kennedy despite raising reservations about Kennedy's position on vaccines.\nCassidy, who is up for reelection in 2026, announced his support shortly before the vote in a post on X, saying he had \"very intense conversations\" with Kennedy and the White House over the weekend. \"With the serious commitments I\u2019ve received from the administration and the opportunity to make progress on the issues we agree on like healthy foods and a pro-American agenda, I will vote yes,\" Cassidy said.\nWhat the Trump administration means for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter.\nThe vote came after Kennedy was grilled by Democrats during two days of committee hearings last week. He struggled to account for past statements he made questioning vaccines and conspiracy theories he's pushed and stumbled over questions about Medicare and Medicaid. Democrats led the\n\u201cI simply do not trust him to oversee the CDC,\u201d Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., said. \u201cHe\u2019s unqualified, and I dare say everybody here knows it.\u201d\nOutside of Trump's Defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, Republican senators have stayed united behind the president's Cabinet picks, but Kennedy's nomination as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services has presented the biggest test yet.\nIt's unclear whether Kennedy has the votes for passage in the Senate, but at least four Republican senators would likely have to vote against Kennedy for his nomination to fail given Republican's 53-47 majority.\nRanking member Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said Democrats are not done trying to block Kennedy\u2019s confirmation, despite Tuesday\u2019s notable setback.\n\u201cThis fight is going to go on. And I\u2019m going to pull out all the stops,\u201d Wyden said, without elaborating what those stops are and acknowledging that Republicans have been reticent to alienate themselves from Trump over his Cabinet nominees.\n\u201cObviously it is a challenging political time,\u201d Wyden said, but, \u201cthe fight is not over. We can continue this on the floor of the Senate.\"\nSen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a polio survivor, has raised concerns over Kennedy's position on vaccines. And Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine have showed a willingness to buck Trump when it comes to his nominees when they voted against the Hegseth pick.\nYet even if all three were to vote against Kennedy's nomination, Vice President JD Vance would be in position to cast a tie-breaking vote, like he did with Hegseth, if at least one more Republican senator didn't also vote against Kennedy.\nKennedy's fate in the Finance Committee came down to Cassidy, R-La., a physician, who had talked openly about being torn over Kennedy because of his views on vaccines. But the vote also posed tough political considerations for Cassidy, who has already drawn a Republican primary challenger in 2026 after voting to convict Trump during the president's second impeachment in 2021.\n\"I've been struggling with your nomination,\" Cassidy bluntly told Kennedy during last week's hearings. \"Does a 71-year old man who spent decades criticizing vaccines and was financially vested in finding fault with vaccines, can he change his attitudes and approach now that he'll have the most important position influencing vaccine policy in the United States?\"\nDemocrats have attacked Kennedy for a trail of controversial past statements including casting doubt about vaccines, comparing the CDC's work to \"Nazi death camps,\" saying it \"highly likely\" Lyme disease was a military bioweapon and concerns about antidepressants.\nKennedy insisted repeatedly during last week's committee hearings that he is \"not anti-vaccine\" and is \"pro-safety.\"\nBut Democrats have raised his founding of the nonprofit Children\u2019s Health Defense, which has supported vaccine litigation. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., noted that the nonprofit currently sells clothing for infants with the words \u201cunvaxxed unfraid\u201d and \u201cno vax no problem.\u201d\n\u201cYou say you\u2019re pro vaccine,\" Sanders said last week, \"And yet your organization is making money selling a child\u2019s product to parents for 26 bucks which casts fundamental doubt on the usefulness of vaccines.\"\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison."

      "text": "RFK Jr. is canceling mRNA vaccine development. Can I still get a COVID vaccine?\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. revealed his agency will be cutting funding to mRNA development, calling the vaccine technology \"ineffective\" and claiming it poses more risks than benefits.\nIn a video posted on X Aug. 5, Kennedy said the decision will impact 22 projects worth nearly $500 million at the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which helps companies develop medical supplies to address public health threats.\nMessenger RNA, or mRNA, is used in the two most common COVID-19 vaccines licensed in the United States. Kennedy\u2019s announcement has raised questions about these vaccines, how mRNA works and what this decision means for future research.\n\"This technology played a vital role in our pandemic response and continues to show promise for treating serious diseases,\" said Jeff Coller, Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of RNA biology and therapeutics at Johns Hopkins University. \"As other countries advance these proven, safe and effective therapies, American patients may increasingly depend on foreign innovation for breakthrough treatments.\"\nHow do mRNA vaccines work?\nThe COVID-19 vaccine works by instructing the body\u2019s immune system to recognize the virus and creating fighting antibodies to attack it.\nMessenger RNA, or mRNA, is a code that tells the body\u2019s cells to produce just a piece of the virus, the protein on the surface. The code is protected by a lipid coating, like a fat bubble.\nOnce injected into the body, the vaccine releases the mRNA to program the cell to produce the spike proteins like those on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 virus. Our immune system recognizes those vaccine-created spike proteins as invaders and creates antibodies to block future attacks from the virus.\nMessenger RNA vaccines contain only a fraction of the virus, so unlike some vaccines, they can't give people the disease they're trying to prevent or trigger allergies to eggs or other traditional vaccine ingredients.\nWhat did RFK say about mRNA?\nIn the video posted on X, Kennedy claimed mRNA vaccines were ineffective against mutated versions of the virus and revealed HHS is planning to reallocate the funding to research whole-virus vaccines, which use a weakened version of the virus.\nKennedy\u2019s video \u201crepresents a fundamental misunderstanding of science,\u201d Coller said. Vaccines using mRNA technology can still be effective against slightly mutated versions of the virus. And even if a mutated virus is able to evade immunity, scientists can modify the mRNA code to create a new vaccine that would target the mutated protein more quickly than other vaccine technologies.\nAdditionally, Coller said whole-virus vaccines tend to produce more side effects than other types of shots that are protein-based or mRNA because the vaccine introduces more viral particles to the human body. There\u2019s also a slight risk that a person can become ill with the disease the vaccine is meant to prevent.\nWhat does defunding mRNA technology mean?\nThe most obvious consequence of defunding mRNA vaccine development is losing resources to continue improving the technology for vaccines that target infectious diseases, such as COVID-19 and the bird flu, and cancers, Coller said.\nHowever, he also said it sends a \u201cchilling\u201d message to vaccine companies about continuing this type of research in the United States. While they may be able to afford research without federal help, companies could be hesitant to pursue mRNA technology if there\u2019s a chance the Food and Drug Administration may not approve their vaccines.\nThis could lead companies to move operations and marketing to other countries, which would not only make these therapies more expensive in the United States, but also displace it as \u201cthe world leader in biotechnology,\u201d Coller said.\n\u201cThe rest of the world is doubling down on mRNA medicines. It\u2019s a fact, and the U.S. is going to lose the race,\u201d Coller said. \u201cThe decision coming from Kennedy is essentially destroying our dominance in the biotech space.\u201d\nShould I expect a COVID vaccine this fall?\nIt's unclear whether patients should be expecting COVID-19 vaccines this fall, said Dr. Beth Oller, a family physician in Stockton, Kansas, and clinical instructor at the University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita.\nIn June, Kennedy fired all members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a key vaccine panel that makes recommendations for COVID-19 and other vaccines, and appointed eight new members. During its first meeting, the committee did not make any recommendations for the fall and isn\u2019t expected to reconvene until \"September/October,\" according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.\nKennedy said on May 27 that the COVID-19 vaccine would no longer be included in the CDC's recommended immunization schedule for healthy children and pregnant women, a move that broke with previous expert guidance and bypassed the normal scientific review process.\nUnder the changes, the only people who will be recommended for COVID-19 vaccines are those over 65 and people with existing health problems. This could make it harder for others who want the COVID-19 vaccine to get it, including health care workers and healthy people under 65 with a vulnerable family member or those who want to reduce their short-term risk of infection.\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), among other organizations, issued statements condemning the change, with the ACOG saying it was \"...concerned about and extremely disappointed by the announcement that HHS will no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy.\"\nWill insurance cover my COVID shot?\nMany consumers are worried about possible cuts to health insurers' coverage of vaccines, a recent poll said.\nA KFF poll published Aug. 1 found 40% of adults said they will \"definitely\" or \"probably\" get a COVID-19 vaccine shot. Of those who intend to get vaccinated, 62% said they are worried insurance won\u2019t cover the cost of the vaccine.\nGroups representing commercial health insurance companies said they still plan to cover vaccines recommended by the CDC and ACIP, the vaccine advisory panel.\n\"Health plans continue to follow federal requirements related to coverage of ACIP-recommended vaccines and will continue to support broad access to critical preventive services, including immunizations,\" said Tina Stow, spokesperson for AHIP, which represents health insurance companies.\nThe CDC currently recommends shared decision-making between parents and doctors for immunizing children with the COVID-19 vaccine. It also recommends vaccines for people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised.\nLarge employers that provide health insurance benefits for workers and their families will likely continue to cover FDA-approved vaccines, said James Gelfand, president and CEO of the ERISA Industry Committee.\nIn some cases, employer vaccine coverage might follow FDA approvals rather than narrower ACIP recommendations.Contributing: Mary Walrath-Holdridge\nAdrianna Rodriguez can be reached at adrodriguez@usatoday.com."

Kennedy Jr., yet she is refusing to step down from her post.\nOfficial notification of her termination from the White House came late on Aug. 27 after her attorneys denied she had been ousted, even after HHS announced earlier in the day that Monarez was no longer the CDC director.\nStill, following the notification, attorneys for Monarez said that as a presidential-appointed, Senate-confirmed officer, only President Donald Trump can fire their client. They said notice from a White House staffer in the personnel office did not satisfy that requirement.\n\"For this reason, we reject the notification Dr. Monarez has received as legally deficient and she remains as CDC Director. We have notified the White House Counsel of our position,\" Monarez's attorneys, Mark Zaid and Abbe Lowell, said in a statement.\nMonarez's contested ouster, less than one month after the Senate confirmed her to the role, was followed by resignations from three other top CDC officials in protest of Kennedy's leadership, including his direction on vaccines.\nZaid and Lowell, in an earlier statement, accused Kennedy and the HHS of \"weaponizing public health for political gain and putting millions of American lives at risk,\" They said Monarez had neither resigned nor received notification from the White House of her firing, adding that she was targeted because she \"refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts.\"\nThe White House responded with a statement shortly afterward.\n\"As her attorney\u2019s statement makes abundantly clear, Susan Monarez is not aligned with the President\u2019s agenda of Making America Healthy Again,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said. \"Since Susan Monarez refused to resign despite informing HHS leadership of her intent to do so, the White House has terminated Monarez from her position with the CDC.\"\nKennedy, a longtime skeptic of vaccines, had pushed for Monarez to support changes to the CDC's vaccine policy, The Washington Post and New York Times reported, both citing multiple anonymous sources. After she refused, Kennedy and White House officials directed her to either resign or be fired, a source told USA TODAY.\nMonarez's legal team said she is weighing legal action to challenge her termination. \"All moves (are) under consideration. We do not consider her legally fired,\" Zaid said.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, during an Aug. 28 briefing with reporters, said it was Trump who fired Monarez after she refused to step down when RFK Jr. asked her to resign.\n\"This woman has never received a vote in her life,\" Leavitt said. \"The president has the authority to fire those who are not aligned with his mission.\"\nWithout specifying a reason for Monarez's exit, HHS said in an earlier statement posted on social media, \"We thank her for her dedicated service to the American people.\" HHS did not respond to a request from USA TODAY seeking additional information.\nResignation letters followed on Aug. 27 from CDC Chief Medical Officer Debra Houry, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases Director Demetre Daskalakis, and National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases Director Daniel Jernigan.\nDaskalakis, in his resignation letter, said recent CDC changes to the adult and children\u2019s immunization schedule \"threaten the lives of the youngest Americans and pregnant people.\"\n\"I am unable to serve in an environment that treats CDC as a tool to generate policies and materials that do not reflect scientific reality and are designed to hurt rather than to improve the public\u2019s health,\" Daskalakis said.\nHe added that it's \"untenable to serve in an organization that is not afforded the opportunity to discuss decisions of scientific and public health importance released under the moniker of CDC.\"\nMonarez, a federal government scientist, was confirmed by the Senate on July 29 to lead the CDC after Trump nominated her earlier in the year. She was sworn in by Kennedy on July 31.\nHer departure from the agency follows a shooting at the CDC's headquarters in Atlanta earlier in the month.\nMonarez was the Trump administration's second nominee for the role. In March, the president withdrew his nomination of former Republican congressman and vaccine critic Dave Weldon, a Kennedy ally, just hours before his scheduled confirmation hearing.\nSince being named the top U.S. health official, Kennedy has targeted vaccine policy, and in May withdrew a federal recommendation for COVID shots for pregnant women and healthy children.\nHe followed up in June by firing all members of the CDC's expert vaccine advisory panel, which recommends how they are used and by whom, and replacing them with hand-picked advisers, including fellow anti-vaccine activists.\nKennedy has made major decisions on vaccines in the absence of a CDC director while Monarez awaited confirmation and continued to do so afterwards. Her departure comes on the same day that Kennedy announced changes to COVID vaccine eligibility.\nThis story has been updated with new information.\nContributing: Reuters\nReach Joey Garrison on X @Joeygarrison."

Kennedy Jr. has fired all 17 members of a committee that advises the federal government on vaccine safety and will replace them with new members, a move that the Trump administration's critics warned would create public distrust around the government's role in promoting public health.\nAt issue is the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, which makes recommendations on the safety, efficacy and clinical need of vaccines to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It comprises medical and public health experts who develop recommendations on the use of vaccines in the civilian population of the United States.\n\u201cToday we are prioritizing the restoration of public trust above any specific pro- or anti-vaccine agenda,\u201d Kennedy, who has a history of controversial views on vaccines, said on June 9 in announcing the overhaul. \u201cThe public must know that unbiased science \u2013 evaluated through a transparent process and insulated from conflicts of interest \u2013 guides the recommendations of our health agencies.\u201d\nKennedy's decision marks a reversal from what a key Republican senator said the Trump Cabinet member had promised during his confirmation hearings earlier this year.

An HHS source familiar with the details told USA TODAY that the new members of the panel will attend the session.\n'Fixing a problem that doesn't exist'\nCritics of the Trump administration warned that Kennedy's move was not necessary, undermines the government's role in vaccine safety and could lead to more deadly disease transmissions.\nDr. Paul A. Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the Food and Drug Administration Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, told USA TODAY that Kennedy was \"fixing a problem that doesn't exist.\"\nPicking members for the committee generally involves a three- to four-month vetting process by the CDC. \"Now he's just going to pick people he likes,\" Offit added. \"Presumably people who are like-minded, and I think that will shake confidence in this committee.\"\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Kennedy and the Trump administration are \"taking a wrecking ball to the programs that keep Americans safe and healthy.\"\nThe New York Democrat added that wiping out an entire panel of vaccine experts doesn\u2019t build trust \u2013 it shatters it. \"Worse, it sends a chilling message: that ideology matters more than evidence, and politics more than public health,\" he said.\nDr. Bruce Scott, president of the American Medical Association, warned that Kennedy's work has undermined trust and \"upends a transparent process that has saved countless lives.\"\n\"With an ongoing measles outbreak and routine child vaccination rates declining, this move will further fuel the spread of vaccine-preventable illnesses,\" he said.\nA measles outbreak recently killed two unvaccinated children in Texas. The CDC said the deaths were the first from measles in the United States since 2015. Kennedy has backed vaccination as a preventive tool during a measles outbreak but also said that vaccines should be left to parents' discretion.\nAs of June 5, a total of 1,168 confirmed measles cases were reported by 34 jurisdictions. The CDC also reported three deaths due to the outbreak."

      "text": "Senator snaps back at RFK Jr. for linking antidepressants to Minnesota shooting\nSen. Tina Smith, D-Minnesota, said Kennedy should be fired after he suggested antidepressants played a role in the Aug. 27 shooting at Annunciation Catholic School.\n- \u201cWe need to explain why all this violence is happening and we need to look at every possibility,\u201d Kennedy said.\n- A 2019 study found most school shooters don\u2019t appear to have been prescribed psychotropic drugs and found no \"causal association.\u201d\n- \u201cI dare you to go to Annunciation School and tell our grieving community, in effect, guns don\u2019t kill kids, antidepressants do,\u201d Smith wrote to Kennedy on social media.\n- Two children were killed and 18 people were wounded in the attack at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in the wake of the Minneapolis school shooting that his agency would study whether antidepressants and other psychiatric drugs \u201cmight be contributing to violence,\u201d prompting a Minnesota senator to accuse him of \"peddling bulls---.\"\nKennedy, in a Fox News interview, said HHS is looking at a group of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and \u201csome of the other psychiatric drugs.\u201d The Health secretary has long raised concerns about SSRIs and linked them to school shootings.\nA 2019 study found most school shooters don\u2019t appear to have been prescribed psychotropic drugs and \u201cwhen they were, no direct or causal association was found.\u201d\nSen. Tina Smith, D-Minnesota, said Kennedy is focused on the wrong issue.\n\u201cI dare you to go to Annunciation School and tell our grieving community, in effect, guns don\u2019t kill kids, antidepressants do,\u201d Smith wrote on social media. \u201cJust shut up. Stop peddling bulls---. You should be fired.\u201d\nPolice say Robin Westman, 23, opened fire at Annunciation Catholic School, killing two children and injuring 18 people. Westman wrote in a journal about suffering from depression and having suicidal and homicidal thoughts, according to media reports. It\u2019s unclear if Westman was taking any psychiatric drugs.\n\u201cWe need to explain why all this violence is happening and we need to look at every possibility,\u201d Kennedy said on Fox.\nDemocrats, in the wake of yet another shooting, are raising concerns about access to guns.\n\u201cThere are 400 million guns in this country,\u201d Smith wrote on social media. \u201cMore guns than people. In America, we are ten times more likely to be shot in a school or playground than any other developed nation.\u201d\nKennedy said during an Aug. 28 news conference in Texas that \"people have had guns in this country forever.\"\n\"Something changed, and it dramatically changed human behavior, and one of the culprits we need to examine is whether the fact that we are the most over-medicated nation in the world,\" he added.\nSome conservatives have also focused on Westman\u2019s gender identity.\nWestman\u2019s name was legally changed to Robin because \u201cminor child identifies as female,\u201d a judge wrote, according to media reports. Kennedy\u2019s Fox News comments were prompted by questions about Westman\u2019s transition process from male to female.\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said at a news conference that \u201canybody who is using this as an opportunity to villainize our trans community or any other community out there has lost their sense of common humanity.\u201d\nKennedy is a longtime vaccine skeptic whose views on several health matters are considered fringe by mainstream experts. His tenure as the nation's top health official has been tumultuous. He has sought to oust Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez amid a policy disagreement, but she is refusing to step down.\nMonarez's contested ouster, less than one month after the Senate confirmed her to the role, prompted the resignations of three other top CDC officials in protest of Kennedy's leadership, including his direction on vaccines.\nContributing: Ben Adler, Joey Garrison\n(This story has been updated to add new information.)"

  "argos_summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has sparked a crisis at the CDC by firing Director Susan Monarez over vaccine policy disagreements, leading to resignations of top officials and a congressional call for oversight. Senator Bill Cassidy, who helped confirm Kennedy, has urged the Senate to postpone the CDC\u2019s upcoming advisory meeting amid accusations of politicizing vaccine science. The turmoil reflects Kennedy\u2019s broader agenda of cutting vaccine funding, replacing the advisory panel with skeptics, and reshaping public health guidance, raising concerns about the U.S. ability to manage vaccine-preventable diseases and maintain scientific credibility.",
