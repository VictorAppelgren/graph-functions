  "description": "The movement of flood-related bills in the Texas House on Monday could amp up political pressure on Democrats who have left the state to block redistricting.",
  "content": "AUSTIN \u2014 Texas House Republicans teed up a slate of bills addressing the deadly July 4 Hill Country floods on Monday, but Democrats\u2019 continued boycott left the chamber without the quorum needed to vote \u2014 setting the stage for Republicans to use the flood relief measures as leverage against their absent colleagues.\n\nThe Texas House has remained at an impasse since Aug. 4, after enough Democrats refused to show up at the Capitol to block a vote on a partisan congressional redistricting proposal. So far, Democrats\u2019 denial of a constitutionally required two-thirds quorum has blocked only redistricting.\n\nBut Monday\u2019s advancement of five bills related to the floods now hands Republicans fresh political leverage in their attempts to convince enough Democrats to return to the Austin to restore a quorum in the Texas House.\n\nThe flood bills are set for a vote Tuesday. The five pieces of legislation include House Bill 1, which requires the state to develop a mass fatality training program for justices of the peace in counties without a medical examiner.\n\nOther flood-related proposals advanced Monday would address first responders\u2019 communications, expand a taxpayer fund for broadband access or response, communications and early warning systems in disasters and other emergencies, require some riverside campgrounds to develop disaster plans and combat disaster relief fraud.\n\nThe July 4 floods killed at least 137 people. The damage was most severe in Kerr County, where 27 children and counselors were killed at an all-girls summer camp near Hunt.\n\nAt a news conference Monday in northwest Chicago, Rep. Gene Wu, a Houston Democrat and chair of the House Democratic Caucus, said absent Democrats would return to Texas if flood bills are placed ahead of redistricting.\n\n\u201cWe have said point blank, time after time after time that if Gov. [Greg] Abbott says, \u2018We will take care of the people of the state of Texas first,\u2019 \u2013 if he makes that commitment today, we\u2019ll be back,\u201d Wu said.\n\nHouse Democrats were joined by Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin Monday. The quorum breakers had intended to meet with Durbin last week, but canceled the event after a bomb threat was made to the St. Charles, Ill., hotel where they had been staying.\n\nThey have since moved to a secret location in the Chicago area.\n\nRep. Mihaela Plesa, D-Dallas, said that since the bomb threat, her colleagues have received racist attacks. Texas Republican leaders, including Abbott, Attorney General Ken Paxton and Sen. John Cornyn have also taken action against Democrats with lawsuits and calling on the FBI to track them.\n\nHouse Speaker Dustin Burrows issued civil arrest warrants for absent Democrats, empowering state law enforcement to force them to return to the Capitol. Paxton has filed a pair of lawsuits in an attempt to require law enforcement in Illinois and California to enforce those warrants.\n\nPlesa said state law enforcement has visited her North Dallas home multiple times, including Monday morning. Abbott posted a wanted poster of Plesa Monday on social media. She is one of 13 House members Paxton is trying to remove from office.\n\n\u201cWe will not be intimidated,\u201d Plesa said. \u201cWe will not be bullied into silence, and we will not surrender like the governor has to the demands of corrupt DC politicians.\u201d\n\nThe Texas House was set to meet at 1 p.m. Monday. The redistricting proposal was set for another vote.\n\nIt would transform three Democratically held districts, including a North Texas seat represented by Rep. Julie Johnson, D-Farmers Branch, from liberal strongholds to districts that would sharply favor Republicans.\n\nTwo South Texas swing districts would also be shifted to the right.\n\nTrump has called on Texas lawmakers to flip at least five Democratic seats to Republican control in hopes of maintaining a GOP majority in the U.S. House of Representatives in next year\u2019s midterm election.",

      "text": "Texas Republicans have proposed a redistricting plan that would eliminate one Democratically held seat each from Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston and the Austin/San Antonio area.\nDistrict lines would also be redrawn in South Texas, pushing two seats currently held by Democrats toward stronger Republican majorities, according to an analysis based on 2024 election results.\nThe plan also further condenses some urban Democratic strongholds. The result would create two majority Black districts \u2014 Congressional District 30, currently represented by Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Dallas, and Congressional District 18 in Houston, a vacant seat that was represented by Rep. Sylvester Turner until his death in March. They would be the only two majority Black congressional districts in Texas.\nThe map\u2019s release unleashed intense criticism from Democrats, raising the prospect of blue states like California redrawing their boundaries to offset Republican gains in Texas. Democrats in the Texas Legislature fled the state Sunday in order to delay or prevent a vote on the plan.\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott on Sunday threatened to remove from office Democratic lawmakers who don\u2019t show up when the House convenes Monday afternoon.\nPresident Donald Trump has called on Texas lawmakers to change boundaries that he believes could result in Republicans gaining as many as five seats now held by Democrats and help the GOP maintain control of Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Midterms generally favor the party out of power in the White House, and in 2026 are expected to favor Democrats.\nMore subtle changes are made to two Democrat-held districts in South Texas, where Republicans appear to be betting their gains among Latino communities will hold steady.\nThe three urban districts see the most drastic changes. Johnson\u2019s seat, for instance, is a relatively compact district containing parts of Dallas surrounding White Rock Lake, as well as suburban areas in Richardson, Addison and Plano that have shifted toward Democrats in recent years.\nIt would be redrawn to stretch from Carrollton eastward to the rural city of Gilmer, a two-and-a-half-hour drive between the two cities. The resulting district would shift 41 percentage points to the right, transforming from a district that heavily favored former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024\u2019s election to one that would have voted for Trump by nearly 18 points."

      "text": "ST. CHARLES, Ill. \u2014 Leaving behind his nearly nine months pregnant wife, Kendall Scudder trekked to Tulsa, Okla., on June 28 to meet with Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.\nScudder, the newly elected chair of the Texas Democratic Party, arranged to have a private meeting with the governor at the site of a fundraiser for Oklahoma Democrats, where Pritzker was a keynote speaker. One of the topics he wished to broach was a persistent rumor circulating in Austin for months: redistricting.\n\u201cI knew that we needed to start forming relationships with partners outside the state in the event that we needed to use those relationships,\u201d Scudder said.\nFive weeks later, Scudder had a 2-week-old son, Lyndon \u2014 named for the former president and his wife\u2019s father \u2014 and an exodus of state House Democrats from Texas was underway, with dozens secretly fleeing to Illinois to block a vote on a partisan gerrymander that could flip as many as five Democratic-held seats to Republican control.\nFor the past week, the Texas House has been at a standstill after Democrats refused to show up on Aug. 4, denying the chamber a constitutionally required quorum to conduct legislative business. Their move \u2014 known as a quorum break \u2014 blocked a vote on congressional redistricting sought by President Donald Trump, as well as more than a dozen other items Gov. Greg Abbott placed on a special session agenda \u2014 most notably efforts to address the Hill Country floods that killed at least 137 people.\nThe Dallas Morning News spoke with more than 20 House Democrats and staff who have been decamped in Illinois for the past week. Their accounts offer an inside look at how they decided to employ the nuclear option to block redistricting and how they pushed redistricting into the national spotlight amid Republican backlash and growing security concerns.\nThe rumors\nRep. Ramon Romero Jr., D-Fort Worth, said he first heard rumors of redistricting in the early spring. Education policy dominated the session. It seemed there would be little room for something as politically thorny as redistricting.\n\u201cNo one really took it seriously,\u201d Romero said.\nDemocrats dismissed the rumors in part because the Legislature approved redistricting in 2021, further solidifying Republican majorities in both chambers of the state Legislature and adding two more seats for Republicans to Washington.\nThe rumors lulled, but returned in late May during the final weeks of the biennial 140-day session of the Texas Legislature.\nRep. Gene Wu, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, said the session came to a close, and he heard Abbott might try to redistrict Texas in a special session.\n\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018What special?\u2019\u201d Wu said.\nAfter the session ended, Abbott issued an 11th-hour veto of a ban on hemp-derived THC products. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick was incensed over the torpedoing of what is one of his top legislative priorities. But it also gave Abbott a clear path to call a special 30-day legislative session.\nAbbott had made an initial list of items he told lawmakers would appear in an upcoming special session. THC was on the list. Redistricting wasn\u2019t.\nBut then the July 4 floods came. That, Wu said, was when whispers of redistricting rose to a roar.\n\u201cPeople in the know realized that Abbott would use the Kerrville disaster as cover to do redistricting,\u201d Wu said. \u201cThat\u2019s when the hairs on the back of my neck went up and I kind of said, \u2018Oh, crap.\u2019\u201d\nAbbott spokesman Andrew Mahaleris said in a statement that Democrats\u2019 flight from the state was a \u201cpublicity stunt,\u201d and that the governor has \u201cdeployed all available resources and support to help communities respond and recover.\u201d Any relief funds, Mahaleris added, would need to be appropriated by the Legislature.\n\u201cIf Texas House Democrats care about the Texans they abandoned, they will return to Austin and do the job they were elected to do,\u201d he said.\nThe maps\nOn July 7, the U.S. Department of Justice penned a letter to Abbott and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton stating that four congressional districts in Texas violated new caselaw on the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that weakened legal claims protecting \u201ccoalition districts\u201d \u2014 districts in which a combination of nonwhite communities comprises a majority.\nTwo days later, Abbott called a special session that included redistricting, citing the DOJ letter in his proclamation.\nThe session began on July 21, and legislative hearings on redistricting started rapidly.\nOver nine days, the House and Senate held nine hearings on redistricting. Most occurred before the proposed map was made available to lawmakers and the public. They included hearings in Austin, Houston and Arlington.\nAt every hearing, lawmakers heard near-universal opposition to the plan. Democrats on the committees lodged bitter complaints, at times calling the effort a racist attempt to disenfranchise people of color. Rep. Chris Turner, D-Grand Prairie, described the public hearings as a \u201cdog and pony show.\u201d\nRepublican heads of the committees disagreed with the Justice Department\u2019s conclusion that the 2021 maps violated the Voting Rights Act. But those same leaders said the disagreement was a moot point, pointing to U.S. Supreme Court rulings in 2019 and 2024 that stated political gerrymanders were legal as long as race was not taken into account.\n\u201cI frankly don\u2019t care what the DOJ letter said, and I think it\u2019s pretty clear that no one does on the prevailing side of this bill,\u201d said the chair of the House redistricting committee, Rep. Cody Vasut, R-Angelton. \u201cThis bill was not based off of that DOJ letter. It was based off of political performance.\u201d\nWhen the maps were revealed on July 30 in House Bill 4, the proposal showed redrawn districts that dismantled three urban districts \u2014 one each in North Texas, Houston and the Austin/San Antonio area \u2014 that heavily favored Democrats. Two South Texas swing districts were reconfigured to be more favorable for Republicans.\nIf 2024 election results hold true in 2026, Republicans would gain five seats \u2014 the exact number Trump had requested.\n\u201cThe trickery and the power grab became so obvious,\u201d said Rep. Barbara Gervin-Hawkins, a San Antonio Democrat on the House redistricting committee.\nThe House redistricting committee held one final round of public testimony on the maps before approving and sending them to the House floor. It was during that 15-hour hearing that House Democrats crossed a threshold \u2014 enough had agreed they would be willing to leave the state in order to block a vote.\nThe decision\nWu, who fellow House members elected as their caucus chair in 2024, said that as House Democrats weighed whether to break quorum, he stressed that they would make the decision together, not as an edict.\nTo be sure, Wu said he was in favor of breaking quorum. And in the process, Democrat representatives set up a system of \u201cwhips,\u201d representatives who regularly gauged their colleagues\u2019 feelings about breaking a quorum.\nWhen Wu counted 51 members willing to abscond from the state, the whips began making calls telling Democrats to pack their bags.\nRep. Mihaela Plesa was tending her rose and vegetable garden in North Dallas on Friday when she got the call.\n\u201cI immediately was taken back to the stories my grandparents told me about how they had to flee Romania and how they had to fight back against fascism,\u201d Plesa said.\nRep. Vince Perez was in his backyard in El Paso playing with his dogs when he got the call on Friday night.\n\u201cI was probably one of the last ones to get the call,\u201d the first-term lawmaker said. \u201cAs a new member, I\u2019m maybe at the bottom of the totem pole.\u201d\nRep. James Talarico, D-Austin, was studying the maps at his Capitol office on Saturday when he got the call.\n\u201cYou have to be OK knowing that you\u2019re going to get asked to leave with not a lot of notice,\u201d Talarico said.\nMidday Sunday, Aug. 3, Democrats from across the state were en route to Illinois, Massachusetts and New York. By the early evening, their flight became public.\nThe backlash and threats\nBy the time House Democrats were in front of cameras alongside Pritzker, who assisted them by finding lodging and meeting spaces, the backlash had already begun.\nAttorney General Ken Paxton said he would \u201chunt down\u201d absent Democrats. Abbott said he would use the courts to remove them from office if they didn\u2019t return in time for the scheduled vote on the redrawn congressional maps.\nAfter it became clear on Aug. 4 that enough Democrats had left to halt business in the House, Speaker Dustin Burrows issued civil warrants for their arrest that have empowered state law enforcement to detain and force lawmakers to return to the Capitol.\nIn Illinois, Pritzker hailed House Democrats\u2019 decision to leave the state as a \u201crighteous act of courage.\u201d\nIn the following days, leading Illinois lawmakers would join them at press conferences in an effort to draw more attention to redistricting. Other Texas Democrats did the same in Massachusetts and New York.\nDemocrats were scrambling to schedule regular news briefings on their efforts. But then on Wednesday morning, a bomb threat derailed their publicity blitz.\nThey canceled a news conference with Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin and began reevaluating their security.\nIt was a rude awakening that came after a pro-Trump media outlet exposed their location on social media. Multiple members said the bomb threat evoked the killing of Minnesota lawmaker Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark Hortman.\nRep. Donna Howard, D-Austin, had traveled to Illinois with her 4-year-old grandson. Howard is his primary caregiver.\n\u201cI would have been scared just for my own self,\u201d Howard said. \u201cTo have my grandson here made it especially traumatic, because I would obviously not want to have done anything that would have put him in danger.\u201d\nFor the next two days, they remained confined to the Q-Center \u2014 a spartan conference center in St. Charles where representatives slept on twin-sized beds in rooms that reminded some of tiny cruise ship cabins. In Austin, Abbott filed paperwork with the Texas Supreme Court to remove Wu from office. Paxton announced an investigation into how Democrats were paying for their travels.\nSen. John Cornyn contacted the FBI, calling on the federal law enforcement agency to track down House Democrats.\nThe extent of the FBI\u2019s work is unclear. The agency has declined to comment. Cornyn said agents in San Antonio and Austin were activated to assist state law enforcement.\nSome Democrats said the threats only steeled their resolve. Others called it bullying.\nGervin-Hawkins, the chair of the Texas Legislative Black Caucus, wondered whether Republicans\u2019 actions might cause permanent damage in a chamber where friendships form across party lines despite stark differences on policy.\n\u201cHow can I face colleagues who are now trying to put a target on my back for getting hurt or for getting me arrested, and say that\u2019s OK?\u201d she said.\nThe endgame\nAt a bricklayers\u2019 union hall in Elmhurst, Ill., on Friday, House Democrats held their first public appearance since the bomb threat and Cornyn\u2019s announcement that the FBI was tracking them.\nThe day before, they had secretly moved their operations from the Q-Center to an undisclosed location in the Chicago area.\nTheir press event was muted. Its location was only provided to media members who they had verified. At least two Democrats left in the middle of the event. And by its end, lawmakers and their staff outnumbered news media nearly 2-to-1.\nHouse Democrats are cognizant that even if they can stop redistricting during this special session, Abbott has the ability to call another session immediately. The governor has said as much and mused that Republicans could seek to flip even more congressional seats if Democrats continue to push back.\nTalarico, who is mulling seeking the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate in 2026, said the quorum break has delayed his decision on whether he will jump into the race. When asked about how Democrats would respond to repeated special sessions, he referenced the 2021 quorum break.\nDemocrats had fled to Washington to stop a sweeping conservative election bill. When they finally returned, some of Democrats\u2019 most reviled pieces of policy had been stripped from the bill.\n\u201cBy shining a national and international spotlight on that voter suppression bill, it pressured Texas Republicans to take the worst parts out,\u201d he said.\nRep. Vikki Goodwin, an Austin Democrat running for lieutenant governor, said that Democrats have at least slowed down redistricting.\n\u201cThe more that people become aware of the situation, the more that will have an impact in the 2026 elections,\u201d Goodwin said.\nAt the bricklayers\u2019 union hall, Goodwin watched a livestream of House Democrats\u2019 main event of the day. About 2,000 miles away in Sacramento, Calif., Gov. Gavin Newsom, alongside a handful of Texas Democrats, said his state would redistrict its seats to counteract anything done in Texas.\nNewsom was the first of several blue state governors that House Democrats have lobbied to definitively state he would pursue a partisan gerrymander in favor of Democrats. Democratic House members also visited New York Gov. Kathy Hochul.\nVice President JD Vance headed to Indiana last week to lobby for that state to pursue redistricting. Republicans in Florida have also begun an effort to redraw congressional lines.\nTexas Democrats have said redrawing districts in their state would trigger a redistricting arms race. That now appears to be underway.\nCorrection: This article has been corrected to indicate that Rep. Barbara Gervin-Hawkins is the chair of the Texas Legislative Black Caucus"

      "text": "The Latest: From Illinois, Texas House Democrats say their redistricting fight is a fight for America\nAUSTIN \u2014 Business in the Republican-dominated Texas House screeched to a halt in its third week of a special legislative session Monday when Democrats no-showed a critical vote on a GOP-driven plan to redraw congressional districts to further conservatives\u2019 agenda in Washington.\nThe Texas House sent state troopers to look for them in all corners of the state after House Speaker Dustin Burrows was unable to call a vote on House Bill 4, by Rep. Todd Hunter, R-Corpus Christi.\nA roll call shortly after 3 p.m. revealed that there were only 90 state representatives on the House floor - 10 short of the number legally required to do official business, such as vote on legislation. Those who stayed behind were allowed to leave the chamber while the House stood in recess until 1 p.m. on Tuesday.\n\u201cCome back and fulfill your duty, because this House will not sit quietly while you obstruct the work of the people,\u201d Burrows said in remarks from the House floor.\nBurrows did not reveal the number of representatives who showed up, but thanked them in remarks from the floor and blasted the \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d shown by those who left.\n\u201cLet me begin by commending the members who did show up, those who answered the call, honored their oath and came here ready to work for the people of Texas,\u201d he said. \u201cYour presence speaks volumes. You understand that there are issues before us.\u201d\nHB 4, which the Democrats are bent on killing, would shift five congressional districts in Texas from Democrat to Republican \u2013 a desire of President Donald Trump as he hopes to maintain control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections.\nDemocrats say it\u2019s illegal and marginalizes voters of color.\n\u2018We\u2019re happy to go back to the state of Texas this afternoon if the priority is flood relief,\u201d said State Rep. Rafael Anch\u00eda, D-Dallas, speaking to The Dallas Morning News near Chicago. \u201cBut what we don\u2019t want to do is participate in an illegal act of violating the Voting Rights Act.\u201d\nOn motions from Rep. Charlie Geren, R-Fort Worth, and more than a dozen other Republicans, the House voted 86-6 along partisan lines to allow Burrows to sign civil warrants for the Texas Department of Public Safety to start looking for Democrats who may still be in the state.\nFive Democrats were on the House floor at roll call and voted against sending troopers after their colleagues.\nThe DPS has the authority to compel their return to the House under threat of arrest as long as they haven\u2019t crossed state lines.\n\u201cI\u2019m here to work, and I\u2019m very disappointed in my colleagues who are not here to work. It\u2019s very simple,\u201d said Rep. John McQueeny, R-Fort Worth, who is serving his first term in office.\nOther Republicans expressed frustration as well, sending videos from the chamber floor and decrying their decision to flee.\n\u201cI do find it funny that I hear from a lot of those colleagues, \u2018We don\u2019t want to operate like D.C.,\u2019\u201d said Rep. James Frank, R-Wichita Falls. \u201cThen why don\u2019t they then stop taking orders from D.C.?\u201d\nHouse Democrats Sunday left for Illinois, gathering at a convention center to make their case against redrawing the lines when there was pressing, unrelated business that needed to be done.\nDuring a Monday appearance on CNN, John Bucy said the quorum break is intended to highlight the issue for people across the country.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a Texas Fight. This is an American fight,\u201d Bucy said. \u201cIt\u2019s starting in Texas, but if this happens, all Americans will suffer and so we must stop it. And we\u2019re asking all Americans to pay attention to what\u2019s happening, to rise up and help us resist Donald Trump right now.\u201d\nThe Democrats, some of whom are also in Boston and Albany, N.Y., are expected to stay away from the Capitol until the special legislative session called by Abbott ends on Aug. 19.\nBack home on Monday, Republican state leaders railed against the Democrats\u2019 political maneuver, which they said would only delay the inevitable passage of the legislation and kill other bills \u2013 including flood relief and property tax reform.\nGov. Greg Abbott continued his public drumbeat, bashing the Democrats for standing in the way of legislation and threatening to call for their removal from office, calling their tactic \u201can abandonment or forfeiture of an elected state office.\u201d\nBucy said Democrats weren\u2019t afraid of Abbott or Attorney General Ken Paxton, who could start removal proceedings and has threatened to have the Democrats arrested.\n\u201cWe\u2019re here running into the fight to stand up for our democracy,\u201d Bucy said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, and we\u2019ll continue to fight as long as it takes. We are here to kill this special session and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d\nAbbott called the special session to deal with a list of 18 items. The bills sitting on the table \u2013 flood relief, a ban on retail THC, and other measures \u2013 could have, in fact, passed easily had they been brought up before the redistricting map bill, which Democrats warned could blow up the session.\nRepublicans chose instead to move the controversial new maps first, in what appears to be a tactic to pressure Democrats into staying for the vote \u2013 or else take the blame for shirking the flood victims of their due relief and canning other popular measures.\nLater on Monday afternoon, about one hundred people showed up to protest outside of the Texas Governor\u2019s Mansion. U.S. Democratic Reps. Greg Casar and Lloyd Doggett, who both represent Austin, spoke at the rally.\nThe map being considered by the Legislature could force Casar and Doggett to face each other in a Democratic primary for the lone Democratic district in Central Texas.\nNeither Casar or Doggett addressed the potential primary at the protest. Instead, they applauded the Democrats who left the state in protest of the map.\nDoggett also said that the quorum break has resulted in more Americans being aware of the mid-decade redistricting effort in Texas.\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, they\u2019ve already achieved success in bringing to the attention of the American people that this is even bigger than Texas,\u201d Doggett said.\nOne of the protesters who showed up Monday was Tammy Conrad, 63, a public school teacher.\nEven if the new map ends up passing, despite the quorum break and the protests, Conrad said it\u2019s important to speak out.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t stand up every time someone tries to take our power away, we\u2019re not going to have any power left.\u201d\nPhillip Jankowski and Joseph Morton contributed to this report."

  "argos_summary": "Texas House Republicans are advancing flood relief bills following the deadly July 4 floods, but a Democratic boycott has left the chamber without the necessary quorum to vote. The Democrats are using this tactic to block a controversial redistricting proposal that could shift several congressional seats from Democratic to Republican control, which they argue violates the Voting Rights Act. The situation has escalated, with threats of arrest against absent Democrats and increased tensions as both parties prepare for potential legal battles.",
