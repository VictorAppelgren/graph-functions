      "feedback": "Strong orientation to headlines, but the piece over-extends PubMatic as a 0–3 week catalyst and understates Spirit/Biohaven immediacy while mixing near-term and longer-run events; tighten horizon, sharpen causality, and ground every assertion in the specified IDs. Recast the near-term frame as a three-way, 0–3 week map: (i) Spirit Aviation (Z5IA1CYUF) delivers the clearest immediate driver via the 40.7% single-day drop after the going-concern disclosure and Schall Law Firm’s investigation, with an invalidation path if Spirit issues new liquidity updates or a regulator/creditor covenant change; (ii) Biohaven (4VN4UTWX1) yields a Sept 12, 2025 lead-plaintiff deadline and allegations of overstated regulatory prospects for troriluzole and BHV-7000, which creates a near-term downside risk but a concrete milestone to anchor positioning; (iii) PubMatic: the Oct 20, 2025 lead-plaintiff deadline (4LDHF4T77, G4GWY9RFT) exists but lies outside the 0–3 week window, so treat it as a follow-on catalyst rather than an immediate driver, unless a court motion to certify/dismiss arrives earlier; reconcile any conflicts by explicitly labeling which catalysts are within horizon. Strengthen the causal chain by mapping each trigger to a directional move: Spirit news → risk-off/higher discounting of exposure; Biohaven filings → incremental downside risk until the Sept milestone or a settlement; Hutchmed (Y4QWID79M) provides a separate data-driven upshot, but its ASCO/Phase III cadence appears out-of-horizon for 0–3 weeks and should be framed as a medium-term driver, not a near-term punch. Quantify where possible (40.7% drop for Spirit; deadlines Sept 12 and Oct 20; no class certified yet) and state explicit invalidation points (e.g., no lead-plaintiff motion by Sept 12 for BHVN or Oct 20 for PUBM, adverse court rulings, or new disclosures). Ensure every assertion is tethered to the IDs and avoid aggregating multiple releases into a single causal claim; present a concise 0–3 week reaction function: if Spirit updates liquidity/covenants, expect near-term downside pressure; if Biohaven progresses toward lead plaintiffs, modest additional downside or volatility; if neither materializes, expect drift with a wider news din. Finally, deliver as a single tightly argued paragraph linking claims to the five source IDs (Z5IA1CYUF, 4VN4UTWX1, 4LDHF4T77, G4GWY9RFT, Y4QWID79M) and flag any potential conflicts for quick reconciliation in the write-up.",
