  "content": "The list of Mets problems is CVS-receipt long. There is four-fifths of a rotation that cannot be trusted; a correspondingly tired bullpen; problems up and down a lineup that have been expected to go away and have not gone away.\n\nThere are bigger issues than Brandon Nimmo\u2019s bat, but Brandon Nimmo\u2019s bat has not helped recently.\n\nIn a Mets lineup that has flailed, no one has had bigger issues making contact than Nimmo. In 23 games since July 12, Nimmo has struck out 34 times \u2014 his 33.3 percent rate the seventh highest in baseball in the span entering Monday \u2014 during a kind of funk that Nimmo has dealt with in the past.\n\nHe struck out 37 times in a 23-game span from May 19 to June 15 last year. A hitter who has evolved to look for more power in a way that will sacrifice some contact has proven streaky.\n\nFor six straight games, all losses, Nimmo has not recorded a hit. The outfielder is 0-for-19 with six walks and 12 punch-outs in the stretch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rough right now, but I can\u2019t say it\u2019s new,\u201d Nimmo said after Sunday\u2019s loss in Milwaukee. \u201cIt happens every year and it\u2019s part of baseball, unfortunately.\n\n\u201cI wish I could find out just what it is so that I could stay away from it every year, but I look around the league and it happens to everybody, pretty much.\u201d\n\nIt has happened to the entire Mets lineup collectively. Since June 13, a day that began with the Mets 21 games over .500 and appears to have been a turning point, the Mets entered play tied for the least runs scored in the majors.\n\nJuan Soto has hit (.901 OPS in the stretch) but not enough in the clutch (.214 with a .672 OPS with runners on base in the span). No other regular is above a .770 OPS since June 13, with the biggest struggles belonging to Mark Vientos (.572 OPS) and Francisco Lindor (.607 OPS).\n\nNimmo pointed to Lindor\u2019s slump as proof that it happens to everyone. Teams always hope it won\u2019t happen to everyone at one time.\n\n\u201cWhen you sign up to play this game, you kind of sign up for some heartbreak for some time,\u201d Nimmo said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that me being as hot as a firecracker doesn\u2019t show up in the future.\u201d",
