      "summary": "The global insurance industry faces a sharp rise in natural‑disaster losses, now averaging $152 billion annually—a 25% jump in one year—driven by more frequent severe thunderstorms, floods, and wildfires. Climate change, though a small direct contributor, acts as a multiplier, amplifying inflation and exposure growth and eroding insurability. Central banks are beginning to embed climate risk into collateral frameworks, and insurers are increasingly viewing insurability as a prerequisite for investability, prompting shifts toward resilience investments and new risk‑pricing mechanisms across markets.",
