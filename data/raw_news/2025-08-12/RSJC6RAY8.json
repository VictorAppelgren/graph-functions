  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None GAAP revenue of $3.7 million for Q2 FY2025 missed analyst estimates, down 10.0% from Q2 FY2024.\n\u2022 None Non-GAAP earnings per share were a loss of $0.09, missing consensus.\n\u2022 None Non-GAAP gross margin shrank to 31.0%, falling well below both guidance and prior-year levels.\n\u2022 These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires \u203a\n\nQuickLogic (NASDAQ:QUIK), a semiconductor company specializing in programmable logic chips and tools, reported earnings for Q2 FY2025 on August 12, 2025. The period brought disappointing financial results, with GAAP revenue dropped to $3.7 million against an expected $4.0 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share showed a loss of $0.09, wider than consensus expectations of a $0.07 non-GAAP loss. GAAP gross margin also compressed sharply, missing company forecasts. The weak results were primarily attributed to delayed recognition of a large embedded FPGA contract, which management now expects to land late in the year. Overall, the quarter continued to demonstrate technology and partnership progress but was overshadowed by meaningful financial underperformance compared to expectations, as non-GAAP EPS of -0.09 missed the analyst estimate of -0.07 and GAAP revenue of $3.7 million missed the estimate of $4.0 million.\n\nQuickLogic develops programmable semiconductor solutions known as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and embedded FPGA (eFPGA) intellectual property. FPGAs are chips that users can program even after production, making them valuable for devices needing flexibility, customization, or upgrades after deployment. The company\u2019s core business is providing these chips and IP to sectors like aerospace, defense, industrial, and consumer electronics.\n\nRecently, QuickLogic\u2019s business has emphasized advanced eFPGA IP and supporting tools, such as its Aurora PRO FPGA User Tool and Australis IP Generation software. Strong research and development investment fuels these innovations. Key success factors include driving adoption of new technologies, forming strategic partnerships with industry leaders, and reducing reliance on legacy products.\n\nKey Events and Performance During the Quarter\n\nThe most significant headline was a revenue shortfall linked to the postponed recognition of a material eFPGA IP contract. In earlier forecasts, management had anticipated this contract would contribute to the quarter, but updates now point to recognition in Q4 FY2025. This delay directly impacted the company\u2019s top line and caused it to miss its publicly stated revenue and non-GAAP EPS targets.\n\nGAAP sales declined both year-over-year and sequentially. GAAP revenue dropped 10.0% compared to Q2 FY2024, largely because of the contract delay and ongoing softness in new product shipments. New product sales made up 79% of the revenue mix, up from 73% in Q2 FY2024 but lower than the 87% in the previous quarter (Q1 FY2025). This shows some progress in shifting away from mature products, but the transition has not fully offset the impact of contract and market timing.\n\nNon-GAAP gross margin dropped to 31.0%, well below both the 58.2% non-GAAP gross margin posted in Q2 FY2024 and management\u2019s prior 50% guidance. This reflects not only the lower revenue base, but also increased cost absorption and product mix challenges. GAAP operating expenses fell to $3.5 million from $3.9 million in Q1 FY2025, but Rising cost of goods meant profitability deteriorated, as GAAP gross margin from continuing operations fell to 25.9% from 54.7% in Q2 FY2024 and 43.4% in Q1 FY2025, with the non-GAAP operating loss widened compared to both Q2 FY2024 and Q1 FY2025.\n\nIn terms of business development, the company continued to advance its eFPGA Hard IP, securing a new licensing contract for a customer\u2019s Intel 18A test chip and landing a feasibility study for a high-density IP core. It also deepened partnerships by joining the Intel Foundry Chiplet Alliance and securing a high-profile collaboration with Faraday Technology, which uses QuickLogic eFPGA IP in its FlashKit-22RRAM SoC development platform. In government contracts, QuickLogic received $1.4 million in additional funding for its Strategic Radiation Hard FPGA program in Q1 FY2025, underlining long-term opportunity but also adding to delayed revenue recognition issues.\n\nManagement expressed continued confidence in a \u201csignificant revenue rebound\u201d starting in the third quarter, pointing to delayed IP contracts and expected further milestone achievements in government programs as the main drivers. Leaders reiterated full-year goals of solid revenue growth, non-GAAP profitability, and positive cash flow. Non-GAAP gross margin is targeted in the \u201clow 60% range\u201d for FY2025, but actual achievement will depend on contract timing and mix. No additional guidance was provided for individual product or market segments.\n\nQuickLogic does not currently pay a dividend.\n\nRevenue and net income presented using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) unless otherwise noted.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 1,060%* \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 182% for the S&P 500.\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now, available when you join Stock Advisor.\n\nJesterAI is a Foolish AI, based on a variety of Large Language Models (LLMs) and proprietary Motley Fool systems.

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."
