Generate Key Takeaways\n\nCongress is considering changes to the Marine Mammal Protection Act that would reduce protections for vulnerable marine mammals.\n\nEnvironmentalists say these changes would threaten the survival of manatees and North Atlantic right whales.\n\nAs Star News Online reported, federal protections under the Marine Mammal Protection Act are at risk. This act has been helping marine mammals thrive since 1972, yet Congress may scale it back under the Trump administration.\n\n\"For more than 50 years it's worked to protect marine mammals in the U.S., and that reflects the views of the American people that these animals need that extra level of protection,\" said Dr. Andrew Read, a marine biologist at Duke University.\n\nIf Congress passes the proposed changes, the permit review process would be shortened, prioritizing economic exploitation over the welfare of marine life.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration is making environmental agency cuts, sparking concern that there won't even be enough staff to properly review permit applications before approving them.\n\nNumerous species would suffer in their natural habitats if federal protections were eliminated or reduced.\n\nOne example is the manatees that are fleeing northward from Florida as temperatures rise to uncomfortable levels and boating activity intensifies. Another example is the North Atlantic right whale, which migrates from winter breeding grounds along the southeastern U.S. shore to summer feeding areas in New England and Canada.\n\nThese whales are especially susceptible to human-induced death due to unsafe boating speeds and fishing equipment. There are approximately just 370 North Atlantic right whales left in existence today.\n\nWhat's being done to protect marine animals?\n\nThe proposed changes to the Marine Mammal Protection Act are only in discussions at this point. However, the House of Representatives plans to take a vote on the issue in the near future.\n\nIn the meantime, conservation leaders and environmental researchers are sharing what they know with Congressional members and explaining why reducing the act's protection is a bad idea.\n\nYou can play a part by supporting organizations like the Environmental Defense Fund and using your voice on issues that matter to you.\n\nOpponents of the proposed changes say that the act could stand to be updated and modernized. However, eliminating the act's primary protections is harmful for both political and environmental policy.\n\nFortunately, governments also have the power to approve positive legislative actions and improve conservation efforts rather than taking a step backward.\n\nWhen you vote for pro-climate candidates, you help move legislation in the right direction to protect biodiversity and vulnerable species that need our help.\n\nYou can also help spread public awareness about threats to marine life and other conservation topics by educating yourself about the issues and discussing what you learn with family and friends.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

      "text": "Dolphins, manatees and whales in NC waters could see federal protections weakened\nThe Marine Mammal Protection Act is hailed by environmentalists as a conservation bedrock that has helped bring several species back from the brink\nA discussion in Congress to water down a key piece of federal legislation that has allowed marine mammals, including many found along the N.C. coast, to rebound from overhunting and loss of habitat is alarming environmentalists and the nation's research community.\nThe Marine Mammal Protection Act, enacted in 1972 when outrage over unbridled abuse of the country's natural resources and rising pollution led to a wave of major environmental legislation, is credited with allowing decimated species like humpback whales and West Indian manatees to now become increasingly common visitors along the Cape Fear coast.\nBut the act has its detractors, who says its requirements are outdated and are placing unnecessary bureaucratic and permit hurdles on businesses looking to utilize the nation's maritime resources. Those voices have become louder under President Donald Trump, who is eager to see more oil and gas development.\nStill, even with its warts and somewhat dated requirements, the act has worked, its supporters note, adding that no marine mammal has gone extinct in U.S. waters since it became law.\n\"For more than 50 years it's worked to protect marine mammals in the U.S., and that reflects the views of the American people that these animals need that extra level of protection,\" said Dr. Andrew Read, a marine biologist at Duke University and director of the school's marine lab.\nWhat animals are covered under the Marine Mammal Protection Act?\nThe legislation provides extra protections for a host or mammals that live in or require water resources to survive.\nUnder the act, the National Marine Fisheries Service protects whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals, and sea lions.\nCloser to shore, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service protects walrus, manatees, otters and even polar bears.\nWhat does the act require?\nIn short, it places the management and sustainability of marine mammal populations as the prime consideration when looking to exploit marine resources for economic gain.\nThat largely means maintaining and enhancing the marine ecosystems the animals depend on. It also shifted much of the burden of protecting those species from federal and state regulators to marine users, meaning they needed to be proactive in their measures and show that their actions wouldn't adversely impact the marine population or ecosystems.\nFor example, that requires commercial fisheries or companies looking to develop offshore oil, gas or even wind farms to conduct extensive surveying and other environmental studies to show how their actions won't harm marine life in the area \u2212 a major concern when a marine mammal like the highly endangered North Atlantic right whale travel through the same waters.\nWhat changes are proposed?\nUnder draft legislation submitted by U.S. Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, changes to the act include new definitions and updating certain terms and conditions.\nBut the biggest changes would see timelines set for how long the permit review process could take and what science would be allowed to be used to make management decisions.\nIndustry supporters and many Republicans claim the changes would reduce uncertainty and streamline the permitting processes, allowing projects to move forward faster and allowing a better balance between environmental and economic needs.\nBut environmental advocates say the moves would place speed and economic exploitation of the ocean ahead of what's best for the marine environment. They also note that the shortened review process window comes just as the Trump administration is making major cuts to the federal environmental bureaucracy, almost guaranteeing that many permits will simply not get a proper review before they are issued.\n\"It's kind of a perfect storm,\" Read said.\nManatees and North Atlantic right whales\nTwo marine mammals found in N.C. waters that could face challenges if the act is watered down are manatees and the North Atlantic right whale.\nDr. Michael Tift, director of the UNCW Marine Mammal Stranding Program, said the arrival of more manatees in the Tar Heel State as they increasingly flee Florida for a variety of reasons, including climate change, comes just as it's peak boating season here, and manatees and boats often don't mix well.\n\"There's really no place they have for refuge,\" he said, noting that a weakened marine mammal act could be one more threat the sea cows, which are still recovering from earlier environmental challenges, face.\nThe situation could be even more dire for the North Atlantic right whale, which migrates through N.C. waters as they move from their winter breeding grounds off the Southeastern U.S. to their summer feeding areas off New England and the Canadian Maritimes.\nWith only about 370 animals left, and an estimated 70 breeding females, the survivial of every animals for the species is critical. But the whales are very susceptible to ship strikes and fishing gear entanglements, partly because they swim close to shore.\n\u201cThere is no lack of evidence that the primary cause of death for North Atlantic right whales is human-induced, and yet legislation fails over and over again to mitigate those impacts,\u201d Tift said, noting that federal bills to extend vessel speed limits and adopt new rules for fishing gear have repeatedly failed in Washington.\nWhat happens now?\nWhile the proposed changes to the act are just in the discussion phase right now, it's expected to make it to the House floor for a vote in one form or another in the near future.\nBut even if it does pass the GOP-dominated House, opponents of the changes are more confident that it will be harder to wrangle 60 votes in the Senate to get the bill passed.\nStill, that it's even been brought up shows what the administration wants to do with marine mammal protections, said Kathleen Collins, senior marine campaign manager with the International Fund for Animal Welfare.\nAnd with three years of the current administration still to go, activists and researchers plan to keep explaining to members of Congress why weakening the marine act is bad environmental and political policy.\n\u201cEveryone agrees that parts of the Marine Mammal Protection Act that can be modernized, some things can be improved and fixed,\" Duke's Read said. \"But gutting the main parts of the act are not what the research community and I think the American public want to see.\"\nReporter Gareth McGrath can be reached at GMcGrath@Gannett.com or @GarethMcGrathSN on X/Twitter.
