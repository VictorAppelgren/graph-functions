  "description": "Kelly Clarkson\u2019s ex-husband passed away on Thursday, August 7, at age 48.",
  "content": "Brandon Blackstock learned he had cancer following his divorce from Kelly Clarkson.\n\nThe late talent manager, who died on Aug. 7 at age 48, \u201cwas diagnosed after the divorce,\u201d a source told People.\n\nBlackstock and Clarkson, 43, married in 2013 and shared two children: daughter River, 11, and son Remington, 9. He was also father to two other children, Savannah and Seth Blackstock, from his first marriage to Melissa Ashworth.\n\nSeven years into his and Clarkson\u2019s marriage, the \u201cSince U Been Gone\u201d singer filed for divorce in 2020, citing irreconcilable differences. Their divorce was finalized in 2022, with Clarkson granted primary custody of the children.\n\nIn a statement obtained by The Post, Blackstock\u2019s family announced his passing following a yearslong private battle with cancer.\n\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away,\u201d the statement read. \u201cBrandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years.\n\n\u201cHe passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family. We thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family\u2019s privacy during this very difficult time,\u201d they concluded.\n\nSources told TMZ that Blackstock had been battling melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer, and passed away Thursday morning.\n\nThe day before Blackstock\u2019s tragic death, Clarkson postponed the remaining August shows of her Las Vegas residency.\n\nShe explained that Blackstock was experiencing health issues and she needed to focus on caring for their children.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I need to postpone the remainder of the August Studio Session dates in Las Vegas,\u201d the \u201cStronger\u201d hitmaker wrote on her Instagram on Aug. 6.\n\n\u201cWhile I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children\u2019s father has been ill, and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them,\u201d she revealed.\n\nClarkson concluded, \u201cI am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows, and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of Blackstock\u2019s passing, another source told People that Clarkson had \u201cbeen devastated\u201d for their children ever since her ex-husband received his diagnosis.\n\n\u201cWhen she found out that he was sick, she remained protective of him for their sake,\u201d the insider told the outlet. \u201cKelly has always tried to keep things classy. It became clear earlier this year that Brandon was not doing well. She\u2019s been devastated for the kids.\u201d\n\nThough the ex-couple\u2019s divorce was filled with drama, the source emphasized that the \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d winner stayed focused on maintaining Blackstock\u2019s relationship with their children.\n\nDescribing the split and ensuing legal battle as \u201cmessy, painful and something [Clarkson] felt terrible about,\u201d the source added, \u201cThe divorce was incredibly difficult for her\u2026 But she always wanted her kids to have the best relationship possible with their dad. She never spoke poorly about Brandon to the kids.\u201d\n\nSources would go on to confirm to Page Six that Blackstock had been secretly battling cancer, and that Clarkson had been juggling work while caring for her ex behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been exhausting and so sad,\u201d the source said. \u201cKelly has been working so hard, as well as looking after Brandon. Despite their difficult divorce, he\u2019s still the man she loved and still her kids\u2019 father.\u201d",

Blackstock was fighting melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer. We're told Brandon passed away this morning, just a few hours ago, after battling the disease for three and a half years.\nIt was clear Blackstock was dealing with a major health issue ... because Clarkson announced she was postponing her Las Vegas residency because of her ex-husband's health issues -- explaining she needed to be with her children. People broke the news of his death.\nAs you know ... rumors have persisted over the last few months that she was going to leave \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\" because of her numerous absences -- though we've now confirmed these were all connected to Blackstock's illness.\nEveryone on the staff knew about the illness, we're told ... but, they kept it to themselves out of respect for Kelly and Brandon's privacy.\nBlackstock and Clarkson met at a rehearsal for the Academy of Country Music Awards back in 2006 ... though they didn't start dating until early 2012 after reconnecting at Super Bowl XLVI. They got engaged later that year and married in 2013.\nDuring their marriage, they welcomed two children together ... and, Clarkson said Blackstock even convinced her to get into hosting her own talk show.

I know it.'\u201d\nAnd she was right.\nThe pair got engaged in December 2012, with Clarkson sharing the happy news on Twitter.\n\u201cI\u2019M ENGAGED!!!!!\u201d the talk show host gushed. \u201cI wanted y\u2019all to know!!

I am so lucky and am with the greatest man ever.\u201d\nBlackstock popped the question at their Nashville house.\nClarkson recalled to People about the proposal: \u201cOut of nowhere I just said, \u2018Thanks for being an awesome guy.\u2019 I\u2019ve never been loved properly by a man, and I was just like, \u2018I thank you so much for that.'\u201d\nBlackstock then got down on one knee.\n\u201cNot a damn clue!\u201d she continued to the outlet. \u201cIf I did, I would have worn something besides Uggs and a sweatshirt with no bra.\u201d\nOctober 2013: Clarkson and Blackstock get married\nClarkson and Blackstock tied the knot on Oct. 20, 2013.\nAt the time, the musician tweeted, \u201cI\u2019m officially Mrs. Blackstock :) We got married yesterday at Blackberry Farms in TN, the most beautiful place ever!\u201d\n\u201cI was so emotional, and I didn\u2019t realize I was going to be!\u201d Clarkson dished to People in 2020.\n\u201cDuring the ceremony, Seth looked up and was like, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with her?\u2019\u201d she recounted. \u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m just so happy!\u2019\u201d\nClarkson also touched on becoming a blended family with Blackstock\u2019s kids.\n\u201cMy best friend always say, \u2018You just want to create the family you never had.\u2019 I might be doing that,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cIn defense of my family, it happens. People fall out of love, and people go separate ways. People are human. I\u2019ve accomplished a lot, but I guess the biggest success I want is that whenever I die people will say, \u2018She was so successful as a mother and as a wife.\u2019 That\u2019s kind of a big goal.\u201d\nJune 2014: River Rose Blackstock is born\nClarkson and Blackstock welcomed their first child together, daughter River Rose, months after tying the knot.\n\u201cOur baby girl River Rose Blackstock arrived on June 12th!\u201d the new mom posted on X at the time. \u201cThank you everyone for all of your well wishes! Brandon and I are on cloud 9!!\u201d\nIn 2023, Clarkson had her daughter join her onstage at the Bakkt Theater at the Planet Hollywood Las Vegas Resort & Casino to perform a duet of \u201cHeartbeat Song.\u201d\nHer son also came on stage to showcase his dance moves.\n\u201cBoth of my kiddos backstage getting ready to join me on stage in Vegas,\u201d Clarkson gushed on Instagram the next day. \u201cNothing will ever be as cool and amazing as these two little humans that will always have my whole heart.\u201d\nApril 2016: Remington Alexander Blackstock is born\nClarkson announced she was pregnant with her second child in a very public way.\nDuring a performance in Los Angeles, she became emotional while introducing her song \u201cPiece by Piece.\u201d\n\u201cI was not planning on announcing this, but \u2026 I\u2019m totally pregnant. I\u2019m having a really hard time,\u201d she told the audience.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna nail the s \u2013 \u2013 t out of this song. That was not how I wanted to announce that \u2026 I hate this song right now,\u201d Clarkson teased. \u201cMy makeup artist is backstage hating me right now. I just don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m on pills or drunk.\u201d\nAfter finishing the song, she told the concertgoers, \u201cI\u2019d like to apologize to my husband. That was not planned. I just didn\u2019t want you to think I was crazy or something. Honestly, I\u2019m just so hormonal today\u2026 I haven\u2019t vomited yet. That is a freakin\u2019 win, y\u2019all.\u201d\nOn April 12, 2016, Clarkson and Blackstock welcomed their son, Remy.\nAt one point, Clarkson\u2019s son suffered from hearing issues and delayed speech. The hearing issue set Remy back \u201calmost nine months\u201d in communicating.\n\u201cThe big milestone for us is Remy getting to really find out his own personality and his identity, because it\u2019s been frustrating for him to not be able to really vocalize his emotion,\u201d Clarkson told People in 2020. \u201cThe fact that he\u2019s making full sentences now and full-on engaging with us is really a blessing.\u201d\nJune 2020: Clarkson files for divorce\nAfter almost seven years of marriage, Clarkson filed for divorce on June 4, 2020, citing irreconcilable differences.\nNovember 2020: Clarkson wins temporary primary custody\nIn November 2020, Clarkson was awarded temporary primary physical custody of River and Remy.\nAccording to court documents, \u201cthe level of conflict between the parents [had] increased\u201d and that they had \u201ca difficult time co-parenting due to issues of trust between them.\u201d\nThe documents also stated that Clarkson and Blackstock agreed that they \u201cshall not speak in a derogatory manner about the other parent to the minor children. The custodial parent shall not allow the minor children to be in the presence of any third party who speaks about the other parent in a derogatory manner.\u201d\nOne month after the court\u2019s decision, Clarkson alleged that Blackstock acted fraudulently as her manager. He denied defrauding his estranged wife out of millions.\nAt the time, Clarkson also told Entertainment Tonight that the \u201cthing that\u2019s been kind of hard to navigate is I am an open book, but at some point I\u2019m a mama bear more than I am a person in the public eye.\u201d\n\u201cSo I care 100% more about my children than I do anything else on this planet.\u201d\nMarch 2022: Clarkson and Blackstock\u2019s divorce is finalized\nIn March 2022, a judge approved the exes\u2019 divorce settlement, granting Blackstock $115,000 each month in spousal support until January 2024.

It was the best decision for her though. They thrive as a family.\u201d\nBlackstock, meanwhile, resided in Butte, Mont., after moving out of the family\u2019s original Montana ranch.\nJanuary 2024: Clarkson opens up about the split\nClarkson told People at the time she poured a lot of her emotions from her divorce into her album, \u201cChemistry.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see it other than: This is my outlet,\u201d she told the publication. \u201cI\u2019m a let-go person; I don\u2019t hold grudges. So it was really delving into what happened in my life and why \u2014 and what am I going to do about it?\u201d\nClarkson said releasing the album \u201c[was] like, \u2018I\u2019m taking my power back.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI cannot express how appreciative I feel for having that kind of healthy outlet. Because the level of depression and things that come with divorce or grieving is extraordinarily hard,\u201d she added. \u201cYou feel alone, and it\u2019s just a blessing to be able to have that outlet for those emotions that are overwhelming.\u201d\nAugust 2025: Blackstock dies of cancer\nOn Aug. 7, 2025, it was announced that Blackstock died at age 48 after a private cancer battle, with sources telling TMZ he had melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer.\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years,\u201d his family said in a statement obtained by The Post read.\n\u201cHe passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family. We thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family\u2019s privacy during this very difficult time,\u201d they concluded.\nBlackstock\u2019s passing comes just hours after Clarkson abruptly postponed the remaining August shows of her Las Vegas residency, Studio Sessions.\nShe previously canceled opening weekend in July."

He also managed her former \u201cVoice\u201d co-star Blake Shelton\u2019s career until his divorce from the star.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have hired Brandon to be my manager if I didn\u2019t see first-hand how great he is at that and how much he cares about Blake,\u201d Clarkson told Marie Claire in 2018. \u201cAnd the way that [Blake\u2019s] career has blown up, I would have hired Brandon regardless. He\u2019s really talented at what he does and his mind really does work in a completely different way.\u201d\nThe \u201cBecause of You\u201d singer, who had primary custody of their two children, has opened up about the emotional toll she faced after their split.\n\u201cI think the thing about divorce \u2014 especially having it publicized, and people thinking they know the whole thing \u2014 the hardest part of that is, like, it wasn\u2019t an overnight decision,\u201d she revealed in 2023, a year after the divorce was finalized. \u201cI wanted to make [our marriage] beautiful. I wanted to make it awesome. I wanted to make it everything it possibly could be, and sometimes that just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\nClarkson also got brutally honest, telling Apple Music that same year, \u201cI did not handle [the divorce] well.\u201d\nBlackstock became a grandfather in 2022 when Savannah welcomed her son.

He blamed his mental capacity, claiming he was not in his right mind and under the influence of pain medication after undoing a recent surgery when he made the decision to sell.\nDespite his arguments, the judge ruled that Perry was the rightful owner of the Santa Barbara, Calif., mansion in December 2023. \u201cWestcott presented no persuasive evidence that he lacked capacity to enter into a real estate contract between June 10, 2020, and June 18, 2020, the days during which he negotiated and signed the contract,\u201d the judge said at the time.\nThe judge also stated the court found significant evidence to demonstrate the entrepreneur knowingly signed on the contract\u2019s dotted line, ruling he seemed to be \u201ccoherent, engaged, lucid, and rational.\u201d\nThe deed was later transferred to the singer\u2019s LLC, DDoveB (a tribute to the daughter she shares with Bloom, Daisy Dove, 4), in May 2024.\nHowever, their battle isn\u2019t over.\nThe \u201cCalifornia Gurls\u201d singer countersued Carl, claiming the veteran owes her $3.25 million in damages because she was unable to rent out the mansion during their legal fight from September 2020 to March 2024.\nPerry\u2019s legal team later added an additional $2.29 million in repair damages, claiming it needed to be restored to the condition it was purchased in.\nPhase two of the mansion war is scheduled for Aug. 21.\nChart Westcott, Carl\u2019s son, spoke exclusively to The Post after the judge ruled on Aug. 1 that Perry\u2019s ex, Orlando Bloom, would not have to testify in the trial.\nCarl\u2019s lawyers wanted to depose the actor to grill him about the alleged repairs and ask if he ever lived in the home with his now ex-fianc\u00e9e.\nWhen asked if it was an injustice that Bloom won\u2019t have to take the stand, Chart responded, \u201cIt absolutely is,\u201d alleging the actor \u201ctold our property manager he was \u2018in charge of repairs\u2019 and in addition to that, he is on the LLC that owns the house as a manager.\u201d\n\u201cHe should have to testify. It isn\u2019t, you know, about us trying to drag him into it. He\u2019s already in it. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\nThe Post verified that Orlando is also listed on the LLC.\nChart said his understanding of the ruling is that \u201cthe door is not completely closed,\u201d with the Westcott family\u2019s reps sharing that their lawyers plan to fight with a potential new motion regarding Orlando\u2019s testimony.\nUpon hearing the ruling, Chart shared, \u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised and I understand the judge\u2019s desire to avoid a media circus but the reality is that everything these two people do, Katy and Orlando, is in the media and also like just because they have media attention doesn\u2019t excuse them from the obligations that the court can put them under and it shouldn\u2019t. That\u2019s a two-tier celebrity privilege standard, and that\u2019s not OK.\u201d\nPerry\u2019s team insisted the pop star was owed $2.2 million for the alleged repairs that were needed to restore the house to its purchased condition, citing structural defects and deferred maintenance.\nThey claimed experts examined the estate sometime last year and determined \u201cthat significant portions needed to be repaired, including nearly a million dollars in pervasive flood damage that occurred in early 2024 and substantial repairs that are needed due to a large tree falling on and cracking the foundation of one of the buildings on the Property, among many other defects throughout the Property.\u201d\nPerry attorneys also argued that \u201cGudvi bargained for the condition of the Property in July 2020, and the $15 million purchase price was based on the Property as it existed at that time. Westcott should not be able to profit from his own deficient construction and lack of maintenance while this litigation was pending.\u201d\nChart and his family, however, won\u2019t go down without a fight.\n\u201cKaty could\u2019ve walked away at any time with grace and humanity. Instead, she has chosen to fight a dying man in court, all for money. OK, that\u2019s who we\u2019re dealing with here. He is bedridden. He has late-stage dementia and Huntington\u2019s. His ability to speak kind of ebbs and flows. Some days are better than others,\u201d Chart said of his father\u2019s ailing health.\n\u201cHe\u2019s stable, but it\u2019s declined. I mean, we have thought he could die any day for several years now because of how much he\u2019s just withering away,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no argument to justify what\u2019s happening here from a moral perspective like this is the exploitation of a man whose mind and body are basically shutting down, and he\u2019s being dragged into court.\u201d\nChart said his dad is \u201cliterally bedridden and can barely speak,\u201d adding, \u201cthat\u2019s been the status for over a year.\u201d\nCarl\u2019s son slammed the \u201cFirework\u201d singer, noting, \u201cHe\u2019s spending his days in a hospital bed and Katy Perry is spending her days trying to get his money.\u201d\nTo Chart, he feels Perry\u2019s public image is the opposite of what he\u2019s seen during the nearly five-year legal fight.\n\u201cHere\u2019s what makes me so mad, though. Her public image, she tries to couch it as, you know, empathy and compassion, and all these you know bulls\u2013t words that are not who she is,\u201d he quipped.\n\u201cI mean, her fake compassion, her fake empathy. It\u2019s all bulls\u2013t. You know, she\u2019s a greedy bitch.\u201d\nChart, who will be testifying at the trial, revealed his ideal outcome would be \u201cfor the judge to tell her she gets no damages, to pound sand, and she never should\u2019ve done this in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cI just can\u2019t believe she hasn\u2019t even apologized. She hasn\u2019t even said, \u2018Sorry, we\u2019re putting you through this,'\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\nChart added: \u201cAvoiding accountability for her immoral and wrong choices is basically a hallmark of her. She\u2019s essentially a giant spoiled brat, you know, I mean it, like to boil it down.\n\u201cShe\u2019s never had to grow up, and so she doesn\u2019t realize, I\u2019m not giving her, I\u2019m not excusing her, but like I don\u2019t think she fully understands the moral consequences of her actions, like she\u2019s not fully developed from a moral perspective.\u201d\nWestcott\u2019s attorneys previously shot down Perry\u2019s claims that the property was damaged between 2020 and 2024. They claimed Perry had to deposit $9 million of the $15 million sale price into an escrow account, which left \u201c$6 million of the price she owes up to the decision of the court after the second phase of the trial,\u201d reported Us Weekly.\n\u201cPerry\u2019s game is clear. During years of litigation, she asserted $3.25 million in loss of use damages. But immediately after the [decision], providing that she would pay $9 million of the $15 million price \u2026 was approved by the Court, she is trying to add $2.29 million in \u2018new damages\u2019 which brings her total damages claim up to $5.4 million, an amount close to the $6 million she still owes,\u201d their filing reportedly read.\nFor Chart and his family, it\u2019s not about the money.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need the money,\u201d he insisted, claiming Perry\u2019s \u201ctaking from\u201d the things Carl wanted to give his fortune to. \u201cNot an insubstantial portion of his money is going to charity, and instead it\u2019s going to her. That\u2019s bulls\u2013t,\u201d he said.\nThe Post reached out to Perry and Bloom\u2019s lawyers and PR teams for comment.\nThe \u201cLast Friday Night\u201d singer\u2019s ex hasn\u2019t been the only celebrity dragged into the ongoing legal case.\nPerry is set to be grilled about allegedly renting the eight-bedroom mansion to Chris Pratt and his wife, Katherine Schwarzenegger, after a June report claimed the couple had recently moved into the 9,285-square-foot estate, according to court documents obtained by Us Weekly."
