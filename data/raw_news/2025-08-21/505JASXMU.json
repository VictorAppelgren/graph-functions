  "description": "Marzetti shares slipped as Q4 sales beat estimates but higher SG&A and restructuring costs weighed on operating income.",
  "content": "The Marzetti Company MZTI shares are trading lower on Thursday after the company reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.34, in line with the analyst consensus estimate.\n\nQuarterly sales of $475.427 million (+5% year over year) outpaced the Street view of $457.054 million.\n\nAlso Read: Walmart CEO Says Tariff Costs Expected To Rise, Lower And Middle Income Consumers Hit Most\n\n\u201cIn the Retail segment, sales growth of 3.1% was led by expanding distribution for our popular Texas RoadhouseTM dinner rolls and new club channel sales for Chick-fil-A sauce,\u201d CEO David A. Ciesinski commented.\n\n\u201cOur category-leading New York BakeryTM frozen garlic bread also achieved strong volume gains in the quarter, including contributions from our recently introduced gluten-free Texas Toast,\u201d Ciesinski added.\n\nConsolidated gross profit rose $8.5 million to a fourth-quarter record of $106.1 million, with gross margin expanding 70 basis points to 22.3%, driven by ongoing cost-savings initiatives and a more favorable Retail segment volume/mix.\n\nConsolidated operating income decreased $2.8 million to $38.9 million, primarily reflecting higher SG&A expenses and a $2.4 million rise in restructuring and impairment charges. These impacts were partially offset by improved gross profit.\n\nThe company exited the quarter with cash and equivalents worth $161.476 million.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead to fiscal 2026, we anticipate Retail segment sales will continue to benefit from volume growth, with contributions from both our licensing program and our Marzetti, New York Bakery, and Sister Schubert\u2019s brands,\u201d Ciesinski stated.\n\nThe company noted that Foodservice sales are expected to be supported by specific quick-service restaurant customers, though U.S. economic conditions and consumer behavior could influence overall demand.\n\nIt added that modest input cost inflation is anticipated in fiscal 2026, which it plans to offset through contractual pricing and cost-savings initiatives, with a continued focus on margin improvement.\n\n\n\nPrice Action: MZTI shares were trading 0.91% lower at $176.70 as of the last check on Thursday.\n\u2022 Top 2 Financial Stocks You May Want To Dump In Q3",

  "summary": "The Marzetti Company (NASDAQ:MZTI) has reported a 5% increase in Q4 sales to $475.427 million, beating the Street view of $457.054 million. This growth was driven by 3.1% growth in the Retail segment, led by expanding distribution for Texas Roadhouse and new club channel sales for Chick-fil-A sauce. The company's consolidated gross profit rose $8.5 million to a fourth-quarter record of $106.1 million, with a gross margin expanding 70 basis points to 22.3%, driven by ongoing cost-savings initiatives and favorable Retail segment volume/mix. However, consolidated operating income decreased by $2.8 million to $38.9 million due to higher SG&A expenses and a rise in restructuring and impairment charges.",

      "text": "The Marzetti Company MZTI reported results today for the company's fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended June 30, 2025. Note that effective June 27, 2025, The Marzetti Company is the new name of the former Lancaster Colony Corporation.\nFourth Quarter Summary\n- Consolidated fourth quarter net sales increased 5.0% to a fourth quarter record $475.4 million. Excluding $12.2 million in non-core sales attributed to a temporary supply agreement (\"TSA\") with Winland Foods, Inc., consolidated net sales increased 2.3%. Retail segment net sales increased 3.1% to $241.6 million. Foodservice segment net sales grew 7.0% to $233.9 million on a reported basis. Excluding the non-core TSA sales, Foodservice segment net sales increased 1.4%.\n- Consolidated gross profit increased $8.5 million to a fourth quarter record $106.1 million. Gross profit margin improved 70 basis points to 22.3% driven by our ongoing cost savings programs and the benefit of a more favorable volume/mix for the Retail segment.\n- SG&A expenses increased $8.9 million to $62.1 million, driven by higher marketing costs as we increased investments to support the growth of our retail brands.\n- Consolidated operating income declined $2.8 million to $38.9 million. In addition to the net impact of the higher gross profit and increased SG&A expenses, consolidated operating income includes restructuring and impairment charges of $5.1 million in the current-year period versus $2.7 million last year. The current-year restructuring and impairment charges primarily relate to our previously announced plans to close our sauce and dressing facility in Milpitas, California.\n- Fourth quarter net income was $1.18 per diluted share versus $1.26 per diluted share last year. Restructuring and impairment charges reduced this year's fourth quarter net income by $0.15 per diluted share compared to $0.08 last year.\nCEO David A. Ciesinski commented, \"We were pleased to report record sales and gross profit for our fiscal fourth quarter. In the Retail segment, sales growth of 3.1% was led by expanding distribution for our popular Texas RoadhouseTM dinner rolls and new club channel sales for Chick-fil-A\u00ae sauce. Our category-leading New York BakeryTM frozen garlic bread also achieved strong volume gains in the quarter, including contributions from our recently introduced gluten-free Texas Toast. In the Foodservice segment, excluding non-core TSA sales, net sales increased 1.4% driven by inflationary pricing, increased demand from some of our national chain restaurant account customers and sales gains for our branded Foodservice products.\"\nFourth Quarter Results\nConsolidated net sales increased 5.0% to a fourth quarter record $475.4 million versus $452.8 million last year. Retail segment net sales grew 3.1% to $241.6 million while the segment's sales volume, measured in pounds shipped, increased 2.1%. Excluding sales attributed to perimeter-of-the-store bakery product lines that we exited in fiscal 2024, specifically our Flatout\u00ae and Angelic Bakehouse\u00ae brands, Retail net sales increased 3.6% and Retail sales volume increased 2.9%. In the Foodservice segment, net sales advanced 7.0% to $233.9 million. Foodservice segment sales include $12.2 million in non-core sales attributed to a TSA with Winland Foods, Inc. that commenced in March 2025 for a period of up to twelve months. The TSA was made in connection with our acquisition of the Winland Foods sauce and dressing production facility located in Atlanta, Georgia. The acquisition was completed in February 2025. Excluding the non-core TSA sales, Foodservice segment net sales improved 1.4% including the benefit of inflationary pricing as the segment's sales volumes, measured in pounds shipped, declined 1.7%.\nConsolidated gross profit increased $8.5 million to a fourth quarter record $106.1 million driven by our cost savings programs and the benefit of a more favorable volume/mix for the Retail segment. Gross profit margin increased 70 basis points to 22.3%.\nSG&A expenses increased $8.9 million to $62.1 million, driven by higher marketing costs as we invested to support the growth of our retail brands. SG&A expenses also reflect increased investments in personnel along with $0.5 million in incremental costs attributed to the sauce and dressing plant acquisition.\nRestructuring and impairment charges of $5.1 million in the current-year quarter include $4.5 million in charges attributed to the planned closure of our sauce and dressing facility in Milpitas, California as part of our ongoing initiative to better optimize our manufacturing network. The $4.5 million consists of impairment charges for personal property and operating lease right-of-use assets; one-time termination benefits; and other costs associated with the pending closure. Production at the facility is expected to conclude during the quarter ending September 30, 2025. In the prior-year quarter, restructuring and impairment charges of $2.7 million were attributed to our decision to exit our perimeter-of-the-store bakery product lines.\nConsolidated operating income declined $2.8 million to $38.9 million as impacted by the higher SG&A expenses and the $2.4 million increase in restructuring and impairment charges, partially offset by the higher gross profit.\nNet income decreased $2.3 million to $32.5 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, versus $34.8 million, or $1.26 per diluted share, last year. In the current-year quarter, the restructuring and impairment charges reduced net income by $4.0 million, or $0.15 per diluted share. Incremental SG&A expenditures attributed to the sauce and dressing plant acquisition reduced net income by $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. In the prior-year quarter, restructuring and impairment charges reduced net income by $2.1 million, or $0.08 per diluted share.\nFiscal Year Results\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, net sales increased 2.0% to $1.91 billion compared to $1.87 billion a year ago. Net income for the fiscal year totaled $167.3 million, or $6.07 per diluted share, versus the prior-year amount of $158.6 million, or $5.76 per diluted share. The fiscal 2025 results include a noncash settlement charge attributed to the termination of the company's legacy pension plans that reduced net income by $10.8 million, or $0.39 per diluted share. In addition, the fiscal 2025 results account for restructuring and impairment charges that reduced net income by $4.0 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, and incremental SG&A expenditures attributed to our acquisition of the Atlanta-based sauce and dressing production facility that reduced net income by $2.9 million, or $0.11 per diluted share. In fiscal 2024, restructuring and impairment charges reduced net income by $11.4 million, or $0.42 per diluted share.\nFiscal 2026 Outlook\nMr. Ciesinski commented, \"Looking ahead to fiscal 2026, we anticipate Retail segment sales will continue to benefit from volume growth, with contributions from both our licensing program and our Marzetti\u00ae, New York BakeryTM, and Sister Schubert's\u00ae brands. In the Foodservice segment, we expect sales to be supported by select quick-service restaurant customers in our mix of national chain restaurant accounts, while external factors, including U.S. economic performance and consumer behavior, may impact demand. With respect to our input costs, in aggregate we anticipate a modest level of inflation in fiscal 2026 that we plan to offset through contractual pricing and our cost savings programs as we remain focused on continued margin improvement in the year ahead.\"\nConference Call on the Web\nThe company's fourth quarter and fiscal year-end conference call is scheduled for this morning, August 21, at 10:00 a.m. ET. Access to a live webcast and subsequent replay of the call is available through a link on the company's website at investors.marzetticompany.com.\nAbout the Company\nThe Marzetti Company is a manufacturer and marketer of specialty food products for the retail and foodservice channels.\nForward-Looking Statements\nWe desire to take advantage of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \"PSLRA\").

The GAAP operating income fell 8.2% year-over-year to $7.29 billion.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin slipped 10 basis points to 6.5%.

The company expects constant currency sales between $175.95 billion and $177.64 billion, compared to the $176.33 billion estimate.\nHowever, the retailer cautioned that there would be approximately a 140-bps headwind from the VIZIO acquisition.\nConference Call\nWalmart's CEO reportedly said the company is seeing its costs increase week after week as it replenishes inventory at post-tariff price levels.\nHe added that tariff-related costs are expected to rise further into the third and fourth quarters.\nHe also noted that middle and lower income customers are making more adjustments than higher-income shoppers in discretionary categories where prices have climbed.\nDuring the conference call, Walmart's CFO reportedly said the company is closely monitoring customer demand and adjusting purchasing quantities as it gauges the price elasticity of tariff-impacted items.\nWatch the live coverage of the Walmart conference call here\nPrice Action: WMT shares are trading lower by 3.16% to $99.33 premarket at last check Thursday.\nRead This Next:\nPhoto via Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
