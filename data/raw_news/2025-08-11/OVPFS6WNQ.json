  "description": "A new, tree-like assembly line will be built to improve build times.",
  "content": "Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nFord tore up the moving assembly line concept and designed a better one, the company's CEO Jim Farley explained to a crowd gathered at Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky for Ford's announcement that a new, lower-cost electric truck is coming to market in 2027.\n\n\"One of the first things we did was bring in manufacturing expertise directly from our teams in Dearborn. That was incredibly important [it] set the baseline of what the architecture of the products would be off the platform. [It is a] marriage of both worlds, in terms of the expertise of 122-year-old company with massive capabilities and supply chain and industrialization in general,\" Alan Clarke, Ford's executive director of advanced EV development, told Newsweek.\n\n\"[It] was really important to not only engage early, but also ensure that the ideas were able to fail fast. That's a startup mentality. When you're moving quickly, you want to really quickly determine: Is this actually more efficient? Does it actually save us money? Do we still deliver what we need to the customer in order to effectively make the product?\" he said.\n\nThe formula for the new assembly line structure, the Ford Universal EV Production System, starts with the new Ford Universal EV Platform. That platform underpins future battery-electric vehicles and is the result of a California-based skunkworks operation that was designed and enabled to break Ford's timeline, agility and product development norms.\n\nInstead of a traditional snaking assembly line structure, Ford's Louisville plant, which expanded 52,000 square feet as part of the effort, will feature an \"assembly tree.\" That tree will include three sub-assemblies that run down their own separate assembly lines in unison, then join together at the end.\n\n\"There's been a lot of work in the last three years on AI, on plants, and we're doing that and putting that into the system too. You've seen some of that already, but then we've also taken to this new platform, what we're able to do and add to that. So again, it's a win, win on both sides,\" a Ford spokesperson said.\n\nAs part of the vehicle building shift, single-piece aluminum unicastings will replace dozens of smaller parts. This will allow the front and rear of the vehicle to be assembled separately. Additionally, less parts means fewer opportunities for failures that result in recalls, a business element that Ford has continuously struggled with during Farley's tenure, costing the company billions.\n\n\"Elegant, simple designs are ultimately what enable low-cost: deletion of parts, deletion of process.... There's a lot of innovation of powertrain, in how we put the whole product together,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nUnder the new assembly plan, Ford's assembly line workers on the third branch of the line put together the battery, seats, consoles and carpeting.\n\nParts travel down the assembly tree to operators, further simplifying operations, in kit form with all fasteners, scanners and power tools included, in the order in which they are intended to be used.\n\nThe team has further optimized the assembly line and order of operations for building the vehicle to improve the ergonomics for employees, reducing twisting, reaching and bending.\n\nFord estimates that this new way of assembling vehicles will be 40 percent faster than the current assembly time of the Ford Escape. Some of that time, Ford says, will be yielded back to the company for other tasks, with an ultimate net speed improvement of 15 percent. It takes 20 hours to build one Ford Escape today.",

Inconsistencies may occur.\nFord has recalled more than 850,000 vehicles across the United States due to a possible defect in the low-pressure fuel pump that could cause engines to stall while driving.\nThe recall, which impacts a wide range of Ford and Lincoln-branded models produced in recent years, was announced by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on July 8.\nOwners affected by the recall will begin receiving notifications by mail from Monday, July 14, but an official fix has not yet been disclosed by the carmaker.\nNewsweek contacted Ford for comment by email outside of regular working hours on Friday.\nWhy It Matters\nEngine stalling while a vehicle is driving can increase the risk of collisions, especially at high speeds or in dense traffic.\nAlthough Ford has not reported any known accidents or injuries linked to the issue, drivers are being urged to remain vigilant for potential warning signs, including poor engine performance, reduced power or an illuminated check engine light.\nWhat To Know\nFord indicated that failure of the low-pressure fuel pump could lead to an engine stalling while at rest or driving.\nThe NHTSA said that fuel pump failure is more likely to occur \"in low fuel or warm weather and hot fuel conditions in the fuel tank.\"\nIt added: \"Loss of fuel pressure and flow from the low-pressure fuel pump can be due to internal contamination of the jet pump, specifically in low fuel conditions, and reduced fuel pump internal clearances that result in an increase of internal friction and sensitivity to vapor lock.\"\nWhich Models Are Impacted?\nThe recall affects specific Ford and Lincoln models manufactured in recent years. According to NHTSA documents, these include:\n- 2021\u20132023 Ford Bronco\n- 2021\u20132023 Ford Explorer\n- 2021\u20132023 Lincoln Aviator\n- 2021\u20132023 Ford F-250 SD, F-350 SD, F-450 SD, and F-550 SD\n- 2021\u20132022 Lincoln Navigator\n- 2021\u20132022 Ford Mustang\n- 2021\u20132022 Ford F-150\n- Some 2022 Ford Expedition models\nFord estimated that roughly 10 percent of the 850,318 vehicles included in the recall may be affected by the faulty fuel pump.\nWhat People Are Saying\nThe NHTSA said in its safety recall report: \"Prior to fuel pump failure, the customer may experience poor engine performance (misfiring or running rough), a check engine light, or a reduction in engine power. Fuel pump failure is more likely to occur in low fuel or warm weather and hot fuel conditions in the fuel tank.\"\nIt added in a letter to Ford: \"Under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30112(a)(3), it is illegal for a manufacturer, to sell, offer for sale, import, or introduce or deliver into interstate commerce, a motor vehicle or item of motor vehicle equipment that contains a safety defect once the manufacturer has notified NHTSA about that safety defect. This prohibition does not apply once the motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment has been remedied according to the manufacturer's instructions.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nFord will notify affected owners from July 14 about the potential risks. The carmaker stated that once a solution is available, impacted owners will receive a second letter instructing them on how to obtain a free repair at authorized dealerships.\nOngoing updates from Ford and federal safety authorities are expected as work on the remedy progresses.\nThis article includes reporting by The Associated Press.\nAbout the writer\nMatthew Robinson is the Newsweek U.S. News Editor based in London, U.K. His focus is U.S. politics and national news. ...

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nBilled as a \"Model T moment\" by the company, Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley today announced that the automaker will invest $5 billion into its electric vehicle future, creating 4,000 jobs.\nThe Ford Model T was produced from 1908 to 1927 and is noted as being the first mass-produced, affordable vehicle. Its low cost was greatly attributed to its assembly line construction, which produced the vehicles faster than their paint could dry. The mass assembly of the Model T drove down costs to Ford, the savings from which were passed on to the consumer.\n\"It's just a radical approach... Look, every car company has affordable vehicles. The question is: Do you want to subsidize them, or do you want to make money? Our industry is littered with domestic companies trying to do small cars... You have to apply a lot of innovation. And frankly, we don't know. We've never built a car this way. There are no guarantees,\" Farley told Newsweek from the event.\nToday's announcement comes as the company has faced criticism for the cost of its recalls and lack of public information regarding its electric vehicle strategy, as other automakers have been transparent about their plans, and competition is growing.\n\"We've benchmarked BYD for the last three years and all the other competition,\" Farley told Newsweek from the event. \"You're not going to beat them. You got to get close on cost, but then you have to apply the innovation. That's what we build. That's our bet.\"\nAt an event staged inside the company's Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky, Farley took the stage to defend Ford's strategy to date and spell out details of the company's electron-rich future.\nA new, midsize, four-door battery-electric pickup truck will be added to the company's lineup, which currently includes the small Maverick, midsize Ranger, full-size F-150 and heavy-duty Super Duty pickup trucks, in 2027.\n\"The bottom line is, we had to re-sequence our entire EV lineup,\" Farley told Newsweek from the event. \"We're going to start with this product and this platform here, and then we made adjustments for the other vehicles in the lineup so they're sequenced, because we need a lot of time... EVs, for us, are radically different engineering, manufacturing and supply chain. To do that, we need more time, so we announced the new electric pickup... This will be the first launch. That was not the original plan. We redid that about three years ago.\"\nThe new electric truck will be built at the Louisville plant and Ford aims to have it start at under $30,000. The only other battery-electric truck announced around that price point is Slate's smaller first model, which is expected to have a starting price around $25,000. Slate's truck is scheduled to come to market ahead of the Ford. No electric trucks are currently sold for that amount.\n\"We have a busy 18 months until we start building this vehicle,\" Farley said. \"But what I am confident about is we've done all the cost of ownership, and it is a radically better proposition for some customers who charge at home, don't go long distances (less than 300 miles), they're going to have a completely different cost level. And all the innovation was in that spirit. We want this to be a sustainable project,\" Farley told Newsweek from the event.\nThe F-150 Lightning is the company's all-electric, full-size pickup. Lightning was the best-selling electric truck in America in the second quarter of 2025 and is the best-selling electric truck in the region through mid-year.\n\"The F-150 Lightning proudly holds its position as America's best-selling electric truck, a testament to its enduring customer appeal and contributing to the Ford F-Series 48 years as the best-selling truck in America. The F-150 Lightning embodies Ford's Built Ford Tough DNA while adding innovative benefits like home power backup, lower running costs, and a spacious front trunk. It's a compelling package and ideal choice for customers ready to embrace electric truck ownership, Rob Kaffl, Ford director, U.S. sales and dealer relations, told Newsweek.\nLightning isn't the only battery-electric vehicle Ford sells in the U.S. The electric Ford Mustang Mach-E crossover is one of the best-selling EVs on the road today, traditionally only overshadowed by Tesla products. Like other Ford products, it is offered to business and government customers as a fleet vehicle as well as in more traditional passenger configurations.\nFord plans to sell its new battery-electric truck in the U.S. and overseas. That stands in contrast to its sales of the Maverick, which is only available to customers in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and some countries in South America. It is built in Mexico.\nFord's Ranger is sold in 180 markets and is the best-selling pickup in 21 of them. Ranger is built in Michigan for domestic distribution and Argentina, South Africa, Vietnam and Thailand for global sales.\nF-150 is available to customers in Australia, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as several countries in Central and South America. Its Lightning counterpart is only sold in the U.S. and Canada.\nSuper Duty is sold extensively throughout the world in numerous configurations.\nThe product announcement was joined by news that Ford's BlueOval Battery Park Michigan, located in Marshall, Michigan, will make LFP (lithium ferrophosphate) batteries that will power the new truck. General Motors is betting on LFP chemistry for its future as well, the company told Newsweek in July.\nLithium nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) batteries offer the longest range for battery-electric vehicles, but have a high cost. Lithium-manganese-rich (LMR) battery technology offers high range at a lower cost. LFP batteries are currently widely believed to be the best compromise of performance, cost and range for next-generation EVs across the automotive landscape. LFP batteries are also considered more sustainable than the other two chemistries.\n\"We learn a lot from One Ford, and now we have to make this sustainable, and to do it in our country, and not import from South Korea and Japan. It required all this innovation,\" Farley told Newsweek from the event.\nUpdate 8/11/2025 11:57 a.m. ET: This article has been updated to include quotes from Ford CEO Jim Farley.\nAbout the writer\nEileen Falkenberg-Hull leads the Autos team at Newsweek.
