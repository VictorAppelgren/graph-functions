      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits**\n\n1. **Scope Drift** – The paragraph on “Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 retreated on a tech‑heavy sell‑off” and the long sentence about the Fed’s dovish stance, core PCE, and tariff tensions are outside the Tesla‑centric focus.  Remove or condense these to a single line that simply notes “market volatility is heightened by Fed policy and tariff uncertainty” with a single citation (B1KYJ1GPU).  \n\n2. **Canonical Handle Mapping** – Explicitly map every claim to a canonical handle.  Add “TSLA” for Tesla, “NDX” for Nasdaq, and “SPX” for S&P 500.  Example: “Tesla (TSLA) is trading at $345–$347 (LJZYDXVL3) against a 52‑week low of $207.03 and a high of $488.54.”  \n\n3. **Catalyst Window & Magnitude** – Tighten the catalyst description: “The lawsuit outcome is expected within 2–3 weeks (LJZYDXVL3).  A favorable ruling could lift TSLA 5–10 %; an adverse ruling could depress it 5–15 %.”  For the NHTSA probe, state “NHTSA findings are due in 3–4 weeks (LJZYDXVL3); a clean bill could support a 2–5 % rally, while a penalty could cut 3–8 %.”  \n\n4. **Invalidation & Next Catalysts** – Add a clear invalidation clause: “If the court upholds the $243 M verdict, the upside is capped and the stock may retreat to the $330 support.”  Also note the upcoming Q3 earnings as a secondary catalyst: “Q3 earnings (early September) will be a key confirmation point (B1KYJ1GPU).”  \n\n5. **Citation Density** – Ensure every substantive claim has an inline ID.  For example, “Fed’s 25‑bp cut signal (B1KYJ1GPU)” and “Tariff extension to China (B1KYJ1GPU).”  \n\n6. **Avoid Generic Language** – Replace vague phrases like “market volatility is heightened” with specific drivers: “Fed’s dovish stance, persistent core PCE, and tariff extensions are tightening the equity risk‑premium.”  \n\n7. **Remove Redundant Sentences** – The sentence “Tesla’s stock, trading near $345–$347 (LJZYDXVL3), sits above the 52‑week low …” can be merged into the first bullet on TSLA price to keep the paragraph concise.  \n\nImplement these edits to produce a concise, evidence‑based, Tesla‑focused analysis that meets the 0–3 week horizon and canonical mapping requirements.",
