She was treated at an area hospital for minor injuries, The Associated Press reports.\n\nThe Lost Hills Station of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department told KTLA it responded to a call about the attack shortly after 5.30 p.m on Sunday.\n\nFamily members, including the girl\u2019s mother and sibling, heard the child screaming and ran over.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when the mountain lion proceeded to chase the mother and the sibling,\u201d an agency spokesperson told The Los Angeles Times.\n\nAnother family member approached the creature with a stun gun, and the sound of the weapon reportedly scared the cat away.\n\nOfficials later found a mountain lion in the area and euthanized it.\n\nDNA samples have been taken to confirm if the cougar was the same one that attacked the child.\n\nDangerous encounters with mountain lions are extremely rare, according to state data.\n\nThere have been 27 confirmed attacks on humans since 1986, most of them nonfatal, according to an AP analysis.\n\nIn March of 2024, a mountain lion attacked two brothers near Georgetown in Northern California, killing one of them.\n\nThe encounter was the first fatal cougar attack in two decades in the state.\n\nThat same year, at Malibu Creek State park, a five-year-old boy was pulled from the jaws of a mountain lion, after the cat tried to drag the boy away from a family picnic.\n\n\u201cSomebody screamed the baby\u2019s name, and his dad started running,\u201d one of the boy\u2019s aunts told local news at the time. \u201cThe father grabbed the mountain lion with his hands, and he just fought, Then the mountain lion let go.\u201d",

      "text": "Prison evacuated as Colorado wildfire becomes one of the largest in state history\nOfficials have warned residents of remote areas to be ready to leave as gusty winds and low humidity feed the flames\nA Colorado prison has been evacuated as one of the state's largest ever wildfires continues to grow, with officials warning residents in remote areas to prepare for immediate departure.\nThe Lee Fire has already charred more than 167 square miles (433 square kilometers) across Garfield and Rio Blanco counties, with mountain communities already under evacuation orders. Only six percent of the blaze has been contained.\nGusty winds and low humidity are exacerbating the inferno. However, no injuries or structural damage have been reported.\nAll 179 incarcerated people were safely removed from the Rifle Correctional Center on Saturday \u201cout of an abundance of caution,\u201d the Colorado Department of Corrections said in a statement. They were temporarily relocated about 150 miles (240 kilometers) away to the Buena Vista Correctional Complex, the department said.\nThe Lee Fire, churning through trees and brush about 250 miles (400 kilometers) west of Denver, is now the sixth-largest single fire in the state\u2019s history, according to the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control.\nMore than a thousand firefighters are battling the blaze, working to keep the flames to the west of Colorado 13 and north of County Road 5, officials said.\nHealth officials issued air quality warnings related to smoke from the Lee Fire and the 23-square-mile (60-square-kilometer) Elk Fire burning just to the east.\nIn Southern California, crews reached 62 percent containment on the eight-square-mile (20-square-kilometer) Canyon Fire that forced evacuations and destroyed seven structures after breaking out Thursday near the Los Angeles County and Ventura County line.\nThree firefighters have been injured, including a battalion chief who was seriously hurt when his pickup truck rolled over in steep terrain.\nThe Gifford Fire, California's largest blaze so far this year, has scorched at least 180 square miles (466 square kilometers) of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties since erupting on August 1. It was 21 percent contained on Sunday."

(AP) \u2014 A mountain lion attacked and wounded an 11-year-old girl outside her family\u2019s home in Malibu, California, then chased her mother before it was scared off, authorities said Monday.\nThe girl was near a chicken coop on the property Sunday evening when the cougar attacked her from behind, biting her arm, leg and lower back, according to California Department of Fish and Wildlife spokesperson Peter Tira.\nThe young victim was treated at a hospital for minor injuries, Tira said.\nDuring the attack, the girl\u2019s mother heard her child\u2019s screams and ran over with one of the girl\u2019s siblings.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when the mountain lion proceeded to chase the mother and the sibling,\u201d Tira told the Los Angeles Times.\nAnother family member had a stun gun and the sound of the weapon scared away the big cat, Tira said.\nWildlife officers later found a mountain lion in the area and euthanized it. DNA tests will confirm if it\u2019s the same animal that bit the girl.\nMountain lions rarely attack people. There have been 27 confirmed attacks on humans since 1986, with most of them nonfatal, according to state Fish and Wildlife data.\nThe most recent fatal attack was in March 2024, when a mountain lion killed a 21-year-old man near Georgetown in Northern California.\nLast September, a mountain lion attacked a 5-year-old boy while he was playing near his family\u2019s picnic table at Malibu Creek State Park. The child was treated for non-life-threatening injuries."

Unfortunately, the man was deceased.\nA spokesperson for the family said that the 18-year-old has undergone multiple surgeries for his injuries and is expected to make a full recovery.\nAuthorities have not released the names of the deceased victim and his injured brother at this time.\nWardens and trappers from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) and an El Dorado County trapper were called to the area to find the mountain lion. They located the animal and \u201cdispatched it\u201d.\nThe lion was euthanised near the scene, and the body was sent to a forensics laboratory for DNA examination.\nThe CDFW confirmed on Sunday that DNA samples collected from the scene matched samples that were taken from the mountain lion\u2019s carcass, meaning it was the same animal that performed the deadly attack.\nThe mountain lion weighed 90 pounds and appeared to be healthy, but further analysis by forensic scientists will determine if it had any underlying health conditions.\nAuthorities have been left astonished at this unusual incident, as reported mountain lion attacks are rare.\n\u201cA fatality like this is extremely rare,\u201d Kyle Parker, El Dorado sheriff\u2019s office spokesperson, told local news station KCRA.\nThis tragic attack marks the first confirmed fatality from a mountain lion attack in California in 20 years, CDFW data shows.\nThe last person to lose their life by a mountain lion was a 35-year-old man in January 2004 in the Whiting Ranch Regional Park in Orange County.\nSince then, there have been about a dozen attacks on humans by mountain lions in the state, however, none of which ended in a death until Saturday\u2019s horrific event.\nJosh Rosenau, the director of policy at the Mountain Lion Foundation, a California-based non-profit, explained to The Telegraph that this attack is \u201cincredibly rare\u201d.\n\u201cMountain lions are basically scaredy cats. They\u2019re looking for deer, not people. If you make yourself look big and scary, they will almost always turn and run,\u201d he said.\nEl Dorado County also recommends that you try to appear larger than the mountain lion if you encounter one by raising your arms and opening jackets, and small children should also be picked up.\nThey add that you should not run from a lion you encounter and try to fight back if attacked.\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"
