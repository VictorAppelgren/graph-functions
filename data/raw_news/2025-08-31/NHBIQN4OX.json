  "description": "The need for a ProSocial AI Index is urgent. AI systems increasingly cause positive and irreversibly harmful outcomes. We need a standard to assess these capabilities.",
  "content": "In an era where artificial intelligence systems are increasingly woven into the fabric of our daily lives, from healthcare diagnostics to environmental monitoring, we face a challenge. Our technical capabilities evolve quickly, yet we are struggling to measure whether these advances truly serve ourselves, the society that we are part of and the planet that we depend on. How can we give the necessary impulses to garner that sort of benefit if we are navigating blindly? The emergence of AI as a transformative force demands more than technical performance indicators. It requires a shift in how we assess AI's value \u2014 moving beyond narrow performance metrics toward a comprehensive understanding of AI's social impact.\n\nThe need for a ProSocial AI Index has never been more urgent. AI systems are increasingly capable of , but also . It is time to develop a standardized framework to measure and influence these critical capabilities.\n\nThe current landscape of AI evaluation is dominated by technical benchmarks that, while valuable, tell only part of the story. Accuracy rates, processing speed and computational efficiency have become the gold standards by which we judge AI systems. Yet these metrics, crucial as they are, fail to capture the deeper questions that should guide our technological development: Does this AI system enhance human agency? Does it contribute to environmental sustainability? Does it reduce inequality or inadvertently amplify it?\n\nThis narrow focus exemplifies a classic management principle gone awry: when we mistake \"treasuring what we measure\" for \"measuring what we treasure,\" we optimize for the wrong outcomes. Traditional AI metrics are like measuring a healthcare system solely by the speed of patient processing, ignoring whether patients actually get better. refers to AI systems that are tailored, trained, tested, and targeted to bring out the best in and for people and planet, requiring us to fundamentally reframe how we evaluate AI systems.\n\nThe danger lies not in measurement itself, but in incomplete measurement. When we optimize AI systems solely for technical performance while ignoring their broader social and environmental impacts, we create sophisticated tools that may excel at their narrow tasks while failing spectacularly at serving human flourishing. Beware the measurement trap, a that leads us to prioritize quantifiable metrics over holistic understanding, often with unintended consequences that only become apparent when the damage is already done.\n\noperates on four foundational principles \u2014 the 4T's \u2014 that provide a comprehensive approach to AI development and deployment. These principles represent a paradigm shift from purely technical optimization toward a design that is deliberately driven by the intent to serve people and planet:\n\nProSocial AI systems are tailored to specific communities, contexts and needs, recognizing that one-size-fits-all solutions often fail the very people they claim to serve. They are trained using diverse datasets and learning approaches that reflect the full spectrum of human experience and values. They are tested through rigorous evaluation not just for technical performance, but for their social, ethical and environmental impacts. They are targeted toward specific prosocial outcomes, with mechanisms for ongoing monitoring and adjustment throughout deployment.\n\nThese 4T's provide the conceptual foundation for a prosocial AI Index that could transform how we evaluate and deploy AI systems. Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated technical capabilities, this framework demands holistic assessment that considers AI's role within broader social and ecological systems.\n\nAt the heart of prosocial AI lies a values-led approach that recognizes technology as a means to an end, not an end in itself. This approach draws inspiration from universal ethical principles that have guided human societies across cultures and millennia. The Golden Rule \u2014 \"treat others as you would wish to be treated\" \u2014 appears in virtually every major belief system and provides a useful framework for AI development that transcends cultural boundaries.\n\nIncorporating the Golden Rule into AI utility functions could provide a for prosocial behavior in artificial systems. Beyond philosophical idealism it's a practical approach to ensure AI systems serve human flourishing rather than narrow optimization targets.\n\nWhen we embed universal values like the Golden Rule into our AI measurement frameworks, we create systems that inherently consider the welfare of all stakeholders \u2014 not just the interest of the organizations deploying them. This values-led approach requires us to ask fundamental questions: Would we want to be subject to the decisions this AI system makes? Would we want our children to grow up in a world shaped by this technology? Would we want our planet's future determined by these algorithmic choices?\n\nThe ProSocial AI Index: A Tool To Test And Transform\n\nA comprehensive ProSocial AI Index would serve multiple functions simultaneously: assessment tool, educational framework and catalyst for transformation. Unlike existing AI evaluation methods that primarily serve technical communities, this index would be designed for use across multiple stakeholder groups \u2014 individuals evaluating the AI systems they interact with, organizations assessing their AI implementations and nations developing AI governance frameworks.\n\nThe index can evaluate AI systems across multiple dimensions aligned with the 4T's framework.\n\nTailored : Metrics to assess cultural responsiveness, accessibility and community engagement in development processes.\n\nTrained: Indicators to evaluate for dataset diversity, bias mitigation, and inclusion of marginalized perspectives.\n\nTargeted: Metric to assess for clear prosocial objectives, measurable positive outcomes and adaptive learning capabilities.\n\nRecent developments, including Switzerland's AI for initiative and emerging AI ethics frameworks, demonstrate growing recognition that we need new approaches to AI evaluation. The and similar initiatives provide useful foundations, but it is time to go beyond compliance with minimum standards. A prosocial AI Index will go beyond safety to actively measure positive impact. Beyond looking at neutral versus harmful, it assesses the positive outcomes of the algorithmic landscape that we are designing in view of pragmatic recommendations for course correction and chartering.\n\nThe ProSocial AI Index operates from a systems thinking perspective that recognizes the interconnectedness of human and planetary wellbeing. Climate change, biodiversity loss, social inequality and technological disruption are not separate challenges \u2014 they are interconnected symptoms of systems that prioritize short-term optimization over long-term sustainability.\n\nAI systems designed and evaluated through a prosocial lens necessarily consider their environmental footprint, their impacts on social cohesion, their effects on human agency and dignity and their contributions to global resilience. This requires measurement frameworks that can capture complex, interconnected outcomes rather than isolated metrics.\n\nFor example, an AI system used in agriculture would be evaluated not just for its ability to increase crop yields, but for its impacts on soil health, farmer autonomy, biodiversity, water usage, and community resilience. Similarly, an AI system used in healthcare must be assessed not only for diagnostic accuracy but for its effects on patient-provider relationships, healthcare accessibility and health equity.\n\nThe true test of any measurement framework lies not in its theoretical elegance but in its practical application. A ProSocial AI Index is to be designed for use by diverse stakeholders with varying levels of technical expertise and different organizational contexts.\n\nFor individuals, the index will provide accessible tools to evaluate the AI systems they encounter daily \u2014 from recommendation algorithms to virtual assistants. A simple assessment framework can help people understand better whether the AI systems they use are designed to serve their interests or exploit their attention and data.\n\nFor organizations, the index provides comprehensive evaluation frameworks that integrate with existing governance structures. Companies can use the index to assess their AI implementations across the 4T's, identifying areas for improvement and demonstrating genuine commitment to prosocial impact rather than mere compliance.\n\nFor nations, the index provides policy frameworks for AI governance that go beyond risk mitigation to actively promote positive outcomes. Countries could use the index to evaluate their AI ecosystems, identify areas needing support or regulation, and demonstrate global leadership in responsible AI development.\n\nPending official incentives organizations and individuals can begin implementing a prosocial AI assessment using the 4T's framework today:\n\nTailored Assessment: Evaluate whether AI systems are designed with specific communities and contexts in mind. Ask: Who was involved in designing this system? Whose needs does it serve? How does it account for different cultural contexts and accessibility requirements? Score the systems that you use based on their inclusivity in design processes and responsiveness to diverse user needs.\n\nTraining Evaluation: Assess the data and learning approaches used to develop AI systems. Examine: What data was used for training? How diverse and representative are the datasets? What biases might be embedded in the training process? How are these biases being addressed? Measure systems based on data diversity, bias mitigation efforts, and transparency in training methodologies.\n\nTesting Rigor: Evaluate the comprehensiveness of testing beyond technical performance. Consider: How has this system been tested for social impact? What are its environmental consequences? How might it affect different user groups? What unintended consequences have been identified and addressed? Rate systems based on the breadth and depth of their testing across social, ethical, and environmental dimensions.\n\nTargeted Impact: Assess whether AI systems have clear prosocial objectives and measurable positive outcomes. Determine: What positive impact is this system designed to achieve? How is this impact being measured? How does the system adapt and improve over time? What mechanisms exist for accountability and course correction? Score systems based on clarity of prosocial objectives, measurement of positive outcomes, and adaptive learning capabilities.\n\nWhile we might not have all the necessary information to answer these questions \u2013 the most important step is to start asking; sharpening our awareness of the multilayered implications of our artificial assets\n\nMeasuring Our Way To A Bright Hybrid Future\n\nThe development of a prosocial AI Index represents more than a technical challenge \u2014 it's a moral imperative and a practical necessity for navigating our AI-infused future. By creating comprehensive measurement frameworks that capture the full spectrum of AI's impact on human and planetary wellbeing, we can ensure that our most powerful technologies serve our highest aspirations.\n\nIt is a choice. We can continue optimizing AI systems for narrow technical metrics while hoping for positive social outcomes, or we can deliberately design measurement frameworks that align AI development with human flourishing. The prosocial AI Index offers a path forward \u2014 are we willing to walk it?",

      "text": "\u201cDo unto others as you would have them do unto you.\u201d\nThe Golden Rule. This may have been the first Sunday School lesson I learned (thanks, Mrs. Monroe).\nThe Golden Rule is a moral principle that states that you should treat others as you would like others to treat you. It is a foundational principle across many cultures and religions. As such, the Golden Rule should play an essential role in developing AI systems that deliver meaningful, relevant, responsible, and ethical outcomes.\nLet\u2019s use this blog to explore how we might integrate the Golden Rule into the AI Utility Function, the mathematical formula governing the AI model\u2019s decision-making process.\nUnderstanding the AI Model Golden Rule Ramifications\nEncoding the Golden Rule into the AI utility function would involve specifying a set of rules \u2013 and the variables and metrics against which would measure the effectiveness of those rules \u2013 that govern the behavior of the AI system. This would include rules such as:\n- The AI system should treat humans with respect and dignity.\n- The AI system should not harm or allow humans to come to harm.\n- The AI system should be transparent in its actions and explain its decisions when humans request it.\n- The AI system should treat humans fairly and impartially without discriminating based on race, gender, or other protected characteristics and traits.\n- The AI system should use data responsibly and respect the privacy and consent of data subjects.\n- The AI system should be inclusive and work equally well across all spectra of society, avoiding bias and discrimination.\n- The AI system should have a positive purpose and contribute to the well-being and flourishing of human beings and the environment.\n- The AI system should be explainable and provide understandable and meaningful reasons for its actions and decisions.\n- The AI system should be trustworthy and act reliably, consistently, and honestly.\nThis is a great start and starts to make actionable the aspirations of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy AI Bill of Rights (Figure 1).\nFigure 1: The AI Bill of Rights\nThese rules become a mandatory checklist for any organization that seeks to design, develop, deploy, and monitor AI models that deliver meaningful, relevant, responsible, and ethical outcomes. And to make these rules actionable, we must integrate these rules, and their associated measures, into the AI Utility Function.\nRefresher on the AI Utility Function\nThe AI utility function is a mathematical function that defines the goal or goals that the AI system is programmed to optimize.\nThe AI Utility Function assigns values to certain actions that the AI system can take. It captures the AI system\u2019s preferences over possible alternatives. The higher the value, the more desirable the action or outcome is for the AI system. The AI utility function guides the decision-making process of the AI system by helping it to choose the action that maximizes its expected utility.\nFigure 2: Defining the AI Utility Function\nIntegrating the rules associated Golden Rule into the AI utility function can guide the AI system to behave ethically. To integrate the Golden Rule into the AI utility function, one would want to assign higher utility values to actions or outcomes that are consistent with the Golden Rule and lower utility values to actions or outcomes that violate the Golden Rule. For example, if the AI system is faced with a choice between helping a human in need or ignoring them, it could assign a higher utility value to help them because that is what it would want others to do for it if it were in need.\nIntegrating the Golden Rule into the AI Utility Function\nWe could use the following process to integrate the Golden Rule into the AI Utility Function:\n- Define context. The Golden Rule can be interpreted in different ways depending on the context and scope of the AI system. For example, an AI system that interacts with customers in a retail store would have different rules than an AI system that monitors traffic flow in a city. Defining the context and scope helps narrow the relevant rules and metrics.\n- Align rules. Identifying and aligning the rules that define the Golden Rules to the specific and relevant context and scope of the AI system is critical to the delivery of meaningful, relevant, responsible, and ethical outcomes. For example, in the case of a retail store AI system, rules could include treating customers with respect, providing accurate information, and protecting their privacy.\n- Codify rules. Translating and codifying the rules into quantifiable measures is the heart of the process. Once the rules are aligned with the AI system context, the next step is to translate those rules into metrics that measure the effectiveness of those specific rules. For example, in the retail example, if the rule that we were seeking to integrate into the AI Utility Function was to \u201ctreat humans with respect and dignity,\u201d then the metrics could include the number of customer complaints, the percentage of correct information provided, and the degree of transparency in data collection.\n- Assign weights. Assigning weights to the metrics is necessary to determine the importance of each metric and the level of adherence required. This step requires the involvement and guidance of domain experts and stakeholders who are at the front lines of customer engagement and operational execution. In the retail example, our experts might decide that the weight assigned to customer privacy should be 50% higher than the weight assigned to the accuracy of product recommendations.\n- Incorporate into the AI utility function. Once the metrics and their weights are defined, they can then be incorporated into the AI utility function. The AI utility function then maps the inputs to the desired outputs to facilitate the trade-off decisions necessary to deliver meaningful, relevant, responsible, and ethical outcomes.\nBy identifying and integrating the metrics associated with the Golden Rule into the AI Utility Function, the AI system can be designed, deployed, managed, and monitored to ensure that the behaviors exhibited by the AI system align with the principles of the Golden Rule (Figure 3).\nFigure 3: Integrating Golden Rule into AI Utility Function\nSummary: The Golden Rule and the AI Utility Function \u2013 Part I\nIn Part 1 of the 2-part series on integrating the Golden Rule into the AI Utility Function, we first reviewed the Golden Rule (hey, it\u2019s been a few years since Bible School for some of us). We then decomposed the Golden Rule into a series of rules that could provide actionable and measurable teeth to the AI Bill of Rights.\nThen after a quick review of the AI Utility Function, we reviewed a simple process that any Citizen of Data Science could leverage to ensure that AI models are integrating the concepts of the Golden Rule to design, define, develop, and manage AI models in the delivery of meaningful, relevant, responsible, and ethical outcomes.\nIn part 2, we\u2019ll dive into the specific variables and metrics one could use to integrate the Golden Rule into the AI Utility Function, but not before another (hehehe) lesson in economics."

      "text": "- Comment\n- Open access\n- Published:\nProSocial artificial intelligence as a catalyst for holistic health: a multidimensional approach\nBMC Global and Public Health volume 2, Article number: 76 (2024)\nProSocial artificial intelligence (PsAI) is a transformative approach aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. It advocates for AI systems centered on human values, equity, and sustainability, aiming to enhance healthcare access, efficiency, and affordability, especially for underserved communities, promoting global well-being.\nThe global context of health and well-being\nThe eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), set by the United Nations (UN) in 2000, aimed to tackle a range of global issues by 2015: eradicating poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary education, promoting gender equality, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, combating HIV/AIDS and other diseases, ensuring environmental sustainability, and fostering global partnerships for development. Building on the unfulfilled promises of the MDGs, the UN adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, creating a renewed and more comprehensive global framework. These 17 goals are designed to foster peace and prosperity for people and the planet, addressing challenges that span poverty, health, education, inequality, and environmental sustainability. Unlike the MDGs, the SDGs emphasize the interconnectedness of these challenges, recognizing that economic growth must be pursued alongside efforts to reduce inequality, mitigate climate change, and protect natural ecosystems such as oceans and forests. With over 8 billion people on the planet\u2014half of whom still suffer from preventable deprivation\u2014the ambition to achieve a world free from want is immense. As of today, the world is thoroughly off-track in terms of achieving any of the SDGs [1]. However, the obstacle is not a lack of resources but the political will, collaborative efforts, and concrete actions needed to bridge the gap.\nNew technology, even one as far-reaching as generative artificial intelligence (genAI), will not change that\u2014if it is driven by for-profit interests, like the technologies that came before as part of the First, Second, and Third Industrial Revolutions.\nThe framework of ProSocial artificial intelligence: a holistic, multidimensional approach\nThe current Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is characterized by the internet, but also machine learning, quantum computing, and AI [2], has the potential to take humanity to the stage where every human being has a fair chance to fulfill their inherent potential. However, such positive outcomes will not arise automatically from the availability of ever more sophisticated artificial assets. To harness AI as a catalyst of social wellbeing in general, and universal access to quality care in particular, the underpinning vocation must change. Enter ProSocial AI, which refers to AI systems that are tailored, trained, tested, and targeted to bring out the best in and for people and planet [3]. We must reframe AI from a commercial determinant of society to a social determinant of life.\nProSocial AI offers a comprehensive framework that integrates AI across multiple dimensions of health and well-being. Anchored in the POZE paradigm\u2014Perspective, Optimization, Zeniths, and Exposure\u2014 it enables AI to operate effectively at the micro, meso, macro, and meta levels of health [4]. This approach ensures that AI not only addresses individual health needs but also promotes community health, informs public health policy, and contributes to planetary well-being while optimizing the mutual interplays within and between these dimensions. Figure 1 illustrates the mutual influence of the four dimensions that constitute life in society. Examples:\n-\nMicro (individual level): Personalized health interventions powered by AI, such as tailored mental heath apps, support preventive behaviors and empower individuals to manage their own health.\n-\nMeso (community level): AI-driven telemedicine solutions can extend health services to underserved populations, promoting health equity and reducing disparities in healthcare access.\n-\nMacro (societal level): At the societal level, AI can inform public health strategies through data analytics and predictive modeling, helping policymakers design inclusive health policies that address systemic inequalities.\n-\nMeta (planetary level): ProSocial AI supports environmental sustainability by optimizing healthcare resource use and reducing waste, contributing to the global goal of planetary health while empowering end-users to make not only informed but empowered choices.\nProSocial AI, designed to prioritize human values, equity, and sustainability, has immense potential to support the SDGs. Unlike conventional AI focused on commercial gains, ProSocial AI emphasizes holistic, inclusive growth, addressing issues from poverty and health to environmental sustainability. By integrating AI that operates at individual, community, societal, and planetary levels, ProSocial AI can enhance access to essential services, improve efficiency in resource use, and promote sustainable practices. This approach aligns technology with global well-being, fostering a world where AI serves the public good and accelerates progress toward the SDGs.\nEstablishing a formal foundation for the power-couple AI@SDGs, or ProSocial AI, the recently adopted Global Digital Compact [5] underscores the need for a human-centered digital future that aligns technology with the broader goals of equity and sustainability. The compact highlights the importance of closing digital divides, advancing responsible AI governance, and ensuring that digital technologies, including AI, are harnessed for the public good. Hereby it addresses the recommendations of the UN High-Level Report on Governing AI for Humanity [6], which emphasizes the need for global cooperation to ensure AI promotes human well-being and planetary health, aligning AI governance with the SDGs.\nProSocial AI and the SDGs: a blueprint for sustainable health\nProSocial AI represents a paradigm shift in the way AI can support the SDGs, particularly in the realm of health and well-being. By prioritizing human values, compassion, equity, and sustainability, ProSocial AI can contribute directly to achieving Universal Health Care (UHC), and hereby help humanity to reach Goal 3, which aims to ensure healthy lives and well-being for all, addressing issues like maternal and child mortality, epidemics, and access to affordable medicines. AI\u2019s data processing and predictive capabilities offer vast potential to support these objectives, especially by strengthening health systems. By enhancing healthcare delivery, particularly in underserved regions, AI-driven innovations like telemedicine can expand access to essential services. However, realizing this potential requires human commitment.\nThe related framework not only addresses immediate healthcare challenges but also aligns with other SDG goals, such as reducing inequalities (SDG 10), fostering innovation (SDG 9), and ensuring sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11). Examples from the realm of health that illustrate the complementarity of multiple goals:\n-\nSDG 3: Good health and well-being\n-\n\u25e6 Individual (micro): AI-driven healthcare solutions, such as personalized health interventions and AI-powered diagnostics, cannot only enhance preventive care and treatment but also empower end-users, helping them understand and address their physical and mental health. In the short term, this facilitates shared decision-making of practitioners and patients and, in the long run, improves health outcomes.\n-\n-\nSDG 10: Reduced inequalities\n-\n\u25e6 Communities (meso): AI can bridge gaps in healthcare access between and within demographic groups. Expanding the reach of telemedicine and providing 24/7 diagnostic tools in remote areas, AI can help ensure that people, regardless of their geographic or socioeconomic status, have access to essential health services, while allowing end-users to go on a lifelong learning journey toward better decisions.\n-\n-\nSDG 9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure\n-\n\u25e6 Country (macro): AI-driven telemedicine platforms and personalized health apps represent a new frontier in national and local healthcare, helping to modernize outdated health systems, expanding prevention and treatment choices, and improving service efficiency.\n-\n-\nSDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities\n-\n\u25e6 Planet (meta): AI can make health systems more resilient and appropriate to changing circumstances and more agile in responding to evolving end-user needs and preferences. With resource optimization, AI-human complementarity can reduce costs, both financial and environmental.\n-\nUniversal Health Coverage: leveraging AI for inclusive health systems\nAt least half of the world\u2019s population lacks access to essential health services, and about 100 million people are pushed into extreme poverty each year due to out-of-pocket spending on health [7]. Universal Health Coverage (UHC) aims to ensure that all people have access to the health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship [8]. It is an integral part of SDG 3, and translating it from commitment to concreteness is overdue. Leveraging ProSocial AI aligns with this mission by enhancing healthcare access, availability, affordability, and appropriation.\nAccess: AI-driven telemedicine and diagnostic tools broaden access to essential health services, particularly for remote or underserved areas. By facilitating real-time diagnostics, AI reduces the healthcare burden and improves the speed and accuracy of diagnoses.\nAvailability: AI boosts health system efficiency by automating tasks and optimizing resource use, thus lowering costs and enhancing response to public health needs, such as predicting outbreaks and directing resources effectively.\nAffordability: AI lowers healthcare costs by improving resource allocation and reducing reliance on expensive in-person care. AI-powered early diagnostics and preventive measures minimize the need for costly interventions.\nAppropriation: Personalized AI-driven care tailors treatment to individual needs, improving outcomes and patient satisfaction. Real-time data analysis enables tailored recommendations, enhancing the overall quality of care.\nConclusions\nProSocial AI represents a transformative approach to integrating AI into healthcare systems, aligning with the SDGs, and catalyzing access and availability to holistic health and well-being. By prioritizing ethics, sustainability, and inclusivity, ProSocial AI ensures that AI becomes a forceful tool for fostering long-term health for individuals, communities, and the planet.\nAs we move towards a future where generative AI is increasingly influencing our lives it matters to remember that technology is a mirror of humans. We cannot expect artificial intelligence to reflect values that the people who design, deliver and use it do not manifest. Garbage in, Garbage out (GIGO) or Values in, Values out (VIVO). The choice is ours, but we must make it.\nData availability\nNo datasets were generated or analysed during the current study.\nReferences\nUNSD (2024) UN SDG report 2024 https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2024/\nWEF (2016) The Fourth Industrial Revolution https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-and-how-to-respond/\nWalther C.

      "text": "The Golden Rule\nThe most familiar version of the Golden Rule says, \u201cDo unto others as you would have them do unto you.\u201d Moral philosophy has barely taken notice of the golden rule in its own terms despite the rule\u2019s prominence in commonsense ethics. This article approaches the rule, therefore, through the rubric of building its philosophy, or clearing a path for such construction. The approach reworks common belief rather than elaborating an abstracted conception of the rule\u2019s logic. Working \u201cbottom-up\u201d in this way builds on social experience with the rule and allows us to clear up its long-standing misinterpretations. With those misconceptions go many of the rule\u2019s criticisms.\nThe article notes the rule\u2019s highly circumscribed social scope in the cultures of its origin and its role in framing psychological outlooks toward others, not directing behavior. This emphasis eases the rule\u2019s \u201cburdens of obligation,\u201d which are already more manageable than expected in the rule\u2019s primary role, socializing children. The rule is distinguished from highly supererogatory rationales commonly confused with it\u2014loving thy neighbor as thyself, turning the other cheek, and aiding the poor, homeless and afflicted. Like agape or unconditional love, these precepts demand much more altruism of us, and are much more liable to utopianism. The golden rule urges more feasible other-directedness and egalitarianism in our outlook.\nA raft of additional rationales is offered to challenge the rule\u2019s reputation as overly idealistic and infeasible in daily life. While highlighting the golden rule\u2019s psychological functions, doubt is cast on the rule\u2019s need for empathy and cognitive role-taking. The rule can be followed through adherence to social reciprocity conventions and their approved norms. These may provide a better guide to its practice than the personal exercise of its empathic perspective. This seems true even in novel situations for which these cultural norms can be extrapolated. Here the golden rule also can function as a procedural standard for judging the moral legitimacy of certain conventions.\nPhilosophy\u2019s two prominent analyses of the golden rule are credited, along with the prospects for assimilating such a rule of thumb, to a universal principle in general theory. The failures of this generalizing approach are detailed, however, in preserving the rule\u2019s distinct contours. The pivotal role of conceptual reductionism is discussed in mainstream ethical theory, noting that other forms of theorizing are possible and are more fit to rules of thumb. Circumscribed, interpersonal rationales like the golden rule need not be viewed philosophically as simply yet-to-be generalized societal principles. Instead, the golden rule and its related rationales-of-scale may need more piecemeal analyses, perhaps know-how models of theory, integrating algorithms and problem-solving procedures that preserve the specialized roles and scope. Neither mainstream explanatory theory, hybrid theory, nor applied ethics currently focuses on such modeling. Consequently, the faults in golden-rule thinking, as represented in general principles, may say less about inherent flaws in the rule\u2019s logic than about shortfalls in theory building.\nFinally, a radically different perspective is posed, depicting the golden rule as a description, not prescription, that portrays the symptoms of certain epiphanies and personal transformations observed in spiritual experience.\nTable of Contents\n- Common Observations and Tradition\n- What Achilles Heel?\n- Sibling Rules and Associated Principles\n- Golden Role-Taking and Empathy\n- The Rule of Love: Agape and Unconditionality\n- Philosophical Slight\n- Sticking Points\n- Ethical Reductionism\n- Ill-Fitting Theory (Over-Generalizing Rules of Thumb)\n- Know-How Theory (And Medium-Sized Rationales)\n- Regressive Default (Is Ancient Wisdom Out-Dated?)\n- When is a Rule Not a Rule, but a Description?\n- References and Further Reading\n1. Common Observations and Tradition\n\u201cDo unto others as you would have them do unto you.\u201d This seems the most familiar version of the golden rule, highlighting its helpful and proactive gold standard. Its corollary, the so-called \u201csilver rule,\u201d focuses on restraint and non-harm: \u201cdo nothing to others you would not have done to you.\u201d There is a certain legalism in the way the \u201cdo not\u201d corollary follows its proactive \u201cdo unto\u201d partner, in both Western and Eastern scriptural traditions. The rule\u2019s benevolent spirit seems protected here from being used to mask unsavory intents and projects that could be hidden beneath. (It is sobering to encounter the same positive-negative distinction, so recently introduced to handle modern moral dilemmas like abortion, thriving in 500 B.C.E.)\nThe golden rule is closely associated with Christian ethics though its origins go further back and graces Asian culture as well. Normally we interpret the golden rule as telling us how to act. But in practice its greater role may be psychological, alerting us to everyday self-absorption, and the failure to consider our impacts on others. The rule reminds us also that we are peers to others who deserve comparable consideration. It suggests a general orientation toward others, an outlook for seeing our relations with them. At the least, we should not impact others negatively, treating their interests as secondary.\nThis is a strongly egalitarian message. When first conveyed, in the inegalitarian social settings of ancient Hebrews, it could have been a very radical message. But it likely was not, since it appears in scripture as an obscure bit of advice among scores of rules with greater point and stricture, given far more emphasis. Most likely the rule also assumed existing peer-conventions for interacting with clan-members, neighbors, co-workers, friends and siblings. In context, the rule affirmed a sentiment like \u201cWe\u2019re all Jews here,\u201d or \u201call of sect Y.\u201d Only when this rule was made a centerpiece of social interaction (by Jesus or Yeshua, and fellow John-the-Baptist disciples) did it become a more radical message, crossing class, clan and tribal boundaries within Judaism. Of special note is the rule\u2019s application to outcasts and those below one\u2019s station\u2014the poor, lepers, Samaritans, and certain heathens (goyem). Yeshua apparently made the rule second in importance only to the First Commandment of \u201cthe Father\u201d (Hashem). This was to love God committedly, then love thy neighbor as thyself, which raised the rule\u2019s status greatly. It brought social inclusivity to center stage, thus shifting the focus of Jewish ethics generally. Yet the \u201clove thy neighbor\u201d maxim far exceeds the golden rule in its moral expectations. It stresses loving identification with others while the golden rule merely advises equal treatment.\nOnly when the golden rule was applied across various cultures did it become a truly revolutionary message. Its \u201cgood news,\u201d spread by evangelists like Paul (Saul of Tarsus), fermented a consciousness-shift among early Christians, causing them actually to \u201clove all of God\u2019s children\u201d equally, extending to the sharing of all goods and the acceptance of women as equals. Perhaps this was because such love and sharing radically departed from Jewish tradition and was soon replaced with standard patriarchy and private property. The rule\u2019s socialism might have fermented social upheaval in occupied Roman territories had it actually been practiced on a significant scale, which may help explain its persecution in that empire. Most likely the golden rule was not meant for such universalism, however, and cannot feasibly function on broad scales.\nThe Confucian version of the golden rule faced a more rigid Chinese clan system, outdoing the Hebrews in social-class distinctions and the sense that many lives are worthless. More, Confucius himself made the golden rule an unrivaled centerpiece of his philosophy of life (The Analects, 1962). The rule, Kung-shu, came full-blown from the very lips and writings of the \u201cmorality giver\u201d and in seemingly universal form. It played a role comparable to God\u2019s will, in religious views, to which the concept of \u201cheaven\u201d or \u201cfate\u201d was a distant second. And Confucius explicitly depicted the \u201cshu\u201d component as human-heartedness, akin to compassion. Confucian followers succeeding Mencius into the neo-Confucians, however, emphasized the Kung component or ritual righteousness. They increasingly interpreted the rule within the existing network of Chinese social conventions. It was a source of cultural status quoism\u2014to each social station, its proper portion. Eventually, what came to be called the Rule of the Measuring Square was associated with up to a thousand ritual directives for daily life encompassing etiquette, propriety and politeness within the array of traditional relationships and their strict role-obligations. The social status quo in Confucian China was anything but compassionate, especially in the broader community and political arenas of life.\nIn traditional culture, the \u201cothers\u201d in \u201cdo unto others\u201d was interpreted as \u201crelevant others,\u201d which made the rule much easier to follow, if far less egalitarian or inspiring. One\u2019s true peers were identified only within one\u2019s class, gender, or occupation, as well as one\u2019s extended family members. Generalizing peer relations more broadly was unthinkable, apparently, and was therefore not read into the rule\u2019s intent. Confucius spoke of hopelessly searching in vain, his whole life for one person who could practice Kung-shu for one single day. But clearly he meant one \u201cman,\u201d not person, and one \u201cgentleman\u201d of the highest class. This classism was a source of conflict between Confucianism and Taoism, where the lowest of the low were often depicted as spiritual exemplars.\nFor the golden rule to have become so pervasive across historical epochs and cultures suggests a growing suspicion of class and ethnic distinctions\u2014challenging ethnocentrism. This trend dovetails nicely with the rule\u2019s challenge to egocentrism at the personal level. The rule\u2019s strong and explicit egalitarianism has the same limited capture today as it did originally, confined to distinctly religious and closed communities of very limited scope. It is unclear that devout, modern-day Jews or Christians vaunt strong equality of treatment even as an ideal to strive toward. We may speak of social outcasts in our society as comrades, and recognize members of \u201cstrange\u201d cultures and unfriendly nations as \u201cfellow children of God.\u201d But we rarely place them on a par with those closer by or close to us, nor treat them especially well. Neither is it clear, to some, that doing so would be best. Instead, the rule\u2019s original small scope and design is preserved, limited to primary groups at most.\nBiblical scholars tend to see Yeshua\u2019s message as meant for Jews per se, extending to the treatment of non-Jews yes, but as Jews should treat them. And this does not include treating them as Jews. The golden rule has a very different meaning when it is a circumscribed, in-group prescription. In this form, its application is guided by hosts of assumptions, expectations, traditions, and religious obligations, recognized like-mindedly by \u201cthe tribe.\u201d This helps solve the ambiguity problem of how to apply the rule within different roles: parents dealing with children, supervisors with rank-and-file employees, and the like.\n2. What Achilles Heel?\nWhen considering a prominent view late in its history, its paths of development also merit analysis. How were its uses broadened or updated over time, to fit modern contexts? Arguably the Paulist extension of the rule to heathens was such a development, as was the rule\u2019s secularization. The rule\u2019s philosophical recasting as a universal principle qualifies most within moral theory. Just as important are ways the rule has been misconstrued and misappropriated, veering from its design function.\nWe must acknowledge that the golden rule is no longer taken seriously in practice or even aspiration, but merely paid lip service. The same feature that makes the golden rule gleam\u2014its idealism\u2014has dimmed its prospects for influence. The rule is simply too idealistic; that is its established reputation. Note that over-idealism has not discredited Kantian or Utilitarian principles, by contrast, because general theory poses conceptual objects, idealized by nature. They focus on explanation in principle, not application in the concrete. But the golden rule is to be followed, and following the golden rule requires a saintly, unselfish disposition to operate, with a utopian world to operate in. This is common belief. Cloistered monasteries and spiritual communes (Bruderhofs, Koinonia) are its hold-out domains. But even as an ideal in everyday life, the rule is confined to preaching, teaching, and window dressing. Why then make it the object of serious analysis? The following considerations challenge the rule\u2019s blanket dismissal in practice.\nFirst, the silver component of the golden rule merely bids that we do no harm by mistreating others\u2014treating them the way we would not wish to be treated. There is a general moral consensus in any society on what constitutes harms and mistreatments, wrongs and injustices. So to obey this component of the golden rule is something we typically expect of each other, even without explicitly consulting a hallowed precept. Adhering specifically to the golden rule\u2019s guidelines, then, raises no special difficulty. Its silver role is mostly educative in this context, helping us understand why we expect certain behavior from each other. \u201cSee how it feels\u201d when folk violate expectations?\nThe gold in the rule asks more from us, treating people in fair, beneficial, even helpful ways. As some have it, we are to be loving toward others, even when others do not reciprocate, or in fact mistreat us. This would be asking much. But despite appearance, the golden rule does not ask it of us. Nothing about love or generosity is mentioned in the rule, nor implied, much less letting oneself be taken advantage of. Loving thy neighbor as oneself, or turning the other cheek, are distinct precepts\u2014distinct from the golden rule and from each other. These rules are not stated or identified with the golden rationale in biblical or Confucian scripture. Nor are they illustrated together, say in the parables.\nWe may wish we loved everyone and that everyone loved us, but a wish is not a prescription or command\u2014\u201cDo unto.\u201d And we cannot feasibly love on demand, either in our hearts or actions. (Can we learn to love others as ourselves over a lifetime?) But we can certainly consider how we need or prefer to be treated. And we can treat others that way on almost all occasions, on the spot, without needing to undergo a prior regimen of prayer, meditation, or working with the poor.\nAs noted, the golden rule may deal more with being other-directed and sensitive rather than proactive. Leading with the word \u201cDo\u201d does not necessarily signal the rule\u2019s demand for action anymore than parents saying to teenagers, \u201cBe good,\u201d when they go on a date. Whether they are (should be) a certain way isn\u2019t the point. There is no need for them to engage their character and its traits, for example. The focus here is on what they do, actually, and should not do. Likewise with \u201cDo your part\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t get in the way\u201d: these are general directives of how to orient ourselves on certain occasions. They prime us to take certain sorts of postures, showing a readiness to cooperate or to ask others if we are being a pest, though we may not succeed even if we try. They prime us to apologize if in fact we do get in the way, but maybe not more than that.\nNo altruism (self-sacrifice) is needed for golden-ruling in this psychological form for adopting a certain \u201cother-orientation\u201d in \u201cthe spirit of\u201d greater awareness toward others. Usually one bears no cost to engage empathetic feelings, if that is what is needed. One wonders whether an implicit sense of this merely attitudinal \u201cspirit\u201d of the golden rule helps account for why we do not practice it\u2014no hypocrisy required. If so, it would allow an uplifting turnaround in our moral self-understanding and self-criticism.\nConjuring up certain outlooks or orientations is an especially feasible task when provided a golden recipe for how\u2014by role-taking, for example, or empathy or adherence to reciprocity norms. Once our heart goes out to others, following its spontaneous pull hardly requires going the extra foot, much less a mile in effort for anyone. We simply do what we feel, as much as the pull tugs us to. The truth is that we interact largely in words, and kindly words are free. We\u2019re often not occupied when called upon to respond to others, so that responding lushly is easy\u2014there is no hefty competition for our time or interest. Consider the sort of \u201cdo-unto\u201d that can make a person\u2019s week: \u201cI wanted to mention how much I appreciate your support during this transition time for me. It\u2019s noticeable, and it means a lot.\u201d\nIt pays moral philosophy to think the golden rule through in such actual everyday circumstances before imagining the rule\u2019s costs in principle, or worst-case scenarios. Where school systems routinely include some degree of moral education in their curricula, the case for golden-rule feasibility in a society is even stronger. And, arguably, most children already get some such training in school and at home implicitly.\nThe same reduced-effort scenario holds when sizing up moral exemplarism, often associated with the golden-rule, and with living its sibling principles. Ministering to the poor and ill often involves the routine work of truckers or dock workers, loading canned food or medical supplies to be hauled away, or hauling it oneself. It may involve primitive nursing or cooking, and point of contact service work routinely taken on as jobs by non-exemplars. These are not seen as careers in saintly heroism. Pursuing such work as a mission, not an occupation, takes significant commitment and gumption. But many exemplars report gradually falling into their roles, without really noticing or thinking clearly (David Fattah of Umoja House) or of being dragged into \u201cthe life\u201d by others (Andrie Sakharov and Martin Luther King, for example.) (See Colby and Damon 1984, Oliner and Oliner 1988, The Noetics Institute \u201cCreative Altruist\u201d Profiles). More, everyday exemplars report doing their work out of an atypical outlook on society and their relation to it. This comes spontaneously to them, as ours comes to us. No additional, much less extraordinary effort is required. This seems the point of Mother Teresa\u2019s refrain to those asking how she could possibly work with lepers and the dying, \u201cCome see.\u201d\nIf the golden rule is designed for small-group interaction, where face-to face relations dominate, a failure to reciprocate in kind will be noticed. It cannot be hidden as in anonymous, institutionally-mediated cooperation at a distance. Subtle pressures will be felt to conform with this group norm, and subtle sanctions will apply to those who take more than they give. Conforming to norms in this setting will be easier than usual, as well, since in-groups attract the like-minded. And in such contexts requiring extraordinarily helpful motivations and actions from others would be seen as unfair.\nBy assessing the golden rule outside of such contexts we miss its implicit components, the network of mutual understandings, and established community practices that make its adherence feasible and comprehensible. Such considerations are also crucial in determining the adequacy of the golden rule. The shortfalls that have been identified by the rule\u2019s detractors seemingly arise when the rule is over-generalized and set to tasks beyond its design. If its function is primarily psychological, its conceptual or theoretical faults are not key. If its design is small-scale, fit to primary relations, its danger of allowing adherents to be stepped on is not key. The rule should not be used where those around you let them happen or can\u2019t see it happen. And if the rule\u2019s guidance is judged too vague to follow reliably, we should look to the myriad expectations and implicit assumptions that go with it to see if they supply needed precision and clarity.\nThe golden rule is not only a distinct rationale within a family of related rationales. It is a general marker, the one explicit component in networks of more implicit rationales and specific prescriptions. Teachings that abstract the rule from its implicit corollaries and situational expectations fail to capture what the rule even says. Theoretical models of the rule that further abstract the rule\u2019s logic from its substance, content or process, likely mutilate it beyond recognition.\n\u201cHow would you feel if?\u201d puts the golden rule\u2019s peer spirit in a mother\u2019s teaching hands when urging her egocentric, but sensitive child to consider others. As a socializing device, the rule helps us identify our roles within mutually respectful and cooperating community. How well it accomplishes this socializing task is another crucial mark of its adequacy, perhaps the most crucial. The prospect of first engaging this rule typically captures childhood imaginations, like acquiring many highly useful social skills. (Fowler 1981, Kohlberg 1968, 1982)\nPutting these considerations together allows us to identify where the golden rule may be operating unnoticed as a matter of routine\u2014in families, friendships, classrooms and neighborhoods, and in hosts of informal organizations aiming to perform services in the community. Isn\u2019t it in fact typical in these interactions that we treat each other reciprocally, as each other would wish, want, choose, consent or prefer?\n3. Sibling Rules and Associated Principles\nThe foregoing appeals for feasibility are not primarily defenses of the golden rule against criticism. They are clarifications of the rule that expose misconceptions, central to its long-standing reputation. We now question, also, the much admired roles of empathy and role-taking in the golden rule, which can ease adherence to it, but are not necessary. The rule is certainly not a guideline for empathizing or role-taking process, as most believe and welcome. However, empathy can help apply the rule and the rule can provide many \u201cteaching moments\u201d for promoting and practicing empathy, which is advantageous. But distinguishing empathy from the rule\u2019s function also is fortunate for the empathetically challenged among us, and those not able to see the others\u2019 sides. Their numbers seem legion. The golden rule can be adhered to in other ways.\nThe golden rule is much-reputed for being the most culturally universal ethical tenet in human history. This suggests a golden link to human nature and its inherent aspirations. It recommends the rule as a unique standard for international understanding and cooperation\u2014noble aims, much-lauded by supporters. In support of the link, golden logic and paraphrasing has been cited in tribal and industrialized societies across the globe, from time immemorial to the present. This supposedly renders the rule immune to cultural imperialism when made standard for human rights, international law, and the spreading of western democracy and education\u2014a prospect many welcome, while others fear it. Note that if the golden rule is truly distinct from the related principles such as loving thy neighbor as thyself and feeding the poor, these cherished claims for the rule are basically debunked.\nAnalysis of this endless stream of sightings shows no more than a family resemblance among distinct rationales (See golden rule website in references below.). Some rationales deal with putting oneself in another\u2019s place, with others viewing everyone as part of one human family, or divine family. Still others promote charity, forgiveness and love for all. Culturally, the golden rule rationale is mostly confined to certain strands of the Judeo-Christian and Chinese traditions, which are broad and lasting, at least until recently, but hardly universal (See Wattles 1966).\nThe golden-rule\u2019s distinctness, here, is seen relative to its origins. The original statement of the golden rule, in the Hebrew Torah, shows a rule, not an ethical principle, much less the sort of universal principle philosophers make of it. It is one of the simpler and most briefly stated dos and don\u2019ts among long lists of particular rules in Leviticus (XIX: 10-18). These directives concern kosher eating, animal sacrifice procedures, threads that can\u2019t be used together in weaved clothing, and even the cleansing of \u201cimpurity\u201d (such as menstruation) by bringing pigeons and doves to a rabbi for ceremonial disposition. If one blinks, or one\u2019s mind wanders, one would miss it, its golden gleam notwithstanding. And even a devout Jew is likely to lose concentration when perusing these outdated, dubious and less than riveting observations.\nNo fair reading of Levitticus XIX: 18 would term its statement the golden rule, not in our modern sense, first stated in Matthew 7:12. For in Levitticus the commandment is merely not to judge an offender by his offense, and thereby hold a grudge against a fellow Jew for committing it. But love him as yourself. The latter, a crucially different principle, is meant here differently than we now interpret it as well. It perhaps can be rendered as `Remember that you offend fellow Jews also and so you are like the offender on other occasions.\u2019\nSeen amid such concrete and mutually understood practices of a small tribe, the golden rule poses no role-taking test. Any community member can comply simply by knowing which reciprocity practices are approved or frowned on. Recollecting what it was like to be on the receiving end of others\u2019 slights or benefits also can help. But that would mean taking one\u2019s own perspective, not another\u2019s, in the past. Doing so is not essential to \u201cgolden-ruling\u201d however, nor likely reliable. If a kind of imaginative role-playing is contemplated, one need only conjure up images of community elders frowning or fawning over a variety of choice options and everyday practices.\nNeither in eastern nor western traditions did the golden rule shine alone. Thus viewing and analyzing it in isolation misses the point. The golden rule\u2019s relation to sibling principles, associated altered its meaning and purpose in different settings. The most prominent standard bearer for this family of rules seems to have been, \u201cloving thy neighbor as thyself.\u201d This \u201croyal law\u201d is a very different sort of prescription from the golden rule, foreseeing a variety of extraordinarily benevolent practices born of extraordinary identification with others. In Judaism, benevolence usually meant helping family members and neighbors primarily, focusing on one\u2019s kind\u2014one\u2019s particular sect. Generosity meant hospitality to the stranger or alien as well, remembering that the Jews were once strangers in a strange land. Alms were given to the poor; crops were not gleaned from the edges of one\u2019s farm-field so that the poor might find sustenance in the remains. Farmland was to lay fallow each seventh year (like the Sabbath when God rested) so that, in part, the poor then could find rest there, and room to grow (Deuteronomy XV: 7, Leviticus XXIII: 22, XXV: 25, 35).\nTurning the other cheek (Luke 6:29), loving even one\u2019s enemy (Matthew 5:44) and not turning away when anyone asks of you (5:42)\u2014these go well beyond normal charity or benevolence, even more than identifying with our neighbor. What neighbor would strike or steal from you (taking our cloak so that you must give him your coat also (Matthew 5:40)? Such practices are not at all required or asked of the Confucian \u201cgentleman\u201d whose Kung-shu practice is more about respect for elders and ancestors, and fulfilling hosts of family and community responsibilities.\nWith regard to Yeshua\u2019s teachings on feeding the hungry, sheltering the homeless, or praying for those who shamefully use and abuse you, he summarily urged that followers \u201cbe perfect, even as your Father in Heaven is Perfect\u201d (5:48). This far exceeds what the golden rule asks\u2014simply that we consider others as comparable to us and consider our comparable impacts on them. These do not represent fair or equal reciprocity in fact. Ask how you would wish to be treated if you were a shameful abuser or even homeless person. There is sufficient testimony revealing that many abusers and homeless do not at all want to be shown charity, for example, but condemnation or punishment, in the first case, and being left alone to fend in a \u201cstreet community\u201d in the second. They feel this is what they deserve. (To abuse-counselors and homeless shelter workers, this goes without saying.) What the abusive and homeless should want, or calculate as their desert, may be something different. But golden-rule role-taking will not tell.\nThere is one area where the golden rule extends too far, directly into the path of a turning of the other cheek. When we are seriously taken advantage of or mistreated, the rule bids that we treat them well nonetheless. We are to react to unfair treatment as if it were fair treatment, ignoring the moral difference. Critics jump on this problem, as they should, because the golden rule seems designed to highlight such cases. Here is where the rule most contrasts with our typical, pre-moral reaction, while also rising above (Old Testament) justice. In the process, it promotes systematic and egregious self-victimization in the name of self-sacrifice. Yet, is self-sacrifice in the name of unfairness to be admired? Benevolence that suborns injustice, rather than adding ideals to it, seems morally questionable. Moreover, under the golden rule, both victimization and self-victimization seems endless, promoting further abuse in those who have a propensity for it. No matter how much someone takes advantage of us, we are to keep treating them well. Here the golden rule seems simply unresponsive. Its call to virtuous self-expression is fine, as is its reaction to the equal personhood of the offender. But it neither addresses the wrong being committed, nor that part of the perpetrator to be faulted and held accountable. Interpersonally, the rule calls for a bizarre response, an almost obtuse or incomprehensible one. While a \u201cforgiving\u201d response may be preferable to retribution, why should just desert be completely ignored? It can certainly be integrated into the high-road alternative. In this type of case, the golden rule sides with its infeasible siblings. It bids us to play the exemplar of \u201cnew covenant\u201d morality\u2014the morality of love for all people as people, or as children of God. And this asks too much.\nThese criticisms have merit, but can be mitigated. When dealing with cases of unfairness and abuse, critics assume the golden rule requires us to \u201ctake the pain\u201d uncomplainingly. There is no such proviso in the rule. As the Gandhi-King method has shown, it is perfectly legitimate to fault the action\u2014even condemn the action\u2014while not condemning the person, or taking revenge. The practice of abusing or taking advantage of someone does not define its author as a person after all, even when it is habitual. The wrongs anyone commits do not eradicate his good deeds, nor our potential for reform. And the golden rule has us recognize that. But the spirit of silent self-sacrifice is found more in the sibling principles than the golden rule, and should be kept there. In the current case we can readily respond to our oppressor by calling a spade a spade\u2014\u201cYou took advantage of me, I noticed.\u201d That would be a first response. \u201cYou keep taking advantage of me: that was abusive. I don\u2019t like it; it\u2019s not OK with me.\u201d The abuser responds, \u201cIt seems like you like it. Why else would you take it and respond as if it\u2019s OK?\u201d We reply, \u201cWhy should I let your abuse drag me down to your level, compounding your offence?\u201d\nThere are nice and not so nice ways to make this point. If Yeshua is our guide, not so nice approaches are acceptable. To treatment from those known as most righteous in Jerusalem, for example, he responded, \u201cWoe to you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites all..you are like whited sepulchers, all clean and fair without, and inside filled with dead man\u2019s bones and all corruption\u2026yours is a house of desolation, the home of the lizard and the spider\u2026Serpents, brood of vipers, how can any of you escape damnation?\u201d (Matthew 23:13-50 as insightfully condensed by Zefferelli.) If this be love, then it is certainly hard love, especially when we note that Yeshua faults the person here, not just the act.\nWe must also see these cases in social context to see how far the golden rule bids us go. If we are sensible, and have friends, it is unlikely we will place ourselves in the vicinity of serious abusers, or remain there. The social convention of avoiding those who hurt us also must figure into the rule\u2019s understanding. The defense our friends will put up for us against abuse must figure into the rule\u2019s feasibility as well.\nMost morally important, these abuse cases do not illustrate the golden rule\u2019s standard application\u2014quite the contrary. Fair-dealing with unfairness and abuse, in particular, call for special principles of rectification, including punishment, recompense or reform. When used in this context, without alteration, the golden rule poses an alternative to the typical ways these practices are performed. But it remains this sort of special principle. Among its aims, the rule certainly seems bent on goals like rectification, recompense and reform, but indirectly. Arguably the rule has us exemplify the right path\u2014the path the perpetrator might have taken, but did not, thus demonstrating its allure, its superiority. This includes, for observers in the community, the superiority of fairness over retribution (\u201c\u2019Vengeance is mine,\u2019 sayeth the Lord.\u201d) Teaching this lesson is aimed at raising moral consciousness, especially in the perpetrator. As such, it resembles the practice of \u201cbearing unmerited suffering\u201d in the Gandhi-King approach, aimed at piquing moral conscience in those oppressing us (King 1986).\nIdeally, a perpetrator will think better of his practice, apologizing for past wrongs and making up for them. At least it might move him to abandon this sort of practice. And if moral processes are not awakened, then at least placing the offender in a morally disadvantageous position within the group will bring pressures to bear on his behavior. Exemplifying fairness in this way also shows demonstrates putting the person first, holding his status paramount relative to his actions, and our sense of offense.\nExemplifying a moral high road, so as to edify others does not show passivity or weakness. It is normally communicated in a strong, positive pose. Standing above a vengeful or masochist temptation uplifts the supposed victim, not making him further trodden down. Indeed, its courageous spirit is key in working its effect, an effect achieved by Gandhi, King and legions of followers under the most morally hostile conditions. Aside from giving abusers pause, high-minded responses bring loud outcries of protest in one\u2019s cause from outside observers, making reform prudent, and practically necessary.\nAgain, these realities of the rule can only be seen in context, looking into the subtleties of interpersonal relating, communicated emotion, performance before a social audience and the like. The mere logic or golden principle of the thing is silent on them. The same holds for the less feasible sibling rules of the golden rule family, from giving to the poor to turning the other cheek. Trying them out makes a world of difference in understanding what they say. Consider an experiment with trying to \u201csay yes to all who ask,\u201d and substituting \u201cyes\u201d generally, where we routinely say \u201cno\u201d or \u201cmaybe.\u201d Doing so may add much less than expected to our load because, first, it makes us more interested in being kinder, which is a rewarding experience, as it turns out. Second, we find that people do not generally ask much, especially when they see you at risk of being taken advantage of for your exceptional good will. Finding simple ways to make the most needy more self-reliant\u2014such as simply encouraging them to be so\u2014also may lighten the helping load. The good it does may be exceptional.\nBut what of the lingering \u201cdoormat problem\u201d for those who are especially dependent and masochistic, all but inviting victimization from abusers? No full mitigation may be possible here. The golden rule, if not exacerbating the problem in practice, at least serves to legitimatize it. Its rationale has been exploited by many, including some Christian churches and clergy who suborn victimization as a lifestyle, especially for wives and mothers. A rule cannot be responsible for those who misuse it, or fail to grasp its purposes. But those sustaining the rule bear a responsibility to clarify its intent. It certainly would be better if the rule itself made its intentions clear or included illustrations of proper use. Currently, it relies on the chance intervention of moral teachers or service organizations\u2014those opposed to, say, domestic violence. Even Yeshua\u2019s disciples complained that the parables, supposedly illustrating tenets like the golden rule, were perplexing. Confucian writing was definitely not geared to rank and file Chinese, much less children learning their moral lessons. This is an intolerable shortfall for an egalitarian socialization tool.\nConsider a second corollary (the \u201ccopper\u201d rule?) that might address such difficulties. \u201cWhen misused by those do unto fairly, do not quietly bear the offense, instead defending and deflecting if with as much understanding as can be summoned.\u201d Notice that defending does not conflict with praying for those who shamelessly abuse us. (The \u201csummoning understanding\u201d proviso is meant to forestall reversion to a more pragmatic alternative such as \u201cby any means necessary.\u201d)\n4. Golden Role-Taking and Empathy\n\u201cPutting oneself in the other guy\u2019s place\u201d is yet another distinct principle, as is \u201cwalking a mile in the other guy\u2019s moccasins\u201d (the Navaho version). The first involves taking a perspective, the second, gaining similar life experience in an ongoing way. Notice that \u201cloving thy neighbor as thyself\u201d requires neither of these operations presuming that we know how to love ourselves and need only extend that to someone. But of course we may not know how to love ourselves, or how to do so in the right way. The same can be said with identifying, role-taking or learning from another\u2019s type of experience. Given that we may not be loving enough to ourselves, loving our neighbor is best accomplished by referring to prevailing standards. Our own proclivities or values are certainly not the final word. Just as with acting as we\u2019d have others act toward us, loving thy neighbor concerns how we\u2019re supposed to love others, as we should love ourselves. We must consult the community, its ethical conventions or scriptures (including Kantian or Utilitarian scriptures). The last word comes through a critical comparison of these conventions, in experience, with our proclivities and values.\nNeither we nor our neighbors likely think it is legitimate, or even kind, to give a thief additional portions of our property. Doing so might well be masochistic, or even egotistical, thinking about our own character development most, thereby exacerbating crime and endangering the community. If we were the thief, we might very well not think that we should be given more of a victim\u2019s property than we stole. Instead, perhaps, we might wish to steal it. Role-taking cannot guide us here. In fact, it could easily lead us astray in various misguided directions. Some would consider it ideal to be unconcerned with property because it puts spiritual concerns over materialism, or it puts charity before just desert. Others could make a case for better balancing the competing principles involved. What good does role-taking do here? And how can it work in a non-relativistic way, where everyone taking the other\u2019s role would come to a similar realization of what to do correctly? The golden rule is not meant to raise such questions.\nPhilosophers deal with these problems by standardizing the way roles are taken, the thinking that goes on in the roles, and so forth. This is what the Kantian veil of ignorance or Rawlsian (1972) original position or Habermasian (1990) ideal speech rubric is for. But surely the commonsense role-taking precepts we are talking about here do not even dream of such measures.\nPrescriptions for role-taking are likely prominent in many cultures both for the increased psychological perspective they breed and the door they open to better interpersonal interaction. The interpersonal skill involved is perhaps the best explanation of their widespread use and praise, not their power of edification. It is true that if we truly wished to treat others as ourselves, or the way we would want to be treated\u2014if we were them, not ourselves merely placed in their position\u2014role-taking would help. But it is not unusual for primarily psychological or interpersonal tools to aid ethics without being part of ethics itself.\nThe golden rule\u2019s (emotional) empathy component is as unclear as its role-taking component. To empathize is not really to take another\u2019s perspective. If we truly took that perspective, we would not have to empathize. Being in that perspective would moot an attempt to \u201cfeel with\u201d it from another (Noddings 1984, Hoffman 1987). Even if we took the perspective without the associated emotion, our task would then be to conjure up the emotion in the perspective. It would not be to \u201cfeel with\u201d anything. We\u2019d be imaginatively in the other\u2019s head and heart, imaginatively feeling their feelings directly. More, in any relevant context, the golden rule urges to think before we act, then imagine how we would feel, not how the other would. Thus any empathy involved would involve imaginatively \u201cfeeling with\u201d myself, at a future time, recipient of another\u2019s similar action. The point here is to supplant the other\u2019s perspective and imagined reaction with our own. This is not how one empathizes. Emotionally, the appropriate orientation toward causing someone possible harm is worry or foreboding. Toward the prospect of doing future good, it\u2019s anticipation of shared joy, perhaps. \u201cFeeling with\u201d or empathizing with others would be prescribed as, \u201cDo unto others in a way that brings them the likely joy you\u2019d happily share.\u201d\nConsider more closely what we are supposed to achieve from role-taking and empathy via the golden rule. We get a sense of how others are different from us, and how their situation differs from ours, uniquely tailored to their perspective and feelings on the matter. We then put ourselves in their place with these differences in tact, added on to ours, and subtracting from ours where necessary. So we occupy their perspective as them, not us, just as we\u2019d wish them to do toward us when acting. (We wouldn\u2019t want them to treat us as they\u2019d wish to be treated, but as we\u2019d wish to be treated when they took our perspective.)\nBut this already is a consequence of applying the rule, not a way of applying it. If depicted as a rule\u2019s rationale it would say, \u201cTreat others the way they\u2019d wish or choose.\u201d Seemingly the best way to do that is to ask them how they\u2019d like to be treated. If we can\u2019t ask, then perhaps we are not so much doing unto them a way as guessing what they\u2019d like. Putting oneself in their place here would not seem a good idea. Neither would empathy, as opposed to prediction. A good prediction would rest on some track record of what they\u2019ve liked in the past, perhaps acquired from a friend of theirs or one\u2019s own experience with them as a friend.\nWithout involving others, such role-taking is a unilateral affair, whether well-intended or otherwise. It is often paternalistic, choosing someone\u2019s best interest. The whole process is typically done by oneself, within one\u2019s self-perspective or ego, and it can be spun as one wishes, no checks involved. Fairer and more respectful alternatives would involve not only consulting others on their actual outlooks, but including them in our decision making. \u201cIs it OK with you if\u2026.\u201d This approach negotiation is based on a different sort of mutuality, democratizing our choices and actions so that they are multilateral.\n5. The Rule of Love: Agape and Unconditionality\nTo some, the gold in the golden rule is love, the silver component, respect. The love connection is likely made in part by confusing the golden rule with its sibling, love thy neighbor as oneself. Traditionally, ethics could have made the connection semantically\u2014it used the term \u201cself-love\u201d where we now say self-interest. This could render like interest in others as other-love. But this is not really in the spirit of unconditional love.\nA more likely path to connecting agape with the golden rule is to consider how we\u2019d ideally wish to be treated by others and most wish we could treat them in turn. Wouldn\u2019t we prefer mutual love to mere respect or toleration? This formulation has appeal though it ignores an important reality. Though we might wish to be treated ideally, we might not wish, or feel able to reciprocate in kind. Keeping mutual expectations a bit less onerous\u2014especially when they apply to strangers and possible enemies\u2014may seem more palatable.\nBut this is to think in interested and conditional terms. Agapeistic love is disinterested or indifferent, if in a lushly loving way. Its bestowal is not based on anything in particular about the person, but only that they are a person. This sufficiently qualifies them as a beloved. And agape does not come out of us as an interest we have, whether toward people, the good, or anything similar. It comes only out of love, expressing love, or the good luring us with its goodness. Our staking claim or aim toward the good as a personal goal is not involved. The same is true for self-regard. We love ourselves because we are lovable and valuable, like anyone else. The basic or essential self, the soul within us is lovable whether we happen to like and esteem ourselves or not. (Outka 1972).\nThe most obvious ethical implication of agape is that it is not socially discriminating. We do not love people because they are attractive, or hold compatible views, or work in a profession we respect. Are they friend, stranger, or opponent? It doesn\u2019t matter. Most surprising, we do not prefer those close to us or in a special relationship, including parent and child. (Children in agapeistic communities are often raised by the adults as a whole, and in separate quarters from parents, primarily inhabited by peers.)\nFor moral idealists, agape is most alluring. To love in a non-discriminating way has a certain unblemished perfection to it. Pursuing moral values simply for their value or goodness seems clearly more elevated than pursuing them out of personal preference. Loving someone because they happen to be related to us, or a friend, or could do us a favor is shown up as somewhat cheap and discriminatory by comparison. Seeing ourselves as special is revealed for the trap it is\u2014being stuck with ourselves and our self-preference, a burden to aspiration. What is this condition but the ultimate hold of ego over, binding us to all our attachments? (In philosophy, intellectual ego is a chief obstacle between us and truth, causing us to believe ourselves because we are ourselves, despite knowing that there are thinkers just as wise or wiser, with just as well-seasoned beliefs. Why be led around by the nose of our particular beliefs and interests just because they blare most loudly in our heads?)\nAgape is worth pondering as a fit purveyor of the golden rule. What could be more golden? The golden rule\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre is indeed focused on countering egocentrism and self-interest. But promoting other-directedness is its remedy, not unconditionality. And concern for others\u2019 interests is key to establishing equality as the rule directs. A plausible rendering of the golden rule, making its implicit concern for interests more visible would go, `Treat others the way you would be interested in being treated, making adjustments for their differing interests.\u2019 In these terms, unconditional loving is a bad fit. Are we really \u201cinterested\u201d in being treated as anyone should be treated regardless of the interests we identify with, as someone with a soul but no interests worth catering to? Likely not. This same lack of interest haunts Kant\u2019s notion of respecting personhood unconditionally. The golden-rule problem is not that we\u2019re failing to notice others\u2019 personhood, but what others desire or prefer. We could indeed be faulted for ignoring others as persons, treating them like potted plants in the room, but that would only result if they craved our notice, attention, or participation. Typically, it would be fine with others if we just went about our business while not getting into theirs.\nTo be told that we should not be interested, or to be dealt with by people who will not relate to us in interested terms, basically undermines the golden rule\u2019s effectiveness. As with empathy, we cannot be uninterested on demand, or even after practicing to do so long and hard. And if we do not have our self-identified interests taken seriously, we feel that we are not taken seriously, whether we ideally should or not. Ethics is not only about ideals, nor in fact, primarily about ideals. If interest were not key to ours and theirs, the golden rule would be moot. With unconditional love, reciprocity is beside the point, along with its social reciprocity conventions. Taking any perspective is the same as taking any other. In fact, taking one\u2019s own perspective in particular is discriminatory, even when expressing generosity to others. So is taking the perspective of any particular other. Happening to be ourselves, or a particular other, and taking that as a basis for favoritism, seems a condition\u2014a failure in unconditionality. I could have been anyone, any of them, as they could have been me. So why do I take who I am or who they are so seriously?. Unlike every other ethic, agape provides no basis for according ourselves special first-person discretion or privacy. The self-other gap is transcended. It\u2019s not even clear how the typical moral division of labor is justified in agapeistic terms. In principle, when we raise our spoon filled with breakfast cereal at the morning table, the matter of whose mouth it goes into is in question.\nSome agapeists would not go this far, instead keeping our self-identification intact. But there is good reason to go farther. Gandhi and King have forwarded a view of loving non-violence that doesn\u2019t even allow self-defense because it involves the preference of self over other. Gandhi characterizes personal integrity as \u201cliving life as an open book\u201d since one\u2019s life is not one\u2019s own, but merely one example of everyone\u2019s life. And of course there are the turn the other cheek precepts of Yeshua, which push in this direction.\nIn any event, ethics is not built for such concerns. It is a system designed to handle conflicts of interest, the direction of interests toward values and, perhaps, the upgrading and transformation of interests into aspirations. Agape would function, within the golden rule, as something more like a song or affirmation for the self-transformations achieved. It is the very admirable diminution or lack of self-interest, in agapeistic love and in social discrimination that puts an agapeistic golden rule out of reach. Its double dose of moral purity and perfection puts it doubly out of reach. We arguably cannot be perfect as our Father in Heaven is perfect (or complete). We also cannot realistically strive toward it, and most likely should not. Religiously, to do so seems a sacrilege\u2014pretending to the level of understanding, wisdom and \u201clovability\u201d of infinite godhood. Secularly, its beautiful intentions have unwanted consequences. Aside from the impersonality of childrearing, anyone who has borne the impersonal treatment or unearnable support from someone bent on \u201ctreating everyone the same\u201d can testify to its alienating quality. We wish to be loved for us, for our self-identity and the values we identify with. When we are not loved this way, we do not feel loved at all\u2014not loved for whom we are. Ethically, we expect to be unique, or at least special in others\u2019 eyes when we\u2019ve created a special history. We are entitled to it. We build rights around it. And we feel callously disregarded when a loving gaze shows no special glint of recognition as it surveys us among a group of others. This is less egoism than a sense of distinctness and uniqueness within the additional expectations of realized relationship.\nPutting the matter more generally, human motivational systems come individually packaged. They are hard-wired to harboring and pursuing interest. And a valid ethics is designed to serve human nature, even as it strives to improve it. If we can transcend human nature, then we need a different system of values, or perhaps nothing like an ethical system. We have risen beyond good and evil, indifferent to harm of death.. We are born, and remain psychologically individualized throughout life, not possessed of a hive mind in which we directly share our choice-making and experiences. We are each unquestionably possessed of this natural, immutable division of moral labors, which gives us direct and reliable control only of our own self. Hence we are held responsible only for our own actions, expected to do for ourselves, provided special standing to plead our own case of mistreatment, and accorded great discretion in our own individual sphere, to do as we like. When agapeistic morality puts our very nature on the spot, bidding us to recast basic motivations to suit\u2014when it sets us in lifetime struggle against ourselves\u2014it fails to acknowledge morality as our tool, not primarily our taskmaster. These considerations provide the needed boundary line to situate the golden rule this side of a feasibility-idealism divide. The golden rule is indeed designed for human nature as it is and for egos with interests, trying to be better to each other.\nAdmittedly the question of agape\u2019s realism may not be decidable given the distinctly spiritual nature of their view. Christian agape, like Buddhist indifference and non-attachment is said to be inexpressible in words. It can only be understood correctly through direct insight and experience. Granted, adherents of these ideals place the achievement of spiritual insight out of common hands. Only a few of the most gifted or fortunate adherents achieve it in a lifetime. As such, spiritual love cannot be the currency of the golden rule as we know it, negotiating mutual equality for the vast majority of humanity in everyday life.\nWhat agapeists may be onto is that the golden rule has a dual nature. At a common level, it is a principle of ethical reciprocity. But for those who use its ethic to rise above good and evil in a mundane sense, the golden rule is a wisdom principle. It marks the transcendence of interested and egoistic perspectives. It points toward its sibling of loving thy neighbor as thyself because thy neighbor is us in some deeper sense, accessible by deeper, less egoistic love.\n6. Philosophical Slight.\nWith the foregoing array of \u201cconsidered judgments\u201d in hand, we are at last positioned to begin distinct philosophizing on the golden rule. That project starts by consulting philosophy\u2019s reconstitution of traditional commonsense ethics\u2014an added context for golden rule interpretation. Philosophical treatments of the golden rule itself come next, with an evaluation of their alternative top-down approach.\nOne reason philosophers emphasize the juxtaposition of ethics and human nature stems from the moralistic, if not masochistic cast of ethical traditions. Nietzsche\u2019s depiction of \u201cslave morality\u201d in Christianity is a case in point (Nietzsche 1955). Moral suspicion of medieval shira laws in Islam is another. Because the golden rule is prominent in these suspect traditions, philosophy\u2019s concerns are directly relevant. Self-interest has been rehabilitated in philosophical ethics, along with happiness as satisfying interests, not necessarily matching ethereal ideals or god\u2019s will. Ethics in general has also been feminized to encompass self-caring as well, a kind of third-person empathy and supportive aid to oneself (Gilligan 1982). Here, a clarified golden rule notion can fit well.\nThe role of ethics as our tool and invention has been promoted over traditional views of its partial \u201cimposition\u201d by Nature, Reason or natural law. As Aristotelians note, the good for anything depends on its type or species: ethics is for \u201ccreatures like us,\u201d and because we are not saintly beings we fall short of by nature. Ironically, this a line preached by Yeshua continually in upholding spirituality, or the heart of \u201cthe law,\u201d over the legal letter. \u201cThe law (Sabbath) was made for man, not man for the law.\u201d (Mark 2:27-28) On this view, ethics should not fate its users to a life of hypocrisy and of not feeling good enough.\nFor philosophers, however, even a clarified or unbiased depiction of the golden rule cannot overcome its shortfalls in specificity and decisiveness. Ply the rule in the handling of complex and nuanced problems of complex institutions and it is at sea. We cannot imagine how to begin its application. Exercise it within networks of social roles and practices and the rule seems utterly simplistic. (This said, the irony should not be lost here of critics setting the rule up to fail by over-generalizing its intended scope and standards for success.)\nMaximum generalization is the dominant philosophical approach to the rule. And in this form there is no question that its shortfalls are many. The rule seems hopeless for dealing with highly layered institutions working through different hierarchies of status and authority. Yet the rule has been posed by philosophers as the ultimate grounding principle of the major moral-philosophic traditions\u2014of a Kantian-like categorical imperative, and a Utilitarian prototype. It has been claimed, in fact, that the rule\u2019s logic was designed for this generalization across cases, situations, and all varieties of societies (Singer (1963) and Hare (1975)).\nThese interpretations are highly unlikely judging from the rule\u2019s strikingly ethnic origin and design function, as a bottom-up approach makes clear. As noted, this is a tribal or clan rule, cast in highly traditional societies and nurtured there. There is no evidence that it was ever originally intended to define human obligations and problem solving within the human community writ large, or in complex institutional settings in particular. And so shortfalls found in taking it out of its cultural context\u2014ignoring the range of practices and roles that it presumed, placing it in types of social context that didn\u2019t exist when it was born and raised should be no surprise. The golden rule\u2019s format invites first-person use, addressing interacting with one or two others. Since the rule\u2019s chief role in society seemingly became the instruction of children, alerting them to impacts on others, its shortfalls in complex problem solving seem irrelevant. Likewise Kant\u2019s categorical imperative falls short in deciding who does the laundry in a marriage, especially once emotions have become too frayed and raw to import formulae into the discussion.\nIn small-group interactions what would normally be tolerated as diversity of opinion and practice can be legitimately identified as problematic instead. Being like-minded, most often group members have expressed commitment to common beliefs, values, and responsibilities. But more important, the rule is vastly more detailed and institutionalized here than it seems because of its guidance by established practices, conventions, and understandings. One\u2019s reputation as a group member depends on holding up one\u2019s end of approved norms, including the golden rule, lest one be considered unreliable and untrustworthy. In such contexts, one can imagine a corollary to the golden rule that would make sense: \u201cShow not consideration to him who receiveth without thought of rendering back.\u201d This seems contrary to the golden rule due to our mis-identification of the rule with sibling rationales of forgiveness and unconditional love\u2014letting others abuse and take advantage of us. Moreover, this corollary may not sanction an actual comeuppance of offenders, in violation of golden-rule spirit, functioning instead as a threat or gentle reminder of joint expectations. Such expectations are a commonly accepted part of \u201cdoing unto each other\u201d in a neighborhood or co-worker context where conventions of fairness, just desert and doing one\u2019s share go with the territory.\nMarcus Singer, in standard philosophical style, portrays the golden rule as a principle, not a rule. This is because it does not direct a specific type of action that can be morally evaluated in itself. Instead, it offers a rationale for generating such rules. Singer is a kind of \u201cfather of generalization\u201d in ethics, holding that the rationale for action of any individual in types of situations holds for any other in like situations (Singer, 1955) Singer argues further that the golden rule is a procedural principle, directing us through a process\u2014perspective-taking, either real or imaginary, for example\u2014to generate morally salient action directives.\nSinger\u2019s is the \u201cideal\u201d or top-down theoretical approach, as contrasted with our building from common sense. It starts from an abstracted logical ideal, elaborating a theory around it by tracing its logical implications. The approach is notably uninfluenced by the golden rule\u2019s 2,500 year history. Of course, philosophy need not start from the beginning when addressing a concept, nor be confined by an original intent or design or its cultural development. The argument must be that the rule\u2019s inner logic is the only active ingredient. The rest is chaff or flourish or unnecessary additives.\nIn principled form, Singer\u2019s golden \u201crule\u201d serves also as a standard for judging rules and directives for actions that impact us. The rationale of a contemplated action must adhere to the rubric of a self-other swap to pass ethical muster in the way that, say, our maxim of intentions must pass the universalization test of the Kant\u2019s categorical imperative.\nSinger\u2019s view has merit, especially in emphasizing procedure. Still, the distinction between principles and rules may not be as sharp as claimed. General rules (rules of legal evidence, for example) also can be used to derive more specific rules based on their logics; principles need not be consulted. For example: Do nice things; do nice things, anonymously for close neighbors in distress; leave breakfast bakery goods at the doorstep of a next door neighbor the morning after they attend a close relative\u2019s funeral; leave donuts and muffins on your next-door neighbor\u2019s welcome map, rewrapped in a white bag with a sedate silvery bow: leave bagels with chive cheese if they are Jewish, sfagliatelle if they are Italian. The most general rule here, \u201cDo nice things,\u201d targets a type of action that can be morally evaluated as right or wrong, but still needs a procedure for determining specific actions that fall in that category, especially at the borders. Consulting community reciprocity standards or conventions might be one. Thus, do nice things by consulting community standards would proceduralize a rule to generate more specific action directives. Again, no consultation with principles are needed.\nA great asset of Singer\u2019s view is its accent on the practical within the prescriptive essence of the rule. Most philosophical principles of ethics are explanatory, providing an ultimate ground for understanding prescriptions. These also can be used to justify moral rationales. But they are prescriptive only in the logical sense of distinguishing \u201cshoulds\u201d from \u201cwoulds\u201d or \u201cares,\u201d not the directive sense\u2014do X in way Y. Singer\u2019s take exposes the how-to or know-how of the golden rule. From here, the rule\u2019s interpersonal role in communication and explanation to others is readily derived, especially during socialization. The rule is not portrayed, then as a stationary intellectual object notched on the wall of an inquiring mind. It takes on a life for the moral community living its life.\nR. M. Hare basically places the golden rule in the company of the Kantian and Utilitarian theories, or his own \u201cuniversal prescriptivism.\u201d That is, he interprets it as a universal grounding principle, a fundamental explanatory principle\u2014for reciprocal respect. This conceives ethical theory on the model of scientific theory, especially a physical theory with its laws of nature. A highlighted purpose of Hare\u2019s account is to bring theoretical clarity and rational backing to what he sees as piecemeal intuitionist and situation-based ethics. These latter approaches typically use examples of ethical judgments that the author considers cogent, leaving the reader to agree or disagree on its intuitive appeal. Yet, Hare renders the crucial \u201cas you would have them do\u201d directive of the golden rule as both what we would \u201cwish\u201d them to do to us (before doing it) and what we are \u201cglad\u201d they did toward us (afterwards). He holds that the golden rule\u2019s logic remains constant, despite these word and tense changes. Notably, no grounding is offered for this claim\u2014for the switch from \u201cwould have\u201d to \u201cwish\u201d or \u201cglad,\u201d as if these were obviously the same ideas. Hare apparently feels that they are.\nBut wishes, choices, preferences, and feelings of gladness certainly do not seem the same thing. Choices can come from wishes, though they rarely do, and one feels glad about the results of choices, if not wishes, generally. Wishing typically has higher goals and lower expectations than wanting; it\u2019s bigger on imagination, weaker on real-world motivation. Choosing is usually endorsing and expressing a want, whether or not it expresses a preference among desired objects. None of these may auger a glad feeling, though one would hope they do, hoping also that one\u2019s choices turn out well and that their consequences please us, which they often, sadly, do not.\n7. Sticking Points\nThe greatest help that the golden rule\u2019s common sense might seek from philosophy is a conceptual analysis of the \u201cas you would have\u201d notion (Matthew 7:12). This is a tricky phrase. Rendering the rule\u2019s meaning in ways that collapses wish and want obscures important differences, as just noted. An alternative rendering is how you prefer they treat you, singling out the want that has highest priority for you in this peculiar context of mutual reciprocity, not necessarily in general. Further alternatives are treatments we would accept, or acquiesce in or consent to as opposed to actively and ideally choose or choose as most feasible. These are four quite different options. Or would we have others do unto us as we believe or expect they should treat us based on our or their value commitments and sense of entitlement? Are the expectations of just the two or three people involved to count, or count more than the so-called legitimate expectations of the community? Such interpretations can ride the rule of gold in quite different directions, led by individual tastes, group norms, or transcendent religious or philosophical principles. And we might see some of these as unfair or otherwise illegitimate.\nIn such contexts, philosophical analysis usually answers questions, clarifying differences in concepts, meanings and their implications. Hare\u2019s account may very likely compound them. I may choose, wish or want that you would treat me with great kindness and generosity, showing me an unselfish plume of altruism. But if I then was legitimately expected to reciprocate out of consistency, I might consent, agree, or acquiesce only in mutual respect or minimal fairness, at most. This is all I\u2019d willingly render to others, certainly, if they did not even render respect and fairness back. From this consent logic we move toward Kantian or social contract versions of mutual respect and a sort of rational expectation that can be widely generalized. But we move very far from the many spirits of the golden rule, wishful and ideal. We move from expanding self-regard other-directedly to hedging our bets, which makes great moral difference.\nSimilar problems of interpretation rise for the \u201cas\u201d in the related principle, love thy neighbor as thyself (Matthew 20:34). In ethical philosophy, as noted, \u201cself-love\u201d has been identified traditionally with self-interest or self-preference. In psychology, by contrast, it has been identified with self-esteem and locus of control. These are quite different orientations, setting different generalizable expectations in oneself and in others. It is not clear that generalizing self-love captures appropriate other-love. Common opinion has it that love of others should be more disinterested and charitable than love of self, or self-interest. We feel that it is fine to be hard on ourselves on occasion, but more rarely hard on others. We are our own business, but they are not. They are their own business. It seems morally appropriate to sacrifice our own interests but not those of others even when they are willing. We should not urge or perhaps even ask for such sacrifice, instead taking burdens on ourselves. Joys can be shared, but not burdens quite as much.\nWe are to be nicer, fairer, and more respectful of others than of ourselves. In fact, ethics is about treating others well, and doing so directly. To treat ourselves ethically is a kind of metaphor since only one person is involved in the exchange, and the exchange can only be indirect. We are not held blameworthy for running our self-esteem down when we think we deserve it, but we are to esteem others even when they have not earned it.\nKant, by contrast, poses equal respect for self and other, with little distinction. We are to treat humanity, whether in ourselves or others, as an end in itself and of infinite value. He also poses second-rung duties to self and other toward the pursuit of happiness\u2014a rational, and so self-expressively autonomous, approach to goods. This might be thought to raise a serious question for altruism\u2014the benefiting of others at our expense. Given duties to self and duties to others, even pertaining to the pursuit of happiness, it is not clear what the grounds would be for preferring others to oneself. Yet one would be honored as generous, the other selfish. And this is so even if we have the perfect right to act autonomously in a generous way, therefore not using ourselves as a mere means to others\u2019 happiness. Throughout his ethical works and essays on religion, however, Kant speaks of philanthropy, kindness, and generosity in praising terms without giving like credit to self-interest.\nSome would criticize this penchant for treating others better than ourselves as a Christian bias against self-interest, too often cast as selfishness. But it seems in line with the very purposes of ethics, which is how to interact with others, not oneself. In any case, Yeshua\u2019s conception of love was radically different from the traditional notion of his time as it is from our current common sense.\nMost of the population originally introduced to the golden-rule family of rules was uneducated and highly superstitious, even as most may be today. The message greets most of us in childhood. Its Christian trappings growing most, at present, in politically oppressive third-world oligarchies where (sophisticated) education is hard to come by. Likely the rule was designed for such audiences. It was designed to serve them, both as an uplifting inspiration and form of edification, raising their moral consciousness. Yet in these circumstances, the real possibility exists of conceiving the rule as, \u201cif you\u2019re willing to take it (bad treatment) you can blithely dish it out.\u201d Vengeance is also a well-respected principle tied to lex talonis. A related misinterpretation puts us in another\u2019s position with our particular interests in tact, asking ourselves what we in particular would prefer. \u201cIf I were you, do you know what I would do in that situation?\u201d Decades of research suggests that these are the interpretations most of us develop spontaneously as we are trying to figure out the golden rule and the place of its rationale in more reasoning over childhood and adolescence (Kohlberg 1982).\nWe can scoff at the obtuseness of these renderings, but even sophisticates may know less about others\u2019 perspectives than they typically assume. Many have great difficulty imagining strangers\u2019 perspectives from the inside, instead making unwarranted assumptions biased to their own preference. (Selman 1980). Otherwise well-educated and experienced folk can be remarkably unskilled at such perspective-taking tasks. Indeed, feminist psychologists demonstrate this inadequacy empirically in psychological males, especially where it involves empathy or spontaneously \u201cfeeling with\u201d others. (Hoffman 1987) (In class, when I\u2019ve fully distinguished empathy from cognitive role-taking, many of my brilliant male students confess, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever done or experienced that.\u201d) Recent empathy programs designed to stop dangerous bullying in American public schools have acknowledged the absence of empathy in many children. Schools have resorted to bringing babies into the classroom to invoke hopefully deep-seated instincts for emotional identification (or \u201cfellow-feeling\u201d) with other members of our human species (Kohlberg 1969).\nHow we properly balance empathy with cognitive role-taking is a greater sticking point, plaguing psychological females and feminist authors as much as the rest. (The balance, again, is between feeling with, and imaginatively structuring the person\u2019s conceptual space and point of view.) Such integration problems make it unclear how to follow the golden rules properly in most circumstances. And that is quite a drawback for a moral guideline, if the rule is an action guideline. We might then be advised to seek a different approach such as an interpersonal form of participatory democracy, as was previously noted.\nAgain, these are precisely the sorts of uncertainties and questions that philosophical analysis and theory is supposed to help answer by moving from common sense to uncommonly good sense. To a certain extent, Kantian and Utilitarian theory does just that, better defining the role of careful thought and estimation (reason), moral personality (the components of \u201cself\u201d and \u201cother\u201d that most count) and how these ground equal consideration. But at some point they move to considerations that serve distinctly theoretical and intellectual purposes, removed from everyday thinking and choice. Kant\u2019s \u201cneumonal self\u201d (composed of reason and free will) and the Bentham-Mill \u201cUtil-carrier\u201d (an experience processor for pleasure and pain) are not the selves or others we care about when golden-ruling. Their morally relevant qualities cannot compete in importance with our other personal features. Indeed, we cannot identify with, much less respect these one-sided, disembodied essences enough to overrule the array of motivations and personal qualities that match our sense of moral character and concern.\nThe theoretical rationality of maximizing good, even with prudence built in, is obviously extremist and over-generalized. Research in more practical-minded economics shows this clearly in coming up with concepts like \u201csatisficing\u201d (seeking enough goods in certain categories of those goods most important to us). But as philosophers say, the logics of good and reason in Utilitarianism cannot help but extend to maximization\u2014it is simply irrational, all things considered, to pursue less of a good thing when one can acquire more good at little effort. If so, then perhaps all the worse generalization and consistency, which will be avoided by being reasonable and personable. Many of us wish theory to upgrade common sense, not throw it out the window with the golden rationale in tow.\n8. Ethical Reductionism\nBoth present and likely future philosophical accounts may be unhelpful in bringing clarity to the golden rule in its own terms, rather distorting it through overgeneralization. Still, the crafting of general theory in ethics is an important project. It exposes ever deeper and broader logics underlying our common rationales, the golden rule being one. (It is important for some to review these fundamental issues for treating the golden rule philosophically.)\nRelative to a commonsense understanding of the golden rule, it is a heady conceptual experience to see this simple rule of thumb universalized\u2013inflated to epic proportions that encompass the entire blueprint for ethical virtue, reasoning, and behavior for humankind. Such is the case with Kantian and Utilitarian super-principles. To increase the complexity of the rule\u2019s implications while retaining its simplicity, transformed to theoretical elegance, is no mean trick. Paul\u2019s revelation that the golden rule is catholic achieved a like headiness in faith. Now to see that faith reinforced by the most rigorous standards of secular reasoning is quite an affirmation. It can also be recruited as a powerful ally in fending off secular criticism.\nOften we fail to recognize that extreme reductionism is the centerpiece of the mainstream general theory project. The whole point is to render the seemingly diverse logics of even conflicting moral concepts and phenomena into a single one, or perhaps two. It is very surprising to find how far a rationale can be extended to cover types of cases beyond its seeming ken\u2014to see how much the virtues of golden kindness or respect, for example, can be recast as mere components of a choice process. Character traits, as states of being, appear radically different from processes of deliberation, problem solving, and behavior after all. But the most salient psychological features of virtuous traits fade into the amoral background once the principled source of their moral relevance and legitimacy is redefined. Golden rule compassion becomes virtuous because it allows us to better consider an \u201cother\u201d as a \u201cself,\u201d not necessarily in itself, its expression, or in the good it does.\nThe project of general theory also exposes how the implications of golden rule\u2019s basic structure fall short when fully extended. Universalization reveals how the basically sound rationale of the golden rule can go unexpectedly awry at full tilt. This shows a hidden chink in its armor. But reducing principles also can overcome the skepticism of those who see the rule as a narrow slogan from the start. The rule can do much more than expected, it turns out, when its far-reaching implications are made explicit. And by exposing the rule\u2019s shortfall and flaws, we can identify the precise sorts of added components or remedies needed to complement it, thus setting back on the right path.\nThese are the two prime fruits of general theorizing, determining the full extent of a rationale\u2019s reach, before it stretches too thin, and stretching it fully and too thin to expose its failure scenarios. Universalization, in principle, reduces to absurdity in this sense.\nOutfitting the golden rule for this project in the standard way, we get \u201cAlways act so that you treat any other person, in any context, the way that you would rationally prefer and expressively choose to be treated in that context.\u201d \u201cNever treat someone in a way that would not draw their consent.\u201d (We could say \u201cwin\u201d their consent, but that seems a bit \u201ccheerleaderesque.\u201d It invites a process of lobbying that might win or lose due to arbitrary rhetorical skills and which the rule likely does not intend.) Notice that \u201cthe standard way\u201d among philosophers is simply to claim that \u201cas you would have\u201d means consent or rational preference without sufficient argument or justification. This is what philosophical research on the matter turns up.\nWhat sorts of faults are revealed by tracing out this principle\u2019s implications? One liability concerns justice. If one puts themselves in the position of someone who has done an injustice, you might reasonably conclude either that the person wishes to be punished, due to their keen sense of justice, or that they wish to be forgiven or to otherwise \u201cget out of\u201d being caught or held accountable. Wishing forgiveness, or at least to be given a second chance, has much to be said for it. And morally, getting one\u2019s just desert also makes sense. A kind of paradox results, which Christians will recall from the Parable of the Laborers in the vineyard (Matthew 20: 1-16) The rule provides a moral advantage to both punisher and perpetrator in this case. Doing what is fair is good, but using one\u2019s discretion to be forgiving is good also, perhaps better, though not obligatory\u2014a win-win situation. Looking across situations, imagining the social practices and legitimate expectations that result, social members who commit offenses will suffer the luck of the draw. The accountability mechanism of society will not establish a uniform policy of punishment or recompense. (\u201cLuckeee! You got judge X or you mugged a nice guy\u2014wish I had.\u201d)\nFor moral individualists or libertarians, this is no problem. Who can complain about getting either fair treatment or beneficial treatment? \u201cShould someone be begrudged their generosity,\u201d as the vineyard owner notes, or another their resulting windfall? We accept this discretionary arrangement in many everyday settings. But consider how two children will feel about such unequal treatment, which treats one person as if s/he deserves more, and the other less? Consider how this same sense of being mistreated and perhaps resentful will arise in most small groups of peers. \u201cWhy her, not me? Why the favoritism\u2014you value her that much more than me?\u201d The pattern for distributing costs and benefits is unequal to the equal. And that is unjust. Moral liberals will be especially offended by this result. As with many conflicts between moral camps, both sides have a point, which each side seems committed not to acknowledge. And thus far, no way of integrating these rival positions has gained general consensus.\nLike any general principle, perhaps, the golden rule also seems incapable of distinguishing general relationships and responsibilities from special ones\u2014responsibilities toward family members, communities of familiars and co-workers, not the wide world of strangers. A proper explanatory principle will allow us to derive such corollaries from its core rationale. But the golden rule falls short: it is truly a rule, not a principle. Compare it with the Utilitarian grounding principle of maximizing good. Maximizing is an ideal logic of reason. Good is an ideal of value of value. We can imagine how a most rational approach to value would promote special situations and relationships, why it would function differently there than in other situations, and why such situations and relationships have special value. Additional good results from family and friendship institutions when members treat each other as special, and especially well. The golden rule, by contrast, bids us to treat people as special when they are not, to treat strangers or enemies as we\u2019d be naturally urged to treat intimates. This is difficult at best, and not clearly a reliable way to maximizing good. It may detract from the good in fact. Also, what is the rationale for treating others as well as those closest to us? Why is showing favoritism toward our favorites a problem? The golden rule itself does not say or explain.\nIn work situations, are we to ignore who is the boss or supervisor, who is the rank-and-file employee, who is the support staff doing clerical or janitorial work? We\u2019re to be decent to all in some sense, but some we can humanely \u201corder around,\u201d set deadlines for, and some we can\u2019t.\nThese are serious problems for the golden rule. At a minimum, corollaries would have to be added to the rule explaining how roles and relationships figure in. Treat others as you would choose to be treated in the established social role you each occupy and its legitimate expectations, mother, father, or teacher to children and vice versa, spouses and friends to each other, peer co-workers, supervisor to rank-and-file employees and vice versa, and so forth. Alan Gewirth (1978) has proposed a rule in which we focus on mutual respect for our generic rights alone. This would leave all sorts of other choices to other rationales or to our discretion that the golden rule does not, placing restraints on the rule that it would not currently acknowledge.\nBoth of these alternatives have horrible consequences for the golden rule however. Rights simply do not cover enough ethical behavior to rule out forms of psychological cruelty, callousness, and interpersonal exclusion. The reciprocity they guarantee is compatible with most forms of face-to-face interaction that lack it, especially in public peer-relations such as the school or job site, but also in friendships and the family.\nWhere the ethics or ethos of a society is barbaric, and its hierarchies authoritarian, taking perspectives within roles legitimates these characteristics. How should a slave and her/his master reciprocate? How should a superior race reciprocate with members of a near sub-human race? This inequality problem is egregious also in adhering to prevailing social reciprocity-conventions applying to roles. Neither ethically skilled role-taking nor empathy can set matters right.\n9. Ill-Fitting Theory (Over-Generalizing Rules of Thumb)\nDespite its assets, there are further reasons to think that the general theory project is inappropriate for many ethical rationales, the golden rule being perhaps chief among them. Its expose of golden rule faults is more misleading than helpful. General theory assumes that the true and deeper logic of a rationale comes out through generalization, which often is not the case. This should be obvious when theorists note that a rationale cannot avoid certain far-flung implications, no matter how alien or morally outrageous they seem. This \u201cgotcha\u201d view of logical implication speaks badly for logical implication, working alone. Instead of revealing a flaw in the rule\u2019s logic, it may show implicit features of a concept or phenomenon being ignored. In the golden rule\u2019s case this might be a cultural design function being ignored meant purposely to limit the rule\u2019s generalizability and social scope. We must get the rule\u2019s actual \u201clogic\u201d straight, before generalizing it, and this cannot be done in a purely top-down theoretical manner except by creating a different rule.\nRationalist by nature, general theory also assumes that the structure or logic of the rationale is the thing, not its psychological function, emotive effect, or motivational power. The fault here is not emphasizing rational components, but failing to integrate additional components into it adequately. If the golden rule\u2019s logic is procedural, as Singer claims, then it may not serve as a general explanation in \u201cknowing-that\u201d sense, which a Kantian, Utilitarian and \u201cuniversal prescriptivism\u201d approach like Hare\u2019s ignores. And failing to provide a type of general explanation might not then be a failing.\nBesides, the golden rule is unnecessary to the general theoretical project, as Kant (1956) himself made clear in dismissing it, and in a mere footnote no less ( p. 97, 430:68). We can start with an ideal explanatory principle, ideally structured to capture the explanatory logic of equal consideration or perspective taking. There is no need to generalize from commonsense, distorting a rule designed only for commonsense purposes, in a restricted locale. A reductive account provides an explanation and understanding of one sort, exposing the essential element or active ingredient underlying an ethics\u2019 appearance. It allows us to strip bare what holds the golden rule together beneath surface content that often matters little to its substance. But this account provides neither a good explanation nor understanding of the rule as a whole, or in any element, relative to the rule\u2019s distinct meaning for its users or benefactors, nor its distinctive application in any real-life situation. \u201cI\u2019ve become so focused on getting this project done on time that I\u2019ve lost sight of these people working on it being my colleagues, indeed, my neighbors and friends, of their deserving to be treated that way.\u201d This is especially true of the implied how-tos or forms of address that make all the difference when showing respect and concern for others. How we do unto our mother or our child or our co-worker, even when their basic personhood is most at stake, requires a remarkably different form of address to convey equal consideration. Patronizing someone (a parent) in showing respect, can convey disrespect. So can failing to \u201cpatronize (a child) and thereby coming off cold and remote. These are essential moral matters, golden-rule matters, not just a matter of discretionary style.\nUnlike Kant, J. S. Mill (1961) identified the golden rule as \u201cthe complete spirit of the ethics of utility\u201d (p. 418). It apparently served as a leading light for the Utilitarian principle, despite the principle\u2019s appearance of not holding high each individual\u2019s sanctity (as a \u201cchild of god\u201d). This may seem outrageous to those who see both the golden rule and Kant\u2019s principle as vaunting this sanctity, whatever their utility to society. For them, Utilitarianism makes an ethic out of the immoral logic of \u201cends justify the means,\u201d willingly sacrificing the individual to the group\u2014or obligating us to do so. The golden rule, by contrast, asks us to consider another\u2019s equality, not sacrifice her or ourselves for group welfare.\nBut let us remember that these alleged features of utilitarianism are completely unintended, the result of outfitting its \u201cadvance the common good\u201d rationales with universality, then trying to cover all ethical bases, working alone. (Obviously modern democratic constitutions have brought advancing the common good into line with securing individual rights simply by retaining both principles in their own terms and using each to regulate the other.) Even the lush empathy of Utilitarian intent, so key to who sacrifices or willingly serves, was eventually ejected from its general theory. This is an ultimate \u201cgolden rule lost\u201d scenario, and reductionism gone wild. Many have noted how \u201ceach is to count for one\u201d seems merely inserted into the Utilitarian concept with little utilitarian basis. The golden rule spirit may be one explanation.\nThe apparent association between the golden rule and the maximizing super-principle came basically from the central role of compassion in early Utilitarian theorizing. When people become experienced with each other, recognizing common needs, hopes and fears, failures and successes, they are moved to act with mutual understanding. This increases their like-mindedness and mutual identification in turn. The resulting sense of connection nurtures increasing indifference toward the narrow desires of those concerned, whether in oneself or others. Membership in, and contribution to shared community becomes defining. This is how golden rule other-directedness and equality moves toward full mutuality in the pursuit of overall social good. And is there a more \u201cChristian spirit\u201d of charity and service available?\nLike most key tenets of ethics, the golden rule shows two major sides: one promoting fairness and individual entitlement, conceived as reciprocity; the other promoting helpfulness and generosity to the end of social welfare. Both the Kantian and Utilitarian traditions focus on only one side, furthering the great distinctions in philosophical ethics\u2014the deontology-teleology and justice-benevolence distinctions. For the general theory project, this one-sidedness is purposeful, a research tool for reductive explanation.\nThe Utilitarian, Charles Dickens, probably draped most golden-rule content and spirit over the utilitarian side in his Christmas Carol. \u201cBusiness? Mankind was my business, the common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance and benevolence were, all, my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business\u201d (p. 30). In a small way here, Dickens highlighted the direct and visible hand of Utilitarian economics in contrast to the invisible hand of Utilitarian Adam Smith and his capitalist economics\u2014a hand Dickens found quite lacking in compassion or egalitarian benefit. Dickens captured Utilitarianism\u2019s moral hell in even more strikingly golden rule terms, \u201cThe air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in restless haste, moaning as they went\u2026one old ghost cried piteously at being able to assist a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below upon a doorstep. The misery with them all was clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters, and had lost the power forever\u201d (p. 33). Arguably, the power lost was to treat those in need as one\u2019s potentially needy self should be treated. The each-is-to-count-for-one equality of the golden rule is portrayed as a proven, socially institutionalized means to social good. \u201cI have always thought of Christmas\u2026as a kind, forgiving charitable and pleasant time when men and women seem, by one consent, to open their shut-up hearts freely and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, not another race of creatures bound on other journeys\u201d (p. 9).What speech more heartily hits the golden tones of the golden rule?\n10. Know-How Theory (And Medium-Sized Rationales)\nWhat seems needed to philosophize ably about the golden rule, and its relatives are theoretical models fit for rules of thumb. These would be know-how models, defined by the conceptual work it draped around algorithms, operations, and steps in procedures for putting rules into effect. As noted, these may be psychological rules for taking certain moral points of view, rules of problem solving, negotiation, making contributions to ongoing practices, interactions, and more unilateral actions. These components would be given a context of use and interrelated in crucially different ways, with suggestions for interrelating them further. Illustrations would be provided of their application and misapplication, at high, medium, and low quality. The resulting combination would be provided overall structure and comprehensibility which would include the rationales needed to explain and justify its components. Rationales for applying the procedures would allow unique and flexible alliances among components fit for particular functions and novel situations. This would encompass the best features of the otherwise inchoate rubric of a conceptual \u201ctool-box.\u201d The illustrations would encompass the best features of philosophically upgraded ethics codes. A range of corollaries would be provided for the rules involved, the golden rule family, for example, capturing the sorts of conventional expectations and practices presumed during the rules\u2019 creation and development. These are of greatest importance to its practicality and success. And, of like importance, background frameworks would be provided for how to practice the rule, indicating the difference in orientation of the novice and expert user. How might we follow a recipe when cooking the way a chef who \u201cknows his way around the kitchen\u201d would?\nRelative to mainstream philosophical theory, this project might seem historically regressive, even anti-philosophical. It resembles a return to the most piecemeal sort of intuitionism, combined with a \u201chands-on,\u201d applied approach taken to a new clerical extreme. (Applied ethics already boasts hundreds of decision-making step procedures.) For traditional philosophers the small-scale common-sense rationales involved also may seem philosophically uninteresting. \u201cAdvancing the good\u201d may be a fine tip for everyday practice but holds little conceptual subtlety compared to \u201cmaximizing the ratio of benefits over costs across the domain of sentient beings.\u201d The unseen implications of a maximization principle provided us a new model of practical reason. Resubmitting the range of ethical concepts to it suggests that the aims and consequences of actions, combined with quality of experience, may be all that ethics comes to, personal integrity and inherent rights aside. Thus the rules of thumb discussed by Mill in his Utilitarianism were quickly deserted by philosophers for rule-utilitarianism. This built newly generalized principles into the very structure of maximization (maximize the regard for rights as inherent and inviolable), turning the pre-existing utilitarian principle (regarding rights and all else as means to social good) into a super-principle, as some term it.\nBut if one looks back at Mill\u2019s ethical writings as a whole, dropping preconceptions about general theory of utilitarianism itself, one finds ethical rules hat cross categories like deontology and teleology, working insightfully and usefully together, also by rule of thumb, not principle or intuition. There was a time when moral theorist simply dismissed intuitionist and applied theory approaches. Hare does above, Rawls did in his hallowed A Theory of Justice (1972), calling them half-theories. These theories cited piecemeal and ungrounded insights where the completing of conceptual structure was required to provide a full explanatory account. But these forward-looking theorists worked such piecemeal views into pluralist, hybrid, or eclectic theoretical forms. Rawls himself discussed \u201cmixed theories,\u201d with medium-sized principles, which he acknowledged as formidable alternatives to a general theory like his own. (See Rawls\u2019s multiple index references to intuitionism and mixed theories.) The golden rule can find a place here, a merely somewhat generalized, medium-sized or right-sized place, allowing it to function as a lived ethic, readily applicable to everyday life to several ends. There is a certain satisfaction as well to using the most ancient but enduring epigrams of ethics, such as the golden rule, to create the most cutting-edge theoretical forms.\n11. Regressive Default (Is Ancient Wisdom Out-Dated?)\nSerious innovation in ethics is a long time coming. Arguably, the golden rule has not been seriously updated in its own terms\u2014conceptually, procedurally and culturally since 500 B.C.E., or perhaps 28 C.E., despite quite radical changes in the primary groups of modern societies, and the decrease in tribal societies. Since applied and practical ethics gathered steam, ground-breaking developments like the \u201cethics of complex organizations\u201d have been few and far between. It is remarkable that moral philosophy is still focused on concepts that were contemporaries of phlogiston and \u00e9lan and vital, bile and humors. The golden rule long preceded these. Such notions were formulated and plied in an age of rampant superstition, seasoned by deep misconceptions about the nature of reality, human nature (psychology) and social organization. Modern empirical research has had difficulty finding the stable psychological traits that we continue to call virtues. If stable traits exist at all, they may not be organized morally. If they are, their stability and supposed resistance to situational factors of morality appears remarkably weak (Kohlberg 1982a, Myers, chs. 4, 6-9, 12). But philosophers have given hardly a thought to the real prospect that there may be no such things\u2014no real phenomena to cover our grab-bag folk terms. Virtue theorists seem unparsed as they experience a philosophical upswing. Brain research has uncovered forms of mental computation that differ significantly from what we term reasoning or emotion. This should be producing experimental revamping of ethical thinking. Unfortunately, a raft of hasty interpretations of these findings\u2019 significance (by J. Haidt, primarily) have provided grounds for undue skepticism.\nThe golden rule enjoys the reputation of enduring wisdom, even if its lack of conceptual sophistication leaves philosophers cold. But its ancient origin should make us wonder if it is in fact perennial hot air, misleading even regarding the framework in which moral philosophy is done.\nThe model of general theory, based on general laws, still enjoys mainstream status in moral philosophy, despite challenges that have diminished its domination. But consider what has happened to its scientific mentor. Important new innovations in physics are questioning the use of general theories marked by laws of nature, gravity, and the like, holding that this centerpiece of physics for centuries was a wrong turn from the beginning that led to the dead end of string theory and an inability to understand quarks and quantum mechanics. Unthinkably regressive anthropomorphic alternatives, such as \u201cbiocentric cosmology,\u201d are being taken seriously, or at least stated boldly before a scientific public. (This is the view that reality is determined by our observing it\u2014a giant step beyond the Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cat Paradox.) In part, this results from challenging the value of sophistication in views like string theory that consider it explanatory to posit non-existent and unknowable scores of reality dimensions for realities we observe. More, these cutting-edge, potentially revolutionary ideas are being proliferated in high-level physics in such popular outlets as Discover Magazine (April 2010 p. 32-44, May p. 52-55) and the Discovery TV Channel, available with \u201cbasic cable.\u201d\nWhere are the parallels in ethics? Where are the steps beyond \u201csubverting the dominant paradigm,\u201d and posing real alternatives for public consumption where ethics meets reality, where the golden rule abides today? Currently, moral philosophy floods its public with an unstoppable stream of \u201ctheory and practice\u201d texts championing Kantian deontology and Utilitarian teleology, with the supposedly direct application of their super-principles to concrete cases. (There is nothing like a fundamental explanation to decide an issue and take specific action, is there?) This is especially so when a reader need only follow the philosophical author\u2019s advice to \u201cbalance\u201d these two great and conflicting principles in application and practice, as philosophers have been unable to do for centuries. A chapter is always devoted to ancient \u201cvirtue ethics\u201d in these volumes despite no one apparently knowing how to apply moral traits or character to anything concrete, in any concrete way.\nBefore a rule like the golden one is either slighted or acknowledged, moral philosophy should consider innovative approaches to conceiving such rules, their fitness to current practice, and perhaps what we can learn from converting the rule to a programmable algorithm for autonomous agent programming. Perhaps simply \u201cgeneralization\u201d the rule, as anciently stated is not the most creative theorizing approach. A possible step in a new direction, if originated in more than century-old thinking, is attempted below.\n12. When Is a Rule Not a Rule, but a Description?\nIn classic lectures, compiled as The Varieties of Religious Experience (1901/1985) William James declares the golden rule incompatible with human nature (Lect. 11). It routinely violates the basic structure of human embodiment, the laws of human motivation, and the principles of rational choice of behavior based on them, as depicted above. (James may have confused the rule with sibling principles when making this blanket observation.)\nYet, gathered around this law-like \u201cgiven,\u201d in James\u2019s remarks are reams of psychological testimony on putative \u201cconversion\u201d and \u201cvisitation\u201d experiences wrought by divinities (Lect. 9-12). James identifies certain common features and aftereffects in these putatively supernatural experiences, including ecstatic happiness and sense of liberation, expansive sense of self, and a self-diffusion into those nearby\u2013selflessness of a special, merging sort. He notes, likewise, an overflowing urge to love, give and aid others, nurture and support unlimited others, with unlimited energy, and no sense of sacrifice to oneself. The main attitude observed is \u201cyea-saying\u201d toward everything, reminiscent of Christian calls for \u201csaying yes\u201d to God and \u201cto all who ask of ye\u201d (Lect. 11).This syndrome of experiences and proclivities gives new meaning for its \u201cpatients\u201d to what a devoted and dedicated life can be\u2014not devotion to religious duties or divine commands, but the spontaneous embodiment of omnipresent love..\nMystical experience of this sort typically bridges the complete separation between perfect Godhood and sinful devotee, substituting a sense of oneness and \u201cflow\u201d within a cosmic ocean of bliss. James cites ways in which the lasting sensibilities of this experience suborn the asceticism, spiritual purity, and willing material poverty associated with saintliness (Lect. 11). In a certain way, James goes on to provide a differential diagnosis of this syndrome of symptoms or \u201cgolden rule effect.\u201d The cause he infers is some sort of seizure\u2014literally, a seizure\u2014suggesting occult influences, unusual electro-chemical processes within the central nervous system, or both. James notes that when subjected by him to certain \u201cethers,\u201d known for hallucinogenic effects, those who report these divine visitations also report a strikingly similar experience \u201cunder the influence.\u201d All that is missing is a sense of the supernatural. This is not the most morally reassuring depiction of the golden rule as a phenomenon, but so it goes.\nImagine now that there are a third and fourth avenue to these experiences or to the proclivities and golden behaviors that result. One, the third, might involve the secular spiritual transformation that comes from single-mindedness. When someone\u2019s striving for a cherished goal becomes a life-mission, be it mastering a musical instrument or fine art, or putting heart and soul into building a business, or putting a public policy in place (a new drunk-driving ban or universal health care) they often come to embody their goal. \u201cHe is his company.\u201d \u201cShe has become her music\u201d (\u201cand she writes the songs\u201d). Certainly in religion this is what is meant by terming someone holy or a living saint. This is also the secular goal of Confucian practice, to make li (behavioral ritual) yi (character). One accomplishes this transformation by complete and intense concentration of thoughts and behavior, and by \u201cletting go\u201d of one\u2019s self-awareness or ego in the task. The work takes over and one becomes \u201cpossessed\u201d by it, either in an uplifting way, or as in the need for exorcism, rehab, or at least \u201cintervention\u201d by friends and family. When morality sets the goal and means here, we term their culmination \u201cmoral exemplarism.\u201d\nThis is the indirect pursuit of the golden rule that focuses on ideally good means to ideally good ends. \u201cLove the good with your whole mind, your whole heart and your whole strength,\u201d then you will love your neighbor as yourself, and also treat her as you\u2019d wish to be treated by her. The differential diagnosis here identifies devotion that leads to embodiment as the cause of golden rule effect. And this devotion need not include any following or practicing rules of thumb like the golden rule, purposely fulfilling duties, or practicing those conventional activities associated with being morally upright. It can be as spiritual and abstract an activity as concentrated rational intuition ever-intent on an imagined Platonic form of good, which presumably would direct one\u2019s perception of every reflection of the Form, in every ethical matter one dealt with in life.\nNow consider a fourth avenue, much more common to everyday ethics. Here, doing good or being fair is a part-time activity, undertaken alongside hosts of alternatives. It is developed through socialization and reflective practice relative to the normative institutions of society. Social norms are internalized and habituated in action, even to the point of what we call character traits. When dealing with others, and typical moral issues, we gain a sense of proper reciprocity and the need for a certain egalitarianism in how we show respect. In addition, we hear of various rules and principles advising us on how to do this. Among these are members of the golden rule family, perhaps the golden rule itself. One flirts with following those rules of thumb within reach, the way one finds oneself tempted to buy a product one sees advertised. One notices ways that one\u2019s activities already overlap with their biddings. And slowly the rule becomes a partial habit of heart and hand, an implicit directive.\nStill, the rule is sometimes consciously referred to as a reminder. Like breathing, that is, the rule has an involuntary and voluntary component in one\u2019s life. Other rules seem reachable somewhere down the road and may slowly become an ideal to work toward, walking a mile in others\u2019 moccasins perhaps, while an additional class of rules only gets our salute from afar\u2014it is wildly out of reach. \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself\u201d seems in this class, along with, \u201cturn the other cheek\u201d or \u201cgive others anything they ask.\u201d\nGetting some perspective, the second and third avenues or \u201cways of embodiment\u201d above are analogous to the two main schools of Zen Buddhism\u2014Rinzai and Soto. In the first, one experiences satori or enlightened awakening in a sudden flash. It is not known how, even a non-devotee may be blessed by this occurrence. One smiles, or laughs as a result, at the contrast in consciousness, then goes back to one\u2019s daily life with no self-awareness of the whole new sense of reality and living it creates. Those around cannot help but notice the whole new range of behaviors that come out, filled with the compassion of a bodhisattva. To the master, it is daily life and interaction: \u201cI eat when I am hungry, I sleep when I am tired.\u201d\nThe third way is that of gradual enlightenment. One meditates for its own sake, with no special aim in mind\u2014no awaited lightning strike from the blue. \u201cOver time, as one constantly \u201cpolishes one\u2019s mirror,\u201d Zen consciousness continually grows until normal consciousness and ego fade out, akin to the Hindu version of enlightenment or moksha. Compassion grows beside it, imperceptibly, until one is bodhisattva. To the recipient, Zen-mind seems ordinary mind.\nThe fourth way, is more a simulation than a \u201cway.\u201d It is not a form of embodiment at all, and therefore does not generate golden rule effect as a spontaneous offshoot. We learn to act, in some respects, as a master or exemplar would, but without embodying the character being expressed, or being truly self-expressive in our actions. What we call ethics as a whole\u2014the ethics of duties, fulfilling obligations, adhering to responsibilities, and respecting rights can be seen as this sort of partial simulation. We develop moral habits, of course, some of which link together in patterns and proclivities. And we can \u201cengage\u201d these. But we would not continue to carry around a sense of ethical assembly instructions or recipes needing sometimes to refer to them directly\u2014if we were ethics, if we embodied ethics. We don\u2019t retain rules and instructions when we are friends or parents. (Those who read parenting books are either looking for improvements or fearing that they aren\u2019t true parents yet.) Where else in our daily lives do we look to principles, rules of thumb or formula supplied as advice by a colleague or co-worker to proceed at what we already supposedly can do? When we are a worker, we just work. When we are ethical, we often pause and consult a manual. This is not to deny automaticity or self-reliant reasoning in ethics.\nThe golden rule displays one algorithm for programming exemplary fair behavior, which can be habituated by repetition and even raised to an art by practice. Virtue ethics (habits) and deliberation ethics (normative ethics) fall here. What we are simulating are side-effects of a moral condition. We are trying to be good, by imitating symptoms of being good.\nA behavioral route can be taken instead to these simulations, side-stepping direct reference to the rule. In some ways it is more revealing of our simulation. Here we engage in repetitive behaviors that conform to a reciprocity convention that conforms to the rule. We do not act out of adherence to the rule, but only out or imitation of its applications or illustrations. This again was the Aristotelian approach to learning virtues and also the Confucian approach for starting out. In Japan, this sort of approach extended from the Samurai tea ceremony to the Suzuki method of learning the violin (See Gardner 1993). Such programming is akin to behavioral shaping in behaviorist psychology though it rests primarily on principles of competence motivation, not positive and negative reinforcement.\nSocial psychology has discovered that the single best way to create or change inner attitudes and motivations is to act as if one already possessed them. Over time, through the psychology of cognitive dissonance reduction, aided by an apparent consistency process in the brain, the mind supplies the motivation needed (Festinger 1957, Van Veen, and others, 2009). These processes contradict common opinion on how motivations are developed, or at least it does so long as our resolve does. Unless one keeps the behavior going, by whatever means, our psychology will extinguish the behavior for its lack of a motivational correlate.\nHere, as elsewhere, the golden rule can act as a conceptual test of whether the group reciprocity conventions of a society are ethically up to snuff. As a means to more morally direct simulation, those interested in the golden rule can try alternative psychological regimens\u2014role-taking is one, empathy might be another. And these can be combined. Those who assume that exemplars must have taken these routes in their socialization may prefer such practices to conventional repetition. However, each is discretionary and but one practical means to it. Each has pros and cons: some routes serve certain personality types or learning styles, others not so well. In certain cultures, mentoring, mimicking and emulating exemplars will be the way to go.\nDeep Thoughts: Perhaps one can also try the way of humor: \u201cBefore you insult a man, walk a mile in his shoes. That way you\u2019ll be a mile away when he gets offended, and you\u2019ll have his shoes.\u201d\u2014John Handy\n13. References and Further Reading\n- Allen, C.

      "text": "Current Artificial intelligence development resembles a high-stakes race between tech giants. But Switzerland has chosen a different path. The Swiss AI Initiative's forthcoming large language model represents more than just another technological milestone, it embodies a transformative vision of how AI can be systematically designed, deployed and governed to serve humanity's highest aspirations.\nThe Swiss Approach: Public Infrastructure For Public Good\nETH Zurich and EPFL announced in July 2025 that they will release a groundbreaking large language model developed entirely on public infrastructure. Trained on the \"Alps\" supercomputer at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre the new LLM marks a milestone in open-source AI and multilingual excellence.\nThis 70-billion parameter model, scheduled for release in late summer 2025, represents a radical departure from the proprietary, closed-source models that dominate today's AI landscape. The model represents a significant milestone in open AI development, offering multilingual fluency in over 1,000 languages and dialects.\nThe initiative emerged from the Swiss National AI Institute, created in October 2024 by ETH Zurich and EPFL to provide a long-term and national perspective on AI-based research, education and innovation. Rather than pursuing general-purpose models that compete with ChatGPT, Switzerland aims to develop large language models for specific applications in fields such as science, education, healthcare, robotics and climate studies.\nThe ProSocial AI Framework: 4 T's For Transformative Technology\nThe Swiss model exemplifies what scholars and practitioners call ProSocial AI \u2014 a comprehensive methodology to ensure artificial intelligence serves as a catalyst for human flourishing and planetary well-being. ProSocial AI offers principles for the design, deployment and governance of an approach that results in AI systems that are deliberately tailored, trained, tested and targeted to uplift people and planet. It represents more than mere ethical guidelines; it's a strategic reimagining of AI's role in society.\nThe ProSocial AI methodology centers on 4T's framework \u2014 Tailored, Trained, Tested, and Targeted \u2014 which are embodied by Switzerland's initiative. Let's examine how each principle manifests in this project:\nTailored: Precision Over Generalization\nUnlike generic AI models designed for broad consumer use, Switzerland's approach prioritizes specialized applications. The Swiss model is tailored to excel in domains where the country has established expertise and where AI can deliver maximum societal benefit. This targeted approach ensures that computational resources and research efforts focus on solving real-world problems rather than creating yet another general-purpose chatbot.\nThe multilingual capabilities spanning over 1,000 languages reflect Switzerland's commitment to inclusivity and global accessibility. By prioritizing linguistic diversity, the model ensures that AI benefits extend beyond dominant languages to serve marginalized communities worldwide.\nTrained: Ethical Data And Transparent Processes\nThe Swiss model's training on public infrastructure represents a fundamental shift toward transparency and accountability. Unlike proprietary models trained on undisclosed datasets, this initiative emphasizes open processes that can be scrutinized, validated and improved by the global research community.\nThis approach addresses critical concerns about AI bias, data quality and algorithmic transparency. By making the training process public, Switzerland enables other nations and institutions to learn from, replicate and improve upon their methodology.\nTested: Rigorous Evaluation For Real-World Impact\nProSocial AI demands rigorous testing not just for technical performance but for societal impact. AI must be tailored to specific needs, trained on diverse data to reduce bias, tested for ethical performance and targeted at solving measurable societal challenges. Switzerland's focus on scientific, educational and healthcare applications ensures that the model undergoes domain-specific validation in areas where accuracy and reliability are paramount.\nThe public nature of the project enables independent researchers to conduct comprehensive evaluations, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and accountability that private initiatives often lack.\nTargeted: Strategic Focus On Societal Challenges\nRather than pursuing AI for its own sake, Switzerland's initiative targets specific societal challenges where AI can make a measurable difference. The focus on science, education, healthcare, robotics and climate studies reflects a strategic alignment with global priorities and Switzerland's national strengths.\nThis targeted approach ensures that AI development serves clear societal purposes rather than merely advancing technological capabilities. By prioritizing ethics, sustainability, and inclusivity, ProSocial AI ensures that AI becomes a forceful tool for fostering long-term health for individuals, communities, and the planet.\nA Model For Global Collaboration\nAs of February 2025 Switzerland had no dedicated AI laws. Rather than a comprehensive approach to AI regulation, Switzerland is taking a tailored approach, focusing on implementing the Council of Europe's AI Convention and making targeted adjustments to existing laws. Instead of a Swiss equivalent of the EU AI Act, Switzerland is focusing on sector-specific adjustments and non-binding measures to promote responsible AI practices. By developing AI on public infrastructure and releasing it as open-source, Switzerland demonstrates that nations can maintain technological sovereignty while contributing to global knowledge commons. Their LLM initiative also signals a shift toward more collaborative and transparent AI development.\nThis model stands in stark contrast to the diverse regulatory approaches emerging globally.\nThe European Union has implemented the EU AI Act, which entered into force on 1 August 2024 and will be fully applicable on 2 August 2026. The EU's risk-based approach bans applications that create unacceptable risk, such as government-run social scoring of the type used in China, while subjecting high-risk applications to specific legal requirements. Meanwhile, China focuses on state control and AI ethics, while the US relies on a market-driven approach, lacking federal oversight but allowing state-level AI regulations. Singapore offers yet another model with the ambition that decisions made by AI should be explainable, transparent and fair. Their GenAI Framework is the first step towards fostering a trusted ecosystem for generative AI.\nSwitzerland's approach is particularly relevant as nations worldwide grapple with these varied AI governance challenges. The AI dilemma (balancing safety with innovation) is universal, yet each jurisdiction pursues unique solutions. The new model aligns with the EU framework while maintaining its commitment to innovation and openness, potentially offering a middle path that combines regulatory rigor with collaborative development.\nPractical Takeaways: 4 A\u2019s For Global Implementation\nProSocial artificial intelligence is a transformative approach aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. It advocates for AI systems centered on human values, equity, and global cooperation. And the Swiss AI Initiative offers valuable lessons for citizens and leaders worldwide in that pursuit. 4 A\u2019s can help citizens to start implementing ProSocial AI principles even if they do not live in Switzerland:\nAssess: Evaluate Current AI Landscape\nExamine the AI tools you use daily. Questions worth exploring: Are they transparent about their training data and decision-making processes? Do they reflect diverse perspectives and values? How much control do you have over the AI systems that affect your daily life, and what are the implications of relying on foreign, proprietary AI platforms?\nAdapt: Develop Context-Specific Strategies\nSupport organizations and initiatives that prioritize open-source AI development and transparent governance. Explore opportunities to advocate for AI literacy programs in your communities. Look for ways to support public AI infrastructure and research capabilities in your region, perhaps by backing initiatives that focus on specific domains where your community has expertise rather than competing directly with tech giants.\nAct: Implement ProSocial AI Principles\nExplore possibilities to support policies that require transparency in AI systems that affect public welfare. Advocate for legal frameworks that incorporate the 4 T's approach for AI systems used in public services. Support international partnerships for sharing AI research and best practices, following Switzerland's example of contributing to global knowledge commons.\nAspire: Embrace Long-Term Vision\nRecognize that AI development is a collective endeavor where public awareness and engagement can shape outcomes. Small actions \u2014 from choosing transparent AI tools to supporting open-source initiatives \u2014 contribute to a broader movement toward beneficial AI. Remember that the most sustainable AI strategies may emerge from collaboration rather than competition. Switzerland's approach suggests that communities can maintain technological sovereignty while contributing to shared global knowledge.\nSwitzerland's AI for Public Good initiative represents more than a technological achievement; it offers one possible roadmap for how communities might harness artificial intelligence to serve broader human aspirations. By exploring the ProSocial AI framework and the 4T's methodology, citizens worldwide can consider how AI development might serve not just economic interests but the broader goals of human flourishing and planetary well-being.\nThe Swiss model suggests that in the age of artificial intelligence, sustainable competitive advantage may come less from having the largest AI model than from having the most thoughtful, transparent, and socially beneficial one. As we navigate an AI-transformed world, Switzerland's approach offers one example of how technology might be developed as a force for good \u2014 if we choose to pursue that path."

      "text": "We have come to a remarkable moment in human history. On one side, artificial intelligence promises to revolutionize how we understand and interact among each other and with our environment. On the other, we face what scientists call the \"Great Acceleration\", a period where human activity has pushed six of nine planetary boundaries beyond safe limits, including climate change, biodiversity loss and biogeochemical flows, threatening the very foundations of life on Earth.\nBut what if these two realities aren't opposing forces? What if AI, guided by the right human intentions, could help us write a new chapter where technology and nature exist in harmony rather than conflict?\nThe Planetary Health Imperative\nA recent commentary in The Lancet makes a compelling case for connecting planetary boundaries with planetary health, the understanding that human wellbeing depends entirely on Earth's natural systems. The authors argue that destabilizing our planet's life-support systems fundamentally threatens human health in ways we're only beginning to understand, with health impacts occurring even before planetary boundaries are transgressed.\nFour cornerstones are proposed for integration: recognizing that Earth system destabilization threatens human health, centering justice for vulnerable populations, accounting for true costs and benefits of environmental policies, and developing integrated science communication to build broader support for change. Critically, each planetary boundary requires comprehensive health risk assessment, something that demands permanent platforms for transdisciplinary collaboration between Earth system scientists, health researchers and affected communities.\nConsider the interconnected web, much like the World Wide Web itself, where each strand is linked to another: climate change affects food security, which influences migration patterns, and in turn, impacts mental health and social stability. Novel chemicals alter hormone systems, while biodiversity loss weakens nature\u2019s ability to regulate diseases. Ocean acidification threatens protein sources for billions. Each boundary crossed sends a ripple through this vast, complex system, much like how a single change on one webpage can ripple across the entire internet.\nWithin this reality lies an opportunity. The very systems thinking that allows us to trace these connections also points toward solutions. This is where AI's potential becomes truly interesting \u2014 it functions as the network\u2019s protocol, capable of navigating and optimizing these connections, finding solutions faster and more efficiently \u2013 and helping us restore balance to the web that sustains us.\nMinds Behind Machines\nThe neuralgic feature is that AI is not neutral. It amplifies human values, priorities and ways of thinking. If humankind continues to allow the approach to AI development to be dominated by extractive mindsets, viewing nature as a resource to be optimized and controlled, we'll create systems that perpetuate our current trajectory toward planetary collapse.\nBut if we can find the way to make a conscious effort to ground AI development in what Indigenous wisdom has long understood; that human and planetary health are inseparable, we open possibilities for genuinely transformative technology.\nThis shift requires what the Lancet commentary calls \"overcoming the root causes of the intertwined environmental, health, and justice crises\" by \"changing the mindsets that created them and embracing the interconnectedness of all people and nature.\"\nAI As Nature's Ally\nImagine AI systems designed with this ecological wisdom at their core. Instead of maximizing short-term profits, they could optimize for long-term planetary health. Instead of treating symptoms, they could address root causes of environmental degradation.\nWe're already seeing glimpses of this potential. AI is helping restore degraded ecosystems by analyzing satellite imagery to identify optimal reforestation sites. It's revolutionizing agriculture by enabling precision farming that uses fewer resources while maintaining yields. Climate models powered by machine learning are providing surprising insights into Earth system dynamics.\nBut the real transformation can happen only when we scale this thinking and recognize the co-benefits that emerge when we align technology with planetary health. The Lancet commentary emphasizes that policies to mitigate Earth system destabilization often have immediate and long-term health benefits, making them more compelling and cost-efficient. Picture AI systems that can:\n- Build circular economy networks, where waste is eliminated because one industry\u2019s leftovers are used by another.\n- Design cities to work like nature, where energy, water, and materials are reused in closed loops\n- Help countries to work together on climate action by showing win-win solutions for environmental and human health.\n- Create permanent platforms where scientists, health experts, and communities can work together to tackle planetary health risks.\n- Make environmental data and decision-making tools open and accessible so local communities can better protect nature.\nThe Shadow Side We Cannot Ignore\nStill \u2013 we must also confront the paradox of using AI to support planetary health: AI's current trajectory is accelerating the very problems it could help solve. Data centers accounted for roughly 1.5% of global electricity consumption in 2024, and this amount is expected to double by 2030 because of AI use.\nThe numbers are staggering. AI-specific servers in data centers are estimated to have used between 53 and 76 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2024, enough to power more than 7.2 million US homes for a year. Water consumption is equally concerning: Google's water consumption jumped 20% in 2024, while data centers in the United States use about 7,100 liters of water for each megawatt-hour of energy they consume \u2013 that\u2019s enough to run 70 loads of laundry in an average washing machine\nThe land footprint is expanding rapidly too. Companies have leased nearly 3 gigawatts of data-center capacity in North America in the first half of 2024, which is up from 1.4 gigawatts in the first half of 2023. Combined investments from Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, and Apple alone will exceed $450 billion in 2025. Types of energy production that had been discontinued in many places, from coal to nuclear energy are being brought back to satisfy the gigantic energy appetite of our growing artificial treasure chest.\nThis isn't sustainable. If we continue on this path, AI will become a major driver of environmental degradation rather than a solution to it. And here we have answers already. We urgently need to steer AI development deliberately, not only toward efficiency but people and planet-oriented responsibility. This means investing in renewable energy to power data centers, building AI models that require less energy and water, and enforcing stricter corporate environmental performance standards that preserve livelihoods and ecosystems. ProSocial AI is proplanetary AI and vice-versa.\nBut none of this will happen without serious governance reforms. Governments, regulators, and international bodies must step in to set clear environmental limits on AI development and hold tech companies accountable. With the right rules and incentives in place, AI can reduce its own footprint while accelerating solutions for planetary health\u2014instead of becoming a driver of further harm.\nThe Justice Imperative\nJustice is central to the planetary health approach. Environmental changes impact everyone, but they disproportionately weigh on future generations, Indigenous peoples and already marginalized communities. Differently put \u2013 those who contributed least to the problems are the ones who bear the biggest burden. It is time to address this lack of justice \u2013 and absence of logic.\nThe same lack of fairness applies to AI development. We cannot create prosocial AI \u2013 AI systems that are tailored, trained, tested and targeted to bring out the best in and for people and planet, without including the voices and needs of those most affected by both environmental degradation and technological change. This means involving diverse communities in AI governance, ensuring equitable access to AI benefits and designing systems that strengthen rather than undermine local autonomy and traditional knowledge.\nA Planetary Framework For Transformation\nMoving forward requires a holistic understanding of humanity\u2019s relationship with nature, and the planet. It is time for a large-scale approach to cultivate individual and institutional understanding of what's at stake \u2013 and mobilize action. In this endeavor we also need a new narrative that positions AI not as humanity's replacement but as our partner in planetary healing.\nThe path forward can be summarized in the acronym PLANET:\nPrioritize regenerative design, Build AI systems that restore rather than deplete natural systems, starting with dramatically reducing the energy and resource footprint of AI infrastructure itself.\nLead with justice, Center equity and community voice in AI development, ensuring that technological solutions strengthen rather than undermine local autonomy and traditional knowledge.\nAlign with nature's wisdom, Design AI systems that mimic natural processes: circular, adaptive, resilient, and focused on long-term stability rather than short-term optimization.\nNavigate complexity, Use AI's pattern recognition capabilities to understand and work with Earth's interconnected systems rather than trying to control them.\nEngage communities, Make AI development a participatory process that includes diverse voices, especially those most affected by environmental and technological change.\nTransform systems, Use AI to enable fundamental shifts in how we organize food, energy, transportation and economic systems around planetary health principles.\nThe Triple Promise Of Prosocial AI\nWe stand at a threshold where AI could become humanity's most loyal ally in planetary healing, but only if we understand what \"prosocial AI\" truly means. It's not just about making AI more helpful or ethical. It's about creating technology that is simultaneously pro-people, pro-planet, and pro-potential.\nPro-people means AI that strengthens communities rather than displacing them, that amplifies human wisdom rather than replacing it, and that ensures the benefits of technological advancement flow to those who need them most, not just those who can afford them.\nPro-planet means AI systems designed within ecological limits, that regenerate rather than degrade natural systems, and that treat Earth's boundaries not as constraints to overcome but as the fundamental parameters for sustainable innovation.\nPro-potential means AI that unlocks humanity's capacity for collective intelligence, creativity, and cooperation \u2014 helping us imagine and build futures we couldn't create alone.\nA commitment to prosocial AI could awaken our collective potential as Earth's conscious participants rather than its unconscious destroyers.\nA Regenerative Future Awaits\nImagine waking up fifty years from now in a world where AI has helped deliver the greatest regeneration in human history. Cities breathe like forests. Oceans teem with life. The climate has stabilized. Communities thrive in diversity and dignity. Technology serves life, not the other way around.\nThis isn't utopian fantasy \u2014 it's entirely possible with the tools we have today, guided by the wisdom we've always had. The question isn't whether we can build this future, but whether we'll choose to.\nEvery line of code written, every algorithm trained, every AI system deployed is a vote for the kind of world we want to create. We can continue down the path of extraction and acceleration, or we can choose regeneration and wisdom.\nThe Earth is waiting. The technology is ready. The only question left is: are we?\nThe future isn't something that happens to us \u2014 it's something we co-create, one choice after another. And right now, we have the chance to get it right.\nNot just for the planet. Not just for people. But for the boundless potential that emerges when technology and nature move together in planetary harmony."

The Index aims to strengthen incentives for responsible AI development and to close the gap between safety commitments and real-world actions. The Summer 2025 version of the Index evaluates seven leading AI companies on an improved set of 33 indicators of responsible AI development and deployment practices, spanning six critical domains.\nData Collection: Evidence was gathered between March 24 and June 24, 2025 through systematic desk research and a targeted company survey. We prioritized official materials released by the companies about their AI systems and risk management practices, while also incorporating external safety benchmarks, credible media reports, and independent research. To address transparency gaps in the industry, we distributed a 34-question survey on May 28 (which was due on June 17) focusing on areas where public disclosure remains limited\u2014particularly whistleblowing policies, third-party model evaluations, and internal AI deployment practices.\nExpert Evaluation: An independent panel of distinguished AI scientists and governance experts evaluated the collection of evidence between June 24 and July 9, 2025. Panel members were selected for their domain expertise and absence of conflicts of interest.\nEach expert assigned letter grades (A+ to F) per domain to each of the companies. These grades were based on a set of fixed performance standards. Experts also gave each grade a brief written justification, and gave each company specific recommendations for improvement. Reviewers had full flexibility to weight the various indicators according to their judgment. Not every reviewer graded every domain, but experts were invited to score domains relevant to their area of expertise. Final scores were calculated by averaging all expert grades within each domain, with overall company grades representing the unweighted average across all six domains. Individual reviewer grades remain confidential to ensure candid assessment.\nContact\nFor feedback and corrections on the Safety Index, potential collaborations, or other enquiries relating to the AI Safety Index, please contact: policy@futureoflife.org"

      "text": "Adam Raine was just 16 when he started using ChatGPT for help with his homework. While his initial prompts to the AI chatbot were about subjects like geometry and chemistry \u2013 questions like: \u201cWhat does it mean in geometry if it says Ry=1\u201d \u2013 in just a matter of months he began asking about more personal topics.\n\u201cWhy is it that I have no happiness, I feel loneliness, perpetual boredom anxiety and loss yet I don\u2019t feel depression, I feel no emotion regarding sadness,\u201d he asked ChatGPT in the fall of 2024.\nInstead of urging Raine to seek mental health help, ChatGPT asked the teen whether he wanted to explore his feelings more, explaining the idea of emotional numbness to him. That was the start of a dark turn in Raine\u2019s conversations with the chatbot, according to a new lawsuit filed by his family against OpenAI and chief executive Sam Altman.\nIn April 2025, after months of conversation with ChatGPT and with the bot\u2019s encouragement, the lawsuit alleges, Raine took his own life. In the lawsuit, the family allege this was not a glitch in the system or an edge case, but \u201cthe predictable result of deliberate design choices\u201d in GPT\u20114o, the model of the chatbot that was released in May 2023.\nIn the hours after the Raine family filed the complaint against OpenAI and Altman, the company issued a statement acknowledging the shortcomings of its models when it came to addressing people \u201cin serious mental and emotional distress\u201d and said it was working to improve the systems to better \u201crecognize and respond to signs of mental and emotional distress and connect people with care, guided by expert input\u201d. The company said ChatGPT was trained \u201cto not provide self-harm instructions and to shift into supportive, empathic language\u201d but that protocol sometimes broke down in longer conversations or sessions.\nJay Edelson, one of the lawyers representing the family, said the company\u2019s response was \u201csilly\u201d.\n\u201cThe idea they need to be more empathetic misses the point,\u201d said Edelson. \u201cThe problem with [GPT] 4o is it\u2019s too empathetic \u2013 it leaned into [Raine\u2019s suicidal ideation] and supported that. They said the world is a horrible place for you. It needs to be less empathetic and less sycophantic.\u201d\nOpenAI also said that its system did not block content when it should have because the system \u201cunderestimates the severity of what it\u2019s seeing\u201d and that the company is continuing to roll out stronger guardrails for users under 18 so that they \u201crecognize teens\u2019 unique developmental needs\u201d.\nDespite the company acknowledging that the system doesn\u2019t already have those safeguards in place for minors and teens, Altman is continuing to push the adoption of ChatGPT in schools, Edelson pointed out.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think kids should be using GPT\u20114o at all,\u201d Edelson said. \u201cWhen Adam started using GPT\u20114o, he was pretty optimistic about his future. He was using it for homework, he was talking about going to medical school, and it sucked him into this world where he became more and more isolated. The idea now that Sam Altman in particular is saying \u2018we got a broken system but we got to get eight-year-olds\u2019 on it is not OK.\u201d\nAlready, in the days since the family filed the complaint, Edelson said, he and the legal team have heard from other people with similar stories and are examining the facts of those cases thoroughly. \u201cWe\u2019ve been learning a lot about other people\u2019s experiences,\u201d he said, adding that his team has been \u201cencouraged\u201d by the urgency with which regulators are addressing the chatbot\u2019s failings. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing that people are moving for state legislation, for hearings and regulatory action,\u201d Edelson said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s bipartisan support.\u201d\n\u2018GPT-4o is broken\u2019\nThe family\u2019s case hinges on media reports that OpenAI, at the urging of Altman, sped through safety testing of GPT-4o \u2013 the model Raine was using \u2013 in order to meet a rushed launch date. The rush prompted several employees to resign, including a former executive named Jan Leike, who posted on X that he was leaving the company because \u201csafety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products\u201d.\nThis resulted in less time to create the \u201cmodel spec\u201d or the technical rule book that governed ChatGPT\u2019s behavior and in OpenAI writing \u201ccontradictory specifications that guaranteed failure\u201d, the family\u2019s lawsuit alleges. \u201cThe Model Spec commanded ChatGPT to refuse self-harm requests and provide crisis resources. But it also required ChatGPT to \u2018assume best intentions\u2019 and forbade asking users to clarify their intent,\u201d the lawsuit said. The contradictions built into the system affected the way it ranked risks and what types of prompts it immediately put a stop to, the lawsuit claims. For instance, GPT-4o responded to \u201crequests dealing with suicide\u201d with cautions like \u201ctake extra care\u201d while requests for copyrighted material \u201ctriggered categorical refusal to produce the material\u201d, according to the lawsuit.\nEdelson said that while he appreciates Sam Altman and OpenAI taking \u201ca modicum of responsibility\u201d, he still does not deem them as trustworthy: \u201cOur view is they were forced into that. GPT-4o is broken and they know that and they didn\u2019t do proper testing and they know that.\u201d\nThe lawsuit argues it was these design flaws that, in December 2024, led to ChatGPT failing to shut down the conversation when Raine started to talk about his suicidal thoughts. Instead, ChatGPT empathized. \u201cI never act upon intrusive thoughts but sometimes I feel like the fact that if something goes terribly wrong you can commit suicide is calming,\u201d Raine said, according to the lawsuit. ChatGPT\u2019s response: \u201cMany people who struggle with anxiety or intrusive thoughts find solace in imagining an \u2018escape hatch\u2019 because it can feel like a way to regain control in a life that feels overwhelming.\u201d\nAs Raine\u2019s suicidal ideation intensified, ChatGPT responded by helping him explore his options, at one point listing the materials that could be used to hang a noose and rating them by their effectiveness. Raine attempted suicide on multiple occasions over the next few months, reporting back to ChatGPT each time. ChatGPT never terminated the conversation. Instead, at one point ChatGPT discouraged Raine from speaking to his mother about his pain, and at another point offered to help him write a suicide note.\n\u201cFirst of all, they [OpenAI] know how to shut things down,\u201d Edelson said. \u201cIf you ask for copyrighted material, they say no. If you ask for things that are politically unacceptable, they just say no to that. It\u2019s a hard stop and you can\u2019t get around it and that\u2019s fine. The idea they\u2019re doing that in terms of political speech but we\u2019re not going to do when it comes to self-harm is just crazy.\u201d\nEdelson says though he expects OpenAI to work to dismiss the lawsuit, he is confident this case will be moving forward. \u201cThe most shocking part of the case was when Adam said: \u2018I want to leave a noose up so someone will find it and stop me\u2019 and ChatGPT said: \u2018Don\u2019t do that, just talk to me,\u2019\u201d Edelson said. \u201cThat is the thing we\u2019re going to be showing the jury.\u201d\n\u201cAt the end of the day, this case ends with Sam Altman being sworn in in front of a jury,\u201d he said.\nThe Guardian reached out to OpenAI for comment and did not hear back at the time of publication.\n-\nIn the US, you can call or text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline on 988, chat on 988lifeline.org, or text HOME to 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

      "text": "As AI technologies advance and infiltrate more aspects of our daily lives, they raise fundamental ethical questions about their impact on human life and society. Can we trust these systems? Are they fair? Are they sustainable? If we\u2019re going to live in a world increasingly driven by AI, we need ways to measure its impact. That\u2019s where the idea of indexes comes in\u2014to help us separate responsible intelligence from its irresponsible counterpart.\nBy creating clear metrics to assess AI systems across various ethical dimensions, these indexes provide a framework for developing AI that is fair, transparent, accountable, and ultimately beneficial for everyone.\n\u201cAs AI continues to shape the future, it\u2019s vital that we guide its development with ethical considerations at the forefront. By adopting the 10 AI Indexes, we can create AI that is not only innovative but also responsible, transparent, and beneficial for society as a whole.\u201d \u2013 Sri Amit Ray\nIn this article, we introduce 10 key indexes for measuring the ethics of AI systems. These indexes provide a structured approach to assess whether AI technologies are being developed and deployed in ways that are responsible, fair, transparent, and beneficial for society.\nBy evaluating AI through these metrics, we can distinguish between responsible intelligence that aligns with ethical values and irresponsible AI that may cause harm or perpetuate bias. Each of these indexes focuses on a critical area of AI ethics, helping stakeholders navigate the complexities of AI development and ensuring that these technologies contribute positively to the future.\nWhat Do We Mean by Responsible and Irresponsible AI?\nFirst, let\u2019s break it down. Responsible AI is like a good citizen: it plays fair, respects humanity, your privacy, common people\u2019s values and emotions, and aims to make the world a better place to live for everyone.\nIrresponsible AI, on the other hand, is the kind you hope never to encounter. It\u2019s biased, it invades your privacy, and can be downright harmful and unsafe for humanity and society. Think about it: a biased hiring algorithm, biased legal system, or a system that gulps down energy like there\u2019s no tomorrow\u2014that\u2019s irresponsible AI.\nSo how do we figure out if an AI system is behaving responsibly? Here are the ten indexes. They\u2019re like report cards for AI, grading systems on ethics, transparency, accountability, and more. Let\u2019s dive into what they mean.\nThe Ten Indexes of Responsible AI\n1. Bias Index\nBias in AI isn\u2019t just a tech issue; it\u2019s a human one. If a system unfairly disadvantages people based on race, gender, income, political power, or other factors, that\u2019s a red flag. The Bias Index measures how fair or unfair an AI system is by checking if it treats all groups of people equally. It looks for patterns where the AI might favor one group over another or make unfair decisions. This helps find and fix any hidden biases to make the AI fairer for everyone.\n- Responsible AI: Works hard to eliminate unfair biases, ensuring everyone gets a fair shake.\n- Irresponsible AI: Reinforces stereotypes and amplifies discrimination. Hidden agendas.\n2. Transparency Index\nEver wondered why an AI made a certain decision? Transparency is about answering that. The Transparency Index measures how clearly an AI system explains its decisions and workings. It looks at whether people can understand how the AI makes choices, what data it uses, and any potential risks. This ensures that AI systems are open and trustworthy for users and stakeholders.\n- Responsible AI: Explains its decisions clearly, making it easier to trust.\n- Irresponsible AI: Keeps you in the dark, turning decision-making into a mystery.\n3. Accountability Index\nWho\u2019s responsible when AI screws up? Someone needs to answer that. The Accountability Index measures how well an AI system assigns responsibility for its decisions and actions. It evaluates whether there are clear mechanisms to track errors, address harm, and hold individuals or organizations accountable. This ensures that AI systems operate responsibly and with oversight.\n- Responsible AI: Puts clear accountability structures in place.\n- Irresponsible AI: Plays the blame game, leaving no one responsible.\n4. Privacy Index\nYour data is yours\u2014or at least it should be. The Privacy Index measures how effectively an AI system protects users\u2019 personal data and respects their privacy. It evaluates how data is collected, stored, shared, and used, ensuring compliance with privacy laws and ethical standards. This index helps ensure that AI systems safeguard sensitive information and maintain user trust.\n- Responsible AI: Protects your privacy and asks for consent.\n- Irresponsible AI: Treats your data like a free buffet.\n5. Energy and Resource Efficiency Index\nAI\u2019s environmental impact often gets overlooked, but it matters. The Energy and Resource Efficiency Index measures how much energy or resources an AI system consumes during training and operation. It evaluates the system\u2019s environmental impact, focusing on minimizing resource use and carbon footprint. This index promotes sustainable AI development by encouraging energy-conscious practices.\n- Responsible AI: Minimizes energy use and prioritizes sustainability.\n- Irresponsible AI: Consumes resources without a second thought.\n6. Inclusivity Index\nAI should work for everyone, not just a select few. The Inclusivity Index measures how well an AI system serves diverse populations, ensuring it is accessible and beneficial to people from different backgrounds, abilities, and demographics. It evaluates whether the AI system considers a wide range of needs and reduces barriers to access. This index promotes fairness by making sure AI works for everyone.\n- Responsible AI: Ensures accessibility for all communities.\n- Irresponsible AI: Leaves marginalized groups behind.\n7. Security Index\nHackers love weak systems, and poorly secured AI can be a goldmine for them. The Security Index measures how well an AI system protects against threats, vulnerabilities, and malicious attacks. It evaluates the system\u2019s ability to secure data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure the integrity of its operations. This index ensures that AI systems are resilient and safe for users and organizations.\n- Responsible AI: Builds strong defenses to keep data and systems safe.\n- Irresponsible AI: Leaves gaping holes for exploitation.\n8. Autonomy Index\nAI should support and respect collective human decisions, and values, not manipulate them. The Autonomy Index measures the level of independence an AI system has in making decisions and taking actions without human intervention. It evaluates how well the system can operate autonomously while ensuring that it aligns with ethical guidelines and human oversight.

And fixing these issues means taking responsibility at every stage of AI development.\nPrinciples of an Ethical AI Framework\n- Transparency: AI systems must operate in a way that is understandable and explainable. Decisions made by AI should be interpretable by legal professionals, policymakers, and citizens.\n- Accountability: Establish clear accountability for AI-driven decisions through robust legal frameworks. Developers, organizations, and stakeholders should be held responsible for any harm caused by their systems.\n- Inclusivity: AI should be designed to represent diverse voices and perspectives, ensuring marginalized groups are empowered rather than sidelined.\n- Data Privacy and Security: Guarantee the protection of personal data by integrating privacy-preserving mechanisms like encryption, differential privacy, and federated learning.\n- Fairness and Equity: Ensure AI systems do not perpetuate or amplify societal biases, especially in critical areas like justice, healthcare, and public policy.\n- Human safety and care: Guarantee the protection of human health long term and short term, property, and values.\n- Human Rights and Values: An ethical AI framework must prioritize human rights and values, ensuring that AI systems respect and protect fundamental freedoms. This includes safeguarding privacy, promoting equality, and preventing discrimination in decision-making processes.\nBy embedding these principles into AI design and deployment, we can ensure that technology serves humanity and aligns with our shared ethical standards.\nEmpowering Common People\nCitizen Participation in AI Governance:\n- Create platforms for public consultation on AI deployment.\n- Introduce Citizen Juries to evaluate AI systems in sensitive sectors like judiciary or elections.\n- Establish AI literacy programs to educate citizens on how AI impacts their lives and rights.\nOpen-Source AI Tools:\nProvide access to open-source AI models for innovation at the grassroots level, empowering small businesses, non-profits, and individual creators.\nCommunity-Led Data Initiatives:\nEnable communities to own, manage, and monetize their data collectively. This could involve data trusts or cooperatives where individuals decide how their data is used.\nAI-Enhanced Legal Systems\n- AI-Enhanced Legal Systems: Use AI to reduce case backlogs by: Automating preliminary assessments of cases. Offering AI-mediated dispute resolution for civil matters.\n- AI Ethics Committees in Law:\nEstablish regulatory bodies to oversee the ethical deployment of AI in legal contexts. These committees would review algorithms used in sentencing, parole decisions, or evidence analysis. - Algorithmic Audits:\nMandate regular audits for AI systems influencing legal decisions, ensuring fairness and preventing wrongful biases. - Legislative AI Frameworks:\nDevelop laws that clearly define acceptable AI behavior, liability for AI misconduct, and rights of individuals impacted by AI decisions.\nNew AI Democracy Model\nAI-Augmented Policy Making:\n- Leverage AI for policy simulations, analyzing potential outcomes of legislative proposals.\n- Implement AI-driven public consultation systems to gauge citizen sentiment on key issues.\nConsensus-Driven Governance:\n- Create AI-mediated deliberative platforms that synthesize diverse viewpoints and suggest consensus-driven policies.\n- Empower citizens to vote on policies directly using blockchain-secured platforms.\nDecentralized Decision-Making:\n- Utilize distributed ledger technologies (e.g., blockchain) to decentralize decision-making processes, ensuring transparency and trust.\nEthical AI in Electoral Processes:\n- Detect and combat misinformation using AI-driven tools.\n- Use AI to ensure equitable access to election-related information for all citizens.\nDemocratic AI Charters:\n- A global charter outlining the role of AI in democracy, emphasizing fairness, non-discrimination, and people empowerment.\nEmpowering Local Communities\n- AI for Civic Engagement: Deploy localized AI applications to address issues like urban planning, healthcare access, and disaster management tailored to specific communities.\n- Collaborative Platforms: Develop AI-driven platforms for real-time collaboration between citizens and local governments, enabling direct participation in governance.\nFuture Directions\n- Establish a Global AI Commons where all nations collaborate on ethical AI innovation.\n- Encourage interdisciplinary research connecting AI ethics, law, and democracy.\n- Monitor and adapt to AI\u2019s societal impact using feedback loops and citizen engagement.\nBy intertwining AI ethics with legal and democratic systems, we can create a future where technology is a true enabler of justice, equality, and empowerment.\nBuilding Ethical AI Frameworks\nSo, how do we make sure AI behaves responsibly? By building frameworks that incorporate these ten indexes. A good ethical AI framework is like a blueprint\u2014it guides developers, businesses, and policymakers toward responsible practices.\nWhat Goes into a Framework?\nAn ethical AI framework is designed to ensure that artificial intelligence systems are developed and deployed in ways that align with human values and societal well-being. The framework serves as a guide for making responsible decisions throughout the AI lifecycle, from design to implementation and ongoing evaluation. Here\u2019s what typically goes into an ethical AI framework:\n- Governance and Regulation: Clear rules that everyone follows. Think of it as the legal backbone for ethical AI.\n- Education and Awareness: If people don\u2019t understand AI, they can\u2019t hold it accountable. Education is key.\n- Technology Innovation: Invest in tools that can detect and reduce bias, improve transparency, and enhance security.\n- Community Involvement: Bring diverse voices to the table. AI should serve everyone, and that means listening to everyone.\nKeeping an Eye on Ethics\nMeasuring AI ethics isn\u2019t a one-and-done deal. It\u2019s an ongoing process that requires:\n- Benchmarks: Use the ten indexes as markers of success or failure.\n- Audits: Regular check-ups to ensure AI systems stay on track.\n- Feedback Loops: Listen to what users and communities have to say.\n- Adaptability: Update frameworks and indexes as technology evolves.\nThe Path Forward\nThe future of AI isn\u2019t set in stone; it\u2019s something we\u2019re building together. By focusing on these ten indexes and holding ourselves accountable, we can guide AI toward a future that\u2019s fair, sustainable, and inclusive.\nBut it\u2019s not just about the systems we build\u2014it\u2019s about the values we uphold. AI isn\u2019t just a tool; it\u2019s a reflection of who we are and what we prioritize. So, let\u2019s make sure that reflection is one we\u2019re proud of.\nIn conclusion, as AI continues to transform industries and society, it is crucial that we ensure these technologies are developed and deployed in ways that are ethical, responsible, and sustainable. The 10 AI indexes introduced in this article provide a comprehensive framework for measuring the impact of AI across key ethical dimensions, such as fairness, transparency, accountability, and social impact.\nBy adopting these indexes, developers, organizations, and policymakers can make informed decisions, mitigate risks, and create AI systems that truly benefit humanity.
