  "content": "A man was rescued after surviving nine days lost in the Canadian wilderness, officials said.\n\nAndrew Barber, 39, was reported missing in British Columbia's Cariboo region on July 31, CBS News partner BBC News reported. Williams Lake Royal Canadian Mounted Police Staff Sgt. Brad McKinnon told The Canadian Press that the search was like \"looking for a needle in a haystack\" and described the remote area as \"boggy,\" with \"tons of rural and wilderness areas.\"\n\nLuckily, Barber had an \"above average understanding of the wilderness,\" McKinnon said. He was able to build a shelter from sticks and moss. He drank pond water to stay hydrated, McKinnon said, and \"munched on whatever he could find.\"\n\nBarber also wrote multiple messages, including carving the word \"HELP\" on a rock near his shelter and drawing an \"SOS\" in mud to try to alert rescuers.\n\nOn Aug. 8, Barber was found safe near his shelter after being spotted by a helicopter from the Quesnel Search and Rescue team. Rescuers had first seen Barber's truck, then they found him and his shelter about three miles away, Quesnel Search and Rescue president Bob Zimmerman told CBC News.\n\nBarber was severely dehydrated and had a leg injury, the BBC reported. He was taken to a hospital for treatment and released.\n\n\"Today's result is why we train, why we respond, and why we never give up,\" the Quesnel Search and Rescue team said on social media.\n\nOther agencies, including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, British Columbia search and rescue organization PEP Air and BC Emergency Health Services also took part in the search for Barber.\n\nZimmerman told CBC News that despite Barber's survival skills, he may not have lasted much longer.\n\n\"He was having a hard time standing. I don't know that he would have made it another 24 hours without us recovering him,\" Zimmerman said. \"He's a lucky man.\"",

      "text": "Man rescued after he went missing for more than a week in B.C. wilderness\nHe created a small shelter out of mud, moss and wrote 'HELP' on a rock\nAfter more than a week in the B.C. wilderness, a man has been rescued thanks to the efforts of Quesnel Search and Rescue (SAR) and the Williams Lake RCMP.\nThe man was found in the bush, near a shelter he had created out of mud and sticks, about 50 kilometres northwest of Williams Lake, B.C., said Quesnel SAR president and manager Bob Zimmerman.\nThe man was reported missing to RCMP July 31 after he was last seen July 28. Zimmerman said his team first received word of the incident on Aug. 3.\nQuesnel SAR first looked for the man by air with P.E.P. Air (Provincial Emergency Program Air), a volunteer aviation society. But they had no luck during the first few days of the search.\nZimmerman said the initial information around a possible location was quite vague, but rescuers knew he'd been travelling in a pickup truck.\n\"We had to cover a large area to try and sweep around that centre spot,\" Zimmerman said. \"Which is why we used P.E.P. Air, because to drive on the ground and check roads with ATVs, UTVs or vehicles, there's hundreds of kilometres of drivable trails in that area.\"\nThe search team also tried using electronic surveillance to try to connect with any cellphones in the area. That too, was unsuccessful.\nFinally, a SAR observer went out with an RCMP helicopter crew on Friday.\n\"The observer spotted a glint of sunshine off the windshield from the truck,\" Zimmerman said.\nRescuers found the truck, but not the lost man.\nThen, about five kilometres away from the truck, crews say they spotted a man standing by a lake and a big rock with the word \"HELP\" written on it.\n\"He had built a little mud shelter with moss and mud up against the big rock,\" Zimmerman said.\nThe man, however, was in poor health.\n\"He was having a hard time standing. I don't know that he would have made it another 24 hours without us recovering him,\" Zimmerman said.\nHe did not have food on him, and Zimmerman said he had been drinking pond water. He'd also stuffed grass into his clothing to try to get more insulation from the elements, according to Zimmerman.\nZimmerman recommended others to always have a charged cellphone on them \u2014 or, better yet, a satellite connector.\n\"If people are going out, really the best thing to do is have something that will have a satellite connection for you. So you can always get a message out on a satellite by text as to where you are and what the problem is.\"\nThe man was rescued in the RCMP helicopter and then connected with the ambulance service, Zimmerman said.\n\"He's a lucky man.\"\nWith files from Cory Correia"

      "text": "VICTORIA - Staff Sgt. Brad McKinnon of the Williams Lake RCMP said he has seen \"some very exceptional things\" during his 20 years in policing, but the story of 39-year-old Andrew Barber could have had a very different ending.\nMcKinnon said a police helicopter coming from Prince George spotted the man in the afternoon of Aug. 8 in a remote area north of McLeese Lake \u2014 nine days after he was first reported missing to RCMP on July 31.\n\"He had sustained an injury to his right leg, and he was severely dehydrated,\" McKinnon said.\nBut Barber knew how to help himself. A picture posted on Facebook by Quesnel Search and Rescue shows the makeshift shelter he built for himself out of wood and mud with the shelter leaning up against a rock with the word \"Help\" scrawled on it.\nIt was at that location where rescuers eventually found Barber, not far from where his truck had broken down while travelling on a forest service road.\nOnce stabilized with assistance from police on scene and Quesnel Search and Rescue members, Barber was flown out by helicopter and transported by ambulance to Cariboo Memorial Hospital in Williams Lake, from which he has been since released, McKinnon said.\n\"I'm told, he is doing quite well,\" McKinnon said.\nBut the story could have had a different outcome, given Barber's lack of water.\n\"He was literally slurping unclean pond water to stay hydrated,\" McKinnon said. \"The human body can go a long time without food, but water is a different situation.\"\nMcKinnon said Barber also \"munched on whatever he could find\" during his time in the woods.\nMcKinnon also praised the work of the RCMP's various partners in the search, including Quesnel Search and Rescue. \"Today's result is why we train, why we respond, and why we never give up,\" the group posted on Facebook.\nMcKinnon said he cannot answer how close the search for Barber came to turning into a recovery mission. \"I'll put it this way \u2014 had we not found him when we did, I would have had graver concerns than I currently do,\" he said.\n\"We had been at this for nine days, and it was essentially like looking for a needle in a haystack,\" he added. \"The Cariboo region of British Columbia is beautiful, but it is immense, and there are tons of rural and wilderness areas.\"\nMcKinnon said it is not clear why Barber was in the area described as \"boggy\" and remote, but his \"above average understanding of the wilderness\" and ingenuity contributed to his survival.\n\"The human drive to survive is a powerful thing,\" McKinnon said.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 10, 2025."
