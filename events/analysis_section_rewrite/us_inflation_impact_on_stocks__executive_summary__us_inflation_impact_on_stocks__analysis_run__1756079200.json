      "feedback": "Strong anchor to a regime framework, but the draft needs a tighter, 4–6 sentence executive brief that plumbs a single, coherent house view across horizons. Actions: (1) compress into one crisp view like: “Base case: inflation normalizes and policy eases in H2 2025, keeping growth assets bid but with idiosyncratic risks in AI cash flows and crypto regs,” mapped explicitly to Regimes A→B→C with clear transition criteria (e.g., CPI momentum failing to accelerate and futures pricing signaling easing for A→B; tariff/policy shocks or inflation wobble prompting Regime B→C). (2) Anchor all claims in a clean causal chain: policy stance drives financial conditions, which lifts risk appetite and re-prices crypto/AI infra—then tie to the sources (OGK8WLL69, OBQMETU6O, V9HASRVZA, EPJYXB7DX, YQOMV2HAJ, WISLWAJ15, 5IMB47HCS, REGN). (3) Replace stock-by-stock detail with 1–2 sector illustrations of dispersion (e.g., Regeneron vs Fortrea) to show macro-to-mirmarket transmission, while citing their metrics succinctly; avoid duplicative micro-numbers. (4) Quantify macro channels once, citing the steady-state figures from sources (AI/private-credit ~$50B/quarter; CMBS exposure up ~30% to $15.6B; Bitmine ETH purchase ~$45M) and reference them as structural flows anchoring the regime narrative. (5) Add 4–5 explicit triggers and invalidation rules for the 0–3/3–6 month horizons (e.g., CPI MoM at or below 0.40% for two consecutive months to validate A→B; debt-trajectory revisions; crypto/regulatory shocks; Medicaid/work‑requirement progress; private-label pricing signals). (6) Ensure no contradictions across horizon sections, drop redundant lines, and keep the Near-Term section tightly aligned with the regime map. This will deliver a concise, decision-ready brief with a clear house view, explicit catalysts, watch-items, and invalidation pathways anchored to the named sources.",
