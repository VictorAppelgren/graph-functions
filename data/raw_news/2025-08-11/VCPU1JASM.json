  "content": "When Apple announced Live Translation at WWDC25, it highlighted use cases like FaceTime, phone calls, and messages. But one major use case was missing: real-world conversations. As it turns out, that was in the works too.\n\nNew image hints at new AirPods gesture\n\nIn today\u2019s iOS 26 developer beta 6, we spotted a new system asset that appears to depict a gesture triggered by pressing both AirPods stems at once.\n\nThe image displays text in English, Portuguese, French, and German, and it is associated with the Translate app. For now, we can confirm it\u2019s associated specifically with the AirPods Pro (2nd generation) and AirPods (4th generation).\n\nReal-world live translation is right up the wearable wheelhouse\n\nWhile Apple didn\u2019t mention real-world translation for AirPods during the WWDC25 keynote, Bloomberg had reported earlier in the year that this feature was in the works. This feels like a natural extension of the Live Translation features already announced for FaceTime, Messages, and Phone, and it is also a strong use case for wearables in general, something we\u2019ve already seen with devices like the Meta Ray-Bans.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s unclear which iPhones will support the new gesture, as it is very unlikely that the feature will run entirely on the AirPods. But it\u2019s reasonable to assume the cutoff will align with Apple\u2019s official hardware requirements for other Live Translation features:\n\nLive Translation in Messages is available in Chinese (Simplified), English (UK, US), French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil) and Spanish (Spain) when Apple Intelligence is enabled on a compatible iPhone, iPad or Mac, as well as on Apple Watch Series 9 and later and Apple Watch Ultra 2 when paired with an Apple Intelligence\u2013enabled iPhone. Live Translation in Phone and FaceTime is available for one-to-one calls in English (UK, US), French (France), German, Portuguese (Brazil) and Spanish (Spain) when Apple Intelligence is enabled on a compatible iPhone, iPad or Mac.\n\nGiven the need of an even lower latency for real-world interactons, it is possible that this feature may be exclusive to the iPhone 17 lineup, which could help explain why Apple has kept it under wraps until now.\n\nSpeculation aside, what we do know is that Apple appears to be prepping the release of a live translation feature associated with AirPods, and that\u2019s exciting enough, especially for anyone living abroad or traveling somewhere the language is unfamiliar.\n\nCould you see yourself using AirPods for live translation? Let us know in the comments.",

      "text": "Apple has released the sixth developer beta version of iOS 26. We expect the redesigned version of the iPhone software to officially launch next month.\niOS 26 developer beta 6 has arrived\nApple describes the upcoming iPhone software update by saying that iOS 26 \u201cdelivers a stunning new design, powerful Apple Intelligence capabilities, new ways to stay connected in the Phone and Messages apps, and exciting updates to CarPlay, Apple Music, Maps, and Wallet.\u201d\nIn iOS 26 beta 2, we saw design tweaks including legibility improvements for Control Center, better menu organization in Safari, and stronger accessibility options with borders added to High Contrast Mode.\niOS 26 beta 3 most notably added opaqueness to some of the more transparent tab bars alongside new wallpaper colors. Beta 4 reverted the opaqueness tweaks. Meanwhile, Notification Center still uses absolute transparency when pulled down until fully open. That seems ripe for changing.\niOS 26 beta 4 also reintroduced notification summaries for news and entertainment apps. Apple previously paused the Apple Intelligence feature after complaints that text summaries could change the meaning of headlines.\niOS 26 beta 5 addressed a lot of user feedback by bringing back the Select button in Mail, adding a toggle to revert back to the classic Camera mode swipe direction, and more.\nStay tuned to 9to5Mac for changes discovered in iOS 26 beta 6. If all goes well, today\u2019s developer beta build will likely be the same release as a future iOS 26 public beta 3 release.\nIs your iPhone ready for iOS 26? The next major software update runs on iPhone SE (2nd generation) as well as iPhone 11 and up. iOS 18 is the last version that will run on iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max. You\u2019ll need to upgrade your iPhone if you want the latest features and newest design, but older iPhones will continue to receive software updates for security for a while. Features that use Apple Intelligence require iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, or any iPhone 16 family model.\nWe\u2019ll collect and list every change to iOS 26 beta and more on 9to5Mac so stay tuned (and join the fun with tips@9to5mac.com)!\nCheck out these great accessories\nApple AirTag | Add Find My tracking to anything\nBeats USB-A to USB-C Cable | The official CarPlay cable\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
