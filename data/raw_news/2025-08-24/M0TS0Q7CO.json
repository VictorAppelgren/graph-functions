  "title": "Should We Be Delighted With Bossard Holding AG's (VTX:BOSN) ROE Of 20%?",

  "content": "One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Bossard Holding AG (VTX:BOSN).\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Bossard Holding is:\n\n20% = CHF72m \u00f7 CHF357m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each CHF1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made CHF0.20 in profit.\n\nDoes Bossard Holding Have A Good Return On Equity?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Bossard Holding has a superior ROE than the average (10%) in the Trade Distributors industry.\n\nThat is a good sign. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Bossard Holding by visiting our risks dashboard for free on our platform here.\n\nMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.",

  "argos_summary": "Bossard Holding AG (BOSN) has a strong return on equity of 20%, well above the 10% industry average for trade distributors, but its high debt-to-equity ratio of 111.8% may inflate the metric and increase risk. The company\u2019s earnings have been slightly declining at about 2% per year, while revenue growth remains modest at roughly 4% annually, and its net margin sits around 6.7%. Recent news highlights potential undervaluation, a sensible use of debt, and a modest dividend increase, though the firm\u2019s share price has underperformed the Swiss market and its industry over the past year. Overall, BOSN offers solid profitability but investors should weigh the leverage risk and mixed performance trends when considering an investment.",
