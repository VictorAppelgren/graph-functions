We are 60,\" she joked. \"You just are not going to know what we're doing every minute of the day.\"\n\"Yes, I guess we're famous, but we\u2019re 60.

And I have to own that. Those are my choices. Whatever the backlash was, I had to sit in it and own it. But I didn't regret it, you know? It's my life now, and I can say that, now.\"\nOBAMAS SEEN TOGETHER FOR 1ST TIME IN 6 MONTHS AS ANALYST SEES \u2018NO LOVE LOST\u2019 AMID DIVORCE MURMURS\nObama, who co-hosts a podcast with her brother, Craig Robinson, said she would still use her platform, but she was over politics and wouldn't be \"campaigning for another candidate\" in the future.\n\"If it's not fun for me, selfishly, then let's not do that,\" she explained of the life philosophy she's embraced as of late.\nThe former first lady dismissed divorce rumors during other interviews this year.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\"If I were having problems with my husband, everybody would know about it. My brother would know it. I\u2019d be problem-solving in public. I\u2019m not a martyr,\" she said on \"The Diary of a CEO\" podcast in May.\nShe also slammed the divorce speculation during an interview in April.\n\"[T]hat's the thing that we as women, I think we struggle with, like disappointing people. I mean so much so that this year people were, they couldn't even fathom that I was making a choice for myself, that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing, you know?\" she told actress Sophia Bush. \"This couldn't be a grown woman just making a set of decisions herself, right? But that's what society does to us.\""

Prior to his presidency, he served in the U.S. Senate and as vice president in former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. During his own presidency, the Biden-Harris administration prioritized issues such as climate change, Medicaid, infrastructure and LGBTQ+ initiatives.\nDuring the 2024 campaign cycle, Biden ran as the original Democratic nominee. Following his first presidential debate with Donald Trump, Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed his vice president at the time, Kamala Harris, for president. Harris lost the election, with many voters voicing concerns over immigration, border security and the economy as reasons for casting their votes for the Republican presidential candidate, President Donald Trump.\nAfter leaving office, Biden has largely kept to himself but has remained a topic of conversation in politics, mainly regarding his health, which was questioned throughout his presidency. Investigations and allegations of a cover-up regarding the truth of Biden\u2019s physical and mental well-being during his time in the White House have been brought forward.\nBiden\u2019s family has also been in the spotlight over the years, facing both tragedy and controversy. He lost his first wife, Neilia Hunter Biden, and his daughter, Naomi Biden, in a car accident in 1972. He later married Jill Biden in 1977. In 2015, his son Beau Biden died after a battle with brain cancer.\nBiden\u2019s other son, Hunter Biden, has faced personal battles with addiction over the years and has been at the center of numerous legal investigations, including over the contents of his laptop. Before leaving office, Biden pardoned Hunter for crimes he \"has committed or may have committed.\u201d"
