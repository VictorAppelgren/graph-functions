      "feedback": "Strengths: you nail the core near‑term catalysts in one frame—Intel’s government stake and the Jackson Hole rate‑cut backdrop, plus a Canada‑US tariff détente that could ease cross‑border supply chains (cite XQWTVR71K); you also correctly flag the risk‑on reaction via front‑end yields and equity moves in that session (front‑end yields moved lower on rate‑cut expectations, per the same piece). Gaps: the causal chain is underdeveloped for a 0–3 week horizon; there is no explicit, testable transmission mechanism or thresholds (what exact fed funds path, what timing, and what magnitudes drive Intel’s multiple re-rating or capex plans, and how Canada’s carve‑out feeds into fab investment or supplier pricing); numeric anchors are missing beyond the stake size, and you don’t quantify the immediate risk to Nvidia/China policy or sanctions that could re‑price risk premia. Edits: reframe as a concise, scenario‑driven 0–3 week playbook with (i) a base case: Powell signals orGuides a September cut; Canada mirrors USMCA carve‑out; Intel stake remains passive but vesting and board voting are watched for governance signals; (ii) a bull case if the Fed confirms a faster path to cuts and the carve‑out solidifies, with Intel multiple expansion and stronger capex visibility; (iii) a bear case if inflation surprises hawkishly or tariff/policy shifts re‑accelerate; attach explicit triggers and thresholds (e.g., Fed policy guidance clarity, timing and size of the vesting milestone, date of tariff carve‑out confirmation, and any new sanctions or export controls). Quantify transmission: cite the measured market response in the session (2‑year yields down ~11.5 bps; equity rally) to anchor the magnitude of near‑term pricing, and peg the governance event to a visible data point (the ~$11B implied value of a 10% stake with a near‑15% total economic interest once the 5% vests; cite XQWTVR71K). Invalidation rules: if Powell signals no near‑term cuts or if Canada fails to mirror or if new tariffs/sanctions reappear, then assume risk‑off. Monitoring checklist: Fed communications cadence and actual rate‑path action; Intel vesting and governance signals; status and durability of the USMCA carve‑out in Canada; any new tech/export controls or sanctions news (and Nvidia‑China policy echoes) (XQWTVR71K). Citations: primary anchoring to XQWTVR71K; augment with YB758UDBU for geopolitical risk framing if you quote Trump/Fed dynamics, but keep the core anchors to the Bloomberg material.",
