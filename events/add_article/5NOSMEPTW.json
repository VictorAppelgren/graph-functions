      "summary": "The article discusses the current state of AI development, particularly focusing on OpenAI's GPT-5, which, while advanced, is seen as an incremental improvement rather than a radical leap towards true agentic AI. Analysts highlight the importance of building the necessary infrastructure to support AI's capabilities, noting that many enterprises are still in early stages of deployment. Despite improvements in areas like coding and multimodal processing, challenges remain in achieving full autonomy and trustworthiness in AI outputs, necessitating careful governance and oversight.",
