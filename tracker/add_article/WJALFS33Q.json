It compares her strategy to historical collectibles like Beanie Babies, noting how her marketing creates a sense of scarcity and exclusivity that fuels fan obsession. While acknowledging her financial success and avoidance of public scandals, the piece questions whether her bubble will eventually burst, highlighting the broader dynamics of celebrity-driven consumerism in the digital age.",
