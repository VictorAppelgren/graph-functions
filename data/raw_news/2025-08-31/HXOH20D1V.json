  "title": "3 Standout Themes That Emerged From Earnings Season",
  "description": "Tariffs are beginning to take a toll, but can the economy hold up?",
  "content": "\u2022 AI continues to be a growth driver for big tech companies.\n\u2022 Casual dining is suddenly taking share away from quick-service restaurants.\n\u2022 Tariffs could have a broad effect across the economy.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than S&P 500 Index \u203a\n\nEarnings season can give investors a glimpse into what's currently driving the market. With the bulk of the second-quarter earnings season in the rearview mirror -- more than 90% of S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) companies have already reported as of this writing -- three major themes should be on every investor's radar. Let's look at each.\n\nBig tech and AI are still driving the market\n\nThe first big takeaway is that the hype around artificial intelligence (AI) is not cooling off. Megacap tech companies are still spending huge on this technology with their investments only expected to rise.\n\nMicrosoft's quarter was a great example of this theme with the company seeing strength across its businesses, all driven by AI. Its cloud computing unit, Azure, led the way, but its enterprise software business also saw strong growth as adoption of its Microsoft 365 Copilot apps accelerated. Alphabet and Amazon's cloud businesses also saw robust growth, and and all three companies said demand outstripped capacity.\n\nMeta Platforms was able to harness the power of AI to help drive strong ad revenue growth. The same was also true for Google's search business and Amazon's ad business.\n\nBig tech companies continue to lean into AI infrastructure spending. Alphabet raised its yearly capital expenditure (capex) guidance by $10 billion to $85 billion, while Microsoft said it would spend heavily on servers and graphics processing units (GPUs) in its new fiscal year to try to meet growing demand.\n\nThis, not surprisingly, is leading to robust growth in the semiconductor space. Nvidia continues to be a standout, while Advanced Micro Devices also saw strong growth outside of China. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing saw a 44% increase in revenue as it remains the market leader in manufacturing advanced chips.\n\nRight now, the impact of AI is real, and the biggest beneficiaries are the biggest companies in the tech space.\n\nThere is an interesting dichotomy in the restaurant space right now. There was a clear pullback in quick-service dining in the U.S. during the second quarter, and it affected both fast-food and fast-casual chains.\n\nThe fast-food space was more of a mixed bag. Yum Brands saw its U.S. same-store sales (comps) sink 5% for the KFC and Pizza Hut brands, while its Taco Bell division saw a 4% increase. McDonald's U.S. comps were strong, rising 2.5%, as it leaned into value offerings.",

      "text": "Earnings season is the time each quarter when most publicly traded companies report their quarterly or annual earnings. It is generally when most volatility happens at the individual stock level.\nLet's go over the timing of earnings season and how it can affect your investment.\nWhen is earnings season?\nWhen is earnings season?\nIn the U.S., earnings season happens quarterly, or once every three months, for public companies. In some foreign markets, it happens semiannually, or once every six months. Earnings season generally begins a few weeks after the end of the prior fiscal quarter and lasts for about six weeks.\nSome companies get their earnings together and report right away in those first few weeks, but others wait as long as two months after the quarter to release earnings. It's a lot of work to close accounts, get an audit done if it's required, and have a lawyer put together the filings required by the Securities and Exchange Commission. If you own a wide range of stocks, it's possible that you would be in earnings season more often than not.\nHere are the general date ranges for earnings season for each quarter (note that companies with an unusual fiscal quarter may report on a different schedule):\n- First quarter (ends March 31): April 15 to May 31\n- Second quarter (ends June 30): July 15 to Aug. 31\n- Third quarter (ends Sept. 30): Oct. 15 to Nov. 30\n- Fourth quarter (ends Dec. 31): Jan. 15 to Feb. 28\nWhy is earnings season important?\nWhy is earnings season important?\nEarnings season is certainly more important for smaller, growth-oriented companies. Stodgy old stalwarts in the Dow that your grandparents have owned for 60 years probably won't see much of a bump.\nFor growth companies, the reason earnings season is so important is that the companies are still in the process of proving out a business model and potentially even a product. Quarterly earnings reporting is one of the few times during the year when the company is required to report on its progress. Analysts, investors, and the media alike await the report with bated breath to see how the progress is going.\nIt's all about expectations. Small companies can see 20% moves (in either direction) when they report quarterly earnings. At times, a small company will have a blowout quarter, and the stock will plateau or go down because the market's expectations are too high.\nPay attention to what day the company reports earnings. Some companies with poor results will do a late Friday filing and announcement to try to keep the results out of the news.\nLet's look at a few recent examples:\nNetflix (NFLX -1.87%) reported results on a Tuesday in July. You'd think Netflix would qualify as a stodgy old stalwart that your grandparents have owned for, well, 16 years by this point. But the stock market reacted strongly to the report, sending the shares down from $531 per share to $513 in one day.\nDocuSign (DOCU 1.37%) is one of the companies with a weird fiscal quarter end; its second quarter ends on July 31. DocuSign reported 50% growth in revenue, and its stock responded with a 5% jump.\nThese aren't the types of big moves many traders and investors are used to. Netflix had a meh earnings report and fell just 3%; DocuSign blew out revenue growth and jumped 5%. Both of these reports happened following years of strong upward movement for both stocks. It's possible the market is fatigued by this trend, and there just wasn't enough volume for a strong move either way.\nRelated investing topics\nHow to benefit from earnings season\nHow to benefit from earnings season\nAs long-term investors, we look at earnings season a lot differently than many traders. Quarterly earnings analysis is imperative for good fundamental investing, but trying to guess and trade around big moves on earnings day is a fool's game.\nUse earnings season to make sure your investment thesis is still valid. Read closely what a company's management says and compare it to what they do. Don't get freaked out by one or two bad quarters. If anything, use a few bad quarters by an otherwise good company as a buying opportunity if the market overreacts.\nUnderstanding earnings season is just another useful item in your toolkit as you learn to be a better investor."

      "text": "Computers excel at crunching numbers but not at tasks that many people do with ease, like language processing, visual perception, object manipulation, reasoning, planning, and learning. Artificial intelligence (AI), including its offshoots of deep learning and machine learning, uses computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as language generation and facial recognition.\nAI stocks are shares of companies that are developing or employing AI technology as part of their business. AI stocks span sectors like semiconductors, software, and even beyond tech, representing companies that are using AI in ways that set them apart from their peers.\nHow AI is used\nHow do companies use artificial intelligence?\nArtificial intelligence, or AI, is created through machine learning, which involves training a system on vast amounts of data. It then uses the trained system to make inferences about data it's never seen.\nThe simplest example is a system designed to detect objects in images. Images containing those objects are provided to the system, which \"learns\" how to detect them in other images. The more objects it detects in images, the more accurate the detection system becomes.\nCompanies employ AI in two main ways. Many tech companies use it to make their existing operations more powerful through high-profile applications like robotics, self-driving cars, and virtual assistants.\nFor instance, AI is used by Alphabet (GOOGL 0.63%) (GOOG 0.56%) subsidiary Google to filter spam in Gmail, by Amazon (AMZN -1.16%) to recommend products to customers, and by Netflix (NFLX -1.87%) to guide content creation and recommendations.\nMore recently, OpenAI's ChatGPT has shown how far generative AI -- a division of artificial intelligence capable of generating texts, images, sounds, and ideas -- has come. It can answer questions directly, write poems, and has even passed bar and medical exams.\nIt has spawned a wave of new generative AI chatbots, including Anthropic's Claude, Alphabet's Gemini, and Meta Platforms' (META -1.69%) Meta AI. The potential is enormous.\nThe next frontier for generative AI is AI agents or agentic AI. This technology allows AI to perform and complete whole tasks without being prompted. For instance, an automated customer service agent that could handle a request without needing human assistance would be agentic AI. Salesforce's (CRM 0.72%) AgentForce is one example of a new agentic AI tool.\nSome companies also profit directly from AI by selling hardware, software, services, or expertise that the technology requires. These are true AI stocks and include those listed and described below.\n5 top AI stocks\n5 AI stocks to buy in 2025\n| Company | AI Focus |\n|---|---|\n| Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) | Data center GPUs and superchips |\n| Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) | Generative AI and self-driving cars |\n| Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Memory chips for data centers and generative AI tools |\n| CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV) | Generative AI-focused cloud infrastructure platform |\n| Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) | AI chatbots, LLMs, and wearable devices |\n1. Nvidia\nLeading graphics processing unit (GPU) company Nvidia has taken advantage of the AI boom, with its GPUs becoming the de facto standard in data centers worldwide. Generative AI's training phase demands a lot of computing power; the phase that follows, the inference phase, typically requires less.\nGPU chips, which were once used primarily for rendering video games, support both phases well. Nvidia's ambitions have gone beyond GPUs, as the company now aims to build AI factories or data centers full of Nvidia components to run AI applications and programming.\nNvidia's data center business now makes up the vast majority of the company's revenue, thanks to the emergence of generative AI. Because it sells the building blocks for AI infrastructure, Nvidia became the first major company to see a significant revenue boost from AI.\nRevenue surged through 2023 and 2024, and the stock has soared as well. It's been the most valuable company in the world on several occasions and was No. 1 in July 2025. It also became the first company to reach a market cap of $4 trillion. In 2024, full-year revenue jumped 114% to $130.5 billion, driven by the surge in data center demand, and growth is expected to be strong in 2025 as well.\nNvidia's chips are popular for running demanding workloads that applications like large language models (LLMs) require. The pure-play chip stock is now selling its new Blackwell platform, which major cloud infrastructure services are deploying in 2025, and demand is outstripping supply.\nSelf-driving cars and \"physical AI\" are other areas of focus. Nvidia develops hardware and software platforms that can power driver-assistance features and fully autonomous driving, which could be a significant source of revenue if that industry takes off. Automotive revenue is only a small fraction of the company's revenue, but that could change.\nWith Tesla (TSLA -3.45%) having launched its robotaxi network in Austin, the autonomous vehicle race appears to be heating up, and that should be good news for the semiconductor sector.\nA self-driving car must process massive amounts of data from multiple sensors and cameras in real time, detect objects such as pedestrians and other vehicles, and make complex decisions. They require tremendous computing power, which is exactly what Nvidia's platform delivers.\nIts professional visualization segment, which includes its omniverse, also has potential in AI. Nvidia's chipsets could someday be supplanted by more specialized processors designed for AI, but the company is in an enviable position for now.\n2. Alphabet\nAlphabet has been preparing for the AI revolution for years, acquiring the AI research lab DeepMind in 2014. It's also among the leaders in autonomous vehicles through its Waymo subsidiary, which is now ferrying passengers in its driverless cars in cities such as San Francisco and Phoenix.\nAlphabet launched Gemini -- its own AI chatbot and the latest iteration in its competition with ChatGPT -- which some see as a threat to Google Search. So far, concerns about a challenge to its search dominance seem to have been overblown, as Alphabet's ad revenue continues to grow steadily.\nThe company said that its Gemini 2.5 has been \"widely recognized as the best model in the industry.\" New features, like AI assistant and AI mode, have helped Google Search defend its market share against AI-based challenges.\nWith information at the heart of its business, it's unsurprising that the company has prioritized AI. It's rolled out AI tools for Google Cloud and Google Workspace, including a generative AI assistant that helps write emails. Even its customer acquisition strategy in the cloud is based around AI -- the company has targeted AI start-ups for its cloud infrastructure service.\nAI also plays a role in improving its search engine and YouTube, where it can pinpoint a relevant section of a video and direct users straight to it. Finally, Alphabet is ramping up spending on capital expenditures, with plans to spend $75 billion on AI infrastructure and related needs in 2025.\n3. Microsoft\nMicrosoft has gotten lots of buzz lately, thanks to its partnership with OpenAI. The tech giant began investing in the tech start-up in 2019 and invested another $10 billion in OpenAI following the launch of ChatGPT.\nMicrosoft has incorporated GPT features across its product portfolio, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service, Edge web browser, Office productivity software suite, and Copilot for Microsoft 365. Azure OpenAI has seen a particularly strong uptake, now counting more than 65% of the Fortune 500 as customers.\nCEO Satya Nadella has repeatedly said that he sees AI as the next major computing platform. The reported $13 billion investment in OpenAI is a sign of the company's conviction in AI and its belief that it needs to lead that transition or get left behind, as it did with mobile.\nMore recently, Microsoft has begun diversifying away from OpenAI. It has been adding both internal and third-party models to products like Microsoft 365 Copilot and Azure, including DeepSeek's R1.\nThe long-term implications for its relationship with OpenAI are unclear, but Microsoft seems to think it's wise to hedge its bets in the AI race. The relationship continues to evolve, but Microsoft sees the start-up's technology as critical for its AI strategy.\nMicrosoft is harnessing the power of AI in other ways, too, including automated clinical documentation in healthcare to reduce paperwork and administrative needs. It's also using Azure to allow customers to build custom AI tools. It launched Azure AI Foundry in November 2024, enabling its customers to create and manage AI apps and agents. As of April 2025, developers at more than 70,000 companies are using it.\n4. CoreWeave\nCoreWeave, which had its initial public offering (IPO) in March 2025, may be the closest thing to a pure-play AI stock on the market, and it launched the first major AI IPO. Its cloud infrastructure platform was designed specifically for AI, and it counts customers like Nvidia, OpenAI, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft as part of its core customer base. Nvidia and OpenAI are both investors in the company.\nCoreWeave has grown at an incredible pace over the last three years, going from generating almost no revenue in 2022 to $1.9 billion in 2024. Between 2022 and 2024, revenue grew by more than 100 times.\nCoreWeave's business is risky since Microsoft accounts for 62% of its revenue, meaning the business would suffer significantly if Microsoft were to pull back on spending with the platform. In its first-quarter 2025 report, CoreWeave said that no single company accounted for more than half of its backlog, a sign that its customer concentration is improving.\nThe company announced plans for a $6 billion data center in July. It's also acquiring Core Scientific, which will bulk up its AI infrastructure with 1.3 gigawatts (GW) in power capacity.\nIf you're looking for direct exposure to AI, CoreWeave is a good option since essentially all of its revenue is driven by demand for computing power to run generative AI programs. However, the stock is risky, as CoreWeave has a high debt burden, large capital expenditures, and is deeply unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles basis (GAAP).\n5. Meta Platforms\nUnlike the other big tech companies on this list, Meta Platforms doesn't have a cloud computing business, but it's investing just as much in AI as peers like Alphabet. Meta AI, the company's chatbot, is available on its apps (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) and had 1 billion monthly active users as of May. Meta continues to update its Llama large language model, which is now up to Llama 4.\nIt's also allowing its advertisers to use AI creative tools for things like background and video generation and ad copy. AI is involved in ad targeting as well, and the company aims to fully automate advertising with AI by 2026.\nAdditionally, the company is incorporating AI in its hardware division, including its Ray-Ban smart glasses, which offer a built-in camera, open-ear audio, and a range of hands-free features. Its Meta Quest headsets are also connected to Meta AI, allowing users to tap into the power of AI through the devices.\nIn June, it acquired 49% of data-labeling specialist Scale AI for $14.8 billion and brought Scale CEO Alexandr Wang on to run an AI research lab at Meta. The tech giant has also made a number of smaller acquisitions in AI. Management sees AI at the core of its business and driving its transformation across areas such as advertising, experiences, and devices.\nMachine learning\nMachine learning stocks\nAll the stocks above use machine learning technologies. However, if you're looking for even more options, here are two others worth considering:\nPalantir\nPalantir (PLTR -0.92%) has been one of the top-performing AI stocks. The company provides cloud software and specializes in data fusion that helps its customers make important insights by connecting disparate pieces of information hidden in data.\nIt also launched its AI Platform (AIP) in 2023, which has helped accelerate its growth. Palantir deploys machine learning models on top of data foundations and continuously improves them to ensure they become more useful.\nTesla\nTesla is best known for its electric vehicles (EVs). CEO Elon Musk sees AI as the future of the company, and machine learning and neural networks are very much at the center of the company's autonomous vehicle and Optimus autonomous robot projects.\nTesla introduced its driverless Cybercab in October 2024, and the company hopes to begin producing the vehicles by 2026. It launched its robotaxi network in June, though with just a handful of vehicles, and Musk envisions the company expanding to other cities in the near future. Musk has said Tesla's automation technology could make it the most valuable company in the world.\nDeep learning\nDeep learning stocks\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain. It's the most advanced kind of AI and is crucial in technologies like self-driving cars. Deep learning is advancing in areas such as preventive healthcare, where predictive algorithms are necessary. It differs from machine learning in that it doesn't require human input.\nNvidia is among the companies closely associated with deep learning. Its GPU chips use deep learning to power data centers and enable autonomous driving and cloud computing, among other functions.\nAlphabet has exposure to deep learning through a number of its businesses, including its autonomous vehicle start-up, Waymo. It also owns DeepMind, a deep learning platform that can diagnose eye diseases, predict the shapes of proteins, and accelerate the scientific discovery process.\nRelated investing topics\nA growth business\nAI is a growth business\nAccording to International Data Corporation, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to grow from $235 billion in 2024 to more than $631 billion in 2028. While the AI market is already large and still growing quickly, plenty of companies can profit from AI. Although picking stocks in a growth industry comes with a lot of uncertainty, these top AI stocks are all worth considering.\nFAQ\nArtificial intelligence stocks: FAQ\nWhat is the best AI stock to buy?\nArtificial intelligence is a fast-moving technology, and AI stocks will likely be volatile as the sector evolves. AI stocks that have attracted the most attention include Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet, but finding the best stock to buy is also a matter of price and valuation, which changes quickly.\nIs it good to buy Nvidia stock?\nNvidia has jumped into the lead among semiconductor companies in making AI chips and accelerators, and it has the competitive advantages to help it stay there. The semiconductor sector can also be highly cyclical, and pricing can change rapidly.\nAdditionally, there's the potential for unexpected surprises, such as the DeepSeek launch, which sent AI stocks like Nvidia plunging. If Nvidia can maintain its lead in AI chips, the stock should continue to be a winner, but it will likely be volatile since the AI landscape is still developing.\nWhat is the biggest AI company?\nCurrently, the biggest company that has made AI central to its business model is Nvidia, with a market cap that has soared past $4 trillion. The tech giant is at the center of the AI revolution, with components that are fueling AI applications and in high demand by major cloud infrastructure companies and others.\nIs AI good for investing?\nArtificial intelligence is likely to shake up the economy and the business world, creating opportunities in the stock market. Whether AI is good for investing will depend on the company, but there will be winners from the new technology.\nWhat company is No. 1 in AI?\nCurrently, Nvidia is broadly considered the leader in AI technology. The company has a monopoly-like market share in the data center GPU market, and its revenue has more than tripled since ChatGPT launched. Nvidia isn't guaranteed to remain the leader, though. Competition is on the way, and new technologies can change quickly.\nWill AI start-ups challenge tech giants?\nTech giants aren't feeling a significant threat from start-ups yet, but there are some signs that competition is on the rise. Alphabet stock, for example, fell when Apple said it was considering making AI search engines available on Safari, directly competing with Google.\nThe tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft also show that start-ups could begin to pose more of a threat to the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, though they are unlikely to derail their growth."

The earnings season shows a shift in the restaurant sector, with casual dining gaining share at the expense of quick\u2011service chains, while tariffs loom as a potential macro risk. These developments suggest continued upside for AI\u2011related equities and semiconductor stocks, but caution for the broader consumer\u2011discretionary space amid trade\u2011policy uncertainty.",
