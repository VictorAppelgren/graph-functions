      "feedback": "The draft is a non‑starter for Argos: it talks about ETH but never ties the view to a **canonical handle** (e.g., ust10y, dxy, spx, etc.), never states a **direction or magnitude** (bp/%), and offers no **dated catalyst window** or clear causal chain. According to the Acceptance Gate, this fails both criteria and must be rejected or rewritten.  \n\n**Actionable edits**  \n1. **Drop the ETH focus** entirely.  \n2. Pick a theme that maps to a canonical handle in the coverage pillars (e.g., UST 10‑yr, DXY, SPX, or a commodity).  \n3. State a clear directional view (e.g., “UST 10‑yr yields will rise 10–15 bp over the next 12 months”) with a magnitude range.  \n4. Provide a catalyst window (e.g., “Fed’s September 2025 policy meeting, 15‑Oct‑2025 ECB policy shift”) and a causal transmission path (policy → rates → term premium → yields).  \n5. Cite at least one source ID for the claim and the catalyst.  \n\nWithout these elements the draft cannot be accepted.",
