  "title": "OpenAI\u2019s New Open Source Models Are A Very Big Deal: 3 Reasons Why",
  "description": "This article discusses OpenAI new open source model, china vs US in AI, and implications for AI technology roadmap for companies",
  "content": "The announcement this week of new open source models from OpenAI has significant implications for the industry. Executives should pay close attention as they refine their AI technology roadmaps. Until now, OpenAI\u2019s AI models have been closed source and expensive, especially compared to open source alternatives\u2014particularly those from China, which offer approximately 90% of the performance at 90% lower cost.\n\nOn August 5, OpenAI released two new open source AI models: gpt-oss-120b (a 120-billion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts model) and gpt-oss-20b (a smaller, 20-billion-parameter model). Both are available under the permissive Apache 2.0 license, enabling free download, customization, and local deployment. These models are designed for reasoning tasks, tool use, and agentic capabilities, with a 128K context window. Notably, they can run on a laptop or smartphone. However, they are text-only and do not support multimodal inputs such as images or video.\n\nEarly feedback from developers has been largely positive. Developer Simon Willison highlighted their efficiency and noted that gpt-oss-20b can run on consumer hardware, such as a high-end laptop with a 16GB GPU. I am impressed by the near-parity with OpenAI\u2019s proprietary models, such as o4-mini, on reasoning benchmarks. While some developers noted potential performance issues, these new models are remarkably strong initial efforts and are highly competitive with leading Chinese open source models.\n\nThis Is a Big Deal for Three Reasons\n\u2022 Key Development in the U.S.-China AI Race: These new models represent a major advance in the ongoing AI competition between the U.S. and China. Chinese open source models like DeepSeek, Qwen, and Kimi have set the standard, and OpenAI\u2019s latest offerings narrow the gap.\n\u2022 Viable On-Premise GenAI Deployment Option: OpenAI is now a credible option for on-premise generative AI deployments. Increasingly, companies\u2014especially those in regulated industries\u2014are implementing GenAI applications for their most sensitive processes on-premise computers, beyond the reach of hyperscalers and cloud providers. Previously, OpenAI did not offer an on-premise solution, and many organizations found Meta\u2019s Llama, a leading non-Chinese open source model, underwhelming.\n\u2022 Local AI Models for Physical Products: OpenAI\u2019s new models are now an alternative for companies that need to run local AI models on physical products such as cars, smartphones, and consumer electronics.\n\nOpenAI has maintained market leadership since the introduction of ChatGPT 3.5 and continues to set the pace. The launch of these open source models marks a \u201cgame on\u201d moment for on-premise and on-device markets. AI vendors in these segments now face a formidable new competitor.\n\u2022 Encourage your AI team to test OpenAI\u2019s new open source models, especially if on-premise deployment is a priority.\n\u2022 Consider these models as tools to lower the total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI applications in production, particularly as firms manage increasing costs from expanded AI usage by employees, customers, and AI agents.\n\u2022 If your organization supports open source, consider contributing improvements to help maintain U.S. competitiveness in the AI race against China.\n\nThe market for AI model is advancing at lightening speed and the China-US AI arms races has heated up. Monitoring these developers are critical for your AI strategy.",
