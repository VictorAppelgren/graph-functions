  "title": "Why Goldman Sachs says the 'Goldilocks' stock market may get hit",
  "description": "Despite calm conditions, Goldman sees hidden threats in the market's stability.",
  "content": "Investors' \"Goldilocks\" summer could be coming to an end.\n\nAfter months of ideal market conditions, Goldman Sachs (GS) warns that underlying risks could send stocks tumbling. The current backdrop of stable economic growth, moderate inflation, and a strong earnings season \u2014 fueled by Big Tech's AI spend and hopes for an interest rate cut \u2014 has created a summer of rally.\n\nBut a key factor behind the markets' stability has been a \"volatility reset,\" with investors accepting lower returns on riskier assets as the market avoids sharp price swings. Goldman noted that during \"Goldilocks\" regimes, low market and economic volatility typically lead to more stable returns. However, the bank warned that this calm could quickly turn into a storm if growth slows or the Fed tightens monetary policy.\n\n\"There is latent risk of unwinds in the event of negative growth and rate shocks,\u201d Goldman Sachs analyst Christian Mueller-Glissmann wrote in a new note.\n\nDespite the stability, Goldman's \"equity asymmetry framework\" \u2014 which combines market volatility data and broader economic indicators \u2014 suggests the chance of a major market rally is relatively low in the current climate, as large rallies typically occur during recoveries, when the market is bouncing back from a significant downturn.\n\nHowever, the risk of a \"drawdown,\" or a sharp market decline, is now elevated, and this risk has only increased recently. According to Goldman, such drawdowns are often triggered by factors like high stock valuations and a weakening business cycle. As the S&P 500 (^GSPC) notches a string of record highs in 2025, there's little room for mistake in a market priced for perfection.\n\nGoldman also noted the rally in the US stock market has been driven largely by a handful of large-cap tech stocks. While this has helped push the overall market higher, it also suggests that broader market participation is lacking.\n\n\"The US equity rally has again been concentrated in large cap US Tech stocks, and this has come alongside signs of more speculative behaviour among retail traders,\" the firm notes. This concentration could pose a problem if these tech companies face any setbacks or if the broader market loses momentum.\n\nAnother concern that Goldman raised is the potential impact of macroeconomic challenges in the second half of the year, including the ongoing impact of tariffs on global growth, continued uncertainty around Fed policy, and growing geopolitical risks.\n\nIn the months ahead, these factors could weigh on the economy, and by extension, drag on corporate earnings and stock prices. \"In our baseline view, macro headwinds are likely to pick up,\" Mueller-Glissmann wrote.",

      "text": "President Trump said he would unveil tariffs on semiconductor imports over the next couple of weeks as he prepares to expand his tariff agenda to different sectors.\n\"I'll be setting tariffs next week and the week after on ... chips \u2014 chips and semiconductors,\" he told reporters Friday.\nTrump has already suggested he could set tariffs on chip imports around 100%. On Friday, he floated an even bigger number. \"I'm going to have a rate that is going to be 200%, 300%,\" he said.\nThe president has also promised duties on pharmaceutical imports in the near future.\nMeanwhile, tariffs are starting to show up in economic data for the first time in a significant way. Wholesale inflation surged in July, rising by its fastest pace in around three years and stunning market observers.\nSo far, inflation data has shown little impact since Trump began rolling out sweeping duties in the spring. But as the tariffs become more engrained in the US economy, economists expect more data points to align with this week's Producer Price Index report \u2014 perhaps most notably in next month's Consumer Price Index.\nSo far, stock markets haven't been phased. US stock indexes hit all-time highs this week as the world adapts. New data this week also showed that tariffs have brought in billions in revenue, though economists say a portion of that is already coming in the form of price increases on consumers.\nOn the negotiations front, Trump signed an executive order extending the tariff truce between the US and China for another 90 days, pushing trade negotiations out to November. Average US tariff rates on Chinese goods are currently around 55%, according to Bloomberg.\nEarlier this month, Trump unveiled \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of US trade partners (which you can see in the graphic below).\nThe next negotiations to watch are Canada, Mexico, and China in the coming months.\nThe tariffs are also facing legal limbo. Multiple challenges to Trump's tariffs are pending in US federal courts. The one garnering the most attention is a case heard by an appeals court in July. The Court could nullify or uphold the duties at any time.\nInflation expectations rose from July to August, indicating that consumers remain uncertain about President Trump's trade policies.\nYear-ahead inflation expectations increased to 4.9% from 4.5% last month, according to the University of Michigan's survey of consumers. Long-run inflation expectations also rose to 3.9% in August from 3.4% in July.\n\"Overall, consumers are no longer bracing for the worst-case scenario for the economy feared in April when reciprocal tariffs were announced and then paused,\" Joanne Hsu, the university's Surveys of Consumers director, wrote. \"However, consumers continue to expect both inflation and unemployment to deteriorate in the future.\"\nConsumer sentiment also deteriorated month over month, falling for the first time in four months. The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index fell to 58.6 from 61.7 a month ago.\nPresident Trump said Friday he is planning on unveiling tariffs on semiconductor imports over the next two weeks, hinting that those duties could reach as high as 300%.\nApplied Materials' shares sink on weak China demand, tariff risks\nShares in Applied Materials (AMAT) sank 14% before the bell on Friday after the chip equipment maker issued weak fourth-quarter forecasts on sluggish China demand, fueling concerns over tariff-related risks.\nChina's economy lags in July under pressure from tariffs and a weak property market\nChina's economy lagged in July as factory output and retails sales slowed and house prices dropped, according to data released on Friday. President Trump's tariffs have added to uncertainty on exports and are looming over the world's second-largest economy. Concerns linger despite Trump extending a pause in sharp hikes in import duties for 90 days, beginning Monday, following a 90-day pause that began in May.\nAn interesting spot from this week's inflation data: Prices for the reliable, potassium-heavy banana have jumped to their highest price ever recorded.\nBanana prices peaked around $0.64 per pound in the post-COVID inflation wave and then went on a slow downward trajectory. That is, until April 2025, when President Trump announced his first wave of sweeping tariffs. Prices are now hovering near $0.66 per pound.\nAs the Yale Budget Lab chief Ernie Tedeschi noted on X, the average tariff rate on banana imports went from virtually nothing to very much something as Trump imposed tariffs on most US trading partners.\nThat's nuts!\nJenny McCall\nTapestry forecasts annual profit below estimates on tariff pain\nTapestry (TPR) stock fell 8% before the bell on Thursday after the Coach handbag maker forecast annual profit below estimates. The company cited higher costs due to tariffs that have hit its margins.\nTariff confusion drives record volume at Los Angeles Port\n(Bloomberg) \u2014 The Port of Los Angeles said it handled the highest container volume in its 117-year history last month, as uncertainty over President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs drives shippers to front-load cargoes.\nAlready the busiest port in the country, LA moved more than 1 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in July, an 8.5% increase from a year ago, the operator said on Wednesday. That includes containers entering and exiting its terminals, with loaded imports rising by a similar percentage to nearly 544,000 TEUs. The total volume handled was 14.2% higher than in June.\nPharma tariffs are likely weeks away, Reuters reports\nUS tariffs on pharmaceutical imports are coming but not imminent, Reuters reported Wednesday, citing unnamed sources. Trump has previously warned duties on the drug industry could reach as much as 250%.\nSwiss say tariffs could raise costs for US F-35A jets\nThe original price of the 36 fighter jets Switzerland is buying from the United States could go up by more than $1 billion due to the impacts of tariffs.\nAI boom could help manufacturers adapt to global tariff landscape\nMark Bendeich of Reuters details how the confluence of supply chain disruption from Trump's tariff policy and the rise of AI software solutions is leading to increased innovation among manufacturers.\nRichard Howells, SAP vice president and supply chain specialist, emphasized that the uncertainty surrouding Trump's trade policy is driving the technology push.\n\"That's how it was during the financial crisis, Brexit and COVID,\" Howells stated. \"And it's what we're seeing now.\"\nGE Appliances to invest over $3B in US, moving from China and Mexico\nGE Appliances will move production of its refrigerators, gas ranges and water heaters from China and Mexico, investing over $3 billion to expand plans in five US states.\nTariffs bring in record $27.7 billion in July as Trump calls haul 'incredible for our country'\nYahoo Finance's Brett LoGiurato and Ben Werschkul report:\nJenny McCall\nXi takes aim at US \u2018protectionism\u2019 in phone call with Lula\nLeaders of the BRICS nations seem to be in talks. Brazilian President Lula spoke with China's leader Xi after meeting with India and Russia. This outreach comes after President Trump pulled Brazil into his trade war. During the call, China's Xi urged for coordinated efforts against US protectionism.\nSoybean futures fall after Trump extends trade truce with China\nSoybean (ZS=F) prices fell back below $10 a bushel on Tuesday, after news of the US-China trade truce extension. Traders saw this truce as likely delaying major grain-purchasing deals between the two nations until later this year.\nEuropean Union awaits US follow-up on trade deal promises\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union could not say when a joint statement on tariffs with the United States would be ready, nor when the White House would issue an executive order on European car import duties, a spokesperson said on Tuesday.\nThe EU and U.S. reached a framework trade agreement at the end of July but only the 15% baseline tariff on European exports had so far come into effect, as of last week. EU officials previously said a joint statement would follow the deal \"very soon\" along with executive orders from U.S. President Donald Trump on key carve-outs.\n\"It is an agreement that we believe is strong and the best we could have ... Of course, we expect the U.S. to take further steps that are part of this agreement but I don't believe at this stage we can put a timeline on these engagements,\" the European Commission spokesperson said.\n'Climate of uncertainty' remains after China-US trade extension\nZhou Mi, an expert at the Ministry of Commerce-backed Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told Bloomberg that there remains a \"climate of uncertainty\" despite the latest 90-day pause on additional tariffs enacted by the US on Monday.\nThe Trump administration \u201cfrequently sends out a range of signals, often through its negotiation tactics and public statements \u2014 some of which even contradict each other,\u201d Zhou told Bloomberg.\n\u201cThis creates a climate of uncertainty that makes businesses and markets increasingly concerned about the stability and outlook for economic and trade policies between China and the US, as well as the US and other countries.\"\nAverage US tariffs on good imported from China currently sit at 55%."

      "text": "In this article:\nCracks are forming in an otherwise resilient economy, and the Federal Reserve could soon face a no-win choice.\n\u201cThe market wants to see a rate cut in September,\u201d Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual, said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid.\nAlthough the Fed left rates unchanged as expected at its July 30 meeting, Schutte says the bigger question is whether policymakers will pivot toward easing it later this year. The market has currently assigned a rough 58% probability to a September rate cut, making it a near \u201ccoin toss.\u201d\nDespite the uncertainty, retail investors continue to pour money into equities, fueling market gains. Schutte points to an \u201cinsatiable appetite\u201d among this group, which could help cushion markets even if the Fed signals disappoint.\nIf expectations for a cut keep building, markets will likely rally. But if the Fed leans away from easing, a modest pullback could follow.\nAccording to Schutte, the Fed, like markets, remains uncertain about the economic outlook and appears increasingly divided, Schutte said. Some members, like Governor Christopher Waller, have floated the idea of voting for a rate cut even sooner. While dissenting voices alone aren't decisive, they reflect broader indecision at the central bank.\nOne key wild card is the new tariff deal announced by President Trump, which slapped a 25% tariff on imports from India. Schutte said the market has mostly shrugged off the latest tariff threats, assuming the White House might reverse course if necessary. But he warns that could be a risky bet, especially if businesses start passing tariff costs onto consumers.\nRead more: The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs\nUnderlying economic data already points to weakness. Companies like Procter & Gamble (PG) and Starbucks (SBUX) have flagged softening demand. Kraft Heinz (KHC) has emerged as a winner, posting robust quarterly earnings fueled by inflation-weary consumers opting to cook more at home.\nEven so, real private domestic purchases have slowed sharply, even before the full impact of tariffs. \u201cYou are seeing a consumer that is beginning to weaken,\u201d Schutte said. If companies hike prices, the Fed may soon face a tough choice between rising inflation and slowing growth.\nMeanwhile, Morgan Stanley maintained its baseline view that the Fed will not cut interest rates in 2025. However, in a new report, the firm outlined growing downside risks that could push policymakers to act sooner, even as early as September.\nRead more: How the Fed rate decision affects your bank accounts, loans, credit cards, and investments"

      "text": "In this article:\nThe most speculative corners of the market may be getting too popular, too fast.\nIn a research note published Monday, JPMorgan warned that the rush into high-beta, momentum-driven stocks such as Palantir (PLTR), Coinbase (COIN), and Nvidia (NVDA) has reached \"100th percentile\" levels of crowding, the most extreme positioning in 30 years.\nThe crowding \"not only presents a risk for this segment, but is also a red flag for the broader market, implying there is rising complacency in the short term,\" strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas wrote.\nInvestors may be overly confident that the AI-fueled rally has more room to run, with names like Tesla (TSLA) trading at over 160x forward P/E, compared to around 22x for the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\nThe high-beta crowding, which includes low-value and speculative growth stocks, is happening rapidly. Positioning surged from the 25th to the 100th percentile in three months, the fastest climb since the firm began tracking the data three decades ago. JPMorgan notes that short interest has also dropped sharply, meaning fewer investors are hedging against downside risks.\nIt's the \"third-extreme overcrowding\" episode this year, according to the firm. In January, investors piled into AI-linked megacaps. In April, they sought safety in low-volatility names amid concerns about tariffs. Now, the hot money is chasing speculative tech and meme-adjacent plays, leaving the market more vulnerable to a pullback.\nRead more: How to protect your money during turmoil, stock market volatility\nWhen April's low-volatility crowding began to unwind, it did so within three months, the fastest unwind on record. Following this reset, Lakos-Bujas' team recommends getting back into lower-volatility names that have lagged the broader market.\nTheir blue chip stock picks have underperformed the market by 19% since April but may be poised to outperform if speculative bets start to unwind.\n\"Low vol once again presents an attractive risk/reward, especially with looming tariff deadlines (Aug. 1), adverse seasonality, and aggressive investor positioning,\" Lakos-Bujas wrote.\nTop picks in the group include Coca Cola (KO), Allegion (ALLE), Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), CME Group (CME), and CBOE Global Markets (CBOE).\nNow may be the time to rotate back into safety, per the note.\nInvestors may be buying into a \"Goldilocks\" scenario of solid economic growth, falling inflation, and a more dovish Fed. But JPMorgan sees that optimism as fragile, and crowded AI trades could be subject to quick reversals. And risky stocks that are not linked to AI are at even higher risk of reversal, the firm added."

The SPX had an extremely quiet July, without one day when the index moved 1% or more in either direction and with 10 all-time closing highs. Both the Nasdaq and the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) had only a single 1% move in July. As such, in only one day, August is living up to its reputation as a volatile month. The SPX fell to trendline support off the lows since May 23 and bounced. But there was a bearish five- and 13-day exponential moving average (EMA) crossover. In addition, the index broke its 10- and 21-day EMAs, the first break of the rising 21-day EMA since 2/21. That break just happened to start the last correction in March (which ended in early April). Thursday's reversal on the SPX represented a bearish engulfing candlestick, which sometimes indicates a rally is over. Also ominous is that it occurred on heavy volume, though Friday's volume was a bit lighter than Thursday's. The volume on the QQQ was high on Thursday and even higher on Friday. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is slightly below 50, a warning signal; the Vortex Indicator has gone bearish; and the 21-day rate-of-change (ROC) is very close to moving into negative territory, which also would be a sell signal. Initial chart support for the SPX sits at 6,200, with the rising 50-day at 6,130. Chart support from the peak in February is at 6,140, with additional support from the peak in May at 5,970. The rising 21-week EMA is just above 6,000, and the rising 50-week simple average comes in at 5,870. A minor 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the rally from April sits at 6,050, while a 38.2% giveback targets 5,820. The VIX spiked 22% on Friday, the largest one-day jump since April.\nDaily \u2013 Vickers Top Buyers & Sellers for 07/28/2025\nThe Vickers Top Buyers & Sellers is a daily report that identifies the five companies the largest insider purchase transactions based on the dollar value of the transactions as well as the five companies the largest insider sales transactions based on the dollar value of the transactions.\nGoldman Sachs Continues to Perform Well Behind Leading Investment Banking and Trading Franchises\nGoldman Sachs is a storied financial institution, founded in 1869 and best known for its role as a leading global investment bank. The firm has a sprawling reach across global financial centers and has been the leading provider of global merger and acquisition advisory services, by revenue, for the past 20 years. Since the global financial crisis, Goldman has expanded its offerings into more stable fee-based businesses like asset and wealth management, which comprised roughly 30% of post-provision revenue at the end of 2024. The bank holding company generates revenue from investment banking, global market making and trading, lending, asset management, wealth management, and a small and declining portfolio of consumer credit card loans.\nRatingPrice TargetRaising target\nThe Goldman Sachs Group provides investment banking, securities, and investment management services to corporations, financial institutions, governments, and high-net-worth individuals worldwide.

  "argos_summary": "Goldman Sachs warns that the current \"Goldilocks\" market\u2014characterized by steady growth, low inflation, and strong earnings\u2014may be ending as risks such as slowing growth, Fed tightening, and high valuations could trigger a sharp drawdown. The firm notes that volatility has reset to a calm level, but this calm is fragile and could quickly turn into a storm if macro conditions deteriorate. Concentration of the rally in large\u2011cap tech stocks and speculative AI\u2011driven plays adds to the fragility, while rising tariffs, geopolitical tensions, and uncertain Fed policy further heighten downside risk. Investors are urged to consider rotating back into lower\u2011volatility, defensive names as the market faces potential turbulence.",
