The owner of the shoe store, Sole & Laces, was carrying out an after-hours sale with a customer when the attempted robbery took place, according to property manager John Alle.\nA second person, who allegedly knew the customer taking part in the private sale, entered the store and pepper-sprayed the owner, according to police. There was a struggle and the store owner, who had a legally owned gun, shot the suspect, police said.\nThe suspect was taken to a local hospital and later died from his injuries, police said.\nIn an effort to help businesses bounce back from the pandemic, Santa Monica\u2019s City Council approved a motion Tuesday to convert its Third Street Promenade into an entertainment zone by allowing public drinking with beverages from participating businesses.\nThe customer who arranged for the private sale, later identified as Karen Melikyan , 41, was arrested on suspicion of being involved in the attempted robbery, according to authorities. He was booked on suspicion of murder, robbery and conspiracy, police said.\nThe name of the person killed in the shooting was not released pending notification to the kin.\nThe incident appears to be targeted and involved people who knew each other, police said.\n\u201cThere is no ongoing threat to the public,\u201d the Santa Monica Police Department said in a news release.\nPolice said the shopkeeper, who was also not identified, is cooperating with the authorities.\nThe investigation remains ongoing."

Officers have arrested a male suspect.\nOne victim, who appeared to have been struck by a stray bullet, was located near the intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and Alvarado Street, according to LAPD Det. Meghan Aguilar.\nInitially, police believed all six of the injured were victims. They later said one was an assailant, who is in critical but stable condition, according to police. It was not clear who shot the alleged attacker.\nShots were fired near a taco stand in Westlake early Thursday, injuring four people, including bystanders. Police have detained two people for questioning.\n\u201cToday the mayor and I are surging resources to this area to enforce a Zero Tolerance policy on crime \u2014 if you break the law you will be arrested,\u201d LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell said in a statement. \u201cPlease know that my top priority is keeping you safe, and I will continue to hold anyone who threatens your sense of security accountable.\u201d\nThe victims were described as four adult males and one adult female. All were transported to local hospitals. Three victims are in stable condition.\nThe apprehended male suspect walked up to a group of people and opened fire with a handgun, police said. The suspect then ran southbound on Alvarado Street to an unknown location.\nAguilar said investigators at the scene recovered bullet casings from two weapons, indicating that two additional shooters were involved in the attacks.\nLaw enforcement sources said the shooting stemmed from a confrontation between rival gang members who opened fired at each other. The victims, police sources said, were bystanders.\nLopez: \u2018Why are you messing with me for smoking fentanyl?\u2019 The tough task of policing MacArthur Park\nHow can police deal with gangs, organized retail theft, addiction and untreated mental illness in MacArthur Park? The Rampart Division captain says they don\u2019t have \u2018the right tools.\u2019\nVideo taken by ANG News showed a trail of blood on the sidewalk leading to a man lying in a pool of blood while paramedics tended to his wounds. Another video showed a man with a bloody lip that was nearly torn off.\nThe shooting is the latest among the crime problems that have beset MacArthur Park. The area is known for gang violence and drug use, much of it by the homeless people living in and around the park. The owner of nearby Langer\u2019s Deli has threatened to close if the city doesn\u2019t clean up the area.\nCity, police and community leaders have spent months fretting over how best to handle the intertwined crises at the park. A proposed cleanup operation that involved hundreds of police officers has been delayed twice, most recently because police resources were needed to respond to the ongoing wildfires.\nThe shootings also bring another dose of stress for the neighborhood\u2019s immigrant community that is already on edge amid fears of mass deportations that the Trump administration has promised to carry out."
