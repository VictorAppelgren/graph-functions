  "description": "Around two dozen soldiers stood guard outside Washington, Union Station in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 14. They had little to do.",
  "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 At Union Station, the familiar flow of tourists and travelers fresh off trains and buses poured out of the colonnaded entrance blocks from the Capitol building.\n\nThere was one new presence \u2013 dozens of National Guard troops in camouflage fatigues.\n\nSoldiers patrolled for hours outside the main station in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 14, just days after President Donald Trump announced a military and law enforcement clampdown on \"out of control\" crime in a city where crime has statistically declined.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump seized control of local law enforcement and deployed 800 National Guardsmen from the District of Columbia in response to what he framed as a public safety emergency for the city. Advocates, lawmakers and many residents have pushed back on that characterization, which defies crime data.\n\nIn the rest of the country, the president cannot deploy troops in a policing capacity without the consent of the state's governor. Washington is an exception \u2013 Trump has the green light to deploy troops to take on law enforcement functions under his sole command. The Army has said the troops have been tasked with guarding National Park Service property, such as the National Mall, and to help law enforcement with administrative duties and transportation. They are unarmed, but officials told USA TODAY that soldiers could be ordered to carry weapons if their assignment changes.\n\nAround a third of the 2,400 National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., have been tapped for Trump's mission. Those who live close enough can return home to sleep, while others, whose civilian homes are farther from the capital, will stay in base facilities and hotels.\n\nOne soldier standing next to an idling Humvee outside Union Station, who lives too far away to sleep at home, said he had received no indication how long he would be deployed. Like his peers, he was not authorized to speak on the record. He told USA TODAY he would go home after this assignment ended.\n\nNational Guardsmen first appeared on this deployment in front of the Washington Monument on Aug. 12, according to photos posted by commanders and news reports. Two days later, they turned up at Union Station and stayed for much longer in the baking heat alongside, rotating in and out with bevies of law enforcement from multiple agencies sweeping the area.\n\nAs the morning crawled on and temperatures rose to the high 80s, several more sage-green Humvees filled with soldiers pulled up to join the four already parked at the corners of the station\u2019s outside plaza. The military vehicles, known for transporting troops across desert terrain in Iraq and Afghanistan, now squeezed through congested traffic alongside taxis and Ubers dropping off commuters and tourists.\n\nAt one point, some troops rushed towards a traffic kerfuffle on the side of the square. An unresponsive driver had run her car onto the curb and struck a street sign, according to a man who witnessed the incident. By then, the driver who hit the sign had fled the scene. The man fist-bumped several guardsmen and drove away.\n\nPolice cars cruised past regularly. At another moment, a parking security attendant was injured by a passing motorist. A firetruck arrived, then an ambulance, then another one. A group of police on bikes rushed to the station entrance, only to realize the shouting they were responding to was coming from a traffic attendant urging cars forward. \u201cOh, it\u2019s the security guard shouting,\u201d one said before they rushed away. The drone of sirens in the distance was near constant.\n\nThe National Guard troops checked in with the injured security person, but eventually returned to their posts.\n\nAs travelers awaited rides, suitcases in hand, some snapped pictures of the troops. A few posed with them for a photo.\n\nThe majority of passersby turned a curious eye toward the soldiers. Others shared their opinions directly.\n\n\u201cShame on you,\u201d one woman yelled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to do this.\u201d\n\n\u201cTalk about a waste of resources,\u201d another shouted.\n\nOthers shared approval \u2013 a passing jogger gave a thumbs up and a smile.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m scared. I\u2019m afraid,\u201d said Nick Roelofs, 67, an American expat who lives in Stockholm, as he stood outside the station. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live in a police state, and I worry that\u2019s what it\u2019s become.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a waste of time and the people\u2019s money,\u201d said Lela Leonard, a 38-year-old Pittsburgh native visiting family in the capital. \u201cThey\u2019re just standing there.\u201d\n\nOthers expressed faith in the administration. \u201cMaybe he sees something that we don\u2019t see,\u201d Mohammed Osman, 25, said of Trump\u2019s justification for deploying the troops. \u201cIt\u2019s America. Nothing is going to happen to us.\u201d\n\nUnion Station, the turn-of-the-century train hub, has become a flashpoint in heated debates over crime rates in Washington.\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that crime, linked to homelessness and errant teenagers, is a city-wide crisis. Critics point out that crime rates are down this year compared with last.\n\n\u201cGreatness is a choice,\u201d the Department of Homeland Security captioned an Aug. 12 post to its official X account of a 1940s-era illustration of the station showing trolley cars and colorful cars outside a neat and unpopulated station.\n\nUnion Station reached its zenith in the 1940s, when train travel was booming. Its self-described \u201clow point came in 1981,\u201d when pieces of the roof crashed into the main waiting room during a heavy rain, according to its website.\n\nIn recent years, the station has been the site of overdoses and assaults and it lost more than half its stores within two decades, according to a 2022 Washington Post report. A man was fatally shot at the station in February. Six teenage girls were arrested in connection with the violent attack of a woman outside the station the same month.\n\nWith the National Guard standing close by on Aug. 14, some travelers said they were more concerned about the military presence than what it was meant to prevent.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no crime that should need a military base in Washington, D.C.,\u201d Osman said.",

      "text": "Trump says Washington is unsafe, but the data tells a more nuanced story\nIn Washington, crime is relatively high, but far from the highest in the country, and it has been on a downward trend.\nPresident Donald Trump is sending the National Guard to Washington to combat what he called \u201cbloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse.\u201d But crime data paints a much more nuanced picture of what\u2019s going on in the nation's capital.\nAmong major cities in the United States, Washington does have high rates of violent crime and murder. But it has a much lower rate of violent crime than some cities Trump hasn't spotlighted, such as Memphis, Tennessee.\nIn the District of Columbia, different types of crime tend to be concentrated in different parts of the city, and crime overall has been on a downward trend in recent years. The murder rate is far below its historic peak.\nThaddeus Johnson, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Council on Criminal Justice and a former police officer, said the capital is \u201con par\u201d with other big cities. He explained that \u2013 like many of its counterparts \u2013 the district saw crime increase during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and the years that followed, but it's now experiencing a decrease.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not perfect,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work to do.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what to know.\nWashington recently saw murders spike, then drop\nThe Metropolitan Police Department reported a 35% drop in violent crime and a 15% decrease in overall crime from 2023 to 2024. Matthew M. Graves, former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia who also served as the city\u2019s local prosecutor, cited these stats in January as a testament to his prosecutorial strategy.\nBetween 2023 and 2024, crime categories fell between 2% (theft not related to cars) and 64% (arson). But 2023 also saw 274 homicides reported, higher than any year since 2005, according to the Metropolitan Police Department.\n\u201cWe have to be mindful that we had almost historic peaks in these crimes, and so we\u2019re going to have to get back to par first,\u201d Johnson said, pointing to lower pre-pandemic crime levels in 2018 and 2019. \u201cAnd we\u2019re still working that way, and we\u2019re coming closer.\u201d\nViolent crime has been down in 2025\nViolent crime in Washington through Aug. 8, 2025, dropped 26% compared with the same period in 2024, according to data from the Metropolitan Police Department. That includes a 50% decrease in sexual abuse. Overall crime is down 7% so far. Motor vehicle theft is level, and burglary is down 20%.\nJohnson said 200 or so people tend to be responsible for much of the crime in a city like Washington. The crimes tend to be concentrated in Black and brown communities and happen between people who know one another, he said.\nViolent crime and property crime are concentrated\nViolent crime in Washington is highest in Ward 8, the southeastern corner of the city, which includes the low-income Anacostia area, according to an interactive map on the city government\u2019s website. It's followed by Wards 7 and 5 in the eastern part of the city. Violent crime is lowest in Ward 3 in the affluent northwest part of the city, bordering Maryland and across the Potomac River from Virginia.\nProperty crime is highest in Ward 2, a tourist-heavy area that includes the National Mall, the White House and other landmarks, and Ward 5, an area in the northeast part of the city that borders Maryland.\nWashington has a comparatively high murder rate\nWashington's rate of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter was 25.5 per 100,000 people in 2024, according to a USA TODAY analysis of the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting Program data. That places Washington at No. 5 among more than 30 cities with more than 500,000 people.\nThe FBI categorizes crimes differently from the Metropolitan Police Department, so the rate will differ slightly from the police department\u2019s data. But the categorization is consistent across the country, and the FBI is the best source for comparing local crime data nationally.\nHere is the ranking:\n- Memphis, Tennessee: 40.6\n- Baltimore: 34.8\n- Detroit: 31.2\n- Kansas City, Missouri: 27.6\n- Washington: 25.5\nWashington has 10th-highest violent crime rate among major U.S. cities\nWhen other violent crime is factored in, Washington ranks lower among large cities. The city\u2019s violent crime rate is 926 per 100,000 residents, according to USA TODAY\u2019s analysis of the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting Program data. Violent crime includes murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.\nHere is the ranking:\n- Memphis, Tennessee: 2,501\n- Detroit: 1,781\n- Baltimore: 1,606\n- Kansas City, Missouri: 1,547\n- Milwaukee: 1,431\n- Albuquerque, New Mexico: 1,182\n- Houston: 1,148\n- Nashville: 1,124\n- Denver: 993\n- Washington: 926\nCrime in DC used to be much higher\nA generation ago, crime in Washington was so high that the city earned the moniker the \"murder capital.\" The number of homicides increased steadily from 148 in 1985 to a peak 482 in 1991, according to a report by the Criminal Justice Research Center. Violent crime, especially murder, dropped dramatically between then and the COVID-19 pandemic."

      "text": "President Trump says other US cities could be next as he deploys National Guard to DC\n\"We're not going to lose our cities over this,\" Trump said as he mentioned plans to potentially expand his crackdown on crime to New York, Chicago, Baltimore and other cities. \"This will go further.\"\nWASHINGTON \u2015 President Donald Trump said he might expand his crackdown on crime in the nation's capital to other major U.S. cities as he announced plans to send 800 National Guard troops into Washington, D.C.\nTrump singled out New York City, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Chicago and Oakland, California during a Monday, Aug. 11, news conference as potential future targets in what would be a drastic escalation of federal presence on the streets of American cities.\n\"We're not going to lose our cities over this. This will go further. We're starting very strongly with D.C., and we're going to clean it up real quick,\" Trump said.\nTrump did not elaborate on his plans for other cities. But one of the two executive actions he signed Aug. 11 directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to coordinate with governors of states and \"authorize the orders of any additional members of the National Guard to active service, as he deems necessary and appropriate, to augment this mission.\"\n\"We're going to take back our capital,\" Trump said. \"And then we'll look at other cities also. But other cities are studying what we're doing.\"\nTrump warns cities to 'learn their lesson'\nEach of the cities that Trump mentioned are led by Democratic mayors in states with Democratic governors, who could be less likely to request the Trump administration's intervention than Republican governors who are political allies of the president.\n\"Other cities are hopefully watching this.... And maybe they\u2019ll self-clean up,\" Trump said, adding they could be targeted if \"they don't learn their lesson\" and study his administration's moves in Washington. He said he plans to look at New York City next \"and if we need to, we're going to do the same thing in Chicago.\"\nIn a separate executive order, Trump invoked authority under Section 740 of the Home Rule Act to take control of Washington\u2019s police department. The move, authorized by federal law as part of the District of Columbia's unique status as a federal enclave, is not an option for Trump elsewhere.\nSecretary of Army Daniel Driscoll is set to lead the National Guard\u2019s operation in Washington.\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon is also prepared to bring in additional National Guard units and other specialized units if needed. \"They will be strong. They will be tough. And they will stand with their law enforcement partners,\" Hegseth said.\n\"This is nothing new for DOD,\" he added, pointing to Trump\u2019s deployment of military troops at the United States-Mexico border to crack down on illegal immigration.\nTrump's authority to direct National Guard troops was challenged earlier this year after he tapped the California National Guard to quell protests over widespread deportations from increased immigration enforcement in the Los Angeles area. After Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged Trump's control over the troops, a judge ruled in favor of Trump.\nTrump reeled off a list of recent violent crimes in Washington, D.C. to justify his actions. Yet, volent crimes so far in 2025 are down 26% compared to last year, and homicides are down 12%, according to statistics compiled by the Metropolitian Police Department. Similarly, homicides in New York City are down in 2025 compared to the same time last year.\nMayors push back at Trump's threat\nAn FBI report released Aug. 5 found violent crime in 2024 dropped by 4.5% in the United States compared to 2023, with murder and non-negligent manslaughter decreasing by nearly 15%.\nThe U.S. Conference of Mayors, which represents about 1,400 mayors, responded to Trump's actions and threats by touting a \"nationwide success story\" of plummeting crime rates.\n\"Ultimately, the best public safety outcomes are delivered by local police departments and local officials, who know the communities,\" Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt, president of the mayors' conference, said in a statement. \"America\u2019s mayors never see takeovers by other levels of government as a tactic that has any track record of producing results.\"\nBaltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, in response to Trump singling out his city, said \"Baltimore is the safest it's been in over 50 years,\" adding that homicides are down about 28% in 2025.\n\"We still have real work to do to build on this progress,\" Scott said in a statement, \"but that work starts and ends here in Baltimore, with the local, state, and federal partners who have gotten us this far.\"\nContributing: Cybele Mayes-Osterman of USA TODAY\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison."

      "text": "National Guard troops arrive in DC under Trump's order to fight crime, reduce homelessness\nMayor Muriel Bowser sought to reassure residents in the nation's capital, adding that the National Guard deployment was unnecessary.\nMembers of the Washington, D.C., National Guard have reported for duty across the nation's capital on Aug. 12 under President Donald Trump's orders to fight crime and reduce homelessness in the city.\nAmong those deployed were members of the Guard's 273rd Military Police Company, whose commanders shared images on social media of armored Humvees parked next to the Washington Monument. Trump ordered 800 members of the guard into service, though not all have yet been deployed.\nTrump's decision to deploy the military drew sharp condemnation from Democrats across the country, who said the move raises civil-liberties concerns at a time when crime in D.C. is dropping.\n\"We're taking our capital back,\" Trump said on Aug. 11. \"We're taking it back.\"\nBecause D.C. falls under federal control, the president has the authority to call up the National Guard, and he also ordered that the city's Metropolitan Police Department be brought under Justice Department management. Mayor Muriel Bowser sought to reassure residents, saying that while violent crime remains a problem in the city, the national guard deployment was unnecessary.\n\"Violent crime in DC is at its lowest level in 30 years. We had an unacceptable spike in 2023, so we changed our laws and strategies,\" she said at a televised community meeting on August 12. \"Now, crime levels are not only down from 2023, but from before the pandemic. Our tactics are working, and we aren\u2019t taking our foot off the gas.\"\n'Physical presence' on DC streets\nBowser said Trump called up the guard for non-law enforcement purposes, indicating they would work in a support role to assist law enforcement officers. White House officials said there would be anywhere from 100 to 200 troops supporting law enforcement at any given time, primarily providing administrative and logistical support, along with a \"physical presence\" on the streets.\n\"We will continue to watch for that,\" Bowser said.\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said it would take time for all 800 guard members to move into position across the city.\n\"You will see them flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming weeks,\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said at an Aug. 12 news conference. \"They will be strong. They will be tough.\"\nAdvocates: Tougher enforcement does nothing to solve homelessness\nAdvocates for homeless people worried that the president's decision to send in troops would make life even harder for the roughly 900 people living on the city's streets.\n\"We're going to be removing homeless encampments from beautiful parks, which now, a lot of people can't walk on,\u201d Trump told reporters on Aug. 11, adding that his administration is getting \"rid of the people from underpasses and public spaces from all over the city.\"\nIn a statement, the National Homelessness Law Center said tougher enforcement does nothing to solve homelessness.\n\"Arresting or ticketing people for sleeping outside makes homelessness worse, wastes taxpayer money, and simply does not work,\" spokesman Jesse Rabinowitz said. \"The solution to homelessness is housing and supports, not handcuffs and jails.\"\nLongtime DC mayor answers questions from city residents\nBowser, the city's leader since 2015, held a virtual sit-down with city residents on Aug. 12 to answer questions and assuage fears. Among comments from residents were concerns that the National Guard will do nothing to stop the influx of guns from nearby states into the city and fears that troops roaming the streets will scare older adults and teenagers into staying inside.\nThe three-term mayor stood by previous statements that the Metropolitan Police Department has overseen an unprecedented reduction in violent crime and hopes her administration can spin Trump's deployment of the guardsmen into a positive for the city, considering the department is understaffed by several hundred officers.\n\"Just imagine if we had the number of MPD officers that we should have, if we were at 3,800 instead of 3,100,\" Bowser said. Police officials are now approaching their deployment strategy to see \"how the additional federal police officers can help in some areas.\"\nKevin Donahue, Bowser\u2019s city administrator, said D.C. would aim to keep the guardsmen near national monuments where people are accustomed to seeing armed forces and would try to have Metro police present wherever the troops are deployed to give residents a more familiar face.\nStaff said the largest part of the surge, potentially hundreds of federal troops, would happen overnight when many residents are indoors.\n'Every American should be deeply concerned'\nCharles Allen, a District council member overseeing the neighbors closest to the Capitol, called the deployment \"extreme, outrageous, and dangerous.\"\n\"National Guard soldiers are trained for warfare & natural disasters, not for community policing,\" Allen said in a lengthy thread on social media. \"Every American should be deeply concerned with what they\u2019re witnessing today.\"\nEleanor Holmes Norton, the city's longtime non-voting representative in Congress, said Trump based his federal takeover on a \"fiction he's pushed since the campaign trail.\"\n\"DC has not been 'overtaken by violent gangs' as he said yesterday,\" Holmes Norton said. \"The opposite is true: Crime is the lowest it's been in 30 years.\"\nResidents oppose National Guard deployment\nEarlier on Aug. 12, The New York Times reported that members of the National Guard were seen in various areas across D.C., including near the Washington Monument. The troops appeared on the streets and in their military vehicles.\nIn Anacostia, a historic and predominantly Black neighborhood in southeast D.C., residents told the Times that they opposed Trump\u2019s decision to deploy the military and to place local police under federal control.\n\"I think it\u2019s very horrible,\u201d Kyvin Battle, 57, told the newspaper. \"Because a lot of us who are innocent are going to get caught in the middle of all this.\"\nResidents noted that the crime levels in the city did not justify the federalization of the city's police force, according to the Times and Reuters. Rodney Miller, who has lived in the D.C. area for 50 years, told Reuters that he questioned the need for National Guard troops given lower crime levels now.\nThough many residents have expressed disapproval, some have shown support for the president\u2019s decision. While out on a walk with her child on Aug. 12, Rebecca Harkey told Reuters that crime had made her consider leaving the capital and that it was \"very much an active fear\" in her life.\nLocal leaders, civil rights activists denounce police takeover\nTrump has previously singled out majority Democratic cities such as Baltimore, Chicago, and D.C. \u2014 all cities with large Black populations \u2014 while speaking about rising crime in urban areas. In response to the president's claims and threats to deploy the military, local leaders have pointed to statistics showing a decline in crime in their cities over recent years.\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said on Aug. 11 that homicides dropped 30% in the past two years and shootings were down 40% in the past year alone.\n\"If President Trump wants to help make Chicago safer, he can start by releasing the funds for anti-violence programs that have been critical to our work to drive down crime and violence,\" Johnson said in a statement.\nIn a joint statement on Aug. 11, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, and other local elected leaders said they \"stand in strong opposition to the President's latest power grab, which is based on pure lies about our communities.\"\n\"As leaders in Baltimore and the state of Maryland, we Baltimore, like D.C., is seeing real public safety progress - with homicides down 40% since 2021 - even as the Trump administration has slashed funding for the programs that have brought crime to record lows,\" according to the statement.\nCivil rights leaders also condemned the deployment and police takeover, calling it \"unprecedented,\" and warned that there would be long-term repercussions to First Amendment rights. The Rev. Al Sharpton, who founded the National Action Network, said in a statement that \u201cthe people of Washington, D.C. \u2012 especially those living on the streets, who need the most care \u2012 will suffer, alongside the core principles of our Democracy.\u201d\nContributing: Reuters"

      "text": "No more GI Joe trucks: Army swaps iconic Humvee for a faster, cheaper vehicle\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Army is swapping an icon \u2013 the 40-year-old Humvee \u2013 for a lighter, faster, cheaper truck designed for future battlefields.\nThe Infantry Squad Vehicle, more dune buggy than armored truck, is one of the most visible signs of the Army\u2019s transition from Cold War-era equipment that has defined it for generations. The grinding insurgencies that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union demanded more armor to protect troops from roadside bombs.\nIn their place: a range of vehicles and drones that can be fielded quickly, and, in many cases, with commercial, off-the-shelf technology.\n\"The Humvee is the quintessential G.I. Joe vehicle,\" said Alex Miller, chief technical adviser to Army leadership for transforming its equipment. \"It is the quintessential Army vehicle we've had in the inventory since 1985. So, 40 years of Humvee. It was good for what it was built for, which was high mobility at the time. It is not good for the fight we think we're going to be in.\"\nThat fight, to Pentagon officials like Miller, probably involves China and will require speed and agility to survive. Battles will also almost certainly resemble the combat sparked by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Lethal drones have turned slow-moving trucks and even tanks into death traps.\nEnter the Infantry Squad Vehicle. It\u2019s basically a stretched-out, stripped-down all-terrain vehicle without doors or a roof with seating for as many as nine soldiers. The Army plans to equip its light infantry units with the trucks, along with hundreds of drones to spy on and attack enemies.\nThe Army\u2019s new signature vehicle\nDuring World War II and for most of the 40 years that followed, the olive-drab Jeep became synonymous with the Army. The small, rugged truck crossed over to civilian use and is the ancestor of the off-road vehicles and SUVs that patrol suburbs and ferry kids to the front lines of soccer games.\nThe High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle, better known as the Humvee, had another 40-year run as the Army\u2019s workhorse truck beginning in 1985. The Pentagon bought more than 300,000 Humvees, and nearly 100,000 remain in service. Soldiers have driven them in operations from Afghanistan to Alaska. More versatile than a Jeep, the Humvee offered multiple versions, including one that could hunt and destroy a tank with a missile.\nThey gained infamy, though, in Iraq and Afghanistan, where insurgents relentlessly attacked their chief vulnerability: a flat bottom made of aluminum easily shredded by explosives buried in roads. Improvised explosive devices, IEDs, became the No. 1 killer of U.S. troops in both wars.\nThe Pentagon, under Defense Secretary Robert Gates, made replacing the Humvee the military\u2019s top priority during the George W. Bush administration. The Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle, a heavy truck with a V-shaped hull that deflected the blast from bombs, saved the lives and limbs of thousands of troops.\nIn 2012, then-Defense Secretary Ashton Carter released data to USA TODAY on the effectiveness of MRAPs in IED attacks.\n\"You are between nine and 14 times less likely to be killed if you were in an MRAP than if you were in a Humvee,\" Carter said.\nBut the protection the MRAP offered came at the cost of speed and agility. The Pentagon bought smaller, armored trucks such as the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle. Though the JLTV was more nimble than the MRAP, its bulk meant it couldn\u2019t be sped to battlefields.\nThe Army\u2019s new 'Jeep' is easier to repair\nThousands of pounds lighter and $80,000 cheaper than the Humvee, the Infantry Squad Vehicle is based on the Chevrolet Colorado truck built in Missouri. It\u2019s basically the same truck consumers can buy at a local dealership. Only about 20% of the Infantry Squad Vehicle\u2019s components, including communication and electronic gear, are unique to the Army.\nThat\u2019s a key difference compared with trucks such as Humvees and JLTVs, which were custom-built for the military.\n\u201cYou can repair it anywhere on Earth as long as you have access to commercial parts rather than a special military vehicle with special military parts,\u201d said Miller, the Army\u2019s top technical adviser.\nSome Pentagon officials, however, acknowledge that the tradeoff for speed and expense is losing the armor that saved lives and limbs in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Infantry Squad Vehicle represents the Army\u2019s latest assessment of what soldiers will need for the next war.\nThe new drones and robots accompanying the truck can be sent ahead of it to help soldiers avoid ambushes. Speed, not armor, is what will save soldiers\u2019 lives in the next fight, Miller said.\n\u201cThe longer you sit and the slower you are, the easier it is to kill you,\u201d he said.\nThe Infantry Squad Vehicle represents the Army\u2019s best guess, based on decades of combat experience, of what will work best for future combat, according to a senior Defense Department official who was not authorized to speak publicly.\nThe vehicle isn\u2019t meant to withstand an attack, the official said. It\u2019s designed to whisk soldiers within a few miles of the front line and allow them to walk a short distance to the fight.\nIf the Army gets drawn back into a bloody, urban fight with IEDs?\nWe\u2019ll buy something else, the official said.\nMichael O'Hanlon, a national security expert at the Brookings Institution, counts himself a skeptic of the ISV.\nHe recalled that 20 years ago, the Army sank billions into what it called Future Combat Systems. The initiative was intended to replace Abrams tanks and Bradley Infantry Fighting vehicles with a fleet of manned and unmanned systems. It failed.\n\"Worked great on Powerpoint,\" O'Hanlon said. \"But the technology wasn\u2019t there then (to find everything before it exploded or impacted) and it still isn\u2019t. Like Muhammad Ali said, 'I\u2019ll float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.' Except the technology may not deliver.\n\"They had to cut something but I\u2019m wary about this choice.\"\nWhat do soldiers think of it?\nSoldiers in the 101st Airborne Division were among the first in the Army to drive the trucks. Many swear by it.\nIts lighter weight, relative to a Humvee, means the Infantry Squad Vehicle can be carried by a Black Hawk helicopter for a short distance with a sling. A twin-rotor Chinook helicopter can carry two of the trucks inside its cargo bay for a greater distance. A Humvee\u2019s weight requires a Chinook, and then just one can be carried in a sling.\nOn the ground, the Infantry Squad Vehicle is faster than a Humvee and more fuel-efficient. Speed helps infantry soldiers keep pace with armored units traveling to war, said Col. Trevor Voelkel, who commands the 1st Mobile Brigade Combat Team for the 101st Airborne Division. Voelkel\u2019s brigade tested new equipment, including about 200 of the trucks, at the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk in Louisiana in May.\n\u201cWe're getting back to our original concept of the Humvee,\u201d Voelkel said. \u201cBut with a newer, lighter, more commercial vehicle that\u2019s going to be easier to repair, cheaper to repair.\u201d\nWilliam Melko, a 1st sergeant in Voelkel\u2019s brigade, had experience driving other Army trucks in Afghanistan. None of them, he said, gave his soldiers a better view of potential threats around them. It\u2019s easier to drive, too, especially for younger soldiers.\n\u201cThe best way that I can describe it is like a normal pickup,\u201d Melko said.\nLast year, after Hurricane Helene swamped the southeast, Lt. Col. Jonathan Nielsen commanded a battalion of the 101st that responded to the flooding in North Carolina. His soldiers drove Infantry Squad Vehicles on damaged roads inaccessible to a Humvee, he said.\nThe trucks also maneuvered through city streets better than Humvees.\n\u201cISV is going to be an iconic vehicle,\u201d Nielsen said.\nContributing: Ramon Padilla, Graphics"
