  "description": "The Boeing 727 and its trijet design were pretty cool on paper, but it wasn't exactly a hit. It's also one of the most difficult commercial planes to fly.",
  "content": "What Makes The Boeing 727 One Of The Most Difficult Commercial Planes To Fly\n\nBuilt in the early 1960s, the Boeing 727 was designed to bridge the gap between short-haul and long-haul flights, operating between airports with shorter runways and lacking infrastructure. It had three Pratt & Whitney JT8D engines on the fuselage at the rear of the plane, with a third engine fed by an S-shaped duct at the tail. This configuration gave it great performance, but also created handling challenges for pilots. Because all three engines were around the tail area of the aircraft, the center of gravity was shifted rearward, dramatically affecting airflow around the tail, making stability and control surface response difficult. Like other planes of this era, the 727 didn't have all the bells and whistles modern planes have today; it was an old-school aircraft, relying on an entirely manual system, forcing pilots to handle all of its aerodynamic quirks in real time. For example, the Dutch roll, a phenomenon that pilots must actively counteract by using coordinated rudder and aileron inputs, and its swept wings, which demanded precision, especially on approach.\n\nDespite its wing design being optimized for short-field landing capability, approaching and landing required close concentration because if the pilot overlooked or mistakenly entered certain flap configurations, it could produce sudden increases in sink rate close to landing. To ensure a smooth and safe landing, pilots had to carefully synchronize speed brakes, thrust reversers, and flaps; any mistakes in managing any one of these controls could result in a crash landing. Although it did have some, the lack of major automated systems like flap and gear sequencing made the Boeing 727 one of the most difficult planes to fly. Any trim adjustments, hydraulic pressure management, fuel balancing, and thrust control were all handled without any assistance, requiring pilots to truly fly the aircraft in every sense of the word. The crash of American Airlines Flight 383 in 1965 and several other similar incidents highlighted the need for a better understanding of its handling and additional training implemented by the FAA. To address the excessive sink rate issue, some airlines restricted the 40-degree flaps on approach to reduce the effect.\n\nA 2016 study published in the International Journal of Aviation, Aeronautics, and Aerospace by Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, shows how simulator training was implemented to replicated Dutch roll tendencies, system malfunctions, and unstable approach scenarios. Recurrent courses focused on flap sequencing, gear deployment timing, and manual trim use to prepare pilots for the aircraft's behavior in real-world conditions. The three-engine design was noisy and lacked fuel efficiency, so by the 1980s, environmental regulations and economic influences signaled the beginning of the 727's decline. Newer twin-engine aircraft, such as the Boeing 757 jet, had high-bypass turbofan engines, which are both quieter and consume less fuel, which made it more appealing for airlines in contrast to the 727's less efficient low-bypass engines. In 1984, the Boeing 727 was discontinued after 1,832 were manufactured, with many serving as cargo, charter, and research planes. The final commercial passenger flight took place in January 2019. Boeing's 727 played a role in pushing aviation forward by influencing aircraft technology, cockpit ergonomics, and the aim to construct aircraft to be safe, effective, and easy to use by considering human capabilities and limitations.",

      "text": "Everything To Know About The Boeing 757 Jet\nBill Boeing's lofty place in aviation history is undeniable. The Boeing Company was founded in 1916 in Seattle and would become an industry heavyweight. Fast forward a century or so, and its influence is clear to see, with over 10,000 jetliners bearing its name traveling the world today.\nOf course, it's not just about commercial passenger airliners. Boeing has also developed some formidable military aircraft, with the enormous B-29 Superfortress, a World War II bomber (all 105,000 lbs in gross weight of it), just one example of the company's achievements. Nonetheless, it's in the commercial arena that most travelers and pilots will have experienced a Boeing. The venerable 757 is among the company's best-known models of all.\nAviation enthusiasts will surely appreciate this in-depth look at that famous jet, incorporating an introduction to the wider Boeing 700 family, the specs of the 757 (and how they evolved as later variants were introduced), and the impact it had.\nA brief introduction to the Boeing 757's predecessors\nThe company's unique naming convention began with the 707, the result of Boeing's work in the 1950s to develop a jetliner that could both serve the supportive military capacity of refueling other aircraft and prove profitable in a transport capacity. The model boasted four Pratt & Whitney JT3D turbofans, allowing it to travel over 600 mph and carry over 150 people (with crew and passengers included).\nIn 1955, Pan American World Airways expressed its interest to the tune of 20 orders, while, a year prior, the KC-135, an adaptation of the model for military use, was also ordered. Though the 707 proved popular from the start, it had to fight to remain so. In the interest of doing just that, the 727 was introduced in 1963. It had three Pratt & Whitney engines (the JT8D-1 in this case) rather than four and a comparable top speed to the earlier model but was intended to cement the 700 jets' intent to be practical, relatively inexpensive, and versatile flyers. The 727 was a sleeker model that was great at serving smaller airports.\nThe Boeing 737 was a successful single-aisle aircraft that took initial flight in 1967, and the mighty 747 jumbo jet of the same era was indicative of an effort to broaden the scope of airliner flight. It would be followed by Boeing's 757 jet, a model that successfully blended several of the family's traits.\nThe creation of the Boeing 757\nThe successor to the famed 747 jumbo jet certainly had jumbo shoes to fill. Lynn Rippelmeyer, who was a flight attendant in the 1970s, is quoted by The Guardian as saying that the 747 was \"the aeroplane that all the pilots wanted to fly. Because of its size, it's so stable and you just feel so secure in it.\" The task ahead of Boeing, then, was creating a worthy new addition to the Boeing 700 extended family.\nAs with the 737 before it, the 757 was created as a single-aisle aircraft with rather more modest dimensions than the jumbo 747 (the 747-400 was around 230 feet long, and the 757-200 measured just over 155 feet). The 757, which made its debut in 1982, used the virtues of the 727's narrow body while implementing more contemporary elements from the creation of the 767, which was in progress during the same period.\nTo address the noisy engine issue of the 727, the prototype 757 (dubbed the 7N7) would boast its own uniquely designed body, featuring a swept wing approach and a body long enough to carry 239 passengers (in the case of the 757-200). This high maximum passenger capacity for a narrow body, combined with a powerful engine, made the 757 an impressive airplane for its type.\nThe specs of the Boeing 757\nWith any vehicle, it's easy to conclude that a bigger and more imposing model would be more powerful than a smaller one. These modest packages, however, can sometimes hide something rather special. The Boeing 757's engines, positioned beneath the wings, were RB211-535Cs from Rolls-Royce on the family's introduction, but it would also be powered by several different varieties from Pratt & Whitney as the 757-300 joined the line: the PW2037, PW2040, and PW2043.\nThe 757-200 boasted a range of around 4,490 miles (3,900 miles for the 757-300) and had top speeds of approximately 600 mph. With a maximum of 43,500lb of thrust output (provided by the RB211-535E4B), the 757 family had remarkable power for an aircraft of its type. Such power, in fact, means it needs only as little as 6,000 feet to get itself airborne. Versatility was a priority with this aircraft family, and this is a huge part of how that was achieved.\nThe 757-200 debuted in commercial flight in 1983, serving Eastern Airlines. In contrast to some aircraft models, there wouldn't be a long string of variants following in its wake, but the 757 family did grow as time went on.\nBoeing 757 variants\nThe 757 family, as we've seen, had options that larger aircraft did not. Being able to land where larger relatives and rivals could not opened up other avenues. The 757-200F was designed for a different purpose: Transporting freight. The 200F sported a forward and an aft cargo bay, with load capacities of 10,300 lb and 16,300 lb, respectively.\nAfter this variant came the 757-300, which took the family's single-aisle leanings to new extremes. At around 178.5 feet long, it's an elongated version of the original model, further emphasizing the idea that a more modest aircraft body doesn't necessarily have to sacrifice power or storage. In fact, the 300 can carry more than 50 more passengers compared to the 200.\nThough these iterations of the model were developed, they weren't very widely adopted. Only 62 of the 757-300 saw manufacture. Most 757s in use, then, were 200s, the original completed design. That particular model seemed to embody everything about a single-aisle aircraft while offering some additional features that gave it the boost it needed to last. Innovations such as the supercritical wings (a design with a flatter top and rounded bottom) made it an efficient, cost-effective jet with impressive performance. Only the iconic Concorde topped it in terms of the thrust it was capable of as a lighter aircraft.\nThe Boeing 757 family's continued use\nWhat is it that keeps an older vehicle of any sort in continued use? Certain models do retain a nostalgic appeal that keeps them popular, but there's something simpler than that: Perhaps they simply worked well and continue to. This has certainly proven to be the case with the 757.\nThe family stopped being manufactured in 2004, over two decades after the first model arrived. Approximately 1,050 of them had been made over this time, and they would make remarkable journeys all over the globe: The Royal New Zealand Air Force arranged a fact-finding flight to Antarctica in a 757 in 2009. In 2015, a special 757, the ecoDemonstrator, was used by NASA to perform a range of flight tests to further research into planet-friendly approaches to fuels.\nIn 2019, Sam Weigel reported in Flying Magazine that around two-thirds of the 757 fleet manufactured are still being flown. Why had technology not left them behind? As Weigel puts it, the aircraft can \"make a 2,200 nm transcontinental flight... with an alternate a few hundred miles away and ample reserves, haul an absolutely full load of passengers and cargo, and still take off from a 7000-foot runway and climb straight into the mid-30s.\" In short, the 757 boasted and continues to boast a unique combination of traits that has made it an icon of Boeing's repertoire."

      "text": "Why Was The Boeing 727 Discontinued\nThroughout its storied history, aerospace manufacturer Boeing has designed and produced what many consider to be some of the most iconic passenger aircraft to ever take to the skies. While massive Boeing builds like the 747, and 787 Dreamliner tend to headline conversations regarding Boeing's best passenger planes, one can easily argue that the 727 also deserves its share of attention, even if the manufacturer stopped making way back in the mid-1980s.\nThe triple-engine passenger jet made its first flight in 1963, with Boeing specifically designing the plane to be petite enough to get in and out of smaller airports, but large enough to traverse oceans. Initially, it appeared that strategy might backfire completely, as sales of the 727 were reportedly well below Boeing's expectations when the tri-jet hit the market. However, sales of the small passenger aircraft eventually took off, with the 727 ultimately becoming the first commercial jet to sell more than 1,000 units.\nDespite the record-setting sales, the 727's production run came to an end a little over 20 years after it began, with Boeing pulling the plug on the build in 1984. As for why the company ended production on the 727, FlightGlobal head of strategic content and aviation intelligence Murdo Morrison told CNN in 2019 that, by the 1980s the planes were considered too noisy and inefficient compared to some newer jets. With airlines phasing the 727 out in favor of those newer, more efficient planes, Boeing had little reason to keep the 727 around.\nBoeing 727s are still flying decades after production ended\nDespite the fact that Boeing officially ended production of its 727 passenger jets in the mid-1980s, there were reportedly almost 1,900 of the builds in use at the time. Given that number, it should come as little surprise that the planes did not immediately fall out of use by airlines who'd been adding 727s to their fleets throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In fact, Boeing 727s would continue to operate as passenger jets for more than three decades after the final unit rolled off of the production line.\nIt was January of 2019 when the Boeing 727 flew its last commercial flight, doing so by completing a domestic Iranian trip for Iran Aseman Airlines. At the time, the actual 727 that flew the route was almost 40 years old itself, and was likely ready to be put out to pasture. Apart from ferrying passengers from one airport to the next, the 727 was also frequently used as a cargo carrier long after Boeing ended production of the build.\nWhile there are not many 727s flying today, many of the jets that are still in use are indeed serving in that freighter capacity. Still others have been converted for use as private jets or research vessels, and some have even been tabbed for other wildly unconventional uses, like a 727 limo. However, one 727 that's been a regular-enough fixture in the skies in recent years is the one owned by UK firm Oil Spill Response, which is used primarily to help clean up oil spills by dispersing oil-thinning fluids over spill sites."

      "text": "What Causes An Airplane To Dutch Roll And Just How Dangerous Is It?\nThere are a number of aeronautical phenomena that pilots learn about in order to keep themselves and their passengers safe. Many of these, like the Dutch roll, the uninitiated are unaware of. A Dutch roll is named after a maneuver ice skaters in the Netherlands are known for performing, swaying from side to side on the blade's outer edge while also moving back and forth from right to left. Dutch rolls in the air are typically caused by high-speed winds. If one occurs, it can damage the plane's tail and fuselage.\nDutch rolls are potentially dangerous and have caused disastrous incidents midair. Commercial airplanes have a system known as the yaw dampener that can mitigate the effects of a Dutch roll. If an aircraft isn't equipped with a yaw dampener, pilots are trained to reduce the maneuver's effects, just as they're trained to both fly in and avoid extreme weather.\nBut exactly what is a Dutch roll? Ken Byrnes \u2013 assistant dean, associate professor of aeronautical science, and chairman of the Flight Department at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida \u2014 told USA Today: \"In Dutch roll, the aircraft experiences a rolling motion primarily driven by the design ... of the wings, while simultaneously yawing due to the adverse yaw effect caused by the sideslip angle. This coupled motion results in a dynamic instability where the aircraft oscillates in both roll and yaw directions.\"\nSouthwest Airlines got Dutch rolls in the news\nWhile the Dutch roll doesn't happen often to commercial airliners, that doesn't mean it never happens. This May, a Boeing 737 MAX on a Southwest Airlines flight from Phoenix to Oakland, California involuntarily performed a Dutch roll. The plane managed to safely land without injury to its 175 passengers and six crewmembers, but an inspection after the flight revealed significant damage to its tail, rudder and a system that powers the rudder.\nHowever, Newsweek reported in July that the National Transportation Safety Board's preliminary report cited bad weather on the ground for the bulk of the airplane's damage. A storm in New Orleans a few days before the plane lifted off from Phoenix had winds that reached 84 mph, and at the time Southwest's plane was parked at the city's airport. There its rudder could have slammed back and forth repeatedly until the storm finally passed. John Cox, a safety consultant and former airline pilot, told the Associated Press that there was no way a Dutch roll could have inflicted such significant damage to the aircraft.\nBoeing's 737s aren't typically prone to Dutch rolls. If there's one thing to know about the 737, it's that they're built so the pilot can do nothing and the plane will naturally correct itself. Still, this was one of the luckier flights in Dutch roll history. A couple of others show how very dangerous this aerial issue can be.\nA US Air Force KC-135 crashed in 2013\nOn May 3, 2013, three U.S. Air Force airmen of the 92nd Air Refueling Wing died in a midair explosion after the KC-135 they were aboard performed an involuntary Dutch roll. During takeoff, the aircraft experienced a system malfunction that made its nose move from side to side. The crew couldn't diagnose the issue due to both a lack of information in the inflight manual and inadequate training, leading the pilot to continue with the planned combat aerial refueling mission. When he performed a simple left turn, it increased the Dutch roll's severity.\nThere was no recovering the plane's stability at this point. Using the rudder as normal to make a turn exacerbated the stress on the KC-135's airframe, causing its tail section to separate from the rest of the plane, which exploded. According to the Air Force, Brig. Gen. Steve Arquiette, leader of the accident investigation board, concluded: \"The crew encountered a condition that they had not realistically experienced in training, and when coupled with decisions based on their relatively low recent experience levels, were presented with an unrecognized hazardous and difficult situation to overcome.\"\nThis crash shouldn't have happened, as the plane was a KC-135R, which had new systems to prevent Dutch rolls. Investigators out of McConnell Air Force Base in Kansas attempted to re-create the flight's conditions with simulators and failed. Following this tragic event, Air Force crews received more training on recovering Dutch rolls.\nJapan Airlines encountered a devastating Dutch roll\nIn 1978, Boeing conducted some maintenance on a 747 owned by Japan Airlines after it landed at Osaka's Itami Airport and experienced a tail strike, its tail hitting the runway. The repairs included splicing the lower half of the aft pressure bulkhead to the upper half. Seven years later, Boeing's work would be deemed faulty after it led to history's deadliest crash from a single aircraft that experienced a Dutch roll.\nAs the 747 reached a cruising altitude of 24,000 feet on its way from Tokyo to Osaka, its aft pressure bulkhead \u2014 the part of the plane Boeing had worked on \u2014 ruptured and depressurized the cabin. This eventually separated the Auxiliary Power Unit and part of the tail cone from the plane, causing extensive damage to the vertical stabilizer. Soon there was no control over the hydraulic systems, leading the plane into a Dutch roll coupled with phugoid motions, in which an aircraft alternates between ascending and descending, pitching up, then down. This lasted for roughly 32 minutes.\nAfter only being in the air for over 40 minutes, JA8119 Flight 123 crashed into Mount Osutaka, northwest of Tokyo. The crash killed 520 people. Only four survived, and they had severe injuries."

  "argos_summary": "The Boeing 727, designed in the early 1960s, was a pioneering aircraft that faced significant handling challenges due to its rear-mounted engines, which affected stability and control. Pilots had to manage its manual systems without modern automation, making it one of the most difficult commercial planes to fly, particularly during landing. Despite its initial success, the 727 was discontinued in 1984 due to noise and inefficiency compared to newer aircraft, although it continued to be used in various capacities for decades after its production ended.",
