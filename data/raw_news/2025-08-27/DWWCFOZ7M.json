  "title": "Tesla Makes Desperate New Cybertruck Move As Stock Wobbles",
  "description": "The Cybertruck\u2019s rocky history has continued its downward trajectory as the year has developed, highlighted by a 50% plunge in sales compared to last year.",
  "content": "Tesla appears to be launching one more salvo in its bid to boost flagging Cybertruck sales and popularity, saying this week it will now offer the model in a new international market.\n\nThe company announced its South Korea launch with regional branding on X, linking to an official statement on Korea\u2019s top app, Naver. The move underscores Tesla\u2019s intent to solidify its presence in Asia, where demand for high-end electric vehicles continues to grow.\n\nInterestingly, Tesla also appears to be trying to rebrand the Cybertruck: The Korean launch positions the Cybertruck as more than just a utility vehicle, but instead a premium, futuristic product that is \u201cluxury status symbol.\u201d\n\nThat marketing pivot may be tailored to South Korea\u2019s style-conscious and tech-savvy market, where innovation and striking design are highly valued.\n\nOne key part of offering a luxury brand? Making sure it has scarcity and heated competition. Orders for the South Korean Cybertruck are now being collected within the strict window between Aug. 29 and Sept. 4, with deliveries expected later this year.\n\nUnlike the initial U.S. rollout, buyers in Korea are not receiving any special packages, but the vehicle\u2019s price is around $100,000. That is slightly above U.S. pricing, a boost the company says is primarily due to shipping and tariffs from Giga Texas.\n\nThe Cybertruck\u2019s rocky history has continued its downward trajectory as the year has developed, highlighted by a 50% plunge in sales compared to last year. Now, rebranding it as a different type of vehicle abroad and crashing resale values are continuing to cast doubt on its long-term prospects.\n\nIt didn\u2019t start out this way.\n\nUnveiled in 2019 with claims of bulletproof windows and indestructibility, the market and Tesla fan boys had high hopes the futuristic truck. But the vehicle\u2019s production delays and underwhelming market performance have been clear signs it has struggled to meet the hype. Despite the buzz, in Q2 2025, Tesla sold only about 4,300 units, a steep decline that reflects waning consumer enthusiasm.\n\nThe model has also been hit with a number of quality and recall issues. In March, U.S. regulators issued a recall for nearly all Tesla Cybertrucks currently on the road, marking the eighth such recall since deliveries began just over a year ago.\n\nThat recall was prompted by concerns that an exterior stainless steel strip\u2014known as the cant rail assembly\u2014that runs along the sides of the windshield can detach during driving. The detachment poses a serious safety hazard, increasing the risk of debris hitting other vehicles and potentially leading to crashes, NHTSA officials said.\n\nMeanwhile, in the U.S., Tesla faces mounting challenges.\n\nThe company\u2019s efforts to revive its once-scorching stock have gained some momentum, boosted by signs that U.S. interest rates may soon be cut. But it continues to face conflicting headwinds over the various parts of its business and how well each is doing.\n\nToday alone, Tesla (TSLA) stock has whipsawed all day, as traders tried to digest news that weekly registrations in China have dropped and price that into excitement about a major expansion of its autonomous ride-hailing service in Texas.\n\nTesla\u2019s stock has gained over 30% this year, driven by optimism about its AI investments and autonomous vehicle ambitions. Yet, the company remains under investor scrutiny amid declining sales in China and a perceived overvaluation.\n\nThe expiration of the federal EV tax credit on Oct. 1 has added some urgency to last-minute buyers, with Tesla heavily promoting the savings and its autonomous features.\n\nWe\u2019ve tracked the tech sector\u2018s collective highs and lows closely this week: Following Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s recent remarks, stocks surged and Bitcoin rose above $114,700, and Ethereum climbed to nearly $4,600. That\u2019s lead some traders to lean toward an imminent shift towards lower borrowing costs, which could further inflate risk assets.\n\nAs Tesla attempts a global expansion and rides the wave of market optimism, the true test for the Cybertruck\u2014and Elon Musk\u2019s increasingly stratospheric visions\u2014remains ahead.\n\nWill the recent rally sustain once the government incentives vanish and the initial hype fades? For now, the vehicle\u2019s future remains uncertain, with critics questioning whether the Cybertruck was ever destined to deliver on its sci-fi promises.",

      "text": "In latest blow to Tesla, regulators recall nearly all Cybertrucks\nIn latest blow to Tesla, regulators recall nearly all Cybertrucks\nU.S. safety regulators on Thursday recalled virtually all Cybertrucks on the road, the eighth recall of the Tesla-made vehicles since deliveries to customers began just over a year ago.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s recall, which covers more than 46,000 Cybertrucks, warned that an exterior panel that runs along the left and right side of the windshield can detach while driving, creating a dangerous road hazard for other drivers, increasing the risk of a crash.\nThe stainless steel strip, called a cant rail assembly, between the windshield and the roof on both sides, is bound to the truck\u2019s assembly with a structural adhesive, the NHTSA report said. The remedy uses an adhesive that\u2019s not been found to be vulnerable to \u201cenvironmental embrittlement,\u201d the NHTSA said, and includes additional reinforcements.\nTesla will replace the panel free of charge. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed May 19, 2025.\nThe recall of 46,096 Cybertrucks covers all 2024 and 2025 model years, manufactured from November 13, 2023, to February 27, 2025. The NHTSA order says that Tesla became aware of the problem early this year.\nVideos posted on social media showing people ripping the panels off of Cybertrucks with their hands have gone viral in recent days.\nThe Cybertruck, which Tesla began delivering to buyers in late 2023, has been recalled eight times in the past 15 months for safety problems, including once in November because a fault in an electric inverter can cause the drive wheels to lose power. Last April, the futuristic-looking trucks were recalled to fix acceleration pedals that can get stuck in the interior trim. Other recalls were related to windshield wipers and the display screen.\nIt\u2019s the latest setback for the Elon Musk-owned electric automaker, which has come under attack since President Donald Trump took office and empowered Musk to oversee a new Department of Government Efficiency that\u2019s slashing government spending.\nWhile no injuries have been reported, Tesla showrooms, vehicle lots, charging stations and privately owned cars have been targeted.\nProsecutors in Colorado charged a woman last month in connection with attacks on Tesla dealerships, including Molotov cocktails thrown at vehicles and the words \u201cNazi cars\u201d spray-painted on a building.\nAnd federal agents in South Carolina last week arrested a man they say set fire to Tesla charging stations near Charleston. An agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote in an affidavit that authorities found writings critical of the government and DOGE in his bedroom and wallet.\nEven before the attacks ramped up in recent weeks, Tesla has been struggling, facing increased competition from rival electric vehicles, particularly out of China.\nThough largely unaffected by Thursday\u2019s recall announcement, Tesla shares have plummeted 42% in 2025, reflecting newfound pessimism as sales crater around the globe.\nWith regard to Thursday\u2019s recall, Cybertruck owners may contact Tesla customer service at 1-877-798-3752 and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Vehicle Safety Hotline at 888-327-4236, or go to nhtsa.gov."

      "text": "Tesla will launch its Cybertruck model in South Korea later this month, with prices starting at 145 million won ($103,800), the Elon Musk-led company announced on Tuesday.\n\u201cA new horizon of innovation and style. The Tesla Cybertruck is finally launching in Korea,\u201d the company wrote on X.\nTesla said customers who placed reservations must log into their Tesla account between August 29 and September 4 to convert their booking into a confirmed order.\nNew orders will be accepted from September 5.\nTwo versions of the Cybertruck will be available in the Korean market: Cybertruck AWD, starting at \u20a9145 million and the top trim Cyberbeast, starting at \u20a9160 million, equivalent to $114,500.\nTesla Korea said a \u20a920 million down payment is required to secure the order, of which \u20a9100,000 corresponds to the original reservation fee.\nTesla also confirmed that the Cybertruck will not be eligible for South Korea\u2019s EV subsidies, as the model is classified as a mid-size truck.\nThe launch marks the first time the Cybertruck is available in the South Korean market, nearly two years after deliveries began in the United States.\nCustomers who complete the order process by September 4 will retain priority based on their original reservation date, but failure to do so will move them into the general order pool.\nLast week, Tesla raised the price of the Cybertruck\u2019s most expensive trim \u2014 the Cyberbeast \u2014 in the US. However, it now includes the \u201cLuxe Package\u201d as standard.\nIn its home market, Tesla is currently offering 0% APR financing on purchases of the Cybertruck with the FSD included.\nThe offer was first introduced in early June, and extended past the end of the month. The website does not feature any expiration date.\nAccording to Cox Automotive data, Tesla sold 4,306 Cybertrucks in the second quarter, half of the sales registered from April-June 2024."

      "text": "Cryptocurrency markets skyrocketed into new territory Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled that interest rate reductions could be imminent, pushing the Dow to its first 800-point plus gain this year. That ended the Dow\u2019s longest streak without a new high since Dec. 4, 2024, according to Dow Jones Market Data, and signaled a major surge of optimism at the prospect of some economic policy relief.\nCryptos were major stars of that rally.\nEthereum (ETH) climbed over 15% to reach a new all-time high of $4,885, surpassing its previous record from November 2021, while Solana (SOL) swung between 8% and 12.5% in a 24-hour period, nudging just past the longtime \u201cpsychological\u201d mark of $200 for a high of $201.94. Bitcoin (BTC) lovers also had their moment when it climbed 2.5% to $114,700 from $112,000, clawing back some of its losses from earlier this week.\nAs cryptocurrencies and stocks soared, the probability of a September Fed rate cut jumped to 90% following the speech, Reuters reports.\nSo why all the enthusiasm?\nSimply put: When the market feels more secure, it invests in places considered riskier bets. Cryptocurrencies and other fintechs that are part of emerging technology sit squarely in those crosshairs.\nThis time it appears institutional investors led the charge, as they look for investments that can balance out a shaky U.S. dollar, general volatility, and risk.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost a relief rally,\u201d Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth, told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cMarkets had anticipated more angst.\u201d\nThe optimism from the market is a sign monetary easing is a reversal of that angst, and could be a change in fortune for the sector, which has whipsawed in recent trading, said Steve Lee, co-founder and managing partner at Neoclassic Capital and investor in BlockTower Capital.\n\u201cI see this as constructive in the short term, and it may help reverse this week\u2019s sell-off. The key question is whether this momentum holds beyond the low-liquidity weekend. Since BTC and ETH price action is increasingly institutionally driven, spot ETF flows today and Monday will be a strong indicator of whether we are set for another leg higher,\u201d Lee told CoinDesk.\nWhat did Powell say?\nAs usual, Powell got straight to the point during his Wyoming speech on Friday.\n\u201cDownside risks to employment are rising,\u201d Powell said at the Jackson Hole Symposium. \u201cAnd if those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment.\u201d\nPowell also said recent policy moves from the Trump administration could affect inflation.\n\u201cWith policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,\u201d he said, adding that tariffs could push inflation higher, at least temporarily. \u201cA reasonable base case is that the effects will be relatively short lived, a one-time shift in the price level.\u201d\nYou can read Powell\u2019s entire speech here.\nSo how high did we go?\nIn this rally\u2019s case, a rising tide did indeed lift all boats.\nThe broader S&P 500 also saw strong gains, rising 1.5%, its best performance since May, and equities were a bright spot on the NASDAQ Composite, which advanced 1.9%.\nBut perhaps most importantly, the index used by Wall Street to gauge how frightened investors might be, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), dipped more than 14% to its lowest level this year. The VIX is a favorite of trading pros and shows how turbulent the market feels.\nThose gains across the board are an encouraging sign for both the buyside and the sellside, experts said.\n\u201cCorrelations between cryptos and equities are high, and we see a market mood that will be highly sensitive to this week\u2019s comments from the Jackson Hole meeting of monetary authorities, as well as from any reactions from fiscal authorities,\u201d wrote Manuel Villegas, an analyst at Julius Baer, in a research note.\nWhich crypto continue to rise?\nWhile nothing is a given once the opening bell rings, some analysts are already predicting which companies they think will continue to do well.\nAnalysts at Monarq Asset Management told CoinDesk that there\u2019s still more room for Ethereum to grow, and that they expect to see the coin top $5,000 in near-term trade.\n\u201cWe maintain our overall bullish stance. Market internals remain constructive, with few signs of overheating and, as you point out, a clear path to new all-time highs in both BTC and ETH,\u201d Sam Gaer, chief investment officer of Monarq Asset Management\u2019s Directional Fund, told CoinDesk.\n\u201cOur house view is that Powell\u2019s dovish pivot has cleared the way for $5,000+ in the near term, also not the hardest call to make,\u201d Gaer said. \u201cDemand from treasury vehicles should increase into the fall as many of the deals announced this summer close or de-SPAC, in addition to ongoing institutional and retail inflows.\u201d\nWill Powell lower rates?\nFriday\u2019s rally was a perfect example of how sensitive global markets are to Fed policy, particularly after a long period of no rate cuts. Analysts, traders, and every other player in finance have been attempting to read Powell\u2019s tea leaves for years with only moderate success, and even a major rally like Friday\u2019s can\u2019t completely fortify a very fragile market.\nWhile no one can be entirely certain what Powell and the Fed will do next week, market watchers across the board are bullish on the move. \u201cThe Fed isn\u2019t going to be the party-pooper,\u201d Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, told the WSJ.\nHow much that rate cut might matter in the long run remains to be seen.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still doubtful that a September cut points to a prolonged interest rate cutting cycle. Risks to inflation are real and coming from many angles,\u201d Lauren Goodwin, economist and chief market strategist at New York Life Investments, wrote in a Friday note."
