  "content": "A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Ankur Banerjee\n\nJapanese stocks scaled all-time highs and other regional share markets rose with the tide, buoyed by an extension of a tariff truce between the world's two largest economies.\n\nInvestor attention turns now to U.S. and UK economic data on Tuesday that will set the tone for monetary policy.\n\nThe United States and China agreed to another 90 days to hammer out a trade deal, staving off triple-digit duties on each other's goods and removing some uncertainty although markets broadly expected the move.\n\nAustralian stocks stayed near a record high hit earlier in the day while the Aussie eased as traders digested the widely expected 25-basis-point rate cut from the Reserve Bank of Australia.\n\nLess than a week after a divided Bank of England cut interest rates, investors will get a fresh view of the state of the UK labour market with British pay growth in July expected to stay steady at 5%.\n\nData on Monday showed hiring intentions by British businesses fell to their weakest since the COVID-19 pandemic and recruiters said starting pay was rising at the slowest pace in over four years.\n\nFour of nine BoE policymakers opposed its quarter-point interest rate cut to 4% last week and they are likely to need further convincing that domestic inflation pressures are easing. Traders are no longer pricing in another rate cut this year.\n\nThat possibly leaves sterling on firmer footing, but with British growth and its economy still a concern and the pound already up over 7% this year, speculators have ramped up their bearish positions on the currency.\n\nWeekly data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows speculators have short positions on the pound to the tune of $2.78 billion, a swift turnaround from the bullish positioning that had prevailed since February.\n\nThe U.S. inflation report later on Tuesday will also be key, as investors parse through the data to better understand the impact of Trump's tariffs and how that influences the Federal Reserve's rate cut path.\n\nKey developments that could influence markets on Tuesday:\n\nEconomic events: UK labour and wage data for June, Germany ZEW economic sentiment for August",

  "summary": "Japanese stocks rose to all-time highs and regional share markets rose following an extension of a tariff truce between the world's two largest economies. The United States and China have agreed to extend their 90-day trade deal. Investors will focus on U.S. and UK economic data on Tuesday, which will set the tone for monetary policy. British pay growth in July is expected to remain steady at 5%. However, hiring intentions by British businesses have dropped to their lowest level since the COVID-19 pandemic, and wages are rising at the slowest pace in over four years. Speculation on the pound has increased, with speculators having short positions on the currency.",
