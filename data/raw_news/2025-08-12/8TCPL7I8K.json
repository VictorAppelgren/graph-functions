  "title": "DC Crackdown Done Outside Local Jurisdiction: Mayor Dyer",
  "description": "Republican Mayor Jerry Dyer of Fresno, California, shares his thoughts on President Trump deploying the National Guard on Washington, D.C. and whether or not the President is distracting local police. He shares that the deployment was done outside the request of the local police department, and states that both federal and local governments need to work cooperatively to keep people safe. Mayor Dyer speaks with Joe Mathieu on the late edition of Bloomberg\u2019s \u201cBalance of Power.\u201d (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "Is President Trump augmenting or distracting local police in cities like Washington? Well, you know, I can't speak to the circumstances of what's happened in Washington, D.C.. I don't know what their true crime numbers are other than what I read the news. But I do know oftentimes there is a distance between crime rates and the way people feel in their community. And it's that feeling of safety that really matters. And in terms of deploying the National Guard or any type of federal resources, I can tell you my time as a police chief, I welcomed the partnerships that we had with some of our federal agencies, whether that was ATF, DEA or FBI. But it was always done at the request, generally of myself asking for those entities to come in. We would have some type of a cooperative agreement, joint Task Force, Unified Command. There was good communication, but there was always this cooperative relationship. And today, what we're seeing, whether it was in L.A. or D.C. with the deployment of the Federal Guard or the federal National Guard, it was done outside of the the request of the local jurisdiction. And so what I what I have found over the years is that crime is not a Republican or Democrat issue. Everyone wants to feel safe. And the debate oftentimes is how do we make them feel safe? We definitely in law enforcement do not want to be seen as an occupying force in neighborhoods. We want to be seen as a welcomed presence. And when we are seen as a welcomed presence in neighborhoods by folks, they're more likely to cooperate, cooperate, provide us with information that helps us to solve crimes, solve shootings. And so that's that's what we strive for, is that will work in relationship with our community. And sometimes if we're seen as an occupying force, I can tell you there's going to be an aversion back. Well, we're showing some crime statistics from Fresno homicides, rape , aggravated assault, all down 2024 to 2025. There we have them again on your screen if you're with us on Bloomberg TV or on YouTube. Robbery was up a bit, but that's a composite improvement across the board here when you consider the language that we're hearing from the president. I don't know if if you're different than the mayor of Hartford who says he doesn't even know who to call and does not have an open dialogue with the White House. But the data speak for themselves here. The optics are another part of this. Does it help to have more uniformed officers or even National Guards troops walking the streets to make people feel as if they're safer? Let me ask that in a second. But just to just to talk about some of those crime numbers, that's only comparing 25 to 24. When you look at nearly every American in America in 2020 and 2021, violent crime skyrocketed. We had the pandemic. We had the George Floyd murder. You had all those things that caused a lot of crime increases. I can tell you, in 20 our high mark in 2020, we had 732 shootings in our city. Today, seven and a half months through the year, we have 105. You saw the graphic there. We actually have 13 murders back in 2021, we had 74. So we are going in a good direction. So the question is, do we need, for example, in Fresno, do we need the increased presence of National Guardsmen? No, absolutely not. Do they need them? And DC, based on the numbers I saw, I would say no. But I'm not a resident in that city. But I would say from a law enforcement perspective, as a mayor of Fresno, I would not want the National Guard coming into our city because at some point in time they're going to leave and the local jurisdiction is going to be the one that has to deal with whatever fallout there may be to be able to regain the trust of the community. And so I would say we've made considerable progress. We're not where we need to be yet. And it's not necessarily the number of people we have on the streets and the strategies that you utilized with those folks to combat crime. And I think in American policing today, we're going in a very, very good direction. Well, it's really interesting to hear you say all of that. And it kind of brings us back to my original question, Mr. Mayor, that the introduction of of National Guard troops or even the federalization of a local police department, by the way, no one's talking about doing either to Fresno, does not, in fact, help local officials. It undermines them. You know, whatever we do between the federal government and the local government, whether it's the mayor or the police chiefs, it really needs to be done in a cooperative way. There needs to be discussions that occur between federal agencies and local agencies how we can best police a city. And it's not about taking over, in my opinion. It's about working cooperatively. And at the end of the day, it's about keeping people safe, not who's in charge, not necessarily how many who have more police officers on the streets. It's how we can cooperatively police our cities and keep people safe and at the same time make sure that people trust us as we're doing them. Trust is vital. We lose that trust in community. And we've done that many times over the years. And American policing very, very hard to get back. So, you know, I hope that there will be some middle ground that they can find in D.C.. I do hope that this doesn't spread across America because I think it would have an adverse impact in our ability today and in the future to be able to police in some of our neighborhoods in America and certainly in Fresno. We're doing fine right now. And but if we need assistance, I know exactly who to call, when to call, to give federal assistance to coming Dawson.",
