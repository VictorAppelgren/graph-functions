  "content": "NeuroPace (NASDAQ:NPCE) reported second quarter 2025 earnings on August 12, 2025, delivering record revenue of $23.5 million, up 22% year-over-year, with gross margin of 77.1% and an increased full-year revenue outlook of $94 million to $98 million. Major strategic highlights include strong core RNS system sales, positive progress in the NAUTILIST trial for generalized epilepsy, and successful debt refinancing supporting financial flexibility. The following insights detail drivers of sustainable growth, expansion initiatives, and implications for long-term investors.\n\nRevenue increased by $4.2 million year-over-year, propelled by rising implant volumes and expanded prescriber engagement, while Dixie Medical product sales are being phased out. Gross margin rose to 77.1% from 73.4% year-over-year, and RNS system gross margin exceeded 80%, reflecting improved manufacturing efficiency and favorable product mix.\n\nThe significant gross margin improvement, coupled with operating expense growth held below revenue growth (13% YoY vs. 22% YoY, respectively, both excluding nonrecurring items), enhances underlying operating leverage.\n\nThe NAUTILIST trial, focused on idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IgE), produced robust secondary endpoint results: at 12 months, median generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizure reduction was highly clinically meaningful, and at both 18 and 24 months, the median GTC seizure reduction exceeded 80%, based on ongoing trial data, with 45.2% of patients achieving seizure freedom during 12-month follow-up as of the data lock in the NAUTILIST trial. The FDA reviewed pre-submission documents, scheduled a near-term meeting on an accelerated timeline, and breakthrough device designation was granted\u2014a key external validation.\n\nSuccessfully expanding RNS to the IgE population with statistically significant clinical data and regulatory momentum positions NeuroPace to access a large, underserved market segment, diversifying and strengthening long-term revenue growth drivers.\n\nNeuroPace\u2019s RNS systems have generated more than 22 million recorded brain activity events, establishing a differentiated dataset leveraged for artificial intelligence (AI) development. Forthcoming AI-powered workflow tools and seizure classifiers are slated for launch in 2025, promising improved clinician productivity and outcomes.\n\nThe aggregation of proprietary, large-scale real-world data creates a sustainable competitive advantage, supports additional monetization from industry partnerships, and underpins rapid product innovation.\n\nManagement raised 2025 revenue guidance to $94 million to $98 million and increased gross margin guidance to 75% to 76%, up from prior ranges, reflecting ongoing RNS mix improvements. The company confirmed the NAUTILIST (IgE) PMA supplement will be submitted in 2025 and continues to forecast total operating expenses between $92 million and $95 million. The divestiture of Dixie Medical revenue will be updated in future guidance, but management reiterated conviction in 20%+ RNS growth for the RNS business, as discussed in the long-range plan and reiterated during theearnings calland outlined targeted pediatric and AI-driven product milestones through late 2025.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 1,060%* \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 182% for the S&P 500.\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now, available when you join Stock Advisor.\n\nThis article was created using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on The Motley Fool's insights and investing approach. It has been reviewed by our AI quality control systems. Since LLMs cannot (currently) own stocks, it has no positions in any of the stocks mentioned.

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."
