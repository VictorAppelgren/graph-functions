  "description": "OpenAI has been responding to user feedback following a rocky start for its newest, much-hyped AI model.",
  "content": "\u2022 Some users complained GPT-5 was inferior to its predecessor, 4o.\n\u2022 In response, the company announced a flurry of changes.\n\nOpenAI released GPT-5, the long-awaited upgrade to the model which powers ChatGPT, Thursday. In typical OpenAI fashion, the release has included plenty of twists, turns, and drama.\n\nIt was almost inevitable that the new model would disappoint a significant number of people, given how intensely it was hyped leading up to its release. On Aug. 2, Xikun Zhang, a research scientist at OpenAI, wrote in an X post that \"GPT-5 really feels like the most anticipated product launch in history.\" (The post was later deleted.)\n\nAlso: How you can still access GPT-4o, o3, and other older models in ChatGPT\n\nSure enough, GPT-5 has debuted more with a whimper than a bang.\n\nGPT-5's core strength, which OpenAI has gone to great lengths to emphasize, is its ability to adaptively choose between a collection of models depending on the nature of a particular prompt. While a good idea in theory, it's turned out to be unwieldy in practice for users, many of whom are now requesting out of frustration that the company bring back 4o, GPT-5's predecessor model. GPT-5 also performed poorly in coding tests conducted by ZDNET.\n\nIt didn't help that multiple charts displayed inaccurate information during a livestream presentation of GPT-5 on Thursday, a slip-up that the internet has taken to deriding as the \"chart crime.\" One bar graph comparing the new model's performance on the SWE-bench test, for example -- which gauges models' coding skills -- showed a comparatively low score for GPT-5 being displayed within a disproportionately higher bar.\n\nAlso: I tested GPT-5's coding skills, and it was so bad that I'm sticking with GPT-4o (for now)\n\nAll of this has presumably led to a busy handful of days for the OpenAI engineering and media teams as they deal with the fallout of this latest snafu. A collection of X posts both from the company and its CEO, Sam Altman, since Thursday, provides a window into how the company has responded, and the various patches that have been applied to keep the leaky ship of GPT-5 afloat.\n\nWhat has been updated?\n\nA Friday X post from Altman included a string of updates that had been made to GPT-5 in response to early user feedback. Those included:\n\u2022 None Doubling the rate limit for GPT-5 for ChatGPT Plus subscribers. According to OpenAI's website, Plus users can now send up to 160 messages every three hours via GPT-5. Once that limit has been hit, the model will automatically switch to a more limited mini model until the usage time window resets. OpenAI also noted that this was \"a temporary increase and will revert to the previous limit in the near future.\"\n\u2022 None Allowing some paid subscribers to continue to access and use 4o. In a X post on Friday, OpenAI wrote that ChatGPT Plus and Team users can access the model through an option reading \"show legacy models\" in settings. The same post added that GPT-5 had been successfully rolled out to all ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team, and free users.\n\u2022 None Making it easier for users to see which model is being used to respond to a given query. In the same Friday X post, OpenAI said users can now find this information by hovering over the circular arrow icon on the far right of the menu appearing beneath each of the chatbot's responses.\n\u2022 None Adding measures to ensure the right model is used for each response. (Altman noted in his Friday post that the model's autoswitcher mechanism was broken for part of the previous day, so that it \"seemed way dumber.\")\n\nIn another X post on Friday, Altman said the early, less-than-stellar reception to GPT-5 had imparted important lessons around user interface and experience that would be taken into account as ChatGPT continued to evolve.\n\nAlso: OpenAI's GPT-5 is now free for all: How to access and everything else we know\n\n\"Long-term, this has reinforced that we really need good ways for different users to customize things,\" he wrote. \"For a silly example, some users really, really like emojis, and some never want to see one. Some users really want cold logic and some want warmth and a different kind of emotional intelligence.\"\n\nAltman went on to say that the company was \"doing heroic work\" to build an optimal user experience amid the constantly shifting demands of a major product rollout, all the while working within the constraints afforded by its supply of GPUs: \"Not everyone will like whatever tradeoffs we end up with, obviously, but at least we will explain how we are making decisions.\"",

      "text": "I tested GPT-5's coding skills, and it was so bad that I'm sticking with GPT-4o (for now)\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- OpenAI's new GPT-5 flagship failed half of my programming tests.\n- Previous OpenAI releases have had just about perfect results.\n- Now that OpenAI has enabled fallbacks to other LLMs, there are options.\nSo GPT-5 happened. It's out. It's released. It's the talk of the virtual town. And it's got some problems. I'm not gonna bury the lede. GPT-5 has failed half of my programming tests. That's the worst that OpenAI's flagship LLM has ever done on my carefully designed tests.\nAlso: The best AI for coding in 2025 (and what not to use)\nBefore I get into the details, let's take a moment to discuss one other little feature that's also a bit wonky. Check out the new Edit button on the top of the code dumps it generates.\nClicking the Edit button takes you into a nice little code editor. Here, I replaced the Author field, right in ChatGPT's results.\nThat seemed nice, but it ultimately proved futile. When I closed the editor, it asked me if I wanted to save. I did. Then this unhelpful message showed up.\nI never did get back to my original session. I had to submit my original prompt again, and let GPT-5 do its work a second time.\nBut wait. There's more. Let's dig into my test results\u2026\n1. Writing a WordPress plugin\nThis was my very first test of coding prowess for any AI. It's what gave me that first \"the world is about to change\" feeling, and it was done using GPT-3.5.\nSubsequent tests, using the same prompt but with different AI models, generated mixed results. Some AIs did great, some didn't. Some AIs, like those from Microsoft and Google, improved over time.\nAlso: How I test an AI chatbot's coding ability - and you can, too\nChatGPT's model has been the gold standard for this test since the very beginning. That makes the results of GPT-5 all that much more curious.\nSo, look, the actual coding with GPT-5 was partially successful. GPT-5 generated a single block of code, which I pasted into a file and was able to run. It provided the requisite UI.\nWhen I pasted in the test names, it dynamically updated the line count, although it described it as \"Line to randomize\" instead of \"Lines to randomize.\"\nBut then, when I clicked Randomize, it didn't. Instead, it redirected me to tools.php. What?? ChatGPT has never had a problem with this test, whether GPT-3.5, GPT-4, or GPT-4o. You mean to tell me that OpenAI's much-anticipated GPT-5 is failing right out of the gate? Ouch.\nAlso: How to use GPT-5 in VS Code with GitHub Copilot\nI then gave GPT-5 this prompt.\nWhen I click randomize, I'm taken to http://testsite.local/wp-admin/tools.php. I do not get a list of randomized results. Can you fix?\nThe result was a line to patch. I'm not thrilled with that approach because it requires the user to dig through code and to make no mistakes replacing a line.\nSo, I asked GPT-5 for a full plugin. It gave me the full text of the plugin to copy and paste. This time, it worked.\nThis time, it did randomize the lines. When it encountered duplicates, it separated them from each other, as it was instructed. Finally.\nAlso: I found 5 AI content detectors that can correctly identify AI text 100% of the time\nI'm sorry, OpenAI. I have to fail you on this test. You would have passed if the only error was not using the plural of \"line\" when appropriate. But the fact that it gave me back a non-working plugin on the first try is fail territory, even if the AI did eventually make it work on the second try.\nNo matter how you spin it, this is a step back.\n2. Rewriting a string function\nThis second test is designed to rewrite a string function to better check for dollars and cents. The original code that GPT-5 was asked to rewrite did not allow for cents (it only checked for integers).\nGPT-5 did fine with this test. It did return a minimal result because it didn't do any error checking. It didn't check for non-string input, extra whitespace, thousands separators, or currency symbols.\nBut that's not what I asked for. I told it to rewrite a function, which itself did not have any error checking. GPT-5 did exactly what I asked with no embellishment. I'm kind of glad of that because it doesn't know whether or not code prior to this routine already did that work.\nGPT-5 passed this test.\n3. Finding an annoying bug\nThis test came about because I was struggling with a less-than-obvious bug in my code. Without going into the weeds about how the WordPress framework works, the obvious answer is not the right answer.\nYou need some fairly arcane knowledge about how WordPress filters pass their information. This test has been a stumbling block for more than a few AI LLMs.\nAlso: Gen AI disillusionment looms, according to Gartner's 2025 Hype Cycle report\nGPT-5, however, like GPT-4 and GPT-4o before it, did understand the problem. It articulated a clear solution.\nGPT-5 passed this test.\n4. Writing a script\nThis test asks the AI to incorporate a fairly obscure Mac scripting tool called Keyboard Maestro, as well as Apple's scripting language AppleScript, and Chrome scripting behavior.\nIt's really a test of the reach of the AI in terms of knowledge, its understanding of how web pages are constructed, and the ability to write code across three interlinked environments.\nQuite a few AIs have failed this test, but the failure point is usually a lack of knowledge about Keyboard Maestro. GPT-3.5 didn't know about Keyboard Maestro. But ChatGPT has been passing this test since GPT-4. Until now.\nWhere should we start? Well, the good news is that GPT-5 handled the Keyboard Maestro part of the problem just fine. But it got the coding so wrong that it even doubled down on its lack of understanding of how case works in AppleScript.\nIt actually invented a property. This is one of those cases where an AI confidently presents an answer that is completely wrong.\nAlso: ChatGPT comes with personality presets now - and other upgrades you might have missed\nAppleScript is natively case-insensitive. If you want AppleScript to pay attention to case, you need to use a \"considering case\" block. So, this happened.\nThe reason the error message referred to the title of one of my articles is because that was the front window in Chrome. This function checks the front window and does stuff based on the title.\nBut misunderstanding how case works wasn't the only AppleScript error GPT-5 generated. It also referenced a variable named searchTerm without defining it. That's pretty much an error-creating practice in any programming language.\nFail, fail, fail, McFaildypants.\nThe internet hath spoken\nOpenAI seemed to suffer from the same hubris that its AIs do. It confidently moved everyone to GPT-5 and burned the bridges back to GPT-4o. I'm paying $200 a month for a ChatGPT Pro account. On Friday, I couldn't move back to GPT-4o for coding work. Neither could anyone else.\nThere was, however, just a tiny bit of user pushback on the whole bridges burning thing. And by tiny, I mean the entire frickin' internet. So, by Saturday, ChatGPT had a new option.\nTo get to this, go to your ChatGPT settings and turn on \"Show legacy models.\" Then, as it has always been, just drop down the model menu and choose the one you want. Note: this option is only available to those on paid tiers. If you're using ChatGPT for free, you'll take what you're given, and you'll love it.\nEver since the whole generative AI thing kicked off at the beginning of 2023, ChatGPT has been the gold standard of programming tools, at least according to my LLM testing.\nAlso: Microsoft rolls out GPT-5 across its Copilot suite - here's where you'll find it\nNow? I'm really not sure. This is only a day or so after GPT-5 has been released, so its results will probably get better over time. But for now, I'm sticking with GPT-4o for coding, although I do like the deep reasoning capabilities in GPT-5.\nWhat about you? Have you tried GPT-5 for programming tasks yet? Did it perform better or worse than previous versions like GPT-4o or GPT-3.5? Were you able to get working code on the first try, or GPT-4o did you have to guide it through fixes? Are you going to use GPT-5 for coding or stick with older models? Let us know in the comments below.\nYou can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

      "text": "OpenAI's GPT-5 is now free for all: How to access and everything else we know\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- OpenAI has launched its long-awaited GPT-5 model.\n- The model is claimed to be OpenAI's fastest, smartest, and most capable yet.\n- GPT-5 is available to everyone: Free, Plus, Pro, and Team/Enterprise/Edu users.\nThere are two kinds of OpenAI models in this world: GPT and reasoning models. The advantages of the former, such as GPT-4o, are that they combine speed and accuracy, while reasoning models such as o3 and o4 take longer to think and use more compute power to produce better answers. OpenAI's latest model, GPT-5, supposedly gives all users access to the best of both models.\nAlso: Gen AI disillusionment looms, according to Gartner's 2025 Hype Cycle report\n(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, ZDNET's parent company, filed an April 2025 lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)\nOn Thursday, OpenAI finally unveiled the long-awaited GPT-5, the company's next-generation family of models, which it touts as the fastest, smartest, and most capable yet. GPT-5 is a unified system that combines a smart model for most queries and a deeper reasoning model (GPT-5 thinking) for harder problems.\nIf you are wondering exactly what it does and if you should even consider trying it, keep reading.\nWhat is GPT-5?\nThe key differentiator between GPT-5 and other OpenAI models is the real router feature, which allows GPT-5 to automatically understand which model to use based on the conversation, the complexity of the prompt, and more. The router is continuously trained on real signals to understand the best scenario in which to use a model. Once a user hits usage limits, a mini version of each model takes over.\nAlso: Can GPT-5 fix Apple Intelligence? We're about to find out\nWhile GPT-4o was an extremely capable model, it was not a reasoning model like o3 and o4; those were limited to paying subscribers. As a result, GPT-5 is an especially big win for free users, who typically did not have access to any of the reasoning models and were, by default, excluded from more advanced models.\nThe GPT-5 family of models is made up of GPT-5, GPT-mini, GPT-5-nano, and GPT-5 Pro. The nuances between these models will mostly be topics that developers or enterprises are concerned with when choosing which models to purchase from the API.\nHowever, for most consumers, what you need to know is that GPT-5 will be automatically selected even for free users, and when limits are reached will switch over to GPT-5 mini, a still capable but more lightweight model. GPT-5 Pro is only available to ChatGPT Pro subscribers, which comes at the hefty $200 per month cost. This is the most advanced version of GPT-5, meant for the most challenging and complex tasks -- tasks that the average user likely won't even encounter.\nHow does GPT-5 perform?\nAs with every model release, the GPT-5 drop was accompanied by benchmark evaluations, in which it earned state-of-the-art scores across math (AIME 2025), coding (SWE-Bench Verified), and multimodal understanding (MMMU). It even performed competitively on Humanity's Last Exam, a newer benchmark with multi-modal questions in over 100 subjects, such as math, science, and the humanities, as seen below.\nThe company claims it is the strongest coding model yet, being able to create websites, apps, and games from simple text prompts. In particular, OpenAI shares that it has shown improvements in complex front\u2011end generation and debugging larger repositories.\nAlso: Google's Jules AI coding tool exits beta with serious upgrades - and more free tasks\nBefore the model was released, I watched a live demo of the feature, in which the user created a fully functional web app with interactive elements such as flashcards, a quiz with right and wrong answers, and a game from a simple text prompt. The final product looked sleek. As someone who has recent experience building webpages, it would have taken me hours to stylize using JavaScript and CSS. GPT-5 appears to take vibe coding to the next level.\nEven if you are more of an average GPT-5 user who employs AI for writing, you will still reap these benefits. OpenAI claims GPT-5 is the most capable writing collaborator, being able to better tackle tasks that involve \"structural ambiguity\" such as free verse. Regardless of what you use ChatGPT to write, you should see improvements.\nPeople have been increasingly reliant on ChatGPT for health-related queries because of its ability to conversationally break down medical jargon, which can often be scary and intimidating. Now the experience is optimized with GPT-5, flagging concerns, asking questions, understanding results, prepping you to ask providers questions, and weighing options.\nAlso: ChatGPT can now talk nerdy to you - plus more personalities and other upgrades beyond GPT-5\nRemember that GPT-5 does not replace a medical professional. OpenAI noted that the model performed the highest on HealthBench, a benchmark evaluation the company published earlier this year. External benchmarks for how AI performs in medical scenarios are not yet standardized.\nHow does GPT-5 handle safety?\nOne of the biggest improvements available in GPT-5 is that the model is more accurate than any previous reasoning model and has fewer hallucinations, according to OpenAI. The company said GPT-5's responses are 45% less likely to contain a factual error than GPT-4o with web search enabled on anonymized prompts, and 80% less likely to contain a factual error than OpenAI o3.\nThis is a big win, as reasoning models go beyond traditional pattern prediction and are invited to \"think,\" which leaves room for error.\nOpenAI also added new publicly available benchmarks to test factuality, including LongFact and FActScore, in which GPT-5 with thinking showed a significant drop in hallucinations. GPT-5 (with thinking) also communicates more honestly with the user, sharing when a task is impossible or can't be done. This is important because AI models often offer a plausible-sounding answer instead of admitting they don't know, which can increase the circulation of misinformation. For more on the evaluation results, take a look at the system card.\nAnother brand-new safety feature is called \"safe completions,\" which enables ChatGPT to still answer prompts it would typically refuse. Instead, it will answer, but within the safety boundaries defined by OpenAI, and give a clear explanation of when it can't.\nLastly, while not entirely a safety issue, the model is less sycophantic, or effusively agreeable, and uses fewer unnecessary emojis.\nHow can you access GPT-5?\nAll users\nGPT-5 and GPT-5 mini are available today for all Plus, Pro, Team, and Free users, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access next week, OpenAI said. However, subscribers still receive tiered perks. For example, included in the $20 per month subscription, ChatGPT Plus subscribers have \"significantly higher usage\" limits than free users. Meanwhile, ChatGPT Pro users have unlimited GPT-5 and access to GPT-5 Pro, an even more advanced version of the model included in their $200 per month subscription. OpenAI said Enterprise and Edu users will be given \"generous limits.\"\nAlso: Microsoft rolls out GPT-5 across its Copilot suite - here's where you'll find it\nGPT-5 will be set as the default model for everyday work, replacing all other models for authenticated users. However, paid users will still have the option to select it under the model picker. OpenAI said free users may not be able to access full reasoning until a few days from now, noting that once free users reach usage limits, they'll be moved to GPT-5 mini.\nDevelopers\nThe release of the model is also helpful for developers, as they can benefit from the increased reliability and accuracy. To accommodate this, OpenAI is making GPT-5, GPT-mini, and GPT-5-nano available in the API. Two new parameters, reasoning and verbosity, are also meant to help developers get exactly what they need from their model without overspending. Pro, Plus, and Team users can sign in to ChatGPT to code with GPT-5 in the Codex CLI.\nThe reasoning parameter makes GPT-5 cheaper for tasks that don't require in-depth thinking, and then the verbosity parameter allows developers to fine-tune just how verbose they want GPT-5 to be. The pricing is cheaper than GPT-4o. For more information, you can check the blog post.\nWhat if I am not seeing GPT-5 yet?\nGPT-5 began rolling out to all Plus, Pro, Team, and Free users upon launch on Thursday. However, the rollouts are gradual, so if you checked immediately and didn't see it, it is worth checking again to see if you now have it. It had not shown up for me on my free, Plus, or Pro account until last night.\nDo make sure you are signed in. Even though GPT-5 is available to free users, if you don't sign in, you won't have access to the latest features, including GPT-5.\nYou can keep up with my latest stories and tech adventures on social media.

Well, the company has since proved its point: the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable is now available to consumers for an eye-watering $3,300, but packed with premium design elements, solid hardware, and a 120Hz OLED display that extends to almost 17 inches at the press of a button.\nAlso: Lenovo's $3,000 rollable ThinkBook laptop is officially available to buy - know this before you do\nI've been using the ThinkBook Plus for over a week as my main laptop, and I have to admit, I'm enamored by the extendable screen, particularly as a productivity machine for work.\nBut as the first of its kind, it's far from perfect. There are a handful of trade-offs due to the laptop's form, and the sky-high price invites a critical eye to every element of its design. That being said, it is ultimately a well-engineered laptop. Let's take a closer look.\nLike all ThinkBooks, the laptop exudes business, featuring a metallic, two-tone design. It's not my favorite aesthetic, but it's certainly durable and resists fingerprints way better than all the matte black designs out there.\nUpon first glance, the laptop looks like any other. One of the first things to stand out is the thick bezels framing the display, but as your eye draws to the bottom, you notice something strange: there's no bottom bezel -- the screen just continues below the keyboard.\nAlso: How to buy a laptop for school, work, or gaming (and our top picks for each)\nThe rest of the rollable screen is parked underneath, waiting to be unfurled. With the push of a button, the standard-sized display extends upwards, increasing the screen size to 16.7 inches.\nThe result is a large, portrait-style display that goes far beyond any other standard laptop screen size on the market. The glossy, OLED screen delivers a fantastic picture, with no flickering or dimming around the edges, although there is some visible creasing that looks like what you'd see on a foldable phone's display.\nThis is especially true if you rotate the glossy display to reflect the light. It's a little more visible than I expected and certainly something of note (given the price), but ultimately, it doesn't really overshadow the benefit of the large screen.\nFor example, you stop noticing the creasing when your attention is focused on what you're actually doing. It's one of those things that's an inevitable part of its mechanics -- it took foldable phones several years to reduce the creasing on their displays -- and although it doesn't exactly scream \"premium\", it doesn't cancel out the benefits the screen provides.\nAlso: I tried Lenovo's infamous 'rollable' laptop at CES - it's more practical than I thought\nSo what are the said benefits? First off, the extra room is a breath of fresh air. It allows for a spacious workspace that I have to admit, makes for a very nice user experience. Personally, I like running one large, full-screen desktop, but you can also put two windows, one on top of the other, for two 16:9 desktops.\nTo maximize real estate, I set the scale in Windows to 125%, bringing the UI down to a more manageable size that results in a crisp and efficient interface. However, if you want a larger UI, it still feels more roomy than a regular laptop display.\nIf you're a programmer, you'll appreciate the extended portrait orientation, but anyone who works with documents will love being able to see a third more content on the screen at a glance.\nAs an editor, it drastically improves working in Google Docs and my browser-based CMS, both of which benefit from more visibility without having to squint at a UI that's been scaled down to the atomic level.\nEven basic web browsing is improved, with more of the page on the screen at once, and more content visible with less scrolling. In that sense, the display mirrors the mobile layout, which is ultimately more scrollable.\nRolling the screen up can be done by pressing the associated key or with a hand gesture in front of the webcam. While it's extending, the screen defaults to playing an animation (different ones are selectable in settings) with some thematic music, then reloading your desktop once it reaches the desired size. The music can be a little much in a quiet office, so luckily, all of these features can be turned off.\nWhen fully extended, the bottom third of the screen is occupied by the Lenovo widget panel, which shows reminders, your to-do list, and a calendar at a glance. You can pin this to stay permanently on or have it hide behind your other apps.\nThere's actually a lot of content here, including short videos that show how to use gesture controls to raise and lower the display and some suggestions on how to organize the screen more effectively.\nBeyond the display, the rest of the laptop's core components are quite nice. The keyboard is a little shallow, but the keys feel great, with a satisfying click that's crisp and responsive.\nI was also thrilled to find the haptic trackpad to be just as well-engineered, with a uniform click no matter where you press down on the pad, and a sensitive input for swipe gestures. One thing to note, however, is that in cooler temperatures, you might have some trouble with the pad recognizing your fingers, especially if they're cold.\nAlso: The Lenovo ThinkPad streak is over: This model I tested bucks a decade-long trend (for the better)\nAlso note that the laptop's form factor limits its I/O access, with just two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports and a headphone jack. All three ports are located on the left side of the device, which might be problematic for some users, but is an expected trade-off for the features.\nAll in all, the laptop's core physical build feels premium (if a little chunky), and even without the rollable display, it would be a solid office laptop. The fingerprint reader on the power key, along with support for Wi-Fi 7 seal the deal as a modern business device.\nUnder the hood, the Intel Core Ultra 7 \"Lunar Lake\" processor, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage make for a standard hardware loadout comparable to any number of mid-to-upper range business laptops. The big display is powered by an integrated Intel Arc 140V GPU with 16GB of internal memory, supplying more than enough power for daily use.\nCinebench 24 MC | Geekbench 6.2.2 SC | Geekbench 6.2.2 MC | |\nThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable | 563 | 2,732 | 10,701 |\nDell 14 Premium | 732 | 2,626 | 15,462 |\nAcer Swift 16 AI | 518 | 2,743 | 10,932 |\nIf you're looking to game on this laptop, it can handle some mainstream titles, but it's not exactly built for running top-tier gaming content. In \"normal\" laptop mode, you've got a 2000 x 1600 resolution, standard fare for a 14-inch. But if your game supports a 2000 x 2350 resolution, you can play with the screen fully extended, which definitely feels like a unique experience, but because of all the screen space, it isn't exactly optimized for high-APM gaming.\nIf you're playing an older game that doesn't support that resolution, well, the game will simply revert to the traditional resolution, resulting in empty space below the window and negating the whole point of the extended display. The bottom line here: gaming can be a bonus for this laptop, but not what it's made for.\nAlso: Finally, a Windows laptop that I wouldn't mind putting away my MacBook Pro for\nRegarding battery life, the display expectedly cuts into the 66Whr battery's longevity, although not as much as you might expect. During normal use, you can get a full work day of use out of it with the screen extended, but it's cutting it close. If you add in videoconferencing and more demanding workloads, you might not make it through the day without a power top-up.\nThat being said, the Lunar Lake chip does allow for the battery loss to reduce to a trickle when not in use, and it charges fast: about 80% in an hour. In our video playback test, we got a little over 11 hours at half brightness in balanced mode over Wi-Fi.\nSo let's address the elephant in the room: the price. Lenovo is well aware that this laptop is not for everyone. In fact, it's probably the most niche product I've reviewed all year. Instead, it's more about proving a point.\nAlso: I've tested dozens of ThinkPads: Here's the Lenovo model I keep coming back to\nLenovo wants to project a reputation of innovation, but more importantly, it wants to prove it can deliver said products to market. This device reflects that mission, earning it an important place in Lenovo's portfolio, even if it's not the year's top seller.\nIt's also the first iteration of this rollable concept, and as such, the physical design is not quite as polished as you'd find in Lenovo's other high-end laptops, like the ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition or the X1 Carbon. These laptops come from a product line backed up by decades of design and engineering, with the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 having room to improve in subsequent model versions.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 is an impressive product, even considering its trade-offs. The display has visible creases and thick bezels, but when it's fully extended, you forget about them. The battery isn't the best, but it's far from the worst. It's not a stellar gaming rig, but that's not why you buy a ThinkBook, anyway.\nIt's niche, and it's expensive, but it does what it's supposed to: deliver a fantastic user experience in the office, with an expansive, flexible display that looks great, pairs nicely with a premium haptic touchpad, and just the right amount of power under the hood.\nAlso: I switched to the Dell 14 Premium for two weeks, and it made my XPS laptop look bad\nAt $3,200, this isn't a mainstream laptop, and I wouldn't recommend it unless you're absolutely sold on the extendable display and are committed to the form factor in the long term.\nThe reality is that you can get almost anything for less: a MacBook Pro M4 with 24GB of RAM, or the new brand-new Dell 14 Premium with the same processor and an upgraded Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 GPU for $1,000 less. But if you're in love with the big screen, I can say that it's a productivity game-changer in the office."

I compared it with a traditional Wi-Fi router, and here's my advice\nWith the adoption of remote and hybrid working, having a reliable internet connection at home is imperative -- not just for one device, but for several. If you have a family, maybe even dozens. So what's better, one single access point, or a mesh network spread about the home?\nThe answer depends on how your home and office are set up and what kind of connection you need. Wi-Fi routers are so good these days that a single access point is often the most straightforward solution. But if you have a larger home or your office is located far away from your router, a mesh network could be a game-changer, boosting the signal no matter where you are.\nAlso: The best VPN routers of 2025\nIf you're not sure of the difference, that's okay, too. Let's examine both types of connection and consider their pros and cons to determine which one is best for you.\nWhat is a traditional Wi-Fi router?\nA traditional router acts as a central hub for internet connectivity. The router acquires the connection from your internet service provider (ISP), and then allows other devices around the home to connect to it, either via Wi-Fi, or by simply plugging in an Ethernet cable. Typically, routers are password-protected so only your household can connect to it.\nYou should buy a traditional Wi-Fi router if...\n1. You're on a budget\nStandard routers are generally much more affordable than mesh network products. While you can still expect to pay a hundred dollars or more for a premium router, there are many budget-friendly options stable enough to keep your home office running effectively without further input.\n2. You have heavy bandwidth and speed requirements\nMany routers today, such as the TP-Link AXE5400 are designed with the technology needed to meet heavy bandwidth and streaming requirements. Some, like the Asus RT-BE86U, aim to exceed the requirements of most people for the fastest connection possible.\nAlso: Should you upgrade to Wi-Fi 7? Here's my verdict after testing this next-gen router at home\nGamers and live streamers, for example, should generally stick with wired Ethernet connections and traditional routers, as they will likely provide improved speeds and stability over wireless-first products.\n3. You want a plug-and-play product\nA standard router is often less hassle to set up than a mesh network. For something that \"just works,\" a typical router might be the best option. Set it up once, make sure updates are automatically applied, and forget about it.\n4. You want to separate devices and networks\nYou can set up guest Wi-Fi networks on most modern routers, but if you also want to keep all of your devices on a separate home network in the interests of security, most routers will allow you to do this without much hassle.\nWhat is a mesh router?\nWhile traditional routers are singular, centralized access points, mesh networking devices are decentralized.\nInstead of one device connecting to a single gateway to the internet, mesh networks are created from multiple Wi-Fi nodes that all provide web connectivity. For example, you could have a central hub in the kitchen and satellite nodes in the home office, kitchen, and bedroom.\nAlso: This is the fastest and most expensive Wi-Fi router I've ever tested\nWhen you access the internet while in the kitchen, you would automatically connect to the hub, whereas you would jump on a node while you're in your home office, and so on -- and this blanket coverage is why mesh devices are great for larger homes or offices. Most mesh systems will automatically select the best channels and nodes to avoid dead zones and lower the risk of poor connectivity.\nYou should buy a mesh networking system if...\n1. You have spotty coverage in your home\nThe main benefit of a mesh network is extended coverage. Investing in a mesh setup will remove annoyances, such as coverage blackspots or slow connections in larger properties with a lot of square feet. You're far less likely to have dead zones with a mesh system than you are with a single router access point.\nMesh networks can often cover up to 5,000 sq. ft., and more, with enough satellites. That's far more than you can expect from one central router.\n2. You need a reliable connection, no matter where you are\nAs your device will connect to the nearest satellite node rather than a central point of access, this feature helps ensure that -- no matter where you are in a property -- you are less likely to experience connectivity failures or drops.\nAlso: I switched my high-end Wi-Fi 7 router to a more affordable option - and don't regret it\nIn this manner, mesh networks are particularly useful if you have a home office in a garden area separate from your house, for example.\nAnother benefit is that mesh systems and satellites are often designed to look modern, sleek, and may be more discreet than bulky, traditional routers, giving you more options for placement.\n3. You want additional controls\nOnce a mesh network is active, many vendors allow users to control their system through a mobile app. This could include keeping an eye on network traffic, rebooting, or even turning off the internet entirely -- perhaps an appealing prospect for those with children who don't want to mess with a typical router's configuration. In addition, some mesh networks also act as smart hubs and are compatible with voice assistants.\nA note of warning, however: you may need to spend some time tweaking configuration settings when you first set up a mesh network.\nFAQs\nWhat are the disadvantages of using a Wi-Fi router?\nThere are three key disadvantages of using a traditional Wi-Fi router:\nCoverage issues: As internet access is distributed through a single point, this setup can mean that areas far away from your router will have slow or spotty connections that drop. Range extenders can help remove this barrier, and while they can still be cheaper than investing in a mesh network, it's an additional expense.\nOverload: Unless extenders or channel separation features are used, too many connections may result in overloading, bottlenecks, lags, and connectivity drops.\nTweaking: If you want to tweak the more advanced settings on a router, this can often require annoying visits to a platform via desktop, rather than the seamless mobile app connectivity we have learned to enjoy for many of our modern services.\nWhat router system is best for my home office?\nYou need to decide whether the financial outlay for a whole mesh network is worth it. In larger homes with dead spots, mesh networking can provide a way to improve your Wi-Fi signal strength and coverage immediately.\nHowever, it can be expensive to overhaul your existing router setup for a large home. Going for a complete mesh system may be overkill unless you consistently have multiple users and connected devices competing for bandwidth.\nA Wi-Fi extender can be a worthwhile investment instead if you decide to stay with a traditional home router but need to expand coverage.\nSome mesh network systems, such as Google Wifi, Netgear Orbi, and Amazon Eero, are relatively cheap to set up if you don't need too many satellites.\nAlso: The best mesh Wi-Fi routers: Expert recommended\nIf you're the only person using your network and need a stable, powerful internet connection -- such as for resource-hungry work applications or gaming -- a traditional router and an Ethernet cable may be all you need for reliable and rapid internet access. Wired internet speeds should be quicker than wireless if the connection is working properly, and investing in a simple Ethernet cable, easy to find for no more than $10 or $15, could be enough. This could save you the cost of a complete overhaul.\nWi-Fi range extenders, too, could be considered an alternative to mesh if you need to boost coverage and throughput in some areas, and they will likely be less expensive than purchasing individual mesh nodes. Some vendors also offer mesh \"bolt-ons,\" such as Asus' AiMesh, which creates a mesh-like coverage wireless network without ripping everything out and starting again. However, the downside is that you will probably have to spend some time setting these bolt-ons up and tampering with your router's configurations.\nIs mesh Wi-Fi better for gaming?\nThe best way to answer this question is to consider latency. Overall, many mesh systems today trade extended coverage for potential downgrades to speed.\nIf your household has gamers using consoles casually, it shouldn't matter what type of router you use. However, professional and dedicated gamers will absolutely notice small lags or latency issues -- and they will want the best speed and stability available. In these cases, a wired, traditional router is likely your best bet.\nI prefer an Ethernet, cabled connection for PC, Internet-based gaming and sessions with friends, and while my mesh network would probably be adequate, I don't want to risk lagging.\nIs mesh Wi-Fi better than an extender?\nWhile both mesh Wi-Fi and extenders will improve the coverage of your home, there are disadvantages to both.\nMesh systems require investment and the cost can add up quickly, but they provide seamless transitions between Wi-Fi access points dotted around your home. Furthermore, you can rapidly change settings or perform updates via mobile apps.\nWi-Fi extenders can't be tweaked so easily. However, they are cheaper and are the best option if you just want to tackle a few dead zones, as you just need to plug one into your main router. Keep in mind that, unlike mesh nodes, Wi-Fi extenders won't improve congestion or eradicate bottlenecks.\nCheck your ISP first\nBefore changing your setup, you should review your ISP package. If you're subscribed to a low-speed offering, or your internet provider throttles your speed at peak times, new equipment is not going to help. Instead, a package upgrade could be a better option.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

Since it technically combined the best of OpenAI's models, the company had it replace all of its legacy models in ChatGPT -- and users were not happy.\n(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, ZDNET's parent company, filed an April 2025 lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)\nAlso: I tested GPT-5's coding skills, and it was so bad that I'm sticking with GPT-4o (for now)\nPaid subscribers, including ChatGPT Plus and Pro users, previously had access to GPT-4o, multiple reasoning models, including o3, o4-mini, and o4-mini-high, and research previews of GPT-4.5 and GPT-4.1. ChatGPT Pro users had a couple of additional perks, such as o3 pro mode. As a result, when OpenAI removed access to these models as it rolled out GPT-5, many subscribers' workflows were disturbed; some people even cancelled their subscriptions.\nOpenAI noticed the feedback and implemented changes immediately. OpenAI Sam Altman said on X, \"We will let Plus users choose to continue to use 4o. We will watch usage as we think about how long to offer legacy models for.\" In a separate post, he added, \"We for sure underestimated how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them, even if GPT-5 performs better in most ways.\"\nUsers can now see legacy models, but activating the option requires some extra steps. Here's how to get started.\nHow to access ChatGPT's legacy models\nWhat you'll need: To access the legacy models, you'll need to subscribe to one of ChatGPT's premium tiers. ChatGPT Plus costs $20 per month and includes other perks such as higher usage limits for many of OpenAI's latest features. ChatGPT Pro is meant for super users and retails at $200 per month.\n1. Make sure you have a ChatGPT subscription\nWhen you log into your ChatGPT account, you'll see your subscription/account tier in the bottom left-hand corner, where your name is displayed. If it says \"Free,\" you'll want to click on it and hit the \"Upgrade plan option.\"\nAlso: Is ChatGPT Plus really worth $20 when the free version offers so many premium features?\nOnce you do, you can opt to subscribe to one of the higher subscription tiers: either ChatGPT Plus for $20 per month or ChatGPT Pro for $200 per month. You'll then see a chart comparing the plans and their perks, pictured above.\n2. Toggle on the option to see legacy models\nOnce you have a Plus or Pro account, by default, you will have the option to toggle between GPT-5, GPT-5 Thinking, and, if you are a Pro user, GPT-5 Pro. However, you also have the option to access legacy models as long as you toggle the setting on.\nAll you need to do is click on the bottom left-hand corner with your name and click Settings. Under \"General,\" which is the first page that comes up, toggle on \"Show legacy models.\" Then, the model picker toggle will also show the \"Legacy model\" option.\n3. Select the desired model and start your prompts\nWhen the \"show legacy models\" option is toggled on, to actually use the model, you just have to click on the model picker toggle, which appears when you click the model's name in the upper left-hand corner.\nAlso: GPT-5 bombed my coding tests, but redeemed itself with code analysis\nIf you are a ChatGPT Plus user, you can access GPT-4o in addition to GPT-5. If you are a Pro user, you can access the entire suite of legacy models, including GPT-4o, GPT-4.5 (research preview), o3, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, and GPT-4.1-mini. Whichever you select will be the one to output your response."

Microsoft has stated, forcefully, that it will not revise those requirements. You will also hit roadblocks if your PC doesn't have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0, or if the TPM is not enabled.\nAlso: Two ways to get free Windows 10 security updates through October 2026\nThat might be the official policy, but -- as with everything Windows-related -- it pays to read the fine print.\nThose pesky restrictions prevent you from automatically upgrading to Windows 11 using Windows Update or the Windows 11 Installation Assistant. Yet, as I detail in ZDNET's Windows 11 FAQ, there are documented workarounds for most PCs that were originally built for Windows 10.\nOver the past few years, Microsoft has played a cat-and-mouse game with enthusiasts, adding occasional speed bumps that make it more difficult to bypass these compatibility checks. There are workarounds for most modern PCs, but some older devices, especially those built using AMD processors, might be out of luck. The instructions below take all those developments into account.\nAlso: Can your old PC handle the Windows 11 upgrade? How to find out - before you try\nThese instructions also assume that you have a PC running a retail or OEM edition of Windows 10 (Home or Pro) and that you are signed in as an administrator on the PC you want to upgrade.\nWhich option should you choose?\nPlease don't skip over this section.\nThis article describes two upgrade options. To take advantage of the workaround described in option 1 below, your computer must meet all the other requirements for Windows 11.\n- It must be configured to start up using UEFI, not a legacy BIOS configuration.\n- Secure Boot must be supported, although it does not need to be enabled. (But seriously, folks, you should enable Secure Boot.)\n- A TPM must be enabled; version 1.2 is OK, but a system without any TPM or with the TPM disabled will fail. Any PC that was originally designed for Windows 10 should include a TPM 2.0.\nTo check these details on a PC you're considering upgrading, run the System Information utility, Msinfo32.exe, and look at the System Summary page. Pay special attention to the BIOS Mode value. If it says \"Legacy,\" you'll need to reconfigure your system to UEFI mode (and convert your system disk from MBR to GPT partitioning) before you can install Windows 11 as a normal upgrade.\nAlso: Why Windows 11 requires a TPM - and how to get around it\nTo see whether your PC has a TPM enabled, run the Trusted Platform Module Management tool, Tpm.msc. If your computer includes a TPM and it's turned on, this app will display information about it. Under the TPM Manufacturer Information heading, check the specification version to confirm that it is 2.0. If there's no TPM, or if the TPM is disabled in firmware settings, you'll see a message that says \"Compatible TPM cannot be found.\"\nIf you're unable (or unwilling) to change from Legacy BIOS to UEFI, or if you have an older PC that doesn't have a TPM option at all, you'll need to use the second option, which takes advantage of an undocumented hack that allows you to bypass the compatibility checks and complete the upgrade. Skip to the Option 2 section of this post for details on how to use the free Rufus utility to perform this upgrade.\nAlso: How to install Windows 11 your way (and avoid Microsoft's restrictions)\nFinally, note that Microsoft added a new set of restrictions as part of the Windows 11 version 24H2 update. These changes require a CPU that supports specific instructions -- SSE4.2 and PopCnt. Most PCs with Intel CPUs from 2009 or later will meet this standard. AMD CPUs from 2013 or later should also meet these requirements. But it is impossible to upgrade to Windows 11 version 24H2 on a PC that was built in 2008 or earlier. For details, see \"Microsoft blocked your Windows 11 upgrade? This trusty tool can (probably) fix that.\"\nIf you plan to perform a clean installation of Windows 11, you can boot from installation media and run Windows Setup. That option skips the CPU compatibility check completely (but still requires a TPM and Secure Boot support). After the installation completes, you'll need to reinstall all your apps, restore your data files, and tweak settings to personalize your system preferences.\nWant to avoid all that hassle? Choose the option that's appropriate for your hardware.\nOption 1: Use this simple registry edit\nWith this registry edit, you can bypass CPU checks and accept any TPM version. Please be aware that this option requires that you run the Setup program from within your current Windows installation. You can't boot from a USB flash drive and install Windows 11 this way.\nThis process requires four steps.\n1. Change one key in the Windows registry\nYou need to make one small change to the Windows registry. For more than three years, this change was documented at Microsoft's support website, but the company removed those instructions in December 2024. (Here's an archived version of that support article.) This change tells the Windows 11 Setup program to skip the check for compatible CPUs and to allow installation on a PC with an older TPM (version 1.2). The usual warnings apply when working with the registry; I recommend you make a complete backup before proceeding.\nOpen Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) and navigate to the following key:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Setup\\MoSetup\nIf the MoSetup key doesn't exist, you need to create it. Right-click the node for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Setup in the left-hand navigation pane, then choose New > Key. Name it MoSetup and press Enter.\nAlso: Wiping your Windows laptop? Here's the simplest way to erase all personal data\nSelect the MoSetup key and then right-click in any empty space in the pane on the right. Choose the option to create a new DWORD value. (Don't choose the QWORD option!)\nReplace the default name for that key by typing the text AllowUpgradesWithUnsupportedTPMOrCPU and then press Enter. Then double-click the new value and change the \"Value data\" box to 1. The result should look like this:\nCheck for typos before proceeding -- Windows is frustratingly literal about the contents of the registry, and if you misspell the key or value name, your upgrade will fail. Click OK to save your change, and then restart your PC.\n2. Download the Windows 11 ISO\nOn the PC you want to upgrade, go to the Windows 11 Download page (aka.ms/DownloadWindows11) and choose the option at the bottom of the page, \"Download Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO) for x64 devices.\" Save the ISO file in your Downloads folder.\nNote that this is a big file. Depending on the speed of your internet connection, the download could take a while.\nAlso: The ultimate Windows 11 upgrade guide: Everything you need to know\nFor those running Windows with English (UK) as the selected language, choose English (United States) when prompted for a product language. Several readers have reported that choosing English International results in an upgrade that does not allow you to keep installed apps and data files.\n3. Mount the ISO file in File Explorer\nAfter the download completes, open File Explorer and double-click the ISO file you downloaded in the previous step. Doing so mounts the file as a virtual DVD drive in its own folder, with its own drive letter.\n4. Run Windows Setup\nIn File Explorer, find the Setup.exe file in the virtual drive you opened in the previous step and double-click it to begin the upgrade. You'll see a stern warning about compatibility issues and the possibility that performing an upgrade will mean you are not entitled to future updates. You can safely click Accept to move past this message. (For details on what that warning message really means, see \"Is Microsoft really going to cut off security updates for your 'unsupported' Windows 11 PC?\" Spoiler: They are not going to cut off security updates.) After you click OK on that dialog box, your upgrade should proceed without any serious issues.\nIf you're upgrading from the same edition (Home or Pro), you'll have three options: You can keep your apps, settings, and files (Full Upgrade); keep your data files but start fresh with apps and settings (Keep Data Only); or start completely fresh (Clean Install).\nOption 2: Use the free Rufus utility\nOn older PCs without a TPM and on PCs that don't support Secure Boot, you'll need to use an undocumented hack to bypass the compatibility checker. You can do this manually by replacing the Appraiserres.dll file (in the Sources subfolder on the Windows 11 installer drive) with a zero-byte version and then making a series of registry edits. But it's simpler to use the free, open-source Rufus utility to create installation media (on a USB flash) drive that includes these tweaks automatically.\nTo get started, download Rufus version 4.6 or later. Earlier versions won't work, thanks to changes Microsoft made in October 2024 to its compatibility checking tools. For details of how the newer versions work, see \"Microsoft blocked your Windows 11 upgrade? This just-released tool can get the job done.\" In addition, be aware that using Rufus will not allow you to bypass the new restrictions on very old PCs that were introduced with Windows 11 version 24H2.\nIf you have a PC with a CPU that lacks support for SSE4.2 and PopCnt instructions, not even Rufus can help. (Of course, any PC that fails that test is nearly 20 years old and probably deserves to be retired.)\nAlso: Yes, you can upgrade that old PC to Windows 11, even if Microsoft says no. These readers proved it\nTo get started, you'll need to download the Windows 11 ISO. Be sure to save it to the Downloads folder of your Windows system drive so you can find it easily. You'll also need a USB flash drive of at least 16 GB in size. You will reformat this drive as part of the process, so back up any data on that drive first -- and do not store the Windows 11 ISO here!\n- Download Rufus from the developer's site or from the Microsoft Store and run the app.\n- Choose the USB drive and then choose the \"Disk or ISO image\" option.\n- Click the Select button, choose the Windows 11 ISO you downloaded earlier, and then click Start.\n- In the Windows User Experience dialog, select the first checkbox to remove hardware requirements, as shown in the screenshot below.\n- Click OK to begin creating the drive.\nAfter Rufus successfully creates your installer, open that USB drive in File Explorer, and double-click Setup. Do not try to upgrade by booting from that USB drive and performing a clean install; it won't work.\nAs is the case with the other option, you'll see a warning about compatibility issues. It's a scare tactic. (For details on what the language in that warning message actually means, see \"Is Microsoft really going to cut off security updates for your 'unsupported' Windows 11 PC?\") After you click Accept on that dialog box, your upgrade should proceed without any serious issues.\nAlso: Microsoft blocked your Windows 11 upgrade? This trusty tool can (probably) fix that\nMy ZDNET colleague Lance Whitney has more details on the other options available with Rufus in \"How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and bypass Microsoft's restrictions).\"\nDid your upgrade work?\nIf you've tried this upgrade, I want to hear about your experience.
