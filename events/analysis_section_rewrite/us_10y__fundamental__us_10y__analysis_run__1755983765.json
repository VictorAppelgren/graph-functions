      "feedback": "Your draft is a good start but still reads like a high‑level overview rather than a world‑class, multi‑year structural thesis. To sharpen it, first anchor every claim in a source ID (e.g., “IBM’s pause on 26 000 back‑office roles—30 % AI‑replaceable—cited in 4LQD15CFU‑1” and “JUST Capital’s Workers Leaders Index outperformed the Russell 1000 by 17.3 % as of Aug 5 2025, 4LQD15CFU‑4”). Next, lay out a clear causal chain: macro shock (oil crisis or AI automation) → industry demand shift (compact cars or AI‑ready roles) → firm policy reaction (product redesign or workforce investment) → productivity/turnover effects → earnings and valuation multiples. Embed first‑principles anchors—real‑rate differentials, productivity gains from higher worker quality, and the policy reaction function (speed of hiring/training vs. layoffs). Quantify every regime transition: Ford’s sales fell from 459 k to 253 k units (JVKCZAPVG‑1), Costco’s sales jumped 11.7 % (source 6), IBM’s projected 7 800 job cuts (source 1). Show index values explicitly (Workers Leaders 35.95 % vs. Russell 1000 17.18 %, 4LQD15CFU‑4). Structure the piece with headings (First‑Principles, Scenario, Base Case, Risks, Watch Signals, Confidence) and use bullet points for clarity. Avoid generic platitudes; instead, cite the 20 % of JUST 100 firms disclosing AI talent initiatives (source 5) and the 84 % mentioning AI in disclosures. Finally, tie the market transmission to equity premiums: higher worker quality → lower cost of capital → higher P/E. With these edits, the analysis will meet the depth, specificity, and citation density required for a world‑class, multi‑year structural thesis.",
