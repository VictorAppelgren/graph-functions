  "title": "Maduro calls on China as US mounts pressure on Venezuela. Will it answer?",
  "description": "While it might seem minor it was yet another sign of Venezuela\u2019s need to publicize its rapprochement with China in the midst of tension with the US.",
  "content": "Amid the sharp escalation in tensions between the United States and Venezuela, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro mentioned China, the United States\u2019 biggest economic rival, during a speech about education in the country.\n\nWhile speaking about tutorials to learn how to do new things during the closing of the \u201cFirst Pedagogical Congress of Bolivarian Teachers,\u201d Maduro paused to present his new cell phone, which, he said, was a gift from China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping.\n\nMaduro said he communicated with Xi through that new phone by satellite.\n\n\u201cYou want to learn something, you look for a tutorial. I want to learn how to use that camera that the cameraman has there, you put \u2018camera tutorial such-and-such.\u2019 I want to learn how to handle this new Huawei phone (China\u2019s flagship brand in mobile devices), which is the most advanced in the world\u2026 This was given to me by President Xi Jinping, of China, I have it here. I communicate by satellite with him,\u201d Maduro commented at the closing event.\n\n\u201cNi hao, ni hao (hello). Xiexie, xiexie (thank you),\u201d the Venezuelan president immediately added while pretending to have a phone call in Mandarin.\n\nWhile it might seem minor, it was yet another sign of Venezuela\u2019s need to publicize its rapprochement with China in the midst of tension with the US.\n\nIn addition to Xi Jinping\u2019s \u201cgift,\u201d there have been other nods to China in the past week, including, a diplomatic visit and a message from the Asian country, both of which took place on Thursday.\n\nMaduro met with Lan Hu, China\u2019s ambassador to Venezuela, and celebrated the progress between the two countries, especially in the economy, he said.\n\n\u201cI am happy with the progress of this year 2025 in our mutual cooperation with sister China, especially in economy, science, technology and artificial intelligence projects,\u201d Maduro wrote on social media.\n\nSince his appointment as ambassador to Venezuela in May 2023, Hu has celebrated relations with the Latin American country and economic progress, as well as joining in on criticizing pressure from Washington.\n\nLast year, on the sidelines of the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Venezuela, Hu criticized \u201cunilateral coercive measures\u201d of the US.\n\n\u201cChina and Venezuela are united in defending the rights and interests of developing countries in the face of US unilateral coercive measures, so as to build a more just and equitable multipolar world, based on mutual respect,\u201d Hu said.\n\nThese words from the Chinese ambassador came around the same time the US expressed concern about the arrests of opposition activists ahead of Venezuela\u2019s 2024 presidential elections.\n\nMaduro was later proclaimed the winner by electoral authorities, who are under the tight control of Maduro\u2019s ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV).\n\nThe opposition questioned the electoral process, claiming that its candidate had won the vote, receiving the support of much of the international community. Maduro\u2019s government assures that the elections were legitimate, although the detailed results have never been published.\n\nChina rejects the \u2018threat of the use of force\u2019\n\nBeijing shared its concerns following the recent US military deployment in Caribbean waters near Venezuela.\n\n\u201cChina opposes any move that violates the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and a country\u2019s sovereignty and security. We oppose the use or threat of force in international relations and the interference of external forces in Venezuela\u2019s internal affairs under any pretext. We hope that the United States will do more things conducive to peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean region,\u201d Mao Ning, a spokesman for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, said Thursday after being asked about the issue at a press conference.\n\nThis week, the Trump administration carried out a major military deployment in the waters surrounding Latin America and the Caribbean as part of an intensified effort to combat drug cartels, two US defense officials told CNN.\n\nThe deployment \u2014 which comes as the US hardens the drug trafficking narrative about Maduro and his government \u2014 also includes a nuclear-powered attack submarine, additional P8 Poseidon reconnaissance jets, several destroyers and a guided-missile cruiser as part of the mission, the officials added.\n\nFor his part, Maduro announced the deployment of 4.5 million militiamen throughout the national territory, and said that \u201cno empire is going to touch the sacred ground of Venezuela,\u201d and minimized the \u201cthreats to peace\u201d of the country.\n\nThe president assured that his country has the defensive capacity to avoid a confrontation.\n\n\u201cLet the world know, let the empires know: Venezuela today more than ever has what it takes. That is why we are living in peace and we are going to continue at peace,\u201d Maduro said during a televised ceremony. \u201cWe carry the strength of David versus Goliath,\u201d he added before recounting more details of the biblical story.\n\nMeanwhile, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the US is prepared to \u201cuse all the resources of its power\u201d with the goal of curbing the \u201cflow of drugs into the country and bringing those responsible to justice,\u201d after being consulted about the deployment of three ships with 4,000 military personnel in Caribbean waters.\n\nA US Department of Defense official told CNN that the deployed ships had not received orders to head to the edge of Venezuela\u2019s territorial sea, which has about 4,000 kilometers of coastline.\n\nThe relationship with Beijing has been commercially useful for Caracas for some time, while it is mired in a deep political and economic crisis.\n\n\u201cThe support that Venezuela has had (from China), especially at the economic level, has helped prevent the deepening of this deep economic crisis,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Antonio Hern\u00e1ndez Mac\u00edas, a researcher in Latin American Studies from Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico (UNAM), told CNN.\n\nChina has a trade surplus with Venezuela: it exports around US$3.45 billion in products to the South American country, while it barely imports $739 million, which means a surplus of $2.71 billion for the Asian economy, according to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC) updated until 2023.\n\nIn this sense, China has economically benefited from its relationship with Venezuela, whose main export product to the world is oil, the OEC adds.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States has a trade deficit with Venezuela, as it exports fewer products to Venezuela than it buys from it. The trade balance is in favor of Venezuela by more than US$ 1.3 billion, according to OEC data.\n\nSo, because Venezuela is a strategic ally for China in the economic sphere, it seeks to take care of its interests in the region by showing its stance against the deployment of the United States, said the UNAM expert.\n\n\u201cThe oil that exists in the Essequibo, this territory that Venezuela and Guyana are disputing, plays a crucial role in this issue (\u2026) Oil is not only being exploited by the United States, but there are also Chinese companies in this region,\u201d explained Hern\u00e1ndez Mac\u00edas.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio shared a statement on Friday by the Guyanese government, which expressed its \u201cgrave concern\u201d about \u201cthe threat to peace and security in the region posed by transnational organized crime and narco-terrorism, which often involve criminal networks\u201d like Venezuela\u2019s Cartel of the Suns.\n\nRecently, the Trump administration reiterated its claim that Maduro is the leader of the criminal group of the Cartel of the Suns and doubled the reward to $50 million for information leading to the arrest of the Venezuelan president. In addition, the US designated the Cartel of the Suns as an international terrorist organization. The accusations against Maduro for alleged drug trafficking, repeatedly rejected by the Government of Venezuela, are not new. They date back to 2020, when the US pointed to Maduro as the leader of the Cartel of the Suns and initially offered $15 million for information leading to his arrest.\n\nAmid this renewed confrontation between the United States and Venezuela, \u201cwhat interests (China), beyond defending the Venezuelan government, is that the conditions exist to have access to the energy resources of this entire area,\u201d added Hern\u00e1ndez Mac\u00edas.\n\nOn Friday, Reuters reported that a private Chinese company has begun exploiting two oil fields in Venezuela and plans to invest more than $1 billion in a project to produce 60,000 barrels per day of crude by the end of 2026, under a 20-year production-sharing contract signed in 2024.\n\nWhile there is a mutual economic benefit, Maduro remains isolated from the world at large and China\u2019s position on the US military deployment speaks volumes globally, according to Gabriel Pastor, an analyst at the Uruguay-based think tank Centro de Estudios de la Realidad Econ\u00f3mica y Social (CERES).\n\n\u201c(China\u2019s position) is saying something that more or less everyone can expect, but it does not mean that China is going to intervene in the conflict by supporting Venezuela,\u201d Pastor told CNN. It is a \u201cpolitically correct statement\u201d that does not change anything for Venezuela, since \u201cno specific action\u201d is announced to support the Latin American country.\n\nCNN\u2019s Gonzalo Zegarra, Natasha Bertrand and Germ\u00e1n Padinger contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Mientras el l\u00edder opositor venezolano Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia visit\u00f3 varios pa\u00edses de la regi\u00f3n con el argumento de que gan\u00f3 las elecciones presidenciales y mostrando las actas que, dice, respaldan esa victoria, el presidente Nicol\u00e1s Maduro tiene todo listo para su investidura. Analistas consultados por CNN coinciden que la continuidad en el poder de Maduro no se frenar\u00e1 a pesar de la gira internacional del opositor.\nGonz\u00e1lez Urrutia ha recibido el respaldo de varios pa\u00edses \u2014como Argentina, Estados Unidos y Ecuador, cuyos gobiernos lo reconocen como presidente electo\u2014 y asegura que volver\u00e1 a Venezuela para asumir la Presidencia el 10 de enero, cuando comienza un nuevo per\u00edodo de gobierno. Mientras Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia se reuni\u00f3 con los presidentes de Argentina, Uruguay, Estados Unidos, Panam\u00e1 y Rep\u00fablica Dominicana, en Venezuela las autoridades amenazaron no solo con arrestar al opositor, sino tambi\u00e9n a los expresidentes de la regi\u00f3n que anunciaron que viajar\u00e1n con \u00e9l al pa\u00eds para la investidura este viernes.\nEl jueves, en medio de las manifestaciones de la oposici\u00f3n y el oficialismo, Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, dijo en Rep\u00fablica Dominicana que se ver\u00eda \u201cmuy pronto\u201d con sus seguidores en Caracas. Salvo la denuncia \u2014por parte de su movimiento\u2014 de detenci\u00f3n temporal de la opositora Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, que el Gobierno neg\u00f3, la situaci\u00f3n en Venezuela continu\u00f3 como ha seguido desde la jornada electoral del 28 de julio: Maduro respaldado por las instituciones leales y que responden al Ejecutivo y una oposici\u00f3n que intenta conseguir apoyos internacionales y en las calles para un cambio.\nGonz\u00e1lez Urrutia no tiene el poder\nEl Consejo Nacional Electoral (CNE) declar\u00f3 ganador a Maduro de las elecciones y esa decisi\u00f3n fue ratificada por el Tribunal Supremo de Justicia en sentencia de la Sala Electoral. El anuncio de su triunfo fue reconocido por varios gobiernos aliados, como China, Rusia, Cuba, Bolivia, Nicaragua y Honduras.\nPara la analista internacional Giovanna De Michele, Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia no tiene opci\u00f3n de asumir el poder.\n\u201cMientras Maduro tenga el apoyo de los poderes constituidos en Venezuela y fundamentalmente de la institucionalidad militar \u2014que es el que tiene, digamos, la responsabilidad de manejar, controlar, administrar, regular los \u00f3rganos represivos del Estado\u2014 pues no hay ninguna posibilidad de que todos estos movimientos puedan tener alg\u00fan final distinto a la juramentaci\u00f3n de Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u201d, le dijo De Michele a CNN.\nLa oposici\u00f3n mayoritaria no reconoce la proclamaci\u00f3n de Maduro y observadores internacionales como el Centro Carter y la Organizaci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas dijeron que los resultados anunciados por el CNE carec\u00edan de legitimidad.\nAdem\u00e1s, varios medios de comunicaci\u00f3n y agencias internacionales que revisaron las actas, as\u00ed como el propio an\u00e1lisis de CNN\u2014 indican que el recuento de votos publicado por la oposici\u00f3n es aut\u00e9ntico.\nEl profesor universitario y analista internacional Eduardo Mart\u00ednez explica que si bien en este momento Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia \u201ctiene un poco m\u00e1s de peso\u201d a nivel internacional que Juan Guaid\u00f3 \u2014quien fue presidente de la Asamblea Nacional y tras su proclamaci\u00f3n en 2019 como \u201cpresidente encargado\u201d, fue considerado como presidente interino por varios pa\u00edses del mundo\u2014 \u201cla verdad es que \u00e9l (Gonz\u00e1lez) sabe perfectamente que si no es por presi\u00f3n internacional no tiene ning\u00fan chance de asumir en Venezuela el 10 de enero\u201d.\nPero De Michele descarta que la presi\u00f3n internacional tenga un efecto: \u201cNo hay forma alguna de que la presi\u00f3n internacional pueda generar los cambios que se esperan en la pol\u00edtica, ni de Venezuela ni de ning\u00fan otro pa\u00eds. Los cambios, cuando se generan, se generan por fuerzas internas del Estado y sobre todo con la participaci\u00f3n, el apoyo incondicional de los organismos de seguridad del Estado. Si eso no se da, no hay posibilidad alguna de un cambio\u201d.\nEn este sentido, Mart\u00ednez, profesor en geopol\u00edtica, asegura que \u201cla justicia no va a resolver otra cosa\u201d: ni el fiscal general ni el Consejo Nacional Electoral van a cambiar de opini\u00f3n. \u201cMaduro no va a renunciar a esta postura\u201d.\nLa comparaci\u00f3n con Guaid\u00f3 y el escenario de un gobierno en el exilio\nDe ah\u00ed en adelante, opina Mart\u00ednez, un problema ser\u00eda que Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia \u201ctermine siendo un nuevo Juan Guaid\u00f3\u201d, cuya experiencia \u201cfue lamentable\u201d porque no llam\u00f3 a elecciones. \u201cEra para eso que estaba en ese puesto de interinamente, recorriendo el mundo sin lograr nada\u201d, le dijo a CNN.\n\u201c(Gonz\u00e1lez) Urrutia promete volver sabiendo que puede ser arrestado en cualquier lugar de Venezuela, es decir, que est\u00e1 poniendo en riesgo hasta su propia vida. Eso le da un poco m\u00e1s de sentido a toda esta gira. Al resultado final creo que no va a cambiar demasiado\u201d\nDe Michele indica que Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia podr\u00eda llegar a establecer una suerte de gobierno en el exilio, el derecho internacional p\u00fablico establece que es una figura v\u00e1lida. \u201cPero en la pr\u00e1ctica, los gobiernos en el exilio tienden a diluirse con el tiempo en la medida en que no tienen capacidad alguna de incidir sobre la vida de los gobernados, que ser\u00edan los que estar\u00edan dentro del territorio venezolano\u201d.\nGuaid\u00f3 \u201cestableci\u00f3 un gobierno paralelo dentro de Venezuela. Probablemente, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez podr\u00eda establecer un gobierno fuera de Venezuela, pero el resultado va a ser exactamente el mismo\u201d, le dijo la analista a CNN.\nGonz\u00e1lez Urrutia no tendr\u00eda capacidad para decretar un aumento de salario, para incidir sobre la pol\u00edtica impositiva, para ofrecer un pasaporte a los venezolanos, ni para controlar un consulado para que los venezolanos puedan hacer sus registros y dem\u00e1s tr\u00e1mites, dice la experta. Tampoco podr\u00eda abrir una embajada.\n\u201cLo que (Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia) s\u00ed pudiera hacer, y esto es un dato bien importante que no hay que subestimar, es manejar algunos recursos en el exterior que todav\u00eda est\u00e1n en manos de la gente de cuando Guaid\u00f3\u201d, pero eso no tendr\u00eda ning\u00fan impacto en el bienestar de los venezolanos, dice De Michele\nEl factor de los militares\nGonz\u00e1lez Urrutia public\u00f3 el domingo pasado un video en sus redes sociales en el que les dice a los militares venezolanos que, a partir del 10 de enero ser\u00e1 su comandante en jefe, y les pide cumplir con su misi\u00f3n de defender la soberan\u00eda para permitir la transici\u00f3n que encabeza. Es el llamado m\u00e1s claro del dirigente para una actuaci\u00f3n militar que respalde su intenci\u00f3n de tomar posesi\u00f3n. Pero el ministro de la Defensa de Venezuela, Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, afirm\u00f3 el lunes que la Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana de Venezuela (FANB) reconocer\u00e1 a Nicol\u00e1s Maduro como el presidente del pa\u00eds y rechaz\u00f3 el llamado hecho por el l\u00edder opositor en el exilio.\nY la FANB es el eje sobre el que Maduro mantiene su poder. \u201cMaduro depende completamente de la FANB. Sin la estructura y la capacidad de la Fuerza Armada no tiene forma de sostener el r\u00e9gimen\u201d, dijo a CNN Andrei Serbin Pont, presidente de la Coordinadora Regional de Investigaciones Econ\u00f3micas y Sociales (Cries) y especialista en Seguridad y Defensa. Pero ese sost\u00e9n, seg\u00fan las declaraciones recientes de Padrino L\u00f3pez, sigue intacto.\nSin el respaldo de las militares, coinciden los analistas, no hay posibilidad de que los opositores consigan un cambio de poder en el pa\u00eds. Giovanna de Michele dice que \u201csi no hay apoyo de los poderes constituidos dentro de Venezuela y fundamentalmente de la institucionalidad militar en Venezuela\u201d, Gonz\u00e1lez no podr\u00eda tener ejercicio alguno del poder.\nCon informaci\u00f3n de Iv\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Sarmenti, Rey Rodr\u00edguez, Germ\u00e1n Padinger y Alfredo Meza."

Sin embargo, tambi\u00e9n ofrece a los mandos militares estadounidenses \u2014y al presidente\u2014 una amplia gama de opciones en caso de que Trump ordene una acci\u00f3n militar. El ARG/MEU, por ejemplo, tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un elemento de combate a\u00e9reo.\nEl despliegue de la Unidad Expedicionaria de la Marina, sin embargo, ha suscitado inquietudes entre algunos funcionarios de defensa, que temen que los infantes de Marina no est\u00e9n capacitados para llevar a cabo operaciones de interceptaci\u00f3n de drogas y lucha contra el narcotr\u00e1fico. Si eso forma parte de su misi\u00f3n, tendr\u00e1n que depender en gran medida de la Guardia Costera, seg\u00fan afirmaron los funcionarios.\nEstas unidades expedicionarias han desempe\u00f1ado un papel fundamental en el pasado en el apoyo a operaciones de evacuaci\u00f3n a gran escala; por ejemplo, una estuvo estacionada durante meses en el Mediterr\u00e1neo oriental, en medio de las tensiones entre Israel, Hamas e Ir\u00e1n.\nUn funcionario de la Marina dijo a CNN que la unidad de expedici\u00f3n \u201cest\u00e1 lista para ejecutar \u00f3rdenes legales y apoyar a los comandantes combatientes en las necesidades que se les soliciten\u201d.\nLas fuerzas estadounidenses desplegaron destructores en las zonas cercanas a la frontera entre Estados Unidos y M\u00e9xico en marzo para apoyar la misi\u00f3n de seguridad fronteriza del Comando Norte de Estados Unidos y reforzar la presencia de Estados Unidos en el hemisferio occidental. Sin embargo, los recursos adicionales que se est\u00e1n trasladando ahora depender\u00e1n del Comando Sur de Estados Unidos y est\u00e1n destinados a apoyarlo durante al menos los pr\u00f3ximos meses, seg\u00fan uno de los funcionarios.\nCNN inform\u00f3 anteriormente que un memor\u00e1ndum firmado por el secretario de Defensa Pete Hegseth a principios de este a\u00f1o afirmaba que la \u201cprioridad principal\u201d del Ej\u00e9rcito estadounidense es defender el territorio nacional, y ordenaba al Pent\u00e1gono \u201ccerrar nuestras fronteras, repeler cualquier forma de invasi\u00f3n, incluyendo la migraci\u00f3n masiva ilegal, el tr\u00e1fico de drogas, el tr\u00e1fico y la trata de personas y otras actividades delictivas, y deportar a los extranjeros ilegales en coordinaci\u00f3n con el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional\u201d.\nEl mismo memor\u00e1ndum tambi\u00e9n solicitaba formalmente a los funcionarios del Pent\u00e1gono \u201copciones militares cre\u00edbles\u201d para garantizar el acceso sin restricciones de Estados Unidos al canal de Panam\u00e1, inform\u00f3 CNN en ese momento.\nCon informaci\u00f3n de Zachary Cohen, de CNN."

On Monday, Reuters reported that three US Navy destroyers and some 4,000 military personnel would arrive at the edge of Venezuela\u2019s territorial waters within the next 36 hours.\nOn Tuesday, however, a US Department of Defense official said there are currently no US ships in the area and nor have the ships received orders to head there. Venezuelan territory has almost 2,500 miles of coastline.\n\u201cThis week I am going to activate a special plan to guarantee coverage with more than 4.5 million militiamen throughout the national territory. Militias prepared, activated, and armed,\u201d Maduro said during a televised meeting with the country\u2019s governors and mayors.\nThe president described the \u201cextravagant, bizarre and outlandish\u201d US threats as \u201crotten rehashes,\u201d without specifying what he was referring to.\n\u201cWe defend our seas, our skies, and our lands. We liberated them. We guard and patrol them. No empire will touch the sacred soil of Venezuela, nor should it touch the sacred soil of South America,\u201d he emphasized in his speech.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked Tuesday about a possible troop deployment to Venezuela following reports of the military buildup. \u201cPresident (Donald) Trump has been very clear and consistent. He\u2019s prepared to use every element of American power to stop drugs from flooding into our country and to bring those responsible to justice,\u201d she said.\nShe also reiterated the US government\u2019s position that Maduro \u201cis not a legitimate president.\u201d Washington and Caracas have not had formal bilateral diplomatic relations since 2019.\nThe Venezuelan government rejected Washington\u2019s accusation of drug trafficking, saying in a statement that the US was resorting to \u201cthreats and defamation.\u201d\nThe Venezuelan Militia, which was created in 2005 by the late President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and formally established in 2010, is part of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces (FANB) and has as its vision the \u201cincorporation of the organized people\u201d to guarantee the \u201ccomprehensive defense of the nation.\u201d\nMaduro said he will move forward with a plan to activate peasant and worker militias \u201cin all factories and workplaces in the country.\u201d\n\u201cMissiles and rifles for the working class, to defend our homeland,\u201d he said.\nThe Venezuelan Ministry of Defense says on its website that the FANB \u201cis made up of around 95,000 to 150,000 active combatants\u201d and \u201ca growing National Militia made up of hundreds of thousands of people capable of serving as reservists.\u201d\nThe Global Fire Power website, which specializes in military analyses and uses official statistics or makes estimates when they are not available, ranks Venezuela 50th in military power in the 2025 ranking, among 145 countries. The United States ranks first, Russia second, and China third.\nA few weeks ago, the Trump administration doubled the reward to $50 million for information leading to the arrest of Maduro, whom it described as \u201cone of the world\u2019s largest drug traffickers,\u201d head of the Cartel of the Suns, and a threat to US national security.\nThe Venezuelan government and other institutions in the country rejected the announcement, and several Chavista figures have dismissed the allegations. Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello has said that the Cartel de los Soles is an \u201cinvention\u201d of the US, and the Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez has \u2018categorically\u2019 rejected Washington\u2019s \u201cridiculous\u201d accusations.\nCNN\u2019s Michael Rios and Haley Britzky contributed to this report."

      "text": "Hubei Media Group: We noted that Foreign Minister Wang Yi concluded his visit to Afghanistan. Could you share more details with us?\nMao Ning: On August 20, Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Afghanistan. He met with Afghan Prime Minister Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund and Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani, had talks with Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, and attended the sixth China-Afghanistan-Pakistan Foreign Ministers\u2019 Dialogue.\nForeign Minister Wang Yi said that China advocates equality among all countries regardless of size and that all countries should treat each other as equals and work for mutually beneficial cooperation. The world should not make the rich richer and the poor poorer. All countries, including Afghanistan, have the right to thrive and prosper. China pursues a foreign policy of friendship towards all Afghan people. We respect the Afghan people\u2019s choice and support the Afghan government in exercising prudent governance, focusing on development, firmly combating terrorism, and growing friendly ties with its neighbors to realize lasting peace and security.\nSince the China-Afghanistan-Pakistan Foreign Ministers\u2019 Dialogue resumed in 2022, the dialogue has produced positive results. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that China stands ready to work with the other two countries to deepen good-neighborliness and mutual trust and understand and support each other on issues concerning each other\u2019s core interests. The three sides need to have closer exchanges at various levels and consolidate strategic mutual trust. China supports Afghanistan and Pakistan in improving bilateral relations, deepening the integration of interests, properly handling differences through dialogue and consultation, and striving for steady and long-term trilateral cooperation. The three sides agree to make full use of the dialogue, strengthen exchanges and cooperation in various fields, and promote peace, stability, development and prosperity in the region.\nPrensa Latina: U.S. warships are patrolling the Caribbean Sea near Venezuela\u2019s coast and have warned they may use force on the excuse of fighting drugs. Presidents from Latin America and the Caribbean denounced these actions as a violation of regional peace and security. Would you share your opinion on this matter?\nMao Ning: China opposes any move that violates the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and a country\u2019s sovereignty and security. We oppose the use or threat of force in international relations and the interference of external forces in Venezuela\u2019s internal affairs under any pretext. We hope that the United States will do more things conducive to peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean region.\nShenzhen TV: We noted that China recently released the economic data for July, in which foreign trade was a highlight, with import and export of goods hitting a new high this year. Comments say that the continued growth of China\u2019s foreign trade speaks to the extensive global recognition of Chinese goods, and this will continue to drive the growth of China\u2019s economy. However, other analysis shows that the tariff war and other external risks have dealt a blow to global trade and mounted pressure on China\u2019s export market. What is your comment?\nMao Ning: Despite the complex and volatile external environment, China\u2019s foreign trade has continued to perform well. That reflects the strong resilience of China\u2019s economy and booming global demand for Chinese products. This is the combined result of China\u2019s effort to expand high-standard opening up, promote high-quality development, and improve and upgrade industries.\nFacts have proven that international trade based on comparative advantages enables common development and benefits all parties. China\u2019s quality products are popular around the world and its diversified and stable market is favored by many. This is not something that could be changed by tariff or trade wars. China will continue to share its development opportunities with other countries through open cooperation for win-win results.\nAFP: A new report by New Zealand\u2019s security service has accused China of being the most active country engaged in foreign interference in New Zealand. Does the Foreign Ministry have a response to this report?\nMao Ning: In recent years, the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service has repeatedly spread disinformation, groundlessly framed and attacked China, smeared the normal friendly exchanges between various sectors of the two countries, and harassed and intimidated Chinese people in New Zealand, which shows relevant agency\u2019s ideological bias and Cold War mentality. This does no good to mutual trust and runs counter to the two countries\u2019 consensus of enhancing people-to-people and cultural exchanges. China deplores and opposes it. We urge relevant agency in New Zealand to stop spreading lies, stop creating misperception, and contribute more to people-to-people and cultural exchanges between the two countries and the sound and steady development of bilateral relations.\nChina Daily: Declassified documents released recently by the Russian government show that during World War II, Japanese invaders in China planned an attack on the Soviet Union from Northeast China, and prepared for a bacterial warfare able to cause mass casualties, and for this purpose established Unit 731 in Harbin. The unit conducted research on various types of plague, anthrax, cholera and other bacterial diseases. They also carried out human experimentation, and detained Chinese and Russian people as well as Japanese death-row prisoners for these purposes. What is China\u2019s comment?\nMao Ning: During World War II, in blatant violation of international law, the Japanese army launched horrendous bacterial warfare against the Chinese people and conducted gruesome human experimentation, which were heinous crimes against humanity. The documents released by the Russian government show once again there are solid proofs of the bacterial warfare launched by Japanese militarists and there\u2019s no room for denial.\nTo earn respect, one must first respect history. To open up the future, one must draw lessons from the past. To not repeat the wrong path, one must learn never to forget. This year marks the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People\u2019s War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War. We urge Japan to reflect deeply on its history of aggression, respect the sentiments of the people of China and other victim nations, make a clean break with militarism, take concrete actions to get rid of the specter of militarism that still haunts it, and never let history repeat itself.\nNHK: A question related to Afghanistan. Last month, Russia formally recognized Afghan interim government. Does China now recognize the Taliban\u2019s interim government in Afghanistan?\nMao Ning: China is committed to a foreign policy of friendship towards all Afghan people. We stand ready to work with Afghanistan to promote bilateral relations.\nCCTV: It\u2019s reported that the readout released by China on Foreign Minister Wang Yi\u2019s talks with Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar claimed that the Indian side said \u201cTaiwan is part of China.\u201d Indian government sources said that the external affairs minister had been misquoted. India stressed that there was no change in its position on Taiwan, and India had a relationship with Taiwan that focuses on economic, technological and cultural ties and that this would continue. What\u2019s China\u2019s comment?\nMao Ning: China has released readouts on the talks between the Chinese and Indian foreign ministers. For the Chinese side, the Indian side\u2019s so-called \u201cclarification\u201d came as a surprise. We find it inconsistent with the facts. It would seem that some people in India have tried to undermine China\u2019s sovereignty on the Taiwan question and impede the improvement of China-India relations. China expresses serious concern and firmly opposes that.\nLet me stress that there is but one China in the world, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China\u2019s territory. This is a prevailing consensus among the international community, including India. We hope India will earnestly abide by the one-China principle, properly handle sensitive issues and promote the steady development of bilateral relations."

La democracia exige respeto a la voluntad de los votantes\u201d, public\u00f3 el m\u00e1s alto funcionario diplom\u00e1tico estadounidense mientras participaba en la cumbre del G20 en R\u00edo de Janeiro.\nEl anuncio marca un cambio significativo en la pol\u00edtica de EE.UU. hacia Venezuela: hasta ahora, EE.UU. y otros pa\u00edses hab\u00edan concluido que Gonz\u00e1lez hab\u00eda ganado m\u00e1s votos que el candidato oficialista, el presidente Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, en julio, pero no hab\u00edan llegado a reconocerlo como \u201cpresidente electo\u201d.\n\u201cEst\u00e1 claro para Estados Unidos, para las naciones democr\u00e1ticas de todo el mundo y para las organizaciones internacionales independientes que observaron las elecciones del 28 de julio que el candidato de la oposici\u00f3n Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia gan\u00f3 la mayor\u00eda de los votos. Eso lo convierte en el presidente electo\u201d, dijo un portavoz del Departamento de Estado a CNN este martes.\n\u201cEl pueblo venezolano expres\u00f3 de forma abrumadora e inequ\u00edvoca su deseo de un cambio democr\u00e1tico: las hojas de escrutinio de votos disponibles p\u00fablicamente as\u00ed lo dicen\u201d, agreg\u00f3.\nEn julio, las autoridades electorales venezolanas declararon ganador a Maduro en medio de acusaciones generalizadas de fraude electoral. La oposici\u00f3n venezolana recopil\u00f3 y public\u00f3 cientos de miles de actas de escrutinio y afirm\u00f3 que Gonz\u00e1lez gan\u00f3 con m\u00e1s del 70% de los votos.\nLos observadores internacionales del Centro Carter y la Organizaci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas, as\u00ed como el propio an\u00e1lisis de CNN, concluyeron que los recuentos de votos publicados por la oposici\u00f3n eran leg\u00edtimos.\nMaduro sigue firme en el poder en Caracas y ha calificado de \u201cfraudulentos\u201d los reclamos de la oposici\u00f3n.\nGonz\u00e1lez, que huy\u00f3 a Espa\u00f1a en septiembre temiendo por su seguridad, ha dicho anteriormente que tiene la intenci\u00f3n de regresar a Venezuela en las pr\u00f3ximas semanas para la investidura presidencial fijada para el 10 de enero."

El apoyo fue aplastante, seg\u00fan los resultados difundidos por el Consejo Nacional Electoral.\nGuyana, que a la fecha administra el territorio, dijo en ese momento que el referendo representaba una \u201camenaza existencial\u201d y un paso previo a la anexi\u00f3n.\nEn 2024, la Asamblea Nacional de Venezuela, aprob\u00f3 una ley de creaci\u00f3n del Estado de Guayana Esequiba, y en las elecciones de 2025 se eligi\u00f3 por primera vez a un gobernador y legisladores.\nGuyana, en tanto, rechaza la postura de Venezuela, a la que considera una interpretaci\u00f3n err\u00f3nea del Acuerdo de Ginebra de 1966, y asegura que la CIJ tiene jurisdicci\u00f3n vinculante para Guyana y Venezuela, de acuerdo con la carta fundacional de la ONU."

Se remontan a 2020, cuando EE.UU. se\u00f1al\u00f3 a Maduro como l\u00edder del Cartel de los Soles y ofreci\u00f3 US$ 15 millones por informaci\u00f3n que llevase a su arresto.\nEn ese momento, el presidente venezolano calific\u00f3 la recompensa y las acusaciones lanzadas por el gobierno de Estados Unidos como una \u201cacci\u00f3n extremadamente extremista\u201d y falsa. La semana pasada, el primer funcionario venezolano en reaccionar, fue el canciller, Yv\u00e1n Gil, que calific\u00f3 la duplicaci\u00f3n de la recompensa como como \u201cla cortina de humo m\u00e1s rid\u00edcula que hemos visto\u201d.\nLas reacciones del gobierno venezolano parecen, sin embargo, haber disuadido a la administraci\u00f3n Trump de multiplicar, en los \u00faltimos cinco a\u00f1os, el bot\u00edn por Maduro. La recompensa creci\u00f3 ahora a un punto in\u00e9dito. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9?\nTrump lanza la primera recompensa: US$ 15 millones\nDurante su primer mandato, Trump estableci\u00f3 una recompensa de US$ 15 millones por informaci\u00f3n que condujera al arresto de Maduro, despu\u00e9s de que su secretario de Justicia, William Barr, anunciara cargos de narcoterrorismo y corrupci\u00f3n contra el presidente de Venezuela.\nAdem\u00e1s, el Departamento de Estado ofreci\u00f3 recompensas de hasta US$ 10 millones por informaci\u00f3n relacionada con funcionarios clave del r\u00e9gimen de Maduro, que inclu\u00edan a Diosdado Cabello Rond\u00f3n, entonces presidente de la Asamblea Nacional Constituyente y hoy ministro del Interior, y el general (retirado) Hugo Carvajal Barrios, exdirector de Inteligencia Militar de Venezuela, hoy preso en Estados Unidos, entre otros.\nEl anuncio de la primera vez que se impuso una recompensa lleg\u00f3 a mediados de marzo de 2020, meses despu\u00e9s de que m\u00e1s de 50 pa\u00edses desconocieran a Maduro como presidente.\nA inicios de 2019, Estados Unidos, otras naciones y organismos internacionales hab\u00edan reconocido en su lugar al entonces presidente de la Asamblea Nacional de Venezuela, Juan Guaid\u00f3, como el l\u00edder del pa\u00eds.\nBiden sube la apuesta: US$ 25 millones\nUnos d\u00edas antes de llegar al fin de su mandato, el Gobierno de Joe Biden aument\u00f3 la recompensa despu\u00e9s de lo que un alto funcionario llam\u00f3 una \u201ctoma de posesi\u00f3n presidencial fraudulenta\u201d de Maduro para un tercer mandato en julio de 2024.\nEl Departamento de Estado de Estados Unidos dej\u00f3 la nueva recompensa en US$ 25 millones por informaci\u00f3n que condujera al arresto de Maduro y funcionarios alineados a \u00e9l, entre ellos el ahora ministro de Interior, Justicia y Paz, Diosdado Cabello Rond\u00f3n, y el ministro de Defensa, Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, por presuntamente cometer delitos relacionados con conspiraci\u00f3n para distribuir coca\u00edna, narcotr\u00e1fico y corrupci\u00f3n.\nAl respecto, Cabello Rond\u00f3n ha dicho que el Cartel de los Soles es un \u201cinvento\u201d de Estados Unidos y \u201cuna gran mentira para manipular\u201d. Mientras que Padrino L\u00f3pez ha rechazado \u201ccateg\u00f3ricamente\u201d a las \u201cbufonescas\u201d acusaciones, tild\u00e1ndolas de \u201cinjerencismo\u201d.\nMaduro fue proclamado ganador de las elecciones presidenciales de julio de 2024 por las autoridades electorales bajo el f\u00e9rreo control del gobernante Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV).\nLa oposici\u00f3n cuestion\u00f3 el proceso electoral, alegando que su candidato hab\u00eda ganado la votaci\u00f3n, y recibi\u00f3 el apoyo de buena parte de la comunidad internacional. El Gobierno de Maduro, sin embargo, asegura que los comicios fueron leg\u00edtimos.\nTrump duplica el bot\u00edn: US$ 50 millones\nA pesar de que en los \u00faltimos meses los Gobiernos de Estados Unidos y Venezuela han mantenido un di\u00e1logo flu\u00eddo en torno al regreso de la operaci\u00f3n de Chevr\u00f3n y el reciente intercambio de prisioneros, la Casa Blanca duplic\u00f3 la recompensa anterior al ofrecer US$ 50 millones por informaci\u00f3n que conduzca al arresto de Maduro.\nEn un video publicado en X, la secretaria de Justicia, Pam Bondi, acus\u00f3 a Maduro de utilizar miembros de c\u00e1rteles para traer \u201cdrogas mortales y violencia a nuestro pa\u00eds\u201d.\n\u201c\u00c9l es uno de los narcotraficantes m\u00e1s grandes del mundo y una amenaza para nuestra seguridad nacional. Por lo tanto, hemos duplicado su recompensa a US$ 50 millones\u201d, continu\u00f3. \u201cBajo el liderazgo del presidente Trump, Maduro no escapar\u00e1 de la justicia y ser\u00e1 responsabilizado por sus cr\u00edmenes despreciables\u201d.\nLa respuesta del gobierno de Venezuela lleg\u00f3 r\u00e1pidamente. A la declaraci\u00f3n del canciller Gil, se sumaron varios funcionarios, entre ellos, el fiscal general de Venezuela, Tarek William Saab.\n\u201cEsta infamia constituye una violaci\u00f3n flagrante del derecho internacional, un atentado contra nuestra soberan\u00eda y una grosera intromisi\u00f3n en los asuntos internos de un Estado soberano\u201d, dijo.\nEl cartel detr\u00e1s de la acusaci\u00f3n\nFuncionarios del Gobierno de Maduro est\u00e1n se\u00f1alados como miembros del Cartel de los Soles, un grupo criminal que, seg\u00fan Washington, ha corrompido las altas esferas pol\u00edticas, militares y judiciales en Venezuela desde la d\u00e9cada de 1990 para enviar drogas a Estados Unidos.\nSeg\u00fan expertos consultados por CNN, este grupo criminal fue identificado en los noventa luego de que en causas judiciales se involucrara a dos generales de divisi\u00f3n venezolanos en el tr\u00e1fico de droga colombiana a trav\u00e9s de las FARC.\n\u201cA partir de ese caso, se comenz\u00f3 a identificar a una red de militares y de (agentes de la) Guardia Nacional que estaban involucrados, primero, en el tr\u00e1fico de coca\u00edna hacia el norte usando infraestructura militar venezolana o de la Guardia Nacional, y, despu\u00e9s, en el tr\u00e1fico de oro, de minerales diversos, a trav\u00e9s de minas informales que estaban siendo organizadas il\u00edcitamente por el ej\u00e9rcito venezolano\u201d, dijo en entrevista a CNN Edgardo Buscaglia, asesor internacional contra terrorismo y delincuencia organizada, director de Save Democracy y acad\u00e9mico principal de la Universidad de Columbia en EE.UU.\nBuscaglia a\u00f1adi\u00f3 que, cuando Hugo Ch\u00e1vez lleg\u00f3 al poder en Venezuela, el mandatario trat\u00f3 de negociar con los militares que formaban la red il\u00edcita, pero finalmente el grupo se expandi\u00f3 hasta funcionarios civiles del Estado y ya no solo militares.\n\u201cDe alguna manera Maduro hereda la estructura criminal que le deja Ch\u00e1vez y la expande de manera enorme a funcionarios civiles como el ministro del Interior (Diosdado) Cabello, como fue en su momento el jefe de inteligencia Hugo Carvajal, que eran parte de la organizaci\u00f3n criminal\u201d, asegur\u00f3 el experto en temas de seguridad.\nEl Cartel de los Soles se convirti\u00f3 eventualmente en un sistema de corrupci\u00f3n que se beneficia de las actividades del crimen organizado y que \u201ca menudo\u201d se asocia con c\u00e1rteles internacionales, se\u00f1al\u00f3 por correo electr\u00f3nico Imdat Oner, exdiplom\u00e1tico turco que estuvo basado en Venezuela y hoy es analista pol\u00edtico en la Universidad Internacional de Florida.\n\u201cLo que comenz\u00f3 como corrupci\u00f3n de oficiales individuales se ha convertido en un sistema donde personas poderosas protegen y se benefician de los env\u00edos de coca\u00edna que pasan por Venezuela, a menudo en asociaci\u00f3n con c\u00e1rteles internacionales\u201d, dijo Oner.\nEl gobierno de EE.UU. sostiene que el Cartel de los Soles \u201cproporciona apoyo material a organizaciones terroristas extranjeras que amenazan la paz y la seguridad de Estados Unidos, concretamente al (venezolano) Tren de Aragua y al (mexicano) Cartel de Sinaloa\u201d, lo cual es rechazado por el Gobierno de Venezuela, que considera que el Cartel de los Soles es una invenci\u00f3n de la Casa Blanca.\nAdem\u00e1s de Maduro, el general retirado Hugo Carvajal Barrios \u2014detenido en Madrid, Espa\u00f1a, en 2021 por pedido de EE.UU. y extraditado en 2023\u2014 es considerado uno de los principales l\u00edderes de este presunto cartel seg\u00fan el Departamento de Justcia. A finales de junio de este a\u00f1o, Carvajal Barrios se declar\u00f3 culpable en Estados Unidos de narcoterrorismo y narcotr\u00e1fico, delitos por los que podr\u00eda enfrentar cadena perpetua. La sentencia contra el general se dar\u00e1 a conocer el 29 de octubre, seg\u00fan el Departamento de Justicia de EE.UU.\nEl Gobierno estadounidense dice que Carvajal Barrios aprovech\u00f3 su posici\u00f3n como director de Inteligencia Militar de Venezuela \u2014cargo que ocup\u00f3 de 2004 a 2011 y despu\u00e9s entre 2013 y 2014\u2014 para facilitar la importaci\u00f3n de coca\u00edna a territorio estadounidense y participar en actividades a favor de la hoy extinta guerrilla de las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), que Washington considera una organizaci\u00f3n terrorista.\nEl d\u00eda que Carvajal Barrios se declar\u00f3 culpable, el Departamento de Justicia dijo en un comunicado que el Cartel de los Soles da\u00f1\u00f3 tanto a estadounidenses como a venezolanos.\n\u201cCarvajal Barrios y otros miembros del Cartel de los Soles abusaron del pueblo venezolano y corrompieron las instituciones leg\u00edtimas de Venezuela, incluyendo partes del Ej\u00e9rcito, el aparato de inteligencia y las ramas Legislativa y Judicial, para facilitar la importaci\u00f3n de toneladas de coca\u00edna a Estados Unidos\u201d, indica el comunicado.\n\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 se llama as\u00ed y c\u00f3mo funciona?\nSeg\u00fan Insight Crime, un grupo de expertos dedicado a temas de crimen organizado, basado en EE.UU. y Colombia, el nombre de Cartel de los Soles proviene de la vestimenta de los militares se\u00f1alados de actividades il\u00edcitas.\nEl nombre \u201cCartel de los Soles\u201d comenz\u00f3 a utilizarse en 1993 luego de que se se conocieron denuncias de participaci\u00f3n en narcotr\u00e1fico contra generales de la Guardia Nacional y luego comandantes de divisi\u00f3n, que llevaban en el uniforme soles dobles por su rango, explica el grupo.\nEl Cartel de los Soles, dice Insight Crime, no es una organizaci\u00f3n tradicional de crimen organizado donde hay un l\u00edder y abajo est\u00e1n los subordinados, sino de una red compuesta por muchas c\u00e9lulas dentro de las ramas castrenses venezolanas y del gobierno.\nDebido a que el Cartel de los Soles se compondr\u00eda de c\u00e9lulas dispersas, la idea de que Maduro lidera a este supuesto grupo criminal es una \u201csimplificaci\u00f3n excesiva\u201d por parte de Estados Unidos, menciona Insight Crime.\n\u201cM\u00e1s que una organizaci\u00f3n jer\u00e1rquica con Maduro al mando de las operaciones de tr\u00e1fico de drogas, el Cartel de los Soles se asemeja m\u00e1s a una red de corrupci\u00f3n en el que funcionarios militares y pol\u00edticos se benefician de los acuerdos establecidos con narcotraficantes\u201d, detalla el grupo de expertos.\nHasta el momento, se desconoce si hay interacci\u00f3n o relaci\u00f3n entre estas c\u00e9lulas, agrega.\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 dice Venezuela sobre el cartel?\nEl gobierno de Maduro, sin embargo, insiste que en Venezuela no operan grupos del crimen organizado. La semana pasada, luego de que la administraci\u00f3n Trump aumentara la recompensa sobre Maduro, Vladimiro Padrino L\u00f3pez, ministro del Poder Popular para la Defensa de Venezuela, tambi\u00e9n rechaz\u00f3 el v\u00ednculo del presidente con c\u00e1rteles de la droga.\n\u201cLa Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana rechaza categ\u00f3ricamente las bufonescas declaraciones de la fiscal general del Gobierno norteamericano, efectuadas ayer 7 de agosto, en las cuales anuncia el incremento de la recompensa ofrecida por los departamentos de Justicia y de Estado a quien brinde informaci\u00f3n que conduzca al arresto del ciudadano Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Moros\u201d, dijo Padrino en un evento desde Caracas.\n\u201cEsos mismos inmorales est\u00e1n tratando aqu\u00ed de decir que nuestro comandante en jefe es un narcotraficante, que el ministro de la Defensa es un narcotraficante. Es una falta de respeto a Venezuela\u201d, agreg\u00f3.\nPadrino asegur\u00f3 que en Venezuela \u201cno operan ni bandas criminales\u2026 ni tampoco existen c\u00e1rteles ni capos\u201d y dijo que Maduro es un \u201ch\u00e9roe\u201d.\n\u201cSe desarticularon absolutamente (estos grupos)\u2026 Podemos decir que nuestro comandante en jefe (Maduro) ha sido un h\u00e9roe en esta tarea\u201d, se\u00f1al\u00f3 el ministro Padrino.\nUn choque de narrativas\nSeg\u00fan Oner, el experto de la Universidad Internacional de Florida, Estados Unidos considera que Maduro dirige toda una estructura il\u00edcita, mientras que Venezuela sostiene una narrativa contraria.\n\u201cEn su visi\u00f3n, \u00e9l (Maduro) es el capo, utilizando la coca\u00edna no solo para ganar dinero, sino como un arma estrat\u00e9gica contra Estados Unidos\u201d, dijo Oner.\n\u201cEn Caracas, la reacci\u00f3n es la contraria. Lo ven no solo como un error, sino como una profunda ofensa, un ataque a la soberan\u00eda de Venezuela y una forma de socavar la legitimidad de Maduro\u201d, agreg\u00f3.\nPor ende, Oner consider\u00f3 que el asunto se trata de narrativas contrarias que se enfrentan nuevamente y que usan el tema de las drogas como \u201cherramienta pol\u00edtica\u201d.\n\u201cDos relatos muy distintos contados para dos p\u00fablicos muy diferentes. Ambas partes est\u00e1n menos interesadas en convencerse mutuamente y m\u00e1s enfocadas en usar la etiqueta de narcotr\u00e1fico como una herramienta pol\u00edtica en su lucha continua\u201d, a\u00f1adi\u00f3 el experto.\nPara Oner, el aumento de la recompensa por Maduro llega en un momento en que la relaci\u00f3n EE.UU.-Venezuela parec\u00eda entrar en un punto de calma \u2014por el mencionado regreso de la operaci\u00f3n de Chevron en Venezuela y por el reciente intercambio de prisioneros entre ambos pa\u00edses\u2014. Pero en realidad se transform\u00f3 en \u201cuna renovada fase de m\u00e1xima presi\u00f3n\u201d acompa\u00f1ada del supuesto decreto de Trump para atacar a c\u00e1rteles extranjeros.\n\u201cEn su primer mandato, Trump dependi\u00f3 en gran medida de las sanciones para intentar sacar a Maduro; esta vez, la estrategia se centra en retratarlo como el l\u00edder del cartel e incluso como un posible objetivo de acci\u00f3n militar\u201d, coment\u00f3 Oner.\nEn cuanto a las consecuencias, el experto dijo que es poco probable que en Venezuela haya un efecto inmediato, ya que Maduro tiene \u201cfirmemente de su lado\u201d a las fuerzas de seguridad.\n\u201cSin embargo, fuera del pa\u00eds, la medida (estadounidense) solo aumenta su aislamiento. Viajar m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de su peque\u00f1o c\u00edrculo de pa\u00edses amigos se est\u00e1 volviendo m\u00e1s riesgoso, y los casos legales en su contra siguen acumul\u00e1ndose. Incluso podr\u00eda poner algo de tensi\u00f3n en sus lazos con Asia, Medio Oriente y \u00c1frica. Con el tiempo, si m\u00e1s exaliados comienzan a hablar con fiscales estadounidenses, esas grietas podr\u00edan extenderse a su c\u00edrculo interno. Por ahora, es simplemente el m\u00e1s reciente episodio en un enfrentamiento diplom\u00e1tico entre Caracas y Washington que lleva a\u00f1os desarroll\u00e1ndose\u201d, finaliz\u00f3 el exdiplom\u00e1tico de Turqu\u00eda.\nCon informaci\u00f3n de Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, Ver\u00f3nica Calder\u00f3n y Roc\u00edo Mu\u00f1oz-Ledo, de CNN."

      "text": "(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) \u2013 Estados Unidos dijo estar preocupado por la detenci\u00f3n de cinco activistas opositores en Venezuela en las \u00faltimas 72 horas, una denuncia formulada por el candidato de la Plataforma Unitaria Democr\u00e1tica Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, de acuerdo con una publicaci\u00f3n en X de Brian Nichols, subsecretario de estado de EE.UU. para asuntos del hemisferio occidental.\n\u201cLas \u00faltimas detenciones y el continuo acoso a miembros de la oposici\u00f3n democr\u00e1tica de Venezuela son hechos muy preocupantes en v\u00edsperas de las elecciones presidenciales del 28 de julio\u201d dijo Nichols, quien tambi\u00e9n afirm\u00f3 que los candidatos y activistas deben poder hacer campa\u00f1a pac\u00edficamente y sin intimidaciones.\nNo tard\u00f3 la respuesta del canciller venezolano, Yvan Gil, quien dijo en sus redes sociales que el alto funcionario estadounidense \u201cofende a los venezolanos inmiscuy\u00e9ndose en asuntos que no le corresponden\u201d.\n\u201cParece que la derrota que tienen pintada en la frente sus t\u00edteres le causa m\u00e1s angustia que nunca\u201d, dijo Gil, quien considera que \u201clos intentos de interferir en el proceso electoral\u201d ser\u00e1n \u201cun rotundo fracaso\u201d, como, a su juicio, son tambi\u00e9n las pol\u00edticas del gobierno de Estados Unidos.\nEl aspirante de la alianza de partidos opositores Mesa de la Unidad Democr\u00e1tica (MUD), Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia asegur\u00f3 el martes que tres j\u00f3venes fueron detenidos y llevados a la prisi\u00f3n del Helicoide acusados de incitaci\u00f3n al odio y asociaci\u00f3n para delinquir.\nEn las \u00faltimas horas fueron detenidos Gabriel Gonz\u00e1lez y Javier Cisneros, cuando salieron a buscar almuerzo, seg\u00fan la versi\u00f3n del comando de campa\u00f1a. En horas de la tarde, Cisneros fue liberado. Las otras tres detenciones tuvieron lugar durante el fin de semana, agregaron.\nCNN se comunic\u00f3 con la Fiscal\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica para conocer su versi\u00f3n sobre estas detenciones sin hasta ahora haber obtenido respuesta.\nEl comando opositor asegura que se les asign\u00f3 defensa p\u00fablica, pese a que quer\u00edan designar a defensa privada.\nGonz\u00e1lez Urrutia considera que estas acciones registradas a poco m\u00e1s de un mes de las elecciones presidenciales, previstas para el 28 de julio, constituyen la consumaci\u00f3n de un nuevo episodio de violaci\u00f3n del acuerdo de Barbados y que afectan el normal desarrollo de la campa\u00f1a, que a\u00fan no comienza formalmente.\nEl acuerdo de Barbados fue suscrito en octubre por el Gobierno y la oposici\u00f3n para definir garant\u00edas y condiciones pol\u00edtico-electorales.\nJunto a Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, se pronunci\u00f3 la dirigente del movimiento pol\u00edtico Vente Venezuela, Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, quien advirti\u00f3 que \u201cse est\u00e1 criminalizando la ruta electoral, la actividad electoral y la campa\u00f1a\u201d. Machado afirm\u00f3 que 37 activistas pol\u00edticos y sociales han sido detenidos en lo que va de a\u00f1o, de los cuales 20 se corresponden con el comando de campa\u00f1a opositor. Detall\u00f3 que hay 14 detenidos (cinco de ellos detenidos en las \u00faltimas 72 horas) y seis bajo la protecci\u00f3n de la embajada de Argentina.\nLas elecciones presidenciales venezolanas est\u00e1n previstas para el 28 de julio y en ellas participan 10 candidatos, entre ellos el propio presidente Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, que aspira a su segunda reelecci\u00f3n y su tercer per\u00edodo de gobierno. Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, el candidato m\u00e1s fuerte de la oposici\u00f3n, cuenta con el respaldo de Machado, tras haber sido inhabilitada por la Contralor\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica con una sanci\u00f3n que la dirigente pol\u00edtica considera ilegal e inconstitucional."

Se espera que Carvajal, exdirector de la Inteligencia Militar venezolana, reciba sentencia el 29 de octubre.\nEl d\u00eda que se declar\u00f3 culpable, el Departamento de Justicia de EE.UU. dijo en un comunicado que el Cartel de los Soles ha perjudicado tanto a estadounidenses como a venezolanos.\n\u201cCarvajal Barrios y otros miembros del Cartel de los Soles abusaron del pueblo venezolano y corrompieron las instituciones leg\u00edtimas de Venezuela, incluyendo partes del Ej\u00e9rcito, el aparato de inteligencia y las ramas Legislativa y Judicial, para facilitar la importaci\u00f3n de toneladas de coca\u00edna a Estados Unidos\u201d, indica el comunicado.\n\u201cEl Cartel de los Soles no solo buscaba enriquecer a sus miembros y aumentar su poder, sino tambi\u00e9n \u2018inundar\u2019 de coca\u00edna a EE.UU. y causar los peligrosos y adictivos efectos de esta droga en los usuarios estadounidenses\u201d, a\u00f1ade.\nEn 2015, CNN obtuvo acceso a documentos de inteligencia de EE.UU. que identificaban a Carvajal como el jefe de una red transnacional de tr\u00e1fico de drogas.\nLa designaci\u00f3n del Cartel de los Soles se suma a otras realizadas por la administraci\u00f3n del presidente Donald Trump contra varias organizaciones criminales latinoamericanas, como el venezolano Tren de Aragua y los carteles mexicanos de Sinaloa y Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n, entre otros.\nAl realizar estas designaciones, EE.UU. tambi\u00e9n abre la puerta para que sus fuerzas de seguridad lleven a cabo acciones directas contra los grupos mencionados, incluso en otros pa\u00edses."

      "text": "(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) \u2013 No es la primera vez que Venezuela parece estar ante un abanico de pocas opciones luego de unos comicios. Seg\u00fan analistas consultados por CNN, esos escenarios, adem\u00e1s, son nocivos en materia democr\u00e1tica. Tan solo las dos \u00faltimas elecciones presidenciales despu\u00e9s de la muerte del presidente Hugo Ch\u00e1vez (las elecciones de 2013 y los de 2018) terminaron en laberintos similares al actual: con un triunfo oficialista, con un sistema electoral cuestionado, movilizaciones populares que incluyeron violencia y efectos migratorios que da\u00f1aron la convivencia regional.\nSin embargo, parece haber un consenso entre los expertos en relaci\u00f3n con una diferencia crucial: ahora el triunfo de la oposici\u00f3n parece m\u00e1s evidente que nunca (incluso en antiguos bastiones chavistas) y tambi\u00e9n lo es la posibilidad de que haya habido fraude, ante la falta de publicaci\u00f3n de las actas de escrutinio desagregadas.\nPara Benigno Alarc\u00f3n, director del Centro de Estudios Pol\u00edticos y de Gobierno de la Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Andr\u00e9s Bello de Venezuela, las circunstancias actuales son diferentes porque el triunfo de la oposici\u00f3n es indudable, dentro y fuera del pa\u00eds.\n\u201cNunca en el pasado hab\u00eda sido as\u00ed de claro. En el 2013 hubo una elecci\u00f3n cuestionada, pero sin una confirmaci\u00f3n del \u00e9xito de la oposici\u00f3n; en el 2018 hubo una elecci\u00f3n fraudulenta sin dudas, pero la oposici\u00f3n ni siquiera hab\u00eda participado. Y tras eso, cuando Juan Guaid\u00f3 se autoproclam\u00f3 presidente encargado, el hecho de que no fuera un candidato electo le pon\u00eda, como solemos decir, un plomo en el ala\u201d, dijo a CNN.\nAdem\u00e1s, en esta elecci\u00f3n, la oposici\u00f3n lleg\u00f3 unida incluso despu\u00e9s de la inhabilitaci\u00f3n de su l\u00edder principal, Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, y el apoyo a Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez fue mayoritario. Y esa unidad se ha mantenido incluso despu\u00e9s de que el Consejo Nacional Electoral difundi\u00f3 los resultados que proclaman a Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Con todo, el panorama sigue abierto y no hay consenso en torno a c\u00f3mo se desarrollar\u00e1 de aqu\u00ed en m\u00e1s.\n\u00bfCu\u00e1les son los escenarios posibles?\nLos analistas consultados por CNN para este art\u00edculo no son optimistas con respecto a las opciones que est\u00e1n sobre la mesa, y las experiencias del pasado demuestran que la situaci\u00f3n de un impasse pol\u00edtico como el actual ha favorecido a Maduro.\nEntre las novedades, muchos analistas observan el resurgimiento de la sociedad civil como actor en el mapa pol\u00edtico. \u201cLa sociedad civil, que en el pasado hab\u00eda estado un poco dormida, ha vuelto a aparecer en escena a trav\u00e9s de las movilizaciones populares\u201d, dijo a CNN Juan Negri, director de la carrera de Ciencia Pol\u00edtica y Estudios Internacionales de la Universidad Torcuato Di Tella en Buenos Aires.\nUna improbable nueva elecci\u00f3n\nPasadas casi dos semanas de las elecciones, convocar a nuevos comicios es la menos probable de las opciones en Venezuela, opinan los expertos consultados.\n\u201cNo creo que sea el escenario m\u00e1s probable porque depende de varios factores, pero consistir\u00eda en que, ante las presiones internas y externas \u2014y por internas me refiero tambi\u00e9n a los blandos dentro del chavismo\u2014 Maduro acepte la celebraci\u00f3n de nuevas elecciones con alg\u00fan argumento elegante de problemas t\u00e9cnicos o burocr\u00e1ticos\u201d, consider\u00f3 Negri.\nJuan Pablo Laporte, profesor de la Universidad de Buenos Aires y de la Universidad Austral, tambi\u00e9n es esc\u00e9ptico ante un escenario de acuerdos. \u201cSe lleg\u00f3 a las elecciones presidenciales luego del \u2018Acuerdo de Barbados\u2019, en el que gobierno y oposici\u00f3n coordinaron una serie de garant\u00edas para la realizaci\u00f3n de elecciones limpias y transparentes, con observadores internacionales. Habi\u00e9ndose roto, parece dif\u00edcil pensar que una salida negociada podr\u00eda tener \u00e9xito, dado el fracaso del intento m\u00e1s ambicioso hasta el momento en este aspecto\u201d.\nEl endurecimiento del discurso de Maduro en los \u00faltimos d\u00edas, adem\u00e1s, lo hace ver improbable, a\u00f1adi\u00f3 Negri.\nPosible fisura de las Fuerzas Armadas y el \u201cfactor Brasil\u201d\nSeg\u00fan Negri, en Venezuela podr\u00eda darse un escenario comparable con lo ocurrido en Europa Oriental entre finales de los a\u00f1os 80 y principios de los 90. \u201cLas movilizaciones masivas podr\u00edan provocar un sisma que provoque fisuras en las Fuerzas Armadas, hasta que en alg\u00fan momento los generales le digan a Maduro que ya no pueden garantizar su seguridad, con lo que \u00e9l decida abandonar el pa\u00eds\u201d, explic\u00f3 a CNN.\nEn ese escenario, agreg\u00f3, el \u201cfactor Brasil\u201d ser\u00eda crucial.\n\u201cBrasil podr\u00eda oficiar como un negociador que le garantice la seguridad de sus activos y de su familia. La comunidad internacional ser\u00eda la encargada de hacerle un puente de oro a Maduro y de garantizarle el exilio. En ese escenario se abre otra puerta de qu\u00e9 pasa adentro de Venezuela. En el mejor de los casos, una transici\u00f3n hacia un r\u00e9gimen democr\u00e1tico\u201d, indic\u00f3.\nPara Negri, la presi\u00f3n internacional puede operar en Venezuela, \u201cpero no en el vac\u00edo, porque la posici\u00f3n del Gobierno despu\u00e9s de 2019 es incluso m\u00e1s firme, y conforme pasa el tiempo se sigue fortaleciendo\u201d. Jennifer Cyr, profesora Investigadora de Ciencia Pol\u00edtica y directora del posgrado en Ciencia Pol\u00edtica en la Universidad Torcuato Di Tella, opina que la salida negociada y mediada por Brasil es la \u00fanica salida pac\u00edfica a la crisis.\n\u201cDeber\u00eda ser una negociaci\u00f3n entre el r\u00e9gimen y la oposici\u00f3n que incluya a las Fuerzas Armadas\u201d, indic\u00f3.\nCyr tambi\u00e9n a\u00f1adi\u00f3 que para que ese escenario resulte, el Gobierno de Maduro debe obtener concesiones: \u201cHemos aprendido de transiciones como la chilena entre el 88 y el 89 que hay que dar garant\u00edas como una forma de resolver el impasse y recuperar la democracia\u201d.\nHay dos factores, sin embargo, que parecen indicar que ese no es el rumbo actual de la situaci\u00f3n. El primero de ellos es que el Gobierno de Maduro no da muestras de estar revaluando la situaci\u00f3n. \u201cNo hay ninguna evidencia de que est\u00e9 abierta la puerta de la negociaci\u00f3n; por el contrario, el Gobierno est\u00e1 jugando muy duro y ha tomado el camino represivo\u201d, dijo Negri. El segundo factor tiene que ver con las Fuerzas Armadas, que no han mostrado se\u00f1ales de fisuras y que en varias oportunidades desde el comienzo de la actual crisis han ratificado su apoyo a Maduro.\nGonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, \u00bf\u201dpresidente encargado\u201d?\nSimilar a lo que ocurri\u00f3 en 2019, cuando Guaid\u00f3 se autoproclam\u00f3 presidente encargado de Venezuela y lleg\u00f3 a ser reconocido por m\u00e1s de 50 pa\u00edses, algunos se preguntan si ese podr\u00eda ser un camino para ejercer presi\u00f3n al gobierno a trav\u00e9s de Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia.\n\u201cCreo que lo que sucedi\u00f3 entonces fue que la oposici\u00f3n cometi\u00f3 muchos errores, entre ellos que se prolong\u00f3 m\u00e1s de la cuenta (\u2026) Pero ese escenario cambi\u00f3: ahora estamos ante una oposici\u00f3n mucho m\u00e1s unificada debajo de Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, que logr\u00f3 ese lugar a trav\u00e9s de unas primarias internas. En 2019 la oposici\u00f3n a\u00fan estaba muy dividida entre la estrategia callejera o la v\u00eda institucionalista, y no creo que Maduro haya visto a Guaid\u00f3 como una amenaza como la que representa Mar\u00eda Corina Machado\u201d, dijo Cyr.\nAunque coincidi\u00f3 en que el contexto ha cambiado, Negri opin\u00f3 que Maduro tiene todo para ganar. \u201cCon repetir su actitud en el 2019, el Gobierno ya tiene una ventaja. Me refiero a dejar que pase el tiempo, no darle entidad y aguantar. Algunos pa\u00edses podr\u00edan llegar a jugar la carta dura, por ejemplo EE.UU. podr\u00eda aplicar alguna sanci\u00f3n m\u00e1s, pero no creo que sea una estrategia que vaya a tener \u00e9xito\u201d, consider\u00f3.\n\u201cEl escenario de un Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia como presidente encargado me parece dif\u00edcil, dado que el consenso internacional tampoco es un\u00e1nime al respecto. Ser\u00eda dif\u00edcil para \u00e9l hacer uso de su poder presidencial \u2014incluso hacia dentro de su coalici\u00f3n, siendo la verdadera primera figura de la oposici\u00f3n Maria Corina Machado\u2014 dado el control de los principales resortes del Estado por parte del gobierno bolivariano\u201d, se\u00f1al\u00f3 en el mismo sentido Laporte.\nLa econom\u00eda y el contexto internacional da una ventaja a Maduro\nMaduro lleg\u00f3 a los comicios del 28 de julio con algunas cuestiones de peso a su favor. Entre ellas, algunos acuerdos econ\u00f3micos con Estados Unidos para abrir la ruta electoral \u2015aunque no exentos de turbulencias \u2015, adem\u00e1s de su firme alianza con pa\u00edses como Rusia, China e Ir\u00e1n. Eso colabor\u00f3 con una mejora de los valores de la econom\u00eda venezolana, al menos respecto del 2019, seg\u00fan Laporte.\n\u201cA trav\u00e9s de una dolarizaci\u00f3n de facto, la a\u00fan muy precaria econom\u00eda venezolana se ha estabilizado en relaci\u00f3n a los \u00edndices presentes en crisis anteriores, lo cual podr\u00eda suponer una facilidad para que Maduro mantenga el poder\u201d, indic\u00f3.\nPero hay un factor m\u00e1s en el que se detiene Cyr. \u201cNo hay que olvidar que el contexto internacional es un contexto de retroceso democr\u00e1tico (\u2026) Los discursos democr\u00e1ticos no son precisamente los que est\u00e1n en auge, y hay menos confianza en la ciudadan\u00eda en lo que los reg\u00edmenes democr\u00e1ticos pueden ofrecer\u201d, afirm\u00f3.\nPara ella, esto representa una ventaja para un r\u00e9gimen que no puede \u2014y posiblemente ya no le interese\u2014 defenderse a s\u00ed mismo como una democracia. \u201cEn un contexto en el que la democracia no es un valor tan fuerte, Maduro puede apostar a seguir mejorando la econom\u00eda \u2014que no es tan dif\u00edcil porque hace 10 a\u00f1os estaba destruida\u2014, a lograr cierta idea de seguridad \u2014aunque sea mediante represi\u00f3n\u2014 y a apostar mantenerse en el poder\u201d, abund\u00f3.\nTambi\u00e9n la fragmentaci\u00f3n internacional puede operar c\u00f3mo un punto de apoyo para Maduro, dijo Laporte. \u201cPuede encontrar m\u00e1s medios para mantenerse en el poder, ya sean econ\u00f3micos, diplom\u00e1ticos, o incluso coercitivos. La dificultad por parte de las instituciones internacionales en el enforcement de las medidas condenatorias hacia Maduro y su r\u00e9gimen dificultar\u00e1n el campo de acci\u00f3n de los pa\u00edses que apoyan a la oposici\u00f3n venezolana\u201d.\nPor eso, y a pesar del emergente protagonismo de la sociedad civil, tanto los antecedentes hist\u00f3ricos como el contexto parecen favorecer, al menos circunstancialmente, al Gobierno de Maduro."

      "text": "The US military is deploying more than 4,000 Marines and sailors to the waters around Latin America and the Caribbean as part of a ramped-up effort to combat drug cartels, two US defense officials told CNN \u2014 a dramatic show of force that will give the president a broad range of military options should he want to target drug cartels.\nThe deployment of the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) and the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit to US Southern Command, which has not been previously reported, is part of a broader repositioning of military assets to the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility that has been underway over the last three weeks, one of the officials said.\nA nuclear-powered attack submarine, additional P8 Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft, several destroyers and a guided-missile cruiser are also being allocated to US Southern Command as part of the mission, the officials said.\nA third person familiar with the matter said the additional assets are \u201caimed at addressing threats to US national security from specially designated narco-terrorist organizations in the region.\u201d\nOn Friday, the US Navy announced the deployment of the USS Iwo Jima, the 22nd MEU, and the two other ships in the Amphibious Ready Group \u2014 the USS Fort Lauderdale and the USS San Antonio \u2014 but did not say where they were going.\nOne of the officials emphasized that the military buildup is for now mostly a show of force, aimed more at sending a message than indicative of any intention to conduct precision targeting of cartels. But it also gives US military commanders \u2014 and the president \u2014 a broad range of options should Trump order military action. The ARG/MEU, for example, also features an aviation combat element.\nThe deployment of the Marine Expeditionary Unit, however, has raised concerns among some defense officials who worry that the Marines are not trained to conduct drug interdictions and counter drug-trafficking. If that is part of their mission set, they will have to lean heavily on the Coast Guard, officials said.\nMEUs have been instrumental in the past in supporting large-scale evacuation operations; a MEU was stationed for months in the eastern Mediterranean, for example, amid tensions between Israel, Hamas and Iran.\nA Marine official told CNN that the MEU \u201cstands ready to execute lawful orders and support the combatant commanders in the needs that are requested of them.\u201d\nThe US military deployed destroyers to the areas around the US-Mexico border in March to support US Northern Command\u2019s border security mission and reinforce the US\u2019 presence in the western hemisphere. The additional assets being moved now, however, will fall under US Southern Command, and are set to support SOUTHCOM for at least the next several months, one of the officials said.\nCNN previously reported that a memo signed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth earlier this year stated that the US military\u2019s \u201cforemost priority\u201d is to defend the homeland, and instructed the Pentagon to \u201cseal our borders, repel forms of invasion including unlawful mass migration, narcotics trafficking, human smuggling and trafficking, and other criminal activities, and deport illegal aliens in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security.\u201d\nThe same memo also formally asked Pentagon officials for \u201ccredible military options\u201d to ensure unfettered American access to the Panama Canal, CNN reported at the time.\nCNN\u2019s Zachary Cohen contributed to this report."

Maduro dismissed U.S. claims, declared Venezuela\u2019s sovereignty intact, and announced a massive militia mobilization. Meanwhile, the U.S. officially recognized opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as president-elect, a move that Venezuela rejects, and China continues to defend its economic and diplomatic ties with Caracas amid escalating tensions.",
