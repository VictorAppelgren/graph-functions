      "feedback": "Your draft is a good first pass but still feels like a collection of facts rather than a coherent, scenario‑driven thesis. To reach world‑class quality, re‑structure it into a clear causal chain that links macro drivers (Fed/BOJ policy, wage dynamics, defense spending) to sector outcomes (small‑cap valuation, UAS job growth, Inghams margins) and then to portfolio positioning. Start with a concise macro backdrop: cite the Fed’s 2025‑08‑23 minutes (ID A7VLN74BK) and BOJ’s wage‑tightness remarks (same ID) and quantify the expected discount‑rate shift (e.g., 25‑bp hike → 0.5‑point P/E lift for small caps). Next, embed first‑principles logic: explain how a 25‑bp hike reduces the discount rate by ~0.3‑point, raising small‑cap P/E by 5‑8 % (use Q7VVGNSQE for valuation gaps). For the UAS sector, add concrete revenue/contract numbers (e.g., 2024 UAS revenue $X bn, 2025 contract pipeline $Y bn) and link them to job growth (FOM34PUWA) and potential defense‑budget cuts. For Inghams, include 2024 revenue $Z bn, gross margin % and feed‑conversion ratio improvement, and note the 60 % customer concentration (GUJQZY4UO). Create a catalyst map: • Fed rate hike (trigger) → small‑cap rally; • BOJ wage‑tightness (trigger) → Japanese small‑cap earnings; • Defense budget cut (invalidation) → UAS slowdown; • Poultry price spike (invalidation) → Inghams margin squeeze. Assign timing windows (e.g., Fed hike in Q3 2025, BOJ policy shift in Q4 2025). Then lay out a base case (Fed hike, small‑cap +5‑8 %, dividend core) and an alternative (prolonged low‑rate, small‑cap flat/decline). Add watch signals with source IDs: Fed minutes (A7VLN74BK), BOJ remarks (A7VLN74BK), UAS contract announcements (FOM34PUWA), Inghams earnings (GUJQZY4UO), commodity indices. Finally, reconcile any conflicting signals (e.g., high dividend yields vs low small‑cap valuations) by quantifying the carry trade effect. Use bullet‑point tables for scenarios, and ensure every claim is backed by an ID (e.g., Q7VVGNSQE for valuation gap, WISLWAJ15 for dividend yields). This will transform the draft into a tightly reasoned, data‑driven, 3‑6‑month scenario analysis that meets the SECTION FOCUS and format constraints.",
