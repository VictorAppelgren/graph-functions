  "title": "Trump\u2019s Crime Emergency Troops Reveal How Much Trash They\u2019ve Collected",
  "description": "The president said he was sending the National Guard because crime in the capital was on par with third-world countries.",
  "content": "National Guard troops sent to Washington, D.C. to battle Donald Trump\u2019s vision of a violent, lawless city on a par with Third World nations, have revealed how many bags of trash they\u2019ve collected.\n\nTrump claimed D.C. suffered \u201cone of the Highest Rates of Crime in the World, more than many of the most violent Third World Countries.\u201d\n\nBut rather than battling cartels or terrorists, the soldiers have been busy picking up trash and spreading mulch, jobs that would typically fall to National Park Service employees.\n\nThe Trump administration has fired thousands of federal workers this year, including almost 25 percent of the NPS, leaving the National Guard to assist with more than 40 \u201cbeautification projects\u201d around the city.\n\n\u201cGuardsmen have cleaned more than 3.2 miles of roadways, collected more than 500 bags of trash, and disposed of three truckloads of plant waste,\u201d the National Guard said over the weekend in a statement shared by CBS.\n\nSome troops have questioned how the deployment\u2014which is costing an estimated $1 million per day\u2014affects their military readiness.\n\nThe presence of soldiers on American streets has also proven to be deeply unpopular with voters, with just 41 percent of respondents saying they approved of the move, a Quinnipiac University poll found last week.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House and the National Guard for comment.\n\nTrump insists he has made D.C a much safer place as he sets his sights on other Democrat-led cities such as Chicago, Baltimore, and New York.\n\nAs of Friday, 1,369 arrests had been made during the three-week crackdown, according to the White House. But D.C.\u2019s top prosecutor, former Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, has not been following through with progress in court. In a couple of high-profile cases, she failed to secure grand jury indictments.\n\nMany of the guardsmen have been sent from Republican-led states\u2014including Mississippi, Tennessee, and Louisiana\u2014that have cities with higher crime rates than Washington, D.C..\n\nJackson, Mississippi\u2019s homicide rate is a whopping four times higher than D.C.\u2019s, while the murder rate in Memphis is three times higher, and in New Orleans it is double, NPR reported.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson struggled to respond when Gov. Gavin Newsom called out a similar disparity between California\u2014where Trump sent National Guard troops earlier this summer\u2014and Johnson\u2019s home state of Louisiana, whose murder rate is four times that of the Golden State.\n\n\u201cGavin Newsom will do anything for attention. He can name-drop me all, all,\u201d Johnson stammered, \u201cthat he wants. He needs to go and govern his state and not be engaging in all of this.\u201d\n\nAs for the president\u2019s claim that crime in the nation\u2019s capital resembles a third-world country, it\u2019s not clear where he got his Fallujah statistic, since no official figure appears to exist for the city that was the site of some of the deadliest battles of the Iraq War.\n\nIn the case of Bogota, it\u2019s true that Washington\u2019s homicide rate was higher last year. But that\u2019s not because Washington has cartel levels of violence\u2014it\u2019s because the Colombian city has managed to bring homicide rates way down since the 1990s.\n\nIn 1993, Bogota\u2019s homicide rate was 81.2 per 100,000 inhabitants, but by 2007, it had fallen to 19 per 100,000 inhabitants, and last year it was 15 per 100,000, CNN reported.",

      "text": "MSNBC anchor Jen Psaki is questioning the Trump administration\u2019s use of National Guard troops after yet another school shooting Wednesday.\nThe former Biden administration press secretary took to social media after learning about a fatal shooting at the Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, in which an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old were killed during mass. At least 14 other children were wounded, as were 3 adults in their 80s.\n\u201cWhen kids are getting shot in their pews at a catholic school mass and your crime plan is to have national guard put mulch down around DC maybe rethink your strategy,\u201d Psaki, a mother of two, posted on X.\nSome National Guard troops, which Trump deployed to the capital earlier this month under the guise of reducing crime, have since been seen picking up trash and spreading mulch at several locations around the city as part of \u201cbeautification projects.\u201d That job is normally reserved for the Park Service, but the Trump administration\u2019s cuts to the federal workforce have stretched its resources ever thinner.\n\u201cIt\u2019s everybody\u2014the masons, the maintenance workers, the groundskeepers, the plumbers. Every shop is short,\u201d one Park Service official told The Washington Post. What was once a D.C. workforce of 200 is now 20.\nSome of the more than 2,200 National Guard troops deployed to the capital have also questioned taking over Park Service duties and how that affects their military readiness.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question...[that] I and a lot of other higher enlisted are asking,\u201d Master Sgt. David Bowden told the Post.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Beast asking how long National Guard troops will be helping out with landscaping duties in the capital, or what\u2014if any\u2014action the administration will be taking on guns.\nIn a proclamation earlier Wednesday, Trump ordered flags to be flown at half-staff through the end of the month."

      "text": "The National Guard troops helping with duties in D.C., including traffic control, are now armed.\nNBC News reports that beginning Sunday night, approximately 2,000 guard troops deployed to Washington, D.C., will now be armed\u2014most with standard-issue M17 pistols, though a handful will carry M4 assault rifles. The move comes two days after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a new order to arm D.C. crackdown troops, which the former Fox News host called \u201ccommon sense.\u201d\nNBC News reports that the troops are authorized to use their weapons to protect themselves and \u201cas a last resort\u201d in the event of \u201cimminent threat of death or serious bodily harm,\u201d though they are not currently making arrests. Their role is to work with local police on duties including protecting national landmarks and assisting with traffic and crowd control.\nOn Saturday, AP stated that National Guard troops had been spotted feeding squirrels, drinking coffee and posing for photos with citizens. The U.S. Army has stated they will receive training and \u201ccomplete annual weapons qualifications\u201d before being armed.\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to both the White House and the Department of Defense for comment.\nMore than 2,200 National Guard soldiers and airmen have now been deployed to Washington after President Donald Trump declared a crackdown on crime in the nation\u2019s capital, which he claimed was fueled by illegal immigration and homelessness. Trump also wanted to improve roads and parks, and even tackle a vermin problem.\n\u201cIt was a crime-infested rathole,\u201d Trump said of D.C. on Friday. \u201cAnd they do have a lot of rats. We\u2019re getting rid of them, too. And we\u2019ve made a lot of progress.\u201d\nTeenager Edward \u201cBig Balls\u201d Coristine became the bloodied poster boy of Trump\u2019s \u201cSafe and Beautiful Task Force\u201d after allegedly being assaulted on the streets of Washington. Trump shared a gruesome photo of the former DOGE goon at the crime scene, claiming he had nearly lost his life.\nHowever, a report by The New York Times suggests Trump\u2019s crackdown on crime has seen even minor infringements fast-tracked to federal court, versus a local court, which could inflate the crime rate in D.C.\nMark Bigelow, 28, was in his car in northeast D.C. on Aug. 19 when officers from the FBI, the Metropolitan Police Department, ICE, the DEA and the State Department\u2019s Diplomatic Security Service noticed what they believed to be an open container of alcohol in the front seat.\nWhen officers questioned the two other passengers in the vehicle, the charging document states that \u201ca second cup containing an alcoholic beverage in the middle row seat\u201d was spotted.\nBigelow was arrested for possession of an open container of alcohol and, after being handcuffed, allegedly made \u201cphysical contact\u201d with two law enforcement officers. That led to charges of assault and resisting or impeding a federal officer, which carries a maximum sentence of eight years in prison.\nBigelow\u2019s public defender, Elizabeth Mullin, told U.S. Magistrate Judge Moxila A. Upadhyaya that Bigelow\u2019s charges were an example of the heavy-handed treatment authorized by Trump\u2019s task force.\n\u201cHe was caught up in this federal occupation of D.C.,\u201d Mullin said. \u201cThis was a case created by federal law enforcement.\u201d\nThe White House\u2019s Rapid Response unit was unhappy with the reporting of Bigelow\u2019s arrest.\n\u201cThis article says the man had two open containers of alcohol in his vehicle, then kicked two police officers after being questioned about it,\u201d they wrote on X.\n\u201cWe think getting would-be drunk drivers and cop beaters off our streets is a good thing.\u201d\nSpeaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday, Trump took credit for a \u201cmiracle\u201d reduction in crime.\n\u201cD.C. was a hellhole,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut now it\u2019s safe. The big question is how long do we stay? Because if we stay, we want to make sure it doesn\u2019t come back. So we have to take care of these criminals and get them out.\u201d\nHowever a week after the crime crackdown began, a CNN analysis found only a moderate drop in crime being reported, but an increase in the numbers of immigrants arrested.\nWhile robberies and car break-ins had dropped by more than 40 percent, there had been a 6 percent jump in burglaries, and assaults with a dangerous weapon jumped by 14 percent.\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson blamed the media for downplaying Trump\u2019s \u201cexceptional results\u201d in curbing D.C. crime.\n\u201cThe drops in crime are not \u2018moderate,\u2019 they are life-changing for the countless D.C. residents and visitors who have not been murdered, robbed, carjacked, or victims of overall violent crime in the last week,\u201d Jackson said in response to CNN\u2019s findings. \u201cThe priority of this operation remains getting violent criminals off the streets\u2014regardless of immigration status.\u201d\nThe president was also furious with Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser for stating that crime was already down in the city before Trump\u2019s troops arrived, again threatening a federal takeover of D.C.\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of listening to these people saying how safe it was before we got here,\u201d Trump said on Friday. \u201cIt was unsafe. It was horrible. And Mayor Bowser better get her act straight or she won\u2019t be mayor very long because we\u2019ll take it over with the federal government, run it like it\u2019s supposed to be run.\u201d"

      "text": "An underwhelming minority of voters agree with President Donald Trump\u2019s federal takeover of Washington, D.C. Figures from Quinnipiac University starkly outline the opposition. Less than half, 41 percent, said they supported Trump sending the National Guard into the capital. Just 41 percent of people approved of his crackdown in the city where crime is actually at a 30-year low. \u201cPosting the National Guard in D.C. to fight local crime gets faint support, with independent voters giving the deployment a big thumbs down,\u201d Quinnipiac said. Republicans, perhaps expectedly, support the endeavor, with 86 percent in favor. Democrats, 93 percent, and independents, at 61 percent, opposed the deployment. Thirty-seven percent of voters, meanwhile, approve of the way Donald Trump is handling his job as president, while 55 percent disapprove. Trump on Monday brushed off concerns that his crime crackdown in Washington, D.C., constitutes an overreach of his powers. \u201cMost people say \u2026 if he stops crime, he can be whatever he wants,\u201d he later added.\nRead it at Quinnipiac University"

      "text": "A federal grand jury has once again refused to indict someone arrested as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s crime crackdown, dealing another blow to his handpicked prosecutor Jeanine Pirro.\nDays after federal prosecutors were unable to secure a felony indictment against Subway sandwich hurler Sean Dunn, a grand jury has declined to indict another D.C. resident whom Pirro\u2019s office had pursued.\nAlvin Summers was charged with assault last week after attempting to drive an SUV onto the National Mall.\nAfter being stopped by a U.S. Park Police officer, he reportedly then began to \u201cspeed-walk\u201d away, and allegedly resisted arrest once the officer caught up with him.\nAccording to the charging documents, Summers \u201cswung his arms\u201d and grabbed the officer \u201cby the upper body with force,\u201d which caused them both to fall to the ground.\nBut in the latest sign of legal pushback to Trump\u2019s controversial law enforcement surge, Pirro, the former Fox News host who is now U.S Attorney for the District of Columbia, was unable to secure a federal indictment against Summers.\nHis lawyers have since filed a motion in court to dismiss the case.\n\u201cGiven the grand jury\u2019s decision, Mr. Summers should not be forced to live under the threat of later charges and rearrest,\u201d the motion says.\n\u201cThe charges against Mr. Summers were based on an allegation made by one officer who was wearing a body-worn camera. That officer\u2019s testimony was rejected by the grand jury, presumably after reviewing the body-worn camera video.\n\u201cAllowing the government the possibility of re-bringing charges under these circumstances is prejudicial and unwarranted.\u201d\nThe grand jury\u2019s decision is another blow for the administration, three weeks after Trump moved to exert his authority in the nation\u2019s capital by bringing in the National Guard and taking over D.C\u2019s metropolitan police.\nThe controversial takeover has sparked daily protests on the streets of DC, with critics accusing the president of manufacturing a crime crisis for political gain.\nIt has also led to farcical scenes, such as scores of armed National Guards being made to pick up trash and work on dozens of \u2018beautification and restoration\u2019 projects across the district in the absence of widespread crime.\nHowever, Trump insists his crackdown has made D.C a much safer place as he sets his sights on other Democrat-led cities such as Chicago, Baltimore and New York.\nThe latest figures touted by the White House show that 1369 arrests have been made since Trump intervened three weeks ago, 140 firearms have been seized and 50 homeless encampments have been cleared.\n\u201cIn just a few weeks, President Trump has done more for D.C. residents than Democrats did in 50 years. And this can be replicated in other crime-ridden cities across the nation,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday.\nBut despite a surge in arrests, Pirro\u2019s office has struggled to secure a grand jury\u2019s approval for even one indictment in federal court this month.\nIn one case, involving a D.C. resident accused of assaulting an FBI agent during an inmate swap with ICE, the federal grand jury in Washington voted \u201cno\u201d three times.\nPirro\u2019s office subsequently said it would charge the woman, Sidney Reid, with a lesser misdemeanor version of the assault charge.\nA similar reduced charge was issued for Sean Dunn, the former DOJ worker who threw a sandwich at an officer after an epic meltdown outside a Subway store earlier this month.\nImages of Dunn\u2019s confrontation went viral and prompted a PR blitz from the administration. The White House even released a video showing heavily armed agents carrying out his arrest, despite his attorney saying he had previously offered to surrender willingly.\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to Pirro\u2019s office for comment."

      "text": "The ongoing National Guard mission in Washington, DC, as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s crime crackdown in the city, is costing roughly $1 million a day, experts estimated to CNN.\nKate Kuzminski, director of studies at the Center for New American Security, told CNN that rough calculations show the mission is likely costing more than $1 million a day, when taking into account the pay for more than 2,200 National Guard troops deployed, housing, travel, food, fuel, and other logistical needs. That estimate is drawn from costs from the 2020 mobilization of roughly 5,000 National Guardsmen to DC, which was estimated to cost more than $2 million a day.\nRetired Marine Corps Col. Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who previously served as the chief of force structure and investment division at the Office of Management and Budget, also told CNN the estimated cost comes to roughly $1 million a day. Those estimates don\u2019t include the costs from other federal law enforcement agencies involved in the mission.\nThe Pentagon and National Guard did not provide cost estimates for the mission, despite having been able to do so for a similar mission just two months ago.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t know the total cost until the mission concludes,\u201d a defense official told CNN on Wednesday. The official referred CNN to the White House after follow-up questions about the daily $1 million estimate. Questions to the National Guard about the cost of the mission were referred to the Pentagon.\nThe Intercept was first to report the level of estimate on the cost of the National Guard mission.\nIt\u2019s not unusual to not have a firm idea of the final price tag for a mission like the one ongoing in DC, as logistical needs can adjust over time, and it remains unclear if service members\u2019 orders will be extended or not. But multiple US officials who spoke to CNN said the reluctance to provide a number is also due to the involvement of senior levels of the Pentagon and the White House in the mission, and a tight grasp on the flow of information about it.\nTwo US officials told CNN there was likely a rough estimate available for the DC mission, or one being calculated, but that only the most senior levels had permission to speak about it due to the political nature of the mission and the White House\u2019s involvement. Communication about the cost, one of the officials said, is typically approved at much lower levels than the current mission. Because the mission is being funded federally, one of the officials said, the money is coming from the departments of the Army and the Air Force.\n\u201cWe know that funding is made available, we just don\u2019t know the estimate or who\u2019s approving it or how much is available,\u201d the second US official said, adding that \u201ceverybody wants to have their hands in\u201d communication surrounding the mission due to the White House\u2019s interest in it.\nA third US official said it\u2019s likely a mixture of both \u2014 that a cost estimate is generally still being calculated, but that until senior levels of the Pentagon or White House determine they want to release that information, it won\u2019t be shared.\nStill, the Pentagon was able to give a cost estimate for the LA mission in June just three days after roughly 4,000 Guardsmen were mobilized to assist law enforcement.\n\u201cThe current estimated cost is $134 million which is largely just (temporary duty) cost, travel, housing, food, etc.,\u201d Bryn MacDonnell, a special assistant to the secretary of defense and official performing the duties of the under secretary of defense, told Congress on June 10. President Donald Trump signed a memorandum mobilizing the first batch of 2,000 Guardsmen on June 7.\nAs of Tuesday morning, there were 2,254 National Guard troops in DC \u2014 more than 1,300 of them from the six states who sent personnel to support the DC National Guard. While some troops are stationed through the city at metro stations and monuments or memorials, soldiers and airmen have also begun helping with \u201cbeautification projects,\u201d doing things like picking up trash, replanting grass, and spreading mulch.\nIn addition to the service members\u2019 pay during the mission while they are on orders, the total cost of the mission also includes basic logistical needs like hotel rooms for out-of-state troops, food and water, fuel for vehicles, laundry service, and more."

      "text": "Six Republican governors sending National Guard troops to D.C.\nSix Republican governors sending National Guard troops to D.C.\nSix GOP governors are sending National Guard troops to assist in Trump's D.C. crime crackdown, even though crime levels in major cities in some of those states are higher than in the U.S. capital.\nA MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST:\nA total of six states have now promised to send their National Guard troops to Washington, D.C.\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\nThat will add more than 1,100 new soldiers to patrol the streets. The deployments follow President Trump's declaring what he called a, quote, \"crime emergency\" in the capital, unquote. All the states sending troops are led by Republicans, and that has some others expressing concern that the Guard is being politicized. In a few minutes, we'll speak to a former vice chief of the National Guard Bureau to get his take on whether this use of the Guard matches its expertise. But first...\nMART\u00cdNEZ: NPR criminal justice reporter Meg Anderson joins us to explain. So as Michel just mentioned, the deployments are from states with Republican governors. I mean, that can't be a coincidence, is it?\nMEG ANDERSON, BYLINE: Yeah, yeah, it's not. So far, the states are West Virginia, South Carolina, Mississippi, Louisiana, Ohio and, as of yesterday, Tennessee. And, you know, in their statements, they echoed what Trump has said about crime in D.C. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said the troops were there to, quote, \"support President Trump in his mission to restore law and order.\" And this really is falling mostly on partisan lines. Yesterday, Governor Laura Kelly of Kansas - she's the chair of the Democratic Governors' Association - put out a statement urging state leaders to, quote, \"reject the temptation to use their soldiers to reinforce a dangerous, politically motivated agenda.\" And I should note Vermont Governor Phil Scott - he's a Republican. He said he's not going to send his troops. He didn't feel like it would be an acceptable and appropriate use of them.\nMART\u00cdNEZ: OK. Now, the thing I think a lot of people find puzzling is that many of these states are sending troops to D.C. have cities with crime rates that are higher than the capital. Don't they need them?\nANDERSON: Yeah, that's true. I looked at last year's murder rates, and in Jackson, Mississippi, the murder rate was more than four times the rate in D.C. In Memphis, it was nearly triple in New Orleans. It was nearly double. I spoke about this with Insha Rahman. She's with the advocacy group, the Vera Institute of Justice. They work to end mass incarceration.\nINSHA RAHMAN: Trump enlisting Republican governors to send National Guard troops signals one thing very clearly - that this is about a political power grab and political theater, not about making cities safer.\nANDERSON: To be clear, D.C. still has had higher violent crime rates than many other major cities, but the numbers are falling.\nMART\u00cdNEZ: Now, did you reach out to any of those governors who are deploying troops?\nANDERSON: I did. I only heard back from Ohio Governor Mike DeWine's Office. They said they've sent their troops outside the state before, including the inaugurations of both President Trump and former President Joe Biden, and also to protests in Minneapolis and natural disasters in Florida, North Carolina and Louisiana.\nMART\u00cdNEZ: So how well suited is the National Guard at actually policing streets?\nANDERSON: So the National Guard usually is engaged in crowd control or helping in the aftermath of a natural disaster. They are not experienced in doing local police work. Policing expert Mark Kupanski noted that, too. He's with Arnold Ventures, a group that funds criminal justice initiatives, and he says he suspects using the Guard like this is not going to reduce crime.\nMARC KRUPANSKI: This is kind of described as, like, the grenade effect, where they throw a considerable amount of resources at a problem over a short period of time. And that might help to drive that number down in the short term, but it doesn't actually help address the problem over the long run.\nANDERSON: And, you know, he stressed that there are long-term strategies that we do know work in lowering crime, things like community policing and boosting social services in neighborhoods, like adding employment opportunities and mental health resources.\nMART\u00cdNEZ: That is NPR's Meg Anderson. Meg, thanks.\nANDERSON: You're welcome.\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NPR. All rights reserved.

      "text": "President Donald Trump has doubled down on his campaign against crime in Washington, D.C., with another Truth Social post in which he boldly proclaimed: \u201cThe White House is in charge.\u201d\nThe post, published on Wednesday night, repeats many of the same talking points Trump used\u2014and was subsequently criticized for\u2014at the Monday press conference where he announced his decision to federalize D.C. police.\nIn it, Trump argues, \u201cWashington, D.C., has one of the Highest Rates of Crime in the World, more than many of the most violent Third World Countries.\u201d\nHe continues, \u201dThe City\u2019s Homicide Rate is higher than places notorious for their violence, such as Mexico City, Bogota, Islamabad, and Addis Ababa \u2014 Almost ten times higher than Fallujah, Iraq.\u201d\n\u201dIf D.C. were a State, it would have the highest Homicide Rate of any State in America.\u201d\nIn the lengthy post, Trump continued to detail the number of ways crime has reportedly taken hold in D.C., including \u201cgang youth violence\u201d that is \u201dso common it goes largely unreported\u201d and the fact that citizens living in fear have given up on calling the police, \u201clest they be targeted.\u201d\nHe ended his screed with, \u201cD.C. has been under siege from thugs and killers, but now, D.C. is back under Federal Control where it belongs.\u201d\n\u201dThe White House is in charge. The Military and our Great Police will liberate this City, scrape away the filth, and make it safe, clean, habitable and beautiful once more!\u201d\nFollowing the Monday press conference where he made similar claims, news outlets were quick to check the veracity of his statements. PolitiFact noted that the data Trump was referring to was from 2023, and that D.C.\u2019s homicide rate has fallen \u201cconsiderably\u201d since then.\nIn 2024, D.C.\u2019s homicide rate was 27.3 per 100,000 people, with a Justice Department press release issued in early January prior to Trump\u2019s inauguration noting that violent crime in the district was down 35 percent, making it the lowest it has been in over 30 years.\nThe New York Times\u2019 report on Trump\u2019s claims explains that 49 cities around the world have higher homicide rates than D.C., including three capital cities and six other U.S. cities, including St. Louis, New Orleans and Detroit.\nDetermining that Trump\u2019s claim that D.C.\u2019s homicide rate was \u201cnumber one that we can find anywhere in the world\u201d was false, PolitiFact wrote, \u201dTrump stretched an outdated homicide rate into an inaccurate blanket statement.\u201d\nOf his decision to federalize D.C. police and deploy the National Guard, Trump told reporters on Wednesday, \u201cI don\u2019t want to call a national emergency. If I have to I will. But I think the Republicans in Congress will approve this pretty much unanimously.\u201d\nUnder Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, the president can take emergency control of D.C.\u2019s police, but unless Congress passes a law extending the president\u2019s control, it lasts only 30 days.\nTrump confirmed to reporters that he would be seeking \u201clong term extensions\u201d on these powers, adding that in the long term, \u201cWe\u2019re going to need a crime bill that we\u2019re going to be putting in, and it\u2019s going to pertain initially to DC.\u201d\nTuesday night\u2019s deployment of officers on the city saw 43 arrests, according to The Guardian, a smaller number than the 76 arrests that day. Agency data gathered in the report suggested an average of 56 daily arrests in 2024. A White House official warned that \u201csignificantly higher\u201d numbers of National Guard troops were expected in coming days, including 24-hour patrols by federal agents."

      "text": "National Guard troops that President Donald Trump ordered into Washington, D.C., have been spotted picking up trash after Trump slashed the federal workforce.\nThe troops, whom Trump deployed after declaring a \u201ccrime emergency\u201d in the capital, were seen wearing yellow gloves and orange vests over their camouflage uniforms in Lafayette Park across from the White House on Tuesday, according to WTTG-TV.\nJoint Task Force-D.C., which has been overseeing the Guard\u2019s operations since Trump deployed the troops, said the service members have been tasked with helping on more than 40 \u201cbeautification projects\u201d around the city, according to The Washington Post. Officials say the troops were also collecting trash in Lafayette Square, the Tidal Basin, and the National Mall.\nMuch of the work being carried out by the Guards would normally fall under the remit of the National Park Service, which, despite struggling for staff before the Trump administration, has suffered at the hands of Trump\u2019s sweeping cuts to the federal workforce.\nOne official with the Park Service said it once had 200 people working in the gardens in D.C.; now it has 20. \u201cIt\u2019s everybody\u2014the masons, the maintenance workers, the groundskeepers, the plumbers. Every shop is short,\u201d they told the Post, which reported that the Guards are being used to pick up the slack.\nThe Park Service lost almost a quarter of its permanent staff during Trump\u2019s second term, according to the nonprofit National Parks Conservation Association.\nWhile it\u2019s not unusual for troops to be involved in the cleanup of major emergencies, such as civil unrest and natural disasters, their use as gardeners in the wake of a presidential directive has raised questions about whether it is an effective use of resources.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s nice, as a D.C. resident,\u201d one Guard member told the Post. \u201cBut there are different things we could be doing.\u201d An official with the task force told the outlet that troops involved in the trash collecting won\u2019t be armed, unlike those on other duties in D.C.\u2014including traffic control.\nJoint Task Force-D.C. said in a statement to the Daily Beast that the National Guard was playing \u201ca variety of roles\u201d as part of a plan to \u201cMake D.C. safe and beautiful again,\u201d which included providing law enforcement with a safe area in which to make arrests, as well as being visible with the aim of acting as a deterrent and take part in the \u201cbeautification process.\u201d\nThe Daily Beast has contacted both the White House and the National Park Service for further comment.\nThe White House claims that more than 1,000 arrests have been made during the crackdown in D.C., which has also involved federal law enforcement being sent out onto the streets. Local officials have protested the move, citing data showing that crime is at a 30-year low in the city.\nTrump\u2019s plans are also facing pushback in the D.C. federal courthouse. Grand jurors on three occasions this month have refused prosecutors\u2019 push to indict one woman accused of assaulting an FBI agent, while a federal magistrate judge said another arrest in D.C. stemmed from the \u201cmost illegal search I\u2019ve seen in my life,\u201d according to the Post. The judge also said another arrest had lacked \u201cbasic human dignity.\u201d\nSean Parnell, spokesperson for the Pentagon, told the newspaper that the Defense Department \u201cis incredibly proud of our D.C. National Guardsmen and their work to make D.C. Safe and Beautiful Again.\u201d\nIn a Truth Social post earlier this month, Trump vowed to make D.C. \u201cmore beautiful than it ever was before\u201d while also ordering homeless people in the city to immediately \u201cmove out.\u201d His post included pictures of tents that appear to have been taken from his motorcade while driving from the White House to his golf club in Virginia."

      "text": "US President Donald Trump has stepped up his criticism of the security situation in Washington, DC, now claiming that the US capital has a homicide rate higher than some Latin American capitals such as Bogot\u00e1, Mexico City and Lima.\nDuring a press conference on Monday, Trump announced that he would place the Metropolitan Police Department \u201cunder direct federal control\u201d and deploy 800 National Guard troops in an effort to \u201ctake back the city.\u201d\n\u201cThe murder rate in Washington today is higher than that of Bogot\u00e1, Colombia; Mexico City, or some of the places that you hear about as being the worst places on Earth. It\u2019s much higher,\u201d Trump said.\nTrump said the move to \u201cliberate\u201d Washington was part of a broader initiative to \u201ctake back control\u201d of cities he said were threatened by violence.\n\u201cAll is double or triple, so you want to live in places like that? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d the president said, referring to the fact that Washington surpasses Latin American cities like Brasilia, Panama City, and San Jos\u00e9 in homicide rates.\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser called Trump\u2019s decision to place the Metropolitan Police Department under federal control and deploy the National Guard \u201calarming and unprecedented.\u201d While she said she wasn\u2019t entirely surprised, she warned in a press conference that she would not \u201cminimize the intrusion on the autonomy\u201d of the city.\nBowser also assured residents that the local government continues to operate \u201cin a way that makes citizens proud\u201d and has since met with Attorney General Pam Bondi, who, according to the executive order, will have the authority delegated by Trump to coordinate actions with the city. The mayor also clarified that \u201cnothing has changed\u201d in the Metropolitan Police Department\u2019s organizational chart.\nWhat do the numbers say?\nTrump based his statements on a graph corresponding to 2024, which shows a homicide rate of 27.5 per 100,000 inhabitants in Washington, a figure that \u2013 according to him \u2013 would place it above Bogot\u00e1, Colombia (15), Panama City, Panama (15), San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica (13), Mexico City, Mexico (10), Lima, Peru (7.7), and Brasilia, Brazil (6.8).\nOfficial statistics for all these cities, obtained from organizations such as Mexico\u2019s INEGI, the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Panama, and the goverment of the capital of Brazil, Brasilia, among others, seem to confirm Trump\u2019s statement: Washington did surpass several Latin American capitals in the murder rate per 100,000 inhabitants in recent years, although this is only one of many other crime rates.\nHowever, the most recent official data reflect a more nuanced picture.\nAccording to an analysis by CNN journalist Daniel Dale, crime in Washington has declined significantly since a spike in 2023, when 274 homicides were recorded, the highest number in more than two decades.\nIn 2024, murders dropped to 187, and so far in 2025, they continue to decline. Data from crime expert Jeff Asher, cited by Dale, indicates that homicides in Washington fell 34% compared with 2023 through July of this year. Furthermore, the violent crime rate in 2024 was the second lowest since 1966.\nA preliminary analysis by the Washington Metropolitan Police Department confirms this trend: Overall crime has also decreased so far in 2025, in line with the sustained decline seen in other major US cities, such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago."

Gavin Newsom pointed out that crime in Johnson\u2019s home state of Louisiana is several times worse than in the Golden State.\nJohnson spoke haltingly after he was played a clip Friday on Fox and Friends of Newsom pointing out that the murder rate in Louisiana is \u201cnearly four times higher\u201d than in California.\n\u201cGavin Newsom will do anything for attention. He can name-drop me all, all,\u201d Johnson stammered, \u201cthat he wants. He needs to go and govern his state and not be engaging in all of this.\u201d\n\u201cWe have crime,\u201d he stuttered, \u201cin cities across America.\u201d\nHe added that his hometown of Shreveport, Louisiana, has \u201cdone a great job of reducing crime, gradually,\u201d and said it was import to address crime \u201ceverywhere that it rears its ugly head.\u201d\n\u201cI think every major city in the country\u2014the residents of those cities are open to that, and anxious to have it,\u201d he said.\nCrime rates in red and blue states have come under fresh scrutiny after President Donald Trump ordered thousands of National Guard troops into Democratic-led cities like Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.\u2014with Chicago next on his list.\nThe administration claims the deployments are necessary to \u201cliberate\u201d residents of those cities from crime, which they say has turned American streets in war zones.\nJohnson\u2019s office did not immediately respond to request for comment.\nDemocratic governors, however, have argued the deployments have nothing to do with public safety, since Trump isn\u2019t sending in troops to the states with the highest crime rates\u2014which happen to be controlled by Republicans.\n\u201cIf he is to invest in crime suppression, I hope the president of the United States would look at the facts,\u201d Newsom said during a press conference on Thursday. \u201cJust consider Speaker Johnson\u2019s state and district. Just look at the murder rate that\u2019s nearly four times higher than California in Louisiana.\u201d\nThe vast majority of Americans do not approve of the president sending in soldiers to quell local crime. A Quinnipiac University poll released this week found that just 41 percent of respondents approved of Trump posting the National Guard in Washington, D.C., to fight crime.\nThose troops have not been trained in local law enforcement, and the crackdown has wreaked havoc on the courts as judges are flooded with cases involving trumped-up charges.\nAnd despite Trump\u2019s claims that Washington is as dangerous as a third-world city, soldiers in the nation\u2019s capital have been picking up trash and spreading mulch to pass the time.\nAn analysis by Axios found that 13 of the top 20 cities with the highest homicide rates were located in states with Republican governors. At the state level, eight of the top 10 states with the highest murder rates are red states."

Elkin, Universidad Externado de Colombia\nDate of the document : November 12, 2007\nKeyWords : police ; local elected representatives, local public servants ; training and development officers ; governance ; law and order ; political culture ; COLOMBIA ;Las dos preguntas que plantea Elkin Vel\u00e1squez en su ponencia son las siguientes : \u00bf Por qu\u00e9 ha funcionado en Bogot\u00e1 la apropiaci\u00f3n de las normas de convivencia y de seguridad por parte de los ciudadanos? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 han bajado de manera tan importante las tasas de crimen y de homicidio en Bogot\u00e1 cuando se manten\u00edan iguales o peores en muchas otras ciudades de Colombia, de Latinoam\u00e9rica y del mundo?\nEn 1993, la tasa de homicidio en Bogot\u00e1 era de 81,2 homicidios por 100.000 habitantes ; en 2006, la misma tasa hab\u00eda bajado a 18,8 homicidios por 100.000 habitantes.\nDesde 1991 y el cambio constitucional, el tema de la seguridad ciudadana ha sido concebido como una responsabilidad importante por los distintos alcaldes de Bogot\u00e1. A partir de 1995, las pol\u00edticas p\u00fablicas de A. Mockus instauran un esquema de \u201cgobernabilidad no formalizada\u201d que ha permitido la sostenibilidad y la continuidad de la pol\u00edtica de seguridad ciudadana. Hubo tambi\u00e9n un desmantelamiento importante de los carteles de la droga en Cundinamarca. En los \u00faltimos 15 a\u00f1os se puede decir que hubo una continuidad sin continuismo ; una forma de consenso para darle continuidad en el tiempo a la pol\u00edtica iniciada por Antanas Mockus.\nTambi\u00e9n, se trat\u00f3 de una pol\u00edtica p\u00fablica muy flexible ; lo que siempre rend\u00eda posible un dispositivo de negociaci\u00f3n y de cooperaci\u00f3n amplia entre una pluralidad de actores. Las soluciones de gobernabilidad que se han construido de manera colectiva en el caso de Bogota fueron muy eficientes. La fuerza p\u00fablica ha aceptado el liderazgo de los responsables pol\u00edticos de los gobiernos municipales.\nLos resultados principales de esas pol\u00edticas p\u00fablicas han sido el aumento de la confianza institucional y el crecimiento del nivel de auto-estima de los habitantes de la ciudad.

  "argos_summary": "President Trump\u2019s deployment of National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. to address crime has shifted them to beautification tasks, such as trash collection and landscaping, after federal workforce cuts. The operation, costing roughly $1\u202fmillion per day, has drawn criticism for diverting troops from policing duties and for the low public approval of the move. Despite Trump\u2019s claims of high crime rates, data show D.C.\u2019s violent crime is at a 30\u2011year low, and the crackdown has faced legal pushback and limited effectiveness in reducing crime.",
