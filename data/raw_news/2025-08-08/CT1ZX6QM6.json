  "title": "Umamusume players hold a digital funeral for Grass Wonder, the real, 30-year-old racehorse behind one of the game's beloved anime horse girls: \"May you eat dandelions in heaven\"",
  "description": "Developer Cygames also \"share our condolences\"",
  "content": "Grass Wonder, a real racehorse who inspired the Umamusume: Pretty Derby character of the same name, died at age 30. Fans of the anime horse girl racing sim have turned up in droves to mourn the horse online.\n\nDeveloper Cygames has also joined in. \"It is with heavy hearts that we share that Grass Wonder passed away on August 8,\" the studio wrote on Twitter. \"The legendary racehorse's legacy serves as the inspiration for the character of the same name in Umamusume: Pretty Derby. We share our condolences to all the staff involved in Grass Wonder's care.\"\n\nJapanese farm Big Red Farm shared the news of Grass Wonder's death earlier today. A machine translation of the farm's post says Grass Wonder had been in good health this year, but age-related organ failure saw him take a sudden and rapid turn for the worse.\n\n30 years old is actually a pretty darn good run for a horse, especially a retired racehorse. And Grass Wonder is indeed a racing legend. The JBIS racehorse database shows a sterling record with multiple major wins in just a few years.\n\nA lot of the real racehorses behind Umamusume's horse girls have died; Grass Wonder is the most recent, and the first since the game's Steam release and subsequent global explosion. This seems to have fueled an especially large crowd for the digital funeral.\n\n\"May you eat dandelions in heaven,\" ShenUltima writes on the Umamusume Reddit.\n\n\"Bro it was just yesterday that I laughed at her fat pic,\" one top comment reads, referring to a heavily memed photograph showing Grass Wonder enjoying his retirement by packing on some pounds. \"Fatty (heartbroken),\" another reply adds, riffing on the mood and status modifiers in Umamusume. \"Rest in peace our beloved fatty,\" one player says.\n\n\"Grass Wonder had a long fulfilling life and was an exceptional horse who will be remembered for a long time,\" the top reply to a separate mourning thread reads. \"I'm sure Special Week will be excited to see him again.\" (Special Week, the face of Umamusume, died in 2018.)\n\n\"May you find ever greener pastures on the other side, Grass,\" one user says in the top thread sharing the news.\n\nSteam users obsessed with a pink horse girl sent so many kilograms of grass to the real horse she's based on that it broke the food donation website: \"It's very crowded right now\"",

      "text": "Steam users obsessed with a pink horse girl sent so many kilograms of grass to the real horse she's based on that it broke the food donation website: \"It's very crowded right now\"\nUmamusume star Haru Urara is well fed in her retirement\nAnime horse girls: they're in. The Steam debut of Umamusume: Pretty Derby, a gacha racing and management sim where you train horse girls inspired by real racehorses, has brought a Japanese juggernaut to PC and a global audience. It has also indirectly convinced a whole lot of those players to spend their would-be gacha funds on a much nobler cause: feeding real horses.\nThe current adopted daughter of the Umamusume community is Haru Urara, a pink-haired underdog who shares both name and history with a horse who famously lost every single race of her competitive career. Haru Urara, the real, 29-year-old horse \u2013 and 29 is pretty old for a horse, especially a racehorse \u2013 has exploded in popularity in her retirement thanks to her digital counterpart, with Umamusume fans heaping praise and fan art on the character.\nTwitter user ChrisValence has helpfully collected fan art from folks like DasDokter, collating the \"We love our girlfailure daughter, 1 billion kg of ryegrass to Haru Urara\" movement.\nAccumulating the fanart of \"We love our girlfailure daughter, 1 billion kg of ryegrass to Haru Urara!\"I find them adorable beyond words, adding as I find them.#umamusumeprettyderby #haruurara pic.twitter.com/FxHRt055TBJuly 12, 2025\nAll that fan art is also furthering the campaign to heap grass on the real horse.\nA few days ago, a viral Twitter post from user Tarumage noted that, \"to support Haru Urara, you can send a gift of fresh ryegrass through a special delivery service. This refrigerated, highly palatable ryegrass (not hay) costs 6,000 JP yen, including shipping.\" That post has 14 million views at the time of writing, demonstrating the throngs of Haru fans that turned up.\nThat service, machine translated as the Fresh Hay Bank, is described as a crowd-gifting site that lets users deliver delicious and healthy feed to retired horses. One 5 kilogram box, which costs about $40 USD, is said to be good for two horse-sized meals.\nAt the time of writing, 2,590 kilograms of grass has been donated to Haru Urara, though only some of that was sent in the past few days. That said, 35 kilograms have been donated in the past few hours alone. I've reached out to the company for specifics, and for comment on this spike in donations.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\n#umamusume millions of trainers in the world in unison: https://t.co/IWpXEHEM6l pic.twitter.com/s58eMqLnjqJuly 12, 2025\nAfter that Twitter post first went viral, many Umamusume fans, and eventually Tarumage themselves, noted that the donation portal for the website had crashed. Sure enough, when I checked it earlier today, it had once again buckled due to high traffic. An English error message reads: \"It's very crowded right now. Please wait a while and try accessing again.\"\nUmamusume has so effectively galvanized the horse girl fan base that it has dedicated \"guidelines for visiting stables in Japan\" on its website, encouraging players to be respectful and avoid repeats of past incidents of \"visitors neglecting stable rules, trespassing, and photographing/filming without the stable\u2019s consent.\"\nI recently visited Japan for the first time and I've been around horses several times here in the American South, so I speak with some experience when I say that you don't want to mess with horses, Japanese rules, or especially Japanese rules about horses.\nAustin has been a game journalist for 12 years, having freelanced for the likes of PC Gamer, Eurogamer, IGN, Sports Illustrated, and more while finishing his journalism degree.

      "text": "Steam faces a stampede: horse girl game Umamusume: Pretty Derby is \"actual cinema,\" and a massive hit on PC with 5,000 overwhelmingly positive reviews after a week\nIt turns out gambling is fun, and gambling inside of gambling is even more fun\nIf you're unfamiliar with horses, imagine a big, skittish dog with short hair and really long legs. Now imagine horse girls. They're like horses, but they're girls \u2013 girls with little horse ears and tails. Finally, picture horse girl racing, which is like horse racing but with horse girls. Congratulations, you are now equipped with all the knowledge you need to start playing Umamusume: Pretty Derby, a massive Japanese mobile game that recently launched on Steam in English with the kind of momentum and reception that any game would kill for.\nAt the time of writing, Umamusume: Pretty Derby has 5,017 user reviews on Steam, with an overwhelmingly positive grade score of 95%. It came out on June 24. Even for a free-to-play port of a years-old mobile titan, those are pretty impressive numbers\n\"Umamusume. They are born to run,\" the game's endearingly dramatic, almost romantic Steam page begins. \"They inherit otherworldly names, and are inspirited by dreams most dramatic and wonderful. Now, they run ever forward. That, is their destiny. No one knows how the races that lie in their futures will end. Even so, they continue to run, aiming only toward the goal in front of them.\"\nHere's the rub, building on the horse girl thing from earlier. Umamusume: Pretty Derby is basically a sports management sim gacha game with gambling stuffed into every possible corner. Collecting horse girls is an RNG gamble designed to encourage spending, and the races themselves are painstakingly modeled after actual gambling-laden horse racing, complete with live commentary, come-from-behind twists, and the real horses the girls are based on.\nIt's kind of ingenious, honestly. It was an instant hit in Japan, where horse racing is ha-yuge, and its global PC launch is already massive. You play as a trainer looking after horse girls and helping them win races. The horse girls also perform idol concerts; don't worry about it.\nThe game's wiki has a handy new player guide, which can basically be summed up as: collect and interact with Umamusume, watch some cute little animated snippets every now and then, boost their stats, keep them happy, and watch 'em run.\nThat being said, this is serious business, as many new Umamusume players were shocked to discover. Get this: gambling is fun, and rooting for your favorite horse (girl) can be emotionally intense, especially when you've become attached to them via story and character developments. Victory is sweet but defeat is bitter, and somebody has to lose. It's like a sports anime designed to squeeze money out of you \u2013 though in fairness, people do say Umamusume is 'free-to-play friendly,' which is of course damning with fine praise, but hey, it's still praise.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nLiterally how I feel playing Umamusume and I\u2019m not even kidding pic.twitter.com/upXFnkNcoXJuly 1, 2025\n\"I never praise gacha games but Umamusume is insane. Actual Cinema,\" one player reports in a viral clip, watching their girl surge to the front of the pack for a close win.\nThis is exactly what playing \"Umamusume: Pretty Derby\" is like... #umamusumeprettyderby https://t.co/qjQ3JJP27q pic.twitter.com/lu2BqlAelpJune 29, 2025\nThe top-rated user review on Steam offers a good demonstration of what this game can do to people. Behold the words of Gekko:\n\"I gave her the best shoes, the best meals, trained her under the clearest skies, and yet\u2026 she lost. She stumbled on the final corner, and I stumbled as a trainer, no, as a human being.\n\"How do I look her in the eyes after this? Those bright, hopeful eyes that once sparkled with dreams of victory\u2026 now clouded with tears. 'I'll win next time, Trainer!' she said, forcing a smile through her trembling lips \u2014 but I knew it was for my sake.\"\nTheir closing remarks offer a somber warning: \"If you're reading this\u2026 cherish your horsegirl. Don't make the same mistakes I did. Because sometimes, it's not the race you lose \u2014 it\u2019s her trust.\"\nIf that sounds like fun, the game couldn't be easier to try, and as ever gacha games give out tons of free stuff following major launches and milestones like this. If you're interested in the whole racing thing but understandably despise gacha systems, you can also give the Umamusume anime a watch. I'll tell you right now, for all the genre's obvious flaws and hazards, there ain't no animation like gacha-funded animation.\nAustin has been a game journalist for 12 years, having freelanced for the likes of PC Gamer, Eurogamer, IGN, Sports Illustrated, and more while finishing his journalism degree.

      "text": "Someone actually did it: an Umamusume player got so into horse girls that they \"bought a racehorse\" for \u00a36,000 a year, says she \"mostly reminds me of Gold Ship\"\nNew horse co-owner Oxijinn says their horse Jax Belle is doing well\nAfter an expert horse racing grandpa found a whole new fandom, the frenzy around Umamusume: Pretty Derby's global PC release has hit a new high thanks to one player who took their would-be gacha funds and invested them in a real racehorse instead.\nA few days ago, Reddit user Oxijinn announced that they had \"bought a race horse,\" swiftly rocketing to the top of the Umamusume community and earning adorable fan art of their horse, Jax Belle. Oxijinn is co-sponsoring Jax, taking on a \u00a36,000 annual fee to train and house her. \"Several of us chip in financially,\" they explained in a Reddit reply.\n\"The way I 'own' it is that, yes I am considered the 'owner' of the horse, but I don't keep it nor do I train it,\" they explained elsewhere. \"I pay for its upkeep in a stable/pasture where it grows up and simultaneously pay for a professional trainer to train it into a race horse fit to win. You could be a trainer and an owner presumably, but I'd rather leave training the real horses to the professionals whilst I just train virtual horse girls.\"\nI have been checking the English Umamusume community with quite some regularity hoping that somebody, somewhere would one day do exactly this, so it goes without saying that I immediately reached out to talk about this horse.\nJax Belle Update! from r/UmaMusume\nOxijinn tells me they got into Umamusume after joking with friends about the \"anime horse girl gacha game,\" only to find themselves \"actually enjoying the game\" and getting extremely invested since its PC release last month. Their favorite horse girls are Symboli Rudolf, Gold Ship, Haru Urara (a community darling), and Meijiro McQueen. Essentially adopting their own real horse \"was simply due to luck,\" they say, as they \"had a connection to a horse breeder/owner\" and could skip the initial purchase price as a result.\nJax Belle's non-racing name is Bluebell, and as an owner Oxijinn is free to visit to see her up close. They saw her at her first race earlier this month \u2013 which she lost after getting kicked by another horse, an injury she's apparently recovering well from \u2013 and plan to visit her at her home stable soon.\nNaturally, I asked if Jax Belle's temperament reminds Oxijinn of any specific Umamusume horse girls. \"So far Jax Belle mostly reminds me of Gold Ship if anyone,\" they explained. Gold Ship is a notoriously unpredictable Uma based on a horse that once set \"12 billion yen\" on fire by throwing a race, and it seems Jax Belle is also hard to pin down. \"She loved the cameras when I saw her last Friday and will just do random stuff when she wants.\"\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\n\"The one time Belle has raced was more captivating than most of the races I've done in Umamusume, save for my first career win,\" they add. \"I can imagine only getting more involved in Belle's races though when she can go full power in her next race.\"\n\"I might have to build up the menace to society that is Gold Ship but whether or not my phone can handle all the drop kicks is unknown. I'll certainly try though.\"\nIn a new update on Jax's health, Oxijinn writes: \"I didn't expect the original post to blow up as much as it did so thank you for the amazing support and lovely fan art some people submitted! If you want to make your own, feel free to!\"\n\"We will watch your career with great interest,\" a fellow Umamusume player replies.\nAustin has been a game journalist for 12 years, having freelanced for the likes of PC Gamer, Eurogamer, IGN, Sports Illustrated, and more while finishing his journalism degree.

      "text": "Horse girl gacha gamers are so obsessed with pink racer Haru Urara that the farm that owns the real-life horse she's based on, who never won a single race, had to respond\nUmamusume: Pretty Derby is pro-loser\nIn this world, there are those who think of themselves as winners, there are undoubtedly losers, and then there's the milk chocolate mare Haru Urara, who's failed every real-life competition she's been in, but is currently enjoying a second wind as an anime horse girl in the gacha game Umamusume: Pretty Derby.\nThe character she inspired, a cherry blossom-pink student with an indefatigable spirit and the same name, has now become so popular, the farm in Japan that's tending to the actual Haru Urara acknowledged it in a recent Twitter post.\nA photo of Haru Urara wearing a dignified plastic tiara on her birthday in February became, it seemed, at the time, inexplicably popular. The picture \u2013 in which the 29-year-old Bay politely knocks her charcoal knees together like a prim ballerina \u2013 now sits at 25,000 likes and over 2 million views.\n\u30a6\u30e9\u30e9\u3055\u3093\u3001\u304a\u8a95\u751f\u65e5\u304a\u3081\u3067\u3068\u3046\ud83c\udf38#\u30de\u30fc\u30b5\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0#\u30cf\u30eb\u30a6\u30e9\u30e9 pic.twitter.com/JxtzsIJOjkFebruary 26, 2025\nAfter realizing what was happening, in a July 2 post (translated with DeepL), one of Haru Urara's caretakers at Matha Farm shares happily that the horse's birthday post received \"another 10,000 likes since yesterday.\" Alongside another photo of Haru Urara \u2013 in this one, she's hanging out with a hibiscus flower daintily decorating her giant head \u2013 the caretaker assuages fans that \"Ms. Haru Urara is doing very well. In fact, she is even healthier and more energetic than I am!\" It also seems they've added the explicit disclaimer in their bio that they don't play Umamusume.\nIn 2004, the Los Angeles Times reported that the famously untalented horse Haru Urara \"was out doing what she does best [...], losing her 106th consecutive race.\" But here we are, over 20 years later, and an Umamusume player who once visited the mare in her retirement agrees that \"she's still living a happy and healthy life.\"\n\"She ran so many races, and now she's finally able to enjoy some peaceful time,\" the fan continues.
