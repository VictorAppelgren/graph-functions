      "feedback": "This draft shows a solid regime-based framework with credible, cross-name anchors (Ford yield/multiple floor, Schlumberger shareholder yield, Microsoft/Shopify cloud momentum, UNH/LULU cash generation) and a coherent narrative about how rate normalization and moat durability interact with cash generation; however, to reach world-class quality it needs a focused, four-line Swing Trade, tighter first-principles causality, and fully tied, source-backed numbers with precise triggers. Actionable edits: 1) Reformat to exactly four Swing Trade lines (2 Up, 2 Down) only, each with: Direction | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability % | Confidence, and then provide a single concise Outlook/Swing plan line if applicable; remove the extra 0–3/3–6 month/weekly segments that currently exceed the required count. 2) Build a crisp, first-principles causal chain per line: map inflation/discount-rate dynamics to multiples, link moats/cash flow to valuation resilience, and tie AI/cloud and energy-cash returns to durable upside; include a compact sensitivity or rule-of-thumb (e.g., “rate normalization compresses multiples; cash-generative moats cushion drawdowns”). 3) Quantify aggressively but anchor every factual claim to a source: include Ford’s 5% yield and ~10.3 forward P/E, Ford EV segment loss (~$1.3B) in the line(s) that discuss autos; Shopify GMV ~$163B (+27%) and revenue +29%; MSFT Azure growth 39%, cloud book ~$368B, payout 33.6%, forward yield ~0.7%; UNH/LULU cash-flow metrics; cite each fact inline (IDs: 65UUBU0OR, 6U8VYS7BA, NBX9RA9WX, 19NO2GMNF, QGXA2WQJ3, W2622L6WW, 48JXC9VDP, 5S9GJV2O3, UVEQ2SJ0W, HWGNUP2XG). 4) Resolve conflicts and avoid narrative drift by stating clear consensus vs. alternative signals: e.g., acknowledge regime risks from tariff shocks and EV ramp timing (65UUBU0OR, IGP1Q4ZEJ) and separately note the cloud/AI tailwind strength (W2622L6WW, 48JXC9VDP). 5) Tighten the “What to watch” items into 1–2 high-signal triggers per line and drop broader commentary; ensure the two Down lines explicitly flag catalysts like tariff/regulatory pressure or EV margin deterioration. 6) Ensure the four lines carry the exact, market-relevant probabilities and a transparent confidence band (0–100) tied to the cited signals, with the Trade/Outlook Plan extracted as one sharp line if the asset remains tradable (Shopify as the tradable focal point); 7) Eliminate filler and ensure each claim uses only IDs from the SOURCE MATERIAL, with reconciliation notes where numbers conflict across sources. The result will be: four clean, evidence-backed swing lines plus a concise outlook, fully aligned to SECTION FOCUS and format.",
