  "description": "Standalone console or the Mario Kart World bundle, you choose",
  "content": "Nintendo\u2019s latest console might be one of its least original hardware releases ever, being a souped-up version of the massively successful Switch. Despite that, the Switch 2 has quickly become a beloved staple in the gaming world \u2013 and if you\u2019ve been waiting for a good opportunity to purchase one, it's knocking right now with both the standalone console and Mario Kart World bundle discounted on eBay.\n\nIt's admittedly not a huge discount \u2013 the console and the bundle might is only down by 10%, but that\u2019s still a welcome saving for the fairly pricey piece of gaming kit. In fact, I\u2019d argue that the Nintendo Switch 2 represents one of the best ways to get into gaming at both the entry level and as a dedicated fan looking for a slim and portable handheld. It\u2019s the only place you\u2019ll be able to play Nintendo\u2019s latest and upcoming hits, and if you\u2019re a current Switch user, you\u2019ll be thrilled by the fact that it\u2019s backwards compatible with most games.\n\nTo make sure you get the discount across both deals, remember to enter the code RISE10 at the checkout, and you don't even need to be an eBay Plus member to take advantage of this offer.\n\nHaving received it on launch day, I fell in love with the Nintendo Switch 2 despite being someone who swears by PC gaming and his handy Steam Deck; even my six-year-old niece loves it whenever it take it up to her.\n\nThe Switch 2 offers such a seamless, problem-free solution for casual gaming, both on the go and when connected to a TV. It\u2019s underpinned by hardware improvements, such as frame rates of up to 120Hz, a bigger screen and a more powerful processor. Ultimately it\u2019s the modern revision that the original Switch needed, and it\u2019s a joy to play Nintendo\u2019s line-up of games exclusive to its consoles.\n\nOur Nintendo Switch 2 review had just as much praise, complimenting the console for its premium build, gorgeous display, noticeable performance improvements and backwards compatibility, though our reviewer wasn't impressed with the battery life, uninspired UI and tiny roster of launch games. That being said, Donkey Kong Bananza has since been released and is unarguably a game of the year contender.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to recommend the Nintendo Switch 2 as a casual gaming console for all ages. You do need to pay a subscription for online play (AU$29.95 per year for the standard plan, or AU$59.95 to get the Expansion Pack version), but you get some pretty sweet perks with your subscription, such as access to selected titles from Nintendo\u2019s massive catalogue of classic games from its older consoles, along with access to select expansion packs in certain games (such as Animal Crossing New Horizons and Splatoon 2).\n\nYou might also like...\n\u2022 Underrated Switch games 2025: the best titles you might have overlooked\n\u2022 The 16 best Nintendo Switch 2 games to play in 2025\n\u2022 Nintendo has filed a patent for a Joy-Con 2 attachment that seems to be a fishing reel, which sounds perfect for all you fishing game enthusiasts",

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 is an apt name for the company's latest console, as it is essentially a more powerful version of its predecessor. What\u2019s impressive, though, is just how much of an improvement over the original Switch it is. With support for 4K and 1440p resolutions as well as 120Hz in both docked and handheld play, Nintendo has successfully played catch-up with other contemporary consoles. Its 1080p vivid LCD screen is also immaculate, displaying titles with a clarity that you rarely see from other gaming handhelds. Battery life is a downgrade, however, and paired with some Bluetooth audio issues and a handful of issues with other features, there are definitely some teething issues at launch.\nPros\n- +\nPremium build\n- +\nGorgeous, vivid 1080p LCD display\n- +\nBlissfully smooth UI/UX\n- +\nA notable step up in game performance from its predecessor\n- +\nExcellent backward compatibility breathes new life into old games\nCons\n- -\nTerrible handheld battery life\n- -\nBluetooth audio has a significant delay\n- -\nUninspired user interface\n- -\nTiny launch game roster largely made up of ports\n- -\nGameChat is neat, but needs work\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nNintendo Switch 2: two-minute review\nAfter what felt like an eternity of waiting after all the leaks and eventual official announcement back in January 2025, the Nintendo Switch 2 is finally here.\nTo say the console\u2019s had a rough start is an understatement, though, with retail stock difficult to come by at this early stage. This, plus the console\u2019s relatively lofty price tag (as well as those of its games), means there are some folks seeking handheld gaming console alternatives.\nAt the time of writing, I\u2019ve had my Nintendo Switch 2 a couple of weeks, and I\u2019ve been spending each and every day playing its games and testing the hardware to rate its performance and assess any improvements over the original 2017 console.\nDespite the lack of ambition and innovation (at least compared to prior consoles like the Wii and Nintendo DS), I think Nintendo has produced an exceptional system here that finally realizes the full potential of the Switch concept.\nThe obvious upgrades, such as support for 4K and 1440p resolutions in docked mode and 120Hz capabilities (both in portable mode and docked on compatible displays) are extremely welcome, and move the Switch 2 a step closer to parity with its more powerful peers in the PS5 and Xbox Series X and S.\nOf course, the Switch 2 doesn\u2019t quite have the raw graphical prowess of those Sony and Microsoft-built machines, but it\u2019s not a million miles away, as we see with certain Nintendo Switch 2 ports like Street Fighter 6 or Cyberpunk 2077.\nOther display-oriented modernities are present here, too, such as HDR10 and VRR support (though, confusingly, variable refresh rate is currently only available in handheld play).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe former provides juicier contrast and richer colors on compatible displays, while the latter smooths out framerates for more stable performance.\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s fair to say that the Switch 2\u2019s launch game line-up is on the slighter side. Mario Kart World is great and an ideal title to have from day one, but a good chunk of launch day games have been ports of original Switch games or ones carried over from other platforms.\nWhile it is great to see big hitters like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom rock an extremely solid 4K/60fps on Switch 2, it hasn\u2019t been the most fulsome launch if you\u2019re coming at it from a strictly first-party point of view.\nThankfully, the Switch 2 breathes life into original Switch titles via impressive backwards compatibility. I\u2019ll delve more into this in its own section, but I\u2019ve seen monumental results playing some of my own Switch favorites on the new console \u2013 some of which Nintendo itself hasn\u2019t even officially mentioned.\nThere are some downsides worth talking about, of course. For one, battery life is sorely lacking in handheld mode and feels like an abject downgrade compared to the original Switch models.\nI also clocked some very noticeable audio delay with multiple gaming headsets and earbuds via Bluetooth connection. Furthermore, the skeleton of the original Switch is still present in many ways, with an almost identical Home dashboard, a lack of customization, and the ongoing threat of drift prevailing in the new Joy-Con 2 controllers.\nStill, the Switch 2 is an accomplished bit of kit, and one that provides a night and day upgrade over its eight-year-old predecessor. I\u2019m definitely looking forward to its game library expanding, as well as the system itself receiving various quality-of-life upgrades via future firmware updates.\nNintendo Switch 2: price and availability\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 went on sale on June 5, 2025. The console by itself costs $449.99 / \u00a3395.99 / AU$699.95. There is also an official bundle that packs in a digital copy of Mario Kart World alongside the console for $499.99 / \u00a3429.99 / AU$769.95. Some US and UK retailers have also stocked their own bundles, often throwing in an extra pair of Joy-Con 2 controllers or Nintendo Switch Online subscription time, but you can expect to pay a premium for these.\nPrice-wise, though, the Nintendo Switch 2 (while certainly more expensive than its predecessor) falls about in line with similar contemporary handheld gaming devices, including the original Steam Deck ($399 / \u00a3349 / AU$649) and the Asus ROG Ally ($549.99 / \u00a3449 / AU$999). Premium devices like the Steam Deck OLED and ROG Ally X are even more expensive, positioning the Switch 2 at a relatively mid-range price point among gaming handhelds, but certainly on the more affordable side within the space.\nIn terms of home consoles, the Switch 2 does come in cheaper than the PS5 ($499.99 / \u00a3479.99 / AU$799.95) and lands in the same ballpark as the PS5 Digital Edition ($399.99 / \u00a3389.99 / AU$649.95). It\u2019s also comparable in price to the Xbox Series X Digital Edition ($449.99 / \u00a3429.99 / AU$699).\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Nintendo Switch 2 stock has been an ongoing issue since the pre-order phase. At launch, it\u2019s been incredibly difficult to purchase a Switch 2 at retail, and flashes of stock in all major regions come and go in an instant. However, this was also the case with the original Switch and competing systems like the PS5. In both cases, stock became much more plentiful in the months after launch, so I\u2019m hoping the same is true for Nintendo\u2019s latest.\nNintendo Switch 2: specs\nPrice | $429.99 / \u00a3395.99 / AU$699.95 |\nWeight | 1.18lbs / 535g (with Joy-Con 2 attached) |\nDimensions | 10.7 x 4.5 x 0.6in / 272 x 114 x 15mm |\nStorage capacity | 256GB internal |\nStorage expansion | microSD Express |\nConnectivity | WiFi 6, ethernet, Bluetooth |\nDisplay | Vivid LCD |\nResolution (docked) | Up to 4K |\nResolution (handheld) | Up to 1080p |\nGPU | Custom Nvidia processor |\nCPU | Custom Nvidia processor |\nBattery life | 2-5 hours |\nPorts | 2 x USB, 1 x HDMI, 1 x LAN, 2 x USB-C, 1 x 3.5mm headphone jack |\nNintendo Switch 2: design and build quality\nWhat\u2019s most striking about the Nintendo Switch 2 out of the box is its look and build quality improvements over its predecessor. The console looks distinctly less toy-like, largely helped by an overall sleeker design and the ditching of the original Joy-Con\u2019s neon red/blue aesthetic.\nSome may lament the loss of whimsy, and that\u2019s fair enough. But it nonetheless stands out amongst the busy gaming handheld crowd. The Switch 2, despite its increased size, remains impressively slim. In fact, it\u2019s just as thin as the original Switch, and importantly, lacks the bulk of the likes of the Steam Deck OLED and ROG Ally X. This means that even though it is bigger thanks to the larger display size, it remains an eminently portable console.\nThough I would recommend investing in a carry case if you\u2019re planning on taking your Switch 2 out and about. While it\u2019s undoubtedly sturdier than the Switch, it\u2019s still prone to the same environmental wear and tear of any handheld system.\nThe Switch 2 dock has also seen a size increase, but for good reason. This time, the dock houses an internal fan to help keep the unit cool during lengthy play sessions. Thankfully, the dock is still small enough to fit into even the most compact gaming spaces. Whether that be on a TV stand or your computer desk, or elsewhere, you should have little issue incorporating your Switch 2 into a docked setup. The dock also houses two USB ports, one ethernet port, and a HDMI slot for use on TVs or gaming monitors.\nAs for the handheld itself, there\u2019s a lot to go over in terms of design. The unit now houses two USB-C ports - one on the top and the other at the bottom. Next to each port are sets of speakers. At the top, you\u2019ll also find the power and volume buttons, as well as the game card slot, 3.5mm headphone jack, and a built-in microphone.\nThe Switch 2\u2019s kickstand is a huge improvement. The 2017 model had a simple stub kickstand on one side, which felt extremely rigid. The Switch OLED did widen this design idea, but it wasn\u2019t much better overall. On Switch 2, the kickstand has been entirely redesigned. It spans almost the entire length of the handheld and can be rotated to a much greater degree. This allows for greater freedom with how you place your Switch 2 on a surface for tabletop play.\nAnother massive improvement comes in how the Joy-Con 2 controllers attach to the handheld. Instead of the original Switch\u2019s rigid rail system, the Switch 2 opts for a magnetic connection. As such, the Joy-Con 2 click into place seamlessly and instantaneously. You can also easily pop them back out by pushing in a button housed just underneath the ZL/ZR trigger buttons.\nOne last thing to note is that the Switch 2 is impressively lightweight. At just 1.18lbs (535g), it\u2019s only marginally heavier than the original Switch, which was 0.88lbs (399g), and the Switch OLED\u2019s 0.93lbs (422g). Admittedly, I was expecting something much heavier before my hands-on preview some months ago, but I remain pleasantly surprised by the Switch 2\u2019s slimness. And when compared to the bulkier Steam Deck OLED\u2019s 1.41lbs (640g), playing with Switch 2 in bed or on the go is less strenuous overall.\nNintendo Switch 2: display\nUnlike the namesake screen of the Switch OLED, Nintendo has opted for an LCD display for the Switch 2. This may come across as a downgrade on paper, but in reality, the move back to LCD has its own advantages. For one, LCD is less prone to screen burn-in than OLED, allowing for a panel that should last longer.\nFurthermore, Nintendo has still managed to ensure that your games still look crisp and vividly colorful during portable play. Nintendo describes its display as \u2018Vivid LCD,\u2019 and it\u2019s an accurate description to say the least. The display supports HDR10, meaning games that support this screen tech (like Super Mario Odyssey and the upcoming Metroid Prime 4: Beyond) can be just as eye-poppingly colorful on the handheld as they would be on a larger OLED panel.\nThis 1080p screen also supports VRR (variable refresh rate), helping demanding games maintain a smooth framerate and helping 120Hz-compatible titles meet that target. At launch, there aren\u2019t many games that benefit from the Switch 2 screen\u2019s 120Hz capability, though Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is confirmed to have a 1080p performance mode that targets this high refresh rate. It\u2019s bound to look stunning on the handheld that already has a native 1080p resolution.\nOf course, there will be times when you won\u2019t want to make use of HDR10, perhaps in order to save battery or to have a play experience that\u2019s less demanding on the eyes. Nintendo has thankfully thought of this, and there are options in the settings menu to disable HDR entirely or to only enable it for true HDR-compatible games.\nIn my testing, I have no complaints when it comes to the Switch 2\u2019s display. It is a monumental upgrade over the original\u2019s 720p LCD screen. The jump to 1080p helps both Switch 2 and OG Switch games look incredibly sharp. Even titles that utilize a dynamic resolution in handheld mode - like Bayonetta 3 and Astral Chain - are better able to meet this target thanks to the increased power of the Switch 2.\nNintendo Switch 2: user interface and settings\nThe Switch 2\u2019s Home dashboard is a disappointment at first glance. In fact, you might not be able to tell it apart from the original console\u2019s menu if it weren\u2019t for the rounded edges applied to game icons on the Switch 2. It\u2019s still aggressively bland, then, and you\u2019ve still only got the choice between two basic white and black themes, but there have been some key improvements worth talking about.\nThe big thing to make note of is performance. Issues with the glacial input delay are practically nonexistent now, and nowhere is this more apparent than the revamped Nintendo eShop. There\u2019s a completely new user interface here, and items are organized much more cleanly and smartly than before. And while, yes, you still won\u2019t be escaping the mountains of genAI shovelware when looking through the deals section, I\u2019d still argue that the eShop now is a good deal more responsive than even the PlayStation and Microsoft Stores.\nOver to System Settings, then, and you\u2019ll find much of what was available on the original Switch. On Switch 2, there are plenty more options to take advantage of the hardware\u2019s new features. These include setting TV output to 1440p or 4K, fine-tuning HDR, as well as preventing your system from topping up its battery all the way to full in order to help the battery last longer in the years to come. A similar option is common with best iPhones and best Android smartphones, so it\u2019s nice to see it here on a portable gaming device.\nNintendo Switch 2: audio\nOne important addition to the Nintendo Switch 2 is the implementation of a bespoke surround sound system, supported by the speakers on both the top and bottom of the handheld.\nWhat impressed me the most here was the surprising level of audio quality when not using a pair of headphones in handheld mode. The speakers are significantly less tinny than the original Switch (though that did also see an improvement with the OLED model), and they provide surprisingly clear audio for such a compact device.\nThe speakers work great for a wide range of games, whether that\u2019s the vast immersive soundscape of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom or the infectiously catchy tunes of Splatoon 3. Even older NES and SNES games that are playable via Nintendo Switch Online benefit, with their simpler melodies coming through with great clarity.\nBluetooth support is where the Switch 2 falters in the audio department. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you\u2019re still getting strong surround sound support here. But with the gaming headsets and earbuds I tested - including the RIG 900 Max HS and the Nothing Ear (a) earbuds - there was a very noticeable audio delay of around half a second. This was the case in both docked and handheld modes, though it was certainly more pronounced with the latter.\nOn that note, I\u2019d recommend hooking up a pair of wired headphones via the 3.5mm jack. In this case, I tested my Razer BlackShark V2 headphones, and audio came through crystal clear without a hint of delay.\nNintendo Switch 2: Performance\nNow, overall gaming performance is where the Nintendo Switch 2 really impresses. At least at this early stage in the console\u2019s life, the notion of poor framerates and heavily compromised Nintendo Switch ports seems to be a thing of the past.\nNintendo\u2019s own output has thus far been stellar on this front. Mario Kart World runs at a clean 1440p while docked (1080p on the handheld) at a solid 60 frames per second (fps) at all times. That\u2019s especially impressive given the series\u2019 shift to a vibrant open world.\nHowever, I was even more surprised by some of the console\u2019s ports. Street Fighter 6, for example (while slightly worse off in terms of image quality with some noticeable graining), runs superbly at 60fps both online and offline. The marquee single-player World Tour mode does take some hits with battles being locked to 30fps, but that\u2019s the only real blemish on this otherwise exceptional port.\nThe one major downside to all this is the Switch 2\u2019s shockingly poor battery life. In handheld mode, Nintendo itself estimates that you can get anywhere between two to six and a half hours. However, in all my testing, I simply didn\u2019t find this to be the case. Of course, more demanding titles will drain the battery a good deal more, but even with original Switch games, I struggled to get more than three hours at full charge. And yes, that\u2019s even after bypassing the bug where the console thinks it\u2019s got around 10% less battery life than what it actually has.\nEven when playing less demanding titles, such as side-scrollers or Nintendo Switch Online (NSO) retro games, battery life struggles. You can, of course, mitigate things by turning down the console\u2019s brightness and disabling HDR for certain games, but this does come at the cost of overall image clarity.\nI\u2019d say, at a push, you can get around five hours tops with less visually demanding games, after testing titles like Hollow Knight, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S, and numerous Switch Online classic titles. Heck, even idling on the Home dashboard seems to drain the battery at an alarming clip, so do make sure to keep your console in standby when you\u2019re out and about and it\u2019s not in use.\nNintendo Switch 2: Backwards compatibility\nNintendo Switch 2\u2019s backwards compatibility is - in a word - excellent. Particularly when it comes to running and playing original Switch games. Firstly, most Switch games at a baseline level benefit from Switch 2\u2019s faster internal storage. That means you can expect games to boot and load scenes much faster on average.\nFor example, booting Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition took me from the Home dashboard to the in-game menu in around 4 seconds. Then, from the menu to in-game was roughly 10 seconds. It\u2019s a similar story with Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, which loads into a match in literally less than 3 seconds. Another standout example is Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition, which I\u2019ve already written about as being one of my favorite Switch 2 experiences so far, despite being an original Switch title. In the main story mode, the game transitioned from level selection to loading to gameplay in, again, around 3 or 4 seconds.\nMany Switch games also benefit from an increase in image quality and overall performance, not just games that have received paid Nintendo Switch 2 Editions. The standout example here is Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet. Most would agree that the original Switch release was a mess, with horrific image quality and choppy animations. On Switch 2, the game has been transformed, rocking a solid 60fps and targeting 4K while docked and 1080p on the handheld. Now, the game\u2019s overall art style still does feel a bit flat, but with its key performance issues solved on Switch 2, it\u2019s now well worth playing, as it\u2019s still a fine Pok\u00e9mon adventure.\nAnother game that benefits is, again, Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition. That game originally had an uncapped framerate, meaning the Switch 2 is able to brute force a 60fps performance at all times. Image quality in handheld mode is also sublime, with the game sporting a 1080p output and no longer needing to downsample to 720p to fit the original Switch display. If you know of any other OG Switch titles with uncapped framerates, definitely give them a try on Switch 2, as the results may surprise you.\nNintendo Switch 2: Joy-Con 2\nNow onto the Switch 2\u2019s pack-in controllers - the Joy-Con 2. And again, we find a pretty sizable improvement over the previous model in some ways. Their overall design is much sleeker, and they\u2019re slightly rounder than the original Joy-Con controllers. Their larger size also makes them much more comfortable to play with for longer sessions - even when sharing an individual Joy-Con 2 with a pal for co-op play.\nThe big addition here is mouse controls, which are supported by certain titles, including Civilization 7 and Cyberpunk 2077. Mouse controls can also be used to navigate the Switch 2\u2019s Home dashboard and Nintendo eShop (though the lack of a scroll wheel does hurt things a little here). It\u2019s a very smart implementation, and performance is extremely smooth with no unnecessary acceleration. You can even adjust mouse sensitivity in the System Settings menu and in supported games.\nIt is worth mentioning that there have already been reports of Joy-Con 2 controllers suffering from stick drift, and the sticks themselves appear to have the same design as the originals.\nThis is a huge shame and a big disappointment, as one of my biggest concerns before launch was the lack of improvements in this regard. Nintendo does offer a free repair and replacement service for Joy-Con 2 controllers suffering from stick drift, but I\u2019d obviously prefer a Hall effect solution in order to avoid this issue entirely.\nNintendo Switch 2: GameChat\nFinally, Nintendo has a true party voice chat solution built into one of its consoles. While numerous titles on the original Switch supported voice chat via the official Nintendo Switch Online app, chatting with friends this way was nothing short of awful - often thanks to forced disconnections between matches and low-quality audio.\nSo, is GameChat a decent alternative to the likes of Discord? Well, yes and no. GameChat obviously takes great inspiration from the world\u2019s leading group chat software. Audio quality via the Switch 2\u2019s built-in mic is surprisingly clear, and headset microphones are also supported. It is objectively a big improvement over Nintendo\u2019s prior efforts.\nThe problems come with its implementation. Namely, shrinking the game screen down in order to display your friends\u2019 Switch 2 profile icons. This seems needless, especially when not using the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera accessory, not to mention the fact that GameChat adds massive black borders around your game screen. Discord already solved this with its simple and effective overlay that maintains image resolution while displaying profile icons off to the side in a semi-transparent manner.\nGood news - the potential issue we identified with GameChat compressing your game's live feed has been accounted for. If you head to the settings within GameChat, you'll see you have two further display options; Extend Main Screen and Fullscreen. The former shrinks the GameChat UI, and the latter removes your friends' icons entirely, instead showing a small overlay in the lower right-hand corner with the name of whoever is currently speaking.\nGameChat isn\u2019t lacking ambition, though, and there are some neat ideas here. For example, being able to see your friends\u2019 game screens is a novel idea, and a neat way of translating split-screen play in an online space. The problem, again, is the execution of it. Your friends\u2019 displays are rendered at an uncomfortably low framerate, to the point where it can actually be quite distracting.\nI hope Nintendo continues to improve the GameChat service going forward and flesh it out with more customizable options, because it is a handy thing to have for party chat with friends online, and it does have some neat ideas of its own. But for now, I would still recommend setting up a chat with friends via Discord.\nShould I buy the Nintendo Switch 2?\nBuy it if...\nYou want a night and day upgrade over the original Switch\nSimply put, the Nintendo Switch 2 is the Switch\u2019s vision fully realized. An astronomical performance improvement, paired with superb load times and a crisp 1080p display, arguably makes it the definitive gaming handheld.\nYou already have a decent-sized Switch game collection\nYour original Switch games play better than ever on Switch 2. While not all benefit from image quality and performance improvements, those that do have never been better. Plus, most games do benefit from the console\u2019s snappier load times.\nYou want a handheld gaming device that\u2019s genuinely portable\nWhile larger than the original Switch, it remains just as thin. If you\u2019re put off by the bulk of the Steam Deck in particular, then the Switch 2 is an excellent portable alternative if you like to game while out and about.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou\u2019re waiting on more first-party games\nNintendo\u2019s own launch roster for the Switch 2 is very slim. If Mario Kart World isn\u2019t your bag, and you\u2019re not too keen on playing some of these Switch 2 Edition games again, I\u2019d say it\u2019s best to hold off until the game library improves.\nYou want a gaming handheld that\u2019ll go the distance, battery-wise\nThe Switch 2\u2019s battery life is incredibly poor. And while battery packs do exist to extend portable playtime, these do have the unfortunate side effect of bulking up the console. If you\u2019re a frequent flyer or regularly find yourself on long commutes, the Switch 2\u2019s battery life might let you down.\nAlso consider...\nIf the Nintendo Switch 2 isn\u2019t quite for you, or if you simply can\u2019t find stock for the currently hard-to-get console, here are a couple of alternatives that might better suit your preferences.\n| Row 0 - Cell 0 | Nintendo Switch 2 | Steam Deck OLED | Asus ROG Ally X |\nPrice | $429.99 / \u00a3395.99 / AU$699.95 | $549 / \u00a3479 (around AU$849) | $799.99 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,599 |\nWeight | 1.18lbs / 535g | 1.41lbs / 640g | 1.49lbs / 678g |\nDimensions | 10.7 x 4.5 x 0.6in / 272 x 114 x 15mm | 11.7 x 4.6 x 1.9in / 298 x 117 x 49mm | 11 x 4.5 x 1.5in / 280.2 x 114 x 37mm |\nStorage capacity | 256GB internal | 512GB NVMe SSD | 1TB M.2 2280 SSD |\nStorage expansion | microSD Express | microSD | microSD |\nConnectivity | WiFi 6, ethernet, Bluetooth | Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3 | Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2 |\nDisplay | 7.9in Vivid LCD | 7.4in OLED | 7-inch FHD |\nResolution | 4K docked, 1080p handheld | 1080p | 1080p |\nCPU | Custom Nvidia processor | AMD Zen 2 four core 2.4-3.5GHz | AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme |\nGPU | Custom Nvidia processor | AMD RDNA 2 | AMD Radeon Graphics |\nBattery life | 2-5 hours | 2-3 hours | Around 8 hours |\nPorts | 2 x USB, 1 x HDMI, 1 x LAN, 2 x USB-C, 1 x 3.5mm headphone jack | 1 x USB-C, 3.5mm headphone jack, microSD | 2x USB-C, 1 x combo jack, 1 x SD card reader slot |\nSteam Deck OLED\nValve\u2019s premium gaming handheld is impressively customizable, supporting your entire Steam library as well as third-party apps and emulators. The OLED screen is a real treat, too. Just be prepared for some Steam games not being perfectly compatible with the handheld, and expect some performance hits for the more demanding titles.\nRead our full Steam Deck OLED review\nAsus ROG Ally X\nA performance powerhouse and decent battery life position the Asus ROG Ally X as a seriously tempting gaming handheld. While still not quite up to spec with gaming laptops and Windows 11 not being the best fit as an operating system, it\u2019s nonetheless a superb way to play Steam, Xbox Game Pass, GOG titles, and more.\nRead our full Asus ROG Ally X review\nNintendo Switch OLED\nIt does belong to the original Switch family, meaning it\u2019s certainly not packing the power of the Switch 2. But still, the OLED is still a worthwhile and more affordable alternative, and packs a gorgeous 7-inch OLED display.\nRead our full Nintendo Switch OLED review\nHow I tested the Nintendo Switch 2\nI tested the Nintendo Switch 2 for just over two weeks for this review. In docked mode, I played on a 4K-capable LG CX OLED TV, but I also split my time evenly between docked and handheld play. My picks for controllers during my testing were the Joy-Con 2, Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller, and the wireless Nintendo GameCube Controller for use with the new GameCube classics library via Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack.\nMy testing also involved playing a whole bunch of Switch 2 and original Switch games. These include Mario Kart World, Street Fighter 6, Yakuza 0: Director\u2019s Cut, Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, Deltarune, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition, and Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition.\nI also compared the Switch 2\u2019s gaming performance to that of the base PS5 and the Switch OLED. While it does lack the sheer power of the former, it\u2019s not too far off the mark as we see with some of the Switch 2\u2019s excellent ports. And in the case of the latter, it\u2019s no contest, and I found it exceptionally hard to revisit my older Switch especially when the new system is almost fully backwards compatible.\nFor audio, I mostly relied on the Switch 2 handheld\u2019s in-built speakers, but tested headset audio with the RIG 900 Max HS, Nothing Ear (a) earbuds, and the Razer BlackShark V2 gaming headset.\nRhys is TRG's Hardware Editor, and has been part of the TechRadar team for over four years.

The attachment also seems to feature a second button for pressing the console's right shoulder (SR).\nPresumably, this attachment could be used for a range of games with fishing mechanics like Animal Crossing: New Horizons, or a potential Kuru Kuru Kururin revival and Playdate ports, as Nintendo Patents Watch theorized.\nA totally new game for the Switch 2 that Nintendo has yet to announce is also a possibility.\nAlthough the patent application was published recently, it was filed in February 2024, suggesting that Nintendo has been working on the new accessory for some time, with Switch 2 compatibility in mind. That said, it is worth keeping in mind that not all patents see the light of day as an official product.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nIn case you missed it, the latest Nintendo Indie World Showcase for August 2025 was jam-packed with announcements. While there was no Hollow Knight: Silksong news, there were plenty of other indie reveals, including a new game from the Shovel Knight creators, several metroidvania-style titles, and more.\nYou might also like...\n- Donkey Kong Bananza is a must-have Nintendo Switch 2 game and worthy Super Mario Odyssey successor\n- The Nintendo Switch 2 is the company\u2019s least ambitious console to date, but its improvements are astronomical\n- I\u2019ve spent 150 hours with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and the Switch 2 Edition is an incredible upgrade\nDemi is a freelance games journalist for TechRadar Gaming.

      "text": "I might be a Steam Deck fanatic, but I can\u2019t deny the Nintendo Switch 2 is still the king of easy, fun gaming\nThere are some things more important than open-source tech\nI love everything about the Steam Deck. It's a (mostly) open-source console with the ability to launch (but not necessarily run) all games on the Steam platform, and it became the perfect companion to my gaming PC when I first bought it. However, it wasn\u2019t until my first week with the Nintendo Switch 2 that I was reminded why I liked handheld games to begin with.\nThere\u2019s nothing overwhelmingly new about the Nintendo Switch 2. Yes, the console is considerably more powerful than the original device that launched in 2017, with a larger screen, more comfortable controllers and an overall better design, but it also didn\u2019t need its own show-stopping new feature. Nintendo\u2019s world of gaming is unique and unmatched, tapping into aspects (portability, couch co-op-ability and a strong focus on first-party games) that leaves any other company, at best, hopelessly behind.\nIt\u2019s why the argument over whether or not the Steam Deck will stand a chance against the Switch 2 makes me groan. It's of no importance. It's not worth caring about. They might be similar devices overall, but they have different intentions in the games space.\nWhat does matter is making your experience unique \u2013 and the Nintendo Switch 2 is far-reaching in its distinctiveness, making for both the perfect gadget when entertaining my niece or the ideal party trick when hanging out with friends.\nYou should read our in-depth Nintendo Switch 2 review if you\u2019re more interested in the specs, performance and features. I\u2019m here to tell you why I like the console.\nSwitch it up\nMy lovely niece Zoey is five years old \u2013 she\u2019s hyperactive and a terror, constantly running around and yelling, excited about little things and bored with boring things. She\u2019s the world to me.\nAnd being her only uncle, there\u2019s a lot of responsibility placed upon me! My brother and his fiance are constantly exhausted by Zoey\u2019s antics, so I\u2019m put on \u2018Zoey duty\u2019 whenever I\u2019m in town or when they come to visit. She\u2019s lovely \u2013 but she gets bored easily.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nFor a long time, the best gizmo I had for keeping Zoey preoccupied was my Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra \u2013 its integrated S Pen stylus and well maintained first-party PENUP app offer countless hours of drawing fun for a little kid.\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 strikes the same niche. Pulling the console out at a family event on the weekend, Zoey\u2019s restlessness was quickly brought under control once I introduced her to the new Mario Kart World. Sure, she's part of this new generation of kids that have been first introduced to Mario through the 2023 Illumination film, but like the Galaxy S Pen, there's an instant appeal to kids when the gadget is so tactile, and you can physically touch and interact with it in a really cool way.\nSimilarly, the ability to whip the console out both in the office, on a meeting room TV, or at a party and have friends play on it effortlessly using the removable controllers is such a boon. It\u2019s the best console to have when playing with people in person, and its compact form allows you to take it anywhere.\nEven without the deck, the new Joy-Cons are sufficiently large that they\u2019re no longer too uncomfortable when held horizontally. The display is larger, brighter and more clear than the original Switch too, making splitscreen gameplay on the console alone much more enjoyable.\nThe whole motion of snapping out a magnetically-attached Joy-Con to go head-to-head with a friend in person is infinitely more thrilling than whipping out a much smaller game on your phone, or even a high-performance game on your Steam Deck, and playing on your own. It\u2019s a tactile difference and, with its performance improvements across the board, the Switch 2 aces the assignment.\nI can\u2019t be won over with everything\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 is a pretty well-rounded console that knows exactly what it\u2019s trying to do, but there are issues here. The main one is the price \u2013 the high cost of the Switch 2 is, in a word, inaccessible to many folks, and the lack of any tangible difference to the original console would leave many preferring to save money.\nThough the console is noticeably bigger this time around, with a larger display than even the Steam Deck\u2019s (yet a smaller overall size), it\u2019s still a bit uncomfortable for adult hands in its standard handheld mode. The bumper buttons in particular feel just a tad too big and have often led to accidental presses during my use.\nOn this note, the ability for the Switch\u2019s Joy-Cons to quickly turn into wireless mice for more precise gameplay at a desk or table, utilising sensors down the side to track the Joy-Con\u2019s movement as it slides across the table, feels like one of the biggest jumps in recent first-party gaming hardware. My only criticism is that it\u2019s limited by the same issues as when holding the console in handheld mode \u2013 it\u2019s a bit awkward for bigger hands. Thankfully the Switch 2 supports third party mice.\nHaving most of my gaming on PC, I\u2019m also massively against subscription services for online play, but this is likely a non-issue for many, given that there are many other great bonuses to be had with Nintendo Switch Online.\nBut my biggest point of criticism remains the dock \u2013 the thing I liked the least about the original Switch. I get that it\u2019s supposed to be big to support console play at home, but for my use case, I would like a more portable solution for projecting to a TV at a friend or family member\u2019s home. Surely all of the internal components can be condensed into a smaller form factor, just as we saw with third-party Switch accessories after 2017? This would be a massive boon to me, as lugging the sizable dock around solely for the ability to project onto a TV is kind of annoying.\nOn gaming and identity\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 is the ultimate social console. That I can entertain my niece for hours on end with this gadget, playing games in a more portable form than any alternative console, is so cosmically important to me that I can\u2019t help but love this quirky, multi-purpose handheld. That I can show up to a house party of introverts and have buckets of fun is of similar importance.\nIn 2025, there are alternatives for dedicated gamers after greater performance. The Steam Deck most prominently (particularly for how it too can be used as a co-op console, albeit less. elegantly without removable Joy-Cons), but even the PlayStation Portal can be regarded as a decent in-home handheld.\nBut none of these will ever achieve the all-encompassing brilliance of the Nintendo Switch 2. Try as Microsoft might with its latest console, the \u2018ROG Xbox Ally X\u2019, a name so comically bad that only Xbox and Asus could have come up with it, it\u2019ll never be this.\nThese handheld consoles, while cool and capable of great gameplay, lack the physical appeal that makes the Switch 2 so brilliant in the first place. Nintendo has mastered the balance between hardware and software to make different modes of play quickly achievable, without annoying OS difficulties (like in former Windows-based handhelds), streaming reliance (like the Portal and cloud-based services) and bulky hardware tradeoffs (like when pairing controllers with the Steam Deck). Rather than spend a couple of minutes pairing controllers to the Deck, for example, the Switch 2 only requires a split-second detaching of a Joy-Con. It's seamless.\nIt\u2019s an expensive console, no doubt about it, but the Nintendo Switch 2 has taken the mantle of the best casual console on the market \u2013 while also catering to more dedicated gamers too. It\u2019s easy to love, but if you can\u2019t afford it (or justify the high price), then I would highly recommend still picking up either the original Switch or the Switch OLED, as they continue to provide a sufficiently capable family gaming experience.\nYou might also like...\nZac has been in the tech writing game for six years, having previously written for Gizmodo Australia, Canstar Blue, and The Daily Mail Australia (with articles on Nine, Junkee, Kotaku Australia and Lifehacker Australia).

      "text": "Underrated Switch games 2025: the best titles you might have overlooked\nFrom fairytale epics to strategy-based visual novels\nWe've now gotten our hands on Nintendo Switch 2, and have been busy testing it out since launch. We've put a final score on the new hardware as part of TechRadar Gaming's Nintendo Switch 2 review, praising the gorgeous LCD screen, while taking slight issue with the underwhelming battery life. Plenty of Switch 2 games have also had reviews published, the highlight being the Mario Kart World review, which evaluates Nintendo's launch exclusive.\nWith how many games there are available on the Nintendo Switch, there are probably a few underrated Switch games that have slipped past your radar. Frankly, it comes as no surprise - especially with how many big-ticket first-party releases the system has seen as of late. But if you're looking for the next adventure, we've got you covered.\nThe best Nintendo Switch games in 2025 make the handheld hybrid console worth buying, even several years after its release, but the underrated titles are what make your experience with it so unforgettable. Fortunately, we've saved you the task of sifting through the eShop to see what you can find and compiled all the games we would consider worth playing here.\nOur list contains a variety of genres and themes so that even among the many underrated Nintendo Switch games, you can find one that sounds good to you. Whether it's strategy, a metroidvania, or an action game you're after, we've got the games for you.\nUnderrated Switch games 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"Fans for more than a decade have yearned for a return to the traditional RPG-style and originality that helped propel the first two games to a level the series has yet to reclaim. And though The Origami King doesn't quite hit those levels or even reinstate the previous beloved mechanics altogether, it's a worthy addition and the best Paper Mario since The Thousand Year Door.\" - Matt Poskitt, TechRadar gaming reviewer.\nPaper Mario: The Origami King is often overshadowed by the more recent Thousand Year Door remake. This is a shame, as it's a brilliant entry into the cult RPG series, one full of humor and wacky charm. The combat is a particular highlight, mixing jumping action with a tile-based puzzle element. As you progress, you unlock new abilities, and ways to change the board to your advantage. Story-wise, there's just so much to love about The Origami King too, and it's easily one of the funniest Switch games available in 2025.\nAs Mario, you can grow long paper-arms to manipulate the world around you. It's always fun to do, and really gives the game a strong design aesthetic, and a unique sense of character. Bosses each introduce new puzzle elements, and you'll really feel powered up by the time you reach the end credits. While it's not the best in the series, Paper Mario: The Origami King is a great starting point, given its slightly easier difficulty curve.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"Even with no prior experience of the Rune Factory series, Guardians of Azuma is a relaxing blend of genres that works in part due to the wholesome nature of its cast and setting. It\u2019s chicken soup on a rainy day - uncomplicated, but unmistakably enjoyable.\" - Lloyd Coombes, TechRadar Gaming reviewer.\nRune Factory: Guardians of Azuma combines the cosiness of a farming sim with JRPG combat and exploration. It's a winning formula that's perfect for handheld play on Nintendo Switch. As you move from village to village, you'll grow crops, establish homes that'll help bolster the action-RPG side of things.\nDifferent villages are better suited for different crops, and as you build up several of them, you'll fall into a rhythm of visiting each in an order of your choosing. It really comes together at this point, and it can be very difficult to put down once this addictive loop is established.\nCombat is relatively simple, focusing on hack and slash action, with party members chipping in every now and then to help deal damage. Weapons each feel distinct, and the bow is a real highlight. Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma is perfect for those looking for a relaxing adventure, with all of the moreishness of a farming simulator.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"Kirby and the Forgotten Land is a joyful family platformer for those who like gawking at cute, cuddly characters. It\u2019s the children\u2019s ball pit of Nintendo games, with every sharp corner padded over and every surface painted the colors of the rainbow. But that adorability is matched by its ambition. This is the boldest Kirby game yet, pushing the pink puffball into all manner of new dimensions and contorted shapes. For the most part, it works fabulously.\" - Callum Baines, TechRadar Gaming reviewer.\nKirby games tend to get overshadowed by their much more famous peers (Mario, Link, I'm looking at you), which is a real shame, as they're often filled with brilliant ideas, and stuffed to the brim with personality. Kirby and the Forgotten Lands is a great example of this, with deceptively simple combat and traversal that evolves and deepens as the game goes on. This is definitely not the game you may expect it to be on first blush, and it's well worth checking out.\nAs you make your way through the mysterious ruins of human civilization, you'll use Kirby's inhale ability to steal abilities from enemies. Every now and then, Kirby can even wrap his adorable chops around larger objects, like cars and vending machines, leading to some genuinely hilarious bits of slapstick action. Eventually, you'll be taking on bosses, performing dodges and going in for slow-motion attacks, and chaining together special moves. All of this action builds slowly over the course of the story, escalating with each level, and culminating in one heck of a final battle.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"While Mario & Luigi: Brothership doesn\u2019t reinvent the wheel, it\u2019s a solid RPG with fun mechanics and lovable characters. New additions like Luigi Logic and Plugs make for satisfying combat, while overworld exploration benefits from the new Bros Moves and ample puzzles with a decent amount of variety.\" - Josephine Watson, Tech Radar reviewer.\nIn terms of Nintendo franchises, the Mario RPGs are some of the best, but most frequently overlooked. This is a real shame, given that over the years, Mario RPGs have continued to impress, with the latest being a great continuation of the joyful stories the series is known for. Mario & Luigi: Brothership launching right at the tail end of the Nintendo Switch's lifetime was perhaps the main reason it seems to have gone under the radar, but rest assured, it's well worth your time.\nIn their latest adventure, the mustachio'd brothers are whisked away to the land of Concordia and on a quest to reunite its fragmented lands following the destruction of the Unitree that once connected them. It\u2019s a tale with a strong narrative theme; that the bonds between friends, family, and even foes have innate power. In classic Nintendo style, every possible aspect of the game centers itself around its morals to charming effect. Don't let this one pass you by.\n\"Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown paints a picture of sustainable development as it infuses all the thrills of a modern AAA release into a smaller package. Heavy on ideas and experiments, this is top-notch.\" - Jake Tucker, TechRadar Gaming reviewer.\nPrince of Persia: The Lost Crown came out at the start of 2024, and as a result, it's been somewhat overlooked in GOTY discussions so far. It's metroidvania, more side-scrolling design is perhaps another reason that many skipped the game, though we'd recommend you absolutely make the time to play it.\nNew Prince Sargon is a brilliant character, possessing a whole host of new skills, as well as some familiar one, that stack up to make him a real blast to control. This, paired with excellent boss battles, a great parry system, and some smart twists on the Metroidvania genre make Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown a must-play on Nintendo Switch.\n12. Tchia\n\"This is a wholesome open-world exploration game that's heavy on discovery. It tells a surprisingly deep story, while giving players a toy chest of tools to navigate its beautiful island setting. You'll laugh, cry, and learn a lot about island living along the way, as you journey through swamps, jungles, and across the sea.\" - Jake Green, TechRadar Gaming Contributor.\nTchia is a real hidden gem on Nintendo Switch, for lovers of open-world exploration. You play as Tchia, a little girl on a quest to save her father from evil forces. To complete her quest, Tchia must explore a vast, lush, island environment, based on New Caledonia: a tiny island in the Pacific Ocean.\nAs you sail around the archipelagos, you'll use Tchia's Soul Jumping powers to possess animals, and even inanimate objects like coconut. Take control of dolphins and dart quickly across the ocean, hitch a ride with birds of paradise and reach new heights and fire coconuts at enemies to break down encampments.\nThere's a real love for the island's inspired setting that permeates throughout Tchia. The game is voiced by local talent in traditional languages, and there's plenty of in-game lore to teach you about some of the customs and traditions you'll find in a world like Tchia's. Jump in and explore, customize your boat, and learn new powers as you work to make the region a better place for the people and animals that live in it.\n11. Dungeon of the Endless\nSet in the same universe as Endless Space 1 and 2, Dungeon of the Endless is a roguelike that has you making your way through a crashed spaceship full of prisoners. Upon entering each room of the ship, your heroes battle any enemy inside automatically and secure the room as theirs once successful. You're trying to both win the battles that await you and keep the rooms you've secured safe from new opponents. Dungeon of the Endless is both a game about battling, defending, and managing resources to keep the ship secure.\nThis combination of different genres makes Dungeon of the Endless so interesting and challenging. As with many roguelikes, the battles themselves are difficult and you lose characters permanently, but there is so much more at stake than \"just\" characters that this game will keep you strategizing for a long time. A remake called Endless Dungeon is in the works, and hopefully, that will get the game the attention it deserves.\n10. 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim\nNot a lot of people play visual novels or even a lot of Japanese games, so we can understand if this went under, but upon release, 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim was one of the biggest surprises of 2020. This game tells the story of 13 characters who, when strange things start to happen to them (such as a talking cat invading one character's school), start to question their reality. Across different time zones, all of them will eventually meet, lose sight of each other, and meet again, all to find out they have been chosen to pilot a group of mechs and save the world.\nThere is much more to 13 Sentinels than this short summary can provide. It is a story that will make you exclaim in surprise, scratch your head in confusion, and cheer with each baffling revelation. Most of the story is told by you following conversations and picking up context clues, but there are also strategy mech battles for you to overcome.\nThe Switch version has refined these battles, making them a little more challenging and more enjoyable overall. 13 Sentinels is the perfect game for the Switch, a tale the likes of which you won't find anywhere else, and it's only one of the most underrated Switch games because it can be a hard sell. Once you pick it up, you're going to love it.\n9. Bad North\nBad North is a beautifully animated Switch game that puts you in charge of an army of Viking warriors, beset on all sides, and we mean all sides \u2013 you can see the entire island, so that you can plan your defense accordingly. The real-time strategy is based on simple mechanics, yet can quickly get taxing if you aren\u2019t paying close attention to the layout of the islands themselves \u2013 which are effectively 3D puzzles for you to figure out how best to defend yourself.\nIt's a bit of a mystery how this game could land on a list of underrated Switch games, seeing as everyone loves Vikings, but Bad North's minimalistic look may have turned people off. Watching approaching boats from the mist, with the slow thud of drums in the distance, is satisfying no matter how many times you experience it.\n8. Sunless Skies: Sovereign Edition\nDeveloper Failbetter Games proved its knack for stories with Sunless Sea, but the sequel Sunless Skies really shines, thanks to not only a fresh batch of great stories to discover but also better ways to get into the game for all those new to the series.\nThe game itself is easy to explain: you steer a magical steam train through the world of Albion, going from station to station in search of anything that is either interesting or that can help your crew stay alive. On the way you encounter Eldritch monstrosities, the vastness of space, as well as members of Fallen London's working class as well as its elites. Each story you encounter hinges on your decisions, and battle, while slightly repetitive, is an often unavoidable yet thrilling outcome.\nLovers of good stories shouldn't sleep on Sunless Skies. It's likely among the more underrated Switch games because there is lots to read, but it's also a game that offers a world like no other.\n7. Ape Out\nEnjoy jazz, bright colors, and rhythm-based violence? Then Ape Out may be for you. This top-down, single-player beat-em-up is sure to be unlike anything else you\u2019ve ever played. Players take on the role of a gorilla frantically trying to escape from gun-wielding humans through a series of mazes \u2013 each one different from the last. Kill the humans in your way, and use others as shields, as you make your way through the labyrinths to victory.\nThis game is about timing and rhythm as much as anticipating your enemies. Ape Out gives you the satisfying feeling of absolutely mowing over your opponents if everything goes right, even though you're just trying to escape. While the gameplay is really rather simple, everything in Ape Out is elevated by the frenetic jazz soundtrack that adapts to the situation, as well as the art, which proves you don't need much to turn out a thrilling action game.\n6. Oxenfree\nOxenfree is an excellent, underrated Switch game for those who love narrative adventures. You play as Alex, a teenager who goes on a weekend trip to an island housing a military facility with her friends and stepbrother. Unwittingly, the teens open up a supernatural rift on the island, causing things to go a bit awry. By a bit awry, we mean ghosts. They unleash ghosts on the island.\nOxenfree is largely choice-based. You're presented with various dialogue options ranging from classic teenage grumpiness to optimism, while bigger choices impact how the game plays out. Not being too gameplay-heavy may have caused Oxenfree to be overlooked, but the dialogue is stellar, both thanks to genuinely fun writing and good voice acting. Its watercolour-esque look is unique, too, while scntfc's moody soundtrack will make you a fan for life. It's not quite on par with the best horror games, but this is a teen horror with a great atmosphere you don't want to miss.\n5. Lost in Random\nLost in Random tells the story of Even, a girl who lives in a world where everything is decided by the roll of a die. This die dooms her beloved sister to a terrible fate, but Even has had enough of destiny and decides to find her sister and bring her back. However, there is no life without the die, and as such Even has one following her wherever she goes. Dice rolls determine certain situations in combat as well as the narrative, which is filled with fun characters and great voice acting.\nThere aren't a lot of games that try something entirely new, but the story of Lost in Random is truly a breath of fresh air, a game made with a lot of love and yet doomed to end up on a list of underrated Switch games. The world itself is reminiscent of mildly spooky things like Coraline by Neil Gaiman or The Nightmare Before Christmas, and the story is genuinely heartwarming.\n4. Dorfromantik\nDorfromantik gives you a stack of hexagonal tiles and tells you to put them together. If you fit a corner with houses on it next to another tile's corner with houses, you get points. This way, you can build giant cities and sprawling forests, but you always have to keep the board in mind that you slowly create that way. Find the best possible combinations to score points and, most importantly, not run out of tiles.\nOn PC, the city-building puzzle Dorfromantik, made by a bunch of German game design students, was a great hit, but its subsequent arrival on Switch was quieter.\nThat's likely because a lot of people can't imagine that playing a tile-based game with a controller is that much fun, but Dorfromatink actually clears that hurdle without much fuss. What you get is the idea game for handheld sessions. Something about Dorfromantik glues you to the screen, forever convinced you can make an even bigger board. We don't want to suffer the game's pull alone, hence we include the game among the most underrated Switch games.\n3. Salt and Sanctuary\nAs a shipwrecked sailor, you make your way through an uncharted, mysterious island you have to fight your way through. There are plenty of metroidvanias on the Switch and, not least of all, actual Metroid games, but Salt and Sanctuary comes with genuine Soulslike combat, something a lot of Metroidvanias attempt but not many of them get right.\nSalt and Sanctuary is an unexpectedly beautiful game stuffed with things to see and inevitably kill, and it's one of the very best games of this specific genre. While there is a sequel called Salt and Sacrifice, we're not necessarily sure we like it better, the differences between the two games don't always land with us and the sequel is at its best when it works like the original, so we decided on Salt and Sanctuary.\n2. Card Shark\nAt first, you may think Card Shark is a card game, but it's actually much more than that \u2013 Card Shark is actually a game about cheating at cards. As you can imagine, that isn't always easy, and Card Shark presents the different ways of cheating as a series of mini-games that take patience and often some trial and error to get right.\nOnce you figure it out, there is a genuine glee that comes with every successful cheating attempt. Card Shark is well-designed, both in terms of its mechanics as well as art design, and while it's not the kind of game to play over and over, there's currently nothing like it.\n1. If Found\nThe ups and downs of teenage life can often feel word-ending at times, at least that's how a lot of us remember it. If Found bottles that feeling, and uses it to tell one of the most well-told stories of heartbreak and the growing pains of life you can play on the Nintendo Switch.\nWith a beautiful hand-drawn art-style, and a dreamy soundtrack, If Found is well-worth checking out for fans of visual novels, and games that focus on telling stories through smart and experimental game design. The game is set in the West of Ireland in 1993, following Kasio as she recalls a particularly difficult time in her life. There's awkward teen romance, a world-ending black hole, and some very good dialogue indeed. Well worth checking out.\nUnderrated Switch games: FAQs\nWhat is the most underrated Nintendo Switch game?\nThe most underrated Switch game is a matter of personal taste, but together with the games we list here, there are a lot more games that deserve your attention.

      "text": "The 16 best Nintendo Switch 2 games to play in 2025\nThese are the best Nintendo Switch 2 games to play on the new console\nThe best Nintendo Switch 2 games include platform exclusives that launched alongside Nintendo's new console, as well as older games that are now enhanced on the upgraded hardware. Even though the Switch 2 is still early in its lifecycle, there's a great list of games to check out, whether that's in docked or handheld mode.\nSince the release of Nintendo Switch 2, I've spent countless hours playing the games that make up its already impressive catalogue, and we've been hard at work reviewing as many games for the console as we can. Switch 2 exclusives like Mario Kart World have stood out, thanks to 4K visuals and great use of the extra horsepower that the Switch 2 provides. Still, there are plenty of the best Nintendo Switch games that make this list as well. These range from upgraded versions like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch Edition, to modern classics like Hollow Knight.\nLooking ahead, there are loads of upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 games to look forward to. As I get my hands on them, I'll be regularly updating this list, tweaking my recommendations for the very best games to play on Switch 2 as the year goes on. For now, here are the best games to play on Nintendo Switch 2 right away.\nBest Nintendo Switch 2 games 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"WWE 2K25 Nintendo Switch 2 Edition finally brings the thrill of the wrestling ring to handheld, allowing users to battle on the go with similar performance and gameplay to their home console. With a wide variety of game modes to choose from, including The Bloodline\u2019s 2K Showcase, My Rise, and Universe, to name a few, WWE 2K25 on Switch 2 is the wrestling game fans have always dreamed of: the best of sports entertainment in your pocket.\" - John-Anthony Disotto, TechRadar Gaming reviewer.\nWWE 2K25 is a truly brilliant port for Nintendo Switch 2, finally bringing the full suite of features to a handheld device. This is, of course, not really the norm with sports games, as series like FIFA have fumbled in the past with subpar Nintendo Switch offerings. There's still some caveats to consider here, but WWE 2K25 is every bit as great on Switch 2 as anywhere else, and thanks to the added portability, it's actually better in some ways.\nThere\u2019s something quite magical about being able to take a sports video game on the go, and I hope WWE 2K25 is a sign of the future for Nintendo Switch 2. While it might not be on par graphically with the competition, it is gameplay-wise, and ultimately, that\u2019s the most important thing for fans of any gaming series.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army serves as a faithful, yet significantly refined take on its source material. It stays close to its PS2 roots visually, while adding much-needed quality of life improvements like a fresh UI and enhanced 3D environments. Expressive voice acting and a fantastic array of demons also add color to an engaging, mysterious plot.\" - Harry Padoan, TechRadar Reviews Staff Writer.\nSwitch 2 enhancements: faster loading times, more consistent 60FPS, better visuals when docked.\nRaidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army remasters one of Atlus' most under-appreciated gems, on that certain PS2 fans will remember fondly. For this new version, there's revamped visuals, QOL updates, new VO, and an overhauled battle system. All of these small updates help modernize the experience, and will no doubt help a whole new generation of gamers give it a try.\nIn Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army, you play as Raidou Kuzunoha XIV, an apprentice detective at the Narumi Detective Agency. The game is set in 1930s Tokyo, and features 120 Demons that can be summoned in battle. Many of these Demons are familiar, given that they've appeared in Persona games, and other Shin Megami Tensei projects. All in all, this is a great remaster of a unique and bold Atlus RPG. Fans of the studio will no doubt find plenty to love here, especially if playing it for the first time.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"Even with no prior experience of the Rune Factory series, Guardians of Azuma is a relaxing blend of genres that works in part due to the wholesome nature of its cast and setting. It\u2019s chicken soup on a rainy day - uncomplicated, but unmistakably enjoyable.\" - Lloyd Coombes, TechRadar Gaming reviewer.\nSwitch 2 enhancements: faster loading times, 60FPS, better visuals when docked.\nRune Factory: Guardians of Azuma arrived at the perfect time, just a few weeks after the launch of Switch 2, and in-between two big releases. Downtime like that can be a great time for games like Rune Factory to wow players, and that's exactly what the latest entry does. Part village-building simulator, part hack and slash, Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma offers up a seriously addictive combination, one that'll win the hearts of anyone fond of farming simulators.\nIn Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, you'll slowly build out a small village, get to know its quirky inhabitants, and even fall in love. There's a dozen characters to romance, allies that can be brought out with you on monster-hunting excursions, and plenty of upgrades that can be applied to your village. It's this upgrade loop that makes the game particularly more-ish, getting increasingly elaborate as you move from village to village building out your bases.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"Split Fiction offers the same thrilling fun on Switch 2 as on other platforms, but don't expect the same level of polish here. While Tabletop mode, in theory, offers the opportunity to take your co-op playthrough on the go, it's not the most optimal experience, and you'll likely find playing in TV mode more enjoyable. Overall, this is a pretty solid Switch 2 port, with some annoying niggles, but I advise picking up this co-adventure on another platform for the best experience all-round.\" - Vic Hood, TechRadar Gaming reviewer.\nSwitch 2 enhancements: GameShare, GameChat.\nSplit Fiction is the best co-op game you can load up on Switch 2, and thanks to the new GameShare feature, Switch 1 players can even join in for the first time. The ability to play the game handheld and to use the GameShare feature positions Split Fiction in quite a unique space when compared to other platforms. The performance isn't as good as on PC or PS5, but being able to take the game on the go and share the experience with those on older platforms more than makes up for any technical shortcomings.\nWe found Split Fiction to be an exhilarating co-op title in our PS5 playthrough, earning it a perfect score in our Split Fiction review. On Switch 2, we found it to measure up in the fun and gameplay variety, but did find a slight hit in technical performance. It's Hazelight's best game yet, and that's saying something, managing to improve upon its predecessors in combat, storytelling, and imagination. Thanks to Friend's Pass, you can invite a friend to play alongside you for free. It's neat features like this that pair so well with Nintendo Switch 2's GameChat and overall party-play ethos. It's a match made in heaven, one that's easy to recommend for those wanting to play with pals.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"It took a while for Street Fighter 6 to arrive, and for good reason. The final product is slickly polished, packed with modes and headlined by its feature-rich online Battle Hub and ambitious single player World Tour. It\u2019s a fighting game for everyone, with multiple control styles and vast accessibility options.\" - Rhys Wood, TechRadar Gaming Hardware Editor.\nSwitch 2 enhancements: Gyro Battle Mode, improved framerate, improved visuals, Calorie Contest Mode, and New amiibo functionality.\nStreet Fighter 6 was a real mixed bag on Switch, but its Switch 2 version fixes many of the issues we had. Firstly, the Switch 2 Pro Controller is a much better fit for the intricate inputs required for some Street Fighter 6 characters, with a hugely improved d-pad and back buttons that can be customized to suit your preferred configuration. Now, all but the World Tour Mode runs at 60FPS (frames per second), a huge step up that makes a world of difference in a fighting game such as this.\nWe absolutely adored Street Fighter 6 at launch, and it's only gotten better with post-launch additions like M. Bison, Terry, Mai, and Elena. Being able to take such a solid fighting game on the go is a real treat. You can challenge friends and use the improved tabletop mode to set up a match anywhere you want. There are some fun additional modes as well, that make very fun use of the Joy-Con's, though they're hardly the main event. With Year 3 content imminent, now is the perfect time to try out one of the best fighting games of all time on your Switch 2.\nThere will be a full Street Fighter 6 Switch 2 review going live on TechRadar Gaming in the near future. Once it's up, this section will be updated to reflect our Nintendo-specific playthrough.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"Fortnite is the biggest battle royale for a reason. Epic Games has created an ecosystem that you can get dozens of hours of play from without even touching the main Battle Royale mode. The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is a massive step up from the original Switch, thanks to its enhanced performance, and I can\u2019t think of a better way to play the game on a handheld.\" - Scott McCrae, TechRadar Gaming reviewer.\nSwitch 2 enhancements: Mouse Mode controls, improved framerate, improved visuals, greater view distances, replays, GameChat.\nFortnite received a massive upgrade for Nintendo Switch 2 at launch. Now, the game runs at a steady 60FPS (frames per second), and the Mouse Mode can be used in Battle Royale matches. The mouse controls are particularly great, allowing you to use one Joy-Con as your mouse for aiming and shooting, and the other controller for movement. It's a sort of mouse and keyboard/controller hybrid that feels fantastic to use.\nElsewhere, Fortnite offers plenty outside of the headline Battle Royale Mode. There's Lego Fortnite Odyssey, a full-blown survival crafting game, the high-stakes racing of Rocket Racing, and the Guitar Hero-throwback stylings of Fortnite Festival. That's before you add in Fortnite OG, Fortnite Ballistic, and all of the user-generated maps. If you're short of things to play on your shiny new Nintendo Switch 2, Fortnite is practically 10 games in one, with plenty of variety to keep you interested while waiting for new releases.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is the best Tony Hawk has ever been. The 1 + 2 remake set the standard, now 3 + 4 has elevated it by offering more goals and content, extra customization, and introducing new levels. It's not an easy game to master due to a high skill ceiling, but once you get to grips with it, chaining together long combos is so satisfying. Roll on the Underground remakes.\" - Ford James, TechRadar Gaming reviewer.\nSwitch 2 enhancements: Higher Resolution, Higher Framerate, HDR\nTony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 offers much the same experience as the previous remake collection, using the same engine and mission system to restore the original versions. The main difference here is that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 has been changed to match the structure of the previous three games. This mostly works, though some fans will miss the mission-based gameplay, preferring it to the now time-based challenges.\nMinor gripes aside, this is a near flawless remake of the best skateboarding games ever made. The soundtrack features some of the original songs, but has been filled out with new music from bands like Idles, Fontaines D.C., and rappers like ScHoolboyQ. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is the real highlight, with some of the best levels ever to feature in the series. The Switch 2 port is excellent, and the ability to take Tony Hawk anywhere with you is always a treat.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition brings a massive, must-play RPG to Nintendo Switch 2. Its solid performance and fantastic visuals are technically impressive and a real showcase of what the system can do. Throw in a wealth of Nintendo Switch 2-exclusive features, plus a handy progression sharing system, and you have the best way to play it on the go.\" - Dashiell Wood, TechRadar Gaming Hardware Writer.\nSwitch 2 enhancements: Better visuals, framerate, textures and performance.\nCyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition bundles together the base game, which has now received five year's worth of updates, and the excellent Phantom Liberty DLC. You'll be able to take Night City on the go with you, in what is a truly fantastic port.\nThis Nintendo Switch 2 version boasts better visuals and performance than its predecessor's, and there's extra bonuses to enjoy like mouse-mode aiming, gyro controls, and touch screen menu navigation. You can even use the motion controls to hack and slash your way through enemies. This is by no means the most graphically impressive way to play Cyberpunk 2077, but it is one of the most fun.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is already a classic, thanks to its incredible systemic open-world design that truly allows you to run wild and do whatever you\u2019d like. It gives players the tools to experiment, do silly things constantly, and make their adventure their own. And if you want to play it straight, it\u2019s a wonderful adventure game in its own right. The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is simply the game as you know it, but better, thanks to its improvements to framerate and resolution.\" - Scott McCrae, TechRadar Gaming reviewer.\nSwitch 2 enhancements: Improved visuals, improved framerate, Zelda Notes App integration.\nBreath of the Wild is absolutely worth loading up on Switch 2, now that the visuals have been cleaned up and performance improved across the board. The upgrade is transformative, fixing certain pain points like the Korok Forest - which ran poorly on the original hardware. Now, you can explore Hyrule without any technical limitations holding you back.\nWhether you've played Breath of the Wild before, you'll know that it's a modern classic at this point. While its sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, made smart changes and tweaks to the open exploration of Breath of the Wild, there's still magic to be found in the first of the series. Those who own the Switch Online Expansion Pack will receive the Switch 2 upgrade for Breath of the Wild at no extra cost. Remarkably, the now eight-year-old game still holds up, standing toe to toe with any of the newer games on this list.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"Hitman World of Assassination \u2013 Signature Edition is a decent port of an incredible stealth game, bringing hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of entertainment to Nintendo Switch 2 in a very well-rounded package. Performance could be better, and there are a few bugs in need of patches, but it's nevertheless a joy to pick up and play and almost impossible to put down.\" - Dash Wood, TechRadar Gaming Hardware Writer.\nSwitch 2 enhancements: Improved visuals, improved framerate, native version (non-Cloud).\nHitman: World of Assassination - Signature Edition brings everyone's favorite killer to the new console. Playing the game in handheld mode is a real delight, allowing you to tackle missions in bite-sized chunks and opening up a more casual way to play. Still, this is the same game that continues to receive updates to this day on other platforms, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.\nThere are a couple of Nintendo-themed clothing options, but Hitman World of Assassination is largely unchanged for Switch 2. Thankfully, the game is still absolutely brilliant, with the excellent Freelancer Mode being a real highlight. Featuring levels from the three main games, as well as a bunch added as DLC, this is a complete package that'll keep you busy for hours. Now, when are we getting 007: First Light again?\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is a charming follow-up to Link's Awakening that builds on that game\u2019s beautiful aesthetic while introducing just enough new mechanics to feel truly distinct. The dubious performance and repetitive combat can drag, but this is largely an excellent adventure throughout.\" - Dashiell Wood, TechRadar Gaming Hardware Writer.\nSwitch 2 enhancements: Improved visuals, improved framerate, Echoes favorite function added.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom was brilliant at launch; however, it did tend to run into some framerate inconsistencies quite often. On Switch 2, the game has been fixed, now running smoothly and looking gorgeous on the new hardware. There's a new feature that lets users favorite Echoes, making menu browsing much easier. In short, one of the best Switch games is even better on Switch 2.\nEchoes of Wisdom stars Zelda as the main playable character. It's much more of a puzzle-action game than Link's Awakening, with which it shares an art style. Zelda has a bunch of magical abilities that allow her to place objects on the world map, using them to overcome battles and traverse obstacles. This is a modern twist on classic Nintendo gameplay, which is really refreshing alongside the more open-world RPG-focused Zelda games on this list.\n5. Super Mario Odyssey\n\"Super Mario Odyssey doesn't discard the core mechanics of the series in quite the same way that Zelda: Breath of the Wild does, but it's fresh and different enough to what has gone before to comfortably rank as one of Mario's finest adventures in recent memory. \" - Damien McFerran, TechRadar Gaming reviewer.\nSwitch 2 enhancements: Improved visuals, improved framerate.\nSuper Mario Odyssey is a real feast for the eyes, and it now looks even better on Switch 2. Visuals have been enhanced slightly, though this is very much still the same game that debuted in 2017. It's one of the best Mario games released so far, with a globetrotting adventure taking Mario to a bunch of weird and wacky locales. Thanks to Cappy, Mario can take control of enemies, even giant ones like the T-Rex that sleeps on one particular level. This feature really stood out at launch, and it's something we praised in our original Super Mario Odyssey review.\nIf you've yet to try out Super Mario Odyssey, just know that it's a love letter to the franchise, blending 3D and 2D sections that feature neat Easter Eggs and throwbacks to older games. One particular level drops Mario in New Donk City, where he goes about gathering a band for a soaring musical number. It's pure Nintendo magic, reminding players why Mario games continue to be so popular so many years after debuting all the way back in the eighties.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"Mario Kart World is easily the standout launch title on Nintendo Switch 2. And while that may not be saying much, I anticipate it\u2019s comfortably going to be the best-selling Switch 2 game for the entire console generation. Nintendo has created a visually stunning kart racer here, chock-full of its trademark charm and personality.\" - Rhys Wood, TechRadar Gaming Hardware Editor.\nMario Kart World is the big Switch 2 launch title, and when compared to its predecessor, it's a wildly unique experience. Now, tracks are all connected on a broader open world map. Through the new Free Roam Mode, you can explore this world at your leisure, testing out your driving skills, unlocking new characters, and completing hidden challenges. So far, I've been wowed by the versatility and creativity of the driving. You can hop onto rails, ride along walls, and charge jumps to reach Coins and other boons.\nThanks to the extra power that the Nintendo Switch 2 provides, Mario Kart World looks incredible, whether that's in docked or handheld mode. Weather effects turn familiar locales into dynamic surprises. There's a whole host of outfits to unlock for the main roster, and there are even stickers that can be plastered onto your kart of choice. Simply put, Mario Kart World is a fresh new spin on the tried and tested Mario Kart formula. Knockout Tour is a real highlight, providing chaotic and tense elimination races that hinge on your ability to improvise and use items effectively. There's a whole new world to explore, and I can't wait to see what's added post-launch.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"Deltarune is a charming pixelated adventure that's not afraid to lean into the weird and wacky. This indie RPG flips the genre on its head, encouraging kindness over combat and delivering laughs in spades across its four chapters thanks to its witty writing, bizarre characters, and memorable worlds.\" - Vic Hood, TechRadar Gaming reviewer.\nDeltarune received its third and fourth chapters alongside the launch of Nintendo Switch 2. So far, the story is dazzling, telling an emotional tale that runs parallel to the events of Undertale. Fans of Undertale will find plenty to love here. There are familiar faces to meet, new allies to recruit to your team, and some truly wild twists and turns along the way. Deltarune shines on Switch 2, especially in handheld mode, allowing you to chip away at the game's chapters bit by bit.\nThere are three more chapters planned for Deltarune, but the game is already easy to recommend to Switch 2 owners. The soundtrack is second to none, combat has been updated in smart and interesting ways, and there's an overall sadness to proceedings that makes the story linger in your memory, long after you've set it down for the night.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was already on the Mount Rushmore of video games. That said, if you weren't able to click with the original due to the performance, the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition completely revolutionizes the game. Having spent over 70 hours exploring the vast region of Hyrule in glorious HDR, I can't recommend this game enough; it's truly one of the best gaming experiences you can buy in 2025.\" - John-Anthony Disotto, TechRadar Gaming reviewer.\nSwitch 2 enhancements: Improved visuals, improved framerate, Zelda Notes App integration.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has been massively improved in its Nintendo Switch 2 version. Somehow, one of the best games ever made is now even better, with improved performance and visuals more than warranting a reason to revisit Hyrule. The new Zelda Notes app is a great companion too, featuring a sort of sat-nav that'll guide you to Shrines and Korok Seeds, and a Zelda-led narration tool that adds extra story context.\nWe played over 70 hours in our The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom review and found it to be an absolute delight, full of welcome embellishments and bold additions. One of the biggest new additions to the established formula is the new Zonai abilities, such as Ultrahand and Fuse, which add a new perspective to how you can interact with the game world. That's very much just scratching the surface of what makes this adventure RPG so special. It's still the best game you can play on Switch 2.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"Donkey Kong Bananza is the greatest Nintendo Switch 2 title to date, delivering an incredible destruction system that showcases the power of the new system. It\u2019s visually impressive and, while the story isn\u2019t anything to write home about, benefits from charming and expressive voice acting and animations. Throw in a seemingly endless stream of collectibles and secrets, and you have a meaty adventure that\u2019s a delight to explore.\" - Dash Wood, TechRadar Gaming Hardware Writer.\nDonkey Kong Bananza is, simply put, the best Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive released so far, and the best game on the new platform overall. While I enjoyed Mario Kart World as a launch title, I did feel that the Switch 2's initial offering could have done with a singleplayer game. Thankfully, Donkey Kong Bananza absolutely scratches this itch, arriving just six weeks after the launch of the Switch 2.\nIt feels like a true follow-up to 2017\u2019s ground-breaking Super Mario Odyssey, with everything that made that game so enjoyable dialed up to the max. You even have Pauline as a companion, as you make your way through lavish underground worlds filled with secrets and collectibles.\nBest Nintendo Switch 2 games: FAQs\nIs it still worth buying a Nintendo Switch in 2025?\nNow that the Nintendo Switch 2 is out, there are some questions over whether its predecessor is still worth picking up. Given that Switch 2 exclusives are quite rare at this point, getting a Switch for cheap is still a great idea. You'll still be able to play many of the big games coming in 2025, like Pok\u00e9mon Legends Z-A and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. Check out our Switch 2 vs Switch comparison article to see what's changed between the two.\nWhich games should I download on my Nintendo Switch 2?\nAny of the games on this list are great places to start, though there are loads of games that I'd recommend for your new console. Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet has been massively updated, fixing the frankly awful visuals and performance. Then there's Hollow Knight, which is still one of the best games to get on handheld devices. You can't go wrong with a 2D Mario game either, and I'd happily recommend Super Mario Maker 2.\nAre Nintendo Switch 2 games region locked?\nNo. Unlike some previous Nintendo home consoles, the Switch 2 is completely region-free. That means you can play physical games from other regions on your console. You will need an account from a relevant country to access its Nintendo eShop, however.\nWhat Switch 1 games are better on Switch 2?\nThe majority of Switch 1 games are better on Switch 2, though there are some that feature more substantial improvements on the new hardware. Cyberpunk 2077 has the best upgrade, though you'll need to pay for it. For a free upgrade, Fortnite and No Man's Sky are brilliant on Switch 2.\nHow we made our best Nintendo Switch games list\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 is only early on in its life, but we've been covering it since it was first announced, even going hands-on before launch day. Now, we've spent dozens of hours testing the new hardware, games, and accessories, and will continue to do so, so you know you can trust our takes and verdicts.\nHaving covered the Switch generation from the beginning, the experts at TechRadar Gaming are therefore confident in our recommendations, which will continue to be updated as new games come out in the future.\nYou Might Also Like...\n- The best indie game to play in 2025\n- The Nintendo Switch 2 launch line-up as it happened\n- Everything we know about Hollow Knight: Silksong - coming to Switch 2 in 2025\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nJake is a freelance writer who currently works regularly with TRG.

  "argos_summary": "Nintendo\u2019s Switch 2 is a heavily upgraded but largely familiar handheld that offers a 1080p LCD, 120\u202fHz performance, 4K docked output and improved battery life compared to the original, but still suffers from a short handheld runtime and a thin launch library. It boasts excellent backward compatibility, a new magnetic Joy\u2011Con 2 system, GameChat, and a new fishing\u2011reel attachment patent, while the price and subscription model may deter some buyers. The console is praised for its smooth UI, vivid display and powerful processor, yet criticized for its limited game roster, poor battery, and Bluetooth audio lag. Overall, it is a solid entry\u2011level and family\u2011friendly option that delivers a significant performance leap over the 2017 Switch, but those seeking a long battery life or a robust first\u2011party lineup may want to wait for future releases or consider alternatives like the Steam Deck or ROG Ally. The article also highlights current eBay discounts and a promotional code for a 10% savings on the console and Mario Kart World bundle.",
