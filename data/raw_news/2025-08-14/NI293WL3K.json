  "title": "Apple's First 5G MacBook Pro Might Arrive Sooner Than Expected",
  "description": "Apple has yet to include cellular connectivity on its laptops, but leaked code suggests that the first 5G MacBook Pro is now in development.",
  "content": "A new report from Macworld relays that a MacBook Pro with 5G cellular capability might be coming relatively soon. The publication recently managed to get a look at some internal Apple code and noticed a reference to a \"Centauri\" chip. It may sound obscure, but that's the full name for the C1 modem Apple debuted on the iPhone 16e earlier this year. In short, the code confirms that Apple is currently testing a next-gen MacBook Pro with an M5 Pro chip and cellular functionality.\n\nIncidentally, there are already reports that Apple this year began testing a second-gen C2 modem. Indeed, we've seen rumblings that Apple's iPhone 18 Pro may ship with the C2.\n\nIt's too early to say when Apple might announce a revamped MacBook Pro lineup, but analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently opined that a launch in 2026 is likely. The timeline makes sense given that Apple's most recent major MacBook Pro refresh was in October of 2024 when it introduced a new MacBook Pro line with M4 processors.\n\nRead more: 7 Under-The-Radar Apple Watch Features You Should Be Using\n\nApple Has Big Plans For The MacBook Pro\n\nThe release of Apple's next-gen MacBook Pro lineup might be staggered ever so slightly. Some believe that an upgrade to MacBook Pro models with M5, M5 Pro, and M5 Max processors will likely happen early next year, and perhaps as soon as January 2025. While MacBook Pro refreshes in January are rare, they're not unprecedented. Recall that Apple updated its MacBook Pro line with M2 processors in January of 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, a more significant MacBook Pro overhaul -- with a slightly tweaked form factor and improved display technology -- will likely take place in late 2026. There are also reports that these MacBook Pro models -- which will come in 14-inch and 16-inch display options -- will also be markedly thinner than the current models. Recall a 2024 report from Bloomberg which relayed that Apple is aiming to release devices that are \"the thinnest and lightest in their categories across the whole tech industry.\"\n\nIt's fair to say that a MacBook Pro with built-in cellular capabilities is long overdue. Premium Windows laptops have boasted this functionality for nearly 5 years. According to some estimates, over 12 million cellular-connected laptops were shipped globally in 2024, a massive jump from 2 million in 2022. Suffice it to say, the market for 5G laptops is growing, and it makes sense for Apple to get in on the action.\n\nAll that said, it's not as if 5G functionality is imperative for everyone. For most users, tethering has proven to be an adequate solution. Still, a built-in 5G option that doesn't require users to drain their smartphone battery would be welcome. What's more, a built-in 5G option would provide users with more consistent and reliable network speeds with less lag.",

      "text": "7 Under-The-Radar Apple Watch Features You Should Be Using\nThe Apple Watch has become an invaluable everyday companion for many users. Whether you have an Apple Watch Series 6 or the latest Ultra 2 model, several features might not be on your radar, but we want to convince you to start using them.\nFind your iPhone: With an Apple Watch Series 9 or Apple Watch Ultra 2, you can locate your iPhone 15 or newer with Precision Find. Tap the Watch's side button and then tap the Ping My iPhone icon. If your phone is in the Apple Watch's range, its location will appear.\nControl your Apple TV: You can control your Apple TV using your iPhone, but did you know it's also possible on your Apple Watch? Just look for the app with a blue background and white \"Play\" icon on your Watch to select your Apple TV and control it even without your remote nearby.\nCreate a custom workout: On the Workouts app, you can tap the three-dot button of exercises to reveal custom workout plans. You can base your training on distance, pace, time, calories, and even repetitions (with rest intervals). It's a great feature that can upgrade your workouts.\nApple Watch speakers: The Apple Watch Series 10 and Ultra 2 can be used without earbuds. If you want to listen to your favorite podcasts or your new playlist but don't have your iPhone handy, the watch's little speakers can play your media out loud.\nWalkie-talkie your friends: You might have forgotten about this, but to this day, I find it to be one of the best features I can remind my friends with Apple Watch models about. It's handy and convenient, and might be the best option in some use cases. Once your friends approve your request, you can ring them anytime.\nCustomize Activity Ring goals: watchOS 11 also lets you change your Activity Ring goals daily. More importantly, if you just want to take a break but don't want to lose your streak, you can pause your rings for the day or the week.\nSleep Apnea detection: With the new Sleep Apnea Notification feature on Apple Watch, you can be notified if your breathing disturbances show consistent signs of sleep apnea. Over time, sleep apnea can have significant health consequences, including cardiac disease."

      "text": "Apple's M5 MacBook Pro Won't Arrive Until 2026\nIf you've been patiently waiting for Apple to unveil its M5 MacBook Pro lineup, you might have to wait a little bit longer than you were probably expecting. Despite rumblings that Apple's next-gen MacBook Pro might ship by the end of this year, a new report from Bloomberg relays that the release date has been pushed back to 2026.\nAccording to the report, Apple is currently planning to release two MacBook Pro models sometime next year, one with a 14-inch display and another with a 16-inch display. Note that Apple released its M4 MacBook Pro lineup in October of 2024, which is to say the company isn't beholden to an annual release schedule for the Mac in the same way that it is for the iPhone.\nIt's also worth noting that Apple's 2026 MacBook Pro lineup will be the last models to boast the current design. The current MacBook Pro form factor has been around for a few years, and even though there's nothing really wrong with it, Apple certainly likes to mix things up every so often.\n2027 MacBook Pro will be thinner with a better display\nOne design change we can expect to see on the 2027 MacBook Pro is a thinner design. Recall a previous report from Bloomberg which said that Apple's goal over the next few years is to release devices that are \"the thinnest and lightest in their categories across the whole tech industry.\" And with Apple seemingly on track to do that with the iPhone 17 Air \u2013 which will be just 5.9mm thick \u2013 it will be interesting to see how much thinner and lighter the company's next-gen MacBook Pro models will be.\nAdditionally, we can expect Apple's M6 MacBook Pros to feature OLED displays. This improvement will provide users with a more vibrant screen, complete with higher contrast ratios, improved brightness, and last but not least, improved power efficiency.\nIt's also worth noting that the original MacBook Pro was launched in 2006. In other words, there's a good chance Apple will want to release something special for the device's 20th anniversary. That might end up being a positive, if unintended, side effect of the delay.\nWill the upcoming Vision Pro update ship with an M5?\nInterestingly enough, we've seen conflicting reports about Apple's next-gen Vision Pro. Slated for release later this year, reputed analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes the next-gen device will boast an M5 processor. More recently, though, the typically reliable Mark Gurman relayed that the device will feature an M4 processor. Regardless of who is ultimately right, it's still going to be a marked improvement over the current model, which boasts an M2 chip.\nAnother Vision Pro rumor is that the device will be slightly less heavy and ship with a more comfortable strap. This is a welcome change, to say the least. Even ardent Vision Pro enthusiasts often claim that the device can start feeling heavy after 30-plus minutes of use."

      "text": "Following the release of its first in-house 5G modem with the iPhone 16e, rumors have suggested that Apple has been quietly preparing for a major leap forward in its MacBook lineup, one that could finally bring built-in cellular connectivity to its laptops. Internal Apple code seen by Macworld now reveals that the company has indeed been testing an unreleased MacBook Pro model with an M5 Pro chip and Apple\u2019s first 5G modem.\nThe code, which also revealed the existence of a new Mac Pro with the M4 Ultra chip, now confirms that the company is at least experimenting with the idea of a MacBook with cellular connectivity. This Mac laptop found in the code is powered by the M5 Pro chip (codenamed t6050), which indicates the upcoming generation of MacBook Pro.\nBut the M5 Pro isn\u2019t the most exciting thing about this discovery. The same code suggests that this could be the first Mac ever to include a \u201cCentuari\u201d chip, which is the codename for Apple\u2019s 5G modem (also known as C1), introduced earlier this year with the iPhone 16e.\nBuilt-in cellular has long been a feature in some Windows ultrabooks and the iPad, but Apple has resisted adding it to the Mac, reportedly due to design and battery life concerns. Now, with Apple controlling both the CPU and modem, the company could deliver a seamless, power-efficient solution for MacBook users and finally bring all-over wireless to the Mac.\nA previous Bloomberg report revealed Apple\u2019s plans to bring cellular connectivity to the Mac. At the time, Mark Gurman said that \u201ccellular connections are unlikely to come to the Mac before 2026.\u201d More recently, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported that the first M5 Macs won\u2019t arrive this year.\nOf course, Apple\u2019s plans may change since the evidence we\u2019ve seen comes from internal code, which means unfinished products. Still, we now at least have evidence that built-in cellular connectivity is fianlly coming to the Mac."

      "text": "iPhone 16e Marks The End Of An Era, But The C1 Modem Marks The Beginning Of A New One\nYesterday, Apple officially introduced the iPhone 16e, a new entry-level device that replaces the beloved iPhone SE. The iPhone 16e is now the cheapest iPhone in Apple's lineup. But don't let the word 'cheapest' fool you. In typical Apple fashion, the iPhone 16e packs a lot of power and brings a lot to the table.\nSure, the device isn't as affordable as the iPhone SE, which sold for less than $500. But the iPhone 16e, which starts at $599, delivers a lot more in the way of features, including a 6.1-inch display, an A18 processor, improved battery life, and a far more advanced camera than we ever saw on Apple's iPhone SE models. It's also worth mentioning that the entry-level storage option on the iPhone 16e is 128GB, a welcome improvement over the iPhone SE, where the entry-level model had 64GB of storage.\nThe iPhone 16e signals the end of an era - No more small iPhones\nThat said, one of the more remarkable things about Apple's iPhone 16e has nothing to do with its feature set. On the contrary, the iPhone 16e is particularly remarkable insofar that the device represents the end of an era for a few things that were long associated with the iPhone.\nThe arrival of the iPhone 16e \u2013 coupled with the recent discontinuation of the iPhone SE and the iPhone Mini back in 2023 \u2013 marks the first time that there is no longer a compact iPhone model in Apple's lineup. For users who prefer a more compact form factor, it's something of a bittersweet moment.\nI say that as someone who, for years, preferred Apple's smaller models. Perhaps it's just nostalgia talking, but something about the iPhone 5s form factor was just perfect. This compact form factor lived on in the iPhone Mini and iPhone SE for years. That said, for as much as I loved the smaller form factors, I eventually gave in and upgraded to an iPhone Pro. I suppose that additional features and more power are sometimes more alluring than a compact device. Truth be told, if compact iPhone models sold in any meaningful quantities, there's no way Apple would have stopped producing them.\nToday, the smallest iPhone model you can buy is the iPhone 16e, with a 6.1-inch display. In short, the era of the compact iPhone is officially over. At the end of the day, the reality is that bigger-screened devices simply sell better.\nThe home button era is over\nIf we're being honest, the home button era on the iPhone has been on its way out for some time now. Still, there was something nice \u2013 again, maybe it's nostalgia \u2013 about having an iPhone with a home button in Apple's lineup. The home button was, dare I say, iconic. Broadly speaking, it was part of a new paradigm in how we used mobile phones, and Steve Jobs really drove this point home when he introduced the iPhone nearly 2 decades ago.\nBut Apple is nothing if not forward-looking. I may be prone to nostalgia, but Apple is not. It embraces the future and isn't afraid to say goodbye to the past. And, if I'm being honest, the eradication of the home button from Apple's lineup shouldn't come as much of a surprise. If anything, I'm impressed it stuck around for as long as it did. Even non-tech-savvy relatives of mine who, for years, would only buy iPhones with a home button recently decided it was time to embrace Face ID.\nApple officially enters the modem game\nApple has never been subtle about its desire to break free from Qualcomm as a modem supplier. There were even massive lawsuits between the two companies a few years back.\nBut there's a reason Apple hasn't been able to extricate itself from its longstanding relationship with Qualcomm: Qualcomm's products are best-in-class, and Apple's in-house designs haven't been able to match their performance. And that's not for lack of trying. Recall that Apple in 2019 acquired Intel's smartphone modem business for $1 billion. For years, Apple has been working on designing its own 5G modems in-house, but the effort has been hampered by a variety of technical hurdles and setbacks\nAs far back as 2018, rumors spread that we might see an Apple-designed modem in an iPhone by 2022. Turns out, we had to wait until 2025. But going forward, if Apple's custom C1 5G modem on the iPhone 16e performs well, it stands to reason that we'll see Apple eventually phase out Qualcomm within a few years.\nIt's worth noting that Apple's C1 modem is more power-efficient than the Qualcomm chip that powers the iPhone 16. With a similar form factor to the iPhone 16, the iPhone 16e boasts four more hours of battery life.\nThe C1 modem on the iPhone 16e is just the beginning\nSo, while Apple's iPhone 16e represents the end of an era in some ways, it also may mark the beginning of a new era. One in which Apple's reliance on Qualcomm may eventually come to an end. Apple famously likes controlling all aspects of the components that go into its products, and entering the modem space has certainly been its most challenging endeavor yet.\nLastly, it's worth noting that Apple analyst Ming Chi-Kuo published a note earlier today claiming that Apple's slim iPhone 17 will utilize Apple's C1 modem next year."

      "text": "iPhone 18 Pro Rumored To Debut Apple's New C2 5G Modem\nWhile the rumor mill for the upcoming iPhone 17 models keeps running, analyst Jeff Pu also shares insights on the iPhone 18 lineup. Along with discussing camera improvements and Apple's custom Wi-Fi 7 chip for this year's iPhone 17 models, he mentions that Apple is working on a new C2 5G modem for the iPhone 18 Pro models.\nIn a note seen by BGR, the analyst talks about hardware lacking momentum and innovations for the future models; he mentions that \"despite the positive progress of iPhone model ((i.e., C1 for 16e and 17 Air, C2 for iPhone 18 Pro models), we see limited help, as mobile semi carries low valuation.\"\nWith that, the analyst reiterates that Apple is indeed working on a C2 chip for the iPhone 18 Pro models. If the company can improve the existing C1 experience, users will get better battery life, a more efficient connection between cellular and AirDrop capabilities, and more.\nIn a previous report, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman commented on the possible roadmap for Apple's 5G chips. With C1, for example, the company couldn't add mmWave technology, which is expected to be available with the upcoming C2 version.\nAt the time, the journalist wrote that Apple was already working on a second-generation 5G modem that could power the future iPhone 18 models. Per his report, this chip could finally add mmWave support, download speeds of 6 gigabits per second, six-carrier aggregation when using Sub-6 5G, and eight-carrier aggregation when using mmWave.\nWhen the iPhone reaches its 20th anniversary in 2027, the company hopes to top Qualcomm with its modem performance and AI features. Apple also aims to build support for next-generation satellite networks and eventually merge its 5G modem with its main processor, creating the ultimate singular mobile component.\nQualcomm, on the other hand, thinks Apple's 5G chip can't even compare to what the company currently offers. Only time will tell if Cupertino will be as successful with its 5G modems as it has with its custom processors."

      "text": "Apple Is Working On Thinner Designs For Next-Gen iPhone 17, Apple Watch, And MacBook Pro\nA new report from Bloomberg relays that Apple's iPhone 17, set for launch in 2025, may be significantly thinner than its predecessors. The report is interesting insofar that Apple, especially since Jony Ive left the company, had somewhat abandoned its obsession with thinness. For many, this was a welcome about-face as some felt that Apple was sacrificing functionality for aesthetics. Indeed, countless surveys over the years have shown that most Apple users prefer a slightly bulkier form factor if it entails a slightly larger battery.\nInterestingly, Apple's newfound prioritization of thinness won't be exclusive to the iPhone. On the contrary, the company is also looking to release thinner MacBook Pro and Apple Watch models.\nTo this end, Bloomberg notes that Apple's goal is to release devices that are \"the thinnest and lightest in their categories across the whole tech industry.\" It's an intriguing proposition, and if Apple can figure out a way to achieve this without sacrificing battery life across any of its products, it's certainly a step in the right direction.\nHow thin will the iPhone 17 be?\nAs it stands now, we haven't seen huge fluctuations in iPhone thickness over the years. Still, those sensitive to mild adjustments in weight and size may have noticed a slight difference across various models. For instance, Apple's iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 measure in at a depth of 8.25mm and 7.8mm, respectively. As a point of comparison, Apple's iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 models were both about 7.44mm thick.\nSo, how thin are we talking if Apple wants to have the thinnest smartphone in the industry?\nWell for starters, we might want to eliminate foldable phones as it's not exactly a fair comparison. Google's Pixel Fold, for instance, is 5.8mm thick, but that's only when the device is fully opened. Taking those devices out of the running, most of the slimmest smartphones on the market today have a thickness in the range of 7.2mm to 7.7mm.\nMeanwhile, the thinnest iPhone model ever released was the iPhone 6, which had a thickness of 6.9mm. If Apple can somehow release a next-gen device in that range of depth, it would be impressive. Recall that smartphones today are thicker than in years past due to features like bigger batteries and more advanced camera modules.\nIt's worth noting that this isn't the first time we've seen reports pointing to a slimmer iPhone 17 design. Last month there was a report claiming that Apple in 2025 will release an iPhone 17 Slim to replace what would have been the iPhone 17 Plus.\nSome other iPhone 17 Pro rumors we've seen point to a smaller Dynamic Island, 12GB of RAM, a 24MP front-facing camera, and maybe even Face ID sensors underneath an active area of the display."
