      "feedback": "This draft, while comprehensive, overshoots the 4–6 sentence executive format and dilutes a crisp house view; tighten to 4–6 sentences that lay out a base-case Regime A, two explicit alternate paths, catalysts, risks, and a watch-list, with every assertion tied to a single source. Build the base-case around Regime A (AI/TFP productivity, disciplined capex) with explicit triggers (inflation/wage dynamics sustaining Regime 1 vs. cooling inflation and payrolls pulling toward Regime 2 or growth deceleration toward Regime 3) and anchor the regime-shift logic to the policy-reaction framework and real-rate signals, citing NL5YYTLF2 and 37UZC9X8I as appropriate; relegate the Jackson Hole/Chips Act signals to catalysts rather than ad hoc sidebars, and ensure the Chips/Intel dynamic is presented as a structural tailwind in the regulator framework (cite H7Q52FKDH, 37UZC9X8I). Compress Ford/ACMR into a single, numbers-focused capsule: Ford Q2 shows 4.3% adj margin and 10.1% ROIC with a $1.3B EV loss; ACMR shows Q2 rev ~$215m, net income ~$30m, 2025 rev guide $850–$950m, GM ~49.4%, NM ~13.8%, D/E ~23.3%, with ACMR trading around $30.5 vs. $34.8 consensus, and 95 IPOs/$12.9B raised data anchoring a potential breadth-up regime (cite 22PL3Q360, C3ODMIQKZ, SK994CBWR, Q7VVGNSQE, C22MKA9VY). Remove or tightly bind the 0–3 week macro section to a single watch-line with explicit triggers (Fed/ECB signals, regime-tilt tests) and delete extraneous micro-detail (e.g., broad personal-loan APR ranges) unless you connect it directly to a transmission channel for autos/tech demand; instead, use a concise, source-backed transmission chain (policy signal → rates/dollar → equity multiple → autos/tech capex) with citations at the end of each sentence. Ensure every claim has a single, relevant source ID, reconciling any conflicts by privileging the regime-consistent frame (prefer NL5YYTLF2, 37UZC9X8I, J99EM2TPZ, RHFWI02JT as core macro anchors) and consolidating adjacent references to avoid citation clusters; end with a falsification test (two consecutive inflation prints above target would lift real rates and push toward a defensive stance) and a tight watch-list (policy cadence, IPO/flows breadth, ACMR bookings/exports) with the exact IDs (e.g., C22MKA9VY, Q7VVGNSQE, SK994CBWR).",
