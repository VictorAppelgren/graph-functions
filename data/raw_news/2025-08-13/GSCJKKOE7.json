  "content": "ChatGPT will now allow you to choose between several GPT-5 variants and previous OpenAI models. In a post on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has revealed that the chatbot's model picker now comes with three GPT-5 choices: Auto, Fast and Thinking. He said most \"will want Auto,\" which is most likely the standard version that's already a reasoning model. But users will be able to choose the fast-responding version or the Thinking version that implies it delivers longer, more comprehensive answers if they want to. GPT-4o is now also back in the model picker for all paying users by default.\n\nOpenAI removed GPT-4o with the launch of GPT-5: The company significantly simplified ChatGPT because GPT-5 was supposed to offer a unified experience for users. However, its decision was met by criticism from people who preferred GPT-4o's personality better, especially since it didn't give them notice that it was deprecating older models. In his post, Altman promised users that if the company ever does deprecate GPT-4o, OpenAI \"will give plenty of notice.\" In addition to the GPT-5 and GPT-4o models, users can toggle to \"Show additional models\" in ChatGPT web settings if they want to access o3, 4.1, and GPT-5 Thinking mini. GPT-4.5 is only available to subscribers paying for the $200-a-month Pro tier, though, because it \"costs a lot of GPUs.\"\n\nAltman said that GPT-5 Thinking now has rate limits of 3,000 messages a week, after which users will only be able to use GPT-5 Thinking mini. He has also revealed that OpenAI is working to update GPT-5's personality to make it warmer, but \"not as annoying (to most users) as GPT-4o.\"",

      "text": "OpenAI brings GPT-4o back online after users melt down over the new model\nThe newly-released GPT-5 may be smarter and more efficient, but some users prefer GPT-4o's conversational tone.\nFollowing the rollout of OpenAI's latest GPT-5 model earlier this week, a certain user base was adamantly calling for the return of the previous GPT-4o model. Outspoken users complained about the writing quality of the updated model, with some even going so far as to grieve the loss of GPT-4o, which some said they considered a friend and confidant.\nIn the latest OpenAI update that labels GPT-5 as the \"smartest, fastest, most useful model yet,\" the company removed the option to choose which model to use and defaults to GPT-5 instead. With the new model, GPT-5 uses a \"real-time router\" that switches between a more efficient model for basic questions and a deeper reasoning alternative for more complex demands.\nThe initial rollout ran into some issues that made GPT-5 seem \"way dumber,\" according to OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman, who also opened up a Reddit AMA to offer more insight into the changes. On Reddit, Altman responded to a question by saying GPT-5's writing quality is better than previous models, but asked users if this felt true. In response, several Redditors voiced their opinion that the GPT-5 felt \"sterile\" and \"much worse\" and answered \"briefly and dryly.\" In response to the initial outcry, Altman posted on X that OpenAI would let Plus subscribers choose between using GPT-5 or GPT-4o.\n\"We for sure underestimated how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them, even if GPT-5 performs better in most ways,\" Altman said on X.\nThe return of GPT-4o was celebrated, but there's still no guarantee that OpenAI will keep its older model around indefinitely. In the same X post, Altman said that OpenAI \"will watch usage as we think about how long to offer legacy models for.\" In the meantime, OpenAI is focusing on finishing the GPT-5 rollout and making changes that will \"make it warmer.\" However, for users who have grown attached to GPT-4o as more than just an AI chatbot, this could be the beginning of the end."
