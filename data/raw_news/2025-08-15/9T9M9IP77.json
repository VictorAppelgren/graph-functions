  "description": "A federal judge on Friday considered placing a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's takeover of Washington D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department.",
  "content": "A judge on Friday weighed limiting the power of the Trump administration to assume control of the police department in Washington, D.C., after suggesting the appointment of Drug Enforcement Administration head Terry Cole to assume the police chief\u2019s duties was illegal.\n\nJudge Ana Reyes gave lawyers for the Department of Justice and the D.C. government until early evening to reach a deal that would limit Cole\u2019s authority, or she would issue a temporary restraining order.\n\nReyes, a Biden appointee, said broader questions over President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping executive order declaring a crime emergency in the nation's capital would be addressed in a court hearing next week.\n\nIn the immediate future, the Trump administration will still largely have control over the Metropolitan Police Department regardless of whether it reaches a deal with the D.C. government or becomes subject to a court order.\n\nReyes convened the emergency hearing after D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb sued to block Trump's takeover of D.C.'s law enforcement operations. Schwalb argued the move was unconstitutional and violated the Home Rule Act, a federal law that gives D.C. residents the ability to self-govern.\n\nThe hearing was a small setback for the administration, as Reyes indicated that Cole must go through Mayor Muriel Bowser to give any further directives to the police force.\n\nSchwalb on Friday framed the hearing as a win, telling reporters his \"expectation is that the key issue with respect to control and command of [the MPD] has been resolved today, and that it is clear, as a matter of law, that it is under the chief of police appointed by the mayor.\"\n\nBut the law also implies that Bowser must be heavily deferential to Cole, meaning he is likely to be able to continue carrying out the Trump administration's policing priorities in D.C. regarding immigration and homelessness for a 30-day period.\n\nDOJ attorney Yaakov Roth, arguing on behalf of the government, said the president has \"a lot of discretion in determining what's necessary and appropriate.\"\n\nBowser and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., attended the hearing at the E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse. Outside the building, dozens gathered to protest the federal takeover, which has also included activating hundreds of National Guard soldiers in D.C. More protesters, including those from the \"Free DC\" movement, appeared inside the courtroom, underscoring the tension that has arisen over Trump's orders.\n\n\"What we know is that D.C. residents are worried and concerned, and we have a surge of federal officers,\" Bowser told reporters. \"Chief [Pamela] Smith's job during this week has been to make sure that if we have and while we have federal officers, that they are being used strategically.\"\n\nDEA HEAD SAYS PHONE CALLS ARE COMING FROM 'ALL OVER THE COUNTRY\u2019 FROM FED AGENTS WANTING TO HELP IN DC\n\nAt the outset of the hearing, Reyes observed that she will be the first judge to rule on a president\u2019s authority to temporarily take control of the Metropolitan Police Department under the Home Rule Act since Congress passed the legislation in 1973, underscoring the significance of the case.\n\nThe judge made clear she did not plan to immediately rule on whether there was a crime emergency, as Trump stated in his executive order, but that some temporary resolution was still needed.\n\n\"I want to get to a practical solution because time is short and there are people who need to know who they are taking direction from and what they are doing,\" Reyes told both parties.\n\nReyes, who has become known for presiding over a fast-paced court that keeps litigators on their toes, struck a careful tone of moderation Friday.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think the statute is as narrow as you think or as broad as Mr. Roth thinks,\" she told attorney Mitchell Reich, who argued on behalf of the D.C. attorney general.\n\nSchwalb's lawsuit challenged Trump's executive order that temporarily federalized D.C. under Section 740 of the Home Rule Act and Attorney General Pam Bondi's more recent order Thursday that sought to install Cole as the emergency commissioner of the D.C. police force. Schwalb's office argued the moves were unprecedented and could \"wreak operational havoc\" on the police department.\n\nSchwalb urged the court to block both of the Trump administration's orders, stating that the federal government's temporary takeover of D.C. police under the Home Rule Act \"does not authorize this brazen usurpation of the District\u2019s authority over its own government.\"\n\n\"They infringe on the District\u2019s right to self-governance and put the safety of DC residents and visitors at risk,\" he said.\n\nCritics have excoriated Trump\u2019s executive order, arguing it is not reflective of any real emergency in the nation's capital, which has seen a drop in violent crime (though by how much, exactly, remains a point of contention).\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAttorney Norm Eisen, the former White House ethics czar under President Barack Obama, told reporters Thursday that Trump\u2019s order in D.C. is the latest in a \"pattern of assaults on the rule of law\" in his second term as president, which all involve declaring various forms of \"emergency\" as a means of sidestepping normal policymaking processes.\n\nTrump \"has declared a fake emergency\" in D.C., Eisen said. \"There is no \u2018emergency\u2019 upon which this action with MPD or the federal military is predicated.\"",

      "text": "Key facts about President Donald Trump: What to know\nDonald Trump served as the 45th President of the United States and was re-elected in 2024 to become the 47th President. He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump. Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022. Trump married Marla Maples in 1993, and they have one daughter, Tiffany Trump.\nDonald Trump Jr., the eldest child of President Trump, has five children: Kai Trump, Donald J. Trump III, Tristan Trump, Spencer Trump, and Chloe Trump. Eric Trump is married to Lara Trump, who currently hosts FOX News Channel's \"My View with Lara Trump.\" Eric and Lara have two children, Eric Luke Trump and Carolina Trump. Ivanka Trump is married to Jared Kushner, and they have three children: Arabella Kushner, Joseph Kushner, and Theodore Kushner. Tiffany Trump welcomed her first child, Alexander Boulos, in 2025 with her husband, Michael Boulos."

      "text": "The D.C. attorney general on Friday sued the Trump administration over its federal takeover of the D.C. police force and its deployment of national guard troops into the city, arguing that the effort is \"unlawful\" and exceeds Trump's authority as commander in chief.\nThe lawsuit, filed Friday by D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, challenges Trump's executive order to temporarily federalize D.C. under Section 740 of the D.C. Home Rule Act, and Attorney General Pam Bondi's more recent order Thursday that seeks to install the DEA head as the emergency commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Force \u2014 arguing the moves are unprecedented, \"brazenly unlawful,\" and could \"wreak operational havoc\" on the Metropolitan Police Department.\nIn the filing, submitted to federal court in D.C., Schwalb urged the court to block both of the administration's orders, stating that the Trump administration's temporary takeover of D.C. police under Section 740 of the D.C. Home Rule Act \"does not authorize this brazen usurpation of the District\u2019s authority over its own government.\"\n\"They infringe on the District\u2019s right to self-governance and put the safety of DC residents and visitors at risk.\" he said.\nSchwalb also asked the court to grant emergency relief in the form of a temporary restraining order, or TRO, that would block Trump's order from taking force immediately while the court considers the merits of the case.\nThe case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, a Biden appointee, who in turn ordered both parties to appear in court Friday afternoon at 2 p.m. to weigh the emergency request.\nThe position is likely to land Reyes, who also presided over a lawsuit involving Trump's ban on transgender service members, back in Trump's crosshairs for the second time in less than eight months.\nReyes issued a preliminary injunction blocking Trump's ban on transgender service members from taking force, prompting Trump allies to label her as an \"activist\" judge, even after the injunction was overturned by a higher court.\nThe Justice Department also filed a misconduct complaint against Reyes earlier this year, citing her remarks towards government lawyers. Reyes has something of a reputation for her sharp, fast-paced style of questioning, however, and employed it readily as she grilled lawyers for the plaintiffs as well. The chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Sri Srinivasan, has never taken action on the complaint.\nMetropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith said in a court filing Friday that Trump's order is \"endangering the safety of the public and law enforcement officers.\"\n\"In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive,\" she said in the court filing seeking emergency intervention.\nThe lawsuit comes five days after Trump issued an executive order to temporarily federalize D.C., which he described as an effort to \"reestablish law order and public safety\" and temporarily federalize the city, which he described Monday as \"one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the world.\"\nThat order included deploying hundreds of D.C. National Guard troops into the city, and temporarily taking federal control of D.C.'s police force.\nTRUMP IS THREATENING TO 'FEDERALIZE' DC WITH NATIONAL GUARD AND MORE. HERE'S HOW THAT COULD PLAY OUT\nOn Thursday, Bondi expanded on that effort by ordering the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, be installed as the \"emergency\" commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Force, sidelining current Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith.\n\"By declaring a hostile takeover of MPD, the Administration is abusing its limited, temporary authority under the Home Rule Act, infringing on the District\u2019s right to self-governance and putting the safety of DC residents and visitors at risk,\" Schwalb said in a statement Friday.\n\"The Administration\u2019s unlawful actions are an affront to the dignity and autonomy of the 700,000 Americans who call DC home,\" he added. \"This is the gravest threat to Home Rule that the District has ever faced, and we are fighting to stop it.\"\nThe lawsuit caps a heated week in the nation\u2019s capital, as President Donald Trump and White House officials have assailed what they describe as a \"ridiculous\" amount of crime in D.C.\nWhite House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told NewsNation in an interview earlier this week that Washington, D.C., \"is more violent than Baghdad.\" They have alleged recent data \u2014 which found a 26% decline in violent crime between 2023 and 2024 \u2014 has been \"manipulated\" or underreported.\nJust hours earlier, the Trump-linked America First Legal Foundation (AFL) filed a FOIA request seeking all crime records and data compiled by the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, as part of an effort to scrutinize information and crime statistics at issue.\nMeanwhile, critics have excoriated Trump\u2019s executive order, which they argue is not based on an uptick in crime or an \"emergency\" \u2014 but rather, serves as justification for the administration to push through its sweeping executive action outside the normal policymaking process.\nNorm Eisen, the former White House ethics czar under President Barack Obama, told reporters Thursday that Trump\u2019s order in D.C. is the latest in a \"pattern of assaults on the rule of law\" in his second term as president.\nTrump \"has declared a fake emergency\" in D.C., Eisen said. \"There is no \u2018emergency\u2019 upon which this action with MPD or the federal military is predicated\" in D.C., Eisen said. \"In fact, crime has been dropping in D.C.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nTrump in March signed an executive order, \"Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force,\" designed to address issues with a city he has long derided as \"filthy,\" \"horribly run\" and \"crime-ridden,\" among other things.\n\"We want to have a great, safe capital,\" he told reporters earlier this year. \"And we\u2019re going to have it. And that includes cleanliness, and it includes other things.\""

She also suspended a June 2024 general order limiting inquiries into immigration status and an October 2023 general order preventing arrests solely for federal immigration warrants.\n\"To the extent that provisions in this order conflict with any existing MPD directives, those directives are hereby rescinded,\" Bondi concluded in her order on Thursday.\nThe order comes after President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Monday declaring a crime emergency in the nation's capital and announcing a federal takeover of the police department.\nSince then, federal law enforcement and the National Guard have been visible throughout the district. On Wednesday night alone, numerous agencies arrested 45 people \u2013 29 of them illegal immigrants \u2013 as part of the major crime crackdown.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Residents of the District of Columbia, the thousands of Americans who commute into the District for work every day, and the millions of tourists from all over the world who visit our nation's capital have a right to feel safe and to be free from the scourge of violent crime,\" Bondi's order stated."

      "text": "Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) head and new overseer of D.C. police Terry Cole outlined the Trump administration's \"unified effort\" for reducing violent crime in the nation\u2019s capital after meeting with the police chief Tuesday.\n\"We cannot afford to turn a blind eye,\" Cole told \"The Story.\" \"We have tremendous cooperation, tremendous intel sharing, and what's most encouraging, the police are looking forward to doing their job again.\"\nPresident Donald Trump federalized Washington, D.C.\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) Monday, enabling federal agencies and the National Guard to supervise local police but not make arrests themselves. On Monday night, 850 National Guard officers patrolled the streets of the capital.\nCole touted the arrests that followed Trump\u2019s \"Liberation Day\" announcement.\n\"Just in the last two days, we've had 60 arrests that are very impactful. We've taken 17 firearms off the streets. Last night, we arrested somebody that was wanted for a murder,\" he shared.\nTRUMP CLAIMS DC CRIMES TROUNCE STATS FROM NOTORIOUSLY VIOLENT CITIES WORLDWIDE\nThe DEA administrator went on to clarify how federal agents will work \"hand in hand\" with MPD.\n\"Starting tonight, we will be embedded with the Metropolitan Police Department,\" Cole announced. \"You will also see an increase of activity, patrol activity in certain sectors, to go after the violent criminal offenders that are the drivers of this crime.\"\nAs Democratic critics of the federal takeover cite statistics of violent crime being at a \"30-year low\" in the nation\u2019s capital, Cole insists people \"do not feel safe,\" and police officers \"do not feel empowered.\"\nIt is \"frustrating\" for police to come across repeat youth offenders with guns, Cole lamented. While the Trump administration would need to \"change the code\" to hold even juveniles accountable, Cole said federal agents are eager to help support D.C.'s law enforcement.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"I think that there's a lot of dynamics with the D.C. City Council that are concerning,\" Cole noted. \"I've been receiving phone calls from all over the country of other federal agents that wanna fly in and help. They wanna be part of making D.C. safe again.\""

  "argos_summary": "Judge Ana Reyes ordered the Trump administration and the District of Columbia to negotiate a deal limiting the DEA head Terry Cole\u2019s authority over the Metropolitan Police Department, or face a temporary restraining order. The ruling comes after D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb sued to block the federal takeover, arguing it violates the Home Rule Act and the district\u2019s right to self\u2011governance. While the federal takeover remains in place for 30 days, Cole must now act through Mayor Muriel Bowser, who must defer to him for directives. Protesters and critics argue the administration\u2019s \u201ccrime emergency\u201d is unfounded, citing declining violent crime statistics. The judge will address broader legal questions in a hearing next week.",
