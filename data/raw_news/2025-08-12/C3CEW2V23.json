  "content": "All statements and other information contained in this press release about anticipated future events may constitute forward-looking information under Canadian securities laws (\u201cforward-looking statements\u201d). Forward-looking statements are often, but not always, identified by the use of words such as \u201cseek\u201d, \u201canticipate\u201d, \u201cbelieve\u201d, \u201cplan\u201d, \u201cestimate\u201d, \u201cexpect\u201d, \u201ctargeted\u201d, \u201coutlook\u201d, \u201con track\u201d and \u201cintend\u201d and statements that an event or result \u201cmay\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d, \u201cshould\u201d, \u201ccould\u201d, \u201cwould\u201d or \u201cmight\u201d occur or be achieved and other similar expressions. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included herein are forward-looking statements, including statements in respect of the strategic review process, the ability to preserve capital, the availability of strategic alternatives, achieving production at the Project, the ability of the Company to accomplish its business objectives and future plans, development and operations of the Company. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements, including risks related to potential defaults under the Company\u2019s credit facilities and stream agreements; the need for future waivers or forbearance agreements from the secured creditors of the Company; the inability to negotiate strategic alternatives or access additional capital; business and economic conditions in the mining industry generally; fluctuations in commodity prices and currency exchange rates; uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to development, production, costs and expenses, and health, safety and environmental risks; uncertainties relating to interpretation of drill results and the geology, continuity and grade of mineral deposits; the need for cooperation of government agencies and indigenous groups in the exploration and development of Ascot\u2019s properties and the issuance of required permits; the need to obtain additional financing to finance operations and uncertainty as to the availability and terms of future financing and the timing thereof; the possibility of delay in future plans and uncertainty of meeting anticipated program milestones; uncertainty as to timely availability of permits and other governmental approvals; the need for TSX approval, and other regulatory approvals and other risk factors as detailed from time to time in Ascot\u2019s filings with Canadian securities regulators, available on Ascot\u2019s profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca including the Annual Information Form of the Company in the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d. Forward-looking statements are based on assumptions made with regard to: the estimated costs and timelines associated with the development plans; the ability to maintain throughput and production levels at the Big Missouri mine and the Premier Northern Lights mine; the grade of mineral resources and mineral reserves; the ability of the Company to convert inferred mineral resources to other categories; the ability of the Company to reduce mining dilution; the ability to reduce capital costs; the ability of the Company to raise additional financing; and compliance with the covenants in Ascot\u2019s credit agreements. Forward-looking statements are based on estimates and opinions of management at the date the statements are made. Although Ascot believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements and/or information are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements since Ascot can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Ascot does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements, other than as required by applicable laws. The forward-looking information contained in this news release is expressly qualified by this cautionary statement.",

These statements are often referred to as forward-looking statements by words such as \"seek\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\",, \"plan\", \"expect\", \"estimate\",, and \"on track\", and \"evaluation\".
