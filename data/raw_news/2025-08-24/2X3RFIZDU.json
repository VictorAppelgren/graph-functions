  "title": "US Open's richest player has own tactic to avoid 'awkward encounters'",
  "description": "Jessica Pegula has revealed the tactic she uses when heading to the practice courts at tournaments, as the US Open kicks off in New York.",
  "content": "Jessica Pegula claims that \"putting the pressure on\" while her tennis rivals are practicing is her secret way of getting onto the courts earlier. The US Open star, who has a net worth of almost \u00a315million and is due to inherit a whopping \u00a35.5billion fortune, has detailed the tactic she uses to get onto the practice courts on time. The 31-year-old is set to face Mayar Sherif in the first round of the US Open, and will likely be getting in some final hits in New York as she aims for his first Grand Slam title. The American came agonisingly close in 2024, reaching the final but was defeated 7-5, 7-5 by world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka to the trophy. However, Pegula's interesting way to get her practice shots in on time could be the difference maker ahead of her showdown in the final major tournament of the season.\n\nSpeaking to Tennis World USA, the incredibly rich tennis star believes that the trick to making sure people exit court quick is by placing some tension as you wait for your turn. Pegula said: \"I always kind of like to put the pressure on a little bit, because I feel like there are maybe some players that maybe aren't paying attention or don't know and they kind of linger. \"Sometimes when it's tough to get courts, you're like, 'Okay, it's my time. You need to get off.'\" However, while this decision could lead Pegula into some uncomfortable situations with her tennis rivals, the star claims that she is yet to have a showdown with any opponent while using this tactic.\n\nPegula added: \"But in my experience I have never really had too many awkward encounters. Some girls or guys even are pretty chill. \"Like, 'No, take your time, I'm still waiting for someone. You want to hit one more?' Maybe you ended on a bad shot. They are like, 'Go ahead, hit one more good one before you end.'\" To be the first to receive the latest tennis news, join our WhatsApp community or tennis newsletter The tennis star will be hoping that practice makes perfect as she heads into the Grand Slam this week, with her first round match-up slated for just after 1am UK time on Sunday night in the Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\nSpeaking to CNN Sports during her mixed doubles journey with British tennis star Jack Draper \u2013 which ended at the semi-final stage thanks to Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud \u2013 Pegula says theres no place like home at the tournament. She added: \"I love playing in New York, it\u2019s so much fun. \"The energy there is really honestly unmatched, especially being an American and being able to play there. And not only play there, but have good results there and being able to go deep is something that is unlike anything else, being in New York City. So that\u2019s always what I look forward to. \"It can be very hectic, but at the same time, it\u2019s fun and rewarding and I just feel like every time I\u2019m there, it\u2019s just something special. I grew up going to that tournament and watching as a kid, so being able to play there on the biggest stages is just the best part about it.\"",

      "text": "The roar of a partisan home crowd can often be enough to lift tennis players out of precarious positions and help carry them to victory.\nThough perhaps not quite as vociferous as the French Open crowd, fans at the US Open have earned the grand slam a reputation as arguably the loudest tournament on the ATP and WTA Tours.\nThat\u2019s particularly true if an American is playing at Arthur Ashe Stadium, the largest arena at any of the four grand slams. Frances Tiafoe said in 2023 that the capacity 23,000 fans \u201cfelt like 23 million\u201d when they were cheering him on.\nAnother American to have heard that roar is Jessica Pegula, who last year reached the US Open final before falling in two close sets to Aryna Sabalenka.\nFor the Buffalo native, there is no place on tour quite like Flushing Meadows during the US Open.\n\u201cI love playing in New York, it\u2019s so much fun,\u201d Pegula told CNN Sports. \u201cThe energy there is really honestly unmatched, especially being an American and being able to play there.\n\u201cAnd not only play there, but have good results there and being able to go deep is something that is unlike anything else, being in New York City. So that\u2019s always what I look forward to.\n\u201cIt can be very hectic, but at the same time, it\u2019s fun and rewarding and I just feel like every time I\u2019m there, it\u2019s just something special. I grew up going to that tournament and watching as a kid, so being able to play there on the biggest stages is just the best part about it.\u201d\nRepping the Bills\nPegula\u2019s father, Terry, and mother, Kim, are the owners of the NHL\u2019s Buffalo Sabres and the NFL\u2019s Buffalo Bills, two of New York State\u2019s major professional sports franchises. In particular, her ties to football only further endear her to the US Open crowd and Pegula has embraced it, often writing messages to the Bills on camera lenses when she wins on tour.\n\u201cI love being able to connect with Bills fans,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing from Buffalo, tennis is not a massive sport there and to see how many fans I\u2019ve gained just because of their connection with the Bills and I don\u2019t know if they feel like I\u2019m on the team as well?\n\u201cThey feel like they have to root for me, but it\u2019s still much fun and being able to hopefully make a lot of football fans tennis fans, which I think is really cool. Having that crossover effect, hearing the \u2018Go Bills\u2019 and seeing them all come, especially to New York.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool, again, to see that kind of crossover effect into a totally different sport.\u201d\nPegula says she knows a lot of the players on the team now and, sometimes, the coaches will text to congratulate her after a win.\n\u201cIt kind of feels like we\u2019re just one giant family, you know, out there competing and trying to win,\u201d she adds. \u201cSo it\u2019s awesome.\u201d\nPlaying for her mother\nIn June 2022, Pegula\u2019s family was shaken after her mother went into cardiac arrest and was rushed to hospital. The tennis star later revealed in an article for The Players\u2019 Tribune that her sister gave their mother CPR until the ambulance arrived and \u201csaved her life.\u201d\nDespite the ordeal, Pegula still competed at Wimbledon that summer and later that year went on to win her first WTA 1000 title at the Guadalajara Open, which she dedicated to her mother.\n\u201cThe one thing I have learned about tennis is I feel like it\u2019s taught me throughout my whole life,\u201d she said. \u201cEven before all of those things \u2026 life, the ups and downs and challenges and tennis being individual, it really teaches you a lot of things.\n\u201cGoing through a lot different injuries taught me a lot a different things and then with my mom\u2019s health scare, I felt like all those things I went through prepped me a lot for handling that.\n\u201cAnd even though tennis will always come second to family, at the same time, I felt like it prepared me and helped me navigate and learn so many different challenges \u2013 and it still continues to this day.\u201d"
