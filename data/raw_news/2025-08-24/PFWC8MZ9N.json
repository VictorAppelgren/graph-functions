  "content": "With less than an hour to go before launch, SpaceX scrubbed the 10th launch of the Starship \u2014 the largest rocket ever to fly \u2014 on Sunday.\n\nThe scrub came as a big disappointment for the many people watching in person close to the launch site at SpaceX\u2019s Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas, as well as for those watching online. The company said it needed time \u201cto troubleshoot an issue with ground systems,\u201d and has yet to announce a new launch schedule for the 121-meter-tall rocket.\n\nStill, much earlier in the day, at 2:45 a.m. ET, SpaceX managed to launch its 33rd commercial resupply mission to the International Space Station (ISS) from Cape Canaveral in Florida. The mission used SpaceX\u2019s workhorse Falcon 9 rocket and a Dragon spacecraft carrying more than 5,000 pounds of supplies for the orbital outpost. Generating just 1.7 million pounds of thrust at launch \u2014 compared to the 17 million produced by the mighty Starship \u2014 the Falcon 9 may lack the spectacle of SpaceX\u2019s next-gen rocket, but it has a level of reliability that Starship engineers are keen to match.\n\nYou can watch the Falcon 9 lift off in the video clip below:\n\nAround eight minutes after launch, the first-stage booster returned to a droneship waiting in the ocean just off the coast of Florida. Here\u2019s some footage showing the booster touching down.\n\nThe perfect landing means the booster can now be refurbished and used for another flight.\n\nSunday\u2019s mission marked the seventh flight of this particular booster, having previously launched O3b mPOWER-E, Crew-10, Bandwagon-3, O3b mPOWER-D, and two Starlink missions.\n\nThe Dragon will take about 28 hours to reach the space station, where it\u2019s expected to dock on Monday at around 7:30 a.m. ET. Besides delivering food and science experiments for the crew, the capsule will also perform a reboost operation to demonstrate its ability to help sustain the station\u2019s altitude, which slips over time.\n\nThe Dragon will remain docked at the ISS for about four months, after which it\u2019ll return to Earth with research equipment and cargo, splashing down off the coast of California.",

      "text": "Barring any last-minute technical issues, it\u2019s really only the weather that can cause problems for SpaceX\u2019s Starship launch on Sunday, August 24. So, how\u2019s it looking?\nThe weather forecasts for SpaceX\u2019s Starbase launch site near Boca Chica, Texas, appear to be looking good for Sunday\u2019s launch of the most powerful rocket ever built, which is targeted for 7:30 p.m. ET.\nAs of Saturday morning, The Weather Channel suggests it\u2019ll be \u201cpartly cloudy\u201d at Starbase at launch time, with only a 12% chance of rain and only light winds in the area.\nAccuWeather also expects light winds and puts the chances of rain slightly higher, but not at a level that should trouble the SpaceX team organizing Sunday\u2019s launch.\nThe team will also be closely monitoring factors such as upper-level winds, wind shear, cloud layers, and any storm activity in the area and further away along the rocket\u2019s ascent path. The fact that up to now SpaceX has said nothing about any concerns bodes well for Sunday\u2019s planned liftoff.\nIf there are any changes to the schedule, whether due to technical issues or inclement weather, SpaceX will announce them first on its X account. We\u2019ll update here, too, just as soon as we can.\nIf you\u2019re interested in watching a livestream of the SpaceX\u2019s 10th launch of its Starship rocket, Digital Trends has all the details you need.\nThe 121-meter-tall rocket creates a massive 17 million pounds of thrust when it leaves the launchpad, more than any other rocket in history.\nAfter the first-stage Super Heavy booster separates from the upper-stage Starship spacecraft, the booster will attempt a controlled a landing in the sea rather than return to the launch site (in spectacular fashion!) as it has done in several of its previous flights.\nThe spacecraft\u2019s flight, meanwhile, will conduct several experiments focused on enabling the vehicle to return to the launch site on a future flight, such as testing alternative materials for the tiles protecting the vehicle during reentry. It will also deploy eight Starlink simulators.\n\u201cFlight tests continue to provide valuable learnings to inform the design of the next generation Starship and Super Heavy vehicles,\u201d SpaceX said.\nNASA will be watching Sunday\u2019s test closely as it plans to use the rocket for crew and cargo flights to the moon, and possibly even Mars, in the coming years."

      "text": "SpaceX has called off Sunday\u2019s launch attempt of the Starship rocket. The team halted the countdown clock with 40 minutes to go and then scrubbed the launch a short while later.\nThe plan had been to launch the Starship on its 10th test flight at 7:30 p.m. ET on Sunday, August 24, and everything was looking good at the launch site in Starbase, near Boca Chica,Texas. But then SpaceX posted a message on its X account confirming the news that no one wanted to hear.\n\u201cStanding down from today\u2019s tenth flight of Starship to allow time to troubleshoot an issue with ground systems,\u201d SpaceX said in the message. It\u2019s yet to say when it will try again for launch.\nThe 121-meter-tall Starship, which comprises the first-stage Super Heavy booster and upper-stage Starship spacecraft, packs a colossal 17 million pounds of thrust at launch, making it the most powerful rocket ever to fly. The vehicle, which NASA is planning to use for crew and cargo missions to the moon, and possibly even to Mars, first launched in April 2023. The nine test flights to date have produced mixed results, though data from the tests has allowed SpaceX engineers to refine the design to edge the vehicle toward full certification.\nHad Sunday\u2019s launch gone ahead, the Super Heavy booster would have made a controlled landing in the ocean rather than return to the launch site as it has done in several of its earlier test flights. Notably, the booster will fly for the first time with three grid fins instead of the usual four \u2014 part of a new design that gives the fins a surface area about 50% larger than the previous design. SpaceX recently shared a photo showing their enormous size. Increasing their size allows the rocket to return to Earth at a more extreme angle, allowing for greater fuel efficiency, among other advantages.\nOn the 10th flight, whenever it takes place, the upper-stage spacecraft will perform a number of experiments aimed at enabling the vehicle to return to the launch site on a future flight. They include testing alternative materials for the heat-resistant tiles that protect the spacecraft during reentry.\nOnce SpaceX reveals a new launch schedule, we\u2019ll update here and also on our \u201chow to watch the launch\u201d page."

The Starship, the world\u2019s most powerful rocket, was scheduled to launch from Boca Chica, Texas, amid favorable weather forecasts. The Falcon 9 booster landed safely on a droneship, marking its seventh flight, and the Dragon is expected to dock with the ISS in about 28 hours. NASA will continue to monitor the Starship tests as it plans future crew and cargo missions to the Moon and Mars. The company has not yet announced a new launch date for the Starship.",
