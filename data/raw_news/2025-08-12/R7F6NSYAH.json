  "description": "The free trade deal signed last month will open India's vast government procurement market to UK suppliers - but it will not be easy.",
  "content": "A standout feature of the India-UK free trade agreement signed last month was the Narendra Modi government's decision to open India's vast government procurement market to UK suppliers.\n\nThis typically includes a range of things the government buys - from goods and services to contracts for public works such as roads.\n\nSome 40,000 high-value tenders worth \u00a338bn from federal ministries will now be open to bidding for UK businesses in strategic sectors like transport, green energy and infrastructure - areas which have thus far been heavily protected from foreign competition.\n\nThe access is unprecedented, trade experts say.\n\nIt is \"far greater\" than what India had offered in its earlier agreement with the United Arab Emirates and \"sets a new benchmark\", Ajay Srivastava of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think-tank, told the BBC.\n\nUnder the agreement, UK firms bidding for Indian government contracts in specified areas will be treated almost on par with Indian suppliers and also have real-time access to information on forthcoming public tenders and procurement opportunities.\n\nAlso, goods from the UK made with just 20% domestic input can now be supplied to the Indian government, allowing UK companies the flexibility to source up to 80% of the parts or raw material from other countries and still qualify for procurement preference in India.\n\nThe minimum contract value at which these firms can bid for government projects has also been sharply reduced as a result of which \"UK companies can now bid on a wide range of lower-value projects - such as rural roads, solar equipment for schools, or IT systems for government offices - that were previously out of reach\", said Mr Srivastava.\n\nBut for British companies, realising this opportunity on the ground will be easier said than done, several experts told the BBC.\n\nWhile UK suppliers are eligible to participate as Class-II local suppliers, Indian companies will continue to get preferential treatment as Class-I suppliers, says Dr Arpita Mukherjee, a trade expert with the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.\n\nMoreover, pricing plays a key role in winning contracts, and \"UK companies tend to have higher prices\" compared with Indian companies, which will be a major challenge for them, she adds.\n\nA more significant deterrent will be delayed payments and difficult contract enforcement, which are \"major legacy issues when it comes to public procurement in India\", says Srijan Shukla of the Observer Research Foundation think-tank.",

  "summary": "The India-UK free trade agreement, signed last month, has allowed the Narendra Modi government to open India's government procurement market to UK suppliers. Approximately 40,000 high-value tenders worth \u00a338bn from federal ministries will now be open to bidding for UK businesses in strategic sectors such as transport, green energy, and infrastructure. The access is described as unprecedented, surpassing what India had offered in its earlier agreement with the United Arab Emirates.

      "text": "Four things you need to know about UK-India trade deal\nThe UK and India have signed a trade deal to make it cheaper and easier to buy and sell goods and services to one another.\nThe hope is that the agreement will benefit the economies of both countries.\nSir Keir Starmer and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi together signed the agreement which the UK Prime Minister said was \"a landmark moment for both of our countries\".\nHere's a quick guide to what's been agreed and what it could mean for you.\nWhat has been agreed?\nThe UK has lowered taxes on goods imported from India including:\n- clothing and footwear\n- food products including frozen prawns\n- jewellery and gems\n- some cars\nIndia has cut taxes on goods imported from the UK including:\n- cosmetics\n- scotch whisky and gin\n- soft drinks\n- higher-value cars\n- food including lamb, salmon, chocolate and biscuits\n- medical devices\n- aerospace\n- electrical machinery\nThe deal will also allow British firms to compete for more services contracts in India.\nWhat will be the impact on people in the UK and India?\nThe trade deal won't come into force for up to a year, so don't expect to notice any immediate changes.\nOver time though, the UK government says lowering tariffs on the likes of clothing, jewellery, and frozen prawns \"could\" lead to cheaper prices and more choice.\nThis deal could also be a big win for UK businesses which manufacture the goods which have seen tariffs slashed, such as car makers and whisky distillers.\nFor example, tariffs on whisky and gin being imported to India from the UK will be halved from 150% to 75% before reducing to 40% by the 10th year of the deal.\nCar tariffs will fall from more than 100% to 10%.\nThat will provide a boost to those two industries as it will mean Indian companies wanting to import those products will pay less import charges than before.\nIf businesses end up exporting more goods to India and make higher profits, this could lead to them spending more on hiring staff, investing and also paying more tax.\nIn India, consumers could see much more choice among the goods which have been included under the deal. Clothing manufacturing businesses and jewellers will also be able to access the UK market which will boost their margins.\nHow important is this for the UK and India?\nThis deal has been a long time in the making, with on-off negotiations going on for some three years.\nHowever, it appears US President Donald Trump's introduction of tariffs on goods entering America has prompted other world leaders to consider striking free-trade deals with one another.\nThe UK's deal with India is its third biggest after its agreements with Australia and Japan. For context, the UK has signed trade deals and agreements in principle with about 70 countries and one with the EU.\nThe EU is the biggest trade partner for both the UK and India. Therefore, a free trade agreement between India and the EU would be more significant than the one with the UK. Both India and the EU have said they aim to finalise this by the end of 2025.\nLast year trade between the UK and India totalled \u00a342bn. The UK government has said this deal would boost that trade by an additional \u00a325.5bn a year by 2040.\nIn what it calls the Impact Assessment of the free trade agreement with India, the government said that over time it will boost the UK economy by \u00a34.8bn. This is a tiny proportion of the UK economy which was worth \u00a32.8 trillion last year.\nHowever, India is also forecast to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years. It is also home to 1.45 billion people - about 20 times the population of the UK - which is a lot of potential customers.\nThe UK is also a high priority trading partner for India, which has an ambitious target to grow exports by $1tn (\u00a3750bn) by 2030.\nWhat does this mean for visas?\nOne of the reasons the UK India free trade deal has taken so long to reach is that India had made big demands about visas for Indian professionals and students to work and study abroad.\nThe British government said it does not include any change in immigration policy, including towards Indian students studying in the UK.\nBut it does includes a three-year exemption on the social security paid by Indian employees working in the UK, on short-term visas. They will only pay social security contributions in their home country.\nThis agreement, known as the Double Contribution Convention (DCC), is designed to ensure social security contributions are not made in more than one country.\nThe UK has similar reciprocal DCC agreements with 17 other countries including the EU, the US and South Korea.\nBusiness Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it did not mean Indian workers would be cheaper to hire than British staff.\n\"There is no tax advantage for hiring an Indian worker over a British worker,\" he told the BBC.\nExtra costs for visas and the NHS surcharge would mean \"you'd actually pay more for an Indian worker\", he said, adding \"no-one is being undercut\"."

UK firms will be treated almost equally to Indian suppliers and can bid on a wider range of projects, although challenges such as pricing and contract enforcement remain. The deal also includes reduced tariffs on various goods exchanged between the two countries, potentially boosting trade significantly over the coming years.",
