  "content": "If you\u2019re looking for the Quordle answer for Saturday, August 16, 2025, read on\u2014I\u2019ll share some clues, tips, and strategies, and finally the solution. Beware, there are spoilers below for August 16, Quordle #1300! Keep scrolling if you want some hints (and then the answer) to today\u2019s Quordle game. (If you play , , or , check out our hints for those games, too.)\n\nQuordle lives . A new puzzle goes live every day. If you\u2019ve never played, it\u2019s on The New York Times\u2019 daily Wordle game, in which you have a limited number of attempts to guess a five-letter mystery word. In Quordle, though, you\u2019re simultaneously solving four Wordle-style puzzles, and each of your guesses gets applied to the four puzzles simultaneously. Due to the increased difficulty, Quordle grants you nine guesses (12 if you play on \u201cChill\u201d mode, or eight if you play on \u201cExtreme\u201d), rather than Wordle\u2019s six.\n\nTo start, guess a five-letter word. The letters of the word in each of the four quadrants will turn green if they\u2019re correct, yellow if you have the right letter in the wrong place, or gray if the letter isn\u2019t in that secret word at all.\n\nReady for the hints? Let\u2019s go!\n\nCan you give me a hint for today\u2019s Quordle?\n\u2022 None Upper right: Might make your windows rattle.\n\nDoes today\u2019s Quordle have any double or repeated letters?\n\nWhat letters do today\u2019s Quordle words start with?\n\nWhat letters do today\u2019s Quordle words end with?\n\nWhat is the solution to today\u2019s Quordle?\n\nMy starter words, SLATE and MOUND, get me a good bit of the way there today.\n\nThe bottom left might be SLIME. Oops, I messed up: It\u2019s SLIDE.\n\nThe bottom right is probably ELITE. Yep.\n\nThe upper left could be OWING. Yeah!\n\nI thought the upper right might be SUAVE, but there\u2019s no S. Maybe it starts with a QU. QUAKE? Yay.\n\nThe best starter words for Quordle\n\nWhat should you play for that first guess? We can look to Wordle for some general guidelines.\n\nThe best starters tend to contain common letters, to increase the chances of getting yellow and green squares to guide your guessing. (And if you get all grays when guessing common letters, that\u2019s still excellent information to help you rule out possibilities.) There isn\u2019t a single \u201cbest\u201d starting word, but The New York Times\u2019s has suggested starting with one of these:\n\nMeanwhile, an MIT analysis that you\u2019ll eliminate the most possibilities in the first round by starting with one of these:\n\nOther good picks might be ARISE or ROUND. Words like ADIEU and AUDIO get more vowels in play, but you could argue that it\u2019s better to start with an emphasis on consonants, using a starter like RENTS or CLAMP. Choose your strategy, and see how it plays out.\n\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to yesterday's Quordle.",

The difficulty of this game is higher than Wordle's, allowing for nine guesses per player, compared to six in Wordle. The best starter words for Quordle tend to contain common letters to increase your chances of guessing common letters. The solution involves a combination of these words: \"None,\" \"No\", and \"No\".",

      "text": "One thing that sets Wordle apart from other games is that you face a grid with no clues whatsoever at the start. You get to make the first move, and gameplay follows from your choices. Your starting word matters\u2014so what do you choose?\nA few things are obvious. It\u2019s strategic to use five different letters (TRAIN rather than TATTY), and you probably want most or all of the five to be common letters in English; as I\u2019ve explained elsewhere, I use the mnemonic ETAOIN SHRDLU (pronounced like \u201cEdwin Shirdloo\u201d) as my guide.\nBut that still leaves a lot of possibilities, and everybody has their own preferences. Some folks like to get their vowels set as early as possible; AUDIO and ADIEU will get you off to a good start there. Others could care less about the vowels, and would prefer to knock out as many consonants as possible in the first guess: TRASH would be a good starter for that approach. Another equally valid approach is to screw strategy and throw in whatever word is bouncing around in your head that day. I used UNION every day that we were on strike, and never lost.\nWhat the computers say\nWhile only trial and error can tell you what you prefer, computers have been hard at work on calculating the mathematical properties of certain words. The way a computer thinks about this, there are only so many five-letter words that can be valid solutions. (Wordle\u2019s creator chose about 2,300 words for the solution list, leaving out a lot of obscure ones that most of us are happy to ignore.)\nEach time you guess a word and see the resulting colored tiles, that original word list has been divided into two groups: words that could be the answer based on what you now know, and words that definitely cannot. For example, if you guess PLANT and get a green P, we know that PURSE is still possible, but SPARE is not (because it does not start with a P).\nBy that logic, you can score a word based on how well it narrows down the solution space. This turns out to be a difficult problem to figure out whether you have solved it optimally, making it exactly the kind of problem that computer scientists love. A recent paper out of MIT performed an analysis of the ways different guesses can break down the solution space, and claims that with the right strategy, all Wordle games can be solved in five guesses or less. Here are their picks for the best starting words:\nSALET\nREAST\nTRACE\nCRATE\nSLATE\nThat\u2019s in contrast to the New York Times\u2019 WordleBot, which used a reportedly less computationally intensive approach to come up with the following favorite starters:\nCRANE\nTRACE\nSLANT\nCRATE\nCARTE\nHow to follow up a good starter\nChoosing a good starter is just the beginning, of course. Where do you go with your next guess? The authors of the MIT paper helpfully include a tool to help you find the next word to play after SALET. Just take note of your greens and yellows, and find the matching row of colored blocks on page 14. Play the word it tells you, and chances are you\u2019ll be able to solve the puzzle quickly.\nI tried out the chart on a few rounds of Dordle, and can confirm that it narrows down the possibilities very efficiently. (The authors say they have created a website, wordleopt.com, for even easier use, but at the moment it isn\u2019t loading for me.)\nOne problem with this approach is that often the best word to narrow down your possibilities is not, itself, on the 2,300-word list. GHYLL, for example, is never going to be a Wordle solution even though the puzzle accepts it as a word. Is your goal to make sure you never lose? If so, guessing obscure words that narrow down the possibilities is a good strategy. But if your goal is to win in as few guesses as possible, you probably want to give yourself more chances to luck into an early hit. (SALET is not on the word list; guessing SALET and GHYLL means the earliest you could solve is on your third move.)\nPersonally, I like to use a starter that is both itself a valid word, and lends itself to a second guess that also meets starter criteria. For example, I\u2019ve been starting lately with ARISE. I might then follow that up with TOUCH. By the time I\u2019ve played both, I now have information on nine out of the 12 letters in ETAOIN SHRDLU (plus C, which is the next-most-common letter after those). My brain is no supercomputer, but my stats indicate that I\u2019ve solved 35% of all my Wordles in three guesses or less.\nTell me in the comments: What is your favorite starter word? And, most importantly, what factors went into choosing that one?\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to today's Wordle."

      "text": "If you\u2019re looking for the Quordle answer for Friday, August 15, 2025, read on\u2014I\u2019ll share some clues, tips, and strategies, and finally the solution. Beware, there are spoilers below for August 15, Quordle #1299! Keep scrolling if you want some hints (and then the answer) to today\u2019s Quordle game. (If you play Wordle, Connections, or Strands, check out our hints for those games, too.)\nHow to play Quordle\nQuordle lives on the Merriam-Webster website. A new puzzle goes live every day. If you\u2019ve never played, it\u2019s a twist on The New York Times\u2019 daily Wordle game, in which you have a limited number of attempts to guess a five-letter mystery word. In Quordle, though, you\u2019re simultaneously solving four Wordle-style puzzles, and each of your guesses gets applied to the four puzzles simultaneously. Due to the increased difficulty, Quordle grants you nine guesses (12 if you play on \u201cChill\u201d mode, or eight if you play on \u201cExtreme\u201d), rather than Wordle\u2019s six.\nTo start, guess a five-letter word. The letters of the word in each of the four quadrants will turn green if they\u2019re correct, yellow if you have the right letter in the wrong place, or gray if the letter isn\u2019t in that secret word at all.\nReady for the hints? Let\u2019s go!\nCan you give me a hint for today\u2019s Quordle?\nUpper left: Ocean mammal.\nUpper right: Light refractor.\nLower left: Duck.\nLower right: Conical home.\nDoes today\u2019s Quordle have any double or repeated letters?\nUpper left: No.\nUpper right: No.\nLower left: No.\nLower right: Yes, a repeated vowel.\nWhat letters do today\u2019s Quordle words start with?\nUpper left: W\nUpper right: P\nLower left: D\nLower right: T\nWhat letters do today\u2019s Quordle words end with?\nUpper left: E\nUpper right: M\nLower left: E\nLower right: E\nWhat is the solution to today\u2019s Quordle?\nUpper left: WHALE\nUpper right: PRISM\nLower left: DRAKE\nLower right: TEPEE\nHow I solved today\u2019s Quordle\nI\u2019ll start with SLATE and MOUND, as I always do.\nDRAPE might fit the bottom left. One off. The only thing I can think of is DRAKE. OK!\nThe upper right is probably PRISM. Yep.\nMaybe there\u2019s a second E in the upper left, for a word like LEAVE. Nope. That second E worked for the bottom right, though! OK, so the upper left ends in ALE. WHALE? Yep.\nThis last word has to go T-E-P-blank-E, I think. What the heck? Oh, it\u2019s TEPEE.\n\ud83d\ude42 Daily Quordle 1299 7\ufe0f\u20e35\ufe0f\u20e3 4\ufe0f\u20e38\ufe0f\u20e3 m-w.com/games/quordle/ \u2b1c\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\u2b1c\ud83d\udfe9 \ud83d\udfe8\u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c \u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c \ud83d\udfe8\u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c \u2b1c\u2b1c\ud83d\udfe9\u2b1c\ud83d\udfe9 \u2b1c\ud83d\udfe9\u2b1c\ud83d\udfe8\u2b1c \u2b1c\u2b1c\ud83d\udfe9\u2b1c\ud83d\udfe9 \u2b1c\ud83d\udfe9\u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c \u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c \ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe9 \ud83d\udfe8\u2b1c\ud83d\udfe9\u2b1c\ud83d\udfe9 \u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b \ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe9 \u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b \u2b1c\u2b1c\ud83d\udfe9\u2b1c\ud83d\udfe9 \u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9 \u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\ud83d\udfe8 \u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c \ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe9\u2b1c\ud83d\udfe9 \u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9 \ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe9 \u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\ud83d\udfe9 \u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b \ud83d\udfe8\u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c \u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b \u2b1c\ud83d\udfe9\u2b1c\u2b1c\ud83d\udfe9 \u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b \u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\ud83d\udfe9 \u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b \ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe9\nThe best starter words for Quordle\nWhat should you play for that first guess? We can look to Wordle for some general guidelines.\nThe best starters tend to contain common letters, to increase the chances of getting yellow and green squares to guide your guessing. (And if you get all grays when guessing common letters, that\u2019s still excellent information to help you rule out possibilities.) There isn\u2019t a single \u201cbest\u201d starting word, but The New York Times\u2019s Wordle analysis bot has suggested starting with one of these:\nCRANE\nTRACE\nSLANT\nCRATE\nCARTE\nMeanwhile, an MIT analysis found that you\u2019ll eliminate the most possibilities in the first round by starting with one of these:\nSALET\nREAST\nTRACE\nCRATE\nSLATE\nOther good picks might be ARISE or ROUND. Words like ADIEU and AUDIO get more vowels in play, but you could argue that it\u2019s better to start with an emphasis on consonants, using a starter like RENTS or CLAMP. Choose your strategy, and see how it plays out.\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to today's Quordle."

      "text": "Wordle became an instant classic almost as soon as it launched, but its simplicity is also the source of a new problem: what to play when you've already guessed the day's word? Fortunately, the years since Wordle's appearance have blessed us with dozens of other guessing games that borrowed one or more of Wordle\u2019s features\u2014five-letter solutions, or yellow and green squares, or sometimes just the concept of guessing and getting hints to narrow down the possibilities. Here are 16 of the best.\nWaffle\nLet\u2019s start out the list with a cute and friendly game. Waffle puts six different five-letter words in a grid, and you solve it simply by moving the squares around. It\u2019s tricky to get the job done in the given number of swaps, but you\u2019re never going to be too perplexed\u2014all the letters you need are right in front of you.\nFlagle\nI was torn on whether to award the geographical spot on the list to Flagle, which uses country flags, or Worldle, which gives you the outline of the country. When I was first compiling this list, I went with Flagle because there used to be two ways to win: In addition to narrowing down the location of the country, you can also reveal tiles of the country\u2019s flag. Unfortunately, Flagle has removed the feature that tells you how far away you guessed in terms of distance, so it's now just a flag-based game. They're still both great.\nHurdle\nThis is probably the last friendly, straightforward game you\u2019ll see on this list, so enjoy it while it lasts. Hurdle gives you five Wordle-style puzzles each day. You have to solve each to get the next, and then the fifth puzzle gets pre-filled with the four previous solutions as guesses, leaving you just two chances to win the final round.\nAbsurdle\nAbsurdle gets its name because its premise is entirely absurd\u2014and man, does it follow through. The secret word you\u2019re guessing changes to evade your guesses. Its one nod to sportsmanship is that it will abide by its previous hints\u2014so if it tells you that the word contains an R as the first letter, the solution will have an R, but everything else is subject to change. Succeeding at this game means backing the algorithm into a corner until it only has one option left; only then will it admit you won.\nHeardle\nHeardle is the modern version of Name That Tune!, a game show where participants had to identify a song based on just the first few notes. The songs in Heardle are taken from popular playlists, so it\u2019s also a good litmus test for your own pop culture relevance.\nSquabble\nIn Squabble, we have our first competitive Wordle. (We\u2019ll meet another in a minute.) If you think you\u2019re good at guessing words, you now get the chance to prove it against friends or strangers in real time. Guessing wrong subtracts health from your little meter; guessing correctly refills it. The game continues, going to multiple words if needed, until all but one player has been eliminated. This game isn't as popular as it once was, so you may wait a while to find enough players for a game with online strangers, but you can still create a game and share the lobby code with your friends for instant fun.\nMordle\nIf you like Squabble, try the massively multiplayer Mordle. Games can have up to 100 players, but gameplay is simpler because you don\u2019t have to watch their game boards or battle them directly. Just attempt to solve the puzzle yourself, as fast as you can, and find out how many people got to the correct solution before or after you.\nQuordle and other multi-Wordles\nWhen Dordle (the double Wordle) first came on the scene, it seemed nightmarish; you\u2019re supposed to solve two Wordles with the same guesses?! But with practice, it\u2019s not hard at all. And so it escalated from there. Quordle is the sweet spot, in my opinion; four is the perfect number of puzzles to solve at once. But Octordle is also fun, and so are Sedecordle and Duotrigordle. Multi-Wordles appear daunting at first, but with so many grids, almost any guess is going to give you a useful hint somewhere.\nAntiwordle\nAntiwordle is probably the most hellish of all the games on this list, and that\u2019s saying something. The rules are the same as the rules for regular Wordle played on hard mode (where you\u2019re required to reuse correct letter guesses). But the whole idea is that you\u2019re trying to not guess the word. Once you get it right, you lose.\nSemantle\nWord games are, for the most part, games for good spellers. If you can recognize the patterns letters commonly appear in, you\u2019re at an advantage. So if you\u2019ve ever wondered why word games don\u2019t ask you to guess the approximate meaning of a word, Semantle is for you. It\u2019s tough to even begin narrowing it down, but once you do, just aim for words with similar meanings to arrive at the answer.\nWordAll\nAny time you get your green and yellow squares in response to a guess, what the game is really doing is defining and redefining a pool of words that the solution must be in. (All the words that have an E in the second position and a T in them somewhere other than the third, let\u2019s say.) WordAll gives you a half-played game, pauses it there, and asks you to name all the words in that pool. It\u2019s a fun brain exercise, and will probably make you a more strategic Wordle player.\nArtle\nWe\u2019ll back away from words for this one, an art-themed game that shows you snippets of works, all created by the same artist. It\u2019s called Artle, and it will probably teach you things you didn\u2019t know about your favorite artists\u2014and help you discover new ones.\nSquardle\nIf you thought Waffle was cute, Squardle is its evil twin. It\u2019s another crossword-style guessing game, but this time you have to type all your guesses in. That doesn\u2019t sound so bad, until you start trying to make sense of the hints. Each square contains color-coded information about how the letter you guessed fits into the words of the puzzle. Like Microsoft\u2019s Clippy, something intended to be helpful quickly turns confusing and frustrating. Winning this game requires you to use the those hints without letting their proliferation distract you.\nRedactle\nOne word at a time? Six words at a time? Redactle scoffs at all that. It gives you an entire Wikipedia article with most of the words blacked out, in the style of censored government documents. Your job is to guess words; when you guess correctly, those words are revealed in the article. Solving the puzzle means correctly guessing the title of the article\u2014which could be about anything from a historical figure to a mathematical concept.\nTradle\nTradle is a game where you guess a country based on its exports. After each guess, you'll be told how far away the target country is from your guess, and in what direction. Pro tip: Mouse over the little squares under the chart to see different categories of exports. You can get some good clues there\u2014for example, if the vegetable exports are all tropical fruits, you're looking for a tropical country.\nMinute Cryptic\nIt doesn't rhyme with Wordle, but Minute Cryptic is my favorite mini daily word game. It's a game based around guessing one word each day. The fewer guesses it takes you, the better your score. Where it differs from the games above is that it's based on British style \"cryptic crosswords.\" The day's puzzle could be a clue in its own crossword game, but you're just given the one clue as a mini puzzle.\nIf you aren't familiar with cryptics, the idea is that the clue phrase actually contains two different things: a definition of the answer, and a sneaky description of the wordplay you need to do to come up with the answer. For example, you might need to make an anagram of one of the clue words, or reverse a word, or take the initial letters of a phrase, or insert one word inside another. Minute Cryptic is a great introduction to the genre because you can ask for a specific type of hint. You can ask it to highlight the \"indicator\" words (the ones that tell you you'll be taking an anagram, for example), the \"fodder\" words (in that case, the word or words that will get anagrammed), or the definition. You can also reveal the answer one letter at a time.\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to today's Wordle."

      "text": "I like to think of myself as good at Wordle (caring about Wordle is one of my worst personality flaws and I\u2019m embracing it, thank you very much), so I was thrilled to see that the New York Times has a new tool called WordleBot that can grade your performance on any past Wordle.\nIf you\u2019ve played Wordle recently, you can visit the tool in the same browser and it\u2019ll know how you made your guesses\u2014but you can also upload a screenshot of a Wordle you have played in the past. I\u2019m going to introduce you to the bot with some older screenshots, but then we\u2019ll dive into strategy for today\u2019s puzzle, number 293, so either stop reading or go solve it now if you don\u2019t want to see spoilers.\nHow to use WordleBot\nFirst, solve today\u2019s puzzle, and then visit this link. It will guide you through the process. If you want an analysis of an older puzzle or somebody else\u2019s puzzle, take a screenshot. (After you solve a puzzle, the Wordle stats screen will pop up. Hit the \u201cx\u201d and then screenshot the grid. You can also go back to that page any time after solving, so long as the next puzzle isn\u2019t out yet, and it will remember your guesses.)\nThen, swipe through the result screens. The first one gives you an overall score for skill and for luck. The rest step through your guesses, and the bot compares what choices you made to what it would have done.\nHow good is WordleBot at Wordle?\nThe bot cheats, by the way. It calculates how well you\u2019re narrowing down the possibilities, but it knows which 2,309 words are in the official solutions list. The English language actually has more like 13,000 five-letter words; many were just excluded to make the game more interesting, like plurals of four-letter words that don\u2019t tend to be on there, for example. Some obscure words were also left out, as well as a bunch of words that I don\u2019t consider very obscure: FUTON will never be a solution, the bot told me, nor will PORKY, although both are allowed as guesses.\nOn the other hand, at least the bot doesn\u2019t know which puzzles have already been published. When I\u2019m playing, if one of the possibilities is SNOUT but I remember that SNOUT was the solution last week, I can mentally cross it off. The bot has not been given this guidance.\nHow to learn from WordleBot (spoilers ahead!)\nThe most exciting thing about WordleBot is not that it will tell you how skillful you are, but that it can give you tips to be better.\nToday\u2019s puzzle was on the easier side (I and two of my coworkers all solved it in three guesses.) The bot, smug bastard that it is, says it would have solved it in two. (It starts with CRANE.)\nI got an overall skill rating of 93. It liked my opener (STONE), and said my second guess of CHAMP cut the possibilities down to just two. My third guess, then, was lucky.\nI ran staff writer Sarah Showfety\u2019s solution through the bot next. It gave her an overall skill score of just 85, mainly because her second guess of SNARE only brought the solution pool down to three possibilities instead of two. Deputy editor Joel Cunningham got a skill score of 84, and in this case he seems to have been dinged for being too lucky. His opener brought the possible solutions to just 9, and after CLAMP he was down to just one. (We all beat the typical Wordle player, the bot says: The average skill score is 79.)\nJust for fun, I tried today\u2019s puzzle again in another browser and tried my best to play badly. (As we learned from my post about Antiwordle earlier this week, I may not actually be great at Wordle, but I am definitely bad at being bad at it.) It liked my starter, BOGUS, and my follow-up, PARSE. But after that, the little bot was just shaking its head at my bad guesses. I actually had it narrowed down to just four possibilities at that point. My next two, RAISE and SPARE, it said were \u201cwasted\u201d guesses that didn\u2019t add to what we already know. But that\u2019s not actually true: Both gave clues about the position of the letters that were previously yellow, and both included gray letters that I could eliminate as possibilities. I ended up with a skill score of just 22 though, solving the puzzle in five guesses, which fits.\nSo what did we learn? Among other things, we got our starters graded. CRANE is the bot\u2019s pick; it liked Joel\u2019s STERN and Sarah\u2019s ROUTE. All of these will on average narrow down the pool to somewhere between 90 to 100 possibilities. (That number can be higher or lower, though, depending on what the day\u2019s actual solution is. Sometimes you\u2019re just unlucky.)\nSo go ahead and ask the bot how it thinks you did. You might be mad about the answers, but you\u2019ll probably learn something.\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to today's Wordle."
