      "feedback": "The draft has a plausible macro spine (tariff regime, Nvidia-led AI cycle, autos capex) but the reasoning is not yet a world-class synthesis: the causal chain from tariff policy to capex, productivity, inflation, and risk premia is asserted but not rigorously mapped, quantified, or tested across scenarios, and several numbers are inconsistent or underutilized (e.g., the ACMR/2025 figure and the Ford 22PL3Q360 metrics) while the citation discipline is uneven. Actionable edits: (1) replace the narrative with a clean Regime A/B/C framework (base/tilt/defensive) with explicit probabilities and a 3–5 year horizon, anchored to the policy-and-SDR signals in SGB2PAZGK and the Fed framework RHFWI02JT; (2) build a first-principles causal chain: tariffs and border pass-through drive input costs and margins in autos/durables, which shapes capex and productivity; reshoring/semis data-center AI spend feeds supply-side productivity and shifts inflation/real rates, which reprice risk premia; link Nvidia momentum (STBVARD8F) as the timing amplifier of capex cycles; (3) fix and lock numbers: resolve the contradictory “2025 revenue midpoint ≈ $900m” vs. “low billions” for ACMR; keep Ford EV metrics (losses ~ $1.3B; adj. EBIT ~ 4.3%; ROIC ~ 10.1%; 2.5% revenue CAGR 2014–2024) and ACMR anchor from 22PL3Q360; present a single coherent baseline with plausible bands; (4) quantify sensitivities and provide explicit ranges for key levers (tariff pass-through, margins for autos/durables, impact of a 25–50 bp shift in real rates, Nvidia-driven capex cadence) using only material inputs from the sources; (5) tighten citation discipline: tie every claim to a source ID (SGB2PAZGK for regime transmittals, STBVARD8F for Nvidia momentum, RHFWI02JT for tariff/margin linkages, 22PL3Q360 for Ford/ACMR figures) and explicitly reconcile any conflicts; (6) add explicit catalysts/triggers and invalidation rules: tariff-authority court rulings, pace of deregulation/governance reforms, Jackson Hole signals, and semis capex cadence; (7) produce a concise watch-list of decisive signals (4–6 items) with thresholds and testable outcomes; (8) ensure the analysis conforms to SECTION FOCUS by clearly enumerating cross-topic drivers first, then the mechanism and direction, then the watch-list, ensuring the base-case remains constructive but clearly fragile if the triggers fail; and (9) trim hedges and clichés, deliver in a tight, cohesive paragraph (no loose claims) with a single, internally consistent narrative and footnoted IDs only.",
