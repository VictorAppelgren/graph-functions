  "title": "Israel\u2019s Pain Has Blinded It to Gaza\u2019s Suffering",
  "description": "Multiple factors have caused the starvation ravaging Gaza. But Israel must accept that its actions are the main cause.",
  "content": "A stream of images of starving children in the Gaza Strip have captured the world\u2019s attention, deepening anger over Israel\u2019s actions in the territory and furthering its isolation among nations. But the narrative is different inside Israel. The story of hunger in Gaza has hardly registered compared with other crises and tragedies: the grinding announcements of the deaths of young Israeli soldiers; the political upheaval over the exemption of ultra-Orthodox Jews from the draft and government\u2019s efforts to fire key democratic and professional gatekeepers; the haunting videos of emaciated young hostages, one forced to dig his own grave on camera, after nearly two years in hellish captivity. Worse than showing indifference, many Israelis deny the clear realities: that Gaza is in chaos and teetering on the edge of widespread starvation, and that Israel has played a major role in bringing about this terrible state. The attitude is projected from the top. \u201cThere is no starvation in Gaza,\u201d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has declared. In a news conference on Sunday he blamed Hamas and the international media for perpetuating a \u201cglobal campaign of lies.\u201d He added that \u201cthe only ones being deliberately starved\u201d are the Israeli hostages in Gaza.\n\nThis sentiment is widely shared in Israel. A poll in late July found that almost 80 percent of Jewish Israelis believe that Israel is making an effort to avoid causing suffering to Gazans. The same percentage \u2014 though primarily on the right and center \u2014 said they are not troubled by reports of famine. While indications are growing that the tragedy is starting to register among Israelis, the willful blindness of much of Israeli society must be discarded for Israel to begin pulling itself out of the quagmire in Gaza and repairing its own tattered image. The first step to resolving a problem is admitting there is one. When it comes to Gaza, Israelis live in an echo chamber, relying largely on local media, which often enacts self-censorship regarding Israeli wrongdoing and Palestinian suffering in Gaza. But it is also important to understand the powerful underlying emotions that have led many Israelis to close their eyes and ears to the suffering of Gazans and accept a different version of reality. Many feel fury at the humanitarians and international organizations that, while criticizing Israel\u2019s every move, seemed to minimize Hamas\u2019s horrendous crimes on Oct. 7, 2023, when about 1,200 people in Israel were murdered and some 250 taken hostage. Fifty are still captive, 20 of whom are believed to be alive. There is a profound sense of unfairness over demands that Israel allow large transfers of aid to Gaza when many returning hostages describe being starved and abused even when there seemed to be enough food for their captors. Recent history also lingers bitterly in Israeli memory. It includes the 2005 disengagement of Israel from Gaza, followed by Hamas\u2019s 2007 takeover, and nearly two decades of cyclical attempts to deter and contain the organization with limited military operations and economic carrots, like permits for Gazans to work in Israel. All seem to have amounted to nothing in the face of Hamas\u2019s futile and bloody drive to destroy Israel. The barbarity displayed on Oct. 7, combined with the cheering chorus from enemies and the silence from many friends, hardened the conflict for many Israelis to the fundamental, zero-sum and inherently violent struggle for land and sovereignty that so many of the kibbutzniks murdered in their homes that day had sought to overcome with their peaceful intentions.\n\nVideos from Gaza circulate on Israeli social media, showing markets with food on display, open restaurants, gunmen looting aid. They might be real, but they are often old or fail to present a full picture across the strip. Nonetheless, these videos help Israelis to construct an alternative narrative: There is enough food going into Gaza, but the United Nations is failing to distribute it properly; Hamas and gangs are stealing it, while Israel is doing what it can. The warnings of famine have drawn more rational skepticism. Despite repeated alarms raised by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification \u2014 the definitive international source for declaring a famine \u2014 there is still no clear indication that their predictions have come to pass at scale, leading the Israeli public to believe that the warnings are just another part of the global anti-Israel propaganda machine. Israelis also lay blame with the U.N., which despite objective difficulties has seemingly opted for a principled approach over pragmatism. Nearly 90 percent of U.N. food aid has been seized by armed actors or hungry crowds since May 19. Still, although the U.N. adopted Security Council Resolution 2720 in December 2023 to accelerate and monitor the delivery of aid to the people of Gaza, it was not until May that the U.N. added an online dashboard to monitor that aid. In addition, the U.N. prioritizes the privacy of its local workers in Gaza, failing in Israeli eyes to register legitimate concerns regarding terrorists penetrating aid agencies. For Israelis, the reality is this: Israel, a flawed but real and vital country, is fighting an evil terrorist group that has the power to stop the horror at any time, but hates Israel enough to persist and does not care enough for its own people to stop. Yet what is happening in Gaza speaks for itself. People are starving, and as in any other crisis, the most vulnerable in society \u2014 the elderly, newborns, people with pre-existing conditions \u2014 are harmed first.\n\nEven after almost two years of war, Israel lacks a coherent humanitarian strategy for Gaza, switching aid on and off based on the calculations of Mr. Netanyahu, who is trying to balance keeping the political support of his right-wing coalition partners, who want the war to continue, and international pressure to stop it. After several hundred thousand tons of food aid entered Gaza during the second cease-fire, according to Israel \u2014 enough for several months, by World Food Program projections \u2014 Israel\u2019s decision to cut off all aid in March pushed the strip into the dire crisis it faces today. Israel said that it hoped the blockade would disrupt Hamas\u2019s ability to profit from the goods coming in, weaken the group\u2019s governance and pressure it to capitulate in cease-fire negotiations. This was not just a morally wrong choice \u2014 humanitarian aid should not be a political issue \u2014 but a strategically foolish one that misread both Hamas and the international community. A humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza was never going to force Hamas\u2019s hand. The group needs very few resources to operate: just enough to continue to hold the hostages, carry out guerrilla attacks and continue making statements to influence public opinion. In May Israel sought to sidestep the U.N. assistance system, which it relentlessly criticized as ineffectual and compromised by Hamas with the poorly planned and even more poorly implemented system run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. But after months of no aid, stocks in Gaza had run down and prices had soared; the foundation\u2019s four distribution sites were almost immediately overwhelmed and exploited by profiteers, not to mention dangerous to access, with numerous casualties reported in lines for aid. The lack of aid has led to the death of more than 210 people by malnutrition since the start of the war, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health. The Israeli-American plan to quadruple the foundation\u2019s distribution centers will hardly address the grave situation. Even today the foundation faces logistical challenges, and the boxes they issue, both in terms of food quantity and diversity, don\u2019t translate easily to nutritious meals.\n\nThe humanitarian disaster in Gaza is far broader than starvation. The vast majority of the population has been displaced at least once and lacks shelter. There is limited water and sanitation. Health care is devastated. Yet even though Israel now theoretically places no limits on aid to Gaza, it continues to refuse work visas to staff members of the U.N. and international aid groups. It restricts humanitarian operations to a small number of organizations that manage to successfully maneuver through an opaque registration. These conditions all seem likely to continue: Despite Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s statement on Thursday that Israel would expand the war, beginning with the takeover of Gaza City, the Israel Defense Forces is loath to assume a civilian governance role. Glimmers of recognition of all this suffering have emerged in recent weeks. Despite denials of the extent of the grim reality in Gaza, Israel established fixed humanitarian corridors, conducted and facilitated airdrops and allowed in small amounts of commercial traffic and daytime pauses in operations in some areas to allow for aid delivery. The I.D.F. chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, reportedly protested the plan to take over Gaza City mainly for Israeli security reasons, but he also mentioned the lack of plans for a proper humanitarian response for the million people who will be displaced. In addition, he cited the absence of civilian infrastructure in Gaza and called for building hospitals there. Mainstream media, including Channels 12 and 13 and the popular newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, have begun stating the obvious: that there is hunger in Gaza, and that the current aid system is not working. The intellectual and cultural elite has also become more vocal, with a petition signed by some 1,000 prominent Israeli artists titled \u201cStop the Horror in Gaza\u201d and a demand by heads of universities to address the humanitarian situation. People at vigils in Tel Aviv hold posters showing pictures of dead children in Gaza.",

      "text": "WFP Statement on Gaza\nWFP has enough food in \u2013 or on its way to - the region to feed the entire population of 2.1 million people for almost three months.\nThese new commitments to improve operating conditions come on top of earlier assurances from Israel to strengthen facilitation of humanitarian assistance. This includes allowing more trucks to enter Gaza with quicker clearances and approvals, use of alternative roads and routes inside Gaza, assurances of no armed forces or shootings near convoys, and the ability for humanitarian organizations to import and use the communications equipment needed to coordinate aid deliveries. Together, we hope these measures will allow for a surge in urgently needed food assistance to reach hungry people without further delays.\nWFP teams delivered 350 truckloads of food aid into Gaza last week under extremely challenging circumstances that put civilians and aid workers at tremendous risk. This represents just over half the number of convoys WFP requested permission to send in.\nSince the May 21st reopening of border crossings, WFP has delivered 22,000 tons of food aid into Gaza. More than 62,000 tons of food assistance is needed monthly to cover the entire 2.1 million population.\nFood aid is the only real way for most people inside Gaza to eat. A third of the population is not eating for days. Some 470,000 people are enduring famine-like conditions. 90,000 women and children need urgent nutrition treatment. People are dying due to a lack of humanitarian assistance.\nAn agreed ceasefire is the only way for humanitarian assistance to reach the entire civilian population in Gaza with critical food and other relief supplies in a consistent, predictable, orderly and safe manner -- wherever they are across the Gaza Strip."

A box fell on him directly and he was martyred,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThey [the countries involved in the airdrops] cannot enter the aid through the crossing but they drop them over us and kill our children. A kid was killed in [az-]Zawayda and here and there, and nobody feels us. God is sufficient for us, against them and their aid,\u201d he added.\nThe latest death comes after the United Nations repeatedly warned that the airdrops are dangerous, inefficient and costly, and it called on Israel to allow a steady supply of humanitarian assistance into Gaza via land crossings instead.\nThe Gaza Government Media Office said at least 23 Palestinians have been killed and another 124 wounded in airdrops of aid since Israel\u2019s war on the enclave began in October 2023.\n\u201cWe have repeatedly warned of the danger of these inhumane methods and have repeatedly called for the entry of aid through land crossings in a safe and sufficient manner, especially food, infant milk, medicines, and medical supplies,\u201d the office said in a statement.\nMedical sources in Gaza, meanwhile, said that Israeli forces killed at least 47 people in attacks across the Strip on Saturday, including dozens who were waiting for aid.\nOn Sunday, the Ministry of Health said that at least five more Palestinians had starved to death in the previous 24-hour reporting period, including two children.\nThe latest toll brings the total number of deaths from malnutrition to 217, including 100 children, since the war began.\nMost of those deaths have occurred in recent weeks, as Israel continues to impose severe restrictions on aid supplies entering Gaza after partially lifting a total blockade in late May.\nMohammed Abu Salmiya, the director of al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza, told Al Jazeera that famine continues to pose a serious risk, \u201cespecially among children and the elderly\u201d.\n\u201cMalnutrition among children leads to decreased immunity and may lead to death,\u201d he said.\nSevere restrictions persist\nOn Friday, the World Food Programme (WFP) called on Israel to allow at least 100 aid trucks per day into Gaza, noting that only 60 of its aid truck drivers have been vetted and approved by the Israeli military to date.\nThe 100 trucks per day the organisation called for is a fraction of the 600 per day other UN agencies and Gaza authorities have said are needed to meet the basic needs of residents in the Strip.\n\u201cSince July 27, 266 WFP trucks arriving at crossing points were turned back, 31 percent of which had initially been approved,\u201d the agency\u2019s latest report said.\n\u201cConvoy movements are frequently hampered by last-minute changes by Israeli authorities, and heavy insecurity due to military activities along convoy routes.\u201d\nThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, also noted on Saturday that it has not been allowed to bring any humanitarian aid into Gaza, including food and medicine, for more than five months, depriving hungry and ailing Palestinians of what they need to survive.\nThe warnings came as Israeli forces continued to escalate their attacks across the territory. Six people were killed by Israeli soldiers while waiting for aid near the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza, medical sources told Al Jazeera.\nTwo other Palestinians were also killed, and their bodies were transported to the Nasser Medical Complex from a GHF aid distribution site in the southern part of the territory. One woman was killed and another person was wounded in an Israeli air strike that hit an apartment in Khan Younis in the south.\nIsrael\u2019s war on Gaza has killed at least 61,369 Palestinians in Gaza and wounded 152,850. An estimated 1,139 people were killed in Israel during Hamas-led attacks on October 7, 2023, and more than 200 were taken captive.\n\u2018No one and nowhere is safe\u2019\nAs the death toll continues to soar, international condemnation of Israel\u2019s conduct in the war is growing.\nSeveral countries have raised alarm over Israel\u2019s plans to seize Gaza City in an operation that could forcibly displace hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to concentration zones in southern Gaza.\nA rare emergency UN Security Council meeting has been scheduled on Sunday to address the plan approved by Israel\u2019s Security Cabinet this week.\nIn Gaza City, residents were defiant, promising not to leave in the event of a new Israeli ground offensive.\nUmm Imran told Al Jazeera that there was nowhere safe in Gaza. \u201cThey say go south, go to al-Mawasi, but there is nowhere safe any more \u2013 north, south, east or west. No one and nowhere is safe. We will stay here.\u201d\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, said residents were unable to sleep on Friday night after Israel\u2019s announcement.\n\u201cPeople are wondering what\u2019s going to happen to them, what\u2019s going to be left of Gaza if Israel moves on with its approved plan to occupy the entire Gaza Strip, starting with Gaza City,\u201d he said.\nThe Israeli plan has also been condemned by the foreign ministers of Australia, Germany, Italy, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.\nIn a joint statement on Saturday, the diplomats warned that Israel\u2019s plan will \u201caggravate the catastrophic humanitarian situation, endanger the lives of the hostages, and further risk the mass displacement of civilians\u201d.\n\u201cAny attempts at annexation or of settlement extension violate international law.\u201d\nTurkish Minister of Foreign Affairs Hakan Fidan also urged Muslim nations to work in unison to oppose Israel\u2019s plan.\nSpeaking at a joint news conference in El Alamein with his Egyptian counterpart after meeting Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Fidan said members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation had been called to an emergency meeting to tackle the crisis.\n\u201cWe completely reject [Israel\u2019s] intention to fully occupy Gaza. This plan is a new phase of Israel\u2019s expansionist and genocidal policy,\u201d he said.\nFidan added that Israel\u2019s policy aimed to force Palestinians out of their lands through hunger, and that it aimed to permanently invade Gaza, adding that there was no justifiable excuse for nations to continue to support Israel.\n\u201cPalestine belongs to the Palestinians. Any effort aimed at expelling Palestinians from their own lands is null and void and is doomed to fail,\u201d he said."

      "text": "Large Majority of Jewish Israelis: Israel Making Substantial Efforts to Avoid Palestinian Suffering; Majority of Arab Israelis Disagree\n78% of Jewish Israelis and 22.5% of Arab Israelis think that, given the circumstances of the fighting in Gaza, Israel is making efforts to avoid causing suffering to the Palestinian population there. Nearly half of the Israeli public thinks that the security forces and enforcement agencies are too lenient in their responses to violence by groups of settlers against both the IDF and Palestinians.\nMethodology\nThe survey was conducted by the Viterbi Family Center for Public Opinion and Policy Research at the Israel Democracy Institute between July 27\u201331, 2025. It was based on a representative sample of the population in Israel aged 18 and above, comprising 601 Jewish interviewees and 152 Arab interviewees.\nMain Findings\n- Relative to June, we found a decline in optimism this month across all four indicators of the national mood, essentially representing a return to the levels of the previous months. In all four categories (the future of national security, the future of democratic rule, the future of the economy, and the future of social cohesion), only a minority of Israelis are optimistic.\n- The majority of Jewish respondents think that, given the circumstances of the fighting in Gaza, Israel is making efforts to avoid causing suffering to the Palestinian population there. The majority of Arab respondents think that even with the restrictions imposed by the fighting, Israel could have done more to reduce this suffering. Among Jews, only on the Left is there a majority who think that Israel is not making the necessary efforts to reduce suffering.\n- On a personal level, the majority in the Center and on the Right (Jewish respondents) say that they are not troubled by the reports of famine and suffering among the Palestinian population in Gaza. On the Left, the majority reported that they are personally troubled by these reports.\n- The majority of the Jewish public believes the IDF\u2019s reporting on the extent of Palestinian civilian casualties in Gaza, while the majority of the Arab public does not believe its reports. A breakdown of the Jewish sample shows that only on the Left do less than half of the respondents believe the IDF\u2019s reporting, while in the Center and on the Right, the majority consider these reports to be credible.\n- The majority of Jewish respondents believe the IDF\u2019s reporting on the number of soldiers who commit suicide during their military service, while more than half of Arab respondents do not believe these reports.\n- Nearly half of the Israeli public thinks that the security forces and enforcement agencies are too lenient in their responses to violence by groups of settlers against the IDF, while only around a quarter think they are too harsh. Among voters for the coalition parties, the majority think that the enforcement agencies\u2019 response is too harsh, with the exception of Likud voters, among whom the largest share thinks that these agencies are acting appropriately.\n- Regarding violence by groups of settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank / Judea and Samaria, the findings are remarkably similar to those for the previous question\u2014the largest share of respondents think that the authorities are acting too leniently, while around a quarter take the opposite view.\n- In light of the \u201ccovenant of blood\u201d between Jews and Druze, around half of both the Jewish respondents and the Druze respondents think that the Israeli response in defense of the Druze in Syria was appropriate, while around a quarter think it was too small.\n- A large majority of Jews and Druze think that Israel\u2019s military response was correct, despite the positive diplomatic interactions between Israel and Syria, a view taken by only a quarter of (non-Druze) Arab respondents.\n- More than half of the public say that the rise in antisemitism and harassment of Israelis abroad is affecting their travel plans in some way or another. Excluding from the calculation those who had no plans to travel abroad in any case, this proportion jumps to three-quarters among Jews and around two-thirds among Arabs.\nRelative to the previous month, we found a decline in optimism this month across all four indicators of the national mood, with the sharpest declines those regarding the future of security and the future of democracy, the two subjects which have had the highest rates of optimism over the years. However, as the figure below shows, this does not constitute a new crisis, as these declines have essentially restored the situation that existed two and three months ago; thus, it is possible that the previous month\u2019s finding was anomalous. The relative standing of the four indicators remains the same, even in light of the fact that, for example, the economic situation in Israel is reasonable or better\u2014demonstrating that, as indicated by the heading of this section, the responses are apparently more to do with a general dismal mood than with factual assessments of the situation.\nOptimistic about the future of democratic rule, the future of national security, the future of the economy, and the future of social cohesion (total sample; %)\nAs in previous months, the share of optimists in the Jewish public is greater than the share of optimists in the Arab public. Breaking down responses in the Jewish sample by political orientation reveals that, as in the past, the lowest rate of optimism is found on the Left and the highest on the Right, with the Center somewhere in between.\nOptimistic about the future (Jews, %)\nThe extent of Israel\u2019s efforts to prevent suffering: This month, we focused mainly on the Israeli public\u2019s attitude toward Palestinian suffering, in light of reports and photographs supporting claims of a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, and in particular, of severe famine. We asked the respondents which claim they think is more correct: that Israel\u2019s actions are restricted by the fighting, but it is making substantial efforts to avoid causing unnecessary suffering to Palestinians in Gaza; or that even with the restrictions imposed by the fighting, Israel could significantly reduce the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza, but chooses not to. Jews and Arabs have opposite views on this issue: Among Jews, the majority think that the first claim is more correct, while among Arabs, the majority think the second claim is more correct.\nWhich of the following claims is more correct? (%)\nThe views of the three political camps (Jews) on this issue are different: The majority of those on the Left think that Israel could have significantly reduced the suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza, whereas in the Center and on the Right, the majority think that given the circumstances of military action, Israel has made considerable efforts in this regard.\nWhich of the following claims is more correct? (Jews; %)\nPersonal response to the reports from Gaza: From examining the conduct of the state, we moved to a more personal question, asking: \u201cTo what extent are you personally troubled or not troubled by the reports of famine and suffering among the Palestinian population in Gaza?\u201d A very large majority of Jewish respondents reported that they are not so troubled or not at all troubled personally by events in Gaza (79%), while the majority of Arabs said that they are very troubled or somewhat troubled (86%).\nIn the Jewish sample, we found no difference by gender (with 80% of women and 78% of men not troubled), while in the Arab sample we found that women are more troubled than men by the situation in Gaza (women, 92%; men, 80%).\nOn this question as well, we found a much greater degree of concern on the Left for the suffering and hunger in Gaza than in the Center and on the Right.\nPersonally troubled by the reports of famine and suffering among the Palestinian population in Gaza (Jews; %)\nCredibility of the IDF\u2019s reporting on the number of Palestinian civilian casualties in Gaza: A clear majority (70%) of the Jewish public believes the IDF\u2019s reporting on the number of Palestinian civilian casualties in Gaza. By contrast, the majority of the Arab public does not believe these reports (63%).\nTo what extent do you believe the IDF\u2019s reporting on the extent of Palestinian civilian casualties in Gaza? (%)\nBelief in the IDF\u2019s reporting on the extent of casualties in Gaza is also influenced by political position (Jews). Thus, on the Left, less than half (48.5%) believe these reports to a very large or fairly large extent, compared to a majority of respondents in the Center (70%) and on the Right (74%). Breaking down the Jewish sample by religiosity, the largest share of believers in IDF reports is found among the national religious public (86%), while the smallest share is among the Haredim (55%). The other groups are somewhere in between (traditional religious, 80%; traditional non-religious, 76%; secular, 63%).\nIn light of the doubts that have recently arisen in the public discourse, we asked our respondents for their assessment of the credibility of the IDF\u2019s reporting on the number of soldiers who commit suicide during their military service. Among Jews, a majority (58.5%) believe the IDF\u2019s reporting on this issue, while a third (35.5%) do not. In the Arab public, the picture is reversed: around a third (34.5%) believe the IDF\u2019s reporting on soldier suicides, while more than half (53.5%) do not.\nBelieve or don\u2019t believe IDF reporting on the number of soldiers committing suicide during their military service (%)\nWe compared the responses with those to a similar question asked in 2022, and also analyzed the Jewish sample by political orientation. In the total Jewish sample, as well as in all three political camps, we found a sizeable increase in the share of those who believe the IDF\u2019s reporting on this subject. However, the share of those who do not believe the IDF\u2019s reporting has not decreased; instead, the rise in trust has come at the expense of the share of respondents selecting the \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d option, which fell from 19% in 2022 to 6% in 2025.\nBelieve to a very large or fairly large extent the IDF\u2019s reporting on the number of soldiers committing suicide during their military service (Jews; %)*\n*In 2022, the wording of the question was: How credible do you think the IDF\u2019s reports on the number of suicides are? Very credible; quite credible; not so credible; not at all credible; don\u2019t know. For the purposes of the analysis presented here, we grouped categories 1\u20132 and categories 3\u20134.\nViolence against the IDF and security forces: Recently, there has been an increase in the number of incidents of violence by groups of settlers against the IDF and security forces in the West Bank / Judea and Samaria. We asked: \u201cIn your opinion, are the security forces and enforcement agencies treating these settlers too harshly, too leniently, or appropriately?\u201d\nNearly half of the total public think that the security forces are too lenient toward settler violence, almost a quarter think enforcement is appropriate, and a similar share think the treatment of violent settlers is too harsh.\nA clear majority of Arab respondents think that the security forces are too lenient in their treatment of settler violence, while only a small minority thinks they are too harsh. Among Jews, too, the largest share\u2014though not a majority\u2014think that the agencies are too lenient, and about a quarter that they are too harsh.\nAre the security forces and enforcement agencies treating groups of settlers involved in incidents of violence against the IDF and security forces too harshly, too leniently, or appropriately? (%)\nBreaking down the Jewish sample by religiosity reveals that the share of respondents who believe that the security forces are responding too harshly toward settler violence decreases as the level of religious conservatism declines. Thus, among the Haredim, a majority of about two-thirds think that the security forces and enforcement agencies are treating these incidents too harshly, while the picture is reversed among secular respondents, of whom around two-thirds think that these agencies are acting too leniently. The rest of the groups are somewhere in between.\nAre the security forces and enforcement agencies treating groups of settlers involved in incidents of violence against the IDF and security forces too harshly, too leniently, or appropriately? (Jews, by religiosity; %)\nBreaking down the responses by political orientation (Jews) reveals that in the Center, and even more so on the Left, most of the respondents think that the agencies are acting too leniently (59% and 82% respectively), while only a minority think they are acting too harshly\u2014Center, 8%; Left, 5% (acting appropriately: Center, 23%; Left, 9%). On the Right, the distribution is different, with the largest share saying that the response is too harsh (34.5%), 27% that it is too lenient, and 26% that it is appropriate.\nA breakdown by vote in the 2022 elections produces an interesting finding: Among voters for the coalition parties, there is a significant difference between voters for the Haredi parties and Religious Zionism\u2013 of whom some two-thirds think that the agencies are acting too harshly\u2014and Likud voters, of whom only the smallest share hold the same opinion. As expected, among voters for all opposition parties, the majority think that the security forces and enforcement agencies are acting too leniently.\nAre the security forces and enforcement agencies treating groups of settlers involved in incidents of violence against the IDF and security forces too harshly, too leniently, or appropriately? (total sample, by vote in 2022 elections; %)\nViolence toward Palestinians in the West Bank / Judea and Samaria: We asked a similar question regarding the treatment by the security forces and enforcement agencies of violent acts by settlers against Palestinians. The results are strikingly similar to the previous question: Here, too, the largest share (42%) of the general public think that the agencies are too lenient, while around a quarter think that they are too harsh, and another quarter think that their response is appropriate.\nAmong Jews, the distribution is very similar to the distribution in the general sample, while among Arabs, the share of respondents who think that these agencies are acting too leniently is significantly larger.\nAre the security forces and enforcement agencies treating groups of settlers involved in acts of violence against Palestinians too harshly, too leniently, or appropriately? (%)\nBreaking down responses in the Jewish sample by political orientation, we again found a large majority on the Left and a smaller majority in the Center who think that the enforcement agencies and security forces are acting too leniently. On the Right, meanwhile, the largest share thinks they are acting too harshly.\nA breakdown by religiosity once again places the Haredim and the secular at the extremes: Half of the Haredim think that the enforcement agencies\u2019 response is too harsh, while a slightly larger share of secular respondents think it is too lenient. The remaining groups are somewhere in between. It is worth noting a difference within the Haredi group: The proportion of those who view the response against settlers who attack the IDF as too harsh (67%) is significantly larger than the proportion of those who think the response against settlers who attack Palestinians is too harsh (50%).\nWe cross-tabulated the two questions\u2014about the response of the security forces and enforcement agencies to settler violence against IDF forces and to settler violence against Palestinians\u2014and found a high level of overlap between the responses: 73.5% of those who think that the security forces\u2019 response is too harsh regarding violence against IDF forces also think that their response is too harsh regarding violence against Palestinians. A similar share (75.5%) of those who think that the security forces are too lenient in their handling of attacks on IDF forces think the same way about the handling of violence against Palestinians. (There is an overlap of 68% among respondents who think the forces\u2019 response is appropriate).\nWe wanted to examine the public\u2019s views regarding the Israeli military response in support of the Druze in Syria (we enlarged the Druze sample so that we could examine their views separately).\nIntervention as a required obligation as part of the \u201ccovenant of blood\u201d? Just over half of the Jews consider the scale of Israel\u2019s military response to have been appropriate, about a quarter think it was too small, and only 7% think it was too large. Among the Druze, nearly half think that the response was appropriate in scale (similar to the Jewish response), over a quarter that it was too small, and a similar proportion think it was too large. It is surprising that among the (non-Druze) Arabs, the largest share\u2014about a third of the respondents\u2014think that that Israel\u2019s military response was too small, while 19% think it was too large. Also noteworthy is the fact that around a quarter of the Arab respondents selected the \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d option, which could indicate a reluctance to express a clear position on the issue.\nIn the context of its \u201ccovenant of blood\u201d with the Druze community in Israel, Israel has promised to defend the Druze in Syria. Was the Israeli response in Syria to attacks on the Druze there too large, too small, or appropriate? (%)\nA breakdown by political orientation (Jews) reveals that in all three camps, the largest share of respondents think the Israeli response was appropriate (Right, 56%; Center, 49%; and Left, 43%). On the other hand, only a small minority in each camp think the response was too large: Center, 9%; Left, 7%; and Right, 6%. On the Right, around a quarter (24%) think the response was too small. This is also the view of 21% on the Left and 36% in the Center. It worth noting that a very large share of those on the Left (29%) selected the \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d response, which could indicate a dilemma between commitment to the Druze and opposition to military operations.\nIntervention on behalf of the Druze against the backdrop of talks between Israel and Syria: In this regard, we found a great similarity between the Jews and the Druze: in both groups, a large majority of around three-quarters think that the military response was correct even against the background of the talks, which could have been negatively affected. Among the non-Druze Arabs, more than half think that the response was not correct in light of the progress in talks with Syria.\nRecent media reports claimed that there had been progress in talks between Israel and Syria. Against this backdrop, do you think that Israel\u2019s military response in Syria was correct or not correct? (%)\nA breakdown of the Jewish sample by political orientation reveals a large majority in the Center (70%), and even larger on the Right (80%), who think that the military response was correct. There is also a majority on the Left who think that the military response was correct, albeit smaller (54.5%).\nWe asked: \u201cAre the many reports of rising antisemitism and attacks on Israelis abroad affecting or not affecting your decisions about traveling abroad in the near future?\u201d More than half of all respondents said that the increase in antisemitism is affecting their plans: 38% reported an impact on the choice of destination, and another 18% said they would not travel abroad in the near future because of these reports. Around a quarter (24%) reported that they had not planned to travel abroad in the near future in any case, while 17% are planning to travel abroad as usual.\nAmong Jews, 42% report that the rise in such incidents is affecting their choice of destination, and 17% say that as a result, they will not travel abroad anytime soon. Among Arabs, around a quarter say that they will not travel abroad in the near future due to these incidents, while 17.5% say that they are affecting their choice of travel destination.\nWhen we look only at those who intended to travel abroad and leave out those who did not plan to travel anyway, the percentage of Jews who report that these incidents are affecting their travel plans jumps to 76% (affecting their travel destination, 54.5%; will not travel at all, 21.5%), while among Arabs it reaches 65% (affecting their travel destination, 26.5%; will not travel at all, 38.5%).\nBreaking down responses in the Jewish sample by religiosity reveals that in all groups, between one-third and one-half of respondents report an impact on their travel destination, and between 12.5% and 24.5% do not plan to travel due to the rise in antisemitism and harassment of Israelis. Removing from the equation those who did not plan to travel anyway causes these shares to increase sharply: 84% of the traditional religious, 81% of the traditional non-religious, 78% of the national religious, and 72% of the secular and Haredi publics report that these incidents are affecting their decision\u2014whether influencing their choice of destination, or persuading them not to travel at all.\nAre the many reports of rising antisemitism and harassment of Israelis abroad affecting or not affecting your decisions about traveling abroad in the near future?

      "text": "Two weeks ago, Israel\u2019s most-watched news broadcast, on the mainstream Channel 12, aired a series of startling images from Gaza. There were photographs of emaciated babies, and of children being trampled as they stood in food lines, holding out empty pots; there were pictures of mothers weeping because they had no way to feed their families. At the end of the segment, Ohad Hemo, the network\u2019s correspondent for Palestinian affairs, concluded, \u201cThere is hunger in Gaza, and we have to say it loud and clear.\u201d He was careful to note that his assessment was not influenced by foreign reporting: \u201cI speak to Gazans daily. These are people who haven\u2019t eaten in days.\u201d He went on, \u201cThe responsibility lies not only with Hamas but also with Israel.\u201d\nIn much of the world, this sentiment would seem incontrovertible, even obvious. In Israel, it represented a drastic change. Since the early days of the war, the Israeli media has maintained that there is no hunger crisis in Gaza. Partisans of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government argue that there is plenty of food there, and circulate images of markets laden with fruits and vegetables. (Never mind that the prices of goods there are the highest in the world.) The real problem, they say, is that the United Nations, which largely set up the aid-distribution network, isn\u2019t doing enough\u2014neither to distribute food nor to keep Hamas from stealing it before it can reach the needy. Hamas and international organizations, they say, are falsely promoting a \u201cstarvation campaign.\u201d\nIn July, mainstream journalists and politicians abruptly abandoned that official narrative. On the same day as the Channel 12 report, the well-known journalist Ron Ben-Yishai ran an article headlined \u201cThere Are Hungry Children in Gaza. We Need To Admit It\u2014And Immediately Change the Distribution of Aid.\u201d\nThe same day, the military, evidently in crisis-control mode, released a video that it said had been uncovered in Gaza, of Hamas militants in an underground room, feasting lavishly on apparently looted food. This time, reporters did not take up the official line. \u201cEven that argument is problematic,\u201d a Channel 12 reporter ventured. \u201cAfter all, Israel replaced the U.N. aid delivery precisely to prevent Hamas from looting the aid.\u201d He was referring to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an initiative that was rolled out in May, with backing from Israel and the U.S. Though Netanyahu\u2019s government hailed it as a \u201cturning point in the war,\u201d there are only four distribution centers inside Gaza and no proper tracking of aid recipients. The sites quickly grew chaotic. According to the U.N., more than eight hundred Palestinians have been fatally shot as they sought food near G.H.F. sites. (In a recent statement to The New Yorker, the G.H.F. denied that anyone was shot near its sites.)\nThe hunger crisis in Gaza is still far from dominating the news in Israel the way it does elsewhere. But, even for politicians and journalists who are sympathetic to Netanyahu, it has become permissible to acknowledge that it is real. Notably, this change occurred before President Donald Trump acknowledged what he called \u201creal starvation\u201d last week.\nAfter the Channel 12 report, Amit Segal, the network\u2019s chief political correspondent, who has close contacts with Netanyahu, posted on social media, \u201cGaza may well be approaching a real hunger crisis. Shocked to be reading this from me? I don\u2019t blame you.\u201d Segal included an analysis by a researcher at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem that tracked the price of goods in Gaza and compared them with similar costs in historic food shortages. During the worst famines of past years, prices rose tenfold. Now, in Gaza, they have shot up eightyfold. The researcher, Yannay Spitzer, concluded that \u201cmass starvation seems inevitable.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not that Israelis have been unaware of international outrage over Gaza. When Italy joined other European countries to criticize the war, an Israeli news site affiliated with the religious right posted a weary acknowledgment: \u201cThe wave of condemnation of Israel continues.\u201d There have been pockets of dissent within the country, too, with activists marching through the streets of Tel Aviv carrying bags of flour to protest hunger. The liberal newspaper Haaretz has been filled with stories about the humanitarian disaster that followed an eleven-week aid blockade by Israel earlier this year. But the overwhelming reaction among Israelis has been, effectively: \u201cBlame Hamas, not us.\u201d If Hamas released the Israeli hostages still in captivity and put down its weapons, the argument goes, the war would be over. More than that, such skeptics ask, what other nation on earth is expected to provide humanitarian aid to its enemy during wartime? (That Gaza is a blockaded territory whose crossings are controlled almost entirely by Israel does not much figure into the public debate.)\nOn the right, there has been flat-out denial. Channel 14, a Netanyahu-friendly outlet, has devoted entire segments to \u201cdebunking\u201d footage of starving children. Last week, a pundit on the network mused about a CNN report, \u201cThe images show very thin, even emaciated children\u2014and their parents are fat and healthy.\u201d Among the wider public, the sentiment has been less crude, but still characterized by deflection. \u201cEmpathy Isn\u2019t a Strategy,\u201d a recent op-ed on the news site Ynet declared. Though it \u201cmay be a moral flaw\u201d to starve Gazans, the article argued, it would be an \u201ceven greater moral flaw\u201d to keep Hamas in power.\nIn March of last year, the I.P.C., an international panel of experts backed by the U.N., projected an \u201cimminent famine\u201d in northern Gaza if more aid wasn\u2019t allowed in. The next month, after a thirty-minute phone call between then President Joe Biden and Netanyahu, Israel opened more crossings into the northern area. A worst-case scenario was averted\u2014for a while. \u201cThat report worked,\u201d Alex de Waal, one of the foremost experts on food security, who heads the World Peace Foundation at Tufts University, told me at the time. \u201cIt got the U.S. government and the Israeli government to say, \u2018We have a big reputational risk here, if nothing else.\u2019 \u201d But inside Israel the panel\u2019s warnings were rejected. Segal and others spent months tarnishing the I.P.C. for relying too heavily on data collected by U.N. agencies. They have also scornfully dismissed reporting by Haaretz. \u201cFor Haaretz, Hamas propaganda isn\u2019t a bug but a feature,\u201d Segal wrote just last week.\nSo, what changed? Why are more Israelis now willing to acknowledge that people in Gaza are starving? In part, the situation has become so dire that it can no longer be ignored. As concerns about hunger were breaking through to the public, Haaretz reported that forty-three Palestinians had starved to death in just four days. \u201cYou build a dam around your consciousness, but holes and cracks start to appear, and the water eventually seeps through,\u201d Oren Persico, a journalist for the Seventh Eye, a media-watchdog publication, told me.\nMany Israeli reporters have been reluctant to be seen as criticizing their country at a time of war. In a column that circulated widely last year, the journalist Akiva Novick reminded his peers that Israeli soldiers serving in Gaza \u201clisten to the radio and television stations,\u201d and said that \u201chighlighting stories of military and civilian heroism . . . is the order of the day.\u201d But growing public disillusionment about the war\u2019s stated goals of defeating Hamas and releasing the hostages has made it possible to speak out. Polls show that roughly seventy per cent of the Israeli public supports a deal that would end the war and release the remaining hostages. \u201cIf people still believed in the talk of \u2018total victory,\u2019 we wouldn\u2019t be seeing this criticism,\u201d Persico said.\nTwo other events appear to have expedited the change. The first was that the Daily Express, a U.K. tabloid, published a cover photo of an emaciated-looking baby, alongside the headline \u201cFOR PITY\u2019S SAKE STOP THIS NOW.\u201d For Israelis, particularly those on the right, it was startling\u2014not because the image was upsetting but because the Daily Express more or less always sides with Israel. Channel 13, another mainstream network, showed the cover (with the infant blurred) and noted, \u201cMany outlets, including pro-Israel ones, are echoing the images of hunger in Gaza and calling to stop the war.\u201d Other media reported an uptick in coverage of the Gaza crisis on Fox News\u2014\u201cthe Israel-friendly outlet,\u201d as one outlet called it. A sense grew that the country was beginning to lose even its staunchest supporters.\nThe other decisive event was more prosaic: activists from a joint Jewish-Palestinian initiative called Standing Together staged a protest outside the studios of Channels 12 and 13. Holding signs that said, \u201cWhat Is the Media Hiding?,\u201d the demonstrators condemned the networks\u2019 \u201ccontinued ignoring of the horrors of the war.\u201d These kinds of protests happen every week in Tel Aviv. In this case, though, an argument broke out about it in a private WhatsApp group used by the network\u2019s employees, and the exchange was leaked to Ynet.\nThe leaked texts show that, as the argument began, Ron Yaron, a news editor at Channel 12, was griping about the protest. \u201cWith all respect to our journalistic duty, when you hear the stories of the survivors of captivity, it\u2019s a little hard to connect with the message of the demonstration,\u201d he wrote.\nOthers took issue. \u201cOur journalistic duty is to report on everything that is important and worthy, whether the released hostages connect with it or not,\u201d one reporter wrote. Another agreed: \u201cI receive a lot of criticism that there is no reporting on this issue here, and in my opinion the criticism is justified.\u201d A member of the news desk added, \u201cWe have to report only on what we connect to? Isn\u2019t that the definition of biased journalism?\u201d\nSeveral employees sympathetic to the government took Yaron\u2019s side. \u201cIf this is the definition of biased journalism, I live with it in peace,\u201d another editorial member wrote. Segal, the political correspondent, wrote, \u201cBingo.\u201d\nFinally, a commentator named Mohammad Magadli, a Palestinian citizen of Israel, joined in. \u201cI would be happy to arrange for you a conversation with my cousin Zainab from Gaza,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPerhaps you will connect a bit more with the suffering of people who have never identified with or supported Hamas and have woken up every morning for a year and a half to a race for a sack of flour.\u201d\nThe exchange was picked up by many Israeli outlets; it was the first indication that the war was causing internal conflict at a major media organization. A veteran news editor described the leak to me as a pivotal moment. \u201cIt loosened things up,\u201d he said. Suddenly, journalists \u201cfelt like they could dial up their criticism a notch.\u201d\nSo far, the change in public discourse appears limited mostly to media circles. Forty-seven per cent of Israelis say that there is no hunger in Gaza and that \u201cIt\u2019s just Hamas lies,\u201d according to a new poll by the mainstream newspaper Maariv. They claim that images of starving children are staged by Hamas, or manipulated by A.I., or taken out of context. Activists have worked steadily to discredit stories about famine. One tracked down the medical records of the infant who appeared on the cover of the Daily Express, and found that he had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy, which the Times and other major news organizations initially did not mention. Politicians and several pro-Israel outlets called the omission a \u201cblood libel.\u201d\nThe Israeli military unit known as COGAT, which leads civilian policy in Gaza, has been publicizing images of Palestinian children with health disorders as proof that there is no widespread hunger. It recently called out an Italian newspaper for publishing a photo of a malnourished child without mentioning that the child suffered from an underlying health condition and had been evacuated by Israel for medical treatment. Persico criticized this tactic as a \u201ccampaign for the margins\u201d\u2014an attempt to use a few problematic cases to dismiss a much larger phenomenon. Nevertheless, COGAT\u2019s messaging has been widely amplified by leading Israeli outlets. \u201cOne baby with pre-existing conditions makes more headlines than twenty thousand dead children,\u201d Persico said.\nEven with its newer, tougher tone, Channel 12 tends to distinguish between hunger and starvation. And much of its recent reporting on Gaza framed the issue as a \u201cmedia tsunami\u201d\u2014implying that the problem was not Israel\u2019s conduct but its reputation abroad. Yonit Levi, the network\u2019s lead anchor, seemed dissatisfied with this analysis. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time to understand that this is not a public relations failure but a moral failure, and start from there,\u201d she noted. The blowback was swift. On Channel 14, the Netanyahu-friendly outlet, a panel of talking heads lambasted Levi for almost ten minutes. \u201cMaybe we have to take these people to a studio, like in \u2018A Clockwork Orange,\u2019 force their eyes open, and screen non-stop footage from October 7th,\u201d one panelist mused. Another said, \u201cEven if it\u2019s true that there is hunger in Gaza\u2014and it\u2019s not true\u2014I\u2019m not interested.\u201d\nThis sentiment\u2014even if there is hunger, and there is no hunger\u2014is not limited to the government\u2019s core supporters. In the Maariv poll, eighteen per cent of respondents said there was hunger, but that they didn\u2019t care. Much of Israel\u2019s viewing public knows that something terrible is taking place in Gaza, but waves it away. \u201cIt\u2019s much more convenient than to think that we live in a society that is committing terrible crimes,\u201d Persico said. Still, there are little cracks in the dam. On Friday, Nadav Eyal, a columnist for the popular newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, wrote, \u201cThere is hunger, and there is a Hamas propaganda campaign. Both things can exist simultaneously.\u201d Dismissing the talk of children\u2019s underlying conditions, he noted that the first victims in a humanitarian crisis are bound to be those who are already weakened. They, too, he wrote, \u201cdeserve to live and not starve.\u201d\nNetanyahu himself, a day after declaring that \u201cthere is no starvation in Gaza,\u201d came as close as he had to acknowledging that there was a problem, posting on social media that the \u201csituation in Gaza is difficult.\u201d The statement, tellingly, was only in English. But Israel has begun to take some action. Last week, it declared a pause in military operations to allow more aid to enter the strip securely, and co\u00f6rdinated airdrops of aid by the U.K., the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, and others. The move came just as Israel\u2019s parliament broke for summer recess, meaning that Netanyahu\u2019s far-right coalition partners couldn\u2019t take out their ire by threatening to topple the government.\nProof of the humanitarian plight continues to emerge. Over the weekend, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad released videos of two Israeli hostages who remain in captivity. Both looked severely emaciated. One of them was holding a shovel, forced by his captors to dig his own grave. Eliya Cohen, who had been held by Hamas until a temporary ceasefire brought his release, in February, wrote that the videos reminded him of something one of his captors had said: \u201cYour people are starving us, so we will starve you.\u201d Vicky Cohen, whose son, Nimrod, remains a hostage in Gaza, posted two words online: \u201cHolocaust 2025.\u201d\nEven Bezalel Smotrich, one of the far-right ministers behind Israel\u2019s most hard-line policies in Gaza, issued a grudging acknowledgment last week: \u201cNo one in the world will allow us to starve two million people.\u201d Yet it remains unclear whether the recognition of the crisis marks a real tipping point or merely an occasion for momentary concessions. Ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas collapsed in recent weeks, with each side blaming the other. As with the ceasefire that was forced on Israel and Hamas in the winter, it seems that the only thing that would drastically change reality in Gaza would be heavy interference from the U.S. A senior White House official recently told Politico that Trump just wants the bloodshed to end, and is \u201cnot deeply concerned about the details.\u201d \u2666"

      "text": "Israel has refused to renew visas for heads of at least 3 UN agencies in Gaza\nIsrael has refused to renew visas for heads of at least 3 UN agencies in Gaza\nUNITED NATIONS (AP) \u2014 Israel has refused to renew visas for the heads of at least three United Nations agencies in Gaza, which the U.N. humanitarian chief blames on their work trying to protect Palestinian civilians in the war-torn territory.\nVisas for the local leaders of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, known as OCHA; the human rights agency OHCHR; and the agency supporting Palestinians in Gaza, UNRWA, have not been renewed in recent months, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric confirmed.\nTom Fletcher, U.N. head of humanitarian affairs, told the Security Council on Wednesday that the U.N.\u2019s humanitarian mandate is not just to provide aid to civilians in need and report what its staff witnesses but to advocate for international humanitarian law.\n\u201cEach time we report on what we see, we face threats of further reduced access to the civilians we are trying to serve,\u201d he said. \u201cNowhere today is the tension between our advocacy mandate and delivering aid greater than in Gaza.\u201d\nFletcher said, \u201cVisas are not renewed or reduced in duration by Israel, explicitly in response to our work on protection of civilians.\u201d\nIsrael\u2019s U.N. Mission said it is looking into the issue. Israel has been sharply critical of UNRWA, even before Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, surprise attack in southern Israel \u2014 accusing the agency of colluding with Hamas and teaching anti-Israel hatred, which UNRWA vehemently denies.\nSince then, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right allies have claimed that UNRWA is deeply infiltrated by Hamas and that its staffers participated in the Oct. 7 attacks. Israel formally banned UNRWA from operating in its territory, and its commissioner general, Swiss-Italian humanitarian Philippe Lazzarini, already has been barred from entering Gaza.\nThe U.N. identified the other two local leaders affected as Jonathan Whittall, a South African humanitarian expert for OCHA, and Ajith Sunghay, a British-educated international lawyer for OHCHR.\nAt Wednesday\u2019s Security Council meeting, Fletcher called conditions in Gaza \u201cbeyond vocabulary,\u201d with food running out and Palestinians seeking something to eat being shot. He said Israel, the occupying power in Gaza, is failing in its obligation under the Geneva Conventions to provide for civilian needs.\nIn response, Israel accused OCHA of continuing \u201cto abandon all semblance of neutrality and impartiality in its statements and actions, despite claiming otherwise.\u201d\nReut Shapir Ben-Naftaly, political coordinator at Israel\u2019s U.N. Mission, told the Security Council that some of its 15 members seem to forget that the Oct. 7 attacks killed about 1,200 people and some 250 were taken hostage, triggering the war in Gaza and the humanitarian situation.\n\u201cInstead, we\u2019re presented with a narrative that forces Israel into a defendant\u2019s chair, while Hamas, the very cause of this conflict and the very instigator of suffering of Israelis but also of Palestinians, goes unmentioned, unchallenged and immune to condemnation,\u201d she said.\nMore than 58,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn\u2019t distinguish between civilians and combatants but says more than half were women and children.\nRavina Shamdasani, chief spokesperson for the Geneva-based U.N. human rights body, confirmed Thursday that the head of its office in the occupied Palestinian territories \u201chas been denied entry into Gaza.\u201d\n\u201cThe last time he tried to enter was in February 2025 and since then, he has been denied entry,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cUnfortunately, this is not unusual. Aid workers, U.N. staff, journalists and others have been denied access to Gaza.\u201d\nIsrael has accused a U.N.-backed commission probing abuses in Gaza, whose three members just resigned, and the Human Rights Council\u2019s independent investigator Francesca Albanese of antisemitism.\nAlbanese has accused Israel of \u201cgenocide\u201d in Gaza, which it and its ally the U.S. vehemently deny. The Trump administration recently issued sanctions against Albanese.\nFletcher, the U.N. humanitarian chief, told the Security Council that Israel also is not granting \u201csecurity clearances\u201d for staff to enter Gaza to continue their work and that U.N. humanitarian partners are increasingly being denied entry as well.\nHe noted that \u201c56% of the entries denied into Gaza in 2025 were for emergency medical teams \u2014 frontline responders who save lives.\u201d\n\u201cHundreds of aid workers have been killed; and those who continue to work endure hunger, danger and loss, like everyone else in the Gaza Strip,\u201d Fletcher said.\n___\nAP writers Sam Mednick in Tel Aviv, Israel, and Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed to this report."

      "text": "Amid a mounting humanitarian crisis and international criticism, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a rare English-language statement late on Monday, pledging to bolster humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.\n\u201cIsrael will continue to work with international agencies as well as the U.S. and European nations to ensure that large amounts of humanitarian aid flow into the Gaza Strip,\u201d Netanyahu said after a closed-door security cabinet meeting attended by ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir, Bezalel Smotrich and others.\nNetanyahu outlined new measures to facilitate aid, including daily pauses in IDF operations from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. in densely populated areas and designated \u201csafe routes\u201d for aid convoys from 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. \u201cWe already allow significant amounts of humanitarian aid into Gaza every single day, including food, water and medicine,\u201d he said.\nYet these promises have done little to ease concerns on the ground. Despite Netanyahu\u2019s claim that \u201cthere is no starvation in Gaza,\u201d the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 63 people\u2014including 24 children under five\u2014died this month from malnutrition-related causes, a steep rise from just 11 deaths over the previous six months.\nAccording to the Associated Press (AP), Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, recognized by the UN as the most reliable source for casualty figures \u2013 despite being controlled by Hamas- reported 82 deaths this month alone, with 14 in the past 24 hours.\nA northern Gaza hospital said it had recorded the first deaths of children with no underlying health conditions. Adults with diabetes and heart or kidney conditions were also dying from hunger exacerbated by lack of treatment.\nU.S. President Donald Trump publicly rebuked Netanyahu\u2019s claim. \u201cThose children look very hungry,\u201d he said Monday, referencing widely circulated images of skeletal children and overcrowded feeding centers.\nWitnesses at aid sites described chaos and despair to the outlet. \u201cThis aid, delivered in this way, is an insult to the Palestinian people,\u201d said Hassan al-Zalaan, who witnessed a scramble over airdropped cans of chickpeas.\nThe UN said its four malnutrition treatment centers in Gaza are overwhelmed. Acute malnutrition has tripled in northern Gaza, affecting nearly one in five children under five, while central and southern regions have seen rates double. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has warned of famine for months but has yet to officially declare one, citing a lack of access to Gaza to gather data\u2014an outcome of Israeli restrictions.\nGet the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: https://bit.ly/4eJ37pE | Apple App Store: https://bit.ly/3ZL7iNv\nThe aid distribution effort is plagued by breakdowns. According to the UN World Food Program, 55 trucks that entered Gaza via Zikim and Kerem Shalom crossings on Monday were \u201clooted by starving people\u201d before they reached storage facilities. Air-drops, also part of Israel\u2019s response, are limited in impact and have caused injuries or deaths on the ground. On Sunday and Monday, the IDF dropped just 48 food packages.\nIsrael blames Hamas for siphoning off aid and inciting chaos. Netanyahu reiterated, \u201cHamas, which openly uses civilians as human shields, operates from hospitals and uses schools and kindergartens to store weapons, has been stealing aid from the Gaza population many times by shooting Palestinians.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cWhile the situation in Gaza is difficult and Israel has been working to ensure aid delivery, Hamas benefits from attempting to fuel the perception of a humanitarian crisis.\u201d\nDespite these claims, the UN and partner organizations say looting isn't systematic and generally stops when enough aid flows in. Aid workers have also reported hundreds of Palestinian deaths at distribution sites due to crowd crushes or IDF fire. Israel said IDF troops fire warning shots to disperse threats.\nThe UN says trucks are the most effective way to deliver aid, each carrying about 19 tons of supplies. But Israeli restrictions slow or block distribution. For every aid delivery left near the border, the UN must request IDF permission to collect it. Over half of such requests have been delayed or denied in the past three months.\nEven when collected, aid trucks are frequently overwhelmed by hungry crowds or armed gangs. Hamas\u2019s civilian police once secured routes but stopped after IDF airstrikes targeted them. Netanyahu emphasized that the war's aims remain unchanged. Speaking Monday at IDF base, he said, \u201cWe have work to complete\u2014eliminating Hamas and bringing our hostages home. We won\u2019t relent for a moment. These two goals are intertwined.\u201d\nStill, cracks are emerging. A senior Israeli official said after a Cabinet meeting, \u201cRight now, the only thing certain is that Netanyahu wants a deal\u2014but it\u2019s far from clear that Hamas does. In the coming days, Israel will try to exhaust the chances for a deal and if that fails, it will need to make tough decisions.\u201d\nMeanwhile, at a UN conference hosted by France and Saudi Arabia on a two-state solution, Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa called on Hamas to relinquish control of Gaza. \u201cThe Palestinian Authority is ready to take responsibility for governance and security in Gaza with Arab and international support,\u201d he said."

      "text": "Israel says hundreds of truckloads of aid are waiting to enter Gaza. Why can\u2019t the UN bring them in?\nIsrael says hundreds of truckloads of aid are waiting to enter Gaza. Why can\u2019t the UN bring them in?\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) \u2014 The United Nations and experts say that Palestinians in Gaza are at risk of famine, with reports of increasing numbers of people dying from causes related to malnutrition.\nYet Israel says hundreds of truckloads of aid are waiting at the border for the U.N. to distribute in Gaza. On Thursday, Israel\u2019s military took journalists to the Gaza side of the Kerem Shalom crossing where hundreds of boxes of aid were on pallets filling a huge lot.\nIsrael says it has allowed in around 4,500 aid trucks since it lifted a total blockade in May \u2014around 70 truckloads a day, one of the lowest rates of the war and far less than the several hundred the U.N. says are needed each day.\nIsrael says it lets in enough aid and faults U.N. agencies for not doing enough to retrieve and get it to those in need. The U.N. says it is hampered by Israeli military restrictions on its movements and incidents of criminal looting.\nHere\u2019s a look at why the aid can\u2019t be delivered.\nUnsafe routes, bureaucracy and access denials\nTo retrieve the aid at the border \u2014 or move around most of the Gaza Strip \u2014 U.N. trucks must enter zones controlled by the military after obtaining its permission. Once the aid is loaded, the trucks must get safely to the population. The whole trip can take 20 hours, the U.N. says.\nLarge crowds of desperate people, as well as criminal gangs, overwhelm trucks as they enter and strip off the supplies. Witnesses say Israeli troops regularly open fire on the crowds, causing deaths and injuries.\n\u201cTaken together, these factors have put people and humanitarian staff at grave risk and forced aid agencies on many occasions to pause the collection of cargo from crossings controlled by the Israeli authorities,\u201d said Olga Cherevko, a spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA.\nAt least 79 Palestinians were killed while trying to get aid entering Gaza this week, according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry. A U.N. official who was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said Israeli forces opened fire toward crowds who tried to take food from an entering truck convoy. Israel\u2019s military said soldiers shot at a gathering of thousands of Palestinians in northern Gaza who posed a threat, and it was aware of some casualties.\nOn its website, OCHA said there is a breakdown of law and order, which is partly due to the collapse of Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run civilian police force, leading to insecurity at the crossings and for convoys moving within Gaza. It said this is further compounded by the increase of armed gangs.\nThe military frequently assigns routes for trucks to use that are \u201cunsuitable, either impassable for long truck convoys, passing through crowded markets, or controlled by dangerous gangs,\u201d OCHA said. When the U.N. objects to a route, the military provides few alternatives, it said.\nThe U.N. also struggles with facilitation from the military. It says more than half its movement requests, 506 out of 894, were either denied or impeded by the military in May, June and July.\nThere are also regular delays by Israel\u2019s forces in coordination. The delays result in lost time, difficulty planning and wasted resources as convoys spend hours waiting for the \u201cgreen light to move only to be denied,\u201d OCHA said.\nIsrael says it imposes no limit on aid trucks entering Gaza\nIsrael says it doesn\u2019t limit the truckloads of aid coming into Gaza and that assessments of roads in Gaza are conducted weekly where it looks for the best ways to provide access for the international community.\nCol. Abdullah Halaby, a top official in COGAT, the Israeli military agency in charge of transferring aid to the territory, said there are several crossings open.\n\u201cWe encourage our friends and our colleagues from the international community to do the collection, and to distribute the humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza,\u201d he said.\nAn Israeli security official who was not allowed to be named in line with military procedures told reporters this week that the U.N. wanted to use roads that were not approved.\nHe said the army offered to escort the aid groups but they refused.\nU.N. says letting enough aid in daily will solve the problem\nFor much of the war, U.N. agencies were able to safely deliver aid to those who need it, despite Israeli restrictions and occasional attacks and looting. The Hamas-run police provided public security. But as Israeli airstrikes targeted the police force, it has been unable to operate.\nThe U.N. says being escorted by Israel\u2019s army could bring harm to civilians, citing shootings and killings by Israeli troops surrounding aid operations.\nThe U.N. and aid groups also say that looting of trucks lessens or stops entirely when enough aid is allowed into Gaza.\n\u201cThe best protection for us is community buy-in,\u201d said U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric. \u201cAnd to get that community buy-in, communities have to understand that trucks will come every day, that food will come every day.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re asking for,\u201d he said.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Edith M.

      "text": "Israeli forces have killed over 1,000 aid-seekers in Gaza since May, the U.N. says\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip \u2014 More than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since May while trying to get food in the Gaza Strip, mostly near aid sites run by an American contractor, the U.N. human rights office said Tuesday.\nMeanwhile, Israeli strikes killed 25 people across Gaza, according to local health officials.\nDesperation is mounting in the Palestinian territory of more than 2 million, which experts say is at risk of famine because of Israel's blockade and nearly two-year offensive. A breakdown of law and order has led to widespread looting and contributed to chaos and violence around aid deliveries.\nIsrael accuses Hamas of siphoning off aid \u2014 without providing evidence of widespread diversion \u2014 and blames U.N. agencies for failing to deliver food it has allowed in. The military says it has only fired warning shots near aid sites. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an Israeli-backed American contractor, rejected what it said were \"false and exaggerated statistics\" from the United Nations.\nThe Gaza Health Ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, said Tuesday that 80 children have died from starvation since the beginning of the war, while 21 adults have since Sunday. The ministry only recently began tracking deaths from malnutrition in adults.\nThe deaths could not be independently verified, but U.N. officials and major international aid groups say the conditions for starvation exist in Gaza. During hunger crises, people can die from malnutrition or from common illnesses or injuries that the body is not strong enough to fight.\nIsrael eased a 2\u00bd-month blockade in May, allowing a trickle of aid in through the longstanding U.N.-run system and the newly created GHF. Aid groups say it's not nearly enough.\n\"I do it for my children\"\nDozens of Palestinians lined up Tuesday outside a charity kitchen in Gaza City, hoping for a bowl of watery tomato soup. The lucky ones got small chunks of eggplant. As supplies ran out, people holding pots pushed and shoved to get to the front.\nNadia Mdoukh, a pregnant woman who was displaced from her home and lives in a tent with her husband and three children, said she worries about being shoved or trampled on, and about heat stroke as daytime temperatures hover above 90 F (32 C).\n\"I do it for my children,\" she said. \"This is famine \u2014 there is no bread or flour.\"\nThe U.N. World Food Program says Gaza's hunger crisis has reached \"new and astonishing levels of desperation.\" Ross Smith, the agency's director for emergencies, told reporters Monday that nearly 100,000 women and children are suffering from severe acute malnutrition, and a third of Gaza's population is going without food for multiple days in a row.\nMedGlobal, a charity working in Gaza, said five children as young as 3 months had died from starvation in the past three days.\n\"This is a deliberate and human-made disaster,\" said Joseph Belliveau, its executive director. \"Those children died because there is not enough food in Gaza and not enough medicines, including IV fluids and therapeutic formula, to revive them.\"\nThe charity said food is in such short supply that its own staff members suffer dizziness and headaches.\nAid delivery model criticized\nOf the 1,054 people killed while trying to get food since late May, 766 were killed while heading to sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, according to the U.N. human rights office. The others were killed when gunfire erupted around U.N. convoys or aid sites.\nThameen al-Kheetan, a spokesperson for the U.N. rights office, says its figures come from \"multiple reliable sources on the ground,\" including medics, humanitarian and human rights organizations. He said the numbers were still being verified according to the office's strict methodology.\nPalestinian witnesses and health officials say Israeli forces regularly fire toward crowds of thousands of people heading to the GHF sites. The military says it has only fired warning shots, and GHF says its armed contractors have only fired into the air on a few occasions to try to prevent stampedes.\nA joint statement from 28 Western-aligned countries on Monday condemned the \"the drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians.\"\n\"The Israeli government's aid delivery model is dangerous, fuels instability and deprives Gazans of human dignity,\" read the statement, which was signed by the United Kingdom, France and other countries friendly to Israel. \"The Israeli government's denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable.\"\nIsrael and the United States rejected the statement, blaming Hamas for prolonging the war by not accepting Israeli terms for a ceasefire and the release of hostages abducted in the militant-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which triggered the fighting.\nHamas has said it will release the remaining hostages only in return for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal. Israel says it will keep fighting until Hamas has been defeated or disarmed.\nStrikes on tents sheltering the displaced\nIsraeli strikes killed at least 25 people Tuesday across Gaza, according to local health officials.\nOne strike hit tents sheltering displaced people in the built-up seaside Shati refugee camp in Gaza City, killing at least 12 people, according to Shifa Hospital, which received the casualties. The Israeli military said that it wasn't aware of such a strike by its forces.\nThe dead included three women and three children, the hospital director, Dr. Mohamed Abu Selmiya, told The Associated Press. Thirty-eight other Palestinians were wounded, he said.\nAn overnight strike that hit crowds of Palestinians waiting for aid trucks in Gaza City killed eight, hospitals said. At least 118 were wounded, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent.\n\"A bag of flour covered in blood and death,\" said Mohammed Issam, who was in the crowd and said some people were run over by trucks in the chaos. \"How long will this humiliation continue?\"\nThe Israeli military had no immediate comment on that strike. Israel blames the deaths of Palestinian civilians on Hamas, because the militants operate in densely populated areas.\nIsrael renewed its offensive in March with a surprise bombardment after ending an earlier ceasefire. Talks on another truce have dragged on for weeks despite pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump.\nHamas-led militants abducted 251 people in the Oct. 7 attack, and killed around 1,200 people. Fewer than half of the 50 hostages still in Gaza are believed to be alive.\nMore than 59,000 Palestinians have been killed during the war, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Its count doesn't distinguish between militants and civilians, but the ministry says that more than half of the dead are women and children. The U.N. and other international organizations see it as the most reliable source of data on casualties."

      "text": "United Nations agencies and NGOs call on Israeli authorities to rescind the requirement introduced on 9 March obliging international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to share sensitive personal information about their Palestinian employees or face termination of their humanitarian operations in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.\nUnless urgent action is taken, humanitarian organizations warn that most international NGO partners could be de-registered by 9 September or sooner \u2013 forcing them to withdraw all international staff and preventing them from providing critical, life-saving humanitarian assistance to Palestinians. This requirement is part of a set of new restrictive conditions for international NGOs which include potential consequences for public criticism of policies and practices of the Government of Israel.\nAlready, NGOs that are not registered under the new system are prohibited from sending any supplies to Gaza. In July this year, Israeli authorities rejected repeated requests by 29 NGOs to ship humanitarian aid to Gaza citing the organizations as \u201cnot authorized\". This policy has already prevented the delivery of life-saving aid including medicine, food, and hygiene items. This most profoundly affects women, children, older people, and persons with disabilities, further aggravating the risk of being subjected to abuse and exploitation.\nInternational NGOs also provide critical support to Palestinian NGOs who rely on international partners for supplies, funding, and technical support. Without this cooperation, their operations will be severed, cutting off even more communities from food, medical care, shelter and critical protection services.\nImpeding NGOs from participating in the collective humanitarian response violates Israel\u2019s obligations under international humanitarian law and comes at a time when we are receiving daily reports of death by starvation as Gaza faces famine conditions.\n* The Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) is a strategic decision-making forum led by the Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It brings together heads of UN entities and over 200 NGOs \u2013 both international and local \u2013 all working on humanitarian affairs in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip under internationally agreed humanitarian principles."

Muselmann was a term used by prisoners in Nazi concentration camps for those on the verge of death from starvation and exhaustion.\n\u201cGo into the tunnels, fight for a day like tens of thousands of reservists and then sign the petition,\u201d wrote Amedi, who was seriously injured in a Gaza explosion that killed six other soldiers in January 2024. \u201cWe\u2019re sick of you.\u201d\nActress Moran Atias posted online that her \u201cblood boiled\u201d when she was approached to sign the letter.\n\u201cTo do this when pictures of our brethren are filmed with the same cruel cynicism of pictures from the Holocaust, which we already went through,\u201d she wrote.\nA similar petition was signed by 1,400 architects, designers and visual artists.\n\u201cHorror on a historic scale is taking place before our eyes,\u201d that petition read. \u201cWe have the responsibility as humans and as Israelis facing horrors happening in our name against a population located a few kilometers from us, in an impossible reality and terrible suffering.\u201d\nWhile many in Israel have long called to end the war, the demands have largely been born out of a concern for the hostages and for the well-being of soldiers rather than focusing primarily on the suffering of Gazans.\nRecent weeks have seen an upswelling in concern around the world, and in Israel as well, as accounts of mass hunger inside the Strip have proliferated, with aid slow to reach Gazan civilians.\nThe Times of Israel Community."

And nobody said, Gee, thank you very much. And it would be nice to have at least a thank you.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re giving a lot of money, a lot of food, a lot of everything,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we weren\u2019t there, I think people would have starved, frankly. They would have starved, and it\u2019s not like they\u2019re eating well.\u201d\nThe actual figure given to the GHF by the US is $30 million, and the US is also far from the only country to donate humanitarian aid. It is not the largest donor, as the United Arab Emirates has given a larger percentage of assistance.\nREPORTER: Should Israel be doing more to allow food in Gaza?\nTRUMP: Say it?\nREPORTER: Should Israel be doing more to allow food in Gaza?\nTRUMP: What is she saying?\nSOMEONE ELSE: Should Israel be doing more to allow food in Gaza?\nTRUMP: You really at least want to have\u2026 pic.twitter.com/BJhUIXdxzM\n\u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) July 27, 2025\nNetanyahu hits back against starvation claims\nCommenting on the slew of changes that he approved to the aid system in Gaza on Saturday night, amid widespread international criticism over mounting reports of starvation-related deaths, Netanyahu, like Trump, insisted that if not for him, Gazans would have starved long ago.\nSpeaking at a Christian conference in Jerusalem hosted by Trump adviser and prominent Evangelical pastor Paula White, Netanyahu said: \u201cThere is no policy of starvation in Gaza, and there is no starvation in Gaza.\u201d\nHe claimed that Israel had \u201cenabled the amount required by international law\u201d to enter the Strip, which he said amounted to some 1.9 million tons of aid since the start of the war, which began with Hamas\u2019s October 7, 2023, invasion and massacre in southern Israel.\nIsrael \u201cenabled humanitarian aid throughout the duration of the war\u2026Otherwise, there would be no Gazans,\u201d Netanyahu declared, blaming Hamas for intercepting supplies and then \u201caccusing Israel of not supplying it.\u201d\nIn an effort to explain the sudden changes to Israel\u2019s aid policies introduced at the weekend, including first-ever Israeli aid drops, Netanyahu said the decision to implement 10-hour daily humanitarian pauses in densely populated parts of the Strip came after some \u201cwell-intended\u201d agencies, as well as the United Nations, made \u201cexcuses\u201d not to deliver aid behind combat zones, despite there being \u201csafe corridors.\u201d\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve just announced that formally,\u201d he said, claiming that there have always been safe routes for UN convoys to travel on. \u201cThere are safe corridors, and the UN has no excuses left. No excuses left. Stop lying\u2026 Stop accusing Israel deliberately of this egregious falsehood,\u201d he said.\nDuring the conference, Netanyahu thanked evangelical Zionists for standing with Israel against what he said were false allegations surrounding the war in Gaza.\n\u201cWe have an eighth front \u2014 the battle for truth. And I can think of no one who can carry this battle alongside with us\u2026 better than [our] many Christian friends.\u201d\nHe warned that the Israeli-Christian alliance was \u201cbeing challenged today by\u2026 Islamist fundamentalism that seeks to subjugate all Muslims they view as infidels, [and] eradicate the American \u2014 and obviously the Israeli \u2014 presence in the Middle East.\u201d\nEarlier on Sunday, the premier similarly dismissed the UN\u2019s claims about Gaza aid deliveries during a visit to the Ramon Air Force Base in the Negev Desert.\nIn what appeared to be an appeal to his far-right coalition allies and supporters, who argue that allowing aid to enter the Strip hinders the war effort, Netanyahu said that even while Israel would \u201ccontinue to fight\u2026 until complete victory,\u201d it would also have to continue to allow supplies into Gaza.\n\u201cWe will eliminate Hamas,\u201d the premier said. But, he stressed, \u201cin any path we choose, we will have to continue to allow the entry of minimal humanitarian supplies.\u201d And, he added, \u201cwe have done this until now.\u201d\nContrary to Netanyahu\u2019s claim, however, Israel has not always allowed supplies, minimal or otherwise, to enter the war-torn Gaza Strip, as it implemented a total blockade on the territory and barred all aid from entering between March and May of this year.\nEven once aid resumed, it was in markedly lower quantities, with much of it being distributed by the controversial US- and Israel-backed GHF, in a manner that has drawn international backlash over reports of hundreds of aid-seekers being shot dead in near-daily incidents.\nOnly last week, amid accusations that Israel was starving Gazans, did Netanyahu drastically increase the amount and channels of aid entering Gaza.\nIDF Spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin similarly insisted on Sunday that Israel had not subjected the Palestinian population in the Gaza Strip to starvation, and maintained that Israel cares more about Gazan civilians than Hamas does.\n\u201cWe are continuing to lead a process of bringing humanitarian aid, while continuing the fighting. Israel is the one that initiated the [GHF] aid distribution sites\u2026 This is to prevent famine in Gaza,\u201d Defrin said in a press conference, listing the ways in which Israel was allowing aid to enter and be transported across the Strip.\nDefrin repeated the claim that Hamas is stealing aid from civilians, hiding it in tunnels, and at the same time carrying out a \u201cfalse campaign on starvation in the Gaza Strip.\u201d\n\u201cThe photos emerging from Gaza are difficult, and they are part of this false campaign,\u201d he said, reiterating that there is \u201cno [deliberate] starvation in the Gaza Strip,\u201d and that Israel was \u201coperating according to international law.\u201d\n\u201cWe care about the nutrition of the residents of Gaza more than Hamas does,\u201d he declared. \u201cHamas works intentionally to worsen the condition of the population. Hamas tries with all its might to sabotage the [GHF] aid distribution sites and the arrival of the aid to the Strip.\u201d\nFuture uncertain after ceasefire talks stall\nWhile speaking to reporters in Scotland on Sunday, Trump also turned to the decision to pull negotiators from Qatar amid anger at Hamas\u2019s response to the latest ceasefire and hostage proposal.\nHe said that \u201cIsrael will have to make a decision\u201d regarding the war and the remaining 50 hostages still held by Gaza\u2019s terror groups. \u201cI know what I would do, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to say it,\u201d Trump said.\nHe claimed that he had predicted the breakdown in talks, assessing that Hamas would not want to release the final hostages because they were its last bargaining chips.\nTaking a more blunt approach than Trump on Sunday was leading Republican senator Lindsey Graham, who suggested in an interview with NBC News that Israel would not be able to negotiate a satisfactory end to the war in Gaza, and would have no choice but to take control of the Strip.\nGraham is a longtime supporter of Israel who frequently visits the country and is close to Netanyahu.\n\u201cI think President Trump has come to believe, and I certainly have come to believe, there\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to negotiate an end of this war with Hamas,\u201d said the South Carolina senator, intimating that the president had soured on the prospect of a deal.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to do in Gaza what we did in Tokyo and Berlin \u2014 take the place by force and start over again, presenting a better future for the Palestinians, hopefully having the Arabs take over the West Bank and Gaza,\u201d he said, referring to the US-led allied occupation of the Japanese and German capitals after World War Two.\nGrowing pressure to recognize Palestinian state\nEven as Israel weighs its next steps in the Gaza Strip, pressure has been growing among its European allies to follow France\u2019s lead and unilaterally recognize a Palestinian State.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron announced on Thursday that his country would formally recognize a Palestinian state during a UN meeting in September.\nThe decision made Paris the most powerful European nation to advance such a move, after Norway, Spain, Ireland and Slovenia all announced their recognition in the months following the outbreak of the Gaza war.\nAmong those under pressure to follow Macron\u2019s lead is British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who was planning to recall his cabinet from their summer break to discuss the situation in Gaza, the Financial Times reported Sunday.\nThe UK parliament and cabinet are currently in a summer recess until September 1.\nThe recall, planned for next week, was reportedly decided on after Starmer said Friday the British government would recognize a Palestinian state only as part of a negotiated peace deal, disappointing many in his Labour Party who want him to follow France in taking swifter action.\nMore than 220 members of parliament in the UK, representing about a third of the House of Commons and mostly Labour members, wrote to Starmer on Friday, urging him to reconsider the issue.\nAlso under the spotlight is German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, after Berlin declined to join its European allies earlier this month in signing a letter condemning Israel\u2019s restrictions on Gaza aid.\nMerz said Sunday that he had spoken to Netanyahu by phone, and had urged him to do \u201ceverything in his power to bring about an immediate ceasefire\u2026 and allow urgently needed humanitarian aid to reach the starving civilian population in Gaza without delay.\u201d\nWe will closely monitor developments and, in coordination with France, the UK, other European partners, the United States, and Arab states, decide in the coming days how we can contribute to improving the situation. 2/2\n\u2014 Bundeskanzler Friedrich Merz (@bundeskanzler) July 27, 2025\n\u201cWe will closely monitor developments and, in coordination with France, the UK, other European partners, the United States, and Arab states, decide in the coming days how we can contribute to improving the situation,\u201d Merz said.\nTimes of Israel staff and agencies contributed to this report.\nThe Times of Israel Community."
