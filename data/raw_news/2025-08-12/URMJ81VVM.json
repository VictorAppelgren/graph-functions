  "description": "Demand for crude oil is now a concern after Trump's higher tariffs went into effect for dozens of U.S. trade partners.",
  "content": "Brent crude futures were up 52 cents, or 0.78%, at $66.95 a barrel by 1104 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 43 cents, or 0.67%, to $64.31. Brent was on track to be down 3.9% over the week while WTI was set to finish 4.5% lower than last Friday\u2019s close. Higher U.S. tariffs against a host of trade partners went into effect on Thursday, raising concern over economic activity and demand for crude oil, ANZ Bank analysts said in a note.\n\nThe latest tariffs arrive against a backdrop of an already weaker than expected U.S. labour market and Thursday\u2019s announcement by the Kremlin that Putin and Trump would meet in the coming days as trade tensions rise between the U.S. and Russia\u2019s oil customers. Trump this week threatened to increase tariffs on India if it kept buying Russian oil, which the market viewed as putting further pressure on Russia to reach a deal with the U.S., said independent analyst Tina Teng. Trump also said China, the largest buyer of Russian crude, could be hit with tariffs similar to those levied against Indian imports.\n\nThe potential meeting raises expectations of a diplomatic end to the war in Ukraine, which could lead to eased sanctions on Russia, with Russian stocks rallying after the news. \u201cThere could be a meeting between Trump and Putin in the near future, which could indicate that Trump is adopting a wait-and-see approach with regard to further sanctions against Russia and its allies,\u201d Commerzbank analysts said in a note.\n\n\u201cThe Russian leader is expected to insist on having his territorial demands granted, a hard sell for the invaded country, while his U.S. counterpart will push for a ceasefire,\u201d said PVM analyst Tamas Varga. \u201cNo breakthrough is anticipated, and the U.S. following through on its threat to impose secondary sanctions on those dealing in Russian energy \u2014 including China and India \u2014 remains a possibility.\u201d",

  "summary": "Brent crude futures were up by 0.78%, at $66.95 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose by 43 cents, or 0.67%, to $64.31. This comes as higher U.S. tariffs against a number of trade partners were implemented, raising concerns about economic activity and demand for crude oil. The latest tariffs come against a weaker than expected U.K. labour market and increased trade tensions between the U.N. and Russia's oil customers. The potential meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin could lead to an end to the Ukraine war, potentially leading to eased sanctions on Russia.",
