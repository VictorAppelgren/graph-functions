      "summary": "Washington, D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith has issued an executive order allowing limited cooperation with federal immigration authorities, following President Trump's federal takeover of the police department to address rising crime and homelessness. The order permits Metropolitan Police officers to share information during traffic stops but prohibits them from inquiring about immigration status or making arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants. This move has sparked mixed reactions, with supporters praising efforts to enhance public safety, while opponents argue it undermines local governance and civil rights.",
