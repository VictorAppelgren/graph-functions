      "feedback": "The article is clear but a few quick fixes will tighten it up: correct the typo “reaosn” to “reason” in the description; delete the duplicated “Title: Why Do Toyo Tires Have Walnut Shells In Them?” line that appears twice; trim the long “Scraped Source 1” block (the Winter‑vs‑All‑Season article) – it’s not needed in the main piece and only adds clutter; replace the generic “Description” paragraph with a concise one‑sentence hook that highlights the walnut‑shell innovation; add an inline citation after the claim that walnut shells “naturally extremely hard, allowing them to scratch against icy, slippery road surfaces to generate high levels of friction” (e.g., link to a Toyo technical note or a tire‑compound study); and finally, adjust the categories to “Automotive > Tires” and “Shopping > Product Reviews” for better discoverability.",
