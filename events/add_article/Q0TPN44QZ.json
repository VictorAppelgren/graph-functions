      "title": "UEFA charges Israeli and Polish clubs over political fan banners that raised diplomatic tension",
      "summary": "UEFA opened a disciplinary case after Maccabi Haifa fans displayed the slogan “Murderers since 1939” at a Conference League match against Rakow Czestochowa, prompting condemnation from the Polish president and Israel’s embassy. The Polish government and Israeli ambassador expressed outrage, and both clubs were charged with transmitting a message not fit for a sports event, with possible fines or stadium closures pending. The incident follows a week‑long clash in which Rakow fans also displayed a banner accusing Israel of murder. UEFA has faced criticism for its own political messaging, having recently shown anti‑violence slogans at high‑profile matches while not sanctioning a PSG banner calling for a stop to Gaza genocide.",
