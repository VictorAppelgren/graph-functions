      "text": "Fortune 500-proven platform provides unprecedented operational intelligence and eliminates the need for human middleware\nSAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 14, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- XOPS, the autonomous IT company, today emerged from stealth with $40 million in funding to transform IT operations for the world's most complex enterprises. Its intelligent platform solves the longstanding challenges of fragmented and inefficient IT operations, reducing costs and increasing operational efficiency by astonishing margins while improving the employee experience. The round was co-led by Activant Capital and FPV Ventures, with Andrew Steele (Activant) and Pegah Ebrahimi (FPV) joining the XOPS board of directors.\nAs the first Active System of Intelligence, XOPS' platform autonomously runs business-critical IT operations, providing total visibility across fragmented enterprise ecosystems, unprecedented operational intelligence, and complete lifecycle context through the platform's living knowledge graph so XOPS legion of robots can orchestrate and execute complex, end-to-end processes.\n\"The sheer volume and velocity of telemetry generated by modern enterprises have long surpassed human cognitive capacity,\" said Mayan Mathen, co-founder and CEO of XOPS, a serial entrepreneur and former CTO of NTT with 25+ years dedicated to Fortune 500 technology challenges. \"XOPS delivers the autonomous systems needed to process, understand, and act on this operational intelligence without human intervention.\"\nXOPS technology represents a fundamental shift from traditional automation. While existing systems depend heavily on human operators, often orchestrating rather than doing, XOPS moves IT pros into a strategic oversight role, supervising autonomous systems that execute work across systems and departments independently.\nAlready in use by Fortune 500 companies, XOPS is delivering measurable results. One enterprise reduced staffing requirements on a major annual initiative by 95% and cut process time from days to under an hour \u2013 all while achieving 100% asset tracking accuracy through fully autonomous workflows. Another now handles device refresh cycles, employee onboarding and software license optimization without human intervention, ensuring continuous compliance and minimal downtime.\n\"The next generation of software will be defined by systems of intelligence\u2014platforms that drive outcomes autonomously. XOPS is one of the rare few already doing that at scale inside the world's largest enterprises,\" said Andrew Steele, partner at Activant Capital. \"What they've built is next level in both scope and ROI, and it takes a team of this caliber to make that real. We're proud to be backing them.\"\nXOPS was co-founded by Mayan Mathen and Andrew Robinson. The leadership team brings deep enterprise IT expertise:\n- Chief Product Officer Cisco Sanchez, former CIO at Qualcomm and FedEx Ground, ensures XOPS delivers the intelligence, scale, and resilience demanded by the Fortune 100.\n- Chief Revenue Officer Brandon Kwong, who scaled Box from $10M to over $1B as a Global Vice President, is poised to drive rapid market adoption.\n- Chief Operating Officer Parisa Naseralavi, fresh from her successful tenure as SVP of Global Operations & Monetization at ServiceNow, is set to drive world-class GTM and operational excellence from day one.\n\"Having been CIO and COO for one of the largest banks, I know first-hand the price of siloed systems and wasting IT talent on manual processes,\" said Pegah Ebrahimi, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of FPV Ventures. \"XOPS has the potential to turn enterprise IT from a cost center into a competitive advantage.\"\nBacked by leading investors and trusted by Fortune 500 companies, XOPS is already delivering the future of autonomous IT. The company is scaling rapidly and continuing to expand its platform capabilities to support the growing demand for intelligent, end-to-end operational systems.\nAbout XOPS\nXOPS, the autonomous IT company, powers business-critical IT operations for the world's largest enterprises. As the pioneering active System of Intelligence, XOPS delivers total visibility across enterprise systems, unprecedented operational intelligence, and complete lifecycle context. The platform deploys in days, bringing immediate intelligence to existing system investments while enabling truly autonomous operations with a legion of XOPS robots. From employee onboarding to software license optimization and far beyond, IT leaders reclaim resources and reduce risk, while their organizations achieve an average 20% cost savings, 60% process acceleration, and 80% error reduction.
