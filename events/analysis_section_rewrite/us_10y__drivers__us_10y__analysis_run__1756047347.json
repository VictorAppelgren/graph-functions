      "feedback": "This draft does a solid job tying macro regime shifts, policy, flows, and valuation to Ford’s ballast thesis, but to reach world‑class quality it should (1) articulate a tight causal chain: Regime A policy easing (~25–50 bp) and a mid‑4% 10‑year yield with a softer dollar should lift AI‑capex appetite and compress discount rates, reinforcing durable cash‑flow moats and multiples for cash generators like Ford; (2) convert to a clear Base/Upside/Downside structure with explicit triggers and quantified sensitivities anchored in the sources (Sept rate cut timing; 10‑year yield path toward mid‑4%; dollar trajectory; inflation prints) and show how those signals propagate to Ford’s EV margin trajectory and ROIC against a ROIC/WACC hurdle; (3) ground the Ford view in first principles by defining a concrete ROIC hurdle (ROIC must exceed WACC) and specifying a Model E EBIT inflection point and EV gross‑margin target needed to lift ROIC meaningfully, rather than relying on qualitative ballast; (4) intensify quantification using the numbers in the sources (Ford 5% yield; forward P/E ~10.3x; Q2 EV loss ≈ $1.3B; F‑Series leadership; IEA +2.5 mbpd in 2025; mid‑4% yields) and map how each drives price; (5) strengthen S&P 500 integration by naming the pillars (MSFT/Shopify for contracted cloud revenue; UNH/LULU for defensives; Schlumberger for shareholder‑yield) and reconcile any tensions; (6) deliver a concise watchlist of decisive signals (Ford EV margin trajectory; Model E EBIT progress; oil/inflation data; Fed guidance; Intel’s governance signal) with citations after each claim (W2622L6WW; GX057ADL7; J99EM2TPZ).",
