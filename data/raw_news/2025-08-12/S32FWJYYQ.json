      "text": "Will the Skims face wrap snatch your chin? Here's what experts say\nSome medical professionals can't seem to wrap their heads around the hype of the latest Skims release.\nKim Kardashian's well-known shapewear brand released a $48 now sold out \"Seamless Sculpt Face Wrap\" that features \"collagen yarns for ultra-soft support,\" targeting those who have an elaborate morning shed routine.\nIn an Instagram story, the reality television star and businesswoman reportedly praised the conversation starter product as a \"necessity,\" saying that it \"just snatches your little chinny chin chin.\"\nTouted as Skims' \"first-ever face innovation,\" it went viral online, prompting a wave of plastic surgeons to chime in on social media with criticisms on its effectiveness, encouraging people to think twice before purchasing.\nDoctors argued that consumers might not get the results they are hoping for with the popular beauty hack.\nWill it snatch your chin for long? Experts say no.\nDr. Vinod Chopra, based in Fairfax, Virginia, is one of the many surgeons who voiced his opinion on TikTok. He told USA TODAY that a face wrap would typically be recommended to his patients after they underwent specific surgeries like a neck liposuction, a neck lift, buccal fat pad removal, or a face lift.\n\"The best use of a product like this would be post-surgical to help reduce swelling and to help maintain the shape of a surgical result,\" Chopra stated. \"For common day-to-day use, I think that as you use something like this, it's going to decrease swelling or fluid in the area secondary to the compression itself, but it's not going to have a long-lasting effect.\"\nDr. Sarmela Sunder agreed. She explained that the face wrap could be effective if used before an outing: \"Similar to a jade roller or a gua sha tool, you can do it as you're getting ready for an event or the night before, and I think it'll have some great results for the day.\"\n\"For people that are considering using it as a treatment or as a substitute for a facelift or a skin tightening device, they're just going to be misled,\" said the facial plastic surgeon located in Beverly Hills, California.\nSunder also said the face wrap and similar products are not ideal for everyone, raising concerns about consumers with TMJ (temporomandibular joint disorder) and sensitive or acne-prone skin.\n\"People with TMJ issues, jaw alignment issues, wearing a garment like this long term can cause upward pressure on the TMJ joint,\" Sunder explained. \"The other thing that we can see is skin irritation. People can break out from the fabric. There can be true irritation abrasions from the garment itself.\"\nThe desire for a contoured, sculpted look is growing\nSkims' take on the face wrap comes amid a rise in plastic surgeries and enhancements with preventative aesthetic procedures, particularly among Gen Z. For instance, facial contouring has become popular as a result of social media.\n\"An aesthetically balanced, pleasing face, jawline, and neckline is something that everyone strives for, and everyone wants to look great and feel great,\" Chopra said. \"Doing treatments and using products that have proven benefits is a great thing to do. But, I don't necessarily think that people should spend their hard-earned dollars on treatments that aren't going to give them any clinical, long-term benefit.\"\nExperts have warned about the social connection between the glossy, highly edited online culture and surgeries, as well as the monumental role celebrities play in unrealistic beauty standards and desirability politics, especially in marketing.\nThe face wrap product sold at a company like Skims could \"send this message to young women that what is desirable is to have a thin, V-line face, which I think is perhaps a Eurocentric beauty aesthetic,\" stated Sunder, who is also the mother of a teenage daughter.\n\"I think it's a little problematic that it might be reaching an audience that we don't want to send that message to, and capitalizing on women's insecurities and reinforcing these narrow beauty ideals that are tied to these 'snatched' facial features.\"\nOther alternatives, dupes\nChopra and Sunder suggest that consumers research before committing to any treatment, noting that there are effective non-surgical procedures that yield better results for skin rejuvenation than using face wraps.\nOther options include radio frequency skin tightening, microneedling, and CO2 laser resurfacing.\n\"Then just regular skin health, like good medical-grade skin care, using sunscreen with the appropriate SPF,\" Chopra added.\nAlthough some consumers might want to splurge for the Skims label, there are face wrap dupes on Amazon as low as $8.99: \"If the result is for compression, then I don't think you need to spend $48 on it. There are a lot of great alternatives that are less expensive,\" he continued.\nSkims did not respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.\nTaylor Ardrey is a news reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "'The Gilded Age' Season 4: What we know about release date, cast, more\nSpoiler alert: This story includes details from episodes of Season 3 of \"The Gilded Age.\"\n\"The Gilded Age\" had viewers on the edge of their seats this season with plenty of scandal, betrayals and tragedies.\nBertha Russell (Carrie Coon) finally made it, hosting the must-attend ball of the season and settling her daughter Gladys (Taissa Farmiga) into her new home, despite the initial setbacks and tensions. However, her woes are far from over after her husband George (Morgan Spector) informs her that, despite her nursing him back to health after a gunshot wound and helping his business save face, he has still not forgiven her for her past offenses and may not even love her anymore.\nGeorge, meanwhile, came out on top after coming dangerously close to losing his life, railroad company and fortune this season after overleveraging his businesses and being unable to make a few crucial deals. After one of his enemies, the identity of whom is unknown, arranges for him to be shot at the end of Episode 7, George is rushed home rather than the hospital to keep news of the shooting quiet, where Dr. William Kirkland (Jordan Donica) saves George's life, with help from Marian (Louisa Jacobson).\nAnd Dr. Kirkland wasn't just busy saving lives this episode. The tall, handsome physician gets down on one knee for Peggy (Den\u00e9e Benton) and the two finally seemingly get their happily ever after. The couple is not the only one intending to walk down the aisle next season. Oscar (Blake Ritson) suggests marriage to wealthy widow Mrs. Winterton (Kelley Curran), Bertha's former maid and recent social climber, while his cousin Marian makes up with Larry Russell (Harry Richardson), which means their engagement might be back on.\nWith plenty of loose threads and a lot still left to unpack, here's what we know so far about Season 4 of \"The Gilded Age.\"\nWill there be a Season 4 of 'The Gilded Age'?\nYes. HBO announced July 28 that \"The Gilded Age\" will return for a \"thrilling\" Season 4.\n\"Transporting us to 1880s New York City, Julian Fellowes and the enormously talented cast and crew have created a 'can't-miss it' entertainment experience from week to week, and we're delighted to continue exploring these characters' grand ambitions for what we promise will be a thrilling fourth season,\" HBO executive Francesca Orsi said in a statement.\nThe lavish period drama, which premiered in June, soared to new heights this season. Nearly 4.6 million viewers tuned in for the penultimate episode of Season 3 in its first three days, according to data shared by HBO. Overall viewership for Season 3 is almost 50% higher than the previous seasons with \"every episode showing consistent audience growth,\" HBO said.\nJoin our Watch Party! Sign up to receive USA TODAY's movie and TV recommendations right in your inbox\n'The Gilded Age' Season 4 release date\nHBO has not yet announced plans for Season 4 of \"The Gilded Age\" and it is not yet known when the new season will release. HBO hasn't previously been consistent as far as \"The Gilded Age\" release dates are concerned.\nWhile the first season premiered in January 2022, the second season landed almost two years later in October 2023.
