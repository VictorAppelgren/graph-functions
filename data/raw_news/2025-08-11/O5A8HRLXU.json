  "description": "The best beauty subscription boxes allow you to try different skincare and haircare products for an affordable price. See our top picks from BeautyFix, Allure and more.",
  "content": "Beauty subscriptions are a great way to try different products from both established and smaller indie brands that you may not have picked up for yourself while browsing. These services, like our top pick for best beauty subscription box from BeautyFix By Dermstore, deliver a curated selection of travel- and full-size products right to your doorstep. While most options offer a nice mix of makeup, skincare and haircare products, some subscriptions, such as Scentbird, specialize in fragrance.\n\nTo narrow down the list of winners, I considered the overall value for each subscription, brands included, categories covered, product sizes and quality of formulas before making the final selections. \u201cThese boxes are great for those who are too busy to spend hours in Sephora testing products,\u201d says makeup artist Alexa Rae Johnson. \u201cThey allow you to try new things you may not have picked up or formulas you may not have thought worked for you.\u201d From an expert-curated assortment to a fragrance subscription service, here are the best beauty subscription boxes in 2025.\n\u2022 More than 700 fragrances and colognes to choose from Perfumes and colognes can be pricey, and each scent can change or smells slightly different from person to person, which is why it\u2019s important to test a fragrance before committing to a full-size bottle. Here\u2019s where Scentbird comes in: You receive a 0.27-ounce designer fragrance every month that\u2019s handpicked based on your scent profile (fill out a quiz to get started, and re-take it as your preferences change). Scentbird has more than 700 fragrances and colognes to choose from, and you can pause or cancel your subscription at any time.\n\nAn Affordable Way To Try New Products From Top Brands Subscription period: Monthly or quarterly | Product size: Deluxe size samples, full-size | Value: $70 to $270\n\u2022 You can choose one (or more) products in each shipment\n\u2022 Can only upgrade quarterly Ipsy lets you discover new brands for less than $15 per month, making this an excellent value with some customization options.

      "text": "Red light therapy has long been used to reduce inflammation and improve skin texture. Thanks to modern technology, you don\u2019t have to book a dermatologist appointment to get the treatment\u2014LED masks offer similar benefits from the comfort of your couch. As the deputy editor who oversees Forbes Vetted\u2019s beauty content, I set out to select the best LED face masks that offer red light therapy (in addition to blue and near-infrared versions) and are worth investing in. Following an extensive months-long evaluation process with a panel of testers, the Dr. Dennis Gross DRx SpectraLite FaceWare Pro is my top pick because of its innovative design and multiple light modes.\nTo determine the best LED face masks that offer results and value, I consulted four skincare professionals and enlisted a panel of expert testers (including myself) to give hands-on insights.\nI researched dozens of models and tapped dermatologists and aestheticians for their guidance on which gold-standard features to consider. Then, I recruited a panel of seven testers over the age of 30 to test multiple masks that met these standards. After using each mask for a minimum of eight months (and counting), we evaluated them for factors such as ease of use, comfort, efficacy, safety and more. To note, all of our picks act as red light therapy masks, with some providing additional treatments such as vibration therapy or blue light, which targets acne and rosacea. (You can also read our in-depth Omnilux vs. CurrentBody comparison here.)\nAlthough it comes with a higher price tag than comparable options on the market, we chose this Dr. Dennis Gross mask as our winning pick because of how comfortable it is on, its versatility in targeting signs of aging as well as acne, and its quick treatment time of three minutes (which is well under the average). Our tester found it very easy to add this component to her daily skincare routine.\nFirm, Wireless Plastic Body Easily Holds Its Shape\nInstead of featuring silicone, as is common in other masks, this one is made of a rigid, lightweight plastic that\u2019s contoured to the shape of a face. Our tester found it to be more comfortable than others she\u2019s tried, and better at hugging her facial features. A silicone head strap keeps the mask on securely, and the completely wireless aspect makes it that much easier to use without juggling an attached controller.\nThree Treatment Modes For Different Results\nThe mask has three different treatment settings: a red light option to target signs of aging like fine lines and discoloration, a blue light version to help minimize acne, and a combination of the two to target various concerns in one go. Our tester used the blue light setting a few times while dealing with minor breakouts and noticed the redness around pimples disappearing a little faster than usual. According to the brand, it\u2019s safe to use the mask with your eyes open or closed, and without safety goggles (which can be purchased separately). Our tester didn\u2019t find the brightness of the LED lights to be overwhelming or irritating to her eyes, but she did feel more comfortable using it with her eyes closed.\nEasy Setup And Long-Lasting Battery\nSetting up the SpectraLite mask is very easy, according to our tester, thanks to clear and straightforward instructions. It comes in a drawstring bag with a USB charging cord, and took our tester about four hours to fully charge before first using it. She found that one full charge lasts 8 to 10 uses, so a little over a week if used daily, as recommended by the brand.\nThe HigherDose LED mask is our top pick for comfort, thanks to its flexible silicone body and three adjustable straps. It features two options for treatment length\u201410- and 20-minute red light and infrared sessions\u2014which are the longest out of the devices we tested in this roundup.\nRejuvenating, Glowy Results In Less Than 20 Minutes\nAccording to our testing, you don\u2019t have to wear it for a full 20 minutes each time you use it to get results. \u201cThe biggest benefit I notice is a post-mask glow,\u201d says one of our testers who has been using the device for over seven months. \u201cI feel like it rejuvenates my skin and makes it look more vibrant and healthy.\u201d She is also diligent about taking care of her skin using a consistent regimen and monthly facials.\nEasy Setup, With A Slightly Challenging Fit\nThe lightweight mask is easy to set up and get going (our tester generally got five 20-minute sessions out of a full charge), and the storage bag it comes in includes protective eye goggles, a charging cord for the controller and multiple adapters. The fit on this option was the trickiest for our testers, as the mask didn\u2019t always fit the lower portion of their faces even with three head straps to customize the fit. Also, the included goggles didn\u2019t help much with shielding eyes from the LED light.\nLike many red light therapy masks on the market, the Omnilux Contour Face is crafted out of flexible silicone with cutouts that allow the mask to wrap snugly around facial features. Our tester found this device to be super lightweight and very easy to set up and use. The mask features a single setting that\u2019s a combination of red light and near-infrared light therapy to address concerns like discoloration and redness. After consistently testing this over the course of several months, our tester noticed her skin tone looking \u201cslightly more even and glowy.\u201d\nDermatologist-Recommended And Highly Effective\nThe Omnilux Contour Face is also a favorite of dermatologist Dr. Corey L. Hartman\u2019s due to its design and the clinical research behind it. \u201cThe contour shape fits nearly everyone comfortably and enables the red light to reach all around the face for maximum efficacy,\u201d he says. \u201cThe device is FDA cleared for use and Omnilux backs up the claims with strong, clinically reviewed and published research.\nTwo Adjustable Head Straps, But No Eye Inserts\nThe mask features two adjustable head straps that help keep it in place, although our tester notes it\u2019s not so secure that she can move around while using it. It doesn\u2019t come with eye inserts or safety goggles, which would be helpful to shield against the bright lights; our tester didn\u2019t find them completely necessary though and just kept her eyes closed during sessions. Although it\u2019s technically wireless, it\u2019s powered by an oval handheld controller, which needs to be fully charged before plugging it in to use the mask. Charging time ranges from two to six hours, and our tester appreciated the multiple power adapters that came with the device.\nThe wildly popular CurrentBody LED face mask, spotted on celebrities and influencers alike (Sydney Sweeney takes hers with her while filming), is beloved for its use of red, near-infrared and deep near-infrared light to improve skin tone, texture and firmness. Similarly to some of the other masks on this list, this device uses flexible silicone and strategically cut holes to allow it to wrap closely around the face. While we originally tested the first generation mask, we\u2019ve had a tester evaluate the newer CurrentBody Series 2 for several weeks, and we think it\u2019s worth the upgrade. This update on the original has a significantly larger number of LED lights and an added chin section for fuller face coverage.\nBasic Setup With Secure Straps\nSetup is straightforward; this mask is wireless but comes with a controller that our tester charged for 4.5 hours using the USB-C cable. The mask was easy to secure with the larger strap that attaches at the back of the head, and an over-the-head strap that keeps the mask more securely in place.\nIncludes Removable Light-Blocking Eye Inserts\nThis device comes with pop in rubber eye inserts to help block out the bright LEDs. During her testing, our tester found that the eye inserts were effective at shielding her eyes from the lights, and they allowed her to keep her eyes open and complete other tasks\u2014like checking email\u2014while wearing the mask. While this version molded more closely to her face in certain areas without the inserts in, she found that she was still able to achieve an adequate fit.\nTherabody\u2019s TheraFace is a uniquely versatile LED mask, with a number of features that set it apart from the rest. It features the most LED lights out of all the devices we evaluated: 648 in three light modes (red, red and infrared, and blue). I\u2019ve been using this mask consistently for over a year, and since I incorporated it into my skincare routine, I\u2019ve been pleased with my overall skin texture and tone. I do think it\u2019s just one helpful element in a robust regimen, and like most effective at-home treatments won\u2019t necessarily be a quick fix for any one concern.\nWide Range Of Treatments With Massaging Vibration\nIt offers a variety of treatments, including an all-encompassing nine-minute session that cycles through all of the light modes; you can also choose single light mode treatments to better target a specific skin concern. Most interestingly, it pairs gentle massaging vibration with light therapy to make the whole session especially relaxing.\nHeavy, But Still Comfortable\nAt 1.3 pounds, it\u2019s on the heavier side and slightly bulky, but I find that\u2019s easily justified by its advanced technology. It\u2019s very well designed, with a vertical and horizontal head strap that secures the whole thing in place. The mask also comes with a very soft, removable eye shield, which really blocks the light from my eyes during a session (I\u2019m very comfortable with my eyes open thanks to this). The eye shields do end up leaving pressure marks on my upper cheekbones, which don\u2019t bother me since they eventually go away; alternatively they can be removed.\nQuick To Set Up And Charge\nSetting up the TheraFace is very simple; it takes about 1.5 hours to fully charge, and it gives me about 108 minutes of use (which amounts to 12 nine-minute sessions) before needing recharging. Like the Dennis Gross mask, this one is completely cordless, with buttons on either side for the various modes.\nSolawave made its name with its viral skincare wand, so it\u2019s no surprise the brand has now grown its roster to include larger red light therapy tools targeting eyes, face and d\u00e9colletage. Made from a soft, medical-grade silicone, the Wrinkle Retreat Light Therapy mask has 132 LEDs in a combination of red and near-infrared light.\nSubtle, Skin-Smoothing Effects With Regular Use\nOver the course of months that our tester used the device, she noticed subtle differences in her skin when she took a pause. \u201cI was surprised to notice that I felt a little less glowy, a little less smooth and maybe just more tired looking, so I started using it again,\u201d she says. \u201cI think this mask is probably best used in conjunction with additional anti-aging skincare and treatments to get a more pronounced effect, but it offers a bit of a pick-me-up with consistent use.\u201d\nLight Body With A Secure Fit\nOur tester found this mask lightweight and secure enough to use whether moving around and multitasking or lying down. Like the CurrentBody and Therabody devices, it comes with protective eye inserts, but our tester preferred leaving them off and keeping her eyes closed during sessions. You can get a solid two weeks\u2019 worth of treatments on a single charge.\nMost skin experts will remind you not to forget about your neck and chest in your skincare routine; this CurrentBody LED Neck and D\u00e9colletage mask is a great option for targeting crepey skin and any discoloration in these areas. Hartman is a fan of this device, saying \u201cIt targets neck skin, which is often forgotten and can show age sooner than facial skin. The research on it shows that it can help reduce crepey skin and also increase skin firmness.\u201d\nPreprogrammed Infrared Treatments That Take 10 Minutes\nThe device has one preprogrammed 10-minute treatment that uses the same red and near-infrared light therapy technology as the brand\u2019s face mask featured above to encourage collagen production and help even out skin tone. After using the mask over the course of several months, our tester noticed a subtle softening in the horizontal lines on her neck.\nSecure Setup That Allows You To Multitask\nDesigned specifically to cover the neck and chest area, this CurrentBody device feels comfortable and secure, even when moving around, says our tester. Setup is straightforward and simple; the Neck and D\u00e9colletage Perfector goes around the neck with a Velcro strap and wears like a very high-tech bib. Our tester liked having the ability to multitask while wearing this red light therapy mask, noting it\u2019s easy for her to read, brush her teeth and even do the dishes while wearing it.\nOther LED Face Masks We Tested\nAlong with our picks above, we tried two additional LED face masks that didn\u2019t make the cut. Here\u2019s why we didn\u2019t include the following products on our list:\n- Solaris Laboratories How To Glow 4 Color LED Light Therapy: This mask lacked standard features like preprogrammed treatment times and an automatic shut-off. Our tester found it a little uncomfortable due to the hard plastic on the nose piece that rests on skin, and the face shield design doesn\u2019t allow light to make close or direct contact with skin.\n- Nutriskin Wrinkle Clearing Light Therapy Face And Neck Mask: This face and neck duo is a little clunky due to multiple cords that need to be plugged into a charging port. Made from hard plastic, it was also one of the heavier and more uncomfortable face masks we tested.\nHow We Tested The Best LED Face Masks\nI started by evaluating popular, well-reviewed LED face masks from top skincare and beauty brands, leaving out any products that haven\u2019t been cleared or approved by the FDA. All of the picks on this list are designed to target signs of aging\u2014including fine lines and wrinkles, discoloration, and dullness in tone\u2014in addition to other concerns like acne and blemishes. Since most people don\u2019t start to notice these changes until they\u2019re past their late 20s, we ensured our hands-on testing data came from a panel of staffers and experts age 30 and up.\nOur testers evaluated each mask\u2019s particular features and design, as well as initial setup and overall ease of use. Each device was used at the maximum frequency and recommended duration to assess comfort and battery life. As with most at-home skincare devices, red light therapy masks require consistent usage over a matter of time to see visible results, so I had our panel test products for a minimum of four months (I\u2019ve now been regularly using the Therabody mask for over a year), with regular check-ins to note each mask\u2019s efficacy. This article will continue to be updated with results.\nWhy Trust Forbes Vetted\nAt Forbes Vetted, we\u2019ve researched and written dozens of skincare stories to help connect you with the best products to flesh out your daily routine.\n- The author of this piece, deputy editor Jane Sung, leads the beauty and grooming category and has two decades of experience covering beauty, wellness and style. She has previously reported on the best at-home laser hair removal devices and neck-firming creams.\n- Sung also gathered key insight and guidance from several industry professionals. These include board-certified dermatologist and Skin Wellness Dermatology founder Dr. Corey L. Hartman, board-certified plastic surgeon at Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery Dr. Gabriel Chiu, Dallas- and NYC-based aesthetician Joanna Czech who has been practicing for 39 years, and dermatologist Dr. Nava Greenfield of Schweiger Dermatology Group in NYC.\n- We regularly update this article to ensure that our recommendations continue to be relevant and that all product information is accurate. It was last updated by beauty writer Claire Epting in July 2025.\nWhat To Consider In An LED Face Mask\nWhen purchasing an LED face mask, there are a few factors you should keep in mind, including the overall design and variety of light modes. Here\u2019s what to consider as you shop.\nDesign\nThe design of an LED mask determines how heavy or lightweight it is, how comfortable it is to wear, and ultimately how likely you are to be consistent with using it. And most importantly, \u201ca comfortable and well-fitting mask ensures proper light delivery,\u201d says plastic surgeon Dr. Gabriel Chiu. Additionally, a wireless, rechargeable device allows for the convenience of not having to be near an outlet while using it; all of our picks on this list are wireless (whether with or without an attached controller).\nLight Modes\nWhile most LED face masks feature red light or a combination of red and infrared, many offer additional light modes to allow users to target multiple skin conditions in one session. Here\u2019s a brief breakdown on each type of light:\n- Red light: Aesthetician Joanna Czech says that red light therapy is most universally beneficial in enhancing overall skin health. \u201cThis wavelength stimulates collagen production and increases cellular energy,\u201d she says. For this category of light, board-certified dermatologist Dr. Corey L. Hartman recommends looking for a red light wavelength between 630nm and 680nm. \u201cThis range has shown to be the most beneficial in research to stimulate the cellular process within the skin to help boost the production of collagen and elastin, ease fine lines and wrinkles, and reduce inflammation,\u201d he says.\n- Near-infrared light: Many LED light therapy masks\u2019 red light modes are actually a combination of both red and near-infrared light. The biggest differentiator of near-infrared light is that its wavelength (measured in nanometers, or nm) falls beyond the visible spectrum, from 700nm to around 1400nm. Near-infrared light is able to penetrate skin tissue deeper than red light, so the two are often used together to boost effectiveness.\n- Blue light: Blue light is ideal for those dealing with acne or rosacea. According to Czech, \u201cBlue light possesses antibacterial properties that effectively combat the bacteria often associated with these conditions.\u201d Hartman says those seeking this type should look for a wavelength between 405nm and 420nm.\n- Yellow light: Although less common in at-home devices, yellow light is helpful for minimizing the effects of sun damage. \u201cYellow light works to even out skin tone from photoaging caused by external factors like sun exposure and environmental stressors,\u201d says Czech.\nFDA Clearance\nWhen considering face masks, some may use the terms \u201cFDA cleared\u201d and \u201cFDA approved\u201d interchangeably, but there is a difference. Products with FDA approval have gone through intensive testing to be deemed safe and effective for their intended use, while those with FDA clearance have been reviewed by the administration and determined to be substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device. All of the LED masks considered and ultimately featured in this story are FDA cleared\u2014something that all of our experts stressed as important for this category.\nIs LED Light Therapy The Same As Red Light Therapy?\nBecause most LED face masks feature red light modes at minimum, they are considered red light therapy devices that target the face. Some LED masks are versatile because they\u2019re equipped with other modes such as near infrared light (which penetrates deep into the skin for more pronounced anti-aging benefits), vibration massage to ease muscle tension and blue light therapy to calm acne and rosacea.\nNotably, different masks can offer various combination of modes, so it\u2019s important to read up on each model\u2019s features before choosing the best LED face mask for your needs. You\u2019ll probably pay more for an option with more treatments (or more advanced modes, like the combination red-and-blue therapy in the Dr. Dennis Gross DRx SpectraLite FaceWare Pro or the multitasking red and infrared mode on the Therabody TheraFace), but its worth the expense if it\u2019s comfortable, easy to use and also targets your biggest skincare concerns.\nTips For Using An LED Face Mask\nOur experts provided usage tips to help you get the most out of your at-home red light therapy treatments. Here\u2019s what you should know before getting started.\n- LED face masks should be used on clean, bare skin. We recommend starting off with a face wash and patting your skin dry before putting on your red light therapy mask. Any skincare products\u2014including your face moisturizer\u2014should be applied afterwards.\n- Treatment times can vary depending on the mask. Sessions range from three to 20 minutes and average about 10 minutes. Some are recommended to be used daily while others can be used a few times a week or every other day. Make sure to follow your device\u2019s instructions carefully, as using longer than the prescribed treatment time is typically ineffective.\n- Consistency is key. \u201cWhile there are significant studies showing the efficacy of LED therapy, you need to use it regularly for a sufficient amount of time (at least a couple months) to start seeing results,\u201d says Chiu. \u201cYou have to trust the process and be patient.\u201d To get the most benefit from the red light therapy, consistent use\u2014up to several times a week or daily, as directed by the brand\u2014is important, as is pairing with a tailored skincare routine.\n- Certain medications can have negative interactions with LED light therapy. According to our experts, those who take medication that increases skin or eye sensitivity should refrain from using LED light therapy devices. \u201cWhile overall gentle for normal skin, the heightened sensitivity can cause discomfort for some,\u201d says Hartman."

      "text": "Blush is the one makeup product in my routine that I absolutely cannot go without. It instantly makes me look awake and healthy, and it adds life back into my complexion\u2014especially during winter months. I usually opt for liquid blush because I prefer a dewy look, and I associate powder blush with the formulas of my youth that felt chalky and could look garish. So when Saie introduced a powder blush that promised a lightweight, diffused wash of color, I was curious to see if it would change my impression of powder options. After using Saie\u2019s SuperSuede Baked Powder Blush for several months, I found that it delivers long-lasting color with a soft, radiant and surprisingly natural finish.\nSaie is a popular beauty brand best known for its Glowy Super Gel\u2014a multitasking illuminator that can be worn on its own or mixed with your favorite base products\u2014and the Dew Blush Liquid Cream Blush. The common denominator with Saie is that its formulas look natural and they\u2019re easy to apply, so I was excited to put the SuperSuede blush and its powdery texture to the test.\nWhen first trying it out, I began by swatching the blush colors on my hand using clean fingers. I was surprised at the instant color payoff\u2014each was pigmented without looking harsh or overly bright. I then applied one of the lighter shades, Ciao, to my cheekbones using The Powder Blush Brush. I was surprised by how beautiful it looked on my skin: it blended easily, providing a just-right wash of color in a blurred, velvety finish. And it reflected the light without looking too shimmery for daytime wear.\nAfter consistently using the Saie powder blush over several months (I even wore it to a workout class, and it didn\u2019t budge), I can say this has earned a permanent spot in my makeup bag. Applying it is easy\u2014I swipe my blush brush onto the powder\u2019s surface two to three times to pick up enough color. I then tap off the excess before swiping it from the apples of my cheeks up toward my temples. I\u2019ll often combine shades for a custom flush, and I can easily build up the color for a night out.\nThe blush currently comes in six shades: Amore (a vibrant fuchsia), Stella (a bright coral), Mia (a soft rose shade and my current favorite), Bella (a cool pink), Grazie (a bright berry) and Ciao (a soft terracotta). While six shades may seem like a limited selection compared to other similar options on the market, there\u2019s still a nice range of bright and neutral hues. Mia and Ciao are the softest shades and the most wearable, in my opinion, and I typically reach for them on a day-to-day basis. I\u2019ve found that Ciao is excellent for the summer because it imparts a soft, golden glow that mimics being out in the sun. I hope that Saie expands this line to include even more shades in the future.\nAlthough I\u2019ve been a fan of liquid blush for the past couple of years, Saie\u2019s SuperSuede has made me a powder blush devotee due to its lightweight feel, velvety texture and the natural flush it creates. I love how easy it is to apply and build the color, and the shades Mia and Ciao work well with my current rotation of cream and liquid blushes, especially when I\u2019m looking to layer products for nighttime. I\u2019m also impressed with the staying power; it has lasted through long walks, subway rides, sweaty workouts and even a pool day where the temperature reached almost 80 degrees. Now that it\u2019s become a staple in my makeup routine, I plan to wear it all summer long."

      "text": "A good primer creates a smooth base, allowing for more seamless makeup application and all-day wear. The best primers for mature skin often include hydrating ingredients to soften the look of fine lines and plump the skin. After reviewing dozens of options from top beauty brands and getting firsthand recommendations from makeup artists, we selected the Armani Beauty Luminous Silk Hydrating Makeup Primer as the best makeup primer overall for mature skin, thanks to the hydrating ingredients and radiant finish. We also recommend the Maybelline Grippy Serum Primer for an affordable yet effective formula.\nTo narrow down the list of winners, we considered different skin types, ingredients, formulas and finishes. In particular, we prioritized versions with hydrating ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, glycerin and niacinamide. \u201cAs we age, we lose moisture in the skin,\u201d says professional makeup artist Alexa Rae Johnson. \u201cThe most important thing for mature skin is for it to feel supple and hydrated before applying makeup to keep products from drying out, caking up and settling into fine lines and wrinkles.\u201d Below, you\u2019ll find all the best primers for mature skin, ranging from a drugstore bestseller to a lightweight formula with SPF.\nThis top pick not only preps the skin for flawless makeup application, but the formula offers skincare benefits as well. Shea butter and glycerin hydrate the complexion, while rice bran helps condition and soften the skin. It has a radiant finish, and customers appreciate the lightweight consistency that doesn\u2019t feel greasy or sticky.\nIf you don\u2019t want to spend a fortune on a primer, we recommend the Maybelline Grippy Serum Primer, which costs less than $15 and does an excellent job of keeping makeup in place and plumping up the skin before application. This pick also comes highly recommended by celebrity makeup artist Cat Mignano: \u201cThis is a budget-friendly option that delivers hydration and impressive makeup grip with a luxurious feel.\u201d Pro tip: After applying this serum primer, press it into skin with clean fingertips and wait at least 20 seconds before layering other products on top.\nBest Luxury Primer For Mature Skin\nA Lightweight, Silky Primer That Blurs Imperfections\nFormulated with silk powder and silk extracts, this lightweight primer melts into skin and creates an invisible barrier between your skin and makeup, which can help prevent breakouts and clogged pores. \u201cLightweight yet effective, this primer blurs imperfections while nourishing with anti-aging botanicals,\u201d says Mignano.\nBest Primer With SPF For Mature Skin\nGreat For Sensitive Skin And Provides Added Sun Protection\nCiele Prime & Protect SPF 30\nKey ingredients: Zinc oxide, vitamin E, green tea leaf oil | Size: 1.6 ounces | Price per fluid ounce: $23.75\nThe Ciele Prime & Protect SPF 30+ Smoothing Primer includes hydrating vitamin E and green tea leaf oil, plus the added benefits of a mineral sunscreen to protect against the sun\u2019s harmful rays. (We still recommend using a separate sunscreen for proper coverage.) Reviewers mention that this evens out their skin tone nicely, and it doesn\u2019t contain any pore-clogging ingredients, so it works well for those with sensitive, acne-prone skin.\nIf you don\u2019t want to worry about your makeup\u2019s longevity (even on hot and humid summer days), this grippy primer is an excellent choice. The gel-like texture feels refreshing and cooling on the skin, and it keeps everything locked in place for up to 12 hours. It\u2019s also packed with hydrating ingredients like aloe water and hyaluronic acid to hydrate, soothe and provide a natural-looking glow.\nBest Hydrating Primer For Mature Skin\nA Makeup-Skincare Hybrid That Brightens And Hydrates\nFor those that could use an extra boost of hydration, this primer contains 93% skincare ingredients to hydrate, nourish, brighten and more. Hero ingredients include double hyaluronic acid (the two different molecule sizes provide both immediate and long-term hydration), cacao peptides, which are rich in antioxidants, and soothing moringa seed. The luminous finish looks beautiful under makeup, and it can be worn alone for a subtle glow.\nBest Pore Minimizing Primer For Mature Skin\nCreates A Smooth, Poreless Base For Makeup Application\nBenefit Porefessional Face Primer\nKey ingredients: Vitamin E derivative | Sizes: 0.25 ounces, 0.75 ounces, 1.5 ounces | Price per fluid ounce: $48\nIf you want to minimize the appearance of pores and other imperfections, this lightweight balm melts into skin and blurs imperfections while mattifying shine. \u201cIf someone\u2019s skin isn\u2019t too dry, and they have large pores, they may benefit from a primer like this one,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cI like to use a tiny dot only in the places where pores are visible. This formula almost fills in the pores, so when foundation is placed on top, it has a smoother appearance.\u201d\nTo narrow down our options for the best primers for mature skin, our beauty team tapped into our market knowledge and extensive testing experience, highlighting products and brands that offer hydrating, effective formulas.\nWe closely assessed the formulations and ingredients to evaluate those that work well with mature skin specifically.\nWe analyzed the key ingredients in our top picks to ensure they cater to various skin concerns.\nThe experts we spoke with made recommendations based on their professional experience, while customer reviews were examined for standout product traits. As everyone\u2019s budget looks slightly different, we included a wide range of prices.\nAll the products selected for this story were also reviewed and approved by Sung.\nWhat To Consider In The Best Primers For Mature Skin\n\u201cWhen choosing a primer for mature skin, the goal is to smooth texture, blur fine lines and boost hydration,\u201d says celebrity makeup artist Cat Mignano. As skin naturally loses moisture as we age, mature skin benefits from hydrating formulas, although it\u2019s a good idea to consider your skin type first. According to the three makeup artists we tapped, here\u2019s what else to consider before making a purchase.\nSkin Type\nAs with most skincare products, it\u2019s essential first to consider your skin type and any skin concerns you may have. While those with mature skin typically benefit from added hydration, those with oily or sensitive complexions might have slightly different needs. \u201cTypically for mature skin, there is a need for a thicker, more hydrating sort of advanced cream,\u201d says makeup artist Kelli Anne Sewell. \u201cHowever, regardless of skin type, it\u2019s important to support the skin barrier.\u201d\nIngredients\nOur experts agree that you should look for hydrating and soothing ingredients in a primer. \u201cLook for ingredients like hyaluronic acid for moisture, vitamin C for brightness, and peptides or niacinamide to help firm and support overall skin health,\u201d says Mignano. All of the options we highlight in this guide help plump the skin and boost hydration, but in particular, we recommend the Armani Beauty Luminous Silk Hydrating Makeup Primer (our best overall pick) and the Nars Light Reflecting Hydrating Primer (our choice for the best hydrating primer).\nFormula And Finish\nThe formula and finish largely depend on your personal preference, as some people prefer a more luminous, glowy finish while others prefer a natural finish. The Armani Beauty Luminous Silk Hydrating Makeup Primer has a radiant finish that gives your skin a lit-from-within glow, while the Benefit Porefessional Face Primer adds a more matte appearance.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nAfter extensive research and tapping experts, we\u2019ve determined that the best primer for mature skin is the Armani Beauty Luminous Silk Hydrating Makeup Primer. This popular primer is formulated with hydrating ingredients such as shea butter, glycerin and rice bran that also soften and smooth the complexion. Because it has a radiant, blurring finish, it also looks great on its own without any base makeup layered on top.\nAll of the experts we spoke with agree that a dewy primer is preferable over a matte one. \u201cIn most cases, a dewy or radiant primer is best for mature skin. Matte formulas can emphasize fine lines, dryness or uneven texture. A luminous finish helps reflect light, giving the skin a softer, more youthful appearance,\u201d says Mignano.\nEveryone\u2019s skin is different, and while primers can be a helpful product, skin prep is the most important step for a flawless base. \u201cWhether it\u2019s your favorite serum, milky essence, thick moisturizer, hydrating primer or all of the above, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d says Sewell. \u201cAs long as you are applying something to hydrate your skin and make it supple and ready for makeup.\u201d"

      "text": "With summer in full swing\u2014and pool, beach and lake days marked on the calendar\u2014you may be considering laser hair removal. This method damages hair follicles to reduce hair growth over time, providing more long-term results than shaving or waxing. We spent hours researching different models and gathering team feedback to determine the best laser hair removal devices for at-home use. As Forbes Vetted\u2019s beauty experts, our top pick is the Braun Silk Expert Pro 5, which is equipped with 10 intensity levels and four interchangeable caps for full-body treatment. In terms of value, it\u2019s hard to beat the Rose Skin Co. Lumi, a compact device for under $200.\nDevices designed for home use are typically IPL (intense pulsed light) tools\u2014many of which are featured in our roundup\u2014that work to achieve similar results as a diode laser would. Though comparable to in-office laser treatments, the energy level of gadgets for home use is much lower, according to dermatologist Dr. Ramya Garlapati. In addition to leaning on our beauty expertise (coauthor Jane Sung is the Forbes Vetted deputy beauty editor and Claire Epting is a beauty updates writer), we interviewed experts and sought out firsthand product experience to recommend the eight best laser hair removal devices that are safe and effective.\nFlashes: 400,000 | Laser type: IPL | Intensity levels: 10 | Skin tones: Light to medium | FDA-cleared: Yes\nPros:\nSuitable for sensitive skin\nCan be used on the face and body\nDesigned with SensoAdapt technology\nCons:\nNot safe for light hair color or dark skin\nBraun\u2019s Silk Expert Pro 5 has several features to help you get rid of unwanted hair more efficiently. It features a gliding mode for quickly treating large areas, like the legs, and a stamping mode for hard-to-reach areas, like the bikini line. It also has SensoAdapt technology, which automatically adjusts the flash intensity for safe use on skin. There are 10 intensity levels total, and it\u2019s possible to treat both legs in just five minutes at the lowest energy setting.\nAccording to the brand\u2019s website, results can be seen in as little as four weeks with regular use. The set includes four attachment caps that allow you to safely target different areas of your body, including your armpits and face. (We also picked the Braun Silk Expert Pro 5 as the best laser option in our roundup of the best facial hair removers.) Included with the device is a Venus razor for touchups.\nBest Value Laser Hair Removal Device\nCompact And Painless To Use\nRoseSkinCo. Lumi\nForbes Vetted readers get $20 off the Lumi (and Lumi bundles) by entering code FORBES20 at checkout.\nFlashes: 300,000 | Laser type: IPL | Intensity levels: 6 | Skin tones: Fair to dark brown | FDA-cleared: Yes\nPros:\nPainless\nGives fast results\nSuitable for the face\nCons:\nNo handle\nSmall size may mean longer treatments\nMost at-home laser hair removal devices come with larger price tags, but this one from RoseSkinCo. makes our list as the best value pick. Although it\u2019s more affordable, the device doesn\u2019t falter when it comes to results; you may start noticing positive benefits as soon as three weeks, so long as you use the device once per week. (Long-term hair removal can be expected after 12 uses, over the course of six to 12 weeks.) It offers six intensity levels and is suitable to use all over your body, including your armpits, legs, face and bikini area. Note that the device shouldn\u2019t be used above the cheekbones or on the inner part of the bikini area.\nBest Laser Hair Removal Device For Coarse Hair\nEffectively Zap Hair In 10-Minute Sessions\nNood The Flasher 2.0\nForbes Vetted readers get $10 off the Flasher 2.0(and all purchases at Nood) by entering code FORBES10 at checkout.\nFlashes: 600,000 | Laser type: IPL | Intensity levels: 3 | Skin tones: Very fair to light brown | FDA-cleared: Yes\nPros:\nTreatment can take as little as 10 minutes\nEasy to use\nEffective on patches of coarse hair\nCons:\nCan take up to eight weeks to see lasting results\nThis device offers a larger treatment window, meaning you only need about 10 minutes per session. Nood\u2019s technology also includes one of the highest-intensity lamps that targets hair at the root, without causing sensitivity and redness\u2014even on coarse hair. \u201cThe Flasher 2.0 has a thoughtful, compact design that fits nicely in the hand, and it\u2019s lightweight enough that lengthier IPL sessions don\u2019t feel like a chore,\u201d says one of our testers.\nThe device is so effective that you\u2019ll see results within as little as three weeks and will notice more permanent hair removal in six to eight weeks. You can switch between three modes, depending on your skin\u2019s sensitivity. It\u2019s best suited for very fair to light brown skin, but may not be as effective or safe for darker skin tones. For more info, read our in-depth Nood review here.\nBest Laser Hair Removal Device For Large Areas\nIPL Tool That Adapts To Your Curves\nSmoothSkin Pure Adapt\nFlashes: Unlimited | Laser type: IPL | Intensity levels: 10 | Skin tones: Light to medium | FDA-cleared: Yes\nPros:\nGreat for larger areas\nHas 10 settings\nIncludes a UV filter\nCons:\nOn the pricier side\nMay not be effective for finer hair\nThis recently upgraded device glides over large and small areas to provide lasting hair removal results. The Pure Adapt\u2019s head automatically adjusts to the contours of your body, preventing missed spots and unwanted burns. \u201cI\u2019ve been using this device for about three weeks, and it\u2019s the definition of user-friendly: You just plug it in, aim it at your target area and press a button,\u201d says one of our testers.\nThere are three comfort modes (Power, Speed and Gentle) that allow you to tailor the device to your targeted areas. \u201cIt\u2019s minimally painful, and comfortable to hold and wield,\u201d our tester says. \u201cWhile hair is re-growing, it does seem like it\u2019s coming in less coarse, which is a great sign.\u201d Another tester had a similar experience, noting, \u201cAfter two months, I\u2019ve definitely noticed a reduction in new hair growth.\u201d Its smart sensor calibrates the ideal IPL for your specific skin and hair type, and each treatment takes about 10 minutes. The device is safe to use on all areas of your body, as well as your face. According to the brand, you can expect to see visible results in just two weeks.\nBest Full-Body Laser Hair Removal Device\nCooling Device That Minimizes Discomfort\nUlike Sapphire Air3\nFlashes: Unlimited | Laser type: IPL | Intensity levels: 3 | Skin tones: Light to medium | FDA-cleared: Yes\nPros:\nHas a cooling feature\nUnlimited flashes\nThumb-free auto glide mode\nCons:\nOnly three intensity levels\nThe Ulike Sapphire Air 3 is so easy to use, you may feel emboldened to use it on your entire body. Its sapphire ice-cooling technology makes the process as painless as possible, while the thumb-free auto glide mode allows you to cover large areas of your body in one fell swoop. The device delivers flashes every 0.7 seconds, and a full-body treatment can take as little as 12 minutes. You can expect to see results in about three weeks, with treatment frequency starting at three times a week and gradually reducing to every month.\nBest Cooling Laser Hair Removal Device\nErgonomic With Useful Features\nJovs Venus Pro II\nFlashes: 500,000 | Laser type: OPT | Intensity levels: 6 | Skin tones: Fair to tan | FDA-cleared: Yes\nPros:\nHas a cooling feature\nIncludes six treatment heads\nHelps treat signs of aging\nCons:\nNot safe for light hair or dark skin\nThe Jovs Venus Pro has several elements that make it worth the investment. It has a 180-degree rotating head (for better precision), a skin-cooling feature (for added comfort) and useful attachments, like an LED option that also helps reduce visible signs of aging. Unlike the other options on this list, this model uses optimum pulsed light (OPT) technology, which is a more enhanced version of IPL that may provide more effective results. It has six function modes and intensity levels for customized treatment on your legs, underarms, face and bikini lines. A full-body treatment can be completed in around seven minutes, and visible results can be noticed in as soon as four weeks.\nBest Laser Hair Removal Device For Dark Skin Tones\nWorks On Any Complexion\nIluminage Touch\nFlashes: Unlimited | Laser type: IPL with RF | Intensity levels: 3 | Skin tones: All |FDA-cleared: Yes\nPros:\nHas three energy levels\nSafe for all skin tones\nWorks on various hair colors and skin tones\nCons:\nCharging station takes up a lot of counter space\nThe Iluminage Touch is a laser for the face and body that uses intense pulsed light (IPL) and radio frequency (RF) to gently zap away unwanted hair. It\u2019s this combination that makes this pick safe for darker shades of skin\u2014in fact, it\u2019s the first at-home laser that\u2019s cleared by the FDA to use on all skin tones. The device features three energy levels that can be used on a wide range of hair colors, including blonde, dark blonde and red hair. It comes with a precision adaptor and an epilator attachment to optimize treatments. The Iluminage Touch also provides results fast\u2014users can expect to see a noticeable decrease in hair growth after just two treatments, and full results in seven weeks.\nBest Laser Hair Removal Device For Travel\nUltra-Light Device That Packs Easily\nSilk\u2019n Infinity Fast\nFlashes: 600,000 | Laser type: eHPL (galvanic and optical energy) | Intensity levels: 5 | Skin tones: Light to light brown | FDA-cleared: Yes\nPros:\nGood for large and small areas\nHas five energy levels\nNoticeable results after three or four treatments\nCons:\nNot suitable for light hair\nThis upgraded Silk\u2019n device targets follicles on a wider range of skin tones than its previous iteration. Its enhanced Home Pulsed Light technology (which is a safer, home-friendly version of IPL) now uses galvanic energy to helps its light reach hair follicles more deeply\u2014and twice as fast than the previous model. Since the laser uses energy from a bulb instead of thermal heat, it\u2019s designed to fit comfortably in the palm of your hand, making it our top pick for travel. You can expect to see noticeable results after three to four treatments, and full results after eight. It\u2019s also safe for use on your underarms, legs, bikini lines and face, and has five intensity settings to customize your treatment.\nThe Forbes Vetted team has researched, written and published dozens of beauty and grooming stories, relying on our personal expertise, as well as thorough insight from qualified professionals.\nEvery iteration of this story has been reviewed by deputy editor Jane Sung, who has over two decades of beauty industry and product testing experience. Sung has overseen the publication of multiple Forbes Vetted roundups of hair removal products, including the best electric razors for women and the best body hair trimmers.\nFor this article, we consulted with board-certified dermatologist Dr. Ramya Garlapati and Dr. Ava Shamban, a cosmetic dermatologist who works out of her LA-based practice, Ava MD. Both shared their deep knowledge on what to look for in the safest and most effective laser tools for hair removal.\nWe regularly review this article to ensure the accuracy of prices, product details and list placements. It was last updated in July 2025 by Epting, who refreshed our section of frequently asked questions.\nHow We Chose The Best Laser Hair Removal Devices\nWhen compiling this list of the best laser hair removal devices, we considered the top options on the market at different price points and capabilities.\nWe combed through customer reviews and examined the most efficient tools. We researched each one to learn about its features, attachments, modes and number of flashes.\nWe verified that all eight models on our list are cleared by the FDA as safe tools for at-home hair reduction.\nTo ensure we provided the most accurate information, our team considered Shamban and Garlapati\u2019s expert advice while researching recommendations.\nIf you\u2019re looking for an at-home laser hair removal device that provides results on par with a professional treatment, there are several factors to consider. Here\u2019s what to consider.\nLaser Type\nMost at-home laser hair removal devices use intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy to remove unwanted body hair by permanently destroying the follicles in the treated area. However, some devices, such as the Jovs Venus Pro II, use optimal pulse technology (OPT), which is an enhanced version of IPL that can penetrate the skin more deeply and therefore may be more effective. A select few devices (including the Iluminage Touch) combine IPL with radio frequency (RF) heat energy, which reduces IPL intensity so it can be used across a wider range of skin tones.\nFlashes\nYou can think of the number of flashes (also known as pulses) as the lifespan of the laser. It determines how long you can use the tool before it wears out. In many cases, you can achieve the results you want with one device. According to cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Ava Shamban, areas such as the lip and face generally need about 25 to 50 flashes; the underarm or bikini line might need up to 200 flashes; larger areas like the legs may need 500 to 600 flashes each; the chest or back may require 700 or even 800 flashes.\nSkin Type And Tone\nLaser hair removal devices aren\u2019t one size fits all. \u201cSome may not be advisable for darker skin tones, which have a higher chance for issues such as burning or hyperpigmentation,\u201d says Shamban. \u201cUsually, lighter skin with darker hair is the best combination, but some can be used on all skin tones and types.\u201d (See the Iluminage Touch, our pick for dark skin tones.) Most devices have multiple intensity levels as well; a higher intensity level will deliver faster results, but it may aggravate sensitive skin. Opting for a device with a skin-cooling feature can remedy some of the pain and irritation caused by more powerful treatments.\nTreatment Area\nIt\u2019s a good idea to keep your desired treatment area in mind when selecting an at-home laser hair removal device, especially if you want to cover larger parts on the body. An automatic flashing feature (like the one found on the Ulike Sapphire Air 3) allows you to cover more surface area without having to hold down a button. Some devices, like the Braun Silk Expert Pro 5, include different detachable laser heads that allow you to target specific places that are hard to reach, like the bikini line.\nIs It Safe To Use Home Laser Hair Removal Devices?\nIt\u2019s generally considered safe to use a laser hair removal device at home, as long as it\u2019s from a reputable brand and you follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Further, \u201cAny device purchased for home usage should be FDA-approved or cleared,\u201d says Shamban. This information should be indicated or marked on the device\u2019s packaging or instructional pamphlet. (Note that all the devices on this list are FDA-cleared.)\nIt\u2019s also important to pay attention to the list of usages, as some devices are only safe to use on certain areas, as well as on certain hair or skin types. In addition, Garlapati says that \u201cthere is a risk of burning your skin and causing hyperpigmentation if you do too many passes.\u201d That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to diligently follow the directions depending on the area that you want to treat.\nTips For At-Home Laser Hair Removal\nFor those who are just starting laser hair removal at home, we\u2019ve gathered a few tips to make the process easier. Here\u2019s what to keep in mind, according to Shamban.\nStart with clean, hydrated skin. \u201cWhether you\u2019re doing laser hair removal at home or in the [dermatologist\u2019s] office, the first thing is to make sure that the area is clean and moisturized,\u201d says Shamban. Ideally, you should shave skin two days before treatment. \u201cIf the hair is too long, it will absorb too much energy from the laser and will burn the surrounding skin.\u201d\nMoisturize your skin following each treatment. \u201cMore than prep, it\u2019s important to take care of the skin afterward with a very mild hydrocortisone cream, such as is available over the counter, and perhaps some aloe and ice,\u201d says Shamban.\nKeep an eye out for irritation and ingrown hairs. As you continue to shave the new hair that grows in, watch for any signs of irritation and blocked hair follicles. Shamban notes that you can treat these skin conditions with a salicylic acid wash followed by a lightweight moisturizer.\nDon\u2019t expect to see results right away. Since at-home devices aren\u2019t as strong as the equipment found in a professional setting, you have to have a bit of patience when using them. Even with consistent treatments, Shamban says that it takes anywhere from four to eight weeks to begin seeing a difference in hair growth.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nYes, in many cases using an at-home laser hair removal device provides effective results, but only with consistent treatments over the course of several weeks to months. In-office treatments provide quicker results, since dermatologists use more powerful lasers than the ones available for home use.\nAfter comparing all of the options, we landed on the Braun Silk Expert Pro 5 as the best at-home laser hair removal device overall. It\u2019s equipped with a variety of settings and attachments, making it suitable for use on the whole body. Thanks to its SensoAdapt technology, it automatically adjusts the intensity of the laser to suit your skin.\nThe downsides of IPL hair removal include potential skin sensitivity and a risk of hyperpigmentation with darker skin tones. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to closely follow your device\u2019s specific instructions and make sure the model you pick is suitable for your skin type and tone."

      "text": "As someone who has worn glasses since I was three years old, I know the struggle of getting a new pair of specs all too well. From the lengthy process to the jaw-dropping (and not in a good way) price tag, it\u2019s all too much. But thanks to modern technology and some ingenious entrepreneurs, you can easily shop for prescription eyeglasses from the comfort of your home. I compared nearly a dozen eyewear retailers and enlisted a panel of testers to determine the best place to buy prescription glasses online. Our top pick is GlassesUSA because of its staggering array of options at prices to suit every budget. If affordability is a top priority, we recommend Zenni Optical, which has frames at prices as low as $7.\nHere are the five best prescription glasses retailers\u2014including one company worthy of being mentioned twice\u2014that you can shop online:\nBest Prescription Glasses Online Overall: GlassesUSA\nOur four panel testers evaluated each retailer, shopping for and ordering numerous frames. Then, they shared their in-depth feedback on the entire buying process. After comparing each retailer\u2019s variety, return policy and site features, I compiled our final list of winning retailers that offer everything from designer frames to kids\u2019 eyeglasses. Below, find detailed information about each winning e-tailer, along with an expert-informed buying guide to help you find the perfect pair.\nBest Prescription Glasses Online Overall\nUnbeatable Selection And Easy Ordering Process\nGlassesUSA Muse Zenith Eyeglasses\nPrice range: $33 to $675 | Turnaround time: 10 to 16 business days (expedited shipping options available) | Return policy: 14 days, no questions asked | Insurance accepted: Yes, as well as HSA/FSA | Virtual try-on: Yes | Virtual Rx renewal: Contact lenses only\nWhat you\u2019ll love:\nWide variety of name and house brands, plus blue light glasses and sunglasses\nEasy-to-use app for scanning prescriptions\nSpeedy delivery time\nKeep in mind:\nOnly your first pair of glasses is eligible for the 14-day return policy\nGlassesUSA is one of the largest and best online prescription glasses retailers, offering hundreds of designer frames from Ray-Ban, Gucci and Oakley, along with less expensive house brands in every frame style and color you can imagine. It was the winner among three of our panel testers, who were impressed by the ease of the ordering process. Prices run the gamut from $39 up to $700, depending on which brand you choose. With its virtual try-on feature, you can upload a photo directly to the website and see what each frame looks like on your face before you commit. If you don\u2019t have your prescription handy, the GlassesUSA app can scan your prescription through your current lenses. (The company has an online prescription renewal option, but this is only for contact lenses.)\nAll lenses are made to order in-house and then put through a series of inspections to check for quality, clarity and proper alignment. You also have the option for upgrades like progressive lenses, anti-reflective coatings and transition lenses for up to $169 more. One of our testers describes the selection and checkout flow as \u201csleek and intuitive,\u201d and was pleased with the speedy delivery time. Another notes that her glasses arrived nine days after her order, which was pretty impressive given that the window included Thanksgiving weekend. If you\u2019re unhappy with your new glasses for any reason, GlassesUSA has a 14-day, no questions asked return policy\u2014but you can only take advantage of this for your first pair.\nPrice range: $7 to $60 | Turnaround time: 8 to 18 business days (expedited shipping options available) | Return policy: 14 days for refund (excluding shipping costs) or 30 days for store credit | Insurance accepted: No, but HSA/FSA accepted | Virtual try-on: Yes | Virtual Rx renewal: No\nWhat you\u2019ll love:\nWide selection of glasses at impressively low prices\nSite filters make it easy to find specific frames\nAdvanced virtual try-on feature\nKeep in mind:\nStandard U.S. shipping costs $6.95 no matter how much you spend\nShipping fee is not refundable with returns\nZenni is all about making prescription glasses affordable, with house-designed frames starting at just $7 and capping at $60\u2014and that price includes standard prescription lenses. \u201cWith my complex prescription, the cost adds up fast so a lower-priced frame is a nice bonus,\u201d says one tester. While the retailer now sells designer brands as well, you\u2019ll get the most bang for your buck by sticking with Zenni\u2019s line; plus, the namebrand selection is limited.\nAnother panel tester is a fan of the site\u2019s try-on feature, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s very advanced to give you a well-rounded view of what your glasses will look like. It was a seamless experience from beginning to end.\u201d In addition, you can filter frames by pupillary distance, making it easier to find what you\u2019re looking for. Zenni also offers low-bridge options and ANSI Z87.1 safety glasses with prescription single vision and progressive lenses. You can add upgrades, like polarization, that start at $33.\nPrice range: $95 to $195 | Turnaround time: 7 to 12 business days | Return policy: 30 days for a return or exchange | Insurance accepted: Yes, as well as HSA/FSA | Virtual try-on: Yes, as well as in-home try-on | Virtual Rx renewal: Yes, for single-vision distance prescriptions in eligible states\nWhat you\u2019ll love:\nWide range of prescription and non-prescription eyeglasses, blue light glasses and sunglasses\nGood selection of contact lenses including in-house and third-party brands like Acuvue, Bausch + Lomb and Biofinity\nKeep in mind:\nKids\u2019 glasses are only available in store or over the phone\nWarby Parker offers designer-style glasses at affordable prices. One of our testers has been ordering her prescription eyeglasses and sunglasses from the site for over a decade. All frames start at just $95, an impressive price that includes basic prescription lenses. You can try on virtually, but one of the brand\u2019s biggest claims to fame is its at-home try-on program. Pick up to five frames to receive, for free, to physically try on before you buy. \u201cThe size accuracy, feel and fit are always excellent in my experience,\u201d says our panel tester. \u201cThe frames I wear regularly are blue light-blocking, which seem to do their job (as far as I can tell) to help prevent eye fatigue.\u201d\nOnce you have your frames picked out, you can add basic prescription lenses, which another tester describes as \u201cperfectly accurate\u201d and \u201cnot too thick,\u201d despite his strong prescription. You can also choose from various upgrade options, like progressive lenses, blue light filtering or light-responsive lenses, which add up to $200 to the total price. If you don\u2019t like your new glasses, you can return them for a full refund or exchange within 30 days of receipt. And if your lenses get scratched in the first 365 days, you can get new lenses made for free.\nBest Designer Prescription Glasses\nDesigner Brands At A Discount\nFrames Direct Ray-Ban RB7047 Eyeglasses\nPrice range: $40 to $1,080 | Turnaround time: 11 to 14 business days | Return policy: 30 days for a return or exchange | Insurance accepted: Yes, as well as FSA/HSA | Virtual try-on: Yes | Virtual Rx renewal: No\nWhat you\u2019ll love:\nImpressive collection of high-end designer styles, including pairs from Gucci and Versace\nMany designer options are offered for less than retail prices\nEach order is reviewed by an optician based on your prescription\nKeep in mind:\nYou have to pay shipping for refunded returns\nThere are limited product photos on the website\nFrames Direct claims to have the largest selection of designer eyewear online: There are almost 5,000 frames from high-end brands like Gucci and Versace, as well as Oakley and Ray-Ban (in a wide variety of colors, too). Our tester mentions that her Armani Exchange glasses arrived with a \u201ccertificate of authenticity\u201d that guarantees the glasses are genuine. Most brands sell for 20% to 80% off the retail price, and you can often score prescription lenses at a discount. \u201cThe value of these name-brand eyeglasses, with all the additional add-ons to my lenses, is very impressive,\u201d our tester says. Another tester, who wears progressives, adds, \u201cThe lenses themselves match my prescription and have one of the best fields of vision of any of the glasses that I tried.\u201d The Frames Direct site also has a virtual-try on feature, to let you see what each pair would look like on your face before committing to a purchase.\nAs far as lenses go, choose single vision, no-line progressives or non-prescription readers. You can also select different lens materials, from thin polycarbonate to lower-cost plastic, as well as optional upgrades like digital light protection or scratch-resistant coating. And before your order goes through, an optician will review everything to make sure you picked the best selections for your prescription.\nBest Prescription Sunglasses\nMix Of Wallet-Friendly Brands And House Designs\nEyebuydirect Good Vibrations Sunglasses\nPrice range: $6 to $479 | Turnaround time: 7 to 14 business days | Return policy: 14 days for a one-time replacement or refund | Insurance accepted: No, but HSA/FSA accepted | Virtual try-on: Yes | Virtual Rx renewal: No\nWhat you\u2019ll love:\nWide variety of prescription sunglasses to suit any budget\n365-Day Product Guarantee covers defects for one year\nKeep in mind:\nYou can only receive a refund or replacement once\nNo online prescription renewal\nYou can outfit Eyebuydirect\u2019s wide selection of frames with tinted prescription lenses, so you have thousands of options to choose from. If you\u2019re not sure where to start, the company also has its own line of prescription sunglasses, and everything from concept to design to manufacturing is done in house to keep prices down. Since one of our testers only wears large, rectangular frames, he mentions that the ability to filter on these preferences was super helpful during testing. Shades with prescription lenses start at $39 and cap at under $100, which is reasonable for the high quality you\u2019re getting.\nWhen you find a frame you like, you can click \u201ctry on\u201d to upload a photo and see what it looks like on your face. The photo stays uploaded as you navigate the site, so you can quickly see what other options look like. Our testers note that their eyeglasses arrived promptly and safely in a compact cardboard box. If your glasses don\u2019t work out, Eyebuydirect offers a 14-day \u201cno questions asked\u201d return policy for a one-time replacement or refund, but its 365-Day Product Guarantee covers defects for a full year.\nBest Prescription Glasses For Kids\nChild-Friendly Styles They'll Want To Wear\nZenni Kids' Rectangle Glasses\nPrice range: $7 to $60 | Turnaround time: 8 to 18 business days (expedited shipping options available) | Return policy: 14 days for refund (excluding shipping costs) or 30 days for store credit | Insurance accepted: No, but HSA/FSA accepted | Virtual try-on: Yes | Virtual Rx renewal: No\nWhat you\u2019ll love:\nChildren\u2019s frames cost as low as $6.95\nKid-friendly features including flexible frames and straps\nOptions are separated into different categories based on age\nKeep in mind:\nStandard U.S. shipping costs $6.95 no matter how much you spend\nShipping fee is not refundable with returns\nKids and tweens are picky\u2014really picky. Zenni offers a wide selection of children\u2019s frames at wallet-friendly prices, which is why it topped our list of the best kids\u2019 glasses. Frames start as low as $6.95 for basic prescription lenses, with a majority of frames costing between $16 to $30. This is great news for parents: If your child happens to misplace or damage their frames, a replacement isn\u2019t super costly.\nThere are flexible frames for toddlers, options with kid-friendly straps and cool-looking styles to win tweens over. Using the website\u2019s virtual try-on feature, your kiddo can see what the glasses will look like on their face, so you can make sure they\u2019re happy before purchasing. Like its adult offerings, you can customize Zenni\u2019s glasses for kids with add-ons like specialty coatings, extra accessories or engraving.\nMany retailers run promotions throughout the year, allowing you to save even more on your next pair of eyeglasses. Here are the best current deals on prescription glasses online:\nGlassesUSA: Save 30% on frames with basic Rx lenses using code SAVE30,and take 40% off select designer frames with code DESIGNER40.\nFramesDirect: Take up to 40% off select frames from this top-rated site that carries brands like Oakley, Ray-Ban and Versace.\nWarby Parker: When you buy two or more pairs of glasses, you get 15% off\u2014no code needed.\nEyebuydirect: Take $30 off all orders $100 or more with code MS30. Plus, you can save 25% on orders $110 or more with code WC25.\nWe recruited four glasses-wearing panel testers to thoroughly browse, order from and test prescription glasses from each site: Former branded content editor Dana Holmes, who wears progressive lenses; managing editor Emmy Favilla, a nearsighted, daily glasses-wearer; former associate insights architect Shan Newton, who requires a strong prescription; and freelance writer Becky Eaton, who spends most of her workday at a computer screen.\nLindsay Boyers, the author of this piece, is the executive strategy editor at Forbes Vetted. She has 15 years\u2019 experience testing, reviewing and obsessing over specs for all types of products, and has used her knowledge to compile the findings of our four glasses testers.\nClaire Epting, the co-author of this piece, is the fashion updates writer at Forbes Vetted. She has conducted hours of research on purchasing prescription eyewear online, as she is heavily involved in updating all of our eyewear stories.\nKari Molvar, former deputy editor at Forbes Vetted, oversaw the publishing of this article. Molvar has over two decades of experience covering style and apparel, and she herself has worn glasses for more than 30 years.\nEpting spoke with Jennifer Ferri, O.D., owner of Homer Rich Eye Care, to gather her insights on shopping for prescription glasses online.\nWe routinely update this story for accuracy and to re-evaluate product availability and popularity. It was last refreshed by Epting in August 2025.\nHow We Chose The Best Prescription Glasses Online\nWe spent hours researching over a dozen popular eyewear companies and what they offer in terms of selection, value, insurance eligibility, return policy and turnaround time. In addition:\nOur four panel testers went through the online process, paying attention to the user-friendliness of the glasses buying process and highlighted special features like virtual or at-home try-ons and prescription renewals. Once they received their products, they wore each pair for hours to see how they felt and performed.\nWe assessed the feedback of our four glasses-wearing testers, ultimately picking the five best online retailers that are worth your while and organized them based on their strong suits, like affordability or designer options.\nWe indicated the estimated turnaround times, return policies, availability of virtual try-on features and vision renewal tests, and whether insurance and HSA/FSA funds are accepted to help you pinpoint the best prescription glasses retailer for your needs.\nIs It Safe To Buy Prescription Glasses Online?\nAccording to Ferri, most optometrists generally don\u2019t recommend buying prescription glasses online. \u201cThis is primarily due to potential input errors, quality assurance issues and difficulty verifying that materials used are what they claim to be,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is no substitute for the precision, accuracy and service that comes with getting glasses from a licensed eye care professional.\u201d\nThat being said, \u201cbuying prescription glasses online is generally not dangerous\u2014you\u2019re not going to go blind from ordering them\u2014but it is what we would call an \u2018at-your-own-risk\u2019 purchase,\u201d adds Ferri. So if you choose to go the online route, she advises to shop from \u201creputable retailers with solid return policies and customer service.\u201d This is advice that Forbes Vetted editors, including those who\u2019ve purchased prescription specs online, wholeheartedly agree with.\nTips For Buying Prescription Glasses Online\nShopping for prescription glasses online is a pretty straightforward process, but there are a few things you should keep in mind. While Ferri recommends buying prescription eyeglasses through an optometrist rather than purchasing them online, she has a few tips for those who are set on shopping from home.\nMake sure your prescription is current. If your prescription has expired, you\u2019ll need to renew it before moving forward. \u201cUpload a copy of your prescription directly from your eye doctor when possible,\u201d says Ferri. If you\u2019re unable to make an in-office appointment for a renewal, some sites including Warby Parker allow you to renew your prescription online using a virtual vision test for an added fee.\nHave your pupillary distance on hand. Your pupillary distance, which is the measurement of distance between your pupils, \u201chelps providers correctly align the light-bending properties of prescription lenses with the pupils of your eyes,\u201d according to the Cleveland Clinic. Your eye doctor can most accurately measure your pupillary distance, but you can also use online tools at home, like Zenni\u2019s digital PD ruler or Warby Parker\u2019s PD measuring tool.\nThose with stronger prescriptions should opt for thinner, high-index lenses. \u201cThe stronger your prescription, the more critical it becomes to select high-index lenses to avoid heavy, thick lenses that can cause discomfort,\u201d says Ferri. \u201cPolycarbonate is a good all-purpose option\u2014lightweight, impact-resistant and ideal for both children and active adults.\u201d\nAdd an anti-reflective lens coating to your prescription glasses. For an additional fee, you can upgrade your glasses with anti-reflective, anti-scratch, anti-fog and blue light-blocking coatings. \u201cAlways opt for a high-quality anti-reflective coating, which reduces glare, improves cosmetic appearance and enhances visual comfort,\u201d says Ferri. If you spend a significant amount of time in front of a screen, she recommends an additional blue light-filtering coating to help reduce eye strain.\nCheck the retailer\u2019s warranty and return policy before checking out. Ferri emphasizes that it\u2019s important to make sure the company offers a generous return policy and warranty \u201cin case the fit or lens quality isn\u2019t what you expected.\u201d\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nYes, it\u2019s generally worth it to buy prescription glasses online, in terms of both cost and convenience. Glasses are typically less expensive online than in a store or optometrist\u2019s office, and with virtual try-ons and prescription renewal, you can place an order right from home.\nIf you\u2019re shopping online, GlassesUSA is the best company for eyeglasses, thanks to its huge selection, virtual try-on feature and speedy delivery times. However, all of the retailers on this list are thoroughly vetted and have stellar reputations.\nWhether or not your prescription glasses can be covered by insurance depends on your specific insurance plan, as well as the retailer\u2019s individual policy. GlassesUSA, Warby Parker and Frames Direct are the three retailers on this list that accept insurance. That being said, all of the companies featured accept HSA/FSA funds as an acceptable form of payment."

      "text": "A good vitamin C serum can supercharge your skincare routine thanks to its tightening, smoothing and brightening benefits. Based on thorough research, long-term testing by Forbes Vetted editors, recommendations from a dermatologist, and approval from deputy beauty editor Jane Sung, we landed on the best vitamin C serums for every skin type and budget. The overall winner is the SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic\u2014a staff and industry favorite\u2014for its impressive brightening power. For first-time users, we chose the TruSkin Vitamin C Serum for its high-performing yet simple formula.\n\u201cVitamin C serums can be highly effective because they have a high concentration of active ingredients, and their smaller molecules allow them to penetrate the skin deeply and efficiently,\u201d says Dr. Dendy Engelman, board-certified dermatologist and Mohs surgeon at Shafer Clinic in New York City. In order to get the best results from your serum, it\u2019s ideal to pick a formula that caters to your skin type, whether you have dry, oily, combination or sensitive skin. Below, see our picks for the best vitamin C serums that leave skin glowy and bright.\nActive ingredients: 15% L-ascorbic acid, 1% alpha-tocopherol, ferulic acid | Additional benefits: Improves appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, reduces free radical damage | Consistency: Serum | Cruelty-free: No\nWhat you\u2019ll love:\nEasily absorbs into skin\nLayers well with makeup\nEvens out skin tone\nKeep in mind:\nSome find the smell unpleasant\nSome say it has a sticky feel\nA tried-and-true favorite in the industry\u2014recommended by Engelman and our editors\u2014this serum accomplishes a lot. It evens out pigmentation and fights against environmental aging using high concentrations of vitamin C (15% pure L-ascorbic acid), vitamin E (1% alpha tocopherol) and ferulic acid. The result is fewer dark spots, less inflammation and a more youthful appearance overall. I\u2019ve been using this serum for many years\u2014I like how well it absorbs, and I notice a stark difference in the brightness of my skin if I stop applying it for a few days. \u201cIt\u2019s great for brightening and evening out my skin tone, and really just making it look healthier overall,\" says deputy editor Jane Sung. \"It also layers well with skincare and makeup.\u201d\nBest Vitamin C Serum For Beginners\nAn Affordable Serum That Brightens Sans Irritation\nA fully vegan formula, TruSkin Vitamin C brightens, reduces hyperpigmentation and revives tired-looking skin with its blend of vitamin C, vitamin E, hyaluronic acid and anti-inflammatory MSM (methylsulfonylmethane). \u201cAs someone who had never used a vitamin C serum previous to this one, I can say that this is a great option for beginners,\u201d says beauty updates writer Claire Epting. \u201cI use it beneath my eyes and on acne spots, and I\u2019ve definitely noticed a positive change in those areas since using it. I love that it doesn\u2019t cause any stinging or irritation on my sensitive skin.\u201d Added bonus: It works well under makeup.\nSome skin types may see better results with L-ascorbic acid\nThis serum contains sodium ascorbyl phosphate, a form of vitamin C that\u2019s more stable than L-ascorbic acid\u2014and less likely to oxidize over time. (According to the brand, the potency is comparable to a 15% or 20% L-ascorbic acid formula.) Plant-based ingredients, including chamomile and konjac root, work to soothe irritated skin, while hyaluronic acid boosts moisture levels and gives you that coveted glow. The bottle\u2019s affordable price also earned it the top spot on our list of the best drugstore vitamin C serums.\nBest Value Vitamin C Serum\nAffordable Pick Packed With Hydrating Ingredients\nNaturium Vitamin C Complex Serum\nActive ingredients: Vitamin C, sodium ascorbyl phosphate, hyaluronic acid, vitamin E, bioactive fruit blend | Additional benefits: Improves dullness, evens tone | Consistency: Serum | Cruelty-free: Yes\nWhat you\u2019ll love:\nIntensely hydrating\nDecreases the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles\nNon-sticky\nKeep in mind:\nIf you have sensitive skin you may need to use it less often\nThis formula features brightening vitamin C (l-ascorbic acid) combined with potent fruit extracts\u2014including Kakadu plum, pineapple, papaya and mango\u2014and hyaluronic acid that act as humectants to deliver moisture to parched skin. The multitasking serum nourishes, improves dullness, decreases the appearance of fine lines, leaves skin feeling firmer and smoother and gives a healthy glow. At the same time, the antioxidant-rich formula protects skin from damage caused by free radicals and UV radiation. Naturium\u2019s serum also doesn\u2019t have some of the negative properties that some other vitamin C formulas do: According to reviewers, it has no orange cast, it doesn\u2019t have a smell and it\u2019s not sticky.\nBest Vitamin C Serum For Sensitive Skin\nA Budget-Friendly Gel That Evens Out Skin Tone\nL'Or\u00e9al Revitalift Vitamin C\nActive ingredients: 10% vitamin C, hyaluronic acid | Additional benefits: Hydrating, wrinkle-reducing | Consistency: Gel | Cruelty-free: No\nWhat you\u2019ll love:\nPrimer-like finish\nSafe for sensitive skin\nWallet-friendly price tag\nKeep in mind:\nLower concentration of vitamin C\nMay not be ideal for those with dry skin due to its powdery finish\nFeaturing 10% pure vitamin C combined with hyaluronic acid, this fragrance-free formula works to reduce fine lines and wrinkles, even out skin tone and make those pesky dark spots less prominent. Unlike most of the serums on our list, this one has a somewhat powdery feel, similar to that of a primer, but I like that finish for layering underneath makeup. I also find that my pores seem less noticeable with regular use. Compared to some competitor formulas, this one has a lower concentration of vitamin C, making it a great option for beginners or those with sensitive skin.\nBest Vitamin C Serum For Mature Skin\nA Powerful Formula That Works Throughout The Day\nMOST POPULAR\nSkinMedica Vitamin C+E Complex\nActive ingredients: Vitamin C, vitamin E | Additional benefits: Protects against free radical damage, improves fine lines | Consistency: Cream | Cruelty-free: No\nWhat you\u2019ll love:\nTime-release formula that lasts throughout the day\nSmooth, rich feel\nPlumps and firms skin\nKeep in mind:\nMay be too heavy for oilier skin types\nThis vitamin C and E formula is designed to gradually release throughout the day to help fight free radicals and protect against environmental stressors. Engelman recommends it as one of the best vitamin C serums on the market for its highly effective formula. It also supports the production of collagen, meaning you\u2019ll notice a plumper, firmer appearance and fewer fine lines and wrinkles with continued use. The cream serum is smooth and easy to apply with one pre-measured pump. It absorbs fast and layers well underneath moisturizer, too.\nMay not provide as pronounced results, due to lower concentration of vitamin C\nThis gentle face serum is a unique and highly effective blend of three forms of vitamin C that work together to visibly improve skin tone and eliminate pigmentation. Aloe vera and hyaluronic acid add a welcome kick of intense moisture, while an unexpected addition of zinc works to transport vitamin C effectively into the skin. I find this serum helps to reduce any signs of uneven pigmentation and redness, and it gives my skin a lovely glow with regular use. I also like that it doesn\u2019t have an overwhelming fragrance and it never irritates my skin, even when it\u2019s feeling its most sensitive.\nThis powerful serum addresses uneven texture, minimizes pore size and nips acne in the bud, thanks to a formula packed with vitamin C, hyaluronic acid and salicylic acid (a known breakout buster). These ingredients work together to exfoliate and clear up acne-prone skin while simultaneously reducing fine lines and adding radiance. It\u2019s worth noting that the formula does contain a fragrance, which may be irritating for those with sensitive skin.\nBest Vitamin C Serum For Combination Skin\nA Fast-Absorbing Serum That Promotes A Healthy Glow\nSunday Riley C.E.O. Serum\nActive ingredients: Glycolic acid, vitamin C | Additional benefits: Fights signs of aging, minimizes redness, supports natural skin turnover | Consistency: Cream | Cruelty-free: Yes\nWhat you\u2019ll love:\nNo greasy residue\nCombination skin-friendly\nGently exfoliating\nKeep in mind:\nMay be too strong for everyday use for those with sensitive skin\nIf lackluster skin is your problem, this popular serum is here to help. The cruelty-free formula evens out skin tone and boosts radiance, featuring a 15% concentration of oil-soluble tetrahexyldecyl (THD) ascorbate, a type of vitamin C that absorbs quickly into the skin and is typically well-tolerated. Meanwhile, saccharide isomerate serves as a pore minimizer, while phytosterols work to reduce any redness or irritation for those with sensitive skin, making this a great option for anyone with combination skin.\nCult-favorite brand Supergoop\u2019s Daily Dose marries SPF with a serum for a powerhouse product that offers sun protection alongside the benefits of vitamin C. This double-duty noncomedogenic formula contains moisturizing ceramides, hydrating squalene and hyaluronic acid, and Kakadu plum for combating acne scars. Even on sensitive skin, this is gentle enough for daily use (which makes it great for everyday sun protection). I use this product underneath my tinted moisturizer to add a nice glow, and it blends in seamlessly. Plus, I feel good about protecting my complexion against the sun\u2019s damaging rays without needing a separate sunscreen.\nBest Vitamin C Serum For Hyperpigmentation\nA Top Pick That Delivers Visible Results\nRevision C+ Correcting Complex 30%\nActive ingredients: 30% THD ascorbic acid, vitamin E | Additional benefits: Protects against blue light and urban dust, supports skin\u2019s microbiome, improves fine lines | Consistency: Cream | Cruelty-free: Yes\nWhat you\u2019ll love:\nHigh concentration of vitamin C\nLightweight feel\nProtects against blue light\nKeep in mind:\nMay not be suitable for sensitive skin\nRevision\u2019s serum has 30% THD ascorbic acid, which is one of the highest concentrations on the market. The formula is a multi-tasking miracle, helping to do everything from brighten and even out skin tone to improve fine lines, correct hyperpigmentation and fend off free radical damage. Its lightweight cream consistency makes it a great choice for the majority of skin types. I love the feel of this serum on my skin: It\u2019s lightweight yet packs a very powerful punch, and I can instantly see an improvement in my lackluster tone.\nThe Ole Henriksen Banana Bright Vitamin C Serum works quickly to brighten and plump skin in as little as one week of consistent use, thanks to a trifecta of hardworking ingredients. The vegan, cruelty-free formula features 15% vitamin C to improve elasticity and reduce the look of dark spots, pores and wrinkles; 5% PHAs (polyhydroxy acids) to exfoliate and even skin tone; and hyaluronic acid to hydrate and plump skin. \u201cIt\u2019s so hydrating and lightweight; it immediately gives me a supple, radiant look,\u201d says Forbes Vetted sleep and mattress editor McKenzie Dillon. \u201cThe serum preps my skin so well in the morning that I don\u2019t use primer before makeup application. Plus, the smell is to die for.\u201d\nThe Forbes Vetted team has collectively researched, written and published a wide variety of beauty and grooming content, including dozens of stories on skincare.\nAuthor Kim Peiffer is the features and special projects director at Forbes Vetted and has 15-plus years of experience testing and covering beauty and lifestyle content.\nThis story was assigned, reviewed and edited by deputy editor Jane Sung, who oversees the beauty and grooming section and has spent two decades reporting on skincare, haircare, makeup and more.\nPeiffer enlisted the insight of Dr. Dendy Engelman, board-certified dermatologist and Mohs surgeon at Shafer Clinic in NYC, for her take on key formulations, ingredients and the most important factors to look for in vitamin C serums.\nWe regularly refresh this article to ensure that all of our recommendations are relevant and all product information is accurate. It was last updated by beauty and fashion writer Molly Calhoun in July 2025. She evaluated all picks to ensure they meet our criteria, and she added Naturium\u2019s Vitamin C Complex Serum.\nHow We Chose The Best Vitamin C Serums\nTo narrow down this list of the best vitamin C serums, we tapped into our team\u2019s deep market knowledge and extensive testing experience, highlighting products and brands that offer innovative, effective formulas.\nWe evaluated the key ingredients in our top picks to ensure the inclusion of a range of formulas that cater to various skin types and preferences.\nVitamin C has so much potential to deliver complexion-enhancing results, but choosing the right one can be challenging. Here are the most important factors to consider when choosing a vitamin C serum, according to Engelman.\nConcentration\nTo start, consider the concentration of vitamin C in the serum. \u201cThe concentration is key\u2014it\u2019s important to look for a formula with 10% to 20% [vitamin C] for optimal effectiveness,\u201d she says. Certain formulas have higher concentrations for more brightening power, but those with sensitive skin should opt for a lower dose to avoid any reactions.\nType Of Vitamin C\nCompanies use varying forms of vitamin C in their formulations, with the two most common being L-ascorbic acid and THD ascorbate. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown on each:\nL-ascorbic acid: This is 100% pure vitamin C. It\u2019s water soluble, well researched and effective, but extremely unstable. It begins to oxidize and change color over time and can be irritating to some people\u2019s skin.\nTetrahexyldecyl (THD) ascorbate: This ingredient is stable and fat soluble, so it can be used in oil-based products. It tends to be well tolerated and permeates the skin easily.\nAdditional Ingredients\nAdditional ingredients found in vitamin C serums offer added hydration, minimizing signs of aging, dark spot correcting and more. Some common ones to look for when addressing skin concerns include vitamin E, hyaluronic acid and squalane. \u201cAlso, pay attention to stabilizing ingredients such as ferulic acid, which enhance the serum\u2019s efficacy and stability,\u201d says Engelmen.\nFormula Type\nVitamin C products come in the form of creams, serums and oils, and some skin types may react differently to each. Although nearly all of the picks on this list can be characterized as a serum due to their highly concentrated ingredients that penetrate deep within the skin, each formula has subtle differences in consistency and overall feel.\nPackaging\nEngelman says that how vitamin C is packaged is crucial. \u201cThe bottle should protect the serum by blocking light and air to preserve its potency,\u201d she says. If the formula itself has turned brown, it has oxidized, which means it\u2019s not as effective. Shelf life varies from brand to to brand, but most vitamin C serums last around three to four months.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWe chose the SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic serum as the best vitamin C serum overall; it fights environmental aging using high concentrations of a trio of antioxidants: vitamin C (15% pure L-ascorbic acid), vitamin E (1% alpha tocopherol) and ferulic acid. In terms of potency, the Revision C+ Correcting Complex 30% offers the highest concentration of vitamin C on this list, which is why it\u2019s our top pick for hyperpigmentation.\nEngelman recommends two vitamin C serums in particular: the SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic and the SkinMedica Vitamin C+E Complex. In addition to addressing hyperpigmentation, both formulas protect against future free radical damage, which means you\u2019re investing in your skin\u2019s health in both the immediate and long term.\nYes, you can apply vitamin C serum daily, as long as your skin tolerates it. In fact, you\u2019re more likely to see positive results with consistent use. Engelman recommends vitamin C serums for all skin types to protect against free radical damage and environmental aggressors.\nWe reviewed all selections to ensure they\u2019re relevant, and we added Naturium\u2019s Vitamin C Complex Serum to our list. We also updated all pricing information.\nWe refreshed our FAQ section and ensured all pricing information is accurate.\nWe reviewed all selections and product information, as well as refreshing our FAQ section."

Over the next several months, our editors will determine our 2026 list winners with deep research, consultation with industry experts and extensive hands-on testing. We will be evaluating contenders across several categories\u2014home and kitchen, mattresses and sleep, tech and electronics, fitness, parenting, beauty, fashion and travel\u2014to ultimately name the best-in-class products of the year. We will also be awarding the most impressive newcomers of the year, and will evaluate novel products or updated models that launch in the year 2025 itself.\nIn preparation for the 2026 edition of the awards, which will launch in March of next year, we\u2019re inviting submissions for consideration. If you\u2019d like to submit a product, read on: Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the process for the 2026 Forbes Vetted Best Product Awards.\nHow To Submit Products For The 2026 Forbes Vetted Best Product Awards\nTo submit a product for the 2026 Forbes Vetted Best Product Awards, complete the submission form by clicking HERE. There is a non-refundable $295 entry fee for each product submission. If you are submitting more than one (1) product for consideration, each product must be submitted separately, and each will have a nonrefundable $295 entry fee. The deadline for submissions is Tuesday, September 30th, 2025 at 11:59pm EST. After completing the submission form, please email your receipt of payment to forbesvettedawards@forbes.com.\nIf you would like to submit a product for consideration after Tuesday, September 30th, 2025, we will be accepting last-minute submissions until Friday, November 21st, 2025 at 11:59 p.m EST. There is a nonrefundable $395 entry fee for each last-minute product submission.

The testing window begins in September 2025 and will continue as required until the awards are announced in March 2026. Please note: We will only reach out for samples of products that fit within our awards categories and those we do not already have had hands-on testing experience.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, any products submitted for consideration via this submission process will be considered along with products that have already been evaluated and potentially recommended via Forbes Vetted. Regardless of how the product has come to us for consideration, all products will be reviewed using the same criteria and have the same opportunity of being named a winner. In the event we do not receive an entry that we deem meets the standards we have set for the 2026 Forbes Vetted Best Product Awards in one or more categories, we reserve the right to not name a winner for such category(ies).\nWhen evaluating all products, we begin with deep research of the category at hand, and consult a range of industry experts across categories to better understand what qualities to consider when naming our winners. We then develop unique rubrics to employ for our testing process. Once a product contender is in hand, we will test it for up to 12 weeks and evaluate it against several criteria, including the following: quality, value, ease of use, performance, innovation and warranties. We\u2019ll use the testing data we glean from all contenders to then name a winner for each category.\nForbes Vetted Best Product Awards Seal\nIf your product is chosen to be featured in the Forbes Vetted Best Product Awards, you will be given the option to enter into a paid license agreement with us for the use of our awards seal, plus quotes from our reviewers and other assets, for your promotional purposes.

      "text": "The best face moisturizers absorb quickly and hydrate skin without leaving behind a greasy finish or residue. Before choosing one, you\u2019ll first want to consider your skin type. For most people, theSkinCeuticals Triple Lipid Restore 2:4:2is an excellent option that feels moisturizing yet lightweight, absorbs instantly and boosts overall radiance thanks to its lipid-rich formula. If you\u2019re prone to dryness or flakiness, opt for an intensely hydrating formula like the peptide- and ceramide-infused Dieux Instant Angel Moisturizer.\nDermatologist Dr. James Y. Wang notes that your environment can also play a crucial role in helping you determine the right facial moisturizer. For instance, you may need a more nourishing cream if you live in colder areas, while those in warmer climates could get away with a lightweight gel formula. After consulting with deputy editor Jane Sung and Wang, we\u2019ve rounded the best face moisturizers for every skin type and budget.\nContains essential oils, which can be irritating to some\nNo matter your skin type, it\u2019s important to moisturize it twice a day.

Its key ingredients include La Roche-Posay\u2019s prebiotic thermal water (a soothing antioxidant), ceramide-3 (which helps retain moisture and maintain a healthy skin barrier) and niacinamide (a form of vitamin b3 that targets skin discoloration).\nThe Dieux Instant Angel cream intensely hydrates and leaves skin with a glow. This fragrance-free pickis infused with peptides, ceramides and barrier-supportive ingredients that boost hydration and provide a dewy finish. Although the texture is on the richer side, it doesn\u2019t feel thick or leave behind a layer of residue (read: no pilling).

In addition, lipo-hydroxy acid, also known as LHA (a derivative of salicylic acid) helps with gentle exfoliation. This lightweight formula also reduces the appearance of enlarged pores and makes a great base for makeup.\nBest Face Moisturizer For Acne-Prone Skin\nContains 1% Salicylic Acid To Help Prevent Breakouts\nIf you have acne-prone skin, you\u2019ll want to choose a formula that can treat flare-ups and hydrate the skin without further clogging pores. The Origins Clear Improvement Moisturizer is a great option with 1% salicylic acid to help prevent breakouts and blackheads while boosting hydration.

Besides being aesthetically pleasing, its minimalist packaging is refillable, too.\nThis article was written by contributors Wendy Sy and Stephanie Montes, who specialize in beauty and fashion coverage.\nDeputy editor Jane Sung assigned and edited all iterations of this article and approved all product selections. She oversees the beauty and grooming category and has more than 15 years of experience as a lifestyle journalist.\nWe gathered key insights and tips on what to consider in a face moisturizer from Dr. James Y. Wang, owner of Metropolis Dermatology.\nThis article is regularly updated to ensure all of the above brands and products continue to meet our criteria for the best face moisturizers.\nHow We Chose The Best Face Moisturizers\nTo curate this list of best face moisturizers, we tested dozens of options and conducted in-depth research on products from leading brands, including SkinCeuticals, La Roche-Posay, Dieux and more. In addition, we consulted a board-certified dermatologist for additional insight.\nTo select the best face moisturizers, we evaluated each option\u2019s formula and consistency and chose ones that cater to a variety of skin types.\nWe also included picks from related facial moisturizer roundups for specific skin types that were carefully researched and tested.\nThe selections were also made based on feedback found from combing through product reviews.\nOur final list includes a variety of moisturizers for every skin type and budget.\nWhat To Consider In A Face Moisturizer\nBesides knowing your skin type, it\u2019s ideal to keep your environment and surroundings in mind. For example, someone who lives in Reykjavik would need a much more nourishing cream than someone in Los Angeles, who could get away with a lightweight gel consistency. \u201cMoisturizers do not exist in isolation, and your other skincare routine will also determine which one is right for you,\u201d says Dr. Wang, a board-certified dermatologist and owner of Metropolis Dermatology. Those on the drier side might consider using a serum or oil in tandem, and someone using retinol at night would benefit from an SPF-infused moisturizer during the day.\nIngredients\nLike most beauty products, moisturizers are not one-size-fits-all\u2014they can run the gamut in terms of the types of ingredients. Wang recommends looking for formulas that include ceramides, hyaluronic acid and glycerin, which he describes as \u201cthe most scientifically proven ingredients. These help to repair the skin barrier while drawing water up from deeper skin layers to the surface.\u201d Wang also adds that dry, flaky skin can repel water, but when your moisturizer is actually helping the barrier, your skin retains the water and sees long-term benefits.\nSkin Type\nRather than purchase moisturizers with the cutest packaging or best photos on Instagram, allowing your skin type to guide your decision makes all the difference in efficacy. However, \u201cit is often not easy to tell what [kind] you have because some products will induce dry or oily skin, which may not be your natural skin type,\u201d says Wang. He recommends going on skincare fast or consulting a dermatologist before developing a long-term plan.\nOnce you\u2019ve determined your skin type, keep in mind Wang\u2019s suggestions. \u201cSensitive skin types should always avoid fragrance or oils in their moisturizer\u2014even natural oils can cause irritation,\u201d he says. \u201cOily skin types should avoid occlusive moisturizers (these sit on the surface of your skin) and use only light lotions after a gentle skin cleanser.\u201d As for combination skin, Wang says \u201cthis is somewhat of a fabricated type because it is often caused by overdrying the skin with a harsh cleanser, which induces the skin to make excess oil. In this case, it\u2019s best to use a gentle cleanser followed by a light moisturizer daily, even if the skin feels oily. Over time, the skin will rebalance and become less oily.\"\nConsistency\nWhen you think of a moisturizer, visions of face creams in a jar most often come time mind\u2014but they can come in various formulations. \u201cLotions and creams are great for skin repair, as they often contain ceramides and healing properties,\u201d says Wang. He only recommends balms and ointments for eczema and flare-ups to create a defensive skin barrier.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nThe SkinCeuticals Triple Lipid Restore 2:4:2 is our best overall pick and a top-rated moisturizer. This lipid-rich cream is made for those with dry, normal and mature skin. Infused with ceramides, natural cholesterol and fatty acids, the fast-absorbing formula deeply nourishes skin and helps diminish signs of aging.\nThere\u2019s no one face moisturizer that\u2019s fitting for everyone. What works for your skin may not be the best option for your sister or best friend. Wang recommends consulting with a dermatologist to determine your specific skin type, which can make choosing the right products easier.\nUsing face moisturizers consistently is the best way to keep your skin hydrated. Wang notes that depending on your skin type, including other products such as serums and sunscreen is also important to use in your overall routine."

      "text": "A good hyaluronic acid serum keeps skin hydrated and soft, and can easily be incorporated into a skincare routine. While our bodies naturally produce it, production slows down as we age, causing a gradual loss in skin hydration and elasticity. Our top picks for the best hyaluronic acid serums, like the Cosrx The Hyaluronic Acid 3 Serum and The Ordinary\u2019s Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 Hydrating Serum, can help plump dry, flaky skin without causing irritation or sensitivity.\nWhen choosing the right formula, pay special attention to the concentration, key ingredients and molecular weight. \u201cI like to look for products that contain multi-molecular weights of hyaluronic acid; they penetrate different depths of the epidermis, giving a plumping effect that is perfect for temporarily improving the appearance of fine lines and crepey skin,\u201d says dermatologist and KilgourMD founder Dr. James Kilgour. After consulting with deputy editor Jane Sung and several experts, we\u2019ve rounded up the best hyaluronic acid serums to rejuvenate your skin.\nWhen it comes to molecular percentage, the lower the number, the smaller the molecular weight and the better it can permeate the skin. Cosrx\u2019s Hyaluronic Acid 3 serum uses a 3% low molecular hyaluronic acid, which penetrates deeper and provides maximum moisture and hydration instantly and over time. This pick is hydrating enough to plump the driest, flakiest skin and lightweight enough to be worn under makeup. Plus, it includes ceramides and an amino acid complex to protect against external stressors.\nBest Value Hyaluronic Acid Serum\nAn Affordable Formula With High-Quality Actives\nThe Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5\nThe Ordinary has a cult following for its incredibly efficacious lineup of active ingredients at an affordable cost. This $10 serum hydrates skin without making it look greasy, a great option even for those with oily skin. It features five different forms of hyaluronic acid and added ceramides for skin barrier support without the slick occlusives like oils and silicones that can be found in alternative options.\nBest Luxury Hyaluronic Acid Serum\nA Plumping Hydrator Worth The Splurge\nIsdinceutics Hyaluronic Concentrate\nA few drops of this luxurious serum morning and night help to boost skin elasticity, increase collagen and enhance the skin\u2019s overall appearance. Packed with hyaluronic acid, peptides and a proprietary extract called BioMarine, these ingredients help to soften fine lines and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. Isdin\u2019s oil-free, non-comedogenic serum also gives skin a natural light-from-within glow minus the shine, and thanks to lentil extract, pores look more refined.\nBest Hyaluronic Acid Serum With Niacinamide\nAn Instant Hydrator With Long-Term Benefits\nCeraVe Hydrating Hyaluronic Acid Serum\nThis serum has two major draws: an accessible price tag and an encapsulated delivery system. The latter means it releases moisture-boosting ingredients like ceramides and hyaluronic acid around the clock, which work together for optimum results. Hyaluronic acid provides instant hydration, and ceramides help protect, repair, and restore damaged skin barrier over time. The consistency, similar to a thin lotion, absorbs into the skin quickly without leaving any sticky residue.\nBest Hyaluronic Acid Serum With Vitamin C\nA Reparative Formula With Three Forms Of Vitamin C\nSuperegg Tonal Scenery Reparative Serum\nThis fairly inconspicuous bottle contains a seriously impressive cocktail of active ingredients. Along with hyaluronic acid, this reparative serum features snow mushroom for added hydration, niacinamide, licorice root, tranexamic acid and three forms of vitamin C, which help fade hyperpigmentation and prevent the appearance of new dark spots. Plus, peptides and purslane help boost collagen formation to minimize the look of fine lines and maximize elasticity in the skin. The formula is also fragrance-free and gentle enough for even the most sensitive skin types.\nBest Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Mature Skin\nTargets Skin Texture And Elasticity\nSkinCeuticals Hyaluronic Acid Intensifier\nAlthough expensive, this effective gel-like serum works as both a humectant to absorb water into the skin andan emollient to lock water into the skin. Its potent blend of pure hyaluronic acid, Proxylane, licorice root and purple rice boosts skin\u2019s hydration levels and helps improve texture and elasticity. Proxylane, a sugar protein found in certain types of wood, targets skin firmness and can help maintain a smooth, youthful complexion.\nBest Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Acne-Prone Skin\nA Non-Comedogenic Serum That Smoothes Texture\nMOST POPULAR\nLa Roche-Posay Hyalu B5 Serum\nThis serum blends two types of hyaluronic acid\u2014one with a high molecular weight and one low\u2014to provide immediate surface- and deep-level hydration in a single formula. And those with oily or acne-prone skin can rest easy knowing the non-comedogenic formula goes on weightless and won\u2019t exacerbate breakouts. Instead, it works to plump fine lines and smooth bumpy or uneven textures.\nBest Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Oily Skin\nA Gel-Like Serum With A Matte Finish\nPeter Thomas Roth Water Drench\nAnyone with oily skin would understandably want to avoid using anything too emollient for fear of it making their skin feel greasy. And while this serum is incredibly hydrating, the oil-free liquid gel-like texture melts right into the skin and dries completely matte. Added sodium PCA and silk proteins help reduce the look of fine lines and rough texture, leaving skin smoother and brighter.\nAuthor of this piece Stephanie Montes is a beauty contributor with over a decade of experience covering lifestyle topics. Over the years, she has tested dozens of serums, from drugstore to luxury selections.\nThis story was assigned and produced by deputy editor Jane Sung, who leads the beauty and grooming category and has 15-plus years of experience covering beauty and wellness.\nWe enlisted the help of several skincare experts to inform our selection process, including Dr. Lauren Moy, MD, dermatologist and double board-certified surgeon; Dr. James Kilgour, resident Standford dermatologist and founder of KilgourMD; and Varuni Palacios, licensed esthetician and founder of Studio Varuni.\nHow We Chose The Best Hyaluronic Acid Serums\nTo select the best hyaluronic acid serums, we carefully evaluated options from top retailers and brands, including Corsx, The Ordinary, CeraVe and more. We also consulted with several industry experts for insights on what to look for.\nWe analyzed each serum\u2019s ingredients, texture and application to assess its overall value and help readers pinpoint the best option for their needs.\nOur final list includes options for different skin types and concerns, ranging from acne-prone to mature.\nOur three experts also made recommendations based on their experiences, while customer reviews were examined for standout product traits.\nAs everyone\u2019s budget looks slightly different, we included a wide range of prices.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nThe most effective hyaluronic acid serum depends on your skin type and goals. However, there are a few things to remember when evaluating different options. \u201cLook for serums with multiple types of hyaluronic acid and a good supporting cast of ingredients,\u201d says Moy, who favors the brands SkinCeuticals, The Ordinary and La Roche-Posay. When in doubt, make your selection based on the additional actives and what you hope to achieve.\n\u201cHyaluronic acid is frequently recommended by dermatologists, both for topical use in a serum and as an injectable,\u201d says Kilgour. Since it\u2019s a naturally occurring substance in the body, non-comedogenic and very low-risk, dermatologists favor this hydration hero.\nWhile a higher percentage may seem like the better choice, Moy advises that more isn\u2019t always better with hyaluronic acid. \u201cA concentration of one to two percent is usually effective enough,\u201d she says. How you use the product is far more important than a high percentage. To ensure it\u2019s absorbed properly, remember to apply your serum to a damp face for the best results."
