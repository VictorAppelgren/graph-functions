      "summary": "The Social Security program, signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt 90 years ago, currently provides benefits to nearly 69 million Americans but faces a looming financial shortfall projected to occur by 2034. Recent legislative changes, including the Social Security Fairness Act, have impacted benefit levels, while the Trump administration has been criticized for not proposing long-term solutions to strengthen the program. Discussions around potential privatization and benefit reductions have resurfaced, as experts suggest various approaches to ensure the program's sustainability for future generations.",
