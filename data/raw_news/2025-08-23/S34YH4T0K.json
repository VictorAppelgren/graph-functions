  "description": "Home Depot\u2019s Pro Xtra loyalty program offers bulk discounts, exclusive pricing, business tools, and perks like reserved parking and fast checkout.",
  "content": "What Is Home Depot's Pro Xtra Loyalty Program And What Does It Offer?\n\nApart from being a highly recommended store for DIYers, Home Depot is a go-to retailer for contractors, remodelers, maintenance crews, and other professionals. Home Depot tries to ensure customer satisfaction and retention by rewarding them for their purchases. One of these is the Pro Xtra loyalty program, which works much like a frequent flyer program, but for building supplies. The perks members enjoy include discounts, special promos, and exclusive offers that help lower the costs of future purchases. Members automatically gain access to these benefits and more. For instance, they receive discounts on bulk purchases and gain access to more competitive pricing on products that are in line with their work, including Home Depot finds for home mechanics. For business owners, the program provides access to tools for purchase tracking and organizing records for budgeting or tax purposes. The program is also designed to help members earn rewards relatively quickly. Members using Home Depot's Pro Xtra Credit Card can unlock rewards four times faster than those who don't. Other advantages for pro members include reserved parking at certain branches, quicker checkout lanes, and the option to request quotes for large orders through the retailer's Volume Pricing Program. Small benefits, like getting complimentary drinks or snacks while shopping, are also offered.\n\nWho is eligible to join Home Depot Pro Xtra loyalty program? Home Depot's Pro Xtra loyalty program \u2014 as its name implies \u2014 is mainly intended for professionals, including licensed contractors, electricians, plumbers, HVAC technicians, painters, property managers, maintenance crews, and other service providers. However, it's open to anyone, and you don't need a license to register. Expert non-professionals are welcome to join and take advantage of the discounts on different Home Depot tools for DIY projects. Still, Pro Xtra largely benefits those who engage in business-type transactions. The targeted rewards and resources are not only designed to build loyalty, but they can also help pro members with their shopping by providing them access to tools, pricing, and services that go beyond what regular retail customers receive. For instance, verified Pro members can use the Pro Online Experience \u2014 a set of digital tools that allows them to track past orders, create reusable shopping lists, and manage multiple shipping addresses. The program also integrates with the Path to Pro network, connecting them to a community of skilled workers and potential collaborators. Home Depot's loyalty strategy is a hybrid approach with some perks available to all members, while larger discounts depend on spending thresholds. This tiered system rewards the most frequent buyers with greater savings, encouraging long-term business.\n\nThere are many ways to sign up for Home Depot's Pro Xtra loyalty program. You can do it online via the official Home Depot website or mobile app. You can also register in person at the Pro Desk at any Home Depot store or by calling the company's customer service line. Professionals and business owners are required to provide standard information, such as company name, address, and email. If you are a non-professional who wants access to Home Depot's offers on power tools for home garages, simply choose the DIY/homeowner option when asked about your trade. Once approved, you will receive immediate access to the program's benefits. Pro Xtra does not require a sign-up or membership fee, so you don't need to renew your membership yearly to enjoy perks. Your membership will not expire as long as your account remains active. To keep your account current, be sure to scan your Pro Xtra Virtual ID every time you process a transaction at the checkout counter. Not only will this enable reward tracking, but it will also inform the system that you're still an active Pro Xtra member. For easy and fast scanning both in-store and online, save your Virtual ID in the Home Depot app. For a more convenient payment experience, you can get a Home Depot Credit Card and link it to your account.",

      "text": "5 Home Depot Finds No Home Mechanic Should Be Without\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nAutomotive upkeep and repair are some of the most mechanically-involved activities you can get up to in your own home. A car is kind of like a gigantic steel puzzle; every single part needs to be both in working order and in perfect harmony with every part around it, or the entire thing can stop working properly. This is why you can't undertake upkeep half-heartedly \u2014 if you try to fix any small problems with your car with some random tools you found in your junk drawer, you're liable to make those problems substantially worse. Car insurance doesn't cover self-inflicted mishaps, you know.\nIf you've got the drive to be a home mechanic, you're going to need a set of tools and equipment that are just as up to the job. From mighty power tools to comprehensive fittings, if you've got a suite of professional-grade tools, you'll be able to fix and maintain your car as well as any full garage without needing to call a tow truck.\nIf you're looking to build out your mechanic arsenal, try visiting your local Home Depot. There are plenty of great tools on offer, five of which we can recommend with the assistance of professional mechanics. More information on our selection methodology is available at the bottom of the page.\nHusky 270-Piece Mechanics Tool Set\nThe first thing any burgeoning mechanic needs is a proverbial bag of tricks. More specifically, you need a professional-grade tool box packed to the gills with every possible adjustment tool and fitting you could need for basic adjustments on your car and its components. Such a set can help to not only knock out simple loosening and tightening, but help to elucidate when you might need something a little more heavy-duty.\nThe 270-piece Mechanics tool set from Husky is a great place to start your automotive journey. This massive set includes three different 72-teeth ratchets, a myriad of drive and bit sockets of various sizes, drive extensions, and 8 combination wrenches. All of this is packed up into a sturdy storage case with built-in size-organizing drawers so you always know where to find a tool or fitting. Both the tools and fittings are made of heat-treated S2 steel, ready to stand by your side throughout your mechanical pursuits.\nThe Husky Mechanics Tool Set is available at Home Depot for $199.00, where it has a user rating of 4.6 out of 5. DIY YouTube channel Crossthread Garage was pleasantly surprised by the sheer number of sockets included in the set for every possible occasion, as well as the marked drawers for easy parts location.\nMilwaukee M18 FUEL 1/2 in. Impact Wrench\nA car is absolutely rife with fasteners of just about every shape and size, some of which can go neglected for a while. Even if the rest of your car is in good shape, a lone bolt can get stuck in place if you forget about it for long enough, to the point that it stubbornly refuses to yield to a regular wrench when you need to turn it. If you've got a pesky bolt somewhere on your car that demands a little more muscle, it's time to respond in kind.\nMilwaukee's M18 FUEL Impact Wrench is a real haymaker of a power tool, utilizing a brushless motor to deliver up to 1,100 ft-lbs of torque for driving in fasteners, as well as up to 1,600 ft-lbs for removing them. The built-in Friction Ring allows for smooth and simple socket changes so you can snap on a socket at a moment's notice, while the Battery Isolator helps to dampen the intense vibrational force and reduce strain.\nThe Milwaukee M18 FUEL Impact Wrench is available at Home Depot for $299.00, where it has a user rating of 4.9 out of 5. Tool review YouTube channel Shop Tool Reviews was impressed by the absolutely brutal torque output from this device, so much so that it actually outpaced the large fastening anvils they were testing with.\nHusky 3-Ton Aluminum/Steel Car Jack\nUnless you happen to be very good at limbo, you can't easily get underneath your car for maintenance and repairs on the bottom of the carriage. You obviously can't lift and hold your car with your own power either, unless you happen to be a superhero. In such times, you need a sturdy and reliable means of propping up your vehicle so you can work safely beneath it.\nThe Husky 3-Ton Car Jack is made up of a combination of aluminum and steel, granting it both impressive durability and a relatively light body. The device itself only weighs about 60 pounds, but its dual-piston pump can hold up to 6,000 pounds at up to 18 inches into the air. Don't worry about putting excessive pressure on one side of your car, as the jack saddle has a rubber padded design to prevent any marks or damage.\nThe Husky 3-Ton Car Jack is available at Home Depot for $199.00, where it has a user rating of 4.5 out of 5. Users appreciate the smooth action of the pump and piston, allowing for quick and easy setups. Several users enjoyed the jack's compact and discrete design, which helps to prevent tripping over it while moving around a garage.\nMilwaukee M12 FUEL High Speed 1/4 in. Ratchet\nA car is full of narrow nooks, each of which is jam-packed with fasteners in weird, obtuse spots. Even if you've got something powerful on hand like an impact wrench, it's going to be doing exactly nothing if you can't actually reach the fastener you're targeting. Normally, the tool of choice in this scenario is a ratchet, but you don't exactly have a lot of room for repetitive twisting motions either. Instead, just let a little motor handle it.\nThe Milwaukee M12 FUEL High Speed Ratchet takes both the guesswork and the repetitive motions out of spinning obtuse fasteners. Just stick the tip into a nook, place the bit over a fastener, and squeeze the variable speed trigger. The brushless motor spins the bit at up to 450 RPM, delivering up to 35 ft-lbs of torque, and is perfect for quirky bolts in weird spots. Milwaukee's proprietary REDLINK PLUS technology helps to regulate the flow of power from the battery pack, preventing overheating and overloading during extended usage, allowing you to spend the day in your car with peace of mind.\nMilwaukee's M12 FUEL High Speed Ratchet is available at Home Depot for $199.00, where it has a user rating of 4.7 out of 5. Kenny Koehler of Pro Tool Reviews gave this tool a sparkling 9.6 out of 10 rating, praising its steadfast power and comfortable grip.\nMilwaukee M12 ROVER Service and Repair Flood Light\nWhether you're working underneath your car or have your head buried in the hood compartment, it's pretty much a given that it's going to be dark in there. Cars may demand precision maintenance from you, but their cramped spaces don't exactly do much to facilitate that precision. If you want to do your work properly, you'll need a reliable way to shed a little light on the situation.\nMilwaukee's M12 ROVER Flood Light is the perfect modular lighting source for maintenance and repair work both in and out of your car. It's small and light, perfectly sized to hold in your hands while you inspect your car's internals with its 700 lumen beam. When it's time to work with your hands, though, you can plant the magnetic body right onto any metal surface (of which you have no shortage of in a car) and bend the light panel to your ideal angle. Whenever you're done working in the dark, you can also use this device as a portable phone charger, drawing from its battery with a 2.1 amp USB output.\nThe Milwaukee M12 Rover Flood Light is available at Home Depot for $79.00, where it has a user rating of 4.9 out of 5. DIY YouTuber Jake Weihe gave this light high marks for its compact and convenient design, as well as the reliability of its magnetic grip.\nSelection methodology\nThe preceding products were selected from Home Depot's online catalog of mechanics' tools, including power tools and workshop equipment. Preference was given to products with a user rating of at least 4 out of 5, as well as positive feedback from an accredited tool review publication or YouTube channel with at least 3,000 subscribers."

      "text": "5 Of The Best Home Depot Finds For Expert DIYers\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nThe expert DIY renovator is a special case. These homeowners spend countless hours poring over project plans and making mistakes while fixing up problem areas in their residences. DIY projects tend to involve a bit of on-the-job learning, but the expert fixer has been through all that heartache and slow progress to learn a broad range of skills. They leverage these to continue tackling ever more complicated projects that promise to amplify the beauty and functionality of their home to even greater heights.\nA seasoned home renovator knows that their skill and capability are intimately tied to the tools. Whether it's power tools from big brand names, support systems that bring added flexibility (like DIY storage solutions), or key safety measures into the picture (think ladders, eye protection, or blade sharpening tools), a resource for finding new gear is crucial. Lowe's offers some solid DIY options, as do Harbor Freight and many others. But the outlet with the largest overall presence in America may be Home Depot. Handheld power tools can be rented from the orange home improvement icon (as well as plenty of other, larger pieces of equipment). There are more than 2,000 Home Depot locations in the United States, and the brand's catalog includes a number of expert-level finds that can amplify your capabilities significantly as you approach a new job. Here are five of the home improvement giant's offerings that can make a big impact right away.\nMetalTech 6-Foot Baker Scaffold with Platform\nScaffolding accessories often feel like overkill. During most DIY jobs, there is no real need to raise the surface you're standing on by a significant margin. Plenty of jobs demand the use of a ladder or even a basic work platform, but in most situations, the tasks found overhead are limited or involve lightweight fixtures or tool usage. Getting up to perform the swap, repair, or installation and returning to the ground is common in residential projects. However, when it comes to building new components around the house or working on projects like gutter repair or garage door installation, getting up to the project space's height level and remaining there with all your gear is crucial.\nThis is where a tool like the MetalTech 6-Foot Baker Scaffold with Platform comes into play. This scaffolding platform solution features a safe reach of up to 12 feet high. It offers interoperability with additional units, allowing users to stack up to three on top of one another for a maximum rated height of 24 feet. The platform can be raised or lowered in 2-inch increments to accommodate the exact height you require for any particular job. It can carry a maximum load of 1,250 pounds, more than enough to support multiple workers and their tools. This is a great solution for any major projects that require height and a little more freedom than a ladder. Major painting works or drywall installation in a new extension or addition to your property, in particular, are jobs the scaffold can help with.\nDeWalt Black Steel Tamper (10x10 inch head)\nA tamper doesn't evoke significant responses from most people. It's not an exciting or particularly interesting-looking tool. But what a tamper lacks in pizzazz, it makes up for with massive functional range. Anyone tackling jobs outside can benefit significantly from the addition of this site preparation tool. The tamper is a tool used to level base gravel before laying down a concrete pad or paver walkway. It can be leveraged when performing asphalt repairs. It's also ideal for packing dirt ahead of landscaping projects that require flattened or otherwise compacted soil layers. When tackling yard projects, walkways, driveways, and even sand layers to support other building tasks, a steel tamper that's built with durability and a large plate is an ideal and versatile tool.\nEven with its utility, not all tampers feature the same points of focus for overall build quality. A versatile solution is the DeWalt Black Steel Tamper. Available at Home Depot for $55, it features hardened steel construction with a welded connection between the base plate and handle. The plate features a square, 10x10-inch face while the handle measures 44.88 inches and is adorned with an overmold end grip to prevent fatigue over lengthy periods of use.\nRidgid 190 Amp Multi-Process Welder with Start Up Kit\nWelding is a specialist project area, to be sure. Some casual home improvers won't go near these kinds of jobs, and part of the reason is that welding equipment feels foreign and off-limits in many instances. Many DIY enthusiasts will be intimately familiar with beginner woodworking projects or even dabble in intermediate carpentry tasks. Plumbing and electrical work may also be within the purview of many DIYers, as are jobs like landscaping and even brickwork in some cases. But when metal components break, plenty of homeowners throw in the towel and opt for a replacement rather than seeking to repair the item themselves. This is where expert-level DIYers may ultimately set themselves apart.\nIn order to work on welding tasks, you'll first need a welder. The Ridgid 190 Amp Multi-Process Welder with Start Up Kit is available from Home Depot. You'll find it as a kit or the multi-process welder on its own. The multi-process unit enables you to work with any welding solution that suits your needs and the job's specific parameters.\nRidgid is a consistent name in the professional contractor market, and this welder offers coverage across four separate welding processes (MIG, stick, flux-core, and DC TIG), as well as dual voltage support (120 and 240 volts) and output levels ranging from 10 to 200 amps. In addition to the welder, you'll receive a 2-pound spool of .030-inch flux-core wire, an ADF helmet, and gloves.\nVevor Ratcheting Pipe Bender Kit\nWorking on your home's HVAC systems is no joke. Many homeowners call in professionals to handle these kinds of tasks, but the most hardened DIYers know that with a little bit of research and a willingness to figure it out, even HVAC repair is something that an experienced home improver can accomplish. Of course, as is the case with any other complex repair job, if you find yourself in over your head, it's always best to call in a professional to support your needs.\nFor those with confidence in their abilities, a pipe bender will quickly become a necessary tool. The Vevor Ratcheting Pipe Bender Kit offers a great starting point. It's an ideal solution for bending aluminum alloy and copper tubing, commonly used in various helpful applications. These kinds of pipes feed refrigeration systems, air conditioning units, oil supply hookups, and plumbing systems. They may also feature in environmental control assets and automotive or pneumatic systems you may have installed in the house.\nIn many instances, PVC pipe and other softer tubing solutions just aren't the right tool for the job. When a metal tube is necessary, the need to bend that piping quickly arises. This ratcheting pipe bender offers up to 90-degree bends in both forward and reverse directions, with coverage for pipes ranging from \u00bc-inch to 7/8-inch diameters. It also comes with a bearing-type pipe cutter and a deburring tool, as well as other accessory components, providing comprehensive coverage of many standard piping job requirements in this area.\nKlein Tools Premium Electrical Testing Tool Set\nWorking through electrical jobs is yet another task that's not for the faint of heart. Even basic rewiring demands a willingness to dive into the classically murky world of electrical current. If you're just changing out an outlet, it might be fairly simple to hit the power and swap connections on each wire one at a time. However, adding new sockets, installing additional lighting elements, or engaging in more substantial rewiring operations to add new lines to your circuit board can quickly become a significant challenge. Keep in mind that any job involving electricity is inherently hazardous. Do not attempt to work on electricity without expert assistance.\nAnyone even remotely familiar with electrical work will know that the first step in avoiding potential problem areas with electricity is to shut off the power. But this isn't the only safety precaution that DIY sparkies must take. Electrical testing equipment is a key resource that helps prevent unexpected shocks or damage to the system or home. Testing an outlet or switch after you've hit the power allows you to work on the element knowing with complete certainty that it is not carrying live current.\nOne way to add a layer of safety to an electrical job is to use Klein Tools' Premium Electrical Testing Tool Set or a similar product. The set comes with a digital multimeter, a pen tester, and an outlet tester solution. The trio allows you to safely engage with any electrical system you might tackle, be it a part of the home or a standalone electronic device you're hoping to bring back to life. The multimeter, in particular, delivers a tremendous range. You can test batteries and continuity with the tool, as well as current, resistance, and AC/DC voltage."

      "text": "5 Home Depot Tools That Are Must-Haves For Any Home Garage\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nWorking in a garage is a highly satisfying hobby that many people incorporate into their weekend routines or evening plans. Lots of home garage mechanics do it for themselves, restoring project cars as a labor of love. Others open their home workshop up to the public, transforming the space into a secondary moneymaking gig. Bringing more cash into the budget is generally a welcome change, and it's especially valuable if you are getting to do what you love in order to earn those extra dollars. Either way, home mechanics also need to spend some dough on occasion. There are plenty of tools and support equipment that act as necessary purchases when tackling even the simplest jobs around the shop.\nWhether you're performing a basic oil change on your neighbor's ride or rebuilding a project car's engine from scratch, you can't accomplish the job without the right tools. A few key essentials can go a long way. Additions like a versatile ratchet and socket set, or a creeper seat to support your knees and back as you move around a vehicle you're working on are significant improvements. These and a few other crucial, must-have tools form the basis of a functional and competent home garage.\nHusky 4.5 Gallon 175 PSI Portable Electric Oil-Free Jobsite Air Compressor\nAn air compressor is a crucial tool that plays a vital role in the functionality of many auto mechanics. Many home mechanics lack access to the extensive tool options that come with having an air compressor in the shop. Those who haven't utilized these tools before might not understand what the transition to an air compressor entails regarding cubic feet per minute (CFM) ratings and tank sizes, with fear of the unknown playing an integral role.\nThe reality is that adding an air compressor to the workshop doesn't have to be costly, and it unlocks an entire ecosystem of workplace solutions that can transform your experience under the hood. The Husky 4.5 Gallon 175 PSI Portable Electric Oil-Free Jobsite Air Compressor is a great example. Listed at Home Depot for $219, the air compressor features a 1.3-horsepower output and a 3.0 standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM) rating at 90 PSI, alongside important features like dual tool capabilities and quiet operation. All this is to say nothing of the tool's portability, making it an ideal choice for an early entrance into the world of air tools. This compressor offers oil-free running and can be used to pump up car and bike tires, air mattresses, and toys. Naturally, running nail guns in a variety of gauges is another option, making it a solution suitable for DIY projects around the house beyond your garage requirements. It weighs roughly 70 pounds, and the condensed overall frame provides good portability in a variety of use cases.\nHusky Modular Tool Storage Workbench Cabinet (52x20 inch)\nWork surfaces and storage cabinetry are essential for users of all varieties. Whether you're a carpenter or a welder, having the right shop equipment to support your larger tool and material requirements is more than nice to have. Auto mechanics are in the same boat, and key storage solutions are necessary to support even the most basic workflow essentials. Whether you're a solo mechanic or part of a team working in your home setup, there are plenty of brands and tools you'll love to have on hand. But workplace additions like the Husky Modular Tool Storage Workbench Cabinet undeniably help make things run smoothly.\nThis tool storage and workbench solution combines two essential functionality areas into one accessory tool. The worktop measures 52 inches by 20 inches, providing a sizeable benchtop area to support basic tool storage requirements and coverage to support part assembly and other work. This is part of a modular system that can be customized with additional inclusions and offers integrated power outlets and USB ports within the drawers to support charging needs without your wires becoming an unruly tangle in the space you're trying to use to work on other jobs. The cabinet is set on top of 5x2-inch casters and includes a large push handle to allow for increased mobility. It's built with an all welded 21 gauge steel frame with ten drawers that each support up to 100 pounds, and the workbench itself is rated for a 1,500-pound total weight capacity.\nMilwaukee \u00bc-Inch, 3/8-Inch, and \u00bd-Inch Drive SAE/Metric Ratchet and Socket Set Combo Kit\nThe mechanic's tool set is a ubiquitous sight in any home or professional auto garage. There's a mechanic tool set for every budget, and individual tools and kits from a bevy of brands that can improve a mechanic's capabilities while augmenting existing kit setups. A great option that newer mechanics might consider is the Milwaukee \u00bc-Inch, 3/8-Inch, and \u00bd-Inch Drive SAE/Metric Ratchet and Socket Set Combo Kit. The 153-piece set features three different cases that house a ratchet handle in each of the three primary drive sizes. Rounding things out, each case offers a comprehensive selection of both SAE and metric sockets, extension bars, and other adaptability accessories. As a starter kit, this hand tool solution from Milwaukee provides elite coverage across a huge spectrum of fastening and part removal needs.\nThe combo kit isn't just a great option for newer mechanics, however. With comprehensive coverage across both standard and deep-well sockets, seasoned auto repairers often consider a kit like this a supplement. Rounded sockets or lost parts can tank workshop productivity. There's also a need to add redundancy into the mix in order to speed up processes by keeping certain socket sets stored in a drawer and others as part of a mobile tool kit or onboard the storage compartments in a rolling creeper seat or elsewhere. Listed at $449 from Home Depot, this kit from a much-loved tool brand offers solid durability and great total coverage.\nSkyshalo Mechanics Stool Rolling Creeper Seat with Slide Out Tool Trays and Drawer\nAuto mechanics will be intimately familiar with the rolling creeper. This tool enables workers to access low areas with greater ease when performing various repairs or part replacements. Creepers come in two main varieties: a lay-down undercar option and a seated solution. The Skyshalo Mechanics Stool Rolling Creeper Seat is a seated solution. It features 4-inch rubber casters for a smooth rolling operation across the shop floor. Two of them lock and two do not to support free movement, static immobility, or a more subtle, one-locked position shifting option when engaging work in a particular area. The seat also features a thick sponge cushion complete with curved geometry for enhanced comfort.\nThe space underneath this creeper seat is really what makes it valuable to the home mechanic. It's built with a slot-in design and a pair of partition storage trays that fit on either end of the seat. In the middle, there's a large storage drawer that pulls out to reveal even more space for tools or components. All of this storage underneath the seat is easy to access as you work through just about any task, and the trays are designed specifically to support all manner of tool and part storage so that you won't have to press pause in the middle of your repair job to go hunting for a fastener or even something like a can of WD-40.\nStanley 1,000 Lumens Portable Work Bench Shop Light with Power Strip\nWork lights are a crucial tool in any mechanic's arsenal. The workplace has a natural tendency to be dimly lit. Mechanics largely work inside and even when opening up the garage doors or exploring the engine compartment in a room full of windows, the workpiece itself can easily block direct illumination coming from natural sources or overhead lights. The reality for most mechanics is that specific, additional lighting elements are consistently required when performing even simple repairs on a project vehicle. The best work lights for mechanics offer flexibility, major brightness, and other integrated features. The Stanley 1,000 Lumen Portable Work Bench Shop Light fits this mold very well.\nThis work light isn't one that delivers extreme portability, but it does offer a high degree of brightness and functional value when placed in a stationary working position. The compact frame also makes it mobile when necessary. Portability is on offer considering the tool's slight frame, although not to the same degree as some truly mobile solutions. The light features an integrated power strip that allows you to connect charging equipment or corded tools directly into the unit for use at the bench. It also offers storage space on either end of the illumination source for small hand tools you frequently use at that position. It's also adjustable with a backlit power switch to make use even easier."
