  "title": "Nothing Phone (3) Review: A Potent Handset With a Unique Design",
  "description": "The Nothing Phone (3) is the company's best handset yet, thanks to its beautiful screen, strong performance, capable cameras, and standout design.",
  "content": "The $799 Nothing Phone (3) is the company's most ambitious handset yet, stepping beyond midrange ambitions and into the flagship fight. The phone carries forward a design that is unmistakably Nothing, and has the company's best cameras, a brighter screen, a revised Glyph lighting system, and smooth everyday performance. We wish it had fast mmWave 5G support and more AI functionality baked in, but it's a remarkable effort from the company that should easily appeal to longtime fans or those seeking something off the beaten path. If you're looking for a more mainstream option, you can stick to the tried and true Editors' Choice-winning phones from Apple and Samsung, the iPhone 16 (starting at $799) and the Galaxy S25 (starting at $799.99), respectively, due to their refined hardware, excellent performance, top cameras, and wide compatibility with accessories for the same price.\n\nGlyph Matrix: Say Hello to Your Little Friend The Nothing Phone (3a) and (3a) Pro feature Nothing's smaller Glyph LED array in three zones, but Nothing rethought the Glyph and turned it into the Glyph Matrix, which uses 489 micro-LEDs arranged in a circular display. Although low-resolution, the Glyph Matrix displays text, such as the time, clearly. It can also create bright visualizations when playing back voice recordings or listening to music. The new Glyph Button lets you cycle through several utilities called Glyph Toys, which include a clock, a spin-the-bottle game (yes, really), a battery indicator, and a stopwatch. Nothing says more Toys are coming in the future. These features work as advertised, and while they're not exactly indispensable, they make the phone stand out. If the Glyph isn't your cup of tea, you can disable it in Settings.\n\nEssential Key and Essential Space: Nothing's Take on Notes The Essential Key is glossy compared with the matte power button (Credit: Iyaz Akhtar) The Phone (3) features a dedicated button, the Essential Key, to interact with Nothing's Essential Space app. The key's finish is different from the power and volume buttons to help you distinguish it by feel alone. In practice, I accidentally tapped the key many times while missing the power button, but I eventually got used to it. Tapping the Essential key takes a screenshot, while tapping-and-holding initiates a voice recording, and double-tapping brings up the Essential Space app. The app serves as a hub for your screenshots and recordings. It also uses AI to identify items within the app and will transcribe voice recordings. The AI is intelligent enough to create to-do items based on your voice recordings, but you must manually organize your notes into collections. Digging into the app's settings, you can activate the Essential Recorder. This allows you to start recording audio by double-tapping the Essential Key while the phone's screen is off. The Glyph shows a waveform while a red square flashes to show it is recording. Tapping the Essential Key again while recording bookmarks the audio in that spot for easy reference later. The Essential Space app is helpful once you learn how to use it, but it doesn't sync to any cloud services, so it only exists on your phone. That could prove problematic if you come to rely on it. Hopefully, Nothing will add a way to automatically back up or export the content from the app in a future update.\n\nThe phone (3) is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 chip. The base model ships with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, while a second model offers 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage ($899). We tested the latter and compared it with the iPhone 16 (Apple A18 chip) and the Galaxy S25 (Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy). On Geekbench 6, which measures raw CPU power, the Phone (3) performs well with a single-core score of 2,208 and a multi-core score of 7,002. However, both the iPhone 16 (3,091 and 7,129) and Galaxy S25 (3,050 and 9,559) perform better. On the PCMark Work 3.0 test, which gauges how the phone handles general mobile tasks, the Phone (3) scored 13,435. This mark is well behind the Galaxy S25's 19,060. Note that this particular test does not run on Apple devices. To assess graphics performance, we use the GFXBench Aztec Ruins test. The Phone (3) pushed out 60 frames per second (fps), which matches the iPhone 16, but is must less than the Galaxy S25's output of 118fps. For real-world gaming ability, we test phones by playing the resource-intensive Genshin Impact. During a 20-minute gaming session at the highest graphics settings and at 60fps, the Phone (3) produced detailed and smoothly animated gameplay. I experienced no frame drops or slowdowns. The phone's rear panel became slightly warmer around the cameras while playing, but it remained comfortable to the touch.

Keep an eye on your inbox!\n\nFor connectivity, the phone supports 5G (sub-6GHz and C-band, but not mmWave), Bluetooth 6.0, NFC, and Wi-Fi 7. The device can hold two physical SIMs and includes one eSIM. On T-Mobile's network in New York City, the Phone (3) reached a maximum download of 378Mbps and a max upload speed of 22.5Mbps. For comparison, a Google Pixel 9 Pro reached 556Mbps down and 75.5Mbps up on the same network and in the same location, though it supports mmWave. When connected to a Wi-Fi 6 access point, the Phone (3) reached peak speeds of 294Mbps down and 22.6Mbps up. The Pixel 9 Pro hit 382Mbps down and 22.1Mbps up. When I took the phones to the limits of my Wi-Fi network, the Nothing Phone (3) didn't do so well. It reached 25.9Mbps down and 4.94Mbps up (a below-average result), while the Pixel 9 Pro reached 335Mbps down and 22.5Mbps up (an unusually high result).\n\nSoftware: Distinct Look (If You Want It) The Phone (3) runs Android 15 with Nothing OS 3.5 atop it. The phone will receive five years of Android updates and seven years of security patches. For comparison, Apple typically offers its iPhones five years of support, while Samsung backs the Galaxy S25 with seven years of OS and security updates. Nothing OS includes the company's simplified iconography, dot-matrix-like widgets, and the Essential Space app. If Nothing's default monochromatic theme isn't for you, you can choose the traditional colorful look. Either way, the experience should be familiar to any Android user. You won't find any real AI on board the Nothing Phone (3). This is one area where the company is far behind. While you can download Google Gemini and take advantage of some of the AI tricks in the Google Photos app, Nothing hasn't created its own set of AI tools for the Phone (3).",
