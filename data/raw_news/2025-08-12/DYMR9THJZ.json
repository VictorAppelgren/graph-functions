  "title": "A judge blocks FEMA from repurposing disaster mitigation funding.",
  "description": "A federal judge in Massachusetts said the Trump administration\u2019s move to redirect $4 billion left states exposed to damage from natural disasters.",
  "content": "Damaged homes after a tornado tore through Cave City, Ark., in March. Houston Cofield for The New York Times A federal judge in Massachusetts blocked the Trump administration on Tuesday from ending a multibillion-dollar disaster mitigation program, prohibiting funding for the program from being diverted and spent elsewhere until the court can rule on the case\u2019s merits. Judge Richard G. Stearns wrote that a plan to suspend the program, which helps states build safe rooms and shelters and fund flood reduction and wildfire management, among many other mitigation projects, left the states exposed to considerable disaster risk. A coalition of 20 Democratic-led states had sued in response to announcements in April by the Federal Emergency Management Agency that it would repurpose funds previously available to states under the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program. The announcements informed states to prepare to do without more than $4 billion that Congress had set aside for grants, asserting without citing evidence that the program had not \u201cincreased the level of hazard mitigation as much as desired.\u201d Since 2000, Congress has allocated billions of dollars in funding to help states prepare for large-scale disasters. According to the states\u2019 complaint, by conservative estimates, every dollar spent on disaster mitigation projects \u201csaves an average of $6 in post-disaster costs.\u201d The program, known as BRIC, was launched in 2020 during President Trump\u2019s first term, replacing the pre-disaster mitigation program that preceded it. FEMA approved around $4.5 billion in grants for nearly 2,000 projects since then, much of it allocated for coastal storm preparedness and other projects connected to threats exacerbated by climate change. But in April, the agency moved to end the program, describing it as \u201cwasteful\u201d and \u201cmore concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters.\u201d Critics of the Trump administration called the move an ideologically driven effort to shutter federal programs that acknowledge climate change. \u201cThe BRIC program is designed to protect against natural disasters and save lives,\u201d Judge Stearns wrote. \u201cThe potential hardship to the Government, in contrast, is minimal.\u201d In court filings in July, the government denied that it had actually terminated the program or stopped approving grants. But Judge Stearns concluded that the program was clearly in jeopardy, pointing to a June report by FEMA showing that the remaining $4 billion in the BRIC account had been transferred to another pool of general disaster relief funding. \u201cAlthough the Government equivocates about whether it has, in fact, ended the BRIC program, the States\u2019 evidence of steps taken by FEMA to implement the announced termination portend the conclusion that a determination has in fact been made and that FEMA is inching towards a fait accompli,\u201d Judge Stearns wrote. He nonetheless noted that the agency did not appear to have canceled any grants or denied any requests for extensions so far, and described his decision in granting an injunction as designed to maintain the status quo for now. His order on Wednesday blocked the government from spending the funds allocated to BRIC for \u201cnon-BRIC purposes\u201d for the duration of the lawsuit. Still, he stressed that the government remained free to ask that the court release funds for actual disaster relief in the event of an emergency.\n\nThe decision by Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate the \u201cRussia Hoax\u201d comes at a time of increasing pressure on the Trump administration to produce more information about the F.B.I.\u2019s files on Jeffrey Epstein. Eric Lee for The New York Times President Trump has urged and browbeaten supporters to shift their obsession from the Jeffrey Epstein files to the investigation and potential prosecution of Democratic officials he accuses of persecuting him, a cardinal grievance that bonds him to his base. The Justice Department under Mr. Trump, reeling from the angry backlash over its handling of the Epstein case, is now taking its most concrete \u2014 if still murky \u2014 investigative steps against Trump targets, starting with officials he blames for what he sees as the plot against him: the investigation of his 2016 campaign\u2019s connections to Russia. Attorney General Pam Bondi this week authorized prosecutors to investigate the inquiry the president calls the \u201cRussia hoax\u201d and present a case to a grand jury in South Florida if the evidence warrants it, according to people briefed on the move who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing investigations. Details are scant, including whether prosecutors have taken action. But Trump appointees are reluctant to present evidence to a grand jury in the District of Columbia where key decisions in the Russia investigation were made nearly a decade ago. They believe it would be nearly impossible to find sympathetic jurors in a courthouse overseen by a federal judge, James E. Boasberg, whom the Trump team regards as an enemy. Fox News on Monday reported that Ms. Bondi had made the order, which comes after a referral from Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence. A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The decision to authorize a grand jury investigation, which could include subpoenas, into the statements and testimony by government officials surrounding the 2016 election suggests the Trump administration has begun turning its rhetoric of revenge into action. Still, there are a number of legal and practical hurdles that any such inquiry would have to overcome, chief among them the statute of limitations that would seemingly bar criminal charges based on conduct that is more than five years old. Such concerns, however significant, have been swept aside, at least for now, by the eagerness to appease an impatient president demanding to use the vast powers of federal law enforcement to exact vengeance \u2014 and the political imperative of making the Epstein fiasco disappear. Even in the absence of a legal success, such as an indictment or conviction, the effort itself accomplishes political objectives in a department that considers investigations largely intended to name and shame a legitimate use of its authority. Many Trump advisers and allies also view the Russia investigation as a gross abuse of power, while some were personally affected by the inquiry and forced to hire lawyers to defend themselves. Mr. Trump has privately carped about the slow pace of Justice Department action to his political enemies, according to people in his orbit, and made it unmistakably known what he wanted. \u201cScum\u201d was how Mr. Trump described those who investigated him during a speech in the department\u2019s Great Hall in March, as Ms. Bondi and Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, looked on. Mr. Trump described those who investigated him as \u201cscum\u201d during a speech in the Department of Justice\u2019s Great Hall in March. Mr. Trump has repeatedly urged his backers to drop a fierce pressure campaign to release undisclosed Epstein files and rally under the \u201cweaponization\u201d banner. On Tuesday, he told CNBC that he had \u201cnothing\u201d to do with Ms. Bondi\u2019s order \u2014 then celebrated the move to investigate Obama administration national security officials, saying \u201cthey deserve it.\u201d The decision also comes as the Trump administration faces increasing pressure to produce more information about the F.B.I.\u2019s files on Mr. Epstein, the financier who was awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges before he hanged himself in a jail cell in 2019. Last month, Mr. Blanche, a former Trump defense lawyer, interviewed Ghislaine Maxwell, Mr. Epstein\u2019s convicted co-conspirator. Law enforcement officials have privately talked about releasing at least some of the information she provided, although they are still discussing the extent of what they will disclose, according to several people familiar with the conversations. The emergence of the grand jury inquiry was unusual in several ways \u2014 not least, because its existence was revealed to right-leaning media outlets like Fox News before any actual investigative steps had apparently been taken. Moreover, it remains unclear who the grand jury might investigate and for what, if any, crimes. Thus far, the Justice Department has moved more slowly to scrutinize Biden-era officials who participated in the two unsuccessful criminal prosecutions of Mr. Trump. Last week, an obscure agency that scrutinizes potential misconduct by or against federal employees, the Office of Special Counsel, took a step in that direction, confirming it was investigating Jack Smith, the former federal prosecutor who oversaw the criminal cases against Mr. Trump. The agency is trying to determine if Mr. Smith may have violated the Hatch Act, which bars federal workers from using their government jobs to promote political candidates. It is unclear how that investigation could result in any substantive consequences for Mr. Smith, given that the most severe punishment allowed under the Hatch Act is dismissal, and Mr. Smith resigned his government position many months ago. It is not clear whether Mr. Trump, who is marking his first six months in office, would have pushed quite so forcefully for the department to act against his perceived foes if the Epstein case was not still smoldering political fire. But it has certainly added to the urgency, administration officials said. Politicians and influencers on the right flank of the Republican Party \u2014 who have demanded a full accounting of Mr. Epstein\u2019s interactions with wealthy and powerful friends \u2014 are equally if not more enthusiastic about deploying the Justice Department, F.B.I., and intelligence services to uncover what they claim to be a vast decade-long, Democratic-led conspiracy to destroy Mr. Trump. A few of Mr. Trump\u2019s key congressional allies and some of the most vocal members of his base have been beating the drums for arrests almost from the moment that the bureau and intelligence officials started releasing documents on the Russia investigation last month. On Monday, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, posted a message on social media with a \u201cscorecard\u201d showing that no one had been arrested yet for popular MAGA-world bugbears like the \u201cRussia Collusion Hoax,\u201d \u201cJan. 6\u201d and the \u201c2020 Election.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t talk about it if you aren\u2019t going to do it,\u201d Ms. Greene wrote. Among the most fervid Trump supporters calling for arrests are the rioters who were charged in connection with \u2014 and then granted clemency for \u2014 the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Many of them have demanded retribution against Mr. Trump\u2019s enemies, citing their own grievances as federally prosecuted defendants. \u201cDear God, has anyone been arrested yet?\u201d wrote one pardoned rioter, Benjamin Martin, who was initially sentenced to 13 months in prison for holding open a door at the Capitol so that others could spray chemicals at the police. Few of those calling for the investigation have been as maximalist as Mr. Trump himself. He recently wrote on social media that President Obama should be arrested as a traitor for treason. In late July, Ms. Gabbard blindsided Ms. Bondi by referring the investigation of the Russian investigation to the Justice Department, claiming a cache of documents she released proved Obama administration officials engaged in a \u201ctreasonous conspiracy.\u201d In response, Ms. Bondi announced the creation of a multiagency \u201cstrike force\u201d to investigate the charges. Her subsequent grand jury order was made as part of that process, according to an official briefed on the move. The claims by Trump supporters that Obama-era officials engaged in a far-reaching conspiracy to undermine his 2016 campaign have already been exhaustively investigated by a special counsel, John Durham, with little to show for it. Mr. Durham filed two criminal indictments based on that investigation, one against a private practice lawyer on charges of lying to the F.B.I., and another against a Russia analyst for essentially the same offense. Each case ended in acquittals. A new investigation would face a potentially steeper challenge, relying on the years-old statements and the recollection of senior intelligence and law enforcement officials about an election held nearly nine years ago. But not every investigation of Mr. Trump\u2019s perceived enemies has led to meaningful consequences. In November 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions tapped a U.S. attorney in Utah to review a number of issues related to Hillary Clinton, as well as the 2016 election. That effort lasted about two years before quietly ending with no substantive action or public findings.\n\nMembers of ICE arresting a man from Mexico in Miami Beach, Fla., in May. On Tuesday morning, Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced in an internal email that it would offer cash bonuses to agents for deporting people quickly, an incentive meant to motivate the staff to speed up President Trump\u2019s mass deportation campaign. Less than four hours later, the agency abruptly canceled what was supposed to be a 30-day pilot program. \u201cPLEASE DISREGARD,\u201d Liana J. Castano, an official in ICE\u2019s field operations division, said in a follow-up email to agency offices around the country. Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, said the program had not been enacted, adding that \u201cno such policy is in effect or has ever been in effect.\u201d The email canceling the program was sent shortly after The New York Times inquired about its existence. But the short-lived effort underscored the mounting pressure on ICE to meet Mr. Trump\u2019s aggressive deportation targets. The agency has offered signing bonuses of up to $50,000, promised to hire as many as 10,000 agents and initiated a vigorous recruiting push on social media. The Trump administration is seeking to transform ICE, infusing it with an enthusiasm for the president\u2019s project of carrying out deportations on an unprecedented scale. Under Mr. Trump\u2019s signature domestic policy bill, which he signed into law early last month, ICE\u2019s annual budget will grow from about $8 billion to roughly $28 billion, making it the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the federal government. Stephen Miller, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s top advisers and the architect of his immigration policy, has promoted ICE\u2019s hiring drive in ideological terms. \u201cWant to mass deport illegals from Los Angeles?\u201d he wrote on social media last week. \u201cJOIN.ICE.GOV today and get a 50K signing/retention bonus. Make your family proud and be the hero America needs.\u201d Last week, the agency said it had issued more than 1,000 tentative job offers. The bonus program that ended on Tuesday almost as quickly as it began had been described as a 30-day pilot, according to documents reviewed by The Times. Under its terms, ICE would hand out $200 bonuses for each immigrant deported within seven days of being arrested and $100 for those deported within two weeks, according to an initial memo signed by Ms. Castano that was sent to the directors and deputy directors of ICE\u2019s field offices across the country. It was meant to motivate officers to reduce a backlog of people awaiting deportation, \u201creducing overall removal costs and decreasing strain\u201d on the agency\u2019s detention resources, the memo stated. To \u201cmaximize\u201d their bonuses, the memo instructed ICE agents to deport eligible immigrants through a fast-track process known as expedited removal, which allows immigrants without legal status to be deported without court proceedings. It also said that agents could offer detainees the option of leaving the country voluntarily. Ms. Castano did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Efforts to speed the pace of deportations \u2014 like the bonus program \u2014 could endanger the due process rights of immigrants by encouraging ICE agents to cut corners, immigration experts and former government officials said. \u201cThat is so ungodly unethical,\u201d said Scott Shuchart, a former senior homeland security official. \u201cYou can\u2019t incentivize government agents to short circuit people\u2019s procedural rights. Would you pay a bonus to judges for wrapping up trials faster?\u201d Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said the incident appeared to reflect how quickly ICE was moving to meet Mr. Trump\u2019s goals. \u201cThey\u2019re willing to try so many different things to see what sticks,\u201d she said. ICE has already sped up deportations, according to a New York Times analysis of ICE data obtained via the Deportation Data Project. The share of people booked into ICE detention who were deported within 14 days increased to 30 percent in May, from 21 percent in January, the analysis showed. And the number of deportations by ICE reached a new high in July, averaging almost 1,300 daily removals in the two weeks ending July 26. Removals averaged fewer than 800 per day in the last year of the Biden administration.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health headquarters in Bethesda, Md. Michael A. McCoy for The New York Times The Trump administration broke the law when it terminated about 1,800 grants and interrupted funding for the National Institutes of Health, a federal watchdog said on Tuesday. It was the fifth time that the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan legislative agency, faulted President Trump and his top aides for rearranging the budget in defiance of Congress. From February to June, investigators estimated, the N.I.H. awarded $8 billion less for research and other grants than it had a year earlier. The findings underscored the real stakes in the growing clash between the Trump administration and Congress over the power of the purse. Since returning to office, Mr. Trump has adopted an expansive view of his authority to recalibrate the federal ledger as he sees fit, even though the Constitution gives lawmakers the power to tax and spend. In recent weeks, Democrats and Republicans alike had expressed discomfort over the ways in which Mr. Trump\u2019s budgetary maneuvers may have affected vital public health research into cancer and other diseases. Some in Congress have also objected to the severe budget cuts that the president has proposed for the N.I.H. and other major health and research agencies next year. The Trump administration on Tuesday defended some of its actions, releasing a letter that described elements of the funding delay as part of the \u201ctransition\u201d between presidents. Officials did not respond on Tuesday to more detailed questions about canceled grants. Some congressional lawmakers have also pressed the administration about more recent interruptions to N.I.H. funds. Russell T. Vought, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, previously acknowledged that the administration had conducted a \u201creview\u201d into N.I.H. spending. He also faulted the health agency for what he described as years of \u201cwaste\u201d while claiming it had been \u201cweaponized against the American people.\u201d \u201cWe have an agency that needs dramatic overhaul,\u201d Mr. Vought added in an interview with CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d in July. \u201cThankfully, we have a great new head of it, but we\u2019re going to have to go line by line to make sure the N.I.H. is funded properly.\u201d The trouble began soon after Mr. Trump took office when he signed a slew of executive orders meant to halt federal spending on diversity, equity and inclusion. The cuts deeply affected health programs, including the N.I.H., the largest source of biomedical funding in the United States, which canceled more than 1,800 grants between February and June, the Government Accountability Office found. For about two months, the N.I.H. also ceased publishing notices for grant reviews. That interrupted a key step in the federal award process, which delayed the delivery of public health funds to hospitals, laboratories, universities and other research organizations, according to congressional investigators. In a letter shared with The New York Times, officials at the Department of Health and Human Services told the watchdog that they had \u201cmoved rapidly to reschedule and hold meetings impacted by the short pause, and to process grant applications.\u201d But ethics officials concluded on Tuesday that the Trump administration had violated federal law, which prohibits the president from withholding authorized money, a practice known as impoundment. The office said it was also \u201caware\u201d of more recent reports that White House officials had asked the health agency to \u201cpause the issuing of grants, research contracts and training,\u201d and \u201clater reversed\u201d that decision. But the watchdog said it could not confirm that money had resumed flowing, as even some Republican lawmakers had requested in recent days. Top Democratic lawmakers immediately urged the White House to cease interrupting the flow of money at the N.I.H. and other research agencies, warning that the administration was threatening to undermine work on new cures and emerging diseases. \u201cCutting off investments Congress has made into research that saves millions of lives is as backward and as inexcusable as it gets,\u201d said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. The accountability office has opened 40 similar investigations to determine if the Trump administration has impounded funds, The Times previously reported. Earlier, the watchdog concluded that administration officials had wrongly interrupted approved money for programs ranging from early childhood education to electric vehicle charging stations. The White House has strenuously denied those charges. It has also sharply attacked the accountability office, while signaling that the administration would cease cooperating with some of its investigations. The office has the power to sue to force the release of impounded funds, and recently has retained legal counsel in case it needs to take such rare action. But Gene Dodaro, the comptroller general in charge of the watchdog, previously said in an interview that filing lawsuits would be a last resort.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee issues subpoenas for the Epstein files. Several Republicans joined Democrats to force a House committee to issue a subpoena to the Justice Department for the Epstein files. Michael A. McCoy for The New York Times The House Oversight Committee issued a subpoena on Tuesday to the Justice Department for its files related to Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who died in federal prison awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges, and Ghislaine Maxwell, his longtime associate. The Republican-run committee also sent subpoenas to 10 former Democratic and Republican government officials it said it was seeking to depose in relation to Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking and other crimes. The move comes as the battle over the Epstein investigation and the Republican rift it ripped open continues to loom over the House during its five-week recess that Speaker Mike Johnson began a day earlier than scheduled. Representative James R. Comer of Kentucky, the committee\u2019s Republican chairman, requested that the documents be delivered by Aug. 19. He was required to issue the 11 subpoenas after Democrats forced a vote on the matter in a key House subcommittee last month. Should the Justice Department fail to meet that deadline, it could set up a high-profile clash between the Trump administration and Congress over an issue that has sharply divided Republicans and effectively paralyzed the House. A spokesman for the Justice Department said it had received the subpoena, but he declined to comment further. The Trump administration\u2019s decision to close its investigation into Mr. Epstein without releasing additional files, a reversal from previous promises, has widened a rift in the Republican Party. Many lawmakers now find themselves positioned between far-right constituents who are eager for the release of the files and President Trump, who after years of questioning the legitimacy of government institutions has urged his supporters to move on from the investigation. Democrats have seized on the disagreement. Their move to require Mr. Comer to issue a subpoena was one of several efforts by lawmakers to force Republicans to record politically tricky votes on the matter. \u201cToday was an important step forward in our fight for transparency regarding the Epstein files and our dedication to seeking justice for the victims,\u201d Representatives Robert Garcia of California and Summer Lee of Pennsylvania, the Democrats who led the push for the subpoena, said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cNow, we must continue putting pressure on the Department of Justice until we actually receive every document.\u201d Three Republicans broke from Mr. Trump to back the subpoena for the Epstein files. But they also expanded the request to include subpoenas for prominent figures who held their positions during the lengthy investigation into Mr. Epstein and have frequently been targets of the president. They included former President Bill Clinton, who was acquainted with Mr. Epstein, and Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state who ran for president against Mr. Trump in 2016. The Oversight Committee also issued subpoenas to Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election, and James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director. Both men have been frequent targets of Mr. Trump\u2019s broadsides. The committee also sent subpoenas to former attorneys general who were overseeing the Justice Department when it was grappling with legal matters related to Mr. Epstein. The officials, who served under Democratic and Republican presidents: Merrick B. Garland, who was President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s attorney general; William P. Barr and Jeff Sessions, who were both appointed by Mr. Trump during his first term; Loretta Lynch and Eric H. Holder Jr., who were appointed by President Barack Obama; and Alberto R. Gonzales, who served under President George W. Bush.\n\nTrump says Treasury\u2019s Bessent rules out replacing Powell as the Fed chair. President Trump said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent doesn\u2019t want to run the Federal Reserve. President Trump said on Tuesday that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has told him he does not want to be Federal Reserve chair, taking him off the shortlist of contenders to replace Jerome Powell. Mr. Trump said that has narrowed his list of replacements to four people, a group that includes a former Fed governor, Kevin Warsh, and the director of the White House National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett. Mr. Trump said Mr. Bessent had told him as recently as Monday that he did not want the job. \u201cI love Scott, but he wants to stay where he is,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview with CNBC. \u201cI\u2019ll take him off, because I asked him just last night, \u2018Is this something you want?\u2019 \u2018Nope, I want to stay where I am.\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump has relentlessly criticized Mr. Powell for not lowering interest rates according to the president\u2019s demands, but he has repeatedly backed away from trying to remove him before his term as chair expires in May 2026. Pressed on the names of other candidates who might serve as a replacement, Mr. Trump confirmed only that Mr. Warsh and Mr. Hassett were leading contenders. \u201cI think the two Kevins are doing well,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd I have two other people who are doing well.\u201d His caution may be a reflection of his persistent unhappiness with Mr. Powell, whom he nominated to lead the Federal Reserve in 2017. \u201cSometimes they\u2019re all very good until you put \u2019em in there, and then they don\u2019t do so good,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump said he would make a decision on a replacement for Mr. Powell \u201csoon.\u201d One option, he said, was to initially place his choice on the Federal Reserve Board as a replacement for Adriana D. Kugler, who announced suddenly that she would step down this week from her position as a governor. Her term was set to expire in January, but her early resignation gives Mr. Trump an opportunity to more quickly appoint someone who could eventually replace Mr. Powell as chair.\n\nTrump airs his personal financial grievances ahead of a \u2018debanking\u2019 crackdown. President Trump at the White House last week. President Trump said on Tuesday that he was a victim of discrimination by two of the nation\u2019s largest banks, and suggested that his personal experience was fueling his animus with Wall Street. Mr. Trump, in an interview on CNBC, said both JPMorgan Chase \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest bank \u2014 and Bank of America refused to accept more than $1 billion in deposits from the Trump Organization after his first term. He said he had made personal appeals to the chief executives of both banks but had been rejected. \u201cThe banks discriminated against me very badly,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks couldn\u2019t immediately be confirmed. A JPMorgan spokesman did not address Mr. Trump\u2019s charge, instead sending a statement saying the bank would not comment on clients. Bank of America declined to comment. The Trump Organization earlier sued Capital One for closing its accounts in the wake of the Jan 6., 2021, attack on the Capitol. The president\u2019s commentary on Tuesday carries significant weight on Wall Street because his administration has been preparing a crackdown, in the form of an executive order and other proposed regulatory changes, on so-called debanking practices. Many right-leaning organizations have claimed that the financial system has locked them out because of their political positions. Bank executives and lobbying groups have broadly pushed back against that assertion, although they have said that beginning with the Obama administration \u2014 and during Mr. Trump\u2019s first term \u2014 regulators required them to apply close scrutiny to certain categories of deposits, including payday lenders and gun-related businesses. Mr. Trump, asked during the CNBC interview if he would sign an executive order on debanking, did not explicitly comment on his plans. Rather, he responded by describing his company\u2019s experience with Chase and Bank of America. He said that after his first term, the Trump Organization was given 20 days to withdraw more than $1 billion from Chase. He said he had appealed directly to JPMorgan\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon. \u201cYou could ask him,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s not going to admit it.\u201d Asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s statement, the JPMorgan spokesman said that as a rule the bank did not close accounts for political reasons. After his Chase accounts were closed, Mr. Trump said, he tried Bank of America. That bank\u2019s chief executive, Brian Moynihan, \u201cwas kissing my ass when I was president,\u201d but wouldn\u2019t accept the deposits after his first term ended, Mr. Trump said. Eventually, the Trump Organization spread its money across a number of smaller banks, Mr. Trump said. \u201c$10 million here, $10 million there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s lucky I even had them. They were doing me a favor.\u201d\n\nRwanda agrees to accept 250 migrants as part of Trump\u2019s deportation plan. President Trump with Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe of Rwanda in the Oval Office in June. Pete Marovich for The New York Times Rwanda has agreed to accept 250 deportees from the United States, a Rwandan government spokeswoman said on Tuesday, making the east African nation the latest country to work with the Trump administration as it seeks to expel tens of thousands of migrants in American custody. \u201cRwanda has agreed with the United States to accept up to 250 migrants, in part because nearly every Rwandan family has experienced the hardships of displacement,\u201d said the government spokesman, Yolande Makolo. Rwanda isn\u2019t the only African nation to strike a deal with the United States to accept deportees. In July, the U.S. Supreme Court approved the deportation of eight men to South Sudan. The kingdom of Eswatini also accepted five deportees from the United States that same month, though it soon announced plans to repatriate them to their home countries. Unlike Eswatini, Rwanda said it planned to integrate the deportees. They will be resettled and provided with job training, health care and places to stay in order to \u201cjump start their lives in Rwanda,\u201d Ms. Makolo said. She said Rwanda had approval power over which U.S. deportees to accept. In April, the Trump administration paid Rwanda $100,000 to take an Iraqi man, according to a U.S. cable. Talks about Rwanda\u2019s accepting more migrants began as early as May, Rwanda\u2019s foreign minister, Olivier Nduhungirehe, told Rwanda TV, the state broadcaster. The plan, reported earlier on Tuesday by Reuters, is reminiscent of a failed migrant deal struck between Britain and Rwanda. In 2022, Britain signed an agreement to resettle asylum seekers in Rwanda, and then spent years and hundreds of millions of pounds in futile attempts to make it happen. The British government said it would look into recovering the money, but Rwandan officials said they were not required to pay it back. Rwanda once also accepted deportees from Israel for years under a secretive 2013 deal. A British court found that Rwanda had quietly moved those asylum seekers out of the country. The small, landlocked country earned a reputation as an example of recovery and resilience after a 1994 genocide that left about 800,000 people dead. But more recently, critics have called its human rights record into question.",

  "summary": "A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the Trump administration from ending a multibillion-dollar disaster mitigation program, the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, by stopping it from being diverted and spent elsewhere until the court can rule on the case's merits. The program, which helps states build safe rooms and shelters, funds flood reduction and wildfire management, was launched in 2020 and was replaced by the pre-disaster mitigation program that preceded it. A coalition of 20 Democratic-led states had sued after FEMA announced it would repurpose funds previously available to states under the program. Critics of the Trump Administration have accused the move as an attempt to shut federal programs that acknowledge climate change. Judge Richard G. Stearns concluded that the program was clearly in jeopardy, noting that FEMA had transferred $4 billion from the BRIC account to another pool of general disaster relief funding. However, he also allowed the government to use funds allocated to BRIC for non-BRIC purposes for the duration of the lawsuit.",

      "text": "Transcript: Russell Vought on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" July 27, 2025\nThe following is the transcript of an interview with Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 27, 2025.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We begin today with the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, welcome to 'Face The Nation.'\nDIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET RUSSELL VOUGHT: Thanks for having me.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: There's so much to get to with you. Let's start on what's going on with the Federal Reserve. If you take the president at his word, he does not intend to fire the Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell- though he's still criticizing him. What is the President seeking in a successor when his term ends in May 2026?\nVOUGHT: Well, I think he's looking for a chairman that's not continually too late to the developments in the economic marketplace. And I think what we've seen with Chairman Powell, he was very late in the Biden administration to raise rates, to articulate the concern with regard to the Biden administration's spending. We all knew on the outside- even Larry Summers knew that we were going to have an issue with regard to inflation. And we saw, you know, recent, historical inflationary levels that we hadn't seen before. And now he is too late to lower inflation rates and so that is the kind of thing that we want to see in the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. And one of the reasons why is--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --More of a focus on inflation?\nVOUGHT: --want an ability to recognize the developments in the economic marketplace. In this case, we want to be able to see lower rates and to have an ability to get the economy going. And one of the things we saw with Powell is that one of the reasons he was so late was because he didn't understand that inflation is largely a monetary phenomenon. He kept saying that inflation was transitory. He didn't tackle the problem, and now he's, again, too late, and you marry that with fiscal mismanagement at the Fed. It's a huge problem that we're trying to raise the country's awareness level with.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But as you know, the Fed is structured in a way where he doesn't have unilateral control. There's a governing board. Others weigh in. You did work on Project 2025, and we went back and looked at what they said in there about the Fed. As people may know, that's a Heritage Foundation product that got a lot of scrutiny during the campaign. the chapter on the Fed called for Congress to overhaul the Fed's focus and powers. Is that what you're looking to do in 2026?\nVOUGHT: I don't even know what that chapter says. All I know, in terms of the President, the President has run on an agenda. He's been very clear about that. All that we're doing is- in this administration is running on- is implementing his agenda.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You don't want to overhaul the Fed?\nVOUGHT: We want an economic system that works for the American people, that includes the Fed. And the President has been very clear that all he's asking from the Fed is lower interest rates, because he thinks it's important. When you look at across the across the globe, and you have countries lowering rates, and yet we don't see that in this country, given all of the positive economic indicators that we're seeing. And then we have fiscal mismanagement at the Fed with regard to this building renovation that I'm sure you will ask me about. Those are the kinds of things that we want to see from the Fed. This is not part of an existential issue with regard to the Federal Reserve.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Fed is indicating that they are trending towards a rate cut, though probably not as soon as this week. We mentioned those renovations at the top of the program, but I do want to ask about spending, or lack thereof, that the Trump administration is trying to direct. The White House said they will actually release the remaining $5 billion in education, funds that had been withheld from public schools until recently. There were 10 Republican senators very worried about this, and came out and said, your claim that the money goes to radical left wing programs was wrong. What changed your mind? What made you release this money?\nVOUGHT: Well, we had been going through a programmatic review with these funds. These are programs that, as an administration, we don't support. We've called for the elimination of them in the President's budget for precisely the reasons of which they flow to often left wing organizations. Thankfully, the President came into office, put an executive order that said it can't- these funds can't go to these types of initiatives. I'll just give you one example, English language acquisition was flowing to the New York school public education system to go into illegal immigration advocacy organizations. Preschool development grants doesn't actually go to preschoolers. It goes to the curriculum for putting CRT into the school system for people as young- children as young as four years old.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, these senators said it goes to adult learners working to gain employment skills and after school programs.\nVOUGHT: And what we--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So you deemed it is necessary?\nVOUGHT: We believe that it's important to get the money out right now, but we have taken an extended time frame to be able to make sure it doesn't go to the types of things that we saw under the Biden administration.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Because, you know, Senator Lindsey Graham told the Washington Post, the administration is looking at considering clawbacks from the Department of Education. This, you know, rescissions process. Is that the plan? Are you seeking to claw back education funds in a rescissions package? And if so, when are you sending that up?\nVOUGHT: We may be, we're always looking at potential rescission options. This is an- this is a set of funding that we wanted to make sure it got out. We did our programmatic review. We wanted to make sure it got out before the school year, even though it's multi-year funding. This is not funding that would expire at the end of this year. We are looking to do rescissions package. We're always gauging the extent to which the Congress is willing to participate in that process, and we're- be looking at a lot of different options along those lines, but certainly have nothing to announce here today. But we're thrilled that we had the first rescissions package in decades, and we've got the process moving again.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So no rescissions package before September?\nVOUGHT: Not here to say that. We're looking at all of our options, we will look at it and assess where the Hill is, what are the particular funding opportunities that we have, but nothing that we're going to announce today,\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Because some of the funds that do expire in September have also been held up on the health front. Senator Katie Britt of Alabama, 13 other Republicans, came out with a letter saying that you've been slow in releasing funds for the National Institute of Health for research into cardiovascular disease, cancer. Are those funds going to be released?\nVOUGHT: Again, we're going through the same process with the NIH that we did with the education. I mean--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But there's a time cost here.\nVOUGHT: --$2 million for injecting dogs with cocaine that the NIH spent money on, $75,000 for Harvard to study blowing lizards off of trees with leaf blowers. That's the kind of waste that we've seen at the NIH. And that's not even getting to the extent to which the NIH was weaponized against the American people over the last several years, with regard to funding gain of function research that caused the pandemic. We have a- we have an agency that needs dramatic overhaul. Thankfully, we have a great new head of it, but we're going to have to go line by line to make sure the NIH is funded properly.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to release the cancer funding research? And the cardiovascular disease research funding?\nVOUGHT: We're going to continue- we're going to continue to go to the same process that we have gone through with regard to the Department of Education, that every one of these agencies--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Before September, that money will be released?\nVOUGHT: --and we will release that funding when we are done with that review.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Because, as you know, there's concern that you're withholding the money, hoping it just won't be spent. I mean, if you look at the White House budget, it does call for a 26% cut to HHS, $18 billion cut to NIH. Is this just a backdoor way to make those cuts happen?\nVOUGHT: Well, I don't want to speak to any specific program with regard to what we might do with regard to rescissions throughout the end of this fiscal year, but we certainly recognize that we have the ability and the executive tools to fund less than what Congress appropriated, and to use the tools that the Impoundment Control Act, a bill we're not- a law that we're not entirely thrilled with, gives us to- to send up rescissions towards the end of the fiscal year.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So just for our viewers, the Impoundment Control Act is the legal mechanism for the President to use to delay or avoid spending funds appropriated by Congress. You seem to want to have an argument, or Democrats think you want to have an argument, over the power of the purse and who holds it. Do you want that to go to the Supreme Court?\nVOUGHT: Well, look, for 200 years, presidents have the ability to spend less than the congressional appropriations. No one would ever dispute, and our founders didn't dispute that Congress has the ability to set the appropriation ceiling. But 200 years of presidents, up until the 1970s had the ability to spend less, if they could find efficiencies, or if they could find waste that an agency was doing.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- That sounds like a yes?--\nVOUGHT:-- We lost that ability in the 1970s. The president ran on restoring that funding authority to the presidency, and it's vital. If you look at when we started to lose control fiscally, it was right around the time of the 1970s.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, many senators, Republican senators, are very uncomfortable with the tactics that you are using. Senator Murkowski, Senator Collins, that chair of the appropriations committee that is really running this- this funding process. And Senator Collins said you're pushing the limits of what the executive can do without the consent of the- of the legislative branch. You need to work with her to get your budget through. And in fact, you need to also be able to get Democrats on board to get to that 60-vote threshold to pass any kind of government funding to avoid a government shutdown at the end of September.\nVOUGHT: I have a great relationship with Senator Collins. I appreciate the work she does. She is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, so obviously we're going to have differences of opinion as to the extent to which these tools should be used. I mean, she had concerns with the rescissions package. The rescissions package was a vote that Congress had to make these cuts permanent--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- Under- on a party line vote, she says, you want to go do these clawbacks. You do it through regular order, and you can put- you can put rescissions into an appropriations bill--\nVOUGHT: --But that was in fact, under regular order. That's the challenge, is the appropriators want to use all the rescissions, they want to put them in their bills, and then they want to spend higher on other programs. We act- we're $37 trillion in debt, Margaret. We actually need to reduce the deficit and have a dollar of cut go to $1 a deficit reduction. That's not what the appropriators want, and it's not news that the Trump administration is going to bring a paradigm shift to this town in terms of the business of spending.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You would acknowledge that you just added to the debt and to the deficit with this--\nVOUGHT: -- No, I would not acknowledge that. We reduced--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- The spending and tax bill that just passed?\nVOUGHT: Correct.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Where you lifted the debt ceiling.\nVOUGHT: The debt ceiling is an extension of the cap on what's needed to pay your previous bills. In terms of the bill itself, it is $400 billion in deficit reduction, $1.5 trillion in mandatory savings reforms, the biggest we've seen in history.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to make sure I get to the rest of this before I let you go here, because we're running out of time. You said, a few weeks ago, that the appropriations process needs to be less bipartisan. You only have 53 Republicans. You do need Democrats to get on board, here. Is saying something like that intended to undermine negotiations? Do you actually want a government shutdown?\nVOUGHT: No, of course not. We want to extend the funding at the end of this fiscal year. We understand, from a math perspective, we're going to need Democrats to do that--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what does less bipartisan mean?\nVOUGHT: Well, Margaret, the whole week, the Democrats were making the argument that if you pass the rescission bill, that you were undermining the bipartisan appropriations process. So, if Brian Schatz and every other appropriator is making that argument for a week--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --The chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee is who said that--\nVOUGHT: --you have to be able to respond and say, if you're going to call a rescissions package that you told us during the month of January and February that we should use to do less spending, if you're going to say that is undermining the bipartisan appropriations process, then maybe we should have a conversation about that. That is all it was meant to convey.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But, the alternative to this process is another continuing resolution, these stop-gap measures. Are you open to that, because that would lock in Biden-era funding? What is your alternative here? If you want a less bipartisan process, how do you solve for this? Because it sounds like you're laying the predicate for a shutdown.\nVOUGHT: We are not laying the predicate for a shutdown. We are laying the predicate for the fact that the only thing that has worked in this town- the bipartisan appropriations process is broken. It leads to omnibus bills. We want to prevent an omnibus bill, and all options are on the table to be able to do that.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: All options are on the table?\nVOUGHT: We need an appropriations process that functions. We're going to go through the process. We're going to work with them, and we're going to do everything we possibly can to use that process to have cheaper results for the American taxpayer.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm told we're out of time. Russell Vought, thank you for your time today."

      "text": "In his first months in office, President Trump has slashed funding for medical research, threatening a longstanding alliance between the federal government and universities that helped make the United States the world leader in medical science.\nSome changes have been starkly visible, but the country\u2019s medical grant-making machinery has also radically transformed outside the public eye, a New York Times analysis found. To understand the cuts, The Times trawled through detailed grant data from the National Institutes of Health, interviewed dozens of affected researchers and spoke to agency insiders who said that their government jobs have become unrecognizable.\nIn all, the N.I.H., the world\u2019s premier public funder of medical research, has ended 1,389 awards and delayed sending funding to more than 1,000 additional projects, The Times found. From the day Mr. Trump was inaugurated through April, the agency awarded $1.6 billion less compared with the same period last year, a reduction of one-fifth. (N.I.H. records for May are not yet comparable.)\nThe impacts extend far beyond studies on politically disfavored topics and Ivy League universities like Columbia or Harvard. The disruptions are affecting research on Alzheimer\u2019s, cancer and substance use, to name just a few, and studies at public institutions across the country, including in red states that backed Mr. Trump.\n\u201cI think people should know that research that they probably would support is being canceled,\u201d said Eden Tanner, a chemist at the University of Mississippi, who had been working with a colleague at Ohio State University to develop a novel approach for treating glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. Their grant had been awarded through a program designed to diversify the biomedical workforce; in April, they were notified that it was being terminated.\n\u201cI would like to cure brain cancer,\u201d Dr. Tanner said. \u201cI think that's not particularly controversial.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s campaign against medical research has been carried out without congressional approval, and the legality is unclear. Lawsuits have challenged the slashing or delaying of funding.\nFederal officials, who have accused the N.I.H. of wasteful spending, have attributed the cuts to changing scientific priorities.\nThe N.I.H. \u201cregularly examines its research portfolio\u201d to determine which projects are \u201cthe most meritorious,\u201d Andrew Nixon, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in an email. \u201cRegular reviews of ongoing activities will help us determine the most strategic balance of projects to support and the best way to manage them going forward, especially as we need to be responsive to the often-changing nature of biomedical scientific progress.\u201d\nScientists fear that the sweeping cuts could do long-term damage to U.S. scientific research, which has long driven medical and financial progress for the nation. \u201cThe country is going to be mourning the loss of this enterprise for decades,\u201d said Dr. Harold Varmus, a Nobel Prize-winning cancer biologist who served as the director of the N.I.H. during the Clinton administration and the director of the National Cancer Institute under President Barack Obama.\nN.I.H. grants, awarded in a competitive process, are typically paid out in installments. A researcher with a $1 million four-year grant, for instance, will get about $250,000 a year. Scientists can use this money to buy equipment and supplies and to pay the salaries of the researchers who work in their labs, among other things.\nFrom 2015 to 2024, there have been fewer than 20 terminations a year, on average, according to Jeremy M. Berg, former director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the N.I.H. from 2003 to 2011. They were generally for extenuating circumstances, such as illness or research misconduct.\nBut since late February, the government has publicly announced the cancellation of 1,389 N.I.H. awards. The agency scoured grants for key words and phrases like \u201ctransgender,\u201d \u201cmisinformation,\u201d \u201cvaccine hesitancy\u201d and \u201cequity,\u201d ending those focused on certain topics or populations, according to a current N.I.H. program officer, who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution.\nStudies focused on sexual and gender minority groups were among the first on the chopping block.\nKatherine Bogen, a doctoral student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, had been studying post-traumatic stress, alcohol use and intimate partner violence against bisexual women. The termination notice she received assailed studies \u201cbased primarily on artificial and nonscientific categories,\u201d calling such research \u201cantithetical to the scientific inquiry\u201d and alleging that it was \u201coften used to support unlawful discrimination on the basis of race and other protected characteristics, which harms the health of Americans.\u201d\nThe language was \u201cvery insulting,\u201d she said. \u201cI get this letter that tells me, \u2018Your research is not science. Not only is it ascientific, it\u2019s a useless drain on resources, and, in fact, your research could be used to discriminate against \u2018actual\u2019 Americans or \u2018regular\u2019 Americans,\u2019 or whatever they mean.\u201d\nThe cuts spread to grants on health equity and racial and ethnic groups. Affected projects sought to improve access to mental health care for Latino, low-income and rural communities; to reduce maternal mortality among Black women; and to prevent gun violence in Asian American communities.\nTsu-Yin Wu, a researcher at Eastern Michigan University who led the gun violence project, said that community leaders and study participants were \u201cgreatly disappointed\u201d by the grant cancellation. \u201cSome felt betrayed that their voices and engagement no longer matter.\u201d\nThe agency cut grants for research on vaccine hesitancy, disinformation and misinformation, including a Northeastern University study on cancer misinformation on social media.\nIt also axed research on Covid-19, including studies that could have helped the nation respond to many infectious disease threats. Among them: a grant to Emory University and Georgia State University, where researchers had developed three potential drugs that showed promise against many RNA-based viruses, including coronaviruses, Ebola, avian influenza and measles, said George Painter, a pharmacologist at Emory who was co-leading the research.\nIn April, the agency terminated, in part or in whole, more than 350 grants meant to support students, early-career scientists or researchers from groups underrepresented in science. Among these terminations were F31 diversity grants, awarded to Ph.D. students who were members of certain racial or ethnic groups, disabled or from disadvantaged backgrounds.\nAt the University of Pittsburgh, Luzmariel Medina-Sanchez, who was born and raised in Puerto Rico, and Sierra Wilson, a first-generation college student from Utah, both had their grants canceled. \u201cIt\u2019s not even about the work I\u2019m doing,\u201d said Ms. Wilson, who studies how liver cells respond to drug overdoses. \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s about me.\u201d\nMs. Medina-Sanchez, who studies how a microbe can help treat celiac disease, said she may leave science altogether. \u201cI feel racially targeted,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not going to be a professional in the field of science in America, because obviously my name is Luzmariel.\u201d\n(Ms. Wilson and Ms. Medina-Sanchez stressed that they spoke only for themselves and not for the university.)\nBesides outright canceling projects, N.I.H. failed to distribute annual payments to more than 1,000 grants, The Times found.\nThe delays have stifled research on drug discovery, blood vessel health and injury response. In some cases, scientists have cut staff, paused hiring, trimmed back supplies or delayed experiments. Health officials have not explained which projects have been held up, why or for how long.\nThe Times compiled a list of the delayed grants by searching N.I.H. databases as of June 2 for ones that were funded in 2024 and expected to last beyond 2025, but have not gotten disbursements on schedule.\nIn the past, annual renewals were routine. Scientists submitted progress reports; the N.I.H. reviewed them and usually continued funding them, occasionally with a week or two of delays. But longer delays have become much more common since Mr. Trump took office.\nJoshua Kritzer, a professor of chemistry at Tufts University, investigates the basic science behind potential drug candidates, laying the groundwork for future medications. Most of his lab work is supported by a five-year N.I.H. grant that received $1.4 million over the past two years. But since February, he had been waiting for the third year of expected funding to come in. He slashed purchases of essential supplies and contemplated laying off crucial researchers on his team.\nOn Tuesday, Kritzer finally received word that his funding had been released, several days after The Times asked federal officials about his and other delayed awards.\n\u201cEvery week that\u2019s delayed, it\u2019s easily probably three to four weeks to get that research back to where it was,\u201d said Dr. Kritzer, who noted that he was speaking for himself and not for his institution.\nMr. Nixon, the Department of Health spokesman, said that the agency would not discuss deliberations about specific awards but encouraged grant recipients to \u201cspeak with the designated N.I.H. officials on their award notice when questions arise.\u201d\nIn some cases, delays have lasted so long that scientists wondered whether their grants were subject to a \u201cshadow termination.\u201d\nThe delays stem in part from additional screening for whether the grants align with Trump administration priorities, N.I.H. officials said. Other renewals have been delayed as overstretched N.I.H. staff members work through backlogs in funding. And political appointees are now vetting some projects, too, slowing the process further.\nN.I.H. officials said they feared being fired if they processed a grant renewal that the administration disfavored.\nIn early May, Jon Lorsch, a longtime N.I.H. institute director who was recently promoted to acting deputy director of the agency\u2019s external funding arm, emailed staff members denouncing the renewal of grants \u201cthat focused on topics that are not supported under N.I.H./H.H.S.'s priorities,\u201d according to a copy of the email seen by The Times.\n\u201cThe consequences of approving an award that should not have been approved could be very serious,\u201d he wrote.\nBut Courtney Griffin, who leads a lab at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation and studies blood vessel development and disease, including complications due to diabetes, expressed confusion as to why her expected funding is not coming through. She and her colleagues were making contingency plans and looking for other sources of funding.\n\u201cIt\u2019s, ironically, a really inefficient use of people\u2019s time to be in this guessing game,\u201d she said, adding that the time could be better spent on biomedical research.\nMonths-long delays are also affecting new grants that were being vetted when the Trump administration cracked down on grant reviews.\nA number of major Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers, some of which have operated for decades, have waited months for the Trump administration to decide whether to award them fresh five-year grants. The funding gaps have set back ongoing studies and curtailed efforts to take images of patients' brains, though the N.I.H. has recently told some centers that they would soon receive funding.\n\u201cThese centers have become a safety valve for people who can\u2019t get a neurology appointment at a private center,\u201d said Dr. Ann Cohen, a co-director of the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer\u2019s center. Now, she said, things have changed. \u201cThere are fewer clinic appointments, fewer opportunities for these individuals to get brain imaging.\u201d\nThe N.I.H. has also said that it will no longer fund projects in which U.S. researchers distribute some of their money to international partners, throwing the future of many global health projects into question and creating funding delays for ongoing research.\nBeyond the disruption of individual projects, other proposed changes could undermine scientific research across the board, experts said. One would sharply curb funding for indirect research costs, such as building maintenance and administrative staff. And then there is Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to slash the N.I.H.\u2019s total budget by about $18 billion, a cut of almost 40 percent.\nA budget cut of that scale would be \u201ctruly draconian,\u201d said Dr. Varmus, the former N.I.H. director, who said he hoped Congress would not approve such a sharp reduction. It could leave the agency without enough money to fund promising new work, drive some scientists overseas and prompt some up-and-coming researchers to leave science altogether, he said. \u201cYou can completely destroy the system in just a couple of years,\u201d Dr. Varmus said."

      "text": "Get PolitiFact in your inbox.\nDoes Trump\u2019s new law make ICE the largest federal law enforcement agency?\nIf Your Time is short\n-\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s signature law includes about $75 billion for ICE over four years, including $45 billion for new immigration detention beds and $30 billion to hire 10,000 ICE employees, upgrade facilities and more.\n-\nICE becomes the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency under Trump\u2019s law compared with the FBI and DEA\u2019s existing budgets. But base budgets for all three agencies could change.\n-\nICE still trails the FBI in terms of overall staffing, but ICE\u2019s number of staff with arrest authority could surpass the FBI in coming years, depending on the breakdown of its new 10,000 hires.\nAs news of immigration raids permeate Americans\u2019 social media feeds, news broadcasts and neighborhood meetings, critics of President Donald Trump\u2019s tactics are warning his federal immigration force is gaining unprecedented strength.\nTrump\u2019s tax and spending law awards U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency charged with detaining and deporting people in the U.S. illegally, billions of dollars over the next four years.\n\"ICE will now become the country\u2019s largest federal law enforcement agency, bigger than the FBI, bigger than the DEA,\" former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau said on the July 8 Pod Save America podcast he co-hosts.\nOther left leaning groups and people have made similar statements, including Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU school of law and Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, an immigrant advocacy group.\nThe new law clearly includes an enormous increase in spending for ICE, but does it make ICE the \"largest\" federal law enforcement agency? Favreau didn\u2019t explain his metric for \"largest\" on the show, but he mentioned that the new law includes money to hire 10,000 ICE employees and build immigration detention beds.\nSign up for PolitiFact texts\nWe examined how ICE compares with the FBI and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency in terms of funding and staffing. Favreau is right about the DEA. As to the FBI, we found that Favreau\u2019s statement tracks based on some calculations about spending in the new law and ICE\u2019s likely annual budget. But it is less certain when comparing ICE and FBI staffing numbers.\nHere\u2019s a wrinkle in these comparisons: We don\u2019t yet know the future years\u2019 annual base budget for ICE or the FBI. Congress will set the fiscal 2026 base budgets by Sept. 30.\nHow ICE compares to the FBI in size is significant because it shows how federal officials are prioritizing the nation\u2019s enforcement needs. The FBI investigates a broad range of crimes including terrorism, cyber crimes, violent and white collar crime and although some of those offenders could be immigrants, it includes a lot of crime committed by U.S. citizens.\nSeveral emails to Crooked Media, home of Pod Save America, did not get a response.\nICE\u2019s new funding makes its overall budget appear larger that FBI\u2019s\nICE is one of nine agencies within the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 and it\u2019s worth noting that DHS itself touts on its website that all agencies combined make DHS \"the largest federal law enforcement agency with approximately 80,000 officers across nine agencies and offices.\"\nThe law Trump signed provides about $165 billion for Homeland Security, including $46.5 billion to finish building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Its ICE-specific budgetary provisions add up to about $75 billion over four years.\nThe FBI and the DEA are part of the Justice Department. The DEA has a budget of about $2.6 billion and employs about 10,000 people throughout the world, making it easily smaller than both the FBI and ICE, no matter how you look at it.\nReichlin-Melnick told us he based his own ICE comparisons on funding.\n\"I\u2019ve been saying that ICE will become the nation\u2019s highest-funded federal law enforcement agency, with a budget larger than the combined budget of the FBI, ATF, DEA, U.S. Marshals Service, and Bureau of Prisons,\" Reichlin-Melnick wrote to PolitiFact.\nOf the $75 billion going to ICE through September 2029, $45 billion is for 80,000 new detention beds. The remaining $30 billion will go toward hiring 10,000 new employees, removal operations and facility and information technology upgrades.\nThat works out to about $17.7 billion more per year through September 2029, bringing the total annual budget to about $27.7 billion. (ICE\u2019s current annual budget is about $10 billion.)\nThat total amount for ICE adds up to more than the current annual budgets of the FBI, DEA and other law enforcement agencies including the Bureau of Prisons, according to the Justice Department.\nStaffing comparison is more murky\nIf you look at the three agencies by staffing, the comparison is less certain.\nAs of April, the FBI had about 38,000 employees, 13,000 of whom are special agents authorized to make arrests.\nICE has about 20,000 employees, including 6,100 deportation officers and 6,500 special agents authorized to make arrests. Under the new law, ICE\u2019s force will grow to 30,000 within four years \u2014 10,000 of them officers, agents, investigators and support staff.\nSo although the FBI overall is larger than ICE now, ICE could surpass the FBI in the number of agents with authority to make arrests, depending on how hiring breaks down for the new 10,000 positions.\nAgencies\u2019 base budgets are not yet set\nOne caveat: ICE\u2019s future annual budgets are unclear because the administration could spend the $75 billion sooner rather than later \u2014 meaning, not in equal measure across the four years, Migration Policy Institute spokesperson Michelle Mittelstadt said.\n\"Also, Congress is currently working on (fiscal year) 2026 appropriations, so they could change ICE\u2019s annual budget then, too,\" Mittelstadt said.\nThe new law that Trump signed includes extra funding for ICE; it does not mention the annual base budget for ICE or the FBI for the next fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1.\nTrump proposed that Congress provide $11.3 billion for ICE, an increase over its current $10 billion. The FBI\u2019s budget request is $10.1 billion; a reduction of $545 million and of at least 1,500 positions, including about 700 that are vacant, according to a June Justice Department budget and performance summary.\nFeatured Fact-check\nICE\u2019s expanded work will also involve outside contractors, other agencies\nOther experts on ICE or the federal budget noted additional caveats.\nJohn Sandweg, who served as acting director of ICE during part of Obama\u2019s administration, told PolitiFact that more than one-third of ICE\u2019s detention beds are operated by private prison companies.\n\"If you consider the guards and other facility personnel (most of whom technically work for the detention provider) as ICE employees, the agency is likely to be larger than the FBI,\" Sandweg said.\nThe Trump administration has also allowed federal officials in other agencies, such as the DEA, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the U.S. Marshals Service to enforce immigration law.\nICE has hundreds of agreements delegating some immigration authorities to state and local police.\n\"None of those would be counted as personnel in the ICE budget justification, but it would vastly increase the number of law enforcement personnel acting on behalf of ICE,\" said Joshua Sewell, Taxpayers for Common Sense director of research and policy.\nAn example: Florida cooperates with ICE and in July opened Alligator Alcatraz, an immigration detention facility. The state will incur the upfront costs and seek reimbursement from the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s Shelter and Services Program.\nRELATED: Fact-checking Trump at Florida\u2019s Alligator Alcatraz about immigration, One Big Beautiful Bill\nOur ruling\nFavreau said, \"ICE will now become the country\u2019s largest federal law enforcement agency, bigger than the FBI, bigger than the DEA.\"\nHe\u2019s right about ICE being bigger than DEA.\nAnd ICE becomes the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency under Trump\u2019s law compared with the FBI\u2019s existing budget. But there are some unknowns: We don\u2019t know if the $75 billion newly allocated to ICE will be spent evenly over four years or as a huge infusion in the first year, making the annual budget comparison tricky. We also don\u2019t know what will happen with the FBI\u2019s annual budget over the next four years.\nIf the new ICE funds are allocated evenly over four years and based on current budget levels, that adds up to $27.7 billion annually for ICE, more than the FBI\u2019s annual budget of about $10 billion and DEA\u2019s $2.6 billion.\nAs to agency staffing, the FBI\u2019s 38,000 workforce is greater than ICE\u2019s 20,000 plus the expected 10,000 new hires. But ICE could surpass the FBI in the number of agents with authority to make arrests, depending on how the new hires shake out.\nThe statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

      "text": "I am a Washington correspondent for The New York Times, focusing on the Trump administration and its efforts to transform the federal government.\nWhat I Cover\nMy job is to document how President Trump and his allies are reshaping the U.S. government through policy changes, spending cuts, deregulation and the disassembling of the federal bureaucracy. I focus particularly on the billionaire Elon Musk and his government overhaul task force, known as the Department of Government Efficiency. I seek to reveal the impact that these changes have on American life, as well as to hold the administration and the federal bureaucracy to account.\nMy Background\nI joined The Times\u2019s political desk in 2023, covering the presidential campaigns of Ron DeSantis, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris across 19 states over nearly two years.\nBefore that, I worked for nine years at The Miami Herald, mainly as an investigative reporter.\nAt The Herald, I shared in a Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the Panama Papers, a trove of leaked documents that exposed the stream of dirty money fueling Miami\u2019s real estate boom. I also shared a Polk Award for a series on Mr. DeSantis\u2019s efforts to transport migrants from the Mexican border to Martha\u2019s Vineyard. And my colleagues and I were Pulitzer finalists for an investigation into international gold smuggling. I am the co-author of two books: \u201cDirty Gold: The Rise and Fall of an International Smuggling Ring\u201d and \u201cThe Grifter\u2019s Club: Trump, Mar-a-Lago, and the Selling of the Presidency.\u201d\nI grew up in New Jersey, attended Harvard College and earned a master\u2019s degree at the Toni Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism at Columbia Journalism School.\nJournalistic Ethics\nIn my work, I uphold the standards of integrity outlined in our Ethical Journalism Handbook, which states that our reporters may not accept gifts, money or favors from anyone who might figure into our reporting. I do not contribute to political campaigns. I also ensure that all of my stories are accurate and fair. I protect my sources. These are reasonable expectations for any reader to have of our journalists, and I strive to live up to them every day.\nContact Me"

During that time, I\u2019ve covered the federal government\u2019s response to the Sept. 11 attacks and the terrorism threats to the country in the decade that followed. I have also covered the federal response to natural disasters, national security and public safety issues. For the first three years of the Biden administration, I wrote about immigration policy.

      "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Attorney General Pam Bondi directed her staff Monday to act on the criminal referral from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard related to the alleged conspiracy to tie President Donald Trump to Russia, and the Department of Justice is now opening a grand jury investigation into the matter, Fox News Digital has learned.\nBondi personally ordered an unnamed federal prosecutor to initiate legal proceedings and the prosecutor is expected to present department evidence to a grand jury, which would allow the department to secure a potential indictment, according to a letter from Bondi reviewed by Fox News Digital and a source familiar with the investigation.\nA DOJ spokesperson declined to comment on the report of an investigation but said Bondi is taking the referral from Gabbard \"very seriously.\" The spokesperson said Bondi believed there is \"clear cause for deep concern\" and a need for next steps.\nThe DOJ confirmed two weeks ago it received a criminal referral from Gabbard. The referral included a memorandum titled \"Intelligence Community suppression of intelligence showing \u2018Russian and criminal actors did not impact\u2019 the 2016 presidential election via cyber-attacks on infrastructure\" and asked that the DOJ open an investigation.\nNo charges have been brought at this stage of the investigation against any potential defendants.\nThe revelation that the DOJ is moving forward with a grand jury probe comes after Gabbard declassified intelligence in July that shed new light on the Obama administration\u2019s alleged determination that Russia sought to help Trump in the 2016 election.\nFormer President Barack Obama and his intelligence officials allegedly promoted a \"contrived narrative that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help President Trump win, selling it to the American people as though it were true. It wasn't,\" Gabbard said during a press briefing of the intelligence.\nAmong the declassified material was a meeting record revealing how Obama allegedly requested his deputies prepare an intelligence assessment in December 2016, after Trump had won the election, that allegedly detailed the \"tools Moscow used and actions it took to influence the 2016 election.\"\nThat intelligence assessment stressed that Russia's actions did not affect the outcome of the election but rather were intended to sow distrust in the democratic process.\nGabbard has alleged that Obama and his national security officials laid the \"groundwork\" for a narrative that then-candidate Trump and his campaign colluded to help him win the 2016 election. An FBI investigation and two special counsel investigations loomed over much of Trump's first administration.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIt is unclear whom the grand jury is expected to target and what charges could be in play given the statutes of limitations for much of the activity from nearly a decade ago have lapsed.\nFormer Obama intelligence officials, including John Brennan, James Clapper and James Comey, have drawn scrutiny from Trump officials for their alleged involvement in developing intelligence that undermined Trump's 2016 victory.\nThis is a developing story. Check back for updates."

The ruling came after a coalition of 20 Democratic-led states sued the administration, arguing that the suspension of the program would expose states to increased disaster risks. The judge's decision prevents the diversion of over $4 billion allocated for the program until the case is resolved.",
