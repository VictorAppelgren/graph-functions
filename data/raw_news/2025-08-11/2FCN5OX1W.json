  "title": "Google Home app brings faster, smarter camera streaming in latest update",
  "description": "Google has shared release notes for the latest Google Home app update, which brings a fix for phantom offline camera alerts, and more.",
  "content": "Google has shared release notes for version 3.38 of the Google Home app. The update started rolling out earlier this month, and we now know that it focuses on smoother, more reliable camera performance as well as some important bug fixes.\n\nReleased on August 4, Google notes that the update delivers two under-the-hood improvements for Nest and compatible Google Home cameras. First, the app will now more accurately report whether a camera is online or offline, helping prevent frustrating phantom offline messages some users have noticed in the past. Second, Google Home users can expect reduced latency when starting a live view, thanks to better signalling that makes the first frame appear faster and streaming more dependable.\n\nWhile version 3.38 of the Google Home app zones in on camera stability, the previous release, version 3.37, also brought some visible updates to the table. One new feature released with that update in July was camera tile previews. These previews let users quickly identify each camera from a recent snapshot without waiting for the live feed to load.\n\nVersion 3.37 also addressed several glitches, including issues accessing the top app bar and settings on certain Google Accounts on the iOS Google Home app, text overlapping on Nest Renew and Public Preview pages, also on iOS, and crashes while starting up the Google Home app. Alongside these fixes, Google fine-tuned overall load times and stability for a smoother user experience.\n\nHave you noticed these new features and improvements in your Google Home app? Share your thoughts on the app\u2019s performance, and tell us which features you\u2019d like to see next or any bugs you think Google should fix.",

Learn more.\n5 security cameras you should buy instead of Google Nest ones\nJuly 18, 2025\nIt\u2019s hard to blame anyone for feeling fed up with Google Nest cameras right now. The latest Nest Aware price hike means users will soon be paying up to $200 a year, with zero new features to show for it. That\u2019s on top of already pricey hardware, limited local storage options, and a system that some feel might actually be getting worse rather than better.\nMaybe you\u2019re already planning to cancel like some of these angry Redditors. Maybe you\u2019re just Nest-curious but don\u2019t love the idea of hefty recurring fees for the functionality you expect. Either way, there\u2019s good news: there are plenty of excellent security camera alternatives out there that don\u2019t lock you into a monthly bill \u2014 or at least cost a whole lot less than Google\u2019s subscription.\nWe\u2019ve rounded up five of the best options that either ditch the subscription entirely or offer way better value than Google Nest Aware. Whether you\u2019re replacing an indoor camera or an outdoor one, every option is a respectable brand with solid features. We\u2019ve also gone for simpler setups, though the likes of UniFi and Reolink are good options for more DIY inclined users.\nWhich Google Nest camera alternative would you choose?\nTP-Link Tapo C225\nIf you\u2019re ditching Nest because you\u2019re tired of paying for features you don\u2019t really need, the TP-Link Tapo C225 should be high on your list. This compact indoor pan-and-tilt camera hits the sweet spot between price, performance, and privacy without tying you into any particular ecosystem.\nThe C225 is all about flexibility. It supports microSD storage, so you don\u2019t need to pay for cloud recording if you don\u2019t want to. But it also plays nicely with Synology NAS systems (via ONVIF) or third-party alarm setups (thanks to RTSP support), giving you backup options that Google simply doesn\u2019t offer. There\u2019s even a manual privacy shutter \u2014 something you won\u2019t find on Nest cams.\nYou still get AI-powered person detection, night vision, two-way talk, and smart alerts.\nDespite the lack of a subscription requirement, you still get AI-powered person detection, night vision, two-way talk, and smart alerts. It\u2019s also compatible with Google Home, though it won\u2019t appear in the Favorites tab. Still, it works well in routines and voice commands. Also, the camera itself is extremely budget-friendly.\nRita El Khoury is one of our resident smart home fans, and she swears by the Tapo C225. In addition to the features, she enjoys the peace of mind that comes from keeping her video data local. As she put it, \u201cBeing in control of my videos inside my own home was more important to me. Also, not paying a monthly sub when I have storage.\u201d\nEufyCam 2C Pro\nThe EufyCam 2C Pro is a dependable, wire-free outdoor security camera with a strong reputation for doing the basics well and not charging for the privilege. With 2K video, color night vision, AI-powered person detection, and two-way audio, it delivers many of the features you\u2019d typically expect to find locked behind a subscription.\nOne of its biggest advantages of this smart home addition is that most system variants come with the Eufy HomeBase 2, which handles local video storage and smart alerts. You get up to 16GB of encrypted storage built in, and no ongoing fees are required to access your recordings or AI features. Make sure you grab one with the HomeBase 2, as the camera is much less effective on its own.\nBattery life is rated at up to 180 days per charge, and the whole system is designed to be as hands-off as possible. You can optionally add Eufy\u2019s cloud storage plan if you want off-site backup, but most people don\u2019t find it necessary. It\u2019s not the cheapest choice, but compared to a Google Nest Aware subscription, it\u2019s a more privacy-conscious and wallet-friendly setup.\nBlink Outdoor 4\nFor a no-fuss outdoor camera with flexible storage and a gentle price tag, the Blink Outdoor 4 is a great place to land. It\u2019s compact, weather-resistant, and completely wire-free, with battery life that can last up to two years on a pair of AAs \u2014 something that puts most Nest cameras to shame.\nAmazon\u2019s camera gives you storage options. You can use it with a Blink subscription plan ($3 per month for each device or $10 per month for unlimited), which gives you 60 days of cloud storage and extra features like person alerts. Or you can skip the plan and use local video storage via the Sync Module 2 and a USB drive.\nThe camera supports HD video, motion detection, night vision, and two-way talk, and setup is refreshingly simple through the Blink app. It\u2019s not as feature-packed as some pricier systems \u2014 there\u2019s no local AI detection, and you won\u2019t find advanced integration with Google or Apple platforms. However, for the price, it covers the basics well.\nCompared to a Google Nest setup, Blink offers a much lower cost of ownership over time, and it\u2019s ideal for anyone who wants a dependable security camera without diving into a whole new ecosystem.\nWyze Cam v4\nThe Wyze Cam v4 keeps things simple and affordable, while still delivering features that punch well above its weight. It records in sharp 2.5K resolution, handles color night vision, and has a 160-degree field of view. That\u2019s not bad for a camera that costs about as much as dinner for two.\nOn the storage side, you can drop in a microSD card and get continuous recording, time-lapse footage, and event playback without a subscription. There\u2019s an optional Cam Plus plan for things like person detection and cloud storage, but you\u2019re never forced into it.\nIt\u2019s primarily an indoor camera, but with a weatherproof case (sold separately), many users mount it outside without issues. The app is intuitive, setup is quick, and you can build a full home setup piece by piece without breaking the bank. Google Nest might offer deeper smart home integration, but for basic video coverage, Wyze is way more forgiving on your wallet and easy to scale if you want to add more cams later.\nArlo Essential (2nd Gen)\nArlo makes some high-end security cameras with sharper video, advanced features, and longer battery life \u2014 and if you\u2019re happy to spend a bit more, those are solid options. But the Essential (2nd Gen) strikes a great balance between capability and cost, making it a strong pick if you want reliable protection without the premium price tag. It\u2019s compact, weatherproof, and wireless, with a built-in spotlight, color night vision, and 1080p HD video. For everyday home monitoring, it more than holds its own.\nArlo has a subscription model that undercuts Nest\u2019s offering. While you\u2019ll need an Arlo Secure plan to unlock cloud storage and smart detection features, it starts at just $3.99 per month per camera, or $12.99 per month for unlimited cameras. And if you\u2019re willing to go a little deeper, you can pair the camera with an Arlo SmartHub to add local storage and avoid the cloud altogether.\nSetup is straightforward, and the camera works with Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple Home, and IFTTT, so it fits into most smart home setups without much fuss. It may not have the razor-sharp 2K resolution or advanced tracking of Arlo\u2019s higher-end models, but it covers the basics exceptionally well at a price with which it\u2019s hard to argue.\nThank you for being part of our community.
