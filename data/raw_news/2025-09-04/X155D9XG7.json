  "content": "Duquesne Family Office's billionaire investor dumped one of the hottest AI stocks on the planet in favor of another critical company in the AI arena.\n\nFor many investors, earnings season is the highlight of each quarter. This is the six-week period where the lion's share of S&P 500 companies reports their operating results from the previous three-month period.\n\nHowever, a strong argument can be made that Form 13F filings can be just as informative. A 13F is a required filing by institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management no later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter. It provides a concise rundown of which stocks Wall Street's savviest investors were buying and selling in the latest quarter.\n\nAlthough Warren Buffett is traditionally the most followed of all asset managers, he's not the only billionaire investor with a penchant for outsized returns. Duquesne Family Office's billionaire boss Stanley Druckenmiller is another fund manager with a knack for spotting good deals.\n\nOver the trailing year (ended June 30, 2025), Duquesne's 13Fs show Druckenmiller completely exited his fund's stake in one of the hottest and highest-flying artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, Palantir Technologies (PLTR -1.39%), and looks to be, once again, building a position in a critical trillion-dollar AI stock.\n\nPalantir's heave-ho may have to do with more than just profit-taking\n\nWhen the midpoint of 2024 came to a close, Duquesne Family Office was holding nearly 770,000 shares of AI-data mining specialist Palantir.\n\nIt's been a popular stock to own thanks to the irreplaceability of its AI- and machine learning-propelled Gotham and Foundry platforms. Gotham tends to land multiyear contracts with the U.S. and other federal governments to help with military mission planning and data collection. As for Foundry, it's used by businesses to make sense of their data and improve their operating efficiency. With no clear-cut replacement for the software-as-a-service solutions Palantir provides, it's earned quite the premium from investors.\n\nBut between June 30, 2024, and March 31, 2025, Druckenmiller jettisoned his fund's entire stake.\n\nProfit-taking is the most logical of all explanations as to why Palantir stock was given the heave-ho. The 69 securities in Duquesne Family Office's investment portfolio, as of June 30, 2025, have been held for an average of less than seven months. In other words, its billionaire boss isn't shy about cashing in his chips following a sizable gain, as was the case with Palantir Technologies.\n\nThe worry is that profit-taking might not be the only reason Stanley Druckenmiller showed shares of Palantir to the door.\n\nThe most glaring potential problem with Palantir stock is its valuation. Although \"value\" is subjective, and Palantir is deserving of some level of premium because of its irreplaceability, the company's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is so far above historical norms that it's left the chat.\n\nOver multiple decades, companies on the leading edge of a next-big-thing investment trend have seen their shares peak at roughly 30 to 40 times sales. Palantir entered this week with a P/S ratio of 115. Even with the company consistently surpassing Wall Street's sales and profit projections, there's nothing it can report from an operating standpoint that justifies a triple-digit P/S ratio, let alone a P/S ratio of 30 to 40, which is a level no other megacap company has been able to sustain.\n\nAdditionally, insiders can't seem to get rid of their shares fast enough. Since becoming a publicly traded company in late September 2020, only one insider purchase has been made by a current/former executive or director, compared to more than $7.6 billion in net stock sold. If insiders won't purchase Palantir stock, why should billionaires or everyday investors?\n\nThis trillion-dollar AI networking stock was back on Druckenmiller's menu\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Duquesne's billionaire chief oversaw quite a bit of buying. While most of this buying activity had nothing to do with AI stocks, one pivotal, trillion-dollar company within the AI space does stand out: Broadcom (AVGO 1.30%).\n\nBroadcom isn't a stranger to Stanley Druckenmiller's fund. During the third quarter of 2024, he oversaw the purchase of almost 240,000 shares of this AI networking giant. But in the subsequent quarter, this position was completely exited.\n\nBased on Duquesne's second-quarter 13F, Broadcom is back. During the June-ended quarter, Druckenmiller purchased a little over 86,000 shares, worth close to $24 million, as of the midpoint of 2025.\n\nWall Street's mini-crash in early April is probably one of the reasons Druckenmiller loaded up on shares of Broadcom, once again. Following President Donald Trump's unveiling of its tariff and trade policy on April 2, the benchmark S&P 500 endured its fifth-largest two-day percentage decline in 75 years. A nearly one-week period of fear and pessimism created a unique opportunity for investors like Druckenmiller to snag amazing businesses at a discount. Although we don't know if this is when Duquesne added to Broadcom, the early portion of April would make sense.\n\nBroadcom's hardware is integral to the success of the AI revolution. Its solutions are connecting tens of thousands of graphics processing units in enterprise data centers to maximize their compute capacity, as well as reduce tail latency. The latter is particularly important, as minimizing lag is a necessity for AI-empowered software and systems making split-second decisions.\n\nBroadcom's custom AI application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are also a massive opportunity. CEO Hock Tan believes custom ASICs could help drive $60 billion to $90 billion in revenue to Broadcom from three of its largest hyperscaler customers by 2027.\n\nAnother key aspect to Broadcom's success is its growth potential outside of artificial intelligence. While there's no denying that AI networking solutions account for the bulk of its growth at the moment, Broadcom generates quite a bit of sales from wireless chips and solutions for smartphones, enterprise cybersecurity, and various solutions used in industrial robotics and automobiles. If an AI bubble were to form and burst, Broadcom would have other operating segments to fall back on.\n\nThe final catalyst for billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller might be Broadcom's valuation. If Duquesne's boss lapped up shares in early April, he'd have nabbed Broadcom at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of less than 20, which is a solid value for a company slated to grow its sales by more than 20% annually.",

      "text": "Information is the lifeblood of Wall Street. However, trying to analyze earnings reports from hundreds of influential public companies, while also keep a watchful eye on U.S. economic data releases and proposed policy changes from the Donald Trump administration, can be overwhelming and allow something of importance to slip through the cracks.\nTwo months ago, on May 15, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management were required to file Form 13F with Securities and Exchange Commission -- and investors might have missed it. This filing allows investors to see which stocks Wall Street's most-successful money managers purchased and sold during the March-ended quarter. In other words, it's an easy way for investors to spot which stocks, industries, sectors, and trends have the undivided attention of the market's top fund managers.\nThough Warren Buffett has the largest following among top-tier asset managers, he's not the only billionaire investor with a knack for spotting amazing deals. Investors also closely follow Duquesne Family Office's Stanley Druckenmiller for ideas.\nDruckenmiller was especially active during the first quarter. He oversaw the complete sale of 38 stocks, including one of the hottest artificial intelligence (AI) companies on the planet, Palantir Technologies (PLTR -1.42%). Meanwhile, one of the few stocks he piled into was a trillion-dollar AI company.\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller cleaned house in the March-ended quarter\nThough Duquesne Family Office's billionaire chief invests in a broad swath of industries, there was certainly a tech vibe to his selling activity in the first quarter. Arguably the most jaw-dropping of these sales was jettisoning all 41,710 shares of Palantir Technologies.\nThe simple fact that Druckenmiller reduced his fund's number of holdings from 78 to 52 over a three-month period speaks volumes. It strongly implies that Duquesne's leader isn't thrilled with the stock market pushing to one of its priciest valuations in history. Duquesne Family Office has an average hold time of less than nine months for its 52 holdings, which suggests Druckenmiller and his team aren't shy about locking in gains.\nWith regard to AI-data-mining specialist Palantir, its shares have climbed by an almost unfathomable 2,370% since the start of 2023. Most megacap stocks don't tack on $360 billion in market value in such a short time frame. Palantir's parabolic ascent gave Druckenmiller every reason to cash in his chips.\nBut there's probably more behind this selling activity than just a desire lock in gains.\nIn a May 2024 interview with CNBC, Duquesne's head investor summarized the AI movement as being overhyped in the short run but likely under-hyped over the long-term.\nSince the proliferation of the internet in the mid-1990s, every game-changing investment opportunity has endured an early stage bubble-bursting event. This is a reflection of investors overestimating how quicky a new technology will gain utility and/or widespread adoption. Though AI spending is robust, it's fairly evident that most businesses haven't yet optimized their AI solutions, nor are many generating a positive return on their AI investments. In short, a bubble is likely brewing.\nThe good news for Palantir is that an AI bubble-bursting event wouldn't cripple its cash flow. Its Gotham segment locks in revenue via multiyear contracts with federal governments. Meanwhile, its newer Foundry platform for businesses is subscription-based. Nevertheless, weak investor sentiment in the wake of a bubble-bursting event would almost certainly drag down Palantir stock.\nThe other issue that can't be swept under the rug is Palantir's valuation. Palantir closed out the previous week at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 127! For context, this is somewhere between three and four times higher than where other megacap companies saw their bubbles burst during the dot-com era. Druckenmiller likely expects a sizable correction in Palantir stock.\nDuquesne's billionaire investor upped his stake in this trillion-dollar stock by 457%\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Stanley Druckenmiller welcomed 12 new stocks to his fund, as well as added to existing stakes in 14 others during the first quarter. While many of these adds were modest, this wasn't the case with world-leading chip fabrication company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 1.34%), which is commonly known as \"TSMC.\"\nDruckenmiller has purchased shares of TSMC for three consecutive quarters, beginning in the third quarter of 2024. But in the March-ended quarter, he really began depressing the accelerator. Duquesne's 13F shows 491,265 shares were purchased, representing a 457% increase from the prior three-month period. It would appear that while Druckenmiller believes AI is overhyped in the short run, he's nevertheless found a new favorite artificial intelligence stock.\nThe investing lure for TSMC is the key role it plays in the proliferation of advanced AI graphics processing units (GPUs). Taiwan Semi is in the process of expanding its monthly chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity from 35,000 units in 2024 to an estimated 135,000 units by 2026. CoWoS is a technology necessary for the packaging of high-bandwidth memory in high-compute data centers.\nWhile expanding CoWoS capacity almost fourfold in a two-year period is impressive, it still may not be enough to satiate enterprise demand. However, it can only mean good things for TSMC's order backlog and pricing power. During the second quarter, 60% of the company's net sales came from high-performance computing, which is up from 52% in the comparable quarter from 2024.\nThough it's easy to get really excited about the future of AI and the role this trillion-dollar company will play in facilitating the manufacture of advanced GPUs, it's important not to overlook that Taiwan Semi is a well-diversified machine.\nFor instance, 27% of TSMC's net sales during the June-ended quarter traced back to wireless chips and accessories used in next-generation smartphones. Even though growth in smartphone sales isn't what it used to be, the consistent evolution and upgrade cycles associated with smartphones leads to consistent operating cash flow and modest long-term growth potential.\nThe same can be said about TSMC's automotive and Internet of Things segments, which collectively accounted for 10% of its net sales during the first half of 2025. As new vehicles and household appliances become more technology dependent, chip demand is only going to grow.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is also reasonably valued, when compared to the likes of Palantir. Whereas Palantir is trading at approximately 215 times forward-year earnings, TSMC can be scooped up for roughly 22 times forecast earnings in 2026. While a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 22 is higher than TSMC's historical average, the company's penchant for blowing past Wall Street's expectations suggests its stock may head even higher."

      "text": "Though earnings season -- the roughly six-week period each quarter where a majority of S&P 500 companies reveal their latest operating results -- provides plenty of juicy data for investors to sift through, there's arguably no data release more important than quarterly filed Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nA 13F offers investors an under-the-hood look at which stocks Wall Street's most-successful asset managers were buying and selling in the latest quarter (in this case, the fourth quarter), and is a required filing for institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management (AUM). The deadline to file Form 13F for the fourth quarter was Feb. 14.\nEven though 13F data can be more than six-weeks old when filed, it clues investors into which stocks, industries, sectors, and next-big-thing trends have the full and undivided attention of Wall Street's top money managers.\nWhile Warren Buffett's trading activity tends to dominate the headlines, there are plenty of other billionaire asset managers that rightly garner attention. For instance, billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office oversees more than $3.7 billion in AUM and has been a wildly successful investor.\nBecause Druckenmiller runs a very active fund -- the average holding time for all positions is less than seven months -- what he's buying and selling tells an important story. During the December-ended quarter, Duquesne's chief completely sold out of one of the leaders of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution and more than 6X'd his stake in a historically cheap drug stock.\nStanley Druckenmiller bids adieu to AI networking solutions provider Broadcom\nDespite completely exiting or reducing Duquesne's position in roughly three-dozen holdings during the fourth quarter, the move that arguably stands out the most is the 239,980-share sale of AI networking solutions specialist Broadcom (AVGO 1.30%).\nLast year, Broadcom became one of only 11 publicly traded companies globally to have reached a nominal $1 trillion market cap. Its nearly parabolic ascent is a reflection of its networking solutions being the preferred choice in high-compute data centers. The company's Jericho3-AI fabric is being used to connect up to 32,000 GPUs, with the goal of maximizing GPU computing capacity and reducing tail latency. Minimizing lag is especially important when AI software and systems rely on split-second decisions.\nThere's also a lot of excitement surrounding Broadcom's custom application-specific integrated circuits. Broadcom getting into custom AI chips is a potential game-changer that CEO Hock Tan believes could lead to between $60 billion and $90 billion in cumulative sales from its top three hyperscaler customers from 2025 through 2027.\nBut there are viable reasons for billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller to bid adieu to one of Wall Street's top AI stocks.\nAs noted, Druckenmiller runs an active hedge fund and ringing the register when a stock moves notably higher is commonplace. During the fourth quarter, Broadcom's stock gained 34%, or close to $300 billion in market value. Simple profit-taking is a very real possibility.\nHowever, Duquesne's billionaire money manager might have also been worried about history running its course. Since (and including) the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, every next-big-thing innovation has worked its way through an early innings bubble-bursting event.\nPut another way, investors have consistently overestimated the utility and consumer/enterprise adoption rate of every game-changing technology for three decades. There's nothing to suggest artificial intelligence will be an exception to this rule. If the AI bubble bursts, it would undoubtedly weigh on Broadcom.\nThe final concern that may have encouraged Druckenmiller to dump Broadcom is the company's valuation. Although Broadcom's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31 isn't egregiously high amid a historically pricey stock market, it represents an eye-popping 81% premium to the company's average forward P/E over the trailing-five-year period.\nDruckenmiller more than sextupled his fund's stake in this scorching-hot drug stock\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Duquesne's chief newly purchased or added to around four dozen positions. Among these, the one that stands out the most is brand-name and generic-drug developer Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA 0.08%). Druckenmiller oversaw the purchase 7,569,450 shares of Teva, which increased his fund's stake by 530% and made it Duquesne's fourth-largest holding.\nIt's been quite some time since Teva was in the good graces of Wall Street and its top money managers. Between August 2015 and May 2023, shares of the company declined by close to 90%. This drop-off is related to a multitude of factors, such as litigation regarding its role in the opioid crisis, the end of sales exclusivity for blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone, and the company's sizable debt load in the wake of its acquisition of generic-drug developer Actavis.\nBut in less than two years, Teva's stock has more than doubled. With quite a few catalysts in its sails, this hot drug stock is garnering attention for good reason.\nOne of the top reasons for Teva's turnaround has been its ability to put litigation in the rearview mirror. For instance, the company settled its opioid lawsuits with 48 states for $4.25 billion two years ago. Though this might sound like a staggering figure, Teva will pay this sum over 13 years, it includes up to $1.2 billion in generic Narcan (the opioid overdose reversal drug) provided to the 48 states. In other words, it's not all cash directly out of Teva's coffers. With this legal liability lifted, the company's earnings multiple is free to expand.\nSpeaking of earnings, Teva's management team has begun placing more emphasis on novel-drug research. Even though brand-name drugs have a finite period of sales exclusivity, they generate substantially higher margins than generic drugs and provide Teva with plenty of pricing power. For example, sales of tardive dyskinesia therapy Austedo jumped 34% in the U.S. to $1.64 billion in 2024, with migraine-prevention therapy Ajovy enjoying 34% sales growth in Europe last year.\nBeing able to resolve key litigation and return the company to positive sales growth has resulted in a meaningful improvement in the company's balance sheet. Following the Actavis acquisition in August 2016, Teva had north of $35 billion in net debt on its balance sheet. But as of the close of 2024, net debt was down to less than $14.5 billion. As the company's financial flexibility improves, so will opportunities to invest in higher-growth initiatives.\nLast but certainly not least, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries remains historically cheap. Shares can be purchased for less than 6 times forward-year earnings, which is a steal for a drug stock with rising sales and a bright outlook."

      "text": "For the better part of the past 30 years, investors have had a game-changing technology or next-big-thing trend to captivate their attention and wallets. Some of these hyped advancements include the internet, genome decoding, blockchain technology, and the metaverse. But not since the proliferation of the internet have investors demonstrated the level of enthusiasm they have for the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).\nIn Sizing the Prize, the analysts at PwC pegged the addressable opportunity for AI, inclusive of productivity improvements and consumption-side effects, at $15.7 trillion globally by 2030. It's mammoth figures like this that have fueled a near-parabolic climb in Wall Street's AI darling, Palantir Technologies (PLTR -1.42%).\nAs of this writing on Aug. 10, Palantir has ascended the ladder to become the 19th largest publicly traded company in the U.S., with a market cap topping $443 billion. To put its more than 2,800% gain since the start of 2023 into context, it's now larger than:\n- Healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson, which had delivered adjusted operating earnings growth for 35 consecutive years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- Warehouse club Costco Wholesale, which has had just a couple of down years over the last two decades.\n- Home improvement chain Home Depot, which is a core player in new home construction, remodeling, and repairs.\nAnother 2% upside and Palantir will eclipse ExxonMobil, which is the largest publicly traded energy company in the United States.\nTo say that Palantir's rally has been impressive would understate just how far it's come in such a short period. But it also highlights how perilous Palantir's ascent just might be.\nPalantir's ascent has been driven by its irreplaceability\nPalantir Technologies transitioning from just another tech stock to one of the sector's most important businesses in two years wasn't an accident. It's a reflection of bringing well-defined and sustainable competitive advantages to the table.\nPalantir's premier operating segment is Gotham. This AI- and machine learning (ML)-powered software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform is used by federal governments to collect and analyze data, as well as plan and oversee military missions. Typically, Gotham secures multiyear contracts from the U.S. government, which provides highly predictable operating cash flow year after year.\nThe other core operating segment for Palantir is Foundry. This AI- and ML-inspired SaaS platform helps businesses make sense of their data in order to streamline/automate their operations. This is a newer segment, relative to Gotham, and is therefore capable of delivering a juicier growth rate.\nNeither Gotham nor Foundry has large-scale competitors angling for their clients. Businesses that are deemed irreplaceable are usually bestowed with a healthy premium on Wall Street.\nPalantir has also helped its cause by becoming profitable on a recurring basis well ahead of consensus expectations. Alex Karp's company has consistently blown past even the loftiest growth and profit projections.\nPrediction: It's not a matter of if but when this house of cards comes crashing down\nWhile there's no denying Palantir is worthy of a premium valuation given its sustainable competitive edges, there's a rational limit to what this premium entails. Put bluntly, Palantir has all the hallmarks of a house of cards that will, eventually, collapse.\nMake no mistake about the following argument: I'm not attempting to precisely call a top in Palantir stock. If Wall Street has taught me anything about investing over the past 27 years, it's that stocks can stay irrational longer than short-sellers can remain solvent. But at some point, in what I'd presume is the not-too-distant future, this near-parabolic ascent will end in an unceremonious fashion.\nFirst, Palantir will have to overcome macro pressures. For instance, the S&P 500's (^GSPC 0.51%) Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio recently hit its third priciest multiple when backtested 154 years. History tells us that when stock valuations become this extended, it's simply a matter of time before Wall Street's major indexes endure a bear market decline. If history were to follow suit, some of Wall Street's biggest winners (ahem, Palantir) would likely be hit hardest during a marketwide downturn.\nAlong these same lines, there hasn't been a game-changing technological advance or innovation that's avoided a bubble-bursting event in more than three decades.\nIncluding the internet, every hyped trend has eventually fallen off, with investors consistently overestimating the utility or adoption rates of game-changing technologies. Even though businesses are spending big bucks on AI infrastructure, early returns suggest most have yet to optimize their AI solutions or generate a positive return on their investments. If the AI bubble bursts, Palantir would have a bullseye on its proverbial back.\nBut let's not beat around the bush: Palantir's valuation is completely unjustifiable.\nBefore the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost 49% and 78% of their respective value during the bursting of the dot-com bubble, Wall Street's leading businesses peaked at price-to-sales (P/S) ratios ranging from 31 to 43. Perhaps not coincidentally, AI powerhouse Nvidia topped out at a P/S ratio of 42 last summer. The point being that P/S ratios of 30 to 40 have historically served as ceilings for megacap companies.\nAs of the closing bell on Aug. 8, Palantir's P/S ratio was 137! That's not 37 with an accidental typo. That's 137 times trailing-12-month sales for the 19th-largest domestic public company. There isn't a megacap company that's come even remotely close to justifying or sustaining such a premium valuation throughout history.\nEven if Palantir's stock went sideway for the next four years, it would be still be valued at 116 times forecast earnings per share and trade at 38 times projected sales, which again is right in line with where previous bubbles popped.\nA final concern that can't be swept under the rug is the lack of clarity on defense spending for Gotham beyond 2028. While President Trump's administration has made defense spending and internal AI innovation a priority, midterm elections and Trump's departure from the White House in January 2029 can change everything.\nPalantir is truly priced for perfection. Unfortunately, no situation is ever perfect."

      "text": "Roughly three decades ago, the advent and proliferation of the internet changed the growth arc for corporate America. Since this transformational event, investors have been waiting for the next true technological leap forward to emerge. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) looks to be the answer.\nThe capacity for software and systems empowered with AI solutions to make split-second decisions without human intervention is a potential game-changer for most industries around the globe. It's the reason PwC pegged the global addressable market for AI at a staggering $15.7 trillion by 2030 in Sizing the Prize.\nBut as is the case with all next-big-thing innovations, this optimism isn't universal. Although an overwhelming percentage of Wall Street analysts have buy ratings and lofty price targets attached to the faces of the AI revolution -- Nvidia (NVDA -0.24%) and Palantir Technologies (PLTR -1.42%) -- there are exceptions.\nBased on reports and issued price targets from two select Wall Street analysts, these foundational pieces to the evolution of artificial intelligence can plummet 42% and 74%, respectively, over the coming year.\nNvidia: Implied downside of 42%\nArguably no AI stock is more loved by Wall Street than Nvidia. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) hold the bulk of AI-data center market share and act as the brains powering split-second decision-making, generative AI solutions, and the training of large language models. Out of the 66 analysts who've issued a buy-, hold-, or sell-equivalent rating on Nvidia, 59 rate its stock a buy.\nWhat keeps Nvidia stock from being universally loved is analyst Jay Goldberg of Seaport Global. Goldberg is the lone Wall Street analyst to have a sell rating on Nvidia, with a price target of $100. If Goldberg's pessimistic prognostication was to come to fruition, the largest publicly traded company would tumble 42%.\nOne of Goldberg's top criticism's of Nvidia is something I've been beating the drum on for the last year: internal competition. Though external competitors are ramping up their production of AI-GPUs, Nvidia's top threat may very well come from its own top customers by net sales.\nMost members of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" which happen to be some of Nvidia's top clients, are developing AI chips to use in their data centers. Even though these chips can't stand up to Nvidia's GPUs on a compute basis, they're considerably cheaper and not backlogged. In other words, they're going to minimize the AI-GPU scarcity that's helped drive Nvidia's pricing power and gross margin higher.\nGoldberg is also skeptical of the sustainability of the AI spending cycle.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang isn't sparing any expense when it comes to sustaining his company's competitive edge. He aims to bring a new advanced AI chip to market annually, with Blackwell Ultra being the next in line to reach clients. While newer and faster chips should, on paper, help Nvidia support its premium pricing, it could also quickly depreciate prior-generation AI chips, such as the Hopper (H100). If previous generation AI-GPUs rapidly depreciate, it may delay upgrade cycles and/or irritate key customers.\nThe other consideration here is that every next-big-thing technology since (and including) the proliferation of the internet has endured a bubble-bursting event early in its existence. Though it's impossible to predict when the music will stop since bubbles are typically driven by emotions, historical precedent doesn't lie. Investors consistently overestimate the adoption and utility of game-changing technologies.\nIf an artificial intelligence bubble was to form and burst, there's not an AI stock that would be more directly impacted than Nvidia.\nPalantir Technologies: Implied downside of 74%\nBut on a comparative basis, the projected downside for AI-data mining specialist Palantir Technologies over the next year is even more pronounced.\nAccording to longtime Palantir bear Rishi Jaluria of RBC Capital Markets, Palantir stock is headed to $40, which would represent a 74% pullback from where shares of the company closed on August 1. It's worth noting that Jaluria previously had an $11 target on Palantir entering 2025.\nPalantir stock has rallied more than 2,300% since the start of 2023 due to its shift to recurring profitability, as well as its irreplaceability. Though Palantir's enterprise-focused Foundry platform has some small-scale competition, neither Foundry nor its government-driven Gotham platform, which assists with military mission planning and execution, have large-scale challengers. This has led to consistent operating cash flow and sales growth of 25% or greater on an annual basis.\nJaluria's displeasure with Palantir boils down to two factors.\nFirst, RBC Capital's software analyst is skeptical of Foundry's sales momentum. In a note released prior to Palantir's first-quarter operating results being revealed, Jaluria expressed his concerns that Foundry's rapidly rising margins were the result of one-off deals. Given the level of personalization needed of Foundry to satisfy its clients needs, it's not yet clear if this is a rapidly scalable segment.\nBut make no mistake about it, the biggest problem with Palantir, in the eyes of Rishi Jaluria, is its valuation. As of the closing bell on Aug. 1, Palantir was tipping the scales at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 123. To offer some idea of how far outside of historical norms this is, industry-leading companies on the cutting-edge of the dot-com bubble topped out at P/S ratios of roughly 30 to 40. No megacap company has ever been able to sustain a P/S ratio above 30, let alone four times that amount.\nSomething else that should be taken into consideration is Gotham's narrow pool of potential clients. An AI- and machine learning-driven platform that assists with data collection and military mission planning isn't something that China, Russia, or dozens of other countries will be granted access to. In fact, only America and its immediate allies are potential buyers of these solutions. This places a genuine ceiling on Gotham's growth potential, which isn't ideal for a stock trading at a nosebleed valuation."

      "text": "What is it?\nWhat is the price-to-sales ratio?\nThe price-to-sales ratio, also known as \"price/sales,\" \"P/S ratio,\" or \"list-price-to-sale-price ratio,\" is one of many valuation metrics for stocks. The ratio describes how much someone must pay to buy one share of a company relative to how much that share generates in revenue for the company. Generally speaking, the lower the P/S ratio, the better.\nFormula\nPrice-to-sales ratio formula\nYou determine the P/S ratio by dividing the company's total market capitalization by its trailing 12-month revenue:\nThat means the P/S ratio is based solely on revenue, not on profits or cash flow. As a result, it's especially useful for comparing the valuations of companies with little or no profit or negative cash flow.\nCash Flow\nAmazon (AMZN 0.17%), for example, is notorious for having been unprofitable until 2003, seven years after it went public. On Jan. 1, 2003, Amazon's market capitalization (the sum of the price of all its outstanding shares) was $7.3 billion. Its trailing 12-month revenue was $3.9 billion. Divide $7.3 billion by $3.9 billion and you get about 1.8, which was Amazon's P/S ratio at the time.\nExample\nAn example of price-to-sales ratio analysis\nBy using the P/S ratio, we can compare Amazon's valuation on Jan. 1, 2003, with its performance leading up to that point:\nDue largely to how quickly Amazon was increasing its revenue, its price-to-sales ratio fell from a high of about 40 to 1.8. As a result, Amazon looks like a comparative bargain in 2003. (And it was: The stock has appreciated more than 22,000% since then.)\nComparing companies\nThe price-to-sales ratio can also be used for comparing companies -- including unprofitable companies -- against one another. Here, for example, is a comparison of two cloud-computing solution stocks, Snowflake (SNOW -1.88%) and Datadog (DDOG -1.65%).\nSnowflake's price-to-sales ratio is significantly higher than Datadog's. From a P/S ratio point of view, that makes Snowflake a more expensive stock. But that doesn't mean it's a worse investment. Snowflake could be worth the premium price because it's accruing revenue faster than Datadog. Remember, Amazon made a great investment in the early 2000s despite its sky-high P/S ratio because it was adding revenue at such a rapid clip.\nThe P/S ratio is a good starting point to compare two companies' stock, but investors should dive deeper to understand whether one stock is a better buy than the other.\nAdditional information\nWhat is a good price-to-sales ratio?\nIt depends on the company and the industry.\nGrocery stores, for example, have massive amounts of sales but relatively low profit margins, so it's not unusual for grocery store stocks to see P/S ratios of 0.2 or even 0.1. A higher-margin company could have a much higher P/S ratio and still be considered a bargain. Amazon's P/S ratio, for example, has ranged between 2 and 6 for the past five years.\nBecause P/S ratio is a rear-facing metric that looks only at past performance, fast-growing companies such as Snowflake or Datadog can easily see massive P/S ratios as investors bid up the price in expectation of future sales growth.\nYour best bet when looking at a company's P/S ratio is to compare it with the P/S ratios of similar companies in the same industry.\nOne piece of the puzzle\nThe price-to-sales ratio is a useful tool for evaluating companies, especially those with negative earnings or cash flow that can't be measured through the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio or price-to-free-cash-flow ratio. But the P/S ratio isn't very useful on its own.\nFor example, if one company has a low P/S ratio but an unreasonably high debt load, it isn't necessarily a good value. A company's growth rate, profit margins, and competitive advantages should also be considered. Snowflake's P/S ratio might be much higher than Datadog's, but Snowflake also has no debt, is growing faster, and has a higher gross profit margin.\nInvesting decisions should never be made on the basis of a single metric, and the P/S ratio is no exception.\nRelated investing topics\nGoing beyond the P/S ratio\nCalculating the price-to-sales ratio for any given stock is very easy. Just divide the market cap by the company's total revenue. One of the best ways to use the P/S ratio is by comparing it to a stock's historical average. Alternatively, you can use it to compare the valuations of two companies' stocks to help determine which is a better fit for your portfolio. Ultimately, however, you should dig deeper for context around why the market may be trading a stock at a certain P/S ratio to make the best investment decisions possible."

      "text": "Forward P/E is a valuation metric that uses earnings forecasts to calculate the ratio of the share price to projected earnings per share. The \"P\" in forward P/E stands for price, or share price. The \"E\" stands for future earnings per share.\nWhat is it?\nWhat is forward P/E?\nForward P/E is a variation of the price-to-earnings ratio that uses an estimate of earnings over the next 12 months to calculate the metric. Unlike the trailing P/E, which uses actual earnings results from the previous 12 months, the forward P/E is based on estimates, and is therefore subject to errors in forecasting.\nTo combat the potential to get the estimated earnings wrong, the forward P/E is typically calculated using a consensus estimate from all analysts who have published their expectations. This wisdom of the crowd approach typically leads to more accurate estimates.\nHow to calculate it\nHow to calculate forward P/E\nThe formula for calculating a forward P/E ratio is very straightforward.\nForward P/E = Current share price / Estimated future earnings per share\nThe hard part is determining the estimated earnings per share. Several resources provide consensus estimates from Wall Street analysts for big companies. Some companies, however, only have a few analysts (and sometimes none) publishing estimates. In those cases it may be worthwhile to dig into the company financials, management\u2019s commentary, and build your own estimate to aggregate with the professionals.\nAs an example, let\u2019s say a stock currently trades for around $150 per share. Analysts expect it\u2019ll produce earnings per share of $6 over the next year. That stock has a forward P/E ratio of 25.\nHow to use it\nHow to use forward P/E\nCalculating the forward P/E of a stock isn\u2019t very useful in and of itself. To get something out of it, you need to calculate the forward P/E of other comparable stocks.\nComparing the forward P/E of two or more companies within the same industry can give you an idea of whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. If one stock has a P/E far greater than its peers, the stock might not be a very good deal.\nBut there are good reasons why a stock may have a high forward P/E. If analysts expect that company\u2019s earnings per share to grow significantly faster than its peers, it\u2019ll value the next 12 months of earnings far higher than a slow-growing company. That\u2019s because a stock price reflects all the future cash flows of a business, not just the next 12 months.\nIt\u2019s important to consider that a forward P/E uses earnings per share, or EPS, in the denominator. EPS is itself a ratio, which is affected by the number of shares outstanding. So, if a company has plans to buy back a large percentage of its shares outstanding through a share repurchase program, investors may be willing to pay more for its earnings today.\nRelated investing topics\nLimitations\nLimitations of forward P/E\nTo calculate a price-to-earnings ratio, a company needs to have earnings. But not every company produces positive earnings for its shareholders.\nEarly-stage growth companies often produce losses, but their operations show strong potential for earnings at some point in the future. While they invest to grow the business, leverage their fixed operating expenses, and move toward profitability, their stocks technically trade for a negative P/E ratio.\nProfit\nEven when those companies start to make a profit, their relatively minuscule profits relative to the number of shares outstanding can lead to P/E ratios with triple or even quadruple digits. Those valuations aren\u2019t useful for an investing thesis, and forward P/E falls flat in those cases.\nInvestors will be better off finding a different valuation metric to compare growth stocks that are still generating losses for investors. Just because they have extremely high or non-existent forward P/E ratios doesn\u2019t make them bad investments."

      "text": "In a little over a week, investors will cross the finish line for what looks to be another phenomenal year for Wall Street. As of the closing bell on Dec. 19, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, widely followed S&P 500, and growth stock-driven Nasdaq Composite had respectively gained 12%, 23%, and 29% on a year-to-date basis.\nWhile the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has been the undisputed top catalyst behind Wall Street's outperformance in 2024, investor euphoria for companies enacting stock splits has played a very close second fiddle.\nA stock split is a tool publicly traded companies can utilize to adjust their share prices and outstanding share counts by the same factor. A company's market cap and underlying operating performance are unaffected by a split.\nStock splits come in two forms -- forward and reverse -- with investors overwhelmingly favoring the former. A forward stock split reduces a company's share price to make it more nominally affordable for retail investors who aren't able to buy fractional shares through their brokers.\nGenerally, companies completing forward splits have consistently out-innovated their competition, which a rising share price tends to indicate.\nThis outperformance for stock-split stocks isn't lost on Wall Street's brightest money managers. As we prepare to barrel into 2025, billionaires are piling into two prominent stock-split stocks.\nBroadcom\nThe first stock-split stock that two top-notch billionaire money managers want to own as we head into 2025 is the premier company in artificial intelligence (AI)-networking solutions, Broadcom (AVGO 1.30%). Broadcom completed its first-ever split (10-for-1) in mid-July.\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management, who oversees nearly $27 billion in assets under management, purchased 1,488,666 shares of Broadcom during the September-ended quarter. Meanwhile, Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office opened a new position totaling 239,980 shares.\nThe lure for billionaire asset managers is that Broadcom's AI-networking solutions are the preferred choice for businesses. Its Jericho3-AI fabric can connect up to 32,000 graphics processing units (GPUs) to maximize their computing capabilities and minimize tail latency. Reducing lag/response time is especially important when AI-driven software and systems are making split-second decisions and running generative AI solutions.\nIn fiscal 2024, which ended on Nov. 3, Broadcom generated $12.2 billion in AI sales. Over the next three years, CEO Hock Tan believes its three largest hyperscale customers could spend between $60 billion and $90 billion on custom AI chips, which would give it a sustainable double-digit sales growth runway.\nHowever, Laffont and Druckenmiller might also appreciate that Broadcom is far more than just an AI stock. Although artificial intelligence solutions account for the lion's share of its current growth, a significant portion of Broadcom's revenue comes from providing wireless chips for next-generation smartphones. It's also a key player in cybersecurity solutions and provides a laundry list of optical components and sensors to the industrial sector.\nAs I've stated previously, if an artificial intelligence bubble were to take shape and burst, Broadcom would be better-positioned than direct players like Nvidia to deal with the outcome.\nPerhaps the one question for Broadcom to answer in 2025 is: Has its stock has come too far, too fast?\nShares of the company are valued at close to 20 times trailing-12-month (TTM) sales, which is well above its average multiple to TTM sales over the last five years of 8.2. Annual growth rates, which are forecast in the mid-teens, might not leave much (if any) room for additional upside next year.\nSuper Micro Computer\nThe second stock-split stock that at least one prominent billionaire fancies ahead of the new year is customizable rack server and storage-solutions company Super Micro Computer (SMCI -1.62%). Supermicro completed its first-ever split (also 10-for-1) at the end of September.\nPerhaps it's no coincidence that Supermicro's buyer was Coatue Management's Philippe Laffont. His fund places an emphasis on cutting-edge growth stocks, and the 241,610 shares of Supermicro that were purchased by Coatue in the third quarter is consistent with this theme.\nJust as Broadcom has become the premier option in AI networking, Super Micro Computer has ascended the ranks as a top option for data center infrastructure. The company's customizable rack servers incorporate Nvidia's computationally superior GPUs, which has only enhanced demand for its products.\nIn early August, Super Micro reported close to $15 billion in net sales for fiscal 2024 (ended June 30), which represented sales growth of 110% from the previous year. Based on Wall Street's current consensus, sales for the company may double to $30 billion by fiscal 2026.\nAlthough Super Micro Computer appears ideally positioned to benefit from the rise of AI, it's a stock-split stock that carries more risk than most.\nIn late August, noted short-seller Hindenburg Research released a report that alleged Super Micro had engaged in \"accounting manipulation, sibling self-dealing, and sanctions evasion.\" Following the release of this report, the company has delayed the filing of its fiscal 2024 annual report, seen its accounting firm Ernst & Young resign after previously raising concerns about internal controls at Supermicro, and is reportedly being probed by U.S. regulators, per The Wall Street Journal.\nIf there's a silver lining here, it's that an independent special committee expects no financial restatements. But until the company's new auditor signs off on its financial statements, and those statements are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, there's an undeniable grey cloud hovering above Super Micro Computer.\nWhile it's possible Laffont could have nabbed himself a bargain for 2025, I suggest erring on the side of caution and keeping your distance until there are more definitive answers."

      "text": "It's time to peer into the heart of computer hardware to understand an essential component: the GPU. Don't worry; this won't get too technical, but understanding this term could be instrumental for your tech investments.\nWhat is a GPU?\nWhat is a GPU?\nGPU stands for \"graphics processing unit.\" This computer chip is the brain behind every visual element that your computer displays. From the colorful graphs in your stock analysis software to the latest blockbuster movie streaming on your 4k screen, the GPU is hard at work turning digital data into visible pixels.\nYou'll occasionally see the terms GPU and graphics card used as metonyms for one another. That's a useful shorthand, but not exactly right. The two pieces of hardware are closely related, and you can't make a graphics card without a GPU. So when the two terms are conflated into a single concept, it sort of makes sense. Still, they are not the same thing, technically speaking.\nThe GPU is the most important chip on a fully realized graphics card. Besides the GPU, this card also contains memory chips, a cooler, and other components. You'll also typically find them equipped with a few HDMI or DisplayPort connectors, from which the right cable can transfer the generated graphics data to a monitor (or three). Think of the graphics card as a fully functional car with the GPU being the engine powering it.\nWhy should you care about the GPU?\nWhy should you care about the GPU?\nNow, you might wonder why an investor needs to know about GPUs. Well, consider this: The same number-crunching horsepower that makes these chips so good at generating high-quality graphics in real time is also the best solution for many other high-performance computing tasks. The leading GPU designers, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.15%) and Nvidia (NVDA -0.24%), have moved beyond the basic market for graphics cards to explore a wider range of heavy-duty computing opportunities.\nThe hardware used in these applications is usually not consumer-grade graphics cards but specialized computing products with lots of memory and one or more GPU chips but no ports for display output. In this form, GPUs are crucially important in several high-growth technology sectors, from video games and virtual reality to artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency mining.\nGPUs have become especially essential in the AI market. Unlike CPUs (central processing units) that are great at doing a few things at once, GPUs excel at doing many things simultaneously, making them ideal for training AI models that need to process vast amounts of data quickly.\nTime to take action\nTime to take action\nKnowing about GPUs and their role in driving key technology sectors can be a real game-changer for investors. Pay attention to tech companies that design and manufacture GPUs (like Nvidia and AMD), but also to firms that rely on GPUs in their technology. For example, the GPU is of central importance to AI startups, gaming companies, and some cryptocurrency platforms.\nCrypto mining on GPUs isn't as popular as it once was. Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) miners are better off using special-purpose mining chips instead, and most GPU-based mining moved to Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) many years ago.\nBut Ethereum's platform upgrade, completed in the spring of 2023, took mining out of the equation entirely. After that game-changing shift, GPU-powered crypto mining has to work with altcoins such as Ethereum Classic (ETC -1.42%), Ravencoin (RVN -0.89%), Monero (XMR 0.25%), and Zcash (ZEC -1.52%).\nThese alternatives are not as robust as Bitcoin and Ethereum, and it can be difficult to trade the not-so-popular coins you're mining. So mining crypto with a GPU isn't the name of the game anymore, but crypto usage could make a comeback, and you should be aware of this sub-market's interesting history.\nUnderstanding the GPU also empowers you when assessing the effects of market events. For instance, a global chip shortage could affect GPU manufacturers, potentially driving up prices, which would ripple through sectors that rely on GPUs.\nRelated investing topics\nThe GPU in action: Training the ChatGPT system\nThe GPU in action: Training the ChatGPT system\nTo truly illustrate the importance of GPUs, let's turn to the realm of artificial intelligence. In particular, we'll look at OpenAI's large language models, GPT-3 and GPT-4. Both are powered by a large-scale machine learning model trained on a wealth of internet text, and the resulting large language models (LLMs) power the popular ChatGPT application.\nBut what does this have to do with GPUs?\nIt's simple. The training of these colossal models involves processing an astronomical amount of data, a task for which GPUs are uniquely qualified. The right chips can perform thousands of calculations simultaneously, making them crucial in creating these language models in a reasonable timeframe.\nOne of the key players in the GPU market, Nvidia, has been particularly instrumental in this development. The Nvidia A100, V100, and H100 Tensor Core GPUs, for instance, offer incredible acceleration at every scale for AI training and inference. Thanks to the AI training performed on these high-powered GPUs, the GPT-4 AI system can analyze and understand text on a near-human level.\nAMD has its Radeon Instinct accelerators designed specifically for machine learning and AI workloads. Their GPUs are also widely used across the tech industry, powering advancements in AI and machine learning. With just a handful of exceptions to the rule, almost all of the world's most powerful supercomputers were built around either Nvidia or AMD AI-oriented GPUs.\nThe deployment of these GPUs isn't limited to a shadowy server farm either. They are hard at work in everyday applications like ChatGPT, where users interact with the AI models in real time. This practical application of GPU technology shows how integral they are to advancements in AI, affecting both businesses and consumers.\nSo understanding the role of GPUs isn't just a tech concern. This understanding directly relates to evaluating companies that manufacture GPUs, like Nvidia and AMD, and businesses that heavily use them, such as OpenAI. Knowing the basic facts about GPUs will help you make more informed predictions about these companies' performance and their impact on the tech industry."

      "text": "Computers excel at crunching numbers but not at tasks that many people do with ease, like language processing, visual perception, object manipulation, reasoning, planning, and learning. Artificial intelligence (AI), including its offshoots of deep learning and machine learning, uses computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as language generation and facial recognition.\nAI stocks are shares of companies that are developing or employing AI technology as part of their business. AI stocks span sectors like semiconductors, software, and even beyond tech, representing companies that are using AI in ways that set them apart from their peers.\nHow AI is used\nHow do companies use artificial intelligence?\nArtificial intelligence, or AI, is created through machine learning, which involves training a system on vast amounts of data. It then uses the trained system to make inferences about data it's never seen.\nThe simplest example is a system designed to detect objects in images. Images containing those objects are provided to the system, which \"learns\" how to detect them in other images. The more objects it detects in images, the more accurate the detection system becomes.\nCompanies employ AI in two main ways. Many tech companies use it to make their existing operations more powerful through high-profile applications like robotics, self-driving cars, and virtual assistants.\nFor instance, AI is used by Alphabet (GOOGL 9.0%) (GOOG 8.93%) subsidiary Google to filter spam in Gmail, by Amazon (AMZN 0.17%) to recommend products to customers, and by Netflix (NFLX 0.86%) to guide content creation and recommendations.\nMore recently, OpenAI's ChatGPT has shown how far generative AI -- a division of artificial intelligence capable of generating texts, images, sounds, and ideas -- has come. It can answer questions directly, write poems, and has even passed bar and medical exams.\nIt has spawned a wave of new generative AI chatbots, including Anthropic's Claude, Alphabet's Gemini, and Meta Platforms' (META 0.25%) Meta AI. The potential is enormous.\nThe next frontier for generative AI is AI agents or agentic AI. This technology allows AI to perform and complete whole tasks without being prompted. For instance, an automated customer service agent that could handle a request without needing human assistance would be agentic AI. Salesforce's (CRM 1.62%) AgentForce is one example of a new agentic AI tool.\nSome companies also profit directly from AI by selling hardware, software, services, or expertise that the technology requires. These are true AI stocks and include those listed and described below.\n5 top AI stocks\n5 AI stocks to buy in 2025\n| Company | AI Focus |\n|---|---|\n| Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) | Data center GPUs and superchips |\n| Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) | Generative AI and self-driving cars |\n| Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Memory chips for data centers and generative AI tools |\n| CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV) | Generative AI-focused cloud infrastructure platform |\n| Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) | AI chatbots, LLMs, and wearable devices |\n1. Nvidia\nLeading graphics processing unit (GPU) company Nvidia has taken advantage of the AI boom, with its GPUs becoming the de facto standard in data centers worldwide. Generative AI's training phase demands a lot of computing power; the phase that follows, the inference phase, typically requires less.\nGPU chips, which were once used primarily for rendering video games, support both phases well. Nvidia's ambitions have gone beyond GPUs, as the company now aims to build AI factories or data centers full of Nvidia components to run AI applications and programming.\nNvidia's data center business now makes up the vast majority of the company's revenue, thanks to the emergence of generative AI. Because it sells the building blocks for AI infrastructure, Nvidia became the first major company to see a significant revenue boost from AI.\nRevenue surged through 2023 and 2024, and the stock has soared as well. It's been the most valuable company in the world on several occasions and was No. 1 in July 2025. It also became the first company to reach a market cap of $4 trillion. In 2024, full-year revenue jumped 114% to $130.5 billion, driven by the surge in data center demand, and growth is expected to be strong in 2025 as well.\nNvidia's chips are popular for running demanding workloads that applications like large language models (LLMs) require. The pure-play chip stock is now selling its new Blackwell platform, which major cloud infrastructure services are deploying in 2025, and demand is outstripping supply.\nSelf-driving cars and \"physical AI\" are other areas of focus. Nvidia develops hardware and software platforms that can power driver-assistance features and fully autonomous driving, which could be a significant source of revenue if that industry takes off. Automotive revenue is only a small fraction of the company's revenue, but that could change.\nWith Tesla (TSLA 1.54%) having launched its robotaxi network in Austin, the autonomous vehicle race appears to be heating up, and that should be good news for the semiconductor sector.\nA self-driving car must process massive amounts of data from multiple sensors and cameras in real time, detect objects such as pedestrians and other vehicles, and make complex decisions. They require tremendous computing power, which is exactly what Nvidia's platform delivers.\nIts professional visualization segment, which includes its omniverse, also has potential in AI. Nvidia's chipsets could someday be supplanted by more specialized processors designed for AI, but the company is in an enviable position for now.\n2. Alphabet\nAlphabet has been preparing for the AI revolution for years, acquiring the AI research lab DeepMind in 2014. It's also among the leaders in autonomous vehicles through its Waymo subsidiary, which is now ferrying passengers in its driverless cars in cities such as San Francisco and Phoenix.\nAlphabet launched Gemini -- its own AI chatbot and the latest iteration in its competition with ChatGPT -- which some see as a threat to Google Search. So far, concerns about a challenge to its search dominance seem to have been overblown, as Alphabet's ad revenue continues to grow steadily.\nThe company said that its Gemini 2.5 has been \"widely recognized as the best model in the industry.\" New features, like AI assistant and AI mode, have helped Google Search defend its market share against AI-based challenges.\nWith information at the heart of its business, it's unsurprising that the company has prioritized AI. It's rolled out AI tools for Google Cloud and Google Workspace, including a generative AI assistant that helps write emails. Even its customer acquisition strategy in the cloud is based around AI -- the company has targeted AI start-ups for its cloud infrastructure service.\nAI also plays a role in improving its search engine and YouTube, where it can pinpoint a relevant section of a video and direct users straight to it. Finally, Alphabet is ramping up spending on capital expenditures, with plans to spend $75 billion on AI infrastructure and related needs in 2025.\n3. Microsoft\nMicrosoft has gotten lots of buzz lately, thanks to its partnership with OpenAI. The tech giant began investing in the tech start-up in 2019 and invested another $10 billion in OpenAI following the launch of ChatGPT.\nMicrosoft has incorporated GPT features across its product portfolio, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service, Edge web browser, Office productivity software suite, and Copilot for Microsoft 365. Azure OpenAI has seen a particularly strong uptake, now counting more than 65% of the Fortune 500 as customers.\nCEO Satya Nadella has repeatedly said that he sees AI as the next major computing platform. The reported $13 billion investment in OpenAI is a sign of the company's conviction in AI and its belief that it needs to lead that transition or get left behind, as it did with mobile.\nMore recently, Microsoft has begun diversifying away from OpenAI. It has been adding both internal and third-party models to products like Microsoft 365 Copilot and Azure, including DeepSeek's R1.\nThe long-term implications for its relationship with OpenAI are unclear, but Microsoft seems to think it's wise to hedge its bets in the AI race. The relationship continues to evolve, but Microsoft sees the start-up's technology as critical for its AI strategy.\nMicrosoft is harnessing the power of AI in other ways, too, including automated clinical documentation in healthcare to reduce paperwork and administrative needs. It's also using Azure to allow customers to build custom AI tools. It launched Azure AI Foundry in November 2024, enabling its customers to create and manage AI apps and agents. As of April 2025, developers at more than 70,000 companies are using it.\n4. CoreWeave\nCoreWeave, which had its initial public offering (IPO) in March 2025, may be the closest thing to a pure-play AI stock on the market, and it launched the first major AI IPO. Its cloud infrastructure platform was designed specifically for AI, and it counts customers like Nvidia, OpenAI, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft as part of its core customer base. Nvidia and OpenAI are both investors in the company.\nCoreWeave has grown at an incredible pace over the last three years, going from generating almost no revenue in 2022 to $1.9 billion in 2024. Between 2022 and 2024, revenue grew by more than 100 times.\nCoreWeave's business is risky since Microsoft accounts for 62% of its revenue, meaning the business would suffer significantly if Microsoft were to pull back on spending with the platform. In its first-quarter 2025 report, CoreWeave said that no single company accounted for more than half of its backlog, a sign that its customer concentration is improving.\nThe company announced plans for a $6 billion data center in July. It's also acquiring Core Scientific, which will bulk up its AI infrastructure with 1.3 gigawatts (GW) in power capacity.\nIf you're looking for direct exposure to AI, CoreWeave is a good option since essentially all of its revenue is driven by demand for computing power to run generative AI programs. However, the stock is risky, as CoreWeave has a high debt burden, large capital expenditures, and is deeply unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles basis (GAAP).\n5. Meta Platforms\nUnlike the other big tech companies on this list, Meta Platforms doesn't have a cloud computing business, but it's investing just as much in AI as peers like Alphabet. Meta AI, the company's chatbot, is available on its apps (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) and had 1 billion monthly active users as of May. Meta continues to update its Llama large language model, which is now up to Llama 4.\nIt's also allowing its advertisers to use AI creative tools for things like background and video generation and ad copy. AI is involved in ad targeting as well, and the company aims to fully automate advertising with AI by 2026.\nAdditionally, the company is incorporating AI in its hardware division, including its Ray-Ban smart glasses, which offer a built-in camera, open-ear audio, and a range of hands-free features. Its Meta Quest headsets are also connected to Meta AI, allowing users to tap into the power of AI through the devices.\nIn June, it acquired 49% of data-labeling specialist Scale AI for $14.8 billion and brought Scale CEO Alexandr Wang on to run an AI research lab at Meta. The tech giant has also made a number of smaller acquisitions in AI. Management sees AI at the core of its business and driving its transformation across areas such as advertising, experiences, and devices.\nMachine learning\nMachine learning stocks\nAll the stocks above use machine learning technologies. However, if you're looking for even more options, here are two others worth considering:\nPalantir\nPalantir (PLTR -1.42%) has been one of the top-performing AI stocks. The company provides cloud software and specializes in data fusion that helps its customers make important insights by connecting disparate pieces of information hidden in data.\nIt also launched its AI Platform (AIP) in 2023, which has helped accelerate its growth. Palantir deploys machine learning models on top of data foundations and continuously improves them to ensure they become more useful.\nTesla\nTesla is best known for its electric vehicles (EVs). CEO Elon Musk sees AI as the future of the company, and machine learning and neural networks are very much at the center of the company's autonomous vehicle and Optimus autonomous robot projects.\nTesla introduced its driverless Cybercab in October 2024, and the company hopes to begin producing the vehicles by 2026. It launched its robotaxi network in June, though with just a handful of vehicles, and Musk envisions the company expanding to other cities in the near future. Musk has said Tesla's automation technology could make it the most valuable company in the world.\nDeep learning\nDeep learning stocks\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain. It's the most advanced kind of AI and is crucial in technologies like self-driving cars. Deep learning is advancing in areas such as preventive healthcare, where predictive algorithms are necessary. It differs from machine learning in that it doesn't require human input.\nNvidia is among the companies closely associated with deep learning. Its GPU chips use deep learning to power data centers and enable autonomous driving and cloud computing, among other functions.\nAlphabet has exposure to deep learning through a number of its businesses, including its autonomous vehicle start-up, Waymo. It also owns DeepMind, a deep learning platform that can diagnose eye diseases, predict the shapes of proteins, and accelerate the scientific discovery process.\nRelated investing topics\nA growth business\nAI is a growth business\nAccording to International Data Corporation, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to grow from $235 billion in 2024 to more than $631 billion in 2028. While the AI market is already large and still growing quickly, plenty of companies can profit from AI. Although picking stocks in a growth industry comes with a lot of uncertainty, these top AI stocks are all worth considering.\nFAQ\nArtificial intelligence stocks: FAQ\nWhat is the best AI stock to buy?\nArtificial intelligence is a fast-moving technology, and AI stocks will likely be volatile as the sector evolves. AI stocks that have attracted the most attention include Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet, but finding the best stock to buy is also a matter of price and valuation, which changes quickly.\nIs it good to buy Nvidia stock?\nNvidia has jumped into the lead among semiconductor companies in making AI chips and accelerators, and it has the competitive advantages to help it stay there. The semiconductor sector can also be highly cyclical, and pricing can change rapidly.\nAdditionally, there's the potential for unexpected surprises, such as the DeepSeek launch, which sent AI stocks like Nvidia plunging. If Nvidia can maintain its lead in AI chips, the stock should continue to be a winner, but it will likely be volatile since the AI landscape is still developing.\nWhat is the biggest AI company?\nCurrently, the biggest company that has made AI central to its business model is Nvidia, with a market cap that has soared past $4 trillion. The tech giant is at the center of the AI revolution, with components that are fueling AI applications and in high demand by major cloud infrastructure companies and others.\nIs AI good for investing?\nArtificial intelligence is likely to shake up the economy and the business world, creating opportunities in the stock market. Whether AI is good for investing will depend on the company, but there will be winners from the new technology.\nWhat company is No. 1 in AI?\nCurrently, Nvidia is broadly considered the leader in AI technology. The company has a monopoly-like market share in the data center GPU market, and its revenue has more than tripled since ChatGPT launched. Nvidia isn't guaranteed to remain the leader, though. Competition is on the way, and new technologies can change quickly.\nWill AI start-ups challenge tech giants?\nTech giants aren't feeling a significant threat from start-ups yet, but there are some signs that competition is on the rise. Alphabet stock, for example, fell when Apple said it was considering making AI search engines available on Safari, directly competing with Google.\nThe tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft also show that start-ups could begin to pose more of a threat to the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, though they are unlikely to derail their growth."

      "text": "For more than two years, Wall Street had been in a virtually unstoppable bull market. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI), the resilience of the U.S. economy, and excitement surrounding stock splits in some of Wall Street's most-influential businesses all played key roles in sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI -0.05%), S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.51%), and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC 1.02%) to new heights.\nBut the stock market wouldn't be a \"market\" without the ability for equities to move in both directions.\nThe last seven weeks have not been smooth sailing for Wall Street or investors. Since the S&P reached its all-time closing high on Feb. 19, the ageless Dow, benchmark S&P 500, and growth-focused Nasdaq Composite have respectively fallen by 14.9%, 17.6%, and 22.2%, as of the closing bell on April 7.\nHowever, the decline in stocks really picked up to close out the previous week. On April 3 and April 4, the S&P 500 cumulatively lost 10.5% of its value, which marked the fifth biggest two-day decline in the index since 1950.\nWith investors' emotions running high, many are looking to historical data points and correlative events for guidance. Though there's no indicator that can guarantee short-term directional moves for the stock market, history is quite clear what happens next for stocks after two-day wash-out events.\nWhy is the stock market crashing?\nBefore digging into the historical data that's likely to turn investors' frowns upside down, let's tackle how we got to where we are now. In other words, why did Wall Street plunge into a correction?\nThe obvious answer is that uncertainty caused by President Donald Trump's tariff policy is to blame.\nOn April 2, the president unveiled his \"Liberation Day\" tariff policy, which entails a sweeping 10% global tariff, as well as select reciprocal tariffs on countries that have historically run unfavorable trade imbalances with the U.S.\nTrump believes tariffs will generate revenue for America, protect U.S. jobs, and encourage domestic production. Additionally, the use of tariffs opens the door for the renegotiation of trade deals that currently may not be in America's best interests.\nUnfortunately, tariffs aren't as cut-and-dried as President Trump makes them appear. A lack of differentiation between input and output tariffs, for instance, is a dangerous game to play with the U.S. economy. Output tariffs are an added tax placed on finished goods imported into the country. Meanwhile, an input tariff is a tax placed on a good used to complete a finished product domestically. Input tariffs run the risk of increasing the prevailing rate of inflation during a period of slower growth for the U.S. economy.\nBut the fifth largest two-day decline in stocks isn't entirely due to Trump's tariff policy. Some semblance of blame also lies with the stock market's being historically pricey.\nThe S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) Ratio, which is also known as the cyclically adjusted P/E Ratio (CAPE Ratio), entered 2025 at the third-highest premium during a bull market when back-tested 154 years. It peaked at a multiple of 38.89 in December 2024, which compares to an average multiple of 17.23 since January 1871.\nLooking back 154 years, there have only been a half-dozen occasions, including the present, where the S&P 500's Shiller P/E surpassed 30 and held that level for at least two months. The former five occurrences all resulted in a loss of value of between 20% and 89% in one or more of Wall Street's major stock indexes losing between 20% and 89%.\nThis is a roundabout way of saying that investors are unwilling to tolerate outsize stock valuations over an extended period.\nWhen the S&P 500 crashes, it's a surefire buying opportunity, per history\nWith a better understanding of what's driven the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite to jaw-dropping losses recently, let's allow history to take center stage.\nAccording to data aggregated by Creative Planning's Chief Market Strategist Charlie Bilello, the 10-biggest two-day percentage declines in the benchmark S&P 500 since 1950 have ranged from 9% to 24.6%. As noted, the 10.5% decline from April 3 to April 4 slotted in as the fifth largest drop.\nBut what's far more important is the total return potential, including dividends, of the broad-based index following these sizable declines.\nAs you'll note in the following post on social media platform X by Bilello, every single instance where the S&P 500 endured a decline of at least 9% over a two-day period eventually led to significant gains over the next year, three years, and five years.\nThe S&P 500 fell 10.5% over the last 2 trading days which was the 5th biggest 2-day decline since 1950.\n-- Charlie Bilello (@charliebilello) April 5, 2025\nWhat has happened in the past following the biggest 2-day declines?\nStocks were substantially higher over the next 1, 3, 5 years every time.https://t.co/l5IYmkeySJ pic.twitter.com/GrjMqj9VLo\nOn average, the S&P 500 was up:\n- 31.8% on a total return basis one year later.\n- 50.2% on a total return basis three years later.\n- 121.9% on a total return basis five years later.\nTo put this into context, the average annual return from 1957 through March 2023 for the S&P 500 was roughly 10.5%. Historic declines in the benchmark index have paved the way for truly outsize return potential.\nWidening the lens a bit further demonstrates just how much of an ally time in the market can be for patient investors.\nEvery year, the analysts at Crestmont Research refresh a published data set that calculates the rolling 20-year total returns of the S&P 500 dating back to the start of the 20th century. This published data set examines 106 rolling 20-year periods (1900-1919, 1901-1920, 1902-1921, through 2005-2024).\nWhat Crestmont discovered was that all 106 periods produced a positive annualized return. In easy-to-understand terms, if you had, hypothetically, purchased an S&P 500 tracking index anywhere between 1900 and 2005 and held your position for 20 years, you generated a profit 100% of the time. It didn't matter if you held through a depression, recession, war(s), a pandemic, or various stock market crashes -- patience paid off every single time.\nAlthough the recent stock market crash has been scary, history strongly suggests it's an open invitation for long-term investors to put their money to work."

      "text": "Roughly 30 years ago, the advent and proliferation of the internet began positively altering the growth arc for corporate America. The internet offered businesses new ways to interact with prospective and existing clients, as well as market their products. For decades, investors have been waiting for the next technological leap forward, and the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution looks to be it.\nThe combination of increased productivity and consumption-side effects associated with the rise of AI is expected to increase global gross domestic product by $15.7 trillion come 2030, according to analysts at PwC. This sky-high addressable market is the primary reason we've witnessed Wall Street's AI darlings -- Nvidia (NVDA -0.24%), Palantir Technologies (PLTR -1.42%), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.12%), which is commonly known as \"AMD\" -- soar since 2023 began.\nNvidia's Hopper (H100) and Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs) account for the bulk of the GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers. Meanwhile, production for AMD's Instinct series AI-accelerating chips is expanding, with the expectation that it'll carve out a healthy share of the AI-GPU market for enterprise data centers.\nAs for Palantir, its AI- and machine learning-powered software-as-a-service Gotham and Foundry platforms offer sustainable moats. Federal governments turn to Gotham for military mission planning and execution, along with data collection and analysis. Meanwhile, Foundry is a subscription-driven platform for businesses looking to make sense of their big data and streamline/automate their operations.\nWhile their respective share price appreciation indicates everything is going great for Nvidia, Palantir, and AMD, all three companies have, collectively, offered up a nearly $13 billion warning to Wall Street. The real question is: Are you, or any other investors, heeding this warning?\nNvidia, Palantir, and AMD combine for close to a $13 billion warning\nThere are a number of potential headwinds that can come into play for AI stocks over the coming quarters and years, some of which I'll touch on a bit later. However, one of the more front-and-center concerns has to do with the how corporate insiders have approached their company's stock.\nHere's the good news: Thanks to required Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, investors have the ability to track the purchasing and selling activity of executives and board members. This activity details the buying and selling of common stock, as well as options activity.\nWhen it comes to Nvidia, Palantir, and AMD, there's been a very clear trend over the last five years (note: Palantir's initial public offering was Sept. 30, 2020): insider selling.\nOver the trailing-five-year period, net selling activity has totaled:\n- More than $4.71 billion for Nvidia.\n- Over $7.43 billion for Palantir.\n- Approximately $762 million for AMD.\nCollectively, the insiders of these three highly influential AI businesses have sold north of $12.9 billion worth of their common stock over the trailing half-decade.\nHowever, insider selling isn't as cut-and-dried as it might appear on the surface. This is to say there are a lot of reasons insiders might sell their company's stock -- and they're not all nefarious.\nFor instance, most executives receive stock-based compensation and/or options. Options are required to be exercised within a certain time frame, otherwise they expire worthless. With some executives receiving the lion's share of their compensation in stock or options, they have to sell their company's stock to cover their federal and/or state tax bill. The key point here is that not all insider selling is necessarily bad.\nBut at the same time, there's only one reason executives and board members purchase their company's stock: they expect it to head higher. Over the trailing five-year period, executives and board members have made exactly one purchase at Nvidia, one purchase at Palantir, and two purchases at AMD.\nThe takeaway here is simple: if insiders at Nvidia, Palantir, and AMD aren't willing to purchase their own company's stock, why should everyday investors believe these three stocks still offer significant upside?\nInsider activity isn't the only concern\nUnfortunately, this nearly $13 billion warning isn't the only worry for investors. Historical precedent is a multipronged headwind that has the potential to meaningfully drag down AI stock valuations.\nTo preface the following discussion, history is never guaranteed to repeat on Wall Street. If there was an indicator that concretely guaranteed short-term directional moves in stocks, you can rest assured that everyone would be using it by now.\nNevertheless, there are historical events and metrics that have flawlessly correlated with directional moves for the S&P 500 and Wall Street's other major indexes in the past. It's these correlations that suggest Nvidia, Palantir, and AMD could be in a world of trouble.\nFor example, every game-changing innovation since (and including) the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s has endured a bubble-bursting event fairly early in its expansion. This long line of hyped innovations navigating their way through bubbles signals that investors consistently overestimate the utility and early stage adoption of new technologies.\nAlthough spending on AI infrastructure has been robust, as Nvidia's and AMD's operating results suggest, most businesses have yet to optimize their AI solutions or generate a positive return on their AI investments. It's unlikely that artificial intelligence will avoid the fate of previous next-big-thing trends.\nThe other area where historical precedent comes into play is valuations. Though AMD's valuation isn't egregiously high, the same can't be said for Nvidia or Palantir, which are butting heads with history.\nBefore the bursting of the dot-com bubble a quarter of a century ago, businesses on the leading edge of the internet revolution consistently peaked at around 30 to 40 times trailing-12-month sales. As of this writing on Aug. 12, Nvidia is tipping the scales at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of nearly 31, while Palantir's P/S ratio is 137, which is the highest I've ever witnessed for a megacap company in 27 years of investing.\nWhile both companies offer competitive advantages that are worthy of valuation premiums, history is quite clear that extended premiums of this magnitude aren't sustainable over the long run.\nBetween persistent insider selling, a virtual lack of insider buying, and mounting historical headwinds, the risk-versus-reward pendulum for Nvidia, Palantir, and AMD has undeniably swung toward \"risk.\""

SEC filings are available to the public and provide a level of transparency that helps prevent financial abuse and allows investors to stay informed.\nIn particular, the SEC Form 13F provides valuable insights into the stocks and other equities and financial instruments owned and managed by companies and individuals.\nWhat is it?\nUnderstanding the SEC Form 13F\nInstitutional investment managers are required to submit a 13F form to the SEC if they hold or manage more than $100 million in securities that fall under the agency's 13F category. These securities include shares of stocks that trade on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).\nThe category also includes shares of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and closed-end investment companies. Convertible debt securities, equity options, and warrants are also reported in some cases.\nWho must use it?\nWho has to submit 13F forms?\nInvestment conglomerates, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, and individual investment advisors are all subject to 13F filing requirements if they hold more than $100 million in relevant securities. Businesses holding large investment portfolios are also considered institutional investment managers. Even companies operating outside the financial services space must submit quarterly 13F filings.\nFor example, Nvidia (NVDA -0.24%) began submitting publicly available 13F forms to the SEC in 2024. Interest in artificial intelligence (AI) helped push the value of the company's stock portfolio above $100 million, so the semiconductor specialist had to submit the disclosure filing to the agency. Because of Nvidia's highly influential position in the AI revolution, the disclosure of its investments helped create additional bullish momentum for some stocks it owned.\nInstitutional Investor\nImportance\nWhy are 13F forms important for investors?\nRetail investors can use 13F filings to track Wall Street's biggest players. Due to their size and resources, institutional investors enjoy significant advantages in the stock market. While 13F forms are submitted to the SEC only on a quarterly basis, these filings offer the average investor a window into the strategies of the world's most successful investment companies and individual asset managers.\nThe 13F disclosures can also substantially impact the valuation of individual stocks and the market at large. These filings show the stocks that Wall Street's most high-profile investment managers are buying and selling, and this information can help shape market sentiment.\nAn example\nAn example of the 13F form in action\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.21%)(BRK.B -0.01%) is one of the world's largest and most successful companies. Led by CEO Warren Buffett, the company owns a stock portfolio worth hundreds of billions of dollars and a long list of fully and partially owned subsidiary businesses. Buffett's investment conglomerate submits a publicly available 13F form to the SEC after each quarter, and its holdings disclosures are watched closely in the financial world.\nRelated investing topics\nMany investors pay close attention to Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly 13F filings because they reveal which stocks the investment company bought and sold in the previous quarter and how much cash and fixed income investments it owned. By tracking which stocks Buffett's company owns, investors can observe and replicate the strategies of one of the world's most successful financial conglomerates.\nMonitoring Berkshire's cash pile and whether the company has been a net buyer or seller of stocks can also provide insight into how Buffett and his team of analysts feel about the health of the overall stock market."

      "text": "The month of August has been chock-full of important data releases. The inflation and jobs report from the federal government, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's highly anticipated speech at Jackson Hole, and earnings releases from many of Wall Street's most influential businesses have deluged investors with information. It's also made it easy for something of importance to slip through the cracks.\nFor instance, Aug. 14 marked the deadline for institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management (AUM) to file Form 13F with U.S. regulators. A 13F offers a concise snapshot of which stocks Wall Street's shrewdest money managers bought and sold in the latest quarter (in this case, the quarter ended June 30).\nAlthough billionaire Warren Buffett has earned quite the following on Wall Street, he's not the only billionaire fund manager with a keen eye for value. Duquesne Family Office's billionaire boss Stanley Druckenmiller is also known for his outsize returns and ability to snag amazing deals.\nWhat's particularly interesting about Druckenmiller has been his trading activity within the artificial intelligence (AI) space. Over the previous year, based on 13F filings covering trading activity from July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025, Duquesne's investment guru sent Wall Street's two top-tier AI stocks, Nvidia (NVDA -0.24%) and Palantir Technologies (PLTR -1.42%), to the chopping block. But at the same time, he purchased shares of an essential AI titan for four consecutive quarters and made it a top-five holding.\nNvidia and Palantir were shown the door by billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller\nAs of the midpoint of 2024, Duquesne's billionaire chief was overseeing $2.9 billion in AUM spread across 64 holdings. This included 214,060 shares of Nvidia, following its 10-for-1 forward split in June 2024, as well as 769,965 shares of Palantir. By March 31, 2025, both of these holdings were completely exited.\nThe logical explanation for selling two of the hottest AI stocks on the planet is that Druckenmiller was locking in gains. The average stock for Duquesne Family Office has been held for less than seven months, which suggests its billionaire investor isn't afraid to cash in his fund's chips when the opportunity presents itself.\nShares of Nvidia have catapulted higher by roughly 1,120% since the end of 2022, as of the closing bell on Aug. 22. Its AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the preferred choice by businesses to deploy in their AI-accelerated data centers. Strong ongoing demand for AI-GPUs, coupled with Nvidia's well-defined compute advantages, have allowed it to charge a premium for its hardware.\nMeanwhile, Palantir's stock has gained well over 2,300% during the same time frame. Its AI and machine learning-fueled Gotham platform, which assists federal governments with military mission planning and oversight, has done a lot of the heavy lifting. With no clear one-for-one replacement for Gotham, and no true competition to its enterprise subscription Foundry platform at scale, Palantir has commanded quite the valuation premium.\nWhat might be of concern to Nvidia and Palantir shareholders is if Druckenmiller sent these stocks packing for reasons that go beyond profit-taking.\nAs an example, Druckenmiller opined in May 2024 that \"AI might be a little overhyped now, but under-hyped long term.\" Duquesne's billionaire boss astutely recognizes that every next-big-thing trend over the last 30 years has endured an eventual bubble-bursting event early in its expansion phase. In other words, investors have a propensity to overshoot when it comes to early utility and adoption rate expectations. This eventually leads to lofty expectations that aren't met and the bursting of the bubble.\nNo company has benefited more from the AI revolution than Nvidia. If a bubble were to form and burst, there's little question its shares would feel the impact. Though Palantir's multiyear government contracts and subscription revenue would protect it from an immediate revenue drop-off, poor investor sentiment during a bubble-bursting event would still, likely, weigh on its shares.\nValuation is another catalyst that may have enticed Druckenmiller to sell. Nvidia and Palantir are trading at respective price-to-sales (P/S) ratios of 30 and 117. Historically, businesses on the front line of a game-changing innovation have peaked at P/S ratios of 30 to 40. In short, Nvidia and Palantir are priced for perfection.\nDuquesne's billionaire boss has purchased this trillion-dollar AI stock in four straight quarters\nAlthough Druckenmiller remains skeptical of some of the companies leading the evolution of AI over the short run, there is one essential artificial intelligence stock that he simply can't stop buying for his fund. Duquesne's 13Fs show buying activity spanning four consecutive quarters for trillion-dollar chip fabricator Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 1.34%), which is best-known by its abbreviation, \"TSMC.\"\nHere's a breakdown of Druckenmiller's buying activity of TSMC over the previous year:\n- Q3 2024: 57,355 shares purchased\n- Q4 2024: 50,160 shares purchased\n- Q1 2025: 491,265 shares purchased\n- Q2 2025: 166,305 shares purchased (765,085 total shares held)\nIn just one year, TSMC has become a top-five holding for Duquesne's now greater-than-$4 billion investment portfolio.\nThe obvious allure of Taiwan Semiconductor is the role it's playing in AI chip manufacturing. Its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) technology is essential for the packaging of high-bandwidth memory needed for AI-accelerated data centers. TSMC's monthly CoWoS capacity is expected to effectively double to between 65,000 units to 75,000 units by the end of 2025 from 35,000 per month in 2024. Further expansion is expected to 100,000 monthly units come 2026. This added capacity will help Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and other chipmakers ramp up sales of their AI GPUs.\nTo build on the above, TSMC is dealing with quite the backlog for its services, with some orders stretching well into 2026. Backlogged orders provide a healthy level of operating cash flow predictability.\nWhile advanced chips accounted for 60% of TSMC's net sales during the June-ended quarter, there's still plenty of opportunity outside of the AI arena. More than a quarter of its net sales trace back to chips and solutions used in next-generation smartphones. The proliferation of 5G wireless networks has led to a steady smartphone upgrade cycle.\nAnother 10% (combined) of Taiwan Semiconductor's net sales derive from Internet of Things devices and chips used in automobiles. Vehicles and household appliances becoming more reliant on technology is excellent news for TSMC.\nDuquesne's billionaire chief might also be attracted by TSMC's valuation. Though its forward-year price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21 represents a modest premium compared to recent years, TSMC's annual earnings growth rate of 20% or greater makes its forward P/E quite palatable."
