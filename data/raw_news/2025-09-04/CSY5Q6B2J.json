With the interest rate cycle likely to reverse, industrial activity should pick up and support volumes. Pricing already remains strong, and volume\n\nI have over 15 years of experience investing and have provided research services to mid-sized hedge funds with assets under management between $100 and $500 million. I also have had a brief stint as a sell-side analyst. I am now focusing primarily on managing my own money and my purpose here is to share my views and benefit from the insights of the Seeking Alpha user community. Feel free to provide your feedback on my thesis in the comment section and I would love to have a discussion even if you have a variant view. My strategy is medium-term investing in ideas where there is a catalyst to unlock value and drive upside or short selling in case there is a downside catalyst. I also like to invest in growth stories available at a reasonable price. In terms of sector preferences, I am a generalist. However, I had spent most of my professional career analyzing industrial, consumer, and technology sectors. So, this is where I usually have higher conviction while investing.\n\nAnalyst\u2019s Disclosure:I/we have no stock, option or similar derivative position in any of the companies mentioned, and no plans to initiate any such positions within the next 72 hours.
