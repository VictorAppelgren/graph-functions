      "feedback": "Actionable edit guidance (in a compact 4–6 sentence form): convert the piece into a tight executive house view, starting with a concise base-case thesis and then layering catalysts, risks, and watch items in that order; trim digressions (e.g., Cadillac Elevated Velocity) and replace them with a single, first-principles causal chain: AI productivity uplift → sector reallocation and wage dynamics → policy design/risk premia → asset pricing across autos/semis/energy. Anchor every claim to specific numbers from the sources (e.g., automation exposure ~25%, up to ~70% of task content at risk; tariff/pass-through impact ≈$3,800 per household; Ford +17% in 2025; GM ~$4B U.S. capex and >2 million units/year) and cite the exact IDs (NL5YYTLF2; SGB2PAZGK; WTNT85IPR; 22PL3Q360). Strengthen citation discipline by ensuring all critical facts map to the provided IDs and explicitly reconciling conflicts (e.g., 25% high automation exposure vs 70% task-content at risk) rather than presenting them as a single, uniform figure. Add explicit invalidation points with timing (e.g., tariff pass-through dissipates or inflates differently than expected, inflation surprises persist or recede, AI adoption slows) and a clear 0–8 week vs 2–3 quarter trigger map, plus a tight watch-list: tariff cadence, capex milestones, Elevated Velocity timing, debt trajectory, inflation prints, central-bank guidance, and oil prices. Finally, align the narrative to the horizon/style constraint by delivering a coherent, decision-useful 4–6 sentence brief rather than multi-paragraph exposition.",
