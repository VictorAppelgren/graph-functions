Shriver, 69, and Katherine\u2019s husband, Chris Pratt, were also on the trip.\nPratt, 46, showed off his ripped physique while he was shirtless on the boat sitting next to Shriver in one of the pictures.\n\u201cA perfect day \u2600\ufe0f\ud83c\udf0a,\u201d Katherine, 35, captioned her post.\nChristopher previously showed off his weight loss in June, when he and his siblings supported their dad at the \u201cFUBAR\u201d Season 2 premiere in Los Angeles.\nAt the event, Christopher wore a black suit while posing for pictures with Arnold, 78, Katherine, his sister Christina, 34, and his brother Patrick, 31.\nIn May, Christopher explained how he lost so much weight at Beacher Vitality\u2019s Happy & Healthy Summit.\n\u201cIt was a big process,\u201d he shared during the panel, explaining that in 2019 he was on a trip to Australia but couldn\u2019t do most of the activities because he was too heavy.\n\u201cI was like, \u2018I want to go skydiving.\u2019 And my friends were like, \u2018Yeah, no shot.\u2019 I was like, \u2018Yeah, I can\u2019t skydive,'\u201d he recalled.\nChristopher also explained that he tried losing weight since high school which was a \u201ctrial and error\u201d process. But once he decided to remove bread from his diet, he dropped 30 pounds.\n\u201cWeirdly enough, I gave up bread for Lent,\u201d he said during the panel. \u201cI was like, \u2018Well, if I\u2019m giving up bread, I might as well just take the opportunity and I\u2019m a good Catholic boy, so I\u2019m not going to break it.\u2019 And that was my one rule. I was like, \u2018I\u2019m not going to break Lent.\u2019 And so I lost 30 pounds just through that.\u201d\nArnold applauded Christopher\u2019s \u201cfantastic\u201d weight loss journey in an interview with The Times in June.\n\u201cThe self-discipline and the self-motivation. I always felt one day it will have to come from him \u2014 and it did,\u201d the \u201cTerminator\u201d actor said."

      "text": "Tan France appeared to respond to allegations he and his \"Queer Eye\" co-star Antoni Porowski teamed up to replace Bobby Berk with Jeremiah Brent for the makeover show's upcoming season.\nRolling Stone reported on March 5 that France and Porowski allegedly campaigned to replace Berk with their friend Brent, citing three sources with ties to the show.\nFrance posted an Instagram video on March 8 so he could \"address one point real quick.\"\n\"My former colleague getting fired had nothing to do with me trying to get my friend hired,\" France said. \"Netflix and the production companies did a full on casting. I didn't pop my friend up for the job \u2014 they ended up getting it because they were the best person for the job.\"\n\"I think they're gonna be incredible on the show, but I didn't get them hired by getting rid of somebody else,\" he continued. \"So from the horse's mouth, I'm telling you, that that's not at all how it went down. And that's all I'll say on the matter.\"\nFrance's allegation that Berk was fired from \"Queer Eye\" contradicts Berk's own comments about his departure from the show. France and Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment from TODAY.com about France's video.\nNetflix announced last month Brent would be rounding out the Fab Five for Season Nine of the show, according to Variety, following Berk's first announcement he was leaving \"Queer Eye\" in November.\nWhen the news first broke in November 2023, speculation followed as to why Berk was exiting the franchise. Fans noticed Berk unfollowed France on Instagram and speculated if the two co-stars had tension. Berk handled home renovations on the show, whereas France is in charge of personal style.\nBerk told Vanity Fair in January about the real reason he decided to part ways with the Netflix series \u2014 and whether France had anything to do with it.\n\u201cTan and I had a moment,\u201d Berk told Vanity Fair. \u201cThere was a situation, and that\u2019s between Tan and I, and it has nothing to do with the show.\"\nHe continued, \"It was something personal that had been brewing \u2014and nothing romantic, just to clarify that.\"\nLooking back on the incident, he regrets unfollowing France in the first place.\n\u201cShould I have unfollowed Tan? No,\u201d Berk said. \u201cMaybe I should have just muted him. But that day, I was angry, and that\u2019s the end of it. We became like siblings \u2014 and siblings are always going to fight.\u201d\nBerk said the two took a step forward when they both attended the Emmys earlier this month and \"embraced each other.\"\n\u201cI will always have a very special place in my heart for him and Rob (France\u2019s husband) and the kids,\" Berk said. \"I can foresee in six months or a year, Tan and I at each other\u2019s house being good. The Emmys was already the first bandage on that wound.\u201d\nA rep for Tan France declined to comment to Vanity Fair in January.\nAs far as why he's leaving \"Queer Eye\"? Berk said that he and the rest of the Fab Five crew \u2014 France, Karamo Brown, Antoni Porowski and Jonathan Van Ness \u2014 were ready to part ways with the series when their seven-cycle contract was up in September 2022.\n\u201cWe thought we were done. Mentally and emotionally, I thought we all moved on. I know I did, and I started planning other things,\" Berk recalled.\nBut then, due to the actors and writers strike that took place last year, Netflix decided to offer a new contract for four additional cycles. Berk said that he and his co-stars were seemingly on the same page at first with not signing the contract.\n\u201cWe\u2019d just assumed that the show wouldn\u2019t come back if we all didn\u2019t come back,\u201d he shared with Vanity Fair. \u201cI was like, I\u2019m not going to be having FOMO 'cause the show is not going to happen. I had become at peace with it.\u201dBut then, shortly before the contract deadline was up, Berk said that the other four Fab Five members decided to renew and that Netflix decided they could \"recast one person\" \u2014 that person being him.\nTODAY.com reached out to France, Brown, Porowski and Van Ness in January following the Vanity Fair report but did not receive a response.\nWhile Berk said that he was angry \"for a second,\" after reflecting, he came to terms with his and his co-stars' decisions.\n\"All the plans that I had made when I thought we weren\u2019t coming back, I just wasn\u2019t willing to change those,\" Berk said. \"I would have had to pump the brakes on multiple other projects that are already in process. We had mentally just prepared ourselves to move on \u2014 that\u2019s why I left.\u201d\nBerk said he was looking back on his \"Queer Eye\" time with fond memories \u2014 and how transforming a home can be a life-altering moment.\n\"Your space can really transform your life,\u201d Berk said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be rich. You don\u2019t have to be able to hire a designer. I hope that my legacy is showing that you can democratize design. Learning how to make your space work for you can be healing for you and your family.\u201d"

She was then rushed to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition.\nReedus, who has prior run-ins with the law, copped a plea deal in March 2022 after allegedly punching a woman during the San Gennaro festival in Little Italy months earlier.\nHe was eventually sentenced with a conditional discharge, which required him to stay out of trouble for a year and participate in at least five counseling sessions.\nThe accused woman beater is due back in court Tuesday."

      "text": "\u201cQueer Eye\u201d star Jeremiah Brent teased the new season of the hit Netflix makeover show will be chock-full of tearjerker moments.\n\u201cI can tell you how much I cried, which was an uncomfortable amount,\u201d Brent, the show\u2019s new interior design expert, joked to Page Six at the launch of his new collection with Crate & Kids at Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles Monday.\n\u201cI got to laugh and cry and be silly, funny and vulnerable and strong and all these different things and it was really beautiful,\u201d he exclusively told us, adding that he was immensely \u201cproud\u201d of the work they did.\nBrent, who replaced Bobby Berk earlier this year, said joining the established cast after eight seasons \u201ccouldn\u2019t have been better.\u201d\n\u201cThere was a lot of joy,\u201d he told us of filming with co-stars Tan France, Jonathan Van Ness, Antoni Porowski and Karamo Brown. \u201cI think people are going to see a really strong bond. There was a lot of chemistry, I love them. They are dear friends.\u201d\nBrent was in awe watching the four pros work during his first season on the show, which has not aired yet.\n\u201cThese four have been doing this for so long and they show up and do the work, they care. It\u2019s not BS, it\u2019s real and people\u2019s lives change because of it. So it\u2019s just really exciting to be a small part of it,\u201d he said.\nAs for his small part, which includes renovating an entire space in just three days, Brent, 39, admitted it can be \u201cbrutal\u201d and includes a lot of late nights, donuts and pizza.\n\u201cI pushed hard this season to and go further and try things,\u201d he explained. \u201cI really tried my hardest to do some really beautiful designs and I\u2019m proud of what i did.\u201d\nFilming for Season 9 of the Netflix series, which takes place in Las Vegas, wrapped in June and does not have a release date yet.\n\u201cThe post-filming mourning begins,\u201d Brent wrote on Instagram at the time alongside a carousel of behind-the-scenes photos. \u201cThese four are family. Until next time, Vegas!\u201d\nBrent\u2019s co-stars, France, Van Ness, Porowski and Brown, were all in attendance at the ritzy Hotel Bel-Air launch of the designer\u2019s new line with Crate & Kids, which was completely inspired by his and husband Nate Berkus\u2019 children, Poppy, 9, and Oskar, 6.\n\u201cAll the icons that are throughout [the pieces] are part of our story,\u201d Brent told us. \u201cFrom our dog that passed away to hummingbirds that remind me of my grandmother. All the symbols and icons in the bedding are some of the favorite characters from my children\u2019s books that we used to read to them growing up that they love.\u201d\nHe added that the symbols he chose are all \u201crooted in protection,\u201d which is important to their family.\n\u201cI wanted to create something that was sophisticated, still playful, but something that could really transition with children and families because, as you probably know, you buy one piece and then three months later the kids are over it and it changes,\u201d Brent told us. \u201cSo I wanted things that could be in your home for a long time.\u201d\nAlso at the launch of the new collaboration, which officially launched Tuesday, was \u201cModern Family\u201d star Jesse Tyler Ferguson and newly single Rachel Zoe."

No,\u201d Berk said in the Vanity Fair interview. \u201cMaybe I should have just muted him. But that day, I was angry, and that\u2019s the end of it.\n\u201cWe became like siblings \u2014 and siblings are always going to fight.\u201d\nThe Post has contacted France\u2019s rep for comment.\nBerk added that he and France took a step toward reconciliation when they saw each other at the 75th Emmy Awards on Jan. 15 in LA \u2014 and said they \u201cembraced each other.\u201d\n\u201cI will always have a special place in my heart for [France] and Rob [his husband] and the kids,\u201d Berk told Vanity Fair. \u201cI can foresee in six months or a year, Tan and I at each other\u2019s house being good.\n\u201cThe Emmys was already the first bandage on that wound.\u201d\nBerk elaborated that he and the \u201cQueer Eye\u201d crew \u2014 France, Karamo Brown, Antoni Porowski and Jonathan Van Ness \u2014 were ready to throw in the towel when their contract was up in September 2022.\n\u201cWe thought we were done. Mentally and emotionally, I thought we all moved on,\u201d he told Vanity Fair, according to Today.com. \u201cI know I did, and I started planning other things.\u201d\nAfter the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, Berk said, Netflix offered them a new contract for another four cycles \u2014 and that he figured they were all on the same page as far as leaving the show and that the network would cancel the series.\nBut France, Brown, Porowski and Van Ness decided to ink the new deal and Berk\u2019s role will be recast (as of writing this, Netflix has not announced his replacement).\nBerk said he was angry \u201cfor a second\u201d but that he now understands his former castmates\u2019 decision to return.\n\u201cAll the plans I had made when I thought we weren\u2019t coming back, I just wasn\u2019t willing to change those,\u201d he told Vanity Fair. \u201cI would have had to pump the breaks on multiple other projects that are already in process.\n\u201cWe had mentally just prepared ourselves to move on \u2014 that\u2019s why I left.\u201d"

He explained that his exit from the Fab Five stemmed from contract negotiations and a personal rift with co\u2011star Tan France, but the two have since reconciled. Netflix confirmed \"Queer Eye\" would conclude with its tenth season in Washington, D.C., while Berk\u2019s new show, executive\u2011produced by John Cena, will follow collectors as they declutter their homes.",
