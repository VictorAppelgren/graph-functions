      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits**\n\n1. **Cite every substantive claim** – the draft makes several causal assertions (e.g., “Fed’s dovish tone underpins dollar resilience”) without inline citations. Add the appropriate source IDs (e.g., XTQIQRP5K for Fed guidance, XTQIQRP5K for tariff announcements, XTQIQRP5K for Ukraine‑war risk‑off).  \n2. **Quantify the upside** – state a precise range for DXY (e.g., 0.2–0.5 % over 3–6 months) and back it with recent data (e.g., 0.36 % rise to a one‑week high, EUR/USD fell 0.27 %). Include the source ID for each figure.  \n3. **Explicitly link each catalyst to the dollar** – e.g., “U.S. CPI at 2.7 % y/y (ID XTQIQRP5K) keeps the Fed rate near 5.25 % → supports DXY.”  \n4. **Clarify the risk‑invalidation logic** – list the three risk factors and the exact market signals that would invalidate the view (e.g., CPI > 2.7 %, Fed meeting signals pause, tariff easing).  \n5. **Add a confidence rating** – state a confidence level (e.g., “moderate‑high”) and justify it with the number of aligned catalysts.  \n6. **Remove any generic or non‑evidence‑based phrasing** – e.g., “confluence of macro‑policy and geopolitical catalysts” should be replaced with specific, cited drivers.  \n7. **Ensure compliance with the “Truth > verbosity” rule** – trim any redundant sentences and keep only evidence‑driven, actionable statements.  \n\nAfter incorporating these edits, the analysis will meet the stringent Argos standards for depth, coherence, and actionable insight.",
