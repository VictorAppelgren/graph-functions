(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)\n\nMANILA, Philippines -- Asian shares rose on Friday after U.S. stocks climbed to a record as Wall Street made its final moves ahead of an update on the American job market that could clear the way for cuts to interest rates that investors love.\n\nIn Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 added 0.9% to 42,945.16 after data released Friday showed Japan's labor cash earnings rose 4.1% year-on-year in July, up from 3.1% in June. Another report showed household spending climbed 1.4% in July from the same month a year ago, marking growth for the third month in a row.\n\nPresident Donald Trump also signed an executive order Thursday implementing the U.S. trade deal with Japan in July, with lower tariffs on Japanese car imports.\n\nIn Chinese markets, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index moved up 0.5% to 25,194.85, while the Shanghai Composite index added 0.4% to 3,778.95.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi edged up less than 0.1% to 3,203.13, and Australia's S & P/ASX 200 rose 0.3% to 8,855.20.\n\nIndia's BSE Sensex was 0.2% higher, while Taiwan's Taiex jumped more than 1%.\n\nU.S. futures were higher while oil prices edged down.\n\nOn Wall Street on Thursday, the S & P 500 added 0.8% to top the all-time high it set last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 350 points, or 0.8%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 1%.\n\nStocks got some lift from easing pressure from the bond market, where Treasury yields fell following the latest reports on the U.S. job market to come in worse than economists expected. One report suggested employers, not including the government, nearly halved their hiring in August from the prior month. Another said that more workers applied for unemployment benefits last week in an indication of rising layoffs.\n\nNeither number is flashing a recession, and a third report on activity for businesses in the information and other services industries showed stronger-than-expected growth.\n\nThe upside for investors of a slowdown in the job market is that it could push the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate for the first time this year at its next meeting in a couple weeks. Such cuts can kickstart the economy and job market, though they can also accelerate inflation.\n\nSo far this year, the Fed has kept its main interest rate on hold because it\u2019s been more worried about inflation potentially worsening because of Trump\u2019s tariffs than about the job market.\n\nA more comprehensive report on the job market\u2019s health during August will arrive Friday from the U.S. Labor Department and it will likely carry much weight with the Fed. Ahead of it, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.16% from 4.22% late Wednesday.\n\nIn other dealings Friday, benchmark U.S. crude lost 13 cents to $63.35 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, slid 11 cents to $66.88 per barrel.\n\nThe U.S. dollar slipped to 148.13 Japanese yen from 148.05. The euro rose to $1.1672 from $1.1654.\n\nAP Business Writer Stan Choe in New York contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Man charged with murder in Houston door-knock prank shooting of 11-year-old boy\nThe shooting happened around 11 p.m. on Saturday in southeast Houston.\nA 42-year-old Texas man is facing a murder charge in the shooting of an 11-year-old boy after the victim and his friends banged on the suspect's door late Saturday night in what police described as a \"ding-dong-ditch\" prank that has been trending on TikTok and other social media platforms, authorities said.\nThe suspect, Gonzalo Leon Jr., was arrested and booked at the Harris County Jail on Tuesday morning, charged with one count of first-degree murder, according to Harris County court records.\nDuring his first court appearance on Tuesday, Leon asked for a court-appointed attorney. He did not entered a plea and was ordered to be held without bond, pending a bail hearing on Wednesday.\nThe shooting unfolded around 10:55 p.m. on Saturday at a home in southeast Houston, according to the Houston Police Department.\nThe child, who police initially said was 10 years old, was pronounced dead at a hospital on Sunday afternoon, according to a statement released by police. The victim was identified by police on Tuesday as 11-year-old Julian Guzman.\n\"Officers were told the male was ringing doorbells of homes in the area and running away. A witness stated the male was running from a house, after ringing the doorbell, just prior to suffering a gunshot wound,\" Houston homicide detectives said.\nIt remained unclear if Leon is the owner of the home where the door-kicking prank occurred, or whether he just lived there.\nThe prank allegedly committed in Houston is similar to what's being dubbed the \"door-kicking challenge,\" a national trend based on an old prank called \"ding dong ditch,\" in which groups of kids record videos of themselves kicking and banging on doors of homes and apartments before running away and then posting the videos on social media platforms such as TikTok.\nLeon is believed to be the same person detained by police in the immediate aftermath of Saturday's shooting. He was released after being questioned but was detained again after the child was pronounced dead at a hospital around 2 p.m. local time on Sunday, Houston police Sgt. Michael Cass said at a news conference over the weekend.\nCass said a search warrant was served on the home, and a significant number of weapons were found inside the house.\nCass said the boy who was shot in the back lived about a block from the home.\nThe victim and at least two of his friends had been going around their neighborhood banging on or kicking doors and running away, Cass said. Cass said the preliminary information indicates that the victims and his friends ran down the street after banging on the suspect's door.\nPopular Reads\n\"Our witness says the suspect came out of the door, ran out into the street and was firing down the road,\" Cass said.\nHe said the victim was able to run about a block before collapsing in the street.\n\"In my opinion, it doesn't look like any type of self-defense,\" Cass said.\nThe fatal shooting follows a string of incidents across the country associated with the door-kicking challenge on social media.\nIn July, a 58-year-old Texas homeowner was arrested and charged with aggravated assault when he allegedly fired multiple rounds at a vehicle fleeing his home in Frisco after someone banged on the front door, according to a statement from the Frisco Police Department.\nThe driver of the car that was shot at around 10:50 p.m. on July 28 and two passengers contacted police to file a complaint, showing officers three bullet holes in the vehicle, according to police.\n\"However, during subsequent interviews, all admitted to ding, dong, ditching in a random neighborhood when they were confronted by a male with a firearm,\" Frisco police said in a statement.\nIn June, police in Chandler, Arizona, released video footage of a group of juveniles committing the \"door-kicking challenge,'' alleging the group pulled the prank on the same home at least 18 times, prompting the homeowner to move out.\nThis is a developing story.

      "text": "Powell signals Fed may cut rates soon even as inflation risks remain\nPowell signals Fed may cut rates soon even as inflation risks remain\nJACKSON HOLE, Wyo. (AP) \u2014 Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday opened the door ever so slightly to lowering a key interest rate in the coming months but gave no hint on the timing of a move and suggested the central bank will proceed cautiously as it continues to evaluate the impact of tariffs and other policies on the economy.\nIn a high-profile speech closely watched at the White House and on Wall Street, Powell said that there are risks of both rising unemployment and stubbornly higher inflation. Yet he suggested that with hiring sluggish, the job market could weaken further.\n\u201cThe shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,\u201d he said, a reference to his concerns about weaker job gains and a more direct sign that the Fed is considering a rate cut than he has made in previous comments.\nStill, Powell\u2019s remarks suggest the Fed will proceed carefully in the coming months and will make its rate decisions based on how inflation and unemployment evolve. The Fed has three more meetings this year, including next month, in late October, and in December, and it\u2019s not clear whether the Fed will cut at all those meetings.\nAP correspondent Ed Donahue reports on prospects of an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve.\n\u201cThe stability of the unemployment rate and other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance,\u201d Powell said. That suggests the Fed will continue to evaluate jobs and inflation data as it decides whether to cut rates.\nThe stock market jumped in response to Powell\u2019s remarks, with the broad S&P 500 index rising 1.5% in midday trading.\n\u201cWe see Powell\u2019s remarks as consistent with our expectation of\u201d a quarter-point cut to the Fed\u2019s short-term rate at its Sept. 16-17 meeting, economists at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients. The Fed\u2019s rate currently stands at 4.3%.\nPowell spoke with the Fed under unprecedented public scrutiny from the White House, as President Donald Trump has repeatedly insulted Powell and has urged him to cut rates, arguing there is \u201cno inflation\u201d and saying that a cut would lower the government\u2019s interest payments on its $37 trillion in debt.\nTrump also says a cut would boost the moribund housing market. A rate cut by the Fed often leads to lower borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, and business borrowing, but it doesn\u2019t always.\nWhile Powell spoke, Trump elevated his attacks, telling reporters in Washington, D.C. that he would fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook if she did not step down over allegations from an administration official that she committed mortgage fraud.\nIf Cook is removed, that would give Trump an opportunity to put a loyalist on the Fed\u2019s governing board. The Fed has long been considered independent from day-to-day politics. The president can\u2019t fire a Fed governor over disagreements on interest rate policy, but he can do so \u201cfor cause,\u201d which is generally seen as malfeasance or neglect of duty.\nLater Friday, Trump told reporters, referring to Powell, \u201cWe call him too late for a reason. He should have cut them a year ago. He\u2019s too late.\u201d\nPowell spoke at the Fed\u2019s annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, a conference with about 100 academics, economists, and central bank officials from around the world. He was given a standing ovation before he spoke.\nCook, who is also attending the conference, declined to comment on the president\u2019s remarks.\nIn his remarks, the Fed chair underscored that tariffs are lifting inflation and could push it higher in the coming months.\n\u201cThe effects of tariffs on consumer prices are now clearly visible. We expect those effects to accumulate over coming months, with high uncertainty about timing and amounts,\u201d Powell said.\nInflation has crept higher in recent months though it is down from a peak of 9.1% three years ago. Tariffs have not spurred inflation as much as some economists worried, but they are starting to lift the prices of heavily imported goods such as furniture, toys, and shoes.\nConsumer prices rose 2.7% in July from a year ago, above the Fed\u2019s target of 2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 3.1%.\nPowell added that higher prices from tariffs could cause a one-time shift to prices, rather than an ongoing bout of inflation. Other Fed officials have said that is the most likely outcome and as a result the central bank can cut rates to boost the job market.\nThe Fed chair said it is largely up to the central bank to ensure that tariffs don\u2019t lead to sustained inflation.\n\u201cCome what may, we will not allow a one-time increase in the price level to become an ongoing inflation problem,\u201d he said, suggesting deep rate cuts, as Trump has demanded, are unlikely.\nRegarding the job market, Powell noted that even as hiring has slowed sharply this year, the unemployment rate remains low. He added that with immigration falling sharply, fewer jobs are needed to keep unemployment in check.\nYet with hiring sluggish, the risks of a sharper downturn, with rising layoffs, has risen, Powell said.\nPowell also suggested the Fed would continue to set its interest-rate policy free from political pressure.\nFed officials \u201cwill make these decisions, based solely on their assessment of the data and its implications for the economic outlook and the balance of risks. We will never deviate from that approach.\u201d\nPowell dedicated the second half of his speech to announcing changes to the Fed\u2019s policy framework that was issued in August 2020. The framework, which has been blamed for delaying the Fed\u2019s response to the pandemic inflation spike, provides guidelines on how the Fed would respond to changes in inflation and employment.\nIn 2020, after a decade of low inflation and low interest rates following the financial crisis and Great Recession in 2008-2009, the Fed changed its framework to allow inflation to top its 2% target temporarily, so that inflation would average 2% over time.\nAnd after unemployment fell to a half-century low in 2018, without pushing up inflation, the 2020 framework said that the Fed would focus only on \u201cshortfalls\u201d in employment, rather than \u201cdeviations.\u201d That meant it would cut rates if unemployment rose, but wouldn\u2019t necessarily raise them if it fell.\nThe Fed reviewed its framework this year and concluded that it was tied too closely to the pre-pandemic economy, which has since shifted. Inflation spiked to a four-decade high in 2022 and the Fed rapidly boosted interest rates afterward.\n\u201cA key objective has been to make sure that our framework is suitable across a broad range of economic conditions,\u201d Powell said."

      "text": "Applications for US jobless benefits rise but remain in a healthy range\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The number of Americans seeking jobless benefits rose modestly last week, suggesting that employers are still retaining workers even as the economy has showed signs of slowing.\nApplications for unemployment benefits for the week ending Aug. 30 rose by 8,000 to 237,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That\u2019s more than the 231,000 new applications economists were expecting.\nWeekly applications for jobless benefits are seen as a proxy for layoffs and have mostly settled in a historically healthy range between 200,000 and 250,000 since the U.S. began to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic nearly four years ago.\nWhile layoffs are low, hiring has also weakened as part of what many economists describe as a \u201cno hire, no fire\u201d economy. Still, the unemployment rate remains a historically low 4.2%.\nOn Wednesday, the government reported that U.S. employers were advertising 7.2 million job openings at the end of July, fewer than economists had forecast and the latest sign of weakness in the U.S. labor market.\nLast month\u2019s grim July jobs report, which showed job gains of just 73,000 and included massive downward revisions for June and May, sent financial markets spiraling.\nPresident Donald Trump fired the head of the agency that compiles the monthly data.\nThe government issues its August jobs report on Friday, with economists expecting that U.S. employers added a slim 80,000 private non-farm jobs.\nNew jobs numbers are being closely watched on Wall Street and by the Federal Reserve as the most recent government data suggests hiring has slowed sharply since this spring. Job gains have averaged just 35,000 a month in the three months ending in July, barely one-quarter what they were a year ago.\nGrowth has weakened so far this year as many companies have pulled back on expansion projects amid the uncertainty surrounding the impacts of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies. Growth slowed to a 1.3% annual rate in the first half of the year, down from 2.5% in 2024.\nThe sluggishness in the job market is a key reason that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled last week that the central bank may cut its key interest rate at its next meeting Sept. 16-17. A cut could reduce other borrowing costs in the economy, including mortgages, auto loans, and business loans.\nThe Labor Department\u2019s report Thursday showed that the four-week average of claims, which softens some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 2,500 to 231,000.\nThe total number of Americans collecting unemployment benefits for the previous week of Aug. 23 fell by 4,000 to 1.94 million."

Our deepest prayers are with the children, parents, families, educators, and Christians everywhere. We mourn with them, we pray for healing, and we will never forget them,\" Noem said in a statement.\nDriver's license information reviewed by ABC News describes Westman as a female, born on June 17, 2002.\nA name change application for a minor born on the same date was approved by a district court in Minnesota in 2020, changing the name of a Robert Westman to Robin Westman, explaining the minor child \"identifies as a female and wants her name to reflect that identification.\"\nPolice said Westman is the only suspect in this shooting. Westman does not appear to have an extensive or known criminal history, police said.\nOfficials said they are looking through information left behind to \"try to determine some type of motive\" for this shooting. The police chief told ABC News the suspect \"clearly had a deranged obsession with previous mass shooters.\"\n\"Ultimately this person committed this act with the intention of causing as much terror, as much trauma, as much carnage as possible for their own personal notoriety,\" O'Hara said.\nO'Hara said during a press conference on Thursday that the shooter \"fantasized about the plans of other mass shooters.\"\nThe chief said authorities do not believe the suspect had any previous arrests or civil commitments for mental health issues.\nMother worked at the church\nAnnunciation church shooting suspect Robin Westman's mother worked at the church until 2021, according to online posts from the church. Westman also previously attended the school, the police chief told ABC News.\nIn the name change application from 2020, Mary Grace Westman was listed as Robin Westman's mother.\nAn August 2021 post by the church, reviewed by ABC News, announced Westman's retirement after five years of service at the church.\nA 2020 post by the church's outgoing pastor described Westman as a parish secretary; a 2016 church bulletin announced her hiring as an administrative assistant in the church's business office.\nOfficials looking into YouTube videos\nOfficials are investigating a series of videos posted to YouTube believed to be associated with Westman, according to law enforcement sources familiar with the matter.\nTwo videos, posted Wednesday morning and since removed by YouTube, show someone flipping through dozens of pages of notes dated over the course of several months, which include what appears to be doodles of weapons, middle fingers, and expletives. There are also repeated references to killing.\nThe videos, which depict handwritten journals and a display of high-powered weaponry, paint a portrait of a person with a rambling and deeply nihilistic outlook, according to analyses by law enforcement and ABC News.\nThe writings in the notebooks and on the firearms, which are written in a blend of Cyrillic alphabet, English and other languages, indicate a series of grievances, anger and ideations of harm to self and to others.\nThe writings also appear to show overt references to other high-profile school shootings and shooters.\nIn one notebook, there is a sticker that says \"defend equality\" with an LGBTQIA flag, overlaid with a gun. A gun also has writings against Israel.\nTaking up a full page of a notebook is a hand-drawn birdseye view of the inside of a church with pews. The drawing appears to show the interior layout of Annunciation Church.\nIn one of the videos, the shooter refers to personal depression and apologizes to family members.\nYouTube did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News.\nSuspect worked at cannabis dispensary\nWestman was a former employee at a cannabis dispensary in the Minneapolis area for several months this year, but was not employed by the company at the time of the shooting, a spokesperson for the parent company of RISE medical cannabis dispensaries confirmed to ABC News.\n\"We are cooperating fully with law enforcement in their ongoing investigation and will provide any information that may assist their efforts. At this moment, our priority is to respect the investigative process, to extend our deepest sympathies to all those impacted, and support our team through this horrific tragedy. We will not be providing additional comment at this time,\" the RISE spokesperson said in a statement.\nWestman mentioned working at a dispensary in a journal entry in July, according to an analysis by ABC News.\nRecent breakup\nWestman's father reportedly told police that the suspect had recently broken up with a romantic partner, according to a search warrant related to the father's home.\nWestman had recently lived in Richfield, Minnesota, though \"broke-up with a significant and/or romantic partner from that premise recently,\" the warrant stated per a conversation with Westman's father.\nThe suspect had recently been staying with a friend in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, according to the warrant.\nFormer classmate says suspect showed red flags in grade school\nJosefina Sanchez, who said she was a former classmate of Westman while they were both in grade school in St. Paul, told ABC Minneapolis affiliate KSTP the shooter had few friends and odd obsessions, things she would now categorize as red flags.\n\"I knew that something was off, but I was a kid; how was I to know what to do?\" Sanchez told KSTP.\nShe told KSTP the video of Westman's journal written in a blend of Cyrillic alphabet brought back memories of the suspect writing in code so no one could understand it.\n\"It was just kinda triggering,\" Sanchez told KSTP. \"I wish I could have said something sooner, but I was little, how was I supposed to know?\"\nShooter appeared to 'hate all of us'\nU.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota Joe Thompson said the shooter's writings described his plan, mental state and \"pure, indiscriminate hate.\"\n\"The shooter's heart was full of hate,\" Thompson said.\nThompson also said the suspect was \"obsessed with the idea of killing children.\"\n\"The shooter saw the attack as a way to target the most vulnerable among us,\" Thompson said.\nOn Wednesday morning, the shooter approached the side of the church and fired the rifle through the windows toward the children and other worshipers sitting in the pews, O'Hara said. Westman was armed with a rifle, shotgun and pistol, and police believe the shooter fired from all three weapons. Police said Westman bought the weapons lawfully and they were \"purchased recently.\"\nAt the scene of the crime, three shotgun shells were recovered, along with 116 rifle rounds. One live round of ammunition was recovered from a hand gun that appeared to malfunction while the shooter was using it, police said.\nAdditional firearms are also being recovered from the residences that are \"related to the shooter,\" police said. No explosives were discovered at the scene, but a \"smoke bomb\" was located by officials, police said.\nO'Hara described the suspect as a \"coward\" and said the shooting was a \"deliberate act of violence\" that is \"absolutely incomprehensible.\"\n\"This kind of evil should never happen,\" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said.\nFrey stressed at a second news conference, \"Anybody who is using this as an opportunity to villainize our trans community, or any other community out there, has lost their sense of common humanity. We should not be operating out of a place of hate.\"\n\"Kids died today,\" he continued. \"This needs to be about them. This needs to be wrapping our arms around these families.\"\nABC News' Katherine Faulders, Aaron Katersky, Josh Margolin, Luke Barr, Mike Levine, Sasha Pezenik, Megan Christie and Tonya Simpson contributed to this report."

      "text": "Stocks add a bit to their records on Wall Street\nWall Street notched more milestones Thursday after gains in technology stocks helped push the market to another all-time high.\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.3%, lifting the benchmark index to its second record high in a row. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed an early slide and gained 0.2%, enough to move past its record high set last Friday.\nThe Nasdaq composite closed 0.5% higher, finishing just short of its all-time high set two weeks ago.\nAbout 55% of the companies in the benchmark S&P 500 closed lower, but gains in the technology and communication services sectors offset losses elsewhere in the market. Broadcom rose 2.8%, Amazon added 1.1% and Google parent Alphabet finished 2% higher.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a continuation of a theme that has been in place really all year long, and that is communication services, information technology, really the areas that are surrounding this incredible capital expenditure cycle, have been the primary beneficiaries,\u201d said Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Asset Management.\nHeading into the final day of trading in August, the S&P 500 and Dow were on pace for their fourth straight monthly gain, while the Nasdaq was closing in on its fifth.\nThe market\u2019s latest gains came as traders pored over a mixed batch of earnings reports from big U.S. companies and new reports on the job market and U.S. economy.\nTech giant Nvidia fell 0.8% a day after reporting quarterly earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street analysts\u2019 forecasts, though the company noted that sales of its artificial intelligence chipsets rose at a slower pace than analysts anticipated.\nStocks were slightly down in early trading. The AP\u2019s Seth Sutel reports.\nInvestors consider Nvidia a barometer for the strength of the boom in artificial intelligence because the company makes most of the chips that power the technology. Its heavy weighting also gives Nvidia outsized influence as a bellwether for the broader market.\nShares in several retailers fell following their latest quarterly results.\nBest Buy dropped 3.7% after the consumer electronics chain\u2019s second-quarter snapshot was overshadowed by an outlook clouded due to the tariffs the U.S. is imposing on trading partners.\nDespite also posting better-than-expected quarterly results, Urban Outfitters slid 10.7% after the retailer warned that it expects tariffs will increase pressure on its gross margins in the second half of the year.\nDick\u2019s Sporting Goods fell 4.8% despite reporting second-quarter results that beat analysts\u2019 expectations.\nVictoria\u2019s Secret & Co. gave up an early gain and closed 0.5% lower.\nBurlington Stores bucked the trend. The retail chain climbed 5.3% after its latest earnings topped analysts\u2019 estimates.\nElsewhere in the market, Spam maker Hormel sank 13.1% for the biggest decline among S&P 500 companies after its earnings fell short of Wall Street\u2019s forecasts and the company cut its outlook for the year.\nTraders also had their eye on new government reports on the job market and economy.\nThe Labor Department reported that applications for unemployment benefits fell last week, the latest sign that employers are holding onto their workers even as the economy has slowed.\nThe most recent government data suggests hiring has slowed sharply since this spring.\nMeanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that U.S. gross domestic product \u2014- the nation\u2019s output of goods and services \u2014 grew at a 3.3% annual pace in the April-June quarter after shrinking 0.5% in the first three months of this year due to the fallout from the Trump administration\u2019s trade wars.\n\u201cThe GDP print reinforces the fact that this continues to be an economy, domestically, that is continuing to show a great deal of resilience in terms of producing economic growth,\u201d Northey said.\nStill, the sluggishness in the job market is a key reason that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled last week that the central bank may cut its key interest rate at its meeting next month.\nLower rates can boost investment prices and the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow, but they risk worsening inflation.\nTraders are still betting the Fed will trim its benchmark interest rate at its next meeting in September. Traders see an 85.3% chance that the central bank will cut the rate by a quarter of a percentage point, according to data from CME Group.\nFriday will bring another update on inflation: the U.S. personal consumption expenditures index. Economists expect it to show that inflation remained at about 2.6% in July, compared with a year ago. Businesses have been warning investors and consumers about higher costs and prices because of tariffs.\nTreasury yields were mixed in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 4.21% from 4.24% late Wednesday. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Federal Reserve action, rose to 3.63% from 3.62%.\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 20.46 points to 6,501.86. The Dow added 71.67 points to 45,636.90, and the Nasdaq gained 115.02 points to close at 21,705.16.\nEuropean and Asian markets closed mixed."

  "argos_summary": "Asian shares rose as U.S. stocks hit record highs ahead of the August jobs report, boosting sentiment that the Fed may cut rates. The Nikkei gained 0.9% on stronger Japanese labor and household data, while Hong Kong, Shanghai, and other Asian markets saw modest gains. U.S. Treasury yields fell to 4.16% on expectations of a rate cut, lifting the S&P 500 to a new record. Oil prices slipped slightly, and the dollar weakened against the yen and euro. The rally reflects optimism that a softer labor market could prompt the Fed to ease policy in September.",
