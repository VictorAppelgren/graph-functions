  "description": "Two cruise giants are charting different courses but only one may be ready to conquer the high seas of your portfolio.",
  "content": "Two cruise giants are charting different courses but only one may be ready to conquer the high seas of your portfolio.\n\nAfter a brutal pandemic-induced dry dock, the cruise industry has managed to come out not just afloat, but steaming full speed ahead. For investors charting their next investment course, the choice comes down to hopping aboard Royal Caribbean (RCL 3.41%), the current captain of luxury and growth, or placing a bet on a Carnival (CCL 3.62%) comeback.\n\nBoth stocks have made strides since the COVID crash, but they're sailing in very different directions. Royal Caribbean is throwing launch parties for mega-ships, while Carnival is patching up its balance sheet and hoping for calmer waters ahead. One offers premium momentum, the other a potential value turnaround. So, which one deserves a spot in your long-term portfolio? Let's dive in.\n\nRoyal Caribbean isn't just cruising, it's making waves. The company has benefited from the post-pandemic travel boom and is seeing customers booking well into 2027. Its aggressive expansion strategy centers on a fleet of its new Icon-class ships, floating luxury hotels that are designed to command higher prices and appeal to families and upscale travelers.\n\nIn addition to its consistently strong public reception, Royal Caribbean has been navigating its finances with precision as well. While its debt ballooned during the pandemic like everyone else's, the company has made significant progress toward deleveraging. Its net debt has declined to $18.3 billion from a pandemic peak of $22 billion, and its credit profile has improved enough to earn confidence from institutional investors, including a BBB- rating from Fitch.\n\nWith an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin of 42% in Q2 2025, it's clear Royal Caribbean knows how to steer toward profitability even while expanding its fleet. And with a forward P/E ratio of roughly 20x, Royal Caribbean now trades above its pre-pandemic average of 14x, signaling investors are paying up for a chance at continued growth.\n\nCarnival: Still bailing itself out\n\nCarnival, the world's largest cruise operator, is finally seeing blue skies, but it's still got some storm clouds on the horizon. The company has made substantial progress in reducing its pandemic-era debt, aiming for a net debt reduction of $8 billion by the end of 2025. That's encouraging, but not enough to convince the rating agencies. Carnival still carries over $25 billion in net debt, and Fitch considers Carnival's debt as below investment grade, giving it a BB+ rating in June.\n\nCarnival's focus remains on stabilization rather than growth. Instead of launching glamorous new ships, it's refining operations, tightening costs, and streamlining its global footprint. That measured approach is reflected in how the market values the company today. Carnival trades at a forward P/E ratio of about 13x-almost exactly where it traded in its healthier pre-COVID years - and its EBITDA margin is 24%. Its stock is still well below pre-COVID highs, and its recovery has lagged competitors.\n\nBut if you believe in turnaround stories, Carnival could offer deep value assuming management executes, interest rates don't spike, and customer loyalty holds.\n\nWhat could sink the ship?\n\nBoth companies still face macro headwinds. Inflation has driven up operating costs across the board increasing the price of fuel, labor, and food. Even geopolitical instability can disrupt itineraries from time to time. And if interest rates stay high, debt refinancing could weigh heavily, especially for Carnival.\n\nFor Royal Caribbean, the biggest risk may be overextension. Building the world's largest cruise ships isn't cheap, and if the travel boom cools, pricing power could falter. For Carnival, the risk lies in balance sheet fatigue and brand perception. If policy changes alienate guests, it could take years to rebuild trust.\n\nWho should be your portside portfolio pick?\n\nIf you're looking for a high-end company with a clear growth plan and improving fundamentals, Royal Caribbean is your ticket. It trades at a forward P/E about 50% higher than Carnival's, reflecting its premium pricing, newer fleet, and strong demand for luxury experiences like private islands and family focused mega-ships. With 42% EBITDA margins and a rising affluent customer base, Royal has outperformed Carnival nearly twofold in 2025, climbing 53% year-to-date. At a current price of $311 and a 12-month target near $347, analysts see an approximate 10% upside if growth continues It's not cheap, but you're paying a premium that the company has rightfully earned based on its performance.\n\nCarnival, on the other hand, might appeal to the contrarian investor who believes in second acts. Its Q2 2025 EBITDA margin was almost half of Royal Caribbean's at 24%, but it trades around $29, far below its $50 to $60 pre-COVID range, suggesting a 2x long-term upside if its turnaround succeeds. With a global portfolio of brands like Princess Cruises and Holland America Line, Carnival has broad geographic reach and the flexibility to target different customer segments. And its dominance in the mass-market category and focus on budget-conscious travelers make it well-positioned if consumer spending slows. While the stock carries more risk, its comparative discounted valuation to its rival and its turnaround potential offer a compelling case for investors seeking higher long-term rewards.\n\nWhichever you choose, pack your Dramamine, as volatility might be part of the voyage.",

      "text": "Carnival (CCL 3.62%) is the largest cruise line in the world. The company operates nine cruise line brands with more than 90 ships sailing around the world.\nThe company's unique portfolio of brands caters to a diverse range of customer segments:\n- Single market mainstream: Carnival (U.S.), Aida (Germany), P&O Cruises (U.K.), P&O Cruises (Australia).\n- Regional market mainstream: Costa (Italy, France, and Spain).\n- Premium: Holland America Line (midsize ships) and Princess (large ships).\n- Luxury: Cunard.\n- Ultra luxury: Seabourn.\nYou might be among those with an upcoming cruise booked on one of Carnival's brands. That might have you interested in investing in the cruise stock. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to invest in its shares and some things to consider before buying.\nHow to invest\nHow to buy Carnival Cruise Lines stock\nYou need to take a few steps before buying shares in Carnival (or any other stock). Here's a step-by-step guide to adding the cruise stock to your portfolio.\n- Open your brokerage app: Log in to your brokerage account where you handle your investments.\n- Search for the stock: Enter the ticker or company name into the search bar to bring up the stock's trading page.\n- Decide how many shares to buy: Consider your investment goals and how much of your portfolio you want to allocate to this stock.\n- Select order type: Choose between a market order to buy at the current price or a limit order to specify the maximum price you're willing to pay.\n- Submit your order: Confirm the details and submit your buy order.\n- Review your purchase: Check your portfolio to ensure your order was filled as expected and adjust your investment strategy accordingly.\nStock Ticker\nShould I invest?\nShould I invest in Carnival Cruise Lines?\nIt's vital to do your research before buying a stock. It could make you decide against buying shares or confirm your investment thesis. Here are some reasons why you might want to buy shares of Carnival:\n- You're a fan of cruising and Carnival's brands.\n- You believe the company will benefit from growing demand for cruising, which will increase its profitability in the long term.\n- You understand that shares could be volatile as Carnival navigates a potential future recession.\n- You know the risks of investing in Carnival, including that the company is working toward paying down the boatload of debt it took on to stay afloat during the pandemic.\n- You don't need dividend income from your investment.\n- You want to enjoy the company's shareholder benefit of a $50-$250 onboard credit (for sailings through the end of 2025) for those who hold at least 100 shares.\nOn the other hand, here are some factors to consider that might make you decide that Carnival stock isn't the right investment for your situation:\n- You aren't all that interested in cruising.\n- You're close to or in retirement and need dividend income.\n- You are concerned about the company's balance sheet, which could continue to weigh down its shares.\n- You're worried about a recession, which could cause shares of Carnival to sink if demand cools off.\nProfitability\nIs Carnival Cruise Lines profitable?\nProfitability is the most critical factor determining whether a company can grow shareholder value over the long term. Typically, a company's stock price rises along with its earnings.\nAfter sinking following the COVID-19 pandemic, Carnival's revenue and profitability have recovered in recent years due to strong demand. The company's revenues hit an all-time high of $25 billion in 2025, a 15% increase from the prior year. The company also posted record adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) ($6.1 billion, a 40% increase) and operating income ($3.6 billion, an 80% increase). Meanwhile, its net income was $1.9 billion for the year.\nThe company foresees continued profit improvement in the coming years. For 2025, it expects its adjusted EBITDA to rise 10% to $6.7 billion while its adjusted net income will climb more than 30%. Driving that growth is continued strong demand for cruises and the company's SEA change strategy -- setting three-year financial and sustainability targets -- to boost its earnings. Carnival is also investing in expanding its fleet, which will see it add an average of one new ship per year over the next several years to grow its capacity.\nDividends\nDoes Carnival Cruise Lines pay a dividend?\nCarnival made dividend payments until early 2020. However, the company suspended its dividend in March 2020 to conserve cash because of the pandemic's impact on its operations. Before that, Carnival and its predecessors had paid quarterly dividends since 2001.\nAs of mid-2025, Carnival had yet to reinstate a dividend. The company said in its 2024 annual report that it doesn't plan to pay dividends for at least the next couple of years. Its primary focus is on shoring up its balance sheet and investing in expanding its fleet.\nETFs with exposure\nETFs with exposure to Carnival Cruise Lines\nAn alternative to investing directly in Carnival by purchasing shares is to consider passively investing in the company through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that holds shares. According to ETF.com, 201 ETFs held more than 174.3 million shares of the cruise line as of mid-2025.\nA notable fund was the Invesco Leisure and Entertainment ETF (PEJ 2.55%). The ETF tracks an index of 30 U.S. leisure and entertainment companies. Carnival was its fifth-largest holding at 4.5% of the fund's net assets in mid-2025. The fund has a 0.57% ETF expense ratio.\nExchange-Traded Fund (ETF)\nStock splits\nWill Carnival Cruise Lines stock split?\nCarnival has had two stock splits in its history. It completed 2-for-1 stock splits on December 14, 1994, and June 12, 1998.\nAs of mid-2025, Carnival didn't have an upcoming stock split on the calendar. It seems unlikely that the company will split its stock again in the foreseeable future. Shares were down more than 70% from their all-time high before the pandemic, due in part to a significant rise in outstanding shares as it issued stock to stay afloat:\nCarnival could complete a reverse stock split to help reduce its outstanding share count.\nThe bottom line on Carnival Cruise Lines\nCarnival hit rough seas during the pandemic, forcing it to take on a boatload of debt and issue lots of stock to stay afloat. These factors caused its share price to sink.\nHowever, the company is righting the ship by reducing its debt and improving profitability. While it likely won't be smooth sailing ahead for the cruise ship company since a recession could affect demand, it's in an excellent position to capitalize on growing demand for travel. It could be a compelling long-term investment for those who understand and are comfortable with the risks\nFAQ\nInvesting in Carnival Cruise Lines FAQ\nIs Carnival Cruise a good stock to buy?\nCarnival has many positive catalysts. The leading cruise ship operator is benefiting from the growing demand for cruises, which should enable the company to increase profits and cash flow in the coming years.\nHowever, the company is also trying to repay the debt it took on during the pandemic. It will take the company several years to get debt back down to a more comfortable level. That's hindering its ability to grow shareholder value through dividends, share repurchases, and new investments. Shares of Carnival could be very volatile in the future, especially if recession fears cause demand for cruising to slow. Although they have lots of upside potential, they also have lots of risk.\nCan I buy stock directly from Carnival?\nYou can't buy stock directly from Carnival. However, you can buy Carnival shares directly through any brokerage account. The cruise ship operator trades under the stock ticker CCL.\nHow much would it cost to buy 100 shares of Carnival stock?\nShares of Carnival stock cost around $20 a share in mid-2025. It would cost about $2,000 to buy 100 shares of Carnival stock at that price point. Buying at least 100 shares has a notable shareholder benefit. Shareholders with this many shares can receive an onboard credit of $50 to $250 per stateroom on sailings through Dec. 31, 2025."

      "text": "The acronym EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. EBITDA is a useful metric for understanding a business's ability to generate cash flow for its owners and for judging a company's operating performance.\nWhy it matters\nWhy EBITDA matters\nEBITDA is an earnings metric that is capital-structure neutral, meaning it doesn't account for the different ways a company may use debt, equity, cash, or other capital sources to finance its operations. It also excludes non-cash expenses like depreciation, which may or may not reflect a company's ability to generate cash that it can pay back as dividends.\nAdditionally, it excludes taxes, which can vary from one period to the next and are affected by numerous conditions that may not be directly related to a company's operating results.\nAmortization\nOverall, EBITDA is a handy tool for normalizing a company's results so you can more easily evaluate the business. To be clear, EBITDA is not a substitute for other metrics such as net income. After all, the items excluded from EBITDA -- interest, taxes, and non-cash expenses -- are still real items with financial implications that should not be dismissed or ignored.\nEBITDA is often most useful for comparing two similar businesses or trying to determine a company's cash flow potential.\nHow to calculate\nHow to calculate EBITDA\nEBITDA is very simple to calculate. Start with a company's annual SEC Form 10-K or quarterly 10-Q report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Go to the operating statement, and you will find line items for all of the items in EBITDA:\n- Earnings (net income or net loss)\n- Interest expense (sometimes also interest income)\n- Income tax expense (sometimes also tax credit)\n- Depreciation and amortization (typically combined but sometimes as separate line items)\nNext, add up all the line items that are expenses, subtract any line items that are income (such as interest income), then add the total to the net income (or net loss) figure. The result is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA. In other words, you're adding any expenses from these categories to (and subtracting any gains from) the company's net income.\nNote: Many companies also report adjusted EBITDA. This is not the same thing as EBITDA since it includes additional expenses such as stock issuance, nonrecurring expenses, and other material items that affect the results. While adjusted EBITDA can be useful, it can also be used by company management to support a narrative that frames the company in the best light while disregarding items investors should factor into their analysis and not ignore.\nLimitations of EBITDA\nThe limitations of EBITDA\nEBITDA can be a useful tool for better understanding a company's underlying operating results, comparing it to similar businesses, and understanding the impact of the company's capital structure on its bottom line and cash flows.\nHowever, using EBITDA incorrectly can have a negative impact on your returns. EBITDA should not be used exclusively as a measure of a company's financial performance, nor should it be a reason to disregard the impact of a company's capital structure on its financial performance.\nEBITDA should be considered one tool among many in your financial analysis tool belt. The example below helps explain why relying solely on EBITDA can be a mistake.\nWhy EBITDA: An example\nWhy EBITDA: An example\nSuppose you wanted to evaluate two businesses. To keep this example easy to follow, we will compare two lemonade stands with similar revenues, equipment and property investments, taxes, and costs of production. But they'll have big differences in how much net income they generate due to differences in their capital structures.\nLemonade Stand A was funded entirely by equity. Lemonade Stand B primarily uses debt to fund its operations. The only difference between them is how they choose to finance these assets -- one with debt, one with equity.\nIncome statements for these two lemonade stands appear below.\n| Lemonade Stand A | |\n|---|---|\n| Revenue | $1,000 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | $200 |\n| Interest Expense | $0 |\n| Depreciation of Lemonade Stand | $50 |\n| Income Before Taxes | $750 |\n| Net Income (35% tax rate) | $487.50 |\n| EBITDA | $800 |\nNote that Lemonade Stand A earned $487.50 in net income, while EBITDA was $800 in the example year.\n| Lemonade Stand B | |\n|---|---|\n| Revenue | $1,000 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | $200 |\n| Interest Expense ($1,500 at 10% interest) | $150 |\n| Depreciation of Lemonade Stand | $50 |\n| Income Before Taxes | $600 |\n| Net Income (35% tax rate) | $390 |\n| EBITDA | $800 |\nBecause Lemonade Stand B uses substantially more debt ($1,500 at 10% interest) to finance its operations, it is less profitable in terms of net income ($390 in profits versus $487.50). However, when compared on the basis of EBITDA, the lemonade stands are equal, each producing $800 in EBITDA from $1,000 in sales last year.\nWhat's the lesson here? By looking at EBITDA, we can determine the underlying profitability of a company's operations, allowing for easier comparison to another business. Then we can take those results and gain a deeper understanding of the impact of a company's capital structure, e.g., debt and capital expenditures, as well as differences in taxes (particularly if the companies operate in different places) on the company's actual profits and cash flows.\nRelated investing topics\nDoing all that can go a long way toward helping you decide if a company is worth investing in and what price it's worth. In the example above, Lemonade Stand A would be worth more to investors since it is able to turn more of its EBITDA into net income. Lemonade Stand B isn't as profitable because of its debt expense, so investors should be compensated by paying a lower stock price."

  "argos_summary": "Royal Caribbean and Carnival are two major cruise lines with contrasting recovery paths post-pandemic. Royal Caribbean is expanding aggressively with new luxury ships and has improved its financial health, boasting a strong EBITDA margin and a premium valuation. In contrast, Carnival is focused on stabilizing its operations and reducing significant debt, trading at a lower valuation but with potential for turnaround.
