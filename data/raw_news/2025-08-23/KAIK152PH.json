  "title": "Sorry, Linux Fans: This OS Is Actually the Better Windows Replacement",
  "description": "Not Linux, not Windows. Something better.",
  "content": "Everyone says Linux is the natural replacement for Windows, but between software headaches and endless tweaking, Linux always felt like work. This OS, though, just lets me use my computer without fighting it. It wasn\u2019t the switch I planned, but it\u2019s the one that finally stuck. Yes, I'm talking about macOS.\n\nApp Support Is Miles Better on macOS\n\nBefore you start comparing features, it\u2019s worth asking whether the apps you rely on will even run on your operating system. That\u2019s where Linux stumbles, since a lot of everyday workflows break down due to limited app support.\n\nFor example, Microsoft Office and Adobe\u2019s Creative Suite aren\u2019t available, and while alternatives like LibreOffice or DaVinci Resolve exist, they\u2019re not true replacements. For people like me who have been using the same apps for years, relearning software just to get work done is a dealbreaker.\n\nThe reality is that most industry-standard apps are available on macOS or Windows, and since I\u2019m trying to move away from the latter, a Mac is my only real option. With macOS, I don\u2019t need to worry about whether the tools I use will run or not, because the answer is almost always yes.\n\nTo Linux's credit, it is actually miles better than macOS at gaming. I remember trying to game on Ubuntu years ago, and it was a complete disaster, but these days I run SteamOS on my Asus ROG Ally, and it suprisingly performs better than Windows in most games. I just wish the same effort that went into making games work flawlessly also went into broader app compatibility, because that\u2019s still where Linux falls short.\n\nThere are tons of distros Windows users can try out to get started, but I\u2019ve had to open the terminal every single time to get something working. I don\u2019t mind it personally, since I\u2019m a developer, and I\u2019m comfortable typing out commands, but I can\u2019t imagine telling an average user to do the same.\n\nLike it or not, the terminal is still a necessity in pretty much every Linux distro, and that alone makes the learning curve steeper than most people would be willing to deal with. With so many distributions, package managers, and desktop environments, it\u2019s often difficult to even find the right solution to a problem. A quick Google search might point you to instructions that are completely irrelevant to your setup, leaving you stuck and wasting time.\n\nApple, on the other hand, is the complete opposite. Because it controls both the hardware and the software, macOS doesn\u2019t suffer from the same fragmentation issues. You do give up the freedom Linux offers, but in exchange you get a system where things usually just work.\n\nIn fact, I\u2019d say that out of the three major operating system families, macOS offers the best out-of-the-box experience. If someone asked me to recommend a laptop today, my default choice would be the MacBook Air for most people.\n\nHardware Support Can Be Very Hit or Miss\n\nI've installed Linux on countless devices at this point and I have run into hardware issues almost every single time. As I mentioned earlier, I usually end up opening the terminal just to get basic functionality working.\n\nA great example of this would be my secondary laptop which would refuse to boot Linux on a fairly standard Western Digital M.2 SSD. It took me hours of searching around on Google to figure out a solution, which was to add a specific boot argument in the bootloader. Even though I was able to fix this, I would never expect an average user to be able to figure it out.\n\nEven secondary things like fingerprint readers or printers can be very hit-or-miss, and you might have to settle for living without hardware that you have already paid for.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly why Macs stand out. macOS is built for Apple\u2019s hardware, and the second I boot it up for the first time, everything just works. There is no need to go through forums and typing out weird commands just to get basic stuff working.\n\nUnless more devices like the Steam Deck start showing up, where Linux comes preinstalled and already tuned for the hardware, this is always going to be a massive headache.\n\nMost People Don\u2019t Want to Install Another OS\n\nThe truth is most people don\u2019t want to bother with installing another operating system. Creating a bootable USB, wiping their drive, and digging into the BIOS might sound simple enough to someone who has been using Linux for a while, but for the average person, even getting into the BIOS feels uncomfortable.\n\nEven the creator of Linux has admitted this is one of the main reasons Linux has struggled to gain market share on desktops. It rarely comes preinstalled on devices, and that alone puts it out of reach for most people.\n\nMost users are not looking to tinker with their computers. They just want something that turns on and works right away. And as long as Linux continues to rely on people installing it themselves, it is always going to feel like a niche option.\n\nEven though I use a Mac as my daily driver, I have ditched Windows on all my other devices in favor of Linux and I still believe it is a much better choice than staying on Windows.\n\nLinux still has plenty of flaws for most average users, but if your workflow works well on it, I would definitely encourage you to stick with it because you also get the benefits of the freedom that Linux provides that isn't there on macOS.",

      "text": "I\u2019ve lived in Windows land my whole life, and every so often, I catch myself wondering if I should finally try Linux. But then, without fail, I remember why I haven\u2019t taken the plunge.\n6 The Terminal Worship Problem\nI do not think Linux is bad. My bane is, well, the Linux scene\u2014the culture and the way it\u2019s presented to people like me who are considering jumping over to it. If you really want people to move to Linux, maybe stop leading with \u201cyou can do everything in the terminal!\u201d That sounds fine enough, but also... why would I want to?\nButtons have spoiled me. I click; stuff happens. That\u2019s my relationship with computers. Meanwhile, a lot of Linux talk online essentially says, \u201cJust paste this command into your terminal, and you\u2019re good to go.\u201d From the sidelines, it feels that if you're not comfortable typing mysterious strings of text into a black box, you\u2019re already disqualified. No one says this outright (well, actually, some do), but it\u2019s often implied.\nHowever, I now understand that there are good modern-day Linux distributions (like Linux Mint, Zorin OS, and elementary OS) that are super user-friendly. You get system apps with full graphical interfaces, the same way you do on macOS or Windows. In fact, you could avoid the terminal entirely and still get through all your day-to-day work and system maintenance without breaking a sweat.\nBut that\u2019s not the version of Linux that gets talked about the most. The loudest voices still treat the terminal like a sacred rite of passage, and if you skip it, you\u2019re apparently missing the \u201creal\u201d Linux experience.\n5 I Don\u2019t Want to Be a Sysadmin\nI don\u2019t want to be my own IT department. I\u2019m not trying to earn a merit badge in package management. Most people, including me, just want to open their browser, install apps, listen to music, do work, and watch videos.\nNow, I know that Linux can do all that just fine\u2014and, maybe in many cases, more efficiently than Windows. But from the outside looking in, the on-ramp still looks like step one: learn an entirely new way of installing software.\nWith Linux, there\u2019s often this perception that you have to pick from five different installation methods, learn which package format your distro uses, and maybe even consult a community thread from a decade ago to fix a missing dependency. Whether that perception is accurate almost doesn\u2019t matter, because that\u2019s the vibe I get.\n4 The Elitist Attitude Turns Me Off\nAllow me to sound a little harsh here, but some Linux users have the worst case of tech smugness I\u2019ve ever seen. I\u2019ll be browsing a forum where some newcomer says, \u201cHey, is there a way to install this without the terminal?\u201d and the top comment will be some variation of \u201cIf you can\u2019t use the terminal, maybe Linux isn\u2019t for you.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not encouragement; that\u2019s gatekeeping. And it works! It successfully keeps people like me at the gate. To be fair, plenty of Linux communities are welcoming and patient. I\u2019ve seen Ubuntu, Mint, and Pop!_OS users go above and beyond to help total beginners. But there\u2019s always that loud minority who act like you\u2019re not a real Linux user unless you start with Arch and compile your kernel from scratch while balancing on one leg.\n3 Time Is a Big Factor\nEven if Linux were the friendliest, most welcoming operating system on the planet, there\u2019s still the fact that switching takes time.\nI\u2019ve spent my whole life learning Windows\u2014where the settings are, how to install programs, how to fix small problems, and much more. I can navigate it half-asleep. Switching to Linux would mean relearning everything from scratch. And while I\u2019m sure that knowledge would be useful, I\u2019ve got better ways to spend my time right now.\nYes, Linux might save me time in the long run. Yes, I might actually enjoy learning it. But when you\u2019re comfortable in your current workflow, time investment sounds less like a fun challenge and more like a weekend project that ends up eating six weekends.\n2 Linux Doesn\u2019t Always Have Official Software Support\nAnother issue that makes me hesitate is that the software I use isn\u2019t officially available for Linux. Admittedly, there are alternatives, and I know Linux people often say that you can run the Windows version through Wine, or an open-source equivalent is better. But I\u2019m sorry; I don\u2019t want a \u201ckind of works if you tinker with it\u201d solution. I want the actual, official app, supported by the people who make it, with updates that don\u2019t break everything.\nTo be fair, this is slowly changing. Big names like Steam, Blender, and even some Adobe competitors run beautifully on Linux now. But for every success story, there are still a handful of programs where you\u2019re digging through GitHub issues at midnight because a minor update borked the installer.\n1 So I\u2019ll Still Be Watching From the Sidelines\nSo here I am, still on the Windows side of the fence. I watch the Linux crowd from afar like someone admiring a cool club they\u2019ll never join\u2014not because they can\u2019t, but because the entry process is so unnecessarily intimidating.\nI see the beautiful desktop setups, the endless customization, and the speed. I believe all the stories about how stable and secure it is. And I genuinely think it\u2019s amazing that people can have that level of control over their systems.\nBut I also see the unspoken assumption that you should want to learn the \u201cproper\u201d way to use it. And for me, that\u2019s not the kind of relationship I want with my computer.\nMaybe one day, Linux will be pitched in a way that says I should click through a few buttons and I'm done; where there are no initiation rituals, no cryptic commands, and absolutely no side-eye if I decide I won't even glance at the terminal.\nWhen that day comes, I\u2019ll probably be first in line. Until then, I\u2019ll keep watching, admiring, and double-clicking my way through life."

      "text": "Windows is a great operating system, and depending on your requirements, might be your only choice. However, if you're bold enough to leave, you'll find that Linux is quite a useful alternative. I've left Windows for Linux, and I'm gone for good.\n1 Windows Has Far Too Many Random Bugs\nOne of my biggest issues with Windows is the random bugs you come across in day-to-day usage. The latest example of this is a green screen of death that crashes my system every time I connect my Xbox controller to my PC over Bluetooth. This issue happened on the latest stable release, with no warning and no apparent reason\u2014Windows just decided to start crashing every time I connected my controller.\nI'm not alone in this. You can find online forums and subreddits full of complaints about random issues in Windows that pop up out of nowhere. They do get fixed eventually, but Microsoft takes far too long to fix these small issues. The company focuses on adding more features and making aesthetic changes to the operating system instead.\nWhile that's important, the user experience takes a backseat. No matter how good your OS looks, if core functionality is sacrificed, you are not going to have a good time using your PC.\nDon't Update Your PC Yet\u2014The Latest Windows 11 Patch Breaks File Explorer\nThe Windows 11 KB5051987 update stopped File Explorer from working.\nDespite launching in 2021, Windows still feels like a work-in-progress OS in 2025. And while slowly improving it over time might well be Microsoft's ideology with the OS, it doesn't work for me. I can't sit around with a system that has broken functionality because the company decided some minor aesthetic or system tweak was more important than maintaining functionality.\n2 Updates Can Make or Break Your System\nUpdates on Windows are a mixed bag. An update might add a cool feature or a new visual tweak, but it can also break some functionality on your PC. And when it does, you almost certainly won't realize during the 10-day rollback period Microsoft gives.\nUpdates also eventually become forced. It's well-known that Microsoft broke millions of PCs with the 24H2 update for Windows 11, and ended up forcing the update on unwilling users after a while. And if you're using Windows 10, you surely know about the company killing off its best OS in the four decades since Windows 1.0.\nAnother major problem with Windows updates is that you have little control over update timing and installation. Windows also forces automatic restarts after updates at times, which can cause major disruptions if this happens during work hours. There are settings to avoid this, but I still get hit with an automatic update when restarting my PC once almost every two weeks. It's annoying when it happens, especially when Windows clearly knows my working hours and its own settings should prevent this from happening.\nLinux's update system is a lot more compartmentalized, meaning you can update individual packages, groups of packages, or the entire OS at once. Linux updates are more stable, and it doesn't force restarts for most updates you'll encounter.\n3 AI Is Everywhere, for No Good Reason\nMicrosoft's push for AI, while not completely useless, is overkill for most people. Even Notepad has AI integrated into it, and that's the simplest of Windows tools. Most of Microsoft's AI features peppered across Windows aren't generally usable either, as you need to have a Microsoft 365 subscription to use them.\nI don't want AI in every nook and cranny of my OS. Windows thus leaves me no choice but to use a bloated platform with features that I won't use, but can't disable either. These AI features can also be a massive privacy risk, as they require you to log in with your Microsoft account on every app you want to use them with. (Not to mention needing to use a Microsoft account for Windows as a whole.)\nSome of Microsoft's bigger AI features, such as Recall, are a complete privacy nightmare. An OS constantly screenshotting what you're doing on your PC isn't something any privacy-conscious user will be comfortable with. The sad part is that Recall is actually useful, and could've been a great feature if implemented with privacy in mind. Microsoft has since worked out the quirks and wants you to try Recall again, but the damage is done.\n4 Windows Requires Way Too Many Hardware Resources\nUnless you're running relatively modern hardware for 2025, you're not going to enjoy the Windows 11 experience. The OS requires far too many hardware resources to run properly, leaving little headroom for games and programs. This gives a false perception that your PC is slow, urging unsuspecting users into upgrading their otherwise perfectly capable machines.\nThe TPM 2.0 requirement for running Windows 11, while important for security, is not optional. This isn't a great move as it renders hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of PCs obsolete (if you want to stick with Windows).\nEven if you manage to get Windows 11 up and running on an older PC, chances are you're going to have performance issues using just about every program. I've experienced this on my previous machines, where upgrading from Windows 10 to 11 led to a noticeable drop in performance when running games and creative programs like Premiere Pro and Photoshop.\nYou can use debloating tools to get a faster, cleaner version of Windows. However, this method requires an external download, fiddling with settings, and being aware of Windows 11's extra overhead in the first place. That's not a great approach for the vast majority of Windows users who might not have the technical know-how to download GitHub tools.\n5 Security and Privacy Are Still Terrible\nWindows 11 was supposed to be big on privacy, and to be fair, Microsoft does provide plenty of privacy and security controls to keep your system protected. Windows Security has also come a long way, eliminating the need for paid antivirus solutions. However, default Windows settings can make your life harder more often than not.\nThere are benefits to letting Windows invade your privacy, but it doesn't change the fact that your usage data gets sent back to Microsoft (and often third parties as well). If you can do without the convenience, there are Windows privacy settings you should change right away.\nThe rapid inclusion of AI features is also making the situation worse. Recall aside, a lot of core Windows components are gaining new AI abilities that respond to what you're doing, massively increasing the amount of data Microsoft can harvest from you. While you can now tell your PC what settings you want to change, you inadvertently end up sharing data and buying into the AI ecosystem Microsoft's trying to build.\nIn the end, Microsoft ends up collecting a massive amount of data on you. This includes your location, how you use products and services, what programs are installed on your system and their settings, and voice data. And if you use Edge, your browsing activity is included too.\nLinux, on the other hand, doesn't actively track user data at all. Any data collection only happens when you opt into a specific feature, compared to the feature being enabled by default.\nThe jump from Windows to Linux isn't easy, especially if you aren't comfortable with swapping out entire OSes, using a virtual machine, and dealing with an entirely new platform. It can be a lot at first, but it's certainly worth the hassle."

      "text": "From higher system requirements to privacy concerns, there are plenty of reasons why you might be considering a switch from Windows to Linux. Luckily, there are many great distros for all kinds of workflows to help you make the transition easily.\n1 Linux Mint\nIf you're new to Linux and do most of your work on a browser, Linux Mint is a great place to start for Windows users. Its user interface closely resembles Windows, so you'll feel comfortable right from the start. Plus, if you're running it on an older system, you'll likely notice a significant boost in speed, as Linux Mint performs well even on outdated or low-spec hardware.\nIt also comes pre-installed with essential tools like Firefox, LibreOffice, and an app store, so you're ready to go right away. Overall, it's an excellent choice if you're just starting with Linux and want something familiar that runs smoothly on older devices. If I had to recommend Linux to someone who isn't very tech-savvy, Linux Mint would definitely be my first choice.\nDownload: Linux Mint (Free)\n2 Manjaro\nIf you're new to Linux but eager to learn its ins and outs while enjoying a highly customizable experience, Manjaro is a great choice. One of its key advantages is getting updates and new features much earlier than most other distros, making it perfect for those who love staying on the cutting edge of software.\nWhen you visit Manjaro's download page, you'll see three options: KDE Plasma, Xfce, and GNOME. If you're coming from Windows, I recommend choosing the KDE version, as it has a similar UI and offers the most customization.\nSince Manjaro is based on Arch Linux, it's a great starting point for tinkerers. However, once you\u2019re more familiar with a Linux system, I\u2019d suggest installing vanilla Arch Linux for an even more customizable system without extra bloat.\nDownload: Manjaro (Free)\n3 Ubuntu\nUbuntu is easily the most popular Linux distribution, known for its stability and user-friendly experience right out of the box. Each major release receives security updates for five years, but just like all the other distributions mentioned in this list, Ubuntu performs much better than Windows on older hardware and has pretty lax system requirements, so even future versions should run smoothly on most machines without any issues.\nYou can set up a dual boot with Ubuntu if you're not ready to fully switch from Windows, allowing you to choose between the two operating systems each time you start your PC. The Ubuntu Desktop Guide is also a great resource if you ever run into any issues, and the Ubuntu Software Center has almost every app you might need, ready for download and installation.\nDownload: Ubuntu (Free)\n4 Pop!_OS\nIf you\u2019re a Windows user, chances are you\u2019re also into gaming, and there\u2019s a Linux distro made just for that. Pop!_OS is a gaming centric distribution that\u2019s specifically tuned for better gaming performance.\nIf you have an Nvidia GPU, there\u2019s even a separate version of Pop!_OS available for download that includes Nvidia\u2019s proprietary drivers right from the start. This saves you the trouble of manually installing the drivers, as is often required with some other distros.\nAlthough Pop!_OS is built on Ubuntu, it follows a rolling release cycle, meaning you\u2019ll receive updates much sooner while still retaining most of Ubuntu\u2019s stability. However, keep in mind that the default interface resembles macOS more than Windows. So, if you\u2019re not looking for a major UI change, you might need to customize it a bit to suit your preferences.\nAdditionally, if you\u2019re not familiar with disk partitioning, you could face challenges setting up a dual boot with Windows, as the process is more complex than using the Ubuntu installer.\nDownload: Pop!_OS (Free)\n5 Zorin OS\nJust like Pop!_OS, Zorin OS is based on Ubuntu but with some additional tweaks on top of it. It provides multiple desktop layouts, allowing you to switch between different styles quickly. For example, you can change from a Windows-like interface to one that resembles macOS with just a single click.\nIt also allows you to run Windows apps by double-clicking on .exe files, though compatibility might be limited. While you can use Wine to run Windows apps on other Linux distros as well, having this feature built-in is a nice touch.\nWhat I don\u2019t like about Zorin OS is that it offers a paid version, which unlocks additional desktop layouts and comes with extra apps, which goes against the Linux philosophy of being free and open-source.\nWhile the free version of Zorin OS is quite good for most users, I\u2019d prefer if the extra desktop layouts were available without a paywall. Instead, a pro version could focus on bundling licenses for even more professional apps.\nDownload: Zorin OS (Free, paid version available)\nAll these distros are great for getting a feel for Linux, but once you\u2019re more comfortable with one, I strongly recommend experimenting with multiple distributions as the real beauty of Linux is its customizability.\nWhile some features in a particular distro might seem appealing, chances are you can get similar functionality working on another distro. No single distro is the best; instead, each one shows you different possibilities and how you can tailor your system to your needs."
