      "text": "'The Gilded Age' Season 4: What we know about release date, cast, more\nSpoiler alert: This story includes details from episodes of Season 3 of \"The Gilded Age.\"\n\"The Gilded Age\" had viewers on the edge of their seats this season with plenty of scandal, betrayals and tragedies.\nBertha Russell (Carrie Coon) finally made it, hosting the must-attend ball of the season and settling her daughter Gladys (Taissa Farmiga) into her new home, despite the initial setbacks and tensions. However, her woes are far from over after her husband George (Morgan Spector) informs her that, despite her nursing him back to health after a gunshot wound and helping his business save face, he has still not forgiven her for her past offenses and may not even love her anymore.\nGeorge, meanwhile, came out on top after coming dangerously close to losing his life, railroad company and fortune this season after overleveraging his businesses and being unable to make a few crucial deals. After one of his enemies, the identity of whom is unknown, arranges for him to be shot at the end of Episode 7, George is rushed home rather than the hospital to keep news of the shooting quiet, where Dr. William Kirkland (Jordan Donica) saves George's life, with help from Marian (Louisa Jacobson).\nAnd Dr. Kirkland wasn't just busy saving lives this episode. The tall, handsome physician gets down on one knee for Peggy (Den\u00e9e Benton) and the two finally seemingly get their happily ever after. The couple is not the only one intending to walk down the aisle next season. Oscar (Blake Ritson) suggests marriage to wealthy widow Mrs. Winterton (Kelley Curran), Bertha's former maid and recent social climber, while his cousin Marian makes up with Larry Russell (Harry Richardson), which means their engagement might be back on.\nWith plenty of loose threads and a lot still left to unpack, here's what we know so far about Season 4 of \"The Gilded Age.\"\nWill there be a Season 4 of 'The Gilded Age'?\nYes. HBO announced July 28 that \"The Gilded Age\" will return for a \"thrilling\" Season 4.\n\"Transporting us to 1880s New York City, Julian Fellowes and the enormously talented cast and crew have created a 'can't-miss it' entertainment experience from week to week, and we're delighted to continue exploring these characters' grand ambitions for what we promise will be a thrilling fourth season,\" HBO executive Francesca Orsi said in a statement.\nThe lavish period drama, which premiered in June, soared to new heights this season. Nearly 4.6 million viewers tuned in for the penultimate episode of Season 3 in its first three days, according to data shared by HBO. Overall viewership for Season 3 is almost 50% higher than the previous seasons with \"every episode showing consistent audience growth,\" HBO said.\nJoin our Watch Party!

HBO hasn't previously been consistent as far as \"The Gilded Age\" release dates are concerned.\nWhile the first season premiered in January 2022, the second season landed almost two years later in October 2023. Season 3, meanwhile, took its time, coming more than a year and a half later in June 2025.\nNeed a break?

      "text": "'Landman' strikes Season 2 oil: What's up in the 'Yellowstone' and Sheridan-verse?\n\u201cYellowstone\u201d what? The TV world is gushing over Taylor Sheridan's \"Landman\" and Billy Bob Thornton\u2019s crude oil-industry fixer Tommy Norris.\nThe hit Paramount+ drama series about life in West Texas oil fields that also stars Jon Hamm, Demi Moore and Ali Larter has been renewed for Season 2, Paramount announced Wednesday.\nSheridan's \"Yellowstone\" (minus Kevin Costner's patriarch, John Dutton) may be seeking new life after officially ending in December with Season 5, Part 2 on the Paramount Network. But \"Landman\" has continued the producer's streak of hits since premiering last November, with what Paramount+ claims is its most-watched global series premiere yet.\n\"Landman\" was so spot-on that Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones' emotional cameo visiting the hospital bed of Hamm's Monty Miller went viral \u2012 and was almost powerful enough to erase the memory of his football team's miserable season. Thornton earned a Golden Globe nomination for best actor in a drama series, but lost to Hiroyuki Sanada for FX's \"Sh\u014dgun\".\nThe Season 2 premiere date has not been announced. But here\u2019s what's happening on the other Sheridan shows.\n'1923' continues 'Yellowstone' saga in Season 2\nAfter 2021's \"1883\" series established the origins of the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch, \"1923\" carries the family saga through the Prohibition era. In Season 2, currently underway, Jacob (Harrison Ford) and wife Cara Dutton (Helen Mirren) defend the early ranch from the evil land baron Donald Whitfield (Timothy Dalton), a cynical early ski-resort proponent. Prodigal nephew Spencer (Brandon Sklenar) and his pregnant bride Alex (Julia Schlaepfer) race home to help save the sacred family plot and breed future generations before the April 6 season finale.\nNext up for 'Yellowstone' world: Michelle Pfeiffer in 'Madison'\n\"The Madison\" is the next \"Yellowstone\" spinoff, starring Michelle Pfeiffer as New York widow Stacy Clyburn, who trades Madison Avenue for the Madison River Valley of central Montana. The exact connection to the Dutton clan is still unclear, except that Clyburn has the family's grit in the series expected in the fall.\nJeremy Renner vows 'special' Season 4 of 'Mayor of Kingstown'\nJust like star Jeremy Renner, beleaguered prison-town fixer Mike McLusky just keeps on rolling in \"Mayor of Kingstown.\" After fending off the Russian mob that tried to muscle in on the action in Kingstown, Michigan, in 2024's Season 3, the perpetually battered McLusky will return for Season 4, Paramount+ announced in December. The gritty series also stars Hugh Dillon, who rocks, literally, as Detective Ian Ferguson. Dillon is the frontman of the rock band Headstones as well as an executive producer and Sheridan's co-creator.\nProduction is underway. Renner posted a moody Instagram photo from train tracks last month, promising that Season 4 \"is shaping up to be something special.\"\nStallone won't sing in 'Tulsa King' Season 3\nSylvester Stallone's Dwight \"The General\" Manfredi is still ruling his growing Oklahoma crime family of adorable misfits in \"Tulsa King.\" However, in November's Season 2 finale, a hooded Manfredi was dragged into a mysterious government office and told, \"You work for us, now.\" Paramount has officially greenlit Season 3, and Stallone, an executive producer, promised a third season and a suitable big-name actor to play his government handler. Don't worry, Manfredi won't sing to authorities about his friends; he's no prairie canary. The government relationship will be beneficial to Manfredi's operation.\nZoe Salda\u00f1a will bring Oscar gold to Season 3 of 'Lioness'\nLioness chief Joe (Zoe Salda\u00f1a) survived another perilous mission, ending Season 2 last March with a brutal firefight in Iran. There has been no official announcement, but \"Lioness\" is a slam dunk to return for Season 3. Salda\u00f1a told Vanity Fair in November, \"I signed up for three seasons at least, and so you do have a sort of contractual obligation to fulfill.\"\nSalda\u00f1a will be packing gold with her tactical equipment. The actress won best supporting actress Oscar for \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" at the 97th Academy Awards this month.\n'Yellowstone' Season 5 heads to Peacock. When is new show?\nIn the ever-shifting Sheridan-verse, previously announced \"Yellowstone\" spinoffs like \"1944\" have moved to the back burner while \"2024\" looks to become the next version of \"Yellowstone.\"\nThe table is set for the reported new series, centered on Beth (Kelly Reilly) and Rip (Cole Hauser), or a sixth season of the original \"Yellowstone\" without Costner's Dutton (RIP, the finale casket was magnificent). Reilly is ready, Hauser is ripped. But fans are still waiting for the official update. The Season 5 finale (streaming on Peacock starting Sunday) ended with the couple starting fresh on a new ranch about 40 miles from Dillon, Montana. As Rip said to Beth in the closing scene: \"Saddle your horse.\""

      "text": "'Mad Men' reunion: Jon Hamm, John Slattery on fake cigarettes, finale, blackface episode\nAUSTIN, TX \u2013 Pour yourself an old fashioned or a Coca-Cola. We\u2019re traveling back to the time of \u201cMad Men.\u201d\nJon Hamm, who won an Emmy for his portrayal of the brilliant ad man Don Draper, and John Slattery \u2212 who played his boss Roger Sterling \u2013 reunited 10 years after the finale of the AMC series, created by Matthew Weiner, as part of the ATX TV Festival. On May 31, the actors took the stage at a packed Paramount Theatre and reminisced about their days filming seven seasons of the drama centered on a New York advertising agency in the 1960s. The series also starred Christina Hendricks, January Jones, Elisabeth Moss and Kiernan Shipka.\nHamm, 54, said that he had a broken hand while filming the scene when Moss\u2019 Peggy Olson is promoted to copywriter. So he asked Moss to be mindful and only softly squeeze it during a congratulatory handshake. But she forgot about the injury, Hamm said, and \u201chits me with a handshake that is like a president handshake, and a lightning bolt goes all the way through me and I hit the floor so hard.\u201d\nSlattery, 62, shared his disdain for his Season 7 mustache and again revealed he had first auditioned for the role of Don, though they\u2019d already cast Hamm in the part. Producers lured Slattery with the Draper role, hoping to convince him to apply for agency owner Roger Sterling, who had a smaller part in the pilot. Hamm says he auditioned for the enigmatic Don, aka Dick Whitman, about nine times.\nThe \u2018disgusting\u2019 prop booze and cigarettes\nHamm and Slattery dished on the tricks that helped viewers believe they were chain-smoking, booze-guzzling men of that era.\n\u201cI think somebody did a count,\u201d Hamm said, \u201cand in the pilot alone I smoked 75 cigarettes or something.\u201d They were fake, Slattery pointed out. \u201cThat just means that there's no nicotine in them.\u201d Hamm said. \u201cIt doesn't mean you're not burning something and inhaling\u2026\u201d\nHamm said some of the younger actors in the pilot episode vowed to smoke real cigarettes to more authentically portray their characters. \u201cWithin three days,\u201d he said, \u201cthey were yellow and sallow and like, \u2018This is a terrible idea.\u2019\u201d\nIn place of vodka, the actors would sip water, garnished with onions.\n\u201cPop another pearl onion in your glass of water and then you\u2019d smoke 26 more fake cigarettes, and it was 9:30 in the morning,\" Slattery said. \"It was disgusting.\u201d\nJon Hamm on Don Draper\u2019s finale \u2018revelation\u2019\nDuring the Q&A portion of the panel, a fan asked about Hamm\u2019s interpretation of the finale. In the series\u2019 last moments, Don dreamed up the \u201cI'd Like to Buy the World a Coke\u201d ad while meditating on a California cliff.\nWeiner envisioned Don\u2019s end in Season 1, Hamm said. \u201cHe reached the end of land as far away as he could from his life and realized that his life was creating advertising. That was his revelation, that this is what he is and what he does. He's not Dick Whitman. He's not Don Draper. He's some version of this, but he is an advertising man and that was, I think, positive.\u201d\nJohn Slattery addresses blackface in Season 3\nSlattery told fans that when he was asked to sing \"My Old Kentucky Home\" in blackface in Season 3, he phoned Hamm, seeking his costar's thoughts. Ultimately, Slattery \u201cfelt like, \u2018Well, this is probably something that occurred and it\u2019s probably something that this character would've done. So what leg do I have to stand on not to do it?\u201d\nAfter arriving on location in character, Slattery said, \u201cThe first person I opened the van and saw was a very large African American Los Angeles motorcycle cop, who was helping me open the door.\n\u201cWe\u2019re like face to face,\u201d Slattery continued. \u201cI had to go and sing that thing in front of them and everybody.\u201d\nIn 2020, \u201cMad Men\u201d added a title card to the episode (the series streams on AMC+ and Philo), prefacing it with a warning of \u201cdisturbing images.\u201d\n\u201cIn its reliance on historical authenticity,\u201d the card read, \u201cthe series producers are committed to exposing the injustices and inequities within our society that continue to this day so we can examine even the most painful parts of our history in order to reflect on who we are today and who we want to become. We are therefore presenting the original episode in its entirety.\u201d"

      "text": "Will the Skims face wrap snatch your chin? Here's what experts say\nSome medical professionals can't seem to wrap their heads around the hype of the latest Skims release.\nKim Kardashian's well-known shapewear brand released a $48 now sold out \"Seamless Sculpt Face Wrap\" that features \"collagen yarns for ultra-soft support,\" targeting those who have an elaborate morning shed routine.\nIn an Instagram story, the reality television star and businesswoman reportedly praised the conversation starter product as a \"necessity,\" saying that it \"just snatches your little chinny chin chin.\"\nTouted as Skims' \"first-ever face innovation,\" it went viral online, prompting a wave of plastic surgeons to chime in on social media with criticisms on its effectiveness, encouraging people to think twice before purchasing.\nDoctors argued that consumers might not get the results they are hoping for with the popular beauty hack.\nWill it snatch your chin for long? Experts say no.\nDr. Vinod Chopra, based in Fairfax, Virginia, is one of the many surgeons who voiced his opinion on TikTok. He told USA TODAY that a face wrap would typically be recommended to his patients after they underwent specific surgeries like a neck liposuction, a neck lift, buccal fat pad removal, or a face lift.\n\"The best use of a product like this would be post-surgical to help reduce swelling and to help maintain the shape of a surgical result,\" Chopra stated. \"For common day-to-day use, I think that as you use something like this, it's going to decrease swelling or fluid in the area secondary to the compression itself, but it's not going to have a long-lasting effect.\"\nDr. Sarmela Sunder agreed. She explained that the face wrap could be effective if used before an outing: \"Similar to a jade roller or a gua sha tool, you can do it as you're getting ready for an event or the night before, and I think it'll have some great results for the day.\"\n\"For people that are considering using it as a treatment or as a substitute for a facelift or a skin tightening device, they're just going to be misled,\" said the facial plastic surgeon located in Beverly Hills, California.\nSunder also said the face wrap and similar products are not ideal for everyone, raising concerns about consumers with TMJ (temporomandibular joint disorder) and sensitive or acne-prone skin.\n\"People with TMJ issues, jaw alignment issues, wearing a garment like this long term can cause upward pressure on the TMJ joint,\" Sunder explained. \"The other thing that we can see is skin irritation. People can break out from the fabric. There can be true irritation abrasions from the garment itself.\"\nThe desire for a contoured, sculpted look is growing\nSkims' take on the face wrap comes amid a rise in plastic surgeries and enhancements with preventative aesthetic procedures, particularly among Gen Z. For instance, facial contouring has become popular as a result of social media.\n\"An aesthetically balanced, pleasing face, jawline, and neckline is something that everyone strives for, and everyone wants to look great and feel great,\" Chopra said. \"Doing treatments and using products that have proven benefits is a great thing to do. But, I don't necessarily think that people should spend their hard-earned dollars on treatments that aren't going to give them any clinical, long-term benefit.\"\nExperts have warned about the social connection between the glossy, highly edited online culture and surgeries, as well as the monumental role celebrities play in unrealistic beauty standards and desirability politics, especially in marketing.\nThe face wrap product sold at a company like Skims could \"send this message to young women that what is desirable is to have a thin, V-line face, which I think is perhaps a Eurocentric beauty aesthetic,\" stated Sunder, who is also the mother of a teenage daughter.\n\"I think it's a little problematic that it might be reaching an audience that we don't want to send that message to, and capitalizing on women's insecurities and reinforcing these narrow beauty ideals that are tied to these 'snatched' facial features.\"\nOther alternatives, dupes\nChopra and Sunder suggest that consumers research before committing to any treatment, noting that there are effective non-surgical procedures that yield better results for skin rejuvenation than using face wraps.\nOther options include radio frequency skin tightening, microneedling, and CO2 laser resurfacing.\n\"Then just regular skin health, like good medical-grade skin care, using sunscreen with the appropriate SPF,\" Chopra added.\nAlthough some consumers might want to splurge for the Skims label, there are face wrap dupes on Amazon as low as $8.99: \"If the result is for compression, then I don't think you need to spend $48 on it. There are a lot of great alternatives that are less expensive,\" he continued.\nSkims did not respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.\nTaylor Ardrey is a news reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "Paramount Global co-CEO Chris McCarthy will leave the company once its merger with Skydance is finished.\nMcCarthy\u2019s decision comes on the heels of the Federal Communications Commission signing off on the deal late Thursday, removing the last major hurdle to the $8 billion transaction.\nMcCarthy became co-CEO of Paramount, alongside George Cheeks and Brian Robbins, in April 2024. The trio took on the role after the ouster of Bob Bakish as the company was in its first round of negotiations with Skydance. McCarthy is also president of Showtime/MTV Entertainment and oversees the company\u2019s streaming platforms Paramount+ and Pluto TV.\nRelated Stories\nCheeks, who heads up CBS, will likely remain with the company post-merger, while Robbins, who leads Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon, is also expected to depart (though as of publication time, nothing beyond McCarthy\u2019s exit is official).\nThe FCC, headed by Brendan Carr, approved the transfer of Paramount\u2019s broadcast licenses to Skydance on Thursday. That should allow the deal to close in relatively short order, giving the David Ellison-led Skydance control of Paramount. Ellison is set to be CEO of the combined company, with former NBCUniversal chief executive Jeff Shell coming in as president.\nSources stress to The Hollywood Reporter that McCarthy remains committed to Paramount through the close of the merger, expected to happen in the next couple of weeks. With Securities and Exchange Commission filings saying Ellison will become CEO after the merger, that would trigger an incurable provision in the current co-CEOs\u2019 contracts. They could take another role within the merged entity if offered, but sources indicate McCarthy isn\u2019t inclined to do so.\nSkydance (and partner RedBird Capital) won out over other bidders for Paramount in July 2024, with Shari Redstone agreeing to sell her majority stake in National Amusements \u2014 the holding company that controls Paramount \u2014 to Ellison and Co. The agreement followed several months of on-and-off negotiations, including a last-minute Redstone rejection of an earlier proposal from Skydance.\nMcCarthy has been with Paramount Global and its predecessor Viacom for more than two decades, having first come to the company in 2003. He was named general manager of MTV2 in 2008 and gradually added the rest of Viacom/Paramount\u2019s cable channels to his purview over the next decade. Showtime also came under his umbrella in 2022 and was subsequently folded into Paramount+.\nFollowing the breakout success of Yellowstone on Paramount Network, McCarthy placed a big bet on showrunner Taylor Sheridan, signing him to a nine-figure overall deal. Sheridan has delivered several hits for Paramount+, most recently Landman and the second season of Yellowstone prequel 1923. McCarthy also helped bring Jon Stewart back to The Daily Show last year and has focused on an IP-driven strategy for Showtime and Paramount+, most notably with multiple iterations on Dexter alongside the Sheridan-verse.\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day"

      "text": "Billy Bob Thornton backs his crude oil 'Landman' character, except for one 'Bama diss\nBilly Bob Thornton knew that starring as oil company crisis-management specialist in \"Landman\" was never going to be a glam job.\nThornton, 69, inhabits the role of foul-mouthed Big Oil fixer Tommy Norris in the Paramount+ series from executive producers Taylor Sheridan and Christian Wallace, based on Wallace's 2020 \"Boomtown\" podcast that chronicled the impact of the historic West Texas oil boom. Getting into the character means more than getting his hands covered in crude, and it shows.\n\"I look older in 'Landman' than I do in real life,\" says Thornton, whose Norris contrasts with his fashionable ex-wife Angela (Ali Larter). \"Tommy barely combs his hair, never shaves. He's always a mess with dirt on his hands and face.\"\nFor Thornton, it's a powerful introduction to the Sheridan-verse (which includes \"Yellowstone\" and \"Tulsa King\"). The actor, who spends much of his time touring with his band The Boxmasters, lives a much quieter Hollywood life with his wife of 10 years, Connie Angland, than during his days with ex Angelina Jolie (they were married from 2000-03).\nThe \"Bad Santa\" star and Oscar-winning screenwriter (for 1996's \"Sling Blade\") spoke to USA TODAY about \"Landman\" (Episode 3 streams Sunday).\nQuestion: You wear Tommy Norris' jeans real low on the hips, which instantly feels West Texas. How do you navigate that look?\nThornton: It's low, and it's more pronounced with the shirt tucked in. And I've got no ass. I really don't. George Carlin would say, \"He's a guy who needs to wear two wallets to have an ass.\" Ali (Larter) was always pulling my pants up on set. Every day, she'd go, \"Babe, come here.\" And she would literally come grab them and pull them up.\nTommy often barks at critics of his Big Oil profession and lifestyle. Are you concerned about wading into politics by playing this crude character?\nIf somebody gets on Tommy, he'll defend how he makes his living. That's why he goes on these rants. But if they discover a way to make cars and airplanes run on water, these oil guys will get into the water business. These business guys just want to make money. The show isn't pro or con; it shows the good, the bad and the ugly of the oil business. But everything's politicized. If I made a movie about Jack the Ripper, and the Jack the Ripper actor was awesome, it doesn't mean people like Jack the Ripper. We're supposed to look at this as a piece of entertainment.\nWe can all back Tommy demanding his change from the bartender in Episode 1 because tip culture is out of control, right?\nAnd if you're well-known, you've got to tip even more. Because there are literally magazine sections talking about tipping and like, \"This guy is cheap.\" So I've even given a 100% tip before. My wife is like, \"We will go broke if you keep doing this.\" But I don't want to end up in some magazine.\nYou work with Demi Moore, who plays Cami Miller, the wife of oil company owner Monty (Jon Hamm). Was it an \"Indecent\" reunion, in the 1993 movie sense?\nI did two scenes in \"Indecent Proposal\" playing this guy called Day Tripper. I was there for six weeks, mostly on call, and then they cut one of the scenes out. But I got to know Demi and Bruce (Willis, Moore's then-husband) real well, and Demi always brought the kids to the set. Then I worked on three movies with Bruce. We were always pretty close.\nYou're from Arkansas, so you know Tommy's F-bomb declaration against the University of Alabama's Crimson Tide is going to raise some hackles.\nIt's one line I had to say, and I was like, \"Dadgummit.\" I've always liked (former Crimson Tide head coach) Nick Saban, and I've followed Alabama even though I'm an Arkansas Razorback fan. I love people in Alabama, and our band is really popular there. I hope they understand this is only a TV show. Let's not get carried away.\n\"Landman\" really goes after Pop-Tarts, even comparing eating the highly processed breakfast pastry to smoking. What's this about?\nThere's all kinds of stuff you could have for breakfast. But what's a Pop-Tart? It's this thing that barely has anything in the middle with this bread stuff around it.\nYou're so anti-Pop-Tart.\nI'm not anti-Pop-Tart. I love them. But I don't eat them. I don't eat any processed food.\nTommy's frequent drink of choice is Michelob Ultra, which is the frequent butt of his jokes. Is this odd product placement, or a natural choice?\nI don't think about product placement. But that's an interesting question, because I've seen other shows with products where the whole idea behind their use is being criticized. Of course, I'm not drinking Michelob Ultra while filming. Whatever it is I'm drinking, it's 90% water. So I'm fully hydrated.\n(This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.)"

      "text": "Who is 'Lioness'? How is Kevin Costner in 'Yellowstone'? Big Taylor Sheridan TV questions\nZoe Saldana and Nicole Kidman are locked and loaded for another CIA mission of Paramount+'s \"Lioness\" Sunday. And Billy Bob Thornton is set to drill, baby, drill in the West Texas oil drama \"Landman,\" due Nov. 17, the same day Sylvester Stallone's Mob boss concludes Season 2 of \"Tulsa King.\"\nIn Montana's cattle country, fierce couple Beth Dutton (Kelly Reilly) and Rip Wheeler (Cole Hauser) get back to work Nov. 10 on the second part of \"Yellowstone\" Season 5, without patriarch John Dutton (Kevin Costner).\nIt's hard to keep up with the ever-changing, fast-paced world of creator and executive producer Taylor Sheridan's TV universe. Here are the hottest burning questions around the Sheridanverse, which extends from \"Yellowstone\" to \"Tulsa King.\"\nJoin our Watch Party! Sign up to receive USA TODAY's movie and TV recommendations right in your inbox.\nIs there a new 'Lioness'? What happened to 'Special Ops'?\nWhen CIA chief Kaitlyn Meade (Kidman) and tip-of-the-spear colleague Joe McNamara (Saldana) are compelled to find a new Lioness agent to infiltrate a Mexican cartel family in Season 2 of \"Lioness,\" Army Capt. Josephina \"Josie\" Carillo (Genesis Rodriguez) is tapped for the deadly task.\nThe combat helicopter pilot learns how to be a ground soldier with support from grizzled elite fighters, including old soldier Cody, played by an impressively bulked-up Sheridan. The terrorist-infiltrating agent from last year's \"Special Ops: Lioness,\" Marine Cruz Manuelos (Laysla De Oliveira), also shows up to fight in a sign of Lioness support.\nParamount Studios has no explanation for why \"Special Ops\" was dropped from the official title. These things just happen. But the often-not-so-secret CIA wars will continue just over the U.S.-Mexico border, with Joe juggling nation-saving combat and family flare-ups at home.\nIt's a gusher! Who's drilling for a hit with 'Landman'?\nThornton, who appeared in the \"Yellowstone\" prequel \"1883,\" now stars as the title character Tommy Norris, an oil executive facing company crises and his ex-wife Angela (Ali Larter). Adapted from co-creator Christian Wallace\u2019s 2019 podcast \"Boomtown,\" the new series features Jon Hamm as magnificently named oil industry titan Monty Miller, who's married to savvy adviser Cami (Demi Moore), the brains behind the biz. Andy Garcia stars as powerful businessman Galino and Michael Pe\u00f1a plays a veteran roughneck.\nWho's running 'Yellowstone' ranch now that Kevin Costner's gone?\nCostner and John Dutton have left the Yellowstone Ranch building for what was originally billed as the end of \"Yellowstone.\" Just how the main Dutton man will be written out remains TV's most closely guarded mystery.\nLook for fan-favorite couple Rip and Beth to pick up the emotional load in the second half of \"Yellowstone\" Season 5. Despite his exit, Costner's Dutton was featured in a new trailer, thanks to cleverly edited old footage. But no new scenes featuring Costner were shot. The Nov. 10 Paramount Network premiere (8 EST/PST) will also air on CBS later that night (10 EDT/PDT).\nPersistent but still unconfirmed reports say \"Yellowstone\" won't end after all \u2212 Paramount is no longer promoting it as the final season \u2212 but will continue and ride Rip and Beth to new pastures.\nWill Brendan Sklenar aid Harrison Ford, Helen Mirren in '1923'?\n\"Yellowstone\" prequel \"1923\" ended its first season last year with ancestor Jacob Dutton (Harrison Ford) and wife Cara (Helen Mirren) besieged at the Yellowstone Ranch, as their wayward son Spencer (Brendan Sklenar) scurried home with loaded gun to save the day. His cruise home with wife Alexandra (Julia Schlaepfer) hit a snag with Spencer's arrest in the finale. But he'll make it.\nThere's big Hollywood heat on Sklenar, who earned attention from this year's hit movie adaptation \"It Ends With Us,\" which sparked a social media backlash against co-star Blake Lively. Sklenar just signed on to star in \"The Housemaid\" with Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried.\nHis profile will heighten the stakes of\"1923,\" with Season 2 now filming and coming to Paramount+ in 2025. \"Dexter\" star Jennifer Carpenter has joined the cast as U.S. Deputy Marshal Mamie Fossett, who's fixing to take names, serve warrants and make arrests.\nWhat's up with Michelle Pfeiffer in 'The Madison'?\nThe \"Yellowstone\" franchise loses an Oscar winner in Costner but gains a three-time nominee with Michelle Pfeiffer, who is starring and executive-producing \"Yellowstone\" spinoff \"The Madison.\"\nIn the vein of \"1883\" and \"1923,\" the series follows New York widow Stacy Clyburn (Pfeiffer), who trades Madison Avenue for the Madison River valley of central Montana. The exact connection to the Dutton clan is unclear. \"Lost\" star Matthew Fox will play an outdoorsy bachelor, along with \"Suits\" star Patrick J. Adams. \"The Madison\" is set to premiere in 2025.\nWill Sylvester Stallone's 'Tulsa King' rock on to Season 3?\nStallone's transplanted New Yorker Dwight Manfredi is still trying to keep his Oklahoma crime business alive despite the violent competitors he faced in \"Tulsa King\" Season 2. Stallone, an executive producer, confirmed on his Instagram page in September that \"we are working on the third season\" of the show. So in the likely event that Manfredi survives a sure-to-be explosive Season 2 finale, we'll learn when in 2025 the next Oklahoma chapter will arrive."
