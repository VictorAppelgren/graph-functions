  "title": "Bloomberg Daybreak Asia: Trump Extends China Trade Truce for 90 Days",
  "description": "Live market coverage co-anchored from Hong Kong and New York. Overnight on Wall Street is daytime in Asia. Markets never sleep, and neither does Bloomberg.",
  "content": "US President Donald Trump extended a pause of sky-high tariffs on Chinese goods for another 90 days into early November, stabilizing trade ties between the world's two largest economies. Trump signed an order extending the truce through November 10th, deferring a tariff hike set for Tuesday. The de-escalation first took effect when the US and China agreed to reduce tit-for-tat tariff hikes and ease export restrictions on rare earth magnets and certain technologies. China said it too would extend its own suspension for a further 90 days. Meanwhile, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices have agreed to pay 15% of their revenues from Chinese AI chip sales to the US government in an unusual, legally questionable deal that reflects the Trump administration's willingness to soften export controls in exchange for financial payouts. We discuss the day's developments with Derek Wallbank, Senior US Economy and Government Editor for Bloomberg News. Plus - Wall Street refrained from making big bets ahead of a key inflation report, with stocks losing steam after climbing to the brink of all-time highs. With the earnings season almost done, investors are turning to economic data for clues on whether the Federal Reserve will be able cut rates in September. Data due Tuesday is forecast to show US consumers saw a slight pickup in inflation as retailers gradually raised prices on a variety of items subject to higher import duties. We break down the potential market implications with Joy Yang, Head of Product Management at MarketVector Indexes.",
