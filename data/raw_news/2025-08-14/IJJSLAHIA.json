When we have confirmed access, the full article content will load.\n\nHow Cuomo Wants to Limit Who Gets to Live in Rent-Stabilized Units Former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s proposal is a dig at Zohran Mamdani, his main opponent in the mayor\u2019s race, but it could upend the housing search for middle-income New Yorkers. Former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has been attacking Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, the front-runner in the mayor\u2019s race, as being too rich to need rent-stabilized housing.\n\nFormer Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, seeking to gain ground in the New York City mayor\u2019s race, this week took aim at his main rival by proposing a law to reserve coveted rent-stabilized apartments for people of lesser means. The proposal is an attempt to seize momentum on one of the campaign\u2019s top issues \u2014 the housing crisis \u2014 and could affect nearly one million homes, or about 40 percent of the city\u2019s rental market. It\u2019s also part of a continuing attack on the front-runner in the race, Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, who pays $2,300 a month for a rent-stabilized one-bedroom apartment in Astoria, Queens. Mr. Cuomo has said that Mr. Mamdani, who earns $142,000 a year as a lawmaker, should give up his apartment so a homeless family can move in. Mr. Mamdani has said Mr. Cuomo is being petty and vindictive. City officials and housing experts have long debated how to make sure lower-cost housing goes to people who might need it the most. But Mr. Cuomo\u2019s proposal, which he is calling \u201cZohran\u2019s Law,\u201d prompted fierce criticism from renters\u2019 groups and skepticism from advocates for landlords and even some of the former governor\u2019s onetime allies. How would the law work? Mr. Cuomo\u2019s proposal would allow people to move into rent-stabilized apartments only if they would be spending at least 30 percent of their earnings on rent.

      "text": "For the very biggest decisions in his run for mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani typically relies on just two trusted advisers. One is 26. The other is 34.\nHis plans for free buses and policing were written with the help of other policy aides who, like him, cut their teeth in the Democratic Socialists of America.\nAnd until recently, few of the people closest to him had ever worked in city government.\nIf a politician\u2019s inner circle reflects the kind of government he or she would create if elected, then the group around Mr. Mamdani, a 33-year-old assemblyman and the Democratic nominee, foreshadows a very different City Hall from previous mayors.\nLike Mr. Mamdani, his aides are notably younger and farther left than advisers in rival campaigns. Few hail from the Democratic establishment; many have spent years fighting it. Several advisers bring long track records working on affordability and the concerns of growing immigrant groups. And as he seeks to make history as the city's first Muslim mayor , Mr. Mamdani has surrounded himself with both Muslim advisers and Jewish aides.\nBut to an unusual degree, Mr. Mamdani\u2019s orbit is still in flux. While youth may have been a feature of his success to date, the Democrat has been blunt that building an administration to run a city of eight million will require new expertise and a larger coalition. He has already begun seeking the counsel of more seasoned city hands, and has asked Elle Bisgaard-Church, his top adviser, to oversee a hiring spree.\nHere is a guide to the insiders who could shape his mayoralty.\nThe inner circle Elle Bisgaard-Church\nChief adviser\nMs. Bisgaard-Church, 34, served as campaign manager during the primary. Since then, she has been responsible for laying the groundwork for a mayoral administration. A California native and a D.S.A. member, Ms. Bisgaard-Church was new to politics when she took a job as Mr. Mamdani\u2019s chief of staff straight out of graduate school. Now, she is widely seen as his right hand and expected to play a major role in City Hall if he wins.\nMorris Katz\nSenior adviser\nAn ad maker and political strategist, Mr. Katz, 26, has said he was skeptical of Mr. Mamdani\u2019s long-shot campaign when they first met last summer. But he quickly became indispensable to the assemblyman\u2019s political rise. Recently, Mr. Katz has also helped serve as an emissary to Jewish leaders who remain uneasy with Mr. Mamdani\u2019s pro-Palestinian views. His clients also include Dan Osborn, a union steamfitter, who ran a surprisingly close race for Senate in right-leaning Nebraska.\nFamily Mira Nair\nMother, filmmaker\nMahmood Mamdani\nFather, Columbia professor\nMr. Mamdani has said he owes his parents everything, \u201cnot simply the person that I am, but the thoughts that I have.\u201d His mother, Ms. Nair , is an Oscar-nominated filmmaker whose movies include \u201cMonsoon Wedding,\u201d \u201cSalaam Bombay!\u201d and \u201cMississippi Masala.\u201d She hired her son out of college as a music supervisor. Mr. Mamdani has an endowed professorship at Columbia, where he is a leading scholar of post-colonialism.\nRama Duwaji\nWife, illustrator\nMs. Duwaji, a 27-year-old animator and illustrator of Syrian descent, married Mr. Mamdani earlier this year. Ms. Duwaji has avoided public attention, although she contributed to some of her husband\u2019s campaign\u2019s videos. The couple met on the dating app Hinge and traveled to Uganda in July to belatedly celebrate their marriage.\nCampaign staff Zara Rahim\nSenior adviser\nMs. Rahim, a well-connected communications specialist, has helped build Mr. Mamdani\u2019s cachet with the city\u2019s cool set . A veteran of Vogue, Uber and the presidential campaigns of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, she has connected Mr. Mamdani with celebrities and honed his media profile. Ms. Rahim is also an important pro-Palestinian voice in campaign discussions about Gaza.\nAndrew Epstein\nCreative director (former spokesman)\nMr. Epstein, a former chief of staff in the State Assembly, served as the campaign\u2019s main spokesman during the primary and oversaw the production of a series of viral videos that helped Mr. Mamdani elevate his profile. Mr. Epstein, 38, is now the campaign\u2019s creative director, working full time with a team of video producers. They include Donald Borenstein, Debbie Saslaw, Olivia Becke r and Anthony DiMieri , who captured Mr. Mamdani\u2019s policy proposals in videos that received millions of views.\nJulian Gerson\nSpeechwriter (former political director)\nMr. Gerson, 28, served as Mr. Mamdani\u2019s political director during the primary. A former aide to Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York and Gov. Kathy Hochul, he has shifted to be the campaign\u2019s chief speechwriter, giving voice to Mr. Mamdani\u2019s distinctive policy platform.\nTascha Van Auken\nField director\nMs. Van Auken built Mr. Mamdani\u2019s field operation. The campaign amassed a staggering 50,000 volunteers, who helped drive a sharp increase in turnout among younger voters in the primary. She is a veteran organizer affiliated with D.S.A. and once worked for Blue Man Group, a musical performance art company.\nThe brain trust Mr. Najmi is a close friend of the candidate and was the campaign\u2019s lawyer during the primary. With Mr. Mamdani, he was a leader of the Muslim Democratic Club of New York. Mr. Najmi is an election and criminal defense lawyer whose unsuccessful 2015 campaign for City Council was the first time Mr. Mamdani got involved in city politics.\nAmanda Septimo\nState assemblywoman\nA state assemblywoman from the Bronx, Ms. Septimo did not endorse in the primary, but she is another key behind-the-scenes gut-check for Mr. Mamdani on political and policy questions. The two are around the same age and both threw themselves into a 2021 campaign to help taxi drivers secure a debt relief program.\nCea Weaver\nHousing advocate\nMs. Weaver, a tenant organizer and D.S.A. member, advised Mr. Mamdani on housing policy, including his push to freeze rents on stabilized apartments. She is the director of the New York State Tenant Bloc, a nonprofit group that has pushed for tenant protections in Albany.\nFaiza Ali\nMuslim Democratic Club leader\nMs. Ali is a longtime ally who worked with Mr. Mamdani as a leader of the Muslim Democratic Club of New York, a progressive group. She works for the City Council, as the first deputy chief of staff to the speaker where she has been involved in budget negotiations and major rezonings, and previously was at the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\nMr. Singh is the political director of a group called DRUM Beats, which works with the South Asian and Indo-Caribbean communities and was one of the first groups to endorse Mr. Mamdani for mayor. He worked with Mr. Mamdani at Chhaya, a community development group that helps families facing foreclosure, and he worked with Mr. Mamdani on securing debt relief for taxi drivers.\nMurad Awawdeh\nNew York Immigration Coalition leader\nMr. Awawdeh, the president and chief executive of the New York Immigration Coalition, serves as a regular late-night sounding board for Mr. Mamdani. He helped shape the campaign\u2019s policy platform and build its novel coalition of young voters, South Asians and other immigrant groups.\nThe growing circle Patrick Gaspard\nDemocratic wise man\nMr. Gaspard, a former Obama aide and City Hall veteran, has served as an informal adviser and emissary to New York power players. He helped broker a cross-endorsement with Brad Lander, the city comptroller, and has accompanied the candidate to key meetings with business titans, Black New Yorkers and party leaders, like Ms. Hochul.\nMaya Handa\nCampaign manager\nAfua Atta-Mensah\nPolitical director\nJeffrey Lerner\nCommunications director\nMs. Handa only joined the campaign in late July, after managing State Senator Zellnor Myrie\u2019s losing mayoral bid. She has a track record of managing progressive campaigns, and worked with Mr. Mamdani during his time in the Assembly. Ms. Atta-Mensah joined the campaign around the same time with a mandate to help Mr. Mamdani expand his support among Black New Yorkers. She came from the progressive advocacy group Community Change. Mr. Lerner, a seasoned Washington operative who once worked for Mr. Gaspard, took over the campaign\u2019s communications team after the primary.\nDean Fuleihan\nFormer first deputy mayor\nMr. Fuleihan, a de Blasio administration alumnus , serves as a behind-the-scenes adviser to Mr. Mamdani and Ms. Bisgaard-Church as they prepare for a potential transition to office. He is viewed as an experienced City Hall veteran who understands the ins and outs of governing. He was Mr. de Blasio\u2019s first deputy mayor and served in other high-level positions in city and state government.\nKey allies Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\nCongresswoman\nIn many ways, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s upset primary victory in 2018 was a template for Mr. Mamdani. Both are members of D.S.A. and represent overlapping districts. The congresswoman\u2019s well-timed endorsement helped push the left to consolidate around Mr. Mamdani. She has been a personal sounding board since, coaching him through the pressures of achieving political stardom at a young age and introducing him to fellow Democrats in Washington.\nBrad Lander\nN.Y.C. comptroller\nMr. Lander, the city comptroller, made a critical cross-endorsement with Mr. Mamdani that helped boost him in the homestretch of the primary. The city\u2019s highest-ranking Jewish official, he has defended Mr. Mamdani from accusations of antisemitism and served as an attack dog criticizing Mr. Cuomo. Mr. Lander is widely expected to be considered for a high-level position in a Mamdani administration.\nNydia Vel\u00e1zquez\nCongresswoman\nLetitia James\nNew York attorney general\nMs. Vel\u00e1zquez , the first Puerto Rican woman in Congress, played a key role in validating Mr. Mamdani as a serious candidate in the primary and expanding his outreach among Latinos. Ms. James, the state attorney general, appeared with Mr. Mamdani at a rally during the final days of the primary, comparing him to Barack Obama, and has emerged as one of his most important emissaries to skeptical Democrats and Black voters. She is also advising him to keep Jessica Tisch as police commissioner.\nJabari Brisport\nState senator\nMichael Gianaris\nState Senate leader\nMicah Lasher\nState assemblyman\nMany of Mr. Mamdani\u2019s biggest plans will only come to fruition with support from the State Legislature. A circle of state lawmakers could be key to securing it. Mr. Brisport , a state senator from Brooklyn and fellow democratic socialist, is perhaps Mr. Mamdani\u2019s closest friend in Albany; the two were roommates there for years. But Mr. Gianaris , the deputy Senate majority leader, may be his most powerful ally; the two represent overlapping districts and have collaborated on legislation including a pilot for free buses. Mr. Lasher , an assemblyman from Manhattan who is Jewish, has become a liaison to the Democratic establishment and brings connections from his days as Ms. Hochul\u2019s policy adviser.\nInstitutional support Ana Mar\u00eda Archila\nWorking Families Party co-director\nGustavo Gordillo\nD.S.A. co-chair\nGrace Mausser\nD.S.A. co-chair\nMs. Archila, a co-director of the left-leaning Working Families Party in New York, helped run a campaign to defeat Mr. Cuomo in the primary. The group will be central to both Mr. Mamdani\u2019s general election and governing coalitions, should he be elected. Mr. Mamdani\u2019s success has also elevated the D.S.A. to a level of influence it has not previously seen. Its city leaders, Mr. Gordillo and Ms. Mausser , are key political advisers and can be expected to fight for many of Mr. Mamdani\u2019s leftist policy proposals as he broadens his coalition.\nHenry Garrido\nUnion leader\nMr. Garrido, the executive director of District Council 37, has been an emissary for Mr. Mamdani among the city\u2019s powerful labor leaders and will be a key negotiating partner if Mr. Mamdani becomes mayor. His group is the city\u2019s largest municipal union. The union ranked Mr. Mamdani second on its slate in the primary, helping give his campaign legitimacy in a crowded field."

      "text": "Who\u2019s Running for Mayor of New York City?\nOn the Ballot\nSliwa\nAdams\nWalden\nOut After Primary\nBlake\nLander\nMyrie\nStringer\nTilson\nThe 2025 New York City mayor\u2019s race has been unusually volatile and will have major consequences for the nation\u2019s largest city.\nZohran Mamdani, a state assemblyman and democratic socialist, won a competitive Democratic primary in June, soundly defeating former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo by a 12-percentage-point margin through focusing on making the city more affordable.\nMr. Mamdani will face four candidates in the general election, which will be held Nov. 4. Mayor Eric Adams, a registered Democrat, skipped his party\u2019s primary and is running for a second term as an independent. Mr. Adams has record-low approval ratings, but he has argued that he brought down crime.\nCurtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels, a group of volunteer would-be crime fighters, is the Republican nominee. Jim Walden, a former federal prosecutor, is running as an independent. And Mr. Cuomo confirmed in July that he would run on an independent ballot line as well.\nThe race has focused on several major themes, including affordability, public safety and President Trump\u2019s agenda.\nHere is an overview of the candidates for mayor.\nOn the Ballot\nZohran Mamdani Dem.\nState assemblyman\nMr. Mamdani is a state assemblyman and democratic socialist who stunned the political establishment with his victory in the Democratic primary.\nHe galvanized voters with an intense focus on affordability, campaigning on populist ideas like free buses, rent freezes for rent-stabilized apartments and city-owned grocery stores. His opponents have raised concerns over his limited experience in government and his criticism of Israel.\nCurtis\nSliwa Rep.\nGuardian Angels founder\nMr. Sliwa, who lost the general election to Mr. Adams in 2021, is running for the Republican nomination again.\nHe is a host on the conservative WABC radio station and has led the Guardian Angels, a citizen patrol group, for decades. He has criticized the mayor\u2019s handling of the migrant crisis and opposed the opening of new shelters.\nEric\nAdams Ind.\nIncumbent\nMr. Adams ran for mayor in 2021 as a former police officer who vowed to bring down crime, and his message four years later is similar. But he faces many challenges. He was indicted on federal corruption charges that were later dismissed by the Trump administration; his administration has been plagued by investigations and high-profile resignations; his approval rating is at record lows.\nMr. Adams says he has improved the city, pointing to his efforts to address public safety, to put trash into bins instead of on curbs and to build new housing. But his relationship with President Trump could hurt him with New Yorkers who oppose the president\u2019s agenda.\nAndrew Cuomo Ind.\nFormer governor\nMr. Cuomo was elected to three terms as governor and resigned in 2021 after roughly a dozen women accused him of sexual harassment. He also faced criticism for his handling of nursing home deaths during the pandemic.\nDuring the Democratic mayoral primary, he highlighted his record as governor, which included completing major infrastructure projects and raising the minimum wage. He finished second and plans to run in the general election on a third-party line.\nJim\nWalden Ind.\nFormer federal prosecutor\nMr. Walden, a former federal prosecutor who has handled high-profile cases, is running as an independent.\nHe has not run for office before and wants to curtail corruption. He has criticized congestion pricing tolls in Manhattan and city vaccine mandates during the pandemic.\nOut After Primary\nAdrienne Adams Dem.\nCity Council speaker\nMs. Adams, the first Black leader of the City Council, sought to position herself as a principled and scandal-free alternative to Mr. Adams, to whom she is not related, and Mr. Cuomo. She has fought to restore the mayor's budget cuts to libraries and free preschool and worked with him to approve a major housing plan.\nSelma Bartholomew Dem.\nEducator\nDr. Bartholomew is an education consultant.\nMichael\nBlake Dem.\nFormer state assemblyman\nMr. Blake was a White House aide under President Barack Obama and served in the State Assembly representing the Bronx.\nBrad\nLander Dem.\nCity comptroller\nMr. Lander, the city comptroller, is a progressive leader and a fierce critic of Mr. Adams and Mr. Cuomo. He cross-endorsed Mr. Mamdani in the primary and finished in third place in the Democratic primary.\nZellnor\nMyrie Dem.\nState senator\nMr. Myrie is a progressive state senator from Brooklyn who proposed creating free universal after-school programs, hiring 3,000 police officers to improve public safety and building one million new homes.\nPaperboy Love Prince Dem.\nActivist\nPaperboy Prince is a content creator and community activist.\nJessica Ramos Dem.\nState senator\nMs. Ramos, a state senator from Queens who failed to gain traction in the race, endorsed Mr. Cuomo. She had been a sharp critic of Mr. Cuomo, but did not think Mr. Mamdani should be mayor. She built her reputation as a progressive who supported raising the minimum wage.\nScott\nStringer Dem.\nFormer city comptroller\nMr. Stringer, the former city comptroller, ran on a message that he was competent and experienced. His 2021 mayoral campaign was derailed by allegations of sexual misconduct, which he has denied.\nWhitney\nTilson Dem.\nFormer hedge-fund executive\nMr. Tilson is a longtime Democratic donor and former hedge-fund executive who focused his campaign on public safety and antisemitism. During the primary, he criticized Mr. Mamdani and praised Mr. Cuomo."

  "argos_summary": "Former Governor Andrew M. Cuomo has proposed a law aimed at reserving rent-stabilized apartments for lower-income individuals, targeting his main rival, Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, who has been criticized for his income and rent situation. This proposal, dubbed 'Zohran's Law,' could impact nearly one million homes in New York City and has faced backlash from renters' groups and skepticism from housing advocates. Meanwhile, Mamdani, who won the Democratic primary, is building a diverse team of young advisers to support his campaign for mayor, focusing on affordability and progressive policies.",
