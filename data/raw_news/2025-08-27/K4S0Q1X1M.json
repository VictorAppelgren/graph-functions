  "title": "Google and Grok are catching up to ChatGPT, says a16z's latest AI report",
  "description": "The report, in its fifth iteration, showcases two and a half years of data about consumers' evolving use of AI products.",
  "content": "ChatGPT rivals like Google\u2019s Gemini, xAI\u2019s Grok, and, to a lesser extent, Meta AI, are closing the gap to ChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s popular AI chatbot, according to a new report focused on the consumer AI landscape from venture firm Andressen Horowitz.\n\nThe report, in its fifth iteration, showcases two and a half years of data about consumers\u2019 evolving use of AI products.\n\nAnd for the fifth time, 14 companies appeared on the list of top AI products: ChatGPT, Perplexity, Poe, Character AI, Midjourney, Leonardo, Veed, Cutout, Eleven Labs, Photoroom, Gamma, Quillbot, Civitai, and HuggingFace.\n\nThe companies represent a cross section of how consumers are using AI: for general assistance, companionship, image and video editing, voice generation, productivity, and model hosting.\n\nFive other companies appeared on all but the first report, the firm notes, including Claude, DeepAI, JanitorAI, Pixelcut, and Suno, representing general AI use, companionship, image editing, and music generation.\n\nFor the first time in the series of reports, Google gained four spots on the list of the top gen AI consumer web products with entries for Gemini, AI Studio, NotebookLM, and Google Labs. These products now have their own separate domains, allowing their growth to be tracked separately from one another.\n\na16z says its report relies on data from third-party market intelligence firms, including Similarweb for web products and Sensor Tower for mobile app data.\n\nOf note, No. 2 app Gemini is closing the gap to No. 1 app ChatGPT on mobile devices, but with almost half as many monthly active users. Not surprisingly, Gemini\u2019s AI technology sees stronger adoption on Android, with nearly 90% of the monthly active user base. On the web, Gemini also came in second place behind ChatGPT, with approximately 12% of ChatGPT\u2019s visits.\n\nThe company\u2019s AI Studio, a developer-oriented sandbox for building with Gemini models, entered the top 10 list of AI web products in the 10th spot; NotebookLM was No. 13. Google Labs, a destination for Google\u2019s AI experiments (like Flow, Project Mariner, and Doppl), ranked at No. 39.\n\nThe report indicates that Meta AI and Grok are also chasing the top AI app, ChatGPT.\n\nGrok ranked fourth on the web and No. 23 on mobile. This is quick growth, given that Grok went from having no standalone app at the end of 2024 (it was first launched on X) to now, upwards of 20 million monthly active users. In July 2025, Grok also climbed nearly 40% when Grok 4 was released.\n\nMeta\u2019s general assistant ranked No. 46 on the web \u2014 the same as in March \u2014 but it didn\u2019t make the list of top mobile AI apps. In part, it was hampered by the news that Meta AI was sharing some users\u2019 posts publicly on the web without their informed consent.\n\nDeepSeek and Claude also saw their growth flatten on mobile, with the former falling off its peak by 22%. On the web, DeepSeek saw an even sharper drop-off, down more than 40% from its peak in February 2025. Perplexity and Claude, however, continued to grow.\n\nOther Chinese AI makers also made the top 20 on the web, including No. 9 Quark, Alibaba\u2019s AI assistant (No. 47 on the mobile list); No. 12 Doubao, ByteDance\u2019s general LLM product (No. 4 on mobile); and No. 17 Kimi, a chatbot from Moonshot AI. Each of these has a Chinese website and sees 75% of its traffic coming from China.\n\nSeven additional companies on the web list were developed in China, but exported their AI tech globally: DeepSeek, Hailuo, Kling, SeaArt, Cutout Pro, Manus, and Monica.\n\nOn mobile, 22 of the 50 top apps were developed in China, but only three were primarily used in China. Top players here include Meitu (Photo & Video Editor, BeautyPlus, BeautyCam, Wink, and Airbrush), ByteDance (Doubao and Cici), Gauth, and Hypic.\n\nVibe-coding startups Lovable and Replit both debuted on the main list this time, having not made the cut on a16z\u2019s list published back in March of this year. (Note that websites built and published via Replit and via Lovable without custom domains appear under traffic for replit.app and lovable.app, respectively, helping them gain traction.)\n\na16z also took time to call out AI apps that were on the brink of making the list of top AI apps, including PixAI, bolt, Blackbox AI, Clipchamp, and Getliner on the web and Talkie, Seekee, Photo AI, AI Mirror, and Arvin on mobile.\n\nThe firm notes that the mobile list in this month\u2019s report already features more newcomers (14) than before, as both app stores have long since cracked down on ChatGPT copycats and clones, allowing for more original apps to find their footing.",

      "text": "It sounds like the start of a 21st-century horror film: Your browser history has been public all along, and you had no idea. That\u2019s basically what it feels like right now on the new stand-alone Meta AI app, where swathes of people are publishing their ostensibly private conversations with the chatbot.\nWhen you ask the AI a question, you have the option of hitting a share button, which then directs you to a screen showing a preview of the post, which you can then publish. But some users appear blissfully unaware that they are sharing these text conversations, audio clips, and images publicly with the world.\nWhen I woke up this morning, I did not expect to hear an audio recording of a man in a Southern accent asking, \u201cHey, Meta, why do some farts stink more than other farts?\u201d\nFlatulence-related inquiries are the least of Meta\u2019s problems. On the Meta AI app, I have seen people ask for help with tax evasion, if their family members would be arrested for their proximity to white-collar crimes, or how to write a character reference letter for an employee facing legal troubles, with that person\u2019s first and last name included. Others, like security expert Rachel Tobac, found examples of people\u2019s home addresses and sensitive court details, among other private information.\nWhen reached by TechCrunch, a Meta spokesperson did not comment on the record.\nWhether you admit to committing a crime or having a weird rash, this is a privacy nightmare. Meta does not indicate to users what their privacy settings are as they post, or where they are even posting to. So, if you log into Meta AI with Instagram, and your Instagram account is public, then so too are your searches about how to meet \u201cbig booty women.\u201d\nMuch of this could have been avoided if Meta didn\u2019t ship an app with the bonkers idea that people would want to see each other\u2019s conversations with Meta AI, or if anyone at Meta could have foreseen that this kind of feature would be problematic. There is a reason why Google has never tried to turn its search engine into a social media feed \u2014 or why AOL\u2019s publication of pseudonymized users\u2019 searches in 2006 went so badly. It\u2019s a recipe for disaster.\nAccording to Appfigures, an app intelligence firm, the Meta AI app has only been downloaded 6.5 million times since it debuted on April 29.\nThat might be impressive for an indie app, but we aren\u2019t talking about a first-time developer making a niche game. This is one of the world\u2019s wealthiest companies sharing an app with technology that it\u2019s invested billions of dollars into.\nAs each second passes, these seemingly innocuous inquiries on the Meta AI app inch closer to a viral mess. In a matter of hours, more and more posts have appeared on the app that indicate clear trolling, like someone sharing their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and asking for a cybersecurity job, or an account with a Pepe the Frog avatar asking how to make a water bottle bong.\nIf Meta wanted to get people to actually use its Meta AI app, then public embarrassment is certainly one way of getting attention."

      "text": "Anthropic, one of the world\u2019s largest AI vendors, has a powerful family of generative AI models called Claude. These models can perform a range of tasks, from captioning images and writing emails to solving math and coding challenges.\nWith Anthropic\u2019s model ecosystem growing so quickly, it can be tough to keep track of which Claude models do what. To help, we\u2019ve put together a guide to Claude, which we\u2019ll keep updated as new models and upgrades arrive.\nClaude models\nClaude models are named after literary works of art: Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. The latest are:\n- Claude 3.5 Haiku, a lightweight model.\n- Claude 3.7 Sonnet, a midrange, hybrid reasoning model. This is currently Anthropic\u2019s flagship AI model.\n- Claude 3 Opus, a large model.\nCounterintuitively, Claude 3 Opus \u2014 the largest and most expensive model Anthropic offers \u2014 is the least capable Claude model at the moment. However, that\u2019s sure to change when Anthropic releases an updated version of Opus.\nMost recently, Anthropic released Claude 3.7 Sonnet, its most advanced model to date. This AI model is different from Claude 3.5 Haiku and Claude 3 Opus because it\u2019s a hybrid AI reasoning model, which can give both real-time answers and more considered, \u201cthought-out\u201d answers to questions.\nWhen using Claude 3.7 Sonnet, users can choose whether to turn on the AI model\u2019s reasoning abilities, which prompt the model to \u201cthink\u201d for a short or long period of time.\nWhen reasoning is turned on, Claude 3.7 Sonnet will spend anywhere from a few seconds to a couple minutes in a \u201cthinking\u201d phase before answering. During this phase, the AI model is breaking down the user\u2019s prompt into smaller parts and checking its answers.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $600+ before prices rise.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet is Anthropic\u2019s first AI model that can \u201creason,\u201d a technique many AI labs have turned to as traditional methods of improving AI performance taper off.\nEven with its reasoning disabled, Claude 3.7 Sonnet remains one of the tech industry\u2019s top-performing AI models.\nIn November, Anthropic released an improved \u2014 and more expensive \u2014 version of its lightweight AI model, Claude 3.5 Haiku. This model outperforms Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3 Opus on several benchmarks, but it can\u2019t analyze images like Claude 3 Opus or Claude 3.7 Sonnet can.\nAll Claude models \u2014 which have a standard 200,000-token context window \u2014 can also follow multistep instructions, use tools (e.g., stock ticker trackers), and produce structured output in formats like JSON.\nA context window is the amount of data a model like Claude can analyze before generating new data, while tokens are subdivided bits of raw data (like the syllables \u201cfan,\u201d \u201ctas,\u201d and \u201ctic\u201d in the word \u201cfantastic\u201d). Two hundred thousand tokens is equivalent to about 150,000 words, or a 600-page novel.\nUnlike many major generative AI models, Anthropic\u2019s can\u2019t access the internet, meaning they\u2019re not particularly great at answering current events questions. They also can\u2019t generate images \u2014 only simple line diagrams.\nAs for the major differences between Claude models, Claude 3.7 Sonnet is faster than Claude 3 Opus and better understands nuanced and complex instructions. Haiku struggles with sophisticated prompts, but it\u2019s the swiftest of the three models.\nClaude model pricing\nThe Claude models are available through Anthropic\u2019s API and managed platforms such as Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud\u2019s Vertex AI.\nHere\u2019s the Anthropic API pricing:\n- Claude 3.5 Haiku costs 80 cents per million input tokens (~750,000 words), or $4 per million output tokens\n- Claude 3.7 Sonnet costs $3 per million input tokens, or $15 per million output tokens\n- Claude 3 Opus costs $15 per million input tokens, or $75 per million output tokens\nAnthropic offers prompt caching and batching to yield additional runtime savings.\nPrompt caching lets developers store specific \u201cprompt contexts\u201d that can be reused across API calls to a model, while batching processes asynchronous groups of low-priority (and subsequently cheaper) model inference requests.\nClaude plans and apps\nFor individual users and companies looking to simply interact with the Claude models via apps for the web, Android, and iOS, Anthropic offers a free Claude plan with rate limits and other usage restrictions.\nUpgrading to one of the company\u2019s subscriptions removes those limits and unlocks new functionality. The current plans are:\n- Claude Pro.\n- Claude Team, for small businesses\n- Claude Enterprise, for larger companies\nClaude Pro, which costs $20 per month, comes with 5x higher rate limits, priority access, and previews of upcoming features.\nBeing business-focused, Team \u2014 which costs $30 per user per month \u2014 adds a dashboard to control billing and user management and integrations with data repos such as codebases and customer relationship management platforms (e.g., Salesforce). A toggle enables or disables citations to verify AI-generated claims. (Like all models, Claude hallucinates from time to time.)\nBoth Pro and Team subscribers get Projects, a feature that grounds Claude\u2019s outputs in knowledge bases, which can be style guides, interview transcripts, and so on. These customers, along with free-tier users, can also tap into Artifacts, a workspace where users can edit and add to content like code, apps, website designs, and other docs generated by Claude.\nFor customers who need even more, there\u2019s Claude Enterprise, which allows companies to upload proprietary data into Claude so that Claude can analyze the info and answer questions about it. Claude Enterprise also comes with a larger context window (500,000 tokens), GitHub integration for engineering teams to sync their GitHub repositories with Claude, and Projects and Artifacts.\nA word of caution\nAs is the case with all generative AI models, there are risks associated with using Claude.\nThe models occasionally make mistakes when summarizing or answering questions because of their tendency to hallucinate. They\u2019re also trained on public web data, some of which may be copyrighted or under a restrictive license. Anthropic and many other AI vendors argue that the fair-use doctrine shields them from copyright claims. But that hasn\u2019t stopped data owners from filing lawsuits.\nAnthropic offers policies to protect certain customers from courtroom battles arising from fair-use challenges. However, they don\u2019t resolve the ethical quandary of using models trained on data without permission.\nThis article was originally published on October 19, 2024. It was updated on February 25, 2025, to include new details about Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude 3.5 Haiku."

      "text": "Fast-growing Swedish AI vibe coding startup Lovable has become Europe\u2019s latest unicorn. Only eight months since its launch, the startup has raised a $200 million Series A round led by Accel at a $1.8 billion valuation.\nLike Cursor and other platforms that help developers write code and build apps by harnessing the coding and reasoning abilities of large language models, Stockholm-based Lovable helps people use natural language to create websites and apps. The startup\u2019s trajectory so far has charted straight toward the sky, with the company claiming it now has more than 2.3 million active users.\nThose users are using Lovable for free, to be clear, but in a recent talk, the startup\u2019s CEO Anton Osika said it now has more than 180,000 paying subscribers, and the company had reached annual recurring revenues of $75 million in seven months. That traction likely contributed to this oversized Series A.\nThe Series A saw participation from existing investors, which include 20VC, byFounders, Creandum, Hummingbird, and Visionaries Club. In February, Creandum led a $15 million pre-series A round in the company, which at the time said it had reached annual recurring revenue of $17 million and had 30,000 paying customers, with \u201cjust $2 million spent.\u201c\nThe startup has managed this hockey-stick growth with a pretty sparse team of only 45 full-time employees. That\u2019s almost as many as the high-profile angel investors who it said participated in this round, including Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Remote CEO Job van der Voort, Slack co-founder Stewart Butterfield, and HubSpot co-founder Dharmesh Shah.\nMost of Lovable\u2019s traction seems to come from non-technical users, who use it to create prototypes that they can collaborate on later with developers to build more fleshed-out apps and websites. This, and tests, are likely the bulk of the 10 million projects that have been created on the platform to date, the company said in a press release.\nBut Lovable also envisions itself becoming a tool that can be used to create production-grade applications that underpin full-fledged businesses.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

(Going by some clues on the post, that startup seems to be ad-testing platform Stardust \u2014 we\u2019ve reached out to Startdust\u2019s founder for confirmation, but haven\u2019t heard back.)\nOsika also celebrated that an app made by a large Brazilian edtech company using Lovable had grossed $3 million in 48 hours. This could present another growth avenue for Lovable, which has already managed to acquire enterprise customers, including Klarna and HubSpot."

      "text": "ChatGPT is the hottest topic of discussion in the tech industry. OpenAI\u2019s chatbot that answers questions in natural language has attracted interest from users and developers. Some developers are trying to take advantage of the trend by making dubious apps \u2014 both on the App Store and the Play Store \u2014 that aim to make money in the name of pro versions or extra credits to get more answers from AI.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that ChatGPT is free to use for anyone on the web and OpenAI hasn\u2019t released any official mobile app. While there are plenty of apps that take advantage of GPT-3, there is no official ChatGPT API.\nAs Macrumors noted, an app named \u201cChatGPT Chat GPT AI With GPT-3,\u201d has managed to reach the top charts in the productivity category in multiple countries. (Update: following publication, this particular app was pulled from the App Store. But many other apps referencing \u201cChatGPT\u201d in their name or description remain.)\nWhile the app is free, it offers weekly ($7.99) and monthly ($49.99) packs to have unlimited chats with the AI bot. Some of the reviews of the app suggest that the subscription doesn\u2019t add any value and the app appears to be fake. There is no way to tell if the app produces any tangible results because I couldn\u2019t get past the loading screen.\nNotably, the developer had a similar app on the Play Store with more than 100,000 downloads (archived link), but it has been removed now.\nOver the weekend, CEO of edtech startup Bloomtech Austen Allred tweeted that the App Store is full of apps \u2014 with no association with OpenAI \u2014 that are trying to charge money for using ChatGPT.\nThe iOS App Store is full of folks putting ChatGPT into a paid wrapper with ambiguous language that would let you believe you\u2019re paying for ChatGPT pic.twitter.com/3w0rK14E5I\nTechcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

      "text": "Replit on Tuesday announced a strategic partnership deal with Microsoft that should be good for business for both of them.\nReplit will become available through Microsoft\u2019s enterprise cloud app store, Azure Marketplace, meaning Microsoft shops will be able to purchase Replit subscriptions there. Replit is also integrating its tech with a number of Microsoft cloud services like containers, virtual machines, and Microsoft\u2019s version of Postgres \u2014 the database that Replit supports \u2014 called Neon Serverless Postgres. That means that Azure should generate its share of revenue from Replit apps that are used in production.\nMicrosoft famously offers its own hugely popular vibe coder with GitHub Copilot, but Replit doesn\u2019t really compete with it too much, as they are geared toward different users and somewhat different use cases.\nCopilot competes with Anysphere\u2019s Cursor as an AI-powered, in-browser coding assistant used by programmers. Replit is popular with programmers, but it can also be used by people with little coding experience. Its users create web apps through natural language prompts, and Replit does the rest: setting up the database, the authentication, the storage, etc. Those with programming experience can then customize features directly, as Replit supports a number of programming languages.\nIn this case, the two companies are marketing this offering as a prototyping/designing tool, like a competitor to Figma. The companies are also aiming it at non-programmer business managers for build-it-yourself apps. For example, a sales manager could use it to build a tool that tracks correlations between contract renewals and customer support tickets.\n\u201cWe are enabling all employees across all functions to develop apps, regardless of coding experience, so we are complementary to Copilot from that perspective,\u201d a Replit spokesperson told TechCrunch.\nReplit is also one of the breakout stars of the vibe-coding world. In June, CEO Amjad Masad tweeted that in six months, the company went from $10 million in annual recurring revenue to $100 million.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Masad said in June that it hasn\u2019t needed to raise since: \u201cWe still have over half our funding in the bank.\u201d The startup claims that over 500,000 business users are on its platform\nReplit competes with a few other fast-growing startups, including European darling Lovable, which hit $50 million ARR around the same time period, its CEO said, and is reportedly in the process of raising a new round at around a $2 billion valuation, and Bolt, which grew to about $40 million ARR in about five months as well.\nIf there is any competitor taking an L from this partnership, it\u2019s Google Cloud: The apps built and run through Replit are typically hosted on Google Cloud. In fact, Replit has been such a feather in Google\u2019s cap that the cloud giant has profiled the partnership.\nHowever, this deal is nonexclusive, Replit confirmed to TechCrunch, meaning that the startup is not leaving Google Cloud but is growing to support Microsoft shops. That also means that other popular vibe coders could strike similar Microsoft deals."

      "text": "Elon Musk\u2019s AI company, xAI, late on Wednesday released its latest flagship AI model, Grok 4, and unveiled a new $300-per-month AI subscription plan, SuperGrok Heavy.\nGrok is xAI\u2019s answer to models like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini, and can analyze images and respond to questions. In recent months, Grok has become more deeply integrated into Musk\u2019s social network, X, which was recently acquired by xAI. However, that has also put Grok\u2019s misbehavior front and center for millions of users.\nThe expectations are high for Grok 4. The latest AI model from xAI will be stacked up against OpenAI\u2019s forthcoming AI model, GPT-5, which is expected to launch later this summer.\n\u201cWith respect to academic questions, Grok 4 is better than PhD level in every subject, no exceptions,\u201d said Elon Musk during a livestream Wednesday night. \u201cAt times, it may lack common sense, and it has not yet invented new technologies or discovered new physics, but that is just a matter of time.\u201d\nThe launch of Grok 4 comes amid a tumultuous week for Elon Musk\u2019s companies. Earlier on Wednesday, Linda Yaccarino stepped down from her role as the CEO of X after roughly two years with the company. X has yet to announce her successor.\nYaccarino\u2019s departure comes just days after Grok\u2019s official, automated X account responded to users with antisemitic comments criticizing Hollywood\u2019s \u201cJewish executives\u201d and praising Hitler. xAI had to briefly limit Grok\u2019s account and delete the offensive posts. In response to the incident, xAI appeared to have removed a recently added section from Grok\u2019s public system prompt, a list of instructions for the AI chatbot to follow that told it not to shy away from making \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d claims.\nMusk and xAI\u2019s leaders largely avoided discussing the incident, instead focusing on Grok 4\u2019s performance and capabilities.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nOn Wednesday, xAI launched two models: Grok 4 and Grok 4 Heavy \u2014 the latter being the company\u2019s \u201cmulti-agent version\u201d that offers increased performance. Musk claimed that Grok 4 Heavy spawns multiple agents to work on a problem simultaneously, and then they all compare their work \u201clike a study group\u201d to find the best answer.\nThe company claims that Grok 4 shows frontier-level performance on several benchmarks, including Humanity\u2019s Last Exam \u2014 a challenging test measuring AI\u2019s ability to answer thousands of crowdsourced questions on subjects like math, humanities, and natural science. According to xAI, Grok 4 scored 25.4% on Humanity\u2019s Last Exam without \u201ctools,\u201d outperforming Google\u2019s Gemini 2.5 Pro, which scored 21.6%, and OpenAI\u2019s o3 (high), which scored 21%.\nxAI claims that Grok 4 Heavy, with \u201ctools,\u201d was able to achieve a score of 44.4%, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro with tools, which scored 26.9%.\nThe nonprofit Arc Prize says that Grok achieves a new state-of-the-art score on its ARC-AGI-2 test \u2014 another difficult benchmark that consists of puzzle-like problems where an AI has to identify visual patterns \u2014 scoring 16.2%. That\u2019s nearly twice the score of the next best commercial AI model, Claude Opus 4.\nAlongside Grok 4 and Grok 4 Heavy, xAI launched its most expensive AI subscription plan yet, a $300-per-month subscription called SuperGrok Heavy. Subscribers to the plan will get an early preview to Grok 4 Heavy, as well as early access to new features. The plan is similar to ultra-premium tiers offered by OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, but xAI now offers the most expensive subscription among major AI providers.\nSuperGrok Heavy subscribers may get early access to some new products xAI plans to launch in the coming months. The company said Wednesday that an AI coding model is coming in August, a multi-modal agent in September, and a video-generation model in October.\nxAI is releasing Grok 4 through its API in an effort to get developers to build applications with the model. The company notes that xAI\u2019s enterprise sector is only two months old; however, it plans to work with hyperscalers to make Grok available through their cloud platforms.\nDespite Grok\u2019s frontier-level performance on benchmarks, it may prove difficult for xAI to move past its recent mishaps as it tries to pitch Grok to businesses as a real contender to ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. Whether businesses are ready to adopt Grok, flaws and all, remains to be seen."

      "text": "Google\u2019s trying to make waves with Gemini, its flagship suite of generative AI models, apps, and services. But what\u2019s Gemini? How can you use it? And how does it stack up to other generative AI tools such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Meta\u2019s Llama, and Microsoft\u2019s Copilot?\nTo make it easier to keep up with the latest Gemini developments, we\u2019ve put together this handy guide, which we\u2019ll keep updated as new Gemini models, features, and news about Google\u2019s plans for Gemini are released.\nWhat is Gemini?\nGemini is Google\u2019s long-promised, next-gen generative AI model family. Developed by Google\u2019s AI research labs DeepMind and Google Research, it comes in several flavors:\n- Gemini Ultra, a very large model.\n- Gemini Pro, a large model \u2014 though smaller than Ultra. The latest version, Gemini 2.0 Pro, is Google\u2019s current flagship.\n- Gemini Flash, a speedier, \u201cdistilled\u201d version of Pro.\n- Gemini Flash-Lite, a slightly smaller and faster version of Gemini Flash.\n- Gemini Flash Thinking, a model with \u201creasoning\u201d capabilities.\n- Gemini Nano, two small models: Nano-1 and the slightly more capable Nano-2, which is meant to run offline.\nAll Gemini models were trained to be natively multimodal \u2014 that is, able to work with and analyze more than just text. Google says they were pre-trained and fine-tuned on a variety of public, proprietary, and licensed audio, images, and videos; a set of codebases; and text in different languages.\nThis sets Gemini apart from models such as Google\u2019s own LaMDA, which was trained exclusively on text data. LaMDA can\u2019t understand or generate anything beyond text (e.g., essays, emails, and so on), but that isn\u2019t necessarily the case with Gemini models. For example, the latest versions of Gemini Flash and Gemini Pro can natively output images and audio in addition to text.\nWe\u2019ll note here that the ethics and legality of training models on public data, in some cases without the data owners\u2019 knowledge or consent, are murky. Google has an AI indemnification policy to shield certain Google Cloud customers from lawsuits should they face them, but this policy contains carve-outs. Proceed with caution \u2014 particularly if you\u2019re intending on using Gemini commercially.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between the Gemini apps and Gemini models?\nGemini is separate and distinct from the Gemini apps on the web and mobile (formerly Bard).\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $600+ before prices rise.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nThe Gemini apps are clients that connect to various Gemini models and layer a chatbot-like interface on top. Think of them as front ends for Google\u2019s generative AI, analogous to ChatGPT and Anthropic\u2019s Claude family of apps.\nGemini on the web lives here. On Android, the Gemini app replaces the existing Google Assistant app. And on iOS, the Google and Google Search apps serve as that platform\u2019s Gemini clients.\nOn Android, users can bring up a Gemini overlay to ask questions about what\u2019s on their screen (for example, a YouTube video). Pressing and holding a supported smartphone\u2019s power button or saying, \u201cHey Google\u201d summons the overlay.\nGemini apps can accept images as well as voice commands and text \u2014 including files like PDFs, either uploaded or imported from Google Drive \u2014 and generate images. As you\u2019d expect, conversations with Gemini apps on mobile carry over to Gemini on the web and vice versa if you\u2019re signed in to the same Google Account in both places.\nGemini Advanced\nThe Gemini apps aren\u2019t the only means of recruiting Gemini models\u2019 assistance with tasks. Slowly but surely, Gemini-imbued features are making their way into staple Google apps and services like Gmail and Google Docs.\nTo take advantage of most of these, you\u2019ll need the Google One AI Premium Plan. Technically a part of Google One, the AI Premium Plan costs $20 a month and provides access to Gemini in Google Workspace apps like Docs, Maps, Slides, Sheets, Drive, and Meet. It also enables what Google calls Gemini Advanced, which brings the company\u2019s more sophisticated Gemini models to the Gemini apps.\nGemini Advanced users get extras here and there, too, like priority access to new features and models; the ability to run and edit Python code directly in Gemini; and increased limits for NotebookLM, Google\u2019s tool that turns PDFs into AI-generated podcasts. Recently, Gemini Advanced gained a memory feature that stores users\u2019 preferences and allows Gemini to refer to old conversations as context for current chats.\nOne of the more compelling Gemini Advanced exclusives, Deep Research, leverages Gemini models with \u201cadvanced reasoning\u201d to create detailed briefs. In response to a prompt (e.g. \u201cHow should I redesign my kitchen?\u201d), Deep Research develops a multi-step research plan and searches the web to craft a comprehensive answer.\nGemini in Gmail, Docs, Chrome, dev tools, and more\nIn Gmail, Gemini lives in a side panel that can write emails and summarize message threads. You\u2019ll find the same panel in Docs, where it helps write and refine content and brainstorm new ideas. Gemini in Slides generates slides and custom images. And Gemini in Google Sheets tracks and organizes data, creating tables and formulas.\nGemini is in Google Maps, where it can aggregate reviews about local businesses and offer recommendations like how to spend a day visiting a foreign city. The chatbot\u2019s reach extends to Drive, as well, where it can summarize files and folders and give quick facts about a project.\nGemini recently came to Google\u2019s Chrome browser in the form of an AI writing tool. You can use it to write something completely new or rewrite existing text; Google says it\u2019ll consider the web page you\u2019re on to make recommendations.\nElsewhere, you\u2019ll find hints of Gemini in Google\u2019s database products, cloud security tools, and app development platforms (including Firebase and Project IDX), as well as in apps like Google Photos (where Gemini handles natural language search queries), YouTube (where it helps brainstorm video ideas), and Meet (where it translates captions).\nCode Assist (formerly Duet AI for Developers), Google\u2019s suite of AI-powered assistance tools for code completion and generation, is offloading heavy computational lifting to Gemini. So are Google\u2019s security products underpinned by Gemini, like Gemini in Threat Intelligence, which can analyze large portions of potentially malicious code and let users perform natural language searches for ongoing threats or indicators of compromise.\nGemini extensions and Gems\nGemini Advanced users can create Gems, custom chatbots on desktop and mobile powered by Gemini models. Gems can be generated from natural language descriptions \u2014 for instance, \u201cYou\u2019re my running coach. Give me a daily running plan\u201d \u2014 and shared with other users or kept private.\nThe Gemini apps can tap into Google services via what Google calls \u201cGemini extensions.\u201d Gemini integrates with Drive, Gmail, YouTube, and more to respond to queries such as \u201cCould you summarize my last three emails?\u201d\nGemini Live in-depth voice chats\nAn experience called Gemini Live allows users to have \u201cin-depth\u201d voice chats with Gemini. It\u2019s available in the Gemini apps on mobile and the Pixel Buds Pro 2, where it can be accessed even when your phone\u2019s locked.\nWith Gemini Live enabled, you can interrupt Gemini while the chatbot\u2019s speaking to ask a clarifying question, and it\u2019ll adapt to your speech patterns in real-time. Live is also designed to serve as a virtual coach of sorts, helping you rehearse for events, brainstorm ideas, and so on. For instance, Live can suggest which skills to highlight in an upcoming job interview and give public speaking pointers.\nYou can read our review of Gemini Live here.\nGemini for teens\nGoogle offers a teen-focused Gemini experience for students.\nThe teen-focused Gemini has \u201cadditional policies and safeguards,\u201d including a tailored onboarding process and an AI literacy guide. Otherwise, it\u2019s nearly identical to the standard Gemini experience, down to the \u201cdouble-check\u201d feature that looks across the web to see if Gemini\u2019s responses are accurate.\nWhat can the Gemini models do?\nBecause Gemini models are multimodal, they can perform a range of multimodal tasks, from transcribing speech to captioning images and videos in real-time. Many of these capabilities have reached the product stage, and Google is promising much more in the not-too-distant future.\nOf course, Google offers no fix for some of the underlying problems with generative AI technology today, like its encoded biases and tendency to make things up (i.e., hallucinate). Neither do its rivals, but it\u2019s something to keep in mind when considering using or paying for Gemini.\nGemini Pro\u2019s capabilities\nGoogle says that its latest Pro model, Gemini 2.0 Pro, is its best yet for coding and complex prompts. 2.0 Pro outperforms its predecessor, Gemini 1.5 Pro, in benchmarks measuring programming, reasoning, math, and factual accuracy.\nIn Google\u2019s Vertex AI platform, developers can customize Gemini Pro to specific contexts and use cases via a fine-tuning or \u201cgrounding\u201d process. For example, Pro (along with other Gemini models) can be instructed to use data from third-party providers like Moody\u2019s, Thomson Reuters, ZoomInfo, and MSCI, or source information from corporate datasets or Google Search instead of its wider knowledge bank. Gemini Pro can also be connected to external, third-party APIs to perform particular actions, like automating a back-office workflow.\nGoogle\u2019s AI Studio platform offers templates for creating structured chat prompts with Pro. Developers can control the model\u2019s creative range and provide examples to give tone and style instructions \u2014 and also tune Pro\u2019s safety settings.\nGemini Flash is lightweight, while Gemini Flash Thinking adds reasoning\nGemini 2.0 Flash, which can use tools like Google Search and interact with external APIs, outperforms some of the larger Gemini 1.5 models on benchmarks measuring coding and image analysis. An offshoot of Gemini Pro, Flash is small and efficient \u2014 built for narrow, high-frequency generative AI workloads.\nGoogle says that Flash is particularly well-suited for tasks like summarization and chat apps, plus image and video captioning and data extraction from long documents and tables. Meanwhile, Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, a more compact version of Flash, outperforms Gemini 1.5 Flash but runs at the same price and speed, according to Google.\nLast December, Google released a \u201cthinking\u201d version of Gemini 2.0 Flash that\u2019s capable of \u201creasoning.\u201d The AI model takes a few seconds to work backward through a problem before it gives an answer, which can improve its reliability.\nGemini Nano can run on your phone\nGemini Nano is a tiny version of Gemini efficient enough to run directly on (some) devices instead of sending the task off to a server somewhere. So far, Nano powers a couple of features on the Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel 8, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9, and Samsung Galaxy S24, including Summarize in Recorder and Smart Reply in Gboard.\nThe Recorder app, which lets users push a button to record and transcribe audio, includes a Gemini-powered summary of recorded conversations, interviews, presentations, and other audio snippets. Users get summaries even if they don\u2019t have a signal or Wi-Fi connection \u2014 and in a nod to privacy, no data leaves their phone in process.\nNano is also in Gboard, Google\u2019s keyboard replacement. There, it powers Smart Reply, which helps to suggest the next thing you\u2019ll want to say when having a conversation in a messaging app such as WhatsApp.\nA future version of Android will tap Nano to alert users to potential scams during calls. The new weather app on Pixel phones uses Gemini Nano to generate tailored weather reports. And TalkBack, Google\u2019s accessibility service, employs Nano to create aural descriptions of objects for low-vision and blind users.\nGemini Ultra, MIA for now\nWe haven\u2019t seen much of Gemini Ultra in recent months. The model isn\u2019t available in the Gemini apps, and it isn\u2019t listed on Google\u2019s Gemini API pricing page. However, that doesn\u2019t mean Google won\u2019t bring Ultra back at some point in the future.\nHow much do the Gemini models cost?\nGemini 1.5 Pro, 1.5 Flash, 2.0 Flash, and 2.0 Flash-Lite are available through Google\u2019s Gemini API for building apps and services. They\u2019re pay-as-you-go. Here\u2019s the base pricing \u2014 not including add-ons \u2014 as of February 225:\n- Gemini 1.5 Pro: $1.25 per 1 million input tokens (for prompts up to 128K tokens) or $2.50 per 1 million input tokens (for prompts longer than 128K tokens); $5 per 1 million output tokens (for prompts up to 128K tokens) or $10 per 1 million output tokens (for prompts longer than 128K tokens)\n- Gemini 1.5 Flash: 7.5 cents per 1 million input tokens (for prompts up to 128K tokens), 15 cents per 1 million input tokens (for prompts longer than 128K tokens), 30 cents per 1 million output tokens (for prompts up to 128K tokens), 60 cents per 1 million output tokens (for prompts longer than 128K tokens)\n- Gemini 2.0 Flash: 10 cents per 1 million input tokens, 40 cents per 1 million output tokens. For audio, 70 cents per 1 million input tokens.\n- Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite: 7.5 cents per 1 million input tokens, 30 cents per 1 million output tokens.\nTokens are subdivided bits of raw data, like the syllables \u201cfan,\u201d \u201ctas,\u201d and \u201ctic\u201d in the word \u201cfantastic\u201d; 1 million tokens is equivalent to about 750,000 words. Input refers to tokens fed into the model, while output refers to tokens that the model generates.\n2.0 Pro pricing has yet to be announced, and Nano is still in early access.\nIs Gemini coming to the iPhone?\nIt might.\nApple has said that it\u2019s in talks to put Gemini and other third-party models to use for a number of features in its Apple Intelligence suite. Following a keynote presentation at WWDC 2024, Apple SVP Craig Federighi confirmed plans to work with models, including Gemini, but he didn\u2019t divulge any additional details.\nThis post was originally published February 16, 2024, and is updated regularly."

      "text": "DeepSeek has gone viral.\nChinese AI lab DeepSeek broke into the mainstream consciousness this week after its chatbot app rose to the top of the Apple App Store charts (and Google Play, as well). DeepSeek\u2019s AI models, which were trained using compute-efficient techniques, have led Wall Street analysts \u2014 and technologists \u2014 to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain.\nBut where did DeepSeek come from, and how did it rise to international fame so quickly?\nDeepSeek\u2019s trader origins\nDeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions.\nAI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng co-founded High-Flyer in 2015. Wenfeng, who reportedly began dabbling in trading while a student at Zhejiang University, launched High-Flyer Capital Management as a hedge fund in 2019 focused on developing and deploying AI algorithms.\nIn 2023, High-Flyer started DeepSeek as a lab dedicated to researching AI tools separate from its financial business. With High-Flyer as one of its investors, the lab spun off into its own company, also called DeepSeek.\nFrom day one, DeepSeek built its own data center clusters for model training. But like other AI companies in China, DeepSeek has been affected by U.S. export bans on hardware. To train one of its more recent models, the company was forced to use Nvidia H800 chips, a less-powerful version of a chip, the H100, available to U.S. companies.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nDeepSeek\u2019s technical team is said to skew young. The company reportedly aggressively recruits doctorate AI researchers from top Chinese universities. DeepSeek also hires people without any computer science background to help its tech better understand a wide range of subjects, per The New York Times.\nDeepSeek\u2019s strong models\nDeepSeek unveiled its first set of models \u2014 DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat \u2014 in November 2023. But it wasn\u2019t until last spring, when the startup released its next-gen DeepSeek-V2 family of models, that the AI industry started to take notice.\nDeepSeek-V2, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing system, performed well in various AI benchmarks \u2014 and was far cheaper to run than comparable models at the time. It forced DeepSeek\u2019s domestic competition, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cut the usage prices for some of their models, and make others completely free.\nDeepSeek-V3, launched in December 2024, only added to DeepSeek\u2019s notoriety.\nAccording to DeepSeek\u2019s internal benchmark testing, DeepSeek V3 outperforms both downloadable, openly available models like Meta\u2019s Llama and \u201cclosed\u201d models that can only be accessed through an API, like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o.\nEqually impressive is DeepSeek\u2019s R1 \u201creasoning\u201d model. Released in January, DeepSeek claims R1 performs as well as OpenAI\u2019s o1 model on key benchmarks.\nBeing a reasoning model, R1 effectively fact-checks itself, which helps it to avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models. Reasoning models take a little longer \u2014 usually seconds to minutes longer \u2014 to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside is that they tend to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and math.\nThere is a downside to R1, DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek\u2019s other models, however. Being Chinese-developed AI, they\u2019re subject to benchmarking by China\u2019s internet regulator to ensure that its responses \u201cembody core socialist values.\u201d In DeepSeek\u2019s chatbot app, for example, R1 won\u2019t answer questions about Tiananmen Square or Taiwan\u2019s autonomy.\nIn March, DeepSeek surpassed 16.5 million visits. \u201c[F]or March, DeepSeek is in second place, despite seeing traffic drop 25% from where it was in February, based on daily visits,\u201d David Carr, editor at Similarweb, told TechCrunch. It still pales in comparison to ChatGPT, which surged past 500 million weekly active users in March.\nIn May, DeepSeek released an updated version of its R1 reasoning AI model on the developer platform Hugging Face.\nA disruptive approach\nIf DeepSeek has a business model, it\u2019s not clear what that model is, exactly. The company prices its products and services well below market value \u2014 and gives others away for free. It\u2019s also not taking investor money, despite a ton of VC interest.\nThe way DeepSeek tells it, efficiency breakthroughs have enabled it to maintain extreme cost competitiveness. Some experts dispute the figures the company has supplied, however.\nWhatever the case may be, developers have taken to DeepSeek\u2019s models, which aren\u2019t open source as the phrase is commonly understood but are available under permissive licenses that allow for commercial use. According to Clem Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, one of the platforms hosting DeepSeek\u2019s models, developers on Hugging Face have created over 500 \u201cderivative\u201d models of R1 that have racked up 2.5 million downloads combined.\nDeepSeek\u2019s success against larger and more established rivals has been described as \u201cupending AI\u201d and \u201cover-hyped.\u201d The company\u2019s success was at least in part responsible for causing Nvidia\u2019s stock price to drop by 18% in January, and for eliciting a public response from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. In March, U.S. Commerce department bureaus told staffers that DeepSeek will be banned on their government devices, according to Reuters.\nMicrosoft announced that DeepSeek is available on its Azure AI Foundry service, Microsoft\u2019s platform that brings together AI services for enterprises under a single banner. When asked about DeepSeek\u2019s impact on Meta\u2019s AI spending during its first-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said spending on AI infrastructure will continue to be a \u201cstrategic advantage\u201d for Meta. In March, OpenAI called DeepSeek \u201cstate-subsidized\u201d and \u201cstate-controlled,\u201d and recommends that the U.S. government consider banning models from DeepSeek.\nDuring Nvidia\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang emphasized DeepSeek\u2019s \u201cexcellent innovation,\u201d saying that it and other \u201creasoning\u201d models are great for Nvidia because they need so much more compute.\nAt the same time, some companies are banning DeepSeek, and so are entire countries and governments, including South Korea. New York state also banned DeepSeek from being used on government devices.\nIn May, Microsoft vice chairman and president Brad Smith said in a Senate hearing that Microsoft employees aren\u2019t allowed to use DeepSeek due to data security and propaganda concerns.\nAs for what DeepSeek\u2019s future might hold, it\u2019s not clear. Improved models are a given. But the U.S. government appears to be growing wary of what it perceives as harmful foreign influence. In March, The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. will likely ban DeepSeek on government devices.\nThis story was originally published January 28, 2025, and will be updated regularly."

      "text": "This is the fifth edition of our Top 100 Gen AI Consumer Apps which reflects two and a half years of data on how everyday AI usage is evolving.\nThis is the fifth edition of our Top 100 Gen AI Consumer Apps which reflects two and a half years of data on how everyday AI usage is evolving.\nThe biggest takeaway from this edition of the list? The ecosystem is starting to stabilize, with 11 new names on the web list driven by traffic increases.* This compares with 17 newcomers in our March 2025 ranking. The mobile list has significantly more newcomers (14), as the App Stores have cracked down on \u201cChatGPT copycats\u201d\u2014opening up room for more original mobile apps.\n*Note \u2013 Google has four new products on the list as they have further separated the domains, allowing us to track their AI initiatives individually for the first time! This yields 15 newcomers in total, but these four would have ranked on prior lists if they had been measurable.\nFor the second time, we\u2019re also publishing the \u201cBrink List\u201d: the next 10 companies (five on web, five on mobile) that just missed the cut-off. From last edition\u2019s web Brink List, one company moved into the top 100\u2014Lovable, jumping to an impressive #22 in the rankings! This jump highlights the broader rise of AI-powered app generation.\nFrom the last mobile Brink List, two companies\u2014PolyBuzz and Pixverse\u2014moved into the core rankings.\nA methodology note: the lists are a ranking of the top 50 AI-first web products (by unique monthly visits, per Similarweb) and top 50 AI-first mobile apps (by monthly active users, per Sensor Tower). Products that have added significant generative AI features but are not AI-native, such as Canva and Notion, are not included here.\nHere are some of our other top takeaways:\nGoogle saw four entrants on the web list\u2014for the first time, we are able to rank their traffic and include them each independently. The company\u2019s general LLM assistant, Gemini, came in second place behind ChatGPT, with approximately 12% of ChatGPT\u2019s visits on web.\nWhat other Google products made the list? AI Studio debuted in the top 10. The site, which is developer-oriented, hosts a sandbox to start building with Gemini models, including multimodal models (ex. talk and stream with Gemini Live).\nAI Studio was followed by NotebookLM at #13, now hosted as an independent website after debuting as part of Google Labs. NotebookLM first went viral nearly a year ago and has grown steadily since, with only a slight dip over the summer (likely when academic users temporarily churn).\nGoogle Labs, the consumer-facing home for AI experiments at Google, came in at #39 on the list. Labs hosts Flow, where users can try video model Veo 3, as well as a variety of other apps, including Doppl (clothing try-on), Portraits (AI coaches), and Project Mariner (agentic browser). Google Labs\u2019s traffic spiked more than 13% following Veo 3\u2019s launch in May 2025, its largest one-month climb over the past year.\nOn mobile, Gemini ranks #2 behind ChatGPT \u2013 but by a much narrower margin, with nearly half as many monthly active users (MAUs). Gemini sees particularly strong usage on Android devices, with nearly 90% of their MAU base represented here, compared to 60% of users on Android for ChatGPT.\nIn the battle of the general LLM assistants, ChatGPT still leads, but Google, Grok, and Meta are narrowing the gap.\nX\u2019s (formerly Twitter) assistant Grok ranked fourth on web and #23 on mobile. The company\u2019s jump on mobile has been particularly striking, going from a \u201ccold start\u201d with no app at the end of 2024 to upwards of 20M monthly active users now.\nGrok saw a particularly large bump in mobile usage in July 2025, climbing nearly 40% with the release of new model Grok 4 (with superior reasoning, real-time search, and tool integration) on July 9. This was followed by the introduction of AI companion avatars on July 14. At launch, anime avatar Ani (which includes NSFW options) was particularly popular.\nMeta has seen more muted growth (thus far) for its efforts. General assistant Meta AI ranked #46 on web, and missed the cutoff for the mobile list. Meta AI debuted in late May 2025 but saw a much slower ramp than Grok, especially after a June 2025 incident when users realized some posts were appearing on a public feed.\nElsewhere in the general LLM assistant battle, DeepSeek and Claude have both significantly flattened on mobile, with DeepSeek falling off its peak by 22%. Perplexity has continued to show strong growth alongside Grok.\nOn web, DeepSeek saw an even more dramatic dropoff, down more than 40% from its peak in February 2025, while Perplexity and Claude have continued to grow.\nOn the web list, three companies that primarily serve users in China rank in the top 20. Each has a Chinese-language website and more than 75% of its traffic coming from China. This includes #9 Quark, Alibaba\u2019s \u201call-in-one\u201d AI assistant (which also ranks #47 on the mobile list), #12 Doubao, Bytedance\u2019s general LLM product (ranked #4 on mobile), and #17 Kimi, a chatbot from startup Moonshot AI.\nWhy are these products appearing on the list? China is the world\u2019s largest country, and direct access to many non-Chinese developed general LLM assistants\u2014such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude\u2014is either blocked or limited. AI providers that want to operate in China have to register and obtain a license, which requires hosting data onshore and complying with censorship and content moderation rules.\nSome users still access unregistered products via VPNs, or are able to access products from within China via corporate or academic network gateways\u2014which is why traffic for products like ChatGPT in China is non-zero.\nA significant percentage of the web list was also developed in China, and now \u201cexported\u201d globally\u2014with the vast majority of usage in other countries. Some of these tools are even blocked in China. Public data suggests seven additional companies fit this criteria\u2014including Deepseek, Hailuo and Kling (video generation models), SeaArt (image generation), Cutout Pro (image editing), and Manus and Monica (prosumer / productivity).\nChinese video models, in particular, have tended to have an advantage over Western-developed models\u2014both because there are more researchers focused on video in China, and there are fewer IP regulations (with likely training on copyrighted data). Veo 3 was the first U.S. model to break this trend, which is partially trained on YouTube data.\nThis trend is even more striking in the mobile ranks. An estimated 22 of the 50 apps were developed in China, while only three are primarily used in China. There is particularly heavy concentration in the photo and video category, as Meitu alone produced five entries: Photo & Video Editor, BeautyPlus, BeautyCam, Wink, and Airbrush. Bytedance is also a significant player, producing Doubao and Cici (general LLM assistant), Gauth (edtech), and Hypic (photo / video editing).\nIn our last ranking in March 2025, vibe coding had just begun to emerge\u2014with only Bolt on the web list. Now, Bolt is on the Brink List (just missing the cut!), while Lovable and Replit both debuted on the main list.\nWhile vibe coding usage may seem transitory, early data reveals that these users stick around\u2014or, at least enough of them do and expand their usage over time. Data from credit card panel provider Consumer Edge shows cohorts for U.S. based users of one top vibe coding platform see revenue retention upwards of 100% for several months post-signup. This means that including users who churn, cohorts are growing overall spend on a monthly basis.\nThese platforms are also driving usage to other AI products. Sites built and published via Replit and via Lovable (without custom domains) appear under traffic for replit.app and lovable.app, respectively. Both have significant traffic of their own (traffic to lovable.app would have ranked in the top 50 of the list), but less traffic than their builder-face sites.\nProducts that are part of the \u201cvibe coding stack\u201d are also seeing jumps in traffic, as vibe coders adopt them to push their projects live. These are not eligible for the list (as they are not AI-native companies themselves)\u2014the canonical example is Supabase, a database provider. Supabase\u2019s traffic has been in near-lockstep with the rise of core vibe coding platforms, with a significant acceleration over the past nine months as compared to the years prior.\nWe see real room left for growth and new products within vibe coding\u2014for more, read Batteries Included, Opinions Required: The Specialization of App Gen Platforms.\nIn our five iterations of the web top 50, fourteen companies have appeared every time \u2013 we call them the \u201cAll Stars\u201d!!\nThese companies represent a true cross section of consumer behavior with AI\u2014general assistance (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Poe); companionship (Character AI); image generation (Midjourney, Leonardo); image and video editing (Veed, Cutout); voice generation (Eleven Labs); productivity tools (Photoroom, Gamma, Quillbot); and model hosting (Civitai, HuggingFace).\nIn our first list (published almost two years ago!), we wondered whether all leading AI consumer companies would train their own foundation models. Now, we have an answer\u2014of the fourteen All Stars, five have proprietary models, while seven utilize API-available or open source models from other companies, and two are model aggregators.\nInterestingly, despite the list\u2019s increasingly global scope, all fourteen consistent listmakers come from just five countries: the U.S., the UK (Eleven Labs, Veed), Australia (Leonardo); China (Cutout Pro); and France (Photoroom, HuggingFace). And, all but two have now raised venture funding\u2014Midjourney is famously bootstrapped, and Cutout Pro has also not fundraised.\nExcluding the very first list, an additional five companies would make the cut\u2014reflecting their recent momentum. These similarly represent a variety of AI consumer applications, including: Claude and DeepAI (general assistance), JanitorAI (companionship), Pixelcut (image editing), and Suno (music generation).\nWe\u2019ll be tracking which All Stars persist, and which new ones emerge, in the next five editions."

      "text": "Chinese AI lab DeepSeek provoked the first Silicon Valley freak-out of 2025 after releasing open versions of AI models that compete with the best technology OpenAI, Meta, and Google have to offer.\nDeepSeek claims to have built its models highly efficiently and quickly (though some are skeptical of these claims), and is providing these models at a fraction of the price American AI companies charge. The development has rattled not only tech giants but the highest levels of the U.S. government, which fear that China is pulling ahead in the AI arms race.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if a lot of AI labs have war rooms going on right now,\u201d said Robert Nishihara, the co-founder of AI infrastructure startup Anyscale, in an interview with TechCrunch.\nThe rise of DeepSeek marks an inflection point for Silicon Valley\u2019s AI landscape. AI CEOs, founders, researchers, and investors tell TechCrunch that DeepSeek\u2019s models have major implications for American AI policy. Moreover, these experts say, the models serve as an indicator of the accelerating rate of AI progress.\n\u201cOf course [DeepSeek] was over-hyped,\u201d said Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, an assistant professor at NYU\u2019s Center for Data Science, in an interview. \u201cBut it\u2019s still very interesting, and there\u2019s a lot we can take from it.\u201d\nNew ways to get AI thinking\nOne of DeepSeek\u2019s key innovations in creating its R1 model was \u201cpure reinforcement learning,\u201d a trial-and-error approach, according to Workera CEO and Stanford adjunct lecturer Kian Katanforoosh.\nKatanforoosh compared DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough to a kid figuring out not to touch a hot plate by accidentally burning themselves.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\n\u201c[A kid] might touch a hot plate, get burned, and quickly learn not to do it again,\u201d Katanforoosh said via text. \u201cThat\u2019s pure reinforcement learning \u2014 learning from trial and error based on feedback [\u2026] DeepSeek\u2019s method is all about letting the model learn through experience alone.\u201d\nDeepSeek seems to have relied more heavily on reinforcement learning than other cutting edge AI models. OpenAI also used reinforcement learning techniques to develop o1, which the company revealed weeks before DeepSeek announced R1. OpenAI\u2019s upcoming o3 model achieves even better performance using largely similar methods, but also additional compute, the company claims.\nReinforcement learning represents one of the most promising ways to improve AI foundation models today, according to Katanforoosh. The term \u201cfoundation models\u201d generally refers to AI models trained on massive amounts of data, like images and text from the web. It seems likely that other AI labs will continue to push the limits of reinforcement learning to improve their AI models, especially given the success of DeepSeek.\nJust a few months ago, AI companies found themselves struggling to boost the performance of their foundation models. But the success of methods such as reinforcement learning and others, like supervised fine-tuning and test-time scaling, indicate that AI progress may be picking back up.\n\u201cR1 has given me a lot more confidence in the pace of progress staying high,\u201d said Nathan Lambert, a researcher at Ai2, in an interview with TechCrunch.\nA turning point for AI policy\nR1, which can be downloaded and run on any machine that meets the hardware requirements, matches or beats o1 on a number of AI benchmarks. While it\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve seen the performance gap narrow between \u201cclosed\u201d models like that of OpenAI and openly available models, the speed with which DeepSeek did it has taken the industry aback.\nThis may push the U.S. to increase its investment in open, or even fully open source, AI in order to compete with China. Martin Casado, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), tells TechCrunch that DeepSeek proves just how \u201cwrongheaded\u201d the regulatory rationale of the last two years has been.\n\u201cFor AI, I think this just shows us that [the United States] is not alone in our technical capability,\u201d Casado said in an interview. \u201cVery competitive solutions can come from anywhere, but in particular, China. Rather than hampering U.S. innovation, we should invest strongly in it. Open source does not in some way enable China. In fact, disallowing our companies from doing open source means that our technology doesn\u2019t proliferate as much.\u201d\nCasado seemed to be referring to former President Biden\u2019s recently repealed AI executive order and the vetoed California bill SB 1047, both of which a16z aggressively opposed. a16z has argued both measures prioritized preventing \u201coutlandish\u201d AI doomsday scenarios over American innovation. More broadly, Silicon Valley generally had success tamping down the \u201cAI doom movement\u201d in 2024. The real concern around AI, a16z and others have repeatedly said, is America losing its competitive edge to China.\nThat scenario seems much more tangible in light of DeepSeek\u2019s rise.\nNot for nothing, a16z is heavily invested in many of the open AI world\u2019s largest players, including Databricks, Mistral, and Black Forest Labs. The VC firm may also play an outsized role advising the Trump administration on AI. Former a16z partner Sriram Krishnan is now Trump\u2019s senior policy advisor for AI.\nPresident Trump said on Monday that DeepSeek should be a \u201cwakeup call\u201d for American AI companies, while praising the Chinese AI lab for its open approach. That lines up pretty closely with a16z\u2019s stance on AI.\n\u201cDeepSeek R1 is AI\u2019s Sputnik moment,\u201d said a16z co-founder Marc Andreessen in a post on X, referencing the launch of the Soviet Union\u2019s Earth-orbiting spacecraft decades ago that pushed the U.S. to seriously invest in its space program.\nThe rise of DeepSeek also appears to have changed the mind of open AI skeptics, like former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Just last year, Schmidt expressed concern about the proliferation of Western open AI models around the globe. But in an op-ed published Tuesday, Schmidt said DeepSeek\u2019s rise marks a \u201cturning point\u201d in the global AI race, and called for further investment in American open AI.\nLooking ahead\nIt\u2019s important not to overstate DeepSeek\u2019s accomplishments.\nFor example, some analysts are skeptical of DeepSeek\u2019s claim that it trained one of its frontier models, DeepSeek V3, for just $5.6 million \u2014 a pittance in the AI industry \u2014 using roughly 2,000 older Nvidia GPUs. The Chinese AI lab did not sprout up overnight, after all, and DeepSeek reportedly has a stockpile of more than 50,000 more capable Nvidia Hopper GPUs.\nDeepSeek\u2019s models are also flawed. According to a test by information-reliability organization NewsGuard, R1 provides inaccurate answers or non-answers 83% of the time when asked about news-related topics. A separate test found that R1 refuses to answer 85% of prompts related to China, possibly a consequence of the government censorship to which AI models developed in the country are subject.\nThen, there are the claims of IP theft. OpenAI says that it has evidence that DeepSeek used its AI models to train its own, using a process called distillation. If true, this would be a violation of OpenAI\u2019s terms, and would also make DeepSeek\u2019s accomplishments less impressive. For example, Berkeley researchers recently created a distilled reasoning model for just $450. (Of course, OpenAI is currently being sued by a number of parties for allegedly committing copyright infringement in training its own models.)\nStill, DeepSeek moved the needle with more efficient models \u2014 and it innovated. Lambert noted that, unlike o1, R1 reveals its \u201cthinking process\u201d to users. Lambert has observed that some users trust or believe AI reasoning models more when they see their internal process, during which they \u201cexplain their work.\u201d\nNow, we\u2019ll have to see how America\u2019s policymakers, and AI labs, respond.\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

      "text": "One month after China announced its provisional measures to oversee generative artificial intelligence, the country has granted approval to the first batch of large language model-empowered services for public use.\nEight generative AI applications have registered with China\u2019s cyberspace authority, including Baidu\u2019s Ernie Bot, ByteDance\u2019s Doubao, Sogou founder\u2019s Baichuan and chatbots built on the lab work of top research institutions like Tsinghua University and Chinese Academy of Sciences.\nAfter two decades of relatively laissez-faire tech policies, China today is clearly more concerned about its control over innovation rather than the speed of development. In recent years, China has created a handful of licensing frameworks to rein in its once-unfettered tech industry, giving it more oversight over the vast volumes of data shaping people\u2019s ideas and lives.\nTo launch a game in China, for instance, a company can\u2019t simply publish it on app stores but must go through an extensive filing process that includes rigorous content reviews.\nThe unpredictable nature of generative AI makes it an obvious target for Chinese authorities, who are among the most proactive in regulating the fast-evolving technology. The AI law requires algorithms that can influence public opinions to be registered with the relevant government organ and stipulates that generative AI service providers must obtain an administrative license to operate in the country.\nThe successful filings of the LLM chatbots could usher in a period of rapid growth and mass adoption in China months after the tech giants unveiled their ChatGPT counterparts but had to keep access limited to industry insiders. Within a day of the filing announcement, Baidu\u2019s Ernie Bot had climbed to the top of free iOS apps in China, giving the firm\u2019s share price in Hong Kong a modest boost on Thursday.\nChina unveils provisional rules for generative AI, including a licensing regime"
