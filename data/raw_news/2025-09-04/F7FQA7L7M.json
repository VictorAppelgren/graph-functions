  "description": "Andrew Cuomo challenges NYC mayoral opponent Zohran Mamdani to five debates across all of NYC's boroughs, while Mamdani counters by proposing to debate Donald Trump instead.",
  "content": "Andrew Cuomo challenged his NYC mayoral opponent, Zohran Mamdani, to five different debates across all five New York City boroughs during a press conference Thursday.\n\nThe challenge came as the former governor slammed Mamdani at his press conference in Manhattan's Upper West Side for failing \"to give a straight answer\" to reporters' questions, and changing his mind \"on everything\" he has said on the campaign trail.\n\n\"When you try to ask [Mamdani] a question, he will simply not answer, and he obfuscates. And, frankly, you guys let him get away with it,\" Cuomo told reporters Thursday. \"I won't let him get away with it. And New Yorkers won't let him get away with it.\"\n\nHours after Cuomo leveled his challenge to Mamdani, the self-described Democratic socialist shot back a proposal of his own: debate President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Let\u2019s cut out the middle man. Why should I debate Donald Trump\u2019s puppet when I could debate Donald Trump himself?\" Mamdani's campaign told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"If Donald Trump is serious about intervening in the mayoral race, he should come to New York City and debate me directly about why he\u2019s cutting SNAP benefits for hungry New Yorkers to give tax breaks to his wealthy donors.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth between Cuomo and Mamadani comes amid speculation that President Donald Trump is weighing whether to offer jobs in his administration to incumbent NYC Mayor Eric Adams and the GOP candidate for NYC mayor, Curtis Sliwa. The move to offer the two candidates a job is reportedly a bid to clear the field for Cuomo, multiple sources with intimate knowledge about the matter have said.\n\nWHITE HOUSE SILENT ON REPORT THAT TRUMP ALLIES HAVE WEIGHED LURING ADAMS TO ADMINISTRATION TO UNDERCUT MAMDANI\n\nThe former governor indicated during his Thursday press conference that he was aware of media reports about Trump possibly offering his NYC mayoral opponents jobs, subsequently clearing the field for him, but added that he has \"no idea\" if the reports are accurate. Cuomo said he has not spoken to either Mayor Eric Adams or President Trump about the matter.\n\n\"I know nothing about that speculation,\" Cuomo told reporters Thursday about the matter. His campaign did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNeither Adams nor his team responded to Fox News Digital's inquiries on Thursday either, but media reports Thursday indicated Adams met in Florida with Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, one of the president's closest advisors, to discuss a potential job with the Trump administration.\n\nNews of the Adams meeting came after media reports last week indicating Trump had personally phoned influential businessman John Catsimatidis, an Adams ally, to set a deadline for the mayor and Sliwa to drop out.\n\nJUDGE TELLS CUOMO TO STOP USING TAXPAYER MONEY TO \u2018RESURRECT HIS PUBLIC IMAGE\u2019 IN LEGAL CASE\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment on the matter.\n\nCuomo, who has positioned himself as the moderate left-wing alternative to Mamdani in the race, described Mamdani's policy proposals Thursday as \"absurd,\" \"out of the mainstream,\" and \"discordant with what New Yorkers believe.\"\n\nShortly after launching his independent bid for mayor last month, Cuomo proposed that all the other candidates in the race, with the exclusion of Mamdani, make a pledge to agree that whoever is not leading in the polls by mid-September, would step aside. The aim of the pledge, Cuomo indicated, is to ensure the candidate with the best opportunity to defeat Mamdani runs against him under the most favorable conditions possible.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHowever, the proposal has been rejected by Adams and Sliwa suggested to Fox News Digital Thursday that Cuomo and Adams are not even the main front-runners who New Yorkers want to win.\n\n\"This is a race between the two major party nominees, myself and Mamdani, and New Yorkers know I\u2019m the only one with the experience and grit to take him on,\" Sliwa told Fox News Digital. \"I\u2019m running to save New York City from decline and give working people the future they deserve.\"\n\nSpeaking specifically to Mamdani's response to Cuomo's debate challenge, Sliwa added that Mamdani \"is desperate to distract from his own radical agenda, so he hides behind cheap theatrics.\"",

      "text": "On Tuesday, a judge rejected former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s attempt to prolong a taxpayer-funded legal battle with a woman who accused him of sexual assault, saying the New York City mayoral candidate was trying to litigate in an effort to repair his tarnished reputation.\n\"Cuomo has not advanced any viable argument for why the taxpayers of this state should continue to foot the bill for his continued use of civil litigation discovery devices to further his efforts to resurrect his public image,\" state Supreme Court Justice Denise Hartman wrote in a decision posted online Monday.\nHartman\u2019s decision came a month after the state agreed to pay $450,000 to settle a lawsuit brought by Brittany Commisso, an ex-aide who said he sexually harassed and groped her while he was in office.\nHOCHUL AIDE ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT WAS FOCUS OF PRIOR BEHAVIOR PROBE: REPORT\nAn investigation by New York Attorney General Letitia James determined that the Democrat had sexually harassed at least 11 women.\nCuomo resigned in disgrace because of the allegations.\nCuomo, a Democrat, asked the judge not to discontinue the lawsuit without releasing text messages he said refute her allegations, Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi told Fox News Digital. In her ruling, Hartman allowed Commisso to drop the lawsuit and denied Cuomo\u2019s motion on the texts.\n\"Brittany Commisso\u2019s allegations are false and for four years she hid her contemporaneous text messages that obliterated her claims,\" Azzopardi said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"She is desperate to keep the texts from public scrutiny, which is why she suddenly settled her case for a fraction of her initial multimillion dollar demand soon after she was forced to produce them in her meritless lawsuit.\"\n\"Governor Cuomo will continue to fight for the release of all the evidence because it shows he didn\u2019t sexually harass anyone and further discredits the AG\u2019s political report. Release the evidence and let the public decide,\" he added.\nCommisso previously testified that Cuomo grabbed her buttocks while they took a selfie in the executive mansion in 2019 and that in 2020 he reached under her blouse and grabbed her breast. She revealed her identity for the first time in a joint interview with \"CBS This Morning\" and the Albany Times Union, just days after she became the first of Cuomo\u2019s accusers to file a criminal complaint against him.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nCuomo is running for mayor of New York City as an independent after losing the Democratic primary to Zohran Mamdani by more than 12 percentage points.\nFox News Digital's Jessica Chasmar as well as The Associated Press contributed to this report."

      "text": "The White House has remained silent after a new report claims advisors to President Donald Trump have discussed offering New York City Mayor Eric Adams a position within the Trump administration in the hopes it would hurt mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani\u2019s election odds.\nTrump advisors reportedly had a discussion with Adams\u2019 associates about dipping out of the race and potentially joining the Trump administration to pave the way for former Gov. Andrew Cuomo to secure a victory in November\u2019s election, the New York Times reported Wednesday.\nIt remains unclear if specific positions for Adams have been talked about or if Adams would be inclined to accept such an offer, the report said.\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.\nSANDERS ENDORSES SOCIALIST MAMDANI IN MOVE TO BLOCK CUOMO IN NYC MAYORAL RACE\nMamdani is a Ugandan-born Muslim and Democratic socialist who won the Democratic Party\u2019s primary for New York City mayor in June. Meanwhile, Cuomo is a moderate Democrat running in the race as an independent after losing to Mamdani in the Democratic primary race in June.\nAdams\u2019 campaign said the mayor has not had discussions with Trump on the matter.\n\"Mayor Adams has made it clear that he will not respond to every rumor that comes up,\" Todd Shapiro, a spokesperson for Adams\u2019 campaign, said Wednesday. \"He will remain focused, not be distracted and grind for New Yorkers.\"\nWASHINGTON POST BASHES SOCIALIST ZOHRAN MAMDANI AS POTENTIAL DISASTER FOR NEW YORK CITY\n\"He has had no discussions with, nor has he met with, President Donald Trump regarding the mayoral race,\" Shapiro said. \"The mayor is fully committed to winning this election, with millions of New Yorkers preparing to cast their votes. His record is clear: Crime is down, jobs are up and he has consistently stood up for working families. Mayor Adams is focused on building on that progress and earning four more years to continue delivering for the people of New York.\"\nTrump historically has railed against Mamdani and has cautioned New Yorkers against voting for the New York State assemblyman from Queens.\n\"No. 1, you have a communist running, and you shouldn't vote for him,\" Trump said during a July Cabinet meeting. \"He's a disaster. He's leading. He's got the Democrat nomination because that shows you where the Democrats have gone.\n\"I'm not getting involved, but I can tell you this: I used to say we will not ever be a socialist country. Right. Well, I'll say it again. We're not going to have \u2014 if a communist gets elected to run New York, it can never be the same.\"\n\u2018GLOBALIZE THE INTIFADA\u2019 PHRASE STIRS TENSIONS ON NYC CAMPAIGN TRAIL AS MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT RAGES"

      "text": "Key facts about President Donald Trump: What to know\nDonald Trump served as the 45th President of the United States and was re-elected in 2024 to become the 47th President. He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump. Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022. Trump married Marla Maples in 1993, and they have one daughter, Tiffany Trump.\nDonald Trump Jr., the eldest child of President Trump, has five children: Kai Trump, Donald J. Trump III, Tristan Trump, Spencer Trump, and Chloe Trump. Eric Trump is married to Lara Trump, who currently hosts FOX News Channel's \"My View with Lara Trump.\" Eric and Lara have two children, Eric Luke Trump and Carolina Trump. Ivanka Trump is married to Jared Kushner, and they have three children: Arabella Kushner, Joseph Kushner, and Theodore Kushner. Tiffany Trump welcomed her first child, Alexander Boulos, in 2025 with her husband, Michael Boulos."

      "text": "Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Eric Adams took aim at each other in separate interviews, as each tries to position himself as the right choice for those who do not want their far-left opponent Zohran Mamdani to be the city's next mayor.\nDuring a Saturday breakfast event in the Hamptons hosted by businessman and conservative radio host John Catsimatidis, Cuomo took a veiled shot at Adams by arguing that New York City hasn't had a \"competent\" mayor since Michael Bloomberg left office in 2013, the New York Post reported.\nCuomo \u2013 who, like Adams, is running as an independent against Democratic nominee Mamdani and Republican Curtis Sliwa \u2013 added that the city currently \"feels out of control.\"\nAdams, meanwhile, was not shy about criticizing Cuomo while making his own case as the choice for moderates and conservatives who do not want the democratic socialist Mamdani.\n\"Andrew Cuomo is running from his record. Bail reform. I had to fix that. Cannabis Law. I had to fix that. Raise the Age [which ended automatically prosecuting 16- and 17-year-olds as adults]. I had to fix that,\" Adams said in a Thursday interview with the Post.\n\"You look at my record, and then you compare it to his record. I had to fix his mess. He created a mess for our city, and I got to fix it,\" the mayor added.\nBoth men also took their fair share of shots at Mamdani, as well.\nCuomo warned that he would \"move to Florida\" if Mamdani is elected, although his campaign insisted to Fox News Digital that the comment was a joke, and audio from the event evidences that attendees laughed at the statement.\n\"It was a joke, and people in the room understood that and laughed. Governor Cuomo would never give up on New York. That said, the line underscored the stakes in the upcoming election and the risk of electing a dangerously inexperienced hate-spewing 33-year-old socialist whose campaign consists of unrealistic bumper sticker slogans,\" campaign spokesman Rich Azzopardi told Fox in a statement.\n\"Look at [Mandani\u2019s] policies: once you empty out Rikers Island, that\u2019s a major impact,\" Adams told The New York Post, referencing Mamdani's plan to reduce the prison's population. \"It\u2019s going to go back to the communities that crime came from.\"\nAdams, a former police officer, went on to criticize Mamdani's plan to have social workers respond to domestic violence calls rather than police.\nAdams referenced NYPD Officer Wilbert Mora, 27, and his partner Jason Rivera, 22, who were shot and killed responding to a domestic violence call in 2022.\n\"Mora and Rivera, the two cops who were shot in the beginning of my [mayoral] career, they died and were assassinated responding to a domestic violence call,\" Adams said.\nFox News Digital reached out to Adams and the Mamdani campaign for comment, but they did not immediately respond.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nMamdani secured the Democratic nomination last month, leaving voters who are not among the far left to choose between two Democrats-turned-independents in Adams and Cuomo, and the Republican Sliwa."

      "text": "Zohran Mamdani: What to know about the Democrat\nZohran Mamdani, a socialist candidate in the New York City mayoral race, holds dual U.S. and Ugandan citizenship. Born in Uganda and raised in South Africa, Mamdani moved to New York City at age 7. A Muslim, he transitioned from making rap music to pursuing a career in politics and is married to Rama Duwaji.\nHis father, Mahmood Mamdani, is a Columbia University professor affiliated with an organization that supports boycotts of Israel. Zohran Mamdani co-founded Students for Justice in Palestine at Bowdoin College, where he wrote articles advocating for an academic boycott of Israel.\nDespite controversy surrounding his Columbia University application and SAT scores, Mamdani is running on a progressive platform that includes a citywide rent freeze, taxpayer-funded childcare and \u201cfast and free\u201d public buses. He also pledges to address gun violence, hate crimes and homelessness.\nAs part of his housing policy, Mamdani proposes allowing the city to take control of properties from negligent landlords. His broader economic agenda includes raising the minimum wage to $30 an hour by 2030, redirecting tax funds to open city-owned grocery stores and expanding hate violence prevention funding by 800%. His campaign aims to build a more equitable New York City."
