      "feedback": "Overall, the draft shows a solid three‑regime macro frame and credible cross‑asset transmission (macro/policy/flows/valuation) with concrete Ford/S&P anchors and a concise watchlist, but it needs a sharper, testable causal chain, tighter adherence to SECTION FOCUS, stronger first‑principles grounding, explicit scenario structure, and fully quantified, source‑backed inputs; the narrative often reads as multi‑source summary rather than an integrated model, and several assertions lack direct, trackable linkage to the regime states or to the Ford/S&P mechanics. Actionable edits: (1) state and defend a tight base thesis with explicit horizon (e.g., inflation normalizes with policy easing in H2 2025) and two alternative regimes, tagging each claim with the exact source IDs; (2) build a formal causal chain: regime signal → policy/discount rate → financial conditions → sector/stock dynamics (Ford EV margin risk, S&P multiple) with first‑principles grounding on how inflation persistence and wage growth shape discount rates and risk premia; (3) quantify impacts using the numbers in sources: Ford metrics (EV losses ≈ $1.3B; adj. EBIT ≈ 4.3%; ROIC ≈ 10%; dividend ≈ 5%; forward P/E ≈ 10x); ACMR anchors (2025 revenue ≈ $900m; gross margin ≈ 4%); oil regimes (Regime A ≈ 50% with Brent mid‑60s; Regime B ≈ 30%); core CPI/moM paths (0.30%–0.40%); RWA ~16T by 2030; crypto paths Ether 4k–5k, BTC 110k–125k; and present a calibrated sensitivity matrix showing how a regime shift would plausibly move S&P multiple and Ford margins without inventing new numbers; (4) re‑structure into a formal scenario framework: Base Case, Regime B (persistent inflation/high discount rates), Regime C (growth slowdown/defensives) with explicit triggers and a falsification/invalidation rule tied to Jackson Hole signals, semiconductor capex cadence, oil surprises, or crypto/tokenization flows; (5) flesh out the watchlist with decisive signals and thresholds drawn from the sources, e.g., Jackson Hole policy tone shifts, cadence of semicaps, notable oil supply/demand surprises, crypto/tokenization inflows, and RWA growth milestones, each linked to a probability or impact bracket; (6) reconcile conflicts by selecting a single, probability‑weighted regime path for the base case and clearly stating ranges when sources diverge, rather than presenting parallel, non‑integrated numbers; (7) tighten citation discipline so every substantive claim (macro regime, policy, oil, inflation path, RWA, crypto, Ford/S&P implications) carries a matching source ID and note any minor deviations or conflicts between IDs; (8) improve readability and cohesion by eliminating repetitive regime phrasing, exporting the cross‑asset links into a concise, linear flow from regime state to market outcome, and adding a one‑line verdict at the end; (9) ensure full SECTION FOCUS alignment by foregrounding the cross‑topic drivers, their directional signals, and a compact, decisive‑signals watchlist rather than a scattered synthesis; and (10) validate that every asserted mechanism has a traceable path through the cited sources and avoid any unsupported leaps between, say, crypto dynamics and Ford margin trajectories. If these edits are applied, the analysis will deliver a world‑class synthesis: a transparent, source‑backed, first‑principles grounded regime framework with quantified sensitivities, a rigorous scenario structure, and a crisp watchlist of decisive upcoming signals anchored to the IDs in SOURCE MATERIAL.",
