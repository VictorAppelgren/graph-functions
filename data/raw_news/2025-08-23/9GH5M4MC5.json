  "title": "Is Lenovo's new SteamOS handheld worth the hype? I tested it, here's my verdict",
  "description": "Lenovo's latest gaming handheld foregoes Windows 11 for Steam's gaming-centric OS. It's a strong start, but I have a few concerns.",
  "content": "Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\n\nNo, you're not seeing double. This is the second review I've done for Lenovo's Legion Go S. However, this one is special because it doesn't run Windows 11 -- it runs SteamOS. That single change in the operating system elevates the Legion Go S from a \"just okay\" gaming handheld to a great one -- rivaling the Steam Deck itself.\n\nBefore I break down the handheld, I should explain Steam OS to those who don't know, as the software is at the center of what makes this new model so good.\n\nAlso: Sony's newest headphones are for WH-1000XM6 fans who love to game - and I can attest to that\n\nSteamOS is a lightweight operating system originally exclusive to the Steam Deck. It delivers a user-friendly interface that isn't bloated with unwanted apps, and more importantly, it's designed specifically for gaming.\n\nIt's this streamlined OS is a big reason why the Steam Deck has been so popular -- it's no fuss, no muss. Back in January, Valve (the developer of Steam) announced it would begin licensing the operating system to third-party companies, with Lenovo being the first (and at the time of this writing, only) partner.\n\nDesign-wise, it's identical to the earlier model with the only discernable difference being the color. It is now in Nebula purple instead of Glacier White. The device itself is just as comfortable in my hands and doesn't feel bulky. Textured grips on the side stop slipping, hall-effect analog sticks maintain accuracy and prevent drifting, and the switches on the back affect the travel distance for the rear triggers.\n\nAlso: Why I still recommend this 2024 Dell laptop for work and productivity - even though it's for gamers\n\nHowever, the touchpad under the right analog stick has lost its purpose. In the previous model, it was used to control the cursor for various purposes, like navigating a web browser. But, this device doesn't support any browser or apps for that matter -- it's just Steam.\n\nThe touchpad can be used in games as another button or to help aim weapons, although performing the latter doesn't feel great. It's so small that it's difficult to get precise movements. Most of the time, I ended up aiming my character in a completely different direction when I meant to shoot the enemy in front of me.\n\nGaming on the go\n\nYour gaming experience on the Legion Go S depends on the titles you play. As cool as this handheld may be, it is still just a handheld, not some ultra-powerful desktop. Underneath the hood is an AMD Ryzen Z2 Go processor, an AMD Radeon GPU, and 16GB of RAM. This configuration is much happier tackling lightweight games like \"Hades\" or \"Stardew Valley\". Titles like those run at a consistently smooth 120Hz. It's like art.\n\nAAA games like Monster Hunter Wilds have a harder time running on the Legion Go S. Graphics are blurry, and performance slows down when there's a lot on screen. That sounds like a knock against the device, but the Steam Deck also struggles with the same. It's the nature of the tech, and the fact that it can even run these titles at all is commendable in its own right.\n\nLuckily, you can tweak the hardware's performance on the fly. Pressing the button at the upper right corner of the screen launches the settings menu. Then, just click the lightning bolt icon to open the Performance page where you can tweak the game's performance to best suit your needs.\n\nIf you don't want to spend half an hour adjusting the settings like I did, you can just activate a title's default profile. This feature is my absolute favorite. It automatically applies a game's performance profile according to what Steam has for it, taking all of the guesswork out.\n\nBattery life isn't great. While \"Monster Hunter\", the Legion Go S ran for about an hour and 15 minutes before I had to grab the charger. However, on lighter games like \"Hades 2\", that time went up to two hours.\n\nWith the release of the SteamOS Legion Go S, I consider the previous Windows model obsolete. This version is the only one you should care about, and it serves as a great alternative to the OLED Steam Deck. Now the question is, what should you get: the Legion Go S or the Steam Deck?\n\nIt's close, but I like the Legion Go S more because of its touchscreen. Lenovo's device has an 8-inch LCD that runs at a 120Hz refresh rate, while Valve's Steam Deck has a 7.4-inch OLED touchscreen that runs at 90Hz max. I value higher refresh rates because they ensure smoother animations and faster response times, which can mean the difference between winning and losing.\n\nOn the other hand, the Steam Deck's OLED screen does mean its color output is more impressive.\n\nAlso: How much RAM does your PC really need in 2025? I did the math for Windows and Mac users\n\nThere are other deciding factors to consider. The Steam Deck's OLED display delivers a more vibrant color palette, and Valve's device is lighter at 1.4 pounds, while the Legion Go S clocks in at 1.62 pounds. Also, the Steam Deck has significantly larger touchpads underneath the Deck's analog sticks, which make controlling first-person shooters easier.\n\nLenovo's Legion Go S is on sale for $600 at Best Buy right now, which is a competitive price. I had a blast with this product, and it's a device I would absolutely get for myself, especially on sale. However, if you value more vibrant colors and bigger trackpads, get the Steam Deck, which retails for $549.",

I'm pretty familiar with the Stealth line, having reviewed several models in the past. This version doesn't reinvent the wheel. In fact, it shares many similarities with its predecessor, the Stealth A16 AI+, to its benefit and to a fault.\nAlso: The best laptops for graphic designers: Expert tested\nFirst off: on the surface, I genuinely can't tell the difference between this model and the previous generation. The Stealth 16 measures 14\"x 10.22\"x 0.85\" inches -- the exact same dimensions as the A16. It even weighs the same at 4.63 pounds.\nWhat's funny is I used to think that was really heavy, but after carrying around chunky laptops, MSI's device feels lightweight. Even with the power adapter, I didn't mind carrying it around town. By the way, I factor that adapter into the overall weight because you will need it on hand. More on that later.\nBringing back the classics\nA few other great design elements make their triumphant return. Going down the list, you have a full-size gaming keyboard. Each button has a 1.5mm travel distance, ensuring a comfortable typing feel. Six surround sound speakers are located at either end below the keyboard for immersive audio.\nOne of my favorite moments testing this laptop came from listening to \"Doomsday\" by MF Doom. The lyrical flow from Doom sounded crystal clear and powerful through the laptop's speakers, filling my entire room with his supervillainy.\nAbove the keyboard is the 16-inch OLED display. At QuadHD+ (2,560 x 1,600 pixels) resolution, it's not quite 4K, but it's close enough -- the screen still delivers impressive visual output. Colors are vibrant, the high resolution delivers detailed images, and the 240Hz refresh rate ensures smooth on-screen motion.\nPower boost\nOne of my favorite things about MSI laptops is how easy it is to tweak their performance. On many Windows 11 laptops, all you can really do is change the Power mode in the Settings, but MSI Center, its internal settings program is actually pretty robust. Here, you can adjust the computer's output on the fly. For example, enabling Extreme Performance and Discrete Graphics Mode delivers the best hardware results.\nAlso: I tested Dell's XPS successor, and it beat my $3,000 Windows laptop in almost every way\nInside my review unit was an Intel Core Ultra 9 285H, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 graphics card, and 32GB of RAM. It's a pretty good configuration, if I say so myself, and it shows in the performance numbers.\nBelow is a list comparing MSI's Stealth 16 with its predecessor, the Stealth A16 AI Plus, and the Dell Premium 16. You'll notice that the newer model has better raw processing and rendering power than the others, indicating it excels at handling heavy workloads and rendering complex 3D graphics.\nThere is a bit of a gap between the Stealth 16 and the A16 on PCMark 10, suggesting that the older model has better general performance; it's able to hop between web pages and apps without much issue. However, I didn't experience any slowdown. This laptop ran great everywhere.\nPCMark 10 | Geekbench 6 | Cinebench 2024 | Cinebench R23 | |\nMSI Stealth 16 AI | 7,693 | 15,883 | 1,129 | 21,656 |\nMSI Stealth A16 AI+ | 7,913 | 14,196 | N/A | 18,336 |\nDell Premium 16 | 6,865 | 14,763 | 726 | 17,522 |\nHaving Dell's machine may seem random, but you need to understand that the Stealth 16 isn't just a solid gaming computer. It's also a powerful graphic design laptop, too. For testing, I installed Blender, a free 3D creation app, and edited images on Pixlr. I'm not much of an artist, but I did manage to create and render simple scenes starring Blender's complex monkey model.\nI had a similar experience with Pixlr, as I was able to edit 4K photographs without any major hiccups. The entire process went smoothly. MSI's laptop is a powerhouse in almost every sense of the word.\nAlso: I switched to the Dell 14 Premium for a week, and it makes even the XPS feel outdated\nAs powerful as the laptop may be, it has its limits. I ran multiple 4K YouTube livestreams as part of my usual 50-tab Chrome browser test. Everything ran fine when there were only three livestreams, although once I hit six, I noticed a slowdown. Livestreams were slow to load. It took a few seconds before the Stealth 16 could play the video as normal.\nStaying cool\nHeavy workloads do cause the Stealth 16 to heat up a bit, but high temperatures were never an issue. Heat vents are strategically placed above the keyboard, on the side of the laptop, and on the bottom, so your hands are never at risk of touching a hot keyboard. In fact, the keys stayed nice and cool the entire time. Unfortunately, this means you can't place the computer on your lap; otherwise, your legs will be blasted by hot air.\nThis ability to stay cool under duress is thanks to the Cooler Boost 5 cooling system, which consists of two large fans and five heat pipes directing hot air out through the vents. This system is also on the vastly more powerful MSI Raider 18 HX.\nUnsurprisingly, MSI's Stealth 16 is not designed to be away from its charger for long. You can push its endurance by enabling ECO-Silent and Integrated Graphics Mode in the MSI Center app, and Best Power Efficiency in Windows, but even then, it will last around six hours on a single charge, depending on what you're doing.\nLike many gaming laptops with this kind of hardware, it may have power, but it lacks in stamina. For that reason, I'd suggest this for users who don't need an all-day battery kind of laptop, but are fine with a few hour stints throughout the day.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe MSI Stealth 16 AI is on sale at Best Buy for $2,030, which is a good price for a laptop with this kind of hardware. I recommend this device to anyone looking for an affordable gaming laptop that can also be used as a work machine. If you like this laptop but want to save some cash, its predecessor, the Stealth A16 AI+, is very similar and still relevant in 2025, retailing for $1,800.\nIf you want a more powerful graphic design computer, I suggest the Alienware 18 Area-51. It is a much more powerful gaming laptop that leaves every laptop I mentioned so far in the dust. I think it's one of the best for the year. It is, however, very expensive; my review unit cost $3,200."

Sony engineers worked with e-sports organization Fnatic to develop the H9 II, resulting in a handful of quality-of-life features that gamers will appreciate. This includes button placement, fit, and my personal favorite feature -- the detachable mic.\nAlso: Upgrading your headphones? 5 things I recommend doing with your current pair first\nThe H9 II takes a precise approach to audio, with 360 spatial sound that communicates subtle effects like footsteps behind you and directional movement, for some pretty impressive immersion.\nThe 30mm drivers here are the same as Sony's WH-1000XM6 headphones, so you're getting rich audio as a baseline, with some EQ presets designed specifically for effects you'll encounter in FPSs, like footsteps, gunshots, and directional sound effects.\nNotably, however, they're smaller than the 40mm drivers in the H9, supporting Sony's goal here in allowing for clearer, more detailed sound. We're talking rustling leaves, gentle breezes, and of course, gunfire with precise locationality.\nEnvironment plays a big role in how well you can hear all of these things, of course. You can't exactly hear the footsteps of the player stalking behind you with barking dogs in the background. Luckily, the headphones' noise canceling works very well, reinforced by the gentle, but complete, seal offered by the earpads.\nNoise cancellation can be toggled with the button on the left between ambient, ANC on, or off. While on, it succeeds at blocking out your environment to dramatic effect.\nThere's other ways to play, though, as any gamer can attest to. Personally, I swap between gaming with ANC on, to swapping to ambient mode and keeping the game's audio to my external speakers. That way, I can relegate voice comms to the headset.\nLuckily, you don't need to do a whole lot of tinkering to get good performance out of these headphones. Their lightweight fit and balanced sound profile makes for solid performance straight out of the box, with additional EQ adjustments acting as a bonus.\nAlso: Why I keep 4 pairs of headphones with me at all times (and the unique role each one plays)\nI tried the H9 II in a variety of games, and found the headphones' spatial sound to be very nice. Sound effects that are far off are well telegraphed, with subtle directional effects that, as designed, are even more noticeable in quiet environments with less audio clutter.\nIn terms of comfort, lightweight is the key word here, as the whole headset weighs about 273 grams (0.6 pounds) with a comfortable fit that's both sealed off but comfortable enough to wear for extended sessions.\nThe adjustable headband on the H9 II is made with a braided cloth material that's exceedingly light yet sturdy. The engineering here is a massive improvement over the previous model's thick and clunky padded headband.\nThe headset connects via a USB-C dongle that utilizes a 2.4GHz connection and LE Audio and Bluetooth for multi-point connectivity, while all of the most common settings are accessible via physical buttons on the headphones. This includes the mic mute, ANC on or off, game/chat mode, and the Bluetooth pairing button.\nAlso: Stop and clean your earbuds or headphones ASAP - here's why audio experts encourage it\nThe mute button is especially handy, as it's a toggle switch that's extended when muted, and flush with the headphones when open. Located on the top of the left ear, it gives you one-handed access to quickly mute or speak. If you're ever unsure, there's a red LED at the tip that lights up when you're muted.\nThe power button is on the front of the right side -- a harder to reach spot designed to avoid the accidental tap, but the ANC/Bluetooth buttons are easily mixed up. Looking at the headset for labels may or may not be of help, as the print above the buttons (on the headset with the black colorway) is so tiny and so dark, I had to put my iPhone's flashlight on it to see.\nThis leads me to my other complaint about the headset: the black matte texture is an absolute fingerprint magnet. I've been using these headphones for a week, and they look like I've had them for far longer than that. Granted, wiping them down with a cloth solves this problem, but I definitely would have opted for a different color or finish.\nThe H9 II is also quite good as an all-around pair of headphones away from the console. With the detachable mic, they become regular headphones with sound quality you'd expect from a mid- to upper-tier pair of headphones. In fact, they're louder than my everyday carry pair of JBLs and actually feel great at the gym (yes, I went running with them, and they felt great).\nAlso: I wore the best headphones from Sony, Bose, Apple, and Sonos: Here's how the AirPods Max wins\nThe headset's support for multi-point connectivity is a nice plus that allows for connection with multiple devices at the same time. This means when you're deep in the game, you can still hear incoming calls or texts through the headset, preventing important missed calls because you were too busy exploding spaceships.\nTaking calls with the headset is also a surprisingly good user experience. The sound quality is good, and callers said my voice came through loud and clear.\nSo, let's talk battery life. Sony advertises an average of 30 hours of battery life, which is actually less than the 32 average on the H9 but still good for a gaming headset. During my testing, I found that you'll get quite a bit less than this if you use the ANC.\nAlso: The best headphones and earbuds of 2025\nThat being said, the headset charges fast. Sony says that five minutes of charge time will give you up to three hours of use, which equates to roughly 30% battery in less than 10 minutes. Once you're around 20% juice, the headphones will notify you with a \"Battery low\" notification.\nLuckily, the USB-C to USB-A cord that comes with the headphones is extra long, so if you do need to plug in during a gaming session, it's hardly an issue.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe Sony InZone H9 II are a great pair of gaming headphones, and I'd recommend them to anyone who appreciates refined, precise audio effects just as much as booming explosions and gunfire. The 360-degree spatial sound is very immersive, especially for FPS games, and the directional effects really do come alive.\nHowever, the headphones' lightweight form and propensity to be a fingerprint magnet don't do much to exude a \"premium\" aesthetic. Luckily, the white colorway eliminates this problem, but then, white tech is its own challenge in longevity. These are gaming headphones, after all, but for the retail price of $349, these details matter.\nAll in all, the audio wins out, especially since you can detach the mic and have a banger pair of headphones for everyday use."

If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\nI replaced my Samsung OLED TV with this Sony Mini LED model for a week - and didn't regret it\nSony Bravia 5 TV (98-inch)\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- Enhanced color, contrast, and clarity make this TV live up to its hype.\n- It handily delivers upscaled HDR content and high-speed footage.\n- A soundbar will complement its size, and its off-angle viewing can be less than perfect.\nSony recently sent us the 2025 Bravia 5 TV, this one with a 98-inch screen and weighing in at 158 pounds. It goes without saying that this TV is a beast -- an expensive one. And the Bravia 5 is not even considered the company's flagship model (you can look to the Bravia 8 II and Bravia 9 for that). But this TV is impressive, and after testing it for a week, I'll explain why.\nAlso: You should turn off this default TV setting ASAP - and why even experts recommend it\nThe Bravia 5 is a Google TV, so setting up the UI was fairly easy using the remote and the Google Home app on my phone. But be prepared for a series of screens requiring you to check boxes for privacy disclaimers. The era of streaming content has become very complicated.\nOtherwise, the interface is intuitive, offering quick access to a vast selection of streaming services, apps, and voice control capabilities via Google Assistant. The personalization features are also a plus for helping you discover new content.\nThis behemoth of a display comes with a relatively small remote control. It's slender and lightweight, and if you have fat fingers like me, you might accidentally press enter when you meant to press a navigation button.\nAlso: Your TV's USB port has an underrated feature that can revitalize an old system for free\nI appreciate the downsizing of remotes across most brands these days. Yet despite all the streamlining, Sony (and most others) insist on including dedicated app buttons. You know, for Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, and whatever other platforms the manufacturer contracts with. These buttons take up a lot of real estate and make the remote seem almost \"disposable\" because brands get bought, sold, and sometimes change names.\nFor example, I have a Roku TV with a Vudu button. Who or what is Vudu? That platform still exists, but it's now known as Fandango Media (a joint venture between NBC Universal and Warner Bros.).\nI don't mean to make an example of Sony; its engineers are simply abiding by the current trend. Yet, I haven't met anyone who says they use these dedicated app buttons. When you have a smartly designed home screen, you don't need them.\nThat is one of my two peevish critiques of the Sony Bravia 5. Second is the fact that this remote is not backlit. Come on, Sony. If I'm buying a $6,000 TV, I envision a home cinema experience in the dark (just like in a movie theatre). This means I don't want to turn on my phone to aim a light source at the \"magic wand\" just so I can pause the thing when my DoorDash order arrives. To me, backlighting on remotes seems like a simple ask for anything above a budget model television.\nApologies for my digressionary rant on remote control design. Despite these minor gripes, it became clear to me that the Bravia 5 has plenty to shout about.\nAlso: The next big HDMI leap has arrived - how the 2.2 standard is shaking things up\nFor one thing, Sony's prowess in display technology is impressive. Its proprietary Cognitive Processor XR upscales images beautifully, ensuring motion is slippery smooth with minimal blur. From fast-paced action scenes in the 2023 Mission: Impossible rendition to 2025 NBA highlights, the Bravia 5 delivered 4K resolution with exceptional clarity, vibrant colors, and impressive contrast. HDR content truly pops, showcasing deep blacks and brilliant highlights.\nWhile 4K content looks phenomenal, lower-resolution content (like older cable broadcasts) tends to reveal imperfections more noticeably on such a large screen, even with the XR processor's excellent upscaling.\nThe Sony Bravia 5 can display up to a 120Hz refresh rate with VRR and ALLM enabled, which means the TV dynamically adjusts to match the frame rate of the content being displayed. This is especially good news for gamers. With those kinds of specs, playing Fortnite on a display of this size is an electrifying experience. The Bravia 5 showed no sign of screen tearing, with exquisitely responsive gameplay.\nAlso: The best Sony TVs of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\nAlready impressed by the images on this behemoth TV, I ran a few tests at the lab for dirty screen effect, burn-in, and blooming. I clocked no degradation, even close to the edges. The color test was consistent; the subtitle test yielded no visible blooming, and the scrolling text motion was liquid.\nHaving said that, viewing the Bravia 5 from side angles was not the best. It's fair to assume that, with the same build and technology in a smaller Bravia 5, this would also be the case. With a 98-inch screen, though, you probably won't get many complaints from someone sitting on the far edge of your couch. And while Sony TVs generally handle reflections well, a screen this large can still be susceptible to glare in brightly lit rooms, so strategic placement and light control are important factors. (You might consider getting some blackout curtains.)\nAlso: I changed 12 settings on my Apple TV to instantly improve the performance\nThis Mini LED TV bears a peak brightness of around 800 nits. That isn't eye-popping OLED-level brightness, but in a dark room, you might want to lower the brightness on a Bravia 5 to prevent eye strain. Trust me, the TV is plenty bright, and it can accommodate seating from any conceivable home theater.\nWhat about sound? The Sony Bravia 5 uses Sony's Acoustic Multi-Audio system, and it's worth some praise. It combines two down-firing X-Balanced speakers for bass and midrange with a pair of Sound Positioning tweeters on the top corners of the back panel to handle mids and highs. The result is a well-balanced listening experience, with clear dialogue and vocals complemented by ambient effects that fill the space nicely.\nFor the ultimate audio experience, though, the Sony Bravia 5 could use a companion soundbar to round things out. Again, if you're investing this much in a giant screen, then your budget might not be too far stretched to install a comprehensive surround sound system as well.\nAlso: This is the soundbar I recommend for deeply immersive audio - and now it's $300 off\nThe Bravia 5 has an impressive array of connectivity options, including Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 on the wireless side, and several physical ports. I really like how Sony included an infographic panel (of sorts) right next to each port to make it clear which cables go where. It comes with four HDMI ports -- one of them eARC (for that soundbar you should buy), another being 4K at 120Hz (for your online gaming needs).\nBest test deals of the week\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe 98-inch Sony Bravia 5 is a formidable piece of home entertainment technology. Its stunning picture quality, immersive scale, and excellent smart features make it a dream display for any cinephile or gaming enthusiast.\nGrand proportions notwithstanding, Sony's quality will shine through on any smaller-sized Bravia 5 screen. This one runs for about $5,999, whereas you can get an 85-inch Bravia 5 for less than half that price or a 75-inch for one-third the cost.\nEven if it's not about the money, not every home can accommodate a colossal 98-inch panel. So, if your home's parameters aren't suitable for something this big, you'll arguably be getting a better value by downsizing a step or two on screen size.\nIf you have the budget and space, the Bravia 5 delivers on its promise of a magnificent viewing experience. And if you're seeking the ultimate home cinema experience, pair this TV with a high-end soundbar to match the visual grandeur with equally powerful and nuanced audio.\nHow we test TVs\nWhile testing and researching the TVs featured on this list, I and other ZDNET experts kept these criteria in mind:\n- Price: Not all budgets are created equal. And if you're working with a limited budget, that shouldn't mean you have to settle for a sub-par TV.\n- Screen size: The most important factor to consider, after price, when shopping for a new TV is whether or not it will fit into your space.\n- Picture and audio quality: A new TV doesn't mean much, even if it costs an arm and a leg, if it doesn't provide a great picture and clear audio. The best TVs we test have often been ensured to support various HDR codecs, including HDR10+ and Dolby Vision, as well as enhanced audio software like Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital Plus, and object-tracking sound.\nFor a more detailed look, check out our extensive TV testing methodology."

I did the math for Windows and Mac users\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- RAM is an important hardware resource that allows a computer to perform optimally and at fast speeds.\n- Escalating computing demands have made 16GB of RAM the new standard for PCs and laptops if they are to continue performing at their best.\n- Even then, 16GB of memory may not be enough for certain users, so it's important know when to upgrade.\nGet more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\nI used to struggle when shopping for a new computer. Over time, I learned to narrow things down to what I call the \"performance trifecta\" -- three main components you should be mindful of when buying a laptop or desktop: processor, storage drive, and RAM. The first two are pretty easy to figure out. A good processor ensures that a computer performs well, and a lot of local storage means you'll have plenty of room for all your files.\nAlso: One of the best work laptops I've tested has MacBook written all over it (but it's even better)\nMemory is a component I don't think many people fully understand or pay attention to (I was certainly a part of this group). RAM, or random access memory, is essentially a computer's short-term memory. Instead of saving data directly onto an SSD, the computer stores files temporarily in the RAM for quick access. That way, the device won't need to use its storage to open a document or software resources, ensuring fast performance.\nThere's a lot of information and differing opinions regarding RAM and how much you need on your computer. Should you opt for the laptop with the 32GB LPDDR5X RAM, or will 16GB be enough? I'm here to cut through all the fog and provide easy-to-understand advice on the amount of memory you should get.\nHow much RAM do you need in 2025?\nThe short answer: it depends on the operating system. For Windows machines, 16GB of RAM has become the operational minimum on new consumer laptops. Modern workloads have ramped up to such a degree that less RAM on a Windows device is fine, but it will limit you to everyday tasks like writing emails, internet browsing or watching YouTube videos.\nBut let's be real here: the average worker is probably running dozens of tabs in their browser, a handful of apps in the background, and (possibly) generative AI, all of which demand memory power. In that sense, most people using their Windows laptops for work will want at least 16GB (for a value-driven, future-proof option) for a smooth user experience.\nAlso: Why I highly recommend the M4 MacBook Air to most people (and now it's on sale)\nWhen it comes to MacBooks, things are a little bit different. Because Apple's machines are so optimized to handle daily workflows, 8GB of RAM goes a bit further than a stock laptop running Windows. In fact, it wasn't until only recently that Apple made 16GB the starting point with the new MacBook Air M4.\nMacBooks with 8GB are still solid machines for daily use, while more powerful models like the MacBook Pro and MacBook Pro Max offer substantial power with 24GB, 36GB, or more, making them some of the most powerful laptops on the market (and some of the priciest).\nBesides just Windows and Macs, Chromebooks are a third category of consumer laptops that have seen a spike in popularity over the last few years due to their average lower price and lightweight operating system: ChromeOS.\nBecause ChromeOS is so streamlined, Chomebooks can get along just fine with 8GB or even less, making them great machines for handling the basics like working out of the browser and having your Google Suite at your fingertips with snappy performance and a low price. The trade-off, however, is that you'll have less access to apps you'd otherwise find on Windows.\nAlso: Is a refurbished MacBook viable in 2025? I did the math, and here's my expert advice\nAll in all, it's true to say that the more memory you have, the better your computer should perform. But having too much RAM can also be a poor return on investment because you end up spending money on a resource that you hardly ever use to its fullest extent. It's like owning a big house but only using a few of the rooms.\nWhen buying a new laptop, I just recommend having a clear understanding of what you want to use it for -- that way you can make a realistic expectation about how much RAM you need.\nWhat does DDR5 mean?\nSometimes, when shopping for a computer, you'll see the letters \"DDR\" followed by a number. This is an acronym that stands for \"double data rate.\" Without getting too deep into the weeds, DDR is a type of technology that improves the data transfer speed from RAM to other components, such as the processor. There have been five main DDR generations so far, with the latest and fastest standard being DDR5.\nAlso: I found the 5 best laptop sales - just in time for back to school\nSimilar to 16GB of memory, DDR technology has effectively become the new standard for RAM as users demand faster speeds. There are also variations of the technology. A notable version is LPDDR5X, which stands for low-power double data rate 5X, a more energy-efficient version of DDR5 designed specifically for mobile devices.\nDon't expect DDR6 RAM to be released for a computer near you anytime soon. We saw the JEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council) announce the release of LPDDR6 back in early July. The JEDEC is the organization that established DDR as a standard for computers. The technology is available for manufacturers to implement in their devices, but whether or not it'll happen -- or how soon -- is yet to be seen.\nWant more laptop advice? Add ZDNET as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\nWhen should you upgrade?\n16GB is fine for most cases, although if you're a gamer or creative professional, you should consider opting for 32GB of RAM. More RAM will ensure that the games you play and the video-editing apps you use for work operate more smoothly. I have that amount for my personal computer, and I'm very happy with that setup because I don't just write.\nI also play games on my desktop, edit photographs and videos, and run virtual machines, among other things. It's a heavy workload that requires the correct amount of resources to operate; even then, I am considering upgrading my PC to have more. It's not uncommon for me to see my workload take up over 70% of my computer's total RAM.\nAlso: The best mini PCs you can buy\nI consider anything above 32GB of memory excessive unless you're a specific type of user. If you're editing 8K videos or running heavy apps simultaneously, then you'll probably need 48GB or 64GB of RAM. A good laptop that can deliver would be something like the M4 MacBook Pro or the Dell Premium 16. These are solid, top-of-the-line machines capable of tackling tough workloads.\nWhy should you trust me?\nI've been writing about both software and consumer electronics for almost 10 years now, and in that time, I've worked in many different settings, from the traditional office to the home office, and even someone's backyard. The remote experience has made me extremely selective about what I choose to make my main computer, as I want to ensure the devices I use can handle my day-to-day tasks. I'm on my computer all day, practically every day of the week.\nAlso: I tested several AIO computers in 2025, and these are the best for your office setup\nI'm also at a point where I've tried just about every type of laptop on the market. I know which features and specs you should look out for when purchasing a new computer -- and which ones are not worth your time.\nThe advice I have given is not a set of hard and fast rules. I just aim to provide a foundation of what you should look for in a laptop. What is best for you depends on your unique needs."

TCL's Nxtpaper technology offers a paper-like screen that's made for tired eyes like mine. The TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G is the company's affordable attempt at relieving some of the stress that comes from modern smartphone screens.\nAlso: Changing this Android setting instantly doubled my phone speed (Samsung and Google models included)\nIt's a unique trick for a very inexpensive smartphone that needs to be seen to be understood. While far from perfect, and definitely a device built to a price, it brings a differentiator that will matter for some users looking to give their eyes a rest while they scroll or read.\nA unique multi-faceted display\nThe display is what immediately sets the 60XE apart. TCL's Nxtpaper 3.0 matte coating gives the glass an undeniably unique finish that I quite like. On-screen content looks a bit like E-ink depending on the mode the phone is in, but underneath that hazy layer is a standard 1080p, 120Hz LCD panel.\nThe coating addresses a slew of common downsides of modern displays. It reduces blue light, cuts reflections to nearly nothing, and even eliminates most fingerprints. There's also a nice texture that feels a bit like paper, which is a nice departure from a sea of glossy, reflective displays.\nBeneath the power and volume buttons is a physical Nxtpaper Key, a plastic switch that feels a bit cheaper than I'd like. Flipping the switch offers up a menu of distinct modes that change how the display operates.\nTCL clearly wants users to notice and appreciate this feature because every toggle results in a five-second full-screen animation complete with an obnoxious serenade. I made sure to set my volume to mute so I could avoid the theatrical effect.\nEach mode provides its own twist on usability and comfort. Color Paper Mode, my favorite, mutes the colors while retaining a standard Android interface that's easier on the eyes for all-day use. I even enjoyed watching YouTube videos in this mode, though everything feels a bit flatter than my eyes are used to.\nInk Paper Mode goes one step further, stripping color from icons and text for a no-frills grayscale approach, while still delivering the full unencumbered Android experience. Max Ink Mode is the most dramatic change, stripping all color while also limiting apps to a small subset of essentials and suspending certain background processes.\nAlso: iOS 26 envy? 5 iPhone features you can already use on your Android (Samsung included)\nThe result is an ultra-minimal, battery-saving mode that can last more than a week on a single charge. I enjoyed this mode for reading ebooks and could see it as a great solution for users looking to cut back on smartphone use entirely.\nThe display does come with a major caveat. On the brightest days, the matte finish would all but wash out on-screen content, often making it unusable in direct sunlight. If you spend time outside reading or working, you'll be looking for shade like I was.\nPerformance and battery\nPerformance is modest but serviceable, with a MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ processor inside paired with 8GB of RAM. In use, this is not a phone for hardcore users who push their devices to the limit. I noticed many actions have a slight delay attached to them. Launching the camera often takes a few seconds to negotiate.\nGeneral tasks like web browsing, email, and messaging are responsive enough to keep me happy, but things never felt snappy.\nOn the software front, the 60 XE runs Android 15, with a promise from TCL of just one upgrade to Android 16 and two years of security patches. As someone who always decries the poor state of Android OS update promises, this is a weak point, and TCL needs to step up its game. Anyone hoping to get long-term value should consider other options.\nAlso: I spent a week in New York City with the Samsung Z Fold 7 - and it spoiled me the entire time\nI found battery life to be a highlight, which isn't that surprising given the 5,010mAh battery hidden inside. I routinely made it through the day with around 20-30% capacity to spare at bedtime. Wired charging tops out at a slow 18 watts, so quick daytime top-ups will take some time, but it's fine for plugging in overnight.\nFor the truly battery paranoid, there's the Max Ink Mode that considerably jumps battery life to more than a week if you are willing to cut down on much of what the phone is capable of.\nStay for the display, but not the camera\nThe plastic marble-like backplate surrounds a large circular camera array that's hard to miss and perhaps even more premium-looking than its price point. One pet peeve of mine is an off-center camera module, and this phone has a notable wobble when placed on a tabletop as a result.\nThe camera system itself is one area where the low-end cutbacks really show. The main sensor does its best outdoors in very bright conditions and needs a lot of light to help shots taken indoors. The camera performance is mediocre with soft output that lacks punch and definition most of the time.\nLow-light conditions easily demonstrate the camera system's baseline capability, and the ultrawide lens often results in grainy images. The 32MP front camera works, but that's about it. Let's just say that this is not the phone for the discerning camera buff.\nZDNET's buying advice\nWhat the TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G offers is a key standout feature: a unique matte display. At $250, the 60XE offers something that you really can't find anywhere else, in this price category and beyond, and the benefits of that might matter a lot for certain users. For everyone else, consider phones like the CMF Phone 2 Pro, which offers better imaging, better speed, and its signature modular design approach.\nFollow my latest tech reviews and projects across social media.

The electronics have improved, but the basic act of operating a digital camera has remained mostly the same. Cameras are a gaggle of buttons that are a cryptic arrangement to anyone but the initiated.\nThe real innovation in the picture-taking experience has been the smartphone, which has made picture-taking an always-available tool for documenting everything with relative ease.\nThere is still an audience, however, for innovation beyond what smartphones offer. Young consumers keep buying digital cameras, and a new generation is always interested to learn more about photography as an art.\nAlso: The best vlogging cameras of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\nInto the void steps lens and camera maker Sigma Corp., based in Kanagawa, Japan, just outside Tokyo. The company this spring introduced a radical redesign of the digital camera's basic mode of use.\nThe Sigma BF, as it's called, reduces the mass of buttons to a small set of touch-sensitive controls. All the functions of digital photography are still there to be experimented with and exploited -- shutter speed, lens aperture, or \"f-stop,\" and \"ISO,\" the level of light that can be recovered from a scene -- but they are under your command in a radically simplified user interface.\nI've been testing the BF for some weeks now, and I'm smitten with the changes. The hardware's design is beautiful, and the new user interface is very thoughtful. The name \"BF\" stands for \"beautiful foolishness,\" and you could say this kind of redesign is crazy, but I love it.\nA camera for a new age of photographers\nSigma, a sixty-three-year-old company, makes most of its money from lenses for all camera brands. As a result, its cameras have tended to be somewhat experimental, never selling in the same volume as Sony, Canon, or Nikon. That means that the company takes chances. Often, the results are wild and beautiful.\nThe BF is really meant for a new age of prosumers who want to up their game in photography. At a retail price of $2,199, the price is not insignificant, but it is on the low end for what you'd pay for a very good 35mm digital camera these days. Lenses, which have to be bought separately, run from about $600 for a fixed focal length \"prime\" lens to $1,300 or more for zoom lenses. The BF uses what's called an \"L-mount,\" which means you're not limited to Sigma's lenses; it's also compatible with lenses from Leica, Panasonic, Samyang, and Sirui.\nAlso: Eufy's latest security camera has AI-powered color night vision - and no monthly fees\nThe premise of stepping up your game from the smartphone camera is pretty simple, to my mind: You will never, ever, get as good a picture with any smartphone camera as you will with a camera that has a real lens. The lens is the key. The optics are just so superior to the optics on a smartphone.\nI tested the BF with a 50mm prime lens from Sigma, the same kind I already use for most of my photography.\nNo matter what you are photographing, there are immediate benefits to using a real camera versus a smartphone camera.\nOne benefit is the detail you get. Here's a picture of a butterfly landing on some vegetation in a vivarium. When cropping the image to see the butterfly up close, you'll get a level of detail that is clean rather than the murky detail you get even with a smartphone's optical zoom:\n(None of these photos have been edited. They are all straight out of the camera. In some cases, the file size has been compressed to accommodate the publishing system.)\nNot only detail but also control of the depth of field via the aperture dial on the lens provides control over the selective blurring of objects, the \"bokeh.\"\nSmartphones will give you fake bokeh that is generated in software rather than the actual bending of the light via the lens elements. Rarely will fake bokeh give you a really complex, thrilling effect where both foreground and background elements are selectively blurred, leading to a more sophisticated image, such as this cypress I snapped in New York's Central Park:\nAnd even when fake bokeh works, I don't think you'll achieve the almost holographic, floating beauty you get with a real lens while preserving all the detail of the foreground subject, as with this thistle:\nThe second advantage is that a real lens will give you more real proportions than a smartphone lens that has a lot of barrel distortion. Like a building architectural shot or this bank vault:\nYou can get a nice, crisp skyline shot at twilight as the light changes:\nA swing to simplicity\nWhere the BF departs from other cameras is in the simplicity of design and user interface.\nThe hardware is, very simply, a solid shell milled from a block of aluminum and then filled with electronics. It's a gorgeous manufactured object with a super solid feel. (Sigma cameras always feel super solid, but this is on a new level.)\nThe BF's body is one of the lightest full-frame mirrorless cameras on the market, at just under a pound, compared to devices such as the Sony a7 IV, which weighs nearly a pound and a half.\nFor non-camera users, the weight of any real camera is something of a surprise compared to a smartphone such as an Apple iPhone Pro, which weighs half a pound. Holding 15 ounces worth of an unfamiliar object prompted some people to whom I handed the BF to remark, \"It's so heavy!\"\nAlso: First look at iPhone 17 Pro? Public images seemingly confirm big design and camera changes\nThe total weight of the camera is the combination of the 15 ounces and the 12 ounces of the 50mm Sigma lens. That kind of heft is typical of full-frame lenses because they have a lot of glass inside them. (And this particular Sigma lens is not very heavy as 50-millimeter lenses go.)\nThe real adjustment for a novice photographer is getting used to the balance of weight between camera and lens versus carrying a slab of a smartphone with uniform weight distribution.\nThe camera comes in two finishes, a striking silver color and a deep black. I chose to try the black as I like to use the camera often in discreet settings such as a jazz club, so I wanted something less flashy than the silver.\nThe sensor is a full-frame, 35mm Sony chip with just under 25 megapixels, less than the 60 megapixels in some 35mm cameras. Despite a lower pixel count, I found the sensor produced rich detail, certainly enough for Instagram pictures and possibly good enough for wall-sized prints depending on the exposure. Sony is a very reliable name for sensors, so it makes sense for Sigma to go with the market leader.\nImages are stored in the internal 230-gigabyte flash memory, which I found to be more than enough for my purposes. I usually offloaded the pictures onto my iPad or MacBook after each photo-taking session via USB-C and then cleared the BF's memory.\nAlso: Why the best fix for headless server frustration might be a little box named Comet\nOn the software side, the radical simplification of the user interface is striking -- it's even something of a revelation.\nI've been a user of Sigma cameras for over a decade, my main camera these days being the Sigma fp-L, a 60-megapixel model introduced a couple of years ago. I love that camera, but I would be very happy to see the changes in the BF user interface become standard on Sigma cameras going forward.\nThe main innovation is removing a lot of shooting information from the LCD screen. Instead of seeing the aperture or shutter speed and other settings constantly on the display, each setting on the BF occupies a separate, tiny LCD -- it's called a \"status monitor\" though I tend to think of it as simply a \"mini-LCD\" -- to the right of the main display.\nA click wheel just below the mini-LCD, formally called the \"dial pad,\" reminiscent of the first Apple iPod's click wheel, lets you rotate through the values of shutter speed, etc. The changing values are displayed on the mini-LCD as you do so, and you click the center button of the click wheel to select the setting you want.\nThere's also a touch-sensitive playback button, so you can peek at what you just snapped with a soft touch, and a touch-sensitive menu button, which is a quick way to peek at the camera's settings. And a power button at the bottom of all this, of course.\nThe effect is that the main display screen is a pristine window into what you're capturing in the real world, while the mini-LCD and the click-wheel are your controls. It's a nice division that elegantly separates the gaze from the adjustments.\nThe main LCD is a 2.1 megapixel model and is terrifically responsive for things such as selecting the focus area by tapping with your finger, or using pinch and swipe when looking through the photos you've taken.\nAlso: Stanford's holographic AI glasses are coming for your clunky VR headset\nIf you half-press the shutter button, the display momentarily shows the key settings before you fully commit to the shutter release. If you press on the center button of the click-wheel, or dial pad, extra settings come up for the function that's in focus, such as shutter speed.\nStreet photography delight\nThe BF's light weight and simplified user interface made for nice street photography, one of my favorite pastimes.\nI tended to carry the camera at my waist in one hand, holding onto the lens, sometimes with the camera body flipped upside-down, with my pinky finger on the shutter button. That way, I achieved a kind of nonchalant pose that did not draw attention to my picture-taking.\nAlso: I used Google's photo-to-video AI tool on my selfie - and it made me do the tango\nSometimes, I looked at the LCD to see what I was snapping, but oftentimes, I just took a picture in the general direction to see what chance would produce.\nThe autofocus function of the BF was super fast, notably faster than the response time of the fp-L, probably because of the BF's lower-megapixel-count sensor. That made for excellent motion capture, such as this basketball game:\nOne of the BF's shortcomings is having an electronic shutter: Instead of mechanical blades opening and closing, the sensor chip controls in software when the exposure happens. The common knock against an electronic shutter is that it can lead to blurring of fast motion. In the case of the basketball game, in late afternoon daylight, I saw no issue.\nAnother potential drawback is that indoors, in artificial light, the electronic shutter can produce dark bands across the image if the shutter speed is too fast. That can require you to take the picture at a slower shutter speed. In practice, I found it not to be much of a problem.\nImproved electronics\nIn addition to autofocus speed, Sigma has done a very good job with the BF's low-light support, which was already quite good on the fp-L.\nOne of my favorite low-light picture tests is a diorama in the North American mammals hall of the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. This is one of the darkest exhibits in the museum, and it's challenging to photograph if you don't have the camera resting on a tripod to allow for a long exposure.\nAlso: Why ads are coming to your favorite AI bots and you've only got yourself to blame\nTwo taxidermy wolves run on a painted landscape of the Michigan countryside. To the naked eye, the diorama is very, very dark because it is meant to suggest nighttime on the prairie. Here's what it typically looks like, taken with minimal low-light support by the BF:\nMost museum visitors who view the diorama turn on their smartphone camera's flash to take a souvenir shot. But, to my mind, flooding the scene with flash spoils the effect.\nInstead, I cranked up the BF to its highest ISO setting, 102,400 -- fairly high up there for any digital camera. The result is that the wolves emerge in beautiful detail from the darkness -- not as sharp or clean as if the scene were well-lighted, but that's the point:\nIn practice, the BF does a very nice job in darkly lit spaces where you might actually want a picture, such as a jazz club.\nWhen set on a tripod with professional lighting and a backdrop, the BF is also excellent for formal portraits, far better than what you'll get using a smartphone camera for your headshots.\nEven without using a macro lens, the 50mm will allow you to get pretty good closeup shots of something like your favorite toy, from a minimum distance of 18 inches, which you can then crop and still have lots of vivid detail.\nOf course, you could also add a macro lens to the BF and get even closer.\nA gentle introduction to pro features\nSigma has simplified some of the functions for newbies so that the same technical effects are present but in a more inviting fashion. For example, on the Sigma fp-L, a separate button is for \"tone control\" that lets you adjust the light across the scene by degrees for shadows and highlights to make a scene have more or less contrast.\nOn the BF, there's no button for tone control, but when selecting colors with the click-wheel, you can bump up or down values of \"highlight,\" \"shadow,\" and \"fade,\" to alter the degrees of lights and darks. That works in both still images and videos.\nAlso: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out\nThere's also an option called \"look effect,\" where you can dial up or down how vivid or how flat a given color filter is, which is a nice, obvious way to understand making your pictures or videos more striking or more sedate.\nIn practice, the BF does a great job with tone and exposure on automatic. A street scene at sunset, for example, nicely balances the vivid highlights of the sky with the street detail without blown highlights or detail lost in the shadows.\nWhen you review photos, the main LCD display gives you all the information on the tone adjustments you made, which is helpful for determining what works and what doesn't.\nSome things that are typically buried in sub-menus on digital cameras are brought forward in the BF's UI.\nSo, for example, when filming a movie, you have the option to turn on \"constant AF,\" which does a better job of grabbing hold of a new subject entering the frame. That is now an option from the click-wheel rather than being buried as a sub-menu option.\nOf course, there are trade-offs to simplicity. Other functions that were accessed directly via dedicated buttons on digital cameras become things you have to hunt for.\nFor example, auto-exposure lock forces the camera to keep the amount of light in the scene the same as you move it, rather than altering the exposure. This allows you to find the right balance of light and dark and hold onto it while you shift your focus.\nAlso: The 10 apps I can't live or work without - on Windows, Mac, and mobile\nOn the fp-L, auto-exposure lock has its own button. In the BF, you have to move the click wheel to the exposure section of the menus and then turn on auto-exposure lock by tapping on the icon. This extra step is fine if you don't use auto-exposure lock much.\nAnother example is a feature of most digital cameras called fill light, the ability to lighten up dark parts of a picture. On most cameras, you have an option to turn on the fill light while you're taking pictures. On the BF, fill light is something you adjust after the fact by editing the DNG, \"digital negative,\" or \"RAW,\" image in the camera.\nSigma's suggestion overall is to use color and filter adjustments to achieve a similar effect to fill light. In other words, the user interface consolidates traditional operations such as fill light and auto-exposure lock into a simpler set of choices that can be more centrally manipulated.\nAnd some things are just different. On the fp-L, and most cameras, when recording a video, you can take a still image as you're recording. On the BF, if you want a still image as well, you do it when replaying the video, by selecting \"save as JPEG.\"\nHow it performs with video\nSpeaking of video, I found the results were very satisfying. You can take 6K video (6,016 x 3,384) that looks great even without electronic stabilization turned on.\nI took this shot of a woman having her personal photo shoot in front of the Plaza Hotel. Although it's jerky and not cinematic, it was a wonderful spontaneous moment in great quality:\nWhen you turn on the electronic stabilization feature, video is reduced from 6K to \"ultra-high-def\" (3,840 x 2,160) because the camera needs to crop each frame to line up frames and make the shakiness disappear.\nIn a low-light setting, such as this video at Small's jazz club in Greenwich Village, I thought it produced a wonderful-looking film without a tripod.\nHere's where we see an example of the click-wheel at its best. I had the fun of rotating through the different color filters to change up the color from moment to moment while filming, something I would never do when color choices are a single button.\nAlthough my use of the feature is rather gimmicky here, I can see all kinds of possibilities with the click wheel, enabling new ways of controlling the camera during filming.\nLike all cameras, the sound you record with the built-in microphone video is never as good as if you had a dedicated mic attached, especially for something like music. But I thought the result here was very good in a space with challenging acoustics.\nAlso: This hidden Pixel camera setting gave my photos the pop they've been missing\nEven in low light, using the camera hand-held, you can get a nice video like this one taken in a darkened tango hall. In a dark place like a dance hall, with swaying bodies moving to and fro, with the camera in your hand and no stabilization turned on, it can be challenging to capture motion in a way that's satisfying. I love what the BF did with the color and the lights in this scene while managing to shift autofocus from one couple to the next:\nBattery life\nBattery life was fine for my purposes. I got as much as six hours of shooting on a single charge, including intermittent shooting and periods of intense activity. That meant in some cases over 500 exposures in DNG+JPEG format. That's better than the official specification by Sigma for approximately 260 images on a charge. Of course, your results may vary.\nIn my experience, plugging the BF into an iPad via USB-C for forty minutes will charge the camera from zero back to a third of its battery life. You can also bring along a spare battery and swap it in via the latched compartment on the bottom of the BF.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe complaints I've seen about the Sigma BF from seasoned photographers seem to be mostly about the reduction of controls to the click wheel and the mini-LCD. Consolidating controls in that way, they argue, robs the pro photographer of their muscle memory. Some pros also wish the touch screen did more to control the functions rather than just serving as a very good display.\nAlso: I tried Google's new agentic IDE, and it blows away the popular VS Code - here's how\nIn essence, pros have a hard time adjusting to a radically simplified UI. It's a fair point of view, but this is something of a Steve Jobs moment. You have to break a few eggs to make an omelette, and you may have to break habits to reinvent how photography is done.\nI think the BF is a terrific option for a beginning photographer or even an experienced pro. The touch-screen display is intuitive in a smartphone age, the electronics are just as fast as you'd expect based on smartphone picture-taking, and the output is very Instagram-worthy.\nAnd your envious friends will immediately want to know, What is that wild-looking camera you've got?"

It's not a direct upgrade to the original but rather an alternate version focusing more on portability. Although it isn't a true successor, this device does address some problems of the previous generation -- but not all of them. While the Go S provides a better experience, the new console is still plagued by many of the same issues.\nAlso: The Lenovo ThinkPad I recommend to hybrid workers isn't the newest model - but it's 50% off\nLenovo made substantial design changes to its handheld. It is smaller than before, sporting an eight-inch WUXGA (1920 x 1200 pixels) touchscreen. The Legion Go, by comparison, has a nearly 9-inch Quad HD (2560 x 1600 pixels) display. Yes, the resolution is lower, but I still found the image quality on the Legion Go S quite good. The compact size also enables the console to weigh less, clocking in at 1.61 pounds.\nNew year, new look\nAnother big design change is that the controllers are no longer detachable. Although they're affixed to the console, the unit doesn't feel bulky. Lenovo's new handheld is ergonomically sound. It has textured grips on the side to prevent slipping, hall-effect joysticks to maintain accuracy, and a large directional pad. On the back are a pair of switches that directly affect the travel distance for the triggers.\nFor example, a short-distance trigger can help with precise targeting in first-person shooters, while a long press is better for racing games. Audio output has also been improved. Instead of coming from tiny grills at the top, sound comes out of drivers on the front to completely envelop players.\nYou may notice a tiny square between the speaker and the joystick on the right. That's actually a touchpad, which makes navigating the internet quite smooth. Controlling a cursor with a joystick feels awkward.\nAlso: Why I pick this ultraportable Lenovo tablet over the iPad Air for mobile entertainment\nAround the display are four buttons. The two at the top provide access to certain features, such as a quick menu for tweaking system settings. The other two are for in-game functions like a pause menu.\nGaming performance: It's good, but...\nUnder the hood is an AMD Ryzen Z2 Go chipset, an integrated AMD Radeon graphics card, and 32GB of RAM. I initially tested it by running 50 tabs and several open apps simultaneously. The hardware ran really well; however, that load activated the cooling fan, turning a normally quiet handheld into a noisy turbine.\nAlso: I tried MSI's new Windows PC handheld - now I'm wondering if gaming laptops should even exist\nThe Legion Go S can handle a wide array of games, including AAA titles. I enjoyed the \"Monster Hunter Wilds Beta\" on the Legion Go S, albeit with the graphical settings toned all the way down. High-resolution graphics caused stuttering. Regardless of visual quality, I was impressed that I was able to play an unoptimized game without major issues. That 120Hz refresh rate from the display came in handy by smoothing animations.\nAs much as I enjoyed the Legion Go S, I need to be honest about its flaws. The battery doesn't last very long. During testing, the device lasted just under two hours on a single charge before tapping out. On the continuous battery test, it ran for about seven hours. I was disappointed to see the Legion Go's short lifespan transferred over.\nThere were also some software problems. At first, they weren't too bad. For example, the startup screen would sometimes place the login box near the top of the display instead of in the center. However, things got worse over time: I couldn't play \"Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth\" due to an issue with the DirectX 12 API.\nTo my understanding, there's some incompatibility between \"Final Fantasy\" and the AMD processor. I spent about an hour scouring old Reddit posts, trying to fix it. After a while, I gave up. I just wanted to play, not do any troubleshooting. I bet many of you feel the same way.\nAlso: Nvidia's Shield TV finally gets an update - and some users see 'unbelievable' performance gains\nDoes this mean that the Legion Go S can't play certain games? Possibly, although I don't think it'll be a common problem. Every single game I tested except the one outlier ran just fine.\nZDNET's buying advice\nPre-orders for the Lenovo Legion Go S are live at Best Buy. Prices start at $730. I recommend this handheld for people who want a lightweight console with rich audio output. If you prefer something with better performance and superior battery life, I suggest the MSI Claw 8 AI+. While gaming, the Claw 8 lasts twice as long as the Legion Go S -- at 4.5 hours -- although it is more expensive."

Powerful Meteor Lake processors, visually stunning RTX 40-series GPUs, the works. With that in mind, you'd think that professionals looking for high-end machines would be clamoring to buy one of these machines for themselves, but that's not really the case.\nGaming laptops aren't exactly ubiquitous, but why? Well, it might have to do with their flashy RGB lights that light up like Disney's Electrical Parade.\nAlso: How much RAM does your PC really need in 2025? I did the math for Windows and Mac users\nGaming devices often come equipped with RGB lighting, which looks cool, but can be pretty distracting, especially when you're in a work meeting trying to look serious and have a laptop lit up like a Christmas tree in front of you. Subtlety is the name of the game here.\nThankfully, manufacturers are taking notice of this potential shift in customer preference. Dell, for one, has come up with a solution in a new gaming laptop that also has the working professional in mind: the Alienware m16 R2.\nI am a big fan of Dell's design choices here. The m16 R2 strikes a good balance of looking aesthetically cool while also maintaining practicality. On the outside, you have a shiny dark gray exterior with a stylized number 16 and an Alienware logo at the top. You'll notice there isn't a big thermal shelf jutting out; the heat vents are flush with the display when positioned upright.\nDitching the shelf makes this laptop easier to carry compared to bulkier models. Owners will need all the help they can get since the m16 R2 isn't easy to carry around; it weighs nearly six pounds.\nOn the inside is a matte black keyboard. The RGB lighting on this dark background makes the colors stand out nicely. Typing on the keyboard was a pleasure, too. The matte surface is smooth to the touch, and the keys all have a springy feel to them. I'm a sucker for a comfy keyboard, but the comfort level isn't what I like most about the m16's keyboard.\nIf you look closely at the function keys, you'll notice different icons than what you would see on a standard keyboard, as they have unique functionalities made specifically for this laptop.\nAlso: Should you buy a handheld PC? This Lenovo model running SteamOS made my decision easy\nF2 is the most useful in my opinion since it activates Stealth Mode. The mode causes the RGB lights to instantly turn white, making the machine look more like a generic work laptop. This is super useful for when you're in a public setting and don't want to attract attention to yourself. Pressing F1, on the other hand, activates Performance Mode.\nHitting the button while gaming forces the hardware to instantly perform better by defaulting the hardware to preset settings optimized for gaming. The problem with this mode is that it also immediately activates the cooling fans, and they're quite loud. At least the fans do work well at keeping the laptop from overheating.\nF4, F5, and F6 are for keybinds, letting you tie custom actions to them, with F3 reserved for saving your keybinds. All the usual audio control functions have been moved to the far right. Besides the keyboard, I enjoy how the edge of the palm rest at the front of the machine is noticeably round. It's softer on the wrists when compared to other laptops, ensuring a comfortable typing experience.\nFeatures like these allow the m16 R2 to pull double duty at being a gaming and work-centric laptop and indicate that Dell put a lot of thought into designing the model.\nOne thing worth noting, though, is that I did find the trackpad to be a little small. Perhaps they wanted to make room for the speakers above the keyboard, in which case I say it was a worthwhile move since the audio sounds great for a laptop. Just keep in mind that they're not powerful enough to fill a room.\nAlso: Why I'd still choose this 2024 Windows laptop over newer models - especially at this new price\nThe Alienware m16 R2 runs on an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H, a processor I notice is commonly found on many 2024 laptops. It's a good option as it offers solid performance while not inflating the price tag too much. To see what it's capable of, I ran it through the Geekbench test, where the processor earned a score of 12,725, outperforming the Ultra 9's average score of 12,611. So on the right laptop, the Ultra 7 can be a better chip than the higher-end hardware.\nAlongside the CPU are the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card and 16GB of RAM, though it would've been nice to have 32GB. I experienced a dip in performance when I was playing Helldivers 2 at high graphical settings. But 16GB is fine; it gets the job done in most situations.\nSpeaking of video games, the gamers out there will love the device's screen. It's a 16-inch 2K resolution display (2,560 x 1,600 pixels) with a refresh rate of 240Hz. A high refresh rate enables smooth and responsive gameplay, making it a near necessity for fast-paced titles.\nAlso: I found a 16-inch Windows laptop that could replace my MacBook Pro (and it's $200 off)\nAll this hardware does come with a power cost, however. While it's unplugged from a power source, the battery on the m16 R2 doesn't last very long despite all the tech meant to support its longevity. I performed my usual test of running an endlessly playing YouTube live stream at 720p and 50 percent brightness, and it lasted 6.5 hours with Best Power Efficient enabled.\nZDNET's buying advice\nI recommend the Alienware m16 R2 to people who want a laptop that can do double duty. It excels at being an entertainment/gaming machine, but it's inconspicuous enough for the office. Prices for the laptop have risen in recent months. A build carrying an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, a GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card, and 16GB of RAM can be bought for $1,900 at Best Buy. A more powerful configuration with 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD is available for $2,479 at Amazon.\nI should mention that you can customize certain parts of the device even after you've purchased it. For example, you can upgrade the SSD from 1 TB of storage to 8 TB. To learn how to do this, follow the instructions on pages 36 to 44 of the laptop's Owner's Manual, which you can find on Dell's website."
