      "feedback": "The draft overreads the near‑term by layering too many disparate narratives without a tight causal chain or explicit, testable thresholds for 0–3 weeks. Up your world‑class quality by (1) consolidating to three focused, testable threads tied to immediate catalysts: tariff/auto pricing (S15934PBQ), NBA Beasley cap/negotiations as a near‑term liquidity signal (XB5ZRN1VP with D4/D8 ESPN pieces), and hardware/consumer storage momentum via Synology BeeStation Plus (8VMO3PFEO, S15934PBQ- or related NAS coverage in Source 9). For each thread, give a precise, first‑principles map: Tariffs flow to auto input costs, pass‑through to new‑vehicle pricing, and potential CPI autos impact; separate from that, Beasley’s free‑agency status and cap space reshapes team budgets and risk sentiment in sport equities; BeeStation’s on‑prem storage dynamic signals a mini‑cycle in hardware pricing/adoption. (2) Quantify with exact numbers from the sources and reconcile conflicts: tariffs moved to 15% (vs 27.5%), Toyota NA operating income swing to a $438m NA loss, Pistons’ MLE exhaustion and $7.2m Early Bird ceiling, Beasley’s potential $42m/3‑yr plan vs. $28.9m/2‑yr LeVert deal, and BeeStation’s 8 TB/around $400 price with 8‑user sharing. Tie each figure to a proximal, observable trigger (e.g., a CPI autos print or a fresh NBA cap/news update) and state the implied price/valuation move if that trigger hits. (3) Strengthen the causal chain and monitoring: replace generic statements with explicit cause‑and‑effect logic (tariffs → pass‑through rate R; Beasley landing spot and cap room as supply/price ceiling; BeeStation uptake as durable storage substitute vs cloud), then define monitoring thresholds and invalidations: e.g., if autos CPI stays flat or decelerates for two consecutive weeks, pass‑through is fading; if Beasley signs a mid‑tier deal well above $7.2m, re‑price Pistons’ cap risk; if BeeStation adoption accelerates beyond X units/mo or Plex integration fails, adjust the hardware cycle view. (4) Sharpen structure to the horizon: present a crisp “What to watch now” with four bullets, a one‑paragraph near‑term catalyst map, and a short, quantitative “watch levels” section (e.g., CPI autos subcomponent drift; Beasley landing spread; BeeStation FW/feature uptake). (5) Clean up citations and ensure every substantive claim maps to IDs in SOURCE MATERIAL (S15934PBQ; XB5ZRN1VP; D4/D8; 8VMO3PFEO; 4B5JK15SY; 1/2 if used for cap/data; 9 for BeeStation page). Do not inject extraneous sources. (6) Remove extraneous market‑color that isn’t anchored to a trigger in the shown window; keep the focus on immediate drivers, near‑term catalysts, and the expected reaction function, with clear invalidation and next‑step monitoring. Overall, reorganize into a tight three‑thread framework with explicit numbers, thresholds, and a concise watchlist, then re‑cite every assertion with the corresponding IDs: (S15934PBQ)(XB5ZRN1VP)(D4)(D8)(8VMO3PFEO)(4B5JK15SY).",
