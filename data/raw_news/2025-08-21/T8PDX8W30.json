  "description": "\"Humpy\" Wheeler died Wednesday night, August 20 of natural causes at 86 years old. Here's what to know.",
  "content": "NASCAR lost a legend on Wednesday as former president and general manager of Charlotte Motor Speedway, Howard Augustine \"Humpy\" Wheeler Jr., died of natural causes, Charlotte Motor Speedway announced. He was 86 years old.\n\nWheeler was a prominent figure in the rise of NASCAR. He was a master at marketing races and played a pivotal role in making Charlotte Motor Speedway the track that it is today.\n\nWheeler was a pioneer in the sport. Whether it was bringing Janet Guthrie to the 1976 World 600, becoming the first woman to qualify for a race at a NASCAR superspeedway or delivering NASCAR's first night race in 1993, Wheeler was constantly breaking new ground in stock car racing.\n\nWheeler's exuberant personality made him a natural fit for the NASCAR scene. He was also never afraid to get his own hands dirty. In 2007, Wheeler donned an apron and hat in order to pitch hot dogs and popcorn to fans alongside Joey Chestnut. His larger than life demeanor and humility made him one of the most beloved figures in racing.\n\nIs Humpy Wheeler in the Hall of Fame?\n\nWheeler will be inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame as a recipient of the Landmark Award in the Class of 2026.\n\nIn a statement regarding this distinction, NASCAR Chairman and CEO Jim France referred to Wheeler as a \"visionary whose name became synonymous with promotion and innovation in our sport.\" France continued, \"Humpy transformed the fan experience through his creativity, bold ideas and tireless passion. His efforts helped expand NASCAR\u2019s national footprint, cement Charlotte as a must-visit racing and entertainment complex and recently earned him the NASCAR Hall of Fame\u2019s prestigious Landmark Award for Outstanding Contributions to NASCAR.\"",

      "text": "NASCAR playoff projections, points with one race left in 2025 regular season\nThe NASCAR Cup Series playoff field will be officially determined following the regular-season finale at Daytona International Speedway on Aug. 23.\nThe NASCAR Cup Series playoff field is nearly set with just one race remaining in the 2025 regular season.\nAustin Dillon became the 14th driver to clinch a berth in the playoffs and earned a measure of redemption with his victory under the lights at Richmond Raceway on Aug. 16. Including Dillon, 14 drivers have earned wins this season, leaving just two spots remaining in the 16-driver playoff field.\nThe series now heads to its most famous venue, Daytona International Speedway, for its regular-season finale. The Daytona summer race has produced its share of surprises in recent years, with a number of first-time winners that shook up the playoff field. That includes Erik Jones in 2018, Justin Haley in 2019 and Harrison Burton in 2024, who each celebrated their first NASCAR Cup Series wins at the legendary track.\nFor winless drivers this season, Daytona serves as the ultimate wild card, providing hope that even someone ranked well back in the standings can claim victory and a berth in the playoffs. And should a previously winless driver take the checkered flag in primetime on Aug. 23, that would leave just one spot available to the top-ranked driver without a victory this season.\nTyler Reddick of 23XI Racing and Alex Bowman of Hendrick Motorsports are ranked 15th and 16th, respectively, in the driver standings and would be the final two drivers to make the 10-race playoffs if no new winner emerges. The other side of the 16-driver cut line features two RFK Racing drivers and a two-time NASCAR Cup Series champion: No. 17-ranked Chris Buescher, No. 18 Ryan Preece and No. 19 Kyle Busch, the 2015 and 2019 champion and now Dillon\u2019s teammate at Richard Childress Racing.\nHere\u2019s a look at the top 20 drivers in the standings following Saturday night\u2019s race at Richmond ranked by playoff seeding as of now:\nNASCAR driver standings \u2014 Projected 2025 playoffs\nA look at the top 20 drivers in the NASCAR Cup Series standings, ranked by projected playoff seeding with one race remaining in the regular season.\nIncludes rank, driver, wins (playoff points in parentheses), regular-season points, and points above or below 16-driver cut line, where applicable:\n- Denny Hamlin \u2026.. 4 (24) ..... 766\n- Shane Van Gisbergen \u2026.. 4 (22) ..... 464\n- Kyle Larson \u2026.. 3 (23) ..... 759\n- Christopher Bell \u2026.. 3 (17) ..... 748\n- William Byron \u2026.. 2 (17) ..... 839\n- Chase Elliott \u2026.. 1 (6) ..... 771\n- Ryan Blaney \u2026.. 1 (11) ..... 756\n- Chase Briscoe \u2026.. 1 (7) ..... 698\n- Bubba Wallace \u2026.. 1 (8) ..... 639\n- Joey Logano \u2026.. 1 (7) ..... 616\n- Ross Chastain \u2026.. 1 (6) ..... 589\n- Austin Cindric \u2026.. 1 (8) ..... 543\n- Josh Berry \u2026.. 1 (6) ..... 476\n- Austin Dillon \u2026.. 1 (5) ..... 460\n- Tyler Reddick \u2026.. 0 (2) ..... 714 ..... +89\n- Alex Bowman \u2026.. 0 (0) ..... 685 ..... +60\n- Chris Buescher \u2026.. 0 (-3) ..... 625 ..... -60\n- Ryan Preece \u2026.. 0 (2) ..... 591 ..... -94\n- Kyle Busch \u2026.. 0 (0) ..... 537 ..... -148\n- Ty Gibbs \u2026.. 0 (0) ..... 512 ..... -173\nNext NASCAR Cup Series race\nDaytona International Speedway will host the final regular-season race on Saturday, Aug. 23 before the 10-race NASCAR Cup Series playoffs begin.\nAt Daytona International Speedway\n- Race: Coke Zero Sugar 400\n- Date: Saturday, Aug. 23\n- Time: 7:30 p.m. ET\n- Location: Daytona Beach, Florida\n- TV channel: NBC\n- Streaming: HBO Max and Fubo\nWatch NASCAR Cup Series races on Fubo"
