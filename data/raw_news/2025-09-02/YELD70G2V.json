  "title": "Sound Advice: Protecting children\u2019s hearing starts with early proactive care",
  "description": "The idea that children are not at risk for hearing loss is untrue. Experts say watch for these signs that could indicate an ear infection.",
  "content": "We live in a visual world, which means we often ignore the importance our other four senses \u2013 specifically our hearing \u2013 when it comes to our overall health. \u201cHearing, speech and language, and social development are part of a child\u2019s overall development. If you can\u2019t hear it affects everything else,\u201d says Saunja T. Burt, a Doctor of Audiology.\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health\u2019s National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, approximately two of every 1,000 children in the United States are born with a detectable level of hearing loss in one or both ears. And all 50 states require a hearing screening of newborns before child and mother are discharged from the facility.\n\nStill, the assumption that children and adolescents are not at risk for hearing loss is untrue, says Burt. She says school-aged children are highly susceptible to ear infections due to close interaction with their peers. As any parent knows, children often unknowingly pass illness between each other. Depending on the cause and severity of hearing loss, which can also occur due to ear wax buildup, the issue can be treated and hearing restored.\n\nHowever, the resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases like measles and chickenpox poses a renewed threat of infection-related hearing loss, particularly in under-vaccinated communities, says Brittney Sprouse, manager of audiology and a pediatric audiologist at University of Chicago Medicine. \u201cMeasles, for instance, can lead to inner ear damage or encephalitis, both of which may result in permanent hearing impairment,\u201d Sprouse says. \u201cWhile chickenpox (varicella) is less commonly associated with hearing loss, herpes zoster oticus, a reactivation of the virus, can cause sudden sensorineural hearing loss,\u201d she says.\n\nAn often-overlooked aspect of hearing- loss prevention is equity in access to vaccines, hearing screenings, and follow-up care, Sprouse says. Although hearing detection and intervention programs are supported by federal funding and mandated in all 50 states, children from marginalized or low-income communities are disproportionately affected by both under-vaccination and delayed diagnosis of hearing conditions, she says.\n\nEradication of this once-contained disease will require collective action on the part of parents and communities, Sprouse says, adding that public health efforts must focus on culturally responsive education, improved access to pediatric audiology services, and policy-level support to reduce disparities in hearing health outcomes.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, audiologists and pediatricians should collaborate to ensure interdisciplinary preventive care, where vaccination and auditory screenings are jointly promoted,\u201d she says.\n\nSigns your child may have an ear infection that needs to be treated:InattentivenessWanting the television or radio louder than usualMisunderstanding directionsListlessnessUnexplained irritabilityPulling or scratching at the ears\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), noise-induced hearing loss is increasingly prevalent among adolescents due to unsafe listening behaviors. It\u2019s estimated that more than 1 billion young people are at risk due to exposure to loud sounds, much of which comes from headphones and earbuds.\n\nSome WHO tips for protection:\n\nEverything in moderation. Give your ears time to rest.Check for decibel levels on headphones; most equipment suggests appropriate levels.If a person within 3 or 4 feet of you can hear the audio from your headphones, it\u2019s too loud.",

      "text": "September 10, 2023\nDr. Saunja T. Burt, Pioneering Black Audiologist, Promotes Early Hearing Loss Intervention And Representation In Field\nOur kids are coming off the summer season eager for new school adventures, but how can we support those with hearing loss?\nNormal hearing can be taken for granted. But Dr. Saunja T. Burt, reportedly the first Black audiologist in the Midwest, makes it her business to debunk misconceptions about the field and encourages families to screen and start interventions for hearing loss as early as possible.\nA trailblazer among very few\nBurt, a clinic support audiologist at Oticon, Inc., was inspired by her late mother who made a courageous decision to go back to nursing school when she and her siblings were younger.\nGrowing up in Youngstown, Ohio, \u201cI just remember my earliest memory dressing up in a nurse\u2019s costume,\u201d Burt recalled.\nShe enjoyed studying with her mother, learning about traumatic brain injury together. But it wasn\u2019t until she saw an audiologist test her little sister that her calling became a bit clearer.\n\u201cOne thing my parents always valued was education,\u201d Burt tells BLACK ENTERPRISE. \u201cBut you just can\u2019t let fear or uncertainty get the best of you. Sometimes it\u2019s easy to stay where we are and what we know.\u201d\nBurt received her B.A. in communicative sciences and disorders from HBCU Hampton University and her master\u2019s in business administration from Nova Southeastern University. Then, she was the first Black student to attend and graduate a four-year Au.D. program at Central Michigan University. Her clinical interest focused on auditory processing and traumatic brain injury.\nDuring commencement, it was rewarding to \u201csee these generations of older Blacks come up to me because they didn\u2019t have the opportunity to realize this is for them,\u201d she said. Her late grandfather, who once wore hearing aids, was proud to have a granddaughter in the profession.\nHaving transitioned from an HBCU to a predominantly white institution (PWI), she found support in speaking about certain challenges, like access to Black hair care. And with that, she left an indelible legacy with her involvement in the Black Graduate Student Association and worked in minority student services.\nBut the journey wasn\u2019t without experiencing bigotry. Insensitive comments can come from patients or supervisors. In an article that Burt co-wrote with her mentors, she suggests that when students complain of bigotry from patients, supervisors should be more proactive, get training, and believe the student.\nBe involved as early as possible, Burt advised. \u201cThat\u2019s how you get information. That\u2019s how you meet people. That\u2019s how you start to feel comfortable in your profession,\u201d she says. She tells BE that she didn\u2019t see a lot of people who looked like her on the board of American Academy of Audiology.\n\u201cI found that my reach has been greater because of the visibility. Students see me on the board,\u201d Burt says.\n\u201cI was very active in the early part of my career, but then I got married, I had children. My mom passed away. I had to step away to do life.\u201d\nDuring the tumultuous time that followed George Floyd\u2019s death, Burt was amazed by how many people reached out to her on Facebook.\n\u201cPeople were really trying to cope,\u201d Burt says. \u201cThat was traumatic for all of us. But nobody was acknowledging that what we saw was a psychological issue. That\u2019s when I realized, I need to do more. And so I ran for the board.\u201d\nAudiology at its finest\nWhen you hear audiology, you might think of hearing aids. But there is much more to this misunderstood discipline. From diagnosing and treating balance disorders and other neurological systems, there are different areas to specialize in.\nBurt shares a story about a mom and her five kids who immigrated to this country. The youngest of the bunch was about seven, but he was still in kindergarten. A social worker took action after realizing how many times he was held back. Burt recognized a problem after he opened his mouth to formulate words.\n\u201cHe has a hearing loss,\u201d Dr. Burt recalls telling the mom. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to catch the hearing loss early on and to detect it.\u201d Newborns are not exempt from hearing loss screenings: \u201cYounger kids are more susceptible, especially babies.\u201d\nThe social and professional impact of hearing loss can be detrimental. School-age hearing screenings are an integral tool to minimize negative academic consequences. \u201cIf it\u2019s an ear infection, it needs to be treated,\u201d Burt said.\n\u201cWithout mandated routine hearing screenings in schools, students with unilateral, less severe, or late onset hearing loss may not be identified or will be misdiagnosed and managed,\u201d according to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.\nAn ear infection is caused by fluid build-up in the middle ear, making it harder for your child to hear because of a conductive hearing loss. Burt said it feels like you\u2019re underwater. However, parents must keep in mind that Black children are less likely to be diagnosed with and less likely to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics for ear infections than white children are, according to a 2014 study.\n\u201cBut the discrepancy in prescribing fewer broad-spectrum antibiotics means Black children actually are more likely to receive care that aligns with the recommended guidelines for treating ear infections,\u201d per the University of Utah Health Sciences.\nPrior to joining Oticon, Dr. Burt was the supervisory audiologist at the Miami Veterans Administration (VA) Healthcare System for 17 years, where she managed the northern outpatient and community-based clinics. She was also a clinical preceptor for third- and fourth-year AuD students. Though some states have guidelines for newborn screening, she witnessed all of the misconceptions about audiology.\n- \u201cThey\u2019re not paying attention.\u201d\n- \u201cThey\u2019re not listening to me.\u201d\n- \u201cIt\u2019s just wax in their ears.\u201d\nThere are over 40 states with statutes or other regulatory language related to universal newborn hearing screening. \u201cThe fact that some states set the standard as low as 85% of all newborns raises significant issues about accessibility and coverage,\u201d per the National Center for Hearing Assessment and Management.\nA mentor and community servant\nAs a certified mentor, Burt has mentored over 45 students and professionals throughout her career. She often encourages students to pursue an audiology degree by discussing her journey. Besides being on the Board of the American Academy of Audiology, she is vice president of Jack and Jill of America Inc, Greater Fort Lauderdale Chapter as well as a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority.\nThat\u2019s not all aspiring audiologists should do.\n\u201cYou have to do an externship. Get in contact with professional organizations, attend conferences if you can because people are always looking for opportunities to recruit students.\u201d\nMuch like an internship, an externship offers a brief opportunity for professional development. However, unlike internships, where participants engage in job-related tasks, externs primarily observe and learn from seasoned professionals in their field. Externships generally maintain a more informal structure compared to internships and typically do not provide monetary compensation.\nShe also advises to reach out to your university and professors. And don\u2019t forget the power of social media for networking.\n\u201cDon\u2019t make all the mistakes on your own. Listen to other people.\u201d\nRELATED CONTENT: 3 Black Business Leaders Paving The Way In Non-Traditional Industries"

      "text": "Key points\n- Varicella (chickenpox) is an acute infectious disease caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV).\n- The most common chickenpox complications are bacterial infections of the skin and soft tissues in children and pneumonia in adults.\n- The most effective prevention for varicella is chickenpox vaccination.\nCause\nVaricella is highly caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which is a DNA virus that is a member of the herpesvirus group. Primary infection with VZV causes varicella. After the primary infection, VZV stays in the body (in the sensory nerve ganglia) as a latent infection. Reactivation of latent infection causes herpes zoster (shingles).\nWho is at risk\nPeople at risk for severe varicella include:\n- Immunocompromised people without evidence of immunity to varicella.\n- Pregnant women without evidence of immunity to varicella.\n- Newborns whose mothers have varicella from 5 days before to 2 days after delivery.\n- Premature babies exposed to varicella or herpes zoster.\nIncubation period\nThe average incubation period for varicella is 14 to 16 days after exposure to a varicella or a herpes zoster rash. It takes from 10 to 21 days after exposure to the virus for someone to develop varicella.\nHow it spreads\nThe virus can be spread from person to person by direct contact, inhalation of aerosols from vesicular fluid of skin lesions of acute varicella or zoster; and possibly through infected respiratory secretions that also may be aerosolized.\nA person with varicella is considered contagious beginning 1 to 2 days before rash onset until all the chickenpox lesions have crusted. Vaccinated people may develop lesions that do not crust. These people are considered contagious until no new lesions have appeared for 24 hours.\nBased on studies of transmission among household members, about 90% of susceptible close contacts will get varicella after exposure to a person with disease.\nAlthough limited data are available to assess the risk of VZV transmission from zoster, one household study found that the risk for VZV transmission from herpes zoster was approximately 20% of the risk for transmission from varicella.\nBreakthrough varicella is also contagious. One study of varicella transmission in household settings found that people with mild breakthrough varicella (<50 lesions), who were vaccinated with one dose of varicella vaccine, were one-third as contagious as unvaccinated people with varicella. However, people with breakthrough varicella with 50 or more lesions were just as contagious as unvaccinated people with the disease.\nDisease rates\nPrior to vaccine introduction:\nVaricella used to be very common in the United States and contributed significantly to the burden of childhood disease. In the early 1990s each year:\n- More than 4 million people got varicella\n- 10,500 to 13,500 were hospitalized\n- 100 to 150 died\nMore than 90% of cases, 70% of hospitalizations, and about half of the deaths occurred in children.\nTo see post-vaccine era disease rates, read about the impact of the U.S. varicella vaccination program.\nClinical features\nA mild prodrome of fever and malaise may occur 1 to 2 days before rash onset, particularly in adults. In children, the rash is often the first sign of disease.\nIn unvaccinated people, varicella progresses rapidly from macular to papular to vesicular lesions before crusting.\nThe most common chickenpox complications are bacterial infections of the skin and soft tissues in children and pneumonia in adults.\nBreakthrough varicella occurs less frequently among those who have received 2 doses of vaccine; compared with those who have received only 1 dose.\nPrevention\nCDC recommends 2 doses of varicella vaccine for all children, adolescents, and adults without evidence of immunity to varicella. Those who previously received one dose of varicella vaccine should receive their second dose for best protection against the disease.\nNosocomial transmission of VZV is well-recognized and can be life-threatening to certain groups of patients. Reports of nosocomial transmission are uncommon in the United States since the introduction of varicella vaccine.\nPatients, healthcare providers, and visitors with varicella or herpes zoster can spread VZV to susceptible patients and healthcare providers in hospitals, long-term care facilities, and other healthcare settings. In healthcare settings, transmissions have been attributed to delays in the diagnosis or reporting of varicella and herpes zoster and failures to implement control measures promptly.\nAlthough all susceptible patients in healthcare settings are at risk for severe varicella and complications, certain patients without evidence of immunity are at increased risk.\nTesting and diagnosis\nVaricella-zoster virus (VZV) laboratory testing information applies to testing and diagnosis of primary VZV infection (varicella) and reactivation (herpes zoster). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most helpful laboratory test for confirming cases of varicella. PCR can detect VZV DNA rapidly.\nPatient management\nIsolation\nHealthcare providers should follow standard precautions, airborne precautions (negative air-flow rooms), and contact precautions until lesions are dry and crusted. If negative air-flow rooms are not available, patients with varicella should be isolated in closed rooms. They should have no contact with people without evidence of immunity. Patients with varicella should be cared for by staff with evidence of immunity.\nImpact of U.S. varicella vaccination program\nThe varicella vaccination program has dramatically decreased virus circulation and increased community protection.\n- Varicella hospitalizations and deaths declined 94% and 97%, respectively, among people 50 years old and younger.\n- The greatest decline in cases was among people 20 years old and younger who were born during the program, with 97% drop in hospitalizations and more than 99% drop in deaths.\n- The risk of shingles is significantly lower among vaccinated children, including those who are immunocompromised.\n- There is about an 80% lower risk of shingles among healthy vaccinated children compared to unvaccinated children who had wild-type varicella.\nDisease prevented and dollar saved\nDuring the first 25 years, the U.S varicella vaccination program saved 118,000 life-years, at net societal savings of $23.4 billion and prevented an estimated:\n- 91 million cases\n- 238,000 hospitalizations\n- 1.1 million hospitalization days\n- 2,000 deaths\nFor every $1 spent, the estimated return on investment is $1.70; however, the benefits of the investment will continue to accrue beyond 2020."

      "text": "That ringing in your ears you can't shake? There's a name for it.\nIf you often experience a ringing in your ears or hear sounds that no one else can, you're not alone. According to the U.S. National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, between 10% and 25% of adults experience what's medically termed tinnitus.\nThat means some 34 to 85 million Americans can relate on some level to hearing noises that don't have an external source \u2014 though these sounds have to persist for three months or longer for it to be considered chronic tinnitus. It's also worth noting that, \"while millions of people have tinnitus, only a small percentage are significantly bothered by it,\" says Dr. Tina Huang, an otolaryngologist who treats patients with tinnitus and other hearing issues at the University of Minnesota Medical School.\nHere's what tinnitus is, what causes it and its most common treatments.\nWhat does it mean when your ears ring? What is tinnitus?\nTinnitus is defined as \"sound that a person hears when there is no external source of the sound,\" says Huang. Such noises are often described as a \"ringing\" in the ear, but a multitude of other sounds can also apply. These include pulsing, buzzing, squealing, clicking, chirping, roaring, humming, whistling, hissing and rushing. \"Some people even describe the noise they hear as musical,\" says Sarah Sydlowski, the audiology director of the Hearing Implant Program at Cleveland Clinic.\nFor some people, such sounds can be so loud the individual can't focus on anything else. For others, the noise can be so soft or subtle that it could be easily missed. Sounds can also be high-pitched or very low and can come and go or maintain a more constant presence.\nTinnitus can happen to anyone, but it occurs more frequently in adults than children, and is especially common in adults 40 years or older. People with tinnitus may experience frustration, problems sleeping, relationship troubles, difficulty concentrating heightened anxiety and irritability and mental health issues.\nWhat causes tinnitus?\nAll causes of tinnitus are not universally understood. \"It's complex because the actual pathway for the creation of tinnitus is not fully mapped in the brain,\" says Huang. \"But we do know there is no genetic component to tinnitus.\" Instead, environmental factors and getting older play the biggest parts. For instance, age-related hearing loss can affect the brain's auditory nerve and is thereby one of the most common causes of tinnitus.\nAnother common factor is damage related to repeated exposure to loud noises such as deafening music, work environments with loud machinery or frequently attending especially raucous sporting events. \"When the 18,000 or so sensory cells in the inner ear are damaged by loud sounds, the ear is less capable of sending signals to the hearing nerve and ultimately to the brain,\" says Sydlowski. Damaged sensory nerves are thought to be why tinnitus is especially common among veterans \u2014 as active military members are sometimes exposed to bursts of gunfire or bomb blasts.\nBlockage of the ear canal due to earwax or other substances can also cause tinnitus, as can suffering from an ear infection or head or neck injury. \"Head trauma in general can cause tinnitus even when it doesn't cause noticeable changes in hearing since tinnitus is brain-generated,\" says Huang. High doses of certain medications can also contribute to tinnitus. Some of these include antidepressants, NSAIDS, certain antibiotics and anti-malaria medicines.\nLess commonly, tinnitus is sometimes related to brain tumors, jaw-joint problems or chronic conditions such as thyroid disorders, diabetes or autoimmune disorders.\nWhat is the best way to treat tinnitus?\nTreatment options for tinnitus vary depending on what's causing the problem. Sometimes stopping the behavior that causes tinnitus or changing one's medication are all that is needed. Other times, the root cause of the problem needs to be fixed such as treating the underlying injury or condition. Wearing a sound generator or hearing aid can also treat symptoms associated with tinnitus.\nSound therapies can be helpful as well, as can tinnitus retraining therapy. \"Another of the main treatments for tinnitus is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as the main goal of treatment is to make the tinnitus less bothersome,\" says Huang. She adds that stress reduction techniques and improved sleep can also help.\nWhite noise machines can also be useful in masking frustrating or distracting noises. \"A fan running or sounds like rain or a thunderstorm playing can help because tinnitus is most noticeable in quiet places where there isn't other sound,\" says Sydlowski. \"Anything that can take your brain's attention off the sound can be helpful,\" echoes Huang.\n\"Whether tinnitus is barely noticeable to debilitating,\" adds Sydlowski, \"it's important to know that it can be treated and managed.\""

      "text": "Key facts\n- By 2050, nearly 2.5 billion people are projected to have some degree of hearing loss, and more than 700 million will require hearing rehabilitation.\n- Unaddressed hearing loss poses an annual global cost of almost US$ 1 trillion.\n- Over 1 billion young adults are at risk of permanent, avoidable hearing loss due to unsafe listening practices.\n- An annual additional investment of less than US$ 1.40 per person is needed to scale up ear and hearing care services globally.\n- Over a 10-year period, this promises a return of nearly US$ 16 for every US dollar invested.\nOverview\nOver 5% of the world\u2019s population \u2013 or 430 million people \u2013 require rehabilitation to address their disabling hearing loss (including 34 million children). It is estimated that by 2050 over 700 million people \u2013 or 1 in every 10 people \u2013 will have disabling hearing loss.\nDisabling hearing loss refers to hearing loss greater than 35 decibels (dB) in the better hearing ear. Nearly 80% of people with disabling hearing loss live in low- and middle-income countries. The prevalence of hearing loss increases with age, among those older than 60 years, over 25% are affected by disabling hearing loss.\nHearing loss and deafness\nA person who is not able to hear as well as someone with normal hearing \u2013 hearing thresholds of 20 dB or better in both ears \u2013 is said to have hearing loss. Hearing loss may be mild, moderate, moderately severe, severe or profound. It can affect one ear or both ears and leads to difficulty in hearing conversational speech or loud sounds.\nHard of hearing refers to people with hearing loss ranging from mild to severe. People who are hard of hearing usually communicate through spoken language and can benefit from hearing aids, cochlear implants, and other assistive devices as well as captioning.\nDeaf people mostly have profound hearing loss, which implies very little or no hearing. They can benefit from cochlear implants. Some of them use sign language for communication.\nCauses of hearing loss and deafness\nAlthough these factors can be encountered at different periods across the life span, individuals are most susceptible to their effects during critical periods in life.\nPrenatal period\n- genetic factors including hereditary and non-hereditary hearing loss\n- intrauterine infections \u2013 such as rubella and cytomegalovirus infection.\nPerinatal period\n- birth asphyxia (a lack of oxygen at the time of birth)\n- hyperbilirubinemia (severe jaundice in the neonatal period)\n- low-birth weight\n- other perinatal morbidities and their management.\nChildhood and adolescence\n- chronic ear infections (chronic suppurative otitis media)\n- collection of fluid in the ear (chronic nonsuppurative otitis media)\n- meningitis and other infections.\nAdulthood and older age\n- chronic diseases\n- smoking\n- otosclerosis\n- age-related sensorineural hearing loss\n- sudden sensorineural hearing loss.\nFactors across the life span\n- cerumen impaction (impacted ear wax)\n- trauma to the ear or head\n- loud noise/loud sounds exposure\n- ototoxic medicines\n- work related ototoxic chemicals\n- nutritional deficiencies\n- viral infections and other ear conditions\n- delayed onset or progressive genetic hearing loss.\nThe impact of unaddressed hearing loss\nWhen unaddressed, hearing loss impacts many aspects of life at individual level:\n- limitations in communication and speech\n- adversely affected cognition\n- social isolation, loneliness and stigma\n- impact on society and economy\n- effects on years lived with disability (YDLs) and disability adjusted life years (DALYs)\n- limitations in access to education and employment.\nPrevention\nMany of the causes that lead to hearing loss can be avoided through public health strategies and clinical interventions implemented across the life course.\nPrevention of hearing loss is essential throughout the life course, from prenatal and perinatal periods to older age. In children, nearly 60% of hearing loss is due to avoidable causes that can be prevented through implementation of public health measures. Likewise, most common causes of hearing loss in adults, such as exposure to loud sounds and ototoxic medicines, are preventable.\nEffective strategies for reducing hearing loss at different stages of the life course include:\n- immunization\n- good maternal and childcare practices\n- genetic counselling\n- identification and management of common ear conditions\n- occupational hearing conservation programmes for noise and chemical exposure\n- safe listening strategies for the reduction of exposure to loud sounds in recreational settings\n- rational use of medicines to prevent ototoxic hearing loss.\nIdentification and management\nEarly identification of hearing loss and ear diseases is key to effective management.\nThis requires systematic screening for detection of hearing loss and related ear diseases in those who are most at risk. This includes:\n- newborn babies and infants\n- pre-school and school-age children\n- people exposed to noise or chemicals at work\n- people receiving ototoxic medicines\n- older adults.\nHearing assessment and ear examination can be conducted in clinical and community settings. Tools such as the hearWHO app and other technology-based solutions make it possible to screen for ear diseases and hearing loss with limited training and resources.\nOnce hearing loss is identified, it is essential that it is addressed as early as possible and in an appropriate manner, to mitigate any adverse impact.\nRehabilitation for hearing loss\nRehabilitation helps people with hearing loss to function at their optimum, which means they can be as independent as possible in everyday activities. Specifically, rehabilitation helps them to participate in education, work, recreation and meaningful roles, for example in their families or communities, throughout their lives. Interventions for rehabilitation for people with hearing loss include:\n- the provision of, and training in the use of, hearing technologies (e.g. hearing aids, cochlear implants and middle ear implants);\n- speech and language therapy to enhance perceptive skills and develop communication and linguistic abilities;\n- training in the use of sign language and other means of sensory substitution (e.g. speech reading, use of print on palm, Tadoma, signed communication);\n- the provision of hearing assistive technology, and services (e.g. frequency modulation and loop systems, alerting devices, telecommunication devices, captioning services and sign language interpretation); and\n- counselling, training and support to enhance engagement in education, work and community life.\nWHO response\nWHO\u2019s work on ear and hearing care is to promote integrated people-centred ear and hearing care (IPC-EHC).\nWHO\u2019s work is guided by the recommendations of the WHO World report on hearing (2021) and the World Health Assembly resolution on prevention of deafness and hearing loss.\nWHO\u2019s work includes:\n- guiding, assisting and supporting Member States to increase awareness of ear and hearing care issues;\n- facilitating data generation and dissemination of ear and hearing care-related data and information, such as through the World report on hearing;\n- providing technical resources and guidance to facilitate planning and health systems capacity building for ear and hearing care;\n- providing guidance to strengthen rehabilitation for people with hearing loss through the Package of interventions for rehabilitation for hearing loss;\n- supporting health workforce training in ear and hearing care through the Primary ear and hearing care training resources;\n- promoting safe listening to reduce the risk of recreational noise-induced hearing loss through the WHO Make Listening Safe initiative;\n- observing and promoting World Hearing Day as an annual advocacy event;\n- building partnerships to develop strong hearing care programmes, including initiatives for including affordable and accessible ear and hearing care services and hearing aids in service delivery approaches suitable for low-and middle- income countries and cochlear implants; and\n- advocating for ear and hearing care through the World Hearing Forum."
