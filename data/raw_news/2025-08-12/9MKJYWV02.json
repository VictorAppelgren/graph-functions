      "text": "Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are dancing in a snow globe.\nThe couple enjoyed a private getaway to Lone Mountain Ranch in Big Sky, Montana, according to multiple outlets, where they were joined by sportscaster Erin Andrews for dinner.\nE! News has reached out to reps for Travis, Taylor and Erin for comment but has not yet heard back.\nIt\u2019s the second cooler locale Taylor and Travis have journeyed to in their newfound downtime following the end of Travis\u2019 NFL season and the close of her Eras Tour. The couple enjoyed time in Park City, Utah, earlier this month, where fans saw them grab dinner out together.\nErin, for her part, has been Travis and Taylor\u2019s number one fan long before they made their relationship official.\nIn fact, the 46-year-old and her podcast partner Charissa Thompson practically spoke the power couple\u2019s romance into existence way back in August 2023, shortly after Travis revealed he fumbled while trying to give Taylor a friendship bracelet at her Kansas City concert.\n\"Taylor, I don't know what you're doing in your life right now besides rocking the world,\" Erin said during the pair's Calm Down with Erin and Charissa podcast. \"Please, try our friend Travis. He is fantastic. I know we're not the best of friends, we're not even friends, but I consider you one. Take us up on this. Go on a date with this guy.\"\nTo which Charissa added, \u201cDo it for yourself, do it for us, and do it for the people. Because there is no one who would give you a better time than this guy.\"\nAnd indeed, with the Grammy winner and Kansas City Chiefs player\u2019s romance coming to fruition shortly thereafter, even Travis himself has credited the pair for their manifesting.\nAs he commented on Charissa\u2019s throwback to the clip in October 2023, \u201cYou two are something else!! I owe you big time!!\"\nSince then, Erin has remained ready on the bench to support Taylor and Travis\u2019 relationship.\n\"I want them to get married so bad,\" the FOX Sports commentator told E! News in March 2024. \"I love, love. I love him. He's amazing.\"\nAnd of Taylor, she added, \u201cI'm fully obsessed with her and what she's done in her life, how she makes me feel as a woman.\"\nFor more of Taylor and Travis\u2019 best moments, keep reading."
