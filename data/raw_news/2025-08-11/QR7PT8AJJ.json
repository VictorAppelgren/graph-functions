  "title": "Proficient, its stock under siege, turns in solid numbers for the second quarter",
  "description": "Proficient Auto Logistics\u2019 stock has been sliding for months but its second quarter numbers were sequentially better. The post Proficient, its stock under siege, turns in solid numbers for the second quarter appeared first on FreightWaves.",
  "content": "Even as the stock of Proficient Auto Logistics was getting hammered for the quarter and then some\u2013dropping about 34% from early April to Monday\u2019s close at $5.97\u2013the auto hauler racked up several performance metrics during those three months that were solidly above that of the first three months of the year.\n\nAmong the key numbers at Proficient (NASDAQ: PAL), its operating ratio came in at 96.7%. While that is far worse than the 91.8% recorded in the second quarter of 2024, it marked a sequential improvement of 200 bps from the 98.7% it posted for the first quarter.\n\nThat improved OR helped lead the company to an adjusted operating income of $3.8 million for the quarter, an improvement sequentially from the $1.2 million recorded in the first quarter. But the year-on-year comparisons were not positive; the company had adjusted operating income in the second quarter of 2024 of $8.7 million.\n\nCEO Rick O\u2019Dell, who on the company\u2019s first quarter earnings call had spoken of late quarter strength in the market (possibly the first signs of the impact from the Jack Cooper closure), said that stronger trend continued into April, resulting in record revenue for Proficient (which admittedly has only been around since May 2024). Revenue and unit volumes for the month were up 13% and 25%, respectively, though the comparisons were impacted by Proficient acquisitions in August 2024 (Auto Transport Group) and at the start of this year\u2019s second quarter (Brothers Transport).\n\nBut the strength has continued, O\u2019Dell said. Between the impact of the Brothers acquisitionand gains in market share that may have been bolstered by the collapse of auto hauler Jack Cooper\u2013though O\u2019Dell did not specifically reference the company\u2013O\u2019Dell said \u201cJune did not decelerate from May, and revenue performance finished above our expectations for the combined May and June months.\u201d\n\nSequential comparisons have been highlighted by several companies this quarter. Year-on-year comparisons were always going to be negative, and the market is looking for some signs of life from the freight market.\n\nProficient\u2019s volume almost certainly got a significant boost from the first quarter closure of Jack Cooper.\n\nProficient delivered 220,758 vehicles in the quarter while its subhaulers moved 401,848 vehicles. A year ago, the corresponding numbers were 152,714 and 354,998, respectively. In the first quarter of this year, when the Jack Cooper shutdown would have first been hitting the market, the numbers were 163,754 and 330,755.\n\nOne metric that was not a positive for Proficent in the quarter was its measurement of yield, revenue per unit on company deliveries. It was $178.82 in the second quarter, down 15.8% from a year earlier when the figure was $212.25. It was also down 3.5% sequentially.",
