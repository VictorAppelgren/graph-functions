  "title": "Vanke's Net Loss Will Likely Extend Till 2027 Amid Weak Margins of Property Development",
  "description": "Morningstar is an investment research company offering mutual fund, ETF, and stock analysis, ratings, and data, and portfolio tools. Discover actionable insights today.",
  "content": "As one of the primary developers in China focusing on middle-range to high-end properties, China Vanke experienced a more than-20% revenue CAGR from 2014-19 as the market boomed. Property development remains the largest contributor to revenue with an over-80% mix, but the housing demand slowdown and price decline since 2021 have weighed on sales. We expect the downsizing to persist for Vanke in the short run as sales in lower-tier cities continue to underperform. Looking beyond the near-term headwind, an uptick in homebuyers\u2019 confidence, easing home purchase restrictions, and local governments' renewed support will lead to sales rebound for Vanke, in our view. As delivery of housing projects will likely require a multiyear cycle, we think Vanke\u2019s property development will resume a single-digit top-line growth starting in 2028.",
