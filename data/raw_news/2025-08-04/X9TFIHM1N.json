Notable companies include Hochschild Mining, which is experiencing a transformative phase with a forecasted earnings growth of 25.6% annually, and TBC Bank Group, expected to grow earnings by 17.2% per annum. Both companies are trading below their estimated fair values, making them appealing options for growth-focused investors.",
