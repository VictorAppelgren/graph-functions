  "title": "Liberty University faces second lawsuit accusing it of mishandling sexual assault cases",
  "description": "An ex-employee alleged she faced workplace discrimination in addition to retaliation for working with Education Department investigators.",
  "content": "\u2022 Former Liberty University employee Erika Woolfolk alleges she was fired for cooperating with a federal investigation into the university's handling of sexual assault cases.\n\u2022 Woolfolk claims she faced a hostile work environment, racial discrimination, and unequal pay while working in the Title IX office.\n\u2022 Liberty University denies Woolfolk's claims, stating her termination was due to \"legitimate business reasons\" related to Title IX investigations.\n\u2022 This lawsuit follows a similar case filed by another former Liberty employee and comes after the university was fined $16 million for Title IX violations.\n\nA former Liberty University employee says she was terminated in part for cooperating with a federal investigation of the school\u2019s handling of sexual assault, according to recently filed court documents.\n\nIn her suit against the private Christian university, Erika Woolfolk stated she was paid less, required to work more, and the subject of a hostile work environment while employed in the university\u2019s office of Equity and Compliance and Title IX.\n\nWoolfolk\u2019s work involved investigating cases of sexual violence on campus, of which she alleged her bosses would improperly predetermine their outcomes, according to her lawsuit. She claimed in the filing that she shared that information and more about the university\u2019s \u201csystemic violations of federal law\u201d with the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nShe also claims she was fired for it.\n\nShe is now the second former Liberty University employee who has alleged in lawsuits that they reported the university\u2019s improper and unethical investigations into sexual assault and were later terminated. Most recently, Peter Brake sued the university along similar grounds and his firing was cited in Woolfolk\u2019s filing. Both suits also name as a defendant Ashley Reich, a former top administrator at the university who oversaw the Title IX office.\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, Liberty University declined to respond to all the allegations but disagreed with Woolfolk's claims. It stated that her termination did not have to do with her race or her interactions with the federal government. Instead, her firing was tied to \"legitimate business reasons\" related to Title IX investigations.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to Reich for comment but received no response prior to publication.\n\nThe Biden-era Education Department in 2024 found that the university had created a culture where students and others were afraid to report sexual violence. The university was penalized $16 million as a result. It also remains on federal monitoring through April 2026.\n\nLiberty has previously said it believed it was treated unfairly by the Biden administration, while agreeing \u201cthere were numerous deficiencies that existed in the past\u201d with its compliance with the Clery Act. That regulation includes requirements for how universities respond to and report sexual assault and other crimes on their campuses.\n\nThe government\u2019s final report found that college administrators overlooked and failed to track repeat cases of sexual violence on campus, and that it failed to warn students of potential danger. It laid out how university officials tried to cover their tracks by seeking technology staff to delete hard drives.\n\nLiberty, based in Lynchburg, Virginia, is among the nation\u2019s largest and most prominent Christian universities. The school is also hugely popular among Republican politicians. Jerry Falwell, a televangelist and conservative figure, started the school in 1971. The university has grown thanks to online students \u2013 about 124,000 combined in the 2023-24 academic year, according to the school \u2013 and it took nearly $880 million in federal financial aid for its students in the 2022-2023 academic year, according to the Department of Education.\n\nIn her lawsuit, which was filed in the U.S. District Court in the Western District of Virginia, Woolfolk stated she earned undergraduate and master\u2019s degrees at the school and had been working there since 2014. She initially produced content for the Liberty Flames Sports Network, before transferring to the Office of Equity and Compliance/Title IX in 2018.\n\nIn that office, she was the only Black employee and faced a hostile work environment, the suit states. She alleged she was paid less than her more inexperienced peers and was asked to work longer hours on more arduous tasks. She said she was denied promotions and accommodations, like remote work, while Reich routinely stayed home, according to the lawsuit.\n\nShe also described facing racial comments from her colleagues, like one who stereotyped \u201cBlacks as either \u2018black-black\u2019 or \u2018white-black\u2019\u201d with more positive connotations for the latter, according to the lawsuit. The suit also included screenshots from Microsoft Teams chats where her peers joked about naming a coworker\u2019s new dog after Confederate generals.\n\nWoolfolk\u2019s suit also states that Reich regularly influenced the findings of Title IX cases, either directly or through another employee. In another instance, Woolfolk learned details of a confidential case were improperly shared throughout the office, which \u201cposed significant risks of prejudice to complainants and respondents.\u201d That was because members of her team would sometimes have to serve as neutral deciders in cases other than their own.\n\nIn 2022, Woolfolk spoke to Education Department investigators. Her suit states she told them about numerous violations of Title IX, which included \u201csystematic efforts to minimize and downplay sexual assault reports; and predetermined case outcomes before investigations were completed.\u201d She also alleged that Reich was aware of her actions.\n\nBy June 2024, Woolfolk said she had filed an internal complaint against Reich related to workplace discrimination and retaliation for cooperating with the federal government. She was assigned to work virtually, but was fired days later. The suit stated that the university fired her for unspecified compliance issues. She was terminated on the same day as two other investigators, including Peter Brake, who had also raised complaints about Reich.\n\nReich now works at the Education Department where she'll be recused from matters involving the school. In a statement to USA TODAY, a department official praised her nearly two decades of working in higher education, policy development and government affairs, and said that she'll help advance President Donald Trump's agenda but didn't offer more details about her role.Woolfolk is seeking legal fees and an unspecified amount of damages.Chris Quintana is an investigative reporter at USA TODAY.

      "text": "Liberty to pay Jerry Falwell Jr. $15 million settlement after high-profile sex scandal\nLiberty University will pay its former president, Jerry Falwell Jr., about $15 million to settle litigation following his resignation in 2020 after a high-profile sex scandal that drew national attention to the private Christian institution.\nThe settlement was announced in 2024, but neither Falwell nor Liberty shared details about what it included \u2212 or how much Falwell would be paid.\nBut buried deep in a recently filed 2023-2024 tax form, the university revealed it's paying Falwell a multimillion-dollar figure to \u201csettle certain claims and close certain transactions.\u201d As part of the agreement, Falwell agreed to pay the university $440,000 to settle \"disputed expenses\" between him and the university. Details about those claims were not included.\nIn total, Falwell will receive roughly $5.5 million to settle the lawsuits in addition to roughly $9.7 million he already received as part of his retirement package, according to the tax documents.\nLiberty University declined to comment. University spokesperson Ryan Helfenbein instead directed a reporter to a 2024 news release about the agreement in which both parties said statements beyond the settlement were not \"necessary nor constructive.\" \"Both the University\u2019s Board of Trustees and Jerry Falwell, Jr. sincerely regret the lengthy and painful litigation process, and each take responsibility for their part in the disputes,\" the release said at the time. \"Falwell acknowledges and apologizes for the errors in judgement and mistakes made during his time of leadership. The Board of Trustees acknowledge and apologize for the errors and mistakes made on their part as well.\"\nStart your day informed: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing newsletter.\nFalwell also declined to comment on specifics about the agreement, but said he was \"very pleased with the outcome of the settlement negotiations and with the final settlement.\"\nThe settlement could mark the end of an embarrassing chapter for Liberty, one of the largest Christian universities in the country. The school prides itself on promoting fundamental biblical values. For instance, it prohibits its students from having sex outside marriage or drinking alcohol (though that rule doesn't apply to online students not on campus) in accordance with its honor code, The Liberty Way.\nFalwell took over the university in 2007 after the death of his father and founder of the university, the Rev. Jerry Falwell Sr. The younger Falwell helped grow student enrollment, much of it through online classes, while making it a mainstay among top Republicans. And he was one of the first evangelical leaders to endorse President Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential campaign.\nBut in August 2020, Falwell made headlines when he posted a photo of himself with his arm around his wife\u2019s assistant. He held a drink in his hand, and both of their pants were unbuttoned. He went on leave shortly after.\nHe resigned just weeks later after news of a sex scandal involving him, his wife, Becki Falwell, and another man, Giancarlo Granda. He said Falwell was a participant in the multi-year relationship. Falwell has described it as his wife having an affair. He told The Wall Street Journal of his departure at the time that he wanted what was best for the university.\nShortly after he left, Liberty launched an investigation into his conduct at the university. Falwell then sued the university for defamation but dropped it months later. Liberty then sued Falwell in 2021, arguing he had breached his contract. In 2023 Falwell filed two separate claims \u2212 one over his retirement package and the other against the university over its use of his father\u2019s image. Amid the dispute, Falwell and his wife were barred from entering the campus.\nBut by July 2024, Falwell and the university announced they would drop their claims. He was allowed back on campus and attended the university's homecoming game. And though Jerry Falwell Jr. is no longer working for the university, his brother Jonathan Falwell serves as chancellor and is the head of the massive Thomas Road Baptist Church, which was also started by the senior Falwell.\nIn the meantime, the federal government, under the Biden administration, penalized the university $16 million in 2024 for creating a culture on its campus in which students were afraid to report sexual violence. The penalty included a $14 million fine and required the university to spend $2 million \u201cfor on-campus safety improvements and compliance enhancements.\u201d The government also placed Liberty on federal monitoring through April 2026. The university said at the time and recently to the Justice Department that it felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration.\nContributing: Steve Berkowitz\nChris Quintana is an investigative reporter at USA TODAY.

      "text": "He reported improper investigations and sexual harassment. Liberty University fired him.\nA former Liberty University staffer is suing the private Christian school, saying administrators fired him for reporting sexual harassment.\nPeter Brake worked as an investigator in the university\u2019s Title IX office, typically the unit that investigates claims of sexual violence on campus.\nAmong his claims, Brake, who was also an adjunct professor, alleges that his former boss harassed employees and was \u201cprejudging cases.\u201d He also states he reported his concerns to his supervisors, including the university president. The lawsuit says he was fired because he \u201copposed discrimination and reported multiple violations of law to Liberty\u2019s leadership and senior managers.\u201d\nBrake's attorney, Andrew T. Miltenberg of the law firm, Nesenoff & Miltenberg, in a statement said his client filed suit after giving the university an opportunity to, \"end its reign of oppression and inequity.\"\n\"In doing his job, Dr. Brake has repeatedly tried to protect the students and employees from the injustices occurring at Liberty University,\" Miltenberg wrote. \"He is coming forward now to hold Liberty University accountable after it harshly retaliated against him.\"\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, the university said it learned of the suit on Tuesday and was still reviewing its details.\n\"Liberty takes all allegations of wrongdoing seriously and has impartial measures in place to assure the fair and equal treatment of all employees,\" the statement read. \"While we will not respond to these allegations in the media at this time, we disagree with its claims and are prepared to defend ourselves in court.\"\nThe lawsuit, which was filed in the federal court in the Western District of Virginia on Friday, comes after Liberty University was penalized $16 million by the Biden-era Education Department in 2024 for creating a culture where students were afraid to report when they suffered sexual violence. The penalty is the largest of its kind. The agency also placed the school on federal monitoring through April 2026.\nLiberty has said of the government\u2019s finding that while it, \u201cendured selective and unfair treatment by the Department, the university also concurs there were numerous deficiencies that existed in the past.\u201d\nThe government's final report found that college officials overlooked and failed to record repeated instances of sexual violence on campus, and that the school failed to warn students about potential threats. It detailed university officials\u2019 attempts to cover their tracks by seeking help from technology staff to delete hard drives. The allegations even included a former Liberty president accused of rape \u2013 an incident that didn\u2019t appear in a daily campus crime log.\nLiberty is one of the nation\u2019s most prominent Christian universities and a mainstay among Republican luminaries. Jerry Falwell, a televangelist and conservative figure, started the school in 1971. Based in Virginia, the university has grown thanks to online students \u2013 about 124,000 combined in the 2023-24 academic year, according to the school \u2013 and it took nearly $880 million in federal financial aid for its students in the 2022-2023 academic year, according to the Department of Education.\nWhat\u2019s in the Brake lawsuit?\nBrake served as an investigator in the Title IX office from 2019 to 2024, with a three-and-a-half-year absence to report for active military duty. He is a retired judge advocate in the Army Reserve, and he said he encountered multiple incidents of the university\u2019s former Title IX coordinator, Nathan Friesema, telling investigators which outcomes to reach in their cases. Some other cases \u201csat idle and unresolved for more than a year,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\nThe lawsuit states that Brake brought concerns about Friesema to university President Dondi Costin at a reception for military veterans in November 2023. And when Brake faced pushback from the senior vice president of university compliance, Ashley Reich, for raising concerns, he went back to Costin expressing fear of losing his job.\n\u201cI\u2019m confident your leadership understands that retaliation is not allowed around here, so don\u2019t give that possibility another thought,\u201d Costin wrote in response.\nBrake also told Reich that Friesema had steered Title IX investigations by asking \u201cleading questions\u201d and \u201cembellished complaints,\u201d the lawsuit says In one incident, he described a professor as having \u201csexual desire in his eyes\u201d in support of leering allegations. The goal, Brake alleged, was to trigger a violation of the university\u2019s Title IX and sexual misconduct policies.\nIn May 2024, Brake said he helped two coworkers report to Reich that Friesema sexually harassed them. In one case, a staffer reported Friesema made sexually inappropriate comments to her, such as \u201csharing a personal anecdote about a high-school teacher having sex with a student.\u201d Another unnamed employee alleged that Friesema had subjected her to \u201c\u2018jokes\u2019 about sexual assault,\u201d and bragged \u201cthat he sold t-shirts on his ETSY shop with the logo, \u2018I Love Butt Stuff,\u2019 a crude reference to anal sex.\u201d The lawsuit stated that Friesema was suspended after the employees\u2019 complaints.\nBrake alleges he was fired in June 2024 after filing a formal complaint against Reich in May. He purports the university says it fired him for unspecified \u201ccompliance\u201d issues. He is suing for an unspecified amount of damages, claiming the university violated Title IX and protections for military employees and whistleblowers in Virginia.\n(This story has been updated to add Liberty University's response.)\nChris Quintana is an investigative reporter at USA TODAY.

      "text": "Liberty University penalized $16M tied to Clery Act, culture of fear reporting sexual assault\nLiberty University will face a $16 million penalty for creating a culture where students were afraid to report when they suffered sexual violence.\nThe financial sanction, announced on Tuesday by the U.S. Department of Education, is the largest of its kind.\n\u201cThrough today\u2019s action against Liberty, we're sending the message that we will hold schools accountable if they fail to follow the important requirements of the Clery Act,\u201d said Richard Cordray, the head of the agency\u2019s Federal Student Aid office.\nIn addition to a $14 million fine, the Christian university will be required to spend $2 million over the next two years \u201cfor on-campus safety improvements and compliance enhancements.\u201d And it will be under federal monitoring through April 2026. The agency conducted its investigation under the Clery Act, a federal law that requires universities to track crimes on their campus and warn students of danger.\nUSA TODAY obtained a preliminary Education Department report in 2023 that found, \u201cvictims of sexual assault felt dissuaded by Liberty administration\u2019s reputation for punishing sexual assault survivors rather than helping them.\u201d\nThe final report was unsparing about Liberty\u2019s failure to create a safe environment. It cited rules the university developed itself that worked against that, including the Liberty Way \u2013 a student code of conduct that punishes drinking, drugs and sexual acts.\n\u201cConsequently, victims of sexual assault often felt dissuaded by Liberty administration\u2019s reputation for punishing sexual assault survivors rather than helping them,\u201d the report said. \u201cSuch fears created a culture of silence where sexual assaults commonly went unreported.\u201d\nInvestigation: Feds say Liberty University created 'fear of reprisal' for sexual violence survivors\nIn a Tuesday release, Liberty said that while it had \u201cendured selective and unfair treatment by the Department, the university also concurs there were numerous deficiencies that existed in the past.\u201d Those errors, it said, included \u201cincorrect statistical reports as well as required timely warnings and emergency notifications that were not sent.\u201d\n\u201cWe acknowledge and sincerely regret these errors and have since corrected them in a manner that allows us to maintain compliance in each of these areas,\u201d Dondi E. Costin, Liberty\u2019s president, said in a written statement. \u201cToday is a new day at Liberty University. We remain committed to prioritizing the safety and security of our students and staff without exception.\u201d\nThe university had previously challenged the department\u2019s preliminary findings, saying in an earlier statement that they included \u201csignificant errors, misstatements, and unsupported conclusions.\u201d\nCostin had said the university was facing a $37.5 million fine \u2013 more than double the settled fine.\nHe also told Fox News in October 2023 that the institution was being unfairly targeted by the federal government. Some House Republicans, including chair of the education committee, Virginia Foxx, North Carolina, similarly questioned earlier this year if the agency was, \u201ctargeting religious institutions,\u201d and requested a briefing about its investigation.\nThe university went so far as to file its own Freedom of Information request seeking similar actions against other institutions. However, in a FAQ referenced in Tuesday\u2019s statement, it acknowledged that the resulting documents \u201cdid not in any way show new precedent or a new calculation methodology as had been described to us that we would see.\u201d\nThe final report found that college officials overlooked and failed to record repeated instances of sexual violence on its campus, and that the school failed to warn students about potential threats. It detailed university officials\u2019 attempts to cover their tracks by seeking help from technology staff to delete hard drives. The allegations even included a former Liberty president accused of rape \u2013 an incident that didn\u2019t appear in a daily campus crime log.\nThe report also referenced a staff member who continued to work at the university despite being accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women. USA TODAY in November identified that man as Keith Anderson, who is listed as the executive director of the student health center and wellness initiatives. The final report notes that federal investigators learned late last year that that Anderson was, \u201cterminated at least in part due to the filing of two new credible complaints of sexual misconduct against him.\u201d\nLiberty is one of the nation\u2019s most prominent Christian universities and a mainstay among Republican luminaries. Jerry Falwell, a prominent televangelist and conservative figure, started the school in 1971. Based in Virginia, the university has grown thanks to online students \u2013 about 93,000 combined \u2013 and it took nearly $880 million in federal financial aid for its students.\nThe institution\u2019s image as a Christian sanctuary has been challenged in recent years, including by the actions of its own leadership. Jerry Falwell Jr., who took over after his father\u2019s death in 2007 and helped shape it into the massive institution it is today, resigned in 2020 after a sex scandal involving him, his wife and another man.\nAbout two dozen survivors in 2021 filed a lawsuit against Liberty over its role in creating \u201ca campus environment where sexual assaults and rapes are foreseeably more likely to occur.\u201d All but two of those women settled with the Lynchburg, Virginia university in 2022, though the details of that agreement remain private.\nSarah Mays didn\u2019t settle. She said she was intimidated into retracting her report of being attacked by multiple men in 2001. Mays said the university isn\u2019t facing \u201cChristian persecution,\u201d rather it is the students who are suffering as a result because of Liberty\u2019s administration. She told USA TODAY last year that she was skeptical that a financial penalty would have much impact on the school.\n\u201cA little fine is not going to make them change their ways,\u201d Mays said. \u201cThey can make back any amount of money with a snap of fingers.\u201d\nThe Education Department often investigates universities\u2019 compliance with Title IX, a federal anti-discrimination gender law meant to protect students from sexual harassment. Universities can lose federal funding if they don\u2019t comply although no university has faced that consequence.\nHowever, the government agency has issued fines to schools in the past for failing to meet provisions of the Clery Act. Among the more notable were a $2.4 million fine to Pennsylvania State University in connection with Jerry Sandusky, a former assistant football coach convicted of molesting multiple children. Previously, the largest-to-date was the $4.5 million penalty Michigan State faced in connection with its handling of sports doctor Larry Nassar and the women he victimized.\nS. Daniel Carter, president of the college consulting group Safety Advisors for Educational Campuses and an expert on the Clery Act, said from 2000 to 2023 the federal government issued about $20 million in fines related to Clery investigations.\nHe was also skeptical about claims that the investigation or fine were tied to Liberty\u2019s religious affiliation. Instead, he said, the size of the fine more likely reflects the institution\u2019s substantial financial resources. The college\u2019s endowment tops $2 billion \u2013 one of the nation\u2019s largest.\nConsider Mission University a small private school in Springfield, Missouri that the senior Falwell attended when it was called Baptist Bible College. It was fined $35,000 in January 2023 in connection with a Clery investigation.\nCarter also said the allegations raised in the Liberty case are unlike any other he has seen raised.\n\u201cThe bottom line is that this is an indication that the department is taking enforcement of the sexual misconduct provisions in the Clery Act seriously,\u201d Carter said.\nChris Quintana is a reporter on the USA TODAY investigations team with a background in higher education and student loans.

      "text": "Feds say Liberty University created 'fear of reprisal' for sexual violence survivors\nUPDATE: This story has been updated with comments from Jerry Falwell Jr.\nLiberty University, one of the most prominent Christian colleges in the country, created a culture in which members of its campus community were fearful of reporting sexual violence, according to a preliminary report from the Department of Education obtained by USA TODAY.\n\u201cVictims of sexual assault felt dissuaded by Liberty administration\u2019s reputation for punishing sexual assault survivors rather than helping them,\u201d federal investigators wrote in the May report\nLiberty has faced increasing public pressure in recent years over policies that survivors say allow sexual violence to run unchecked. The preliminary report says overlooked allegations of violence reached all the way to the top, including accusations involving a former university president and a senior administrator.\nSurvivors filed a lawsuit in 2021 against Liberty, saying it had ignored their reports while enforcing a code of conduct known as the Liberty Way. A dozen women settled with the the Lynchburg, Virginia, university the following year in an agreement that remains private.\nThe Education Department\u2019s investigation had been reported before. It centers on whether the university compiled with the Clery Act, a federal law that requires universities to report crime that occurs on their campus. However, the May report contains new details about the university\u2019s attempts to cover its tracks.\nEducation Department investigators, for example, discovered that \u201csenior officials in HR sought the assistance of IT staff to wipe certain computer hard drives on April 26, 2022, the very week that the review team first visited the campus.\u201d\nThat finding is based on interviews with a former dean at Liberty and IT staffer, and it occurred hours after investigators spoke to the university\u2019s executive vice president of human resources about \u201cthe importance of maintaining records.\u201d\n\u201cIt does not appear that any institution-wide record retention program has ever existed at Liberty with respect to its campus security operations, although some individual officers did establish their own guidelines for their operations,\u201d the report read. \u201cSimilarly, the university has been unable to provide the basic documentation to substantiate the accuracy and completeness of the university\u2019s campus crime statistics.\u201d\nInvestigators also referenced a 2016 incident in which a Liberty Police officer noted \u201cstacks of incident reports laying on tables in an unsecured room.\u201d That person later learned the records were to be \u201cshredded.\u201d The officer reported the incident to the \u201cLUPD headquarters,\u201d but a supervisor eventually told the officer to \u201creturn to service.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether the documents were shredded.\nFor its part, Liberty University said in a statement that it has improved its process for complying with the federal government\u2019s requirements. The institution also said it had responded to the government\u2019s initial report by \u201cdetailing significant errors, misstatements, and unsupported conclusions in the Department\u2019s preliminary findings,\u201d the statement read.\n\u201cLiberty University remains fully committed to ensuring compliance in this area is met and maintained and understands the purpose of this review process is ultimately in the greater interest of our students, faculty, and staff,\u201d said Liberty President Dondi Costin. \u201cMore than that, we recognize the original purpose of the Clery Act is for the health, safety, and overall well-being of our entire University community as we remain steadfast in our mission of Training Champions for Christ.\u201d\nThe Education Department didn\u2019t return USA TODAY's request for comment Tuesday but responded on Wednesday, saying the agency doesn't discuss ongoing investigations. Federal law requires the department to keep reports confidential until the government shares the investigation\u2019s outcome with the school. The preliminary report \u2013 also reported by The Washington Post \u2013 is expected to be followed by final findings, which could include such repercussions for the university as fines and monitoring by the federal government.\nIn the report, however, investigators noted: \u201cMultiple victims reported to the review team that they felt that the reporting process at Liberty further complicated an already difficult time in their lives and that they would have been better off if they had not reported these crimes in the first place.\u201d\nUSA TODAY spoke to two of the former students who say they were assaulted while students at Liberty University. Sarah Mays and Helen Wood said they were part of the lawsuit but did not settle with the university. They said it was important for them to be able to speak freely about their experience \u2013 which typically is not allowed under terms of a settlement \u2013 with the hope of improving Liberty in the long term.\nThe federal government can issue fines as part of Clery Act investigations, but both survivors questioned how much impact any fine would have on the monied university. Liberty\u2019s endowment was roughly $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2020 and among the largest in the country, according to government data.\n\u201cA little fine is not going to make them change their ways,\u201d said Mays, who says she was intimidated into retracting her report of being attacked and raped by multiple men in 2001. \u201cThey can make back any amount of money with a snap of fingers.\u201d\nLiberty is one of the nation\u2019s most prominent Christian universities and a mainstay among Republican luminaries. Jerry Falwell, a prominent televangelist and conservative figure, started the school in 1971. Based in Virginia, the university owes its recent growth to online students \u2013 a combined student body of about 93,000 \u2013 and it received about $857 million in federal money for student aid, making it one of the largest recipients of such funding\nThe institution\u2019s image as a Christian sanctuary has been challenged in recent years, often by its own leadership. Jerry Falwell Jr., who took over after his father\u2019s death in 2007 and helped shape it into the massive institution it is today, resigned in 2020 after a sex scandal involving him, his wife and another man.\nWhat did the Department of Education investigation find?\nIn the May report, the Education Department listed 12 findings, which include a lack of administrative capability, inaccurate or inadequate policy disclosures, and a failure to issue timely warnings in connection with the Clery Act.\nInvestigators noted, for instance, that police took a report involving an \u201calleged rape that was committed by a former Liberty president,\u201d but that incident failed to make a daily crime log. The report did not name the president or what came of the investigation. The Post reported that only two presidents were alive when the report was produced: the junior Falwell and John Borek, a member of the board.\nBorek did not return requests for comment. But Falwell told USA TODAY that he had never heard of a rape allegation involving a Liberty president while he was at the institution. He said had spoken to Education Department investigators a few months back, but they did not ask him about the rape allegation involving a former president.\nFalwell added that he recently learned that Liberty\u2019s general counsel and other administrators, \u201csaw it as their job to keep me from being aware of any reported crimes or accusations of assault.\u201d They reasoned, he said, that he might try to intervene on the behalf of a top student athlete or someone from a prominent family.\nInvestigators also found a longtime staffer had been accused repeatedly of harassing Liberty employees, but the campus was never warned about him. In one instance, he allegedly arrived at an employee's home and gave her \u201cmedicine\u201d that caused her to fall asleep. When she awoke, that employee was kissing her. Investigators wrote that the employee was eventually demoted for his actions. A year later, though, the employee got a promotion.\nLiberty regularly touted itself as the \u201csafest college in Virginia,\u201d the report says, and \u201cissuing emergency notifications would have conflicted with that narrative and called attention to the safety issues that existed on Liberty\u2019s campus.\u201d\nInvestigators mentioned a student who played for the football team from 2018 to 2022 and was accused of rape in 2020. That player, investigators wrote, went on to stalk a woman who was a student and university employee repeatedly in 2021 and 2022.\n\u201cDespite the football player\u2019s history of sexual violence, there is no evidence that University officials ever considered alerting the campus about the threat to the Liberty campus community,\u201d the report said.\nThe department also found Liberty failed to report dozens of criminal offenses from 2016 to 2020 that included incidents of rape, domestic violence and stalking. The federal government added that victims of sexual assault often feared speaking up because of \u201cfear of reprisal.\u201d\nLiberty didn\u2019t have the resources to investigate crimes on its campus, according to federal investigators. They noted that the university\u2019s investigative unit was \u201cstaffed by a single officer for the majority of the review period with few process controls and minimal oversight.\u201d\nWhat is the Liberty Way?\nMost universities have policies meant to serve as rough guidelines for how students should behave on campus. These codes of conduct vary but often include prohibitions on hazing, underage drinking and harassment.\nSome religious institutions build tenets of their faith into their codes of conduct. Brigham Young University requires that students remain \u201cchaste\u201d outside marriage and abstain from alcohol, tobacco and coffee. And it\u2019s Liberty\u2019s code, known as the Liberty Way, that survivors say fostered an environment in which sexual violence ran unchecked and underreported.\nIn 2021, ProPublica documented how women who had been raped faced potential violations of the school\u2019s code of conduct when they reported what happened to them. Some were told they would get into trouble because they had been drinking. Others recalled how university staffers discouraged students from reporting when they were assaulted. The assault, college administrators argued, proved they had had sex before marriage, which was against Liberty\u2019s honor code. Several said college staffers altered or removed evidence tied to their reports.\nMays and Wood say they experienced the Liberty Way firsthand. Mays, a student who was Jane Doe 15 in the lawsuit, said she was attacked and raped by multiple men in October 2001 while walking near the campus late at night. Months later, she found out she was pregnant.\nShe didn\u2019t immediately report what happened, Mays said, but then one of her attackers stalked her on campus with a knife. At the Liberty Police Department, officers pressured her to file a report about the more recent incident but to leave out that her attacker had a knife. She was then directed to file a report with the Lynchburg Police Department, where she said officers again intimidated her into altering her report.\nEventually, Mays withdrew her case altogether.\nAs a result, she said the dean of Liberty\u2019s office of women accused her of filing a fraudulent police report. Additionally, because Mays was unmarried and pregnant, she could face expulsion and the loss of her scholarship for violating the Liberty Way.\nThe dean, Mays said, offered her space in a program meant for unwed women who were pregnant. That offer came with a four-year scholarship if Mays put her child up for adoption. She declined. Her daughter just celebrated her 21st birthday.\nWood said she was raped by a member of her taekwondo team in 2015, but Liberty made it difficult to report the case. She said the university also directed her to the Lynchburg Police Department. If she refused, Wood said she was told the university would use the information she shared with them against her \u2013 like the fact that she had been drinking before the attack.\nShe decided not to say anything at all.\nThe attack disrupted her studies. Rather than continue on campus, Wood opted to take classes online before pausing her education. She is still trying to complete her degree.\nFor Wood, there had been little question she would attend Liberty in the first place. Few campuses offered a higher education in the type of religious and cultural environment she wanted. She said she was led to believe it was the type of place where sexual assault didn\u2019t happen. Yet Wood said she would have attended even if she had known the truth.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to hurt the reputation of the school if they were just honest,\u201d she said.\nWhat is the Clery Act?\nAll universities and schools that receive federal funding are required to publish annual reports of the crimes that occur on their campuses. The law that requires that reporting is known as the Clery Act, named after 19-year-old Jeanne Clery, who was raped and murdered on Lehigh University\u2019s campus in 1985.\nThe Education Department\u2019s investigation focused on whether Liberty complied with the Clery Act. It was not a review of the university\u2019s compliance with Title IX, the federal law meant to prevent sex-based discrimination within schools, which is the more common law used in such cases.\nThat difference might seem minor, but USA TODAY has found that schools determined to be in violation of Title IX seldom face sanctions even though the government can technically withhold federal funding.\nThe Education Department has occasionally fined schools that failed to meet provisions of the Clery Act, including a $2.4 million fine to Pennsylvania State University in connection with Jerry Sandusky, a former assistant football coach convicted of molesting multiple children.\nThe largest to date is the $4.5 million penalty Michigan State faced in connection with its handling of sports doctor Larry Nassar and the women he victimized.\nMays and Wood remain hopeful the university will change, saying they continue to hold what the institution has been and could be in high regard. Both kept taking classes at Liberty after their attacks, and Mays earned a bachelor\u2019s and a master\u2019s degree.\nAlthough they said the fine is a good first step, they want to see the Education Department open a Title IX investigation into the university as well.\nChris Quintana is an investigative reporter at USA TODAY.

  "argos_summary": "Former Liberty University employee Erika Woolfolk has sued the Christian university, claiming she was fired for cooperating with a federal investigation into the school\u2019s handling of sexual assault cases and that she endured a hostile, racially discriminatory workplace with unequal pay. Liberty denies the allegations, saying her termination was for legitimate business reasons tied to Title IX investigations, and the suit follows a similar case by former investigator Peter Brake. The lawsuit comes amid a $16\u202fmillion fine imposed by the Department of Education for widespread Title IX and Clery Act violations, and the university is under federal monitoring until 2026. Liberty also recently settled a lawsuit with former president Jerry Falwell Jr. for a similar claim of retaliation, while the federal probe has uncovered a culture of fear that discouraged survivors from reporting incidents.",
