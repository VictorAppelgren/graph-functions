  "content": "A snuggly dog is in need of a warm lap to crawl into in Springfield after her own person died.\n\nSassy, a spritely senior pup who is looking for a second chance in her golden years, has been getting oodles of love at the Humane Society of Southwest Missouri but she\u2019s on the hunt for a more permanent place, the shelter says.\n\n\u201cMeet Sassy, a 10 year old Terrier mix looking for a calm and quiet home where she can thrive. She joined our shelter due to her previous owner sadly passing away. This little lady has some special needs - she is diabetic and hard of seeing, but that doesn\u2019t stop her from being a loving and loyal companion,\u201d the shelter said in an Aug. 26 Facebook post.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to find her a forever home where she\u2019ll be cherished and lovingly cared for day in and day out. With her age and reduced vision, we believe a home without energetic dogs and young children would be best for her.\u201d\n\nEven though she\u2019s partially blind, that doesn\u2019t hold her back from wanting affection.\n\n\u201cSassy has the most loving heart and absolutely loves head scratches and being cuddled. She enjoys being talked to and perks up at voices she recognizes. You\u2019ll often find her burrowed into blankets or snuggled up in a ball, and she loves nap time. She is house-trained, and when her paws touch the grass outside, she knows exactly what to do!\u201d the shelter said.\n\nShe also has some special needs, which shouldn\u2019t be an issue for people savvy with dogs\u2019 medical needs, or those willing to learn.\n\n\u201cSassy also knows the routine with her diabetes and just needs an adopter experienced with insulin/blood sugar checks or one willing to learn,\u201d the shelter said.\n\nTo learn more, visit Sassy\u2019s pet profile or the shelter\u2019s website.",
