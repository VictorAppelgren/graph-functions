  "description": "National Guard troops put boots on the ground Tuesday in the District as the White House shared the first batch of federal arrests and warned the city\u2019s homeless they could face jail time amid President Trump\u2019s takeover of the nation\u2019s capital\u2019s policing.",
  "content": "National Guard troops put boots on the ground Tuesday in the District as the White House shared the first batch of federal arrests and warned the city\u2019s homeless they could face jail time amid President Trump\u2019s takeover of the nation\u2019s capital\u2019s policing.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said nearly 850 federal agents began patrolling the city Monday evening and took 23 suspects into custody on homicide, gun, drug, drunken-driving and fare evasion charges.\n\nShe said the U.S. Park Police cleared 70 homeless camps as well, with the vagrants given the option to seek treatment or a shelter bed.\n\nIf they refused, she said they were told they could be arrested or fined for living on sidewalks, underpasses and grassy patches throughout the District.\n\nMore than 800 soldiers from the D.C. National Guard also arrived Tuesday morning to assist with the Trump administration\u2019s goal of taming violent crime and general disorder in the capital city.\n\n\u201cThese are pre-existing laws that are already on the books, they have not been enforced, which is part of the reason for this nationalizing, or the federalizing of the National Guard to bring in this assistance for law enforcement,\u201d Ms. Leavitt said.\n\n\u201cWhile we are targeting criminals and trying to remove criminals off of the streets, we also want to make D.C. safe and beautiful,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Washington Times contacted the D.C. National Guard about where the troops are being sent.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi, the point person for overseeing the emergency declaration, said Tuesday that she met with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser to lay out how the 30-day period will go.\n\n\u201cWe agreed that there is nothing more important than keeping residents and tourists in Washington, D.C. safe from deadly crime,\u201d Ms. Bondi wrote on X.\n\nJust hours after Mr. Trump announced his emergency declaration Monday, the District recorded its 100th homicide for the year.\n\nMetropolitan Police said the deadly shooting erupted on the 1200 block of 12th Street Northwest just before 7 p.m.\n\nArriving officers found a wounded man, later identified as 33-year-old Tymark Wells, suffering multiple bullet wounds at the scene.\n\nThe victim was rushed to a hospital, but police said Mr. Wells died from his injuries around 10:50 p.m.\n\nPolice data says killings are down 11% year-over-year in the District.\n\n\u201cLast night, DC suffered the grave milestone of its 100th homicide for 2025,\u201d the D.C. Police Union, which supports the president\u2019s intervention into local public safety matters, said Tuesday in a statement. \u201cLet\u2019s hope this federal intervention leads to real change to the laws in DC that allow this to happen year after year.\u201d\n\nThe fatal shooting happened in the same neighborhood where a former federal employee was attacked earlier this month \u2014 the incident that inspired Mr. Trump to exert his authority over the District\u2019s public safety infrastructure.\n\nPolice said Edward Corisitine was walking to his car with a woman on 14th Street Northwest when a group of teens made comments about stealing the vehicle.\n\nAuthorities said Mr. Corisitine pushed his date into the car for her safety and turned to confront the group, who then jumped him.\n\nNews of the Aug. 3 attack on the former staffer at the Department of Government Efficiency, already better known because of his online moniker \u201cBig Balls,\u201d got the attention of Mr. Trump, who blasted out social media posts deriding the state of public safety in the District.\n\nAbout a week later, the president announced his full-scale takeover of the District to crack down on crime.\n\n\u201cOur capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged out maniacs, and homeless people, and we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore,\u201d Mr. Trump said Monday from the White House.\n\nFederal authorities have since been spotted in popular nightlife spots, such as the U Street corridor in Northwest, as well as in the neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River, an area that has long struggled with violent crime and disorder.\n\nMayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, called the president\u2019s move \u201cunsettling and unprecedented,\u201d but said she will follow the law and work with the president during the emergency period.\n\nMetropolitan Police Chief Pamela A. Smith said she has coordinated with U.S. Marshals, who are overseeing the federal deployment, to suggest where agents are most needed.\n\nThe D.C. Council, which is almost entirely made up of Democrats, shot back at Mr. Trump\u2019s declaration by saying it was a \u201cmanufactured intrusion\u201d and that violent crime is at a 30-year low.\n\nD.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, whose office is largely responsible for prosecuting juvenile crimes in the city, called the White House\u2019s takeover \u201cunlawful\u201d and unnecessary because of a sizable drop in violent crime.\n\n\u201cWe are considering all of our options and will do what is necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents,\u201d Mr. Schwalb posted on X.\n\nAccording to police statistics, crime has fallen precipitously in the two years since the District saw a generational spike in killings, muggings and carjackings in 2023.\n\nBut Mr. Trump disputed those numbers Monday when making his announcement, calling them cooked and unreliable.\n\nHe specifically mentioned a high-ranking member of Metropolitan Police who was already under investigation on suspicion of fiddling with crime data to disguise the city\u2019s level of violent incidents.\n\nThe White House said the District has the fourth-highest homicide rate in the nation \u2014 \u201cahead\u201d of such other big cities as New York City, Chicago and Atlanta.\n\nThe Trump administration also said the rate of nonviolent vehicle theft in the District is more than three times the national average, and carjackings went up 547% between 2018 and 2023.\n\nOutside of violent crime, Mr. Trump aims to rein in the mobs of youth who run amok in Navy Yard and the ATV drivers who swarm city streets.",
