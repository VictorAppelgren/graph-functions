  "title": "Top amateur golfers compete in S.F. while reaping rewards of college sports\u2019 new world",
  "description": "The best golfers in this week\u2019s U.S. Amateur Championship at the Olympic Club have more earning potential than ever thanks to sweeping changes in the college sports landscape.",
  "content": "That designation carries a different meaning these days, of course, in the era of Name, Image and Likeness (NIL) deals and revenue sharing. The striking transformation of college sports stretches beyond football to reach top golfers such as Koivun, a 20-year-old who grew up in San Jose.\n\nThis new world hinges on marketing and name recognition nearly as much as tournament titles. Estimates of Koivun\u2019s NIL valuation range from $1.4 million (according to Essentially Sports) to $1.55 million (Golf NIL), a byproduct of two terrific seasons at Auburn. He swept the sport\u2019s major awards last year as a freshman.\n\nGolf NIL\u2019s top 10 features largely the same standout college players who reside near the top of the world amateur ranking, including Michael La Sasso of Ole Miss and Virginia\u2019s Ben James. Also on the NIL list: Arkansas\u2019 John Daly II, son of the two-time major champion, and Florida\u2019s Luke Poulter, son of Ian Poulter, who won three events on the PGA Tour and 12 more on the European Tour.\n\nDaly II and the younger Poulter are solid college players who clearly benefit from their dads\u2019 fame (Daly II has 212,000 followers on Instagram). The same goes for Tiger Woods\u2019 son Charlie, who has an NIL valuation of $2.5 million as a rising high school junior. (Daly II and Poulter are in the field at Olympic, while Woods is not.)\n\n\u201cNIL is great for us \u2013 it puts some money in our pocket, which is nice,\u201d Koivun said. \u201cI\u2019m just thankful I\u2019m at a football school, because they bring in all the money.\u201d\n\nKoivun lived in the Bay Area until age 17 and spent all but his senior year of high school at Mitty. Then his family moved to Chapel Hill, N.C., in part so he could be closer to Auburn.\n\nHe\u2019s showing signs of becoming a PGA Tour star one day, in ways beyond his college success. Koivun has made six tour starts this year and finished in the top 11 three times, including a tie for sixth in one event and tie for fifth in another.\n\nPlayers such as James and Koivun hired agents in high school, a reality Koivun described as \u201ckind of crazy.\u201d There\u2019s also this tangible effect of NIL: It probably plays a role in top golfers staying in school rather than bolt for the tour. (Just imagine what kind of NIL earning power Tiger Woods would have had at Stanford.)\n\nPoulter hired an agent only about two weeks ago, despite his surname and earning potential. His college career started slowly, in part because of a back injury, but he pocketed one victory and five top-10s last season at Florida, where he soon will begin his redshirt junior year.\n\n\u201cI've kind of been trying to play my game and let all that happen,\u201d Poulter said of landing NIL deals. \u201cSo now, because I've been playing a little better, it's coming. \u2026 Sometimes, people can get too engrossed in it and their golf suffers.\u201d",
