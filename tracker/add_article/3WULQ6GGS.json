      "title": "Illegal immigration hit a record-high of 14 million in the US in 2023, Pew report finds",
      "summary": "Pew Research Center estimates that 14 million people were living in the United States illegally in 2023, an all‑time high that eclipses the previous record of 12.2 million set in 2007 and falls short of President Trump’s claim of 21 million. The rise is largely due to about 6 million individuals who entered with legal protections that Trump has since revoked, and the growth is driven by countries other than Mexico, with Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and India among the largest contributors. State‑level data show California, Texas, Florida, New York, New Jersey and Illinois hosting the most undocumented residents, while roughly 9.7 million of them—about 5.6 % of the U.S. labor force—are employed. Pew’s figures, drawn from Census and DHS data, contrast with other estimates such as the 18.6 million cited by the Federation for American Immigration Reform and the 14.2 million reported by the Center for Immigration Studies, underscoring the ongoing debate over the true size of the undocumented population.",
