  "content": "\"It's wild,\" said Geoff Gertz, a senior fellow at Center for New American Security, an independent think tank in Washington, D.C. \"Either selling H20 chips to China is a national security risk, in which case we shouldn't be doing it to begin with, or it's not a national security risk, in which case, why are we putting this extra penalty on the sale?\"\n\nThis came after a U.S. official told Reuters over the weekend that chip companies Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices have agreed to give the U.S. government 15% of revenue from sales of advanced chips to China.\n\nTrump signed an executive order on Monday extending the China tariff deadline for another 90 days, with only hours to go before U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods were due to snap back to triple-digit rates.\n\nWall Street closed lower on Monday, even as the Nasdaq touched fresh highs, with the latest news related to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff war generally sapping risk appetite rather than strengthening it.\n\n* FX: Dollar index rises 0.4%.

In my column today I look at the blizzard of U.S. labor market data - often conflicting, sometimes distorted - and ask which number best shines a light through the fog. Could it now be continuing jobless claims?\n\nWorld markets got the week off to a subdued start on Monday, although the Nasdaq nudged a new high, as a light earnings and data calendar allowed investors to digest the latest tariff-related news and look ahead to Tuesday's U.S. inflation figures.\n\nA rise for Nvidia shares this week would mark a record-breaking 12 consecutive weekly gains. The stock now accounts for 8% of the entire S&P 500 market cap, the biggest weight of any individual stock in the wider index since the data began in 1981, according to Apollo's Torsten Slok.\n\nThe so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" megacap stocks, of which Nvidia is one, now account for a record 35.3% of the S&P 500's total market cap. The top 10 stocks make up a record 40% of the index's market cap.\n\nThis concentration risk is nothing new, of course, but the steady advance deeper into uncharted territory is bound to unnerve some investors.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S.-Brazil relations show no sign of improving. Brazil's Finance Minister Fernando Haddad said on Monday that his virtual meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent scheduled for later this week has been canceled, a blow to Brasilia as it attempts to get the 50% tariff on many Brazilian exports to the U.S. reduced.\n\nSpeculation continues to swirl around who Trump will nominate to replace Fed chair Jerome Powell, whose term officially ends next May. As of Monday, no fewer than eight names appear to be under consideration, according to media reports.\n\nThe main economic indicators on Monday were from China, which showed producer prices fell more than expected in July and no change in consumer prices. Deflation still stalks China, in contrast to the U.S. where tariffs are putting upward pressure on prices.\n\nAttention on Tuesday turns to Australia, where the central bank is expected to reduce its cash rate by a quarter point to 3.60%, and then to CPI inflation figures for July from the U.S.\n\nWhich data point may shine light through U.S. jobs fog?\n\nAmid a blizzard of contradictory signals, it's becoming increasingly difficult to get any visibility on the U.S. labor market. But of all the numbers that feed into the all-important unemployment rate, the one worth paying most attention to may be continuing weekly jobless claims.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said that while he and his colleagues look at the \"totality\" of the data, the best gauge of the health of the labor market is the unemployment rate. That's currently 4.2%, low by historical standards, and consistent with an economy operating at full employment.\n\nBut it is a lagging indicator, meaning that once it starts to rise sharply, the economy will probably already be in a very precarious position. And it is also being depressed by labor demand and supply factors unique to the U.S.'s current high tariff, low immigration era.\n\nEconomic growth is slowing. Broadly speaking, it is running at an annual rate of just over 1%, half the pace seen in the last few years. Unsurprisingly, firms' hiring is slowing too.\n\nThe latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, showed hiring in June was the weakest in a year, while July's nonfarm payrolls report and previous months' revisions were so disappointing that President Donald Trump fired the head of the agency responsible for collecting the data.\n\nBut the unemployment rate isn't rising, largely because firms aren't firing workers. Why? Perhaps because they are banking on tariff and inflation uncertainty lifting in the second half of the year. It's also possible that firms are still scared from the post-pandemic labor shortages.\n\nWhatever the reason, the pace of layoffs simply has not picked up, the monthly JOLTS surveys show. Layoffs in June totaled 1.6 million, below the averages of the last one, two and three years.\n\nMeanwhile, lower immigration, increased deportations, and fewer people re-entering the labor force are offsetting weak hiring, thus keeping a lid on the unemployment rate. The labor force participation rate in July was 62.2%, the lowest since November 2022.\n\nAnd what about weekly jobless claims, another key variable in the labor market picture? In previous slowdowns, rising layoffs would be reflected in a spike in the number of people claiming unemployment benefits for the first time.\n\nThat's not happening either. Last week's 226,000 initial claims were right at the average for the past year, and only a few thousand higher than the averages over the past two and three years.\n\n\"It's a low fire, low hire economy,\" notes Oscar Munoz, U.S. rates strategist at TD Securities.\n\nOne high-frequency number that has gone under the radar, but which merits more attention is continuing jobless claims, which measures the number of workers continuing to file for unemployment benefits after losing their jobs. Rising continued claims suggest people actively looking for a job are struggling to get one, a sign that the labor market could be softening.\n\nThat figure spiked last week to 1.97 million, the highest since November 2021, which in theory should put upward pressure on the unemployment rate.\n\nUsing the 'stock' versus 'flow' analogy, continuing claims are the 'stock,' and weekly claims are the 'flow'. Everyone will have their own view on what's more important, but right now initial claims are offering no guidance while continuing claims are pointing to softening in the job market.\n\nFed officials are on alert, but what would move them to cut rates?\n\nMunoz and his colleagues at TD Securities estimate that continuing claims of around 2.2 million would be consistent with an unemployment rate of 4.5%, a level of joblessness most economists agree would prompt the Fed to trim rates.\n\nThat's also the year-end unemployment rate in the Fed's last economic projections from June, a set of forecasts which also penciled in 50 bps of easing by December.\n\nAn unemployment rate of 4.4% would probably tip the balance on the Federal Open Market Committee, while 4.3% would make it a much closer call, perhaps a coin toss.\n\nFurther muddying the picture, other indicators suggest the labor market is ticking along nicely. July's payrolls report showed that average hourly earnings last month rose at a 3.9% annual rate, consistent with the level seen in the past year. And the average number of hours worked was 34.3 hours, right at the mean for the past two years.\n\nThese numbers and the JOLTS data are released monthly, and there will be one more of each before the Fed's September 16-17 policy meeting.\n\nBut if the increased focus on the unemployment rate means investors want a more regular labor market temperature check, they should keep a close eye on weekly continuing claims.\n\n* Australia interest rate decision * India CPI inflation (July) * UK employment, earnings (July) * Germany ZEW sentiment index (August) * Brazil inflation (July) * U.S. CPI inflation (July) * U.S. federal budget data (July) * U.S. Fed officials on the stump: Richmond Fed PresidentThomas Barkin, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid\n\nWant to receive Trading Day in your inbox every weekday morning?
