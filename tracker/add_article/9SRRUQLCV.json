      "summary": "Broncos edge rusher Nik Bonitto missed practice as he recovers from foot surgery but is expected to return next week. Coach Sean Payton confirmed Bonitto's absence is due to a bone spur removal, not contract negotiations, as the team recently secured extensions for players Zach Allen and Courtland Sutton. Meanwhile, former rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit has signed with Bristol Bears after an 18-month stint in American football, and quarterbacks Bryce Young and C.J. Stroud reflected on their NFL journeys during a joint practice.",
