  "title": "U.S. consumer spending rises despite stubborn inflation",
  "description": "Consumer demand is holding up, but sticky prices and Trump\u2019s tariffs complicate the Fed\u2019s next move on interest rates.",
  "content": "American consumers continued spending more in July, posting the biggest monthly gain in four months and pointing to steady demand despite persistent inflation.\n\nHousehold outlays rose 0.3% from the month before, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported. The increase was fueled by steady income growth and stronger purchases of goods, particularly cars, furniture, and recreational equipment.\n\nA key inflation measure watched closely by the Federal Reserve \u2014 the core personal consumption expenditures index, which leaves out food and energy \u2014 also rose 0.3% for the month as tariffs on imports raised the prices of some goods. The gauge increased to 2.9% year-on-year, its fastest pace in five months.\n\nMuch of the latest price pressure came from services, including financial fees and leisure activities, while goods costs eased. That could add to concerns about inflation as President Donald Trump\u2019s trade tariffs filter through into the wider economy. The Federal Reserve\u2019s next interest rates decision is Sept. 17.\n\nTraders still expect the Fed to cut rates after Chair Jerome Powell opened the door to restarting rate cuts at an August speech at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, but policymakers will receive several more key pieces of economic data before that which could yet swing the balance.\n\nThe latest figures highlight how consumer demand has held up despite high borrowing costs and widespread concern over tariffs imposed by Trump in recent months. Many companies have so far tried to avoid passing on higher import costs by absorbing expenses or cutting inventories, but an increasing number have warned they will have to raise prices.\n\nSpending was largely underpinned by income growth, with wages and salaries jumping 0.6% in July, the largest gain since late 2024. Real disposable income went up 0.2% while the household saving rate was unchanged.\n\nHowever, with last month\u2019s data suggesting the labor market is losing steam, some are concerned that paychecks will not keep pace with price rises as the year progresses. High prices, inflation, and worries about tariffs weighed on consumer sentiment in a recent survey. More jobs data is due next week, which could bring fresh clues about this.\n\nTrump has repeatedly attacked Powell and the Fed this year for its repeated decisions to hold rates steady, mocking the chair as \u201cToo Late\u201d and a \u201cmoron\u201d while insisting inflation is no longer a concern. On Monday, he moved to oust Fed governor Lisa Cook, part of a bid to assert more control over the central bank.",

Income growth, especially wages, helped offset high borrowing costs, but rising import tariffs and service\u2011sector price pressures raise inflation concerns. The Fed is expected to cut rates after the September 17 decision, but additional data could alter that outlook. Trump\u2019s recent tariff actions and attempts to influence Fed leadership add political uncertainty to the economic environment.",
