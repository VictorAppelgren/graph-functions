  "title": "I just upgraded Nintendo's driftiest controller with a Hall effect thumbstick, but this N64 mod won't be for everyone",
  "description": "This N64 controller mod eliminates stick drift for good.",
  "content": "Stick drift is an ailment that has haunted controllers for decades, but N64 gamepads tend to develop a demonic level of driftiness. I've been fixing the retro console's mechanical joystick for decades at this point, and while I'm constantly finding new ways to restore Ninty's components, I've decided to see if hall-effect technology can exorcise the accessory's wonky controls for good.\n\nBelieve it or not, there are multiple N64 hall-effect thumbsticks out there, but I just wrapped up modding my gamepad with Hyperkin's 'Gamecube style' option. The mod effectively swaps out the original mechanical controls for a hall-sensor module, all while using the same housing and footprint as the original part.\n\nThis is by far one of the quickest fixes for N64 controllers with a worn joystick, and you won't have to touch a soldering iron. However, I have experimented with similar mods in the past and found that there are drawbacks to replacing the original stick. Thankfully, I can confirm that the stick's benchmarks are similar to the OG pad and the new 8Bitdo N64 controller, but some enthusiasts might still prefer to keep things original.\n\nI genuinely believe this N64 controller upgrade is one of the easiest mods out there, but you'll still need to disassemble the old '90s gamepad. I know for a fact this will give some of you the ick, especially if you're not used to tinkering with old tech, so I've got basic steps to follow that'll help you dodge any modding mishaps.\n\nLike most projects, this one starts with a screwdriver. The N64 controller thankfully uses standard Phillips head screws, meaning you won't need one of those \"gamebit\" security drivers that aren't in standard sets. I personally use an iFixit Moray kit for small mods, and you'll want to specifically unfasten all the controller's main screws using a Phillips #1 bit.\n\nBut wait! Before you go jamming your screwdriver in the N64 controller's hole and twisting away, I want to proceed with just a sprinkle of caution. These are old, potentially rusty screws we're dealing with, and using too much force or the wrong screwdriver bit could result in stripping the screw. To try and prevent this, I normally insert my driver with good downward pressure, then gently turn until I feel distinct movement. If you start to feel the screwdriver turn without the screw, stop what you're doing immediately and consider using a slightly larger bit.\n\nOn the back, you'll see seven screws in plain sight, but you'll also want to undo two smaller ones inside the back expansion port. Doing so should allow you to separate the shell in half and access the thumbstick module, which is secured to the front shell using three smaller Phillips screws.\n\nOnce you've successfully reached the inside of the controller, you'll be able to extract your pad's drifty old joystick. If you're simply looking to hotswap the part and put everything back together, your last disassembly steps are to remove those smaller screws and pull out the module's cable from the main board gently using a spudger or prying tool. You'll also want to slide out the tiny Z-button board secured to the back, being mindful of its flimsy ribbon cable.\n\nAt this stage, you're virtually ready to place the hall-effect module in the N64 controller and reassemble your N64 controller. The replacement part is nearly identical to the old part on the outside, with the only real visual difference being the type of stick and thumbgrip used.\n\nSince this is a fairly easy project, though, I'm going to sprinkle in a few extra steps to help you easily refurbish your N64 controller. If your pad is already in good condition, you might want to skip the next part, but it will ultimately help improve the controller's performance and looks.\n\nRather than upgrading one of my existing N64 controllers with this hall effect stick, all of which remarkably still boast solid josticks, I decided to pick up a guinea pig gamepad second-hand specifically for this project.\n\nJust like most old retro accessories out there, the N64 controller I ended up with is fairly crusty. Scrubbing decades of dead skin cells, old Cheetos remnants, and sweat-fortified dust off of gamepads is par for the course with this hobby, so I thought I'd use the pad's filth as an excuse for a quick refurb tutorial.\n\nAdmittedly, it also just feels wrong to crack open an N64 controller to jam in a new Hall effect joystick while ignoring all the caked-on dirt. I won't judge you for just giving the shell a quick wipedown and calling it a day, but if you'd rather help the pad look nice and shiny again, you'll want to effectively give everything a bath.\n\nI normally like to start the controller spa process by playing the shell in a reasonably sized basin. You'll want something big enough to submerge the parts in warm water, and I personally like to use just a touch of mild dish soap to combat the built-up grime. It's also worth using separate, smaller containers for your buttons so that you don't have to splash around in dirty water to retrieve them.\n\nI want to stress that you should use warm water rather than anything overly hot for cleaning any old retro console plastics. I tend to just rely on my tap to provide a reasonable temperature, but using anything close to boiling point can warp controller shells.\n\nIf you use water that you can keep your hands in for more than a few seconds, it will be enough to shift the dirt, but I like to use a soft toothbrush and some wooden toothpicks to remove anything stuck in grooves and indents. The trick is to avoid tools that are harder than the plastic itself, like metal, as that'll simply result in introducing new scratches and damage.\n\nLastly, to quote Sabrina Carpenter, please, please, please give your controller parts plenty of time to dry before reassembling. You'll naturally want to rinse everything and pat dry after it's spent enough time in the tub, but you'll also want to let everything air dry for at least 24 hours. I've often found that there are still water droplets hanging around shells for longer than that, and if they get on the circuit board, they could cause corrosion.\n\nProviding everything is bone dry, you can then reassemble your N64 controller, install the new hall-effect, and admire your work. I personally think my before and after shots speak for themselves, especially when you compare the close-ups, and you'll be surprised at how well a near-30-year-old gamepad can scrub up.\n\nNaturally, your controller may have scratches that can't be scrubbed off, and old console plastics can start to yellow if they're kept out of the sunlight. There are ways to reverse this using hydrogen peroxide and UV light, but if you'd like me to delve into that process in a dedicated article, let me know in the comments.\n\nCan you teach an old N64 controller hall effect tricks?\n\nI know some of you out there will be wondering why you'd want to add a hall-effect joystick to an N64 controller in the first place. To fully understand why the replacement part is even a thing, it's worth delving into the OG thumb stick's flaws and why similar solutions haven't quite hit the mark in the past.\n\nA picture says a thousand words, so it feels only right to show you what 30 years does to the N64 controller's mechanical stick. The main issue with its design is that it uses a combination of gimbals, springs, flywheels, and optical sensors to detect movement. The mechanism is entirely plastic, and the friction caused by moving Nintendo's \"control stick\" causes the parts to literally disintegrate into dust over time.\n\nThere are effectively multiple failure points when it comes to the N64 stick. For starters, the gimbals will start to get wider over time as the plastic wears down, which causes the stick to wiggle. The joystick bowl that serves as a gate also tends to get deeper as the stick rubs against it, which also stops the mechanism from returning to the centre.\n\nAll of this culminates in old N64 joysticks developing stick drift, and it's arguably more severe than modern cases. Therefore, it's easy to see why players might want a quick solution that fixes the issue for good. That said, it does come at the cost of changing how the controls feel, and I can confirm that older \"GameCube Style\" replacements that use traditional potentiometer-based tech aren't super accurate.\n\nNot only will older ALPS N64 joysticks potentially develop stick drift down the road, but their ranges aren't anywhere near the same as Nintendo's OG setup. If you run benchmarks using controller testing software, you'll see that the readings are way out of range and show up as a square, whereas the official stick and even 8Bitdo's Analogue 3D controller show up as more of an octagon.\n\nIt's worth noting 8Bitdo's N64 pad does use hall-effect tech, and that did provide me with some confidence in regards to Hyperkin's newer replacement part. Upon benchmarking my newly refurbished controller, I actually found that the readings were nearly identical to the official pad, meaning my initial accuracy fears were completely unfounded.\n\nI consider Goldeneye 007 to be the ultimate N64 controller test since it relies on accurate movement. While my older Hyperkin ALPS stick feels pretty unwieldy thanks to those wide ranges, the hall-effect stick genuinely feels almost the same as the original.\n\nAdmittedly, the actual feel of the GameCube-style thumb stick does feel different since there's far less resistance compared to the old mechanical sensors, and some of you might not be into that. I would say that if you didn't grow up with the N64, though, this new stick will probably feel more natural to you, even if it's not strictly authentic.\n\nShould upgrade your N64 controller with a hall effect joystick?\n\nI know I'm going to upset some retro purists when I say this, but I think Hyperkin's N64 hall-effect joystick is well worth considering in most cases. I wouldn't replace a perfectly functioning OG stick if it's still nice and springy, as preserving original hardware is a passion of mine. However, if you do need a quick fix that boasts similar benchmarks, I reckon this is the part for the job.\n\nIt helps that this N64 hall-effect joystick upgrade is one of the simplest mods out there, as it makes the project super approachable. That said, I do think it's worth asking yourself if you actually want to be using the OG pad with the Nintendo 64, as there's a wealth of alternatives out there that ditch the three-pronged setup for something arguably more ergonomic.\n\nThose of you who do adore the trident-shaped pad might also want to keep the old mechanical joystick, too, and I completely get why. One of the things I love most about retro gaming is getting to experience tech exactly how it would have arrived back in the day, warts and all.\n\nThose of you who prioritise authenticity will want to explore different N64 controller remedies. Not only are there like-for-like replacements by Kitsch-Bent that use Ninty's design, but there are even metal parts by the likes of SteelSticks64 that'll better withstand wear.\n\nOf course, I'll also continue to fix the original parts to the best of my ability, and I'm always finding new ways to do so. I've even started experimenting with completely restoring the optical-mechanical module using 3D printing, but even with that in mind, I'd still highly recommend giving Hyperkin's hall-effect replacement a shot, even if just for your player 2 pad.",

      "text": "After 30 years as a Zelda fanatic, I can't believe I've found a new way to revisit the series on N64\nThe Summercart64 is an essential retro console gadget.\nPicture the scene - it's the year 2000 and you've just finished Zelda: Majora's Mask on N64. That effectively marks the end of your adventure as Ocarina of Time Link on Nintendo's first 3D console, and if you're anything like me, you would be itching for more.\nPull out the Master Sword and fast forward to 2025, and I've finally got a way to play various Ocarina of Time spin-offs on N64. While the concept isn't remotely new, I've been using a flashcart dubbed the Summer64 to load fan-made Zelda ROM hacks on Ninty's original hardware, which effectively means you can play new outings on one of the best retro consoles released 29 years ago.\nKaico Summercart64 | $89.99 at Amazon\nThere are a few different versions of the Summercart64 floating around at Amazon and Aliexpress, but this one by Kaico has the creator's stamp of approval and comes with everything you'll need to get started. The cart itself mimics the look and feel of Ninty's OG games, and it supports custom firmware via USB.\nThe Kaico Summercart64 I'm using has made it ridiculously easy to fire up N64 Zelda ROM hacks and embark on new outings. The fact that it costs more than a new Switch 2 game might raise a few eyebrows, but it actually packs the same features as vastly more expensive options like the EverDrive X7.\nAs for what that functionality is, you'll be able to load up N64 games on its included 8GB microSD card just like an original cartridge. Created by Polprzewodnikowy, the open-source project allows for custom interfaces to select your games and tweak options like region settings. Game saves also work without the need to reset your game first, and while that might not sound like a biggie, it'll mean hours of gameplay won't be down the drain if you forget to push the button.\nSo far, I've largely used the SummerCart64 to check out the vast number of Zelda mods there as a weird method of relaxation. Stand-out adventures so far include Ultimate Trial, which features a grueling gauntlet of 75 challenges and a Dark Souls-inspired hub world, and Missing Link, a short prelude to Twilight Princess that fills in some gaps.\nThis flashcart is also your key to playing new ROM hacks like the Zelda and Ace Attorney mashup Hero of Law, and trust me when I say playing on OG hardware adds to the sheer absurdity. That said, the Summercart64 isn't just for playing cursed Zelda concoctions, as it'll easily run other fan projects, unreleased romps like Dinosaur Planet, and even Nintendo 64DD games without the rare disc drive using an FPGA chip.\nI test tons of gaming hardware, old and new, over the course of a year, but it's the Summercart64 that lives in my head rent-free. I'd call it an absolute essential if you're still playing games on the Nintendo 64. If you're still hung up about the freshly announced Analogue 3D delays, or just fancy picking up a gadget for that new 4K N64 revamp before it lands, you'll absolutely want to look into this flash cart.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\n- See more Nintendo 64 accessories at Amazon\n- Hyperkin Captain controller for N64 | $19.99 at Amazon\n- HDMI Adapter for N64 |\n$23.99$18.99 at Amazon\nLooking to play classics on a portable?

They're also extremely nerdy about retro consoles and playing the classics on both new and old systems.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "This is probably the reason Switch 2's Joy-Cons aren't immune to stick drift\nWhy hasn't Nintendo fixed one of the biggest issues with the original Switch?\nIf you were hoping that Nintendo would make the Switch 2 immune to stick drift, I have bad news for you. We've known since early April that the new console's controllers don't use anti-drift thumbstick tech like Hall or TMR sensors, but now that the console is out, we have a better idea of why Nintendo hasn't truly remedied the problem.\nEarly teardowns of the Nintendo Switch 2's Joy-Cons are showing that the thumbsticks use almost the exact same sensor as the original ones, albeit with some metal reinforcement in places and a smaller overall size.\nThe form factor of the Joy-Cons themselves doesn't lend itself to a larger Hall Sensor thumbstick module, even if other controller manufacturers like Hori have managed to fit this technology into similarly-sized Nintendo Switch controllers. Hall Sensor controllers often come in cheaper than their potentiometer counterparts as well, so it's hard to point to price as being the reason Nintendo opted for a traditional drift-prone thumbstick sensor.\nIn fact, now that we've been hands-on with the Switch 2 for a bit longer and seen those early teardowns, the reason seems to be far more practical. Since the Switch 2's Joy-Con controllers attach to the sides of the console using magnets (which are pretty darn strong), Hall sensor and TMR thumbsticks would likely be disrupted by the strong magnetic forces acting on them and likely wouldn't work as intended.\nHall Effect and TMR thumbsticks are immune to drift because they use small electromagnetic sensors, rather than physical resistors that wear down over time. These tiny magnets would no doubt face interference and calibration issues if they were put in a controller that literally attaches via an even stronger magnet right next to it, so it seems like Nintendo decided this way of joining its controllers to its console was a bigger priority than fixing arguably the biggest technical fault with its first Switch.\nIt'd be safe to assume that the Switch 2's Pro Controller will be a similar bag, especially since the brand seems so proud of its next-gen peripherals. Nate Bihldorff, Nintendo of America's Senior VP of Product Development & Publishing, told Nintendo Life back in April, \"Every time we put out a new hardware, whether it's a new system or an accessory, [Nintendo is] designing from the ground up to be the best possible experience for our consumers, whether it's the immediate effect of the Joy-Cons that you're playing, how they're interacting with the game, or durability.\n\"They take it and rebuild it so that we can give the best possible experience,\" he said.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nWhat will be really interesting to watch is the third-party support for Nintendo's new console. The officially licensed market was filled to the brim with Hall sensor options last generation to counter Nintendo's lack of durability. Should third-party peripheral makers be bound to using the console's magnetic rail attachments, I'll be keen to find out if they manage to find a workaround for Hall sensors without disruption.\nOnly time will tell if Nintendo's Joy-Con 2 controllers will suffer from the same drift as the first console did. For now, we're testing as many third-party Switch controllers as we can with the new console to see how compatibility lines up.\nKeep up with our thoughts on the latest console by checking out our Nintendo Switch 2 review in progress. You can also hear more about the Switch 2's Pro controller vs the original, and check out a full list of upcoming Switch 2 games.\nOne of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands. Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I\u2019ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "Best retro game consoles 2025: my favorite ways to play classic capers\nGreat ways to play retro games using modern tech\nI'm always on the hunt for the best retro consoles for playing old games, and there a plenty of modern ways to classic capers in 2025. I've tested everything from replica arcade machines that look like adorable versions of original cabinets to pocket size handhelds that handle everything from the Nintendo Entertainment System to the PS2, and some even look exactly like a Game Boy.\nBelieve it or not, I started playing games before I could speak, and I've held onto all the best retro consoles over the years. However, while old systems will always have a special place in my heart, there are now so many ways to play oldies in HD and using modern controllers, and some devices are even compatible with your original cartridges.\nRecently, I've been messing around with my GameCube setup since the Switch 2 will offer up the retro console's library to Nintendo Online members. I've also still got my N64 hooked up to a CRT and a SummerCart 64 Flash cart for playing Zelda ROM hacks in anticipation for the upcoming Analogue 3D and Modretro M64. I've even just started experimenting with a joystick that uses VR to create a virtual arcade within your house, but for now, I've got plenty of the best retro consoles for playing classic outings in 2025 below for your consideration.\nThe quick list\nBest budget console\nServing as one of the best modern handhelds period, the Super Pocket boasts is tremendously cheap and has access to a bunch of Evercade cartridges\nBest for arcade\nThis clever arcade cabinet by Blaze is compatible with a wealth of Evercade cartirdges, features authentic controls, and a gorgeous artwork.\nBest for Atari\nJust like the OG console, the 2600+ is compatible with original controllers and and cartridges, but swaps out old connectors for HDMI.\nBest for Nintendo\nMimicking the design of Nintendo's iconic 32-bit console, this mini version boasts built in classics, HDMI output, and controllers that feel just like the originals.\nBest for Sega\nThis tiny homage to the Genesis goes the extra mile to replicate Sega's '90s console while providing new USB controllers and HD output.\nBest for PS1\nWhile the PlayStation Classic got off to a rough start, homebrew enthusiasts have turned it into an ideal mini PS1 tribute with modern features.\nLoad more retro consoles \u2193\nBest microcomputer\nOut of all the tiny microcomputers out there, the Atari 400 Mini serves as the best way to experience the platform's hidden gems.\nPhil is a retro gaming expert who has covered old consoles for the BBC and sites like TechRadar in the past. These days, they review all the latest classic recreations, gadgets, and homages to old school hardware using over 30 years of experience. They also have an expansive collection of vintage consoles and a specific drawer for cursed handhelds.\nThe best budget retro console\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Super Pocket is one of the most affordable retro consoles out there, and it just so happens to also be a fantastic handheld. Not only does it have access to a wealth of Evercade cartridges, but it also comes in Capcom, Taito, Atari, and Technos flavors that boast built-in games. Not too shabby for under $60!\nJust like many other retro gaming handhelds out there, the Super Pocket takes queues from the Game Boy while wearing a look of its own. Rather than using a horizontal layout like it's Evercade siblings, this portable instead features a 2.8-inch IPS with a 4:3 aspect ratio, meaning it's more suited to NES, SNES, and Genesis classics. However, it's got a cheeky set of shoulder buttons round back, so there's nothing stopping you even playing PS1 romps like Tomb Raider and Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver.\nCompared to other Evercade devices, the Super Pocket is a little more bare bones. You'll be missing out on comforts like video output and a wider screen, but its simplicity makes it arguably more approachable. You'll still be able to mess around with visual settings like scanlines, shaders, and aspect ratios if those are your style, and you won't be stuck for ways to hear excellent chiptunes thanks to its 3.5mm headphone jack and built-in speakers. But, Blaze has otherwise created a handhel made for straight talking retro gaming that's free from updates, downloads, and general online shenanigans.\nAt this point, the Evercade's emulation performance has proven itself to be soild, and the same extends to the Super Pocket. Thanks to each cart having the emulators required baked in alongside the ROMs, you won't have to think about if you're using the right settings or hardware. Everything will simply run at full speed with the right sound, and the handheld's IPS screen does a great job helping pixels pop.\nIt's also worth pointing out that the Super Pocket's battery life is exceptional. I keep one in my travel bag for when my Steam Deck OLED has ran out of juice, and if I haven't used it in a while, I often find it's still ready to go. In straight up sessions, it'll last for about 5 hours too, which isn't bad considering its size.\nFor the money, the HyperMegaTech! Super Pocket is by far one of the best handhelds for easy retro gaming sessions. If you prefer to tinker with settings and squeeze extra performance out of your old games, you might want to check out emulation alternatives instead. Otherwise, this is a device that both travels well and provides excellent retro functionality at a low price.\nRead more: Super Pocket review\nThe best retro console for arcade games\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Evercade Alpha proves that at-home arcade machines don't have to just feature one or two games. In fact, Blaze's bartop system is actually a platform in itself, providing access to over 500 releases using cartridges.\nAt its core, the Alpha is an authentic arcade experience that comes armed with excellent button and stick microswitches paired with a sharp LCD display. Despite using modern tech, this Evercade machine manages to feel just as authentic as the real deal, even though it's much smaller than the original cabinet. Plus, you'll have plenty of modern connivences at your fingertips like wide USB controller support, punchy speakers, and effects that can make the screen feel like an old CRT.\nNaturally, Evercade cartridge support is a huge selling point since you'll have access to over 500 games. That's pretty remarkable considering alternative machines are usually limited to just a few themed classics, but you can technically even play 3D outings like Tomb Raider and Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver on this bad boy alongside countless retro capers.\nIf you're into authentic retro gadgets, the Alpha is absolutely going to win you over with its detailed art, light-up marquee, and smaller touches like light up coin slots. There's plenty of detail to be found with this cabinet that emulates the look of an actual system from back in the day, making for both an excellent way to play arcade romps and a collector's piece for your game room.\nEvercade emulation has proven itself time and time again to be robust, and the same applies to the Alpha's abilities. Every game I've tested runs at full speed with no hiccups, and the LCD screen provides vibrant visuals that don't spoil the retro aesthetic. The integrated controls are spot on too, with responsive clicky switches holding up against the best arcade controls in the business. Load times can be slightly slower than alternative means, but it's not noticeable enough to be a proper gripe.\nBy way of cartridges, the Evercade Alpha has solved one of the at-home arcade scene's biggest issues - game selection. This cabinet is pretty much a platform in its own right, and while it's missing HDMI output to make it a true living room solution, it's still a fantastic piece of kit that represents an arcade gaming gold standard.\nRead more: Evercade Alpha review\nThe best retro console for Atari games\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nPlenty of alternatives have arrived in the past, but the Atari 2600+ is one of the most authentic modern ways to play the system's back catalogue. It is effectively a smaller version of the OG system that runs the original cartridges, but trades that old RF cable for HDMI out.\nOne of the caveats to sticking with the original console's design is that for the most part, the Atari 2600+ doesn't boast many modern features. Instead, it runs cartridges just like the '70s system, with all the difficulty and stage options being changeable via four switches on top. That makes for a super authentic way to play your old collection using a modern gaming TV, but connivences like save states and visual effects are missed.\nRather than picking up the 2600+ features, you should do so based on its extremely authentic design. This console homage is pretty much an original Atari 2600 save for its HDMI port and illuminated front logo. Its beautiful woodgrain front panel and top ridges are just as iconic as the games it runs, and if you don't have the OG system, this one will serve the exact same purpose in your retro collection.\nI played a whole bunch of original games using the Atari 2600+, and while it's technically using emulation to achieve its goal, the results are pretty flawless. Sure, most modern toasters could probably run classics like Berzerk and Pac-Man, but for what it's worth, you're getting super accurate visuals and sound here with an HD resolution. The included joysticks and paddles also hold up compared to the originals, and if you happen to have other 9-pin retro gamepads lying around, those will work too.\nUltimately, the Atari 2600+ is for players looking for as authentic of an experience you can get while still using a modern screen. It would have been nice to have some modern perks like save states or effects, but many will argue that would defeat the point of this tribute system.\nAs a side note, there's now an Atari 7800+ that looks like the company's '80s system while boasting the same functionality. It's worth checking out if you either prefer the look of the NES competitor or find the idea of wireless gamepads appealing. However, it is almost the same device, so it's really just a case of choosing between styles.\nRead more: Atari 2600+ review\nThe best retro console for Nintendo games\n4. Super NES Classic\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWith the success of and overwhelming demand for the NES Mini Classic, a 16-bit follow up was virtually guaranteed. And here we are - once again, Nintendo has knocked it out of the park by providing a library of essential games inside a faithful, adorable replica of the original SNES.\nBesides being hugely nostalgic, these games represent some of the era's best; they're classics that changed the industry in fundamental ways. Whether it's Super Mario World or Street Fighter 2, these are games that inspired generations. They aren't museum pieces, either. The likes of Yoshi's Island, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, and Super Punch-Out! are still as engaging today as they were in the heyday of the SNES.\nThey're displayed at their very best here thanks to a suite of display options. These range from fuzzy CRT emulation to crisp HD output, rewind and suspend options, and a bucketful of the kind of fun Nintendo Easter eggs you'd expect from one of the best retro game consoles available. Even though the issue of controller cord length persists - it\u2019s longer, but still nowhere near long enough for living room setups - it\u2019s hard to imagine a more slickly packaged, densely concentrated dose of retro goodness.\nThat's true no matter which side of the Atlantic you're on. While US readers get the North American model with its sleek purple accents, UK fans are able to revisit their unique version with primary-colored buttons on the joypad. Perfection.\nPlay these first: Super Mario World | The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past | Super Metroid | Yoshi's Island | Secret of Mana | Earthbound\nRead more: SNES Mini hands-on\nThe best retro console for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games\n5. SEGA Genesis / Mega Drive Mini\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you're a SEGA fan from a time when Sonic had just arrived and the Biker Mice From Mars were still a thing on TV, you're in luck - the SEGA Genesis Mini (or Mega Drive if you're in the UK) is the best retro game console for you. From an adorably dinky console with a cartridge slot you can actually open for 'blowing away dust' to its authentic packaging, this is a system that excels at the little things. It even has original menu music by the 16-bit era legend Yuzo Koshiro, created using authentic tools of the day.\nThen there's bang-for-buck. Thanks to 42 all-time classic games (and bios on the significance of each one), the Genesis Mini offers better value for money than most. It's an excellently handled throwback to another time that'll hit you right in the nostalgic feels.\nPlay these first: Sonic The Hedgehog | Gunstar Heroes | Streets of Rage 2 | Mega Man: The Wily Wars | Castlevania: Bloodlines | Contra: Hard Corps\nRead more: SEGA Genesis Mini review\nThe best retro console for PlayStation games\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe PlayStation Classic was, to put it bluntly, a bit of a disappointment when it was first released. However, I've really warmed up to the mini PS1 in 2025 thanks to efforts by the modding community, as you can now play most games from Sony's back catalog and use a variety of USB controllers.\nIf nothing else, the PlayStation Classic is one of the best-looking mini plug-and-play consoles to release during the 2010s. It's effectively a replica that's 45% smaller than the OG system, but still boasts all the same details. From molded memory card slots to even the little slot on the back that'd accommodate your Action Replay adapter, the device plays complete visual homage to an iconic piece of '90s hardware.\nEven before you get to modding, the PlayStation Classic has some nice features to hand. You'll be able to use save-state slots in any game you choose to play, and there are even functions for swapping disks, which is incredibly handy for RPGs like Final Fantasy 7. On the hardware side of things, you'll benefit from a straight HDMI output from the console to your TV, delivering 720p visuals that help oldies look crisp compared to the originals.\nThe PlayStation Classic's built-in selection of games is a bit of a letdown, not to mention Sony shipped the console with PAL versions. That means they technically run slower since TVs in the region used to exclusively use 50Hz, and the world has since moved on from refresh rates below 60Hz.\nThankfully, there is a way to remedy this, as I recently modded my PS1 mini to unlock its true potential. Using custom firmware like Project Eris will let you run your own ROM backups on the device, use other USB controllers, and even emulate other systems if that's up your street. If you really don't like tinkering, you'll still be able to play outings like Grand Theft Auto, Metal Gear Solid, and Resident Evil using the stock software, but I know many of you will want to look into the mod just to play Crash and Spyro alone.\nTechnically, the PlayStation Classic is discontinued, but there's still an abundance of refurbished and second-hand stock at various retailers. Pair that with its new found modded abilities, and that's precisely why I still think it's the best modern way to play PS1 games, even if there are emulation devices that can pull off similar moves.\nRead more: PlayStation Classic review\nThe best retro console for microcomputer games\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOut of all the tiny microcomputer options out there, I'd argue the Atari 400 Mini (THE400 Mini) has the most to offer. Sure, if you have specific memories tied to something more popular like the C64 or ZX Spectrum, you'll want to look at options with those specific ports. But, if it's a general taste for that era of gaming you're after, this miniature replica more than has you covered.\nIt's safe to say that out of all the microcomputers, the Atari 400 is the one I see least. Therefore, being able to pick up a tiny version that features all the same design elements shrunken down into a plug and play is pretty appealing, and the level of detail that Retro Games Ltd has put into this mini console is remarkable. You won't be able to actually use is sculpted membrane keyboard or use actual cartridges, but it's still going to more than give you a reference for that the real deal looked like\nLooks aside, the Atari 400 Mini also has a bunch of modern comforts at its disposal that'll help you easily play a bunch of microcomputer classics using HDMI output. If you don't want to faff around with ROM backups, you'll be able to enjoy 25 built-in classics from the platform. However, it'll also happily run your own collection and even Atari 2600 games using its USB ports, which just so happen to support a bunch of different gamepads too.\nOn the software side of things, you'll have access to save states and a 30-second rewind mode, which may help you finally beat tricky games from 40 years ago. If you want to keep things ultra authentic, you can even boot into BASIC and do some programming, but you will need to supply your own keyboard.\nI've tested the Atari 400 Mini side by side with an original Atari 600XL, and the tiny console nails 8-bit emulation. I played a variety of capers including more obscure backups from my own library, and I wasn't able to sniff out any compatibility issues or visual quirks. The results are so accurate that I now reach for THE400 Mini to play outings like Caverns of Mars, Mountain King, and Turmoil rather than setup one of my OG microcomputers - probably the highest compliment I can give it.\nIf there's one thing I wish the Atari 400 Mini featured more of, it's probably physical features. Being able to interact more with things like the top cartridge bay or even use the membrane keyboard in some sort of way would have made it the perfect time capsule. That said, this is still one of the most authentic ways to play microcomputer games without the original hardware, and it's worth investing in as a piece of reference hardware.\nRead more: THE400 Mini review\nRetro console accessories worth checking out\nKaico Summercart64 (SC64) | View at Amazon\nFlash carts like the SC64 are designed to help you run ROMs on your original N64. I picked one up in 2025 to play the countless Zelda ROM hacks that fans have whipped up over the years, and if you wish Nintendo would make sequels to games like Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, you might want to invest in this gadget.\nRead more: Summercart64 hands-on\nEON XBHD | View at Amazon\nThis gadget connects directly into the back of your OG Xbox and transforms its output to HDMI, meaning you can easily hook it up to modern TVs and monitors. It'll also provide the console with additional network ports for playing LAN multiplayer games, making it well worth checking out for fans of Microsoft's first console.\nRead more: EON XBHD review\nOpen Source Scan Converter (OSSC) | View at Amazon\nThis is the upscaler I use for my retro consoles, and it's designed to multiply rows of pixels to enhance increase resolutions on modern screens using HDMI. It is plug and play if you use an RGB Scart cable, but there's also a wealth of different visual and technical settings built in for enthusiasts to play around with for specific systems.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nPhil is the Hardware Editor at GamesRadar and joined the team in 2023. In the past, they've also contributed to the likes of TechRadar, The Daily Star, the BBC, and PCGamesN, but these days, they specialize in testing the latest gaming handhelds, monitors, TVs, and PC components.

      "text": "GamesRadar+ Verdict\nThe 8Bitdo N64 Bluetooth Controller for Analogue 3D is a fantastic take on the original Nintendo 64 gamepad that blends authentic design with contemporary comfort. It connects effortlessly to the OG retro console via wireless adapters, and its hall effect joysticks and robust build quality will help you play games on Switch and Analogue's FPGA system for many years to come.\nPros\n- +\nFantastic build quality\n- +\nAuthentic N64 layout\n- +\nSwitch Pro controller levels of comfort\n- +\nCompatible with Switch 2, Android, and PC\n- +\nSensible price point\nCons\n- -\nYou'll need a wireless adapter to use it with the original N64\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nIt feels like I've been on a 27-year quest to find the best N64 controller, and thanks to 8bitdo, my journey might finally be over. Yes, the peripheral maker's new Bluetooth controller is specifically designed with the Analogue 3D in mind, but you don't need the FPGA retro console to get the most out of this new Nintendo 64 gamepad.\nPriced at $39.99 / \u00a334.99, the 8Bitdo N64 Bluetooth Controller for Analogue 3D isn't the only modern Nintendo 64 gamepad on the battlefield. Plenty of brands like Hyperkin, Retro-bit, and Retro Fighters have already tried to transform the original M-shaped monster into something more contemporary, and Hori even gave it a crack with its Japan-exclusive Mini Pad years prior.\nI know some of you retro purists out there would rather stick with the original Nintendo 64 gamepad, wonky thumbsticks and all. Trust me when I say I'd also rather use the OG pad than most third-party alternatives, but now that there's an option that blends Switch Pro controller sensibilities with a layout that caters directly to my N64 motor skills, I'm ready for something new.\nDesign\nOkay, let's address the elephant in the retro game room - this 8Bitdo controller looks nothing like the original N64 gamepad. The fact that it ditches the OG accessory's colorful buttons and contentious spaceship shape is going to turn off longstanding Nintendo 64 fans.\nAt a glance, you might even mistake this pad for the 8Bitdo Ultimate, but if you join me for a closer look, you'll start to realize that this is firmly an N64 controller. The big giveaway is the fact that there's only one thumbstick, but it's also got iconically large A and B buttons where the left stick would typically live in the modern era and a full set of directional 'C' buttons (Ninty's answer to camera controls).\nThe cherry on top is the extra-large \"start\" button in the centre of the pad, which feels wonderfully antiquated now that the old pause button has been virtually replaced by \"home\" and \"menu\" on virtually every new controller. Those toggles still exist at the very top of the accessory, largely to maintain some Nintendo Switch compatibility, but the controller absolutely prioritizes placing Nintendo's '90s layout at your thumbtips.\nAs someone who put hundreds of hours into N64 games before my frontal lobe had developed, this layout matters. Trying to use a modern pad when running through Zelda: Ocarina of Time or any of Ninty's other classics gets my thumbs in a twist, as I instinctively end up thumbling around for those larger face buttons.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nHowever, I fully believe that even if you didn't grow up with Nintendo's first 3D console, playing with the original layout makes for a much nicer experience. Mechanically speaking, these games were developed with the specific placement in mind, and many outings assume you'll have those big A and B buttons to hand. Plus, removing the redundant right stick means you won't be hoodwinked into thinking conventional camera controls are in the room with you.\nIn contrast to the authentic front buttons, the shoulder triggers and bumpers share little in common with the N64. That's primarily because the original featured a 'Z' button on the central prong, so moving it up to the top is logical. I also find that while my digits tend to reach for that old Nintendo layout, the fact that my index fingers are still within reach of the triggers means I personally very rarely get mixed up.\nBelieve it or not, I almost forgot to mention the d-pad, but there's a good reason for that. While some games like Mischief Makers and Pok\u00e9mon Stadium use it, a large chunk of the console's library pretends it doesn't exist. As such, it's easy to forget it's there after spending a few hours in 3D romps, but it is a pretty excellent cross-shaped pad that feels tactile and precise.\nIn fact, every button on this controller feels nice and snappy, but maintains a near-identical feel to the original N64 pad. I'd go as far as to say that it potentially even feels nicer since the membranes aren't nearly 30 years old, meaning you're sort of getting a fresh out-of-the-box '90s experience.\nAesthetically, you've got the Analogue 3D to thank for this pad's slick looks. It comes in while or black, matching the FPGA N64 console options. As much as I would have adored a version with vibrant hints of red, green, blue, and yellow, it perhaps doesn't make sense since the pad is for the revamped Nintendo 64 system.\nNot all is lost, though, as since the buttons are all seemingly exact replicas of the original, both in feel and size, there's a chance you could add them yourself via a mod. I can't verify if they actually fit yet, but I may end up tinkering with the inside of this pad soon just to satisfy my curiosity.\nUltimately, what you're getting here is a comfortable controller that holds onto the N64's button layout. I'm deeply passionate about using original hardware where possible, even if it does make your hands cramp up after a night playing Majora's Mask. But, I think I speak for even the biggest Nintendo 64 enthusiasts when I say getting to play in comfort using Switch Pro-style grips is something we've earned at this stage.\nFeatures\nIt's easy to take even simple modern controller elements like rumble for granted. Back when the N64 was a hot item, you'd have to buy additional add-ons just to add vibration to its gamepad, so it's safe to say the new 8Bitdo controller is worlds apart.\nSimply put, the 8Bitdo N64 gamepad boasts all the same features as a contemporary Pro controller. You've, of course, got rumble baked in, and while the company claims it'll only work on Analogue 3D, Switch consoles, and Android, I can confirm it kicks in when connected to the OG console via a wireless adapter. To my hands, it feels just as nice as the tech within my old Switch Pro controller, and it replicates even subtle effects without being obnoxious.\nIt's worth noting there is no 8Bitdo N64 wireless receiver (yet), and since this pad uses USB-C and Bluetooth for connectivity, hooking straight up to the Nintendo 64 with a cord isn't an option. However, I can confirm the controller works instantly with cheap adapters like the one by BlueRetro (around $5 at Aliexpress), and if you click the back toggle to Switch mode, it'll sync up near instantly.\nI'm hoping that 8Bitdo makes its own wireless receiver too, as it'd be neat to pick one up that can feed the controller a charge using USB-C. That said, keep in mind that this controller is officially designed to work with the Analogue 3D, Switch, and Android, so I can't hold any of this against the controller maker. The fact that it works at all is brilliant, and it makes it a legit option for the OG console in my book.\nIf you'd rather use this pad with a PC, you'll be pleased to hear it'll work just fine with your rig via Bluetooth or USB-C. You'll naturally have to map the buttons using Steam Input or another app, and you'll be missing that second joystick, but it'll still make for a great retro gamepad for your rig or DIY emulation machine.\nJust like with most other 8Bitdo controllers, this N64 pad also boasts hall-effect thumbsticks, and I'd say the tech's presence here is symbolic. Stick drift plagues even the newest controllers, but you could argue that the OG pad's gimbal joystick serves as an origin of sin. If you own the original console, chances are that your original stick is now wobbly, drifty, and practically unusable thanks to internal wear, something that should never happen with the new accessory.\nGranted, the original gamepad was flawed in a different way, so the symptoms aren't quite the same as you'll find with the Dualsense or Nintendo's Joy-Con. Nevertheless, by bothering to include hall-effect joysticks even with this niche N64 pad, 8Bitdo has ensured that even another 30 years from now, you'll be able to swing Bowser around like it's 1997. Even friction won't wear down the thumbstick's stalk when giving King Koopa a beatdown, as metal rings will stop the octagon gate from eating into the plastic.\nPerformance\nIt might be painfully apparent, but I'm pretty nerdy about retro gamepads. So much so that even the best PC controllers often miss the mark when paired with old games and consoles, so the 8Bitdo pad had its work cut out for it.\nDespite this, the Analogue 3D controller has managed to completely win me over after a gauntlet of tests. Understandably, most reviewers out there are going to be solely judging the accessory based on its FPGA console, Nintendo Switch, and Android abilities, but I also spent several hours using this pad with my childhood N64.\nBefore you get the wrong idea, I wasn't going to hold any N64 wireless connectivity flaws against the 8Bitdo controller. It'd be unfair to judge the pad based on how it connects to a cheap wireless receiver, so the fact that it works flawlessly earns it bonus points. I wasn't even able to sniff out any input lag, even when switching back and forth between the wired original and my makeshift setup.\nI actually modded one of my original N64 pads with a Hyperkin GameCube-style joystick back in 2017, and it used to be my default controller for the system. In many ways, I consider it the 8Bitdo gamepad's main rival for this specific review, and while I can't speak for the brand's newer hall-effect stick yet, the older version features a bit of a flaw that the Analogue 3D accessory can capitalize on.\nThis is perhaps more of an enthusiast-grade gripe, but thumbstick ranges can make all the difference when using third-party controllers. In the case of my original pad with a modded stick, its values are way wider, so much so that when using a test ROM on N64, the reading looks like a square rather than an octagon.\nIn contrast to this, the 8Bitdo N64 controller maintains a much shorter range, resulting in a reading that's closer to an OEM pad. It's still not like-for-like, but it does mean aiming in shooters like Goldeneye will feel a bit more precise. Admittedly, the different-shaped reading is, in part, due to the gate size on each controller, but the reduced sensitivity paired with shorter travel will result in smoother movement.\nIn addition, dead zones are less of an issue with the 8Bitdo N64 controller, whereas my modded controller features a slight center movement delay. Again, this is something that can affect subtle movements, and trust me when I say it's a pain lining up Mr Brosnan's reticule to take a potshot at some goons. Therefore, I'm thrilled the new pad dodges the issue.\nThat's not to say other options like the Hyperkin GameCube-Style joystick mod are inherently bad, and honestly, you won't notice if playing games like Super Smash Bros. But, when it comes to trying to find a replacement that trades out the original mechanical stick and optical sensors for something new, the 8Bitdo's accuracy matters.\nIt's worth remembering that this controller isn't just for the N64. It's equally supposed to be a slightly more versatile Switch gamepad, serving as a way to play Expansion Pack games and even Super Mario Kart World. Naturally, you'll be limited to outings that don't need a secondary stick, but it feels fantastic for racing and playing pre-N64 NES, SNES, and Mega Drive capers. You've partly got a D-pad to thank for that since it actually gets to shine in handling games better suited to its design.\nThroughout my testing, I've been keeping tabs on the 8Bitdo N64 controller's battery life, and it has held up extremely well. I've already spent countless hours jumping into my physical collection to test the pad's feel and using it as a secondary Switch pad, and it's still going after 20 hours of use. I suspect it boasts pretty similar stamina to the Ultimate 2, and the longer runtime is especially handy if you're using an OG Nintendo 64 without immediate access to charging cables.\nAll my technical testing aside, I want to talk about using this controller as a longtime N64 fan. I don't want to get all mushy, but this 8Bitdo gamepad has reignited my love for the OG console, and it resulted in my spending my whole weekend surrounded by carts like it was the '90s again.\nThat's not to say I won't pick up my original N64 controller ever again, but when you've spent hours playing Donkey Kong Bananza using a Switch Pro gamepad, it feels phenomenal grabbing something just as comfortable to revisit Donkey Kong 64. The key here is that the pad doesn't disrupt the place where my thumbs have been trained to land for years, since it uses that old layout, and that's more than enough to justify replacing all my favorites for the millionth time using this new gamepad.\nShould you pick up the 8Bitdo N64 Bluetooth Controller for Analogue 3D?\nThe 8Bitdo N64 controller is designed to pair with a $250 FPGA console, but it also happens to be one of the best modern gamepads for Nintendo 64 I've tested. If you've still got the OG system, this pad will furnish your old setup with a super authentic button layout, Switch Pro controller-levels of comfort, and hall-effect joysticks that erradicate the blight of wobbly controls.\nYou will need to grab your own Bluetooth adapter for N64, but even the cheapest options will turn this 8Bitdo controller into a worthy wireless gamepad. That said, even if you're simply looking to tap into Nintendo 64 Expansion Pack games on Switch, this accessory is going to provide you with the right controls to embark on early 3D outings.\nIf this controller is anything to go by, then I suspect we'll be in for something special when the Analogue 3D arrives on the scene. I'm not entirely sure if I'll have access to the new 4K FPGA console, and I certainly can't afford to splash out $250 on one. However, I can at least get a taste of what it'll physically feel like to play old carts on the new hardware, and for under $40, you can do the same.\nHow I tested the 8Bitdo N64 Bluetooth Controller for Analogue 3D\nOver five days, I used the 8Bitdo N64 Bluetooth Controller to play original Nintendo 64 games and Switch 2. During testing, I compared the gamepad's build quality and functionality to existing modern options and Ninty's OG controller to see if it strikes a balance between contemporary features and accurate controls when playing through the retro console's library.\nOn Switch, I used Mario Kart World and Nintendo 64 Online games like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time to test the 8Bitdo pad. However, I also used a large chunk of my testing time using an original N64 console and a wireless Bluetooth adapter, using the likes of 007: Goldeneye, Donkey Kong 64, and Mischief Makers to qualitatively assess feel and accuracy. In addition to this, I also used controller testing ROMs like Neo Compo 2012 to check thumbstick input ranges to see how they compare to the console's OEM pad.\nFor more information on how we test controllers, retro consoles, and accessories, check out our full GamesRadar+ Hardware Policy.\nLooking for more pads?

  "argos_summary": "The article explains how N64 controllers suffer from severe stick drift and describes a simple, solderless mod that replaces the mechanical thumbstick with a Hall\u2011effect sensor module from Hyperkin. It details the disassembly steps, compares performance benchmarks to the original and 8Bitdo controllers, and notes potential drawbacks such as preference for original hardware. The mod offers a quick, low\u2011cost fix that restores accurate controls while preserving the classic controller design.",
