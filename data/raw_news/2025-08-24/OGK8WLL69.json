  "description": "Ether rose to a new record over the weekend, after hitting an all-time high Friday for the first time since 2021.",
  "content": "Ether rose to a new record over the weekend, after hitting an all-time high Friday for the first time since 2021. The price of the second largest cryptocurrency rose as high as $4,954.81 on Sunday afternoon. It was last higher by less than 1% at $4,776.46. Meanwhile, bitcoin at one point erased all the gains from its Friday rally, falling as low as $110,779.01, its lowest level since July 10. It was last trading lower by nearly 2% at about $112,000. The flagship cryptocurrency hit its most recent record of $124,496 on Aug. 13.\n\nOn Friday, crypto rocketed with the broader market after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at upcoming rate cuts and investors returned to risk-on mode. Ether surged 15% and bitcoin gained 4%. Ether, rather than bitcoin, has been leading the crypto marker for several weeks thanks to regulatory tailwinds, a boom in interest in stablecoins and buying en masse by a new cohort of corporate ether accumulators. On Saturday, Bitmine Immersion Technologies , the ether treasury company chaired by Wall Street bull Tom Lee, bought $45 million of ether, according to crypto data provider Arkham. That shift in leadership has helped sustain ETH, which has sustained the $4,000 level this month after unsuccessfully testing the resistance mark a handful of times since 2021. \"The buyers are finally bigger than the sellers,\" said Ben Kurland, CEO at crypto research platform DYOR. \"ETH ETFs are drawing steady inflows, and public companies are beginning to treat ETH as a treasury asset they can stake for yield \u2014 a stickier form of demand than retail speculation.\" \"Additionally, nearly a third of supply is locked in staking, scaling solutions are mature and, with rate cuts back on the table, the cost of capital is falling,\" he added. \"Those forces turned $4,000 from a resistance level into a foundation for re-pricing ETH's next chapter.\"",

      "text": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday gave a tepid indication of possible interest rate cuts ahead as he noted a high level of uncertainty that is making the job difficult for monetary policymakers.\nIn his much-anticipated speech at the Fed's annual conclave in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the central bank leader in prepared remarks cited \"sweeping changes\" in tax, trade and immigration policies. The result is that \"the balance of risks appear to be shifting\" between the Fed's twin goals of full employment and stable prices.\nWhile he noted that the labor market remains in good shape and the economy has shown \"resilience,\" he said downside dangers are rising. At the same time, he said tariffs are causing risks that inflation could rise again \u2014 a stagflation scenario that the Fed needs to avoid.\nWith the Fed's benchmark interest rate a full percentage point below where it was when Powell delivered his keynote a year ago, and the unemployment rate still low, conditions allow \"us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance,\" Powell said.\n\"Nonetheless, with policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,\" he added.\nThat was as close as he came during the speech to endorsing a rate cut that Wall Street widely believes is coming when the Federal Open Market Committee next meets Sept. 16-17.\nHowever, the remarks were enough to send stocks soaring and Treasury yields tumbling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average showed a gain of more than 600 points following the public release of Powell's speech while the policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury note saw a 0.08 percentage point fall to around 3.71%.\nIn addition to market expectations, President Donald Trump has demanded aggressive cuts from the Fed in scathing public attacks he has lobbed at Powell and his colleagues.\nThe Fed has held its benchmark borrowing rate in a range between 4.25%-4.5% since December. Policymakers have continued to cite the uncertain impact that tariffs will have on inflation as a reason for caution and believe that current economic conditions and the slightly restrictive policy stance allow for time to make further decisions.\nImportance of Fed independence\nWhile not addressing the White House demands for lower rates specifically, Powell did note the importance of Fed independence.\n\"FOMC members will make these decisions, based solely on their assessment of the data and its implications for the economic outlook and the balance of risks. We will never deviate from that approach,\" he said.\nThe speech comes amid ongoing negotiations between the White House and its global trading partners, a situation often in flux and without clarity on where it will end. Recent indicators show consumer prices gradually pushing higher but wholesale costs up more rapidly.\nFrom the Trump administration's view, the tariffs will not cause lasting inflation, thus warranting rate cuts. Powell's position in the speech was that a range of outcomes is possible, with a \"reasonable base case\" being that the tariff impacts will be \"short lived \u2014 a one-time shift in the price level\" that likely would not be cause for holding rates higher. However, he said nothing is certain at this point.\n\"It will continue to take time for tariff increases to work their way through supply chains and distribution networks,\" Powell said. \"Moreover, tariff rates continue to evolve, potentially prolonging the adjustment process.\"\nIn addition to summarizing the current conditions and potential outcomes, the speech touched on the Fed's five-year review of its policy framework. The review resulted in several notable changes from when the central bank last performed the task in 2020.\nAt that time, in the midst of the Covid pandemic, the Fed switched to a \"flexible average inflation targeting\" regime that effectively would allow inflation to run higher than the central bank's 2% goal coming after a prolonged period of holding below that level. The upshot is that policymakers could be patient with slightly higher inflation if it meant insuring a more comprehensive labor market recovery.\nHowever, shortly after adopting the strategy, inflation began to climb, ultimately hitting 40-year highs, while policymakers largely dismissed the rise as \"transitory\" and not needing rate hikes. Powell noted the damaging impacts from the inflation and the lessons learned.\n\"As it turned out, the idea of an intentional, moderate inflation overshoot had proved irrelevant. There was nothing intentional or moderate about the inflation that arrived a few months after we announced our 2020 changes to the consensus statement, as I acknowledged publicly in 2021,\" Powell said. \"The past five years have been a painful reminder of the hardship that high inflation imposes, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of necessities.\"\nAlso during the review, the Fed reaffirmed its commitment to its 2% inflation target. There have been critics on both sides of the issue, with some suggesting the rate is too high and can lead to a weaker dollar, while others seeing a need for the central bank to be flexible.\n\"We believe that our commitment to this target is a key factor helping keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored,\" Powell said."

      "text": "Bitcoin hit a new record late Wednesday as ether climbed even closer to its all-time high.\nThe flagship cryptocurrency rose as high as $124,496, surpassing its July record of 123,193.63, according to Coin Metrics. Ether rose to $4,791.19 overnight, edging closer to its 2021 record of $4,866.01.\nBoth coins took a hit Thursday, however, after July's wholesale inflation data came in much hotter than expected. Bitcoin was lower by 3.7% at $118,045.99 while ether fell 4.1% to $4,532.27.\nThe initial gains were sparked by Tuesday's cooler-than-expected July inflation report, which had lifted investor optimism for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve at the end of its September policy meeting. The coins rallied with the stock market for two days. On Wednesday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also scaled new records.\nAdding to the choppy moves Thursday were comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said late afternoon in a social media post that bitcoin forfeited to the federal government would be used to form the strategic bitcoin reserve President Donald Trump established back in March.\nBessent added that the U.S. Treasury will explore \"budget-neutral pathways to acquire more Bitcoin to expand the reserve.\"\nFor the week, bitcoin is on pace for a 1% gain, while ether has rallied 12%. Ether flipped bitcoin as the crypto market leader in June, gaining 85% since then thanks to heavy institutional buying, tightening supply and adoption from corporate accumulators \u2013 all under the backdrop of a friendlier regulatory environment for the crypto industry. Jake Kennis, analyst at Nansen, said the rally likely has more room to run given the flows remain strong.\n\"Bitcoin hitting a fresh all time high and ETH being on the verge of doing so means we've moved from speculative mania to a phase where institutional adoption, real-world integration, and global liquidity are driving price discovery,\" said Ben Kurland, CEO at crypto research and trading platform DYOR.\n\"The fact that both assets are on the verge of breaking records in tandem signals broad market conviction, not just a single-asset rally,\" he added. \"Momentum this strong rarely burns out instantly, but it also tends to draw in latecomers who can fuel volatility. Right now the story is less about euphoria and more about validation. Crypto is graduating from 'alternative' to 'essential' in the global portfolio mix.\""

      "text": "The crypto market this week cheered as President Donald Trump signed an executive order meant to open retirement plans to alternative assets including cryptocurrencies. The move from the White House has the potential to be a game changer for the adoption of digital assets. It could help turn them into mainstays of the U.S. financial market by expanding access and encouraging longer-term investing in crypto. Bitcoin , which has been riding a big wave of institutional acceptance and adoption since last year's debut of U.S. bitcoin ETFs , could one day become more established within financial services. It probably won't happen soon based on the White House's greenlight alone. It's even more unlikely investors will be directing BONK , Pudgy Penguins or other meme coins to their retirement accounts. \"On the surface, it's exciting to see digital assets getting presidential-level attention,\" said Doug Boneparth, certified financial planner and founder of Bone Fide Wealth. \"It signals continued legitimization of the space and shows how far we've come since bitcoin was just an internet curiosity. But the reality is a lot more nuanced.\" Employer adoption is key First of all, under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (better known as ERISA), major changes to investment menus require thoughtful guidance and buy-in from plan sponsors \u2013 especially if they involve volatile and still-maturing asset classes like crypto, Boneparth noted. For example, Fidelity in 2022 became the first retirement plan provider to give savers the option of putting bitcoin in their 401(k)s. However, employers must be willing to adopt the offering in the first place. That \"came down to employers' risk tolerance and fiduciary responsibility. That's not changing overnight with an [executive order],\" Boneparth said. Employers' fiduciary duty requires them to comply with ERISA and to run the plan in the best interest of the participants and beneficiaries. Further, too many investment options can be a barrier to participation, said Preston Cherry, CFP and founder of Concurrent Financial Planning. While increased access to crypto may be a plus, \"people become overwhelmed with the investment menu options\" which leads to a \"lack of participation,\" he said. Even when there is education available on these investment options, employees have to elect to receive it \u2014 and those participation rates are typically low, Cherry added. Combine those considerations with high-risk assets, and employers' fiduciary responsibility has to kick in. \"What happens with all the other altcoins?\" Cherry said, separating out bitcoin, ether and the Solana token. \"There should be oversight on that from the investment committee or plan sponsor overseeing what digital currencies actually get accepted and should for sure be educating on it.\" \"There's potential upside in digital currencies, but a lot of folks can't understand 30%, 40%, 50% drawdowns \u2013 and it could be destructive,\" he added. \"I'm not saying don't invest in crypto, but be crypto cautious.\" It depends on recordkeepers and 401(k) plan providers The retirement market had $43 trillion in assets in the first quarter, almost $9 trillion of which was held in 401(k) plans, according to the Investment Company Institute. The crypto market cap is nearly $4 trillion today. The executive order is the latest in a series of efforts under the Trump administration to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\" In July, he signed stablecoin legislation known as the GENIUS Act into the first official U.S. crypto law . The Securities and Exchange Commission recently debuted \" Project Crypto ,\" an initiative to modernize securities regulations to allow for crypto-based trading. \"The plan providers, the third-party providers, the recordkeepers, are going to decide the end result here, if they want to put crypto in or not,\" said Tyrone Ross, CEO of registered investment advisor 401 Financial. \"This is part of this administration's goal to make crypto the epicenter of the world and to have it grow here,\" he added. \"They're all-in, but the Fidelities of the world, the Schwabs, the MassMutuals, the Vanguards of the world \u2013 I don't know if they're just going to go, 'OK, we're going to do it.'\" Boneparth echoed that the order is more \"more symbolic than structural right now.\" However, this shouldn't diminish the significance of Washington's blessing of the crypto industry. Further, an education opportunity has just opened up in the retirement sector. \"As someone who believes in the long-term role of bitcoin in a diversified portfolio, I'm hopeful,\" Boneparth said. \"But as a fiduciary, I know our job is to help clients weigh the opportunity and the risk.\" \"If we do this right, the door opens a little wider to the future of retirement investing,\" he said. \"If we don't? Well then, who knows what meme coin we're going to see on a retirement plan statement.\""

      "text": "Companies that stock up on cryptocurrency as treasury assets became central players in the crypto market earlier this summer as investors chased returns during a bitcoin price slump . However, the rally for shares of certain names in the space has cooled dramatically in August. A catalyst awaits in the form of the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole economic symposium this week: Depending on the central bank's messaging, some of these stocks could resume their upward trajectory if the market's appetite for risk returns. CNBC took a look at the winners and losers from this sector this month, as well as since they adopted their crypto accumulation strategy. We also analyzed what sets the biggest gainers apart from the rest and what potential investors should consider from this group. The data below is current as of Aug. 19. To be sure, the short-term comparison is deceptive because each of the companies announced their crypto treasury focus at different points on the calendar. Ethzilla , for example, did so most recently on July 29, and the initial rush into the stock carried into the beginning of August. The shares have the highest month-to-date return of the group at about 114%. Ether -focused BitMine Immersion Technologies has the second biggest gain this month so far, followed by Solana holding company DeFi Development Corp . Here's how the other names have fared: Support from notable backers Companies with high-profile backers like Fundstrat Global Advisors' Tom Lee and tech billionaire Peter Thiel are holding up better. Lee became the chairman of BitMine Immersion in late June, shortly before Thiel disclosed a 9% stake in the company . Thiel later bought a 7.5% stake in Ethzilla, formerly a biotech company called 180 Life Sciences. \"Large names extend their reputation to the vehicle and instill confidence that the backers of these assets \u2014 alongside executives and board members with legal ties \u2014 will operate them as real businesses, growing revenue while managing risks,\" said Michael Bucella, co-founder and managing partner at Neoclassic Capital. \"That investor confidence creates momentum and market depth, which fuels volume and options activity,\" he added. \"This in turn enables these companies to establish sizable ATM programs, raising large sums of capital to acquire more of the asset and gain greater prominence in its ecosystem.\" Steve Kurz, global head of asset management at Galaxy Digital, which has backed big deals like SharpLink Gaming and ReserveOne (which is expected to begin trading at the end of the year), emphasized the importance of quality management teams not just when picking stocks but also when assessing how long the sector's momentum can last. \"Those that raise more capital with the right partners, with the right business model, with the right management teams have a much better shot of achieving some escape velocity with their ultimate treasury management companies, which also can become ecosystem companies that are bigger than just the immediate launch moment,\" he said. The ether connection Companies focused on ether versus other cryptocurrencies \u2014 including bitcoin \u2014 have fared better overall. That's due to the successful initial public offering of stablecoin issuer Circle , the passage of the stablecoin regulatory framework known as the GENIUS Act, and the subsequent explosion of institutional interest in stablecoins \u2013 most of which run on the Ethereum network. Strategy , which famously pioneered the original bitcoin treasury strategy in 2020, is down about 16% this month. A little-known Canadian vape company called CEA Industries saw shares surge about 550% on July 28 after it joined the Strategy copycat club, with a focus on accumulating Binance Coin . It's down 28% this month. Solana-focused DeFi Development is seeing more success, however. It's up about 2,600% since its April 7 accumulation announcement \u2013 nearly as much as Strategy's return since its June 2020 pivot. For the month, it's still up 8%. Bit Digital is now an ether accumulator, having exited bitcoin mining in June to focus on its ether treasury and staking plans. However, it has seen less success with shares up 11% since the company's announcement and a 6.5% decline this month. \u2014CNBC's Chris Hayes and Tom Rotunno contributed reporting."

      "text": "Institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies has been trouncing the macroeconomic narrative as the main performance driver for the past two months. Now investors should look for a reversal of that dynamic over the coming month, however. Ether stole the spotlight from bitcoin in July, roaring ahead more than 49% in the month, but bitcoin still managed an 8% gain and climbed to a new all-time high at mid-month. The price action in both coins was largely supported by inflows into ETFs \u2013 a steady stream of new investment dollars that continued in bitcoin ETFs and was coupled with a sudden explosion of flows into ether funds \u2013 as well as the new crop of crypto treasury companies focused on accumulating the coins. But after the broad sell-off in stocks and rally in bonds on Friday , following weak jobs data and President Donald Trump's new tariffs ranging between 10% and 41% , investors expect crypto to pull back in August with traders likely to dump their more highly speculative and volatile assets. \"Bitcoin is caught between ETF-driven optimism and uncertainty around global trade tensions,\" said Ray Youssef, CEO of crypto app NoOnes. \"It remains the risk benchmark, but it may trade in a tighter range unless a new macro catalyst emerges, such as another unexpected rate move or geopolitical shift \u2026 I expect August to be relatively muted in terms of price volatility, but deceptively active in terms of positioning.\" ETH.CM= BTC.CM= mountain 2025-07-01 Ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC) since July 1 Given how hot cryptocurrencies and stocks were in the second quarter, some investors see any pullback as a healthy and strategic cooldown rather than a reaction to a crisis. Especially in what has historically proven a weak trading month for many markets. Among crypto-related stocks, Coinbase gained 27% in the past two months, Galaxy Digital jumped 45%, and the bitcoin miner Iren surged 76%. As part of a rotation from bitcoin to ether-focused plays, ether treasury company Bitmine Immersion soared 136% and stablecoin stock Circle surged more than 400%. \"Near term, I think bitcoin stays range-bound unless we get a big macro shift,\" Pauline Shangett, chief strategy officer at crypto exchange ChangeNOW, told CNBC. \"ETH has more momentum thanks to ETF demand and whale activity , which could help it hold up better even in a choppy market,\" she said, referring to ether, and large investors who hold large positions in a particular asset. Ether ETFs saw more than $5 billion in inflows in July alone, bringing its total inflows to $9.64 to date. Bitcoin ETFs saw monthly inflows of about $6 billion in July, out of a cumulative $55 billion since their introduction. \"We are taking advantage of this consolidation and playing for this highly compelling setup to reaccelerate and break out,\" Read Harvey, technical analyst at Wolfe Research, said in a note Wednesday. \"For now, we're buyers of pullbacks in the space and expect reaccelerations in coming weeks, a development that should lead to further crypto outperformance vs. equities.\" Youssef at NoOnes expects bitcoin to trade between $114,000 and $120,000 for most of August, and find buying support whenever it trades between $103,000 and $109,000. If ether can hold above $3,750 per coin, bulls could push for a retest of $4,000 \u2013 a challenging psychological and technical level for traders since the 2021 bull market \u2013 with support between $3,200 and $2,900, according to Youssef. \"The real wildcard is the September Fed meeting,\" Youssef said. \"[Chair] Jerome Powell's remarks often create sharp, short-term volatility, and with geopolitical tensions rising, we could see sudden shifts in sentiment. Still, unless macro conditions deteriorate significantly, both BTC and ETH appear to be building momentum beneath the surface.\" \u2014CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

  "argos_summary": "Ether surged to a new all\u2011time high of nearly $4,955 after Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled possible rate cuts, while Bitcoin also reached record levels, spurred by a broader risk\u2011on rally and institutional buying.  Regulatory tailwinds, stablecoin growth, and corporate treasury accumulation\u2014highlighted by Bitmine Immersion\u2019s $45\u202fmillion purchase\u2014have underpinned ETH\u2019s dominance over Bitcoin for weeks.  Trump\u2019s executive order to allow retirement plans to hold crypto and the SEC\u2019s Project Crypto are expanding institutional access, though adoption remains cautious due to fiduciary concerns and market volatility.  Together, these developments signal a shift from speculative hype to a more institutional, \u201cessential\u201d role for crypto in global portfolios, even as traders anticipate potential pullbacks amid macro\u2011economic uncertainty.",
