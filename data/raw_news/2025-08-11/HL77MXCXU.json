  "description": "New research shows that even frequent dollar store customers are still getting most of their calories elsewhere.",
  "content": "Some good news for bargain hunters out there: New research shows that while the food bought at dollar stores is generally less healthy, customers\u2019 diets aren\u2019t suffering greatly as a result.\n\nScientists at Tufts University and the USDA-Economic Research Service collaborated for the study, which tracked the food purchasing habits of nearly 200,000 American families. They found that a growing number of people are buying food from dollar stores, particularly people with lower incomes. At the same time, the overall diet quality wasn\u2019t significantly different between those who shop and don\u2019t shop at these outlets.\n\nDollar stores have become a ubiquitous presence across the U.S. over the past few decades. Research has shown how these stores have reshaped the local economy, particularly in small towns. For the new study, the researchers wanted to get a better sense of how they\u2019ve changed our diets.\n\nTo that end, they analyzed yearly data from a nationally representative sample of Americans\u2019 household food purchases. They also used USDA data to rate the quality of people\u2019s store-bought food.\n\nAccording to the study, dollar store foods made up 3.4% of a household\u2019s total calories in 2008, nearly doubling to 6.5% by 2020. People of color, people living in rural neighborhoods, and those with lower incomes were more likely to buy foods from dollar stores.\n\nAs other research shows, dollar store food purchases are less healthy than food bought elsewhere. These stores are less likely to carry fresh produce, for example, and more likely to have sweets, snacks, and other processed foods. But strangely enough, the quality of people\u2019s diets didn\u2019t shift much regardless of whether they ate dollar store food.\n\nPeople who reported never buying foods at dollar stores had a healthy eating score of 50.5, for instance, whereas people who most shopped at these stores had a score of 46.3 (the scale goes to 100). On average, even the most frequent dollar store customers still got more than 90% of their at-home calories from somewhere else.\n\nThe findings suggest that the impact of these stores on Americans\u2019 health is more complicated than assumed, the researchers say. People who shop at these stores seem to be changing their food-buying behavior in other ways. \u201cAlthough foods purchased in dollar stores are less healthy, households may compensate through healthier purchases elsewhere,\u201d they wrote in their paper, published Monday in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\n\nThe researchers note that some towns and neighborhoods have taken action to limit the growth of these stores. But given their findings, they argue that more study is needed to understand exactly how these businesses are shaping people\u2019s eating habits.\n\n\u201cWe need more data on the real effects of dollar stores on healthy eating as some communities may be putting the policy cart before the horse,\u201d said senior study researcher Sean Cash, an economist at Tufts\u2019 Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, in a statement from the university.",

      "text": "Morgan, Minnesota, a city of about 800 people, has two restaurants, several churches, a grain elevator and one small grocery store that sells rib-eye steaks that, according to the mayor, \u201care the best around.\u201d\nThe mayor, Jerry Huiras, 76, is protective of the lone grocery, a family business that dates back many generations and operates in a downtown dotted with empty storefronts. So when he got wind in late 2020 that Dollar General was planning to open a store near the town limits, and that this fast-growing national discount chain was known for undercutting local grocers with its low prices, Huiras vowed to prevent that outcome in Morgan.\nArmed with a petition signed by more than 100 people, Huiras was direct in addressing the developer seeking zoning approval to build the Dollar General. \u201cWe just don\u2019t want your store,\u201d Huiras, a Republican, recalled telling him.\nMorgan is part of a movement of municipalities across the United States that have pushed back against the dollar store industry\u2019s rapid growth during the pandemic.\nSince 2019, at least 75 communities have voted down proposed dollar stores, while roughly 50 have enacted moratoriums or other broad limits on dollar store development, according to a new report by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, an organization that is critical of corporate retailers and their impact on communities.\nBy comparison, from 2015 to 2018, about 25 communities voted down proposed dollar stores while only six enacted moratoriums or ordinances limiting their growth.\nAlthough the number of blocked stores is much smaller than the thousands that Dollar General and similar chains have opened in recent years, the movement against the industry has created an unusual group of allies. On many other issues, they disagree, but they are united in their fight against dollar stores.\nRural, Republican-leaning communities in places like southern Virginia and North Carolina are pushing back against dollar stores. (In 2020, President Donald Trump easily carried Morgan.) And leaders in cities like Toledo, Ohio, and Birmingham, Alabama, have also mounted opposition, saying the stores are fueling crime and unhealthy food choices. Across Georgia, 18 cities and towns have restricted dollar store development, according to the think tank\u2019s report.\nThe stores typically operate with lean staffing, and their employees, by some measures, are paid at the bottom of the retail industry\u2019s scale. According to a survey by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, 92% of Dollar General workers earn less than $15 an hour, lower than many other companies surveyed, including Burger King, Walmart and Dunkin\u2019. About 20% of Dollar General workers earn less than $10 an hour.\nAt the same time, the company is highly profitable. In December, Dollar General said its quarterly operating profit had increased about 10% from a year earlier while net sales had increased 11%, to $9.5 billion. Dollar Tree, which also owns the Family Dollar chain, is posting strong results as well. On Wednesday, Dollar Tree said its profit in fiscal year 2022 increased 23% to $2.2 billion and net sales rose 7.6% to $28.3 billion.\nMore than one-third of all stores that opened in the United States in 2021 and 2022 were dollar stores. Dollar General alone opened 2,060 locations during those years, far more than any other retailer, according to Coresight Research, and the company now operates 19,000, more than twice as many as Walmart and Target combined.\n\u201cAs divided as Americans are politically, there\u2019s remarkable agreement that too much of what passes as a legitimate business model is, in fact, fundamentally destructive and unfair,\u201d said Stacy Mitchell, a co-executive director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. \u201cFederal policymakers have let big corporations run amok. Cities and towns of all stripes have learned that if you want to protect your community, you have to do it yourself.\u201d\nDollar General said it was often filling a void in parts of the country where many retailers did not operate. The company said that 75% of its stores were in towns with fewer than 20,000 people, and that it had been significantly increasing the number of its stores that sell produce.\n\u201cWe believe the passage of moratoria harm customers who depend on us to help them stretch their budgets, particularly in inflationary times,\u201d Dollar General said in a statement.\nDollar Tree said its stores had helped alleviate \u201cfood deserts\u201d and revitalize struggling strip malls by providing an affordable and convenient place to shop.\n\u201dWe often take over vacant space in neighborhoods and areas that are already challenged, keeping centers and other adjacent businesses open and serving communities, especially those that are underserved,\u201d Dollar Tree said in a statement. When Lorraine Cochran-Johnson was first running for a seat as a county commissioner in DeKalb County, Georgia, in 2018, dollar stores were not something she paid attention to. But after a woman at a campaign event warned her about the stores\u2019 impact on Black neighborhoods, she began to do some research online and by simply looking around her district, just east of Atlanta.\nThe stores were mostly in predominantly Black neighborhoods. She also witnessed, over a two-week span, two brazen thefts at the same dollar store.\nShe talked with one of the cashiers about the crimes. \u201cShe told me, \u2018This is business as usual,\u2019\u201d Cochran-Johnson said. \u201cThere was a normalcy to this situation that no one should find normal.\u201d\nCochran-Johnson, a Democrat, was elected to the commission in 2019. The next year, she persuaded the commission to pass a moratorium on dollar store developments in DeKalb County.\nThe moratorium ended in December, but the county is putting into effect new requirements for dollar stores, including that they install video surveillance in their stores and parking lots and turn over security camera footage to the police within 72 hours of a crime. A new store cannot be within a mile of an existing store, and 10% of a store\u2019s shelf space must be dedicated to \u201chealthy foods,\u201d a category that includes frozen vegetables.\n\u201cThis is about community and creating the best outcomes,\u201d Cochran-Johnson said.\nIn its statement, Dollar General said, \u201cWe appreciate the positive and ongoing conversations with the county commissioners on ways we can continue to invest in, and provide access to, affordable, everyday essentials, including produce, to DeKalb County residents.\u201d\nRegarding the issue of crime, Dollar Tree said, \u201cWe continually invest in deploying proven crime-reduction technologies in stores located in higher-crime areas and use risk-based analysis and tactics to reduce incidents in our stores.\u201d The company added that it turned over surveillance footage whenever law enforcement requested it.\nThe opposition to dollar stores is reminiscent of the pushback against Walmart\u2019s expansion in the 1990s and 2000s and the concern that the giant retailer would wipe out small, Main Street stores. But the anti-Walmart campaigns were concentrated in the Northwest and on the West Coast. And some of the criticism of the company was stoked, in part, by labor unions, which were trying to pressure the fiercely nonunion retailer.\nWalmart\u2019s growth set the stage for the dollar stores\u2019 business model. Walmart hurt small retailers that couldn\u2019t compete with its low prices and huge scale, and the company was criticized for hollowing out local retail corridors.\nBut there was a limit to Walmart\u2019s physical growth. Its large-format stores, designed essentially as regional shopping hubs, are not suited to every community, whereas dollar stores have smaller footprints that require less land and fewer infrastructure improvements.\nMitchell said that antitrust enforcers had failed to act against Walmart but that the Institute for Local Self-Reliance was urging the Biden administration to start reining in the dollar store industry, which has powerful leverage with suppliers that impedes smaller retailers\u2019 ability to compete.\nThe dollar stores\u2019 growth shows no signs of abating. With inflation still high, discount stores are attracting budget-conscious customers.\nIn the end, financial analysts say, consumer interest will be the biggest driver of whether the stores continue to spread.\n\u201cSales are really strong,\u201d said Shannon Warner, a partner in the consumer and retail practice of Kearney, a global strategy and management consulting firm. \u201cConsumers are voting for dollar stores with their wallets.\u201d\nWhen concerns over the proposed Dollar General in Morgan emerged, Huiras, the mayor, confessed that he had never been to a dollar store.\nSo Huiras, who worked in railroad construction until he retired and ran for office, drove to Fairfax, a town 18 miles away, where a dollar store had recently been built. A local electrician said the store had been built entirely with laborers who drove in each day from outside the area. The owner of a local farm equipment store told him that the members of the construction crew had bought exactly one nut to replace one they had stripped \u2014 and nothing else from his store. Huiras said that was when he knew the company would not be invested in his community.\nBecause the Morgan store would be outside the city limits, it required zoning approval by the county.\nOne of the owners of the Super Valu grocery store in Morgan, according to the minutes of a county Planning Commission meeting in January 2021, told officials that she estimated a Dollar General would reduce her store\u2019s revenue by as much as 20% during its first two years of operation. She said a grocer in a nearby town had closed shortly after a Dollar General opened there.\nOther residents expressed concern that Dollar General was a large corporation, and one person said the chain was simply not a \u201cgood fit\u201d for their small community.\nIn the end, the Planning Commission recommended denying the zoning application. The next month, the county\u2019s Board of Commissioners voted unanimously to follow that recommendation. \u201cAnd they never did bother us again,\u201d Huiras said."

      "text": "Dollar Store Entry Affects Rural Grocery Stores More Than Urban\n- by Keenan Marchesi, Sandro Steinbach and Rigoberto A. Lopez\n- 5/6/2024\nIndependent grocery stores, or grocers whose owners operate fewer than four stores, have been a large part of the rural U.S. food retail landscape. In 2015, they represented about half of the food retailers in 44 percent of U.S. counties. Leading up to 2015, however, dollar stores were becoming increasingly visible in rural counties, experiencing the second-largest growth behind supercenters among food retailers from 1990 to 2015, according to research by USDA, Economic Research Service (ERS). Economists from ERS, North Dakota State University, and the University of Connecticut recently investigated the implications of the growth of dollar stores for more traditional, independent grocery stores using proprietary data from the National Establishment Time Series (NETS) database and the ERS Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) Codes.\nNETS provides geographic, employment, and sales information for every year an establishment is open for all sectors of the U.S. economy. The researchers focused on dollar stores and independent grocery stores and combined these data with the ERS RUCA codes\u2019 measures of population density, urbanization, and daily commuting to classify census tracts; in this research, all nonmetropolitan core or commuting areas were classified as rural.\nThe researchers examined what happened to the number of independent grocery stores, as well as employment and sales statistics from these stores, from 2000\u201319, when a new dollar store opened in the same rural or urban census tract. Results showed that when a dollar store opened in a census tract independent grocery retailers were 2.3 percent more likely, on average, to exit the market. Employment at independent grocery stores fell about 3.7 percent, and sales declined by 5.7 percent.\nHowever, there was significant variation between the impact of dollar stores on independent grocery stores in urban and rural census tracts. For instance, the likelihood of an independent grocery store exiting a rural census tract after a new dollar store opened was 5 percent, about three times greater than in urban census tracts. Similarly, the decline in employment in rural tracts was about 2.5 times as large as in urban tracts, and the decline in sales was nearly double in rural census tracts.\nIn addition, the researchers found that in urban census tracts, these impacts waned after about 5 years following a dollar store\u2019s entry, but the effects continued in rural census tracts. This could reduce grocery store options in rural areas for the longer term. Dollar stores generally have a more limited selection of food products, focusing more on prepacked and processed foods. If independent grocers are less likely to return to rural communities after dollar store entry, this could lead to a more limited selection of food products available in these areas and affect consumer access to healthy foods.\nThis article is drawn from:\n- Lopez, R., Marchesi, K. & Steinbach, S.

Changes made to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) in 2005 necessitated revisions to the original HEI. At that time, the HEI was significantly updated through a collaboration between the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the USDA. The HEI was updated every five years to assess alignment with the new DGA. In 2020, the first HEI for toddlers was introduced based on the dietary pattern for the second year of life (i.e. age 12 through 23 months) in the 2020-2025 DGA.\nThis webpage details information about versions of the HEI from 2005 to present. For each iteration of the HEI, all of the key Dietary Guidelines food choice recommendations that relate to diet quality are reflected in that index's components.

Online ahead of print.\nHEI-Toddlers-2020 Overview\nThe HEI-Toddlers-2020, like HEI-2020, has 13 components reflecting all constituents of complementary foods and beverages consumed by toddlers, with the exception of human milk, infant formula, or other nutritional formulas such as toddler milks or follow-on formula. Healthy dietary patterns for toddlers have unique considerations reflected in the scoring standards for Added Sugars and Saturated Fats. Toddlers have lower caloric intake relative to high nutrient needs, and added sugars should be avoided. Another distinctive difference is that there is no recommendation to limit saturated fats to less than 10 percent of energy intake in this age group, however, saturated fats cannot be unlimited without displacing the energy available to achieve other food group and subgroup goals.\nHEI-2020 & HEI-2015\nHEI-2020 & HEI\u201320151 Components & Scoring Standards\n| Component | Maximum points | Standard for maximum score | Standard for minimum score of zero |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Adequacy: | |||\n| Total Fruits2 | 5 | \u22650.8 cup equiv. per 1,000 kcal | No Fruits |\n| Whole Fruits3 | 5 | \u22650.4 cup equiv. per 1,000 kcal | No Whole Fruits |\n| Total Vegetables4 | 5 | \u22651.1 cup equiv. per 1,000 kcal | No Vegetables |\n| Greens and Beans4 | 5 | \u22650.2 cup equiv. per 1,000 kcal | No Dark Green Vegetables or Legumes |\n| Whole Grains | 10 | \u22651.5 oz equiv. per 1,000 kcal | No Whole Grains |\n| Dairy5 | 10 | \u22651.3 cup equiv. per 1,000 kcal | No Dairy |\n| Total Protein Foods6 | 5 | \u22652.5 oz equiv. per 1,000 kcal | No Protein Foods |\n| Seafood and Plant Proteins6,7 | 5 | \u22650.8 oz equiv. per 1,000 kcal | No Seafood or Plant Proteins |\n| Fatty Acids7 | 10 | (PUFAs + MUFAs)/SFAs \u22652.5 | (PUFAs + MUFAs)/SFAs \u22641.2 |\n| Moderation: | |||\n| Refined Grains | 10 | \u22641.8 oz equiv. per 1,000 kcal | \u22654.3 oz equiv. per 1,000 kcal |\n| Sodium | 10 | \u22641.1 gram per 1,000 kcal | \u22652.0 grams per 1,000 kcal |\n| Added Sugars | 10 | \u22646.5% of energy | \u226526% of energy |\n| Saturated Fats | 10 | \u22648% of energy | \u226516% of energy |\n1: The HEI-2020 components and scoring standards are the same as the HEI-2015.

For the first time, the components and standards did not change between the HEI-2015 and HEI-2020 for the following reasons: the USDA Dietary Patterns remained virtually the same in the 2015-2020 and 2020-2025 DGA; there were no major changes in the key recommendations for children and adults ages 2 and older; and the state of the U.S. diet did not change significantly since 2015. Even though no changes were made, the index was renamed to clarify that it aligned with most current guidance (i.e., the HEI-2020 for the 2020-2025 DGA).\nHEI-2015\nThe HEI-2015 was designed to align with the 2015-2020 DGA. As with the previous DGA, the 2015-2020 edition emphasizes a variety of food groups, nutrient density, and improving food and beverage choices within calorie needs.\nA new aspect of the DGA introduced in 2015 is a specific recommendation on limiting intake of added sugars to less than 10% of total caloric intake.\nAs with the previous HEI versions, staff at the NCI and the USDA collaborated to revise the HEI to align with the recommendations in the 2015 DGA. Most of the HEI-2010 components were retained in HEI-2015; however, the \"Empty Calories\" component has been replaced by two separate components, \"Added Sugars\" and \"Saturated Fats,\" to better align with the newly quantified added sugars recommendation while still retaining the concept that these components encompass remaining calories in the diet.\nPreviously, excessive calories from alcohol were included in the Empty Calories component. With the changes regarding the Empty Calories component, alcohol is no longer specifically addressed within a single component. However, overall calories contributed from alcohol in the diet continue to be included in the total energy used as the denominator to calculate HEI-2015 scores.\nWhile the other dietary components remained the same with the HEI-2015 revision, a change was made to the method by which legumes are allocated to the components. In HEI-2015, legumes are now being allocated to four components: Total Protein Foods, Seafood and Plant Proteins, Total Vegetables, and Greens and Beans. Because legumes are consumed infrequently by many in the population, this change is expected to have little impact on total scores at the population level. However, for some subgroups, such as vegetarians, individual scores may improve substantially.\nAfter revisions, the HEI-2015 contains 13 components that sum to a total maximum score of 100 points. The total score is the sum of the score of adequacy components (i.e. foods to eat more of for good health) and moderation components (i.e. foods to limit for good health).\nAs in HEI-2005 and HEI-2010, each of the components is scored on a density basis out of 1,000 calories, with the exception of Fatty Acids, which is a ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids. The details of the scoring standards of the HEI-2015 are shown in the accompanying table.\nHEI-2010\nHEI\u201320101 Components & Scoring Standards\n| Component | Maximum points | Standard for maximum score | Standard for minimum score of zero |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Adequacy: | |||\n| Total Fruit2 | 5 | \u22650.8 cup equiv. per 1,000 kcal | No Fruit |\n| Whole Fruit3 | 5 | \u22650.4 cup equiv. per 1,000 kcal | No Whole Fruit |\n| Total Vegetables4 | 5 | \u22651.1 cup equiv. per 1,000 kcal | No Vegetables |\n| Greens and Beans4 | 5 | \u22650.2 cup equiv. per 1,000 kcal | No Dark Green Vegetables or Beans and Peas |\n| Whole Grains | 10 | \u22651.5 oz equiv. per 1,000 kcal | No Whole Grains |\n| Dairy5 | 10 | \u22651.3 cup equiv. per 1,000 kcal | No Dairy |\n| Total Protein Foods6 | 5 | \u22652.5 oz equiv. per 1,000 kcal | No Protein Foods |\n| Seafood and Plant Proteins6,7 | 5 | \u22650.8 oz equiv. per 1,000 kcal | No Seafood or Plant Proteins |\n| Fatty Acids8 | 10 | (PUFAs + MUFAs)/SFAs \u22652.5 | (PUFAs + MUFAs)/SFAs \u22641.2 |\n| Moderation: | |||\n| Refined Grains | 10 | \u22641.8 oz equiv. per 1,000 kcal | \u22654.3 oz equiv. per 1,000 kcal |\n| Sodium | 10 | \u22641.1 gram per 1,000 kcal | \u22652.0 grams per 1,000 kcal |\n| Empty Calories9 | 20 | \u226419% of energy | \u226550% of energy |\n1: Intakes between the minimum and maximum standards are scored proportionately.

Update of the Healthy Eating Index: HEI-2010. J Acad Nutr Diet. 2013 Apr; 113(4):569-80.\nHEI-2010 Overview\nThe 2010 DGA continued the 2005 DGA emphasis on several important aspects of diet quality, including whole grains, various types of vegetables, and specific types of fat. The 2010 DGA also differed from the previous DGA in several respects, including an increased emphasis on seafood and plant proteins and on reducing consumption of refined grains. As a result, the HEI\u20132005 needed to be revised and updated.\nStaff at the NCI and the USDA collaborated to revise the HEI, and a new version, the HEI\u20132010, was released in February 2013. A paper describing the HEI\u20132010 in detail is available.\nThis revision also provided an opportunity for the NCI and the USDA to evaluate the psychometric properties of the new index. Results from the evaluation can be found on the webpage, Evaluating the Healthy Eating Index.\nThe HEI\u20132010 is based in large part on USDA's 2010 food patterns, which translates recommendations in the 2010 DGA into specific, quantified dietary recommendations. All of the food groups contained in USDA's food patterns are represented in HEI\u20132010 components. Nine of the components focus on adequacy (dietary components to increase) and three focus on moderation (dietary components to decrease).\nThe HEI\u20132010 comprises 12 components that sum to a maximum total score of 100. Because USDA food pattern recommendations for amounts of food groups, oils, and empty calories are stated in terms of absolute amounts that vary according to energy level, the HEI\u20132010 scores use standards that are expressed as either a percent of calories or per 1,000 calories. This \"density\" approach uncouples diet quality from quantity. The one exception is fatty acids, which are expressed as a ratio of unsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids. The HEI\u20132010 components and scoring standards are shown in the accompanying table.\nHEI-2005\nHEI\u201320051 Components & Standards for Scoring\n| Component | Maximum points | Standard for maximum score | Standard for minimum score of zero |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Total Fruit (includes 100% juice) | 5 | \u22650.8 cup equiv. per 1,000 kcal | No Fruit |\n| Whole Fruit (not juice) | 5 | \u22650.4 cup equiv. per 1,000 kcal | No Whole Fruit |\n| Total Vegetables | 5 | \u22651.1 cup equiv. per 1,000 kcal | No Vegetables |\n| Dark Green and Orange Vegetables and Legumes2 | 5 | \u22650.4 cup equiv. per 1,000 kcal | No Dark Green or Orange Vegetables or Legumes |\n| Total Grains | 5 | \u22653.0 oz equiv. per 1,000 kcal | No Grains |\n| Whole Grains | 5 | \u22651.5 oz equiv. per 1,000 kcal | No Whole Grains |\n| Milk3 | 10 | \u22651.3 cup equiv. per 1,000 kcal | No Milk |\n| Meat and Beans | 10 | \u22652.5 oz equiv. per 1,000 kcal | No Meat or Beans |\n| Oils4 | 10 | \u226512 grams equiv. per 1,000 kcal | No Oil |\n| Saturated Fat | 10 | \u22647% of energy5 | \u226515% of energy |\n| Sodium | 10 | \u22640.7 gram per 1,000 kcal5 | \u22652.0 grams per 1,000 kcal |\n| Calories from Solid Fats, Alcoholic Beverages, and Added Sugars (SoFAAS) | 20 | \u226420% of energy | \u226550% of energy |\n1: Intakes between the minimum and maximum levels are scored proportionately, except for Saturated Fat and Sodium (see note 5).\n2: Legumes counted as vegetables only after Meat and Beans standard is met.\n3: Includes all milk products, such as fluid milk, yogurt, and cheese.\n4: Includes nonhydrogenated vegetable oils and oils in fish, nuts, and seeds.\n5: Saturated Fat and Sodium get a score of 8 for the intake levels that reflect the 2005 DGA, <10% of calories from saturated fat and 1.1 grams of sodium/1,000 kcal, respectively.\nSource: Guenther PM, Reedy J, Krebs-Smith SM. Development of the Healthy Eating Index\u20132005. J Am Diet Assoc. 2008 Nov;108(11):1896-901\nHEI-2005 Overview\nThe 2005 DGA differed from earlier editions by increasing the emphasis on several important aspects of diet quality, including whole grains, various types of vegetables, and specific types of fat. The 2005 DGA also introduced the concept of \"discretionary calories.\" As a result, the 1995 HEI needed to be revised and updated.\nStaff at the NCI and the USDA collaborated to revise the HEI, and a new version, the HEI\u20132005, was published in November 2007. This revision also provided an opportunity for the NCI and USDA to evaluate the psychometric properties of the new index.\nThe HEI\u20132005 is based on MyPyramid, USDA's revised food guidance system, which translates recommendations in the 2005 DGA into specific, quantified dietary recommendations. All of the food groups contained in MyPyramid are represented in HEI\u20132005 components.\nThe HEI\u20132005 uses a scoring system, as did the original HEI. However, because MyPyramid recommendations for amounts of food groups, oils, and discretionary calories are stated in terms of absolute amounts that vary according to energy level, the NCI and USDA team developed the HEI\u20132005 scores using standards that are expressed as either a percent of calories or per 1,000 calories. The HEI\u20132005 components and scoring standards are shown in the accompanying table."

  "argos_summary": "Research from Tufts University and the USDA indicates that while dollar store food is generally less healthy, it does not significantly impact the overall diet quality of consumers, particularly those with lower incomes. The study found that dollar store food purchases increased from 3.4% of total calories in 2008 to 6.5% in 2020, yet diet quality scores remained relatively stable among shoppers. Additionally, communities across the U.S. are increasingly opposing the expansion of dollar stores, citing concerns over their impact on local economies and food choices.",
