  "title": "Walmart\u2019s bestselling $66 laundry rack is only $36",
  "description": "Reviewers love the \"smart, space-saving design.\"",
  "content": "TheStreet aims to feature only the best products and services. If you buy something via one of our links, we may earn a commission.\n\nWhy we love this deal\n\nDoing laundry in a small apartment or dorm is a challenge. Even if you have a portable washing machine, going without a dryer or a dedicated space to air-dry delicates makes things even more difficult. Giant drying racks eat up precious space, so having something compact that folds away easily is a must. Right now, Walmart has a great deal on its bestselling collapsible laundry rack that's absolutely perfect for small spaces.\n\nThe is just $36 for a limited time, which is a 45% discount from the usual $66 price. If you need a reliable laundry rack that won't give out under the weight of your towels but also doesn't take up a ton of room, don't miss out on this \"amazingly steady\" while it's on sale.\n\nWhy do shoppers love it?\n\nThis 3-tier, stainless steel rack measures 39.3 inches high, 29.33 inches wide, and 14.96 inches deep when fully expanded. It has a telescopic design so you can adjust the width from 17.3 to 29.33 inches, depending on how much space you're working with or what all you need to dry.\n\nIt can hold quite a bit \u2014 up to 15 clothing items, two pillows, or 22 towels \u2014 all without snagging delicate fabrics or collapsing under the weight of wet fabric. When your things are dry, the rack collapses flat to slide under beds or between washers and dryers, making it ideal for apartments, tiny homes, or RVs. \"It collapses to a very small and easy-to-store size,\" one reviewer raved.\n\nNon-slip feet and a secure locking mechanism ensure stability. \"I especially like the feet,\" a satisfied shopper shared. There's also no assembly required, either. Just open it up and it's ready to go.\n\u2022 Dimensions: This drying rack measures 39.3 inches high, 29.33 inches wide, and 14.96 inches deep when expanded fully.\n\u2022 Capacity: Holds up to 15 clothing items, two pillows, or 22 towels.\n\u2022 Is it collapsible?: Yes.\n\nShoppers are impressed with this laundry rack's \"excellent quality and usability,\" noting that it's \"sturdy and easy to use.\" One shopper shared that it's \"sturdy enough for rugs.\"\n\n\"I love that I can change the size according to what I\u2019m trying to hang,\" another reviewer said.\n\nAt just $36, the is a can't-miss deal. Its \"smart, space-saving design\" makes it a great value, so hurry to Walmart and grab yours before the price goes back up.",
