  "title": "Hall of fame jockey Ron Turcotte, the man who rode Secretariat to the Triple Crown, dies at 84",
  "description": "\u201cThe world may remember Ron as the famous jockey of Secretariat, but to us he was a wonderful husband, a loving father, grandfather, and a great horseman.\u201d the family said.",
  "content": "Hall of Fame jockey Ron Turcotte, who rode Secretariat to the Triple Crown in 1973, has died. He was 84.\n\nTurcotte\u2019s family said through his longtime business partner and friend Leonard Lusky that the Canada-born jockey died of natural causes Friday at his home in Drummond, New Brunswick.\n\nHe won the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes twice each, most notably sweeping the three with Secretariat to end horse racing\u2019s Triple Crown drought that dated to Citation in 1948.\n\n\u201cRon was a great jockey and an inspiration to so many, both within and outside the racing world,\u201d Lusky said. \u201cWhile he reached the pinnacle of success in his vocation, it was his abundance of faith, courage, and kindness that was the true measure of his greatness.\u201d\n\nSecretariat\u2019s record time of 2:24 in the Belmont, winning by 31 lengths at a 1 1/2-mile distance, still stands 52 years later.\n\n\u201cI still had a lot of horse when I passed the wire,\u201d Turcotte said in 2023, nearly 50 years to the day since riding Secretariat in the Belmont. \u201cHe was not tired. \u2026 It was amazing.\u201d\n\nTurcotte won 3,032 races over a nearly two-decade career that ended in 1978 when he fell off a horse early in a race and suffered injuries that made him paraplegic. Permanently Disabled Jockeys Fund chairman William J. Punk Jr. called Turcotte one of the sport\u2019s greatest champions and ambassadors and praised him for his advocacy and efforts to help fellow fallen riders.\n\n\u201cWhile his courage as a jockey was on full display to a nation of adoring fans during that electrifying time, it was after he faced a life altering injury that we learned about the true character of Ron Turcotte,\u201d New York Racing Association president and CEO David O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cBy devoting himself to supporting fellow jockeys struggling through similar injuries, Ron Turcotte built a legacy defined by kindness and compassion.\u201d\n\nTurcotte was inducted into the National Museum of Racing Hall of Fame in 1979.\n\n\u201cThe world may remember Ron as the famous jockey of Secretariat, but to us he was a wonderful husband, a loving father, grandfather, and a great horseman.\u201d the Turcotte family said in a statement through Lusky.\n\nTurcotte was born in Drummond on July 22, 1941, as one of 12 children. He quit school to work as a lumberjack before moving to Toronto to get involved in horse racing, first as a hotwalker and then a jockey, becoming the leading rider at Woodbine Racetrack before rising to the Triple Crown level.\n\nWoodbine chairman Jim Lawson said Turcotte was \u201ca true Canadian icon whose impact on horse racing is immeasurable.\u201d\n\n\u201cRon carried himself with humility, strength and dignity,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cHis legacy in racing, both here at Woodbine and around the world, will live forever.\u201d\n\nTurcotte won the Preakness in 1965 aboard Tom Rolfe and the Derby and Belmont in 1972 with Riva Ridge. But it was his time with Secretariat that made Turcotte a household name in racing, and he called it \u201clove at first ride.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was the type of horse that you\u2019ll never see again,\u201d Turcotte said two years ago. \u201cHe was doing something that you\u2019ve never seen before and will probably never see again.\u201d\n\nTurcotte was the last surviving member of Secretariat\u2019s team: The colt died in 1989, groom Eddie Sweat in 1998, trainer Lucien Laurin in 2000, owner Penny Chenery in 2017 and exercise rider Charlie Davis in 2018.\n\n\u201cRon Turcotte was an icon and will forever be fondly remembered as the trusted partner of legendary Kentucky Derby and Triple Crown winner Secretariat, arguably the most popular thoroughbred in history,\u201d Churchill Downs Racetrack president Mike Anderson said. \u201cRon\u2019s many accomplishments on the racetrack and his deep passion for horse racing brought countless fans to the sport. He will be greatly missed.\u201d",

      "text": "Triple Crown winner Secretariat still dominant 50 years on\nTriple Crown winner Secretariat still dominant 50 years on\nSecretariat had an unusually large heart, an engine that propelled him to a Triple Crown sweep 50 years ago. The colt nicknamed Big Red remains the heartbeat of an industry that has yet to see such dominance on and off the track replicated.\nHis name recognition, even among those who don\u2019t follow sports, is still strong 34 years after his death, and eight of his descendants will run in the Kentucky Derby on Saturday, including early 3-1 favorite Forte.\n\u201cHe\u2019s still the bar to me,\u201d said Bob Baffert, who trained Triple Crown winners American Pharoah in 2015 and Justify in 2018. \u201cI still ask strangers, \u2018Who\u2019s the best horse you ever heard of?\u2019 and I\u2019m hoping they say Pharoah. They say Secretariat.\u201d\nSecretariat won the Derby, Preakness and Belmont in record times that still stand, and ended a 25-year Triple Crown drought.\n\u201cIt says he was beautifully prepared for each of those races, and his competition was not as good as he was,\u201d said Dave Johnson, track announcer for the 1973 Belmont in which Secretariat won by an astounding 31 lengths. \u201cHe was a special animal.\u201d\nBig Red\u2019s path to Triple Crown glory began in the Derby. He was the first horse to cover the 1 1/4-mile distance in under 2 minutes with a time of 1:59.40. It would not be repeated until Monarchos clocked 1:59.97 in 2001.\nTwo weeks later, Secretariat broke last out of the starting gate in the Preakness. Jockey Ron Turcotte made a split-second decision in the first turn to swing Big Red to the outside in a rush to the front. They won by 2 1/2 lengths over Sham, who had also finished second in the Derby.\n\u201cI could make five, six moves with him in a race. A normal horse you could make one or two,\u201d Turcotte told The Associated Press by phone from his home in Canada. \u201cDown the lane I never asked him to run. He just galloped to the wire very easily.\u201d\nThe Pimlico track\u2019s timing device showed Secretariat clocked 1:55 for 1 3/16 miles, but it had malfunctioned. It wasn\u2019t until 2012, at owner Penny Chenery\u2019s request, that the Maryland Racing Commission reviewed video and revised his time to 1:53, another track record.\nSecretariat\u2019s popularity exploded in the three weeks leading up to the Belmont. He became a pop culture phenomenon, appearing on the covers of Time and Newsweek while helping distract a nation dragged down by Watergate and the Vietnam War.\n\u201cHe had just about everything,\u201d Turcotte said. \u201cHe was a good-looking horse, he was a very strong horse, had a long stride that covered a lot of ground, a very cooperative and generous horse. He would give you whatever you asked of him.\u201d\nIn the Belmont, Secretariat was the 1-10 favorite in the grueling 1 1/2-mile race against just four rivals, including Sham who was back for another try.\nSecretariat went to the early lead along the rail and was soon challenged by Sham, ridden by Laffit Pincay Jr. The two horses were even through a half-mile at a blistering pace in what became a match race with the rest of the field about 10 lengths behind.\nSham poked his head in front around the turn, but soon weakened. Secretariat began distancing himself from the field. He ran the mile in 1:34.20 and reeled off 1 1/4 miles in 1:59, faster than his record time in the Derby.\nBig Red completed the last quarter in a scant 25 seconds. He finished in 2:24, his third record in as many races.\n\u201cThe Belmont was such a magnificent display of speed and stamina,\u201d recalled Johnson, who is now 81.\nSham was injured and finished last. He never raced again.\nSecretariat\u2019s legend has only endured. He had his own U.S. stamp and was the subject of a 2010 Disney movie.\n\u201cHe was a beautiful horse,\u201d said Pincay, now 76 and retired since 2003. \u201cYou never saw him do anything stupid. Some horses jump and down and get nervous. He was very businesslike.\u201d\nSecretariat\u2019s heart \u2014 which a 1989 necropsy found weighed 22 pounds, compared to 8 1/2 pounds for the average horse \u2014 was the basis for an Audi car commercial in 2017.\n\u201cHe could turn air to oxygen much faster than another horse could,\u201d Turcotte said.\nAnd on the 50th anniversary of his history-making triumph, Secretariat is being given another round of celebration. The Kentucky Derby Museum is featuring \u201cSecretariat: America\u2019s Horse,\u201d a new exhibit that uses technology to show how his physique helped make him such a standout. His three Triple Crown victories can be viewed on a 10-foot wall.\nThe National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame is taking a traveling exhibit to the Triple Crown cities of Louisville, Kentucky, Baltimore and New York \u2014 as well as Secretariat\u2019s birth state of Virginia. The exhibit features his Triple Crown trophies and the story of the people who guided him.\nTurcotte is the lone remaining member of Secretariat\u2019s team. Chenery, his owner, died in 2017 at age 95; trainer Lucien Laurin died in 2000; groom Eddie Sweat died in 1998; and exercise rider Charlie Davis died in 2018. Bill Nack, the former Sports Illustrated writer who closely chronicled Big Red\u2019s career, also died in 2018.\nTurcotte, 81, became a paraplegic after a riding accident in 1978. He travels less these days while caring for his wife in his tiny hometown of Drummond, New Brunswick, where there\u2019s a statue of him and Secretariat crossing the finish line.\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a horse like him,\u201d Turcotte said, \u201cand I doubt there will be another one.\u201d\nIn 2015, on his way to the Belmont winner\u2019s circle for American Pharoah in 2015, Baffert shared a celebratory embrace with Chenery.\n\u201cI whispered in her ear, \u2018He\u2019s no Secretariat, but he\u2019s as close as I\u2019ll ever get,\u2019\u201d the Hall of Fame trainer said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re damn right,\u201d she replied.\n___\nAP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sport"

      "text": "Secretariat\u2019s jockey Ron Turcotte remembers Triple Crown winner who \u2018could fly\u2019 on 50th anniversary\nSecretariat\u2019s jockey Ron Turcotte remembers Triple Crown winner who \u2018could fly\u2019 on 50th anniversary\nFrom the tiny village of Drummond, New Brunswick, Ron Turcotte rose to the top of horse racing, riding Secretariat to a sweep of the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont in 1973. Their triumphs ended a 25-year Triple Crown drought. Now 81, Turcotte is the last surviving member of Secretariat\u2019s team as he marks the 50th anniversary of their feat with the Belmont Stakes on Saturday.\nHere are some stories from his life and career, based on a recent interview with The Associated Press:\nFROM LUMBERJACK TO JOCKEY\nTurcotte is one of 12 children, including five brothers who also became jockeys. He grew up speaking French in Drummond, outside Grand Falls.\nHe left school at age 14 to work with his father as a lumberjack. He was slight in stature like his dad, who had him work with the draft horses that hauled the logs instead of doing the more dangerous work in the forest.\nAt 18, Turcotte and a friend headed to Toronto with $50 each in their pockets. He was going to join the roofing trade like his brother, but local carpenters were on strike, so they sought any work they could find.\nThe friends discovered a restaurant that fed them in exchange for washing dishes. To pay for a room, they picked nightcrawlers until the wee hours.\n\u201cWe got tired and discouraged,\u201d Turcotte recalled.\nOn the first Saturday in May 1960, the friends emerged from their attic quarters and found a crowd around the television watching the Kentucky Derby. They were cheering on Victoria Park, which finished third as the first Canadian horse to place in a Triple Crown race.\nTurcotte asked a man what the Derby was. \u201cThe biggest horse race there is in North America,\u201d he replied.\nThe man asked if Turcotte had found work yet. Told no, he suggested Turcotte try the local racetrack, Woodbine. The teenager made his way there, but got turned away by a guard for not having an entry pass.\nTurcotte was told to try the newer Woodbine track located on the outskirts of Toronto. He hitchhiked there the next day. A trainer driving by picked him up and they were waved through the gate by the guard.\nMAKING CONNECTIONS\nTurcotte made an important connection in 1960 when he met E.P. Taylor, a prominent owner, breeder and businessman regarded as a major force in the development of Canadian racing. He went to Taylor\u2019s farm to learn about thoroughbreds.\n\u201cHe handed me the shank and said, \u2018Keep turning left,\u2019\u201d Turcotte said of cooling out horses after workouts. \u201cI kept turning left for about 30 minutes.\u201d\nWhat Taylor had yet to discover was that Turcotte had spent five years cutting lumber and driving a team of draft horses. He also knew how to shoe horses.\n\u201cI had never sat in a saddle before,\u201d Turcotte said.\nTo earn a living in the bitter Canadian winters, Turcotte galloped horses on the farm to keep them fit.\nBy 1962, Turcotte had won his first race. He was off and riding on his way to 3,032 career victories.\nCREATING FAMILY\nTurcotte married his childhood sweetheart, Gaetane, in 1964. The couple has four daughters: Tina, Anne, Lynn and Tammy. After his career ended prematurely, he returned to his hometown to live on his farm, where each of his daughters had their own horse.\nBEFORE SECRETARIAT\nIn 1971, Turcotte took note of a colt named Riva Ridge. The horse was bumped in his first start and finished well back. He won his next two races before losing again.\nTurcotte stopped by trainer Lucien Laurin\u2019s barn and told him, \u201cYou have the best 2-year-old in North America.\u201d\nLaurin changed jockeys and hired Turcotte for Riva Ridge\u2019s next start. They won despite the colt bolting to the outside after leaving the starting gate.\nTurcotte realized the colt was afraid of close quarters after what happened in his first race. He asked Laurin to give him a month with Riva Ridge away from racing, believing he could help the colt overcome his fear.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to give me 30 days but I insisted,\u201d Turcotte said. \u201cI needed to re-school him.\u201d\nTurcotte\u2019s instincts proved correct. Riva Ridge won four straight stakes races in the fall of 1971 and earned honors as that year\u2019s 2-year-old champion. They teamed to win the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes the following year.\nMEETING THE QUEEN\nTurcotte met Queen Elizabeth II in 1970 after riding Fanfreluche to victory in the Manitoba Derby during the province\u2019s 100th birthday. She presented him with the winner\u2019s plate.\nThe mare was sired by Northern Dancer, the first Canadian-bred horse to win the Kentucky Derby in 1964 who went on to become one of the sport\u2019s greatest sires.\n\u201cShe was a Northern Dancer fan,\u201d Turcotte said of the horse-loving queen, \u201cso she had a lot of questions about Northern Dancer.\u201d\nFive years earlier, he had met the Queen Mother.\n\u201cMy dad and mother were both very impressed,\u201d he said.\nMEETING SECRETARIAT\nTurcotte stopped by the Laurin\u2019s barn one day to visit Riva Ridge.\nTwo stalls down, a chestnut colt stuck his head out. \u201cWho\u2019s that pretty boy you have here?\u201d Turcotte asked.\nLaurin replied, \u201cHe\u2019s too good-looking to be a racehorse.\u201d\nStill, the trainer told Turcotte to get on Secretariat and give his opinion.\n\u201cIt was love at first sight and first ride,\u201d Turcotte said. \u201cHe was so nice. He was like an older horse, he was quiet, very intelligent.\u201d\nTurcotte was soon getting on Secretariat regularly, teaching him to work in the mornings, increase his speed and learn how to break from the starting gate. The jockey was soon calling his new friend \u201cBig Red,\u201d a nickname that has stuck to this day.\n\u201cYou\u2019d teach him something one day and he\u2019d come back the next day and he\u2019d do it,\u201d Turcotte said. \u201cNot all horses are that intelligent.\u201d\nA MAN AND HIS HORSE\nDespite a singular focus on the racetrack, Turcotte described Secretariat as a \u201cvery kind and loving horse.\u201d\nStill, the colt sometimes had a mind of his own.\nOne morning, Secretariat suddenly reared up and tossed Turcotte over his head. The jockey landed on his feet, unhurt.\n\u201cHe looked at me like, \u2018What are you doing there?\u2019\u201d Turcotte said. \u201cI walked up to him, grabbed the reins and hopped on him again.\u201d\nThe jockey would visit Secretariat and also greet other horses in the barn.\n\u201cHe was a little jealous,\u201d Turcotte said. \u201cIf I talked to another horse in the next stall, he\u2019d reach over and grab my jacket and pull me back to him.\u201d\nA special bond existed between man and horse.\n\u201cOne time he pinched me a little and I said, \u2018Ouch, you hurt me.\u2019 He put his head down like he was so sad,\u201d Turcotte said. \u201cI said to him, \u2018It\u2019s OK, you didn\u2019t hurt me.\u2019 His head popped up and his ears were pricked. He was a ham.\u201d\nTAKING A FAMOUS PEEK\nAfter winning the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, Secretariat put away the field early in the 1973 Belmont Stakes, using his long, loping strides to widen the gap to 20 lengths.\nAt that point, the race was against the clock.\nWith 70 yards remaining in the 1 1/2-mile race, Turcotte looked to his left at the infield teletimer.\n\u201cI knew he was setting records all the way down the lane,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re alone like that, I could hear the announcer very well.\u201d\nSecretariat won by an astonishing 31 lengths and his final time of 2:24 remains a record 50 years later.\nA CAREER CUT SHORT\nTurcotte\u2019s riding career was cut short on July 13, 1978. He fell from his horse, Flag of Leyte Gulf, in his last race of the day at Belmont Park, the site of his Triple Crown triumph. A horse drifted toward the outside, crowding another. Sensing the danger, Turcotte stood in the saddle and yelled to the riders inside of him. His horse clipped heels and stumbled badly, tossing Turcotte over its head.\nHe wasn\u2019t trampled by any horses, but knew he had broken his neck when he couldn\u2019t feel his legs. Later that year, Turcotte sued several parties but the suit was dismissed in 1986 by New York\u2019s highest court, which cited the inherent risks taken by jockeys.\nTurcotte spent many years making appearances at racetracks to raise money and awareness on behalf of the Permanently Disabled Jockeys Fund, which provides help to his fellow injured riders.\nIn 2015, he broke both legs when the van he was driving flipped after hitting a snowbank in New Brunswick. He requested one blue cast and one white cast, the same colors as Secretariat\u2019s silks. Turcotte and Secretariat are immortalized with a bronze statue in his hometown.\nLONE SURVIVOR\nNow 81, Turcotte is the last surviving member of Secretariat\u2019s team. The irony isn\u2019t lost on him.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d be the first one to go,\u201d he said, having been a paraplegic since his accident.\nOwner Penny Chenery died in 2017 at age 95. Laurin died in 2000.\n\u201cHe always told me, \u2019Use your better judgement,\u2019\u201d Turcotte said. \u201cHe relied on me for a lot of things. He didn\u2019t always listen.\u201d\nGroom Eddie Sweat died in 1998 and exercise rider Charlie Davis followed in 2018.\n\u201cCharlie and Eddie were very good horsemen,\u201d he said. \u201cSweat was beautiful with horses.\u201d\nSecretariat died in 1989. He was euthanized after developing laminitis, a painful and debilitating hoof disease.\n\u201cWhen it came to running, he could fly,\u201d Turcotte said. \u201cHe was everything.

      "text": "Before the Belmont Stakes, the race that would make Secretariat a household name, Eddie Sweat looked at the horse and whispered: \u201cYou know what I want you to do.\u201d\nSweat\u2019s youngest sister, Geraldine Hollman, overheard the whisper. She recalled that the 3-year-old horse shook his head back at the Holly Hill-born groomer and pressed his hoof into the ground.\n\u201cThe last words he said to him before the race were \u2018Go get him,\u2019\u201d Hollman said. \u201cThat horse understood exactly what he said. He gave that horse a kiss and then he took off like a jet.\u201d\nSecretariat, known by his nickname \"Big Red,\" won the Belmont Stakes in 31 lengths, the fastest 1\u00bd miles in thoroughbred racing history. He won in Louisville at the Kentucky Derby, he won in Maryland at the Preakness Stakes.\nIn 1973, he made headlines for being the first Triple Crown winner in 25 years. The 145th Kentucky Derby is Saturday in Louisville.\nEveryone knows about Secretariat, but few know about Sweat \u2014 the horse\u2019s best friend. The groomer fed Secretariat, bathed him and loved him like a son.\nHis legacy was honored in 2006 when a 1,500-pound statue of Secretariat was unveiled at the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington. In the life-size sculpture, Sweat is leading Secretariat to the winner's circle at the Kentucky Derby with his jockey, Ron Turcotte, on the horse's back.\n\"He was a really good man,\" Turcotte, Secretariat's jockey, told The Post and Courier.\nOne of the last times he saw the groomer was at the statue's dedication ceremony.\n\"He was without a doubt one of the best groomers I worked with,\" Turcotte said. \"He really deserved it.\"\nBut despite having his likeness cast in bronze, Sweat\u2019s family said the groomer died virtually penniless.\n\"Big Red's\" career earnings were more than $1.3 million, but Sweat had to have a charitable organization pay for his funeral.\n\u201cAll those people who work on the backside, they never get ahead,\u201d said Bill Doolittle, a horse racing historian and author of several books about the Kentucky Derby. \u201cThey live a poor life, they make low wages and they don\u2019t have many prospects for working in another place. It\u2019s not a good reputation for the sport.\u201d\nA vocation\nSweat called Holly Hill, about an hour northwest of Charleston, home. His parents Mary and David Sweat were tenant farmers. Sweat, one of nine children, helped pick crops.\nBut, as a teenager, he would go to look at horses at U.S. Racing Hall of Fame trainer Lucien Laurin\u2019s farm in town. One day, after watching Sweat looking at the horses through the fence line, Laurin offered him a job.\nHollman said her brother didn\u2019t finish school. He left Holly Hill and traveled the horse circuit at a young age. Sweat ended up in New York City, and Hollman grew up thinking she didn\u2019t have an older brother for the first part of her life.\nDoolittle said many groomers, like Sweat, used racing as a way to escape poverty or to fulfill their wanderlust.\n\u201cIt was a vocation, a way to get a good life job and get away from whatever their circumstances were,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cAnd those guys ended up in New York City.\u201d\nWith his connection to Laurin, Sweat had access to some of the best horses in the field. Secretariat, owned by Penny Chenery, was one of them.\n\"He really was in tune with the horses,\u201d said Leonard Lusky, the president of Secretariat.com and manager of Big Red's merchandising rights for the Chenery family. \u201cThey entrusted him with the best horses in the stable. Eddie knew how to handle Secretariat without manhandling him. I think Secretariat adored Eddie.\u201d\nHorse racing has a hierarchy. The owner talks to the trainer, the trainer talks to the jockey. The manual labor, often, speaks directly to the trainer. But Sweat would go out of his way to talk to Turcotte and keep him updated on the horse.\n\"He'd always keep me in the loop,\" Turcotte said. \"He'd tell me if he ate his oats and how his health was. Secretariat could be playful, but Eddie always knew how to handle him.\"\nAs Secretariat's star was rising, Eddie Sweat came back home to Orangeburg County for a visit.\n\u201cOne day, there was no school, and this horse truck was coming up and it stopped on the side of the road,\u201d Hollman said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand. My mom said \u2018Thank you, Lord. This is your brother.\u2019 She started to cry, and she hadn\u2019t seen him in so many years.\u201d\nHe wanted his baby sister to see \"Big Red\" run.\nLosing touch\nSeth Hancock of Claiborne Farm where Secretariat would eventually retire, famously told ESPN the horse transcended reality.\n\u201cYou want to know who Secretariat is in human terms?\u201d he told ESPN. \u201cJust imagine the greatest athlete in the world. The greatest. Now make him six-foot-three, the perfect height. Make him real intelligent and kind. And on top of that, make him the best-lookin\u2019 guy ever to come down the pike. He was all those things as a horse. He isn\u2019t even a horse anymore. He\u2019s a legend.\u201d\nWhen Secretariat became famous, so did everyone associated with the horse.\n\u201cBefore Secretariat, people around the horse didn\u2019t become immediately famous, as well,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cThere was a great interest in finding out about anyone who was close with the horse. And his name was Eddie Sweat, who couldn\u2019t love it? If you were an editor, you needed his name in the cutline or any quotes from (him).\u201d\nHe was constantly photographed with the horse, often wearing his signature plaid, bell-bottom pants and a bright blazer. He also had no shortage of words about his love for Secretariat and appeared on the covers of Ebony and Jet magazine.\nIn a profile in Sports Illustrated, he recalled the first time he met Secretariat.\n\"People might call me crazy, but that's the way it is,\" Sweat told Sports Illustrated. \"I've been on the racetrack 34 years, and I ain't never gonna give up. I think they'll take me to my grave with a pitchfork in my hand and a rub rag in my back pocket.\"\nSweat made his home in Queens, N.Y., and he worked for Laurin's son Roger for the remainder of his career.\nHe would often send money home, Hollman said, but he never saved much. He lost most of his Secretariat memorabilia in a 1991 fire that wrecked his home in Queens, according to The Baltimore Sun.\nHollman paid him a visit in New York. Sweat was very sick. He told his baby sister that he wanted her to pay for an airline ticket back to South Carolina.\nA couple weeks later, she got a phone call. Sweat had some instructions.\nHe wanted to buried at Rock Hill AME Church Cemetery in Orangeburg County with the rest of his family. He wanted a blue casket. He wanted to wear a blue double-breasted suit and he wanted his shirt and tie to match. And despite being photographed wearing dozens of colorful hats throughout his career, he didn't want one to be left on his head.\nSweat died April 17, 1998, of leukemia at age 58. He was buried just as his baby sister was instructed. His family couldn't afford the expenses, so the Jockey Club Foundation, which helps needy people in racing, paid for the funeral, the Sun reported. Hollman also took on the expenses.\nNo one from Secretariat's inner circle was present. Hollman said there wasn't any financial or emotional support from the Chenery family.\n\"I don't know why those people didn't treat him better than they did,\" Hollman said. \"I'm very angry with that. They didn't even send a flower, none of them showed up.\"\n'He\u2019s the vigilant one'\nLusky, who speaks on behalf of the family since their passing, said the owners never knew about Sweat's situation and didn't know about his death until after the funeral. They lost touch with him after Secretariat's rise to fame.\nLusky said he never knew what Sweat's pay was but suspected that he struggled with substance abuse. Hollman said her brother never used drugs but did drink alcohol.\n\u201cIt's true Eddie died relatively poor,\u201d Lusky said. \u201cWhile he continued to work ... they all really lost touch with each other. They all sort of scattered apart. It was devastating when the family finally found out about Eddie\u2019s death.\u201d\nThere is a modest grave in Holly Hill \u2014 a silver plaque that states his name, his date of birth and the day he died. Lusky said the owners always loved Sweat, and said his statue in Lexington is an example of that.\n\u201c(Secretariat's owner) wanted to make sure Eddie was a part of that statue,\u201d Lusky said. \u201cHe\u2019s the person who spent the most time with the horse. He\u2019s the vigilant one who stayed with him, protected him. Just like a mother with a newborn baby.\u201d\nSweat was portrayed in the 2010 Disney movie \"Secretariat\" by Nelsan Ellis. He wore Sweat's signature bright clothes and fashionable hats. Hollman said she couldn't finish the movie without crying.\n\"He just managed to make ends meet with his family,\" Hollman said. \"But it didn't matter for him. He just wanted to be with his horses.\""
