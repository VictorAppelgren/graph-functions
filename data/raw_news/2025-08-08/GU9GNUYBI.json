  "description": "Some Google Messages users say the app keeps crashing for them. Here's what to know about the issue and what you can try to address it.",
  "content": "Google Messages is the built-in messaging platform for millions of users worldwide. Unfortunately, some users are experiencing a rather serious issue with the app.\n\nSome Google Messages users on Reddit (h/t: 9to5Google) report that the app keeps crashing. Affected users noted that they couldn\u2019t open the Google Messages app (version messages.android_20250805_00_RCO0.phone.openbeta dynamic) without it crashing.\n\n\u201cI can reply to texts via notification and bubble, but if I open the app itself, everything crashes,\u201d said user @snuggle92.\n\n\u201cI literally can\u2019t use my text messages unless someone texts me first or I go into my contacts and it\u2019s so frustrating because I refuse to use the Samsung messaging app!\u201d said user @gabbydawn26.\n\nThe issue isn\u2019t restricted to a specific carrier or device manufacturer, either. Google Pixel, Samsung, and Motorola users on Fido, Google Fi, T-Mobile, and Verizon have all chimed in to report the problem.\n\nOne user noted that they fixed the issue by installing the beta version of the app, leaving the beta program, and then returning to the regular version. However, other users said this didn\u2019t address the problem. Users also said that clearing the app\u2019s cache didn\u2019t work. However, some people report that they fixed the problem by uninstalling the latest Messages update and then reinstalling it. So it\u2019s definitely worth trying the latter workaround if you\u2019re one of the affected users.\n\nIn any event, we\u2019ve asked Google to clarify the issue and if there\u2019s a timeline for a fix. We\u2019ll update the article if/when the company gets back to us.",

Learn more.\nThe best Samsung phones: High-end, mid-range, and entry-level models\nFebruary 8, 2025\nSamsung has been the king of the Android world for years now, and the South Korean giant\u2019s lineup of phones has something for everyone. When deciding the best Samsung phone for you, there are a few things to consider:\n- How far can you stretch your budget?\n- How important is camera performance?\n- Will you use your Samsung phone for gaming or demanding apps?\n- What form factor do you want? Small? Large? Folding?\nOnce you\u2019ve decided what\u2019s important to you, we\u2019ve done the hard work for you. We\u2019ve tested and reviewed literally every Samsung phone on the market, boiling down the options to just six phones. If you want some more insight, check out our detailed buyer\u2019s guide to learn more.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus is the best Samsung phone for most people\nNaturally, you\u2019d assume that paying big bucks should award the best phone, but that\u2019s not necessarily true. Look no further than the Galaxy S25 Plus for proof. The middle S25 model is one of the best Android phones you can buy, combining all the best parts of the Galaxy S24 Plus with a price tag that\u2019s much easier to approach than its Ultra-branded sibling.\nThis year, buyers everywhere get the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy, specifically tweaked for Samsung\u2019s purposes, and all models are mated to 12GB of RAM \u2014 plenty of juice for apps and games \u2014 and up to 512GB of internal storage. Also, Samsung\u2019s latest Dynamic AMOLED panel is excellent, as always, with the Galaxy S25 Plus sporting a 6.7-inch 120Hz panel. Samsung has also further chiseled away at the phone\u2019s bezels so that it won\u2019t dent your pocket any more than its predecessor, though the sharp, flat frame might not be very comfortable for small hands.\nThe Galaxy S25 Plus also comes preciously close to its largest sibling in terms of battery capacity, landing at 4,900mAh. That\u2019s only a sliver smaller than the Ultra model, which should give the Plus healthy longevity between charges. There\u2019s still no official Qi2 charging from magnets in the Galaxy S25 Plus itself, but you can grab a magnetic case for some level of MagSafe support.\nSamsung\u2019s other big drawcard is its camera hardware, but you\u2019ll have to look long and hard to find any notable upgrades over the outgoing model. The 50MP wide, 12MP ultrawide, and 10MP telephoto zoom cameras are still here, and they all continue to perform admirably. More interestingly, Samsung has added even more AI-powered capture tools to the bag, including a smart color adjustment system and the ability to cut video clips into a highlight reel automatically.\nOther positives include Samsung\u2019s top-notch software support. The Galaxy S25 Plus offers a seven-year Android update promise, dishing out new One UI builds well into the next decade. Notably, this is a feature across the entire Galaxy S25 series, so don\u2019t make this your primary reason for buying.\nThe best camera phone from Samsung is the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It offers a 200MP main camera, a 50MP ultrawide, a 50MP 5x telephoto, and a 10MP 3x telephoto sensor.\nWhat makes it stand out\n- Battery, buffed: The 4,900mAh reservoir is nearly as large as the Ultra\u2019s.\n- Versatile cameras: The tried and tested triple-camera setup is great for almost any situation.\n- Great performance: All buyers can enjoy the pacey Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy, along with 12GB of RAM.\n- Gorgeous display: The slightly larger, brighter, and crisp AMOLED screen is easily visible outside, even on sunny days.\n- Software promise: Android manufacturers are taking software updates seriously, and the Galaxy S25 series is the first to benefit.\nThe Samsung Galaxy A35 5G offers unbeatable mid-range value\nWe\u2019d recommend the Galaxy A55 ($387 at Amazon) in other regions of the world, but it\u2019s not coming to the US. However, the Galaxy A35 is an admirable and capable mid-range alternative.\nUp front, the phone features a vibrant 6.6-inch AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and a slathering or Gorilla Glass Victus Plus. Despite its mostly plastic construction, this should give the Galaxy A35 great scratch resistance.\nAt the rear, the phone\u2019s camera array gives it a similar appearance to its more premium siblings, especially the Galaxy S24. It houses a 50MP primary camera, which produces pleasing results in bright and lower light. Color reproduction is another positive, while the lack of motion blur when snapping moving objects is a big surprise. However, the 8MP ultrawide and 5MP macro cameras feel less refined.\nNevertheless, you\u2019ll be soothed by the phone\u2019s excellent battery endurance. With its Exynos 1380 and a 5,000mAh battery, the Galaxy A35 can go well beyond a day with regular use. Once it does run out, you can recharge it at up to 25W with the correct charger.\nThere\u2019s not much to dislike about the Galaxy A35, but the lack of Galaxy AI features may be a sticking point for potential buyers. Additionally, the lack of wireless charging is understandable but unfortunate.\nNevertheless, the Galaxy A35 is the best mid-range Samsung you can purchase in the US. If you live in Europe or India, the Galaxy A55 is a better, albeit pricier, purchase.\nGenerally, most Samsung phones have excellent battery life. But if you were looking for a device that offers a good balance between cost and longevity, the Galaxy A54 5G or Galaxy A35 5G are good choices. Alternatively, the Galaxy S24 Plus is the longest-lasting flagship, according to our tests.\nWhat makes it stand out\n- Flagship design: The Galaxy A35 looks so much like its premium siblings that you won\u2019t mind its plastic frame.\n- Great battery life: The Galaxy A35 should last well over a day and a half, even without battery-saving mode enabled.\n- Solid update commitment: Four years of Android version updates and an extra year of security updates are admirable for a mid-range model.\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra is the power user\u2019s dream phone\nThis is the most powerful Samsung smartphone you can buy, but it won\u2019t necessarily be the best for most people. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is a phone for power users who want everything in a handset, bar a foldable display \u2014 though it hasn\u2019t changed too much from its predecessor.\nIn total, the Galaxy S24 Ultra has five cameras. The rear four are headlined by a 200MP main and two telephoto cameras with 50MP 5x zoom and 10MP 3x zoom capabilities, respectively, but most of the love has gone to a new 50MP ultrawide sensor with a shallower depth of field for better light capture. At the front, you\u2019ll find the same 12MP selfie camera used on the last few Ultras. We do have to admit that we miss the 10x telephoto sensor just a little bit, though.\nNevertheless, other things will keep you occupied, including the S Pen tucked away in its dedicated slot, the copious 5,000mAh battery, and the now completely flat 6.8-inch AMOLED screen. Just keep in mind that a phone this large comes with a titanium frame to match, so it\u2019s going to be tough to hold in smaller hands.\nWhat makes it stand out\n- Integrated S Pen: If you use it, this can be a game-changer for productivity. Or Candy Crush. Your call.\n- Revamped design: Gone are the rounded sides, but the result is a Galaxy S25 Ultra that looks more like its siblings.\n- Gorgeous screen: The S25 Ultra screen is gorgeous and flat, making S Pen use even more enjoyable.\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 6 is the best foldable for most people\nFoldable phones are steadily coming into their own, and the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is no exception. It might not be as big of a change as its predecessor, but it raises the Galaxy AI experience in several ways. If you\u2019ve been eyeing a foldable for your next phone, the much larger Flex Window is back again, and it still comes with some of the best widgets you\u2019ll find on a flip phone.\nThe biggest selling point here is still the form factor. Samsung\u2019s clamshell foldable phone still fits comfortably into a pocket (at least most pockets) and opens up to reveal a 6.7-inch AMOLED display. Unfortunately, it still isn\u2019t quite as bright or crisp as a traditional display, but Samsung inches closer and closer every year. However, it\u2019s not as wide as a normal smartphone, which makes it much easier to use with one hand. Of course, the real selling point for the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is the Flex Window, which looks and feels a lot like the cover screen on the Motorola Razr Plus \u2014 even if it\u2019s not as large. You\u2019ll have to install Good Lock for most app experiences, but then you can open everything from Instagram to Strava on the 3.4-inch panel.\nSamsung has also upgraded the software features that you can tap into on the Flex Window with a brand-new Auto Zoom mode for the dual cameras. Essentially, it uses Galaxy AI to track you, the subject, through the field of view, automatically adjusting the zoom from 0.5x up to 3x for a more convenient selfie.\nSpeaking of the camera, the Z Flip 6 is certainly a capable shooter, and it finally has a new primary sensor. Samsung swapped the previous 12.5MP primary camera for a new 50MP version, once again paired with a 12MP ultrawide camera to fit more in your frame. The setup does serve as a great selfie alternative, though. Apart from group selfies using the Flex Mode, the screen on the front can also serve as a viewfinder, which allows you to take selfies with larger, more capable external cameras.\nApart from that, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is a great little phone \u2014 even if I didn\u2019t expect to like it at first. Performance is stellar thanks to the overclocked Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy. Battery life is about the same as its predecessor, which makes sense when you pair the upgraded processor with a more demanding cover display. It\u2019s still limited compared to traditional phones, but it\u2019s enough for a typical day. It took a little over an hour to charge while plugged in or an hour and a half wirelessly. Once again, though, there\u2019s no charger in the box.\nWhat makes it stand out\n- Flex Window: Samsung\u2019s larger cover screen allows for much more in-depth app experiences and better widgets.\n- Very pocketable: The small size fits easily in pockets and purses and is great for one-handed use.\n- Premium materials: Samsung\u2019s combination of aluminum and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 is as tough as they come.\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 6 is the best tablet replacement\nWhile the Galaxy S24 Ultra is a productivity powerhouse, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 takes things to the next level by unfolding into a bright, sharp, 120Hz 7.6-inch tablet. To sweeten the deal, the interior screen is compatible with an S Pen, although there isn\u2019t one included in the box. However, unlike the Galaxy Z Flip 6, Samsung\u2019s book-style foldable has a few new design upgrades to mention\nThe large interior screen is obviously the big selling point here, but the rest of the phone is top-notch, too. Samsung finally squared off the external display, making it feel a bit larger and wider for use when closed. This year\u2019s cameras are about the same as the previous setup, once again rolling with a 50MP primary camera, 10MP telephoto, and a 12MP ultrawide for good measure. The interior screen has an under-display camera to minimize its visual impact, but it has remained essentially unchanged since Samsung introduced it a few years back.\nOn the performance side, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy is more than powerful enough for smooth and consistent performance on the Galaxy Z Fold 6, even on the larger screen. Battery life is once again good enough but not incredible, mostly due to the additional display real estate and relatively small 4,400mAh cell. It took nearly an hour and a half to charge the Galaxy Z Fold 5 from dead to full, and the Galaxy Z Fold 6 once again tops out at 25W wired speeds.\nWhat makes it stand out\n- It folds: The phone opens into a very nice 7.6-inch tablet.\n- S Pen compatibility: Get even more out of your phone with an S Pen (sold separately).\n- Great software: Android 14 has been optimized for larger devices, providing a much better experience.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 FE offers affordable flagship performance\nSamsung\u2019s Fan Edition family has been on an interesting journey. After landing among the best phones of the year with the Galaxy S20 FE, the follow-up Galaxy S21 FE felt like a case of too little, too late. Now, Samsung is back to recapture some of its early success with yet another mid-ranger, the Galaxy S24 FE. On the surface, it follows the Fan Edition formula to the letter, but under the hood, it delivers much, much more.\nFor starters, the Galaxy S24 FE certainly looks the part. It\u2019s almost identical to Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24 Plus, swapping frosted rear glass for a glossy panel but otherwise matching the refined design language. The Galaxy S24 FE\u2019s 6.7-inch AMOLED panel stands much larger than its smallest flagship cousin, offering plenty of real estate for games or streaming. This year, the phone is also sandwiched with panes of Gorilla Glass Victus Plus on the front and back \u2014 a sizable upgrade over the previous Gorilla Glass 5.\nOf course, in order for Samsung to keep the Galaxy S24 FE more affordable than its proper flagship lineup, there are a few sacrifices under the hood. It swaps the overclocked Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy for the in-house Exynos 2400e pairs it with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Both the RAM and storage are in line with what we expect for the money, though the drop from a Snapdragon chipset to an Exynos one isn\u2019t as steep as some might have guessed.\nUltimately, the Galaxy S24 FE comes in as one of Samsung\u2019s best offerings. It\u2019s a better value than its predecessor, while also giving its flagship family members a run for their money thanks to its price point of under $700. You might have to get used to slightly less flexible cameras, but we\u2019d say they\u2019re worth it.\nBefore you rush out to pick one up, however, Samsung recently announced the Galaxy S24 FE. It\u2019s slightly larger than this model and comes with an Exynos processor standard across the board. We\u2019re still in the process of reviewing Samsung\u2019s latest mid-range offering, and we\u2019ll be sure to update this entry with our thoughts as soon as we finish our testing.\nWhat makes it stand out\n- High-end style: The Galaxy S24 FE picks up right where Samsung\u2019s flagships left off, pairing glossy front and back panels with a squared-off frame.\n- Flexible cameras: A classic wide/ultrawide/telephoto trio means the Galaxy S24 FE packs a wide zoom range and offers support for Expert RAW without the flagship price tag, though you\u2019ll be missing a few megapixels.\n- Updated connectivity: The Galaxy S24 FE supports modern standards, including Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 6e, and NFC for mobile payments.\nThe Samsung Galaxy A15 5G is great for people on a tight budget\nFinally, we have the best Samsung phone for those on a budget. The Galaxy A15 5G is a step up from the Galaxy A14 it replaces, and bags an excellent 6.5-inch 90Hz AMOLED screen, a MediaTek Dimensity 6100 Plus SoC, and a 5,000mAh battery with 25W charging.\nIt also includes a capable 50MP main camera, which is dragged down by its 5MP ultrawide and 2MP macro companions. Most cheap Samsung phones have underwhelming cameras, and all three have problems. However, it\u2019s a reasonable performer for its price.\nYes, the Galaxy A15 is on the lower end of Samsung\u2019s spectrum, but it\u2019s a great smartphone for the money. Perhaps the best part of the Galaxy A14 is its price, which should keep your wallet happy.\nWhat makes it stand out\n- Incredible value: The sub-$200 price tag is just right.\n- Great battery life: This phone is a true battery champion thanks to its low power hardware.\n- Headphone jack: Yes, Samsung still has one or two models with a headphone jack in 2024.\nWhat we look for in the best Samsung phones\nWe\u2019ve reviewed hundreds of Android phones over the years here at Android Authority, so we\u2019ve developed a keen eye for what you look for in a smartphone. If you\u2019re thinking of picking up a Samsung phone specifically, here\u2019s what to look for:\nLook for value\nIt\u2019s tempting to jump right for the most expensive Galaxy S25 Ultra or Z Fold 6, but these phones offer much more than most users will ever need. For that reason, we recommend the S25 Plus from the premium lineup since it hits the best price-to-performance ratio. Likewise for budget devices like the A25 5G and A35 5G.\nConsistent software\nSamsung phones all use the company\u2019s in-house One UI software, which is a slightly tweaked version of Android with extra features. They also all offer four years of version updates and five years of security updates, so even the cheapest phones will remain up to date for a long time. However, phones on the low end will show their age much sooner.\nVersatile cameras\nNowadays, megapixel counts don\u2019t mean nearly as much as software smarts, but Samsung phones are generally great performers. They all tend towards heavier saturation in photos, for better or worse. However, rather than looking for high MP counts, we recommend looking for phones with dedicated ultrawide and telephoto lenses where possible. The added versatility is a big plus in your mobile photography kit.\nBuild materials and design\nPrice is generally the deciding factor in how good a phone\u2019s build quality is, but there are a few things to look out for. For example, Gorilla Glass Victus and Gorilla Armor are much more resistant than Gorilla Glass 5, although you\u2019ll still probably want to get a case if you want it to last. Camera housings are another contentious issue design-wise, but if you are going to get a case, you won\u2019t even notice it.\nOther FAQs\nSamsung\u2019s flagship Galaxy S25 series offers the best mix of performance and discounts heading into the first few months of 2025. Some people may also prefer the cutting-edge design of the Galaxy Z Flip 6 or Z Fold 6, and the midrange Galaxy A series is impressive without the high cost.\nThe Galaxy A35 is perhaps the best value you can get in a Samsung phone right now. It offers three rear cameras, a large 5,000mAh battery, and a solid 6.6-inch Full HD Plus display for just $399.\nIt\u2019s tough to find a better value than ordering from Samsung itself. Amazon may offer faster shipping, but the Samsung website usually offers the best trade-in values and additional perks. For example, the Galaxy S25 series offered pre-order benefits that included double storage and $50 off for those who reserved their phone.\nThe Samsung Galaxy A35 5G is among the best budget phones you can buy. It offers a large, crisp display, 5G speeds, and a powerful triple-camera setup for $399.\nThe best Samsung phone for seniors is the Samsung Galaxy Folder 2. It\u2019s an affordable flip phone with a 3.8-inch screen, rear and selfie cameras, and a keyboard.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

Learn more.\nDon't wait for the Galaxy Z Flip 7, get the Motorola Razr Ultra (2025) now \u2014 here's why\nMay 28, 2025\nMotorola Razr Ultra\nMSRP: $1,299.99\nWhat we like\nWhat we don't like\nMotorola Razr Ultra\nEvery year, Motorola gets my hopes up with an exciting new Razr. It rolls out colorful new finishes, slightly revamped cameras, and the most straightforward cover screen experience one could ask for, only to be surpassed by the reliability and polish of Samsung\u2019s latest Galaxy Z Flip. Each time I finish the year, I know that the top-tier Razr has earned a place in my heart, but the Galaxy Z Flip makes more sense. Until now.\nThis year, with the Razr Ultra (a.k.a. the Razr 60 Ultra in some regions), Motorola has its winner. It\u2019s a flip phone that\u2019s decided more is more, and it delivers an experience I\u2019ve waited for ever since the Razr series came back to the US in 2023. I finally think it does enough to stay ahead of whatever changes Samsung makes to the Galaxy Z Flip 7 this year, and here\u2019s why.\nThis review will mainly focus on the Razr Ultra, but I\u2019ll also be critiquing the Razr (2025) and Razr Plus (2025) throughout so you know which one best suits your usage and budget!\nThe Razr Ultra\u2019s design is as polished as they come\nI\u2019ve said it before, and I\u2019ll probably say it again, but Motorola makes some of the best-looking phones in the game. It combines materials and colors in such a way that it makes you want to leave your phone case behind so that you can look at the latest Pantone shades. I thought that was evident enough on the 2024 Razr Plus with its rainbow of vegan leather hues, but I didn\u2019t know anything yet.\nJump to this year, and the newly introduced Razr Ultra \u2014 launched alongside 2025 refreshes of the vanilla Razr and Razr Plus \u2014 has added a few new Pantone colors to the series to pick from, but it\u2019s also added new materials like wood (on the Mountain Trail version) and Alcantara (on the Scarab version) to the mix. Yes, there are still a few vegan leather options, but how could you not be more intrigued by an ultra-premium foldable phone made of wood? That\u2019s exactly what I thought, and that\u2019s why I picked the Razr Ultra in Mountain Trail when given my choice.\nMotorola's colors have long beaten Samsung's, but a phone made of wood? I'll take two.\nAnd, after just about two weeks with my wood-paneled, bronze-finished Razr Ultra, I\u2019m as firmly in the no-case camp as I\u2019ve ever been. I\u2019m not worried about the panel splitting or splintering, and the best part about wood is that it doesn\u2019t pick up any fingerprints. So far, neither does the brushed metal frame, outside of the two flat edges around the hinge that meet when you open the Razr Ultra. Is the FSC-certified wood a little bit slippery in the hand? Yes, it has a bit less texture than Motorola\u2019s usual vegan leather, but it\u2019s not nearly as bad as some of the glossy panels I\u2019ve used in the past.\nAs much as I love the Mountain Trail version of the Razr Ultra, I have a few concerns about how a material like Alcantara might hold up on the Scarab finish. During our initial hands-on period with the 2025 Razr series, the demo units were already picking up fuzzies and dust, and I could only see that getting worse as you pull the phone out and put it away more over time. I\u2019d love to be proven wrong, but maybe there\u2019s a reason that fabric-covered phones aren\u2019t all the rage.\nOf course, what brings this year\u2019s Razr lineup closer than ever to Samsung\u2019s refined Galaxy Z Flip series isn\u2019t just that it looks good. It\u2019s that Motorola has finally improved the durability of its hinge across the board. The new hinge on all three 2025 Razrs is now titanium-reinforced to be four times stronger than stainless steel. In practice, that mostly means it feels tighter and more positionable than before, which is essential for some of the Moto AI features I\u2019ll get to in a few minutes.\nAlso vital to that Moto AI experience is the Razr Ultra\u2019s cover screen, which I think remains miles ahead of the one on Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Flip series. Not only is the panel still larger at an even 4 inches, but it\u2019s brighter at 3,000 nits of peak brightness, smoother with a 165Hz refresh rate, and tougher thanks to Corning\u2019s Gorilla Glass Ceramic. Do you need any of this on a display meant to be used quickly and put back in your pocket? Probably not, but it\u2019s nice to have. The Razr Plus\u2019 external display mirrors the same base specs (but a lower peak brightness), while the base Razr drops the size to 3.6-inches and the refresh rate to 90Hz.\nThe wide-open cover screen experience is better than Samsung\u2019s, too, if only because it makes the Razr easier to pick up and go about your day without a second thought. I\u2019ve written several times about how badly I want Samsung to ditch the reliance on Good Lock for its Flex Window experience, and every time I pick up a Razr, I\u2019m reminded just how right I am. I love that I can open any app right from the Razr Ultra\u2019s default app drawer, whether it\u2019s something productive like Slack or fun like YouTube to watch every Premier League goal from match week 37 while I sweat over Chelsea\u2019s chances of Champions League football next season.\nI watched PetaPixel review a half-frame camera on what feels like a half-frame display, and I loved it.\nThis year, Motorola has also revamped its approach to widgets on the cover screen, adding two extra customizable panels so you can fit even more information at a glance. I still prefer the well-optimized weather and Spotify panels as part of my default carousel, but I\u2019ve also set up a well-being widget with my Fitbit step count and a record of my daily screen time.\nHidden by this external excellence is another top-notch display \u2014 the largest one I\u2019ve used on a flip phone. In the name of going Ultra, Motorola bumped its main AMOLED display from 6.9 inches to an even 7 inches for the Ultra, making it larger than the iPhone 16 Pro Max, Galaxy S25 Ultra, and Pixel 9 Pro XL. Then, it brought over the same sky-high 165Hz refresh rate from the external display and paired it with an even brighter 4,500 nits of peak brightness and a crisp Super HD resolution. The Razr Plus and Razr keep things to 6.9-inches, and make some reasonable adjustments for the price differences: the Razr Plus has a peak brightness of 3,000 nits and a lower PPI overall, while the Razr drops to a 120Hz refresh rate. Thankfully, all three are gorgeous AMOLEDs.\nThe reworked hinge also means that the trio\u2019s display crease is shallower than ever, making it almost unnoticeable unless viewed at a sharp angle against the sunlight. I hardly notice the dent in the panel while gaming, either, easily dragging and dropping pieces of track across the center line as I work my way through Railbound just about three years late.\nAnd now, we have to talk about one more Razr Ultra-exclusive feature that I\u2019m not quite sold on: The AI Key. Brand-new to Motorola\u2019s top-tier flip phone this year is a dedicated button with no purpose but launching the Moto AI menu. Yes, you can remap its two gestures, choosing between Catch Me Up, Pay Attention, and opening the menu itself, but that\u2019s kind of it. Your other option is to turn the button off entirely, but then it feels like wasted space on a $1,300 flip phone. At the very least, Motorola was smart enough to put its AI Key opposite the power button, which means I haven\u2019t accidentally pressed it like I have Nothing\u2019s similarly-styled Essential Key \u2014 another fairly superfluous button, but one attached to a far more useful interpretation of this kind of feature.\nDespite my general heaping of praise on the 2025 Razr lineup, it\u2019s not without its quirks. The IP48 ratings across the board mean you\u2019ll have to be careful when taking your expensive flip phone anywhere near the beach, though it should be fine with an accidental dip into a pool. I\u2019ve also been less than impressed by the Razr Ultra\u2019s speakers at higher volumes. The stereo setup gets loud, but it\u2019s not very crisp when it gets there, losing some finer instruments from Hozier\u2019s re-release of Like Real People Do when I try to blare it over Spotify.\nThere\u2019s enough power here to make most flagships blush\nIf the only feather in Motorola\u2019s cap were that I think its Razrs look better than the Galaxy Z Flip, there wouldn\u2019t be much to write home about. That\u2019s been the case for the last few years, and if not for some key internal upgrades, I probably would have steered you toward the older models to help you save a few bucks. But, in keeping with its new Ultra branding, Motorola saw fit to pack its top-tier flagship with some of the best specs we\u2019ve ever seen on a foldable.\nThat means more \u2014 more of everything. Where the previous Razr Plus packed a Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset (and the 2025 iteration still does), the Razr Ultra now carries Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Elite. Where that same Razr Plus offered 12GB of RAM and 256GB of fixed storage, this version jumps to 16GB and 512GB at the base level, leaving the Galaxy Z Flip 6\u2019s 128GB tier even further in the dust. The Razr Ultra even comes in an optional 1TB configuration, ensuring you\u2019ll have years to make Amazon Music playlists in the Playlist Studio before you run out of space.\nAs always, though, a packed spec sheet only means so much. While I could comfortably say that the Razr Ultra felt powerful in the palm of my hand, I wanted some data to back it up. So, I set up our usual gauntlet of tests and lined up what I felt were logical competitors. This time, the Razr Ultra\u2019s alternatives included the previous Razr Plus (2024), this year\u2019s base Razr (2025), the Galaxy Z Flip 6, and, for good measure, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 Ultra. Why a candy bar-style phone known for its stylus? Well, it\u2019s the only other phone I could think of that costs $1,300, and it packs some very similar specs to the Razr Ultra.\nAnd honestly, I thought that when I added Samsung\u2019s top-end flagship to the mix, it would simply run away with the competition. After all, it doesn\u2019t have to worry about a split battery, split cooling setup, or any other typical foldable hiccups. Instead, the Razr Ultra showed me just how far Motorola has come in just a few years of revamping its flip phones. Yes, the Razr Ultra fell behind its fellow Ultra in CPU-intensive Geekbench 6 performance, but it stayed pretty much neck and neck on the more comprehensive PCMark Work test and finished above the Galaxy S25 Ultra by the end of 20 runs of our GPU-heavy Wild Life Extreme stress test. The level of stability it shows after five runs is incredibly impressive here.\nThe performance gap gets even bigger when you turn your eye from the Razr Ultra to its other hinged competitors, both in-house and from Samsung. Its Snapdragon 8 Elite chip and ample RAM run circles around the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 of the previous Razr Plus and the Dimensity 7400X that holds down Motorola\u2019s most affordable \u2014 but still very, very good for the price and form factor \u2014 Razr (2025). The jump in performance also looks like it should be large enough to hold the eventual Galaxy Z Flip 7 at bay, especially if that phone sticks with its same base RAM and tries to count on the overclocked chipset for all of its performance gains.\nAlthough I expected the Galaxy S25 Ultra to outperform even the best flip phones, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m as surprised by the rest of the Razr Ultra\u2019s performance. I use review devices for a few days before putting them through our testing wringer, just to ensure it\u2019s worked through any residual setup kinks, and the Razr Ultra was no different. I took it for a fairly busy weekend around Baltimore right out of the box, heading to a street fair that required some careful Google Maps navigation up in Remington, before biking my way back across town for a friend\u2019s birthday party in the afternoon. Despite only having a few hours under its belt, the Razr Ultra felt comfortable almost immediately, jumping from one task to the next and prompting me to set up the few Moto AI features it thought might be necessary.\nThe Razr Ultra beats every other flip phone in its path and even keeps pace with traditional ultra-flagships.\nSince that hectic first day, the weather has been a bit of a mixed bag here in Baltimore, prompting me to use the Razr Ultra a little bit differently. Although it means a bit less time outdoors with the cameras, I\u2019ve balanced it out with an increase in Gamesnacks on the cover screen and a lot more reliance on the Razr Ultra as an around-the-house companion. It\u2019s come in clutch as a faster way to set a kitchen timer without opening the cover screen, a quick way to glance at the weather before heading out for a run to test my new Garmin Forerunner 970, and I\u2019ve taken to the twist-to-launch gesture as a way to check myself in the camera rather than looking for a mirror. Is any of this life-or-death? No, but everything reminds me how much I love Motorola\u2019s straightforward cover screen experience.\nUnsurprisingly, there are still a few things on my Razr Ultra to-do list, like bringing it to an Orioles game to test everything from the camera to pulling up MLB Ballpark tickets on the cover screen, but the O\u2019s have simply been too bad for me to sit through the spring weather conditions. I\u2019ve also meant to rely on the Razr Ultra as a navigation companion and DJ for a long drive, to really test how it handles thermals when I\u2019m using it for more than an hour at a time, but seemingly endless roadwork has me too nervous to move my car and then spend an hour hunting for parking. In the meantime, I\u2019ll just be living out my civil engineering dreams while I play Railbound and wait for sunnier days.\nAs if more RAM, power, and storage weren\u2019t enough, the Razr Ultra also packs more into its battery capacity \u2014 a lot more. Where the Galaxy Z Flip 6 offers just a 4,000mAh cell, the Razr Ultra delivers 4,700mAh in a not-much-larger package. Sure, it\u2019s a few millimeters wider and taller, but it\u2019s hardly an increase that\u2019s uncomfortable in your pocket. And, when it comes to flip phones, a few extra milliamp hours never hurt anyone, so it was time to see how much that extra size really matters. I ran it through our standardized battery drain test and, once again, the Razr Ultra put its money where its mouthpiece is.\nIt set the tone across almost all of our testing categories, spending the longest time on a simulated Zoom call, recording the longest 4K video, and then spending hours looping through our video playback test. The Razr Ultra even beat the Galaxy S25 Ultra in a few sections, though nothing could match the slab phone\u2019s longevity while browsing the web. There\u2019s not much this well-built flip phone with a big old battery can\u2019t do \u2014 except for maybe last forever. The regular Razr also delivers some impressive endurance numbers, which isn\u2019t that surprising as it adds 300mAh of capacity over last year\u2019s model to hit 4,500mAh. The Razr Plus (2025), meanwhile, sticks with the same 4,000mAh cell as the 2024 version \u2014 a puzzling choice, but a solid performer nonetheless.\nOf course, the Razr Ultra\u2019s superb battery won\u2019t, in fact, last forever, but Motorola\u2019s charging setup is good enough that you won\u2019t mind. The Razr Ultra is set up with both 68W wired TurboPower charging and 30W wireless charging, both of which are class leaders in the US in the foldable space. You will need a powerful enough charger \u2014 your standard Google Pixel charger and Samsung Galaxy charger probably won\u2019t be quick enough \u2014 but it\u2019s tough to argue with raw speed. In my testing, I found that the Razr Ultra doesn\u2019t hit its peak speed for very long, likely due to the heat associated with pushing that much power, but it still filled the 4,700mAh cell almost as quickly as the Galaxy S25 Ultra filled its larger battery. The 2025 Razr Plus and Razr stick to the same charging power as their 2024 counterparts \u2014 45W wired/15W wireless and 30W wired/15W wireless, respectively \u2014 but both still run rings around the Galaxy Z Flip 6\u2019s 25W peak.\nThe Razr Ultra rights one of the Razr Plus\u2019s camera wrongs\nBy now, you\u2019ve probably picked up on the fact that the Razr Ultra is a success story of Motorola fitting more than ever into a flip phone. For the most part, that\u2019s meant taking everything good about the previous Razr Plus and kicking it up a notch. However, when it comes to the rear cameras, it seems like Motorola has realized that its old ways were probably better. This is also where I have to admit that I\u2019m not always full of the best and brightest ideas.\nWhen Motorola launched the Razr Plus in 2023, I started begging for a flip phone with a telephoto camera. I figured there was almost no chance of me using an ultrawide sensor nearly as much as Motorola expected, so it should just get rid of it. Then, for the next generation, it did. It swapped the ultrawide sensor for a 50MP telephoto with 2x optical zoom. For a second, I thought it was a brilliant decision. Then, I realized it wouldn\u2019t zoom in past 2x when you tried to use the phone closed, making it no more flexible than its predecessor, while not boosting the zoom capabilities that much.\nSo now, I\u2019m glad that Motorola has reversed course, proving that it knows just a little better about what makes the best camera phones than I do. It\u2019s brought the Razr Ultra back to a wide and ultrawide pairing, trimming both sensors with 50MP resolutions while increasing the size of its primary sensor from 1/1.95 inches to 1/1.56 inches with larger individual megapixels to boot. The new ultrawide sensor is roughly the size of last year\u2019s telephoto selection, but it\u2019s proven much more helpful with the Razr Ultra closed.\nSo, with that bit of hardware reshuffling out of the way, let\u2019s get to some camera samples. I\u2019m only sharing Ultra shots here because the 2025 Razr Plus and Razr have identical hardware and camera performance to the 2024 editions \u2014 check out my review of the previous generation for an idea of what you\u2019ll get.\nThis first row is an interesting mixed bag for me. The shot of the street fair to the left is the very first photo I captured with the Razr Ultra, and also one of my least favorites. Although the details are pretty good, the color treatment gets wonky towards the horizon, where the sky abruptly turns white. It also shows far too much saturation in the leaves of the trees and the purple of the person\u2019s shirt in the foreground.\nBoth 2x zoom samples more than make up for it, though, with the image of the boat holding great detail and some very moody contrast in the rainy Baltimore spring. I also quite like the warmer, softer tones in the image of my friend overlooking the Domino Sugar factory, as it naturally softens past the railing in front of him without feeling too artificial. The low-light sample in the middle is also fairly true to life, putting just enough glow on the brick facade without blowing out the yellowness.\nIn this row, the Razr Ultra jumps from one strength \u2014 human portraits \u2014 to another, with seemingly no complaints about the different lighting conditions. It easily picked out the edges of my friend at the same street fair pictured above, even tracing the dark shape of his watch before applying the bokeh effect. The shot of the submarine is also one of my favorites, combining just enough sharpness with carefully placed shadows under the anchor point in the foreground and the area where the hull meets the waterline. We\u2019ve seen enough smartphone cameras soften or overdo shadows, so it\u2019s nice to see the Razr Ultra treat them naturally.\nSwitching sensors to the ultrawide camera, I once again think that the Razr Ultra\u2019s performance improved over time. Although I love the memory of the beer mile on the right side, the sharpness of the new T Rowe Price headquarters (and surrounding park) and pagoda are much more impressive, as are their respective color palettes. I particularly like that the Razr Ultra is willing to let the light sources around the pagoda do their job without trying to brighten the trees or bushes in the foreground. Also, both the primary and ultrawide cameras bin to 12.5MP images by default, but you can switch to Ultra-Res for the full 50MP effect, as long as you have enough storage space.\nWith just two rear cameras, it\u2019s fair to wonder how capable the Razr Ultra\u2019s zoom setup might be. After all, Motorola boasts that its premium flip phone comes with 30x magnification, but you have to trust the mix of digital zoom and post-processing to get there. I think the proper limit is closer to the 10x zoom length if you want to maintain decent sharpness. Yes, I pushed the Razr Ultra to its 30x maximum, but both the 20x and 30x results are, shall we say, light on detail. You can still tell you\u2019re looking at the top of a tower, but you\u2019re probably not going to share either image on social media. From ultrawide to 4x zoom, I think the Razr Ultra does its job brilliantly.\nOne of the other benefits of a flip phone is that it\u2019s so easy to use the primary cameras as selfie cameras. As such, I never even touched the 50MP punch hole camera that lives on the internal 7-inch display. With much larger sensors at your disposal, why would you? I\u2019m pleased with the detail across all four images above, though I have to point out the shift in color profiles. The blue of my jacket without portrait mode is different from the color with portrait mode applied, and the red tint in my face and on the bricks is completely different between the primary camera and the ultrawide. That said, I\u2019d still rather have the bigger sensors to work with.\nThe Razr Ultra takes everything good about the Razr Plus cameras and kicks it up a notch.\nThe Razr Ultra exclusively gains Group Shot \u2014 essentially Motorola\u2019s version of the Pixel\u2019s Best Take, and an Action Shot mode that mimics what OnePlus introduced on the OnePlus 13. You can also train an AI-powered Signature Style mode on all three of the new Razrs, which automatically applies customized edits to your shots right after you press the shutter button. I expected this mode to kick in without telling it to, but it doesn\u2019t, so I\u2019m still teaching the Razr Ultra to edit to my liking. Motorola\u2019s close relationship with Google means that the Razr Ultra supports plenty of other editing features, like Magic Editor and Photo Unblur, and I\u2019m kind of glad Motorola didn\u2019t try to reinvent the wheel here.\nOn the video side, the Razr Ultra tops out with 8K resolution at 30fps or 4K at either 30 or 60fps, both of which look excellent and are well-stabilized. However, the more fun feature to write home about is camcorder mode. It now kicks in automatically if you half-close your Razr Ultra with the camera set to video mode, and the standard controls flip to a one-press touchpad when you\u2019re ready to start or stop your clip. You can then swipe up or down on the sideways trackpad to zoom in or out, and another press stops and saves your clip. It feels a little backwards to hold your phone sideways and record in a vertical 9:16 aspect ratio for social media, though, so you might have to retrain your brain a bit.\nAlso, if you want to check out full-resolution versions of the camera samples above, you can do so at this Google Drive link.\nMotorola is in AI mode, and I\u2019m okay with that\nI\u2019ve avoided (or only hinted at) it so far, but we have to talk about one more piece of Motorola\u2019s new Razr lineup: The long-awaited (or maybe dreaded) entry into the AI race. Yes, it\u2019s happened \u2014 after several months of limiting its Moto AI features to a carefully chosen beta group, wrinkles like Catch Me Up and Remember This have been unleashed upon the masses. Well, they\u2019ve been made available to anyone who buys a new Razr, at least.\nSo far, I don\u2019t hate Moto AI, which is as close to a ringing endorsement as I\u2019ll get. I\u2019m not sure that any of its elements feel necessary just yet, as I\u2019m still pretty well trained to make notes when I need to remember something, tap the Gemini app when I need to ask questions, and make my Spotify playlists by hand, but I appreciate that Motorola is trying something different. Rather than simply pushing out clones of everyone else\u2019s writing tools and image generators, Moto AI took its time to figure out how to make smaller features more helpful.\nMotorola's AI features feel more intentional than its rivals, but I haven't fallen in love yet.\nSometimes, that means bringing a sensible feature to the entire Razr lineup, like Next Move, which helps to point you towards whatever AI-powered feature might be most useful. For me, that\u2019s primarily included reminding me to use Perplexity (which comes optimized for all three Razr models) for deep research, the Playlist Studio (which only works in Amazon Music) to set the mood, and Remember This to save notes from recipes or time-sensitive emails that have come in over the last few hours. Did I have trouble finding and recognizing Next Move at first? Yes, I had to reach out and ask what the interface looked like. Has it since grown on me as a hesitant-at-best user of AI? Yes, it has.\nThe Razr Ultra-exclusive Look and Talk is the other Moto AI feature that\u2019s worked its way into my daily life. It\u2019s kind of like having an AI assistant who\u2019s always watching, ready to answer questions when you look its way. Of course, if it were always watching, that would be creepy. So instead, Look and Talk only kicks in when your Razr Ultra is in tent or stand mode, and only when you\u2019re within about an arm\u2019s reach. You\u2019ll also know that it\u2019s active, as it opens up a Gemini Live-like interface that plays back both sides of your conversation.\nUnfortunately, I\u2019ve been less convinced by a few of the Razr Ultra\u2019s other Moto AI wrinkles, like Catch Me Up and the Playlist Studio, mostly because they\u2019re too specific to stand out. The former is a great idea, letting your phone give you a quick summary of recent notifications, but it\u2019s limited by the fact that it only works for personal communications, so things like Gmail, CBS Sports updates, and Instagram likes are exempt. Motorola\u2019s Playlist Studio is similarly interesting, using AI to generate a playlist based on whatever mood you describe, but then you can only export it to Amazon Music \u2014 and I\u2019m not about to ditch Spotify and my well-trained algorithm.\nIt also seems like Motorola isn\u2019t entirely sure how it would like you to activate Moto AI. Yes, the Razr Ultra has its dedicated AI key, but you can also access Gemini via the power button, open the Moto AI menu via an on-screen button, or launch it from the standard Moto AI app. It\u2019s like Motorola wants you to try Moto AI one way or another, and it\u2019s hoping that more access points and more features are the solution.\nMotorola Razr Ultra review: Finally, a flip phone without training wheels\nAt the end of the day, all I think Motorola had to do to make me happy was make a flip phone without compromise. The Razr Ultra is that flip phone. Yes, it\u2019s extremely expensive \u2014 matching the price of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 Ultra \u2014 and yes, I still feel like many of its Moto AI features feel unnecessary and unfinished, but it\u2019s hard to find a single part of the spec sheet where Motorola shied away from giving its new foldable flagship just a little bit more. The only real complaint I have centers on the update guarantee, which sits at a measly three years of major Android updates and four years of security patches. Come on, Motorola, you have to do better in 2025.\nOutside of that, though, the Razr Ultra checks every box and then some. It\u2019s the best-looking flip phone to date, offers the fastest charging in the US, the most durable glass for its cover screen, and has an updated hinge that makes Motorola\u2019s already-shallow crease even better. Pack the biggest battery into its slim leather, wood, or Alcantara-backed body and add a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset with 16GB of RAM, and this is one of the better examples of a smartphone living up to its Ultra moniker. I love that Hello UX remains light and smooth, and I\u2019ll keep recommending Motorola\u2019s cover screen interface over Samsung\u2019s until the Galaxy Z Flip unites its app drawer and dumps the odd folder-shaped design.\nMotorola's Razr Ultra has almost no compromises, making it the flip phone I've always wanted.\nYet this is a flip phone with a base configuration that costs $1,300. That\u2019s a lot of money \u2014 like, a lot. You can get Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 Ultra for that price, along with its more powerful cameras, S Pen, and equally durable design. However, the more important rival to consider once you\u2019ve balked at the Razr Ultra\u2019s sky-high price is Motorola\u2019s own Razr (2025) ($599.99 at Amazon). It costs only about half as much as the Razr Ultra, yet delivers a solid pair of cameras, many of the same Moto AI features, and a matching update commitment. Again, it\u2019s still not a great commitment, but you\u2019re saving a lot of money.\nI went so far as to say that Razr (2025) should be your pick if you\u2019re in the market for your first foldable phone, and I stand by that statement. It charges faster than the Galaxy Z Flip 6, picks better color options and finishes, and has the same cover screen experience that I loved on the Razr Ultra \u2014 even if it\u2019s on a 3.6-inch display instead of a 4-inch one. The base Razr also picked up a chipset upgrade, going from the Dimensity 7300X to 7400X, while its middle sibling, the Razr Plus, stayed the same as its 2024 predecessor.\n- Solid performance\n- Improved hinge\n- New Pantone color options\n- Flexible cameras\n- Excellent price\n- Slower charging than other Razrs\n- Limited software update commitment\nIn fact, the Razr Plus (2025) ($999.99 at Amazon) is essentially the same phone as the 2024 version, just with an improved hinge, new colors, and AI features. It\u2019s still a great phone, but with the regular Razr enjoying similar upgrades and some extra buffs, plus the introduction of the Ultra, the Plus feels a little less inspiring this time around.\n- Improved hinge\n- Charges faster than Galaxy Z Flip\n- Solid primary camera\n- Extremely limited upgrades over 2024 model\n- Mediocre software commitment\n- Less interesting colors than base Razr and Razr Ultra\nIf you\u2019ve spent much of your Android career with a Samsung Galaxy phone in your pocket, you might feel more at home switching to the Galaxy Z Flip 6 ($1099.99 at Samsung). Although I didn\u2019t love that it stayed so similar to the previous Galaxy Z Flip 5, I\u2019m willing to admit that Samsung knows a thing or two about build quality. The Galaxy Z Flip feels tight and sturdy, and it\u2019s easy to position at almost any angle when you need it in tent or stand mode. It will get a few more software updates than the latest crop of Razrs, it\u2019s true, but you\u2019ll have to live with slower charging, a slightly stunted Flex Window experience (though Samsung\u2019s widgets are excellent), and somewhat less impressive internal and external displays.\nOf course, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 could pull it out of the bag and really deliver a true ultra-tier flip foldable this year (even if the rumors aren\u2019t all that promising), breaking the cycle of Samsung\u2019s diminishing returns. If it were me, though, I\u2019d buy the Razr Ultra right now, and I wouldn\u2019t look back.\n- Blisteringly fast charging and excellent battery life\n- Ultra-flagship-tier performance\n- Solid dual camera setup\n- Top-notch materials and eye-catching Pantone colors\n- Two very vibrant displays\n- Clean, simple software\n- Moto AI feels half baked\n- Limited software commitment\n- Long-range zoom kinda stinks\n- Expensive\nThank you for being part of our community.

Learn more.\nWhat is Google Messages and how to use it\nApril 21, 2025\nUnless you\u2019ve sought out an alternative, the default SMS app on your Android device is probably called Messages, with two blue speech bubbles overlapping on a white background. This is Google Messages, and it usually comes pre-installed on most Android phones. But what exactly is the Google Messages app, and how do you use it? This is your complete guide.\nWe\u2019ll give you a quick overview of Google Messages, how it works, and why you might find it preferable to third-party messaging apps.\nWhat is Google Messages?\nIt used to be known as Android Messages and has been a feature of Android phones since 2014, but it\u2019s undergone significant upgrades in recent years. RCS, which stands for Rich Communication Services, was integrated into the service towards the end of the 2010s, allowing the transfer of longer messages, better-quality images and videos, and much more.\nFrom there, Messages for Web and end-to-end encryption were introduced, and the service has been further enhanced in recent months. Now you can use Google Messages to do most things that you might be familiar with from third-party apps like WhatsApp, such as start group chats, reply to specific messages, give emoji reactions to messages, and so on.\nIt also has features that other messaging services don\u2019t offer \u2014 more on that later.\nHow does Google Messages work?\nGoogle Messages not only comes pre-installed on most new Android phones, but it\u2019s usually also set as the default messaging app. At its most basic level, it will display SMS and MMS messages that you receive through your network operator, but this is now the fallback option in terms of message transmission.\nAs long as you and the person you\u2019re communicating with have the appropriate feature enabled, RCS messages will be exchanged via your Wi-Fi or cellular data connection. This is what allows for the encryption of messages and larger filer transfers to happen.\nIn the event that either party doesn\u2019t have an internet connection or the RCS feature is disabled, Google Messages will revert to sending and receiving messages via SMS or MMS \u2014 unless you tell it not to.\nWhat are the benefits of using Google Messages?\n- Enabling RCS messaging while maintaining SMS as the default setting\n- Displaying message status, similar to other apps\n- Incorporating unique features like scheduled, nudged messages, and voice message transcriptions\n- Enhancing efficiency within the Google ecosystem\nThe benefits of Google Messages over old-school SMS and MMS messages quickly become obvious. As mentioned above, using RCS messaging over your Wi-Fi or cellular connection allows for larger and more varied files to be sent, such as video clips, GIFs, documents, and so on. It also allows for these messages to be easily encrypted, and while it may use some of your data if you\u2019re not on a Wi-Fi connection, it spares your SMS allowance.\nGoogle Messages offers other benefits that we\u2019ve come to enjoy on most messaging apps. You can see a \u201cdelivered\u201d and \u201cread\u201d status on sent messages, respond to specific messages in a chain, see if someone is typing, react to messages with emojis, and much more. If you think of something you can do in apps like Telegram or WhatsApp, the chances are that you can probably do it, or something similar, in Google Messages.\nGet transcriptions of voice messages so that you don't need to play them.\nHowever, there are also features that, if not unique to Google Messages, at least aren\u2019t as common in other messaging services. For instance, you can schedule messages if you want them to be sent at a later time, or you can get \u2018nudged\u2019 as a reminder of a birthday or a message you haven\u2019t responded to in a while. You can also get transcriptions of voice messages so that you don\u2019t need to play them.\nThen there\u2019s the trump card: the Google ecosystem. Tight integration with other Google apps such as Calendar, Maps, YouTube, Photos, or Assistant adds proprietary value to the service. One-tap calendar reminders are a good example, as well as the option to send videos as a Google Photos link, saving the data usage of transmitting the video itself.\nGoogle Messages is largely excellent but far from perfect. Notable downsides include occasionally inconsistent RCS support depending on your carrier and contacts, lack of integration with iMessage, limited customization options compared to third-party apps, and a fairly slow rollout of new features.\nHow to use Google Messages\nThere\u2019s a long list of features available in Google Messages, but you don\u2019t need to be familiar with many of them to use the app effectively. To get started, it\u2019s just a case of downloading the app from the Play Store and then setting it as your default messaging app when prompted. Even this is unlikely to be necessary as your Android device almost certainly already has the app, and it\u2019s probably already your default.\nTo get chatting, simply open the app and press on the chat bubble in the bottom-right corner of the screen. You can then choose a contact and start tapping out your message.\nBefore that, though, you\u2019ll probably want to ensure that Chat features are enabled. It might well be enabled by default, but it\u2019s worth checking because this is the key feature that allows for the expanded functionality you\u2019re used to in third-party messaging apps, such as typing indicators and read receipts.\nYou\u2019ll likely be prompted to enable chat features when you first open the app. If not, follow the following steps:\n- Press your profile image in the top-right corner of the app.\n- Tap Messages settings.\n- Select the RCS chats option.\n- Ensure that the Turn on RCS chats toggle is switched on.\nYou\u2019ll notice while you\u2019re on this screen that you can make other key decisions about the app\u2019s functionality, such as whether RCS messages should be sent by SMS or MMS if they can\u2019t be sent via a data connection. Play around with the options a bit to customize the experience to your taste.\nNow that the chat features are sorted, you\u2019re ready to go. You\u2019ll no doubt discover new features on the fly, and many more are still being rolled out.\nThe button below takes you to the Play Store, where you can download Google Messages for Android. There isn\u2019t an iOS app available at the time of writing \u2014 Apple doesn\u2019t allow third-party SMS apps.\nHow to use Google Messages on the web\nGoogle Messages has a web browser akin to the likes of WhatsApp Web. It\u2019s easy to set up and makes typing out longer messages from your computer much easier. Here\u2019s how you get started:\n- On your PC or laptop, navigate to the Messages by Google website.\n- Click Messages for web. You\u2019ll be presented with a QR code and some instructions.\n- On your mobile device, tap your profile picture in the top-right corner of the screen.\n- Select Device pairing.\n- Press the Switch to QR pairing button.\n- Tap QR code scanner.\n- Use the scanner on your device to scan the QR code on your computer screen.\nYou\u2019re in, and you\u2019ll see your messages on the screen, with various features from the mobile app also available. One of the first things you might be interested in adjusting is the theme, depending if you\u2019re a Light Mode or Dark Mode type of person.\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that both your phone and computer need to have an active internet connection to use the browser version of Google Messages.\nTips and tricks for using Google Messages\nWe\u2019ve covered the basics of how to use Google Messages, but knowing about a few of the features can significantly improve your user experience. What should you do first? What features can save you valuable seconds? We\u2019ve singled out a few of our favorite aspects of the app that might be handy for you.\nVoice transcription\nWhether you love or hate voice messages, there are some situations in which it isn\u2019t convenient to listen to them. A useful solution from Google Messages is that you can automatically transcribe voice messages so that you can read them like regular messages.\nTo enable voice transcription, open the app and tap Profile picture > Message settings > Voice transcription and toggle the feature on.\nSwipe actions\nYou can change what happens to a message in the app when you swipe it left or right. While the only options are to delete or archive the message, it might save you time if you find yourself wading through a batch of messages. You can also turn off swipe actions if you\u2019re prone to accidentally swiping conversations into the archive.\nTo customize or disable the swiple actions, go to Profile picture > Message settings > Swipe actions and choose an action for left and right swiping.\nOTP deletion\nYou might find your inbox filling up with one-time passwords (OTPs) that become redundant soon after you\u2019ve used them. Google Messages has a feature that deletes all OTP messages automatically 24 hours after receiving them, uncluttering your conversation list.\nTo enable OTP deletion, head to Profile picture > Message settings > Message organization and hit the toggle for Auto-delete OTPs.\nSuggestions\nGoogle Messages has a level of AI assistance that can make suggestions as to how to respond to a message you\u2019ve received or to offer you actions you might want to perform. This could be as simple as suggesting a quick response you can send in the form of a quick tap, suggesting you share your location when you send a location, or adding an event to your Google Calendar.\nEach aspect of the suggestions can be toggled on or off to your preference. To find the options, go to Profile picture > Message settings > Suggestions and then start customizing the suggestions to suit your needs.\nBubbles\nIf bubbles are enabled, you\u2019ll see active Google Message conversations in chat bubbles that overlap your home screen or another app that you\u2019re using. They\u2019re enabled by default, and given how annoying they can be, you\u2019re more likely to be trying to work out how to turn them off. Disabling bubbles is easy, or you can set it so that only certain conversations appear in bubbles.\nTo adjust your bubble preferences, tap Profile picture > Message settings > Bubbles and make your selection.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nGoogle Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL are here: Specs, price, colors, everything else!\nApril 1, 2025\nThe Google Pixel 8 series was the company\u2019s best flagship series to date when it debuted in 2023, topping lists for some of the best Android phones you can buy. But the Pixel 9 series takes things up a notch. For the first time, this generation\u2019s lineup comes with four models, namely the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\nIn this extensive guide, we\u2019ll go over what\u2019s new with the vanilla version, Pro, and Pro XL \u2014 check out our dedicated Pixel 9 Pro Fold hub for more information on Google\u2019s new foldable. Without further ado, let\u2019s jump right in and discuss everything you need to know about the Google Pixel 9 series!\nExcellent build quality, refined design\nExtensive update policy\nExcellent build quality\nFlexible, capable cameras\nReliable update commitment\nGorgeous display\nSeven years of software updates\nGoogle Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL: Release date, price, and availability\n- Google Pixel 9 (128GB): $799 / \u00a3799\n- Google Pixel 9 (256GB): $899 / \u00a3899\n- Google Pixel 9 Pro (128GB): $999 / \u00a3999\n- Google Pixel 9 Pro (256GB): $1,099 / \u00a31,099\n- Google Pixel 9 Pro (512GB): $1,219 / \u00a31,219\n- Google Pixel 9 Pro (1TB): $1,499 / \u00a31,449\n- Google Pixel 9 Pro XL (128GB): $1,099 / \u00a31,099\n- Google Pixel 9 Pro XL (256GB): $1,199 / \u00a31,199\n- Google Pixel 9 Pro XL (512GB): $1,319 / \u00a31,319\n- Google Pixel 9 Pro XL (1TB): $1,549 / \u00a31,549\nGoogle let it be known weeks in advance that it would launch the Pixel 9 series on August 13, 2024, and it followed through on that schedule. As always, the launch was part of Google\u2019s annual Made by Google event, which took place at the company\u2019s Mountain View headquarters.\nInitially, the Pixel line made a name for itself by offering a flagship-level device at a surprisingly affordable price. Unfortunately, slowly and steadily, these handsets have been getting increasingly expensive. In 2023, Google raised the prices of the Pixel line by $100. It has once again raised prices, but this time, only for the base model. The Pixel 9, 9 Pro, and the new 9 Pro XL start at $799, $999, and $1,099, respectively. Depending on where you purchase the XL, you may be able to get it at a lower price.\nWhile pre-orders have opened, you\u2019ll have to wait for on-shelf availability. In the US, the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL will hit store shelves on August 22. The wait will be a little longer for the Pixel 9 Pro rollout, which is scheduled to be generally available sometime in September.\nThe Pixel 9 series is available in all the usual markets where Pixel phones are sold. That includes the United States (including Puerto Rico), Canada, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Australia, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan.\nGoogle Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL: Specs\nIf you\u2019re looking for a generational leap, the Pixel 9 series was given a handful of notable improvements over its predecessor. This includes factors like the display size, processor, battery, charging speeds, and so on. To get a sense of how it stacks up to the previous generation, be sure to check out our Pixel 8 vs Pixel 9 comparison.\nAs for how each Pixel 9 device compares to one another, here\u2019s a full spec sheet offering every detail you need to know:\n| Pixel 9 | Pixel 9 Pro | Pixel 9 Pro XL | |\n|---|---|---|---|\nDisplay | Pixel 9 6.3-inch OLED, 1,080 x 2,424 resolution, 422 PPI, 60-120Hz refresh rate, 20:9 aspect ratio, 2,700 nits peak brightness | Pixel 9 Pro 6.3-inch LTPO OLED, 1,280 x 2,856 resolution, 495 PPI, 1-120Hz refresh rate, 20:9 aspect ratio, 3,000 nits peak brightness | Pixel 9 Pro XL 6.8-inch LTPO OLED, 1,344 x 2,992 resolution, 486 PPI, 1-120Hz refresh rate, 20:9 aspect ratio, 3,000 nits peak brightness |\nProcessor | Pixel 9 Tensor G4 | Pixel 9 Pro Tensor G4 | Pixel 9 Pro XL Tensor G4 |\nRAM | Pixel 9 12GB | Pixel 9 Pro 16GB | Pixel 9 Pro XL 16GB |\nStorage | Pixel 9 128GB / 256GB | Pixel 9 Pro 128GB / 256GB / 512GB / 1TB | Pixel 9 Pro XL 128GB / 256GB / 512GB / 1TB |\nBattery | Pixel 9 4,700mAh | Pixel 9 Pro 4,700mAh | Pixel 9 Pro XL 5,060mAh |\nPower | Pixel 9 27W wired charging Wireless charging Battery Share | Pixel 9 Pro 27W wired charging Wireless charging Battery Share | Pixel 9 Pro XL 37W wired charging Wireless charging Battery Share |\nCameras | Pixel 9 Rear: - 50MP wide camera, \u0192/1.68, 82-degree FoV, 1/1.31\" sensor - 48MP ultrawide camera, \u0192/1.7, 123-degree FoV, 1/2.55\" sensor Front: 10.5MP, \u0192/2.2, 95-degree FoV | Pixel 9 Pro Rear: - 50MP wide camera, \u0192/1.68, 82-degree FoV, 1/1.31\" sensor - 48MP ultrawide camera, \u0192/1.7, 123-degree FoV, 1/2.55\" sensor - 48MP telephoto camera, \u0192/2.8, 22-degree FoV, 5x optical zoom, 1/2.55\" sensor Front: 42MP, \u0192/2.2, 103-degree FoV | Pixel 9 Pro XL Rear: - 50MP wide camera, \u0192/1.68, 82-degree FoV, 1/1.31\" sensor - 48MP ultrawide camera, \u0192/1.7, 123-degree FoV, 1/2.55\" sensor - 48MP telephoto camera, \u0192/2.8, 22-degree FoV, 5x optical zoom, 1/2.55\" sensor Front: 42MP, \u0192/2.2, 103-degree FoV |\nVideo | Pixel 9 Rear: 4K (24/30/60 FPS) 1080p (24/30/60 FPS) Front: 4K (30/60 FPS) | Pixel 9 Pro Rear: 4K (24/30/60 FPS) 1080p (24/30/60 FPS) Front: 4K (30/60 FPS) | Pixel 9 Pro XL Rear: 4K (24/30/60 FPS) 1080p (24/30/60 FPS) Front: 4K (30/60 FPS) |\nConnectivity | Pixel 9 5G (mmWave + Sub6) Wi-Fi 7 (802.11/be) Bluetooth 5.3 (dual antenna) | Pixel 9 Pro 5G (mmWave + Sub6) Wi-Fi 7 (802.11/be) Bluetooth 5.3 (dual antenna) Ultra-wideband chip | Pixel 9 Pro XL 5G (mmWave + Sub6) Wi-Fi 7 (802.11/be) Bluetooth 5.3 (dual antenna) Ultra-wideband chip |\nSIM | Pixel 9 Dual SIM (Single Nano SIM and eSIM) | Pixel 9 Pro Dual SIM (Single Nano SIM and eSIM) | Pixel 9 Pro XL Dual SIM (Single Nano SIM and eSIM) |\nSecurity | Pixel 9 Face Unlock (Class 3) Ultrasonic under-display fingerprint sensor Titan M2 chip | Pixel 9 Pro Face Unlock (Class 3) Ultrasonic under-display fingerprint sensor Titan M2 chip | Pixel 9 Pro XL Face Unlock (Class 3) Ultrasonic under-display fingerprint sensor Titan M2 chip |\nDurability | Pixel 9 IP68 Gorilla Glass Victus 2 | Pixel 9 Pro IP68 Gorilla Glass Victus 2 | Pixel 9 Pro XL IP68 Gorilla Glass Victus 2 |\nSoftware | Pixel 9 Android 14 7 years of OS, security, and Pixel Drop updates | Pixel 9 Pro Android 14 7 years of OS, security, and Pixel Drop updates | Pixel 9 Pro XL Android 14 7 years of OS, security, and Pixel Drop updates |\nDimensions and weight | Pixel 9 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.5mm 198g | Pixel 9 Pro 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.5mm 199g | Pixel 9 Pro XL 162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5mm 221g |\nColors | Pixel 9 Obsidian Porcelain Wintergreen Peony | Pixel 9 Pro Obsidian Porcelain Hazel Rose Quartz | Pixel 9 Pro XL Obsidian Porcelain Hazel Rose Quartz |\nGoogle Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL: Features\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a new Pixel launch without a slate of hardware and software upgrades. But what exactly has changed between last year and now? Google has fitted these phones with a bevy of features and they\u2019re slated to receive even more in future Pixel Feature Drops. But for now, let\u2019s keep our focus on what you\u2019re getting out of the box and in the near future.\nCamera\nSince the Pixel series hangs its hat on photography, let\u2019s first discuss the camera situation. Pixel phones are usually considered among the best camera phones money can buy. This is supported not only by the quality lenses sitting inside the camera bump, but also by the computational photography Google specializes in. Let\u2019s get into the specifics, starting with the Pixel 9 and moving our way up.\nThe base model has a 50MP primary camera with Octa PD \u2014 an auto-focus method used for large-sized sensors to achieve high sensitivity and high resolution. It has the same aperture (\u0192/1.68), field of view (82 degrees), and sensor size (1/1.31 inches) as the Pixel 8. In addition, the front camera, which is a 10.5MP lens, is also recycled from last year\u2019s model. But don\u2019t expect the whole camera array to be a copy, as the ultrawide has been upgraded from 12MP to 48MP. This ultrawide lens has an aperture of \u0192/1.7, FoV of 123 degrees, and a 1/2.55-inch sensor.\nThe Pixel 9 series should continue Google's excellent track record for making top-tier camera phones.\nNext, we have the Pixel 9 Pro that features a triple camera setup as it always has. That setup includes the same main and ultrawide cameras found in the entry model, but adds a 48MP telephoto to the mix with a \u0192/2.8 aperture, 22-degree FoV, and 1/2.55-inch sensor. However, we do get treated to an improved front camera. While the Pixel 8 Pro shared the same front camera as the Pixel 8, the Pixel 9 Pro jumps up from 10.5MP to 42MP with an \u0192/2.2 aperture and 103-degree ultrawide FoV. For the Pro XL, you\u2019ll be getting the same camera equipment you get with the Pixel 9 Pro.\nPerformance\nThe Pixel 9 series marks the debut of Tensor G4, the latest Google-designed processor. If everything plays out the way it should, this is likely the final Tensor chipset based on Samsung\u2019s Exynos design. It\u2019s believed that the next Tensor SoC will be entirely created from scratch and based on a TSMC processor node. But we\u2019re not here to talk about that right now, let\u2019s focus our attention on Tensor G4.\nAs expected, Tensor G4 makes improvements across the board in terms of performance. For example, web browsing is 20% faster, app launches are 17% faster, and the phone is more efficient for everyday use cases like taking photos or streaming content.\nTo accomplish these feats, the chip has been fitted with a number of upgrades, such as the new Samsung Modem 5400. Compared to the Samsung Modem 5300 in the Pixel 8 series, this modem is faster and more power efficient. In addition, the Tensor G4 has a more conventional 4+3+1 arrangement than the Tensor G3\u2019s 4+4+1 and uses newer ARMv9.2 cores from Arm (Cortex-A520, Cortex-A720, and Cortex-X4). These changes were made to help the unit run cooler and boost performance.\nMoving on to RAM and storage, RAM has gone up while the storage configurations are the same as before. That means the vanilla Pixel 9 gets 128GB or 256GB of storage but is now paired with 12GB of RAM. The Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL get 16GB of RAM with your choice of 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB for storage.\nIf you\u2019re wondering why RAM has been increased across the board, it likely has to do with Google\u2019s AI features, as the technology can be rather demanding in the power department. As usual, storage is not expandable on the Pixel 9 series, so be sure to get the model with the most storage you can afford.\nScreen quality and size\nThe Pixel 9 series is slightly larger than the last generation, which allowed Google to fit in larger displays this time around. These displays have a few advantages over last year\u2019s lineup. Let\u2019s get into the specifics of what\u2019s different in 2024.\nThe Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro have many similarities, but the display is one area where they differ. Focusing on the Pixel 9, the OLED screen has grown 0.1 inches from last year to 6.3-inch. This Actua panel has a pixel density of 422 PPI, a resolution of 2,424 x 1,080, and a 60-120Hz refresh rate. Other than the refresh rate, which is the same, these are all upgrades compared to its predecessor. It also manages to improve the brightness, being capable of reaching a peak of 2,700 nits.\nWhich Pixel 9 series model is the better buy?\nThe Pixel 9 Pro\u2019s OLED display is also 6.3-inch, however, this handset uses an LTPO Super Actua screen. This means that Google\u2019s phone can get very bright \u2014 peaking at 3,000 nits \u2014 without sacrificing color vividness or clarity. It is also capable of dropping its 120Hz frame rate down to 1Hz for viewing static content, which can help save battery life. Choosing this phone over the base model will also get you a better resolution at 2,856 x 1,280 and more pixel density (495 PPI).\nMeanwhile, the Pixel 9 Pro XL sets itself apart from the rest with a 6.8-inch OLED LTPO Super Actua display. Interestingly, this display boasts a lower pixel density than the Pro model, at 486 PPI. However, you likely won\u2019t notice the difference, especially given the fact that the panel has a higher resolution, at 2,992 x 1,344. Just like the Pro, it has 3,000 nits of brightness, and the refresh rate maxes out at 120Hz but can dip as low as 1Hz.\nThere is one thing that all three models share, and that is the aspect ratio. Just like in 2023, the new Pixel family has a 20:9 aspect ratio.\nDesign, colors, and build quality\nThis year, Google arguably made the biggest design change to the Pixel since the Pixel 6. While not as drastic, the 2024 model transforms the handset\u2019s camera bar, which has become a defining feature for the line, into an oval-shaped camera pill. Furthermore, the squared-off edges used in previous generations have been sidelined for something a little more curvy, somewhat akin to the Pixel 8a. Along with the flat sides, the overall design appears to be inspired by Apple\u2019s iPhone.\nIn terms of dimensions, there\u2019s been a change in this area as well. When the Pixel 8 launched, it was smaller than the Pixel 7, but Google seems to have reversed course for the Pixel 9. The base and Pro models are slightly taller, wider, and less thick than the Pixel 8, measuring 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.5mm. This also means that the Pro version is smaller, slimmer, and less thick than the Pixel 8 Pro. However, there\u2019s an almost negligible difference between the Pixel 8 Pro and the Pixel 9 Pro XL which comes in at 162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5mm.\nThe Pixel 9 series makes some big changes to the Pixel aesthetic.\nMeanwhile, the flat display makes a return, as well as Gorilla Glass. The two biggest differences between this year and last year in terms of the panel are the increased screen sizes and now Gorilla Glass Victus 2 is applied across the line. Speaking of the screen sizes, the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro are now 6.3-inches and the Pro XL is 6.8-inches.\nMoving our attention to the build quality, Gorilla Glass Victus 2 can be found on both the front and back of the hardware. On the vanilla model, the glass has a polished finish, while the 9 Pro and Pro XL sport a silky matte finish. You can also expect a water and dust resistance rating of IP68. Although all three phones up Google\u2019s durability pedigree, you\u2019ll want to snag a suitable case. Thankfully, there are plenty of Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro cases, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL cases, too.\nAs for the colors, Google is offering an extra option for all three models, bringing the total colorways to four. Each model will get Obsidian (black) and Porcelain (white), but there will be a few model-specific colors. The Pixel 9 will be losing Rose (dull pink) and Hazel (light gray/greenish) from last year, which are being replaced by Wintergreen (light green) and Peony (reddish pink). Meanwhile, the Pro and Pro XL lose Bay (blue), but gain Hazel and Rose Quartz (light pink).\nBattery life and charging speed\nIf you were hoping that Google would up the ante when it comes to the Pixel\u2019s battery, you\u2019ll be pleased to know the battery capacity has been increased. However, it may not be as big of a leap forward as you may have liked.\nStarting with the Pixel 9, Google gave its entry-level handset a 4,700mAh battery. This means that the Pixel 9\u2019s battery capacity is 125mAh higher than the Pixel 8\u2019s 4,575mAh battery. While it is nice to see the increase, you probably won\u2019t notice that much of a difference in real life. As far as charging is concerned, Google is still playing it safe with a 27W charging speed that can get you up to 55% full after 30 minutes.\nNext, we have the Pixel 9 Pro, which actually gets a bit of a downgrade. Like the base model, the Pro comes with a 4,700mAh battery, down from last year\u2019s 5,050mAh. This is likely due to the fact that the Pro has the same dimensions as the vanilla version. On top of that, the device also shares a charging speed of 27W.\nThe 9 Pro XL, on the other hand, has a build that\u2019s more similar to last year\u2019s 8 Pro. As such, this bigger phone comes with a larger 5,060mAh battery, a slight increase compared to the Pixel 8 Pro. For those wanting faster charging, this may be the Pixel you\u2019ve been waiting for, given its 37W charging rate. In the span of 30 minutes, Google says your battery should gain 70% of its juice back.\nThe tech giant didn\u2019t forget about wireless charging. All three models are 12W Qi-certified, so your wireless charger will still work. If you have the 2nd generation Pixel Stand with you, you can get 15W wireless charging on the Pixel 9, 21W wireless on the Pixel 9 Pro, and 23W wireless charging on the Pixel 9 Pro XL.\nAlso returning is Battery Share, which allows you to use the phone\u2019s battery to charge up other devices, such as the newly announced Pixel Buds Pro 2.\nThere\u2019s no charger in the box for either of these phones, but Google is also launching a 45W charger that can be purchased separately for $29.99. This charger will be available in all markets where the Pixel is sold. Interestingly, the fastest charging speed on the Pixel 9 series is 37W. Of course, you don\u2019t actually need Google\u2019s official charger as any 40W+ USB Power Delivery PPS charger will do the job nicely \u2014 check out our best wall charger and best Google Pixel 9 charger recommendations if you need one.\nSoftware and updates\nOne of the biggest surprises of the Pixel 9 series launch was the realization that it is arriving with Android 14 and not Android 15. Until now, every new Pixel launch has coincided with the rollout of a new Android version. If you\u2019re worried about whether this will count toward your major OS updates, you don\u2019t need to be. Google\u2019s update promise is linked to years, not a specific number.\nRegarding Google\u2019s update promise, every Pixel 9 model gets seven years of OS, security, and feature drop updates. This is the same number of years as promised for the Pixel 8 series, and it should still be plenty of support for most people.\nOn top of everything else, getting a Pixel 9 series will net you VPN by Google. This is a benefit you\u2019ll be able to enjoy for free, regardless of what model you purchase.\nFAQ\nNo, the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, nor the Pixel 9 Pro XL have microSD card slots. This is something Pixel phones have lacked for a long time.\nNo, the Pixel 9 series is not waterproof, but it is water-resistant with an IP68 rating. This means it can be submerged in water of up to 1.5m for up to 30 minutes, not indefinitely.\nNo. Like most phones these days, the Pixel line lost its headphone jack years ago and it hasn\u2019t come back.\nThank you for being part of our community.
