      "text": "Elon Musk has revealed that Tesla's long-anticipated robotaxi service will launch in Austin, Texas, on June 22. He described it as the company's most significant product so far.\nThe launch, which has been delayed for years, is expected to begin with around 10 self-driving cars and could expand rapidly if it proceeds smoothly.\nAccording to AP, Musk posted on X (formerly Twitter) that the rollout date is tentative, saying Tesla is being \"super paranoid about safety.\"\nThe robotaxis will initially operate only in geofenced areas of Austin\u2014specific parts of the city deemed safe enough for self-driving vehicles. Tesla's cars will be monitored remotely in real time.\nThis move comes at a time when Tesla's profits have fallen sharply. Tesla reported a net income of $7 billion last year, representing a 53% decrease from the previous year. Musk and investors believe robotaxis could change that.\nHe told investors earlier this year, \"I think this will be the largest asset value increase in human history.\"\nThe robotaxi service will initially use modified Model Y SUVs. A new version of the robotaxi with no steering wheel or pedals\u2014called the Cybercab\u2014is not expected until 2026.\nTesla's self-driving system, known as Full Self-Driving (FSD), relies on cameras and artificial intelligence, rather than the lidar sensors used by other companies, such as Google's Waymo.\nRead more: Tesla Special Committee To Review Elon Musk's Compensation Package Amid $56B Pay Deal Appeal\nTesla's Robotaxi Isn't on the Road\u2014But Waymo Already Is\nWaymo is already a step ahead, offering 250,000 paid robotaxi rides each week across four US cities, including Austin.\nExperts like Bryant Walker Smith from Stanford say companies like Waymo have built robust systems, while Tesla is still catching up, according to CNN. \"There are real robotaxis on the road today. None of them is a Tesla,\" Smith said.\nStill, Musk remains confident. In an April earnings call, he said, \"I don't see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present... Tesla will have 99% market share or something ridiculous.\"\nBut there are safety concerns. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is currently investigating Tesla's FSD after reports of crashes, including one that killed a pedestrian. The car had trouble in low-visibility conditions, like glare and fog.\nMusk has rejected criticism of Tesla's camera-only system, calling lidar \"friggin stupid.\" However, experts argue that lidar is more reliable in spotting hazards, especially in poor visibility conditions.\nDespite the hype, some believe the June 22 launch is more about proving a concept than launching a full-service. Analyst Gordon Johnson called it \"a Tesla proof of concept exercise, not a rollout.\"\nJoin the Conversation"

      "text": "Elon Musk\u2019s AI venture, xAI, is reportedly on the brink of securing a $5 billion debt raise, led by Morgan Stanley, despite modest investor interest.\nWhat Happened: The $5 billion debt offering\u2014comprising a floating-rate term loan, a fixed-rate loan, and secured bonds\u2014is scheduled to be allocated to investors on Wednesday, reported Reuters, citing sources. The sale, announced on June 2, failed to generate strong interest from high-yield and leveraged loan investors.\nThe floating-rate loan carries an interest rate of 700 basis points above the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, while the fixed-rate loan and secured notes are expected to yield around 12%, according to the report. This is significantly above the average yield-to-maturity for high-yield bonds, which stood at 7.6% as of Monday's close.\nInvestor orders were approximately 1.5 times the available debt, lower than the usual 2.5 to 3 times observed in similar junk bond deals. Unlike Musk\u2019s debt deal for his Twitter acquisition, Morgan Stanley neither guaranteed the sale amount nor committed any of its own capital to the transaction, the report added.\nxAI did not immediately respond to Benzinga\u2019s request for comment.\nWhy It Matters: The debt raise comes amid a series of significant developments for xAI. The company is also in discussions to raise approximately $20 billion in equity, potentially valuing the company at over $120 billion. This follows the current $5 billion debt package.\nxAI\u2019s debt raise also raises concerns due to the company\u2019s financial status and Musk\u2019s track record. The company is not yet rated, providing investors with little visibility into its finances and posing a higher risk. This is compounded by Musk\u2019s previous debt experiences, such as when he financed his $44 billion acquisition of social media giant X, known as Twitter at the time, in 2022.\nImage via Shutterstock\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "Exclusive-Musk's xAI on track to raise $5 billion in fresh debt, following modest demand\nNEW YORK :Elon Musk's xAI is on track to close on a $5 billion debt raise led by Morgan Stanley, despite tepid investor demand, according to two people familiar with the matter.\nThe $5 billion debt sale, which includes a floating-rate term loan, a fixed-rate loan and secured bonds, will be allocated to investors on Wednesday, the two people said, asking not to be identified because the deal is private. xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment while Morgan Stanley declined.\nThe xAI offering, which was reported on June 2 as Musk and U.S. President Donald Trump traded barbs over social media, did not receive overwhelming interest from high-yield and leveraged loan investors, said five people briefed on the deal.\nThe floating-rate loan will be offered with an interest rate of 700 basis points over the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, a benchmark rate used to price bond deals, while the fixed-rate loan and secured notes will pay a yield of roughly 12 per cent, the two people said.\nThe average yield-to-maturity on high-yield bonds closed Monday at 7.6 per cent, according to the ICE BofA High Yield Index. Musk's AI company has to pay significantly more since xAI and its debt are not yet rated, giving investors little visibility into the company's finances and higher risk.\nThree bond investors who were offered the debt told Reuters they declined to invest. One of these investors noted that xAI has not yet turned a profit and the debt is not rated. They were especially reticent given Musk's track record when he financed his $44 billion acquisition of social media giant X, known at the time as Twitter, in 2022. The banks that loaned him $13 billion to close the deal were forced to hold that debt on their balance sheets for two years because they could not offload it.\nWhile the debt sold in full and on time, it received modest demand from investors, all five people said. Investors submitted orders for roughly 1.5 times the amount of debt available, according to the first two people briefed on the deal. Most similar junk bond deals have typically attracted orders for 2.5 to 3 times the loans and bonds being offered, the people said.\nUnlike Musk's debt deal when he acquired Twitter, Morgan Stanley did not guarantee how much it would sell or commit its own capital to the deal, in what is called a \"best efforts\" transaction, according to one person familiar with the terms.\nIn the Twitter acquisition, the banks ended up making money on the debt, selling it with little-to-no discount months after Trump won the White House and Musk's influence in Washington grew.\nApart from selling debt, xAI has also been in talks to raise about $20 billion in equity, valuing the company at more than $120 billion, with some investors placing valuations as high as $200 billion, Reuters reported last week."
