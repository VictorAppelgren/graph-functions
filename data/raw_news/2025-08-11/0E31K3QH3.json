Carbon capture technologies used in a range of existing industrial applications are relatively mature, and able to integrate with existing facilities.\n\nThe study is expected to conclude at the end of 2026, with findings to be shared publicly to promote broader industry learning and support the development of enabling policy and regulatory frameworks.\n\nThe Consortium, which is open to additional members joining and contributing to the study, has appointed Hatch as Project Management Officer in collaboration with Global CCS Institute, McDaniel, and Pace CCS.\n\nThe study will also look at non-technical enablers required to make CCUS hubs a reality, for example regulatory assessments including intra and inter-regional assessments of CCUS and cross border transport.\n\nThe plan is for each participant in the study to be included in at least one hub, and the study will deliver conceptual development strategies for each hub including cost and schedule estimates, and potential commercialisation pathways.\n\nBy leveraging shared infrastructure and economies of scale, the study will seek potential applications for captured CO2 in industrial processes, or transport captured CO2 via pipeline or shipping to storage sites in Asia or Northern Australia.\n\nThe CCUS Hub study is the first independent industry-led study of its kind in Asia and will examine the technical and commercial pathways to utilising CCUS in hard-to-abate industries across Asia. The study will focus on the potential to develop large-scale projects which can repurpose, or store, captured carbon dioxide (CO2).\n\nSINGAPORE, Aug. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- An industry consortium comprised of leading steelmakers ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India, JSW Steel, Hyundai Steel Company and other value chain players, BHP, Chevron, Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (the Consortium), are undertaking a pre-feasibility study to assess the development of Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) hubs across Asia.\n\n\u201cBHP is committed to supporting our steelmaking customers on their journey to decarbonise the industry.\n\nWith more than 1 billion tonnes of production a year in Asia coming from blast furnace capacity that is relatively early in its production life, it\u2019s important for industry to progress technologies to decarbonise existing steelmaking assets while new commercial pathways to decarbonise steelmaking are developed over time.\n\nBy leveraging shared knowledge and resources with our partners, we are investing in support for innovative solutions\u2014like the potential of CCUS\u2014that we see as an essential part of decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors such as steelmaking.\u201d\n\nComment from Dr. Arvind Bodhankar, the Chief Sustainability Officer at ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India (AM/NS India)\n\n\"At AM/NS India, we recognise that the future of steel is inextricably linked to the well-being of our planet and the generations to come. The choices we make today will fundamentally shape the next generation, far more than our own. This profound responsibility underpins our commitment, which extends well beyond the delivery of world-class steel. It is this shared vision that has led to the formation of a robust consortium, which will enable all stakeholders to strategically undertake pioneering initiatives not only to decarbonise steelmaking but also set new benchmarks in industrial practices. For AM/NS India, the priority is to spearhead a new era of industrial responsibility and leadership, with the clear purpose of accelerating India's journey towards the net-zero goal and significantly enhancing its global competitiveness.\"\n\nComment from Prabodha Acharya, the Chief Sustainability Officer at JSW Group\n\n\u201cSustainability is a value that lies at the very core of JSW's Sustainability Vision that shapes the organization's strategic goals and priorities.\n\nWe remain committed to transforming our sustainability vision into reality with specific targets and commitments. We aim to reduce our CO2 emission intensity in steelmaking by 42% by 2030 from a base year of 2005 and achieving net neutral carbon emissions by 2050. This commitment to decarbonization has already progressed well and achieved a reduction of carbon emissions intensity by 30% against our 2005 baseline.\n\nHowever, we believe that, CCUS has to be developed to become a financially viable decarbonization lever which would be crucial to achieve near zero emissions in the steel sector. Partnerships and collaboration to accelerate the development and deployment of CCUS is essential, and this consortium would help pave the way forward\u201d.\n\nComment from Yonghee Kim, Vice President of the Process R&D Sub-division, Hyundai Steel\n\n\u201cHyundai Steel is committed to leading the decarbonisation of the steel industry, despite it being one of the most carbon-intensive and technically challenging sectors to decarbonise.\n\nThis consortium goes beyond conventional technological development \u2013 it aims to deliver real and measurable emissions reductions through collaboration with global partners, sharing knowledge and experience across borders.\n\nHyundai Steel will continue to take the lead in developing a wide range of low-carbon technologies, including CCUS, contributing to the overall sustainability of the industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cChevron believes in the critical role CCUS can play in a lower carbon world, including by reducing carbon emissions in the hard-to-abate sectors.\n\nWe are focused on leveraging our expertise and global reach to advance CCS technologies and scale lower carbon solutions across the value chain with a focus on areas including the hard-to-abate sector.\u201d\n\nComment from Masaya Inamuro, Chief Operating Officer of Mineral & Metal Resources Business Unit, Mitsui & Co., Ltd.\n\n\"Mitsui has established a vision to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and is targeting a 30% reduction by 2030, relative to 2020 levels.\n\nWe are committed to accelerating the transition to a low-carbon future by initiating a study on CCUS in collaboration with key industrial partners across the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThis initiative aims to explore viable pathways for large-scale CO\u2082 reduction and lay the groundwork for future deployment of decarbonization solutions in various industries.\"\n\nBHP is a global resources company. With more than 90,000 employees and contractors, we work in more than 90 locations worldwide and our products are sold globally. We're focused on the resources the world needs to grow and decarbonise. Population growth, urbanisation and improving living standards are global trends that underpin strong demand for the commodities we produce. Demand for essential commodities is expected to increase as the world seeks to decarbonise. Our project pipeline and focus on continuous improvement in existing operations leave us well positioned for growth across our four commodity pillars of copper, potash, iron ore and steelmaking coal in the decades ahead.\n\nWe are partnering with customers and others to try to accelerate decarbonisation in steelmaking. BHP\u2019s 2030 goals include supporting industry to develop steel production technology capable of 30 per cent lower GHG emissions intensity relative to conventional blast furnace steelmaking, with widespread adoption expected post-2030.\n\nArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India (AM/NS India) is a joint venture between ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel, two of the world\u2019s leading steel manufacturing organisations.
