Maura Healey and the National Weather Service warn residents to stay safe, noting high surf advisories through Friday and possible coastal flooding. The storm, currently a Category 2 hurricane, could strengthen to Category 3 or higher as it travels north, with wave heights up to 20 feet and gale‑force winds affecting the Cape and Islands. Boaters and anglers are urged to exercise caution, and a wind advisory is in effect for parts of the region.",
