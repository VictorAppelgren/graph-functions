  "description": "Oklahoma quarterback John Mateer denies gambling on sports. He says descriptions on Venmo payments were 'inside jokes' between him and his friends and not literal.",
  "content": "Oklahoma quarterback John Mateer says he hasn\u2019t been gambling on college sports, despite notes on some of his Venmo payments.\n\nSome inside jokes can be funny. Others not so much.\n\nJohn Mateer seems to have fallen into the second category: The Oklahoma Sooners quarterback is now on defense regarding NCAA policy about student-athletes and sports betting.\n\nScreenshots of Venmo transactions the QB made in 2022 began circulating Monday on social media. They appear to show that Mateer, then a Washington State freshman, wrote \u201csports gambling\u201d to describe two separate payments to the same individual. The amounts were undisclosed.\n\nOne of those descriptions included in \u201cUCLA vs USC\u201d in parentheses. The Trojans defeated the Bruins 48-45 on Nov. 19, 2022, the day before both Venmo payments were allegedly made.\n\nCurrent NCAA rules prohibit student-athletes from engaging in sports betting at any level, although a proposal is being considered that would permit gambling on professional sports only.\n\nMateer released a statement Tuesday indicating that he had written those words in jest.\n\n\u201cThe allegations that I once participated in sports gambling are false,\u201d he wrote on X (formerly Twitter). \u201cMy previous Venmo descriptions did not accurately portray the transactions in question but were instead inside jokes between me and my friends.\n\n\u201cI have never bet on sports. I understand the seriousness of the matter but recognize that, taken out of context, those Venmo descriptions suggest otherwise. I can assure my teammates, coaches, and officials at the NCAA that I have not engaged in any sports gambling.\u201d\n\nOklahoma Athletics said in a statement that its student-athletes receive ongoing education on matters related to sports gambling and that it uses a service that provides comprehensive monitoring of sports gambling activities.\n\n\u201cOU takes any allegations of gambling seriously and works closely with the NCAA in any situations of concern,\u201d the department said. \u201cOU Athletics is unaware of any NCAA investigation and has no reason to believe there is one pending.\u201d\n\nMateer played three seasons at Washington State, including the past two as the Cougars\u2019 starting quarterback, before transferring to Oklahoma this offseason.",

      "text": "The highs, lows and terrible in-betweens of a compulsive sports gambler\n- Share via\nDavid Leong had a hunch, but that\u2019s how it is for most sports gamblers. Luck is mistaken for skill, and skill, it is believed, can make you a killing.\nOn a Saturday morning, Sept. 3, 2016, he and a friend flew to Vegas, scored an 8-ball of coke and checked into a suite at Bally\u2019s. Leong had an $18,000 credit, and it was time to make it rain.\n\u201cThere is no way USC can beat Alabama,\u201d he remembered thinking as he visited two sportsbooks to spread the wager.\nKicked up with adrenaline and nerves, he didn\u2019t touch the coke. A win would double his bet. A loss would \u2026 he pushed the thought away and settled in to watch the game.\nThe Crimson Tide was slow to score, but by halftime, they were up by two touchdowns. Still, Leong didn\u2019t relax. Nothing\u2019s ever a sure thing.\nFor almost 10 years, he had lived with these feelings: the highs, the lows and the terrible in-betweens of a compulsive sports gambler. And he knew he wasn\u2019t alone.\nSo earlier this month, he wasn\u2019t surprised when he heard the allegations involving Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani and Ohtani\u2019s interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, that have rocked the baseball world.\nIn an interview with ESPN, Mizuhara said he had gotten into debt gambling on sports other than baseball and that Ohtani had helped him out by wiring at least $4.5 million to an Orange County bookmaker. Ohtani said he had no knowledge of the transactions and accused Mizuhara of stealing the money from him.\nAs Major League Baseball and federal authorities investigate the competing narratives, sports gambling has drawn renewed attention.\nOnce the domain of casinos, it is now available through gaming apps and self-service kiosks, with credit card companies happy to foot the bill for an industry that\u2019s tailored its approach to a generation seldom off their phones, eager to turn an easy buck and quickly seduced by the sales pitches of onetime athletes like Tom Brady.\nFantasy sports sites like the DraftKings and FanDuel fuel the desire, drawing in solitary gamblers \u2014 mostly men in their 20s on their phones \u2014 while offshore sportsbooks open a virtual door to live-action games. During this year\u2019s March Madness, the American Gaming Assn. estimates that 68 million Americans will place some kind of wager on the tournament.\n\u201cOnline gambling has been a game changer,\u201d said Lia Nower, distinguished professor and director of the Center for Gambling Studies at Rutgers University. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to travel or be restricted by when the casino is open. You have your casino, your race track, or your sports book in your pocket on your phone.\u201d\nConvenience abets addiction, and while Leong, 31, doesn\u2019t pretend to have special insight into the nature of the disease, he is sharing his story with the hope that it might help break the stigma and isolation.\nA clinical social worker with Westside Gambling Treatment, he counsels problem gamblers whose lives he recognizes too well: desperate for cash, struggling with debt, living with depression.\nLeong has a degree from Cal State Northridge, but that trip to Vegas \u2014 the $18,000 he put on Alabama to beat USC and the aftermath \u2014 was his real education.\n::\nA few minutes into the third quarter, Alabama escaped a blitz and turned a 17-yard pass into a 71-yard TD. Even though his team was up, Leong still couldn\u2019t relax. He paid for a 15-minute neck and shoulder massage.\n\u201cGambling operates on a variable-ratio reinforcement schedule that is particularly addictive because the payout is unpredictable but can be very large,\u201d said Nower. \u201cThe longer you play, the more you become conditioned, and the harder it is to stop.\u201d\nLeong never saw himself as having a problem, but then, few gamblers do. All he knew was that he always seemed so close to scoring the money, cars, girls and fame that came so easily to others.\nHe\u2019d gotten his first taste of betting in 10th grade. Growing up in Tarzana, in a modest single-story home with a pool just down the street from a country club, he loved sports: karate, soccer, baseball, football.\nHis parents liked going to Las Vegas, and on one trip, his dad asked who he thought would win a basketball game. The Lakers, of course, and his dad made the bet and won. The next day, it was football. Leong liked the Saints. When they won, his dad peeled off $100 for him.\nHe doesn\u2019t hold his father responsible. He blames his own addictive personality. But when he held that bill, Leong felt his life change. Back at school \u2014 William Howard Taft Charter High School in Woodland Hills \u2014 he googled an overseas sportsbook, betonline.ag, and opened an account with $50.\nOnce, this would have been unimaginable. In 1992, Congress passed the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, which, with few exceptions, outlawed sports betting. But in 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the legislation, ruling that sports gambling should be regulated by states.\nIn California, sports betting has remained illegal despite the \u201ctremendous amount of advertising that makes it seem that all sports betting is legal,\u201d said Timothy Fong, professor of psychiatry at UCLA and co-director of the school\u2019s Gambling Studies Program.\nOnline gambling is the loophole, and consumers in California can easily access out-of-state and -country sportbooks.\nExperts like Fong consider online gambling a public health issue of growing concern that has brought \u201cunnecessary pain and suffering ... to the lives of millions of people across the nation.\u201d\nFurthermore, Nower said, the industry has grown without federal regulation that might have required prevention or education programs such as those that exist for substance use.\n\u201cAnd gambling is every bit as addictive as substances,\u201d she added.\nLeong remembers placing his first bet on an NBA game and constantly checking the score during an afternoon football practice. He can\u2019t remember whether he won or lost, but that doesn\u2019t matter. Gambling gave him an edge.\nThe son of a Chinese father and a white Jewish mother, Leong had struggled in middle school with his identity, feeling on the outside of popular social cliques. Playing high school football \u2014 quarterback for the Toreadors \u2014 opened a few doors, but he never felt at ease.\nNow, he had $1,000, right there on his phone, while many of his friends didn\u2019t want to spend $6 on lunch.\nBut he always needed more.\nUnable to get credit as a minor, he got a job as a sign twirler, standing at Renaldi Street and Reseda Boulevard, spinning the giant arrow for condos in Porter Ranch. More often, he and his buddies would hide in the bushes, smoke weed and watch Netflix. He liked the feeling of not working and still getting paid.\nHis salary went to his pot habit and gambling, and when he ran short, he did whatever was needed, like boosting a necklace from Macy\u2019s.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t ashamed,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what us 16-year-old guys did. We did everything we could to get money.\u201d\nHis hero was celebrity poker player Dan Bilzerian, whose Instagram posts were all about hot women, nice cars and expensive mansions. Never mind that Leong drove a Civic. On good days, he imagined himself in a Maserati.\n::\nAt the end of the third quarter, USC got another field goal, but Alabama won, 52-6.\nLeong felt high. Two months shy of his 24th birthday, he had turned 18 grand into 30 grand. He and his friend wondered what bottle service they\u2019d order, what new bet they\u2019d place, and with that, the happiness was gone. Just hours after winning big, Leong felt empty.\nHe needed to figure out how to stay in the action.\nThat feeling had defined his life: the constant, restless hunger. He dabbled in cards, but the kick wasn\u2019t the same. It didn\u2019t have the buzz of anticipating and participating, that dopamine hit, that adrenaline rush.\nAnd nothing came close to the thrill of in-game betting, putting money on the next layup, pass or serve just seconds away from it happening.\n\u201cYou\u2019re playing for that juice,\u201d said Nower. \u201cThis is what makes sports gambling different than, say, video poker or slots, which help if you\u2019re depressed and want to disassociate. Sports betting is a more action-oriented form of gambling.\u201d\nBecause Leong followed sports, he saw himself no different than a businessman who plays the stock market.\nHe will never forget the time he won big: a parlay wager \u2014 $50 on eight teams \u2014 he made at home with 5dimescasino.com. When it ended with the 49ers hitting a field goal at the end of the fourth quarter, he cleared $8,000. He couldn\u2019t stop screaming with excitement.\nEach win confirmed his skill, and each loss felt alien: It was never his fault, just bad luck or a referee\u2019s bad call.\nOut of high school, a student at Pierce and Valley colleges, he began applying for every credit card he could, maxing them out while thinking that with one big win, he\u2019d be OK. Short of that, he learned to work the angles.\nBecause overseas sportsbooks are not legal in the U.S., the transactions were registered on his bank statement as sports merchandise, which he would dispute and get rescinded.\n\u201cA real gambler will do anything to stay in action,\u201d he said.\nLiving at home with no expenses, making $4,500 a month as a delivery driver, he frequented a payday loan shop in Reseda, borrowing $2,000 with 30% interest. He met his bookie in a parking lot at the corner of Reseda Boulevard and Devonshire Street and passed over an envelope of cash.\n::\nThat night in Vegas, he tried to celebrate, but he was on the hunt for another game when he heard about the Notre Dame-Texas match-up the next day.\nThe Longhorns had had two losing seasons and were starting a freshman quarterback. This would be easy, he thought; he doubled down on the Irish, looking to hit $60,000.\nIf today was good, then tomorrow would be even better.\nThe kickoff was Sunday afternoon, and by the end of the first quarter, the score was tied. By the end of the second quarter, Texas was up by a touchdown, and by the fourth quarter, Notre Dame had come back but was still behind by a field goal. They were being outplayed. Leong was stunned.\nJust when it looked like the game was over, Notre Dame returned a blocked field goal, tied the score and forced two overtimes, only to finally lose, 50-47.\nAs Leong saw the Texas quarterback sail into the end zone on a six-yard run, he knew it was over. Standing in his hotel suite, the sparkling neon of the Vegas Strip below, he never felt more alone. He had nothing \u2014 no money for a flight home, no money to bet, no money for weed \u2014 only enough for a Greyhound ticket back to L.A.\nRecovery circles, as Leong would later learn, call it \u201cincomprehensible demoralization\u201d \u2014 rock bottom.\nStill living with his parents, he wanted to change. He knew something was wrong; this wasn\u2019t who he was. He said that he would start attending Gamblers Anonymous, but he didn\u2019t. He just continued to gamble and take drugs.\n\u201cGamblers present well to society,\u201d said Yael Landa, director of the gambling program at Beit T\u2019Shuvah, a treatment center in Culver City, \u201cbut if you delve in deep under the surface, you see a master of living a double life.\u201d\nThree months later, his mother opened one of his credit card statements and saw the mounting debt. She made it clear: Get help or get out.\nLeong placed his final bet on Dec. 17, 2016. In a flourish, he did the last of his coke, and on Jan. 3, 2017, enrolled in an outpatient program at Beit T\u2019Shuvah.\nHis father paid his bookie $10,000 to settle his account, and Leong declared bankruptcy, absolving himself of $90,000 he owed to various credit card companies.\nOver the next year, he began to learn more about himself and how this long downward spiral began. As much as he tried to find that one skeleton in the closet to explain it all, he couldn\u2019t.\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten everything I wanted in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cGreat parents. All the opportunities. But it was a perfect storm: me loving sports, wanting to make money and having low self-esteem.\u201d\nToday, living in an apartment in Pasadena with his girlfriend, he says that he\u2019s learning how to be happy, which means tolerating discomfort, hard work and the grind of everyday life.\nIn 2020, having interned at Beit T\u2019Shuvah, he earned a master\u2019s degree in social work. His first jobs were with two homeless agencies as a case manager, and when the opportunity came up to help addicted gamblers, he took it.\nHe calls it his comeback, and while he still watches sports, he ignores his hunches."

      "text": "Sports gambling is exploding, and it\u2019ll be even worse than you think\n- Share via\nThe most anticipated first-round series of the NBA playoffs is here: the Lakers versus the defending champion Denver Nuggets. LeBron James\u2019 squad was swept by Denver in the last postseason, and L.A. hasn\u2019t beaten the Nuggets since December 2022, which is why the Lakers are serious underdogs according to the online gambling site DraftKings.\nSound like a good bet? Or at least a fun one? That\u2019s the vibe DraftKings is going for.\nOpinion Columnist\nLZ Granderson\nLZ Granderson writes about culture, politics, sports and navigating life in America.\nOne of the site\u2019s recent promos features comedian Kevin Hart hawking \u201cno sweat tokens\u201d next to this claim: \u201cPlace a NBA SGP or SGPx bet today and get a bonus bet back if you lose!\u201d That sounds as close to a win-win situation as any, regardless of whether you know anything about gambling or single-game parlays.\nIt all comes across as harmless and fun.\nSo did candy cigarettes.\nGranderson: Caitlin Clark is having a moment in women\u2019s basketball. She shouldn\u2019t be the only one\nWomen\u2019s basketball is catching more interest than usual thanks to the star of the NCAA tournament. What would it take to hold Americans\u2019 attention?\nEven after the surgeon general advised against smoking in 1964, candy cigarettes were still on the market and tobacco companies were still lending their branding to candy companies. One government study found that 88% of current and former smokers began with candy cigarettes and that \u201codds for current and ever smoking increased with increasing candy cigarette use.\u201d Nearly half a million people die from cigarette smoke in the U.S. each year, and guess what is still on the market.\nLike cigarettes, gambling should never be presented as harmless \u2014 or as fun. It can be fun, which is why Hart makes a great pitchman. But legalized sports betting is no more harmless than selling sugar sticks shaped like cigarettes.\nIt\u2019s not just the personal and societal devastation from out-of-control gambling that we need to fear. The sports industry is not prepared to navigate a world of legalized betting. Ippei Mizuhara, the interpreter who is accused of stealing more than $16 million from the Dodgers pitcher Shohei Ohtani to bet on sports, and Jontay Porter, who this week received a lifetime ban by the NBA for violating its gambling policy, are not unique.\nThey were just caught.\nIt was fun in 1992 with the Michael Jordan \u2018Dream Team,\u2019 but now that professional players are so meh about it, I\u2019d rather see college players represent us.\nLast year we learned more than 180 professional tennis players were part of a global match-fixing ring that started in 2014. It wasn\u2019t even started by a player. According to the Washington Post, it began with a law student in Brussels who discovered how little tennis players made at the beginning of their careers. In some cases, winning a title brought home less than the kickback a player could get for purposefully dropping a set. Keep in mind this ring started after the sport was rocked by a gambling scandal involving a Top 10 player in 2007 who was believed to have mafia ties.\nCute commercials and \u201cno sweat tokens\u201d are one face of sports gambling \u2014 and are dangerous enough to the public \u2014 but there are more sides to this threat. Today it is believed gambling on tennis alone moves more than $50 billion around the globe. That too is a part of sports betting, and I don\u2019t know how you prevent the two from bleeding into one another.\nAthletes themselves can be tempted by the promise of easy money, but the LeBron Jameses and the Shohei Ohtanis are not the worry. The worry is the low-level player or trainer who is barely getting by and may be tempted to violate gambling rules for financial help with sustaining their careers. Or even officials on the periphery. Tim Donaghy, the NBA referee who had bet tens of thousands on games over two seasons before getting caught, was a glaring reminder just a few years ago.\nIf any league has had time to recognize the dangers, it\u2019s the NBA. In 1954, Fort Wayne Pistons player Jack Molinas was suspended for betting on NBA games. By 1961, he was arrested on charges of being part of a college gambling ring that had touched 27 schools, 43 games and 476 players. In 1975, he was shot in the head while standing in the backyard of his home in Hollywood Hills. Police said they believed the murder was mob-related.\nThat too is part of sports gambling.\nIt\u2019s not all charming spokesmen and \u201cno sweat tokens.\u201d There\u2019s addiction. There\u2019s greed. There\u2019s corruption and crime. The sports industry is not prepared for this, and neither is America."

      "text": "Shohei Ohtani and his agent accused of sabotaging $240-million real estate project\n- Share via\nA Hawaii real estate investor and broker are suing Shohei Ohtani, claiming the Dodgers\u2019 star and his agent got them fired from a $240-million luxury housing development on the Big Island\u2019s coveted Hapuna Coast that they brought him in to endorse.\nAccording to the lawsuit filed in Hawaii Circuit Court on Friday, Ohtani\u2019s agent, Nez Balelo, increasingly demanded concessions from developer Kevin J. Hayes Sr. and real estate broker Tomoko Matsumoto before demanding that their business partner, Kingsbarn Realty Capital, drop them from the deal.\n\u201cBalelo and [Ohtani], who were brought into the venture solely for [Ohtani\u2019]s promotional and branding value, exploited their celebrity leverage to destabilize and ultimately dismantle Plaintiffs\u2019 role in the project \u2014 for no reason other than their own financial self-interest,\u201d the lawsuit claims.\nYoshinobu Yamamoto struggles on the mound and Zach Neto hits two home runs as the Angels overcome Shohei Ohtani\u2019s 42nd home run in a 7-4 victory over the Dodgers.\nThe suit accuses Ohtani and Balelo of tortious interference and unjust enrichment. Hayes, a developer with 40 years of experience, and Matsumoto, who was to be the listing agent for the houses averaging $17.3 million each, say that Ohtani and Balelo also tried to undermine their interests in a second, neighboring venture.\nA spokesman for Balelo\u2019s agency, CAA Baseball, declined comment. Attempts to reach Kingsbarn officials for comment were not immediately successful.\n\u201cThis case is about abuse of power,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cDefendants used threats and baseless legal claims to force a business partner to betray its contractual obligations and strip Plaintiffs of the very project they conceived and built.\n\u201cDefendants must be held accountable for their actions, not shielded by fame or behind-the-scenes agents acting with impunity. Plaintiffs bring this suit to expose Defendants\u2019 misconduct and to ensure that the rules of contract, fair dealing, and accountability apply equally to all \u2014 celebrity or not.\u201d\nOhtani, 31, arrived from Japan in 2018 as perhaps the most heralded international star in baseball history, with an ability to both pitch and hit that made him doubly valuable to his team. A five-time All-Star and three-time most valuable player, he signed a record 10-year, $700-million contract with the Dodgers before last season and helped the team win the 2024 World Series.\nInvestment materials for The Vista at Mauna Kea Resort, which remained online on Monday night, listed Hayes and Matsumoto as part of the management team, along with Kingsbarn. It called Ohtani \u201cJapan\u2019s Babe Ruth\u201d and the \u201c1st Resident,\u201d giving him top billing ahead of the iconic Mauna Kea Resort, \u201cone of the most celebrated hotels in Hawaii,\u201d Hapuna Beach, \u201crated the #1 beach in America by Conde Nast Traveler\u201d and two golf courses \u2014 one designed by Arnold Palmer, the other by Robert Trent Jones Sr.\n\u201cOhtani will act as the celebrity spokesperson for the project and has committed to purchasing one of the 14 residences within the project,\u201d the brochure says. \u201cHe also intends to spend significant time at The Vista in the off-season and will construct a small hitting and pitching facility for preseason training.\u201d\nThe suit says the developers spent 11 years working on the deal and \u201cas part of a bold marketing strategy\u201d signed an endorsement deal in 2023 with Ohtani, \u201cone of the most high-profile endorsements imaginable.\u201d\nBlake Treinen and Alex Vesia gave up three homers in the span of six batters and Shohei Ohtani strikes out at a critical moment in a 5-4 loss to Toronto.\n\u201cThis partnership with Ohtani will elevate the demand and create buzz within the Japanese luxury vacation home market, which is a primary target audience for the project,\u201d the investment brochure said. \u201cWe see Shohei Ohtani\u2019s homeownership as having a significant impact on the global exposure of the project and expect to accelerate the pace of sales, thereby helping us achieve our pricing objectives.\u201d\nThe suit said Balelo \u201cquickly became a disruptive force,\u201d threatening to pull Ohtani from the deal if concessions weren\u2019t made.\n\u201cKingsbarn began capitulating to Balelo\u2019s every whim,\u201d the suit said. \u201cOver time, it became increasingly obvious that Kingsbarn was more concerned about preserving its relationship with [Ohtani] than honoring its obligations to its business partners.\u201d\nLast month, in what the suit called \u201ca coordinated ambush,\u201d Kingsbarn fired Hayes and Matsumoto.\n\u201cKingsbarn openly admitted during the call that Balelo had demanded the terminations and that they were being done solely to placate him,\u201d the suit said. \u201cPlaintiffs stand to lose millions of dollars in compensation tied to projected homebuilding profit, construction management fees, and broker commissions.\u201d\nGolen writes for the Associated Press."

FIFA needs 65,000 volunteers\n- Share via\nThe pay is nonexistent, but the perk could be viewing games in the U.S., Mexico and Canada for free during the FIFA World Cup next summer.\nFIFA launched the application process for the World Cup volunteers Monday. How many are needed? A staggering 65,000 across the 16 cities that will host the expanded 48-team format over 39 days beginning June 11, the largest volunteer program FIFA has ever attempted.\n\u201cVolunteers are the heart, soul and smile of FIFA tournaments,\u201d FIFA president Gianni Infantino said. \u201cThey get to show off their local pride, gain a behind-the-scenes view of the tournament and make memories and friendships that can last a lifetime, while supporting a historic event.\n\u201cWe hope interested individuals will join us as we welcome the world to North America in 2026.\u201d\nIn addition to stadiums, volunteers will provide support across at training sites, airports and hotels.\nWednesday marks one year out from the start of the 2026 World Cup. A look at where preparations stand.\nFIFA estimates 6.5 million fans will attend the World Cup, with 3.7 million attending games in the U.S., 1.5 million in Mexico and 1.3 million in Canada. The 2022 final with Lionel Messi leading Argentina past Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and France, drew a record 1.42 billion viewers, including 26 million in the U.S.\n\u201cThe Super Bowl, which is fantastic, has what, 120-130 million viewers? The World Cup has 6 billion,\u201d Infantino told Fox Sports in April. \u201cA World Cup is 104 Super Bowls in one month.\u201d\nVolunteers in the past ranged from students to seniors. No experience is required but applicants must be at least 18 years old. Interested individuals can apply at fifaworldcup.com/volunteers.\nThose whose applications are accepted will be invited to attend the Volunteer Team Tryouts, which are expected to begin in October. Training will take place in March 2026.\n\u2018Volunteers are the heartbeat of FIFA events and champions of their host city \u2014 sharing their pride and passion with fans from all corners of the globe, welcoming visitors to experience the unique culture of their host city and supporting the extraordinary event that is a FIFA World Cup,\u201d FIFA said in a statement.\nThe FIFA Club World Cup exposed some significant issues that could hamper the 2026 World Cup, with hot weather being among the top concerns.\nLos Angeles is one of 11 U.S. host cities, with eight games scheduled at SoFi Stadium, including the U.S. team\u2019s opener June 12. After playing its second match in Seattle on June 19, the U.S. will conclude group play at SoFi on June 25.\nIncluded in the games to be played in Inglewood are two round-of-32 games and a quarterfinal. Only one venue \u2014 AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas \u2014 was awarded more games with nine.\nOther U.S. hosts cities include Seattle, Houston, Kansas City, Atlanta, Boston, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, Miami and the San Francisco Bay area. Games in Mexico and Canada will be held in Mexico City, Monterrey, Guadalajara, Toronto and Vancouver.\n\u201cFIFA changed my life,\u201d longtime volunteer Craig Collins said on a video. \u201cWhy do I want to volunteer again? I can give back to an organization that has provided for me without knowing it.\nCollins became the one-millionth person to join the FIFA volunteer community in April 2025.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to apply for the 2026 volunteer program and hope to show off my community to the world once more.\u201d\nFor the record:\n7:35 a.m. Aug. 12, 2025An earlier version of this story listed Gregg Berhalter as the U.S. men\u2019s soccer coach.

      "text": "- Share via\nThe Toronto Blue Jays did everything possible to hand the Dodgers a victory Sunday.\nTheir pitchers gave up 10 hits, including two home runs. They walked 13, a season-high for the Dodgers, twice loading the bases on free passes in the final two innings. At the plate, Toronto struck out 14 times.\nThe Dodgers, however, refused to accept the gift, giving up an eighth-inning lead in a 5-4 loss that dropped their lead over the San Diego Padres in the National League West to two games. The Padres trailed by six games less than three weeks ago.\n\u201cThis is frustrating because I just felt there\u2019s no way we should lose this game today,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cWe had them on the ropes numerous times. And for us not to win is so frustrating.\u201d\nIn his second start after missing four months with a shoulder injury, the Dodgers\u2019 Blake Snell dominated Toronto, striking out 10 in five scoreless innings of a 9-1 win.\nHow frustrating? The Dodgers were one for 10 with runners in scoring position. They left a season-high 16 men on base \u2014 six in the last two innings.\nEvery Dodgers starter reached base at least once. Yet they still lost.\nAfterward, third baseman Max Muncy insisted the black cloud had a silver lining, even if no one else could see it.\n\u201cWe were creating opportunities. So, you know, we were doing the first part of it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just weren\u2019t cashing in today. The positive you take out of it is we found a way to create a lot of opportunities.\n\u201cYou just have to finish the job.\u201d\nThat goes double for the Dodger relievers. Starter Tyler Glasnow was brilliant, striking out eight and allowing just two runs over 5\u2154 innings, turning a 3-2 lead over to a bullpen that had to get 10 outs. Once again they couldn\u2019t do it, with Blake Treinen and Alex Vesia giving up three solo home runs in the span of six batters.\n\u201cYou give good hitters pitches right down the middle, they\u2019re going to do damage,\u201d said Treinen, who came on in the eighth with a one-run lead and left five batters later trailing after back-to-back home runs by Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Addison Barger.\n\u201cSometimes we get away with making bad locations turn into outs. They made me pay for it and it cost us a game.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not the only one who had to pay. Because after Freddie Freeman walked with the bases loaded for the second time to tie the game in the eighth, Vesia came on to start the ninth with the score even again. Ernie Clement unevened it on Vesia\u2019s first pitch, driving an 85-mph slider over the wall in left field to put Toronto ahead. It was the 65th homer Dodgers relievers have allowed this season; only two bullpens in the majors have given up more.\nBut the Blue Jays\u2019 generosity knew no end, so Toronto tried to give the win back when reliever Jeff Hoffman loaded the bases with one out for Shohei Ohtani.\nBut after fouling off two tough full-count pitches from Mason Fluharty, a left-hander with a 5.15 earned-run average and Toronto\u2019s eighth pitcher of the day, Ohtani waved at a sweeper outside the zone to strike out.\n\u201cThe last thing I was thinking was he was going to strike out. ... We\u2019ve got to come up with one right there,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cChasing the ball down below is something we can\u2019t have happen.\u201d\nMookie Betts followed by grounding into a force out to end the game.\nThree innings earlier Ohtani, who had two hits, including his 41st homer of the season to run his hitting streak to a season-best nine games, was thrown out trying to steal third with two outs and Freeman at the plate, ending another Dodger threat.\n\u201cThat was his decision,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cNot a good baseball play.\u201d\nClayton Kershaw gives up seven hits and one earned run over six innings and Mookie Betts hits a two-run home run in the Dodgers\u2019 5-1 win over Toronto.\nNow the Dodgers head to Anaheim for a three-game series with the Angels before returning home to face the Padres, likely with the division lead at stake.\nThe Dodgers have been faltering since July 1, going 15-18. San Diego has been on fire, going 21-13 over the same span. Among NL teams, only the Milwaukee Brewers have been better.\nWhile San Diego has the most saves (39) and the best bullpen ERA in baseball (3.04), Dodgers relievers rank 21st (4.24).\nAnd while the Padres got better at last month\u2019s trade deadline, making five trades that netted them reliever Mason Miller and left-hander JP Sears from Oakland, first baseman/outfielder Ryan O\u2019Hearn and left fielder Ram\u00f3n Laureano from the Orioles and catcher Freddy Fermin from the Royals, the Dodgers barely tinkered around the edges. Their major acquisition, reliever Brock Stewart, has given up six hits and two runs in 3\u2154 innings.\nThe Padres went all in. The Dodgers did not.\nTalk about frustrating."

      "text": "The Division I Council introduced a proposal that, if adopted in October, would change sports betting rules to permit student-athletes and staff members to bet on professional sports and refocus the Association's enforcement efforts on college sports betting and behaviors that directly impact game integrity. If adopted, the change will be implemented only if Divisions II and III also vote to allow betting on pro sports.\nThe council's actions are not final until its meeting concludes Wednesday.\nThe council's introduction of the proposal, which comes after a directive from the Division I Board of Directors in April that the council adopt changes to sports betting rules, is not an endorsement of sports betting behaviors, especially for college athletes. The NCAA's prohibition against betting on college sports would remain in place, as would the prohibitions against sharing information about college events with bettors. The NCAA also would continue to maintain its prohibition for NCAA championships against advertising and sponsorships associated with betting.\n\"NCAA rules prohibiting sports betting at all levels were written and adopted at a time when sports gambling was largely illegal nationwide,\" said Josh Whitman, athletics director at Illinois and chair of the council. \"As betting on sports has become more widely accepted across the country, Division I members have determined that further discussion of these sports betting rules is warranted, particularly as it relates to the potential distinctions between betting on professional versus collegiate sports. Throughout our discussions, the council has remained focused on student-athlete wellness and educating student-athletes about the risks and potentially harmful impacts of betting.\"\nCurrent NCAA rules do not allow student-athletes or institutional staff to engage in sports betting at any level (professional, college or amateur) for any sports that have NCAA championships, and NCAA members have continually maintained that any betting by a student-athlete on his or her own team or own sport in college should continue to result in a permanent loss of any remaining collegiate eligibility. However, in 2023, Division I changed the reinstatement guidelines for student-athletes who participate in sports betting on professional sports to focus on harm reduction for problematic betting behaviors.\n\"Deregulating professional sports betting may provide schools an additional opportunity to implement harm-reduction strategies, which can be more effective and have long-term benefits not seen with abstinence-only approaches. Harm-reduction strategies include education, stigma reduction and acknowledging actual behaviors,\" said Dr. Deena Casiero, NCAA chief medical officer. \"By meeting student-athletes where they are, schools may be more effective at preventing, identifying and supporting student-athletes with problematic gambling behaviors. Regardless of the change, schools are encouraged to use the many sports betting resources already available.\"\nThe recently released Harm Reduction Considerations for Gambling & Sports Betting in Collegiate Sportsreferences available sports betting resources, including the NCAA Mental Health Best Practices. Additionally, more than 100,000 student-athletes, coaches and administrators have been reached through the NCAA's education efforts with EPIC Global Solutions, and the NCAA has launched an e-learning module to educate student-athletes on problem gambling harms and the integrity risks associated with sports betting.\nSeveral sports betting-related violations by staff members at NCAA schools have been resolved through the infractions process in recent years, and the enforcement staff is working on issuing Notices of Allegations in several ongoing cases that involve allegations of betting on professional and college sports by student-athletes and/or athletics department staff members at a handful of NCAA schools.\nThe proposed rule change would not be retroactive. If it is adopted, it would apply only to sports betting activities that occur after the effective date of the proposal.\n\"The enforcement staff's sports betting-related caseload has significantly increased in recent years, and our staff \u2014 including our new sports betting integrity unit \u2014 has been effective in detecting and pursuing violations,\" said Jon Duncan, NCAA vice president of enforcement.\nThe Association prioritizes competition integrity, which is vital to college sports. The NCAA uses a layered strategy to respond responsibly to the rise in sports betting across the United States by monitoring over 22,000 contests per year, advocating for limits on prop bets that pose heightened risks, reducing the potential for student-athlete abuse by aggrieved bettors, and creating greater transparency to assist with the timely investigation and resolution of integrity-related issues.\nThis layered approach includes the most recent agreement extension with Genius Sports to establish unprecedented betting restrictions on high-risk proposition bets. Sportsbooks licensing NCAA championship data must cooperate fully with NCAA investigations, including providing access to account data, financial history and geolocation records. This will allow the NCAA to work with the sportsbooks to gather detailed account information when harassers are identified to prevent repeat offenders from continuing to place bets across platforms, increasing safeguards to protect student-athlete mental health and well-being."
