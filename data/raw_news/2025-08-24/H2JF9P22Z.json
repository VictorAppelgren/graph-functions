  "description": "The Houston Rockets' general manager spoke out with a major revelation about Giannis Antetokounmpo.",
  "content": "Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nThe Houston Rockets have been one of the most aggressive teams in the NBA throughout the 2025 offseason. Acquiring Kevin Durant was arguably the biggest blockbuster move that any team made.\n\nWhile the Durant trade was a big one for the Rockets, the team was connected to another high-profile move. Houston was one of the teams talked about as a potential trade suitor for Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo.\n\nAntetokounmpo has been at the top of the NBA rumor mill this offseason. He has yet to fully decide on what he wants for the future. Will he stay with the Bucks?\n\nEntering the 2025-26 season, that remains one of the biggest questions in the league. It's entirely possible that Antetokounmpo could end up wanting out of Milwaukee by the trade deadline. Next offseason would be another possibility.\n\nWith that being said, the Rockets' general manager spoke out with a revelation about Antetokounmpo.\n\nDuring a recent interview on ESPN Houston, Rafael Stone spoke out and shared that Bucks' general manager Jon Horst and he had a conversation about Antetokounmpo. It was made clear to him that the \"Greek Freak\" will not be traded.\n\nHe was asked specifically about whether or not Houston could trade for Antetokounmpo before the start of the 2025-26 season.\n\n\"No,\" Stone said. \"I deal well with Jon Horst (Bucks GM), I really like him. Jon was very clear that they weren't doing anything. So, that was that.\"\n\nNo one should be surprised about that statement. Milwaukee is still 100 percent determined to build a championship contender around Antetokounmpo.\n\nAntetokounmpo also seems to prefer the idea of staying with the Bucks. He simply wants to be in a position where he can compete for another ring.\n\nRead more: Ayesha Curry Reveals What Stephen Curry Wanted to Do Before NBA Stardom\n\nIt will be interesting to see what the future has in store for both Milwaukee and Antetokounmpo. Things can change in the blink of an eye when it comes to the NBA. More should be known about that situation by the end of the upcoming season.\n\nAt this point, the Rockets will not be able to acquire Antetokounmpo. But, if he is made available on the trade block down the road, Houston will be a team to watch.\n\nFor more on the Houston Rockets and general NBA news, head on over to Newsweek Sports.",

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nGolden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry has become one of the best NBA players of all-time. His shooting ability completely changed the game of basketball.\nWhile three-point shooting had become a trend before he entered the league, Curry shook up everything. His elite ability to shoot the ball made young players want to play like him. Truthfully, Curry is one of the few players who has completely changed the course of the sport.\nCurry is still playing at an elite level even at 37 years old. Entering the 2025-26 NBA season, there have been questions about how much longer he will play.\nTo this point, Curry has shown no interest in retiring. That day may not be too far away, but for now he's focused on winning another championship for the Warriors.\nRead more: Shaquille O'Neal Reveals How Pat Riley Threat Backfired With Heat\nBefore all of the superstardom in the NBA, Curry had another dream.\nDuring a recent episode of her podcast, \"Call Me Daddy,\" Ayesha Curry spoke out about his former career goal. Curry wanted to coach high school basketball.\n\"I didn't know that he was going to end up playing basketball. He said he wanted to be a high school basketball coach,\" Ayesha said.\nAyesha also shared that she didn't realize how good Curry was as a high school basketball player himself.\n\"Apparently, he was, but I genuinely didn't pay attention to that,\" she said. \"I grew up in such an art-driven family that sports outside of Doug Flutie, playing for the Buffalo Bills, it just wasn't a thing in my house.\"\nPerhaps Curry could revisit the idea of coaching basketball in the future. He will have plenty of options to choose from when it comes to his career after the NBA.\nRead more: Stephen A Smith Continues Feud With LeBron James After Strong Message\nThroughout his first 16 seasons in the NBA, all of which have come in Golden State, Curry has put up massive numbers. He has played in 1,026 games and made 1,020 starts, averaging 24.7 points, 6.4 assists, 4.7 rebounds, and 1.5 steals per game. Curry has also shot 47.1 percent from the floor and 42.3 percent from three-point range.\nIt will be interesting to see what the future holds for Curry after his playing career comes to an end. There is no question that he would be an excellent basketball coach at any level.\nFor more on the Golden State Warriors and general NBA news, head on over to Newsweek Sports.\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nAbout the writer\nEvan Massey is a sports reporter and analyst located in Indianapolis, Indiana who covers the NFL, NBA, MLB, WNBA, and ...

With Jayson Tatum sidelined due to a torn Achilles and both Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis gone after being traded during the offseason, the team looks a lot different.\nTatum might return at some point this year, but that is far from a guarantee. More than likely, the Celtics are entering a gap year.\nAssuming the upcoming season ends up being a gap year, it's an opportunity for Boston to build for a season before jumping back into contention in the 2026-26 campaign.\nWith that in mind, Brad Stevens might be open to making some moves. He has already been wheeling and dealing this offseason to get the Celtics under the second tax apron.\nRead more: Stephen A Smith Continues Feud With LeBron James After Strong Message\nNow, a new possibility has been brought up for Boston.\nHow about a trade with the Los Angeles Lakers for Bronny James? That may seem extremely wild, but it's something that has been suggested.\nBen Stinar of Sports Illustrated's Fastbreak On SI has brought up the idea for the Celtics. He made it clear that he isn't reporting Boston being interested in James, but rather suggesting that the fit could make a lot of sense.\n\"Even though there is no reported interest, the fit of Bronny in Boston would be intriguing,\" Stinar wrote. \"He would still be able to play for one of the most iconic franchises (which would be good for his brand), but would be away from the pressure that comes with playing next to his father in Los Angeles.\"\nHe continued on, writing more about why the Celtics would be a good fit for James and his development.\n\"In addition, the Celtics are also a team that has done a good job of developing talent,\" he wrote. \"From stars such as Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, to reserves like Payton Pritchard and Sam Hauser, the Celtics know how to get the most out of their roster. Bronny could go back and forth between the Maine Celtics and Boston.\"\nRead more: Ayesha Curry Reveals What Stephen Curry Wanted to Do Before NBA Stardom\nDuring his rookie season with the Lakers, James played in 27 games and made one start.

In the G-League, he averaged 21.9 points, 5.5 assists, 5.1 rebounds, and 1.9 steals per game in 11 appearances and shot 44 percent from the floor and 38 percent from three-point range.\nIt's unlikely that Boston would actually pull off a trade with Los Angeles for James.
