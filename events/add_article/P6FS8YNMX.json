      "summary": "Pro‑Palestinian protesters interrupted a Melbourne Symphony Orchestra performance at the BBC Proms, demanding the orchestra stop accepting what they called Zionist funding and citing the Gaza war. The demonstration halted the concert for over ten minutes, after which security removed the protesters and the audience booed the resumption. Jewish Artists for Palestine claimed responsibility, linking the protest to the MSO’s earlier cancellation of a pianist who had criticized Israel’s actions. The incident follows a history of similar disruptions at the Proms and highlights the growing politicisation of cultural events amid the Israel‑Gaza conflict.",
