      "summary": "Weight‑loss injections such as Mounjaro and Wegovy are increasingly used by brides in the UK, leading to rapid, unpredictable body‑weight changes that disrupt wedding dress fittings and force bridal companies to adjust scheduling and pricing. Seamstresses report a surge in last‑minute alterations, with some firms now charging extra for significant weight loss or limiting how many fittings a bride can have. The trend reflects broader growth in private weight‑loss drug use—estimated at 1.5 million UK users—with rising costs and a shift toward online purchasing. Bridal suppliers are adapting by tightening contracts, setting clearer timelines, and preparing for potential new‑dress requirements if weight loss exceeds a few sizes. The industry’s response highlights the intersection of consumer health trends and service‑delivery models in the wedding market.",
