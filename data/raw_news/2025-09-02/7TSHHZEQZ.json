  "description": "Boeing significantly cut its losses in the second quarter, marking another step forward on its path to recovery.",
  "content": "Though still burning through cash, Boeing significantly cut its losses in the second quarter, marking another step forward on its path to recovery.\n\nThe company on Tuesday reported a net loss of $612 million, or 92 cents per share, for the three months from April to June.\n\nDuring the same three months last year \u2014 when Boeing was still reeling after a panel flew off an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 midflight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane \u2014 Boeing lost $1.4 billion, or $2.33 per share.\n\nBoeing burned through $200 million in cash this quarter, compared with $4.3 billion in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nIn a note to employees Tuesday, CEO Kelly Ortberg said he was optimistic 2025 could be Boeing\u2019s \u201cturnaround year.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are building momentum in our recovery \u2026 Together, we\u2019ve notched some important wins reflecting the confidence customers have in our products and services, and we\u2019re taking the next steps to strengthen our culture and improve how we work together,\u201d Ortberg said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just over halfway through 2025 and I\u2019m pleased with our progress. Change takes time, but we\u2019re starting to see a difference in our performance across the business.\u201d\n\nOrtberg is coming up on one year as CEO, after taking over from Dave Calhoun in August 2024 in the wake of the Alaska Airlines panel blowout.\n\nSince then, Boeing has regained confidence among airline customers and Wall Street analysts as it continues to ramp up commercial production, with a focus on quality and safety metrics outlined with the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThe FAA still has a cap on Boeing\u2019s production of the 737 MAX at 38 planes per month, a threshold put in place to ensure the company prioritizes quality over speed, but Ortberg expects Boeing will seek permission to move beyond that threshold this year.\n\nBoeing is also increasing production of its 787 Dreamliner in South Carolina, saying on Tuesday it reached a rate of seven planes per month.\n\nMeanwhile, Boeing awaits FAA certification for new commercial models, including the 777X family and two MAX variants, the 737-7 and 737-10. Boeing on Tuesday confirmed it had delayed its timeline for the new MAX planes to 2026 because of an ongoing problem with the engine anti-ice system.\n\nOrtberg told employees Tuesday that the company was working on a solution but \u201cprogress on this solution has taken longer than we expected.\u201d\n\nIn the second quarter, Boeing\u2019s commercial airplane division reported $10.9 billion in revenue, an increase from $6 billion in the same three months last year.\n\nBoeing Global Services, which provides aftermarket solutions, saw revenue increase to $5.3 billion from $4.9 billion in 2024.\n\nBoeing\u2019s defense and space business reported $6.6 billion in revenue, compared with $6 billion in the second quarter last year.\n\nThe defense division did not face any write-offs, bucking its trend of expensive fixed-price contracts and cost overruns eating into its cash flow.\n\nIn March, Boeing won a contract to build the Air Force\u2019s future fighter jet, a victory over competitor Lockheed Martin and a much-needed boost for Boeing\u2019s struggling defense business.\n\nIn July, Boeing\u2019s defense division marked another victory when the Air Force agreed to buy up to 75 additional Everett-built KC-46 tankers. And Boeing secured a $2.8 billion contract from the Space Force to build two satellites for a satellite communications program.\n\nBoeing now faces the possibility of a work stoppage on its fighter jet production lines in St. Louis and St. Charles, Mo., and Mascoutah, Ill.\n\nOn Sunday, 3,200 unionized Machinists rejected the company\u2019s latest contract offer, opening up the possibility for a strike to begin Aug. 4.\n\nIn an interview on CNBC Tuesday morning, Ortberg said he didn\u2019t expect the work stoppage to \u201cderail\u201d Boeing\u2019s overall recovery. \u201cThis is something we\u2019ll work through,\u201d he said.\n\nThis year, Boeing also faced unexpected geopolitical hurdles as it often found itself at the center of President Donald Trump\u2019s international trade war.\n\nBoeing had to navigate the uncertainty of new tariffs that could raise the cost of aircraft parts shipped from around the world and complicate delivery of planes to international customers.\n\nAt the same time, it has benefited from some countries placing large aircraft orders to invest in American-made goods and curry favor with the presidential administration.\n\nThe latest trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union exempts aircraft and airplane parts from the taxes, providing relief the industry has been calling for since Trump proposed the new tariffs.\n\n\u201cI like the way this tariff situation is working out,\u201d Ortberg said on CNBC Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s good for our business. It\u2019s good for the aerospace industry in the U.S. It\u2019s going to create jobs and I think that\u2019s what the administration is focused on doing.\u201d\n\nBoeing\u2019s second quarter was largely marked by tragedy after a 787 crashed in Ahmedabad, India, on June 12, killing 241 of the 242 people on board and 19 people on the ground.\n\nWith very little information coming from accident investigators for weeks after the crash, aviation safety experts didn\u2019t rule out any possible causes. Initial speculation swirled around the quality of the 787 and its General Electric engines.\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to know exactly what went wrong, but India\u2019s civil aviation bureau said in a preliminary report this month that there are no recommended actions related to the 787 or GE engines.\n\nInvestigators are now focused on the pilots\u2019 actions, after information from the flight data recorder indicated one of the pilots may have cut power to the engines by flipping two fuel control switches.\n\nAs the investigation continues, Boeing and GE are limited in what they can say. It could take a year for investigators to release a final report with a probable cause.",

      "text": "In a major gesture toward Boeing\u2019s Puget Sound-area workforce, Kelly Ortberg, the new CEO of Boeing whose appointment was announced Wednesday morning, has chosen to be based in Seattle, according to a source familiar with the decision.\nThis step may indicate that the company\u2019s Virginia headquarters, after 23 years astray, will move back to where Boeing was born and where its heart as a commercial airplane manufacturer remains.\nBoeing has made no announcement to that effect.\nWith Ortberg\u2019s choice, along with Commercial Airplanes CEO Stephanie Pope, head engineer and Chief Technical Officer Todd Citron and other key executives already based here, the top leaders with control over the airplane-building business will all be in Seattle.\n\u201cOrtberg is an industry guy. He knows the heritage of Boeing. He knows the heritage of Seattle. It would make sense moving there, that he move the headquarters back,\u201d said Adam Pilarski, a veteran aviation analyst with consulting firm Avitas.\nBoeing moved its headquarters from Seattle to Chicago in 2001, then in 2022 to Arlington, Va., near its Pentagon customer. That\u2019s the base for a relatively small number of corporate employees, several hundred in a company that employs about 170,000 people globally.\nAnd since the COVID-19 pandemic, some of Boeing\u2019s top leaders \u2014 including current CEO Dave Calhoun, Chief Financial Officer Brian West, and Chief Communications Officer Brian Besanceney \u2014 have worked from home while traveling frequently around the company\u2019s major sites and have not spent the majority of their time in Arlington.\nU.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., chair of the Senate commerce committee, in a statement said, \u201cIt\u2019s a good first step that the CEO will be based in Seattle, and now the rest of the headquarters needs to move back home. \u2026\n\u201cWhen it comes to quality and safety, being close to the workforce on the ground matters.\u201d\nEarly Wednesday, Boeing announced that Ortberg, former chief executive of Iowa-based major avionics supplier Rockwell Collins, would replace Calhoun as Boeing CEO and president, effective Aug. 8.\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely honored and humbled to join this iconic company,\u201d said Ortberg in a statement. \u201cBoeing has a tremendous and rich history as a leader and pioneer in our industry, and I\u2019m committed to working together with the more than 170,000 dedicated employees of the company to continue that tradition, with safety and quality at the forefront.\u201d\nOrtberg, 64, retired in 2021, serves on several boards, and currently lives in Florida. The Boeing board is waiving the mandatory retirement age of 65 to give him time to turn things around.\nOrtberg, who has a degree in mechanical engineering, has worked as a leader in aerospace more than 35 years. He began his career in 1983 as an engineer at Texas Instruments, and then joined Rockwell Collins in 1987 as a program manager and held increasingly important leadership positions at the company before becoming its president and CEO in 2013.\nAfter five years leading Rockwell Collins, he steered the company\u2019s integration with United Technologies and RTX until his retirement from RTX in 2021.\nHe is the former chair of the Aerospace Industries Association Board of Governors.\nA bright day\nThe news of Ortberg\u2019s appointment was widely greeted with enthusiasm within the aviation world.\nKevin Michaels, founder of aerospace consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory and, in the late 1990s, a director of strategic development at Rockwell Collins, observed Ortberg\u2019s style back then.\nOn Wednesday, Michaels wrote on LinkedIn that Ortberg \u201cdid an amazing job.\u201d\nMichaels, an expert on the major aerospace suppliers, said Rockwell Collins was known for taking care of employees, customers, suppliers and the local community, as well as shareholders.\n\u201cCollins was highly profitable, yet innovative and consistently rated as the best supplier,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEmployees love the place. This is quite a contrast to other aerospace manufacturers and today\u2019s Boeing.\u201d\n\u201cAll in all, a bright day for our beloved industry. Go Kelly! Go Boeing!\u201d Michaels concluded.\nIn a note to investors, Wall Street analyst Rob Stallard of Vertical Research Partners wrote: \u201cWhat he brings to the party is not only a wealth of Aerospace & Defense experience, but also a track record of running a company with an excellent corporate culture.\u201d\n\u201cClearly there are a massive number of problems at Boeing, but with Kelly as CEO we think there is at least a chance of fixing them.\u201d\nRon Epstein, lead aerospace analyst with Bank of America, wrote that \u201cRockwell Collins fostered a strong culture, something that we think Boeing is in dire need of now.\u201d\nHe noted, however, that \u201cOrtberg is walking into a Boeing with a potential production strike in September, a Defense business that is limping along, and Commercial business that has lost the trust of regulators and the public.\u201d\nU.S. Rep. Rick Larsen, D-Everett, the lead Democrat on the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee, in a statement said he\u2019s \u201cencouraged\u201d by Ortberg\u2019s appointment, though he also added that the new CEO \u201chas his work cut out for him.\u201d\n\u201cFirst, he has to ensure a continued commitment to the safety and quality plan,\u201d Larsen said in a statement. \u201cSecond, he needs to listen to the women and men of the Machinists Union in the current labor negotiations.\u201d\nIn an interview Jon Holden, president of District 751 of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, welcomed Ortberg\u2019s move to the Puget Sound.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a positive thing. I think that\u2019ll put him closest to the economic driver of this company, and I hope that leads to success,\u201d Holden said.\nHolden went on to say he hopes Ortberg will work with the union, which is currently deep in contract negotiations with the company. A potential strike looms in September if those talks fail.\n\u201cHe needs the Machinists union more than ever now,\u201d Holden said. \u201cThere better be a partnership in the future, in order to solve a lot of the issues.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a commitment of not just the next airplane program, but a commitment that there will be a relationship to work on those issues.\u201d\nOn a company earnings call Wednesday morning, CEO Calhoun said he does not expect Kelly\u2019s appointment will lead immediately to other changes at the executive level.\n\u201cMy guess is he\u2019s going to put his arms around\u201d those already in place, including Commercial Airplanes chief Pope, who was also in the running for the top job.\nBoeing said Calhoun will stay on as a special adviser to the board until March.\nAccording to a financial filing Wednesday, for the remainder of 2024 from Aug. 8, Ortberg will get a cash payment of $1.25 million in December, plus stock awards valued at $16 million in two sets, one vesting in installments over three years, the other over four years.\nIn 2025, in his first full year as CEO, Ortberg will get an annual base salary of $1.5 million; an annual bonus target of $3 million, with the actual payout based on company performance; and an incentive award target of $17.5 million in stock, vesting over three years, again with the actual payout based on company performance.\nThe Boeing board agreed to cover his expenses in relocating to Seattle.\nSo Ortberg\u2019s total compensation this year will be $17.25 million and next year $22 million. For comparison, Calhoun\u2019s total compensation in 2023 was $33 million.\nOrtberg will take over at Boeing next week immediately after hearings by the National Transportation Safety Board on Aug. 6 and 7 into the incident in January when a fuselage panel blew out on an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX, leaving a large hole in the passenger cabin and depressurizing the jet.\nAfter that incident, the Federal Aviation Administration forced Boeing to slow production in order to gain control of manufacturing quality.\nThat slowdown, along with problems in Boeing\u2019s faltering defense division, has left the company bleeding cash.\nThat was clear from Wednesday\u2019s quarterly financial results: a net loss of $1.4 billion and an outflow during the three months of more than $4 billion in cash.\nBoeing\u2019s net debt has now risen above $45 billion. And it will take on an additional $3.6 billion of debt when it closes the deal to acquire Spirit AeroSystems.\nClearly, Ortberg faces an enormous challenge to restore Boeing\u2019s reputation and culture while shoring up its dire financial condition.\n\u201cBoeing overall,\u201d wrote Bank of America\u2019s Epstein, \u201chas a long road ahead.\u201d\nSeattle Times reporter Lauren Rosenblatt contributed to this report.\nThe opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times."

      "text": "With conclusive information hard to come by five weeks after the fatal Air India crash, the aviation industry has shifted its focus to the possibility of pilot error.\nIt\u2019s too soon to know what brought down a Boeing 787 plane moments after takeoff from Ahmedabad, India, on June 12. It could be months before investigators from India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau release the final report with a probable cause, and that report may not settle the issue.\nBut after a preliminary report published last week, aviation safety experts have started to consider whether the crash was the result of human action.\nThe preliminary report from Indian aviation authorities indicated one of the pilots cut power to both engines by moving two switches that control the flow of fuel. The switches moved from the \u201crun\u201d to \u201ccutoff\u201d position seconds after takeoff, with just one second between the two movements, the report said.\nSome conclusions can be drawn from that cursory information, according to former accident investigators and aviation safety consultants who spoke with The Seattle Times this week. But why one of the pilots would have moved the switches isn\u2019t among the questions it can answer \u2014 and is the biggest focus for the rest of the investigation.\nAt this stage, the preliminary report points to pilot error, in part because the report lowers the likelihood of other scenarios, said Mike Dunlop, an aviation expert, author and founder of supply management software company Net-Inspect.\n\u201cFrom a mechanical, software, electronic standpoint, I cannot think of any possible combination of events that could cause what happened when it happened,\u201d Dunlop said.\n\u201cThe simplest explanation is almost always the one that happened,\u201d he said. Any other theories would require \u201ctoo many coincidences.\u201d\nStill, other experts say it\u2019s premature to rule out other causes, including manufacturing, electrical or maintenance errors that may have led both engines to lose power or influenced the pilots\u2019 behavior.\nSpeculation about intentional acts by one of the pilots has been met with criticism from unions and advocacy groups representing pilots in India, as well as India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, which is helping with the investigation.\nThe Air Line Pilots Association, a global union, doesn\u2019t comment on active investigations but said in a statement, \u201cit\u2019s vital that all factors are thoroughly and exhaustively evaluated. \u2026 Engaging in speculation only serves to hamper and undermine the ongoing investigation.\u201d\nEarly theories\nThe preliminary report did rule out a few possible causes, including that the crash was the result of fuel contamination or that the flaps and slats on the airplane\u2019s wings were incorrectly positioned.\nThe report also noted the lowered position of the landing gear, another early hypothesis, was consistent with the two engines losing power.\nIn the flight\u2019s final seconds, the cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why they had moved the engine fuel control switches, effectively cutting power to both engines, according to the preliminary report. The other pilot responded that they had not done so.\nThe preliminary report did not specify which pilot was talking when, so it\u2019s not clear who moved the switches. First Officer Clive Kunder was flying the plane, while Capt. Sumeet Sabharwal, the more senior pilot, was monitoring.\nMedia reports this week said it was likely the captain who moved the switches, with the first officer asking why he had done so.\nThe reports cited anonymous sources, drawing complaints from accident investigators and organizations representing pilots.\nNTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said Friday that \u201crecent media reports \u2026 are premature and speculative.\u201d\nThe Federation of Indian Pilots pointed some of the blame back to accident investigators, writing in a Wednesday letter that the preliminary report \u201cappears to rely selectively on paraphrased cockpit voice recordings to suggest pilot error and question the professional competence and integrity of the flight crew.\u201d\n\u201cAssigning blame before a thorough, transparent and data-driven investigation is both premature and irresponsible,\u201d the advocacy group continued.\nComplete inspections\nTo flip the engine fuel control switches, positioned between two metal guards near the aircraft throttles between the cockpit seats, pilots must make two movements \u2014 a pull up and over. That makes it difficult to accidentally move them, the aviation experts said.\nThe preliminary report resurfaced a 2018 bulletin from the Federal Aviation Administration following reports that the mechanism on some 737s had been installed with the locking feature disengaged.\nThe bulletin recommended inspections for other models with similar fuel control switches, including the 787.\nAir India did not perform the inspections because they were recommended, not required, according to the preliminary report. But it did replace the throttle control module, which includes the switches, on the Everett-built plane in 2019 and 2023, for reasons unrelated to the switches.\nAfter the preliminary report\u2019s release, India and South Korea ordered airlines to inspect engine fuel control switches on their 787 fleets.\nAir India said Wednesday it had completed the inspections and did not find any problems, according to The Times of India.\n\u201cConclusive\u201d findings\nEven without the recent media reports, some former accident investigators said the preliminary report included enough information to determine the crash was the result of pilot action.\nInvestigators \u201cdidn\u2019t tell us everything,\u201d said John Nance, a former pilot, aviation safety analyst and author. \u201cBut what they did say, conclusively, says not only did a human being cut off the two fuel control switches one at a time, but the facts as presented preclude any other explanation.\u201d\nNance ruled out the possibility of a mechanical or electrical error because the two switches flipped about one second apart. If there had been some sort of system failure, he would expect them to flip simultaneously.\nDunlop similarly said the one-second difference pointed toward intentional pilot action.\nOne of the pilots later flipped the switches back to the \u201crun\u201d position, and the engines began to relight but did not have enough time or altitude to fully restart before the plane crashed. The fact that the engines started cycling again, Dunlop said, indicates the systems were working properly.\nA commercial pilot would know that cutting power to both engines at that stage of the flight was almost guaranteed to be catastrophic, Dunlop said.\nThe first five to 10 seconds and 500 to 600 feet of climb are the \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d for any flight, he said.\nDunlop said the flight data recorders could provide more evidence to rule out the possibility of a software, mechanical or electronic issue. Because the switches make a clicking sound when manually moved, the recorder could have captured the movement.\nTo listen for that sound, investigators have to strip out all the other noise collected by the flight data recorders, said Dunlop. That leaves them with just the background noise.\nThen, investigators would record the click of the fuel engine switches moving on another plane and try to match that sound to anything they hear in the cockpit voice recorder from the fatal flight.\n\u201cA hard thing to answer\u201c\nInvestigators will now scour the pilots\u2019 medical histories, said Jeff Guzzetti, a former accident investigator with the FAA and NTSB.\nThat means talking with the pilots\u2019 families, friends and associates, as well as anyone who spoke with them before the fatal flight, to get a sense of their moods. Investigators will also speak with the physicians who cleared the pilots to fly, consider any medications they were taking and determine if there were any life events that may have altered their mental states.\nHistorically, in cases where a plane crash was the result of an intentional act by the pilot, there have been \u201cclear signs,\u201d Guzzetti said. In this case, it\u2019s too soon to have identified those signs and, Guzzetti said, it\u2019s too soon to know if the action was intentional or not.\n\u201cI know the easiest, most plausible theory is an intentional act to crash the airplane, but I just think it\u2019s way too early,\u201d Guzzetti said. \u201cI think there needs to be a lot of thought behind why they would have moved those switches.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t surprised that investigators didn\u2019t identify which pilot was speaking in the preliminary report. That\u2019s either because they\u2019re not entirely sure or because they are hesitant to indict someone at this stage of the investigation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for people in aviation to wrap their minds around an intentional act,\u201d Guzzetti said. \u201cWhy would a pilot ever want to do this? It\u2019s a hard thing to answer.\u201d\nThe opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times."

      "text": "Investigators may soon release preliminary information about the fatal Air India Boeing 787 crash that happened last month.\nFollowing guidelines from the International Civil Aviation Organization \u2014 a United Nations agency that recommends practices for the industry \u2014 states in charge of an investigation must submit a preliminary report within 30 days of an accident.\nIt\u2019s not clear how detailed that much-anticipated report will be; according to ICAO guidelines, authorities don\u2019t even have to release it to the public. But aviation industry watchers largely expect some details to be released as early as Friday, the 30-day mark since the June 12 crash.\nAs that deadline approaches, accident investigators have narrowed their focus, according to media reports this week.\nCiting anonymous sources familiar with the investigation, aviation trade publication The Air Current and Reuters news service reported that investigators are focused on the engine fuel control switches \u2014 two switches that, if pulled while in flight, cut power to the engines.\nWhile the leaked information may provide some clues about what went wrong, it doesn\u2019t definitively answer any questions or rule out any possibilities, according to aviation experts who spoke with The Seattle Times.\nA confusing loss of thrust\nThe switches \u2014 small black knobs nestled among several flight controls in the cockpit \u2014 each connect to one of the plane\u2019s engines.\nPilots typically use the switches while on the ground for engine start and shutdown but can also use them in-flight to manually stop and restart an engine, if something goes wrong while in the air.\nTo switch between the \u201crun\u201d and \u201ccutoff\u201d settings, pilots have to pull the switch up and over, a two-step process designed to prevent the flight crew from accidentally cutting power.\nAccident investigators are looking at movement of those switches, the media reports said, without specifying the type of movement or what that could mean about the cause of the crash.\nIt\u2019s not clear if the pilots moved the engine fuel control switches or, if so, why they would.\nIt\u2019s also not clear if the investigators are focused on movement of one or both switches, though experts told The Seattle Times that pilots would never be trained to flip both at once. Because the plane is designed to fly safely with just one engine, pilots would instead cut power only to the engine that needed to be shut down because of something like a bird strike or a fire.\nSo far, there has not been any indication that external factors like a bird strike impacted Air India Flight 171.\nIt does appear there was a loss of power to both engines, aviation experts told The Seattle Times last week, before the new information on the focus of the investigation leaked. But it\u2019s still not clear what caused the engines to seemingly fail less than a minute after takeoff.\nQuestions linger\nIt\u2019s unusual that pilots would flip the engine fuel control switches so early in a flight, said Mike Dostert, a former engineer with the Federal Aviation Administration and now a member of the flight safety advocacy group, The Foundation for Aviation Safety.\nBut he wasn\u2019t dismissing any theories just yet.\nIt\u2019s possible the pilots made a mistake, Dostert said, perhaps intending to retract the flaps or the landing gear but inadvertently flipping the engine fuel control switches instead. It\u2019s also possible the pilots meant to cut power to one engine but flipped the wrong switch, leaving the plane with two disabled engines.\nAt the same time, it\u2019s possible there was a problem with the fuel cutoff system, Dostert said, leaving open the theory that the issue was \u201cairplane related.\u201d\nJoe Jacobsen, an aerospace engineer who also works with The Foundation for Aviation Safety, introduced yet another possibility: The pilots may have flipped the engine fuel control switches because there was already something going wrong, like the plane was already losing thrust.\n\u201cThe only thing that made sense to me is if the thrust was rolling back or had some system failure where the engines were both rolling back,\u201d Jacobsen said.\nThat could lead the pilots to think \u201cmaybe there\u2019s something going on with the fuel cutoff switches,\u201d Jacobsen continued. \u201cWe\u2019ll cycle them and maybe that\u2019ll bring it back \u2014 sort of an act of desperation-type thing.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would you be messing with both of them if you\u2019re getting the thrust you expected?\u201d he added.\nJacobsen suspects a cascading electrical failure led both engines to fail, a theory he held before the focus on the fuel engine control switches leaked.\n\u201cSomebody screwed up somewhere\u201d\nInformation from the 787\u2019s flight data recorders should give investigators some of these answers, as well as other clues, like whether both engines went down and whether one lost power before the other. The cockpit voice recorder could also help investigators understand what actions pilots took and why.\nIn the meantime, Dostert said he\u2019s \u201cwithholding judgment.\u201d\n\u201cThese initial reports that come out, you\u2019ve got to be a little bit careful,\u201d he said, recounting past accidents where investigators substantially changed their thinking over time.\nRichard Reed, another former FAA safety engineer, agreed that it was too soon to come to any conclusions.\nBut, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason why this should have happened,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody screwed up somewhere.\u201d\nThe opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times."

      "text": "The two engines on the Air India flight shut down within one second of each other before the Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed last month in Ahmedabad, India, killing at least 260 people, according to a preliminary report released Friday.\nBoth engine fuel control switches that, if pulled while in flight, cut power to the engines, transitioned from the \u201crun\u201d to \u201ccutoff\u201d settings as the plane took off, according to the report. That deprived the engines of fuel, preventing the plane from being able to lift off.\nIn the recovered cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why he cut off fuel to the engine. The other pilot responded that he didn\u2019t, according to the 15-page report. Soon after the switches were turned back to \u201crun\u201d and one engine began regaining thrust, but it wasn\u2019t enough to stop the plane from crashing.\nThe Everett-built Boeing 787 then crashed in the northwestern Indian city of Ahmedabad less than a minute after takeoff, killing 241 of the 242 people on board and 19 people on the ground, according to the most recent estimates from local authorities.\nThe preliminary report, released by India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, comes about a month after the fatal crash, following guidelines from the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency that recommends practices for the industry.\nIndia\u2019s civil aviation authority is leading the investigation, with support from the U.S. and the U.K., which had several citizens on board the London-bound plane.\nThe report said at this investigation stage, there are no recommended actions for Boeing, which manufactures the Dreamliner, or General Electric, the engine maker, or their operators.\nTwo aviation experts, however, cautioned Friday against immediately pointing to pilot error.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we know that yet. It could be a system failure that causes this to happen,\u201d said Joe Jacobsen, a retired Federal Aviation Administration safety engineer. \u201cWe have evidence saying \u2018he didn\u2019t do so.\u2019 To me if you take that on face value, then it\u2019s a system failure and not a pilot action.\u201d\nThe switches require a two-step process to go back and forth between the settings to prevent the flight crew from accidentally cutting power to the engines. The switch makes a clicking sound when activated, but there is no mention of such a sound in the preliminary report. That\u2019s critical to finding out whether one of the pilots did switch the settings, said Mike Dostert, a former FAA engineer.\nThe report doesn\u2019t specify which of the two pilots asked the other about the switches. Both pilots had an adequate rest period before the flight, underwent preflight breath analyzer tests and were deemed fit to fly, according to the report. The first officer was flying the plane and the captain was monitoring during takeoff.\nThe takeoff weight was within the allowable limits, and there were no \u201cdangerous goods\u201d on the plane, according to the report. There was no significant bird activity in the flight path.\nBoeing and General Electric offered to support the investigation and Air India. Both companies have been limited in what they can say as the investigation is ongoing.\n\u201cOur thoughts remain with the loved ones of the passengers and crew on board Air India Flight 171, as well as everyone affected on the ground in Ahmedabad. We continue to support the investigation and our customer,\u201d Boeing said in a statement Friday.\nThe plane crashed into a medical hostel roughly 1 mile from the airport. It was the first fatal crash involving a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the jetmaker\u2019s smaller widebody plane.\nWith few official updates from accident investigators, the aviation industry and flying public have been searching for answers about what went wrong.\nThe new information matches media reports this week that, citing anonymous sources, said that investigators were focused on the engine fuel control switches.\nAviation experts who spoke with The Seattle Times over the last month shared a long list of possibilities and were reluctant to rule anything out, noting that the circumstances of the crash were unusual.\nThe opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times."

      "text": "Under intense political pressure, Boeing on Monday withdrew its request for an exemption from key safety regulations to allow the 737 MAX 7 to be certified to carry passengers.\n\u201cWe have informed the FAA that we are withdrawing our request for a time-limited exemption relating to the engine inlet de-icing system on the 737-7,\u201d Boeing said in a statement. \u201cWe will instead incorporate an engineering solution that will be completed during the certification process.\u201d\nThis means entry into passenger service of the MAX 7, the smallest model of the MAX family, will be significantly delayed until Boeing can design a fix for the flawed design and get it approved by the Federal Aviation Administration.\nIt will cut Boeing\u2019s promised cash flow for the year, though by how much is not yet clear. And key MAX 7 customer Southwest Airlines, which has 302 of the jets on order, faces inevitable delivery delays.\nScrutiny of Boeing has intensified since a Jan. 5 incident in which a piece of fuselage blew out of another MAX, the longer MAX 9.\nU.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who last week was the first in Congress to call for the FAA to deny the exemption, said Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told her Monday that Boeing has come to an agreement with Southwest over the delay in delivering the jet.\n\u201cThis was a tough decision on their part, but I\u2019m glad they took it because I think this is good for Boeing\u2019s future and also for America\u2019s flying public,\u201d Duckworth said in an interview.\nLast week Southwest announced that it had taken the MAX 7 out of its plans for this year.\nExemption requested for serious design flaw\nThe FAA had determined last summer that a design flaw uncovered in the MAX\u2019s engine inlet de-icing system could be potentially catastrophic.\nThe MAX\u2019s engine inlet, the circular part at the front end of the pod surrounding the engine \u2014 known as a nacelle \u2014 is made from carbon composite, unlike earlier model 737s, which have a metal inlet.\nFlying through cold, water-saturated air, the de-icing system \u2014 similar in purpose to the defroster on a car \u2014 blows hot air onto the engine inlet to prevent a buildup of ice.\nBut Boeing discovered after the MAX entered service that if the system remained switched on after leaving the icy air, it could overheat and damage the composite structure, possibly leading it to break off the nacelle.\nIn an August Airworthiness Directive, the FAA stated that debris from such a breakup could penetrate the fuselage, putting passengers seated at windows behind the wings in danger, and could damage the wing or tail of the plane, \u201cwhich could result in loss of control of the airplane.\u201d\nBoeing assessed the risk of this scenario as \u201cextremely improbable,\u201d and so the FAA allowed the MAXs currently in service, the MAX 8 and MAX 9, to continue flying \u2014 but with a directive to pilots that they must turn the system off after leaving icy air and not fly with it on for more than five minutes in dry air.\nHowever, that compromise solution couldn\u2019t work for a jet like the MAX 7 that is not yet certified. To get that approval to carry passengers, it must meet all safety regulations.\nHence Boeing\u2019s petition for a formal exemption for the MAX 7 from the safety standards until it designed a solution.\nBoeing in December asked for an exemption through June 2026 so the MAX 7 could be certified and enter service this year with Southwest while Boeing worked on a fix for the flawed system.\nBoeing argued that, meanwhile, the MAX 7 would be just as safe as the two MAX models that are already cleared to fly.\nAlaska Airlines incident changes calculus\nAt the end of 2023, the FAA was expected to grant that petition as early as this month. But the blowout of a piece of fuselage on an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 over Portland on Jan. 5 changed that prospect dramatically.\nAs the National Transportation Safety Board investigation into that incident continues, Boeing\u2019s safety culture has come under intense scrutiny.\nThe Allied Pilots Association, the union representing 15,000 American Airlines pilots, opposed granting the exemption on the grounds that it wasn\u2019t good enough to rely on pilots remembering to turn off the system when not doing so could be catastrophic.\nThe union and various aviation safety experts urged Boeing instead to expedite a design fix. That is Boeing\u2019s new plan.\nDuckworth \u2014 chair of the Aviation Safety Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation \u2014 urged this shift when she met with CEO Calhoun in her office for 90 minutes on Thursday.\nShe said the FAA has never granted certification to a new airplane with a known fault and told Calhoun that doing so now would be \u201csetting a new low in safety standards.\u201d\n\u201cOver the course of pretty intense discussion, we got to a point where he said that he would look at it and get back to me,\u201d Duckworth said, declaring herself \u201cpleasantly surprised\u201d at Boeing\u2019s quick about-face Monday.\n\u201cThis is a good solid step toward renewing the culture of safety that Boeing used to lead the world in,\u201d said Duckworth, a former U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter pilot who in 2004 lost both legs in combat during the second battle for Fallujah in Iraq.\n\u201cBoeing is a great company. A Boeing jet flew me into combat and a Boeing took me home when I was wounded,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I want nothing but success for Boeing.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear how quickly Boeing engineers can devise a fix for the engine inlet de-icing system and get it approved.\n\u201cAs always, the FAA will determine the timing of certification and we will follow their lead every step of the way,\u201d Boeing\u2019s statement said.\nCompany spokesperson Bobbie Egan said how soon Boeing can come up with a fix will be discussed publicly Wednesday when Calhoun holds a fourth-quarter earnings call with financial analysts.\nDuckworth said Calhoun had told her Thursday that he was \u201cvery confident that they would have a fix before 2026.\u201d\nWhen Boeing does come up with a technical solution, it will also have to be retrofitted to the MAX 8s and MAX 9s flying today, though there\u2019s no timeline yet for this to happen.\nAPA pilot union spokesperson Dennis Tajer said Monday that Boeing\u2019s decision to withdraw its MAX 7 safety exemption request is \u201cgood news for MAX airplanes not yet certified.\u201d\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve got miles to go before we rest,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are hundreds of airplanes flying with this same exposure, dependent on pilot memory to avoid a failure.\u201d\n\u201cWe need the engine anti-ice issue resolved on the hundreds of MAX airplanes that are flying today,\u201d Tajer said.\nSen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., chair of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, who on Thursday had backed Duckworth\u2019s call for the FAA to deny Boeing\u2019s petition, echoed Tajer\u2019s reaction.\n\u201cThis is good news,\u201d Cantwell said in a statement. \u201cI hope this means [Boeing] can quickly develop a compliant design across other MAX planes.\u201d\nThe opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times."

      "text": "Boeing continued on its path to recovery in June, recording its highest number of 737 MAX deliveries since the end of 2023 and its best delivery rate for the first half of the year since 2018.\nIn a monthly recap of airplane orders and deliveries, Boeing said Tuesday it delivered 60 airplanes last month and 150 planes in the second quarter of the year, which includes April, May and June.\nIn the first six months of 2025, Boeing delivered 280 planes, the company continued, marking its best second quarter and best first half of the year since 2018.\nThat year proved to be a pivotal moment for Boeing after a 737 MAX plane crashed in Indonesia in October 2018, killing 189 people. Months later, in March 2019, another 737 MAX crashed in Ethiopia, killing 157 people and grounding the plane as Boeing worked to fix a software error that brought both planes down.\nThen, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted air travel and the aerospace supply chain, further hampering production rates as Boeing worked to recover from the deadly MAX crashes.\nIn January 2024, Boeing faced another setback when a panel flew off an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX midflight, leading the Federal Aviation Administration to cap Boeing\u2019s MAX production rate as it worked to improve its processes and safety culture.\nBoeing executives have repeatedly said they are seeing improvement and the company has ramped up production in the first half of 2025. In May, Boeing reached the FAA\u2019s production threshold and \u201crolled out\u201d 38 737 MAX planes, meaning 38 planes moved through the production line and out of the factory but not necessarily to customers.\nIn June, Boeing delivered 42 MAX planes, but it did not specify how many of those planes moved through the factory that month versus how many had already been ready for delivery.\nThe company would need to ask the FAA for permission to begin increasing MAX production above the 38 threshold, something that CEO Kelly Ortberg has said he hopes will happen this year.\nIn the meantime, analysts are optimistic about Boeing\u2019s incremental production increases, with many saying the company is on the right track. Credit rating agency Fitch Ratings last month upgraded Boeing\u2019s status, from negative to stable, citing production improvements and, as a result, more financial flexibility.\nAside from its popular 737 MAX, Boeing delivered nine 787 widebody planes in June, four 777 freighters and five 767s. Of those 767 planes, three went to Boeing\u2019s defense division for the KC-46 tanker program.\nEight of the 60 airplanes delivered last month went to customers in China. That\u2019s a noteworthy development after Boeing got caught in the geopolitical trade war between the U.S. and China earlier this year. China temporarily stopped accepting airplane deliveries to avoid paying hefty tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.\nThrough the end of June, Boeing delivered 280 planes, including 209 from the MAX family, 37 787s, 20 777s and 14 767s.\nWhen it comes to orders, Boeing booked 116 gross orders in June, including 54 for the 737 MAX and 62 for the 787 Dreamliner.\nThat\u2019s a dip from last month, where Boeing reported a staggering 303 gross orders, including a deal with Qatar Airways for 120 787s and 30 777Xs announced during President Trump\u2019s visit to the Middle East.\nOf the MAX orders placed in June, 12 were for Alaska Airlines while the remaining 42 were listed as unidentified. Singapore Airlines also canceled an order for three 737 MAX planes.\nWith cancellations and adjustments for strict accounting principles, Boeing recorded 70 net orders in June.\nBoeing\u2019s European rival Airbus delivered 63 planes to 35 customers in June, the company reported Tuesday. That brings its yearly delivery total to 306, slightly higher than Boeing\u2019s 280.\nThe European manufacturer booked 203 gross orders in June, Airbus said Tuesday, including some orders announced last month at the Paris Air Show, a trade event where aerospace companies gather to showcase the future of the industry.\nBoeing, meanwhile, did not make any announcements at the air show. The company canceled most of its public appearances after the fatal crash of an Air India Boeing 787 days before the show was set to begin.\nInvestigators are still determining the cause of the crash.\nThis story has been updated to include monthly orders and deliveries from Airbus.\nThe opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times."

      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump announced Friday that Boeing will build the Air Force\u2019s future fighter jet, which the Pentagon says will have stealth and penetration capabilities that far exceed those of its current fleet and is essential in a potential conflict with China.\nKnown as Next Generation Air Dominance, or NGAD, the manned jet will serve as quarterback to a fleet of future drone aircraft designed to be able to penetrate the air defenses of China and any other potential foes. The initial contract to proceed with production on a version for the Air Force is worth an estimated $20 billion.\nThe 47th president, who announced the award at the White House with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Air Force leadership, said with a grin that the new fighter would be named the F-47.\nGen. David Allvin, chief of staff of the Air Force, said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to write the next generation of modern aerial warfare with this.\u201d And Hegseth said the future fleet \u201csends a very clear, direct message to our allies that we\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d\nCritics have questioned the cost and the necessity of the program as the Pentagon is still struggling to fully produce its current most advanced jet, the F-35, which is expected to cost taxpayers more than $1.7 trillion over its lifespan. In addition, the Pentagon\u2019s future stealth bomber, the B-21 Raider, will have many of the same cutting edge technologies in advanced materials, AI, propulsion and stealth.\nMore than 1,100 F-35s have already been built for the U.S. and multiple international partners.\nA fleet of about 100 future B-21 stealth bombers at an estimated total cost of at least $130 billion is also planned. The first B-21 aircraft are now in test flights.\nWith evolving drone and space warfare likely to be the center of any fight with China, Dan Grazier, a military procurement analyst, questions whether \u201canother exquisite manned fighter jet really is the right platform going forward.\u201d Grazier, director of the national security reform program at the Stimson Center, said $20 billion is \u201cjust seed money. The total costs coming down the road will be hundreds of billions of dollars.\u201d\nFew details of what the new NGAD fighter would look like have been public, although Trump said early versions have been conducting test flights for the last five years. Renderings by both Lockheed Martin and Boeing have highlighted a flat, tail-less aircraft with a sharp nose.\nThe selection of Boeing, which has faced intense pressure from Trump over cost overruns and program delays on Air Force One, came after an independent analysis by the Air Force, an official said on the condition of anonymity to provide additional details on the selection. The Boeing offer was still determined to be the \u201cbest overall value to the government,\u201d the official said.\nThe Air Force has not specified how many aircraft will be produced. In a statement, however, Allvin said there would be more F-47s produced than F-22s, the advanced fighter jet it\u2019s replacing. There are now about 180 F-22 fighter jets in service.\nThe Air Force later issued a statement saying the number 47 was chosen for a number of reasons: \u201cIt honors the legacy of the P-47, whose contributions to air superiority during World War II remain historic. Additionally, the number pays tribute to the founding year of the Air Force, while also recognizing the 47th President\u2019s pivotal support for the development of the world\u2019s first sixth-generation fighter.\u201d\nA separate Navy contract for its version of the NGAD fighter is still under competition between Northrop Grumman and Boeing.\nLast year, the Biden administration\u2019s Air Force secretary, Frank Kendall, ordered a pause on the NGAD program to review if the aircraft was still needed or if the program, which was first designed in 2018, needed to be modified to reflect the past few years of warfighting advances.\nThat review by think tanks and academia examined what conflict with China would look like with NGAD and then without it \u2014 and determined that NGAD was still needed. Kendall then left the decision on which firm would build the fighter jet to the incoming Trump administration, a defense official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to provide details on the decision-making.\nNGAD will bring \u201can entirely different level of low observability,\u201d the official said. It will also have a much longer range than the F-35 or other current fighter jets, so it will require less refueling. A future unmanned version of NGAD also is planned as the Pentagon improves the AI for the aircraft, the official said."

      "text": "LE BOURGET, France \u2014 After years of setbacks, Boeing says the newest members of its 777X family are on track to enter the market this decade.\nJustin Hale, Boeing\u2019s customer lead for those new family members, laid out the anticipated timeline at the Paris Air Show, standing inside a mock cabin of the new widebody plane with reporters scattered in the passenger seats.\nFirst, the 777-9, set to become Boeing\u2019s largest widebody on the market, would enter service next year, Hale said. Then, the new 777-8 freighter would launch in 2028. Finally, the smaller passenger variant, 777-8, would enter service \u201ctoward the end of the decade.\u201d\nThat timeline has been years in the making and pushed back several times. Boeing introduced the new 777X family more than a decade ago and has yet to receive certification from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly passengers.\nThe new plane has been stymied by manufacturing defects and heightened regulatory scrutiny following two 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019. Those crashes, largely caused by an error in a new software system on the MAX, revealed a lack of oversight by the safety regulator as it was considering Boeing\u2019s new model. The Department of Justice later accused Boeing of misleading the FAA about the new software system.\nWith the MAX crashes hanging over Boeing and the FAA, the first of the 777X family, the 777-9, was stuck in unofficial test flights for four years.\nNow, Boeing is optimistic that it is nearing the finish line. The company said it found a solution to the latest manufacturing defect that halted test flights last year. And, it is \u201cencouraged with the new FAA leadership,\u201d Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said in an interview with trade publication Aviation Week ahead of the Paris Air Show.\nOrtberg said Boeing and regulators need to \u201cwork together to streamline\u201d the certification process. \u201cIt has gotten way too elongated,\u201d he continued, adding that \u201cwe\u2019ve seen progress.\u201d\n\u201cBut there\u2019s still a lot of work to do, particularly on the 777X, to get that certification complete,\u201d Ortberg said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be a continued focus for us for the rest of the year.\u201d\nBoeing\u2019s customers are also starting to believe the timeline. John Plueger, CEO of aircraft lessor Air Lease, said in an interview at the air show that \u201cabsent any other major findings,\u201d he agrees with Ortberg that the 777X could be entering service next year.\nThe largest launch in \u2018aviation history\u2019\nBoeing officially introduced the 777X in 2013 at the Dubai Air Show. The new widebody plane generated so much customer interest that Boeing\u2019s CEO at the time, James McNerney, said it was \u201cpart of the largest commercial launch in aviation history.\u201d\nThe 777X family is an upgraded version of Boeing\u2019s 777 twinjet, which debuted in the mid-1990s.\nIt is larger and more fuel-efficient than other widebodies on the market, Boeing says, featuring wings so long that Boeing added foldable wingtips to allow the plane to fit into airports.\nThe plane is powered by the largest jet engines ever built.\nBoeing started production for the 777X in Everett in 2017, matching the expectation it outlined when it debuted the plane in Dubai. But it faced years of production delays and quality concerns.\nThe 777X, now commonly used to refer to the 777-9, started flying in 2020 but the FAA didn\u2019t grant approval to officially start test flights, with the regulator in the cockpit, until July 2024.\nThat approval marked a significant step forward for the long-delayed plane, but roughly one month later, Boeing faced another setback. After one of the test planes landed in Hawaii, inspectors found a crack in a structural component that connects the plane\u2019s engine to the airframe.\nIn inspections of two other active 777X test planes, Boeing found similar cracks.\nFixing the thrust link\nThe cracks had appeared in the thrust link, a titanium structure that transfers the thrust load from the engine to the airframe.\nBecause the 777X was so much larger than Boeing\u2019s other planes, it required a larger thrust link than Boeing had ever built, the company said in a May blog post. That meant it could show some \u201cunique behaviors,\u201d Tresha Lacaux, the 777-9 chief project engineer, said in the post.\nAfter analysis in an Everett research center and more flight testing, Boeing determined that the cracks occurred when there was only a narrow gap for airflow between the thrust link and a nearby cooling port. That led to the thrust link vibrating and cracking.\nTo test their theory, Boeing engineers used leaf blowers to simulate high-speed airflow.\nAs a fix, Boeing\u2019s engineering team developed straps to secure blankets that were near the thrust link and ensure enough room for air to flow through the machine.\nThe company also plans to close the cooling port near the left-side thrust link and increase the thickness of the titanium part by two-hundredths of an inch to further reduce the likelihood of vibration.\nSince then, the \u201cthrust links have performed without issue,\u201d Anita Rudack, the 777-9 deputy chief project engineer, said in the company blog post.\nThe new family\nIn the long lead-up to launch, Boeing has secured 535 orders for the 777X family from 14 airlines, Hale said Wednesday at the Air Show.\nHale said the 777-8 will enter service just as the 777-300ER fleet, which Boeing first flew in 2003, is nearing retirement, calling it \u201cideally timed\u201d to fill that need. The 777-8 is 3 meters shorter than that plane, but Hale said Boeing moved the location of doors to slightly increase the number of seats in the new plane.\nThe 777-9, meanwhile, will be a \u201cgrowth\u201d plane, Hale continued. It is 3 meters longer than 777-300 ER, with room for 30 more passengers.\nStanding in the mock cabin on display at the Air Show, Hale introduced some of the interior features that, he says, make the new plane a \u201cflagship experience\u201d for flyers. The cabin is 4 inches wider, with wider seats, and has concave stow bins for luggage, giving it a more spacious feeling. The windows are placed higher on the sidewall to align passengers\u2019 view with the horizon and give more middle-seat travelers a sense of what\u2019s outside.\n\u201cFor our customers, this is a canvas that they can work with,\u201d Hale said.\nThe freighter, meanwhile, will replace the aging 747 cargo variant, which is nearing retirement, Hale said. Compared to the 777-200 freighter that is in service today, the new 777 variant would be 7 meters longer, accommodating up to seven more pallets of cargo.\nFurther delays \u2018only hurt\u2019\nWhile confident in its certification, Plueger from Air Lease said he doesn\u2019t have any 777X planes on his order book. The customer base is still too narrow.\n\u201cWhen I order an aircraft, especially a widebody, it\u2019s pretty easy to place that aircraft when it\u2019s brand new,\u201d Plueger said. \u201cThe question we always have to ask ourselves is after the first 10-, 12-year lease, who is going to take that airplane as a used aircraft from that point?\u201d\n\u201cWe still would like to see a little bit of an expansion of that overall customer base.\u201d\nSimilarly, Air Lease doesn\u2019t have any orders for Boeing\u2019s two other, yet-to-be-certified planes \u2014 the 737 MAX 7 and 737 MAX 10 \u2014 because it doesn\u2019t see a big enough customer base for those specific variants.\nOrtberg has said Boeing is hoping to get those certifications this year.\nPlueger, though confident in Boeing\u2019s trajectory, said that any further delays \u201conly hurt. They don\u2019t help.\u201d\nThe opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times."

      "text": "It\u2019s too soon to know what caused a Boeing 787 with at least 240 people on board to crash shortly after takeoff Thursday in the northwestern Indian city of Ahmedabad.\nRegulators from India and the United States will investigate, and it could take months to fully understand what went wrong.\nBut the incident immediately renewed concerns about Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner, the jet maker\u2019s smaller widebody plane. While the 787 has never before been involved in a fatal crash, it has been the subject of allegations about manufacturing quality.\n\u201cOur deepest condolences go out to the loved ones of the passengers and crew on board Air India Flight 171, as well as everyone affected in Ahmedabad,\u201d Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a statement Thursday.\nA Boeing team \u201cstands ready to support the investigation led by India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau,\u201d Ortberg continued, referring to the Indian organization leading the investigation.\nCampbell Wilson, Air India CEO, said the airline would continue to report timely information as soon as it could but \u201canything we report must be accurate and not speculative.\u201d\n\u201cI know that there are many questions at this stage and I will not be able to answer all of them,\u201d Wilson said in a statement posted on X. \u201cInvestigations will take time. But anything we can do now, we are doing.\u201d\nThe 787 Dreamliner, which took its first flight in 2009, initially was built in Everett. Boeing now assembles the plane in its North Charleston, S.C., factory.\nThe 787 had never been in a fatal crash before Thursday. But it has come under scrutiny for quality concerns, including a problem with lithium-ion batteries that briefly grounded the fleet shortly after it launched and, more recently, the discovery of tiny gaps at the joins in the fuselage that raised concern about weakening the structure.\nThe plane that crashed Thursday first flew in 2013 and was delivered to Air India in January 2014, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium.\nIt was manufactured in Everett, according to Cirium, before Boeing consolidated 787 production in its South Carolina facility.\nThere was a nearly three-year gap between when the plane rolled out of Boeing\u2019s Everett factory in November 2010 and the first time it flew in December 2013, according to a database that tracks 787 production.\nAir India has a mix of Boeing planes and aircraft from European manufacturer Airbus in its fleet, including 27 787-8 planes with an average age of 8.6 years, analysts from investment firm Jefferies wrote in a note Thursday.\nBoeing has delivered 1,189 787s since the plane\u2019s inception, Jefferies wrote.\nThe company is currently working to increase production of the 787, with plans to bump the monthly rate from five to seven this year. It\u2019s too soon to know if Thursday\u2019s crash will impact future production.\nIn 2020, Boeing found tiny gaps at the joins in the fuselage section in the 787, a flaw that could potentially weaken the structure of the fuselage. Boeing said at the time that the gaps did not pose an immediate safety concern, but the company largely stopped deliveries of that plane model for almost two years as it worked to correct the flaws.\nConcerns about those gaps resurfaced last year when a whistleblower accused Boeing of failing to fix the problem and taking manufacturing shortcuts to increase production rates for the 787 and the 777. Sam Salehpour, a Boeing quality engineer, testified before Congress in April 2024, alleging that the company was \u201cputting out defective airplanes.\u201d\nBoeing denied Salehpour\u2019s allegations and told reporters it had made meticulous, time-consuming changes to the 787\u2019s airframe to eliminate the gaps, with extensive testing overseen by the Federal Aviation Administration.\nOn Thursday, attorneys representing Salehpour urged the FAA to \u201cdisclose the results of its investigation\u201d into the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\nEarlier in 2024, Boeing 787 whistleblower John Barnett died by suicide in the midst of giving depositions alleging that Boeing had retaliated against him for complaints about quality lapses.\nSeparately, in May 2024, the FAA opened an investigation into Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner after the company disclosed that employees in South Carolina falsified inspection records.\nWorkers had not performed some inspections related to work done where the wings are joined to the fuselage body, despite records indicating the inspections had been complete, Boeing informed the FAA.\nThose allegations surfaced when Boeing was facing heightened regulatory scrutiny following a near-catastrophic incident on its 737 MAX 9 plane. In January 2024, a panel flew off an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX midflight near Portland, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane.\nBoeing is also still recovering from the fallout of two fatal 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019, which killed 346 people.\nBoeing recently reached an agreement with the Justice Department to avoid criminal prosecution on a fraud charge stemming from the two MAX crashes. That deal still needs court approval before it is finalized. Boeing has twice narrowly avoided the charge before previous deals fell apart.\nBoeing\u2019s stock price fell 4.8% Thursday after news of the crash.\nThe crash comes as the aerospace industry is set to gather in France for the biannual Paris Air Show, where airlines usually announce large orders and manufacturers show off product updates and tout their latest investments and achievements.\nThe tone of this year\u2019s show has undoubtedly shifted, as the Air India tragedy hangs over the industry.\nThis is a developing story.

  "argos_summary": "Boeing has cut its Q2 loss to $612\u202fmillion from $1.4\u202fbillion, and cash burn fell from $4.3\u202fbillion to $200\u202fmillion, but the company remains cash\u2011hungry. CEO Kelly Ortberg says 2025 could be a turnaround year as production of the 737\u202fMAX and 787 ramps up and the firm seeks FAA permission to lift the 38\u2011plane cap. Boeing also secured new defense contracts and is navigating regulatory delays for the 777X and MAX\u20117, while the Air India 787 crash and ongoing quality investigations weigh on the outlook.",
