  "title": "California Again Rejects Starlink Launch Increase, But It Might Not Matter",
  "description": "The California Coastal Commission unanimously votes against increasing Falcon 9 launches to 100 per year. A US military loophole will probably allow them anyway.",
  "content": "A California commission has again shot down a proposal to increase Starlink satellite launches from a local base \u2014 but it appears SpaceX and the US military don\u2019t care.\n\nOn Thursday, the California Coastal Commission unanimously rejected a US Space Force request to boost the number of Falcon 9 launches from 36 to 100 per year at Vandenberg Space Force Base. The decision arrives nearly a year after the commission denied an earlier proposal to increase the launches from 36 to 50 by partly citing SpaceX CEO Elon Musk\u2019s controversial politics and business practices. In response, Musk sued over alleged political discrimination.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s hearing, neither SpaceX nor US Space Force representatives showed up, likely because the military sidestepped the commission by classifying the Falcon 9 launches as a federal activity. The launches at Vandenberg base have involved both Starlink and Starshield, a military-grade version of the satellite internet service.\n\nThe Department of the Air Force has since cleared SpaceX to increase the number of Falcon 9 launches to 50, citing \u201cno significant impact\u201d on the local environment. In addition, the US military has kicked off its own process to increase the number of Falcon 9 launches at Vandenberg to 100 per year. Although the Air Force is soliciting public input for a final decision this fall, the process also sidelines the California Coastal Commission.\n\nThe Air Force is merely consulting the commission, along with several other federal agencies. As a result, a California commission staff member conceded during Thursday\u2019s hearing: \u201cEffectively, the result of this vote does not prevent SpaceX from continuing launch activities.\"\n\nThis time, the commission voted to reject the proposal, solely for a lack of information from the US Space Force, rather than mentioning Musk\u2019s conduct. This includes \u201csignificant unresolved questions\u201d about the noise and sonic booms from the increased launches and scarce details about the possible impact on surrounding marine and coastal wildlife.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of unanswered questions that make it really quite impossible for us to engage,\u201d said Vice Chair Commissioner Caryl Hart. \u201cAnd here today, once again, we see no appearance by the US Air Force, US Space Force, or SpaceX to answer the questions that we have \u2014 further indications that there just doesn\u2019t seem to be willingness to provide further information.\u201d\n\nThe commission\u2019s report has also questioned the US Space Force classifying Falcon 9 launches as federal activity, saying a \u201csmall fraction\u201d of the total flights have been meant to serve Department of Defense contracts.\n\nDuring the hearing, local Californians also chimed in, saying they fear the impacts on noise levels and to local wildlife. \"So, how does it feel to be ignored by your federal government and gazillionaires? Not good,\" one resident said. \"We want to protect. We're protectors. This can't be said for SpaceX. I'm sorry. They're exploiters.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Commissioner Christopher Lopez said he appreciated how Starlink can supply broadband during disasters or outages. This was evident when a tractor accidentally cut a fiber connection in his community, causing everyone to lose internet and wireless access, except for \"those people who were early adopters of Starlink services.\"\n\n\"For me, I hope as we move forward, there's a continued willingness and openness to foster and rebuild a relationship that once existed,\" he said, despite voting to reject the launch increase.\n\nSpaceX and the US Space Force didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
