  "title": "After demanding his resignation, Trump meets with Intel CEO",
  "description": "Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan was invited to the White House on Monday after Trump and his conservative allies called on him to resign.",
  "content": "The Trump administration and its conservative allies are pushing for the ouster of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan as the MAGA movement advances its authoritarian assault on free enterprise.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s gambits to strong-arm American companies to conform with his political agenda \u2014 be they law firms, universities or chip manufacturers \u2014 have exposed the fundamental disdain for democratic principles now being practiced by the party of \u201cfree enterprise.\u201d Tan is the latest target.\n\nTan visited the White House on Monday, a meeting that followed a post from Trump\u2019s Truth Social account last week accusing him of being \u201cconflicted\u201d and demanding that he resign \u201cimmediately.\u201d As Media Matters researcher Matt Gertz noted, the post from Trump\u2019s account came minutes after a Fox Business report on a letter sent by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., to Intel raising concerns about Tan\u2019s investment in businesses with ties to China\u2019s military. (Tan, who was born in Malaysia, joins TikTok CEO Shou Chu as a target of Cotton\u2019s Joseph McCarthy-esque crusade against businesspeople with ties to China.)\n\nIn the letter, Cotton referred to Reuters\u2019 reporting on Tan\u2019s private investments and his previous job at Cadence, a tech company that recently reached a settlement in which it pleaded guilty to illegally selling semiconductor design technology to a Chinese military university. (A spokesperson for Intel told Reuters that Tan had answered questionnaires that included \u201cdisclosure of any potential conflicts of interest\u201d and that the company handles such conflicts \u201cappropriately.\u201d)\n\nAfter Monday\u2019s meeting, another post from Trump\u2019s Truth Social account referred to Tan\u2019s rise as an \u201camazing story\u201d and said Tan and White House Cabinet members are going to \u201cbring suggestions to me during the next week.\u201d Intel released a statement calling the meeting \u201ccandid and constructive\u201d and said the company appreciates \u201cthe President\u2019s strong leadership.\u201d\n\nBut as the mercurial president wields his influence, it\u2019s worth noting the facts don\u2019t appear to be as scandalous as Trump or Cotton have implied. The Reuters report, for example, does not allege that Tan has done anything unlawful. In fact, as Reuters noted in its report on Cotton\u2019s letter:\n\nIn a memo to staff published to Intel\u2019s website Thursday, Tan denounced \u201cmisinformation\u201d being spread about him and said he\u2019s \u201calways operated within the highest legal and ethical standards.\u201d The lack of any demonstrable culpability for Tan arguably highlights how blatantly authoritarian Trump\u2019s push to oust him truly is.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly ironic that the president who eagerly welcomed Elon Musk into the fold despite his financial entanglements with China and their related national security concerns would turn around and insist that the business leader of an independent company must step down over his alleged ties to China.\n\nAnd it\u2019s revealing that other members of the Republican Party are contributing to this obvious attack on free enterprise.",

      "text": "Elon Musk holds an outsized influence in the new Trump administration.\nAs head of his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, the world\u2019s wealthiest man has enjoyed nearly unfettered political power in slashing and refashioning the federal government as he sees fit. And it has quickly become clear that he has the president\u2019s ear on issues beyond that brief.\nBut on one topic, Musk stands somewhat apart from others in the coterie of aides and advisers around Trump: China. In contrast to the many hawks in the new Trump cabinet who call for a hard-line approach on China, Musk is a striking outlier.\nAs an expert on China-U.S. relations who has monitored Musk\u2019s views on China, I don\u2019t find his long history of espousing pro-Chinese sentiment surprising, given that he has sought throughout to get a business hold in the country.\nBut those entanglements are worth scrutiny, given Musk\u2019s role in the Trump administration at a time when one of America\u2019s biggest foreign policy challenges is how to manage its relationship with Beijing.\nMusk\u2019s journey to the East\nFor years, Musk has had significant business interests in China, with Tesla\u2019s Shanghai factory, Tesla Giga Shanghai, playing a crucial role in the company\u2019s global operations.\nSince its opening in 2019, the Shanghai plant has surpassed Tesla\u2019s Fremont, California, facility in both size and productivity, now accounting for more than half of the company\u2019s global deliveries and a majority of its profits. Moreover, nearly 40% of Tesla\u2019s battery supply chain relies on Chinese companies, and these partnerships continue to expand.\nNotably, Tesla was the first foreign automaker permitted to establish operations in China without a local partner, following a change in ownership regulations. The Shanghai factory was constructed with the support of US$1.4 billion in loans from Chinese state-owned banks, granted at favorable interest rates.\nBetween 2019 and 2023, the Shanghai government also provided Tesla with a reduced corporate tax rate of 15% \u2013 10 percentage points lower than the standard rate.\nThe cost advantages of manufacturing in Shanghai, which include lower production and labor expenses, have further cemented Tesla\u2019s reliance on the Chinese market.\nGiven that Musk\u2019s wealth is largely tied to Tesla stock, his financial standing is increasingly dependent on the company\u2019s fortunes in China, making any potential disengagement from the country both economically and strategically challenging.\nTesla\u2019s continued investment in China underscores this dependency. On Feb. 11, 2025, the company opened its second factory in Shanghai \u2014 a $200 million plant that is set to produce 10,000 megapack batteries annually. It\u2019s the company\u2019s first megapack battery factory outside the U.S..\nThis investment deepens Tesla\u2019s presence in China amid a new wave of U.S.-China trade tensions. On Feb. 1, the Trump administration imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese imports, prompting Beijing\u2019s retaliation with tariffs on American coal, liquefied natural gas, agricultural equipment and crude oil.\nA Chinese fan\nIt remains unclear to what extent Musk\u2019s financial interests in China will translate to real influence over the Trump administration\u2019s policy toward Beijing. But Musk\u2019s long history of pro-China remarks suggests the direction he wants the administration to move.\nDuring his visit to Beijing in April 2024, Musk praised the country, noting also: \u201cI also have a lot of fans in China \u2013 well, the feeling is mutual.\u201d\nHis admiration appears to hinge in part on how he views business and labor practices in China. In that vein, Musk has criticized American workers as lazy and has faced U.S. labor law disputes, while simultaneously praising Chinese workers for \u201cburning the 3 a.m. oil\u201d under an intensely repressive labor system.\nIn numerous posts on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, which he owns, Musk has also praised China\u2019s infrastructure and high-speed rail system, lauded its space program, applauded its leadership in global green energy initiatives and urged his followers to visit the country.\nMusk has also opposed U.S. efforts to decouple from China, describing the countries\u2019 economies as \u201cconjoined twins,\u201d despite a sizable part of the foreign policy establishment in the West viewing decreased dependency on China as necessary for security interests amid rising geopolitical tensions.\nOn the issue of Taiwan, the most dangerous flashpoint in U.S.-China relations, Musk has compared Taiwan to Hawaii, arguing that it is an integral part of China and noting that the U.S. Pacific Fleet has prevented mainland China from achieving reunification by force.\nMusk further suggested that the Taiwan dispute could be resolved by allowing China to establish Taiwan as a special administrative zone, similar to Hong Kong.\nHis remarks were shared and welcomed by China\u2019s then-ambassador to the U.S., who, in a post on X, emphasized China\u2019s so-called peaceful unification strategy and advocated for the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model.\nTrump\u2019s back-channel envoy?\nThe big question going forward is how Musk\u2019s financial stakes in, and stated admiration for, China will translate into attempts to influence the U.S. administration\u2019s China policy, particularly given Musk\u2019s unconventional advisory role and the strong faction of anti-China hawks in Trumpworld.\nGiven Musk\u2019s approach to China, it\u2019s hard to see him not trying to use his influence with the president to push for somewhat warmer relations with Beijing.\nIf such counsel were heeded, it\u2019s easy to envision Musk leveraging his deep ties to China, particularly his close personal relationship with China\u2019s current second-ranking official, Premier Li Qiang, who was the Shanghai party chief when Tesla\u2019s factory was built. In the scenario, Donald Trump could tap Musk as a back channel for diplomacy to ease U.S.-China tensions and facilitate bilateral cooperation when needed.\nTo this point, it was, perhaps, telling that it was Musk who met with China President Xi Jinping\u2019s envoy to Trump\u2019s inauguration, Vice President Han Zheng, on the eve of the event.\nBut it\u2019s far from certain that Trump wants that diplomatic role for Musk, or that other voices won\u2019t win out with regard to Beijing. In his first term, Trump launched an unprecedented trade war and tech blockade against China, fundamentally reshaping U.S.-China relations and pushing the U.S. toward something of a bipartisan consensus to counter Beijing that has existed for several years.\nTrump\u2019s tariff moves and second-term picks for top trade and commerce roles, like Peter Navarro and Jamieson Greer \u2014 who played key roles in the trade war against China during the president\u2019s first term \u2014 suggest that Trump\u2019s commitment to further decoupling from China remains strong.\nFurthermore, Musk\u2019s business interests and personal wealth tied to China could leave him vulnerable to Chinese influence. By leaning on Musk\u2019s close ties with Trump, China could use his dependence on the Chinese market as a bargaining chip to pressure Trump into making concessions on issues of major strategic importance to Beijing.\nChina has a history of coercing foreign companies reliant on its market into making compromises on matters concerning its national interests. For instance, Apple removed virtual private network apps from its app store in China at the government\u2019s request. Similarly, Tesla could face comparable pressure in the future if Beijing wants to use Musk as a cudgel to influence policy in the Trump administration. Notably, as the head of DOGE, with access to sensitive data from multiple agencies, Musk could find himself caught between U.S. security scrutiny and China\u2019s strategic targeting.\nSo long as Musk retains the influence with Trump that he holds now, it\u2019s conceivable that his pro-China sentiments will translate into attempts to influence government policy. Yet even if this is to be the case, whether those efforts succeed will depend on the president and his other advisers, many of whom are seeking an aggressive front against Beijing and are likely to view Musk as an impediment rather than ally in that fight to come."

      "text": "President Donald Trump is expected to sign a directive on Thursday mandating that universities provide admissions data to prove that they are not implementing affirmative action policies, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on X.\nLeavitt did not disclose the criteria that the administration will use to determine whether schools are practicing race-conscious admissions.\nIt comes after Ivy League universities Columbia and Brown last month reached settlements that require them to release information about applicants\u2019 race in addition to test scores and academic performance after they went back and forth with the Trump administration for months over federal funding. The settlements have stoked debates about academic freedom and the role of government institutions in higher education.\nThe president's directive comes more than two years after the Supreme Court struck down the use of affirmative action programs at the University of North Carolina and Harvard, ruling that the consideration of race in the admissions process violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. Conservative activists, who argued that the policy led to discrimination against white and Asian students, considered the rulings a major victory.\nThe rulings, however, were heavily criticized by those who argued that race-conscious admissions provided an avenue for students from marginalized communities to combat historical racial discrimination in the higher education system.\n\u201cBut deeming race irrelevant in law does not make it so in life,\u201d Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote in a dissenting opinion in the UNC case (Jackson recused herself from the Harvard case; she was on Harvard\u2019s board of overseers until last year). \u201cAnd having so detached itself from this country\u2019s actual past and present experiences, the Court has now been lured into interfering with the crucial work that UNC and other institutions of higher learning are doing to solve America\u2019s real-world problems.\u201d\nThe Trump administration has aggressively cracked down on diversity, equity and inclusion-related programs, with the president signing an executive order in his first week directing all departments and agencies to terminate \u201cdiscriminatory and illegal preferences, mandates, policies, programs\u201d and more."

On Tuesday, Musk announced a lawsuit and, in a post on X, declared \"war\" against a coalition of advertisers known as the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), which uses its collective power to prioritize investing in companies that align with what they feel are issues of import. Jordan previously used his role as Judiciary chairman to accuse companies in GARM of illegally colluding against conservatives over their choice not to advertise on some controversial conservative platforms. Musk\u2019s lawsuit cites Jordan\u2019s investigations, and in posts online he claimed companies could be guilty of racketeering for choosing not to advertise on X after he took over, which was a period in which advertisers fled from X due to the platform being rife with hate speech.\nRead more at Wired.\nJD Vance's media investment\nDonald Trump\u2019s running mate Sen.

Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, last week launched a congressional probe into the popular streaming platform Spotify, in what is the latest Republican-led effort to discourage efforts to stem the spread of misinformation and disinformation online.\nIn a letter to Spotify, Jordan dredges up years-old allegations of censorship by U.S. and European agencies of conservative programming on its platform, including of MAGA-friendly podcaster Joe Rogan \u2014 who recently claimed that two (unnamed) former presidents called the company over his widely denounced Covid conspiracy theories, and of Steve Bannon, who was recently welcomed back to Spotify after a five-year ban for suggesting the beheading of U.S. officials such as infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci and former FBI Director Christopher Wray.\nRepublicans have repeatedly tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to prove that Big Tech platforms have worked hand in hand with the government to censor conservative voices.

      "text": "Elon Musk\u2019s aerospace giant SpaceX allows investors from China to buy stakes in the company as long as the funds are routed through the Cayman Islands or other offshore secrecy hubs, according to previously unreported court records.\nThe rare picture of SpaceX\u2019s approach recently emerged in an under-the-radar corporate dispute in Delaware. Both SpaceX\u2019s chief financial officer and Iqbaljit Kahlon, a major investor, were forced to testify in the case.\nIn December, Kahlon testified that SpaceX prefers to avoid investors from China because it is a defense contractor. There is a major exception though, he said: SpaceX finds it \u201cacceptable\u201d for Chinese investors to buy into the company through offshore vehicles.\n\u201cThe primary mechanism is that those investors would come through intermediate entities that they would create or others would create,\u201d Kahlon said. \u201cTypically they would set up BVI structures or Cayman structures or Hong Kong structures and various other ones,\u201d he added, using the acronym for the British Virgin Islands. Offshore vehicles are often used to keep investors anonymous.\nExperts called SpaceX\u2019s approach unusual, saying they were troubled by the possibility that a defense contractor would take active steps to conceal foreign ownership interests.\nKahlon, who has long been close to the company\u2019s leadership, has said he owns billions of dollars of SpaceX stock. His investment firm also acts as a middleman, raising money from investors to buy highly sought SpaceX shares. He has routed money from China through the Caribbean to buy stakes in SpaceX multiple times, according to the court filings.\nThe legal dispute centers on an aborted 2021 deal, when SpaceX executives grew angry after news broke that a Chinese firm was going to buy $50 million of the company\u2019s stock. SpaceX then had the purchase canceled. In separate testimony, the rocket company\u2019s CFO explained that the media coverage was \u201cnot helpful for our company as a government contractor.\u201d SpaceX\u2019s business is built on those contracts, with the U.S. government paying the company billions to handle sensitive work like building a classified spy satellite network.\nCompany executives were concerned that coverage of the deal could lead to problems with national security regulators in the U.S., according to Kahlon\u2019s testimony and a filing from his attorneys.\nSpaceX, which also launches rockets for NASA and sells satellite internet service, is perhaps the most important pillar of Musk\u2019s fortune. His estimated 42% stake in the company is valued at around $150 billion. If he owned nothing else, he\u2019d still be richer than Bill Gates.\nFederal law gives regulators broad power to oversee foreign investments in tech companies and defense contractors. Companies only have to proactively report Chinese investments in limited circumstances, and there aren\u2019t hard and fast rules for how much is too much. However, the government can initiate investigations and then block or reverse transactions they deem a national security threat. That authority typically does not apply to purely passive investments in which a foreign investor is buying only a small slice of a company. But experts said that federal officials regularly ask companies to add up Chinese investments into an aggregate total.\nThe U.S. government charges that China has a systematic strategy of using even minority investments to secure leverage over companies in sensitive industries, as well as to gain privileged access to information about cutting-edge technology. U.S. regulators view even private investors in China as potential agents of the country\u2019s government, experts said.\nThe new materials do not contain allegations that the Chinese investments in SpaceX would violate the law or were directed by the Chinese government. The company did not respond to detailed questions from ProPublica. Kahlon declined to comment on the reasons for SpaceX\u2019s approach.\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for foreigners to buy U.S. stock through a vehicle in the Cayman Islands, often to save money on taxes. But experts said it was strange for the party on the other side of a deal \u2014 the U.S. company \u2014 to prefer such an arrangement.\nProPublica spoke to 13 national security lawyers, corporate attorneys and experts in Chinese finance about the SpaceX testimony. Twelve said they had never heard of a U.S. company with such a requirement and could not think of a purpose for it besides concealing Chinese ownership in SpaceX. The 13th said they had heard of companies adopting the practice as a way to hide foreign investment.\n\u201cIt is certainly a policy of obfuscation,\u201d Andrew Verstein, a UCLA law professor who has studied defense contractors, said of the SpaceX testimony. \u201cIt hints at potentially serious problems. We count on companies to be forthright with the government about whether they\u2019ve taken money from America\u2019s rivals.\u201d\nThe new material adds to the questions surrounding Musk\u2019s extensive ties with China, which have taken a new urgency since the world\u2019s richest man joined the Trump White House. Musk has regularly met with Communist Party officials in China to discuss his business interests in the country, which is where about half of Tesla cars are built.\nLast week, The New York Times reported that Musk was scheduled to get a briefing on secret plans for potential war between China and the U.S. The Times later reported that the briefing was called off, and Trump denied it had ever been scheduled. The president told reporters it would be wrong to show the war plans to the businessman: \u201cElon has businesses in China, and he would be susceptible perhaps to that,\u201d Trump said.\nThe Delaware court records reveal SpaceX insiders\u2019 intense preoccupation with secrecy when it comes to China and detail a network of independent middlemen peddling SpaceX shares to eager Chinese investors. (Unlike a public company, SpaceX exercises significant control over who can buy into the company, with the ability to block sales even between outside parties.)\nBut the case leaves unanswered the question of exactly what percentage of SpaceX is owned by Chinese investors.\nThe Financial Times recently reported that Chinese investors had managed to acquire small amounts of SpaceX stock and that they were turning to offshore vehicles to do so. The deals were structured to limit the information investors receive, the outlet said. The Delaware records reveal additional, previously unreported Chinese investments in SpaceX but do not say how much they were worth. The few Chinese investments in SpaceX where a dollar figure is publicly known total well under $100 million.\nThe experts said the court testimony is puzzling enough that it raises the possibility that SpaceX has more substantial ties to China than are publicly known and is working to mask them from U.S. regulators. A more innocent explanation, they said, is that SpaceX is seeking to avoid scrutiny of perfectly legal investments by the media or Congress.\nOnce a welcome source of cash, Chinese investment in Silicon Valley has become the subject of intense debate in Washington as hostility between the two countries deepened in recent years. Corporate lawyers told ProPublica they\u2019d counsel their clients against requiring the use of offshore vehicles because it could make it look like they are trying to hide something from the government.\nBret Johnsen, the SpaceX CFO, testified in the Delaware dispute that the company does not have a formal policy about accepting investments from countries deemed adversaries by the U.S. government. Rather, he said, SpaceX has \u201cpreferences that kind of feel like a policy.\u201d Sensitive to how such financial ties could make it \u201cmore challenging to win government contracts,\u201d Johnsen said that he asks fund managers to \u201cstay away from Russian, Chinese, Iranian, North Korean ownership interest.\u201d\nIn the public portion of his deposition, Johnsen wasn\u2019t asked whether routing Chinese money offshore made such investments acceptable to SpaceX. But he lent credibility to Kahlon, the investor who said that was enough to get the green light. Johnsen said that he has a long-standing personal relationship with Kahlon and that he\u2019s discussed the company\u2019s approach to Chinese ownership with him. The CFO added that he trusts Kahlon to bring in only investors that the company approves of.\nOver the years, Kahlon has personally helped Chinese investors buy stakes in SpaceX on \u201ca number of occasions\u201d through \u201cproxies such as British Virgin Islands- or Cayman Islands-based entities,\u201d according to a filing from his lawyers. He also knows of \u201cmany\u201d other Chinese investors who own SpaceX shares, the filing said. He learned about them through conversations with investors and brokers, as well \u201cfrom having viewed investor lists.\u201d\nKahlon is a consummate SpaceX insider. He \u201chas been with the company in one form or fashion longer than I have,\u201d said Johnsen, who\u2019s worked at SpaceX for 14 years. Early in his career, Kahlon worked for Peter Thiel at the same venture capital firm that once employed JD Vance, and he first met with SpaceX around 2007 a few years after it was founded.\nKahlon eventually opened his own firm called Tomales Bay Capital, becoming a major player among the middlemen who cater to would-be investors in SpaceX. He\u2019s helped people like former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos buy pieces of the rocket company. He also said he has served as a \u201cback channel\u201d between SpaceX and international regulators as the company sought to bring its satellite internet products to countries like India.\nKahlon and Johnsen were forced to testify after the deal with a Chinese firm fell apart in late 2021, sparking years of litigation. That year, Kahlon had the opportunity to buy more than half a billion dollars of SpaceX stock from a West Palm Beach private equity firm. Kahlon had already brought Chinese money into SpaceX before, he testified, and he again turned to China as he gathered funds to purchase the stake.\nKahlon soon connected with a Shanghai-based company called Leo Group, short for \u201cLove Each Other.\u201d As Kahlon made his pitch during their first call, Leo was told that \u201cit would be best not to disclose the name of SpaceX,\u201d an executive at the Chinese company later testified. \u201cThey deemed that information to be quite sensitive.\u201d\nLeo quickly sent Kahlon $50 million. He then messaged another business associate in China: \u201cHave any folks interested in spcex still?\u201d\nKahlon testified that he was planning to tell Johnsen about the Leo investment and expected the CFO to sign off on it. But the deal blew up after Leo mentioned SpaceX in a regulatory filing that generated widespread coverage in the Chinese business press. (Whether Leo had Kahlon\u2019s permission to make the disclosure is a matter of dispute.) In a panic, Kahlon enlisted a Leo vice president to try to get the articles taken down. But when Johnsen and Tim Hughes, SpaceX\u2019s top in-house lobbyist, spotted the stories, they grew alarmed.\n\u201cThis is not helpful for our company as a government contractor,\u201d the SpaceX CFO later testified regarding the press attention. \u201cIt, in essence, arms our competitors with something to use as a narrative against us.\u201d\n\u201cIn my entire professional career, this was literally the worst situation that I\u2019ve been in,\u201d Kahlon said. \u201cI failed at what I thought was a core responsibility in the relationship we had.\u201d\nSpaceX ultimately decided to let Kahlon buy only a smaller portion of the stake, purchasing much of the half-billion dollar investment itself. According to contemporaneous messages and testimony from Kahlon, he was told that decision was made by Musk. However, Kahlon continued to have a strong relationship with SpaceX after the mishap, court records say, with the company allowing his firm to keep buying a large quantity of shares.\nMusk\u2019s business interests in China extend far beyond SpaceX\u2019s ownership structure \u2014 a fact that has drawn criticism from Republican lawmakers over the years. In 2022, after Tesla opened a showroom in the Chinese region where the government runs Uyghur internment camps, then-Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted, \u201cNationless corporations are helping the Chinese Communist Party cover up genocide.\u201d\nIn addition to Tesla\u2019s sprawling factory in Shanghai, last year, almost 40% of Tesla\u2019s sales were to Chinese customers. The company has also secured major tax breaks and regulatory victories in the country. In 2019, the Chinese premier offered Musk the country\u2019s equivalent of a green card.\nIn recent years, the billionaire has offered sympathetic remarks about China\u2019s desire to reclaim Taiwan and lavished praise on the government. \u201cMy experience with the government of China is that they actually are very responsive to the people,\u201d Musk said toward the end of Trump\u2019s first term. \u201cIn fact, possibly more responsive to the happiness of people than in the U.S.\u201d\nDo you have any information we should know about Elon Musk\u2019s businesses?

      "text": "This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 4 episode of \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show.\"\nAs Donald Trump continues to push around the nation\u2019s universities \u2014 suspending their federal funding and then shaking them down to comply with his demands \u2014 some colleges have decided to do deals with the White House. In recent weeks, Brown University coughed up $50 million and Columbia University paid more than $200 million.\nLast week, there was reporting that an even bigger deal was in the works. The New York Times reported that Harvard University was preparing to fork over $500 million to appease Trump. However, according to the school\u2019s student newspaper, The Harvard Crimson, the university\u2019s president told the faculty he is absolutely not considering such a deal.\nThe rule of law is under direct assault right now, and its greatest threat comes when those within the legal system fail to do their duties and stand up against the attack.\nMichael Teter\nThe paper reports: \u201cThe University is seriously considering resolving its dispute with the White House through the courts rather than a negotiated settlement.\u201d\nThen there are the law firms that Trump has been pushing around. Nine big law firms struck deals with the president after he began issuing executive orders targeting certain firms. Four firms refused to make deals with Trump; they fought back and all four firms won in court.\nDespite their success, new reporting from Reuters found that Trump\u2019s assault on law firms has nevertheless had what is presumably the desired effect: Some big law firms are scaling back their pro bono work for the kinds of people or organizations the Trump administration is trying to victimize or persecute.\nAt the same time, smaller law firms and new purpose-driven legal organizations are being formed to make up the moral difference, to do the work that these big law firms are too cowardly to do and to stand up for people being fired by Trump when they\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\nOn Monday, The New York Times reported on a new firm of just four lawyers \u2014 including two who were fired from the Justice Department this year by Trump \u2014 that is focused on challenging the administration in court, specifically with the aim of getting precedent-setting cases before the Supreme Court that could curtail the president\u2019s power.\nThere are also those fighting against the administration who are using the standards of the legal profession, its internal ethics and rules, as a way to stand up and push back. The Freedom of the Press Foundation has taken on Trump\u2019s Federal Communications Commission chairman by filing a disciplinary complaint against him with the D.C. Bar Association. The complaint accused the FCC chair of, among other things, intimidating media outlets in violation of professional conduct rules he is bound to follow as a lawyer.\nMeanwhile, the D.C. Bar\u2019s disciplinary board has just recommended that former Trump lawyer Jeffrey Clark be disbarred for his role in trying to help Trump overturn the 2020 election. The board said Clark should be disbarred \u201cto send a message to the rest of the Bar and to the public that this behavior will not be tolerated.\u201d\nOn top of these efforts, a legal watchdog group has filed professional ethics complaints against three lawyers who currently work for Trump\u2019s Justice Department. The Legal Accountability Center has accused the attorneys of making false statements to a federal judge while defending the Trump administration in court.\n\u201cThe rule of law is under direct assault right now, and its greatest threat comes when those within the legal system fail to do their duties and stand up against the attack,\u201d Michael Teter, the group\u2019s executive director, told The New York Times. \u201cThe message that needs to be heard by all attorneys representing the government is that even though the Trump administration isn\u2019t interested in following the rules, we are watching.\u201d"

      "text": "Today is what President Donald Trump calls \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d the day he frees the U.S. economy from the global economy. President Trump claims that his policy of chaotically implemented tariffs will \u201cbring back jobs\u201d and that U.S. manufacturing will boom \u201clike we have never boomed before.\u201d\nWe\u2019ve been down this road before, and it didn\u2019t end well.\nIn his first term, President Trump claimed that he\u2019d revitalize U.S. manufacturing, but he failed to do so; there\u2019s no reason to believe that doubling down on the same, failed policies will do so now. There is a better way \u2014 and that comes with real federal investments into the American economy.\nWe\u2019ve been down this road before, and it didn\u2019t end well.\nPresident Trump is right to say that domestic manufacturing matters. Some goods are integral to national and economic security, so we all have an interest in ensuring reliable production within our borders or friendshored.\nTake the example of semiconductors, many thinner than a wisp of hair, now in everything from cars to refrigerators to cellphones. While innovators in Silicon Valley invented this technology, by the time Trump left office in 2021, most chips were made overseas. When Covid hit, the combination of lockdowns that shuttered factories around the world and higher demand for consumer goods as people were stuck at home led to a global chip shortage affecting 169 separate industries, which, in turn, contributed to rising prices.\nThis is a clear example of why we must think deeply about what is produced within the boundaries of the nation. So how do we do that?\nTariffs are one tool, but on their own they don\u2019t deliver. After Trump put tariffs in place during his first term and gave tax cuts for the very wealthy, investment in the construction of new manufacturing facilities fell. That\u2019s right, fell.\nNow what\u2019s scary is that we\u2019re already seeing signs of manufacturers struggling. In New York state, manufacturers are seeing new orders and shipments fall and overall business conditions deteriorate, leading them to lose hope that this economy will allow them to grow.\nWhen I was working in the Biden administration, we saw a more-than-doubling of investment in the construction of new manufacturing facilities. How did we do that? We invested in America.\nWhile tariffs make foreign goods more expensive, our approach instead sought to improve domestic production. By investing public dollars in infrastructure and other essential services, we brought capital into critical sectors. And we made sure that those investments could thrive and that they would deliver good, middle-class jobs.\nThis economic development strategy acknowledges the real-world challenge with building up a manufacturing industry in the United States. Firms need infrastructure, such as roads and access to affordable electricity, an ecosystem of other manufacturers, including suppliers, as well as competitors to keep them on their toes and build a community of best practices, and a pipeline of skilled workers who, in turn, need homes and schools and child care for their families.\nAll of this is a distraction from the fleecing of America by giving $4.6 trillion in tax cuts to the wealthiest.\nThis is why Congress passed, and President Biden signed into law, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act. Combined, these laws catalyzed a trillion dollars in new private investment in clean energy, semiconductors and other advanced manufacturing. By crowding in investment into sectors that matter through both supply and demand side policies and addressing market failures, we saw a revitalization of U.S. manufacturing in sectors in which there\u2019s both need and a potential to thrive.\nBut President Trump doesn\u2019t get it. He thinks that capricious on-again/off-again tariffs will lead to investment and growth. But no one can plan sound investments amid this chaos. Further, he has no plan to improve domestic industry. The lack of even the concept of a plan is showing up in the data: already, there are indications that manufacturers have scaled back their intentions by $57 billion.\nAnd let\u2019s be clear, all of this is a distraction from the fleecing of America by giving $4.6 trillion in tax cuts to the wealthiest and letting Elon Musk take a chainsaw to the U.S. government. These policies will not spur growth that benefits America\u2019s working people. Just look at what happened last time: in his first term, Trump promised that his tax cuts would lead to growth of 4%-6% and wage gains of $4,000 per worker. Neither happened.\nWhen I visited Syracuse last year, I got to see the Biden administration\u2019s ideas in action. At Beldon Industries, they were installing a new production line to produce a fiber optic cable that is easier to install and more cost-effective, particularly in rural areas. Across town, the Idaho-based semiconductor firm Micron was promising to invest $100 billion over the next two decades, having won a $6.1 billion grant from the CHIPs for America program.\nThat\u2019s what it means to revitalize American manufacturing. It\u2019s not about one man\u2019s whims, but about helping communities come together and build great things."

      "text": "American politics only has a handful of trends that have endured for generations, but near the top of the list is the seemingly unshakable partnership between corporate America and the Republican Party. One of the defining characteristics of the GOP for over a century is its commitment to the nation\u2019s largest and most powerful businesses.\nWhat corporate leaders want, Republicans have told us, is what corporate leaders should get. What\u2019s good for business is what\u2019s good for America. The government must never be in a position to pick winners and losers: Those decisions should be left to the private sector, guided by good ol\u2019 fashioned free market principles. For politicians to intervene in corporations\u2019 decisions is to open the door to socialism.\nBut as regular readers know, over the last year or so, the relationship between the GOP and its corporate partners has been tested in unfamiliar ways.\nThe first sign of strain came about a year ago, when Republicans started imposing new voting restrictions, prompting criticisms from many prominent American businesses. Many in the party responded by threatening major corporations with retaliatory policy measures if they said anything negative in public about the GOP\u2019s voter-suppression campaign.\nIndeed, it was a year ago this week when Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told corporations to \u201cstay out of politics,\u201d adding that business \u201cwill invite serious consequences\u201d if they take public stands on issues in ways Republicans don\u2019t like.\nIn the months that followed, related examples came to the fore. Corporate leaders and GOP officials clashed over efforts to end the pandemic. And raising the debt ceiling. And cooperating with the bipartisan investigation into the Jan. 6 attack, which led to an unusually aggressive threat from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who vowed to retaliate against businesses that provided information the GOP preferred to keep secret.\nNow, in the wake of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signing what some have dubbed the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill into law, the Republican Party\u2019s culture war agenda not only has a new front, it\u2019s also leading to different kinds of threats. As MSNBC colleague Ja\u2019han Jones explained yesterday:\nNow, like a disgruntled despot demanding fealty, Florida Republicans and their allies are looking for ways to punish Disney for its stance \u2014 belated as it was \u2014 in support of LGBTQ people. Last week, Florida state Rep. Spencer Roach said he and other lawmakers have considered revoking a state law enacted in 1967 that effectively gives Disney unique autonomy over its massive Florida properties, including Disney World. DeSantis has also called on lawmakers to re-evaluate Disney\u2019s special status after saying the company\u2019s criticism \u201ccrossed the line.\u201d\nAt face value, the fact that state policymakers are eager to revisit generous benefits to a massive, multi-national corporation may be a popular move, even on the left. (As a native Floridian, I\u2019ve long marveled at just how expansive Disney\u2019s benefits are in the Sunshine State.)\nBut no one should miss the forest for the trees: As Ja\u2019han explained very well, the effort launched by DeSantis and his allies is part of an authoritarian-style push in which partisans are exploring using the power of the state to punish a business for criticizing one of their regressive policies.\nWhat we\u2019re witnessing isn\u2019t a change in Republican Party orthodoxy related to the free market, but rather, a corruption of that orthodoxy. Prominent GOP officials want corporate partners, so long as they\u2019re silent partners.\nThose who fall out of line, and dare to express societal opinions that Republicans find inconvenient, should expect adverse governmental consequences.\nIndeed, there is no subtlety to any of this. A prime-time Fox News host told viewers last week that the next time the GOP is in the majority, companies such as Disney should expect the government to retaliate in a variety of ways, including anti-trust measures and copyright/trademark protections.\nThe power of the state will serve as an extension of the Republican Party\u2019s cultural grievances, and businesses whose opinions are deemed unacceptable will be punished accordingly. Corporate giants that appear \"woke\" should expect to be bullied into submission by those controlling the levers of governmental power.\nWe saw some of this kind of corruption during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, when the White House was credibly accused of making administrative decisions based on whether he saw corporations as political foes. The message at the time was that businesses expecting fair treatment from the administration had to \u201cplay ball\u201d with the president\u2019s wishes.\nIn 2022, that message is being amplified by some the GOP\u2019s most powerful voices.\nIndeed, new rules appear to be taking shape. As the Republican Party now sees it, corporations are allowed to give money to the GOP, stand in the way of unionization efforts, pollute, and partner with Republicans in opposition to economic measures such as minimum wage increases and paid family-leave proposals.\nBut by the same rules, as the Republican Party now sees it, corporations are not allowed to support voting rights, endorse LGBTQ+ rights, take steps to end the pandemic, call for debt-ceiling increases, or cooperate with congressional investigations the party don\u2019t like.\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Greg Sargent added yesterday, \u201cSome on the right, particularly the new nationalists seeking to build a post-Trump Trumpism, actually do believe the state should be weaponized to fight the culture wars as aggressively as possible.\u201d They appear to have more than a few allies in the contemporary GOP.\nRelated:"

Cotton\u2019s \u2018ignorant\u2019 grilling of TikTok CEO Politics Feb 2, 2024 1:59 PM EDT SINGAPORE (AP) \u2014 After a U.S. senator grilled the Singaporean CEO of TikTok about his nationality and suggested he was affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party, Singaporeans are complaining about ignorant \u2014 or even racist \u2014 views of their country. TikTok CEO Shou Chew and executives of other technology firms such as Meta, X and Snap testified Wednesday before U.S. lawmakers on online harm to children from social media. During the hearing, Chew was repeatedly questioned about his nationality and possible affiliations to the Chinese Communist Party by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. TikTok, which is operated by the Chinese firm ByteDance, has over 150 million users in America. U.S. lawmakers have regarded TikTok with considerable suspicion over whether its data can be accessed by the Chinese government and whether the app can be used to expand China\u2019s influence. Chinese companies are required to set up Communist Party cells. \u201cYou said today, as you often say, that you live in Singapore. Of what nation are you a citizen?\u201d Cotton asked. WATCH: Why Universal Music Group is pulling songs from TikTok Chew affirmed that he is Singaporean \u2014 which does not allow its citizens to hold dual citizenship \u2014 but Cotton pressed on, asking if Chew was a citizen of any other nation, and if he had ever applied for Chinese citizenship. China also does not permit dual nationality, and rarely accepts applications for citizenship. When Chew responded no to both questions, Cotton asked if he had ever been a member of the Chinese Communist Party or have had any affiliation to it. \u201cNo Senator, again, I\u2019m Singaporean,\u201d Chew responded, visibly perplexed. The party requires members to be Chinese citizens. Cotton\u2019s line of questioning was described as \u201cMcCarthy-esque\u201d by The Washington Post. Clips of the exchange posted on social media platforms drew tens of thousands of views. An Instagram reel of the exchange uploaded by Singapore flagship newspaper The Straits Times drew nearly 2,000 comments, most criticizing or mocking Cotton for his line of questioning. \u201cSenator, do you know where Singapore is?\u201d one person asked. Another remarked that \u201cjust because he looks Chinese, doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s Chinese.\u201d About 75 percent of Singapore\u2019s approximately 5.9 million population is ethnically Chinese, a result of Chinese immigrants moving to Singapore in the 1800s and early 1900s. Many young Singaporeans today do not identify with China as a cultural motherland. READ MORE: Singapore executes man convicted of coordinating delivery of 2 pounds of cannabis Wednesday\u2019s hearing was Chew\u2019s second time appearing before U.S. lawmakers.

Donate now By \u2014 Zen Soo, Associated Press Zen Soo, Associated Press\nSINGAPORE (AP) \u2014 After a U.S. senator grilled the Singaporean CEO of TikTok about his nationality and suggested he was affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party, Singaporeans are complaining about ignorant \u2014 or even racist \u2014 views of their country. TikTok CEO Shou Chew and executives of other technology firms such as Meta, X and Snap testified Wednesday before U.S. lawmakers on online harm to children from social media. During the hearing, Chew was repeatedly questioned about his nationality and possible affiliations to the Chinese Communist Party by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. TikTok, which is operated by the Chinese firm ByteDance, has over 150 million users in America. U.S. lawmakers have regarded TikTok with considerable suspicion over whether its data can be accessed by the Chinese government and whether the app can be used to expand China\u2019s influence. Chinese companies are required to set up Communist Party cells. \u201cYou said today, as you often say, that you live in Singapore. Of what nation are you a citizen?\u201d Cotton asked. WATCH: Why Universal Music Group is pulling songs from TikTok Chew affirmed that he is Singaporean \u2014 which does not allow its citizens to hold dual citizenship \u2014 but Cotton pressed on, asking if Chew was a citizen of any other nation, and if he had ever applied for Chinese citizenship. China also does not permit dual nationality, and rarely accepts applications for citizenship. When Chew responded no to both questions, Cotton asked if he had ever been a member of the Chinese Communist Party or have had any affiliation to it. \u201cNo Senator, again, I\u2019m Singaporean,\u201d Chew responded, visibly perplexed. The party requires members to be Chinese citizens. Cotton\u2019s line of questioning was described as \u201cMcCarthy-esque\u201d by The Washington Post. Clips of the exchange posted on social media platforms drew tens of thousands of views. An Instagram reel of the exchange uploaded by Singapore flagship newspaper The Straits Times drew nearly 2,000 comments, most criticizing or mocking Cotton for his line of questioning. \u201cSenator, do you know where Singapore is?\u201d one person asked. Another remarked that \u201cjust because he looks Chinese, doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s Chinese.\u201d About 75 percent of Singapore\u2019s approximately 5.9 million population is ethnically Chinese, a result of Chinese immigrants moving to Singapore in the 1800s and early 1900s. Many young Singaporeans today do not identify with China as a cultural motherland.

Tan's recent meeting with Trump followed a letter from Senator Tom Cotton raising concerns about his ties to Chinese military interests, although Intel maintains that Tan has complied with conflict of interest disclosures. Meanwhile, Elon Musk's influence in the Trump administration raises questions about his pro-China sentiments, especially as he navigates significant business interests in China, including Tesla's operations and investments.",
