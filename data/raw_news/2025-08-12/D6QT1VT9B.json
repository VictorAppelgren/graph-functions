  "title": "White House says it's working out legality of Nvidia and AMD China chip deals",
  "description": "\"The legality of it, the mechanics of it, is still being ironed out by the Department of Commerce,\" White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.",
  "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump (L) invites Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to speak in the Cross Hall of the White House during an event on \"Investing in America\" on April 30, 2025 in Washington, DC.\n\nThe Trump administration is still working out the details of its 15% export tax on Nvidia and AMD and could bring deals of this kind to more companies, the White House's Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.\n\n\"Right now it stands with these two companies. Perhaps it could expand in the future to other companies,\" said Leavitt, the White House's spokesperson.\n\n\"The legality of it, the mechanics of it, is still being ironed out by the Department of Commerce, and I would defer you to them for any further details on how it will actually be implemented,\" she continued.\n\nPresident Donald Trump confirmed on Monday that he had negotiated a deal with Nvidia in which the U.S. government approves export licenses for the China-specific H20 AI chip in exchange for a 15% cut of revenue. Advanced Micro Devices also got licenses approved in exchange for a proportion of its China sales, the White House confirmed.\n\n\"I said, 'If I'm going to do that, I want you to pay us as a country something, because I'm giving you a release,'\" Trump said Monday.\n\n\"We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets,\" Nvidia said in a statement this week.\n\nTrump said the export licenses for AMD and Nvidia were a done deal. But lawyers and experts who follow trade have warned that Trump's deal may be complicated because of existing laws that regulate how the government can charge fees for export licenses.\n\nThe H20 is Nvidia's Chinese-specific chip that is slowed down on purpose to comply with U.S. export relations. It's related to the H100 and H200 chips that are used in the U.S., and was introduced after the Biden administration implemented export controls on artificial intelligence chips in 2023.\n\nEarlier this year, Nvidia said that it was on track to sell more than $8 billion worth of H20 chips in a single quarter before the Trump administration in April said that it would require a license to export the chip.\n\nTrump signaled in July that he was likely to approve export licenses for the chip after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang visited the White House.\n\nThe U.S. regulates AI chips like those made by Nvidia for national security reasons, saying that they could be used by the Chinese government to leapfrog U.S. capabilities in AI, or they could be used by the Chinese military or linked groups.\n\nThe Chinese government has been encouraging local companies in recent weeks to avoid using Nvidia's H20 chips for any government or national security-related work, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.",

      "text": "President Donald Trump on Monday said that he initially asked Nvidia for a 20% cut of the chipmaker's sales to China, but the number came down to 15% after CEO Jensen Huang negotiated with him.\nThe comments came after news broke over the weekend that Nvidia agreed to pay the federal government a 15% cut in return for receiving export control licenses that will allow it to once again sell the H20 chip to China and Chinese companies. Nvidia's Huang visited Trump in the White House on Friday.\n\"I said, 'listen, I want 20% if I'm going to approve this for you, for the country,'\" Trump said at a news conference in Washington.\nTrump said that Nvidia's H20 is an \"old chip that China already has\" and is \"obsolete.\" He compared the H20 chip to Nvidia's current fastest artificial intelligence chip, which is called Blackwell, and said that he wouldn't allow those to be sold to China without significant downgrades, such as a 30% to 50% reduction in performance.\n\"The Blackwell is super-duper advanced. I wouldn't make a deal with that,\" Trump said, adding that it was possible to make a deal for a \"somewhat enhanced in a negative way\" version of Blackwell.\n\"That's the latest and the greatest in the world. Nobody has it. They won't have it for five years,\" Trump said.\nOne reason for the U.S. export controls is fear that providing advanced chips to China could allow the foreign power to leapfrog the U.S. in AI capabilities. Many have said that could pose a threat to the national security of the U.S.\nTrump said that China already has chips with some similar capabilities to the H20.\nHuang has said that it is better for U.S. national security if Chinese AI developers use U.S. technology, and that denying them access to Nvidia chips would actually encourage the Chinese chip industry to develop and catch up.\n\"He's selling a essentially old chip,\" Trump said. \"Huawei has a similar chip.\"\nThe H20 is a Chinese-specific chip that has had its performance slowed down. It is related to Nvidia's H100 and H200 chips that are used in the U.S. The H20 was introduced after the Biden administration implemented export controls on AI chips in 2023.\nIn April, the Trump administration said it would require a license to export the H20 chip, and in May, Huang said that \"effectively closed\" the market off to Nvidia. Huang said that Nvidia was expecting to sell about $8 billion in H20 chips in the July quarter before sales were stopped.\n\"While we haven't shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide,\" an Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC on Monday.\nTrump on Monday also said that Huang plans to visit him again to negotiate export licenses for the Blackwell chips.\n\"I think he's coming to see me again about that,\" Trump said.\nA White House official confirmed to CNBC that Advanced Micro Devices, the second-place AI chipmaker, will also pay 15% to receive an export license for its China-focused AI chip, the Instinct MI308."

      "text": "Nvidia said Tuesday that it hopes to resume sales of its H20 general processing units to China, in a major win for the company that has suffered from U.S. export curbs.\nThe U.S. government in April told Nvidia it would require a license to sell the chips to China, the company said in a filing, effectively halting their sales. The H20 chips had been designed specifically to bypass earlier export controls on Beijing.\n\"The U.S. government has assured NVIDIA that licenses will be granted, and NVIDIA hopes to start deliveries soon,\" the company said in a statement Tuesday.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang in recent months has ramped up his lobbying against export controls, arguing that they inhibited American tech leadership. In May, Huang said chip restrictions had already cut Nvidia's China market share nearly in half.\nThe potential change in U.S. stance follows a meeting between Huang and U.S. President Donald Trump last week. During the talks, Huang had reaffirmed Nvidia's support for the administration's job creation and onshoring efforts, as well as the aim for America to lead in global AI, the company said.\nWashington and Beijing last month agreed to a preliminary trade framework that allowed relaxing rare-earth export controls by China and easing of tech export curbs by the U.S.\nHuang also announced a new \"fully compliant\" GPU \u2014 RTX PRO \u2014 saying it was ideal for smart factories and logistics. It was not clear if the reference was to the GPU being compliant with guidelines for exports to China.\nSince May, reports had indicated that Nvidia was working on a new AI chip for the China market, which would be less advanced than the H20.\nHowever, the potential resumption of H20 chips to China comes as a surprise, Ray Wang, research director of semiconductors, supply chain and emerging technology at Futurum Group, told CNBC.\n\"The lifting of the H20 ban marks a significant and positive development for Nvidia, which will enable the company to reinforce its leadership in China,\" Wang said.\n\"The resumption of H20 shipments \u2014 alongside the upcoming rollout of new export control-compliant AI chips for the Chinese market \u2014 should serve as a fresh growth catalyst in the coming quarters,\" he added.\nNvidia shares were up 4.5% on trading platform Robinhood as of 12:20 a.m. ET.\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia also confirmed that Huang was in China and had met government and industry officials to discuss the benefits of AI and ways for researchers to advance safe and secure AI.\nWhen the export controls on the H20 chip set in in April, some chip experts had expected it to be a boon for local Nvidia alternatives such as Huawei.\nHowever, while China's AI chip environment has been making progress, it remains behind the capabilities of Nvidia and chip foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\nSpeaking to CNBC's \"The China Connection\" on Tuesday, Louise Loo, lead economist for China at Oxford Economics, said a reversal of the H20 export controls would buy Chinese manufacturers more time as they await advancements in China's indigenous technology.\n\"We know from from our conversations with clients and market participants, that manufacturers in China are preferring these Nvidia chips,\" she added."
