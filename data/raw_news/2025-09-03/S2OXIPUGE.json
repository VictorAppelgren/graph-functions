  "title": "Fed Could Cut Rates to at Least 3%, Cabana Says",
  "description": "Mark Cabana, Bank of America global research, head of US rates strategy, says the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates to at least 3%. He says the market is underestimating the potential range of outcomes below 3% that the Fed could take us to. He speaks on \"Bloomberg Surveillance.\"\n (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "We think that investors should really be focused on where the cutting trough in this cycle is. That's still around 3%. The Fed thinks 3% is neutral. The market seems to believe that that's credible and that the Fed will head there. Increasingly, at least for our rate strategy team, we see 3% as almost a cutting ceiling. They're going to at least cut to there, we think. And we think that the market is not fully appreciating the potential range of outcomes below 3% that the Fed could take us to. And that range of outcomes we think exists because you do have a moderating labor market, you do have inflation that is expected to peak around the end of this year or first half of next year. But we also think that you're going to have a composition of individuals at the Fed that are going to be targeting potentially different objectives than the current Fed is. And specifically, what I mean by that is think about, let's say, how the Fed judges the natural rate of unemployment. The Fed thinks that in the longer run, this level is 4.2%. They don't know that for sure, but that's their estimate. What's to stop a new composition of Fed officials from targeting a potential three and a half percent or sub 4% type of natural rate of unemployment? And we think that you're going to increasingly hear these types of arguments from individuals that are being considered to adopt leadership positions at the Fed. I'll certainly be listening for that on Thursday with Myron's testimony, because we have heard from other, let's say, Fed chair contenders that they're open to this idea. And if the Fed does indeed adopt that type of approach, that opens up the range of outcomes for where the funds rate can go well below 3%, we think you want to be received five year OS to benefit from that. It also means that you should be expecting that longer run inflation expectations move up because they are still very well anchored. We agree with the Fed's assessment on that. We think that they can be moving up. We think that the inflation curve can be steepening and we think that the nominal curve should also be steepening in that type of environment. Finally, we like being short 30 year asset swap spreads because we do worry about some of this supply and demand dynamic at the back end of the rates curve. If the Fed is, let's say cutting to rates lower than what many of us would think are justified by fundamentals today, who's going to buy the bond? If you're worried about upside inflation risks and the deficit is still not improving materially, who's going to take down all that long duration Treasury supply? So we think you want to be positioned for that. We like being short 30 year asset swap spreads to do so. So as you talk, I'm thinking I'm going to hide in gold, I'm going to hide in the most pro-growth stocks because essentially they're going to juice everything. I mean, essentially, isn't what you're saying really positive for stocks, really positive for gold, terrible for the dollar and don't even touch that 30 year bond. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Okay. So that's basically what you're looking for right now. And we just think that, again, you can focus on fundamentals and fundamentals. And our economists and kudos to them are still very much rooted in that. Their thinking. This is an economy that's not headed into a recession where you've got stagflation area risks, where inflation is going to be 3% or higher by the end of the year. And where the Fed is running the risk of a policy mistake by cutting later this year, if that's indeed what they do. And so they're thinking why would the Fed be doing this? And I understand that from a fundamental perspective, but we've all seen the headlines. We've all seen at least we've heard some of the approaches that individuals who are being nominated are considered for Fed leadership positions are espousing. And all of those, at least to me, as a rate strategists say, why are they going to stop at three? Why would they do that? Waller is just saying, no, we're going to cut to neutral or I think we should be heading to neutral. I think neutral is 3%. But he'll be the first to tell you that he doesn't know where neutral is. And then once you start to contemplate some of these other arguments, we suspect about lower natural rate of unemployment and really strong GDP and have deficit financing levels, which is not in the Fed's mandate. But certainly you hear that line of argument from administration officials. Once that creeps into the dialogue, then why would they be stopping at three? So we just think again that the distribution of rate outcomes is much greater to the downside than what the market is currently pricing, not necessarily due to fundamentals, but due to a shift in the approach for how the Fed will likely be thinking about setting monetary policy. You know, I give you a lot of credit for trying to force people to think outside a conventional framework, because I think that what we could see next year could be very unconventional.",
