  "title": "Migrant hotels told some residents may be criminals",
  "description": "Home Office documents reportedly advise establishments that some of those coming to stay could be 'ex-foreign national offenders'.",
  "content": "Asylum hotels have been told by the Home Office they could have to house foreign criminals as public anger against the scheme grows across the nation. Protests against migrant hotels swept the country this weekend with large demonstrations in London, Norwich, the West Midlands, Liverpool and elsewhere. Police were out in force in several areas as protesters against the use of hotels were met with counter-protests organised by Stand Up to Racism. Official figures released earlier this month showed that 111,084 people applied for asylum in the UK in the year to June 2025, the highest number for any 12-month period since current records began in 2001. Latest statistics show there were 32,059 asylum seekers in UK hotels by the end of June. Now the Telegraph reports Home Office documents show firms running the hotels have been asked to \u201cacknowledge and agree\u201d that some residents may be \u201cex-foreign national offender[s] released on criminal bail\u201d.\n\nThe advice continued informing hotels some staff who will have contact with the migrants must undergo annual \"unconscious bias\" and \"ethnic diversity and cultural awareness\" training. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, told the Telegraph: \u201cAt last we\u2019re beginning to learn the truth that has been withheld from us for so long. No wonder local residents are deeply fearful of the young men in these hotels. In my opinion, none of them should be free to walk the streets. \u201cThe Government tries to hide the truth from us all the time, but piece by piece \u2013 as with this story \u2013 we are beginning to learn the full story, we are beginning to learn the full scale of the horror.\u201d Sir Keir Starmer is facing mounting pressure over the small boats crisis after protests continued outside asylum hotels and a poll suggested voters thought he was failing to grip the problem. The Prime Minister and his Government have set out measures to speed up the asylum appeals system to aid the removal of people with no right to be in the UK. But Labour former home secretary Lord Blunkett said the Government had so far failed to offer a \"comprehensive answer or an understandable narrative\" on tackling the crisis. So far this year, a record 28,076 people have crossed the English Channel in small boats, 46% more than in the same period in 2024.",
