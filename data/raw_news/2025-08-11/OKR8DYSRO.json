  "content": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nOnline scammers continue to dupe the majority of American adults as they infiltrate virtual calendars and security systems meant to defend users against the poaching of personal information.\n\nA recent survey of more than 9,000 U.S. adults by the Pew Research Center found that approximately 73% experienced at least one or more online scams or attacks.\n\nThe most common virtual cons were credit card fraud, online shopping scams and ransomware attacks\u2014a type of malicious software that prevents you from accessing your computer files or system until a ransom is paid.\n\nAbout 24% of those surveyed said they had received a scam email, text message or call that tricked them into giving away personal information.\n\nAn estimated 32% of respondents said they were victims of a scam within the last year.\n\nIt's often said that older adults are more vulnerable to online fraudsters. However, in 2021, the Federal Trade Commission reported that Gen Z adults, millennials and Gen Xers, collectively between the ages of 18 and 59, were 34% more likely than adults who are 60 and older to report losing money to fraud.\n\nThese generational groups are getting tricked by online schemes that originate from a social media ad, an investment scam or fake job opportunities.\n\nThe latest phishing attacks, or attempts to acquire sensitive data, are happening through your online calendar (Google or Outlook calendar), multi-factor authentication app and HTML attachments.\n\nEvading online scams is proving to be a challenge, but cybersecurity experts say there are steps you can take to protect yourself.\n\nScammers are constantly finding new ways to lure you into unknowingly giving up your personal information and the calendar connected to your email account is one of them, said Iskander Sanchez-Rola, director of artificial intelligence and innovation for Norton.\n\nUnlike traditional phishing scams such as an unwanted text or call that requires your engagement, this invitation automatically appears on your calendar without you approving or denying it.\n\nAnyone can easily be fooled by this because it can confuse you into thinking you accepted the invitation at some point, Sanchez-Rola said.\n\nThe scam happens when you click on the invite to get more information.\n\nA link in the invitation can lead you to a phishing webpage that is masquerading as a Zoom link, or it can prompt you to download malware that is disguised as a software update.\n\nThis con often targets work-related email accounts and corresponding calendar apps.\n\nThe warning signs of this scam include:\n\u2022 There are misspellings in the link or sender address associated with the calendar appointment.\n\u2022 The invite is associated with work, but you're the only person to receive it.\n\nWhat you can do: Change the settings in your online calendar to prohibit automatic updates. Microsoft Outlook users can follow these online instructions to change their calendar settings; Google users can limit which invitations appear on their schedule by following these online instructions.\n\nIf you have any suspicions, don't reply directly to the invite, said Derek Manky, chief security strategist and global vice president of threat intelligence at Fortinet.\n\n\"Instead, send an email to your trusted contact from that organization asking if they have confirmed the meeting and request further details,\" Manky said.\n\nA multi-factor authentication app, also known as a \"two-step verification,\" is an application on your phone that provides you with a code or a \"yes or no\" prompt to verify that you're accessing an account that's linked to the authenticator.\n\n\"Multi-factor authentication attacks have been happening for well over a decade,\" Manky said. \"They just frequently take on new forms, or target new platforms such as the authenticator app.\"\n\nA scam occurs when you're receiving multiple notifications from the authentication app even though you didn't request verification.\n\n\"This scam is all about wearing you down to the point of clicking an unknown notification and accidentally providing your personal information,\" Sanchez-Rola said.\n\nThe warning signs of this scam include:\n\u2022 The authentication app is requesting verification or providing you with a verification code you did not request.\n\u2022 The authentication app is sending you several notifications in a row even though you did not prompt the app.\n\nWhat you can do: If you're getting a string of authentication app notifications, pause before you click.\n\n\"Approving a login you didn't request is like handing your keys to a stranger,\" Sanchez-Rola said. \"You just don't do it.\"\n\nA safer way to use an authentication app\u2014such as 2FAS, Aegis Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Stratum or Google Authenticator\u2014is to use one that provides you with a verification code. Don't use an app that sends a notification because that's how a scammer can pressure you into providing your login information.\n\nAnother step in protecting yourself is changing your passwords frequently, as it reduces the shelf-life of the ones that are stolen and sold, Manky said.\n\nAn email with an unknown HTML attachment can redirect you to a phishing webpage or prompt you to download malware.\n\nIt's the oldest technique in the book, but it's still commonly used today, Manky said.\n\n\"HTM/HTML files contain code that can be used in a variety of ways, including executing malicious scripts, for example Javascript, that could drop an information-stealer on the system,\" he said. \"Likewise, they could be used to launch a phishing page to harvest credentials.\"\n\nFraudsters will try to use trusted names or services that are of daily use to you.\n\n\"If an email is unsolicited, the end user should always question the identity of the emails being sent,\" Manky said.\n\nThe warning signs of this scam include:\n\u2022 The sender of the email is an unknown contact.\n\u2022 The attachment within the email is unsolicited and looks suspicious.\n\nWhat can you do: Always exercise caution before opening any attachments in an email, Manky said.\n\nLook for typosquatting in the URL of the attachment. Typosquatting is when domain names on the URL have a small variation from the legitimate one, Manky said.",
