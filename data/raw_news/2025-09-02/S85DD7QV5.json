  "title": "Best European airport named - as hotspot takes the crown for 7th year",
  "description": "If you're flying through Europe anytime soon, chance are you'll arrive at one of the 10 award-winning airports leading the way.",
  "content": "If you're flying through Europe anytime soon, chances are you'll arrive at one of the 10 award-winning airports leading the way with their technology, sustainability and service.\n\nAnd if you happen to be travelling to Rome, you'll be flying into Europe's best airport - a title awarded for the seventh year in a row.\n\nThe latest ACI EUROPE Best Airport Awards, which honour airports pushing boundaries across the continent, once again recognised Rome Fiumicino for its impressive commitment to passenger experience, sustainability and innovation.\n\nWith air travel bouncing back strong over the last couple of years, and even more growth expected in 2025, airports are having to adapt to new challenges in security, operations, staff wellbeing and environmental goals.\n\nThis year's awards focused on the airports that met these challenges directly, with several special awards handed out besides those based on passenger numbers.\n\nGermany's Munich Airport won the Digital Transformation Award thanks to its use of service robots and AI to improve operations and passenger experience.\n\nMaastricht-Aachen Airport in the Netherlands took home the Eco-Innovation Award for its bold 'Electrify' project, which aims for fully electric international travel.\n\nFrance's Lyon Airport was recognised with the HR Excellence Award for its strong focus on diversity, equity and inclusion in managing its workforce.\n\nA special Award for Exceptional Resilience was given to Ukrainian airports, which honoured their incredible efforts to maintain operations and care for staff despite huge challenges amid ongoing conflict with Russia.\n\nOther winners included Ireland's Cork Airport, praised for growth and sustainability in the under five million passengers category.\n\nVasil Levski Sofia Airport, based in Bulgaria, was recognised for its ambitious and 'compelling' efforts towards net-zero emissions in the 5 to 10 million passenger range.\n\nAnother German airport, Hamburg, also impressed judges with its carbon-free goals and passenger comfort, winning in the 10 to 25 million passenger group.\n\nAthens International Airport, Greece's busiest airport, stood out in the 25 to 40 million category for tackling challenges like seasonality and tourism collaboration.\n\nBut it's Rome Fiumicino that continues to dominate the biggest category: airports handling over 40 million passengers.\n\nIts recent launch of Europe's largest solar farm, which cuts over 11,000 tons of CO2 a year, along with its data-driven approach to management, helped secure its seventh consecutive win.\n\nLondon's Heathrow Airport was also highly commended, but the popular Italian airport remains firmly on top.\n\nEarlier this year, the most dangerous airports in the world were revealed \u2013 and one is so feared that only eight pilots are approved to land there.\n\nIn a video shared to TikTok by @spreadinggeo, it\u2019s said that Paro Airport, in Bhutan, has the fifth most precarious landing on the planet.\n\nThe runway at Bhutan\u2019s only international airport is completely surrounded by the Himalayas and, when landing, planes have to dive through narrow valleys with no radar.\n\nFor this reason, just 17 pilots are certified to land here, and can only do so during daylight hours, and at specific times in the afternoon during windy seasons.",

      "text": "The most dangerous airports in the world revealed - including popular European holiday destination and runway where only eight pilots are allowed to land\nThe most dangerous airports in the world have been revealed \u2013 and one is so feared that only eight pilots are approved to land there.\nIn a video shared to TikTok by @spreadinggeo, it\u2019s said that Paro Airport, in Bhutan, has the fifth most precarious landing on the planet.\nThe runway at Bhutan\u2019s only international airport is completely surrounded by the Himalayas and, when landing, planes have to dive through narrow valleys with no radar.\nFor this reason, just 17 pilots are certified to land here, and can only do so during daylight hours, and at specific times in the afternoon during windy seasons.\nNext on the list is Courchevel Altiport, which serves the ski resort in the French Alps \u2013 and is only accessible to small planes and helicopters.\nNot only is the runway here on an upward slope, but it also has ski runs right next to it, no lights, and is covered in snow and ice 70 per cent of the year.\nThe airport has seen multiple crashes over the years due to low visibility, and planes skidding, including one in August 2021 with one fatality.\nThe airport that takes the third place spot is very surprising, given that it sees over 1.6 million tourists through its doors every year.\nParo Airport , in Bhutan, is completely surrounded by the Himalayas and, when landing, planes have to dive through narrow valleys with no radar\nCourchevel Altiport serves the ski resort in the French Alps \u2013 and is only accessible to small planes and helicopters\nMadeira is the fourth most visited region of Portugal, but the island has one of the most perilous airports in the world, due to the fact it\u2019s built over the ocean and has very strong crosswinds.\nTo be able to land here, pilots must undergo additional training.\nThere have been four fatal plane crashes at Madeira Airport, with the most recent on 11 September 2003, when a British pilot and nine Spanish passengers died shortly after taking off.\nNext up is Toncontin International, an airport in Honduras that\u2019s completely surrounded by mountains.\nTo land, planes have to make a tight 45-degree turn just moments before touchdown.\nAccording to @spreadinggeo, experienced pilots commonly say, \u2018You don\u2019t land at Toncontin, you survive it.\u2019\nThe airport has seen many fatal crashes, with the most recent being in February 2011, when a Central Airways flight crashed on approach, 20km from the airport.\nAll 14 onboard the aircraft were killed.\nMadeira is the fourth most visited region of Portugal, but the island has one of the most perilous airports in the world, due to the fact it\u2019s built over the ocean with strong crosswinds\nAt Toncontin International, an airport in Honduras that\u2019s completely surrounded by mountains, planes have to make a tight 45-degree turn just moments before touchdown\nThe most dangerous airport in the world is Lukla Airport \u2013 also known as Tenzing-Hillary Airport \u2013 in Nepal, a tiny airport nestled among the steep mountains of the Himalayas\nThe most dangerous airport in the world is Lukla Airport \u2013 also known as Tenzing-Hillary Airport \u2013 in Nepal, and passengers may have to take something strong to steady their nerves here.\nThe tiny airport nestled among the steep mountains of the Himalayas is 1.5 miles above sea level and surrounded by sharp peaks of up to 18,000ft tall.\nSo treacherous is the landing that only eight pilots in the world are qualified to land there. Until July 2011, just one airline, Druk Air, was allowed to use the facility.\nThe runway is just 6,500 feet long - one of the few in the world shorter than their elevation above sea level.\nPlanes have to weave through the dozens of houses that are scattered across the mountainside - coming within feet of clipping the roofs.\nFlights are only allowed during the daytime and under visual meteorological conditions - strict light allowances in which the pilot must make his judgements by eye rather than rely on instruments, as is the case in nighttime flights.\nStrong winds whip through the valleys, often resulting in severe turbulence. Passengers who have been on flights to the airport have described the landing as 'terrifying'."

      "text": "ACI EUROPE reveals Best Airport Award winners for 2025\n20 June 2025\nAthens: The annual ACI EUROPE 2025 Best Airport Award winners were announced yesterday during the Gala Dinner of the 35th ACI EUROPE Annual Congress and General Assembly, taking place in Athens, Greece, hosted by Athens International Airport.\nThe ACI EUROPE Best Airport Awards honour the airports truly leading the way \u2014 from the largest and busiest hubs to Europe\u2019s smaller yet essential regional airports. With 2024 passenger traffic surpassing pre\u2011pandemic levels and further growth expected in 2025, airports are facing new challenges in operations, sustainability, passenger experience, security, financial resilience, and staff wellbeing. Europe\u2019s airports have needed to adapt at incredible speed, with rock\u2011solid resilience and innovative strategies to get ahead of fast\u2011changing market dynamics. This year\u2019s award theme of \u2018the challenges of growth\u2019 recognises those who have risen to meet these demands head\u2011on.\nFour area\u2011specific awards were also presented, including Digital Transformation Award, Eco\u2011Innovation Award, HR Excellence Award and World Business Partner Recognition.\nAWARD FOR EXCEPTIONAL RESILIENCE \u2014 UKRAINIAN AIRPORTS\nA surprise announcement for attendees, ACI EUROPE decided to present Ukrainian Airports with an Award for Exceptional Resilience: recognising the grit and steadfastness with which they have weathered the past years. With their airspace closed and all air connectivity lost, they have worked tirelessly to preserve existing infrastructure and strived to maintain operational readiness, all whilst caring for their own staff. With a full loss of operating revenues and war\u2011inflicted damages, ACI EUROPE chose to recognise this exceptional and unprecedented hardship with an award representing the support of the European airport community.\nDIGITAL TRANSFORMATION AWARD \u2014 MUNICH AIRPORT\nThe Digital Transformation Award, an initiative of the SESAR Joint Undertaking in collaboration with ACI EUROPE, recognises a European airport that has embraced digitalisation, and adopted innovative technologies and procedures to improve the safety, capacity, efficiency, and environmental footprint of its operations. This year\u2019s winner, Munich Airport, impressed the judges with a wide range of technologies that have enhanced both passenger experience and operational efficiency: including service robots and AI for turnaround management. Through a strategic focus on digital transformation and ecosystem collaboration, they have positioned themselves as leaders in digital aviation.\nAthens International Airport was also highly commended in this category.\nECO\u2011INNOVATION AWARD \u2014 MAASTRICHT\u2011AACHEN AIRPORT\nThe Eco\u2011Innovation Award commends an airport that has demonstrated outstanding environmental performance and an innovative approach to environmental management. A record number of airports submitted applications this year; demonstrating the airport industry\u2019s genuinely proactive approach to reducing its impact on the environment.\nThis year\u2019s winner, Maastricht\u2011Aachen Airport, was highly praised for its project Electrifly \u2014 a pioneering fully electric door\u2011to\u2011door international travel experience. The jury was impressed with the highly ambitious and innovative aspects of the project, charting the way forward for zero\u2011emission air transport of tomorrow, in collaboration with a wide array of stakeholders. Its efforts serve as a blueprint model for other airports to emulate in advancing multimodal journeys, including fully\u2011electric flights.\nAvinor Stavanger Airport was also highly commended in this category.\nHR EXCELLENCE AWARD \u2014 LYON AIRPORT\nThe HR Excellence Award recognises an airport\u2019s HR department that has demonstrated excellence in managing human resources and developing the airport workforce for the future; aiming to give exposure to new procedures and skills for the overall betterment of the airport community. This year, the applications were judged with a special focus on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI).\nLyon Airport\u2019s winning application included a wide range of outstanding initiatives, demonstrating genuine commitment to DEI. Lyon Airport\u2019s HR department set out a comprehensive plan to identify, monitor and improve its DEI policies, with judges noting the project demonstrated both an individual and collective leadership approach in a truly inclusive workplace.\nWORLD BUSINESS PARTNER AWARD \u2014 ELLA SOLTANI, TO70 Aviation\nThis award recognises an ACI EUROPE World Business Partner, either individual or company, that has made significant contributions to the industry. It commends the exemplary efforts made by the World Business Partner community and the value they provide to ACI EUROPE as a whole.\nThe winner, Ella Soltani of To70 Aviation, has been a reliable and trustworthy contributor to many of ACI EUROPE\u2019s activities. Her involvement in the Environmental Strategy Committee, the Stargate Project, as well as through a number of industry conferences and events where she took on an active role of moderator and animator of important discussions with sustainability at the heart and displaying unparalleled energy and deep technical expertise, makes her award well-earned.\nIN THE UNDER 5 MILLION PASSENGERS CATEGORY \u2014 CORK AIRPORT\nThis award was secured by Cork Airport, who demonstrated strong performance across a range of metrics \u2014 including a period of booming passenger growth (+10%, YoY), all whilst enhancing operational efficiency, passenger experience and environmental responsibility. Impressively, they have made outstanding strides in sustainability \u2014 achieving the best performing commercial semi state body in the Republic of Ireland two years in succession for carbon reduction whilst delivering a fast, friendly, service to passengers.\nTallinn Airport was also highly commended in this category.\nIN THE 5\u201110 MILLION PASSENGERS CATEGORY \u2014 VASIL LEVSKI SOFIA AIRPORT\nThe winner, Vasil Levski Sofia Airport wowed the judges with what they described as a compelling, ambitious, and well\u2011structured transformation strategy, including efforts to support human capital development and strengthen connections with local communities. Judges also praised its ambitious plans for, and current progress towards, net zero by 2036.\nLarnaka International Airport was also highly commended in this category.\nIN THE 10\u201125 MILLION PASSENGERS CATEGORY \u2014 HAMBURG AIRPORT\nHamburg Airport, this year\u2019s winner, was particularly commended for a long\u2011term focus on digital processes, enhanced passenger comfort and extensive initiatives aimed at securing a carbon\u2011free future. Alongside impressive route and airline growth, the airport is on track to become its country\u2019s first CO\u2082\u2011free metropolitan airport \u2014 powered by its own wind farm and green district heating.\nMilano Linate Airport was also highly commended in this category.\nIN THE 25\u201140 MILLION PASSENGERS CATEGORY \u2014 ATHENS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT\nNoted for its ability to address its challenges head on through strategic strengths, winners Athens International Airport were applauded for always pushing themselves to be better. Having tackled seasonality and scaled new heights in terms of destination promotion through collaborations with key aviation and tourism stakeholders, they are truly unmatched winners in this category.\nOVER 40 MILLION PASSENGERS \u2014 ROME FIUMICINO AIRPORT\nIt is not the first time that Rome Fiumicino Airport has won in this category, but its continued commitment to excellence makes them worthy of taking the title multiple times. They were particularly commended by judges on the environmental front, with this year\u2019s launch of Europe\u2019s largest self\u2011consumption solar farm \u2014 producing 30 GWh/year and cutting over 11,000 tons of CO2 annually. A data\u2011driven approach to airport management and reinforced commitment to stakeholder collaboration sealed its continued recognition.\nLondon Heathrow Airport was also highly commended in this category.\n__________________\nDownload the photos from the Best Airport Awards 2025 ceremony here."
