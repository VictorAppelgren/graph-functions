      "summary": "The article argues that the rise of data breaches and ransomware in early 2025, driven largely by social engineering attacks on IT help desks, shows that technology alone is insufficient for business security. It stresses the importance of robust password hygiene, multi‑factor authentication, and emerging passkey technology to harden first‑line defenses. Beyond tech, the piece calls for continuous, tiered cybersecurity training, a zero‑trust approach, and a culture that prioritizes vigilance and accountability to build long‑term resilience.",
