  "content": "Krasnov, as he is usually wont to do, likes to suck up all the attention and oxygen out of any hot issue du jour in order to place himself front and center in the media \u2026 daily! It\u2019s incessant and unending. And it is getting increasingly worse. Were it to actually lead to meaningful policy and constructive outcomes, it might perhaps be worthwhile and even bearable. But it is almost as if it has become noise for noise\u2019s sake \u2026 with nary anything meaningful resulting from it. The matter of finding a workable ceasefire and eventual cessation of hostilities in the Russo-Ukrainian war has unfortunately and sadly become the latest platform for such unavailing noise-making by Krasnov \u2026 to the needless suffering of the people of Ukraine and to the detriment of America\u2019s global standing.\n\nThe Ukrainians and the Europeans must by now be suffering from a Krasnovian whiplash. He seemingly pinballs from one policy polarity to the other by the day, if not by the hour. All that big production leading to the horrendously ill-conceived Alaska summit with Putin in which he seemed to accede to all of Putin\u2019s wishes and threw Ukraine under the bus by publicly delivering Putin\u2019s ransom note with a loud warning ... \u201cUkraine Must Accept It\u201d seems like eons ago. But it was just last week.\n\nThis week, after President Zelenskyy and his amazingly diverse and cohesive European support rolled into the White House, Krasnov is now singing a different tune\u2026 that Russia is the aggressor and that America is considering the possibility of declaring the air space of Ukraine as a \u201cNo Fly Zone\u201d in support of the ground swell of global offers to provide Ukraine with real enforceable \u201cSecurity Guarantees\u201d (whatever that means). To discerning ears, that really amounts to simply a lot of meaningless grand standing hooey \u2026 empty and vacuous in its hurried utterance and lack of any cogent policy gravitas. It came across as another effort by Krasnov to get ahead of and simply insert himself front and center of the growing international \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d movement.\n\nOne can only wonder if either he or the White House has truly worked out and mapped out what a real \u201cNo Fly Zone\u201d would mean and the resultant obligations which will entail upon the government of the United States now and into the foreseeable future. We are now in the throes of painfully dis-orienting policy-making actuated by the idiosyncrasies and vacillating personal whims of an uncurious mind with all the unhappy attributes of the Dunning\u2013Kruger effect. Unfortunately, Zelenskyy and Europe, for now have to continue expending an inordinate amount of time and effort to manage this situation \u2026 owing to the unique position the U.S. still occupies as primus inter pares of the the Atlantic Alliance and NATO/OTAN.\n\nPutin, on the other hand, knows this personality type all too well. He has shown nothing but what appears to be amused disdain and lack of seriousness with any of the effete utterances and threats made against Russia since Krasnov was again inaugurated into the U.S. Presidency in January 2025. He has been playing Krasnov like the proverbial fiddle \u2026 with zero consequences to himself or Russia to date. Putin can afford to be comfortable in his disdain. Why? Because in spite of all the incessant daily gyrations and noise from the White House, the words that really matter to Russia\u2019s current situation come from another source \u2026 one which keeps a careful and studied near aloofness from the daily back and forth except for the occasional expression of high-minded desire to see a peaceful end to the Russo-Ukrainian war \u2026 The People's Republic of China. For Putin, at this point in time, that is what really matters because in a rare moment of official candor, the Chinese government told the world :\n\nAnd increasingly evidence from intelligence sources as well as the battlefield leave no doubt that China is serious about what its Foreign Minister has said \u2026 extensive evidence of Chinese equipment, technology and even nationals fighting for the Russians keeps turning up. China also continues to provide both economic and political support for Russia, enabling Moscow to continue the war, however ineffectively. China is a vital strategic partner of Russia's and, as the dominant and larger partner, holds influence over Moscow's decision-making. It is also quite reasonable to assume that North Korea, another client state of China would not be as openly involved, including thousands of soldiers, on Russia\u2019s side if China did not support Pyongyang\u2019s growing involvement:\n\nThus, even if Putin disdains the pronouncements of the U.S. and Europe, it has to pay attention to what China thinks \u2026 because China, at bottom, is a trading nation and whilst its burgeoning economic power accrues much global power and influence, it cannot afford to cut off the hand that feeds it, as it were \u2026 trade with the United States and the West as a whole. Krasnov makes daily noises about tariffs and a militaristic pivot towards curtailing Chinese power in Southeast Asia. Which again elicits relatively careful studied and calibrated push backs from Beijing.\n\nIn antiquity, Athens and Sparta kept rubbing against each other in what is known as the \u201cThucydides' Trap\u201d, a term popularized by American political scientist Graham T. Allison, which describes the perceived tendency towards war when an emerging power[China] threatens to displace an existing great power[United States] as a regional or international hegemon. In the final analysis, one would hope that unlike Athens and Sparta, China and the West, inter-dependent as they are, will do what is necessary to obviate the likes of the catastrophic Peloponnesian War. One fervently hopes that China will find a way to pull Putin and Russia from their hurtling dash to self-destruction and the needless convulsions and dislocations of a wider war.\n\nSo the reported upcoming meeting in Beijing of presidents Putin and Xi during China\u2019s commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in Asia, could perhaps become a pivotal date in history. Surely, in the wake of the Krasnov-Putin Alaska Summit and the galvanizing global \u201cCoalition of the Willing\u201d effort, China will have something to say to Putin about his increasingly faltering war effort against Ukraine. Krasnov this week started pushing for a face-to-face meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy. But would it happen? Would China allow Putin to participate even if he was willing to? After all Zelenskyy today clapped back and refused China becoming one of the \u201csecurity guarantors\u201d?:\n\nIt is quite understandable that President Zelenskyy feels this way about China. But regardless of Zelenskyy\u2019s unhappiness with China, it is increasingly evident that the end of this horrible war, absent a total catastrophic defeat of one side or total exhaustion of both sides, will come down to a negotiated agreement between the West(led unfortunately by Krasnov) and China\u2019s Xi, the modern day Athens and Sparta, as it were:\n\nFor the sake of the good brave people of ADAPTIVE INDOMITABLE UKRAINE and their bright prosperous future, I believe that no matter how hurt President Zelenskyy is by how China has behaved in this war, he should bring to the China-Ukraine\u2019s relationship the same spirit of studied aplomb and careful curation with which he has managed the unctuous, self-dealing Krasnov. No matter what any one says, the giant unmentioned dragon in the negotiating room, China, can not long be ignored. Great powers do what great powers do. President Zelenskyy MUST keep his eyes on the ultimate prize \u2026 a free, democratic, prosperous and fully European Ukraine.",

      "text": "- Category\n- Latest news\nChina Will Not Allow Russia to Be Defeated in Its War in Ukraine, Chinese Foreign Minister Says\nDuring a closed-door, four-hour meeting in Brussels, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas that Beijing cannot accept a Russian defeat in its war against Ukraine.\nAccording to South China Morning Post on July 4, which cited multiple sources familiar with the closed-door meeting, Wang expressed serious concern that a Russian defeat would shift the full focus of US strategic pressure onto China.\nThe remarks came during a tense four-hour meeting in Brussels \u2014 Kallas\u2019s first major diplomatic engagement since assuming her new post as the EU\u2019s top diplomat. Despite the frank tone, Wang denied any financial or military backing for Moscow.\nThis statement essentially confirms what many in Brussels already believe to be China\u2019s true position, despite Beijing\u2019s official stance that it is \u201cnot a party to the war.\u201d\nAccording to the sources, Wang argued that a Russian loss would be strategically dangerous for China, as it could lead to the United States shifting its full attention to countering Beijing.\nThe conversation, described as both tense and intense, marked Kaja Kallas\u2019s first major diplomatic engagement in her new role. Throughout the four-hour meeting, Wang Yi firmly rejected accusations that China is providing military or financial support to Moscow. He also repeatedly interrupted the discussion to deliver \u201chistory lectures\u201d\nEarlier, it was reported that Russia is reportedly seeking to expand transport infrastructure in occupied Crimea with the help of Chinese companies, according to Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Service."

Not without China in picture\nA Putin\u2013Zelenskyy meeting is virtually impossible before a Putin\u2013Xi meeting takes place\nDespite Trump\u2019s blitz attempt to arrange such talks before Putin\u2019s visit to China, the Kremlin is doing everything it can to stall for time.\nDe facto, Russia is now experiencing the lowest level of sovereignty since Putin came to power. He is going to Xi with a request for permission to continue his so-called \u201cspecial military operation.\u201d\nAfter Alaska, Moscow officially proposed that China become a guarantor of the deal. In plain terms, this means Putin wants to present himself as a conditional mediator between Beijing and Washington. In reality, however, all he can offer are joint projects in the Northern Sea Route and Arctic development.\nPutin\u2019s actions show that he no longer pretends to be a third pole of global power. Instead, he acknowledges his need for dual protection so that one side does not crush him\u2014particularly given Russia\u2019s technological backwardness and inability to build a so-called sovereign economy.\nFor Ukraine, this is more of a positive than a negative signal. Neither China nor the U.S. wants to see Ukraine defeated, and neither side seeks a Russian victory. The problem is communication: Kyiv has virtually no channels with Beijing and speaks to Washington mostly through intermediaries. Increasingly, it looks as though the fate of this war will be decided in U.S.\u2013China negotiations.\nAbout the author: Vadym Denysenko, political scientist.\nThe editorial board does not always share the opinions expressed by blog authors.\n- News"

The foreign ministry regularly says China is \u201cnot a party\u201d to the war. Some EU officials involved were surprised by the frankness of Wang\u2019s remarks.\nHowever, Wang is said to have rejected the accusation that China was materially supporting Russia\u2019s war effort, financially or militarily, insisting that if it was doing so, the conflict would have ended long ago.\nDuring a marathon four-hour debate on a wide range of geopolitical and commercial grievances, Wang was said to have given Kallas \u2013 the former Estonian prime minister who only late last year took up her role as the bloc\u2019s de facto foreign affairs chief \u2013 several \u201chistory lessons and lectures\u201d.\nSome EU officials felt he was giving her a lesson in realpolitik, part of which focused on Beijing\u2019s belief that Washington would soon turn its full attention eastward, two officials said."
