  "description": "Analysts fear Trump\u2019s 15% cut of China chip sales could drive Chinese developers into the arms of Huawei.",
  "content": "Why Nvidia\u2019s and AMD\u2019s China deal with Trump could backfire The companies making the most money from the AI boom are the ones selling the processors, such as Nvidia and AMD. On Monday those two chip giants cut a deal with the Trump administration that will allow them to sell their products into the China market. For Nvidia\u2014the dominant provider of AI chips powering the generative AI boom\u2014the agreement means that it can once again sell its H20 chip to Chinese developers. It\u2019s the latest chapter in a long saga. The Biden administration blocked the sale of Nvidia\u2019s most powerful AI chips to China in 2022, but deemed the sale of the less powerful H20 chip an acceptable national security risk. The Trump administration continued blocking sales of Nvidia\u2019s H200 and Blackwell chips. But in April, it went a step further by effectively blocking the sale of the H20 chips, too. The new deal shows that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s charm offensive in Washington, D.C., convinced the Trump administration that the U.S.\u2019s technological, economic, and national security goals are best served when the world\u2019s AI models and apps are built to run on chips made by U.S.-based companies (like Nvidia). Or maybe the Trump Administration just wanted a piece of the action all along. The administration exploited its jurisdiction over export policy to extract a percentage of Nvidia and AMD\u2019s Chinese sales payable to the U.S. Treasury.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Listen, I want 20% if I\u2019m going to approve this for you, for the country,\u2019\u201d Trump said during a press conference on August 12, describing his negotiation with Nvidia\u2019s Huang. He added that Nvidia negotiated the percentage down to 15%. That cut could amount to as much as $3 billion this year, given the high demand for the H20 chips. Trump\u2019s demand for 15% is something new in U.S. trade policy. \u201cThe 15% take indeed sets a precedent,\u201d Columbia Business School professor Lori Yue tells Fast Company. \u201cIt may encourage other companies to adopt similar strategies, viewing profit-sharing as a work-around to government bans.\u201d This could lead to a pay\u2011to\u2011play arrangement where only the richest corporations can afford to pay the government for permission to sell into a foreign market. Indeed, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted during a TV interview that the approach could spread to other products in other industries. The administration\u2019s tax will very likely translate into higher chip prices for Nvidia and AMD\u2019s Chinese customers, such as Tencent. The Chinese government has recently blasted Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips over security concerns, and the new 15% tax is likely to rankle Beijing even more.\n\nThe Chinese government would like to see AI developers building their models and apps on top of AI chips from China-based Huawei. The Trump aAdministration may be driving some of Nvidia\u2019s Chinese customers to do just that, even if it requires rebuilding their infrastructure and tech stacks. Musk\u2019s Grok chatbot is making noise but falling behind Grok, xAI\u2019s chatbot, has had a rough week. The model that powers the Grok chatbot on X is Grok 4, which was announced July 9. At the time, xAI said the new model was the most intelligent one in the world. And the model did achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark tests, including the superhard Humanity\u2019s Last Exam, on which it scored 25.4%, three points higher than Google\u2019s Gemini 2.5 Pro. As of August 11, the Grok chatbot is available free to all X users, even those on the free tier. In one sense, it marked an immediate improvement. The social platform\u2019s permissive environment has made it a clearinghouse for all kinds of misinformation and unsupported claims. Now far more people are using Grok to quickly fact-check those statements.\n\nBut on August 7 OpenAI released its new GPT-5 model, which outperforms the Grok 4 models on many independent benchmarks. GPT\u20115 shows state-of-the-art reasoning, math and coding skills, visual understanding, creative writing, and health-related question performance. However, GPT\u20115 scored poorly on SimpleBench, ranking 5th behind Grok 4 and others in humanlike reasoning and social intelligence. While the benchmark results were circulating\u2014and a GPT-5 backlash was growing\u2014xAI CEO Elon Musk threatened to sue Apple for giving OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT app the top ranking among free apps in the App Store (the Grok app ranks fifth). Must presented no evidence, appearing to simply be lashing out. And to make matters worse, Grok\u2019s problems with inappropriate content resurfaced this week. After being taken offline for spewing antisemitic rhetoric in July, the chatbot was again briefly taken offline Monday\u2014this time for reasons not divulged by X. The chatbot had an opinion, however, telling one user that it had been taken offline after angrily stating that the U.S. and Israel\u2019s war on Gaza was a \u201cgenocide.\u201d One user demonstrated that after Grok had been turned on again, it no longer stated that Gaza should be classified as a genocide.\n\nDuring the 2024 presidential campaign, Donald Trump won the support of some tech billionaires, such as Marc Andreessen and Elon Musk, by promising to use a light-touch approach to regulating tech companies, including AI companies. Now Public Citizen is out with a report detailing the extent to which the administration has dialed back oversight and enforcement actions on the tech industry. In just six months with Trump in the Oval Office, the U.S. government has withdrawn or halted 47 of 143 federal enforcement actions against tech companies, the report states. At the start of Trump\u2019s second term, 104 technology companies faced 143 federal investigations and enforcement actions. The administration has withdrawn 38 actions and halted 9 others against 45 companies. Beneficiaries include eBay, Meta, Microsoft, PayPal, SpaceX, and Tesla. The report suggests that political spending generated returns through dropped prosecutions and policy changes. Tech corporations, executives, and investors spent $1.2 billion during the 2024 election cycle, including $863 million in donations to super PACs, $222 million in payments to Trump businesses, $76 million in lobbying efforts, and $25 million in inauguration donations, Public Citizen reports.",

      "text": "ChatGPT-5 beats Gemini and Grok in tests \u2014 here's why that's important\nThe world of AI is competitive. Theoretically, most of the major AI models you\u2019ve heard of are on a similar level. They all offer fairly similar packages and features with few notable differences on the surface.\nHowever, when you dig a little deeper, they all exist on a scale. AI models are constantly tested and benchmarked. These can be tests of their emotional intelligence, coding ability, writing skills, or even just their ability to process tests of logic.\nThis is where, in a world of small margins, these models have the opportunity to come out on top. For the last couple of months, Google\u2019s Gemini dominated most of these tests, then xAI\u2019s Grok stepped in with an update to match Gemini.\nNow, GPT-5 is here. For months, Altman and his team have hyped this up as an industry-defining update. So, now that it has arrived, is this actually true?\nAt first, OpenAI showed off its own benchmarking. It showed what everyone expected: a major upgrade in every single area. Except, as The Verge reported, the graphs weren\u2019t exactly accurate.\nYes, the numbers were right, but the bar graphs used made OpenAI look like it was miles ahead. Looking closer at the numbers, it was closer to having a slight lead.\nNow, available to the public, GPT-5 has been put through external benchmarks separate from OpenAI. This is how it really scored.\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.\nHow GPT-5 scored on benchmark tests\nVellum\nThese tests can range in their evaluations. They can involve asking AI models multiple choice questions, making them solve puzzles, or simply analysing the configurations behind the scenes.\nVellum, an AI benchmarking company, tests models across a wide range of areas. In the company\u2019s LLM leaderboard, GPT-5 takes the top spot for both reasoning (its understanding of biology, physics, and chemistry), with Grok 4 scoring just 2% below it and Gemini 3% behind it.\nGPT-5 also leads the table on high school math ability, with two other OpenAI models following behind it. It came second behind Grok 4 in coding ability (but only by 0.1%).\nHowever, it was nowhere to be seen in tests of adaptive reasoning (how well a model adapts to new concepts instead of relying on pre-learned patterns) \u2014 a skill which Gemini and Anthropic\u2019s Claude led on.\nArtificial Analysis\nAnother popular AI benchmarking leaderboard comes from Artificial Analysis. The ranking board tests models on key metrics including intelligence, price, performance, and speed.\nIn this testing method, GPT-5 takes the top two spots, with its high effort and medium effort models. GPT-5 just scrapes past Grok 4 in the benchmark for model intelligence, scoring 69 (Grok 4 scored 68).\nLMArena\nLMArena tests models across a wide range of categories. These focus on the model\u2019s generation ability with text, code, images, video, and more.\nThe ranking comes from a combination of votes from the public and in-house testing. GPT-5 came 1st for text, coding, and its ability to understand and process visual inputs.\nGPT-5 was also the number one AI model in the company\u2019s arena. This is where hundreds of AI models compete on coding, maths, creative writing, instruction following, and more.\nGPT-5 led in all of these categories in the company\u2019s tests, beating out Anthropic Claude and Gemini in the following positions.\nLiveBench\nThis is one of the better-known tests for AI. LiveBench includes a set of 21 diverse tasks across 7 categories. Each question asked has verifiable objective answers. This removes risks of variability with clear answers needed.\nGPT-5 currently takes the top three spots in the leaderboard through its high, medium, and low versions. GPT-5 high had the highest score on reasoning, coding and agentic coding. It also led with a significant lead in mathematics and language.\nSimpleBench\nIn the lead-up to GPT-5\u2019s launch, there were rumours that the update would be the first AI model to beat the human baseline on SimpleBench.\nThis is a multiple-choice text benchmark for AI. Individuals with high school-level knowledge were asked over 200 questions covering spatio-temporal reasoning, social intelligence, and trick questions.\nNo AI model has managed to beat the human average on this test. So what about GPT-5? Not only did it not beat the human average of 83.7%, but it actually came 5th, falling behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok 4, and two Claude 4 models.\nDoes GPT-5 live up to the hype?\nWe are still early in the life of GPT-5. According to these early tests, OpenAI\u2019s latest update is leading the charge in the vast majority of areas. However, it is worth noting that, while it is at the top of the leaderboards, it is only by a small margin.\nIn most areas, GPT-5 leads by a small percentage, and in some cases, it is winning when all factors are looked at. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it is the best option in all situations but the best overall.\nThere are also plenty of other benchmark tests that the model needs to be tested on. Over the next few months, we\u2019ll see how GPT-5 stacks up against the competition across a wide variety of skills and tests.\nHowever, for now, GPT-5 does seem to have the lead, especially in areas where GPT-5 saw the biggest updates. That includes creative writing, coding, and health-based questions.\nMore from Tom's Guide\n- GPT-5 is here: These are the 7 prompts I\u2019m using to get the most out of it\n- I tested ChatGPT-5 vs Claude with 7 challenging prompts \u2014 here's the winner\n- OpenAI's Sam Altman brings back GPT-4o and boosts GPT-5 limits \u2014 but there\u2019s a catch\nAlex is the AI editor at TomsGuide. Dialed into all things artificial intelligence in the world right now, he knows the best chatbots, the weirdest AI image generators, and the ins and outs of one of tech\u2019s biggest topics.\nBefore joining the Tom\u2019s Guide team, Alex worked for the brands TechRadar and BBC Science Focus.\nHe was highly commended in the Specialist Writer category at the BSME's 2023 and was part of a team to win best podcast at the BSME's 2025.\nIn his time as a journalist, he has covered the latest in AI and robotics, broadband deals, the potential for alien life, the science of being slapped, and just about everything in between.\nWhen he\u2019s not trying to wrap his head around the latest AI whitepaper, Alex pretends to be a capable runner, cook, and climber.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "Elon Musk\u2019s xAI opens Grok 4 access to free tier as GPT-5 backlash grows\nElon Musk\u2019s xAI Holdings Corp. has made the latest version of its artificial intelligence model, Grok 4, free to all users, albeit with usage caps, as controversy continues around OpenAI\u2019s GPT-5 model.\nGrok 4 made its debut on July 10 with improved reasoning, faster response times and broader multimodal capabilities compared with earlier versions. By the numbers, Grok 4 is competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, rival models such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-5 and Anthropic PBC Claude 3.5 in reasoning benchmarks and speed, but until now, it needed a paid subscription to access.\nAccording to an announcement from xAI, free users can now access Grok 4 by using auto mode, with Grok routing complex queries to Grok 4. To trigger Grok 4 directly, users can choose \u201cexpert\u201d anytime to always use Grok 4. The post also added that \u201cFor a limited time, we are rolling out generous usage limits so you can explore Grok 4\u2019s full potential.\u201d\nExactly what those limits are, though, is unclear. According to reports, the limit could be as little as five queries a day or ten messages per 12 hours, although Grok itself, when asked, says that \u201cthe current limits are more generous but temporary,\u201d referencing the announcement from xAI.\nAlongside making Grok 4 available to non-paying users, xAI has also made Grok Imagine, its AI image-to-video generation tool, free for all users in the U.S. for a limited time. Grok Imagine competes with OpenAI\u2019s Sora and Google LLC\u2019s Veo 3 and is available on iOS and Android platforms. Notably, the 15-second videos made by the tool include sound, a feature OpenAI\u2019s Sora is yet to match.\n\u201cThe free rollout is likely a strategic move to boost adoption, gather user feedback and compete with rivals like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-5,\u201d the Grok AI told SiliconANGLE when asking about details of the free offering. \u201cxAI aims to convert free users to paid subscribers by showcasing Grok 4\u2019s capabilities, such as advanced reasoning, multimodal inputs (text, voice, images), and real-time information retrieval.\u201d\nThough Elon Musk and xAI may have always intended to roll out Grok 4 access for free users, the timing is interesting and could be more than a coincidence, as it comes as a significant number of OpenAI users express dissatisfaction with GPT-5.\nOn Reddit and social media, users have described GPT-5 as sterile, overly cautious and lacking the creativity of its predecessor. One user labeled GPT-5 as a \u201ccorporate beige zombie,\u201d reflecting sentiment that the model has lost its charm and connection with long-time ChatGPT users.\nOpenAI has responded by reinstating GPT-4o access for Plus subscribers and increasing rate limits for GPT-5 Thinking. But the way GPT-5 was rolled out and Sam Altman\u2019s and OpenAI\u2019s disconnect with its user base make it an ideal time for competitors to pitch their alternative offerings. Whether intentional timing or coincidence, the net result of xAI making Grok 4 free, even with limited use rates, is offering an alternative to unhappy ChatGPT users.\nImage: SiliconANGLE/Reve\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nSupport our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.
