  "description": "The Athletic looks at the tactical setup of Ruben Amorim's side ahead of the 2025-26 season",
  "content": "This is the latest article in a series from The Athletic breaking down the tactical approach of Premier League teams for the 2025-26 season. Read about other clubs below:\n\nFew managers or head coaches in the game have a tactical philosophy as clear and consistent as Ruben Amorim\u2019s. But within his first year in charge of Manchester United, he has found putting that philosophy into practice has been anything but straightforward.\n\nAppointed 11 league games into last season, Amorim was unable to halt United\u2019s slide from the days of being serial champions during the post-Alex Ferguson era, as they slumped to a record-low Premier League finish of 15th, with the players unable to get to grips with his radically different approach.\n\nImplementing a new system on the fly, mid-season, was always going to bring its share of challenges. But now with the benefit of a full pre-season \u2014 and the additions of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko in attacking positions this summer \u2014 could things be about to change?\n\nHere, The Athletic breaks down Amorim\u2019s tactical vision at United: what he\u2019s trying to build, why it hasn\u2019t clicked yet, and whether this season could mark a turning point.\n\nIn case you weren\u2019t paying attention last season, here\u2019s a quick refresher of the 3-4-2-1 system that Amorim is so resolutely committed to. The graphic below shows United\u2019s average shape during the build-up and creation phases under the Portuguese coach and will be instantly recognisable to their fans.\n\nThis structure is built on three centre-backs at the base, with wing-backs stretching the pitch laterally and vertically, dual No 10s supporting a lone striker and two midfield pivots tasked with holding it all together.\n\nWhether through dogmatic stubbornness or sheer conviction, no manager in the Premier League was more wedded to a single setup than Amorim last season. His United made just seven in-game formation changes, the fewest in the league. \u201cI maintain my idea: I want to play a certain way until the end,\u201d Amorim said after a 2-0 home defeat to Newcastle in December, after he\u2019d been in the job for a month.\n\nThe hope for United is that this consistency of style breeds familiarity, and that the patterns of play Amorim hopes to instil become second nature to the squad. After his first game in charge, a 1-1 draw at Ipswich, he said, \u201cI think my players were thinking too much.\u201d\n\nUnlike previous managers who leaned into United\u2019s chaotic, transition-heavy identity, Amorim has made it clear he wants to \u201ccontrol\u201d games, and believes that a stable, structured approach in possession is key to doing so.\n\nHe\u2019s made some progress in that regard, as shown in The Athletic\u2019s playstyle wheel below.\n\nUnited are among the best in Europe for circulating the ball through central areas, while only Manchester City have recorded a slower average direct speed in the Premier League since Amorim replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag.\n\n\n\n This more measured approach has helped United shore things up defensively \u2014 at least statistically.\n\nWhile they conceded just four fewer goals than the season before, their expected goals against dropped from a massive 70.1 in 2023-24 to a more respectable, though still concerning, 55.1. Building up more slowly with three centre-backs on the pitch means that, when United are turned over, there is at least some structure between the ball and their goal.\n\nStill, adding an extra centre-back to the side hasn\u2019t come without drawbacks, particularly in how it has stifled ball progression. A third of United\u2019s passes last season were played by centre-backs, but many of these were passive, with the defenders often knocking the ball around among themselves.\n\nAt previous club Sporting CP, Amorim spoke about how \u201cthe centre-backs are the builders, more so than the central midfielders.\u201d With United often being outnumbered in midfield, he relies on his centre-backs to progress the ball through the lines and moonlight as holding midfielders as the build-up develops.\n\nFor much of last season, though, Amorim simply did not have that profile of defender at his disposal.\n\nThe graphic below shows that Leny Yoro and Lisandro Martinez are, by some distance, United\u2019s most comfortable ball-progressing centre-backs, both ranking among the Premier League\u2019s top five for line-breaking passes per 90 minutes played last season.\n\nBut both missed extensive periods of that season through injury \u2014 summer 2024 signing Yoro played just 1,162 minutes in the Premier League (of a possible 3,420), and Martinez only 1,754. While Martinez is still making his way back from a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) suffered in February, Yoro has shone in pre-season and his availability will be crucial if United are to build threateningly from the back under Amorim.\n\n\n\n Regardless of personnel, three at the back caused problems for United out of possession. The two central midfielders are left to cover vast amounts of space, especially when both wing-backs push high and none of the centre-backs step up into midfield.\n\nThe pitch map below shows the number of passes played into different zones against United, compared to their six-season Premier League average. While the three-man defence has helped reduce the volume of passes conceded around their own penalty area \u2014 a prominent issue under Ten Hag \u2014 it has also created a soft central zone just past the halfway line.\n\n\n\n A memorable example came in the 1-0 defeat to Tottenham in February, when Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro played as the double pivots. With Fernandes naturally more attack-minded and Casemiro, who was about to turn 33, no longer able to cover ground as he once did, Spurs carved through the centre with ease.\n\nHow Amorim addresses this vulnerability and stops United from getting overrun in midfield will be a season-defining tactical conundrum.\n\nOther options in that area include Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo. Ugarte brings more energy and bite than Casemiro, and is prolific in breaking up play, but his limits in terms of passing range and ability to progress the ball pose a different kind of challenge. Mainoo, on the other hand, shares some of Fernandes\u2019 instincts to drift higher up the pitch.\n\nIt\u2019s not all doom and gloom, though. The signings of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha spruce up United\u2019s attacking options no end, and both could find their strengths amplified by aspects of Amorim\u2019s system.\n\nHis two No 10s are given licence to drift across the pitch and exploit spaces between the lines. Those voids are created in two main ways. First, the marauding, overlapping wing-backs drag markers away with decoy runs, opening up lanes for the attacking midfielders to exploit. This should suit Cunha and Mbeumo, who are both talented ball-carriers.\n\nBelow is an example from United\u2019s pre-season friendly against West Ham, where left wing-back Patrick Dorgu\u2019s run pulls Aaron Wan-Bissaka deep and opens up space for Cunha to drive into.\n\nThe movement of the centre-forward is another important aspect that helps free up the attacking midfielders.\n\nRasmus Hojlund\u2019s struggles last season were well documented, and United\u2019s pass network for that campaign shows just how peripheral the Dane was in their build-up.\n\nNew signing Benjamin Sesko, with his superior target-man qualities, should avoid a similar fate.\n\nAs the plot below shows, the 6ft 4in (195cm) Slovenian is far stronger in the air than Hojlund and fellow United striker Joshua Zirkzee, and also more adept at carrying the ball through take-ons.\n\nFor all Hojlund\u2019s shortcomings in producing decisive contributions, he remained a willing off-ball runner for Amorim. His surging channel runs in behind were often mistimed or directed into non-threatening wide areas, but did still serve to push back opposing defences.\n\nSesko, meanwhile, was frequently forced deeper last season with RB Leipzig\u2019s midfield struggling to progress the ball, yet his run profile from their more successful 2023-24 campaign demonstrates a similar willingness to stretch defences.\n\nWith Cunha and Mbeumo offering more reliable service in behind, and a more complete striker leading the line, United should carry far more threat in the final third this season.\n\nTheir warm-up friendlies may have offered glimpses of greater fluidity and the excitement of new attacking signings, but the intensity of competitive Premier League football is a different beast, one where any tactical vulnerability is quickly exposed and relentlessly targeted.\n\nUnited fans will be hoping that the squad\u2019s summer upgrades, both in system and personnel, have helped improve what has been a spluttering setup.",

      "text": "This is part of a series from The Athletic breaking down the tactical approach of Premier League teams for the 2025-26 season. You can also read about Arsenal\u2019s approach.\nOne of the toughest aspects of transitioning from the Championship to the Premier League is balancing the attacking approach that brought promotion with the required caution against stronger opponents.\nLast season, Leeds United won the Championship with a ball-dominant style but adapting that approach against Premier League teams who control possession, press high and are lethal on the break is harder than it sounds.\nAdvertisement\nDaniel Farke\u2019s side are not going to transform completely. \u201cWe spoke about the way we want to play, how we want to approach the season and how we are not going to change our approach,\u201d Wilfried Gnonto told The Athletic last month.\n\u201cThe level is high, but we want to be aggressive, we want to be dictating games. Hopefully, that\u2019s what is going to happen. When you play against top teams, it\u2019s not always going to be possible, but it\u2019s good to have this type of approach and mentality.\u201d\nThe 4-3-3 adopted in pre-season is a slight change from Leeds\u2019 regular 4-2-3-1, resulting in tweaks to the build-up and defensive shape, and extra physicality in midfield. Yet Farke\u2019s team haven\u2019t moved away from the attacking and defensive principles that led them back to the Premier League.\nIn the Championship, Leeds built up in a 3-1 shape, with one of the two deeper midfielders dropping into the first line to help progress the ball to the wide areas where Farke\u2019s side mainly focused their attacks.\nIn front of them, full-backs pushed forward to support the front four, who were usually in narrow positions, apart from Daniel James, who had the freedom to stick to the touchline to exploit his one-v-one abilities (below).\nThe narrow front three behind Joel Piroe or Mateo Joseph allowed Leeds to attack multiple vertical channels, with the full-backs, Jayden Bogle and Junior Firpo, who has since left, supporting them, as seen in the below example from October\u2019s 2-0 victory against Sheffield United.\nFirpo and Bogle often occupied the width as the wingers roamed inside, but Leeds\u2019 approach was flexible, allowing the full-backs to interchange positions with the narrow forwards.\nWhen they operated more centrally, Brenden Aaronson, Manor Solomon and James helped knit together passing combinations in the final third.\nIn this example, in the 2-0 win at Stoke City in December, Aaronson, Solomon and left-back Sam Byram are overloading the opponent\u2019s right centre-back and wing-back.\nSolomon\u2019s movement prevents Ben Wilmot from tracking Aaronson as Joe Rothwell finds the United States forward between the lines.\nAaronson then immediately puts Piroe through on goal, before the centre-forward tries to round the goalkeeper and strikes the ball into the back of the net.\nIn another example, from the 1-0 victory against Derby County three days later, Solomon attracts the opposing centre-back as Aaronson dashes forward when Byram plays the ball to Leeds\u2019 left-winger.\nAaronson then continues his movement to attack the space between the centre-backs, while Solomon\u2019s pass to Piroe grabs their attention.\nLeeds\u2019 centre-forward then threads the ball through the defence\u2026\n\u2026 to find the third-man run of Aaronson, who slots the ball into the bottom corner to score the winner.\nPiroe\u2019s link-up play is instrumental to Leeds\u2019 attacking combinations. The Dutch forward regularly drops into midfield to aid these moves, either by dragging centre-backs out of position or linking the play.\nThe heatmap of the open-play passes he received in the Championship last season shows an inclination to roam towards the right side of the pitch.\nTowards that side, James\u2019 inside dribbles and his team-mates\u2019 off-ball movement are the initiating moves that allow Leeds to combine and play through the opponent, as illustrated in Piroe\u2019s offside \u2018goal\u2019 against Millwall in March.\nEven if Piroe isn\u2019t central to the move, Leeds\u2019 right-sided combinations were an essential part of their attack in 2024-25. Starting as an attacking midfielder, Aaronson would roam to the right to help Bogle and James, who smartly positioned themselves to enable these combinations.\nTheir first-minute goal in the 2-0 win against Norwich City in January is an example of Leeds\u2019 right flank operating fluently.\nThe dynamics of Leeds\u2019 attack are interlinked. The narrow positioning of the wingers plays an important role in attacking the wide areas while placing them in threatening positions to attack the crosses.\nIn this example, from the 1-0 win against Oxford United in April, it\u2019s the usual approach from Farke\u2019s side with a 3-1 build-up shape, narrow forwards and Bogle in an advanced position.\nAs Joe Rodon searches for a passing option, Piroe drops deeper\u2026\n\u2026 and Gnonto\u2019s similar action means that Oxford\u2019s left-back and centre-back are stretched and dragged out of position. Meanwhile, Bogle complements that with a run behind the defence, which is found by Rodon.\nThe right-back then plays the ball across goal, and Solomon\u2019s initial narrow position makes him a goalscoring option at the back post.\nAnother feature of Leeds\u2019 attack is their focus on crosses towards the back post, which is helped by the narrow positioning of the forwards \u2014 such as in the above example \u2014 or the full-backs\u2019 dashes into the half-space when the wingers stay wide.\nLast season, Leeds scored 15 goals from crosses towards the back post, which was the second-most in the Championship after Coventry City (16). Meanwhile, an accumulated 13.1 expected goals (xG) \u2014 which was the highest in the division \u2014 from 39 chances shows that they were creating high-quality opportunities from these situations.\nThe profiles of Leeds\u2019 wingers and Aaronson suit the Premier League\u2019s transitional nature, as their pace and one-v-one ability make them threatening in these situations. Additionally, Leeds are expected to have less possession this season, which adds to the importance of their transitional threat once they win the ball.\nAdvertisement\nThe data illustrates their focus on getting it forward. \u2018Direct attacks\u2019 are defined as possessions that start in a team\u2019s own half and result in a shot or a touch inside the opposition penalty area within 15 seconds \u2014 in other words, a counter-attack.\nLeeds\u2019 rate of 2.8 direct attacks per 90 minutes in the Championship last season was level with Middlesbrough as the joint third-highest in the league, behind Sunderland (3.3) and Watford (3.1).\nPlenty of these attacking transitions originated from the midfield\u2019s ability to win possession and play the ball forward. Rothwell, Ethan Ampadu, Ilia Gruev and Ao Tanaka protected the space in front of the back four and consistently broke the opponent\u2019s attacks.\nThe deeper midfield duo had another role that helped Leeds\u2019 defence. One of the centre midfielders would drop to defend the area between the full-back and centre-backs, keeping the rest of the defensive line compact, while his partner protected the area in front of them.\nTanaka\u2019s out-of-possession role in midfield was instrumental in Leeds\u2019 promotion. Last season, his 4.8 \u2018true\u2019 interceptions \u2014 denoting interceptions plus blocked passes \u2014 per 1,000 opponent touches was the fourth-highest in the Championship among all defensive and central midfielders who played at least 900 minutes.\nThe Japan midfielder is adept at sweeping up the ball in midfield, whether counter-pressing to regain possession after Leeds lose it or hoovering up loose balls in that area. His rate of 11.1 ball recoveries per 1,000 opponent touches was the fifth-highest in the same pool of midfielders.\nDefensively, Leeds conceded the second-fewest goals (30) in the 2024-25 Championship after Burnley\u2019s extraordinary total of 16. However, they conceded the lowest non-penalty xG per game in the division (0.6).\nConsidering the amount of time they will be defending in the Premier League, building on that defensive solidity will be important. Improving their set pieces could be crucial, too.\nAcross the last two Premier League seasons, all six promoted teams have been relegated. Leeds\u2019 mission is to buck that trend.\n(Top photo: Scott Heppell/PA Images via Getty Images)"

      "text": "Will the return of Rodri propel Manchester City back to the top of the table? Is this the year Manchester United finally regain their status as a genuine Premier League power? How will a tragic summer affect Liverpool on the pitch? Can the promoted teams break the pattern of recent seasons and stay up?\nAdvertisement\nThe 2025-26 season kicks off on Friday and what better way to start the week than by looking ahead to what might be in store over the coming months.\nWe asked all of our writers to submit their predicted Premier League table \u2014 you can see that a little further down this article. (We won\u2019t name the person who had Manchester United finishing in the relegation places \u2014 for now, at least.)\nWe also asked Oliver Kay, Adam Crafton, Tim Spiers, Nick Miller, Simon Hughes, Stuart James, The Athletic FC podcast host Ayo Akinwolere and Cerys Jones to gaze into their crystal balls and go a little deeper on some of the key topics.\nLet us know if you agree in the comments and we definitely won\u2019t be holding the writers to their predictions come May. Honest.\nWho will be much better than last season?\nKay: Manchester United simply have to be, but I\u2019ll look across the city and say Phil Foden, who had such a difficult time last season. I\u2019m always wary of that \u201cclass is permanent\u201d maxim because there are so many cases that suggest the opposite, but I hope and believe Foden will be energised by a summer\u2019s break, even if it was shorter than would have been ideal.\nCrafton: Strange to say about a team who finished second, but I found Arsenal frustratingly sloppy at times last season. They look a much more complete squad this time around, with additions in key positions, and perhaps Eberechi Eze still to come. There really doesn\u2019t look to be a gap in their armour, so Mikel Arteta must have his team firing from the very start to secure the silverware his reign merits.\nSpiers: Manchester City\u2019s biggest problems last season were rooted in their creaky, Rodri-less midfield. With Rodri back and the dynamic Tijjani Reijnders on board, plus some fine additions in the two Rayans \u2014 Cherki and Ait-Nouri \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine they won\u2019t be much improved.\nAdvertisement\nMiller: Tottenham. Which admittedly isn\u2019t saying much, considering they lost more than half their games and finished 17th last season. But if any team needs a manager who will fashion some square holes for their square pegs, rather than trying to ram them into round ones, it\u2019s Spurs: hello, Thomas Frank.\nHughes: Spurs. Otherwise, they might be relegated.\nJames: The bar\u2019s not set very high for Manchester United and Spurs to be \u201cmuch better\u201d than last season. The temptation is to say that Spurs, under Frank, will be the biggest climber. But I\u2019m going to roll the dice and suggest United, with no European football, will be around the top six.\nAkinwolere: Crystal Palace, assuming they\u2019re able to keep Eze. I really like Oliver Glasner as a coach. I\u2019ve watched some of their pre-season games and they have been impressive.\nJones: Manchester United, surely, if only because the bar is so low. I have been saying this since I was studying for my GCSEs and should probably know better by now. Joking aside, this Europe-less season and the new-look front line feel like fertile ground for a rebuild.\nWho will be worse than last season?\nKay: Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest and Brentford could all be excused a slight drop-off after exceeding expectations last season, particularly as the first two will have European commitments to contend with. Brentford are the ones at risk of a steep drop-off. Frank is such a hard act to follow for Keith Andrews.\nCrafton: I am a little worried about Bournemouth, who have lost Kepa Arrizabalaga, Milos Kerkez, Dean Huijsen, and seem to be losing Illia Zabarnyi and Dango Ouattara. Andoni Iraola is a super coach, but that\u2019s a hefty rebuild and replacements may not be through the door until the season starts. I\u2019d also expect a substantial drop-off at Nottingham Forest towards mid-table.\nAdvertisement\nSpiers: Recent history tells us Manchester United take very good/promising players and turn them into disasters (Antony, Rasmus Hojlund, Jadon Sancho, Andre Onana, Mason Mount etc). All the best, then, to xG overachievers Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. Team-wise, it has to be PSR botherers Aston Villa, who look chaotic.\nMiller: Newcastle. At the time of writing, they don\u2019t have a striker who actually wants to play for them, have strengthened in a couple of positions they were already fine in, and their transfer targets are all picking other teams. Not ideal when you have the Champions League to deal with, too.\nHughes: Brentford. Yes, they\u2019re a well-run club, but they\u2019ve replaced the manager who got them into the Premier League for the first time and kept them there for years with someone who, not so long ago, was a talking head on Sky\u2019s EFL coverage. He has made a huge jump.\nJames: Nottingham Forest (seventh) and Chris Wood (20 Premier League goals) have got their work cut out to maintain the same level. But it\u2019s hard to look beyond Brentford, who have lost their manager, their top goalscorer, and their captain. Fair play to Andrews if he proves us all wrong.\nAkinwolere: You have to worry for Brentford, with many key components missing in the team. Frank, Mbuemo, Christian Norgaard and possibly Yoane Wissa. It feels like an uphill struggle if they\u2019re not able to replace the quality they\u2019ve lost.\nJones: Brentford, for all the reasons mentioned above. If Wissa leaves, too, their attack will look very thin and a top-half finish could be tough.\nWho will win the title?\nKay: The least controversial answer is Liverpool, but there are various unknowns: how the new signings will adapt, whether they\u2019re light in certain areas, and, of course, how the loss of Diogo Jota in such tragic circumstances might affect them.\nI\u2019ll say Liverpool, cautiously, but I wouldn\u2019t discount Arsenal, Manchester City, or \u2014 if they can somehow harden up a bit \u2014 Chelsea, all of whom should be stronger.\nCrafton: Arsenal. It\u2019s about time. He\u2019s almost been forgotten in the blur of the summer, but Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s departure to Real Madrid will be big for Liverpool.\nSpiers: Manchester City had a disastrous 2024-25 season and still only finished 13 points behind Liverpool. They undoubtedly have the best manager, striker and possibly squad in the league, and I think they\u2019ll probably overhaul Liverpool again.\nMiller: Oh god, I\u2019m falling for it again: Arsenal. Broadly because they seem to have actually addressed their problems this summer, rather than Arteta looking at their squad and saying \u201cNo, we just need one more beefy centre-half to play at full-back\u201d.\nAdvertisement\nHughes: Liverpool. I\u2019m not convinced their eye-catching summer in the transfer market results in eye-catching performances straight away because it will probably take time for the team to gel, but they have recruited proven quality and upgrades in most positions.\nJames: It\u2019s been such a traumatic summer for Liverpool that nobody can be quite sure how they will respond. But my instinct tells me that Arne Slot and his players will develop an even closer bond in the wake of the Jota tragedy and, with the help of some outstanding signings, retain the title.\nAkinwolere: I really want to say Arsenal! Oh, go on then\u2026 Arsenal. As you can tell, I\u2019m not fully convinced, but I have to believe all the pain of consecutive second-place finishes has shown Arteta what he needs to add to this team.\nJones: Liverpool. Arsenal and City\u2019s problems helped them last season, but they have not stood still at the top. Slot\u2019s squad has got even stronger and I don\u2019t feel anyone else has added enough to keep up.\nResults in full: Where our writers think teams will finish\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n45% | 38% | 14% | 3% | |||||||||||||||||\n31% | 31% | 31% | 7% | |||||||||||||||||\n21% | 21% | 45% | 13% | |||||||||||||||||\n3% | 10% | 10% | 74% | 3% | ||||||||||||||||\n3% | 45% | 17% | 24% | 10% | ||||||||||||||||\n28% | 41% | 14% | 7% | 10% | ||||||||||||||||\n24% | 21% | 41% | 10% | 3% | ||||||||||||||||\n18% | 14% | 18% | 17% | 10% | 3% | 10% | 3% | 3% | 3% | |||||||||||\n3% | 28% | 31% | 10% | 10% | 7% | 3% | 7% | |||||||||||||\n3% | 10% | 14% | 17% | 21% | 7% | 17% | 7% | 3% | ||||||||||||\n7% | 3% | 21% | 17% | 17% | 21% | 3% | 7% | 3% | ||||||||||||\n3% | 3% | 3% | 21% | 21% | 10% | 7% | 28% | 3% | ||||||||||||\n3% | 10% | 10% | 21% | 24% | 14% | 7% | 10% | |||||||||||||\n3% | 7% | 3% | 7% | 21% | 17% | 17% | 17% | 7% | ||||||||||||\n7% | 7% | 7% | 17% | 21% | 24% | 10% | 7% | |||||||||||||\n3% | 3% | 7% | 24% | 14% | 28% | 17% | 3% | |||||||||||||\n7% | 3% | 10% | 21% | 24% | 34% | |||||||||||||||\n3% | 7% | 10% | 17% | 7% | 34% | 21% | ||||||||||||||\n3% | 7% | 14% | 21% | 28% | 24% | 3% | ||||||||||||||\n7% | 7% | 10% | 76% |\nWho is the best signing so far?\nKay: I\u2019ve been less than enthusiastic about Chelsea\u2019s approach in the transfer market in recent years, but looking at Jorrel Hato for \u00a335m and an initial \u00a329.1m for Estevao \u2014 and possibly a \u00a340m deal for Alejandro Garnacho \u2014 the potential upside of those deals is enormous (I stress potential because there are still aspects of Chelsea\u2019s approach that leave me sceptical).\nCrafton: There have been some great signings by big Premier League clubs plucking from the middle class of the top flight. Joao Pedro to Chelsea and Kerkez to Liverpool seem surefire bets.\nSpiers: You can have your flair players, your tricky flickers and your goalscorers all you like, but the best hairy-arsed tackler in the Premier League in recent seasons was Fulham\u2019s Joao Palhinha \u2014 and Tottenham have brought him back to England for peanuts. He could transform their team at both ends of the pitch. Shoutout for Sunderland signing Granit Xhaka, too.\nAdvertisement\nMiller: Fair play to whoever is persuading players to join Sunderland, because Xhaka is a hell of a get. Viktor Gyokeres is very \u2018final piece in the jigsaw puzzle\u2019 at Arsenal. Florian Wirtz could turn out to be a sort of super deluxe utility man for Liverpool, and wherever he plays, I think he\u2019ll be magic.\nHughes: Joao Pedro. Chelsea needed a top-class striker and now they have one.\nJames: Wirtz would be an obvious answer. But I\u2019ll throw a left-field name into the mix, purely because I said at the Copa America last summer that Colombia\u2019s Jhon Arias \u201cmust surely be on the radar of top European teams\u201d. It disappoints me that Wolves, 12 months later, haven\u2019t even offered a word of thanks.\nAkinwolere: Gyokeres \u2014 is he really the elite striker Arsenal have been looking for? How will he fit their system? His hunger for goals and his tireless work rate should bode well for a team that struggled to bury key chances last season. I\u2019m not expecting 40 goals, but I am expecting some top-bins bangers.\nJones: Gyokeres. 54 goals in one season speaks for itself. He might need a bit of time to slot into Arsenal and the Premier League, but once he does, he can be the focal point they sorely need. Considering what strikers seem to cost these days, an initial \u00a355m isn\u2019t bad either.\nWhich player are you most looking forward to watching?\nKay: In addition to Wirtz, who is mesmerising, there\u2019s Arias, who enthralled me during the Club World Cup, Cherki at Manchester City, Estevao at Chelsea, and, if the opportunity arises and they\u2019ve done their homework on time, the precocious Max Dowman at Arsenal and Rio Ngumoha at Liverpool.\nCrafton: Cunha at Manchester United. Some players grow a few inches in that jersey, and many more are weighed down by the history and scrutiny. He strikes me as someone who will relish the expectation.\nSpiers: It\u2019ll be fascinating to see if Gyokeres solves Arsenal\u2019s striker conundrum. His uncontrollable, lusty desire for scoring goals is tangible and his numbers are ridiculous, but most of the Portuguese league would be the equivalent of Championship standard and below. Also, Arias at Wolves promises to be high on the fun scale.\nAdvertisement\nMiller: Wirtz. I don\u2019t especially care how many goals he scores or assists he gets or chances he makes. He just moves in such a slinky, elegant way that I\u2019ll be paying attention to him and only him when Liverpool play. I also like the cut of El Hadji Malick Diouf\u2019s gib, although West Ham will probably ruin him somehow.\nHughes: Wirtz. No Liverpool signing has excited me more since the arrival of Fernando Torres.\nJames: Players (plural), if you don\u2019t mind. Wirtz \u2014 what a signing. The incredibly gifted Cherki \u2014 intrigued as to how Pep Guardiola uses him (and, in particular, how much the City manager trusts him off the ball). Last but not least, 15-year-old Dowman. A sensational talent.\nAkinwolere: Joao Pedro in this Chelsea setup looks tasty. If the Club World Cup appearances are anything to go by, \u00a350m could be money well spent.\nJones: I\u2019m always wary of overhyping teenage \u2018prodigies\u2019, but Chelsea\u2019s Estevao is very exciting. He is an unapologetic entertainer and his dribbling, especially for someone so young, is ludicrous. Romantic or naive as it sounds, it\u2019s always intriguing to hear an incoming player describe football as a \u201cspectacle\u201d.\nWhich manager is under the most pressure?\nKay: Not to say his job is under immediate threat, but the pressure on Ruben Amorim to show he can turn Manchester United around is huge nonetheless. They won just seven of his 27 Premier League games last season. The pressure will lift very quickly if his new-look team can hit the ground running. But if they don\u2019t \u2014 and it is far from a gentle start fixture-wise \u2014 it\u2019s going to intensify.\nCrafton: The answer to this is always the Manchester United manager, but Daniel Farke has plenty to prove at the highest level at Leeds, while Eddie Howe is coming through a turbulent summer, and I\u2019m curious to see how and if the dynamics at St James\u2019 Park resolve themselves. Oh, and England head coach Thomas Tuchel. There\u2019s a pretty big tournament coming up.\nAdvertisement\nSpiers: Not necessarily to save his job, but there will be pressure on Frank in what is, after 12 years in management, a huge step up for his first big job. Patience may be in short supply on the back of the enormous high of Spurs ending their trophy drought.\nMiller: No need to overthink this: it\u2019s Amorim. That said, Brentford promoting Andrews from set-piece coach to top man in a summer when they\u2019ve lost two of their best players and a third might go is enough to cause a \u2018mechanic regarding a leaky engine\u2019 sharp intake of breath.\nHughes: Amorim. If United are occupying roughly the same position they finished in last season come November, he\u2019ll be gone.\nJames: Farke could be gone very early in the season \u2014 I don\u2019t see Leeds hanging around if they start poorly. There\u2019s potential for Brentford to make a quick change, too. But, realistically, Amorim goes straight in at No 1. It can\u2019t go on like this, Ruben.\nAkinwolere: Amorim. The buffer of arriving mid-season can only last so long. They have spent a lot of money in attacking areas, but there is still a fair amount of work to do. The fans are impatient and rightly so.\nJones: Amorim. Last season, he had the caveat of arriving earlier than he wanted, and Manchester United\u2019s top brass and supporters have shown him a lot of goodwill. In a campaign with no European football, after being backed so heavily, he has to deliver European qualification at least.\nWho will be top and bottom at Christmas?\nKay: I\u2019m struggling with this one. I know Crystal Palace will finish somewhere between 10th and 15th, but I couldn\u2019t tell you where they or anyone else will be at Christmas. I wouldn\u2019t have predicted this time last year that Liverpool would be four points clear at Christmas with a game in hand. It\u2019s a less predictable league right now and it\u2019s more appealing for that.\nAdvertisement\nCrafton: Arsenal top, Burnley bottom. Burnley\u2019s opening seven games are brutal and threaten to immediately undermine whatever Scott Parker is seeking to build.\nSpiers: Liverpool have the best XI but it may take some time for their signings to gel, so Manchester City will be top. Burnley\u2019s promotion was built on an insanely good defensive record but they\u2019ve lost a couple of key players and \u2014 call me crazy \u2014 but Armando Broja (two goals in 43 Premier League appearances) might not fire them to safety.\nMiller: Arsenal top, Brentford bottom. Gyokeres has quite a \u2018hit the ground running\u2019 vibe to him, so I think Arsenal will be strong in the first half at least. Brentford will have sacked Andrews in around November, but the revival under Sean Dyche won\u2019t have quite started by Christmas.\nHughes: Arsenal (I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll win it) and Leeds, who will have a new manager by that point if this is the case.\nJames: I\u2019ll answer this in reverse order because I feel slightly more confident of that part of the prediction: Burnley. Top? Realistically, it\u2019s one of four: Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City and Donald Trump\u2019s Chelsea. Liverpool it is.\nAkinwolere: Liverpool have done a lot of their business early and I think Arsenal and Manchester City will take time to find their flow this time around. It\u2019s hard to look past the newly promoted teams at the bottom. But I\u2019ll go for Brentford.\nJones: Liverpool have given themselves plenty of time to bed in new signings, so they should start strongly; I agree with Ayo that Arsenal and Manchester City will need longer to settle. Sunderland have spent a lot, but not on their defence, which could see them fall behind the pack quickly.\nWill any of the three promoted teams survive?\nKay: Yes. It\u2019s been alarming to see the three promoted clubs go straight back down again in the past two seasons, but I\u2019ll be the cheery voice for once and say I can see two or perhaps even all three of Burnley, Leeds and Sunderland surviving this time. How \u2014 and at whose expense \u2014 I\u2019m less confident about. Unlike some, I think it\u2019s a dauntingly strong league.\nAdvertisement\nCrafton: I do think the Premier League is better with Leeds and Sunderland in it \u2014 and more clubs from the north in general \u2014 so I would love to see it. But it\u2019s such a big gap. The promoted clubs should remember that teams like Brentford, Brighton and Bournemouth began their Premier League journeys playing very pragmatic football to earn their right to stay in the division.\nSpiers: Sunderland have done the best summer business, although they also had the most ground to make up. Leeds probably have the best chance and there are obvious vulnerable prey to catch, including Brentford post-Frank and also Wolves, who have been circling the drain for three years and not done much about it.\nMiller: I would have said Burnley, on the basis of their extraordinary defence last season, but selling James Trafford will kick a hole in that. Sunderland have spent a fair bit, but they need essentially all of those moves to go right for them. Leeds are interesting, but at the time of writing, probably don\u2019t have quite enough. That said, Brentford and Wolves will probably be bad, and I think Fulham could regress, so one of the new lot will probably stay up\u2026 I\u2019m just not going to commit to one! Sorry!\nHughes: No, but Burnley have the best chance if they are able to defend as they did last season and perform generally as uncompromisingly as they did when Dyche was there.\nJames: Leeds and Sunderland have the potential to be more competitive than Ipswich Town, Leicester City and Southampton last season. Leeds on the basis of\u2026 well, just being Leeds and making Elland Road a bit of a fortress. Sunderland, on the face of it, have done some very good transfer business. If I had to pick one\u2026 see my final answer, mate.\nAkinwolere: Sunderland have spent a lot of money, but that often doesn\u2019t equal survival. I\u2019m excited by the signings of Simon Adingra and Xhaka, though. Parker struggled at the helm with both Fulham and Bournemouth last time he managed in the Premier League, as did Farke with Norwich City. With Manchester United and Tottenham having such bad seasons and still surviving last time out, you worry about the financial and quality gap already created by the established teams.\nJones: Leeds and Burnley haven\u2019t added enough quality, and while I would love to believe Sunderland\u2019s record spending could save them, the jump in quality after eight years away feels insurmountable and they haven\u2019t reinforced their defence enough. A Cunha-less Wolves could fall far enough to give one side a lifeline, though.\nThe Manchester City case has still not been resolved. What does that mean for the season?\nKay: I don\u2019t know what it means for the season. I think the repercussions are felt more widely in the sense that people doubt English football\u2019s ability and authority to implement its rules and regulate its clubs. That\u2019s not a new story, but it\u2019s a worrying one because, whether you like the rules or not, the alternative is anarchy.\nAdvertisement\nCrafton: The players who may have benefited from some of the earliest alleged breaches have now retired, while the charges begin to feel so drawn-out, so historic, that anyone who continues to bang on about City or scrutinise the club is depicted as being very boring or having a vendetta. But when this thing ever gets resolved, in whichever direction, it will be humongous.\nSpiers: Well, certainly nothing for City, who have spent money in 2025 like it\u2019s going out of fashion. It\u2019ll hang over the season like a Manchester raincloud and, frankly, it\u2019s ludicrous that it\u2019s gone on this long.\nMiller: That we\u2019ll have even more weak banter centred around the number 115, and news stories roughly every three weeks that say \u2018Manchester City\u2019s case could be resolved this week\u2019. I suggest nobody engages with this until it\u2019s actually done: your life will be much more pleasant.\nHughes: Nothing. Life will continue as it has ever since the investigation started.\nJames: More regular questions over the fence from my (lovely and retired) Manchester City-supporting neighbour as to whether I\u2019ve heard anything. The whole saga is tiresome (the case, that is, not talking to my neighbour).\nAkinwolere: That I\u2019ll try my best to show enthusiasm for the subject on the podcast, and Matt Slater will try his best to be enthused by the fact that nothing has changed.\nJones: That we will be answering \u2018The outcome of Manchester City\u2019s case is still under appeal, so what does that mean for the season?\u2019 this time next year \u2014 that is, if it\u2019s even got that far.\nWhich game in the opening weeks will tell us a lot about the season to come?\nKay: There are some big games early on, but Liverpool versus Arsenal on August 31 jumps out. Both will have had a tough-looking away game by then (at Newcastle and Manchester United respectively), so either of them could come out of that game looking like champions-elect or seeming vulnerable, whether that is fair or (as I suspect) not.\nAdvertisement\nCrafton: Newcastle versus Liverpool in the second week. And, sorry Eddie, I am not available to play up front.\nSpiers: August 24, Everton versus Brighton. Will Hill Dickinson Stadium be a shiny modern fortress for Everton, or was it the tight, thunderously atmospheric Goodison Park that was keeping them afloat all these years? More importantly, will the acoustics at the new stadium reverberate boos like Goodison did?\nMiller: There have been plenty of positive noises coming from those who have watched Manchester United in pre-season, and a front three of Cunha, Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko is potentially quite sexy. But if they get bulldozed by Arsenal on the first weekend\u2026 cue the beleaguered Portuguese man in the hoodie declaring they should just be relegated now.\nHughes: It will be interesting to see how the Club World Cup impacts the performances and results of the teams that competed in it. On one hand, they might be better prepared at the start and tire later. On the other, they might not be as fresh.\nJames: Opening weekend, never mind opening weeks. Manchester United versus Arsenal. Mbeumo, Sesko and Cunha \u2014 let\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got. As for Arsenal, are they finally going to win the title again, and is Gyokeres the missing piece? (A sentence I never thought I\u2019d type when I watched him score a long overdue first Swansea goal in January 2021).\nAkinwolere: It all starts on the opening weekend for me, and Manchester United versus Arsenal is big for both clubs. Arteta needs to win big this season, as does Amorim. These two need to hit the ground running and both have fanbases that want to see improvement.\nJones: Week five looks fun: Manchester United versus Chelsea will test Champions League ambitions and Wolves versus Leeds hints at whether we can expect a proper relegation battle. Most of all, Arsenal versus Manchester City helps establish if either will emerge as a clear challenger to Liverpool, or if they will just fight each other for second.\nThe thing we\u2019ll all be saying in May is\u2026\nKay: What next for Marcus Rashford/Jack Grealish/Raheem Sterling as he heads back to Manchester United/Manchester City/Chelsea after his loan spell?\nCrafton: The tickets for the World Cup are HOW MUCH?\nSpiers: Will Manchester City\u2019s 115 charges case be resolved this week?\nMiller: I wish I hadn\u2019t fallen for the Arsenal thing, again\u2026\nHughes: Time to put your feet up, Pep.\nAdvertisement\nJames: Fair play to you, Ange Postecoglou, for keeping Leeds up.\nAkinwolere: Chelsea have got their eye on another 10 players to bolster the squad ahead of next season, with more outgoings still to come.\nJones: With Premier League Golden Boot winner Harry Maguire up front, nothing can stop England. It\u2019s coming home.\n(Top photos: Getty Images; design: Dan Goldfarb)"

      "text": "This is part of a series from The Athletic breaking down the tactical approach of Premier League teams for the 2025-26 season. You can also read about Leeds United\u2019s approach.\nIt\u2019s now been over two decades since Arsenal were last crowned Premier League champions.\nFive FA Cup victories have eased the long wait in the years since, but an elusive 14th league title remains the priority in north London, with a third consecutive second-place finish under Mikel Arteta last season only fuelling their determination to go one better this time around.\nAdvertisement\nArsenal\u2019s recruitment drive this summer speaks to that ambition, having invested close to \u00a3200million into the squad, already the second-most lavish window in the club\u2019s history. Martin Zubimendi was the first to arrive, one of Europe\u2019s most coveted deep-lying midfielders, before the arrivals of Noni Madueke and, in particular, Viktor Gyokeres, began to hint at a change of approach at the top of the team \u2014 both bringing more direct dribbling and raw power to the front line.\nWith an eye on pre-season performances, The Athletic breaks down how Arsenal could approach the upcoming season.\nThough Arsenal have been highly adaptable from game to game under Arteta, cycling through various build-up shapes and attacking styles across his five-and-a-half years in charge, a handful of key themes \u2014 most obvious to the eye \u2014 have emerged.\nThe first is that Arsenal have become much more patient in their approach play, preferring to build up carefully with measured passing out from their centre-backs, looking to create numerical advantages, with more advanced players taking up pre-planned positions on the pitch.\nAs we can see below, comparing the speed Arsenal move the ball towards goal with the number of passes they average per possession sequence, they have tended towards Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City sides near the bottom right corner of the graph.\nThe exact shapes that Arsenal take up can change from minute to minute, but the broad idea is to have at least two, often three, quick defenders on hand to defend against any potential counter-attacks. New signing Cristhian Mosquera, a strong, clean-tackling central defender standing at 6ft 3in (191 cm), is another to add to their collection.\nUp ahead, two midfielders will look to jump into spaces to receive the ball, while five attacking players \u2014 generally speaking \u2014 will take up positions across the width of the pitch to stretch and overload the opposition defensive line.\nHere against Real Madrid, for example, we see Myles Lewis-Skelly drifting in from left-back to help form that 3-2-5 shape, acting as a midfield receiver alongside Thomas Partey to allow Declan Rice and Martin Odegaard to push on behind enemy lines. Such a structure allowed for incisive passing moves through the centre of Madrid\u2019s passive 4-4-2 block.\nOther times it\u2019s Odegaard dropping in, sometimes Rice floats out wide \u2014 the key is flexibility and movement, looking to pull players out of the defensive shape and strike quickly to exploit the spaces.\nFrom a build-up perspective, the arrival of Zubimendi opens up more variety.\nHe is a press-resistant midfielder with an unerring ability to receive a wide range of passes, often under pressure, and emerge unscathed with the ball. Such ability allows the 26-year-old to play as a sole receiver against less aggressive teams, allowing Arsenal to push more players up the pitch.\nPart of what makes Zubimendi so valuable in these sequences is his constant movement to offer himself for the pass, often seen bouncing around midfield, constantly scanning the pitch, with a real knack for showing up at the right time to help his team-mates escape.\nIn the sequence below against Milan, for example, he starts as the deepest midfielder, lingering behind the two opposition strikers. But he is quick to dart towards Mikel Merino as he receives a pass with his back to goal, jumping from the blind spot and leaving centre-forward Mattia Liberali behind.\nHaving created that separation from his marker, Zubimendi can push forward and produce a nicely weighted through ball to Reiss Nelson into the box.\nAgainst deeper defensive structures, he\u2019s also happy to pick up the pace and force the issue when the opportunity presents, as against Villarreal below.\nWith Noni Madueke doubled up on out wide, Zubimendi shuffles backwards to receive the pass, and then fires a pass into Martin Odegaard, breaking the first two lines of the opposition\u2019s 4-4-2 defensive block.\nThough early in his Arsenal career, a series of smooth performances on the ball, topped off with a pleasing array of punchy passes into the final third, bodes well for the season ahead.\nThough largely successful across the seasons, Arsenal\u2019s attentive approach to build-up can see them frustrated by rigorously organised, aggressive pressing sides.\nOn top of disheartening results against Fulham, Newcastle and Everton last campaign, there has been a feeling at times during pre-season that the approach play can feel blunt and easily containable at times, with a lack of tight-space dribblers, off-the-cuff creativity, and forward thrust to move stubborn defensive shapes around.\nAdvertisement\nIt\u2019s where the second recurring theme of Arteta\u2019s Arsenal jumps out \u2014 a tendency to lean heavily on their right-hand side.\nAs we can see from the visual below, no team came close to the percentage of attacking touches that Arsenal took in the right third last season \u2014 even with the inventive trio of Bukayo Saka, Ben White and Odegaard having large periods out with respective injuries.\nWhite\u2019s return to fitness in pre-season has been particularly promising, as he has provided overlapping runs to aid Saka on the right.\nArsenal have also benefited from more direct approach play in parts of matches this summer. The emphasis on playing long passes in behind was noticeable against Spurs, with at least five played in the opening 20 minutes in Hong Kong.\nThey cropped up again in the 3-0 win over Athletic Club, which was the first time Arteta started Odegaard, Zubimendi and Rice as a midfield trio. Zubimendi and Rice excelled in particular, interchanging positions and continuing to find Saka in dangerous areas.\nArteta said after the win that: \u201cWe saw another evolution today.\u201d But that was just one part of it.\nNew centre-forward Gyokeres made a devastating habit of storming down the left flank during his time at Sporting CP in Portugal, while his desire to target the spaces in behind and tussle with defenders can provide Arsenal with a more direct route through a defensive block should all else fail.\nWhile he was unable to score in his first two pre-season appearances, there were glimpses that he could be a handful down Arsenal\u2019s weaker side. He took it upon himself to dart into the left channel against Villarreal, while Gabriel Martinelli occupied the centre-backs.\nLater in the first half, Gyokeres popped up and produced a nice shimmy to cut inside and get a shot away from a similar position, before showing his intensity without the ball in the second half \u2014 dropping back to nick the ball, barging his way to the edge of the penalty area and almost slipping Saka through inside the box.\nAdvertisement\nIn moments like these, Arsenal\u2019s midfielders and wingers will need to make strong supporting runs to help Gyokeres. He has claimed over 10 assists in his last three seasons in all competitions, and this could be a critical source of goals that some may not expect.\nThe Sweden international undoubtedly adds a new dynamic to Arteta\u2019s attack.\nA look at where he and Kai Havertz received their passes last season illustrates that the latter drifts to the right, but Gyokeres maintains a much more central presence.\nGyokeres also took 9.1 touches inside the opposition box per 90 minutes last season, as opposed to Havertz\u2019s 5.1, suggesting he can also help with those more instinctive finishes closer to goal.\nGyokeres\u2019 battering ram approach might also help to boost Arsenal\u2019s transitional potential, particularly after quick recoveries in midfield.\nOnly Bournemouth, Newcastle and Liverpool won the ball more often outside their own defensive third than Arteta\u2019s side last season, but as the graph below illustrates, only 6.7 per cent of those resulted in a shot within 10 seconds, the third-lowest rate in the division.\nGyokeres at least gives them the option to speed things up and break quickly \u2014 he is able to chase down a long pass and scrap his way into dangerous areas unlike any other player that Arsenal currently possess.\nThere may also be a slight alteration in how Arsenal generate chances from wide areas.\nWhile Lewis-Skelly has shone by drifting into midfield from left-back, there seems to have been more emphasis on him fulfilling more traditional full-back duties this summer.\nNew first-team coach, former Manchester United and Real Madrid defender Gabriel Heinze, was seen doing crossing drills with the 18-year-old \u2014 situations that were replicated in games.\nAlso, for Arsenal\u2019s first goal of pre-season, Lewis-Skelly overlapped to allow for a pass inside to Jakub Kiwior, whose first-time cross was turned in by Saka.\nGyokeres\u2019 first Arsenal goal then came from an almost identical passage on the right.\nSaka retrieved an overhit corner and laid the ball back to Zubimendi to whip into the box first time. The Swede timed his run and headed the ball well to get off the mark.\nAside from crosses, Arsenal will also be thankful for the individual brilliance shown by Max Dowman.\nThe 15-year-old has shown extraordinary confidence and talent against top European opposition, slaloming through challenges and winning two penalties with his blend of acceleration and technique.\nArteta played down Premier League involvement when asked after the loss to Villarreal, but his involvement this summer has been telling. And to his credit, the England Under-17 international has made an impact whenever he has played. Whether the manager thinks someone so young is ready to contribute to Premier League games remains to be seen.\nSimilar levels of individuality have also been shown by Ethan Nwaneri, who has played a more central role. Having contributed to 11 goals last season, the 18-year-old\u2019s ability to beat a man one-v-one, find team-mates and take shots that others wouldn\u2019t will be important alongside the qualities of Odegaard, Zubimendi and Rice in midfield.\nArsenal\u2019s dedication to set-pieces has been another distinguishing feature of Arteta\u2019s reign.\nSpecialist coach Nicolas Jover constantly develops new routines to give them the dead-ball edge. No team scored more than Arsenal\u2019s 17 set-piece goals last season, while they also generated the most expected goals (xG) from corners in the division.\nAdvertisement\nEarly signs in pre-season suggest that Jover\u2019s influence is showing no signs of slowing down, as a trademark corner routine led to Christian Norgaard\u2019s first goal for the club in the 3-2 defeat to Villarreal.\nBefore the corner is struck, we see six Arsenal players cluster towards the back post, before Gyokeres, Kiwior and William Saliba dart forward, leaving Norgaard behind. In frame three, we see the efforts that are made to block Villarreal\u2019s recovery runs, allowing the Denmark international to head home in space.\nThey have also tried different routines in pre-season. Against Spurs, they had five players starting runs from the edge of the box from one corner, while they split into groups of three against Athletic Club at the Emirates.\nWhatever the season holds, more set-piece innovation should be expected.\nArsenal will know better than anyone that these trends and evolutions will not guarantee that this will finally be the year that they get over the line.\nEven so, it is clear that they have taken steps in an attempt to alter the end of the story that they have become so familiar with.\nIf anything, after setting the pace for most of the 2022-23 title race, the last two seasons have shown how costly dropping points early on can be. They face Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City in their opening five games, so whether they like it or not, eyes will be on them immediately.\nNow, it needs to be their time to deliver.\n(Top photo: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images)"

  "argos_summary": "Ruben Amorim's tactical philosophy at Manchester United has faced challenges since his appointment, leading to a disappointing 15th place finish last season. With a full pre-season and new signings like Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, there are hopes for improvement in the 2025-26 season. Amorim's commitment to a 3-4-2-1 system aims to control games, but the team has struggled with ball progression and midfield vulnerabilities. The upcoming season will be crucial for Amorim to establish his vision and improve United's performance.",
