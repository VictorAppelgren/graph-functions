  "content": "Plus, we share more banking changes\n\nBANK BLOW Popular bank AXING key service from today in blow to 1.9million customers \u2013 are you affected?\n\nAN online bank with 1.9 million customers is making a huge change to accounts.\n\nFirst Direct customers will no longer be sent paper saving account statements as of today, September 1.\n\nInstead, customers will be able to view, download and print their statements using the bank's app or online banking.\n\nThe change will only affect those who have a savings account with the bank.\n\nIt comes after the bank sent an email to customers back in July explaining the change.\n\nCustomers have expressed their frustration with the change.\n\nOne saver said: \u201cBeen with @firstdirect for 25 years. They\u2019re fine except for ONE thing. I want a paper statement.\u201d\n\nAnother posted on Facebook: \u201cI just got an email from first direct telling me they will no longer send me paper bank statements.\u201d\n\nThe change will happen automatically so customers do not need to do anything.\n\nPlus, other information may still be sent to customers by post.\n\nCustomers will receive an email as soon as their new statement is ready, so they should make sure their details are up to date.\n\nTo do this, visit the \"profile\" section of the app or \"my details\" section of online banking.\n\nWhen they receive the email, customers need to log on to view the new statement.\n\nTo find it in the app, they just need to click the three dots next to their account.\n\nThe switch is not final and customers who still want paper statements will still be able to change back after September 1.\n\nTo do so, they will need to log into online banking, click on \u201cmy details\u201d then go to \u201cstatement preferences\u201d.\n\nIf they need help, then they can contact customer services in the \u201cmessage us\u201d section of online banking.\n\nAlternatively, they can get in touch with First Direct customer services by going to the help section of its app.\n\nAnd First Direct is not the only bank making changes for customers.\n\nNationwide also switched to paperless bank statements last month.\n\nCustomers will instead need to log in to their banking app or go on the website to check their statements.\n\nYou can still opt in to get paper statements but they won't be sent out automatically any more.\n\nLloyds Banking Group, which owns Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland, did the same in 2023.\n\nThe change came in for customers who had online banking set up.\n\nElsewhere, NatWest also increased its fees for cash payments, cheque transactions and certain online transactions.\n\nAs of August 30, cash payments into and out of business accounts will see their fees increase from 70p per \u00a3100 to 95p per \u00a3100.\n\nCheque payments will also jump from 70p to 75p, irrespective of whether they are processed by hand or mobile.\n\nThe bank will also hike some charges connected to its BACS payment system, with processing fees rising from 18p to 21p.",
