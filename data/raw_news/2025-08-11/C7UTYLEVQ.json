  "title": "Disabled people in London face 'accessible housing shortage'",
  "description": "The Mayor of London has been warned of \"deeply distressing\" conditions for those in need.",
  "content": "Disabled Londoners are being failed due to a \"chronic\" shortage of accessible housing, the Mayor of London has been warned. The chair of the London Assembly Housing Committee, Zo\u00eb Garbett, has written to Sir Sadiq following their investigation into accessible housing. A lack of homes which are either built or adapted to enable people with access needs to live independently has led to \"deeply distressing\" conditions for those in need, according to Ms Garbett, a Green Party London Assembly member. A spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: \"The Mayor is committed to ensuring that all Londoners can afford a place to call home and providing genuine choice for London's diverse population.\"\n\nAccording to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS), Ms Garbett said the \"stark and compelling\" evidence heard from stakeholders included one resident left unable to wash themselves after being placed in temporary accommodation without an accessible bathroom. Another had to wait for their partner to lift them two floors up because they could not take the stairs, she added. Laura Vicinanza, from disability charity Inclusion London, said: \"The number of people we spoke to who experience stress, anxiety, depression, who have had to be hospitalised - it is just outrageous.\" Hallie Banish, from the independent living charity Ruils, said: \"This is a housing emergency. \"Everyone deserves safe, accessible, affordable housing and the Mayor needs to do his job in ensuring this bare minimum standard is met.\" Ms Garbett wrote: \"The consequences of inaccessible housing are far-reaching. \"It often leaves people reliant on partners or carers to meet even their basic needs. It can take a profound physical, mental and emotional toll. \"We are clear that deaf and disabled Londoners deserve better; they deserve to live in homes that meet their needs, allowing them to live with dignity and independence.\"\n\nEven where accessible housing does exist, navigating the systems to find it are \"complex and difficult\", she added. Ms Garbett said the \"obvious solution\" was building more accessible homes and retrofitting existing housing, but a lack of data, stemming from a failure to effectively monitor developer standards, meant taking effective action was \"almost impossible\". Other recommendations included ensuring a larger proportion of homes are delivered to the wheelchair accessible standard and holding developers to account for failing to do so. The London Plan, set out in 2021, requires 90% of new build homes be built to be adaptable for residents with accessibility needs, but last year, 23% of new build completions were compliant with this, the LDRS said. A spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: \"Years of under-funding by the previous government, low economic growth, high interest rates and record construction costs have all held us back from building much-needed homes \u2013 and Londoners are suffering the consequences. \"The current London Plan requires 10% of new homes to be wheelchair accessible or adaptable, and a recent consultation to inform development of the next Plan invited comments on how to unlock more housing options for disabled Londoners.\"",

It\u2019s like a franchise: different companies with different approaches, but using common editorial standards and all publishing into the same system.\n- The core purpose of the LDRS is to provide impartial coverage of the regular business and workings of local authorities in the UK, and other relevant democratic institutions such as mayoralties, combined authority areas, P&CCs, quangos, etc.\n- The Local Democracy Reporters' (LDRs) brief is to report on the decision-making process: what decisions are made in the public's name and how they are arrived at, what evidence is presented to the council, etc.\n- The expectation is that LDRs shall endeavour to attend all meetings in person.\n- In two-tier council areas the LDRs should cover district council affairs sufficiently to ensure that significant decisions (eg planning) are reported.\n- LDRs may provide other stories which are focused on local democracy and which are in the public interest so long as that does not detract from the core purpose of the service.\n- All their work must be available to all qualifying partners.\n- National politics is out of scope, but election campaigns and constituency work of MPs, AMs, MSPs and MLAs that specifically relates to relevant local audiences may be covered so long as it does not detract from the core purpose of the LDRS.\nLDRs report to the contract holder, not to the BBC or any other partner.\nWith the guidance and support of the contract holder, LDRs work to the brief covering the stories of greatest public interest and they should not undertake commissions for any partner.\nDirect questions and clarifications relating to content are acceptable, but any suggestions or comments relating to the service should go through a LDR's manager.\nThe only difference between the BBC and others is that it has a right to request interviews or 2-ways for BBC Local Radio. Depending on workload and commitments it is up to each LDR to decide whether or not to agree.\nNo. While meeting the highest standards of accuracy and impartiality, written content may conform to an employer's normal style. BBC training will help create a common standard for media content production.\n- All content must be created for all qualifying partners.\n- Content should be published as soon as possible after a meeting or event.\n- All content must be published using the LDRS Authoring Tool so all partners see it simultaneously.\n- All content must be titled COUNCIL NAME: Story Name.\n- It must be tagged with at least one top-tier local authority, but can have as many tags as are relevant.\n- Images and media must have a descriptive label.\n- Images and media must be rights-free (LDRs should not use their employer\u2019s picture library, or images supplied by agencies or freelance contributors).\n- LDRs should, where possible, assign a \"Feature Image\" to a story.\n- LDRs must provide an Advisory note in the publishing system before the end of every week indicating their diary for the next seven days (or longer).\n- LDRs should source their content. An explanatory Note to Editors at the end of a story regarding the source will reduce queries from partners, especially around whether qualified privilege applies to all or part of a story.\n- LDRs should not file a story based on a press release already in the public domain unless it has been significantly developed with new quotes or information.\n- Embargoed content must explain why publication should be delayed.\n- Posts should be via LDRs' personal accounts rather than contractors' branded accounts.\n- LDRs are encouraged to post an Advisory in the LDRS Authoring Tool to let partners know if they intend live-Tweeting from a meeting, for example.\n- Tagging #LDReporter will help the partnership collate relevant tweets.\n- LDRs should be credited as \"First Name, Last Name, Local Democracy Reporter\".\n- By-lines or references within copy are acceptable.\n- Broadcasters should acknowledge LDRs when they appear on air or when the format allows.\n- Shared credit with other reporters is acceptable if LDRs' content is copied, edited or incorporated into new pieces of work.\n- The LDRS logo can also be used in print, online or on TV, but is not compulsory.\n- LDRs should refer to themselves as \"Local Democracy Reporters\", not \"BBC Local Democracy Reporters\" in all forms of communication, including social media profiles.\n- Corrections and clarifications relating to previously published stories must be clearly highlighted and issued immediately.\n- The headline style should be as follows: 'COUNCIL NAME: Story Name - CORRECTION'.\n- The first paragraph of the body copy should be as follows: 'CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that\u2026'."

Housing needs to be considered in the context of transport and streetscapes and public infrastructure,\" she explained.\n\"I can't get into, I would say, 90% of the shops and restaurants in this area.\n\"If you can't easily get down the street, you can't access the Tube station, then it doesn't really matter that your house is accessible because it is essentially a beautiful prison.\"\nLocal and national decision makers are now being urged to work together to build more accessible homes, especially ones for social rent.\nTracey Lazard, chief executive officer at Inclusion London, said the low percentage of accessible new homes being built in the capital was \"shocking\" and was \"condemning disabled people now to live lives of, frankly, misery\".\nShe added: \"We talk a lot about future proofing and resilience and critical to that has to be about building homes that people can live in throughout their entire lives.\"\nA spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: \"The mayor is committed to meeting London's diverse housing needs and has allocated more than \u00a3100m in funding to deliver well-designed, supported housing to enable disabled Londoners to live independently and access appropriate care.\n\"The mayor also requires a minimum percentage of accessible and adaptable units in all new housing developments funded by his Affordable Homes Programme, helping to build a fairer and better London for everyone.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

She says she then had to crawl up the stairs back to her flat in pain, with her flatmate carrying her wheelchair up the stairs.\nDespite calling \"constantly\", Ms Brown said Crabtree had told her it would not unlock the door, stating it was a fire door and must remain locked, that its offices in central London were too far away from east London, and that the property manager was off sick.\nAdditionally, Ms Brown said when she called Crabtree and explained she was a wheelchair user and the situation was causing her great difficulty, the staff member told her \u201cwhen you live in a block of flats you should expect that the lift will break sometimes\u201d.\n\"It's victim blaming,\" she argued. \"It makes me feel like it's my fault. They have no idea what it's like looking for a property in London [as a wheelchair user].\"\nLondon Fire Brigade (LFB), when contacted by Ms Brown about whether a fire door should remain locked, told her there was no fire safety reason why this would be the case.\nThe LFB told the BBC it was in the process of arranging a visit to the building in question, and the fire safety team had \"spoken with the resident and, as a result, has made contact with the building\u2019s managing agent\".\n- Published14 July 2023\n- Published5 February 2023\n\"It's caused a huge amount of anxiety,\" Ms Brown added.\n\"This is supposed to be the one place you feel safe but not being able to leave is making me wonder if I want to live here any more.\"\nMs Brown described the situation as like being in her \u201cown personal lockdown\u201d, saying she has been unable to go into her office job as usual, has relied on friends coming over to help bring her things, and is considering cancelling her doctor\u2019s appointment on Friday because she does not think she will be able to leave the building.\nShe also said it had impacted her health because she had not been able to go swimming, which is an activity recommended by her medical team.\n\"I feel like I'm being fobbed off - it's been six days,\" she said.\n\"No reasonable adjustments have been made, there has been no suggestion of temporary accommodation, no apology. They just keep saying 'bear with us', which is fine to say if you're not stuck in your home.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

Even the scheme manager said I shouldn't be here.\"\nMr Rollinson went on to say while he was previously in hospital doctors \"found a pulmonary embolism which they said was caused by the stress of the last property\", and he suffered \"further spine damage\" after the fall which meant he had not been able to work.\n\"I didn't want to be doing all this,\" Mr Rollinson said, adding he was \"angry\" with the situation.\n\"I've had to push since 2022 when I first got injured,\" he said.\nAdjustments 'being carried out'\nA Lambeth Council spokesperson said: \"We have been working hard to support our resident on an ongoing basis to meet his needs.\n\"We have secured ground floor sheltered accommodation for him to live in which is suitable for wheelchair access.\n\"The council had the flat assessed by an occupational therapist before he moved in, and again on the day of the move.\n\"Any further adjustments needed to make sure all his needs are met are in the process of being carried out.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

An investigation revealed that many individuals with accessibility needs are unable to live independently due to inadequate housing options, with only 3% of new builds being accessible. The Mayor of London has been urged to take action, including increasing the number of wheelchair-accessible homes and improving the monitoring of developers to ensure compliance with accessibility standards.",
