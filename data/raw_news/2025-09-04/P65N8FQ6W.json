  "title": "Samsung's Galaxy S25 FE 'Fan Edition' Is a Cut-Down S25+ For $350 Less",
  "description": "The Galaxy S25 FE also costs $150 less than the regular S25, which has a smaller display.",
  "content": "You already know what to expect when you see the letter FE following a Samsung product name. Short for \u201cFan Edition,\u201d FE devices are a Frankenstein of components packaged together and sold for less. In the case of the Galaxy S25 FE announced at IFA 2025, the $650 Android phone has the same size 6.7-inch display as the $1,000 Galaxy S25+, while costing less than the $800 Galaxy S25. Yeah, it doesn\u2019t quite fit perfectly on a side-by-side chart comparing Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 series phones, does it?\n\nThat screen is decent on paper. I haven\u2019t seen it in person, so I don\u2019t know if Samsung cut any corners. The FHD+ resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and Vision Booster sound acceptable. Features you\u2019ll find have been cut include the chipset, RAM and storage, and the cameras. The battery is the same 4,900mAh cell. Instead of Qualcomm\u2019s latest Snapdragon 8 Elite, the Galaxy S25 FE has a less powerful Exynos 2400 chip. Instead of 12GB of RAM in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, the Galaxy S25 FE has 8GB of RAM with either 128GB or 256GB of storage. And instead of a 10-megapixel telephoto with 3x optical zoom, the Galaxy S25 FE has an 8-megapixel telephoto with 3x zoom. The Galaxy S25 FE does keep the same 50-megapixel main and 12-megapixel ultrawide cameras and 12-megapixel selfie camera from the Galaxy S25/S25+.\n\nIt still has wireless charging, though it doesn\u2019t support the new Qi2 standard, and wired charging maxes out at 45W, which is plenty fast for topping off when you\u2019re running late.\n\nSamsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 FE is not for me. I\u2019m more of a flagship phone guy, but I get the appeal, especially for FE phones. They\u2019ve got some features from Samsung\u2019s premium phones and lesser ones where it may not matter as much to a price-conscious buyer with a specific budget to spend. If it\u2019s for you\u2014great! There seem to be enough FE buyers that Samsung keeps making them. And if it\u2019s not\u2014move along. Maybe you\u2019ll be more interested in the skinny S25 Edge or the upcoming iPhone 17 family.\n\nThe Galaxy S25 FE is available for order today, Sept. 4, and comes in four colors, including Icyblue, Jetblack, Navy, White. (Yep, those are single-word colors!)",

      "text": "The era of super-skinny phones is here. Beating Apple, which is expected to announce the \u201ciPhone 17 Air\u201d this fall, Samsung used its virtual Unpacked event today to share full details about its own ultra-thin phone, the Galaxy S25 Edge.\nAnnounced at the end of the Galaxy S25 series launch in January, the S25 Edge has been captivating everyone with its slim design. At 5.8mm thick (not counting the camera bump, because why would any sensible company count that?), the S25 Edge is the thinnest Android phone that Samsung has ever made, just beating out its previous slimmest phone, the 5.9mm Galaxy A8 released in 2018. Just look at it\u2014it\u2019s nearly as thin as the USB-C port. Such a skinny phone won\u2019t come cheap when it becomes available on May 30; pre-orders start on May 12. Samsung is asking for $1,099 for the base model with 256GB of storage ($1,219 for 512GB) just to have the privilege to rock a phone that\u2019s 163g.\nSee Galaxy S25 Edge at Samsung.com\nIf you\u2019ve been following the rumor mill, none of the tech specs I\u2019m about to tell you will surprise you at all. Pretty much everything leaked was right on the money. The S25 Edge has a 120Hz 6.7-inch AMOLED display, a dual-lens camera system with a 200-megapixel main lens and 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens, and a 12-megapixel selfie camera. It\u2019s also as durable as any other premium phone, with an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance.\nThe engine powering it all is Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Elite Mobile Platform for Galaxy. Samsung is selling two configurations: 12GB of RAM with 256GB of storage and 12GB of RAM with 512GB of storage. Despite its thin profile, the S25 Edge is packing a 3,900mAh battery. We\u2019ll have to wait to see how sufficient that is, but on paper, that\u2019s a smaller battery compared to the rest of the S25 family, which have 4,000mAh (S25), 4,900mAh (S25+), and 5,000mAh (S25 Ultra). The latest Apple tea leaves suggest the iPhone 17 Air\u2019s battery will not last as long as the iPhone 17 and 17 Pros launching this fall. There is a silver lining: the S25 Edge supports fast wireless charging and reverse wireless charging (useful for charging wireless earbuds). I thought maybe Samsung might ditch both features to make the phone as thin as it could, but both are intact. Your move, Apple.\nThere\u2019s also Galaxy AI\u2014Samsung\u2019s suite of generative AI features\u2014littered throughout its One UI version of Android. Confirmed AI features include the \u201cNow Brief,\u201d which creates notifications and reminders based on your schedule and app usage, and \u201cNow Bar,\u201d which displays live updates and other bite-sized information on the S25 Edge\u2019s lock screen (it\u2019s kind of like the iPhone\u2019s Dynamic Island, but more useful and located at the bottom of the screen). Other camera-centric generative AI features include \u201cDrawing Assist,\u201d which turns sketches into detailed illustrations, and \u201cAudio Eraser,\u201d which removes unwanted sounds like traffic noise in videos.\nI haven\u2019t held the S25 Edge in my hands yet, but I\u2019m certain it\u2019s thin enough to glide through cake. Is it worth risking your new $1,100 phone doing so? Certainly not, but somebody needs to do it\u2026 for science and probably a TikTok video. There\u2019s also a legit concern about whether the S25 Edge will bend easily. I\u2019m sure some YouTuber or influencer will try sitting on it in their back pocket. Until we get a review unit, what do you think about Samsung\u2019s thinnest phone now that we know everything about it? Are the tradeoffs (smaller battery and fewer cameras) dealbreakers? I\u2019m just glad it has two rear cameras instead of the iPhone 17 Air\u2019s rumored single lens."

      "text": "Samsung really wants you to consider its Galaxy S25 for your next Android phone before considering the do-it-all Ultra variant. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ stand well on their own as two smartphones you\u2019d consider over Apple\u2019s or Google\u2019s respective offerings. I\u2019m partially influenced by the fact that there is 12GB of RAM across the board for both models, which means there is now a powerful little Samsung phone, which didn\u2019t really exist before. You used to have to compromise if you wanted something smaller.\nIt remains to be seen whether the camera on the Galaxy S25 models will truly impress, especially since the sensors have not been significantly upgraded. I\u2019m especially curious because this is the first time in a few generations that it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re missing out on something going for the non-Ultra Galaxy variants.\nSee Galaxy S25+ on Samsung.com\nSee Galaxy S25 Ultra on Samsung.com\nWhat\u2019s inside the Samsung Galaxy S25?\nFirst things first, the phones. There is the 6.2-inch Galaxy S25 and the 6.7-inch Galaxy S25+. They come in the same colors as the Ultra, and the blue variant featured here in photos is quite dashing in person. Its backside offers an almost ombre effect from light blue to blue, depending on the angle you\u2019re holding it at. They feel light, like a thin piece of perfectly buttery crust from a freshly baked croissant. They are fingerprint magnets, so much so that scrubbing them out of all the photos was challenging.\nThere is a difference between the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25+ displays. The Dynamic AMOLED display on the Galaxy S25 is only Full HD, while the Galaxy S25+ is QuadHD. But both have a 120HZ adaptive refresh rate. The Galaxy S25 is saddled with a smaller 4,000 mAh battery, and the Galaxy S25+ is almost as big as the Ultra\u2019s at 4,900 mAh.\nThis year\u2019s phones are on the same Wi-Fi 7 track, so feel free to upgrade those routers! Both are powered by the 3nm-sized Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, which is explicitly made for this line of phones. Rather than skimp on RAM, Samsung lets our smaller phone users have as much power in their hands as the rest of us, so even the Galaxy S25 comes with 12GB of RAM, like the Galaxy S25+\u2014logistically, it had to do this if it was going to sell you on using all the new AI features that are part of the package.\nLike the Galaxy S25 UItra, the Galaxy S25/S25+ cameras haven\u2019t been significantly updated. The ultra-wide camera has only a 12-MP sensor, unlike the Ultra\u2019s 50-MP upgrade.\nThis has AI, too\nThe Galaxy S25 and S25+ have the same AI features as their Galaxy S25 Ultra counterpart. This includes Galaxy AI and the \u201ccross-app action\u201d that lets you, for example, grab a set of dates from a screen and put them into your calendar app of choice. The Galaxy S25/S25+ also has access to Google\u2019s new Circle to Search features and the conversational search experience in places like the Settings app.\nOne AI-driven feature I got to try out on the Galaxy S25+, in particular, was the Morning Brief. This is a feature that makes use of all those AI agents that pull in from your usage. I wasn\u2019t expecting to see much for this demonstration because the phones laid out were all brand new and void of much data, so they didn\u2019t have much to work with. But I picked a Galaxy S25+, went into the Morning Brief curious what it would say, and it immediately served me a news story about Melania Trump.\nI asked a Samsung representative if there was a way to \u201cmute\u201d specific suggestions from the news feed or adjust the types of content it serves me. I can\u2019t imagine wanting to see that first thing in the morning when I\u2019m just trying to figure out the weather and where I\u2019ll be needed for the day. It took quite a bit of scrolling and tapping to get to the menu that lets you customize what is pushed through from Samsung News and other sources.\nI didn\u2019t get my answer about whether or not I could scrub out political content exclusively from the Morning Brief, only that it\u2019s a possibility. This is all to say that this is a feature I will be paying close attention to and whether it\u2019s customizable to my liking. Samsung thinks it can guess what I want based on my everyday phone use. I would have liked to see an easier way to long-press the content and select \u201cdon\u2019t show me these kinds of headlines,\u201d the way that Google\u2019s Discover feed lets you do.\nWhere to buy the Samsung Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25+?\nLike its Galaxy S25 Ultra compatriot, the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25+ are available for pre-order today. The Galaxy S25 starts at $800 for 128GB of storage, and the Galaxy S25+ begins at $1,000 for 256 GB. These devices come in the same four color options: Navy, Icy Blue, Mint, and Silver Shadow. You can choose exclusive colors if you order online at Samsung\u2019s website. We\u2019ll have more to say about both phones in our full review of the hardware coming soon."

      "text": "Samsung\u2019s other phone, the Galaxy S25+, is not as extraordinary as its ultimate sibling, the Ultra. It\u2019s hard to get excited about another smartphone, even if it is a solid buy. With seven years of software support, it\u2019s promising that Samsung wants this device to endure. Still, I wish the company would package this model more like it does the Galaxy S25 Ultra. I don\u2019t even care about the S Pen. At a $1,000 starting price, the Galaxy S25+ costs too much not to have far-reaching camera sensors, as the Ultra does, or a better RAM stack. I don\u2019t understand why this can\u2019t be marketed as a smaller Ultra at its price point.\nAt the very least, if you don\u2019t like the size of the Galaxy S25+, you can consider the smaller Galaxy S25, which has almost all the same components. We don\u2019t have the phone in for review yet, though I will explain the differences between the two models if you\u2019re considering one, as it starts at $800. But if you want a bigger phone and can afford the additional cost, I suggest leaning toward the Ultra if you want to take the best pictures, S Pen and all.\nSamsung Galaxy S25+\nThe Galaxy S25+ is a solid device, but it costs too much not to be called an Ultra\u2014and offer some of its features, too.\nPros\n- A beautiful screen, in the dark or direct sunlight\n- Good amount of RAM for the forced AI experience\n- 7 years of software support\nCons\n- AI? Is that what you want to spend a grand on?\n- Where's the zoom?\nSamsung Galaxy S25+ Review: Design\nLooking good, as always\nThe Galaxy S25+ is a Samsung smartphone through and through, from the triple-array camera placement on the back to the right-where-your-thumb-sits power button placement. Samsung made all versions of the Galaxy S25 this year lighter than its Galaxy S24 predecessors by quite a few grams. Compared to the Galaxy S25 Ultra, the Galaxy S25+ is nearly 30 grams lighter than its ultimate big sibling. It shaves some weight since it doesn\u2019t have an S Pen or the extra camera glass. Samsung thinned out the bezels a tiny bit on the regular Galaxy S25/S25+, but not enough that you\u2019ll run out and upgrade. Samsung hasn\u2019t changed the design of this smartphone model in three generations. You\u2019re not missing anything by sitting this one out except a lighter chassis.\nSpeaking of little that\u2019s changed, the Galaxy S25+\u2019s innards are merely a slight bump from last year\u2019s device, even though there is slightly more RAM\u2014that\u2019s been this generation\u2019s best addition to this lineup thus far, that everyone starts with 12GB at least. My biggest complaint was always that the smaller Samsung flagship felt underpowered. The processor has been upgraded to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite, tuned for Samsung devices. It is just as capable as the one in the Galaxy S25 Ultra for playing games, multitasking between apps like music and email, and whipping up GIFs with AI Select. The Galaxy S25+ and Galaxy S25 have the same batteries as last year. I will have an update on official battery abilities in the coming days, as I imagine some software tweaks will have helped these latest devices hold out just a bit longer.\nThe screen size has increased on both Galaxy S25 variants. Samsung increased the display of the Galaxy S25 to 6.2 inches, up from last year\u2019s 6.1-inch display. The display of the Galaxy S25+ also increased slightly to 6.7 inches from 6.6 inches last year. The main difference between the device displays is that the smaller Galaxy S25 has an FHD+ resolution, while the Galaxy S25+ has QHD+. Essentially, the larger device has a higher resolution with a bit more sharpness.\nSee Galaxy S25 Series at Samsung.com\nSamsung Galaxy S25+ Review: Camera\nSame camera, as always\nYou can now consider this particular lineup of Samsung devices as \u201cold faithful.\u201d It\u2019s always a sure bet that you\u2019ll get consistent camera performance with this series, though not necessarily the sharpest and brightest compared to the Ultra variant. The Galaxy S25/S25+ has the same camera system as last year: a 50-MP Wide primary camera with OIS, a 12-MP ultra-wide camera, and a 10-MP telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom and up to 30x digital Space zoom. Sadly, Samsung did not update the Galaxy S25+ series from 12-MP to 50-MP for the ultra-wide like the Galaxy S25 Ultra. The front-facing camera\u2014a little dot in the middle of the top part of the Galaxy S25+\u2014is the same 12-MP camera as last year.\nI will give Samsung credit for its algorithms. I never think a picture will turn out when I see it through the viewfinder, but the final product tends to prove me wrong. My only concern is that at night, it\u2019s harder to get the Galaxy S25+ to focus, even if there\u2019s a bit of off-camera lighting shining through. I\u2019m also still a fan of Google\u2019s nighttime algorithms compared to Samsung\u2019s. And I\u2019m not saying you should buy a smartphone based on its nighttime camera capabilities. But if you\u2019re like me and you\u2019re always chasing the whimsy of the stars, maybe that matters to have that kind of phone in your back pocket. Something to think about.\nI still think the Galaxy S25+ is a little barebones compared to other devices at this price point. Apple\u2019s iPhone 16 Pro and Google\u2019s Pixel 9 Pro start at the same price with 5x optical zoom. If Samsung will price it the same way, why not offer parity between spec offerings? Make the Galaxy S25+ a real choice for folks considering Samsung instead of the backup plan for people who don\u2019t want to spend the extra $300 on the Ultra.\nSamsung Galaxy S25+ Review: Software\nSame Android, as always\nThe Galaxy S25/S25+ ships with the same version of Android as the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It\u2019s Samsung\u2019s One UI 7 on top of Android 15. You cannot escape Samsung\u2019s promises of AI here. It comes preinstalled in all currently available Android flavors, including Google\u2019s Gemini, with the Galaxy S25 series being the first to debut features like song recognition in Circle to Search. It\u2019s a winning moment for Samsung to show itself as a willing partner in Google\u2019s all-platform AI shift. It\u2019s what Samsung hopes will keep you buying its phones over the Pixel devices, even though they aren\u2019t the first to get what\u2019s new from Google.\nSamsung also offers its own AI magic in the form of the Now Brief and things like generative imaging. Weeks later, I still think the Now Brief isn\u2019t so much a utility as it is another app screen to paw at. I\u2019m struggling to understand Samsung\u2019s value-add here. Sure, cross-app integration was announced at Galaxy Unpacked, but is my ability to add a calendar entry to the Samsung Calendar app that the company prefers me to use anyway going to move the needle on sales numbers? At least there isn\u2019t a silo between what Google offers and what Samsung does. AI is simply part of the Android package now.\nSamsung Galaxy S25+ Review: Verdict\nShould you buy the Galaxy S25+?\nI still think the Galaxy S25+ should be an Ultra mini or something similar. The 5x zoom seems essential on a phone that starts at $1,000, mainly if the competition offers it at the same price. Samsung should package this model more like Google did with the Pixel series: two sizes for a \u201cpro\u201d phone plus a regular \u201calmost pro\u201d for people who want to save a little money because they don\u2019t need all that. It could even keep the RAM stack at 12 GB instead of 16 GB. I really just want more zoom capability, especially when the price has four digits in the number, and it\u2019s supposed to be somewhat comparable to the Pixel and iPhone Pros.\nOkay, but if you don\u2019t care about all that\u2014I\u2019m aware it\u2019s pedantic on my part\u2014you might be able to find this one with discounts and sales at a price that\u2019s more attractive than what it\u2019s going for outright. In this case, I suggest you check out the Galaxy S25+ if you\u2019re due for an upgrade and coming from a three- to four-year-old Android device. The phone is slightly lighter than the Ultra, making daily carry easier. It has the same charging speeds as the rest of the Galaxy S25 family, stellar battery life, and a sharp screen fit for YouTube on the train. Just don\u2019t zoom too far with your photos! Nothing past 3x."

      "text": "After some major leaks earlier this month, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Buds 3 FE are finally here, and on paper, they look like a pretty good deal. While the \u201cFE\u201d moniker, short for Fan Edition, often signifies a lower price point in exchange for some compromises on features, the new Galaxy Buds 3 FE actually beats Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro in a couple of key areas, and one of those battlegrounds is battery life.\nSee Galaxy Buds3 FE at Samsung.com\nAccording to Samsung, the $150 Buds 3 FE offer 6 hours of battery with active noise cancellation (ANC) activated and 8.5 hours with ANC off. That\u2019s compared to the $190 Buds 3 Pro battery life, which clocks in at 6 hours and 7 hours with ANC on and off, respectively. I would have liked to see the ANC battery life get a bump here too, but it\u2019s nice to know that if you need to, you can get an extra hour and a half for less money. Those battery life numbers aren\u2019t mind-blowing in the general field of wireless earbuds, but they do put the Galaxy Buds 3 FE on par with comparably priced buds from OnePlus.\nThe other category that the Galaxy Buds FE 3 excel in is weight. These wireless earbuds are actually 5 grams lighter than the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, which isn\u2019t an enormous difference but is enough to give the FE a slight edge if you\u2019re comparing the two against each other. It\u2019s also worth noting that Samsung managed to decrease the weight while upgrading the battery life, which is always a feat worth mentioning when it comes to any gadget, earbuds included.\nThe next biggest selling point is the fact that the Galaxy Buds FE 3 match a lot of the Pro features while keeping the starting price lower. The first thing you\u2019ll probably notice is that the new Buds FE 3 borrow the same AirPods-like design as the Buds 3 Pro, which is nice if you like Apple\u2019s white earbuds but maybe not so nice if you\u2019re looking for something different. There is a slight difference here in that the Galaxy Buds FE 3 come with a matte finish as opposed to the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro\u2019s glossy one, though, and they don\u2019t have any LED lights on the stems\u2014sorry, blades\u2014themselves.\nOn top of a similar design, the Galaxy Buds FE 3 also come equipped with real-time AI translation features (only if you have a Samsung phone) and hands-free Gemini compatibility so you can activate and use your voice assistant without unlocking your phone. AI features probably won\u2019t be make-or-break for most people, but it\u2019s nice to know that they\u2019ll be there if you should need/want them.\nAs is the case with any pair of wireless earbuds, the biggest question will be in the sound. One notable difference between the Buds 3 Pro and Buds 3 FE is that the former has a dual-driver design while the latter has just one driver. It\u2019s hard to say what kind of difference that will make without hearing them back-to-back, but I\u2019m guessing the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro will have an edge when it comes to fidelity and dynamic range. Even with that difference, however, the Buds 3 FE feel like a good deal for the price, and if you\u2019re looking to save a little bit of money but not make any major compromises, this could be the pair of Samsung wireless earbuds you\u2019re looking for."

      "text": "We\u2019re going back to IFA in Berlin! Well, some members of the Gizmodo crew, including our consumer tech reporter, Kyle Barr, will be roaming the labyrinthine halls of the Messe Berlin to find the smartest, coolest, and weirdest consumer electronics you\u2019ll have the luxury of spending your hard-earned paychecks on in the near-ish future. The rest of the gang will be hanging back and live blogging from afar.\nExpect the usual tech giants like Lenovo and Samsung to have a big presence. If you\u2019ve ever been to IFA (it\u2019s open to the public), you\u2019ll know there\u2019s a lot to take in. You\u2019ll definitely get your steps in, walking miles just to see a new laptop or the latest robot vacuum. IFA is not quite as expansive as CES, and even though there are attendees from all over the world, nothing compares to the sardine-packed hellscape that is Sin City every January.\nEurope\u2019s largest tech show officially runs from Sept. 5 through Sept. 9, but Gizmodo will be tackling the show in the few days right after Labor Day, when many announcements drop early. Bookmark this page and Ctrl/Cmd+R often, because we\u2019ll be updating this live blog often throughout the multi-day show.\nWhy Not Just Buy a Movie Theater?\nAnker\u2019s Soundcore Nebula X1 Pro is an entire cinema in one massive, rollable package. While the original Nebula X1\u2019s big claim to fame was its internal liquid cooling and extra-large projection lens, the new version contains an entire speaker setup for spatial surround sound either in your home or outdoors. The projector can hit 4K at 3,500 lumens, which is pretty damn bright, but it will also cost you $4,000. \u2014Kyle Barr\nAnker\u2019s AI Voice Transcriber is So Damn Small\nAnker\u2019s Soundcore AI Voice Recorder will remind you of the Plaud NotePin AI voice transcription device for more than one reason. It\u2019s a coin-sized clip-on wearable that will listen to everything you say, or anything anybody says to you, and then transcribe and summarize it in an app. The pin is smaller than Plaud\u2019s NotePin, though that may just make it easier to misplace when it\u2019s not kept on the charging unit. \u2014Kyle Barr\nCue the Rocky Theme Music\nFinally, our robovacs are finding ways to tackle the most daunting impediments to full-house cleaning: dreaded stairs. Anker\u2019s Eufy MarsWalker is essentially a robot suit for another eufy cleaning robot built with four fold-out paddles on the exterior of each of its wheels. After achieving the right angle, the robot-robot exoskeleton can then ascend relatively steep stairs.\nThe MarsWalker currently supports Eufy\u2019s new Robot Vacuum Omni S2. It promises to give you a deep clean of your rugs to remove all the excess dirt and pet hair. It lifts up to 5 centimeters to attack thick carpets. The roving vacuum also includes a mop function using Anker\u2019s new HydroJet technology to scrub away stains on hard floors. The Omni S2 should be available sometime in January in the U.S. MarsWalker is a real product, which should arrive sometime in the first half of 2026. \u2014Kyle Barr\nPrint That Artwork On Anything\nAnker\u2019s eufyMake E1 UV Printer has been one of my most-anticipated gadgets since I saw it last year. It uses UV-activated ink to print on practically any surface, not just paper or canvas. What\u2019s even neater is how it can print in \u201c3D\u201d by applying multiple layers of ink to create a kind of effect akin to an oil painting. Now, finally, regular consumers should be able to get one if you missed the Kickstarter. The printer should be available starting in December at a starting price of $2,500. \u2014Kyle Barr\nAmazon\u2019s New Dongle\nAmazon-owned Eero has a dongle to sell you if you\u2019re an Eero customer. Called the Eero Signal, the dongle is a USB-C splitter that connects to an Eero router and lets you back up your Eero network over cellular data. In other words, it\u2019s handy for when you have an internet outage. Our freelancer and smart home expert, Wes Davis, has the details on the Eero Signal below. \u2014Raymond Wong\nWired Earbuds Are Back, Baby\nWired earbuds are back big-time, and Sony knows it. Introducing: the IER-EX15C, a pair of \u201cin-ear headphones,\u201d which come equipped with a wired USB-C connection. These wired earbuds are only $29.99 and give me flashbacks to the days of Apple\u2019s wired EarPods with a Lightning port.\nAll I can remember about the days of wired audio is having to constantly untangle my headphones before I listened to them, but Sony says its latest entry have a \u201cserrated design\u201d that\u2019s meant to prevent that. One great thing about wired earbuds like this is that they at least usually have a great mic and solid sound. I\u2019m still not ready to go back to 2012, but if that\u2019s your thing, you clearly have some new options. \u2014James Pero\nParty On, Samsung\nParty speakers seem to be a big thing this year at IFA, with entrants from JBL, Marshall, and now, Samsung. Samsung\u2019s new Sound Tower speaker has a revamped acoustic design over the last generation and comes in two variants. The top-of-the-line version has 18 hours of battery life and the biggest tweeters and woofers for a robust karaoke sound that will make your neighbors wish they\u2019d never been born. \u2014James Pero\nNo AirPods Left Behind\nNotable among the sea of accessories announcing at IFA 2025 this week is this Mophie Headphones Charging Stand. It\u2019s $150, which is kinda pricey, but it does have silicone cups and a magnetic USB-C dongle for quickly dropping AirPods Max into them for a charge. The aluminum base also has a Qi wireless charger for juicing up any AirPods or AirPods Pro, or non-Apple wireless earbuds that support wireless charging.\nMophie created the ultimate AirPods charging stand that Apple should have. \u2014Raymond Wong\nThe Polar Opposite Approach to Subcriptions\nPeople love Whoop\u2019s screenless fitness bands, but one thing they don\u2019t love is paying subscriptions forever and ever. Luckily, Polar and its new Polar Loop is here for anyone who isn\u2019t okay with adding another subscription to their life. The Polar Loop does all the same stuff as Whoop\u2019s band, too, including heart rate tracking, sleep monitoring, and step counting. Sorry, Whoop, maybe it\u2019s time to soften your stance on recurring fees. \u2014James Pero\nKickin\u2019 It With Acer\u2019s Kickstand-Equipped Tablets\nAcer announced a truckload of tablets at IFA 2025. There\u2019s the $320 Iconia X12 and $350 X14, and the $300 Iconia A14 and $340 A16. I haven\u2019t any clue whether these are good tablets or not. I do know that all of them except for the Iconia X12 have kickstands. I like kickstands on my gadgets. The 12-inch Surface Pro and the Nintendo Switch 2 have very nice kickstands. But the ones on these new Acer Iconia tablets? They look more like the gumstick one on the original Nintendo Switch, though they\u2019re longer and hopefully made of more durable material. \u2014Raymond Wong\nThe Iconia A16 (left) and Iconia X14 (right) also have kickstands!\nNo kickstand on the below Iconia X12:\nUgh, Now I Need a Tape-Playing Boombox\nI love ogling gadgets, but I hate when they actually make me want to spend money. The latest source of that frustration comes courtesy of We Are Rewind, which just announced its GB-001, a next-gen boombox that plays cassettes, looks cool, and still has all the modern trappings of wireless audio devices like Bluetooth and hi-fi sound. It even has analog needles for volume and recording levels. Check out my post for the full details. I don\u2019t need this boombox, but damn do I want it. \u2014James Pero\nFor People on the Move\nreMarkable\u2019s smaller e-paper device is official, and it\u2019s called the Paper Pro Move. Get it? For people on the move who need to jot stuff down but won\u2019t do that if they need to pull out a big iPad or Paper Pro from their backpack.\nThe Paper Pro Move starts at $449 with an included Marker stylus and features a 7.3-inch color E Ink display and 64GB of internal storage. Battery life is up to two weeks, according to reMarkable.\nI\u2019ll have a full review in the coming days, but for now, here\u2019s my first impressions (including thoughts on the handwriting-to-text recognition) of the device after using it for a few days:\n\u2014Raymond Wong\nNvidia\u2019s New AI Magic Trick\nNvidia has a whole new pipeline it claims will allow anybody to create 3D objects using AI. The company\u2019s 3D object generator blueprint can generate up to 20 objects based on a single prompt. Nvidia claims the tool takes into account the theme of the project you\u2019re working on and then creates 2D images that act as previews for the potential generated 3D model. You can then export those models to most 3D applications, such as Blender.\nNvidia suggested these tools aren\u2019t built to replace 3D modelers but allow them to more easily prototype a scene or rendering with \u201clow-fidelity assets.\u201d I\u2019ve seen Adobe\u2019s AI 3D modeling suite in action going back to 2024. Those objects were not what anybody would consider high-quality. Still, if you\u2019re growing tired of the number of AI-generated 2D images flooding online art repositories, which formerly featured human-created work, we may soon find 3D model sites filling up with even more prompt-created slop.\nYou could consider Nvidia\u2019s big contribution to this year\u2019s IFA its GB10 Blackwell Superchip\u2014an AI-centric version of its latest GPU microarchitecture fueling new devices like Acer\u2019s Veriton GN100 AI Mini Workstation. It may look like a mini PC, but it\u2019s a computer specifically built to test large language models or other generative AI locally, rather than relying on cloud-based processing. Nvidia has its own similar device, the DGX Sparx, that the company teased back at CES and is currently up for reservation. Acer said its Veriton will be available to North American customers for $4,000 a pop. \u2014Kyle Barr\nHow Big Do You Like Your Screens?\nAcer\u2019s Nitro XZ403CKR is one of those monitors that makes you wonder if 5K will become more mainstream outside of creator circles. It\u2019s a 39.7-inch curved ultrawide IPS LCD display with the notorious 5K2K spec, or 5,120 x 2,160 resolution. The best part is the monitor can still hit 180Hz refresh rates at 5K. At the wide FHD resolution\u2014equivalent to 1080p\u2014you could expect 288Hz. The refresh rate may not be blisteringly fast compared to some gaming displays, but it\u2019s more than enough for most players looking to play their games at 4K at high frame rates. Acer says the XZ403CKR will be available sometime early next year with a starting price of $1,000. \u2014Kyle Barr\nThe \u2018Predator Notebook\u2019 Wants to Be the Working Nerd\u2019s Favorite Laptop\nAcer\u2019s Predator Helios 18P AI looks like many of the company\u2019s previous big and thick gaming laptops. Let me halt your yawn, because there\u2019s a twist. The device has the kind of specs and security software you expect from a big workstation laptop, but it will still bloom with heavy RGB lights under the keyboard. It\u2019s the real mullet of gaming laptops, a \u201cbusiness in the front, party in the back\u201d situation. \u2014Kyle Barr\nWell, Now There\u2019s at Least One Intel Panther Lake Device Confirmed\nIntel hasn\u2019t exactly been quiet talking about its next generation of mobile chips, dubbed Panther Lake. While we\u2019re waiting for more official specs to tell us if this is the start to the beleaguered chipmaker\u2019s redemption arc, Acer mentioned it\u2019s working on an upcoming Swift 16 AI laptop that should have the chip inside. This CPU should provide better gaming performance\u2014something that leaks suggest will be a major selling point for both small and thin laptops and maybe even handhelds. Otherwise, everything is centered on AI, AI, and AI. If you could not begin to care about on-device AI processing, the Swift 16 has an extra-large trackpad with stylus support, kind of like the company\u2019s Triton 14 AI. \u2014Kyle Barr\nAcer CEO Jason Chen Rides the 15 Feet to the Stage on a Scooter\nI\u2019m not sure why tech companies have to show they\u2019re always using tech, even if it\u2019s to move the 15 feet to start presenting its refreshed laptops. Acer CEO Jason Chen took one of the company\u2019s Predator e-scooters to the center of the stage to talk about its sustainability goals. I\u2019m not here to dive into the company\u2019s stated green goals and how the impact of global supply chains on climate change may conflict with that. At least the scooter wasn\u2019t running, because that would have been a waste of electricity.\nIf you\u2019re awake right now, you can watch along with me here. The actual hardware is still incoming. First up are Chromebooks. \u201cThe most advanced Chromebook\u201d from Acer, the Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514, features the MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip last seen in the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14. That processor is noticeably extra for ChromeOS, but that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. It\u2019s a convertible too, so it\u2019ll act as a tablet with an optional 2.8K OLED display. \u2014Kyle Barr\nEdit: For those of you who want a closer look at Acer\u2019s new $699 Chromebook, here it is. Here\u2019s a reminder: you don\u2019t need to stick with ChromeOS. If you\u2019re considering the open-source operating system Linux, the Chromebook Plus Spin could offer solid bang for your buck.\nAcer\u2019s Doing Acer Things\nI\u2019m here at Acer\u2019s press conference, and the PC maker is playing the music way too loud at the City Cube Innovation Stage in the Messe Berlin convention center. I have an idea of what to expect, though it may be hard to top last year\u2019s conference. In 2024, the company debuted several cool concept devices, like its deranged Dual Play gaming laptop with a controller built into the trackpad. There were other small-form gaming laptops and interesting devices like hot-swappable desktop PC SSDs. I\u2019d love more crazy gadgets, but I have a feeling this year\u2019s devices will be more humdrum. Just give me a surprise, please. Or better yet, tell me when you\u2019re finally going to launch your Acer Nitro Blaze and Blaze 11 handhelds. \u2014Kyle Barr\nIf Don Draper Went Dolby Atmos\nMarshall is back with another soundbar, and, as usual, it\u2019s leaning on some appealing mid-century design. The Heston 60 is more compact than its predecessor and maybe not as powerful, but who really cares when you\u2019ve got this smooth \u201970s cream color? Read my post below for the full details. \u2014James Pero\nGet Your Ice-Cold JBL Speaker Here\nSummer might be coming to a close, but that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have time to double-fist a beer and JBL\u2019s new Bluetooth speaker. According to JBL, its new Grip speaker is inspired by a can of seltzer. I personally think of an ice-cold beer (tallboy) when I see it, but that\u2019s just me.\nIn keeping with the seltzer inspiration, this speaker is IP68 rated, so it won\u2019t get damaged by water easily. They also come in quite a few fun colors (purple is my favorite) and have a programmable light on the back panel. The main thing with the Grip is that it\u2019s portable, so it has a loop attached that you can hook a rope through to carry on your bike or backpack, but I request that you please bike responsibly. For all the details, you can read my post below. \u2014James Pero\nEven HDR Can\u2019t Escape AI\nSome 10 years after Dolby Vision first came out to bring HDR to the masses, the audio and visual technology company is advancing things forward with *drum roll* Vision 2. And the crowd goes wild!\nHard to tell (no pun intended) whether or not Dolby Vision 2 actually brings anything noticeable to the naked eye. I mean, how many colors can you actually discern? I dunno about you, but my sight is only getting worse with age, and so too is their ability to see more shades. Who has the \u201cgolden eyes\u201d (coining this term as the visual version of \u201cgolden ears\u201d for audio) to appreciate Vision 2 to its fullest?\nOur Senior Reporter James Pero has the breakdown on what\u2019s new in Vision 2 here:\nIt mostly boils down to \u201cContent Intelligence\u201d which is jargon for using AI to adjust picture quality based on what you\u2019re watching and where you\u2019re watching. Yes, really! Then, there\u2019s also Vision 2 Max. Again, yes, really! Go read about\u2026 if you\u2019re an HDR enthusiast looking for a reason to buy a new TV with Dolby Vision 2. Or just wait for Vision 2 to come to inevitably come to an iPhone or something. \u2014Raymond Wong\nBegun, the Thin Phone War Has\nIf you\u2019re in the market for a super skinny phone that doesn\u2019t have battery compromises, you probably shouldn\u2019t get Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 Edge or Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 Air, which will be announced at Apple\u2019s \u201cAwe dropping\u201d event next week on Sept. 9. You might want to look into the Tecno POVA Slim, which is reportedly 5.95mm thin and has a 5,160mAh battery, according to tech reviewer Ben Sin.\nThe Tecno POVA Slim, launching at IFA, measures only 5.95mm but with a 5160 mAh battery. That's crucial because I don't see what's so impressive about a \"thin phone\" if the battery shrunk down. And yes I will keep this energy in September 9 pic.twitter.com/pOBsYdnX6o\n\u2014 ben sin (@bencsin) August 28, 2025\nSin shared a few images of the thin phone on X, and as you can see, it appears to have two cameras (one more than the iPhone 17 Air), but also a signature feature that Samsung ditched years ago: curved glass edges. Anything to make the phone look and feel even thinner in the hand, amirite? \u2014Raymond Wong\nA Little Light on Philips Hue at IFA\nSmart light brands Philips Hue has a few announcements planned for the next few days. Last month, the lighting fanatics over at HueBlog were keeping track of several upcoming products the company self-leaked on its own website. These include several more products for the Hue Secure line, including a long-rumored smart doorbell. Philips Hue is also reportedly planning all-new Festavia lights that look like a more permanent garland feature with a few spotlights. There are several more smart bulbs coming down the pike as well.\nThe big news may be a Hue Bridge Pro. This is a device that allows Hue devices to connect with the Matter smart home standard, which allows interoperability between several different brands. Philips Hue does not support Matter natively, as it normally only works over Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or Thread. The latter is a low-power Wi-Fi-like connection between devices that lets them communicate. According to HueBlog, Philips Hue isn\u2019t abandoning its love affair with Wi-Fi and Zigbee\u2014a separate communication protocol. However, it may be introducing some kind of radio chip that could support Thread into its latest products without having to rely on the Hue Bridge Pro. We\u2019ll know more in the coming days. Philips Hue is holding a large announcement soiree on Sept. 3. \u2014Kyle Barr\nWhat\u2019s in My Pack: IFA 2025 Edition\nI\u2019ll be in Berlin in just a few days. Already, my thoughts are burned with the memory of the Messe Berlin convention center and its utterly nonsensical layout. If you\u2019ve never had to meander those labyrinthine halls, where one can lose their sanity as fast as they lose their way, then my advice is to travel light. I\u2019m stuffing my Patagonia 55L Black Hole duffel with my usual essentials plus everything I\u2019ll need for quick capture and content creation. I\u2019m still testing the Insta360 Go Ultra, which will be especially useful for POV shots as I eat my hundredth bratwurst (and possibly shoot some wacky gadgets). Alongside a DJI Osmo Mobile 6 and a simple USB-C lavalier mic, I\u2019m packing my ancient Nikon D3400 DSLR. It\u2019s light, foolproof, and does the job. I don\u2019t have to worry much if I damage or lose it.\nFor moving between nations with different outlet dimensions, I rely on my Anker Nano Travel Adapter. My 14-inch MacBook Pro 14 with M4 will keep me company as I write these blogs, but of course you probably spotted my Nintendo Switch 2. It\u2019s sporting vinyl stickers from Dbrand as well as the company\u2019s KillSwitch case grips. I\u2019m still making use of Dbrand\u2019s travel cover, but I\u2019ve since replaced the main case with Genki\u2019s Attack Vector. That shell includes a MagSafe attachment point that lets me hook up an external battery for when the handheld inevitably dies on the plane. We\u2019ll find out if I\u2019ll have any time to relax to play it or read more of Micaiah Johnson\u2019s Those Beyond the Wall. \u2014Kyle Barr\nWhat\u2019s DJI Bringing to IFA?\nDJI, the company you likely most associate with drones, has a few new products on its plate that have little to do with UAVs. We expect the China-based company to offer us a look at its new $220 Mic 3. This is a compact wireless microphone setup that\u2019s best described as a cross between the company\u2019s Mic mini and Mic 2. Each of the pack\u2019s two mics weighs in at just 16 grams\u2014half that of the DJI Mic 2\u2014though you can still adjust the transmitter\u2019s orientation. It can now support up to four transmitters and eight receivers at once, in case you want to capture an entire podcast debate that hopefully won\u2019t go viral for all the wrong reasons. In addition, new leaks suggest DJI is planning on producing a new action camera with a magnetic lens pod \u00e0 la the Insta360 Go 3S.\n\ud83d\udc49Here is our little Osmo Nano, which is set to compete with Go Ultra.\n\u2705Built-in memory 64 GB / 128 GB\n\u2705OLED touchscreen for one-handed control.\n\u2705Charges from the module to 80% in just 20 minutes.\n\u2705SD card slot\n\u2705Magnetic body for mounting anywhere#osmonano pic.twitter.com/12tvl5ZMDf\u2014 Igor Bogdanov (@Quadro_News) August 28, 2025\nWe\u2019ll have to wait and see what actually shows up at the DJI IFA booth come Sept. 5. \u2014Kyle Barr\nreMarkably Mini?\nreMarkable\u2019s e-paper tablets have gained something of a cult following. People who use them love them to death. It\u2019s not hard to see why\u2014writing on the slim displays is closer to pen and paper than an iPad and Apple Pencil.\nThe company has started teasing \u201csomething\u201d that\u2019s \u201con the move.\u201d Speculation is that it\u2019ll be a mini version of the Paper Pro. It better have a color e-paper display or else. \u2014Raymond Wong\nSamsung Teases New Galaxy Tab\nSamsung is doing its own virtual Unpacked event on Sept. 4 to announce a new Galaxy Tab. Most likely refreshed versions of the Galaxy Tab S10+ and Tab S10 Ultra. Anybody wanna take bets on the name? I\u2019m going with Galaxy Tab S11+ and Tab S11 Ultra.\nAs for what to expect from the tablets. Well, they\u2019ll run Android and likely with Samsung\u2019s own One UI 8 interface. More Galaxy AI features are a safe bet. Ditto for Google Gemini integration. AI, AI, AI\u2014you know?\nThe Tab S10 Ultra had a gargantuan 14.6-inch display. I say go bigger or go home. Give us a 16- or 18-inch tablet that dwarfs even the biggest 12.9-inch M4 iPad Pro. Why the hell not? \u2014Raymond Wong"

Apple enthusiast Parker Ortolani also made some astute observations. \u201cIf you wanna try to read the tea leaves, infrared is used for non-invasive blood pressure and glucose monitoring\u2026.,\u201d Ortolani wrote on X. He also added, \u201cCool AIR appears as dark blue on infrared.\u201d Might Apple be alluding to the light blue iPhone 17 Air that leaked a few weeks ago?\nExpected Product Announcements\nApple\u2019s annual fall event, which will once again be held at Apple Park in Cupertino, CA, will also be where the company is expected to announce new Apple Watches (Series 11 and Ultra 3), new AirPods (Pro 3?), and a slew of new features for all of the new devices. If it\u2019s like past years, Tim Cook and pals should also give us release dates for when we can officially install the non-beta releases for Liquid Glass. That includes iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 Tahoe, watchOS 26, and tvOS 26.\nThere\u2019s gonna be a truckload of Apple announcements on Sept. 9. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are rumored to get even thicker with the biggest camera bump (housing a new 48-megapixel telephoto camera) that Apple has ever put into an iPhone. We may also see a new orange color for the iPhone 17 Pros. The iPhone 16 Plus will almost certainly die this year, and its replacement will likely be the \u201ciPhone 17 Air,\u201d a new, super-thin glass slab with a single camera and possibly reduced battery life due to its skinny frame.\nOn the accessories and wearables front, we\u2019re anticipating modest updates to the Apple Watch Series 10, maybe a bigger screen (but not a bigger case) for the Apple Watch Ultra 3, and we could see live translations rolled out to AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4 with or without a new AirPods Pro 3 announcement.\nGizmodo Live Blog\nThe leaks have been steady, and many of them have come from reputable sources with solid track records. But you know what they say, nothing is official until it comes straight from the horse\u2019s mouth. So clear your calendar and maybe sell a kidney now (please don\u2019t do that!) cause Apple\u2019s fall gadget bonanza is only a few weeks away.\nThe only thing for certain that you can count on happening on Sept. 9 is a live blog. Just like we did with last week\u2019s \u201cMade by Google\u201d event for Pixel 10, Samsung\u2019s Unpacked for the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7, and Apple\u2019s WWDC and Google\u2019s I/O developer conferences this past summer, we\u2019ll be live-blogging the Apple Event.\nApple will be streaming its event on its website at Apple.com and YouTube here, but I promise Gizmodo\u2019s live blog will be more entertaining. It\u2019s also the only place where I\u2019ll reveal the breakfast spread that Apple\u2019s gonna serve to the media. That\u2019s important stuff!"

  "argos_summary": "Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S25 FE, a $650 fan\u2011edition variant of its flagship S25 line, featuring a 6.7\u2011inch FHD+ display, 120Hz refresh, and 4,900mAh battery but with a less powerful Exynos 2400 chipset, 8GB RAM, and reduced camera specs compared to the S25 and S25+. The FE drops the price by $350 relative to the S25+ and $150 compared to the standard S25, targeting budget\u2011conscious buyers who want flagship features without the premium cost. It retains wireless charging, 45W wired charging, and most of the main camera array, while trimming the telephoto sensor and cutting the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite. The launch, announced at IFA 2025, positions the FE as a cost\u2011effective alternative for consumers looking for a high\u2011end smartphone experience at a lower price point.",
