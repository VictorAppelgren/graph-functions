  "description": "Behavioral data helps us understand what drives users to a search, where they carry it out, and what points of friction might be blocking conversion.",
  "content": "We\u2019re more than halfway through 2025, and SEO has already changed names many times to take into account the new mission of optimizing for the rise of large language models (LLMs): We\u2019ve seen GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) floating around, AEO (Answer Engine Optimization), and even LEO (LLM Engine Optimization) has made an apparition in industry conversations and job titles.\n\nHowever, while we are all busy finding new nomenclatures to factor in the machine part of the discovery journey, there is someone else in the equation that we risk forgetting about: the end beneficiary of our efforts, the user.\n\nWhy Do You Need Behavioral Data In Search?\n\nBehavioral data is vital to understand what leads a user to a search journey, where they carry it out, and what potential points of friction might be blocking a conversion action, so that we can better cater to their needs.\n\nAnd if we learned anything from the documents leaked from the Google trial, it is that users\u2019 signals might actually be one of the many factors that influence rankings, something that was never fully confirmed by the company\u2019s spokespeople, but that\u2019s also been uncovered by Mark Wiliams Cook in his analysis of Google exploits and patents.\n\nWith search becoming more and more personalized, and data about users becoming less transparent now that simple search queries are expanding into full funnel conversations on LLMs, it\u2019s important to remember that \u2013 while individual needs and experiences might be harder to isolate and cater for \u2013 general patterns of behavior tend to stick across the same population, and we can use some rules of thumb to get the basics right.\n\nHumans often operate on a few basic principles aimed at preserving energy and resources, even in search:\n\u2022 Minimizing effort: following the path of least resistance.\n\u2022 Maximizing gain: seeking opportunities that present the highest benefit or rewards.\n\nSo while Google and other search channels might change the way we think about our daily job, the secret weapon we can use to future-proof our brands\u2019 organic presence is to isolate some data about behavior, as it is, generally, much more predictable than algorithm changes.\n\nWhat Behavioral Data Do You Need To Improve Search Journeys?\n\nI would narrow it down to data that cover three main areas: discovery channel indicators, built-in mental shortcuts, and underlying users\u2019 needs.\n\nThe days of starting a search on Google are long gone.\n\nAccording to the Messy Middle research by Google, the exponential increase in information and new channels available has determined a shift from linear search behaviors to a loop of exploration and evaluation guiding our purchase decisions.\n\nAnd since users now have an overwhelming amount of channels, they can consult in order to research a product or a brand. It\u2019s also harder to cut through the noise, so by knowing more about them, we can make sure our strategy is laser-focused across content and format alike.\n\u2022 How users are finding us beyond traditional search channels.\n\u2022 The demographic that we reach on some particular channels.\n\u2022 What drives their search, and what they are mostly engaging with.\n\u2022 The content and format that are best suited to capture and retain their attention in each one.\n\nFor example, we know that TikTok tends to be consulted for inspiration and to validate experiences through user-generated content (UGC), and that Gen Z and Millennials on social apps are increasingly skeptical of traditional ads (with skipping rates of 99%, according to a report by Bulbshare). What they favor instead is authentic voices, so they will seek out first-hand experiences on online communities like Reddit.\n\nKnowing the different channels that users reach us through can inform organic and paid search strategy, while also giving us some data on audience demographics, helping us capture users that would otherwise be elusive.\n\nSo, make sure your channel data is mapped to reflect these new discovery channels at hand, especially if you are relying on custom analytics. Not only will this ensure that you are rightfully attributed what you are owed for organic, but it will also be an indication of untapped potential you can lean into, as searches become less and less trackable.\n\nThis data should be easily available to you via the referral and source fields in your analytics platform of choice, and you can also integrate a \u201cHow did you hear about us\u201d survey for users who complete a transaction.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget about language models: With the recent rise in queries that start a search and complete an action directly on LLMs, it\u2019s even harder to track all search journeys. This replaces our mission to be relevant for one specific query at a time, to be visible for every intent we can cover.\n\nThis is even more important when we realize that everything contributes to the transactional power of a query, irrespective of how the search intent is traditionally labelled, since someone might decide to evaluate our offers and then drop out due to the lack of sufficient information about the brand.\n\nThe human brain is an incredible organ that allows us to perform several tasks efficiently every day, but its cognitive resources are not infinite.\n\nThis means that when we are carrying out a search, probably one of many of the day, while we are also engaged in other tasks, we can\u2019t allocate all of our energy into finding the most perfect result among the infinite possibilities available. That\u2019s why our attentional and decisional processes are often modulated by built-in mental shortcuts like cognitive biases and heuristics.\n\nThese terms are sometimes used interchangeably to refer to imperfect, yet efficient decisions, but there is a difference between the two.\n\nCognitive biases are systematic, mostly unconscious errors in thinking that affect the way we perceive the world around us and form judgments. They can distort the objective reality of an experience, and the way we are persuaded into an action.\n\nOne common example of this is the serial position effect, which is made up of two biases: When we see an array of items in a list, we tend to remember best the ones we see first (primacy bias) and last (recency bias). And since cognitive load is a real threat to attention, especially now that we live in the age of 24/7 stimuli, primacy and recency biases are the reason why it\u2019s recommended to lead with the core message, product, or item if there are a lot of options or content on the page.\n\nPrimacy and recency not only affect recall in a list, but also determine the elements that we use as a reference to compare all of the alternative options against. This is another effect called anchoring bias, and it is leveraged in UX design to assign a baseline value to the first item we see, so that anything we compare against it can either be perceived as a better or worse deal, depending on the goal of the merchant.\n\nAmong many others, some of the most common biases are:\n\u2022 Distance and size effects: As numbers increase in magnitude, it becomes harder for humans to make accurate judgments, reason why some tactics recommend using bigger digits in savings rather than fractions of the same value.\n\u2022 Negativity bias: We tend to remember and assign more emotional value to negative experiences rather than positive ones, which is why removing friction at any stage is so important to prevent abandonment.\n\u2022 Confirmation bias: We tend to seek out and prefer information that confirms our existing beliefs, and this is not only how LLMs operate to provide answers to a query, but it can be a window into the information gaps we might need to cover.\n\nHeuristics, on the other hand, are rules of thumb that we employ as shortcuts at any stage of decision-making, and help us reach a good outcome without going through the hassle of analyzing every potential ramification of a choice.\n\nA known heuristic is the familiarity heuristic, which is when we choose a brand or a product that we already know, because it cuts down on every other intermediate evaluation we would otherwise have to make with an unknown alternative.\n\nLoss aversion is another common heuristic, showing that on average we are more likely to choose the least risky option among two with similar returns, even if this means we might miss out on a discount or a short-term benefit. An example of loss aversion is when we choose to protect our travels for an added fee, or prefer products that we can return.\n\nThere are more than 150 biases and heuristics, so this is not an exhaustive list \u2013 but in general, getting familiar with which ones are most common among our users helps us smooth out the journey for them.\n\nBelow, you can see how some queries can already reveal subtle biases that might be driving the search task.\n\nYou can use Regex to isolate some of these patterns and modifiers directly in Google Search Console, or you can explore other query tools like AlsoAsked.\n\nIf you\u2019re working with large datasets, I recommend using a custom LLM or creating your own model for classifications and clustering based on these rules, so it becomes easier to spot a trend in the queries and figure out priorities.\n\nThese observations will also give you a window into the next big area.\n\nWhile biases and heuristics can manifest a temporary need in a specific task, one of the most beneficial aspects that behavioral data can give us is the need that drives the starting query and guides all of the subsequent actions.\n\nUnderlying needs don\u2019t only become apparent from clusters of queries, but from the channels used in the discovery and evaluation loop, too.\n\nFor example, if we see high prominence of loss aversion based on our queries, paired with low conversion rates and high traffic on UGC videos for our product or brand, we can infer that:\n\u2022 Users need reassurance on their investment.\n\u2022 There is not enough information to cover this need on our website alone.\n\nTrust is a big decision-mover, and one of the most underrated needs that brands often fail to fulfill as they take their legitimacy for granted.\n\nHowever, sometimes we need to take a step back and put ourselves in the users\u2019 shoes in order to see everything with fresh eyes from their perspective.\n\nBy mapping biases and heuristics to specific users\u2019 needs, we can plan for cross-functional initiatives that span beyond pure SEO and are beneficial for the entire journey from search to conversion and retention.\n\nHow Do You Obtain Behavioral Data For Actionable Insights?\n\nIn SEO, we are used to dealing with a lot of quantitative data to figure out what\u2019s happening on our channel. However, there is much more we can uncover via qualitative measures that can help us identify the reason something might be happening.\n\nQuantitative data is anything that can be expressed in numbers: This can be time on page, sessions, abandonment rate, average order value, and so on.\n\nTools that can help us extract quantitative behavioral data are:\n\u2022 Google Search Console & Google Merchant Center: Great for high-level data like click-through rates (CTRs), which can flag mismatches between the user intent and the page or campaign served, as well as cannibalization instances and incorrect or missing localization.\n\u2022 Google Analytics, or any custom analytics platform your brand relies on: These give us information on engagement metrics, and can pinpoint issues in the natural flow of the journey, as well as point of abandonment. My suggestion is to set up custom events tailored to your specific goals, in addition to the default engagement metrics, like sign-up form clicks or add to cart.\n\u2022 Heatmaps and eye-tracking data: Both of these can give us valuable insights into visual hierarchy and attention patterns on the website. Heatmapping tools like Microsoft Clarity can show us clicks, mouse scrolls, and position data, uncovering not only areas that might not be getting enough attention, but also elements that don\u2019t actually work. Eye-tracking data (fixation duration and count, saccades, and scan-paths) integrate that information by showing what elements are capturing visual attention, as well as which ones are often not being seen at all.\n\nQualitative data, on the other hand, cannot be expressed in numbers as it usually relies on observations. Examples include interviews, heuristic assessments, and live session recordings. This type of research is generally more open to interpretation than its quantitative counterpart, but it\u2019s vital to make sure we have the full picture of the user journey.\n\nQualitative data for search can be extracted from:\n\u2022 Surveys and CX logs: These can uncover common frustrations and points of friction for returning users and customers, which can guide better messaging and new page opportunities.\n\u2022 Scrapes of Reddit, Trustpilot, and online communities conversations: These give us a similar output as surveys, but expand the analysis of blockers to conversion to users that we haven\u2019t acquired yet.\n\u2022 Live user testing: The least scalable but sometimes most rewarding option, as it can cut down all the inference on quantitative data, especially when they are combined (for example, live sessions can be combined with eye-tracking and narrated by the user at a later stage via Retrospective Think-Aloud or RTA).\n\nIn the past year, our industry has been really good at two things: sensationalizing AI as the enemy that will replace us, and highlighting its big failures on the other end. And while it\u2019s undeniable that there are still massive limitations, having access to AI presents unprecedented benefits as well:\n\u2022 We can use AI to easily tie up big behavioral datasets and uncover actionables that make the difference.\n\u2022 Even when we don\u2019t have much data, we can train our own synthetic dataset based on a sample of ours or a public one, to spot existing patterns and promptly respond to users\u2019 needs.\n\u2022 We can generate predictions that can be used proactively for new initiatives to keep us ahead of the curve.\n\nHow Do You Leverage Behavioral Data To Improve Search Journeys?\n\nStart by creating a series of dynamic dashboards with the measures you can obtain for each one of the three areas we talked about (discovery channel indicators, built-in mental shortcuts, and underlying users\u2019 needs). These will allow you to promptly spot behavioral trends and collect actions that can make the journey smoother for the user at every step, since search now spans beyond the clicks on site.\n\nOnce you get new insights for each area, prioritize your actions based on expected business impact and effort to implement.\n\nAnd bear in mind that behavioral insights are often transferable to more than one section of the website or the business, which can maximize returns across several channels.\n\nLastly, set up regular conversations with your product and UX teams. Even if your job title keeps you in search, business success is often channel-agnostic. This means that we shouldn\u2019t only treat the symptom (e.g., low traffic to a page), but curate the entire journey, and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t want to work in silos on our little search island.\n\nYour users will thank you.

      "text": "As brands compete for market share across a whole range of AI platforms, each with its own way of presenting information, brands are on red alert.\nThe three pillars of presence, perception, and performance that I discuss in this article may help marketers navigate new times. This is especially true as search and AI undergo their biggest make-over ever.\nWhat\u2019s driving this change?\nAI isn\u2019t just retrieving information anymore \u2013 it\u2019s actively evaluating, framing, and recommending brands before prospects even click a link.\nIt\u2019s happening now, and it\u2019s accelerating.\nThink about it. Today, in many ways, ChatGPT has become just as synonymous with AI as Google was when it launched core search.\nMore and more users and marketers are experimenting with and utilizing Google AIO, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and more.\nAccording to a recent BrightEdge survey, over 53% of marketers regularly use multiple (two or more) AI search platforms weekly.\nAI Is Reshaping How Brands Are Presented And Perceived\nConsider how buyers research options today: In Google AIO, a traveler planning a Barcelona vacation once needed dozens of separate searches, each representing an opportunity for visibility.\nNow? They ask one question to an AI assistant and receive a complete itinerary, compressing what 50 touchpoints once took into a single interaction.\nAI is no longer a passive search engine. It\u2019s an active evaluator, interpreting intent, forming opinions, and determining which brands deserve attention.\nIn enterprise SEO and B2B contexts, the shift is even more pronounced. AI is effectively writing the request for proposal (RFP), establishing evaluation criteria, and creating shortlists without brands having direct input.\nTake enterprise software evaluation, for instance. When a CIO asks an AI about the \u201cbest enterprise resource planning solutions,\u201d the AI\u2019s response typically features:\n- A curated shortlist of vendors.\n- Evaluation criteria that the AI deems relevant.\n- Strengths and limitations of each solution.\n- Recommendations based on various scenarios.\nThese responses don\u2019t just inform decisions. They frame the entire evaluation process before a vendor\u2019s content is visited.\nThe question isn\u2019t whether this transformation is happening. It\u2019s whether your brand is prepared for it.\nRead more: 5 Key Enterprise SEO And AI Trends For 2025\nThe Triple-P Framework For AI Search Success\nAfter analyzing thousands of AI search responses using our BrightEdge Generative Parser\u2122, I\u2019ve developed the Triple-P framework (Presence, Perception, and Performance) as a strategic compass for navigating this new landscape.\nLet\u2019s break down each component.\nPresence: Beyond Traditional Rankings\nWhile Google still commands 89.71% of search market share, the ecosystem is diversifying rapidly:\n- ChatGPT: 19% monthly traffic growth.\n- Perplexity: 12% monthly traffic growth.\n- Claude: 166% monthly traffic surge.\n- Grok: 266% early-stage spike.\n(Source: BrightEdge Generative Parser\u2122 April 2025)\nOur research shows that the presence of AI Overviews has nearly doubled since June 2024, with comparison features growing by 70-90% and product visualization features by 45-50% in B2B sectors.\nFor enterprise marketers, Google is always your starting point. However, it\u2019s not just about ranking on Google anymore; it\u2019s about showing up wherever AI models showcase your brand.\nFor example, consider these industry-specific implications:\n- For CPG brands: When consumers ask about product sustainability, AI doesn\u2019t just list eco-friendly options; it evaluates authenticity based on consistent messaging across digital touchpoints.\n- For SaaS companies: Buyers researching integration capabilities receive AI-curated assessments that either position you as a compatibility leader or exclude you entirely.\n- For healthcare providers: Patient questions about treatment options trigger AI responses that cite the most authoritative content, not necessarily the highest-ranking websites.\nWe are in an era of compressed decision-making. Invisibility equals elimination.\nPerception: When AI Forms Opinions\nThe most revealing insight from our research is that only 31% of AI-generated brand mentions are positive; of those, just 20% include direct recommendations.\nThis is a wake-up call for all marketers, especially those managing a brand.\nEven when your brand appears in AI results, how it\u2019s framed varies dramatically depending on the AI model, training data, and interpretive logic.\nIn some AI engines, your brand may appear as the industry leader. In others, you may be completely absent.\nWhat The Data Shows:\n- Brands with strong pre-existing recognition receive more positive mentions in AI responses.\n- Consistent messaging across digital touchpoints makes brands more likely to be cited positively.\n- AI systems appear to \u201caverage\u201d brand signals across the web when forming perceptions.\nWhen we analyzed sentiment distribution (April 2025) in AI responses by industry, we saw significant variation, which you could group-match to verticals. For example:\n- Finance: Positive mentions aligned around good content on regulatory compliance and security.\n- Healthcare: Positive mentions aligned around good content with accuracy and credibility as key factors.\n- Retail: Positive mentions aligned around good customer experience and shopping.\n- Technology: Positive mentions aligned around content on innovation and reliability as primary criteria.\nThe implications are clear: Perception management is now as crucial as presence.\nHow does this play out in practice?\nWhen brands implement coordinated perception management strategies across multiple channels, they see improvements in AI sentiment within 60-90 days.\nPerformance: New Metrics That Matter\nThe final P (Performance) requires entirely new measurement approaches.\nWhen AI overviews appear in search results, click-through rates often drop by up to 50% according to internal BrightEdge data. Yet, conversion rates typically remain strong, suggesting AI qualifies leads before they reach your site.\nWe\u2019re entering an era where impressions will be high, click-through rates may drop, but conversions will increase.\nI explained at our recent quarterly briefing. AI filters options and delivers buyers who are closer to decisions.\nThe impact varies dramatically by query type:\n- Informational queries: Reduction in clicks, minimal conversion impact.\n- Navigational queries: Reduction in clicks, negligible conversion impact.\n- Commercial queries: Reduction in clicks, higher conversion rates.\n- Transactional queries: Reduction in clicks, higher conversion rates.\nThis pattern suggests AI is most effective at qualifying commercial intent, delivering more purchase-ready traffic.\nAnd impressions matter now \u2013 they are a new brand metric.\nFive Essential AI Search Metrics:\n- AI Presence Rate: Percentage of target queries where your brand appears in AI responses.\n- Citation Authority: How consistently you are cited as the primary source.\n- Share Of AI Conversation: Your semantic real estate in AI answers versus competitors.\n- Prompt Effectiveness: How well your content answers natural language prompts.\n- Response-To-Conversion Velocity: How quickly AI-influenced prospects convert. Brands with strong pre-existing recognition will receive more positive mentions in AI responses.\nPosition within AI responses matters as much as position in traditional SERPs once did.\nMonthly reporting cycles are becoming obsolete. AI-generated results can shift within hours, demanding real-time monitoring capabilities.\nThe DNA Of AI-Optimized Content\nIn my experience, content is more likely to be cited by AI with:\n- Comprehensive coverage: Content addressing multiple related questions outperforms narrow content.\n- Structured data implementation: Pages with robust schema markup see higher citation rates.\n- Expert validation: Content with clear expert authorship signals receives more citations.\n- Multi-format delivery: Topics presented in multiple formats (text, video, data visualizations) earn more citations.\n- First-party data inclusion: Original research and proprietary data increase citation likelihood.\nThese patterns suggest AI systems are increasingly sophisticated in their ability to identify genuinely authoritative content versus content merely optimized for traditional ranking factors.\nIn my last article, I discussed how Google AIO, ChatGPT, and Perplexity differ and where they share some common optimization traits.\nFive Actionable Strategies For Triple-P Success\nBased on our extensive research, here are five implementation strategies aligned with this framework:\n1. Adopt Entity-Based SEO\nAI prioritizes content from known, trusted entities. Stop optimizing for fragmented keywords and start building comprehensive topic authority.\nOur data shows that authoritative content is three times more likely to be cited in AI responses than narrowly focused pages.\nImplementation Steps:\n- Perform an entity audit: Identify how search engines currently understand your brand as an entity.\n- Develop topical maps: Create comprehensive coverage of core topics rather than isolated keywords\n- Implement entity-based schema: Use structured data to explicitly define your brand\u2019s relationship to key topics.\n- Build consistent entity references: Ensure name, address, and phone (NAP) consistency across all digital properties.\n- Cultivate authoritative connections: Earn mentions and links from recognized authorities in your space.\nEnterprise brands implementing entity-based SEO will see an uplift in AI citations.\n2. Implement Perception Management\nWith 69% of AI brand mentions not explicitly positive, you must actively shape sentiment.\nBrands that implement proactive sentiment management strategies will see success.\nImplementation Steps:\n- Monitor AI sentiment tracking: Establish baseline sentiment across AI platforms.\n- Identify perception gaps: Compare AI perceptions against desired brand positioning.\n- Address criticism proactively: Create content that honestly addresses common concerns.\n- Amplify authentic strengths: Develop evidence-based content highlighting genuine advantages.\n- Build consistent messaging: Align key messages across all digital touchpoints.\n3. Integrate Real-Time Citation Monitoring\nTracking AI citations regularly is now vital to improve mention rates.\nThis requires capability beyond traditional rank tracking or Google Search Console analysis.\nImplementation Steps:\n- Deploy continuous monitoring: Track AI responses for priority queries across platforms.\n- Implement competitor citation alerts: Get notified when competitors gain or lose citations.\n- Conduct prompt variation testing: Analyze how different user phrasings affect your brand\u2019s inclusion.\n- Track citation position: Monitor where within AI responses your brand appears.\n- Measure citation authority: Assess whether you\u2019re positioned as a primary or secondary source.\n4. Deploy Cross-Core Search And AI Platforms\nCompanies that take an integrated approach across traditional search and multiple AI platforms will see higher return on investment (ROI) on search investments.\nThe future belongs to unified measurement frameworks that connect traditional SEO metrics with emerging AI citation patterns.\nImplementation Steps:\n- Build unified dashboards: Integrate traditional search metrics with AI citation data.\n- Map keyword-to-prompt relationships: Connect traditional keywords to conversational AI prompts.\n- Analyze traffic source shifts: Track changing patterns between direct search and AI-referred traffic.\n- Segment by AI platform: Monitor performance variations across different AI search environments.\n- Connect to business outcomes: Tie AI presence metrics directly to conversion and revenue data.\n5. Use AI To Win At AI\nThis isn\u2019t theoretical. It\u2019s delivering measurable results:\n- BrightEdge Autopilot users averaged a 65% performance improvement.\n- BrightEdge Copilot users saved 1.2 million content research hours.\nThe brands succeeding most in AI search leverage AI in their workflows.\nImplementation Steps:\n- Automate content research: Use AI to identify comprehensive topic coverage opportunities.\n- Implement AI-driven schema markup: Systematically structure data for machine interpretation.\n- Deploy prompt effectiveness testing: Continuously test how well content answers real user prompts.\n- Create AI-optimized content briefs: Define exactly what comprehensive coverage means for each topic.\n- Analyze AI citation patterns: Identify what characteristics make competitor content citation-worthy.\nTeams using AI for AI optimization will benefit from higher productivity and improved performance to gain that must-have competitive edge in search and AI today.\nWhat\u2019s Coming Next: AI-To-AI Marketing\nLooking ahead to two to three years, expect AI to evolve from an information assistant to a trusted advisor that buyers rely on for evaluation, comparison, and vendor selection.\nWe\u2019re already seeing early indicators of AI-to-AI marketing, where procurement teams use AI agents to automate research and vendor vetting.\nEmerging Trends:\n- Digital twin marketplaces: Buyers will interact with simulated versions of B2B solutions before speaking with vendors\n- Vertical-specific AI companions: Industry-specialized models for cybersecurity, manufacturing, and healthcare.\n- AI agent purchasing: Autonomous systems are not just researching but also completing transactions on users\u2019 behalf.\n- Continuous entity validation: AI systems continuously monitor brand claims against real-world evidence.\n- Multi-modal search experiences: Voice, image, and text-based AI interactions requiring omnichannel optimization.\nRead more: As Chatbots And AI Search Engines Converge: Key Strategies For SEO\nThe Trust Premium In AI Search\nConsumers are always more likely to trust brands they already recognize.\n- AI functions as a trust bridge.\n- When consumers delegate decision-making to AI, pre-existing brand familiarity becomes disproportionately influential.\n- The impact is most pronounced in high-consideration purchases.\nThis creates both a challenge and an opportunity. Established brands must protect their advantage, while emerging brands must strategically build recognition signals detectable by AI.\nOrganizational Structure For AI Search Success\nLeading organizations are already creating \u201ccollaborative intelligence\u201d roles \u2013 specialists managing the interplay between human creativity and AI amplification.\nSuccessful teams typically include:\n- AI Search Strategists: Focus on overall presence, perception, and performance.\n- Prompt Engineers: Specialize in understanding how users phrase requests to AI.\n- Content Scientists: Develop evidence-based approaches to comprehensive coverage.\n- AI Citation Analysts: Monitor and optimize for inclusion in AI responses.\n- Schema Specialists: Ensure that the machine-readable structure enhances entity understanding.\nThese cross-functional teams integrate with traditional SEO, content marketing, analytics, and business intelligence functions.\nThe Bottom Line\nIn this new landscape, the question isn\u2019t whether your website ranks. It\u2019s whether AI recommends your brand when it matters most.\nThe Triple-P framework gives you the structure to navigate this future with confidence.\nHere\u2019s what I recommend getting started:\n- Conduct an AI presence audit: Understand where your brand appears in AI responses across key platforms.\n- Analyze sentiment distribution: Assess not just if you\u2019re mentioned, but how you\u2019re portrayed in AI-generated content.\n- Connect AI metrics to business results: Start tracking the relationship between AI presence and conversion patterns.\n- Identify entity perception gaps: Compare how AI systems understand your brand versus your desired positioning.\n- Deploy real-time monitoring: Implement systems to track citation changes as they happen.\nThe branded AI search revolution isn\u2019t coming \u2013 it\u2019s already here.\nThe brands that embrace the Triple-P framework today will be the ones AI recommends tomorrow.\nNote: In March 2025, BrightEdge surveyed over 1,000 of its customers who are marketers.

      "text": "How to scrape customer reviews for actionable insights\n- Giulia Panozzo\n- Oct 26, 2024\n- 7 min read\nUpdated: Oct 27, 2024\nI was recently at SMX London where I delivered a talk called \"Search + UX: The Behavioural Data Your SEO Strategy Should Care About\".\nI spoke about all of those behavioural metrics that we SEOs have been leaving behind as they're not 'official ranking factors', and all of the diagnostic tools you can use to figure out UX improvement opportunities that can benefit search, too.\nAmong the underrated data I spoke about, there were those coming from customer surveys, customer experience/customer service logs, reviews and online forums.\nWhat's so good about customer data for SEO?\nOrganic content coming directly from a customer (or a prospect) can unlock friction points and blockers that might be hard to identify only with only quantitative data from WebAnalytics or any of the usual SEO tools.\nSome of the common friction points can be, for example:\nShipping, delivery and return policy\nLegitimacy of the brand\nWebsite errors and poor UX\nBut can extend to a number of other topics that might be challenging to analyse at scale.\nWhen you're familiar with a brand and their process, it's easy to assume that someone else's experience and point of view will be similar to yours. But biases, motivations and previous experiences shape behaviours differently, so it's important that the quantitative data we obtain from analytics to tell us what is happening (e.g. drop in clicks, low check-out rates) can be paired with the qualitative data that can tell us why that is happening.\nHow can I get qualitative data directly from my customers or prospects - and what do I do with it?\nTo get this kind of behavioural data, you can either:\nSpeak to your customer support agents and ask about some of the most common topics that come up\nActively run pre or post-purchase surveys (e.g. 'What almost stopped you from buying today?' after check-out)\nScrape reviews, social mentions and online forums to capture both customers' frustrations and pre-purchase blockers encountered by prospects.\nWe're going to see this last option below, since it's one of the things I tested for my talk and it's easily scalable.\nHow to scrape brand reviews with Python on Colab\nThe first step is to identify the brand and the reviews site you want to scrape.\nFor example, I ran this exercise for Ebay on Trustpilot.\nBear in mind that there might be some blockers on the specific reviews site, so you might have to work around those limitations.\nThe second step is to open Colab (free and open source Google tool that allows you to write and execute Python in your browser).\nIf that's your first time using it, all you have to do to get started is click on that 'Code' box on the top left, and input what comes in the next section.\nYou will first need to install and import the framework and libraries needed for this project, Webdriver (this allows you to perform automated tasks across browsers), BeautifulSoup (your HTML parser needed to scrape) and Pandas (to analyse and manipulate data).\nInput the commands below in the grey coding area to do so:\n!pip install selenium\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport time\nimport pandas as pd\nThen press the 'Play' button on the left of the cell to run it:\nYou can then move on to the actual scraping task, following this template I used:\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n# The URL of the Trustpilot page for Ebay\nurl = 'https://www.trustpilot.com/review/ebay.com'\n# Send a GET request to the page\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n# Parse the page content using BeautifulSoup\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n# Find all the review blocks using the specific class name from the HTML *\nreviews = soup.find_all('p', class_='typography_body-l__KUYFJ typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_color-black__5LYEn')\n# Loop through the reviews and print each one\nfor review in reviews:\nreview_text = review.get_text(strip=True)\nprint(f\"Review: {review_text}\")\nprint(\"------\")\n*Note that this might need to change if you use a different website than Trustpilot. You will need to go into Inspect Mode and find the HTML class that specifies your reviews section, and input that code in place of 'typography_body-l__KUYFJ typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_color-black__5LYEn'.\nAnd voila! You have your set of reviews.\nA note for paginated websites:\nThe script above will give you anything that is included in the URL of choice, but if the reviews expand over a set of paginated URLs, you will need extra steps to define the new pages to analyse.\nBelow is the extended script to include the paginated URLs on top of the base one (again, this is for Trustpilot specific example, and you might need to tweak rules based on the URL structure of the website you choose to scrape):\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nbase_url = \"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/ebay.com\"\nmax_pages = 10\n# Scrape the first page (without the \"?page=\" parameter)\nurls = [base_url]\n# Add URLs for subsequent pages with \"?page=\" parameter\nfor page_num in range(1, max_pages + 1):\nurls.append(f\"{base_url}?page={page_num}\")\n# Iterate through all URLs (including the first page)\nfor url in urls:\nresponse = requests.get(url)\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n# Find all reviews on the current page (this is retained from the previous script)\nreviews = soup.find_all('p', class_='typography_body-l__KUYFJ typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_color-black__5LYEn')\n# Loop through the reviews on the current page and print each one\nfor review in reviews:\nreview_text = review.get_text(strip=True)\nprint(f\"Review: {review_text}\")\nprint(\"------\")\nprint(f\"Review: {review_text}\")\nprint(\"------\")\nThis will bring back significantly more reviews that you can analyse in the next step.\nWhat do I do now with all this data?\nYou have three options:\nYou can use a free tool to analyse Ngrams like Voyant-Tools to give you a full overview of the most used terms, their relationships and their connotation in context (negative VS positive).\nYou can use OpenAI or any other LLMs to help you identify common topics:\nOr, you can work on another Python script to proceed in Colab!\nHere is one based on the code and output above, that will give you the top topics and the suggested actions to address future customer concerns based on previous complaints proactively.\nBuckle up because it's a long one, as it includes the specification for suggested actions.\n# Import necessary libraries: if you have BeautifulSoup from the previous script already, you can skip row 2\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nfrom gensim import corpora, models\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nimport string\n# Download NLTK resources\nnltk.download('stopwords')\nnltk.download('punkt')\n# Define URL and scrape reviews (this is included in the previous script, so you might skip to the pre-process step if you want)\nurl = 'https://www.trustpilot.com/review/ebay.com'\nresponse = requests.get(url)\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\nreviews = soup.find_all('p', class_='typography_body-l__KUYFJ typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_color-black__5LYEn')\n# Preprocess reviews to create a list of lists (documents)\nreview_texts = [\n[\nword.lower() for word in word_tokenize(review.get_text(strip=True))\nif word not in stopwords.words('english') and word not in string.punctuation\n]\nfor review in reviews # Iterate through each review element\n]\n# Create dictionary, corpus, and LDA model\ndictionary = corpora.Dictionary(review_texts)\n# Pass the list of lists\ncorpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(text) for text in review_texts]\nnum_topics = 5\nlda_model = models.LdaModel(corpus, id2word=dictionary, num_topics=num_topics)\n# Print most common topics\nprint(\"Top common topics:\")\nfor idx, topic in lda_model.print_topics(num_words=10):\nprint(f\"Topic {idx+1}:\")\nprint(topic)\n# Suggest opportunities based on topic keywords\ndef suggest_opportunities(topic_keywords):\n# Prioritize specific keyword combinations for more accurate suggestions (this can be tweaked based on most common topics and business model)\nif any(word in topic_keywords for word in [\"fake\", \"counterfeit\", \"scam\"]):\nif \"item\" in topic_keywords or \"product\" in topic_keywords:\nreturn \"Investigate potential product quality or authenticity issues.\"\nelse:\nreturn \"Strengthen measures to combat counterfeit products and protect buyers.\"\nelif any(word in topic_keywords for word in [\"money\", \"payment\", \"price\", \"cost\", \"fee\"]):\nif any(word in topic_keywords for word in [\"refund\", \"dispute\"]):\nreturn \"Investigate issues with refunds, disputes, or pricing concerns.\"\nelse:\nreturn \"Review pricing strategies and payment options to address potential customer concerns.\"\nelif any(word in topic_keywords for word in [\"shipping\", \"delivery\", \"delay\", \"late\"]):\nif \"time\" in topic_keywords:\nreturn \"Focus on reducing wait times for shipping or delivery.\"\nelse:\nreturn \"Focus on improving shipping times and tracking visibility.\"\nelif any(word in topic_keywords for word in [\"return\", \"refund\", \"policy\"]):\nreturn \"Streamline the returns process and make it more customer-friendly.\"\nelif any(word in topic_keywords for word in [\"customer\", \"service\", \"support\"]):\nreturn \"Enhance customer support channels and empower representatives to resolve issues quickly.\"\nelif any(word in topic_keywords for word in [\"seller\", \"communication\"]):\nreturn \"Encourage better communication between buyers and sellers.\"\nelse:\nreturn \"Further investigation and data analysis needed.\"\n# Print opportunities for each topic\nfor idx, topic in lda_model.print_topics(num_words=10):\nprint(f\"Topic {idx+1}: {topic}\")\nprint(f\"Opportunity: {suggest_opportunities(topic)}\")\nprint(\"------\")\nHere is what this script gave me as top three actionable insights that I can bring into my hypothetical strategy for Ebay to remove friction and resolve painpoints:\nStreamline return process and make it more customer-friendly\nEncourage better communication between buyers and sellers\nEnhance customer support channels and empower representatatives to resolve issues quickly.\nFrom an SEO perspective, this doesn't immediately tell me specific actions, but it identifies areas to work on, for example:\nMaking sure return schema is enabled and that the return policy is clearly marked on the Merchant Centre; also, building FAQs and help pages directly related to returns to address any policies and concerns proactively\nMaking customer support channels more visible on the page and easy to interact with\nEnable Q&A on product pages to facilitate communication between parties in the marketplace space.\nFrom this, you can explore more actionable items that align directly with your team and your business goals, and find areas of cross-functional collaboration that might even result in a feature request.\nFinal note: Remember that by nature, Trustpilot tends to capture more of the post-purchase funnel, but you can repeat the same process on Reddit or other platforms to figure out how to improve some of the issues that might be arising before conversion and blocking it.\nAre you going to give it a go?\nDo you want to see the entire presentation at your conference?

      "text": "Google\u2019s transformation into an AI-driven search platform represents more than just a technological advancement. It\u2019s a fundamental shift in how the search giant views itself as a company and the value it provides to users.\nCindy Krum has spoken at several events this year about her theory that Google might merge AI Overviews, Discover, and international results to build the next-gen search engine.\nThe overview of Cindy\u2019s thoughts is that Google is not only internationalizing its platform, but is also converging AI Overview, Google Discover, and AI Mode into a unified, hyper-personalized search experience.\nThis evolution aligns with Google\u2019s broader push toward understanding search as \u201cjourneys\u201d rather than static queries, underlined by MUM.\nMy theory is that the move into heavily personalized search journeys builds on the past 20 years that Google has been striving to be a personal assistant. AI has made that possible.\nCindy is the founder of MobileMoxie and is described as being \u201cyears ahead of the pack.\u201d I spoke to her about the implications for SEO and what part of this shift to AI-organized search and journeys SEO professionals are underestimating right now.\nYou can watch the full interview with Cindy on IMHO below, or continue reading the article summary.\nPredictive, Conversational, And Personalized\nCindy believes that, currently, there is a bigger shift than what some SEO professionals have been talking about: A fundamental shift in the way Google sees itself as a company and the way that it sees the value that it provides.\nThe real shift was in 2018, just after Google launched mobile-first indexing, when Google began organizing search results around entities. It said it wanted to be more predictive, more conversational, and more personalized.\nAccording to Cindy, Google\u2019s current AI initiatives aren\u2019t new developments but rather the culmination of a strategy.\n\u201cEverything they\u2019ve been doing since 2018 has been feeding this goal of getting us into this AI search reality,\u201d she explains.\nThe AI Overviews, Google Discover expansion, and AI Mode we see today are direct results of this seven-year journey.\nThe Hidden Strategy Behind Google\u2019s International Push\nOne of the most overlooked aspects of Google\u2019s current transformation is its renewed attempt to consolidate international domains.\nGoogle previously tried to eliminate country-specific versions (CCTLDs) before mobile-first indexing but had to roll back the initiative. Now, it is trying again, and the timing is significant.\n\u201cIf you separate everything by country and language, you\u2019re limiting your learning pipeline. You have smaller, fragmented datasets.\u201d Cindy explains.\nWhen you consolidate and abstract at the entity level, you can disambiguate meaning and link keywords to entity ideas across all languages. That speeds up the learning process.\nGoogle can then apply what it learns in one language to another; we\u2019re already seeing this with AI Overviews.\nWhen it can\u2019t find the right answer in a local language, it translates English content because it knows the English answer is probably also correct in other languages. This saves time and money on crawling, indexing, and ranking.\nAI Mode Isn\u2019t The Product. You Are\nI asked Cindy if she thought Google might try to monetize AI Mode, but she believes Google\u2019s strategy is more sophisticated.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t forget how Google makes money, it\u2019s ads,\u201d Cindy emphasizes. The real value lies in building comprehensive user profiles that enable precision ad targeting.\nGoogle\u2019s goal is to present ads only to users likely to convert, making its advertising platform more attractive to businesses while creating a seamless experience for users.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not monetizing AI Mode directly. They\u2019re using it to collect data that allows them to monetize ads more effectively.\u201d\nThis strategy extends to Performance Max campaigns on the paid search side, where Google controls optimization based on metrics it doesn\u2019t trust advertisers to manage effectively.\nDiscovery Is Moving To TikTok, Reddit & Social\nDespite Google\u2019s technological advances, some users are losing trust in the quality of search results.\nHowever, the solution isn\u2019t abandoning Google but rather understanding how different platforms serve different purposes in the modern search ecosystem.\nCindy\u2019s opinion is that Google is no longer the place where discovery happens.\nUsers increasingly conduct research across multiple platforms. TikTok for discovery, Reddit for authentic opinions, and eventually Google for final purchase decisions.\nThis multi-platform journey reflects a more sophisticated approach to information gathering and decision-making.\nCindy stresses the need to understand real branding, not just SEO branding or digital PR.\n\u201cTo be able to influence the narrative in any kind of AI search result, you have to be actively influencing all those things,\u201d she notes. \u201cSEOs for years have been so focused on their website to the detriment of every other branding opportunity out there.\u201d\nUnderstanding Search Journeys\nFor SEO professionals looking to optimize for journeys rather than just keywords, Cindy recommends studying Google\u2019s own navigation suggestions.\nWhen performing searches, Google often displays additional navigation layers that reveal its understanding of user intent and likely next steps.\n\u201cThis is where Google is kind of showing their cards and saying these are the queries that we expect you\u2019re going to narrow down this query,\u201d she explains.\nBy mapping these suggested pathways, SEO professionals can identify where their content fits into the user journey and where Google needs education about additional aspects of that journey.\nIf She Were Starting Today? TikTok\nI asked Cindy if she were starting from the beginning now, what she would do and where she would invest, her immediate answer was TikTok.\nShe explains, \u201cIt\u2019s where young audiences are, the algorithm promotes discovery, and content is repurposed across all other platforms. Importantly, it\u2019s not just a fad; businesses are being built and scaled directly on TikTok.\u201d\nAnd while influencer saturation is real, Cindy sees TikTok as a smart, scrappy way to build awareness with a small budget and scale fast.\nPreparing For The Future\nThe shift toward AI-organized search results and journey-based optimization requires a fundamental rethinking of digital marketing approaches.\nSuccess in this new era of AI search demands understanding the complete customer journey, from initial discovery through final purchase, and ensuring brand presence at every touchpoint.\nThis includes active participation in the broader digital conversation about your industry, products, and services.\nThe future of search isn\u2019t just about ranking higher; it\u2019s about being present wherever your audience might encounter your brand throughout their decision-making journey.\n\u201cThe future of search is understanding the entire journey, not just the keyword or the query.\u201d\nThank you to Cindy Krum for offering her insights and being my guest on IMHO.\nMore Resources:\n- Google Discover, AI Mode, And What It Means For Publishers: Interview With John Shehata\n- The Truth About LLM Hallucinations With Barry Adams\n- SEO In The Age Of AI\nFeatured Image: Shelley Walsh/Search Engine Journal"

      "text": "Using outdated and traditional SEO tactics centered around keywords and backlinks is not moving the needle anymore, as Google shifts toward AI-driven answers.\nOrganic clicks are going down as a result of Google AI Overviews and the rise of zero-click searches, where users get answers directly on Google\u2019s search results page without clicking through to any websites.\nSEO is not dead; it just evolved. To succeed in this new era, brands and marketers need to embrace structured, intent-driven content, enhancing trustworthiness, and aligning more closely with brand and user experience strategies.\nBut, how do you do this? Let\u2019s explore.\nTable of Contents\nOmnichannel Strategy\nIn today\u2019s search landscape, you need to be everywhere where your audience is, including platforms like Reddit, Quora, TikTok, YouTube, and anywhere else relevant.\nIf your brand is not present on those discovery channels, you need to get on them as soon as possible.\nUser behavior has changed, and people are using different search engines and channels to find information, products, reviews, and more.\nFor example:\n- Reddit for the opinions of other users who have used a similar product or service.\n- TikTok and YouTube for tutorials and product reviews.\n- Instagram for discovery.\n- Amazon and Pinterest for product reviews and inspiration.\nIf your marketing strategy focuses only on Google, you\u2019re ignoring a large portion of your target audience who are looking for your content, which is basically invisible to them.\nOptimize For AI Overviews\nTo rank for AIO, brands and marketers must focus on creating high-quality, authoritative content that directly answers user questions, is well-structured, and easy for AI to understand.\n| Tactic | Overview | Best Practices |\n| Create high-quality conversational content. | Conduct research and see what queries show for AIOs. Create original and unique content that meets user intent and answers users\u2019 questions. | Update and modify existing content for AI Overviews by answering questions, making it conversational, and using quotes, testimonials, and updated headings. |\n| Use plain headings and short paragraphs. | This helps improve content readability for both users and AI. | Use clear headings, concise paragraphs, and natural language to enhance AI understanding. |\n| Mark up content with structured data. | This helps AI and traditional search engines understand your content better. | Use schema markup (e.g., FAQ Page, HowTo, Product). |\n| Let AI bots in. | This will help your content get crawled and cited by AI systems. | Use llm.txt and check your robots.txt file to allow bots like OpenAI\u2019s GPTBot and Google AI. Make sure they are not blocked. |\n| Earn mentions on trustworthy sites. | This will help improve your authority and increase your brand visibility. | Create high-quality content with unique information, contribute guest posts, stay active on social media, appear on podcasts, use internal linking, and implement PR strategies. |\n| Keep content fresh. | AI chatbots love up-to-date information. | Regularly update content with new data, statistics, and unique and valuable information for end-users. |\n| Track brand mentions. | Brands that are mentioned frequently across various platforms (i.e., PR, blogs, social media, news coverage, YouTube forums like Reddit and Quora, and authoritative sites) tend to be mentioned by AI. | Use tools like Google Search Console, Brand24, and Mention.com to monitor online conversations. |\nFocus On Branded Searches\nBranded searches play a vital role in shaping brand perception, driving engagement, and ensuring your brand\u2019s visibility and authority for large language models (LLMs).\nLLMs do not work like traditional search engines. They look at user intent, context, and conversational relevance.\nTo elevate your brand presence:\n- Your information must be accurate and consistent across all platforms.\n- Your content should be useful and helpful to your target audience.\n- It should showcase expertise through thought leadership, offering original, unique, and data-backed insights quoted across authoritative sites and forums.\n- Your brand needs a strong reputation.\nAdapt your approach by tracking brand mentions using tools like Brand24 and Semrush, and analyzing LLM-driven traffic via Google Analytics 4, while also testing brand visibility across different platforms and devices.\nFocus On User Intent And Topic Clusters\nWe have moved from keywords to relevance.\nOptimize for entire topics and users\u2019 needs by creating in-depth content that covers all aspects of a subject and anticipates users\u2019 questions.\nUse long-tail keywords and natural language to cover users\u2019 intent. Tools like MarketMuse by Siteimprove do a wonderful job at this.\nAI-Powered Content Creation And Optimization\nGoogle is not against AI-generated content. Google does not like low-quality AI content.\nBefore LLMs came on the stage, content creation often involved manual writing and optimization that took a long time to draft a high-quality article focusing on E-E-A-T (or expertise, experience, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness).\nNow, you can automate content briefs, generate outlines, create content drafts, edit them, and make them your own. A lot of AI tools and platforms incorporate ChatGPT into their services and add in so-called proprietary algorithms on top of it.\nWith AI, you can create content at a much faster pace and optimize existing content easier than before, but I don\u2019t recommend it for content creation.\nHere\u2019s why.\nThere is a lot of content out there that repeats and rinses what everyone else does. Your content must be different and educate your audience, convince them that you\u2019re the subject matter expert on a topic, and gain trust and solve their problems.\nThis kind of content is best written by humans with AI assistance to enhance quality, make it more engaging, and encourage people to share it.\nWrapping Up\nSEO is changing fast into a conversational experience powered by AI.\nThe tactics and strategies that once worked won\u2019t cut it anymore in today\u2019s AI-powered results.\nBut, this is not the end of SEO. Rather, it\u2019s an SEO evolution as Google continues its mission to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful.\nTo win in this new era, brands and marketers must shift from chasing rankings to building visibility, trust, and relevance across multiple platforms \u2013 whether that\u2019s on Google, TikTok, Reddit, or Quora.\nIt\u2019s also important to deliver content that\u2019s useful and up-to-date, solving users\u2019 problems and helping them during their journey.\nAI is here to assist, not replace. AI can handle the heavy lifting, but don\u2019t hand over the steering wheel.\nBrands that will thrive have a human touch in providing value, showing expertise, and genuinely connecting with their audience.\nDon\u2019t forget who you\u2019re really creating content for, which is people.\nMore Resources:\n- AI Search Optimization: Data Finds Brand Mentions Improve Visibility\n- 5 Key Enterprise SEO And AI Trends For 2025\n- The State Of AI In Marketing\nFeatured Image: Collagery/Shutterstock"

      "text": "Search is changing, and not just because of Google updates.\nBuyers are changing how they find, evaluate, and decide. They are researching in AI summaries, asking questions out loud to their phones, and converting through conversations that happen outside of what most analytics can track.\nOur latest ebook, \u201cThe Future Of Search: 16 Actionable Pivots That Improve Visibility & Conversions,\u201d explores how marketers are responding to this shift.\nIt offers a closer look at what it means to optimize for visibility, engagement, and results in a fragmented, AI-influenced search landscape.\nHere are five key takeaways.\n1. Ranking Well Doesn\u2019t Guarantee Visibility\nGetting to the top of search results used to be enough. Today, that\u2019s no longer the case.\nAI summaries, voice assistants, and platform-native answers often intercept the buyer before they reach your website.\nEven high-ranking content can go unseen if it\u2019s not structured in a way that\u2019s easily digestible by large language models.\nFor example, research shows AI-generated summaries often prioritize single-sentence answers and structured formats like tables and lists.\nOnly a small fraction of AI citations rely on exact-match keywords, reinforcing that clarity and context are now more important than repetition.\nTo stay visible, businesses need to consider how their content is interpreted across multiple AI systems, not just traditional SERPs.\n2. Many Conversions Happen Offscreen\nClicks and page views only tell part of the story.\nHigh-intent actions like phone calls, text messages, and offline conversations are often left out of attribution models, yet they play a critical role in decision-making.\nThese touchpoints are especially common in service-based industries and B2B scenarios where buyers want real interaction.\nOne case study reveals that a company discovered nearly 90% of their Yelp conversions came through phone calls they weren\u2019t tracking. Another saw appointment bookings spike after attributing organic search traffic to calls rather than clicks.\nOur ebook refers to this as the insight gap, and highlights how conversation tracking helps marketers close it.\n3. Listening Is More Effective Than Guessing\nMarketers have access to more customer input than ever, but much of it goes unused.\nCall transcripts, support calls, and chat logs contain the language buyers actually use.\nTeams that analyze these conversations are gaining an edge, using real voice-of-customer insights to refine messaging, improve landing pages, and inform campaign strategy.\nIn one example, a marketing agency increased qualified leads by 67% simply by identifying the specific terminology customers used when asking about their services.\nThe shift from assumptions to evidence is helping brands prioritize what matters most, and it\u2019s making their campaigns more effective.\n4. Paid Search Works Better When It Aligns With Everything Else\nSearch behavior is not linear, and neither is the buyer journey.\nUsers often move between organic results, paid ads, and AI-generated suggestions in the same session. The strongest-performing campaigns tend to be the ones that echo the same language and value props across all these touchpoints.\nThat includes aligning ad copy with real customer concerns, drawing from call transcripts, and building landing pages that reflect the buyer\u2019s stage in the decision process.\nIt also means rethinking what happens after the click.\n5. Attribution Models Are Out Of Step With Reality\nMost attribution still assumes that conversions happen on a single screen. That\u2019s rarely true.\nA manager might discover your brand in an AI-generated search snippet on a desktop, send the link to themselves in Slack, and later call your sales team from their iPhone after revisiting the content on mobile.\nMarketers relying only on last-click attribution may be optimizing based on incomplete or misleading data.\nThe report makes the case for models that include multi-touch, cross-device, and offline activity to give a fuller picture of what drives conversions.\nThis isn\u2019t about tracking more for the sake of it. It\u2019s about making smarter decisions with the signals that matter.\nRethinking Search Starts With Rethinking Buyers\nThe ebook, written in collaboration with CallRail, offers more than strategy updates. It is a reminder that behind every metric is a person making a decision.\nMarketers who succeed in this new environment aren\u2019t just optimizing for rankings or clicks. They are optimizing for how people think, search, and take action.\nDownload the full report to explore how buyer behavior is reshaping search strategy.\nFeatured Image: innni/Shutterstock"

      "text": "Perhaps you\u2019ve heard of regex but aren\u2019t quite sure how it can be used in SEO or whether it fits into your own strategy.\nRegular expressions, or \u2018regex\u2019, are like an in-line programming language for text searches that allow you to include complex search strings, partial matches and wildcards, case-insensitive searches, and other advanced instructions.\nYou can think of them as searching for a pattern, rather than a specific string of text.\nTherefore, they can help you to find entire sets of search results that, at first glance, may appear to have little in common with each other.\nRegex expressions are a language all their own and the first time you see one, it can look quite alien.\nBut they are quite easy to learn and can be used across JavaScript, Python and other programming languages, making them a versatile and powerful SEO tool.\nIn this guide, you\u2019ll learn common regex operators, how to use more advanced regex filters for SEO, how to use regex in Google Analytics and Google Search Console, and more.\nYou\u2019ll find examples of regex at work in different ways in SEO, too.\nWhat Does Regex Look Like?\nA regular expression typically includes a combination of text that will match exactly in the search results, along with several operators that act more like wildcards to achieve a pattern match rather than an exact text match.\nThis can include a single-character wildcard, a match for one or more characters, or a match for zero or more characters, as well as optional characters, nested sub-expressions in parentheses, and \u2018or\u2019 functions.\nBy combining these different operations together, you can build a complex expression that can achieve very far-reaching, yet very specific results.\nCommon Regex Operators\nA few examples of common regex operators include:\n. A wildcard match for any single character.\n.* A match for zero or more characters.\n.+ A match for one or more characters.\nd A match for any single numerical digit 0-9.\n? Inserted after a character to make it an optional part of the expression.\n| A vertical line or \u2018pipe\u2019 character indicates an \u2018or\u2019 function.\n^ Used to denote the start of a string.\n$ Used to denote the end of a string.\n( ) Used to nest a sub-expression.\n\\ Inserted before an operator or special character to \u2018escape\u2019 it.\nSome programming languages, such as JavaScript, allow the inclusion of \u2018flags\u2019 after the regex pattern itself, and these can further affect the outcome:\ng Returns all matches instead of just the first one.\ni Returns case-insensitive results.\nm Activates multiline mode.\ns Activates \u2018dotall\u2019 mode.\nu Activates full Unicode support.\ny Searches the specific text position (\u2018sticky\u2019 mode).\nAs you can see, together these operators and flags start to build up to a complex logical language, giving you the ability to achieve very specific results across large, unordered data sets.\nHow Do You Use Regex For SEO?\nRegex can be used to explore the queries different user segments use, which queries are common to specific content areas, which queries drive traffic to specific parts of your site, and more.\nIn this article, Hamlet Batista demonstrated how to use regex in Python to analyze server log files, for example.\nAnd in this one, Chris Long showed you how to use regex to extract the position, item, and name of the breadcrumbs associated with each URL of your site as part of a scalable keyword research and segmentation process.\nGoogle encourages SEO pros to share examples of how they\u2019re using regex on Twitter using the hashtag #performanceregex.\nHere are a couple tips from SEO Twitter (you\u2019ll notice it\u2019s a pretty quiet hashtag \u2013 add your own examples if you have them!):\nUse slug$ in a filter to see a list of every page/keyword that ends on \u201cslug\u201d. Very important if you have to manage large websites \ud83d\udda4#performanceregex\n\u2014 hannes-jeremia jaacks (@HannesJaacks) December 31, 2021\nI\u2019ve compiled quite an extensive library of #regularexpressions for #googlesearchconsole. \ud83d\ude0e\nHit me with any other ideas, happy to add them. @danielwaisberg @DanielHereMe @CyrusShepard @5le @DataChaz #performanceregex #regex #seo https://t.co/BKX9UCGrOU\n\u2014 JC Chouinard (@ChouinardJC) June 17, 2021\nUsing Regex On Google Analytics\nOne of the most common uses of regex for SEO is in Google Analytics, where regular expressions can be used to set up filters so that you only see the data you want to see.\nIn this sense, the expression is used to exclude results, rather than to generate a set of inclusive search results.\nFor example, if you want to exclude data from IP addresses on your local area network, you might filter out 192.168.*.* to remove the full range from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255.\nMore Advanced Regex SEO Filters\nAs a more complex example, let\u2019s imagine you have two brands: regex247 and regex365.\nYou might want to filter results that match any combination of URLs that contain these brand names, such as regex247.biz or www.regex365.org.\nOne way to do this is with a fairly simple \u2018or\u2019 expression:\n.*regex247.*|.*regex365.*\nThis would remove all matching URLs from your Analytics data, including subfolder paths and specific page URLs that appear on those domain names.\nA Word Of Warning\nIt is worth noting that \u2013 similar to your robots.txt file \u2013 a poorly written regex expression can quite easily filter out most or all of your data by including an unrestricted wildcard match.\nThe good news is that in many SEO cases, the filter is only applied to your data at the reporting stage, and by editing or deleting your regex expression, you can restore full visibility to your data.\nYou can also test regular expressions on a number of online testing tools, in order to see if they achieve the intended outcome \u2013 allowing you to \u2018sandbox\u2019 your regex expressions before you let them loose across your entire data set.\nTo create regex filters on Google Analytics, first, navigate to the type of Report you want to create (e.g. Behaviour > Site Content > All Pages or Acquisition > All Traffic > Source/Medium).\nBelow the graph, at the top of the data table, look for the search box and click advanced to display the advanced filter options.\nHere you can include or exclude data based on a particular dimension or metric. In the dropdown list after you select your dimension, choose Matching RegExp and then enter your expression into the text box.\n\u2018Or\u2019 And \u2018And\u2019 In Google Analytics Regex\nTo create an \u2018or\u2019 expression in Google Analytics, just include the pipe character (the | vertical stroke symbol) between the appropriate segments of your expression.\nGoogle Analytics regular expressions do not support \u2018and\u2019 statements within a single regex; however, you can just add another filter to achieve this.\nBelow your first regex, just click Add a dimension or metric and enter your next regex. In this way, you can stack as many expressions as you want and they will be processed as a single logical \u2018and\u2019 statement when filtering your data.\nUsing Regex In Google Search Console\nIn 2021, Google Search Console began supporting the Re2 syntax of regex, allowing webmasters to include and exclude data within the user interface.\nYou\u2019ll find all metacharacters supported by Google Search Console in this RE2 regex syntax reference on GitHub.\nAt the time of writing, there is a character limit of 4096 characters (which is usually enough\u2026).\nExamples you can use in Search Console can be filtering for queries containing a specific brand and the variations users could type, such as Facebook:\n.*facebook.*|face*book.*|fb.*|fbook.*|f*book.*\nFilter out users finding your website through \u201ccommercial\u201d intent terms:\n.*(best|top|alternate|alternative|vs|versus|review*).*\nRelated: Google Search Console Adds New Regex Filter Options\nWhy Is Regex Important For SEO?\nFinally, why does all this matter?\nWell, it\u2019s all about taking control of your data and filtering out the parts of it that don\u2019t help you to improve your SEO \u2013 whether that\u2019s particular pages or parts of your website, traffic from a specific source or medium, or your own local network data.\nYou can create quite simple regex expressions to achieve a basic \u2018include\u2019 or \u2018exclude\u2019 filter, or write longer expressions that work similarly to programming code to achieve complex and very specific results.\nAnd with the right regex for each campaign, you can verify that your SEO efforts are achieving your aims, ambitions, and outcomes \u2013 a powerful way to prove positive ROI on your future SEO investments.\nMore resources:\n- Google Search Console Adds New Regex Filter Options\n- Google Search Analytics API Can Finally Pull Discover Data\n- Advanced Technical SEO: A Complete Guide\nFeatured Image: Optura Design/Shutterstock"

      "text": "An apparent leak of Google Search API documentation has sparked intense debate within the SEO community, with some claiming it proves Google\u2019s dishonesty and others urging caution in interpreting the information.\nAs the industry grapples with the allegations, a balanced examination of Google\u2019s statements and the perspectives of SEO experts is crucial to understanding the whole picture.\nLeaked Documents Vs. Google\u2019s Public Statements\nOver the years, Google has consistently maintained that specific ranking signals, such as click data and user engagement metrics, aren\u2019t used directly in its search algorithms.\nIn public statements and interviews, Google representatives have emphasized the importance of relevance, quality, and user experience while denying the use of specific metrics like click-through rates or bounce rates as ranking-related factors.\nHowever, the leaked API documentation appears to contradict these statements.\nIt contains references to features like \u201cgoodClicks,\u201d \u201cbadClicks,\u201d \u201clastLongestClicks,\u201d impressions, and unicorn clicks, tied to systems called Navboost and Glue, which Google VP Pandu Nayak confirmed in DOJ testimony are parts of Google\u2019s ranking systems.\nThe documentation also alleges that Google calculates several metrics using Chrome browser data on individual pages and entire domains, suggesting the full clickstream of Chrome users is being leveraged to influence search rankings.\nThis contradicts past Google statements that Chrome data isn\u2019t used for organic searches.\nThe Leak\u2019s Origins & Authenticity\nErfan Azimi, CEO of digital marketing agency EA Eagle Digital, alleges he obtained the documents and shared them with Rand Fishkin and Mike King.\nAzimi claims to have spoken with ex-Google Search employees who confirmed the authenticity of the information but declined to go on record due to the situation\u2019s sensitivity.\nWhile the leak\u2019s origins remain somewhat ambiguous, several ex-Googlers who reviewed the documents have stated they appear legitimate.\nFishkin states:\n\u201cA critical next step in the process was verifying the authenticity of the API Content Warehouse documents. So, I reached out to some ex-Googler friends, shared the leaked docs, and asked for their thoughts.\u201d\nThree ex-Googlers responded, with one stating, \u201cIt has all the hallmarks of an internal Google API.\u201d\nHowever, without direct confirmation from Google, the authenticity of the leaked information is still debatable. Google has not yet publicly commented on the leak.\nIt\u2019s important to note that, according to Fishkin\u2019s article, none of the ex-Googlers confirmed that the leaked data was from Google Search. Only that it appears to have originated from within Google.\nRelated: Google Data Leak Clarification\nIndustry Perspectives & Analysis\nMany in the SEO community have long suspected that Google\u2019s public statements don\u2019t tell the whole story. The leaked API documentation has only fueled these suspicions.\nFishkin and King argue that if the information is accurate, it could have significant implications for SEO strategies and website search optimization.\nKey takeaways from their analysis include:\n- Navboost and the use of clicks, CTR, long vs. Short clicks, and user data from Chrome appear to be among Google\u2019s most powerful ranking signals.\n- Google employs safelists for sensitive topics like COVID-19, elections, and travel to control what sites appear.\n- Google uses Quality Rater feedback and ratings in its ranking systems, not just as a training set.\n- Click data influences how Google weights links for ranking purposes.\n- Classic ranking factors like PageRank and anchor text are losing influence compared to more user-centric signals.\n- Building a brand and generating search demand is more critical than ever for SEO success.\nHowever, just because something is mentioned in API documentation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s being used to rank search results.\nOther industry experts urge caution when interpreting the leaked documents.\nThey point out that Google may use the information for testing purposes or apply it only to specific search verticals rather than use it as active ranking signals.\nThere are also open questions about how much weight these signals carry compared to other ranking factors. The leak doesn\u2019t provide the full context or algorithm details.\nThe Google leaks are inherently interesting, but don\u2019t let it make you slide back into the manipulation mindset. Keep focusing on product and user experience. That is the long game.\n\u2014 Greg Bernhardt \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf0a (@GregBernhardt4) May 28, 2024\nMy take on the leaked Google API documentation: Interesting from an academic POV, but nothing that would cause me to recommend anything different to our @seoClarity clients than what we already recommend.\n\u2014 Mark Traphagen \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\ud83c\udf08 (they/them) (@marktraphagen) May 28, 2024\nMy take on the leaked docs.\nWe don\u2019t know if this is for production or for testing. My guess is it\u2019s mostly for testing potential changes.\nWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s used for web or for other verticals. Some things might only be used for a Google home or news etc.\nWe don\u2019t know\u2026\n\u2014 Ryan Jones (@RyanJones) May 28, 2024\nWe also don\u2019t know if this is for Google search or Google cloud document retrieval\nAPIs seem pick & choose \u2013 that\u2019s not how I expect the algorithm to be run \u2013 what if an engineer wants to skip all those quality checks \u2013 this looks like I want to build a content warehouse app for\u2026\n\u2014 David Quaid (@DavidGQuaid) May 28, 2024\nUnanswered Questions & Future Implications\nAs the SEO community continues to analyze the leaked documents, many questions still need to be answered.\nWithout official confirmation from Google, the authenticity and context of the information are still a matter of debate.\nKey open questions include:\n- How much of this documented data is actively used to rank search results?\n- What is the relative weighting and importance of these signals compared to other ranking factors?\n- How have Google\u2019s systems and use of this data evolved?\n- Will Google change its public messaging and be more transparent about using behavioral data?\nAs the debate surrounding the leak continues, it\u2019s wise to approach the information with a balanced, objective mindset.\nUnquestioningly accepting the leak as gospel truth or completely dismissing it are both shortsighted reactions. The reality likely lies somewhere in between.\nRelated: Doubts Emerge Over Alleged Google Data Leak\nPotential Implications For SEO Strategies and Website Optimization\nIt would be highly inadvisable to act on information shared from this supposed \u2018leak\u2019 without confirming whether it\u2019s an actual Google search document.\nFurther, even if the content originates from search, the information is a year old and could have changed. Any insights derived from the leaked documentation should not be considered actionable now.\nWith that in mind, while the full implications remain unknown, here\u2019s what we can glean from the leaked information.\n1. Emphasis On User Engagement Metrics\nIf click data and user engagement metrics are direct ranking factors, as the leaked documents suggest, it could place greater emphasis on optimizing for these metrics.\nThis means crafting compelling titles and meta descriptions to increase click-through rates, ensuring fast page loads and intuitive navigation to reduce bounces, and strategically linking to keep users engaged on your site.\nDriving traffic through other channels like social media and email can also help generate positive engagement signals.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that optimizing for user engagement shouldn\u2019t come at the expense of creating reader-focused content. Gaming engagement metrics are unlikely to be a sustainable, long-term strategy.\nGoogle has consistently emphasized the importance of quality and relevance in its public statements, and based on the leaked information, this will likely remain a key focus. Engagement optimization should support and enhance quality content, not replace it.\n2. Potential Changes To Link-Building Strategies\nThe leaked documents contain information about how Google treats different types of links and their impact on search rankings.\nThis includes details about the use of anchor text, the classification of links into different quality tiers based on traffic to the linking page, and the potential for links to be ignored or demoted based on various spam factors.\nIf this information is accurate, it could influence how SEO professionals approach link building and the types of links they prioritize.\nLinks that drive real click-throughs may carry more weight than links on rarely visited pages.\nThe fundamentals of good link building still apply\u2014create link-worthy content, build genuine relationships, and seek natural, editorially placed links that drive qualified referral traffic.\nThe leaked information doesn\u2019t change this core approach but offers some additional nuance to be aware of.\n3. Increased Focus On Brand Building and Driving Search Demand\nThe leaked documents suggest that Google uses brand-related signals and offline popularity as ranking factors. This could include metrics like brand mentions, searches for the brand name, and overall brand authority.\nAs a result, SEO strategies may emphasize building brand awareness and authority through both online and offline channels.\nTactics could include:\n- Securing brand mentions and links from authoritative media sources.\n- Investing in traditional PR, advertising, and sponsorships to increase brand awareness.\n- Encouraging branded searches through other marketing channels.\n- Optimizing for higher search volumes for your brand vs. unbranded keywords.\n- Building engaged social media communities around your brand.\n- Establishing thought leadership through original research, data, and industry contributions.\nThe idea is to make your brand synonymous with your niche and build an audience that seeks you out directly. The more people search for and engage with your brand, the stronger those brand signals may become in Google\u2019s systems.\n4. Adaptation To Vertical-Specific Ranking Factors\nSome leaked information suggests that Google may use different ranking factors or algorithms for specific search verticals, such as news, local search, travel, or e-commerce.\nIf this is the case, SEO strategies may need to adapt to each vertical\u2019s unique ranking signals and user intents.\nFor example, local search optimization may focus more heavily on factors like Google My Business listings, local reviews, and location-specific content.\nTravel SEO could emphasize collecting reviews, optimizing images, and directly providing booking/pricing information on your site.\nNews SEO requires focusing on timely, newsworthy content and optimized article structure.\nWhile the core principles of search optimization still apply, understanding your particular vertical\u2019s nuances, based on the leaked information and real-world testing, can give you a competitive advantage.\nThe leaks suggest a vertical-specific approach to SEO could give you an advantage.\nConclusion\nThe Google API documentation leak has created a vigorous discussion about Google\u2019s ranking systems.\nAs the SEO community continues to analyze and debate the leaked information, it\u2019s important to remember a few key things:\n- The information isn\u2019t fully verified and lacks context. Drawing definitive conclusions at this stage is premature.\n- Google\u2019s ranking algorithms are complex and constantly evolving. Even if entirely accurate, this leak only represents a snapshot in time.\n- The fundamentals of good SEO \u2013 creating high-quality, relevant, user-centric content and promoting it effectively \u2013 still apply regardless of the specific ranking factors at play.\n- Real-world testing and results should always precede theorizing based on incomplete information.\nWhat To Do Next\nAs an SEO professional, the best course of action is to stay informed about the leak.\nBecause details about the document remain unknown, it\u2019s not a good idea to consider any takeaways actionable.\nMost importantly, remember that chasing algorithms is a losing battle.\nThe only winning strategy in SEO is to make your website the best result for your message and audience. That\u2019s Google\u2019s endgame, and that\u2019s where your focus should be, regardless of what any particular leaked document suggests."

      "text": "One of a brand\u2019s greatest gifts is its ability to communicate with its prospects and customers through social communities.\nThese goldmines of customer sentiment and potential product or service positioning can provide every brand with a wealth of information.\nHowever, cultivating those communities and building the authenticity to engage with your customers takes time and effort.\nThis post will not tell you, \u201cHere\u2019s exactly how to do it,\u201d because every brand will have a different voice that it needs to leverage as well as different needs for its community.\nHowever, we will explore a framework you can leverage for your brand so that your conversations with customers and prospects are meaningful.\nHere are the main areas we will discuss in this article:\n- Value and tone \u2013 how to determine which ones are right for you.\n- Translating your message across channels and carrying your customers with you.\n- Owning whether engagement should be paid or organic.\nA final note before we dive in: this is not going to be a criticism or praise of any one particular channel. We intend to keep this as agnostic as possible, acknowledging that some brands will be more aligned with some channels than others.\nThis can be related to creative bandwidth, i.e., how much time you have to post and engage with a channel. It could also be related to whether you have the means to create video. There are a number of different criteria.\nJust know that whatever you decide to engage with, you do need to be consistent.\nValue & Tone\nA brand\u2019s values come down to who it is at its core. Some brands lean toward transparency and sharing all of the ins and outs of how they function. This can include what it\u2019s doing with its team and what the product/service roadmap looks like.\nOthers will focus far more on doing well by doing good, highlighting customer engagement in the community versus just what they are working on themselves.\nThere is no right or wrong answer to this. You need to make sure that you know what your brand\u2019s beating heart is and how the message you\u2019re sending ties back to that.\nComing up with your values is not something you should undertake lightly. Additionally, your team needs to agree on and comply with them.\nIf giving in the community is a core value, your team members shouldn\u2019t be caught posting things that make light of others\u2019 suffering.\nConversely, if part of your values relate to certain tech advancements, calling out those tech advancements in a negative light could be counterproductive.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t change your opinion and have reasons why your opinion shifts, but consistent communication is needed to reinforce the new value position.\nOne example is Semrush. Semrush used to have a different brand aesthetic, and there were questions about how to pronounce its brand name.\nThe company settled the debate once and for all with a very clear-cut statement. In doing so, it actually ruffled a few feathers because the community didn\u2019t like being told they were wrong.\nOn the other hand, Semrush ensured that its branding would be consistent moving forward. This was particularly useful as it prepared for its IPO.\nBurger King ran an ill-fated X (Twitter) campaign saying women belong in the kitchen.\nNow, most of us would know it\u2019s common sense that this could only have ended badly. However, the campaign intended to highlight the shortage of female chefs leading kitchen brigades and earning top dollar compared to their male counterparts.\nThe brand redeemed itself somewhat instead of representing a true failure because it acknowledged the mistake and then provided detailed information about what it had been trying to do.\nSo, while Burger King did fall down publicly as a brand, it paved the way for more attention to be shown to the cause.\nThank you to Purna Virji for highlighting this one and lots of other great examples in her book, \u201cHigh Impact Marketing.\u201d You can read chapter one of her book here.\nBoth of these cases provide a useful framework to consider how you want your values and tone to come across to your customers:\n- Are you comfortable poking fun at your customers and yourselves, or do you feel the need to be serious?\n- How quickly can you respond to customer sentiment shifts, and how much can you let that influence your risk tolerance and risk aversion?\n- How much should you be tied to public events versus how often should you create events based on industry, product, or service innovations?\nThe answers to all of these questions will help you build a framework that you can then take to each channel.\nYou are prepared to build a community, but these communities will need moderation, so you should only engage in a channel that you are prepared for.\nStaff will go through each major channel in a moment, but it is important to know that no matter how many you choose, successes tend to go unnoticed. Failures tend to be remembered indefinitely, and the greatest failure is not owning your brand.\nSo, even if you aren\u2019t prepared to engage with a channel, you should still at least claim your profile.\nTranslating Messages Across Channels\nWhen people talk about social media, they are typically referring to Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, TikTok, LinkedIn, X (Twitter), Snapchat, Pinterest, and Quora.\nHowever, how you actually engage with each of these channels or any additional ones that pop up, including login-based communities like Discord, Slack, and Tumblr, will all depend on how well-equipped your team is to engage with the pace of each channel.\nWe\u2019re going to break down each channel based on its pace, general tone, and creative flexibility.\nWhen engaging with these communities, it\u2019s important to note that you should claim your profile across all channels but only be active where you intend to be consistent and know your customers and prospects are or could be enticed to engage.\n- Tone: Generally casual and personal, but can vary depending on the content shared.\n- Pace: Moderate pace, with a mix of real-time updates and more evergreen content. Brands typically post 1-2 times per day to maintain visibility in the algorithm.\n- Creative Flexibility: Offers various content formats like text posts, images, videos, live streams, and Stories. Moderation includes adherence to community standards, which restricts certain types of content.\n- Community Management Tools: Provides features like Groups, Pages, and messaging for community management. Also offers insights and analytics for Page owners.\n- Tone: Visual and aesthetic-focused, often aspirational or inspirational.\n- Pace: Fast-paced, with a focus on real-time updates and Stories. Brands typically post at least once per day to maintain visibility.\n- Creative Flexibility: This category primarily includes visual content (photos and videos), with features like filters, stickers, and editing tools for creative expression. Moderation includes content guidelines and community standards enforcement.\n- Community Management Tools: Offers business profiles, analytics, and messaging for community management. Also, features like hashtags and tagging help in content discovery.\n- Tone: While mostly professional and formal, geared towards career development and networking, there is an appetite for B2B humor/memes.\n- Pace: The pace is generally slower, with more thoughtful and curated content. Brands typically post 2-5 times per week to maintain visibility. However, individuals post daily to maintain their presence in the feed.\n- Creative Flexibility: Primarily text-based posts, articles, and professional updates, with multimedia options. Moderation includes professional standards and restrictions on promotional content.\n- Community Management Tools: Provides tools for personal and business profiles, including messaging, groups, and analytics. Also offers job postings and networking features.\nTikTok:\n- Tone: Fun, entertaining, and often light-hearted or humorous.\n- Pace: Very fast-paced, with short-form videos designed for quick consumption. Brands typically post multiple times per day to maintain visibility.\n- Creative Flexibility: This is highly flexible, with a focus on short videos augmented with effects, filters, and music. Moderation includes enforcing community guidelines and restricting certain content types.\n- Community Management Tools: Offers features like Duets, reactions, comments, and hashtags for engagement. Also provides analytics for creators.\nX (Twitter)\n- Tone: Conversational, often informal, and concise due to character limit.\n- Pace: Fast-paced, with real-time updates and trending topics. Brands typically post multiple times per day to maintain visibility.\n- Creative Flexibility: Limited by character count but supports text, images, videos, and GIFs. Moderation includes adherence to Twitter rules and restrictions on sensitive content.\n- Community Management Tools: Features like retweets, replies, hashtags, and lists facilitate engagement and community building. Analytics and Twitter chats are also useful for community management.\n- Tone: Diverse, depending on the subreddit, but generally informal and community-driven.\n- Pace: This can vary, but it is often a mix of real-time discussions and slower-paced threads. Brands typically engage regularly but avoid spamming to maintain credibility.\n- Creative Flexibility: Supports various content types including text, images, links, and videos. Moderation includes subreddit-specific rules, enforced by moderators.\n- Community Management Tools: Moderation tools like banning, removing posts, and community guidelines enforcement. Subreddit creation and management, along with voting and commenting systems, are essential for community engagement.\nQuora\n- Tone: Informative and knowledge-focused, with an emphasis on sharing expertise.\n- Pace: Generally slower-paced, with longer-form questions and answers. Brands typically engage by answering relevant questions and participating in discussions.\n- Creative Flexibility: Primarily text-based, with options for including images and links. Image size: Varies based on Quora\u2019s formatting. Moderation includes adherence to Quora\u2019s policies and guidelines.\n- Community Management Tools: Moderation tools for questions, answers, and comments. Features like following topics, upvoting, and following users facilitate community interaction.\nDiscord\n- Tone: Varied depending on the server, but often casual and conversational.\n- Pace: Can range from slow-paced discussions to real-time chats and events. Brands typically maintain active presence but avoid overwhelming channels.\n- Creative Flexibility: Supports text, voice, and video communication, along with customizable server settings and bots for additional functionality. Moderation includes server-specific rules enforced by administrators.\n- Community Management Tools: Extensive moderation tools for roles, channels, permissions, and content moderation. Features like voice channels, emojis, and reaction roles enhance community engagement.\nSlack\n- Tone: Professional and work-focused, though it can be casual within specific channels or teams.\n- Pace: Typically moderate-paced, with real-time communication within teams. Brands typically engage regularly but avoid excessive messaging to maintain productivity.\n- Creative Flexibility: Primarily text-based, with options for file sharing, integrations, and custom emoji. Moderation includes adherence to team guidelines and restrictions on off-topic discussions.\n- Community Management Tools: Offers channel management, user roles, message deletion, and integrations with various apps and services for productivity and collaboration.\nWith each channel\u2019s baseline explored, we can now talk about translating messages across each.\nAs a general rule of thumb, text-based creative will translate fairly well across each, provided that you count for the character and or word count. Where it gets a little bit tougher is when you begin layering in visual content.\nThis is tough on two counts.\nFirst, there\u2019s pressure to create visual content because visual content tends to do better on social channels. However, there\u2019s also a difference in tone and formatting between the visual channels. For example, you can\u2019t always just recut a video you made for LinkedIn to be a TikTok video.\nWhile length is a factor, so are tone and subject matter expertise. While the ideas might be the same, you may need to repackage them for each channel.\nAdditionally, from a community standpoint, there are different algorithmic rules that go into each platform. So, if you have a community that\u2019s a little bit looser on language/sensitive topics, you may struggle to translate that community to channels with stricter guidelines.\nAn excellent example of this is that Facebook Groups tend to have stringent community rules based on bots identifying and removing posts.\nConversely, on platforms like Slack or Discord (i.e., private servers with a login), what\u2019s allowed is up to the server controller\u2019s discretion. So, if you know that your community will need that flexibility, you may decide to go for the password-gated community versus a more open group, such as LinkedIn or Facebook.\nDifferent communities have different algorithms for how content reaches users, so if you care that the content reaches your people specifically, you may need to tell them to check the group regularly.\nYou may also need to tell them to identify that your Group or your Page is of special interest to them so that they receive all updates from you as opposed to only getting it filtered through their feed. For example, when someone posts on LinkedIn, they can tell the system whether they want to see more or less from a particular person or group. This is true on Facebook as well.\nIf people consistently say that they don\u2019t want to hear from your Group, even if you have engaged members, you may struggle to have your content reach them organically without them coming to your community page.\nPaid Versus Organic\nWhen it comes to being real with your audience, you\u2019ve got to think about how you talk to them \u2013 whether you\u2019re paying for it or not. The key to being genuine lies in how you interact with the folks who support your brand.\nNo matter how you promote yourself, it\u2019s no accident that paid ads and sponsored content often let people leave comments and reactions. If you see lots of people engaging with a paid post, that\u2019s a sign you should also share some regular stuff. And if you respond to comments, you can reach even more people than you paid for \u2013 but there\u2019s a catch.\nPaying to show up where people haven\u2019t asked for you can sometimes annoy them instead of making them like you more.\nFor instance, imagine a brand keeps running ads on YouTube about something new, but it doesn\u2019t limit how often you see them. Then, the brand brings up the same thing in its online groups. Instead of getting a positive response, it might end up getting yelled at for being annoying because people are already tired of hearing about it.\nThe trick is listening to what your customers say while explaining how things work. For example, if you want to prevent your current customers from seeing your ads, you have to meet certain audience size requirements (1,000 for search-first platforms and 100 for social-first platforms).\nIf you can\u2019t, it\u2019s important to let them know it\u2019s not intentional \u2013 it\u2019s just how the system works.\nNow, about being genuine: Some say paid ads aren\u2019t as real as regular posts. But the truth is that many social platforms make a lot of money from boosting regular posts, so there\u2019s no shame in doing the same to reach more people.\nThe key is to know which posts are worth boosting and why. If a post looks okay on its own but doesn\u2019t quite fit your brand\u2019s style for ads, maybe hold off.\nAnd if a post is already doing great without any help, putting a \u201csponsored\u201d tag on it might make people trust it less. So, thinking about how your audience feels about ads is essential.\nFinding the right balance between paid and regular content means keeping it real with your audience and respecting their preferences. It\u2019s all about building trust and making sure your brand stays true to itself.\nFinal Takeaways\nBuilding authenticity is all about consistency and being useful to your people in the way that they want to be helped using a channel. Just because your competitors are is meaningless.\nIf your customers aren\u2019t there and if you\u2019re not able to engage with them in a way that lets you help them, the best way to confirm whether to be on a channel or not and whether to foster a community there or not is all down to how much can you be you while engaging with your customers?\nMore resources:\n- 20 Awesome Examples Of Social Media Marketing\n- Why Brand Awareness Is The Fifth Pillar Of SEO\n- Social Media Marketing: A Complete Strategy Guide\nFeatured Image: FabrikaSimf/Shutterstock"

      "text": "An updated report was published in 2023, which builds on the original research by showing how behavioural science principles can be applied in real-world marketing scenarios \u2014 at scale. Download \"Decoding Decisions: Marketing in the messy middle\" now.\nAlistair Rennie and Jonny Protheroe work on Google\u2019s consumer insights team, which means they spend a large part of their day exploring changes in consumer behaviour. Here they share their latest research on the buyer decision process.\nThe way people make decisions is messy \u2014 and it\u2019s only getting messier. Still, there are a few things we know about purchase behaviour. We know that what happens between trigger and purchase decision-making is not linear. We know there is a complicated web of touchpoints that differs from person to person. What is less clear however, is how shoppers process all of the information and choice they discover along the way. And what is critical, what we set out to understand with this new research, is how that process influences what people ultimately decide to buy.\nAs the internet has grown, it has transformed from a tool for comparing prices to a tool for comparing, well, everything. That\u2019s clear in how we\u2019ve seen purchase behaviour change over the years on Google Search. Take the terms \u201ccheap\u201d and \u201cbest.\u201d Worldwide, search interest for \u201cbest\u201d has far outpaced search interest for \u201ccheap.\u201d1 Those same dynamics hold true in countries around the world, like Germany, India, and Italy, for instance, when \u201ccheap\u201d and \u201cbest\u201d are translated into local languages.\nWorldwide search interest for \u201cbest\u201d vs. \u201ccheap\u201d\n-\nbest\n-\ncheap\nThe precise value of \u201ccheap\u201d may vary between individuals, but it still carries a singular meaning. \u201cBest,\u201d on the other hand, can have a wide range of meanings, including value, quality, performance, or popularity.\nThis is the kind of research behaviour that happens in the \u201cmessy middle\u201d between trigger and purchase. And as COVID-19 has accelerated online shopping and research around the world, it\u2019s more important than ever for brands to learn how to make sense of it.\nApplying behavioural sciences principles to the purchase decision process\nLast year we set out to update our perspective on consumer decision-making, and with the help of behavioural science experts, The Behavioural Architects, we started on a journey into decoding how consumers decide what to buy.\nWe conducted literary reviews, shopping observation studies, search trend analyses, and a large-scale experiment. Our aim was to understand how consumers make decisions in an online environment of abundant choice and limitless information. What we found was that people deal with scale and complexity by using cognitive biases encoded deep in their psychology.\nAs these biases existed long before the internet, we were curious to understand how they affect people\u2019s purchase decisions today.\nWhat happens in the messy middle? Two mental modes\nThrough the research, an updated decision-making model began to take shape. In the center of the model lies the messy middle \u2014 a complex space between triggers and purchase, where customers are won and lost.\nPeople look for information about a category\u2019s products and brands, and then weigh all the options. This equates to two different mental modes in the messy middle: exploration, an expansive activity, and evaluation, a reductive activity. Whatever a person is doing, across a huge array of online sources, such as search engines, social media, aggregators, and review websites, can be classified into one of these two mental modes.\nPeople loop through these twin modes of exploration and evaluation, repeating the cycle as many times as they need to make a purchase decision.\nCognitive biases that influence purchase behaviour and decision-making\nAs people explore and evaluate in the messy middle, cognitive biases shape their shopping behaviour and influence why they choose one product over another. While many hundreds of these biases exist, we prioritised six in our research:\n6 biases that influence purchase decisions\n- Category heuristics: Short descriptions of key product specifications can simplify purchase decisions.\n- Power of now: The longer you have to wait for a product, the weaker the proposition becomes.\n- Social proof: Recommendations and reviews from others can be very persuasive.\n- Scarcity bias: As stock or availability of a product decreases, the more desirable it becomes.\n- Authority bias: Being swayed by an expert or trusted source.\n- Power of free: A free gift with a purchase, even if unrelated, can be a powerful motivator.\nThese biases formed the basis for our large-scale shopping experiment with real in-market shoppers simulating 310,000 purchase scenarios across financial services, consumer packaged goods, retail, travel, and utilities.\nIn the experiment, shoppers were asked to pick their first and second favourite brands within a category, and then a range of biases were applied to see if people would switch their preference from one brand to another. To test an extreme scenario, the experiments also included a fictional brand in each category, to which shoppers had zero prior exposure.\nThe results showed that even the least effective challenger, a fictional cereal brand, still managed to win 28% of shopper preference from the established favourite when it was \u201csupercharged\u201d with benefits, including five-star reviews and an offer of 20% extra for free. And in the most extreme case, a fictional car insurer won 87% share of consumer preference when supercharged with advantages across all six biases.\nThe experiment showed that, when applied intelligently and responsibly, behavioural science principles \u2014 and the behavioural and informational needs they align with \u2014 are powerful tools for winning and defending consumer preference in the messy middle.\nHow marketers can succeed in the messy middle\nAlthough the messy middle might seem a complicated place, it\u2019s important to remember that to consumers it just feels like normal shopping. The goal isn\u2019t to force people to exit the loop shown in the model, but to provide them with the information and reassurance they need to make a decision.\nLuckily, whether you\u2019re a category giant or a challenger brand, the approach is the same:\n- Ensure brand presence so your product or service is strategically front of mind while your customers explore.\n- Employ behavioural science principles intelligently and responsibly to make your proposition compelling as consumers evaluate their options.\n- Close the gap between trigger and purchase so your existing and potential customers spend less time exposed to competitor brands.\n- Build flexible, empowered teams who can work cross-functionally to avoid traditional branding and performance silos that are likely to leave gaps in the messy middle.\nDownload the full report for a complete understanding of the messy middle, the behavioural science principles we examined, and recommendations for how brands can apply them."

      "text": "The search landscape undergoes its biggest shift in a generation.\nIf you\u2019ve been in SEO long enough to remember the glory days of the all-organic search engine results pages (SERP), you\u2019ll know how much of this real estate has been gradually taken over by paid ads, other first-party products, and rich snippets.\nNow, the most aggressive transition of all: AI Overviews (as well as search-based large language model platforms).\nAt BrightonSEO last month, I explored how this evolution is forcing us to rethink what SEO means and why discoverability, not just ranking, is the new north star.\nThe \u201cDawn\u201d Of The Zero-Click Isn\u2019t Just Over \u2013 It\u2019s Now Assumed\nWe\u2019ve been reading about the rise of zero-click searches for some time now, but this \u201ctakeover\u201d has been much more noticeable over the past 12 months.\nI recently searched [how to teach my child to tell the time], and after scrolling through a parade of paid product ads, Google-owned assets, and the AI Overview summaries, I scrolled a good three pages down the SERP.\nGoogle and other search and discovery platforms want to keep users in their ecosystems. For SEO pros, this means traditional metrics such as click-through rate (CTR) are becoming less valuable by the day.\nFrom Answer Engines To Assistant Engines\nLLMs have changed not just the way a result is displayed to the user but also changed the traditional search flow born within the browser into a multi-step flow that the native SERP simply cannot support in the same way.\nThe research process is collapsing into a single, seamless exchange.\nBut as technology accelerates, our own curiosity and research skills are at risk of declining or disappearing completely as the evolution of technology exponentially grows.\nAssistant engines and wider LLMs are the new gatekeepers between our content and the person discovering that content \u2013 our potential \u201cnew audience.\u201d\nThey parse, consume, understand, and then synthesize content, which is the deciding factor in what it mentions to whom/what it interacts with.\nStructured data is still crucial, as context, transparency, and sentiment matter more than ever.\nChallenges Are Different, But Also The Same\nAs an SEO, our challenges with this new behavior affect the way we do \u2013 and report on \u2013 our jobs.\nIn reality, many are just old headaches in shiny new wrappers:\n- Attribution is a mess: With AI Overviews and LLMs synthesizing content, it\u2019s harder than ever to see where your traffic comes from \u2013 or if you\u2019re getting any at all. There are some tools out there that do monitor, but we\u2019re in the early days to see a standard. Even Google said they have no plans on adding insights on AIO within Search Console.\n- Traffic is fragmenting (again): We saw this with social media platforms at the beginning, where discovery happened outside the organic SERPs. Discovery is now happening everywhere, all at once. With attribution also harder to ascertain, this is a bigger challenge today.\n- Budgets are under scrutiny from fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD): The native SERP is changing too much, so some may assume there\u2019s less (or no) value in doing SEO much anymore (untrue!).\nThe Shift Of Success Metrics\nThe days of our current success metrics are dwindling. The days of vanity-led metrics are coming to an end.\nSimilar to how our challenges are the same but different, this also applies to how we redefine success metrics:\n| Old Hat | New Hat |\n| Content | Context + sentiment |\n| Keywords | Intent |\n| Brand | Brand + sentiment |\n| Rankings | Mentions |\n| Links from external sources | Citations across various channels |\n| SERP monopoly | Share of voice |\n| E-E-A-T | Still E-E-A-T |\n| Structured data | Entities, knowledge graph & vector embeds |\n| Answering | Assisting |\nWhat Can You Do About It?\nInformation can be aggregated, but personality can\u2019t. This is why it\u2019s still our responsibility to help \u201cassist the assistant\u201d to consider and include you as part of that aggregated information and synthesized answer.\n- Stick to the fundamentals: Never neglect SEO 101.\n- Third-party perspective is increasingly important, so ensure this is maintained and managed well to ensure positive brand sentiment.\n- Embrace structured data: Even if some say it\u2019s becoming less crucial for LLMs to understand entities, structured data is being used right now inside major LLMs to output structured data within responses, giving them an established and standardised way to understand your content.\n- Educate stakeholders: Shift the conversation from rankings and clicks to discoverability and brand presence. The days of the branded unlinked mention suddenly have more value than \u201cacquiring X followed non-branded anchor text links pcm.\u201d\n- Experiment with your content: Try new ways to produce and market your content beyond the traditional word. Here, video is useful not only for humans but also for LLMs, who are now \u201cwatching\u201d and understanding them to aid their response.\n- Create helpful, unique content: To add to the above, don\u2019t produce for the sake of production.\nLLMs.txt: The Potential To Be The New Standard\nKeep an eye on emerging standards proposals, such as llms.txt, which is one way some are adapting and contributing to how LLMs ingest our content beyond our traditional approaches offered with robots.txt and XML sitemaps.\nWhile some are skeptical about this standard, I believe it is still something worth implementing now, and I understand its true benefits for the future.\nThere is (virtually) non-existent risk in implementing something that doesn\u2019t take too much time or resources to produce, so long as you\u2019re doing so with a white hat approach.\nConclusion: Embrace Discoverability And New Metrics\nSEO isn\u2019t dead. It\u2019s expanding, but at a rate we haven\u2019t experienced before.\nDiscoverability is the new go-to success metric, but it\u2019s not without flaws, especially as the way we search continues to change.\nThis is no longer about \u201cranking well\u201d anymore. This is now about being understood, surfaced, trusted, and discovered across every platform and assistant that matters.\nEmbrace and adapt to the changes, as it\u2019s going to continue for some time.\nMore Resources:\nFeatured Image: PeopleImages.com \u2013 Yuri A/Shutterstock"
