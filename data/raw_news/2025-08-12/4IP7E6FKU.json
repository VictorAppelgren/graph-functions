  "description": "Steelers cornerback Jalen Ramsey discussed his departure from the Dolphins",
  "content": "Former Dolphins cornerback Jalen Ramsey reportedly disrespected coach Mike McDaniel by showing up late to practices or meetings on multiple occasions.\n\nSo it was curious when Ramsey said this week that he wanted to play for a team \u201cwhere there\u2019s a lot of respect for the head coach.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, Ramsey did not publicly say that there is a lack of respect for Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel. But that could be inferred from how he phrased his comments on The Pivot podcast.\n\nRamsey also indicated the trade to the Steelers was a positive because he was able to join \u201ca team that\u2019s going to be able to compete.\u201d\n\nThough Ramsey made clear to the Dolphins that he wanted out, the team said it was a mutual decision.\n\nDolphins tight end Tanner Conner, without naming names, said last month that \u201cMike hasn\u2019t changed at all. I think maybe the emphasis around him and respecting him more as players has changed as we\u2019ve gotten some players out who might have not been as respectful.\u201d\n\nRamsey offered one bit of praise for the Dolphins, saying \u201cI do appreciate the Dolphins and them working with me and\u201d his agent, David Mulugheta, and \u201cnot just [saying] this team called and we are going to send you there. It was very open communication. You all have been good to us. I\u2019ve been good to ya\u2019all.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to a team that\u2019s going to be able to compete, where there\u2019s a lot of respect for the head coach and the staff and a place I can continue to play at a high level\u2026 and maybe be versatile\u2026 We all had to come to a consensus on what it would be. The Steelers wanted me here, and I wanted to be here.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201che prayed to God\u201d when mulling his future this offseason, indicated that he asked God to \u201cplease reveal what you want from me.\u201d\n\nRamsey\u2019s comments on the podcast marked the first time he has publicly discussed the Dolphins since general manager Chris Grier disclosed in April that the team would try to trade him.\n\nOn the first night of the draft, he posted a photo of rotten oranges, alongside a caption that read as an indictment of the Dolphins organization.\n\n\u201cWho you surround yourself with matters,\u201d the first part of the caption read, followed by a short inscription underneath the picture that said \u201cIf you surround yourself with people who are okay with mediocre, you too will start to be okay with it... surround yourself with people who desire GREATNESS!\u201d\n\nOn June 30, Miami dealt two disgruntled players -- Ramsey and tight Jonnu Smith -- and a 2027 seventh-round pick to the Steelers. In return, Miami received former Pro Bowl safety Fitzpatrick (who was the Dolphins\u2019 2018 first-round pick), as well as a 2027 fifth-round pick.\n\nSmith preferred to stay in Miami but prioritized getting a better contract and remained away from the team\u2019s offseason program in search of one.\n\nAs part of the trade, Ramsey received a $1.5 million raise this season, increasing his salary to $26.6 million, and the Dolphins agreed to pay $7 million of that total salary.\n\nRamsey, 30, has played for the Jaguars (who selected him fifth overall out of FSU in 2016), Rams and Dolphins during a nine-year career. But he became disgruntled in Jacksonville and was traded to the Rams in October 2019.\n\nIn March of 2023, the Rams shipped him to Miami for a third-round pick and tight end Hunter Long. \u201cWhen I got traded from L.A., I was literally praying to go to Miami,\u201d Ramsey said on the podcast. \u201cIt was probably not for all the right reasons. Football will always be very important for me.\n\n\u201cBut I had other things in the back of my mind. I want to live in a good city, want my kids to enjoy life, be in the sun... I want my family to like coming to visit me. It was other stuff that added on to that as well.\u201d\n\nRamsey sustained a torn meniscus during his first Dolphins training camp and made his Dolphins debut on Oct. 28 of that 2024 season.\n\nLast year, he was ranked 25th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 player list.\n\nLast September, the Dolphins signed Ramsey to a three\u2013year, $72.3 million contract extension that included $24.3 million guaranteed upon signing, making him the highest-paid cornerback in the NFL. He asked out less than six months later.",
