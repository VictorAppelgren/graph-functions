      "summary": "The U.S. District Court’s ruling in the antitrust case against Google eliminates exclusive contracts for its search, Chrome, Assistant, and Gemini products, while allowing Google to continue charging for default placement. The decision keeps Google’s paid default revenue streams intact—Apple and other partners can still collect significant fees—while opening the market to rivals through data sharing and syndication. The order has boosted Alphabet’s stock and reinforced Apple’s position, but critics argue it falls short of fully dismantling Google’s dominance and may require further regulatory action.",
