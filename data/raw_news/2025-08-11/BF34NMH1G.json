  "content": "Intel Corp INTC shares are rising in Monday\u2019s after-hours session following a change in tone from President Donald Trump after a meeting with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan at the White House.\n\nINTC is up after-hours. See what\u2019s happening now.\n\nWhat Happened: Trump called on Tan to resign from Intel last week after Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) raised concerns about his potential ties to China.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Thursday, Trump said the Intel CEO is \u201chighly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,\u201d adding that there were no other solutions.\n\nTan met with Trump on Monday in what appears to have been a productive meeting. Trump posted late Monday that the meeting was \u201cvery interesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis success and rise is an amazing story. Mr. Tan and my Cabinet members are going to spend time together, and bring suggestions to me during the next week,\u201d Trump wrote in the post.\n\nTan has been a director at Intel since 2022 and he took over as CEO earlier this year after former CEO Pat Gelsinger was forced out by the board following a lack of turnaround progress.\n\nIntel said in a statement last week that the company was \u201cdeeply committed\u201d to working with Trump to advance U.S. national and economic security interests and was looking forward to continued engagement with the Trump administration.\n\nINTC Price Action: Intel shares were up 2.76% in extended trading Monday, trading at $21.25 at the time of publication, according to Benzinga Pro.",

      "text": "President Donald Trump called for the immediate resignation of Intel INTC CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, citing a conflict of interest.\nTrump took to his Truth Social on Thursday to express his opinion on the current situation at Intel. He stated that the CEO of the chipmaker is in a conflicted position and should step down. The post read, \u201cThe CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem.\u201d\nCheck out the current price of INTC stock here.\nTrump\u2019s comments come in the wake of growing Republican concerns about Tan\u2019s alleged ties to China. Senator Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) has previously demanded answers from Intel regarding potential national security risks posed by Tan\u2019s Chinese investments. These concerns have been amplified by Intel\u2019s recent $8 billion federal grant under the CHIPS Act.\nSEE ALSO: Tom Lee: Ethereum Is Having A \u20182017 Bitcoin Moment\u2019, Could Hit $15,000 By End Of 2025\nIntel\u2019s 18A Chip Woes Deepen Foundry Loss Concerns\nTrump\u2019s call for Tan\u2019s resignation adds to the growing pressure on Intel\u2019s CEO. The company has been facing a series of challenges, including a recent quality setback in its high-stakes 18A chip project. This setback has raised concerns about Intel\u2019s ability to profitably produce advanced chips, a critical part of its plan to become a top-tier foundry rivaling Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co TSM.\nThe controversy surrounding Tan has been fueled by Intel\u2019s financial struggles. Despite receiving $8.5 billion in U.S. CHIPS Act subsidies, Intel reported a staggering $18.8 billion loss in its foundry division in 2024. CNBC\u2019s \u201cMad Money\u201d host Jim Cramer has questioned the sustainability of domestic semiconductor manufacturing in light of Intel\u2019s losses.\nDuring the pre-market trading session on Thursday, Intel stock fell 3.72%.

See how to find it live on Wednesday \u2192\nIntel Corp INTC CEO Pat Gelsinger announced his retirement on Monday. Reports indicate the Intel chief was forced out by Intel\u2019s board, which had grown frustrated with Gelsinger\u2019s turnaround progress.\nWhat Happened: According to a Bloomberg report citing people familiar with the matter, Gelsinger was given the option to retire or be removed from Intel after the company\u2019s board expressed its dissatisfaction with the company\u2019s progress on winning back market share from Nvidia Corp NVDA.\nIntel has named David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus as interim co-CEOs while the board conducts a search for a new chief executive, the company said in a statement. Frank Yeary, independent chair of Intel's board, will become interim executive chair during the transition period.\nGelsinger began working for Intel when he was a teenager before leaving in 2009 to become CEO of VMWare. He returned to Intel in 2021 and laid out plans to revive the chipmaker\u2019s manufacturing lead against rivals, but the turnaround efforts have failed to materialize.\nIntel shares jumped more than 4% Monday morning on news of Gelsinger\u2019s departure before pulling back. The stock is still down more than 51% year-to-date, according to Benzinga Pro.\n\u201cThe stock lost more than 60% under his tenure, so this shouldn't have come as a very big surprise,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for Carson Group, according to Reuters.\nDetrick noted that all of Gelsinger\u2019s major strategic decisions could now head to the chopping block, including his decision to focus on contract manufacturing.\nCheck This Out: Tech Stocks Rise, Apple Tops Record Highs, Dollar Surges, Bitcoin Falls To $95,000: What\u2019s Driving Markets Monday?\nInvestors appear to be cheering Gelsinger\u2019s departure on hopes the company could lean into more aggressive strategy changes under new leadership.\n\u201cThis move opens the door for a new strategy, which we've been advocating for some time,\u201d said Wolfe Research\u2019s Chris Caso.\n\u201cWhile Gelsinger was generally successful in advancing Intel's process road map, we don't believe that Intel has the scale to pursue leading edge manufacturing on its own given Intel's absence from AI.\u201d\nWhile Intel has lagged the broader market, other chipmakers like Nvidia have seen their stocks soar since the start of the year on roaring demand for AI chips.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, you need leading-edge products, innovation, and execution, none of which we saw during Pat Gelsinger\u2019s reign,\u201d Rosenblatt\u2019s Hans Mosesmann reportedly said.\nINTC Price Action: Intel shares initially traded up to around the $25.40 level before pulling back and turning negative for the session. The stock was down 0.71% at $23.88 at the time of publication, according to Benzinga Pro.\nRead Next:\nPhoto: Shutterstock.\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
