  "description": "A recent coronal mass ejection is expected to disrupt Earth\u2019s geomagnetic field.",
  "content": "More than a dozen states in the northern U.S. might have an opportunity to see the northern lights Thursday, as a recent coronal mass ejection is expected to disrupt Earth\u2019s geomagnetic field, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nNOAA forecast a Kp index of six on a scale of nine for Thursday night, suggesting aurora borealis will move farther from the poles and become \u201cquite bright and active.\u201d Thursday\u2019s auroral forecast comes as minor to moderate geomagnetic storms are expected Thursday night and early Friday morning, which NOAA said are the result of a coronal mass ejection emitted from the sun on Aug. 5. Similar auroral activity is expected Friday night and early Saturday morning as minor geomagnetic storms are forecast, with a maximum Kp index of five forecast, according to NOAA\u2019s three-day outlook.\n\nWhere Will The Northern Lights Be Visible?\n\nNorthern Canada and Alaska will have the highest chance to view the northern lights once the sun sets in the state. A view line marking a minimal opportunity sweeps through Iowa and northern Illinois, with a lesser chance forecast for parts of Washington, Montana, Idaho, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Upper Michigan, and an even lower opportunity expected for parts of Oregon, Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska, New York, New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine. (See map below.)\n\nWhat\u2019s The Best Way To See The Northern Lights?\n\nNOAA recommends traveling to a north-facing, high vantage point away from light pollution sometime between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. local time.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Best Way To Photograph The Northern Lights?\n\nWith a smartphone, NOAA suggests enabling night mode, disabling flash and using a tripod to stabilize the image. If using a regular camera, photography experts told National Geographic it\u2019s best to use a wide-angle lens, an aperture or F-stop of four or less and a focus set to the furthest possible setting.\n\nIncreased auroral activity is expected to persist into early 2026 after activity on the sun\u2019s surface achieved a \u201csolar maximum\u201d in 2024, NOAA and NASA said. This peak features more solar events like coronal mass ejections and solar flares, which are largely responsible for creating the northern lights. Electrons from these events collide with molecules of oxygen and nitrogen in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, causing them to become \u201cexcited\u201d before releasing energy in the form of colorful, swirling lights.",

      "text": "Topline\nAn uptick in activity on the sun\u2019s surface this year produced the strongest displays of aurora borealis in the last 500 years, according to NASA, but not to worry if you missed the chance to see the Northern Lights this year\u2014forecasters believe that peak will persist through 2025 and into early 2026.\nKey Facts\nNASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced in October that the sun\u2019s 11-year cycle had reached a \u201csolar maximum,\u201d increasing the rate of space weather events like electromagnetic radiation, or solar flares, and bubbles of plasma that burst along with those flares, or coronal mass ejections.\nSolar activity has exceeded expectations during this peak, according to NASA, which expects the \u201csolar maximum\u201d to continue into 2026 before decreasing through 2030.\nIn May, NASA said it tracked the strongest geomagnetic storm to reach Earth in two decades\u2014caused by multiple solar flares and at least seven coronal mass ejections\u2014resulting in possibly the strongest northern lights displays \u201cin the past 500 years.\u201d\nSolar activity picked up in the following months before the peak, according to NASA, with the most powerful flare of the solar cycle occurring on Oct. 3, an event that forecasters warned would significantly impact radio communications, electric power grids, navigation signals and pose risks to spacecraft and astronauts.\nA \u201csevere\u201d geomagnetic storm was forecast on Oct. 11, when aurora borealis displays became visible as far south as northern Florida.\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines. Text \u201cAlerts\u201d to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\nWhere Will The Northern Lights Be Visible In 2025?\nNorthern lights displays are most visible in Alaska and northern Canada for most of the year, though the severity of solar events frequently pulls the phenomenon below the Canadian border. A \u201cquiet\u201d display\u2014occurring about two times each week during the \u201csolar maximum\u201d\u2014is more visible in northern U.S. states like Washington, Idaho, North Dakota and Minnesota, with a lower likelihood in parts of South Dakota, Wisconsin and Upper Michigan, according to NOAA. More states have an opportunity to view during \u201cmoderate\u201d auroras, with a view line\u2014marking a minimal chance to see the phenomenon\u2014arching through areas in Wyoming, northern New York and Maine. An \u201cactive\u201d aurora, the result of a \u201cstrong\u201d geomagnetic storm, pushes the northern lights to Oregon, Nebraska, Iowa, New Hampshire, Vermont and Illinois. Should auroral activity become \u201cvery active\u201d similar to northern lights displays in May and October, several more states could have a chance to see the phenomenon, though it depends on the severity of the geomagnetic storm.\nWhere Were The Northern Lights Most Visible In 2024?\nThe northern lights frequently appear in the night sky above Alaska regardless of solar activity, according to NOAA\u2019s analysis. During weaker solar events, North Dakota is more likely to experience the phenomenon than any other state, while states like Washington and Minnesota and parts of northern Idaho by the Canadian border have opportunities multiple times a month. Brand USA, an organization tasked by U.S. officials with promoting tourism, recommends traveling to Idaho, Alaska, Maine, Minnesota and Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula as the best locations to see auroral activity. In October and May, the northern lights were pulled even further south, with the spectacle viewed in northern Florida, California, Texas and Kansas. During these two events, auroral activity was captured over the New York City skyline and across most of the northern U.S., including in some areas where the northern lights aren\u2019t normally seen, like Detroit.\nWhat\u2019s The Best Way To See The Northern Lights?\nAuroral activity is best seen between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. local time while at a high vantage point away from light pollution, according to NOAA. The displays can be seen from as much as 620 miles away if conditions are optimal.\nWhat\u2019s The Best Way To Photograph The Northern Lights?\nSmartphone cameras are more sensitive to the colors of the aurora and can capture the northern lights if night mode is enabled, even if the event isn\u2019t visible to the naked eye, according to NASA. If using a regular camera, National Geographic recommends using a wide-angle lens, high ISO value and focus set to the farthest possible setting.\nWhat To Watch For\nNASA and other aeronautics agencies have signaled an increase in missions over the next few years to better understand space weather and its effects. NASA\u2019s Parker Solar Probe mission will make its closest-ever approach to the sun this month and plans to make three other approaches to understand space weather \u201cright at the source.\u201d The European Space Agency launched its Proba-3 mission on Dec. 5 to create the first artificial solar eclipses. The mission consists of two satellites that will travel in an elliptical orbit above Earth for the next two years, allowing scientists to study aspects of the sun\u2019s surface, including why the outer atmosphere is hotter than the sun itself, coronal mass ejections and how solar winds accelerate. The first images from this mission are expected to be released by the ESA in March.\nKey Background\nAurora borealis, a display of swirling, colorful lights in the night sky, are the result of activity on the sun\u2019s surface. Electrons from solar flares and coronal mass ejections interact with the oxygen and nitrogen in Earth\u2019s atmosphere, causing atoms and molecules of these gases to become \u201cexcited\u201d before releasing small bursts of energy in the form of light, according to NASA. Activity on the sun\u2019s surface is measured over 11 years and gradually increases and decreases during this period, achieving a \u201csolar maximum\u201d and a \u201csolar minimum.\u201d NASA said it intends to better understand the effects of events like solar flares and coronal mass ejections, including measuring how Earth\u2019s atmosphere responds to energy influxes that occur during more severe events. A better understanding of space weather will be \u201cvaluable\u201d to send astronauts to the moon and Mars, NASA said."

      "text": "This is a prediction of the intensity and location of the aurora borealis tonight and tomorrow night over North America. It also shows a 'viewline' that represents the southern-most locations from which you may see the aurora on the northern horizon. This product is based on the OVATION model and uses the maximum forecast geomagnetic activity (Kp) between 6pm and 6am US Central Time. The images are updated continuously, with the transition when \"tomorrow night\" becomes \"tonight\" occurring at 12:00Z (i.e., within an hour of the end of the 6pm-6am Central Time window that is used here to define \"night\").\nThe two maps show the aurora and viewline tonight and tomorrow night. The brightness and location of the aurora is typically shown as a green oval centered on Earth\u2019s magnetic pole. The green ovals turn red when the aurora is forecast to be more intense. Aurora can often be observed somewhere on Earth from just after sunset or just before sunrise. The aurora is not visible during daylight hours. The aurora does not need to be directly overhead but can be observed from as much as 1000 km away when the aurora is bright and if conditions are right.\nA short term forecast (~30 minutes) along with the last 24 hours of activity can be found on the Aurora - 30 Minute Forecast page. And SWPC's new Aurora Dashboard (Experimental) collects the products and information from across SWPC's website for a one-stop shop.\nThe OVATION (Oval Variation, Assessment, Tracking, Intensity, and Online Nowcasting) model is an empirical model of the intensity of the aurora developed at the Johns Hopkins University, Applied Physics Laboratory by Patrick Newell and co-workers[1]. For tonight's and tomorrow night's aurora viewline prediction the SWPC 3-Day Geomagnetic Forecast (Kp index) is used to drive the OVATION model. The model uses maximum forecast geomagnetic activity (Kp) between 6pm and 6am US Central Time tonight and tomorrow night\nFor more information on the OVATION model and aurora products, see:\n- Newell, P.
