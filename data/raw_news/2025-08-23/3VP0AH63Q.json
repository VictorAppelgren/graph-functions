  "content": "What\u2019s the difference between a credit score and a credit report, and how does each affect my finances?\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you know about your credit, it\u2019s that it has to be good. That may sound like a glib assessment, but the closer your credit score gets to 850, the easier it is to hit many of your life goals \u2014 like buying a car or renting the apartment of your dreams. Need a loan for anything, such as a home or a new business? The higher your score, the lower your interest rate is likely to be. So much you need to move through your life \u2014 and master your personal finances \u2014 depends on your credit.\n\nFor You: Paying in Full vs. Partial Payments: Which Is Best for Your Credit Score?\n\nLearn More: 3 Advanced Investing Moves Experts Use to Minimize Taxes and Help Boost Returns\n\nAs you work to raise that number, you\u2019ve probably come across the terms \u201ccredit score\u201d and \u201ccredit report.\u201d At first glance, they may seem interchangeable \u2014 but they\u2019re not. They\u2019re closely related, but they have a few key differences. Understanding these differences can help you improve your credit.\n\nTo break it all down, GOBankingRates caught up with Jay Zigmont, Ph.D., CFP, and founder of Childfree Wealth.\n\nWhen it comes to understanding credit, this is the million-dollar question. As Zigmont explains: \u201cYour credit report is a list of all your accounts, payment records and basic information about you. Your credit score analyzes your credit report against a rating system.\u201d\n\nIn essence, think of your credit report like a financial transcript \u2014 a detailed record of your history as a borrower. It includes your credit card accounts, loans, payment history, as well as any delinquencies or defaults. Or, if you\u2019re a spy movie fan, it\u2019s your financial dossier, showing how you\u2019ve treated credit over time.\n\nSo who compiles this data? Three major credit bureaus \u2014 Equifax, Experian and TransUnion \u2014 collect this information based on what your various lenders report to them. Each bureau may have slightly different data, so your reports (and scores) might not be exactly the same from bureau to bureau.\n\nYour credit score, on the other hand, is a three-digit number calculated based on the data within your credit report. It\u2019s a kind of shorthand for lenders to determine how risky or reliable you are as a borrower. The most commonly used scoring model is the FICO Score, which ranges from 300 to 850.\n\nRead Next: The No. 1 Mistake That Can Tank Your Credit Score 100 Points Instantly\n\nOK, you say \u2014 now I know the difference between a credit score and a credit report. But does it actually matter when applying for a car loan or credit card? Zigmont says yes, and here\u2019s why:\n\n\u201cEach bank or loan may use different credit score systems, and may pull from all three bureaus or just one,\u201d he said. \u201cSince they use different scoring systems, they may have different cutoffs. In general, the higher your credit score, the better your loan terms will be.\u201d\n\nIn other words, your credit score is only part of the picture. Imagine you\u2019ve just applied for a car loan. Your lender might not look at your score alone; they\u2019ll likely review your full credit report to get the context behind that number. A score alone won\u2019t reveal things like delayed payments or even a recent bankruptcy. Lenders want a holistic view of what they can expect from you, and a credit report gives them just that.\n\nTo avoid any surprises in your loan application process, you\u2019ll want to regularly review your credit reports across all three bureaus. This will enable you to catch inaccuracies, resolve any issues and spot potential signs of identity theft before they can hurt your score, or worse, interfere with your ability to get approved for a loan.\n\nHow To Improve Your Credit Score by Strengthening Your Report\n\nYour credit report is like the soil in which your score can bloom \u2014 or perhaps wither on the vine, depending on how well you tend to that soil. If you nurture that soil with healthy financial habits, your score will thrive.\n\nStart by reviewing your report. If you\u2019ve been dinged for late payments, make on-time payments your top priority. Next, focus on paying down any existing debt, especially on revolving credit, like credit cards, and aim to use less than 30% of your available credit. This is known as credit utilization, and it has a significant impact on your score.\n\nAlso, avoid opening new credit accounts right before applying for a major loan. A new application results in a hard inquiry, which can cause a small, temporary dip in your score.\n\n\u201cPaying off your credit cards will have the biggest impact on your credit score, and you can see the impact in a month,\u201d Zigmont said. \u201cOver time, you need to focus on paying on time, not taking out credit unless you absolutely need it, and keeping your total utilization low.\u201d\n\nNo, your credit score and credit report aren\u2019t the same thing \u2014 but they are closely related. Your score reflects what\u2019s in your report, so you should check it regularly to ensure it\u2019s accurate.\n\nThink of your credit report as the raw data, and your score as the grade. Both play a big role in whether you can borrow money, rent a place to live or even get hired \u2014 so understanding how they work together is a crucial part of achieving long-term financial success.\n\nThis article is part of GOBankingRates\u2019 Top 100 Money Experts series, where we spotlight expert answers to the biggest financial questions Americans are asking.

You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nWhen it comes to investing, it\u2019s not just about what you earn \u2014 it\u2019s also about what you keep. While taxes shouldn\u2019t be the sole focus of your investment strategy, they can take a serious chunk out of your returns if you\u2019re not careful.\nThat\u2019s why the most seasoned investors focus on advanced strategies designed to minimize their tax bill and help boost what stays in their portfolio.\nKeep more of what you earn with Betterment\u2019s tax-saving tech. You may not notice Betterment\u2019s tax-saving tech at work, but your after-tax returns will. Help minimize your tax impact and maximize your investment returns. Be a tax-smart investor. Learn more.\nIf you\u2019re a long-term investor who wants to grow your wealth the smart way, consider using these six strategies:\n1. Tax Loss Harvesting \u2014 Helps Offset Capital Gains\nThe stock market ebbs and flows. It can\u2019t be predicted. So it\u2019s inevitable that even the best portfolios will experience losses. That\u2019s where tax loss harvesting can be a smart strategy.\nTax loss harvesting is the practice of selling a security that has experienced a loss. By realizing, or \u201charvesting\u201d a loss, investors are able to offset taxes on both gains and income. The sold security is replaced by a similar one, ideally maintaining an optimal asset allocation and expected returns.\nThe losses can then be used to offset capital gains and potentially reduce ordinary income by up to $3,000 annually, with remaining losses carried forward.\nTurn market losses into potential tax wins. Betterment\u2019s automated tax tools use investment losses to help offset gains, potentially lowering your tax bill. Make the most of market dips. Learn more.\n2. Tax-Coordinated Portfolio \u2014 Make Sure You\u2019re as Tax-Efficient As Possible\nIf you\u2019re investing across different types of accounts \u2014 say a traditional IRA, Roth IRA, and a taxable brokerage account \u2014 it\u2019s wise to strategically organize your assets according to their tax efficiency. You generally want to place less tax-efficient assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient assets in taxable accounts.\nThe goal here is to minimize the taxes you\u2019ll pay on investment growth. But this can be complicated to do on your own.\nInvest like a tax pro. Betterment\u2019s asset location strategy is designed to improve your after-tax returns year round \u2014 helping you keep more of what you earn. Save on taxes. Learn more.\n3. Charitable Giving Made Tax-Efficient\nPlanning to give back? Donating appreciated securities can reduce your capital gains taxes and allow you to deduct the full value of the donation, assuming you itemize.\nIt\u2019s a powerful way to support causes you care about while getting a potential tax break in return.\nBottom Line\nTaking advantage of tax-smart strategies can help maximize your investment returns and keep more of your returns in your portfolio.\nYou may think about your taxes one day a year. Betterment thinks about them all year. Smarter investing starts with tax-saving tech that works all year round. Keep more of what you earn. Learn more.\nBetterment is not a tax advisor, nor should any information herein be considered tax advice. Please consult a qualified tax professional.

      "text": "The No. 1 Mistake That Can Tank Your Credit Score 100 Points Instantly\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nA good credit score is the foundation of a healthy financial life. Without a good credit score, you\u2019ll pay more to borrow money, get locked out of the best offers and even struggle to rent an apartment or get a job.\nUnfortunately, one colossal mistake can ruin years of careful credit-building for even those with the highest scores. Lamine Zarrad, a former national bank examiner for the United States Treasury, is the CEO and founder of StellarFi, a credit-building tool that helps struggling users rebuild.\nCalculating your credit can be tricky, and subject to change from month to month. However, Zarrad cautions anyone who cares about their financial well-being to avoid the one massive misstep that can instantly tank your score by 100 points or more.\nNo Matter What Else You Do, Never Miss a Payment\nBy the time any of the three credit bureaus \u2014 Equifax, Experian and TransUnion\u2013 find out that you\u2019ve fallen behind on loan payments, you\u2019re already a month late. That\u2019s because creditors must wait at least 30 days to report missed payments to protect consumers from severe consequences for something as benign as forgetting a due date or mixing up their calendar days.\nCreditors can impose late fees or penalty interest rates as soon as you miss a payment, but a full billing cycle will pass before you review your credit report and see where the real trouble starts. Many things can affect your credit score, no matter what type of credit card accounts you have, but this is a big one.\n\u201cEven a single missed payment can lead to immediate consequences,\u201d said Zarrad.\nThose consequences can include a hit to your credit score of 100 points or more. LendingTree says you could lose up to 180 points, although that\u2019s unlikely for those with all but the highest scores. The lower your score, the fewer points a late payment will cost you \u2014 but everyone faces a credit catastrophe when they blow a deadline by 30 days or more.\n\u201cOn-time payments make up 35% of your credit score,\u201d said Zarrad.\nNo other category weighs heavier on your score or can have a more significant impact on your credit health. For context, the next biggest section is amounts owed, which make up 30%.\nOther Paths to Triple-Digit Doom\nMissing a payment by 30 days is the only \u201cmistake\u201d that can cost you 100 points or more. There are other roads to the same fate for your credit mix, but they\u2019re not one-off missteps. They\u2019re the culmination of long periods of financial trauma that are often beyond the control of the people whose scores they crush.\nOutside of giving access to the wrong authorized user or straight-up identity theft, here are three paths you should avoid so you don\u2019t tank your credit.\nFiling for Bankruptcy\nFew things are worse for your credit than filing for bankruptcy, the consequences of which are even worse than being 30 days late with a payment.\n\u201cYou can expect your credit score to drop anywhere between 100 to over 200 points, depending on where your score started,\u201d said Zarrad. Here are some key takeaways:\n- According to Debt.org, high scores of 780 and up can fall by up to 240 points.\n- Filing for bankruptcy will remain on your credit score for seven to 10 years.\n- By contrast, a missed payment lingers for seven years at most.\nDefaulting on a Loan\nDefaulting on a mortgage, auto loan, personal loan, student loan or other debt typically occurs after 90 days without payment, although it can be longer for some kinds of loans.\n\u201cWhen you default on a loan, the lender typically reports the delinquency to credit bureaus, which results in a severe negative impact on your credit score,\u201d said Zarrad.\nBy this time, however, there usually isn\u2019t much farther to fall since your score has already absorbed massive damage from the devastating 30-day and 60-day late marks.\n\u201cThis can make it difficult to qualify for new credit, lead to higher interest rates when you do get approved, and potentially result in collection efforts, including legal action by the lender to recover the owed amount,\u201d said Zarrad.\n\u201cDefaulting can also result in the loss of the asset or collateral securing the loan, such as your home or car, depending on the type of loan.\u201d\nHaving an Account Go to Collections\nLike bankruptcy and default, the third and final way your score can take a triple-digit hit usually indicates serious and long-term underlying financial dysfunction \u2014 having a new collection account hit your credit report.\n\u201cWhen an account goes to collections, it is reported to credit bureaus and appears as a derogatory entry on your credit report,\u201d said Zarrad.\n\u201cThis can significantly lower your credit score and remain on your report for up to seven years, even if you pay off the collection account. For lenders, accounts in collections indicate that you have a history of not repaying debts as agreed, which suggests a higher likelihood that you may not repay new debts.\u201d\nWays To Rebuild Your Credit Score\nIf your credit score took a bruising from a missed payment or anything else, don\u2019t panic. There are actions other than just staring blankly at a free credit report or avoiding eye contact with your credit card balance you can take to start the rebuilding process.\nFollow Good Credit Best Practices\nFirst, avoid any new damage by adhering to the basic rules of credit building \u2014 and don\u2019t make any further errors.\n- Don\u2019t apply for any new credit until you rebuild.\n- Pay all bills on time. If you can\u2019t pay, contact your creditors immediately. They\u2019ll work with you if you\u2019re proactive.\n- Choose a debt-reduction strategy like the snowball or avalanche method to begin paying down your most toxic accounts.\n- Consider seeking credit counseling, but be leery of for-profit companies that make bold promises about fixing your credit quickly.\nConsider Online Credit-Building Tools\nSeveral platforms offer ways to rebuild your credit. They aren\u2019t free or instant, but they offer legitimate paths back to healthy credit.\n- StellarFi: Zarrad\u2019s platform, StellarFi, helps users improve battered scores without a credit check or interest payments at varying price tiers. Users link their checking accounts and pay their monthly bills like rent, streaming subscriptions and utilities \u2014 which typically don\u2019t appear on credit reports \u2014 through StellarFi. The platform then reports those successful, on-time payments to the three credit bureaus to improve your standing and document a growing history of financial responsibility, which lenders like to see.\n- CreditStrong: It offers credit-builder tools to help you work toward a healthy score. For example, CreditStrong\u2019s Revolv is \u2013in the most basic terms \u2014 a savings account where savings deposits get reported to all three credit bureaus as on-time credit payments. Your funds stay locked in an account, while you build up your credit and at the end of the term, you get access to all of your deposited funds, plus interest.\n- Self: combines several credit-building tools in a hybrid format. Like StellarFi, it also offers a bill-pay reporting tool that informs the bureaus about your on-time payments for rent, utilities and other services that wouldn\u2019t otherwise show up on your record.\n- Secured Visa Credit Card: You pay a deposit that represents your credit limit. You can make purchases up to that limit, and you\u2019ll also get a monthly bill. It\u2019s important to note that you can access a secured card for building credit on your own. Discover, CapitalOne, First Progress, First Latitude, Open Sky and others offer similar cards directly to consumers looking to rebuild their credit.\nAndrew Lisa contributed to the reporting for this article."

      "text": "While many people use credit scores and credit reports interchangeably, and the two are related, they are different. Can you have a poor credit report and a good credit score? It\u2019s unlikely, but not entirely impossible. Below, we\u2019ll break down the purpose of each, how they\u2019re different, and what you need to do to keep both in good shape. Read on for a credit score vs. credit report breakdown.\nConsidering a way to build your credit? Join MoneyLion WOW membership and apply for up to a $1,000 Credit Builder Loan at a competitive rate with no hard credit check.\nTable of contents\nWhat is a credit score?\nA credit score is a three-digit number that lenders review to determine how responsible or risky you are as a borrower. It represents the statistical probability that you\u2019ll default on a loan. Your credit score is based on your credit report, which is collected and provided by credit bureaus, Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion.\nThere are different types of credit scores, but the two main ones most lenders use are the FICO\u00ae Score and VantageScore\u00ae. Poor credit shows lenders they are taking on greater risk by lending to you.\nA low credit score generally means a higher risk of financial difficulties that could lead to a loan default. You may have difficulty qualifying for a loan or securing an apartment. You\u2019ll also likely have to pay more for the same financing products as someone with good credit.\nWhile each credit score weighs factors slightly differently, here are the factors and their weights in your FICO score:\n- Payment history (35%): This is your repayment history, or whether you\u2019ve been mostly on-time or late on payments.\n- Credit utilization rate (30%): How much you owe compared to your credit limit.\n- Credit history (15%): This is the length of credit history or the average age of your credit accounts\n- Credit mix (10%): This is the type of credit account, such as credit cards, mortgages, auto loans, etc.\n- Credit checks (10%): Hard inquiries, or how often you\u2019ve recently applied for new credit, make up the final 10% of your credit score.\nWhat is a good credit score?\nCredit scores range from 300 to 850. A good credit score is typically around 700 or higher. For the FICO scoring model, a good credit score is between 670 and 739. For the VantageScore model, a good credit score is between 661 and 780.\nThe higher your credit score, the better your chances for approval on loans, mortgages, or other debt products. Having good credit will also help you secure the lowest rates on financing, which can turn into considerable savings over the long run.\nWhat are credit scores used for?\nLenders and landlords will review your credit score to determine how likely you are to repay a loan or keep up with rental payments. Your credit score can affect everything from your ability to qualify for a loan to renting an apartment. It\u2019s also one of the most important factors determining the interest rates you\u2019ll receive, which can affect your overall cost of financing. In some cases, employers will also check your credit score.\nHow to check your credit score\nThere are different ways to check your credit score. First, you\u2019re entitled to a free credit report from all three credit bureaus at annualcreditreport.com. In addition, many banks and credit card issuers offer free credit scores from either VantageScore or FICO.\nAmerican Express, Bank of America, Barclays, Capital One, Chase, Citi, Discover, Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank. You can also get a credit monitoring app. For example, MoneyLion\u2019s credit builder app can help you monitor your credit score.\nHow to improve your credit score\nTips for improving your credit score include:\n- Pay all debts on time: To avoid accidental late payments, set up automatic payments for your credit cards, utility bills, and other expenses.\n- Pay off debt: If you\u2019re carrying debt, especially credit card debt, work to repay it over time.\n- Pay more often: Paying more than once within a billing cycle can lower your credit utilization and improve your score.\n- Limit new credit applications: Applying for multiple new credit cards within a few months could lower your credit score.\n- Keep your oldest accounts open: Since credit history is an average of your account ages, keeping older accounts open, even if you don\u2019t use them anymore, can help your credit score. Of course, if these accounts have annual fees it may not work.\n- Consider a debt consolidation loan: If you have significant credit card debt, this can be an option to pay off the debt with a lower interest rate.\n- Become an authorized user: If you have a friend or family member with a good credit score willing to add you as an authorized user, this can help boost your credit score faster.\n- Use a rent reporting company: If you\u2019ve been paying utilities and rent on time, you can use a rent reporting company to get those on-time payments reported to the credit bureaus.\nPRO TIP! A good credit score can lead to lower interest rates and increased borrowing power on loans and credit cards. MoneyLion offers a free and convenient way to find offers from our trusted partners to help you improve your credit.\nWhat is a credit report?\nA credit report is a ledger of your debt management history produced by one of the three major consumer credit bureaus: Experian, TransUnion, or Equifax. These credit bureaus are in charge of collecting and storing the information that makes up credit reports, which will ultimately determine your credit score.\nYour credit report contains your personal information, data on your credit history, credit accounts, and the history of these accounts. These are provided to credit bureaus by the lenders you work with. Within your credit report, you should expect to find the following.\n- Personal information: Your name, address, birth year, and more.\n- Credit accounts: All the loans, credit cards, or other bills in your name, including open accounts, as well as closed and collection accounts.\n- Bankruptcy: Bankruptcy filings from the last seven to 10 years will generally appear on your credit report.\n- Recent inquiries: The number of times someone recently checked your credit report, typically as a credit check to decide whether to approve you for a loan, apartment, etc.\nWhat are credit reports used for?\nCredit reports give an overview of your credit history and demonstrate your responsibility as a borrower. Most importantly, they calculate your credit score.\nHow to get a free credit report\nYou can get a free credit report from all three credit bureaus at annualcreditreport.com. You can also view your credit report online more frequently at the same address. You can also request your credit report by phone or through the mail:\n- Phone: (877) 322-8228\n- Mail: Download and complete the Annual Credit Report Request form and mail the completed form to:\nAnnual Credit Report Request Service\nP.O. Box 105281\nAtlanta, GA 30348-5281\nIf you need additional physical copies of your credit reports, you can request them at the same address for a fee. By law, a credit reporting company can charge no more than $14.50 for a credit report.\nHow to dispute an error on your credit report\nIf you find incorrect information on your credit report, you should dispute that information with the credit bureau Experian, Equifax, or TransUnion. You must file a separate dispute with each bureau that lists the error on your credit report. Explain in writing what is wrong and why, and include copies of documents supporting your dispute.\nHere\u2019s how to contact each of the three credit bureaus:\nYou can contact the nationwide credit reporting companies online, by mail, or by phone:\nEquifax\nYou can reach Equifax online, by phone at (866) 349-5191, or mail the dispute form with your letter to:\nEquifax Information Services LLC\nP.O. Box 740241\nAtlanta, GA 30374\nExperian\nYou can contact Experian online, by phone at (888) 397-3742, or through the mail by sending your credit report and letter to:\nExperian\nP.O. Box 4500\nAllen, TX 75013\nTransUnion\nYou can contact TransUnion online, by phone at (800) 916-8800, or by sending the dispute form and your letter to:\nTransUnion Consumer Solutions\nP.O. Box 2000\nChester, PA 19016-2000\nNote that TransUnion\u2019s phone service is only available Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern time (ET) and Saturday and Sunday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET.\nWhy is your credit score different from your credit report?\nThe relationship between your credit report and credit score is that the former creates the latter. Your credit report ultimately contains the information that will be used to calculate your credit score.\nYour credit score is a three-digit figure, so it\u2019s great for quickly determining your responsibility as a borrower. However, your credit report gives a more in-depth look into the makings of your credit score and can provide more detailed information.\nMonitoring Your Credit Score vs. Credit Report\nIdeally, you should monitor your credit score and credit report. While your credit score is a single-number summary of your likelihood to pay back debt, your credit report contains additional details about your lines of credit, total credit, name, addresses, and more. Keeping an eye on this information can help you quickly dispute inaccuracies and build your credit score over time. You can also develop a plan to improve your credit score in three months.\nFAQs\nWill checking your own credit report hurt your credit?\nNo, checking your credit report will not hurt your credit. In fact, it\u2019s important to regularly check your credit report and monitor your credit score.\nDo lenders look at credit scores or credit reports?\nLenders usually look at your credit score to determine your creditworthiness. The higher your credit score, the more likely you are to pay back loans on time, thus the lower the risk for the lender.\nIs it bad to check your credit score every day?\nIf you can access credit monitoring tools through your bank or an app, you can check your credit score daily, but you probably won\u2019t see daily changes."

You might find unauthorized charges on your credit card or accounts you never opened. If this happens, taking quick action is the best way to minimize damage. The good news is that there are clear steps you can follow to report identity theft, protect your finances, and start the recovery process.\nSigns You Might Be a Victim of Identity Theft\nIdentity theft isn\u2019t always obvious. Sometimes, small warning signs can indicate a bigger problem. Here are some red flags to watch for:\n- Bills or account statements for accounts you don\u2019t recognize.\n- Collection calls demanding payment for debts you never took out.\n- A denied credit application when you have good credit.\n- Charges you didn\u2019t make on your bank or credit card.\n- Letters about accounts or government benefits you never applied for.\nIf any of these sound familiar, it\u2019s time to take action.\nStep 1 \u2013 Contact Companies Where Fraud Happened\nThe first step is to contact the companies where fraud has occurred. Whether it\u2019s a bank, credit card company, or loan provider, let them know you\u2019re a victim of identity theft.\n- Call the company immediately and explain the situation.\n- Ask them to freeze or close affected accounts.\n- Request the removal of fraudulent charges.\n- Add extra security alerts or two-factor authentication to your accounts to prevent further unauthorized access.\nMost financial institutions have fraud departments ready to help, so don\u2019t hesitate to reach out.\nStep 2 \u2013 Place a Fraud Alert on Your Credit Report\nA fraud alert notifies lenders to take extra precautions before approving any new credit in your name. This can help prevent further damage if someone tries to open accounts using your information.\nYou only need to contact one of the three major credit bureaus\u2013they will notify the others:\n- Experian: experian.com/fraud\n- Equifax: equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services\n- TransUnion: transunion.com/fraud-victim-resource\nFraud alerts last for one year and are free to set up.\nStep 3 \u2013 Get Your Free Credit Reports\nChecking your credit reports is essential to spotting fraudulent activity. You can request free copies from all three credit bureaus at AnnualCreditReport.com.\nWhen reviewing your reports, look for:\n- Accounts you didn\u2019t open.\n- Hard inquiries from companies you didn\u2019t apply with.\n- Unusual balances that seem too high.\nIf you find any incorrect information, report it right away.\nStep 4 \u2013 Report Identity Theft to the FTC\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) provides official resources to help you recover from identity theft. Go to IdentityTheft.gov to file a report.\nOnce you submit your case, the FTC will create a personalized recovery plan. This official report can also be used as proof of identity theft when dealing with banks, creditors, and law enforcement.\nStep 5 \u2013 File a Police Report (If Needed)\nIn some situations, you may need to file a police report. This is especially important if:\n- The thief used your name during an arrest.\n- A company requires a police report before they can process your fraud claim.\nWhen filing a police report, bring your FTC Identity Theft Report along with any supporting evidence, such as fraudulent account statements or correspondence.\nProtect Yourself After Reporting Identity Theft\nOnce you\u2019ve reported identity theft, take extra steps to secure your personal information and prevent future fraud.\n- Change passwords for all your financial accounts and email.\n- Consider freezing your credit if you don\u2019t plan to apply for loans or credit cards soon.\n- Use a credit monitoring service to get alerts for suspicious activity.\n- Don\u2019t share personal information online, especially on social media.\nThese simple habits can go a long way in keeping our identity safe.\nFAQ\n- Who do I report identity theft to first?\n- Start by contacting the company where the fraud happened. Then, place a fraud alert with a credit bureau and report the theft to the FTC.\n- Do I need a police report to fix identity theft?\n- Not always. In many cases, an FTC Identity Theft Report is enough. However, if fraud involves criminal activity, a police report may be necessary.\n- Will reporting identity theft hurt my credit?\n- No, reporting identity theft does not lower your credit score. In fact, taking action can help prevent further damage.\n- How long does it take to recover from identity theft?\n- The timeline varies depending on the severity of the fraud. Some issues can be resolved in a few weeks, while more complex cases may take months to fix."

That may sound like a glib assessment, but the closer your credit score gets to 850, the easier it is to hit many of your life goals \u2014 like buying a car or renting the apartment of your dreams. Need a loan for anything, such as a home or a new business? The higher your score, the lower your interest rate is likely to be. So much you need to move through your life \u2014 and master your personal finances \u2014 depends on your credit.\nAs you work to raise that number, you\u2019ve probably come across the terms \u201ccredit score\u201d and \u201ccredit report.\u201d At first glance, they may seem interchangeable \u2014 but they\u2019re not. They\u2019re closely related, but they have a few key differences. Understanding these differences can help you improve your credit.\nTo break it all down, GOBankingRates caught up with Jay Zigmont, Ph.D., CFP, and founder of Childfree Wealth.\nHow a Credit Score Differs From a Credit Report\nWhen it comes to understanding credit, this is the million-dollar question. As Zigmont explains: \u201cYour credit report is a list of all your accounts, payment records and basic information about you. Your credit score analyzes your credit report against a rating system.\u201d\nIn essence, think of your credit report like a financial transcript \u2014 a detailed record of your history as a borrower. It includes your credit card accounts, loans, payment history, as well as any delinquencies or defaults. Or, if you\u2019re a spy movie fan, it\u2019s your financial dossier, showing how you\u2019ve treated credit over time.\nSo who compiles this data? Three major credit bureaus \u2014 Equifax, Experian and TransUnion \u2014 collect this information based on what your various lenders report to them. Each bureau may have slightly different data, so your reports (and scores) might not be exactly the same from bureau to bureau.\nYour credit score, on the other hand, is a three-digit number calculated based on the data within your credit report. It\u2019s a kind of shorthand for lenders to determine how risky or reliable you are as a borrower. The most commonly used scoring model is the FICO Score, which ranges from 300 to 850.\nWhy It Matters\nOK, you say \u2014 now I know the difference between a credit score and a credit report. But does it actually matter when applying for a car loan or credit card? Zigmont says yes, and here\u2019s why:\n\u201cEach bank or loan may use different credit score systems, and may pull from all three bureaus or just one,\u201d he said. \u201cSince they use different scoring systems, they may have different cutoffs. In general, the higher your credit score, the better your loan terms will be.\u201d\nIn other words, your credit score is only part of the picture. Imagine you\u2019ve just applied for a car loan. Your lender might not look at your score alone; they\u2019ll likely review your full credit report to get the context behind that number. A score alone won\u2019t reveal things like delayed payments or even a recent bankruptcy. Lenders want a holistic view of what they can expect from you, and a credit report gives them just that.\nTo avoid any surprises in your loan application process, you\u2019ll want to regularly review your credit reports across all three bureaus. This will enable you to catch inaccuracies, resolve any issues and spot potential signs of identity theft before they can hurt your score, or worse, interfere with your ability to get approved for a loan.\nHow To Improve Your Credit Score by Strengthening Your Report\nYour credit report is like the soil in which your score can bloom \u2014 or perhaps wither on the vine, depending on how well you tend to that soil. If you nurture that soil with healthy financial habits, your score will thrive.\nStart by reviewing your report. If you\u2019ve been dinged for late payments, make on-time payments your top priority. Next, focus on paying down any existing debt, especially on revolving credit, like credit cards, and aim to use less than 30% of your available credit. This is known as credit utilization, and it has a significant impact on your score.\nAlso, avoid opening new credit accounts right before applying for a major loan. A new application results in a hard inquiry, which can cause a small, temporary dip in your score.\n\u201cPaying off your credit cards will have the biggest impact on your credit score, and you can see the impact in a month,\u201d Zigmont said. \u201cOver time, you need to focus on paying on time, not taking out credit unless you absolutely need it, and keeping your total utilization low.\u201d\nBottom Line\nNo, your credit score and credit report aren\u2019t the same thing \u2014 but they are closely related. Your score reflects what\u2019s in your report, so you should check it regularly to ensure it\u2019s accurate.\nThink of your credit report as the raw data, and your score as the grade. Both play a big role in whether you can borrow money, rent a place to live or even get hired \u2014 so understanding how they work together is a crucial part of achieving long-term financial success.\nThis article is part of GOBankingRates\u2019 Top 100 Money Experts series, where we spotlight expert answers to the biggest financial questions Americans are asking.

You figure, why not throw everything you have financially at the debt with the highest interest rate? Then all you have to do is ride the ensuing avalanche down to the ground of financial security.\nIt sure sounds good.\nBut for Dave Ramsey, bestselling author and trusted financial advisor to millions, that attitude could be a trap \u2014 and a reason you\u2019re staying in debt longer than necessary.\nAccording to Ramsey, the smartest way out isn\u2019t the one that saves the most on interest. It\u2019s the one that builds momentum fast enough to keep you going. And that\u2019s the Debt Snowball Method \u2014 not the avalanche.\nAvalanche vs. Snowball\nOn the surface, the debt snowball method runs counter to most conventional finance advice, which argues that you should pay off the debt with the highest interest rate first, regardless of balance. That way, more of your payments go toward the principal, and you pay less in interest over time. From a strictly mathematical standpoint, it is the most efficient approach.\nBut Ramsey argues that this isn\u2019t a math problem \u2014 it\u2019s a behavior problem. And for most people, leading with logic instead of motivation is what gets them stuck.\n\u201cYou should always start with the smallest debt first, regardless of the interest rate,\u201d Ramsey told GOBankingRates. \u201cThe Debt Snowball Method works because personal finance is 80% behavior and only 20% head knowledge.\u201d\nThe snowball method flips the conventional logic on its head. You list your debts from smallest balance to largest, and make only the minimum payments on all but the very smallest one. That\u2019s the one you attack first, aggressively paying it off. Once it\u2019s paid off, you roll the money that was going towards it into the next smallest debt, building momentum as you go.\nAs each smaller debt disappears, you gain confidence, motivation \u2014 and a larger payment to put toward the next debt. That emotional traction is what Ramsey says most people are missing.\nThe Power of Progress\nRamsey stands by the snowball method because he understands that, for better or worse, emotions and ingrained behaviors influence how people handle money. And people need to feel wins early and often to stay motivated, especially when they\u2019re overwhelmed by debt.\n\u201cKnocking out that first debt gives you a quick win and builds momentum,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cOnce you see progress, you\u2019re fired up to keep going. If math was the only issue, most people wouldn\u2019t be in debt to begin with \u2014 it\u2019s about changing habits and attacking debt with intensity.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why he cautions against getting too caught up in interest rates. While avalanche math might save you money in the long term, the long term is hard to stick with if you don\u2019t see progress.\n\u201cThe snowball method works because it gives you hope,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you pay off a small debt, you feel like you can actually win \u2014 and hope is what keeps you in the game. That early success creates emotional fuel.\u201d\nWhy Avalanche Fails for Most People\nAccording to Ramsey, the avalanche method, though logical, doesn\u2019t work for most people because it takes too long to feel rewarding. That lack of progress kills people\u2019s motivation.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the problem with the avalanche \u2014 it\u2019s slow, and slow kills motivation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is NOT actually mathematically correct if you incorporate \u2018probability of completion\u2019 in your math formula.\u201d\nThe way he sees it, the snowball method resolves one of his core issues with the avalanche method, which he considers a slow-burning motivation-killer. The most efficient plan on paper doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t finish it. And most people don\u2019t.\n\u201cHardly anyone finishes the avalanche, and millions have completed the Debt Snowball,\u201d he said. \u201cYou fix a behavior-based problem with a behavior-based solution. Paying off debt is about momentum, not math.\u201d\nBottom Line\nWhile the avalanche method might save more money on interest, it often fails where it matters most: keeping people motivated. That\u2019s why Ramsey stands by the snowball approach.\n\u201cI always recommend the Debt Snowball Method because most people need those small victories to stay engaged,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you try to lead with math instead of motivation, you risk burning out before you see real progress.\u201d\nThis article is part of GOBankingRates\u2019 Top 100 Money Experts series, where we spotlight expert answers to the biggest financial questions Americans are asking.

      "text": "Paying in Full vs. Partial Payments: Which Is Best for Your Credit Score?\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nMaking timely payments toward your credit cards and other debts and household bills is essential for keeping your credit report in good shape. Major credit bureaus factor in timely payments when calculating your credit score, including things like rent payments. For example, Experian uses an on-time rental payment system to include timely rental payments to establish your credit history.\nWhen you\u2019re managing your debt and money, you might wonder whether it\u2019s worthwhile to pay off those credit balances in full or make partial payments that fit your budget. Here\u2019s what you need to know about making payments to creditors when you want to improve your credit score.\nDiscover:\nHow Payments Affect Your Credit Score\nThe most widely used credit scoring system is FICO. Your FICO score is calculated from several factors that appear on your credit report. According to Fair Isaac, the makers of FICO, late payments will lower your FICO score, but a good track record of timely payments will raise your score.\nWhen you\u2019re trying to build or repair your credit, you need to make timely payments a high priority. Still, that\u2019s not the only way to give your credit score a boost. If you have the means to do so, prioritizing full payments on your credit card debt could offer even more benefits.\nBest Ways To Increase Your Credit Score Quickly\nWhen your goal is to boost your credit score and impress a potential lender, the best thing you can do is focus on increasing your credit utilization ratio \u2014 an indicator of how much credit you have used compared to your total available credit. A low utilization ratio can boost your credit because this ratio makes up 30% of your credit score, advised a spokesperson for credit card products at Navy Federal Credit Union.\n\u201cThe absolute fastest way to raise your credit score is to pay off all your debt or as much as you can. This is because payment history makes up 35% of your credit score [whereas] your credit utilization ratio makes up 30 percent.\u201d\nShould you pay a loan off before a credit card? Not necessarily. You\u2019ll want to pay off all credit with the highest interest charges so you can clear the debt as quickly as possible. As your credit utilization ratio improves, you should see an improvement in your credit score\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that your credit mix \u2014 the number of installment loans and credit card accounts that show up on your credit report \u2014 makes up 10% of your credit score. Paying off all your credit cards or installment loans quickly could raise your credit score because this behavior shows lenders that you can handle different types of credit. As long as you are paying these types of debts as quickly as possible, you could see your credit score rise.\nWhen you aren\u2019t maxing out your credit cards or showing a history of new loans on your credit report, you will appear to be less dependent on credit to get by. You\u2019ll also want to take steps to avoid any missed or late payments. These are all good signs in the eyes of a lender and can have a positive effect on your credit score.\nFull vs. Partial Payments: What Matters Most\nWhen your goal is to lower your overall debt load, you need to figure out which type of repayment schedule will help you reach your goal as quickly as possible. Would you be more motivated to pay down debt when you have a fixed partial payment each month or are you disciplined enough to set aside funds for a full payoff in a few months? Only you can decide which method is right for you. The end goal is the same: to pay off as much as you can as quickly as possible.\nAlthough making timely payments is always a good idea, you don\u2019t want to overlook the benefits of paying off bigger chunks of debt \u2014 or all of your debt in full \u2014 to improve your credit score. Clearing your debt load quickly can help you clean up your credit report fast, and it has the added benefit of eliminating the risk of missed or late payments altogether.\nMore From GOBankingRates"

These 5 Financial Habits Can Help You Feel More in Control\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nIf money is the universal language, then you definitely want to speak it fluently. But to master the most important verbs \u2014 like \u201cbudget,\u201d \u201csave\u201d and \u201cinvest\u201d \u2014 you first need to get comfortable with the basics of money management.\nLearning the fundamentals of managing your money \u2014 from building a workable budget to understanding essential personal finance concepts \u2014 will help you feel less overwhelmed and more confident about your financial future. Think of it like learning any language: Before you can dazzle a crowd, you have to master the basics.\nIf you\u2019re feeling stressed about money now, these five habits will help you gain control and reduce that stress.\n1. Understand Your Relationship With Money\nThe idea of a \u201crelationship with money\u201d may seem odd \u2014 after all, don\u2019t you simply want more of it? Not so fast. The messages you received about money growing up can continue to shape how you think about it, spend it and save it \u2014 or don\u2019t.\nIf you watched your parents play fast and loose with their finances, you might have adopted the same approach. Or perhaps you veered in the opposite direction, becoming so tight-fisted with your funds that you avoid even productive risks, like investing. Maybe your household had very gendered expectations about who earned and managed the money, and you\u2019ve internalized these roles more than you realized.\nRegardless, understanding your financial mindset is the first step toward changing unhealthy patterns and reducing stress.\n2. Boost Your Financial Literacy\nStress often comes from the unknown. The more you know about money, the less intimidating it becomes, and the better equipped you\u2019ll be to make smarter choices and feel in control of your money.\nGot a library card? A favorite podcast app? A social media account? Then you have free ways of accessing financial experts and information, from basic terminology to step-by-step guidance on budgeting, saving and investing. You can learn at your own pace and on your own terms, making the process far less overwhelming.\n3. Create a Budget That Works for You\nYou might think that a budget is simply a spreadsheet that tracks your expenses or an app that tells you what you\u2019ve spent. It can be those things, but it can also be so much more: a powerful tool for achieving your financial goals.\nTo create an actionable budget, you\u2019ll want to first calculate your income, including earnings from your main job, freelance work or side hustles. Then categorize your expenses into fixed costs (which stay the same every month) and variable costs (which fluctuate, like groceries and entertainment).\nFrom there, assign spending limits to each category, prioritizing necessities like rent, utilities, food and transportation over discretionary spending like dining out or hobbies. Don\u2019t forget to allocate a percentage for savings and debt repayment, both of which are essential for building long-term wealth.\nA well-crafted budget helps reduce money stress by showing you exactly where your money goes and how you can reach your goals.\n4. Prioritize Getting Out of Debt\nOne of the core foundations of good money management is avoiding high-interest debt, like credit card debt. Carrying a balance from month to month is a speed bump to building wealth \u2014 and a common source of financial anxiety.\nThere\u2019s no single best way to pay down your debt: Some people prefer the snowball method, which focuses on paying off smaller debts first, while others opt for the avalanche method, which prioritizes high-interest debts to save money over time.\nNo matter which strategy you choose, the key is consistency. Look for ways to cut expenses or boost your income to repay your debt faster.\n5. Set Up Essential Financial Accounts\nCreating a safety net is crucial for feeling secure.\nThe first priority is to build an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account. Aim for at least three to six months\u2019 worth of expenses. Even small monthly contributions add up and can protect you from sudden financial shocks, like job loss, medical emergencies, or urgent car or appliance repair costs.\nAs you insulate yourself from unforeseen emergencies, you\u2019ll also want to think about long-term savings. If your employer offers a 401(k) with a match, contribute enough to capture that free money. If not, look into a traditional or Roth IRA for tax-advantaged retirement savings.\nSpending time mastering these accounts today can help you build a rosier, more secure financial future.\nLooking to build a legacy?

While taxes shouldn\u2019t be the sole focus of your investment strategy, they can take a serious chunk out of your returns if you\u2019re not careful.\nThat\u2019s why the most seasoned investors focus on advanced strategies designed to minimize their tax bill and help boost what stays in their portfolio.\nKeep more of what you earn with Betterment\u2019s tax-saving tech.

Tax Loss Harvesting \u2014 Helps Offset Capital Gains\nThe stock market ebbs and flows. It can\u2019t be predicted. So it\u2019s inevitable that even the best portfolios will experience losses. That\u2019s where tax loss harvesting can be a smart strategy.\nTax loss harvesting is the practice of selling a security that has experienced a loss. By realizing, or \u201charvesting\u201d a loss, investors are able to offset taxes on both gains and income. The sold security is replaced by a similar one, ideally maintaining an optimal asset allocation and expected returns.\nThe losses can then be used to offset capital gains and potentially reduce ordinary income by up to $3,000 annually, with remaining losses carried forward.\nTurn market losses into potential tax wins.

Tax-Coordinated Portfolio \u2014 Make Sure You\u2019re as Tax-Efficient As Possible\nIf you\u2019re investing across different types of accounts \u2014 say a traditional IRA, Roth IRA, and a taxable brokerage account \u2014 it\u2019s wise to strategically organize your assets according to their tax efficiency. You generally want to place less tax-efficient assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient assets in taxable accounts.\nThe goal here is to minimize the taxes you\u2019ll pay on investment growth.

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nYour credit report provides a record of how you\u2019ve managed your debt obligations, as reported by your creditors to the credit bureaus. Each report includes details such as:\n- Types of accounts \u2014 credit cards, loans, mortgages, etc.\n- Current and historical balances\n- Credit limits\n- Payment history\n- Accounts in collections\n- Public records related to your debts, including liens, foreclosures, bankruptcies, civil suits and judgments against you\nYour credit report combines all your credit history information into one document. Credit reports are compiled by the three nationwide credit reporting agencies \u2014 Experian, Equifax and TransUnion. Each agency sells its credit bureau report to your future lenders, landlords, employers and others who have a stake in an individual\u2019s creditworthiness.\nHow Do I Read a Credit Report?\nFederal law allows you to request a free copy of your credit report once every 12 months from each of the three major credit bureaus. You can check all three at once or space them out every four months.\nWhile your credit report provides detailed financial information, it does not include your credit score. However, many credit card issuers and financial institutions offer free access to your credit score.\nBelow is a look at what information you\u2019ll find on your credit report.\nPersonal Information\nYour personal information isn\u2019t used to calculate your credit score, but it\u2019s important that it\u2019s correct. Errors could cause someone else\u2019s accounts to appear on your credit report, which may lower your score and indicate possible fraud or identity theft.\nSome personal details you\u2019ll see on your credit report include your name, current address and Social Security number.\nCredit Account Details\nYour credit report lists each account, showing details like the following:\n- Account status: Open, negative or closed\n- Account type: Revolving line of credit, installment loan, etc.\n- Account balance: Monthly balance, high balance and revolving credit limit or initial installment loan amount\n- Credit bureau: The reporting agency for the account\n- Payment history: Number of times payments were 30 days, 60 days, 90 days or 120 days late\nIn addition to looking over your credit accounts, you can use the information to determine your credit limits and utilization ratios.\nFor example, if you have a combined revolving credit limit of $10,000 and $2,000 in revolving account balances, your credit utilization ratio is 20%.\nCredit Inquiries\nInquiries refer to when a legitimate business requests your credit report. Inquiries can be \u201chard\u201d or \u201csoft.\u201d\n- Soft inquiries: When your credit report is pulled by someone other than a prospective lender. This could be when a company pulls your credit score on its own to see if it wants to extend a promotional offer or if it is checking your score when you\u2019re already a customer. Soft inquiries have no effect on your credit score, so checking your own score won\u2019t hurt it.\n- Hard inquiries: When your credit score is pulled because you have applied for new credit, such as a new credit card, car loan or mortgage. Unlike soft inquiries, hard inquiries can have a small negative impact on your score.\nPublic Records and Negative Information\nThis section of your credit report lists events like bankruptcies, liens, foreclosures and judgments, which are public records. The public records are limited to finance-related records, so criminal arrests and convictions aren\u2019t included. Generally, this information stays on your credit report for several years.\nCredit Report Summary and Score Factors\nYour credit summary gives a quick overview of your accounts, balances and any missed payments. While you can review all the details in your credit report, the summary highlights key information at a glance.\nAll of the factors on your credit report impact your credit score. But some factors hold more weight than others. The most important factors include:\n- Your payment history\n- Amounts owed\n- Length of credit history\n- New credit\n- Credit mix\nFor example, a history of on-time payments can help boost your credit score. Conversely, a history of late payments can bring your credit score down.\nExample of a Credit Report\nBelow is an example of how a credit report is structured. Use this as a reference when reviewing your own credit report.\nWhy Is Your Credit Report Important?\nYour credit report plays a big role in your financial life. It impacts more than just loan approvals \u2014 it can affect housing, employment and even insurance rates. Here\u2019s how:\n- Loan approvals: Lenders review your credit report when deciding whether or not to offer you a loan and what loan terms they are willing to offer you.\n- Rental applications: Some landlords consider your credit before leasing you a home.\n- Job opportunities: Employers may review your credit before offering you a job.\n- Insurance rates: Insurers could consider your credit when determining premiums.\nUltimately, a good credit score based on a solid credit report can make your life easier. On the other hand, a credit report riddled with negative information can make your life more difficult.\nHow To Spot Errors and Dispute Mistakes on Your Credit Report\nBoth the credit bureau and the creditor reporting the information are responsible for ensuring that the information is correct. To maximize your rights under federal law, you\u2019ll want to contact both to report errors and fix your credit report as quickly as possible.\nWrite To the Credit Bureau\nCredit bureaus must investigate any items you question, usually within 30 days.

You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nIf you\u2019re in the market for a vehicle, chances are you\u2019ll need to take out a loan to pay for it. Knowing how to get a car loan can help you find the best rate. You\u2019ll walk into the dealership with confidence, knowing exactly what you can afford.\nGetting a car loan can be as easy as filling out some paperwork at the dealership. You might be able to get a better interest rate or preferred loan terms from a bank, credit union or online lender. Some dealerships have multiple financing options to choose from. By doing a little research ahead of time, you can set yourself up to get the best possible auto loan for your situation.\nThis car loan guide will look at how to get approved quickly, where to find the best rates and what lenders look for.\nHow To Get a Car Loan in 8 Steps\nThe truth is, getting a car loan isn\u2019t as exciting as buying a new car. However, the process isn\u2019t as difficult or time-consuming as it might seem. Here are the key steps to secure a car loan.\n1. Check Your Credit Score\nReview your credit score and report to understand where you stand financially. Borrowers with credit scores above 780 will usually get the best interest rates, while borrowers with a credit score below 600 will likely receive higher rates and more limited options.\n2. Set a Budget\nFigure out how much you can afford to spend overall. Don\u2019t forget to factor in monthly payments, insurance, fuel costs and maintenance. Consider how long you\u2019re willing to make monthly payments on the vehicle and how long you intend to keep it.\nDid You Know?\nMore than 80% of new cars and 36% of used cars are bought with the help of financing, according to data from Experian\u2019s State of the Automotive Finance Market report for the fourth quarter of 2024.\n3. Save for a Down Payment\nPutting down more cash when you purchase the vehicle can often get you a lower interest rate because it reduces the risk taken on by the lender. A larger down payment will also trim your monthly payments by shrinking the overall loan amount. You may find that if you can make a large enough initial payment, you can afford to shorten the length of your loan.\n4. Compare Lenders\nYou can get auto loans from banks, credit unions and online lenders. Car dealerships can also provide financing either through their partner lenders or through the financing divisions of the manufacturer. Just like any major purchase, it can pay off to shop around for the best loan rates and terms.\n5. Get Preapproved\nIf you think you might want to get your car loan from an outside lender, such as a bank or credit union, you\u2019ll need to get preapproved before you go car shopping. This typically involves providing financial information in person at a branch or online.\n6. Choose a Car That Fits Your Budget\nNow it\u2019s probably time to scratch the Lamborghini off your list. The fun begins, and you can start comparing vehicles in your price range. Remember to go back and review your budget to avoid overextending your finances.\n7. Apply for the Loan\nOnce you\u2019ve agreed to a sale price for your vehicle, it\u2019s time to contact your lender to finalize the loan. If you\u2019re getting financing through the dealer, this step will be completed at the dealership as part of the purchasing process.\n8. Review Loan Terms and Sign\nCarefully review the loan agreement, paying close attention to the interest rate, loan term, and monthly payment details. Make sure all terms are favorable and that you fully understand your financial obligations before signing.\nWhere To Get a Car Loan\nBanks, credit unions and online lenders all offer auto loans. Car dealerships also provide several financing options that can be fast and convenient. Even if you think you\u2019ll be financing your car purchase through the dealership, it can pay off to check rates from outside lenders and get preapproved for a loan before you buy a car.\nHere\u2019s a closer look at your financing options and the advantages and drawbacks of each.\nBanks\nBanks are a popular source for auto loans, and they can be the best option for many borrowers. You can often find low interest rates and flexible auto loan terms at a bank. However, their loan approval criteria can be stricter, requiring higher credit scores and stable income. If you have a good financial profile, this could be a great choice for securing lower monthly payments.\nYou\u2019ll need to get preapproved by the bank for a car loan before you purchase the vehicle.\nCredit Unions\nSimilar to banks, credit unions can provide low rates and flexible terms on car loans. You\u2019ll need to become a member to take advantage of their offers, but many credit unions these days have relatively easy membership requirements.\nOnline Lenders\nMany online lenders can provide you with a car loan, and most offer a quick and easy application process. Online lenders often have less strict qualification requirements, so those with lower credit scores may have a better chance of approval. However, online lenders may charge higher fees and the interest rates might not be as low as you\u2019d find elsewhere.\nDealership Financing\nMany auto dealerships have a list of partner lenders they work with to help customers finance their purchases. After you\u2019ve selected a vehicle and agreed upon a price, the dealer will collect financial information such as your credit score and proof of income and send that to its lenders. In many cases, you\u2019ll be able to compare several loan rates to choose the one that\u2019s right for you.\nFinancing your car through a dealership has several benefits. Your loan will likely be approved faster, and the dealer handles much of the paperwork. This saves you the time you might have spent reaching out to multiple banks and waiting for loan decisions. However, some dealers have set rates or limited flexibility on loan terms, and you may end up with higher rates than you would with a bank or credit union.\nManufacturer Financing\nAnother type of loan you can get through a car dealership is from the manufacturer itself. Many car companies have financing arms that were created to help them sell more vehicles. Toyota Financial Services and Ford Credit are two examples of lending divisions owned by car brands.\nManufacturers frequently run promotional deals, such as a 0% annual percentage rate or cash back, on specific models they\u2019re trying to sell. If you see a special rate or deal on the car you want, this will likely be the best financing option for you.\nWhat Do You Need to Get Approved?\nSome lenders have stricter approval requirements than others, but they all want to assess how much risk they\u2019d be taking on by giving you a car loan. Here are some of the things you\u2019ll need to get your auto loan approved.\n- Good credit score: Your credit score will determine not only whether you qualify for a loan, but also how good of an interest rate you receive. Borrowers with credit scores that fall into the highest \u201csuper-prime\u201d range of 781 to 850 will likely get the best rates, while those with credit scores below 600 may not get approved by some lenders.\n- Proof of income: Lenders want to see that you have a reliable stream of cash coming in so that you can make on-time payments.\n- Personal identification: You\u2019ll need to provide the lender with a driver\u2019s license or government-issued ID.\n- Down payment: This isn\u2019t always required, but it can improve your approval chances, especially for vehicles with higher purchase prices. A down payment will also help reduce your monthly payments.\nHow To Get the Best Interest Rate\nAuto loan interest rates vary significantly, but there are several effective ways to get the best possible rate on your car loan.\nImprove Your Credit Score\nYour credit score may be the single biggest factor in determining the interest rate on your car loan. Consider that the average interest rate on a new car loan for borrowers with credit scores above 780 was 4.77% APR, according to the most recent Experian data. For those with credit scores between 661 and 780, the rate jumped to 6.40% APR. Borrowers with scores below 500 paid an interest rate of 15.75% APR.\nWhile improving your credit score isn\u2019t easy, it can pay off significantly by helping to reduce your monthly payments. Paying off debts and avoiding late payments are two ways you can steadily build up your score.\nMake a Larger Down Payment\nBy putting down more money at the time of purchase, you reduce the overall size of the loan and, therefore, the amount of risk to the lender. This can result in you getting a better rate on the smaller remaining loan total.\nChoose a Shorter Loan Term\nWhile longer loan terms might make your monthly payments more manageable, shorter loan terms often come with lower interest rates. Shorter terms pose less risk to lenders because the loan gets paid off more quickly, with less time for the borrower to run into financial challenges.\nThe average interest rate for new loans with terms of 48 months or less was 3.39% APR, while the rate for terms of longer than 85 months was 8.83% APR, the Experian report found.\nShop Around\nHere\u2019s one step you can take regardless of your financial profile: shop around and compare rates. Get estimates from several banks, credit unions and online lenders. Look for manufacturer financing deals at multiple car brands. Getting preapprovals from outside lenders may even help you negotiate a better rate with the dealership.\nPros and Cons of Financing a Car\n| Pros | Cons |\n|---|---|\n| Enables you to buy without paying in full | Interest adds to the overall cost |\n| On-time payments build credit | Late payments hurt your credit score |\n| Offers flexible terms to fit your budget | Longer loans can leave you owning more than the car\u2019s value |\nFinal Take: How To Get the Best Car Loan\nUltimately, to give yourself the chance of getting the best car loan rates, you\u2019ll want to shop around and know where your credit stands \u2014 is it good or does it need improvement? Having a plan before you walk into the dealership will set you on the right track.\nFAQs on How To Get a Car Loan\nIf you have questions about getting a car loan, here are some of the answers.- What credit score do I need to get a car loan?\n- While requirements vary between lenders, borrowers with credit scores of at least 600 will have a better chance of getting approved for a car loan.\n- Can I get a car loan with bad credit?\n- Yes, it is possible to get a car loan with bad or no credit. However, you'll have limited options, and those loans will likely come with a high interest rate and less preferable terms. \"Buy here, pay here\" loans are offered by some car dealerships and are designed for customers with bad or no credit. With these loans, you may have to pay more frequent installments than the usual monthly payments.\n- How much should I put down on a car loan?\n- It's typically recommended to put down at least 20% on a new car purchase. However, if you can put down more, you may want to ask your lender whether a larger down payment would result in a lower interest rate.\n- How long does car loan approval take?\n- The time it takes to get approved for a car loan depends on the lender you're working with. Banks and credit unions may take one to three business days to review your application, while dealership financing can be completed in several hours.\n- Can I refinance my car loan later for a better rate?\n- Yes, you can refinance your car loan to get a better rate. This involves obtaining a new loan to replace the existing one. Refinancing your car loan may be a good idea if interest rates have dropped or if your credit score has improved.\nOur in-house research team and on-site financial experts work together to create content that\u2019s accurate, impartial, and up to date.

Lenders use it to decide whether to approve your applications and what interest rates to offer. A strong credit score opens doors to better loan terms, lower credit card rates, and even rental approvals.\nCredit Scores Explained\nYour credit score shows lenders how responsible you are with borrowed money.\n- Score Range: Credit scores usually fall between 300 and 850, with higher scores indicating lower risk to lenders.\n- Why It Matters: Your score affects your ability to get loans, credit cards, and even rent an apartment or secure certain jobs.\nHow Credit Scores Work\nYour credit score is calculated using information from your credit report. Different models assess your credit history to determine your score.\nCredit Bureaus and Their Role\nThere are three major credit bureaus\u2013Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. Each collect and store your credit history. While they often have similar information, slight differences can lead to different credit scores.\nCredit Scoring Models\n- FICO Score: This is the most widely used credit scoring system among lenders.\n- VantageScore: An alternative model with a similar scoring range but different calculations.\nWhat Affects Your Credit Score?\nMany factors contribute to your credit score and each has a different level of importance.\nPayment History (35%)\nPaying bills on time is the most important factor in your credit score. Late or missed payments can lower your score quickly.\nCredit Utilization (30%)\nThis refers to how much of your available credit you\u2019re using. Keeping your balances low\u2013preferably below 30% of your credit limit\u2013helps maintain a strong score.\nLength of Credit History (15%)\nThe longer you\u2019ve had credit accounts open, the better. Closing old accounts may reduce your average account age, which can negatively impact your score.\nCredit Mix (10%)\nLenders like to see that you have different types of credit, such as credit cards, loans, and mortgages. Having a mix of credit accounts can slightly improve your score.\nNew Credit Inquiries (10%)\nIf you apply for multiple credit accounts in a short period, it can temporarily lower your score. Each new credit application results in a hard inquiry, which stays on your report for up to two years.\nWhat Is a Good Credit Score?\nCredit scores are divided into categories that indicate different levels of financial reliability.\n- 800-850 (Excellent): Qualifies for the best loan terms and lowest interest rates.\n- 740-799 (Very Good): Eligible for competitive lending rates and credit offers.\n- 670-739 (Good): Approved by most lenders, though not always at the best rates.\n- 580-669 (Fair): Higher interest rates and stricter loan terms may apply.\n- 300-579 (Poor): Limited borrowing options; may need to build credit with secured cards or loans.\nHow to Improve Your Credit Score\nIf your score isn\u2019t where you\u2019d like it to be, there are steps you can take to improve it over time.\nPay Bills on Time\nLate payments hurt your score. Set up reminders or automatic payments to ensure you don\u2019t miss due dates.\nReduce Credit Card Balances\nKeeping your credit utilization low is one of the fastest ways to boost your score. Try to use less than 30% of your available credit.\nLimit New Credit Applications\nEach application can cause a temporary drop in your score. Only apply for new credit when necessary.\nMonitor Your Credit Report\nCheck your credit reports regularly for errors. You can access free reports at AnnualCreditReport.com and dispute any incorrect information.\nBy understanding how credit scores work and taking steps to improve yours, you can set yourself up for better financial opportunities in the future."

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nFinancially secure people don\u2019t just care about their personal finances \u2014 they actively nurture them. They prioritize savings, track spending and regularly contribute to their retirement accounts. Every financial move they make is a deliberate choice to protect and grow their money.\nThink of it this way: Like a robust immune system, your money should be ready to work for you and keep you strong as you maneuver through a complex world. And just like your physical health \u2014 from the vitamins you take to the walks you enjoy and the water you drink (don\u2019t forget that part) \u2014 financial health requires consistent, daily habits.\nJust as regular checkups can affirm how healthy you are, checking in on your financial habits can also confirm that you\u2019re in a good place money-wise. What better way to do a financial self-check than to see if you\u2019re hitting certain benchmarks of good habits? You may find that you need to do a little more work to be as secure as you\u2019d like to be.\nFortunately, developing healthy financial habits isn\u2019t as hard as you might think (certainly easier than taking on the StairMaster at the gym). Here are six daily practices of financially secure people that you can adopt, too.\n1. They Live Below Their Means\nIn an era where social media is constantly bombarding you with images of people whose homes, cars, clothes and even household utensils look nicer than yours, resisting lifestyle inflation is harder than ever. Financially secure people know that what looks like a glamorous life could very well be fueled by massive credit card debt.\nRather than compare themselves to others, financially secure people don\u2019t just live within their means \u2014 they live below them. They prioritize value without compromising quality or safety, and the opinions of others don\u2019t impact their financial decision-making. They spend less, knowing the money they save will go toward growing their wealth and achieving their financial goals.\nSome tips for living below your means: If you regularly grocery shop at a bigger, pricier supermarket, switch to a more cost-effective option like Lidl or Aldi. Join your local \u201cBuy Nothing\u201d group, where you can swap household items for free, reducing unnecessary purchases. To avoid impulse buying, impose a 48-hour waiting period whenever you\u2019re tempted to buy something on a whim. Often, once you\u2019ve had time to think, you realize you don\u2019t need or even want the item.\n2. Their Emergency Savings Account Is Fully Funded\nFinancially secure people are prepared for life\u2019s financial curve balls. They\u2019ve got at least three to six months\u2019 worth of expenses parked in a high-yield savings account (HYSA), ready to handle situations like job loss, medical emergencies, or car repairs without having to resort to using credit.\nHYSAs are ideal tools for building your emergency fund because in addition to earning interest, you can withdraw the money without penalty, unlike other investment vehicles like CDs or annuities. This allows your money to grow while remaining accessible for when the unexpected happens.\n3. They Establish Multiple Income Streams\nFinancially secure people understand that multiple income streams can make it easier to grow wealth and achieve financial stability. They also know that you don\u2019t always have to be actively working to make money.\nIn addition to working hard in their nine-to-fives, financially successful people also look for income opportunities that can help them generate wealth in their five-to-nines. They often leverage investment strategies that include income-producing investments within their portfolio, like dividend stocks, dividend exchange-traded funds, real estate investment trusts and annuities.\nThey also aren\u2019t afraid to take on part-time or freelance gigs in areas where they have skills or interests to add to their income. You can also explore other ways to make your money work for you. Think about owning rental properties, investing in short-term vacation rentals, or trying out peer-to-peer lending platforms like Prosper or LendingClub that let you earn interest while helping others borrow money.\n4. They\u2019re Always Learning\nGot a long commute? Go on daily walks? Sounds like the perfect time to listen to that podcast or audiobook focused on finances. Financially secure people know that when it comes to personal finance, there\u2019s always more to learn.\nThankfully, a wide range of money experts from all walks of life are at your fingertips, more accessible than ever before. From books, social media, podcasts and other media, the resources for improving your financial knowledge are practically limitless. And the more you know about finance, the better equipped you\u2019ll be to navigate major financial decisions and market fluctuations.\n5. They Have a Clear Financial Vision\nFinancially secure people don\u2019t just save for the sake of saving \u2014 they set clear goals that keep them motivated and serve as a roadmap for their financial progress.\nThese goals can include short-term objectives, like gathering an emergency fund or paying off a credit card, or more long-term ambitions, like buying a home or retiring early. Try breaking down your big ambitions into some of the small, daily habits discussed here. Once or twice a week, sit down and review your spending, track savings milestones, and tweak your budget to ensure you\u2019re still on course. If you\u2019ve gotten a bit derailed, use these check-ins as a chance to course-correct and stay motivated.\n6. They Plan for the Future\nEven as you think about getting financially stronger today, it\u2019s also wise to consider your long-term future and legacy. That\u2019s why financially secure people make a point of proactively planning ahead, working with financial advisors and insurance agents to help them prepare for retirement and beyond.\nHaving the right life insurance, health insurance and long-term care insurance is essential for protecting yourself and your loved ones financially. Estate planning, such as setting up a will or trust, is also crucial for those looking to establish a financial legacy.\nWith daily care and attention, you can set yourself on the path to becoming healthier, wealthier and wiser."

Everyone has a net worth \u2014 though some are certainly higher than others \u2014 but you might be surprised to learn that you\u2019re worth more than you think. More importantly, your net worth is one of the clearest snapshots of your overall financial health.\nDr. Preston D. Cherry, a financial planner who calls himself \u201ca life designer in the world of wealth,\u201d is the founder of Concurrent Wealth Management and author of \u201cWealth in the Key of Life.\u201d He explains how to calculate your net worth, why it matters more than you might realize, and how tracking it over time can help you achieve your biggest financial goals.\nDo This Simple Math\nCalculating your net worth doesn\u2019t require any complicated technology or sifting through boxes of paperwork; it\u2019s a lot simpler than people think, Cherry said. \u201cIt\u2019s just what you own minus what you owe.\u201d To calculate your net worth:\n- Add up your assets: This includes cash, retirement and brokerage accounts, investments, your home and even business equity if you have it.\n- Then subtract your liabilities: These include credit card balances, student loans, auto loans, your mortgage or any other outstanding debts.\nA Snapshot of Your Financial Story\nOnce you calculate that number, Cherry encouraged a mindset shift: don\u2019t think of it as a static figure, but as \u201ca snapshot of your financial story.\u201d In his words, \u201cIt gives you a sense of where you are and a guide to where you\u2019re going.\u201d\nThink of your net worth as your personal financial narrative. \u201cIt tells you where you stand, how far you\u2019ve come, and your aspirational future,\u201d Cherry said. In other words, don\u2019t use it to compare yourself to others, but to measure your progress against your own goals.\nTracking your net worth regularly, such as quarterly or annually, can reveal whether you\u2019re headed in the right direction. It can also highlight blind spots, like lingering debt or underutilized savings opportunities, and bring clarity to future decision-making.\nA Reflection of Your Financial Choices\nAnother way to think of net worth, according to Cherry, is as \u201ca reflection of how your financial choices support your well-being.\u201d If your net worth is on the low side, that may show up as struggling to make ends meet or falling short of your goals.\nThe good news? You can set more aspirational goals and create concrete plans to raise your net worth. \u201cAnd when you see that number grow, you gain confidence \u2014 not just in your finances, but in your future,\u201d Cherry said.\nTake These Steps To Grow Your Net Worth\nGrowing your net worth doesn\u2019t happen on its own unless you already started with millions. Instead, Cherry suggests taking the following steps:\n- Automate and activate saving and investing: Your contributions add up with time and compound growth. Use both employer-sponsored and brokerage accounts. Also, don\u2019t be afraid to take calculated risks at opportune times.\n- Pay down high-interest debt: It might not seem as exciting as \u201cmaking money,\u201d but Cherry pointed out that it\u2019s a guaranteed return on your money.\n- Avoid both lifestyle creep and deprivation: Learn to spend intentionally so you can enjoy life while also increasing your savings as your income grows.\n- Invest in yourself: Money invested in your own education, health, skill-building or personal growth often translates into long-term financial growth.\nConsistency Is Key\nRemember that net worth isn\u2019t built overnight. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s boring,\u201d Cherry said. \u201cIt\u2019s the result of aligning your habits with your values \u2014 and doing so consistently.\u201d Over time, those daily choices can add up to financial clarity and freedom.\nThis article is part of GOBankingRates\u2019 Top 100 Money Experts series, where we spotlight expert answers to the biggest financial questions Americans are asking.

It can be a financial lifeline and an opportunity for people to discharge high debt for a \u201cfresh\u201d start.\n5 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\nWhat to Do If You Want to File for Bankruptcy?\nIf you are considering filing for bankruptcy, there are a few things to keep in mind:\n- You\u2019ll need to decide if chapter 7 or chapter 13 bankruptcy is right for you. We talk more about the difference below.\n- Collect your financial documentation. You\u2019ll need to submit extensive documentation of all of your financial assets and debts. You\u2019ll also need to declare high-value assets, like expensive artwork, for the trustee to review\n- Consider speaking to a lawyer. They can help you determine which type of bankruptcy is best and fill out the paperwork properly, increasing your chances for best results.\n- Take pre-filing credit counseling. All individual bankruptcy filers are required to complete pre-bankruptcy credit counseling before filing for bankruptcy. You\u2019ll later have to take debtor education after you file and before debt is discharged.\n- File the paperwork. File the petition with your local bankruptcy court. Make sure that you follow all the instructions when filing to ensure nothing is missed.\nTypes of Bankruptcy for Individuals\nThere are two main types of bankruptcy that individuals can take advantage of when needed: Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and Chapter 13 bankruptcy.\nChapter 7 Bankruptcy\nChapter 7 bankruptcy is a liquidation proceeding, so your property may be sold to pay your debts. Unsecured debt, such as credit card debt, is wiped out. Some kinds of debt, like back taxes, child support and alimony, cannot be eliminated in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\nWhen you file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, your nonexempt assets are sold, and the money is used to pay your creditors and lenders. You can keep your exempt assets.\n| Nonexempt Assets | Exempt Assets |\n|---|---|\n| Cash | Primary residence and vehicle |\n| Investments | Furniture, up to a certain dollar amount |\n| Second car or home | Clothing, up to a certain dollar amount |\n| Collectibles (baseball card collection, etc.) | Jewelry, up to a certain dollar amount |\nSome assets are named as being exempt by federal law, and others may be included depending on your state. Your remaining unsecured debts are then discharged, and you can start over.\nIn order to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, you must not make enough money to be eligible to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy.\nChapter 13 Bankruptcy\nChapter 13 bankruptcy is for those who have a reliable source of income, such as income from a job, but do not make enough money to be able to pay off their debts. Chapter 13 bankruptcy is a reorganization proceeding, so your debts will need to be restructured in such a way that you can pay them off within three to five years.\nIf you have less than $419,275 in unsecured debt and less than $1,257,850 in secured debt, you may be eligible to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy.\nIf you do, you will need to work with the court to come up with a repayment plan that repays some debts in full, including:\n- Child support\n- Tax debts and liens\n- Secured debts like mortgages\n- Some debts to unsecured creditors\nYou must be able to show that you have sufficient income to comply with the terms of the repayment plan and still pay your other living expenses.\nWhat Happens After You File for Bankruptcy?\nA bankruptcy filing is really only the beginning of the process. Here\u2019s what happens next:\n- A trustee will be assigned to your bankruptcy case. They will oversee the liquidation of assets, in the case of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, or the repayment of debts in the case of a Chapter 13 proceeding.\n- You will go to a 341 meeting of creditors. Creditors can attend, but they usually don\u2019t. You\u2019ll be asked about your debts and your assets, under oath.\n- Debt collection procedures will be stopped. This is called an automatic stay.\n- You will take a course on financial management to help you better manage debt in the future. This is a requirement to get your debt discharged.\n- Some of your property may be sold (Chapter 7) or you may begin a repayment plan (Chapter 13).\n- Your debts will be discharged.\nWhat Happens After The Bankruptcy Has Finished\nAfter you file for bankruptcy and the process is completed, your credit score will decrease.\nA bankruptcy will remain on your credit report for seven years if you file for Chapter 13 and 10 years if you file for Chapter 7. This will make it harder \u2014 and more costly \u2014 to get a car loan or mortgage.\nYou\u2019ll also need to begin any repayment plan, if you have one. But, if you adhere to your repayment plan and keep up with your other debt obligations, it\u2019s possible to come out of bankruptcy with a clean slate.\nFiling for bankruptcy can be a way out for those who have gotten into unmanageable debt, but it should not be entered into lightly. It can have a long-term impact on your credit score and your ability to borrow in the future. It\u2019s important to only take on debt that you will be able to manage and only consider bankruptcy as a last resort.\nKaren Doyle contributed to the reporting of this article.\nFAQ\nBankruptcy is complicated, and it's stressful. If you still have questions, hopefully these answers can help.- What will I lose if I file for bankruptcy?\n- What you'll lose if you file for bankruptcy depends on several factors, including whether you have high-value assets and equity in your home that goes beyond your state exemption. Many people are able to keep their homes and a personal vehicle during bankruptcy. You can consult a lawyer to discuss your options before filing if you're concerned.\n- What actually happens when you file for bankruptcy?\n- When you file for bankruptcy, it begins the legal proceedings and an automatic stay takes effect that prevents creditors from pursing collections. You'll need to complete a financial management course, disclose all financial information, attend a meeting with the creditors, and be given bankruptcy terms. If you agree to the terms, your debt will be discharged.\n- What is the downside to a bankruptcy?\n- The biggest downside to a bankruptcy is the impact on your credit. Your credit score will be impacted for 10 years for Chapter 7 bankruptcies and 7 years for Chapter 13 bankruptcies, which can make it difficult to obtain new loans, credit, and more. In some cases, you may also be required to sell or surrender assets that aren't exempt.\n- Is declaring bankruptcy ever a good idea?\n- Yes, declaring a bankruptcy can be a good idea for individuals who have seemingly insurmountable debt and need help getting out from under it. It can be particularly advantageous to those who will be able to keep their homes based on equity exemptions, which vary by state.\nOur in-house research team and on-site financial experts work together to create content that\u2019s accurate, impartial, and up to date.

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nThe three major credit bureaus are Experian, TransUnion and Equifax. Lenders report your activity, typically once per month, to the bureaus (whether you pay on time, how much debt you\u2019re holding, the average age of your accounts, etc.).\nYour credit health depends on the accuracy of each lender\u2019s reporting, so it\u2019s important to keep an eye on your credit report to ensure it\u2019s accurate.\nHow Do Credit Bureaus Actually Work?\nThese three credit bureaus all exist for the same purpose \u2014 to collect information on credit users and businesses regarding their abilities to pay back loans.\nThe bureaus also offer a wide range of financial services and products, including ID theft protection, credit monitoring, credit reports and credit scores. They also serve entities like mortgage brokers, auto dealers and debt collectors by passing along your info when apply to open a new line of credit.\nComparing the Top 3 Credit Reporting Agencies\nWhile these three main credit reporting agencies all exist for the same purpose, they do have some differences.\n| Feature | Equifax | Experian | TransUnion |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Report Style | Highly detailed | Extensive and frequently updated | Clear and easy to navigate |\n| Special Features | Solid monitoring tools | Experian Boost for extra credit | Easy-to-use consumer resources |\n| Credit Score Updates | Unique scoring model | Regular and frequent updates | Steady and reliable updates |\nEquifax: The Comprehensive Tracker\nEquifax is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. In terms of size, it\u2019s the second biggest of the main credit reporting agencies. This is perhaps the most \u201cvanilla\u201d credit bureau, as it doesn\u2019t do many things better than the others. Still, it offers perks like:\n- The ability to freeze your credit with the push of a button on its website or in-app\n- A free monthly credit score and Equifax credit report\n- Up to $500,000 in identity theft insurance for premium users\n- Various fraud alerts, identity restoration and dark web monitoring for premium users\nExperian: Innovative and Detailed\nExperian is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. It\u2019s the largest U.S. credit bureau \u2014 meaning it\u2019s pulled more than any other credit reporting agency when a lender is considering you for a loan.\nExperian comes with many of the same features as Equifax; you\u2019ll get free credit score tracking and credit monitoring, instant credit freezes, etc., with premium members getting advanced identity theft monitoring. But you can also get three-bureau credit monitoring and alerts. Experian even has a family plan that allows you to monitor up to 10 children at once.\nThe credit bureau\u2019s big claim to fame is its unique \u201cExperian Boost\u201d tool, which adjusts your credit score based on activity beyond \u201ctraditional\u201d credit. For example, on-time payments for your rent, utility bills and even Hulu can help to improve your credit score.\nConsidering Experian is the most frequented credit bureau by financial institutions, this can help you get better offers from your credit.\nTransUnion: User-Friendly and Straightforward\nTransUnion is based in Chicago, Illinois. It\u2019s the smallest of the credit bureaus, but its information is no less accurate.\nYou can expect all the standard features offered by Equifax and Experian, like credit freezes, fraud alerts, credit score trends and the ability to intuitively dispute items on your credit report.\nPremium members get fraud resolution support and up to $2 million in identity theft insurance.\nDepending on your plan, you can also benefit from medical identification protection, three-bureau credit monitoring and monitoring of the sex offender registry and criminal records.\nWhy Your Credit Report Matters\nYour credit report is one of the most important components of your finances. It gives lenders the information they need to decide whether you\u2019re a good candidate for whichever products you\u2019re applying for. They also use this information to send you targeted offers (increased credit card welcome bonuses, preapproval for low interest rates, etc.). And, of course, your credit score is based on the content of your credit report.\nAll to say, a credit report matters \u2014 a lot. So you should check it often (at least once per year) to ensure it\u2019s accurate.\nUnsurprisingly, credit reporting data has errors. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau notes that these are the most common errors found on credit reports:\n- Identity errors\n- Incorrect reporting of account status\n- Data management errors\n- Balance errors\nYou can check your credit report for free at AnnualCreditReport.com, or you can pay to see it whenever you like. You\u2019ll generally know if something is super wonky, though, as your credit score may drop unexpectedly. This can be all the prod you need to give it a look.\nFAQ\nHere are some common questions and concerns that come up when you look into the major credit bureaus:- What are the three major credit bureaus?\n- The three major credit bureaus are Experian, Equifax and TransUnion.\n- How do credit bureaus affect my credit score?\n- Credit bureaus take the information they receive from lenders concerning your credit-related activity and add it to your credit file. They score your credit health based on this activity.Lenders typically report to the credit bureaus once per month. While all three credit reporting agencies collect the same type of information, your credit score may vary from bureau to bureau. This is because not all creditors report to all three agencies.\n- For example, you may have a credit card that reports exclusively to Experian. That means Equifax and TransUnion won't have the same information, so they can't factor it into your credit score.\n- Why is it important to monitor my credit report?\n- It's important to monitor your credit report because credit bureaus can sometimes make mistakes that can adversely affect your credit and you may be a victim of fraud without the effects being super apparent. In both of these scenarios, you should reach out to the credit bureaus to have your information corrected\n- How can I improve my credit score?\n- The best way to improve your credit score is by making on-time payments with your current loans. You should also keep your total available credit below 30% (in other words, don't use more than 30% of your credit card limits). Also, avoid opening new credit in rapid succession. Lenders often view this as a red flag that you're scrambling for money.\n- What should I do if I find an error on my credit report?\n- If you find an error on your credit report, you should contact the credit bureau immediately and dispute the discrepancy. Each bureau offers a way to do this on its website.\nEditorial Note: This content is not provided by any entity covered in this article.

      "text": "How a Credit Limit Increase Impacts Your Credit Score\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nWhat Is a Credit Limit Increase?\nA credit limit is the amount that a card issuer allows you to spend on your account. A credit card company may sometimes increase your limit automatically if you use your card regularly and have had a good record of on-time payments. This is because a credit card issuer earns money both when you use your card and when you carry a balance.\nIf you have a higher limit, you might be enticed to spend more money on the card, thereby generating more profits for the card issuer. But many card holders also like to have higher limits to increase their spending flexibility. The easiest way to request a higher limit is online, but you can also call or visit your bank branch to make the request.\nBefore you do, however, it\u2019s important to understand how a credit limit increase impacts your credit score.\nHow Credit Limit Increases Affect Your Credit Score\nThe truth is that some credit limit increases can have little-to-no effect on your score, while others might move it significantly.\nDepending on whether or not you carry a balance, a credit limit increase might improve your credit utilization. This is an important component of your overall credit score, and it\u2019s computed by dividing your existing balances by your total available credit. If you don\u2019t carry a balance, your credit utilization is zero, regardless of how much your credit line goes up. So, in this example, a credit line increase won\u2019t affect you that much.\nWhen your credit line goes up, however, it does increase your amount of total available credit. This doesn\u2019t often move the needle a huge amount in terms of your credit score, but it can play a role.\nIf you request the credit limit increase yourself, it may trigger a hard inquiry, which could decrease your credit score temporarily. However, typically if you already have an existing account and are merely requesting an increase, it doesn\u2019t require a hard inquiry.\nWhen Does a Credit Limit Increase Help Your Score?\nA credit limit increase can increase your score the most if you have high balances on your credit cards. This is because it could dramatically reduce your credit utilization.\nFor example, imagine that you have a credit limit of $2,000 and a balance of $1,500. That puts your credit utilization at 67%. But if you can raise your credit limit to $3,000, your credit utilization will drop to 50%, a change that should push up your credit score.\nOf course, you\u2019ll have to avoid the temptation of spending more money and carrying a larger balance if your credit line increases. That could end up having the opposite effect on your score.\nCan a Credit Limit Increase Hurt Your Score?\nGenerally speaking, a credit limit increase will not hurt your score. However, if you go about getting it the wrong way, or if you abuse it once it\u2019s been granted, you could indeed drive your score down.\nFirst, you should avoid triggering a hard inquiry when you request a credit limit increase. Most times this won\u2019t happen, but be sure to read the fine print before you make your request. Sometimes, a card issuer may require a hard inquiry, but they will tell you beforehand.\nThe other risk of a higher credit limit to your score is that you will start spending more. If you have a credit line of $1,000, for example, you might only think of your card as something to use for groceries, dining out and other everyday expenses. But if your limit jumps to $10,000, you might start thinking about that \u201ctrip of a lifetime\u201d you\u2019ve always imagined.\nThat is not what an increased credit card limit should be used for \u2014 unless you can pay it off in full immediately.\nShould You Request a Credit Limit Increase?\nThere are two primary reasons why you might want to increase your credit limit. The first is if you have a large outstanding balance, as a higher limit can improve your credit utilization ratio and consequently your credit score. The second is if you have a large purchase coming up and need a higher limit to cover it. If you\u2019re collecting credit card points, you might want to use your card for a vacation, for example, even if you have the cash to pay it off. The same would apply to a cash-back credit card.\nThere\u2019s another scenario in which you might want to request a limit increase, although it falls into a bit of a gray area. If you have a large, unexpected expense come up and don\u2019t have the cash to pay for it \u2014 such as a car repair or medical bill \u2014 you might consider asking for an increase to your limit.\nBut understand that you\u2019ll be paying very high interest rates on that balance you carry, which will strain your budget going forward and decrease your credit score.\nHow To Request a Credit Limit Increase\nTo request an increase in your credit limit, contact your credit card issuer. You may be able to request the increase through your account online or via the issuer\u2019s app, or you can call its customer service number and ask directly.\nThere are some factors your issuer will consider when deciding whether to grant you an increased credit limit, such as your income, payment history, credit score and the length of time since your last increase.\nTo increase your chances of having your request approved, there are a few things you can do:\n- Consistently make your payments on time, and pay your balance in full whenever possible.\n- Avoid maxing out your existing credit.\n- Make the issuer aware of any increases in your income.\nYou can also make the process easier by coming prepared \u2014 have documentation of your income, employment and housing payments, and be prepared to argue your case by pointing out your history of paying on time and responsible credit use.\nAlternative Ways To Improve Credit Without Raising Your Limit\nRaising your credit limit is something of an artificial way to improve your credit score, although it can be effective. But there are other, more traditional ways of raising your credit score, as well.\n- Paying down existing balances is the most effective way to boost your score in a short period of time. Every time you lower your total debt amount, you also improve your credit utilization score, and the double whammy does wonders for your credit score. Your total debt comprises 30% of your entire FICO credit score.\n- Making on-time payments is the single best way to improve your credit score overall, as it makes up the largest percentage of your total FICO score, at 35%. However, this is a method that can take time. While one late payment can hurt your score right away, you\u2019ll need months or even years of on-time payments to boost it.\n- Increasing total available credit through other means can raise your score, particularly if you carry a balance, as it will lower your credit utilization ratio. You can raise your total available credit by opening new accounts, but understand that a new credit inquiry will act as a drag on your score, potentially negating the boost from raising your available credit.\nFAQ\nHere are the answers to some common questions about how your credit limit affects your credit score.- Does requesting a credit limit increase result in a hard inquiry?\n- Rarely, since you already have an existing account. However, some issuers may make a hard inquiry, and they will inform you of that fact before you submit your request.\n- How long does a credit limit increase take to reflect on my credit report?\n- Your credit card issuer will report the increase to the credit reporting agencies when your next statement is issued.\n- What happens if my credit limit increase request is denied?\n- A credit limit increase denial won't typically hurt your credit score, unless the card issuer made a hard inquiry. However, it also likely means that your card issuer doesn't believe you have the financial capacity to take on any new debt.\n- Can a credit card issuer lower my limit if I don't use it?\n- Yes, a credit card issuer can modify your credit limit at any time, upwards or downwards, at its discretion.\nOur in-house research team and on-site financial experts work together to create content that\u2019s accurate, impartial, and up to date.

Lenders use both: the score gives a quick risk assessment, but the full report provides context such as late payments or bankruptcies that can affect loan terms. To improve your score, focus on on\u2011time payments, low credit utilization, and accurate reporting, and regularly review all three bureaus\u2019 reports for errors or identity theft.
