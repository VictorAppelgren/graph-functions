  "description": "King Charles's Norfolk residence, Sandringham Estate, will temporarily close to the public mid-August.",
  "content": "Sandringham Estate in Norfolk will temporarily close to the public during the busy summer season due to the upcoming Heritage Live concert series. A statement shared on Sandringham\u2019s official Instagram account confirmed that the estate will be off-limits to the public from August 14 to 17. It comes as friends of the Duchess of Sussex are set to perform at the concert, including singers Mariah Carey and Michael Bubl\u00e9. The event takes place across the 25,000-acre property owned by King Charles. The statement issued on the Sandringham Estate official website reads: \"The Sandringham Estate will be closed to general visitors from 14th-17th August for Heritage Live's concert series. This includes our Visitor Centre car parks, Courtyard facilities (including our caf\u00e9 and restaurant), and our play area. We look forward to welcoming visitors back from the 18th August onwards. Thank you in advance for your understanding.\"\n\nThe concert will give attendees a rare opportunity to enjoy the estate\u2019s grounds, but the King will not be in residence during the event because he is expected to spend the summer months at Balmoral Castle. Earlier this month, the King is understood to have visited Sandringham, but the Royal Family typically reserves the Norfolk residence for his traditional Christmas celebrations. Balmoral Castle is also preparing to shut its gates to the public. Since April 1, visitors have been able to explore the castle\u2019s grounds and historic ballroom as part of a special exhibition. However, public access will end on August 10, just days before Sandringham's own temporary closure. The castle was also closed on August 4 due to Storm Floris when visitors were advised not to travel to the estate. Balmoral Castle has been the royal family's summer escape since the reign of Queen Victoria and King Charles, 76, has continued his late mother Queen Elizabeth's tradition of spending some of the late summer in Scotland.\n\nMariah Carey who is set to perform at The Heritage Live concert series, jokingly agreed with a radio presenter to ask about taxes and congestion charges after performing at Sandringham. The popstar made the comments during an interview with Capital's Manny Norte. The presenter asked Mariah: \"Is there anything you'd ask the King?\" She replied: \"No, because I just want to leave him alone. I don't want to bother people.\" The presenter said: \"I'll ask him a few things. Like, no tax, no congestion, straight away, you know?\" The American responded: \"See, I'm not from this country, so\u2026\" Norte added: \"That's what I want: No tax, no congestion, no parking [fees] for the rest of my life. You know what I mean?\" The singer then eventually agreed she would ask on behalf of the presenter when she appears at the monarch's beloved countryside home.",
