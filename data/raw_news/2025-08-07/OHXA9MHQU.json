Watling Street, Hinckley, Leicestershire - struck 25 times\n2. Bromford Road, Oldbury, West Midlands - struck 24 times\n3. St John's Street, Lichfield, Staffordshire - struck 23 times\n4.

      "text": "'I helped repair Britain's most bashed bridge'\n- Published\nA former British Rail engineer has described how he helped repair and replace a bridge in the 1970s that in recent years has become notorious for being frequently bashed.\nThe A5 Watling Street railway bridge in Hinckley, Leicestershire, which has previously held the title as Britain's most bashed, has been struck more than a dozen times this year.\nBrian Maddison remembers when the bridge had to be replaced after being raised \"about 3ft in the air\" in an accident in 1975, external, adding a local worker was able to avert disaster by stopping a train that was approaching the damaged structure.\nWhen asked about the bridge's recent troubles, the 78-year-old joked: \"Stop hitting my bridge!\"\nDiscussions are ongoing about a solution to the issues at the bridge, which was dubbed Britain's \"most bashed\" when it was hit 25 times between 2019 and 2020.\nAgrarian Development Holdings has been given permission to build a warehouse and office complex on a nearby site.\nPart of the project would include lowering the road under the bridge.\nWhile this could solve the bridge strike issue, Hinckley and Bosworth Borough Council has warned it would create long-term traffic problems.\nNational Highways has now told the BBC the project to lower the road level under the bridge could start in the spring.\nBrian, from Bingham in Nottinghamshire, explained he and a team of British Rail engineers were called to the scene in 1975.\n\"An excavator on the back of a low loader lorry came through from the south, and they hadn't quite stowed the arm down low enough,\" he said.\n\"It cleared the first girder of the bridge, but then struck the girder on the far side and because of the angle and the strength of the arm of the excavator, it actually managed to raise the bridge about 3ft in the air, which of course was an extremely dangerous situation.\"\nImmediately after the bridge was put out of action, Brian said disaster was averted due to the quick actions of a local worker.\nBrian added: \"Fortunately, a man who was working at a firm on the other side of the bridge heard the crash and saw the danger and ran up on to the railway to stop an approaching train - otherwise it would have been a real disaster.\"\nAfter the accident, the challenge was to get the route open for road vehicles and trains as soon as possible.\nBrian said: \"I went to our stock yard at Toton [in Nottinghamshire] and arranged to load up a couple of temporary beams that could be used to reinstate one of the lines.\n\"I think within about three days, we got the first line open. We got the temporary bridge put in, which enabled the railway and the road to reopen.\"\nThe temporary bridge proved to be successful and stayed in use for a year while a new main bridge section was designed and constructed.\nThen time was found to install the new bridge, which has remained in place to the current day.\nBrian worked for British Rail for 31 years before starting his own private sector company, which also carried out rail projects.\nReturning to the site of the bridge for the first time in decades, he said: \"I've enjoyed looking at it. I see they've added on some protection beams since I was here, but other than that it's the same bridge.\"\nNational Highways has now confirmed to the BBC that it is working with developers to \"achieve technical assurance, which includes flood alleviation work\" before work on lowering the road can begin.\n\"Plans to lower the road are being undertaken by Padge Hall Development, which has planning consent in place and hopes to start work in the spring of 2025,\" a spokesperson added.\nBrian is in support of the plan to lower the road to allow larger vehicles to pass through.\n\"That is certainly the most economic option, because the option of raising the railway line is very expensive because you can only alter the gradient on a line by a very small amount, so to raise the bridge you would have to maybe raise the line for a mile in each direction, gradually, to get the height you needed,\" he added.\nHe hopes this work will finally put an end to the troubles at the bridge.\n\"Even though that might not be an easy thing to do... engineering-wise it's certainly possible,\" he added.\nGet in touch\nTell us which stories we should cover in Leicester\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, external, on X, external, or on Instagram, external.

      "text": "Why do vehicles keep hitting this railway bridge?\n- Published\nOn Wednesday a railway bridge - which previously held the title for Britain's most bashed - was hit by a lorry for the 13th time in 2024.\nAnd it was revealed last year that the A5 Watling Street bridge in Hinckley, Leicestershire, had been hit by high vehicles 88 times between 2017 and September 2022.\nIt begs the question - why does this keep happening?\nWhat happened this week?\nThe A5 was closed in both directions on Wednesday morning after a lorry crashed into the railway bridge and shed its load.\nThe road was closed between the A47 and junction 1 of the M69 and later reopened.\nThere were no reports of any injuries, Leicestershire Police confirmed.\nWhen was it Britain's most bashed?\nThe bridge was dubbed the \"most bashed\" in Britain when it was hit 25 times between 2019 and 2020.\nNetwork Rail reported that the railway bridge saw crashes almost once a fortnight on average in the year to the end of March.\nLater, between 2022 and 2023, it lost that particular title - and instead became the sixth most bashed bridge, according to Network Rail statistics.\nAnd since October 2023 to the present day, the bridge has been struck 14 times - a rise from the same one-year period between October 2022 and October 2023.\nWhat impact has each bridge bash had?\nTransport body Midlands Connect analysed four occasions when the bridge was hit and found the resulting traffic delays cost the economy a combined \u00a3126,000.\nIt also calculated the cost of rail delays for 10 incidents during 2019, which caused nearly 4,000 passengers to be delayed, to be roughly \u00a343,000 to the economy.\nMidlands Connect said regular collisions at the bridge had caused more than 4,400 hours of road delays each year, adding the real cost of bridge strikes could be significantly higher than the figure calculated.\nNetwork Rail said bridge strikes costed the UK taxpayer an estimated \u00a323m per year.\nSwati Mittal, integrated transport programme lead at Midlands Connect, said: \"Bridge strikes in Hinckley cost businesses, commuters and residents thousands of hours of delays every year.\n\"It's no surprise that we are seeing another strike, adding to the already long list of evidence for upgrades to this road.\n\"This bridge regularly tops lists of some of Britain's most bashed bridges and we know the impact of these strikes is felt across the Midlands.\n\"We continue to work to highlight the strategic and economic importance of this route our region.\"\nDr Luke Evans, the Conservative MP for Hinckley and Bosworth, said changes were needed after Wednesday's crash.\nThe MP said he had arranged a meeting with the government to push for work to be carried out.\nOn Thursday, he posted on social media: \"Every time the Watling Street bridge is hit - like it was yesterday - Hinckley, Higham on the Hill, Wykin and Burbage become a rat run, putting even more pressure on the roads in our town and villages.\n\"This morning I reiterated the issue of the Watling Street bridge and the need for improvements to the A5 with the new transport secretary.\n\"I'm pleased to have secured a meeting with the roads minister and will continue to push for the necessary improvements.\"\nWhy does this keep happening?\nLeicestershire county councillor David Bill, whose division covers the bridge, says drivers are warned that it is low clearance, but on occasion \"somebody just ignores the obvious concern and they just press on and crash into the bridge\".\nHe added: \"It's extraordinary the number of drivers who are reckless and think that they can get a tall vehicle under a small bridge.\"\nWhen asked why the bridge continues to be struck, Samantha Pinnock - National Highways route manager - said the agency inspected its A-roads weekly as standard.\n\"Should any defects be identified, including worn road markings or inadequate signage, these are acted upon,\" she said.\n\"Safety is always our priority and we work closely with police and transport industry partners to help make our roads as safe as they can possibly be.\n\"We'd remind all road users and particularly HGV drivers about the importance of knowing the height of your vehicle and planning your route in advance \u2013 follow the road signs, not just the sat-nav.\"\nWhat solutions are planned?\nAgrarian Development Holdings was given permission in June 2023 to build a warehouse and office complex on a nearby site.\nPart of the project would include lowering the road under the bridge.\nHinckley and Bosworth Borough Council's planning committee approved the scheme, and said while it could solve the bridge strike issue - it warned it would create long-term traffic problems.\nA spokesperson for National Highways told the BBC that plans to lower the road are being undertaken by the developer, but could not confirm a timeframe for the work.\nThey said: \"We are currently working with them to achieve technical assurance and once agreed, the works can be undertaken.\n\"We are working collaboratively and at pace with the developer to achieve this status.\n\"Unfortunately, there are a number of complexities which have to be approved.\"\nMr Bill said he was concerned that if the road was lowered, there would be flooding issues and questioned if there was a fall-back plan if the lowering did not go ahead.\nHe added: \"Everybody else seems to have stopped looking at solutions, and are banking everything on dropping the road a few feet.\"\nGet in touch\nTell us which stories we should cover in Leicester\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, external, on X, external, or on Instagram, external.
