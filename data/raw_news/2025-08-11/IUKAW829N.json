  "description": "The parents of Kevin Mares, who was killed in the La Perla area of San Juan while on a trip to see a Bad Bunny concert, seek 'justice' on behalf of their slain family member.",
  "content": "New York City native Kevin Mares was killed Sunday in the La Perla neigborhood of San Juan, Puerto Rico. The 25-year-old was visiting the island to see a Bad Bunny concert.\n\nMares was fatally shot in the early morning hours, outside of a nightclub called Shelter for Mistreated Men. The shooting took place when several people near Mares began arguing and one pulled out a gun and shot at least three people, the Associated Press reported.\n\nHomicide detective Sgt. Arnaldo Ruiz told the AP that Mares was an innocent bystander in the situation and that a pair of siblings from La Perla remain hospitalized after being shot. No arrests have yet been made.\n\nMares was joined by his girlfriend and two friends in Puerto Rico. It was his partner who ended up delivering the news of his death to Mares\u2019 parents.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What happened?\u2019 She said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry. We lost him,\u2019 \u201d Hector Mares, Kevin\u2019s father, told CBS News New York.\n\n\u201cWhoever did this, took from us a piece of us, you know?\u201d Kevin\u2019s mother, Sandra Mares, added.\n\nA longtime Bad Bunny fan, Mares and his friends were consistently in attendance of the \u201cLa Mudanza\u201d singer\u2019s concerts and had been prepping for their San Juan trip for months.\n\n\u201cEvery time Bad Bunny comes here, they go to most all of his concerts,\u201d Sandra Mares said.\n\nMares \u2014 whose parents are originally from Mexico \u2014 was born and raised in the East Elmhurst neighborhood of Queens and was studying to be a veterinarian at LaGuardia Community College.\n\n\u201cHe got a lot of dreams. He was working as a vet technician. And at the same time he was studying,\u201d his father told ABC 7 New York.\n\n\u201cHe was about to propose to [his girlfriend] this fall. Yeah. He wanted to do something special. He shared that with us,\u201d his mother added. \u201cHe was a lovely son. He cared about all of us, his family, friends. He has a lot of friends who\u2019s really going to miss him, too.\u201d\n\nNow, the Mares family is asking for anyone with information about the shooter and more specifics about the incident to please step forward.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re asking the people is, if anybody knows what happened, who did this, [to say something],\u201d his mother told CBS. \u201cWe don\u2019t know [anything]. We want justice.\u201d\n\nThe family is currently making efforts toward having Mares\u2019 body returned home, but it remains in Puerto Rico as the investigation into his death is still ongoing.\n\nKevin\u2019s father started a GoFundMe to raise enough money \u2014 the campaign\u2019s target is currently $50,000 \u2014 to plan Kevin\u2019s funeral arrangements.\n\n\u201cKevin Mares was a deeply loved son, devoted friend, and a source of inspiration to everyone who knew him. His wholehearted kindness, adventurous spirit, and unwavering commitment to family made him a pillar of strength for his loved ones,\u201d the GofundMe page states. \u201cFamily was at the center of everything he did, and his sudden passing has left an unfillable void in our lives. ... Your support will help us honor Kevin\u2019s memory and give him the farewell he deserves.\u201d",

      "text": "\u2018They were so innocent\u2019: Orange mass shooting shattered a family business; victims remembered\n- Share via\nLuis Tovar lived for his family.\nAn avid outdoorsman, the 50-year-old frequently loaded them up in his fifth-wheel for camping trips to Arizona. He sat them on the back of his Harley-Davidson motorcycle to ride through the hills above Fullerton. They spent every Fourth of July, Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas gathered at his home in northeast Anaheim.\nAnd when he launched Unified Homes in 2006 with the goal of helping people buy, sell and remodel their manufactured homes, it was only fitting that his family be part of that, too. But this week, a business he built from the ground up became the setting for tragedy.\nOn Wednesday, a gunman entered the office building on West Lincoln Avenue and opened fire, killing Tovar; his daughter Genevieve Raygoza, 28; longtime employee Leticia Solis Guzman, 58; and 9-year-old Matthew Farias, who was Genevieve\u2019s half-brother.\nMatthew\u2019s mother, Blanca Tamayo, who is also Genevieve\u2019s mother, was wounded and remains in critical condition. She also worked at Unified Homes. When police arrived, they found Tamayo\u2019s arms wrapped around her young son, according to the Tovar family.\nThe suspect, 44-year-old Aminadab Gaxiola Gonzalez, is facing multiple counts of murder and attempted murder, along with felony enhancements. Gonzalez had two children with a former employee of Unified Homes, the Tovar family said.\nOrange suspect faces four counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder.\nIn one day, Vania Tovar, 28, had her father, half-sister and members of her large, tight-knit extended family ripped away.\n\u201cMy dad was everything for us,\u201d she said through tears Friday. \u201cHe was the kindest person. Whenever anyone needed something, even if he hadn\u2019t seen them in years, he was willing to give them the shirt off his back. Our whole family is just so confused. They were so innocent in all of this.\u201d\nLuis Tovar was an Orange County native. He was so well-liked at Anaheim High School that students crowned him prom king his senior year. He later earned a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree in business administration and finance from Cal State Fullerton and had talked about pursuing a juris doctorate, according to his family.\nAs a father, Tovar had a strict set of rules for his five children. He expected them to eat well, get good grades and work hard. He was much softer with his six grandchildren.\n\u201cWaffles and ice cream \u2014 that\u2019s what he considered to be a good breakfast for his grandkids,\u201d Vania Tovar said.\nKennedy Gonzalez, 21, said he felt a mixture of anger and sadness when he learned that one of the victims of the mass shooting was an old family friend \u2014 Luis Tovar.\n\u201cHe was a good man, a family man,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cHe always took care of my family.\u201d\nLuis Tovar was especially close to daughter Genevieve Raygoza, whom Vania Tovar described as being \u201csunshine on a cloudy day.\u201d\nVirus restrictions are being lifted, but recent shootings in Orange County, Georgia and Colorado may spur anxiety about reentering public spaces. Here are some safety tips.\nFather and daughter shared a love for the outdoors and a passion for their business. She worked for him as a transaction manager at Unified Homes for a decade.\nHer husband, Armando Raygoza, works on the construction side of the business. But the couple\u2019s story began long before they became colleagues. Friendship blossomed into love inside a calculus classroom at Fullerton College. Genevieve Raygoza captured Armando\u2019s attention the moment she stepped into the classroom.\n\u201cShe was beautiful. I saw her and immediately knew I had to sit as close as I could to her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe had it all \u2014 beauty and brains \u2014 and a huge heart.\u201d\nWhen the instructor suggested classmates exchange information to work collaboratively on assignments, she surprised him by asking for his phone number before he could ask for hers. After two years of dating, they had their first child \u2014 a son they named Nathaniel. They married a few years later and then welcomed their second son, Andres.\nFor Armando, it\u2019s the everyday moments \u2014 the bike rides to the park with their boys or the way she lay next to them reading bedtime stories night after night \u2014 that mean the most.\n\u201cWe were supposed to grow old together,\u201d he said, his voice breaking with emotion. \u201cLuis would always tell us to enjoy life because we don\u2019t know how long we have together, but we didn\u2019t think it would be this short.\u201d\nLeticia Solis Guzman, who was among those killed in the violence, was a longtime sales executive at Unified Homes. In her profile picture on Facebook, Solis is standing next to Luis Tovar\u2019s daughters in front of a giant Christmas tree in what appears to be the family\u2019s living room. The top of Solis\u2019 Facebook page reads in Spanish: \u201cI\u2019m a Leo, a warrior, cool, cheerful, I love dancing, I love my family and happiness.\u201d\nPolice say suspect Aminadab Gaxiola Gonzalez had a \u201cbusiness and personal relationship\u201d with the victims\nThe Solis family could not be reached for comment. Yolanda Torres, an acquaintance of Solis, said she hadn\u2019t learned what happened to her until Friday.\n\u201cHonestly, this was difficult to take in,\u201d she said. \u201cShe was an excellent person that I had the luck of knowing. This was honestly difficult news, we\u2019re living in such difficult times.\u201d\nThe day of the shooting just happened to be one of the days that Matthew Farias, 9, accompanied his mom to work at Unified Homes instead of going to day care, his aunt Rosie Farias said Friday. Hoover Elementary School in Santa Ana, where Matthew was a third-grader, is doing distance learning because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFermin Leal, Santa Ana Unified School District\u2019s chief communications officer, said in a statement that the district was \u201cheartbroken by [the] senseless act of violence\u201d that claimed Matthew\u2019s life.\nThe victims of the Orange mass shooting were connected through a mobile home business where the violence occurred.\nMatthew\u2019s death is like the loss of one of her own children, Rosie Farias said. She lives just two miles from Ralph Farias, her younger brother and Matthew\u2019s father, in Santa Ana. Before the pandemic, their kids spent almost every other weekend together. Matthew cherished every moment he spent with his family, she said.\n\u201cHe sometimes didn\u2019t want to leave, whether he was at my house, my husband, my sister, my brother. It didn\u2019t matter, he just wanted to stay there longer. He just loved the family,\u201d she said.\nAlthough the boy\u2019s death has rocked their family, Rosie Farias says she\u2019s mostly concerned about Ralph. Matthew was his only child. She said he seemed sad and lost \u2014 his eyes teary \u2014 but she didn\u2019t think the reality had fully hit him. She suspects that will change once he goes to the coroner\u2019s office.\n\u201cI feel like that\u2019s when it\u2019s gonna all come down,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be coming home \u2014 alone.\u201d\nTimes librarian Cary Schneider contributed to this report."

      "text": "Bad Bunny fan who visited Puerto Rico for concert is fatally shot, police say\n- Share via\nSAN JUAN, Puerto Rico \u2014 A Bad Bunny fan who was visiting Puerto Rico for the hip-hop star\u2019s concert residency was fatally shot early Sunday in La Perla, a popular seaside shantytown in the capital, police said.\nThe victim was identified as Kevin Mares, a 25-year-old who lived in New York, according to a police statement.\nThe shooting happened in the predawn hours at a nightspot called Shelter for Mistreated Men in La Perla, a coastal community of San Juan that has struggled to shed its dark reputation.\nHomicide detective Sgt. Arnaldo Ruiz said in a phone interview that the shooting took place when several people near Mares began arguing and one pulled out a gun and shot at least three people, including Mares.\nA brother and a sister in their mid-40s who live in La Perla were injured and remain hospitalized.\nRuiz said Mares was an innocent bystander. He was with three other friends who told police they were in Puerto Rico for one of Bad Bunny\u2019s 30 concerts, which have attracted tens of thousands of visitors to the U.S. territory, where the artist was born.\nMares was shot on the left side of his abdomen and was taken to Puerto Rico\u2019s largest public hospital, where he died, authorities said.\nRuiz said police don\u2019t yet know what the people were arguing about and don\u2019t have a description of the shooter. \u201cWe have very little information,\u201d he said.\nRuiz added that Mares\u2019 three friends also were from New York. He didn\u2019t know their hometowns.\nLa Perla is on the outskirts of Old San Juan, a historic district popular with tourists. A couple of hundred people live in the shantytown, which once served as Puerto Rico\u2019s biggest distribution point for heroin and was known for its violence.\nPolice used to avoid the community, which used to have a sign proclaiming, \u201cNot open to visitors. Do not enter.\u201d\nBut violence eased when hundreds of federal agents raided the slum in 2011 and arrested dozens of people, including a well-known community leader who was later convicted.\nThe neighborhood became even safer and more welcoming after Puerto Rican singers Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee featured it in their hit \u201cDespacito.\u201d\nBut isolated violence persists.\nIn February 2023, three tourists were stabbed after police said a person told them to stop recording in the community.\nIn April last year, a 24-year-old tourist from Delaware was killed and his body set on fire, police said, after he and a friend were attacked after a drug purchase. Police said the victims were trying to take pictures of La Perla after being warned to not do so.\nThe island of 3.2 million people has reported 277 killings so far this year, compared with 325 killings in the same period last year.\nCoto writes for the Associated Press."

      "text": "City OKs $5.75-million settlement in death of Marine veteran stun-gunned by LAPD\n- Share via\nThe Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday unanimously approved a $5.75-million settlement with the parents of a Marine veteran who died after an LAPD officer stunned him six times with a Taser during a Christmas Eve altercation five years ago.\nMichael Frederick Mears, 39, went into cardiac arrest about an hour after he was detained on Dec. 24, 2014, and died two days later. A Los Angeles County coroner\u2019s report determined Mears died from ventricular dysrhythmia because of an enlarged heart and noted that cocaine intoxication and police restraint by a Taser were contributing factors. His death was ruled a homicide by the coroner.\nA federal jury in November 2017 awarded Mears\u2019 family $5.5 million after finding that officers used excessive and unreasonable force while seeking to restrain him.\n\u201cIt is very hard on the family members, all this time waiting for justice. The trial was ever so tough for them, but when the city appeals and drags it out for two years, it is particularly painful,\u201d said Brian Dunn, one of the family\u2019s attorneys.\nMears\u2019 roommate called paramedics on Christmas Eve 2014 reporting that the military veteran was having a paranoid episode and complaining that someone was coming to get him. An LAPD sergeant and five officers responded to Mears\u2019 South Los Angeles apartment and tried to physically restrain him before using pepper spray and batons, records show. During the confrontation, one of the officers \u2014 Jonathan Gan \u2014 discharged a Taser, striking Mears six times over the course of three minutes, according to court documents.\nLaw enforcement personnel can use Tasers in two ways: either by firing two electrified darts from several feet away, delivering a sharp shock that freezes a person\u2019s muscles and temporarily incapacitates him, or in \u201cdrive-stun mode,\u201d in which the device is pressed directly against a person\u2019s skin and creates pain to gain compliance.\n\u201cThe death was ruled a homicide by the coroner because of the electronic restraint procedure,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cThe officer with the Taser applied it for 32 seconds at one point.\u201d\nThe time during which the stun gun was administered to Mears is more than twice the 15-second maximum recommended by the Police Executive Research Forum, which advises police departments across the country on policy.\nA year after Mears\u2019 death, the Los Angeles Police Commission deemed the use of force in the encounter within department policy, but it did warrant a tactical debriefing.\nThe report described a violent struggle in which officers repeatedly tried to restrain Mears, who was described as weighing approximately 305 pounds and covered in blood, acting in a manner that made him unsafe to approach. Gan said he didn\u2019t recall discharging the stun gun for such a long period of time and thought the weapon had an automatic turn-off after five seconds, according to the commission\u2019s summary.\nAttorneys for the city declined to comment on the settlement Wednesday. During the jury trial, the city\u2019s lawyers argued that Mears was responsible for his own death because of a rage fueled by cocaine and said officers were trying to stop him from harming himself and others.\nThe deadly encounter is still under review by the district attorney\u2019s office, a spokesman said Wednesday.\nIn finding that officers used excessive and unreasonable force while restraining Mears, the jury said the Police Department had inadequate training when it came to less-lethal restraint methods.\nAn investigation by Reuters has examined records of more than 1,000 people who have died in the United States following encounters with police in which Tasers were used either on their own or, more often, as part of a larger use of force. According to the 2017 investigation, medical examiners cited the Taser as a cause or contributing factor in the death in at least 153 cases. A U.S. Department of Justice-funded study, however, found that 99.75% of field uses of stun guns resulted in no injuries.\nA Times investigation in 2016 found that of the 1,100 times an LAPD officer used his or her Taser, the weapon worked just 53% of the time.\nTimes staff writer Emily Alpert Reyes contributed to this report."

      "text": "Bad Bunny\u2019s residency gives local artists the chance to tell Puerto Rico\u2019s real history\n- Share via\nHello, this is De Los reporter Carlos De Loera. I will be taking over the Latinx Files for the next couple of months while Fidel is on parental leave. I hope I do him justice!\n\u201cNo me quiero ir de aqu\u00ed.\u201d\nIt\u2019s more than just the name of Bad Bunny\u2019s months-long Puerto Rico concert residency; it\u2019s a radical declaration against colonialism and gentrification, as well as a defiant call for cultural preservation and celebration.\nThis week the U.S. federal government exercised another overreach of power over Puerto Rico, when the Trump administration dismissed five out of seven members of Puerto Rico\u2019s federal control board that oversees the U.S. territory\u2019s finances. All of the fired board members belonged to the Democratic Party; the remaining two members are Republicans.\nAs other parts of the Spanish-speaking world grapple with being priced out of their own communities, and a watering down of their long-standing cultures, artists in Puerto Rico are using their work to give visitors a not-so-gentle reminder: No one can kick them out of their own home.\nLast week, the Latinx advocacy group Mijente \u2014 alongside the art collective AgitArte \u2014 collaborated with local Puerto Rican artists and organizations to present a free art exhibition that highlights the everyday societal struggles of Boricuas. Located in the Santurce barrio of San Juan, the \u201cDe Aqu\u00ed Nadie Nos Saca\u201d exhibit is marketing itself as a spiritual companion piece to Bad Bunny\u2019s album, \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos,\u201d by delving into the musical joy and ongoing resistance movements of the island.\nThe name of the exhibition itself is a play on the lyrics from Bad Bunny\u2019s track \u201cLa Mudanza,\u201d in which he sings, \u201cDe aqu\u00ed nadie me saca\u201d \u2014 \u201cnobody can get me out of here.\u201d But the space has more than just a thematic connection to the Grammy-winning artist.\nMembers of AgitArte and one of its affiliated community theater collectives, Papel Machete, contributed to the \u201cLa Mudanza\u201d music video by providing a giant papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 puppet named La Maestra Combativa. It can be seen in the last minute of the video, holding up a colorful sign that reads \u201cDe aqu\u00ed nadie me saca.\u201d\nThe momentum of Bad Bunny\u2019s latest album and subsequent tour met Mijente\u2019s mission at a serendipitous time that led to the creation of the new showcase.\n\u201cThe socio-cultural moment and the political moment needed different kinds of things, not just the normal playbook of social work,\u201d said Mijente communications director Enrique C\u00e1rdenas Sifre. \u201cWe needed to experiment a little bit more.\u201d\nAccording to C\u00e1rdenas Sifre, part of the hope for the exhibition is to combat a pervasive narrative that Latinx people are more conservative-leaning than they realize.\nBad Bunny\u2019s sentiment of \u201ctodo el mundo quiere ser latino\u201d \u2014 and the universal praise and online utilization of \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\u201d \u2014 allowed for Mijente to reopen the conversation about the true values of Latinx people in Puerto Rico.\n\u201cWe can use the opportunity of a mainstream event to experiment with reoccupying and reutilizing all the cultural work for our causes,\u201d he said. \u201cFor immigration causes, for liberation, decolonization, social, racial, gender equity and struggles ... especially in Puerto Rico. So all of that came together at the same time.\u201d\nWith hundreds of thousands of tourists descending upon the island to watch the \u201cBaile Inolvidable\u201d singer perform, it seemed like the right time to challenge tourists to engage with some of the more difficult and harrowing experiences of Puerto Ricans.\n\u201cNo seas un turista m\u00e1s,\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t be just another tourist,\u201d is one of the main phrases used to advertise the exhibition, which asks people to confront colonialism, gender dynamics, environmental ruin, state violence and displacement.\n\u201cIf you only have a few moments to be in San Juan [for the tour], please come to the exposition and help us amplify, connect and support all the local organizations that are doing the work,\u201d C\u00e1rdenas Sifre said. \u201cNo seas un turista m\u00e1s, conoce un poco de la historia real de Puerto Rico.\u201d\nTelling the \u201creal history\u201d of the island are over 39 artists and organizations \u2014 with special help from AgitArte curator Dey Hern\u00e1ndez \u2014 that make up \u201ca piece\u201d of the whole movement that Mijente is pushing for.\n\u201cWe always try to recognize that we need joy, we need perreo, we need our culture, we need our saz\u00f3n, but at the same time, we keep fighting for the things that we want in our lives and in our future,\u201d C\u00e1rdenas Sifre said. \u201cWe want to go a little bit deeper for tourists to understand that it\u2019s generations of struggle. So you can come to the exposition and support by donating directly to an organization or artist that is presenting.\u201d\nOpen from Wednesday through Sunday, the exhibition will continue showcasing its works through early October. After its opening weekend, organizers of the event are enthused by the intergenerational crowds and the litany of responses the art has elicited.\n\u201cThey see their fights, they see themselves in the exhibition,\u201d C\u00e1rdenas Sifre said. \u201cSome people have to go outside to cry for a minute, because there hadn\u2019t been a place that hit on all these social battles and they recognize the years of work that went behind collecting it all. There\u2019s also joy and celebration, it\u2019s really run the gamut of every emotion.... Everyone tells us that this space was needed.\u201d\nOne thing that C\u00e1rdenas Sifre wanted to make clear is that the exhibit is not affiliated with any electoral political alliance, but rather a \u201creal new alliance of the folks doing the work on the ground every day.\u201d\n\u201cThese organizations and artists don\u2019t always have a space to come together to talk about the work that [they] are doing, talk about the struggles they are facing. [It\u2019s about] generating a little space [to] conspire the next [steps for] the movement in Puerto Rico.\u201d\nComic this Week: Drag, DACA, and Departure\nJulio Salgado is a visual artist based in Long Beach.

Police say he was an innocent bystander.\nKevin shared video of a beautiful beach view and pool party at his hotel on Saturday night, but it was when he and some friends wandered off the resort grounds into La Perla that they were suddenly in danger.\n\"They were walking, and then across the street, it was like a bunch of bunch of people, arguing and they start fighting each other. So one of them, they took out a gun. So he starts shooting, like random,\" said his mother, Sandra Mares.\n\"And my son was across the street and he got shot in the abdomen,\" added his father, Hector Mares.\nKevin's parents are originally from Mexico but he was born and raised in Queens, with one younger brother.\nHe loved animals, like his dog, Jessie, and wanted to be a veterinarian. He was studying at LaGuardia Community College.\n\"He got a lot of dreams. He was working as a vet technician. And at the same time he was studying,\" added his father.\nHe had been dating his girlfriend for several years.\n\"He was about to propose to her, this fall. Yeah. He wants to do something special. He shared that with us,\" said his mother.\nHis girlfriend was in Puerto Rico with him, but stayed at the hotel after the party while he and her brother and a friend ventured out -- something his parents say they'd warned him not to do.\n\"We told him just stay in the hotel and that's in the resort,\" his father said.\n\"But they're young. When you're young, sometimes you don't think,\" added his mother.\nOn Sunday night the Mares family got support from loved ones, surrounded with photos of happy memories.\n\"He was a lovely son. He cared. He cared about all of us, his family, friends. He has a lot of friends who's really going to miss him, too,\" said his mother.\nThe Mares family is hoping for an arrest in the shooting that detectives told them also wounded a man and woman in their 40s.\nThey desperately want his body returned home to Queens as quickly as possible.

      "text": "After Army veteran is gunned down at party, authorities offer reward to find suspect\n- Share via\nDetectives from the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department are searching for a man suspected of shooting to death a U.S. Army veteran at a birthday party in December.\nThe night of Dec. 19, 2020, Ismael Zabala, 26, went to his aunt\u2019s home in the 400 block of West Avenue J 12 in Lancaster to celebrate his cousin\u2019s birthday.\nThe 26-year-old \u2014 the second of eight children \u2014 was accompanied by several of his brothers. He\u2019d been looking forward to the party and bought a new shirt to wear, his father, Alex Zabala, said Tuesday.\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t wait for that day. He was inviting everyone he could.\u201d\nOne of the guests Zabala had invited, a young woman, showed up with two men he didn\u2019t know, his father said.\nAt some point that night, the two men were asked to leave the party, authorities said. Around 2 a.m., they got into an argument with their hosts on the doorstep that escalated into a physical struggle, according to Sheriff\u2019s Lt. Derrick Alfred. Zabala intervened and was punched by one of the men, Alfred said.\nBoth of the party guests drew handguns, and one of the men \u2014 identified by sheriff\u2019s officials as Oscar Palazuelos, 20 \u2014 fired a single shot into Zabala\u2019s chest, Alfred said. His younger brother was shot in the thumb, according to Alex Zabala. The two armed men then fled.\nAlfred declined to name the man authorities said accompanied Palazuelos to the party, but sheriff\u2019s officials identified him in a motion submitted to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors as Ervin Alvarez. Alvarez, 22, was arrested in February, pleaded no contest to one count of attempted murder and was sentenced in April to 19 years in state prison, according to court records.\nAs for Palazuelos, \u201cthe trail\u2019s kind of run cold,\u201d Alfred said Tuesday. He was known to stay in the Antelope Valley, but he also frequented the Highland Park area, where he boasted of being affiliated with a local gang, the lieutenant said. Palazuelos may have recently returned to the Antelope Valley, authorities said.\nThe Sheriff\u2019s Department has offered a $20,000 reward, funded by the Board of Supervisors and the city of Lancaster, for information leading to Palazuelos\u2019 arrest.\nAlex Zabala called it a sad but undeniable truth that a reward might close his son\u2019s case.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the way society is, money moves people,\u201d he said.\nThe elder Zabala said he had tried to shield his children from the violence and gangs that encircled their onetime home in South Los Angeles. They moved, beginning when Ismael Zabala was young, to El Monte, West Covina, Victorville, Barstow and, eventually, Lancaster, where Ismael played football at nearby Littlerock High School.\nHe was known for his \u201cbig old Kool-Aid smile,\u201d his father said. \u201cEveryone who knew him, they\u2019d tell you the same thing.\u201d\nAfter falling behind on credits at Littlerock High, Zabala graduated from a charter school in the Lancaster area and worked various jobs at warehouses and a Family Dollar store before announcing in 2016 that he\u2019d enlisted in the Army. He told his parents there was nothing they could do to change his mind, his father recalled.\nZabala went to boot camp in Georgia, then was stationed in Mississippi and eventually Texas, where he was training to work as a driver, his father said. But one day, after getting hurt in a training accident, Zabala was evaluated by a doctor and found to be medically unfit to continue serving in the military. He was honorably discharged in March 2020, his father said.\nDisappointed that his career had been cut short unexpectedly, Zabala returned to his family\u2019s home in the Lancaster area.\nThe night he died, his younger brother stirred their father awake, saying Ismael had been shot. Alex Zabala got to his sister-in-law\u2019s house in time to see paramedics trying to revive his son in the back of an ambulance. He was pronounced dead at a hospital an hour later.\nKnowing the man suspected of firing the fatal shot remains at large is like \u201chaving this wound and we can\u2019t let it heal,\u201d the elder Zabala said. \u201cIt\u2019s like putting salt on it every day.\u201d\nEspecially difficult was Christmas, five days after the young man\u2019s death. \u201cThis guy, he\u2019s out there, probably opening gifts with his family,\u201d Zabala\u2019s father said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re trying to find a funeral home.\u201d\nThe Sheriff\u2019s Department is asking anyone with information about Palazuelos\u2019 whereabouts to call detectives at (323) 890-5500."

      "text": "- Share via\nEddie Palmieri, the Grammy-winning Nuyorican pianist, bandleader and composer who helped innovate Afro-Caribbean music in the States and transform the New York salsa scene, died on Wednesday. He was 88.\nAccording to a post on his official Instagram, Palmieri passed away in his Hackensack, N.J., home. The New York Times confirmed via his youngest daughter, Gabriela Palmieri, that his death came after \u201can extended illness.\u201d\nMultiple celebrities chimed in to pay their respects, including Spike Lee, Ramon Rodriguez and representatives from Fania Records, the pioneering New York salsa label, also released a statement.\n\u201c[On Wednesday], Fania Records mourns the loss of the legendary Eddie Palmieri, one of the most innovative and unique artists in music history,\u201d the statement said. Palmieri briefly recorded music with the label but also released music under Tico, Alegre, Concord Picante, RMM and Coco Records.\nOthers took to social media to mourn the loss, including David Sanchez, a Grammy-winning jazz tenor saxophonist from Puerto Rico, who uploaded a slideshow of photographs of the two. Sanchez recounted the time when his soprano saxophone was stolen \u2014 and Palmieri helped him pay for a new one. \u201cYour being and your music will continue to live on in the hearts of many,\u201d Sanchez wrote in the Instagram caption.\nPalmieri\u2019s contemporary Chuchito Valdes, a Grammy-winning Cuban pianist and bandleader, also chimed in with an Instagram post lamenting the loss: \u201cA sad day for music. One of the greatest of all time is gone, an innovator. The man who revolutionized salsa and Latin jazz. My great friend.\u201d\nBorn on Dec. 15, 1936, in East Harlem to Puerto Rican parents from Ponce, Palmieri was the younger brother of Charlie Palmieri, the late piano legend known as the \u201cGiant of the Keyboards.\u201d\nThe family later moved to the South Bronx, where they opened up a luncheonette called \u201cMambo\u201d: a name chosen by young Eddie, who was enthralled by the Cuban dance hall rhythms. He often controlled the jukebox with blissful Latin jazz tunes by Tito Puente, Tito Rodriguez and Machito.\nPalmieri was deeply influenced and inspired by his older brother, who was nine years his senior and introduced him to prominent big-band acts of the 1940s, like Tommy Dorsey, Glenn Miller and Woody Herman, all of whom seemed to dissolve by the end of World War II. Though Palmieri had an itch to lean into the timbales like Tito Puente, he would eventually follow in his brother\u2019s footsteps and take piano lessons from Margaret Bonds, one of the most prominent African American concert pianists at the time.\nAlthough he briefly joined his uncle\u2019s orchestra, Chino y sus Almas Tropicales, as a timbal player, Palmieri rose to fame as a pianist, playing with various bands including the Eddie Forrester Orchestra, Johnny Segui and His Orchestra, and eventually Tito Rodriguez and His Orchestra, which was a main act at the Palladium Ballroom between 1958 to 1960.\n\u201cIn the audience, you could have maybe a Marlon Brando, Kim Novak, all the Hollywood starlets because it was the height of the mambo,\u201d said Palmieri in a 2013 interview with Jo Reed. \u201cOn Saturday, you had the blue-collar, mostly Puerto Rican. And then Sunday was black, Afro-American. It was intermingled or different nationalities that had nothing to do whether you were green, purple, white, we came to dance.\u201d\nBut in 1961, Palmieri went on to start his own band, La Perfecta, an ironic title given its not-so-perfect setup. It formed as an eight-piece Cuban conjunto, which ditched the traditional jazzy saxophone. There were timbales, congas, bongos, bass, piano and vocals \u2014 but with a twist of its own kind: the inclusion of two trombones, played by Barry Rogers and Jose Rodriguez, instead of the costly four-set trumpets. Palmieri also added a whistling flute, played by George Castro, for a charanga edge (in the place of a traditional violin).\n\u201cLa Perfecta changed everything in the history of our genre, in my opinion. Certainly in New York,\u201d said Palmieri. \u201cAnd then influenced the world, because after that all the pawn shops got rid of their trombones.\u201d\nHis group helped usher in the iconic salsa genre with their first album, \u201cEddie Palmieri and His Conjunto \u2018La Perfecta,\u2019\u201d dubbing him the nickname \u201cMadman of salsa.\u201d However, he was not too fond of the emerging term, which seemed to cram different styles like mambo, charanga, rumba, guaracha and danz\u00f3n into one single category.\n\u201cAfro-Cuban is where we get the music,\u201d explained Palmieri in a 2012 interview with the Smithsonian Oral History Project. \u201cThe influence of the Puerto Rican is the one [that] upheld the rhythmical patterns and the genre of Cuba. So then that becomes Afro-Caribbean.\u201d\nLa Perfecta went on to release its most famed album, \u201cAz\u00facar Pa\u2019 Ti\u201d in 1965. It included the song \u201cAz\u00facar,\u201d an eight-minute track that was later added to the National Recording Registry in 2009.\nIn 1976, Palmieri became the first to win a Grammy for the inaugural category of best Latin recording, for his album \u201cSun of Latin Music.\u201d He holds a total of eight Grammy awards. In 2013, the National Endowment for the Arts honored him as a Jazz Master and the Latin Grammys granted him a Lifetime Achievement Award.\nBut Eddie Palmieri\u2019s impact spanned beyond his own accomplishments. He was a mentor, a teacher and an advocate for Latin music and culture, which includes advocating twice for the inclusion of the Latin jazz album category in the Grammys \u2014 first in 1995, then again in 2012 after its removal.\nPalmieri was predeceased by his wife of 58 years, Iraida Palmieri, who passed away in 2014 \u2014 and who he often referred to as \u201cMi Luz Mayor.\u201d He is survived by his four daughters, Renee, Eydie, Ileana and Gabriela; his son, Edward Palmieri II; and four grandchildren."
