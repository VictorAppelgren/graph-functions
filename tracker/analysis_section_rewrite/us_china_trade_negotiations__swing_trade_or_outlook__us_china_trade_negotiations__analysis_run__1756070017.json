      "feedback": "The Analysis Draft violates the SECTION FOCUS in multiple ways: it does not deliver exactly 4 lines (2 Up and 2 Down) and it piles in Alt A/Alt B, macro sections, and a separate “Near-term catalysts” narrative, which breaks the required compact, line-based Swing Trade/Outlook format and obscures the causal chain. It also mixes 0–3 weeks, 0–90 days, 90–180 days, and multi‑tier horizons without a clean 2 Up/2 Down structure, and it interleaves Intel-specific governance signals with broader regime descriptions in a way that weakens the first-principles causal thread. Probabilities are inconsistently anchored, sometimes without explicit source citations, and several numeric claims (e.g., base-case 60–70%, 10% Intel stake, 30% top-line tariffs, 2.6% futures moves) need tight sourcing and consistent citation placement. To elevate to world-class, collapse to a single canonical base-case scaffold with four lines (two Up, two Down) using the mandated fields, and place one tight Swing Trade line for the tradable asset (Intel) if applicable. Use explicit, source-backed probabilities (e.g., 60–70% base-case to Regime 2; 20–30% Alt A to Regime 3; 20–30% Alt B to Regime 1) and attach citations on any line where a fact or number is asserted. Reconcile conflicts by selecting one coherent regime narrative (e.g., base-case Regime 2 with 60–70% odds) and relegating alternatives to clearly labeled sub-branches only if kept, with no cross-pollination into the four lines.\n\nActionable edit instructions:\n- Redraft into exactly 4 lines: 2 Up and 2 Down. Use the form “Up | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %” (one line per row). Do not append extra sections or lines.\n- Choose a single, explicit base-case frame (e.g., Up 0–90 days and Up 90–180 days; Down 0–90 days and Down 0–3 weeks) and tie each line to a clear, source-backed driver (Regime 2 for Up lines; Regime 1 or Regime 3 for Down lines, with the probability anchored to the text: 60–70% base-case for Regime 2; 20–30% for the tail-risk paths).\n- For each Up/Down line, attach a tight probability and a single, verifiable driver with citations (e.g., base-case Up tied to 0UOO8VW2V/SGB2PAZGK/KFTWPFGAF; Down risks tied to D5M2JYKVS; 0–3 weeks Intel-stake governance tied to I35H3FBSN).\n- Add 1 Swing Trade line (since Intel is tradable) in the required format: Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence, and base it on the governance/news flow; cite I35H3FBSN, 0UOO8VW2V, and D5M2JYKVS as applicable for the trigger and baseline odds.\n- Keep all numbers tied to explicit sources; avoid floating assertions without IDs; ensure every factual claim in the four lines has an in-text citation. After the Swing Trade line, keep training wheels minimal: 1 line only, with a clear trigger (e.g., governance-term clarity or milestone) and a probability (e.g., 65–75%) and a Confidence band (0–100). Finally, strip all nonessential material (Alt A/B, long macro sections, and extraneous color commentary) to comply with the exact format and enable decisive, testable thinking.",
