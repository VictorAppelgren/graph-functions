  "title": "I've Used a Foldable Phone for a Year\u2014Here's How It's Holding Up",
  "description": "My phone might just be in better shape than yours.",
  "content": "Foldables have more moving parts than conventional phones, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re fragile. I\u2019ve been using foldable phones for over a year now, and here\u2019s how they\u2019ve held up.\n\nOver the course of the last two years, I discovered book-style foldables and have purchased three.\n\nMy first two were both a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5, each with 512GB. I bought them a few months apart from each other because I don\u2019t just use a foldable as my phone\u2014it\u2019s also my only PC. Breaking this device would not only mean I don\u2019t have a phone, but I have no computer to continue my workday from or a way to email my wife to let her know what\u2019s up. It felt prudent to have a backup.\n\nI\u2019ve since sold one of those phones to replace with a Z Fold 6, back when the latter was the newest option available. Since the Z Fold 7 lacks S Pen support, and given how heavily I use my stylus, I have no plans on doing a similar swap this year.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve experienced how durable these phones are, I\u2019m less nervous. My wife has since asked to swap her Pixel 7 for the Z Fold 5, so both phones are now seeing daily active use. I have one, and she has one.\n\nMy Z Fold 6 Still Looks Good as New\n\nI bought my Z Fold 6 on Swappa in mint condition for $980 before tax, which comes to roughly 50% off. The description was accurate. The only indication that this wasn\u2019t a brand new device was a tiny white spec of missing paint along the top of the frame. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the seller genuinely didn't even notice it. It's so small that it's hard to get a photo of, and you have to get up real close to see.\n\nI bought the phone in November of 2024, so I'm on my 9th month of ownership. In that time, the speck of missing paint along the top of the phone has been joined by a second one.\n\nThere's a similar tiny scuff on the bottom corner as well. That, remarkably, is it. Bear in mind, my phone is not in a case. I typically use phones naked. I've never used a phone for this long and have it still show so little signs of use. This feat is even more remarkable when considering that since this phone has replaced my PC, I'm using it for far more hours a day than I've used any other phone.\n\nBoth Screens Are Still Going Strong\n\nWhen people express concern about foldables, there's only one part that they actually are concerned about. That's the flexible internal screen. So I'll call this part out explicitly. My internal screen still looks good as new. There are no scratches, nor am I even concerned about scratches. Unless you regularly leave your phone lying about unfolded, that screen is rarely exposed. As for the crease down the middle, if it's any deeper than when I first unboxed the phone, I haven't noticed.\n\nWhile the crease is clearly visible in the photo above, it's not nearly as noticeable when the screen is on and you're staring at it directly. I can see it if I'm trying to, but most of the time, I'm not trying to, and I'm not someone who was ever all that bothered by the existence of a crease to begin with.\n\nIt's the cover display that is more likely to suffer abuse. I learned this the hard way with my original Z Fold 5. I decided to test the quality of the latest Gorilla Glass and did not put any kind of protection on it. The screen was thoroughly scratched. I've sold that phone, so I am unable to get a photo.\n\nI now have a very thin TPU screen protector on the cover display of my Z Fold 6, and so far, that's all I've needed to keep the screen scratch-free on my newest phone.\n\nBoth screens on my wife\u2019s Z Fold 5 also remain scratch-free. I even swapped out the internal screen protector on that phone for a matte one, as you can see on my piece about the best way to read digital comics. I was very nervous about peeling the original screen protector off, but so far there have been no ill effects.\n\nFoldable Cases May Do More Harm Than Good\n\nA different part of my wife's phone hasn\u2019t faired as well. Foldable phones have a plastic frame along the outside of the inner display. This plastic prevents the screen from rubbing up against itself when the phone is closed. Part of this plastic has broken on my wife's phone.\n\nWe don't know exactly how this happened, but I suspect this is an instance where the phone's case actually did more harm than good. Creating a protective case for a foldable is a complicated affair. In this case, I believe the plastic case pressed against the frame until it cracked.\n\nAll of My Foldables Have Suffered Drops\n\nThe first time I dropped a Z Fold 5, I was terrified. I was then shocked to see how few scuffs the phone walked away with. My previous Sony, ASUS, and Motorola phones were all clearly scratched up by the time I was done with them. It often took only a single drop to dent their corners. Samsung\u2019s build quality feels a step above, and this applies to its foldables.\n\nI don't drop my phone often, but my wife does. With the exception of that one broken piece, the case has done as good a job protecting her phone from drops as cases did safeguarding her previous phones. There are no other signs of damage from the many drops this phone has taken.\n\nMy phone is supported for seven years of software updates. Do I expect this phone to last for seven years? I don't know, but so far it has given me no reason to doubt that it will. Still, moving parts are moving parts, and they can eventually wear down. While I'm not concerned about my phone breaking anytime soon, I still recommend having phone insurance or a protection plan. Foldable phone repairs cost more, so you're better off safe than sorry.",

      "text": "Quick Links\nThere was a time when I, like many people, did most of my \"computing\" from a laptop. Now, I use my phone as my primary computer and no longer have a traditional PC to fall back on. Perhaps surprisingly, this hasn't hindered my ability to work remotely.\nSome Smartphones Are Great At Multitasking\nPart of what allows us to get so much done from computers is the size of their screens, but that's not all there is to it. I found that what's just as important is the way our devices are able to multitask.\nMy Galaxy Z Fold 5 provides many ways to switch between apps. The default taskbar mirrors what we see on a PC, but that's only one option. I love putting two apps side-by-side or shrinking apps into small windows and tucking them away in a corner.\nSmartphone apps have gotten good enough that when you're able to use more than one at a time quickly, it's surprising how much you can get done. I still wouldn't want to work on a conventionally sized smartphone, but once a device hits seven inches and starts to feel like a small tablet, I've discovered that it's big enough for me, as long as the interface can keep up.\nA Desktop Mode Like Samsung DeX Is Essential\nTo be clear, some tasks simply require a larger screen. If I'm trying to design a website or work with a spreadsheet, I want something larger. But the issue isn't that my phone isn't powerful enough or that it lacks the necessary software. All I need is the option to plug my phone into a larger display.\nSamsung gives me that. For years, Samsung has offered a full-blown Android desktop mode known as DeX. If you can get everything you need done from a Chromebook, then chances are you can also do your work from DeX. I, frankly, have many uses for Samsung DeX.\nMotorola is another option. The company offers Smart Connect on its higher-end phones. I found that it is not as mature as DeX, but it's very close. OnePlus phones and newer Pixel phones now mirror displays when connected to an external monitor. I wouldn't be as comfortable doing away with my PC if screen mirroring were my only option, but it's better than nothing. Google does admittedly have its own Android desktop in the works, but it has been barebones for years.\nThere's an App for Most of What I Need\nI remember the early days of Android when I was waiting for new apps to come out to do what I could do on my laptop. For me, those days have passed. While there are still areas where the Android app may not be quite as good, in almost every case, it's good enough.\nMany Android web browsers offer a desktop-like tab bar when they're on a larger screen, including baked-in options like Google Chrome or Samsung Internet, as well as third-party alternatives like Vivaldi. There are office suites ranging from Google Docs and Microsoft 365 to competitors like OfficeSuite and Polaris Office. There are Adobe apps that may not be all a professional video editor needs, but they're more than competent enough for someone doing the basics like me. If someone sends me a PDF, I can view it, annotate it, and send it back.\nMost of the Rest Can Be Done In a Browser\nThere are occasional edge cases where a mobile app doesn't exist, or the mobile app is missing features that I need. The thing is, so much computing these days is done on the web anyway. For niche tasks like converting one file type to another or stripping the DRM from an eBook, there's usually a website that can make it happen.\nCloud computing and websites have changed what's possible. You don't need a powerful CPU or graphics card to do intensive tasks if you have a fast internet connection that can handle it instead.\nThanks to cloud gaming, I don't even need a PC to access my existing Steam library. My preferred way to play has become plugging AR glasses into my phone and using a Bluetooth gamepad. This is through an app, not a browser, but the point's the same\u2014you don't necessarily need native versions of apps or games in order to run them on your phone.\nFor Some Tasks, Working With a Phone Is Faster\nTo my surprise, using a mobile app is often quicker than doing the same task on a PC. It's easier to share files from a phone interface than a laptop. The latter is more inclined to nudge you toward a file manager, while phones are quicker to help you share directly from an app. I can take a photo on my phone, apply quick touch-ups, and upload it in less time than it would take for me to return to a PC and transfer the files.\nI was surprised how quickly I was able to do taxes this year from a mobile app. Many smartphone apps let you skip passwords and use your fingerprint. Slack on the desktop may have more features, but I find it easier to navigate on the phone, which leads to me being more engaged.\nVideo Chat Apps All Support Phones\nEven though I've worked remotely for my entire adult life, I haven't spent much time on video calls. Yet when the need arises, this is an area phones handle just fine. No matter which service someone wants to chat using, a mobile app is available. Not only that, in my case, a phone has both a better webcam and a better mic than my laptop did.\nIf you regularly host meetings and have to give presentations, then a phone probably won't be ideal. Being able to share your screen and view participants isn't a strength of small screens. Fortunately for me, I'm usually on the other end of Zoom calls, and a phone has served me well.\nMost Accessories Work With Phones\nHow well you can work from a phone depends in large part on what accessories you invest in. I find that a cheap phone stand (seriously, one of my favorite phone accessories), a Bluetooth keyboard, and a Bluetooth mouse can be all the productivity boost I need most days.\nWhen I want a more traditional setup, I have a lapdock that I can either connect to via a USB-C cable (for the best experience) or wirelessly. I also have a USB-C hub for connecting to external monitors or TVs. More often than not, though, I turn to my AR glasses when I want to use Samsung DeX.\nMy Samsung S Pen is a vital part of my workflow. I have a USB-C flash drive for backing up and transferring files. I also have a Bluetooth gamepad for when I want to game. All of these accessories just work, no additional fuss required. Doing without a PC would be much harder without them.\nAs phones get more powerful year after year, for many of us, there will increasingly be less need to have a separate computer. At this point, it's just a matter of waiting for better apps that can replace desktop software for people with more demanding needs than my own. And it would be nice to see more companies provide alternatives to Samsung DeX, which, for the time being, is still the best option for anyone looking to kiss their PC goodbye."

      "text": "Summary\n- Cases make phones ugly, uncomfortable, and dirty.\n- Phones are more durable than ever with strong frames.\n- Phone insurance, screen protectors, and phone sleeves are enough to offer peace of mind.\nMy phone, which is also my PC, is immensely important to both my personal and professional life\u2014and yet I use it without a case. In fact, I haven't used cases with most of my phones, and it's been a more enjoyable way to live.\nCases Make Phones Ugly, Uncomfortable, and Dirty\nI get why people put phones in cases. These phones are expensive, and cases are a cheap way to protect your investment. If all it takes are a few extra dollars to prevent dropping a phone from ruining your day, that seems like a small price to pay.\nBut the price is too high for me. No, it's not about the money. I don't like the way cases make my phone look. I buy phones based in part on their appearance, and I don't see much point in paying more for such beautifully engineered and designed devices only to encase them entirely in what is usually cheap, and cheap-feeling, plastic.\nI get wanting a thousand-dollar phone to be safe, but I would also like for a phone made of metal and glass to look and feel like one. Otherwise, I could have just bought a plastic phone.\nYour Phone Is a Fashion Statement, So Own It\nDoes it have the best camera? Maybe not, but I love how it looks.\nA case not only leads to an inferior tactile experience, but it also traps in dirt and dust. Phones with cases may be in pristine condition when the case comes off, but they often have deep lines of grit caked along the edges of the screen.\nPhones Are More Durable Than Ever\nThe transition from plastic phones to metal and glass initially made phones more fragile. It wasn't that big a deal to drop an old Nokia or the original Razr, but dropping an iPhone 4 or a Nexus 5 resulted in a shattered screen (on the iPhone, perhaps a shattered back as well).\nThese horrors can still happen to a modern phone, but they're much less likely to. Modern devices are built with significantly stronger frames that can survive such drops, often walking away with just a ding on the corner. It can take several drops to gradually weaken the integrity of a screen.\nPhones have become the most resilient tech most of us own, able to withstand dust, being caught in the rain, or dropped in a river for half an hour.\nYou can't tell, but I've dropped my Galaxy Z Fold 6 pictured in the photo below. A few times, actually. I've owned this phone for over half a year, and I could still sell it in \"like new\" condition (side note: yes, I do also carry around a stylus for my phone).\nI'm not saying modern phones are indestructible. Drops to pavement or concrete will be felt much harder than a hardwood floor. Sometimes freak accidents happen and a phone shatters from sliding off a sofa at just the right angle. But with so much engineering going into making these devices survive for several years, I want to enjoy that work.\nPhone Insurance Is Now Commonplace\nNothing about phone insurance sounds appealing. Nothing about insurance in general is fun. Yet the fact remains that phone insurance is now easy to get, and it's often worthwhile. Such protection provides a certain peace of mind knowing that if I do shatter my phone, I'm not suddenly out hundreds of dollars on a repair or replacement.\nWith phone insurance or a protection plan like Samsung Care+, if I do accidentally drop my phone while stepping out of a car, it's not the end of my relationship with that phone. It's still a stressful inconvenience, but it's one I have a plan to handle, and it's just a matter of setting aside the time to go to a repair shop.\nSamsung Care+ Now Offers Free Galaxy Screen Repairs\nYou still need to pay for the subscription, though.\nA Screen Protector Is Often Enough\nI confess\u2014my phone isn't entirely naked. It came with a screen protector on the internal screen, as all foldables currently do, and I've opted to place one on the outer display as well.\nI don't recall ever shattering a phone screen. I have rarely even experienced cracks. Yet I do find my naked phones do pick up scratches whether from bumping against something in my pocket or from being placed on a table. Foldables can be even more prone to scratches, since they are designed for the outer screen to be facedown on a surface as the phone props itself up for easy viewing. This is one of the things that make foldables such good cameras.\nIs a phone with a screen protector still naked? I'd accept an argument for either view, but I can say using a screen protector hasn't stopped people from commenting when I pull out my phone: \"I could never do that. I need a case.\"\nA Phone Sleeve Can Be the Best of Both Worlds\nWhen I do feel my phone needs more protection, I have long used a phone sleeve as a middle ground. I get to have the untarnished experience of using my device, yet my phone is safe and protected when I'm not. Sure, a phone can still accidentally slide out of a sleeve and come away with a dinged corner, but it's safe from the slow and gradual onslaught of microscratches that accumulate over time.\nRight now, I find just a screen protector to be enough. I know people are concerned about foldables, but from my experience has shown both the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and the Z Fold 6 to be rock-solid devices. They've survived falls and walked away in better shape than my prior slab phones before them. A phone sleeve feels like enough, even if I only save that protection for exciting occasions when I'm more likely to be distracted and a little less careful.\nI'm not arguing that you should ditch your case. You know yourself. I'm a particularly careful and attentive person much of the time, so I'm less prone to dropping things in general. I'm also sensitive to aesthetics and textures in a way most people aren't.\nFor me, using a case creates more problems than it solves. A naked phone is not only the most beautiful one, but the one I love to hold.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6\n- SoC\n- Qualcomm Snapdragon Gen 3 for Galaxy\n- Display\n- 7.6-inch AMOLED inside display, 6.3-inch AMOLED cover display, both with 120Hz dynamic refresh rate\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is a foldable smartphone that combines the functionality of a tablet with the convenience of a phone. It features a large, flexible internal screen that automatically picks up where you left off on the cover display."

      "text": "There are relatively few people in the world who are as invested in the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold series as I am. I love this device, and while there are enhancements I\u2019d like to see, the Z Fold 7 has sadly taken away from me more than it offers.\nMy Z Fold 6 isn\u2019t just my phone\u2014it\u2019s my only PC. There is no other 3-in-1 device like it in the US. If you also happen to own one, here are four things you'll sacrifice by getting a Z Fold 7.\n4 The Smaller Size\nFrom its inception, the Galaxy Z Fold\u2019s size has been controversial. The phone's aspect ratio when closed is more narrow than your typical phone. Many people describe it as tall and narrow, but that isn\u2019t actually the case. My Z Fold 6 is shorter than any semi-recent phone I\u2019ve put it next to, be that a Pixel 6, my previous Moto Edge+ 2023, or the CMF Phone 2 Pro I recently reviewed. It was virtually the same height as the other book-style foldable I\u2019ve held, the more conventionally-shaped OnePlus Open. In other words, it\u2019s not a tall phone.\nI also appreciate the narrow outer display. While it did feel a tad cramped on the Z Fold 5 (which was my first Z Fold), I find Samsung\u2019s changes for the Z Fold 6 to be spot on. It may not be the easiest to type on, but I unfold the phone for that. Compared to other phones, the narrow aspect ratio just makes everything else so pleasant to use, because I don\u2019t have to reach as far across, nor as high, as I do when using other phones.\nIn other words, despite having a tablet-sized screen on the inside, this is actually a relatively small phone. To me, it feels less bulky than other phones, even despite being ever-so-slightly thicker. As both a small phone fan and a 7-inch tablet fan, owning a Galaxy Z Fold has been a dream come true.\nThat\u2019s changed with the Galaxy Z Fold 7. Some might call it a bigger and better upgrade, but consider me nervous. I know many want the Galaxy Z Fold 7 to be as large as Samsung's other phones when closed, and I can understand why. But I love having a small phone that unfolds into a big one. A big phone that unfolds into a bigger one is a fundamentally different thing.\nThankfully, Samsung has kept the aspect ratio the same. I've come to accept size creep when it comes to phones, and I was prepared to overlook this, until I heard about the next thing.\nAfter Using the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, I'm Ready to Ditch My iPhone\nOne device stands out among Samsung's latest releases, finally nailing the foldable experience.\n3 The S Pen\nI\u2019m not only writing these words directly on my Galaxy Z Fold 6, but I\u2019m doing so with my S Pen. I don\u2019t pair a Bluetooth keyboard to my phone all that often anymore. I currently don\u2019t even use DeX with a wireless lapdock most of the time. I swipe my stylus over the virtual keyboard, using gesture swipes to bang out up to a couple thousand words per day.\nI use my S Pen daily to such an extent that it has replaced both my keyboard and my mouse as my most essential computer accessories.\nTake My Keyboard and Mouse, But I'm Keeping My Stylus\nI even keep a stash of backup S Pens, just in case.\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 does away with the Wacom technology baked into many generations of Samsung phones until now. To make matters worse\u2014the company hasn\u2019t yet announced an active pen option as an alternative. For the time being, there simply is no S Pen for the Z Fold 7.\nI chose the Z Fold 6 because it was the only foldable with both a desktop mode and a stylus. Now I\u2019m left without any new option on the market that does what my current phone does.\n2 The Under-Display Camera\nI love the inner display on my Z Fold 6. It\u2019s gorgeous, with even bezels and no camera notch. There\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t a cut out for the selfie camera, but since Samsung has used an under-display camera, I don\u2019t see it unless I\u2019m actively looking. It largely fades into the background. This was just as true on the Z Fold 5.\nThis provides such a nice experience when using my phone to scroll through ebooks or read digital comics, since the text and imagery get to fill the entire display. I like the look when viewing anything that benefits from filling the entire screen, be that photos or browsing Google Maps.\nI understand that under-display cameras don\u2019t have the same image quality as regular selfie cams. On a foldable, I don\u2019t see this as a big deal\u2014I have two other cameras I use when I want to take photos.\n4 Ways a Foldable Phone Changes Your Camera Game\nFoldables may not have the best camera hardware, but they're the most fun camera phones.\nI\u2019d almost be just fine doing without a camera on the inner screen entirely. If forced to choose between that and having a pretty obvious camera cutout, I\u2019d rather have the untarnished display.\nThe Z Fold 7 does the opposite. It now has an obvious camera cutout, just like all the other book-style foldables from Google, Oppo, and OnePlus.\nThose of us who are bothered by this have just lost our only option on the market.\n1 The Price\nThe Galaxy Z Fold has never been a cheap phone. In fact, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a non-specialty phone in the US that costs more. And yet the Z Fold 7 costs even more. It\u2019s love to see more people carrying around a book-style foldable, but that\u2019s not going to happen with companies pricing these as status symbols.\nAs much as I love my Z Fold, even I didn\u2019t pay MSRP for mine. I\u2019ve bought every Z Fold I\u2019ve owned second-hand. My first was an open box deal off eBay. My second was a used \u201clike new\u201d model off Swappa. Both cost me either just shy of a grand (Z Fold 5) or just over (Z Fold 6). Both were 512GB models with MSRPs of over $2000. At 50% off, they\u2019re firmly in regular iPhone territory, the most popular phone in the US.\nFoldable phones often launch with trade-in deals and carrier offers, and they simply don\u2019t hold their value. The original Pixel Fold can be found on eBay for under $600. For a phone that cost $1700 new less than two years ago, and one that still has years of updates left, that is quite the fall.\nYet a more expensive Z Fold is still a more expensive Z Fold, even if you buy it used\u2014and the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is yet another more expensive Z Fold.\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 may look like an upgraded Z Fold 6, but that\u2019s not really the case. This is a different phone. It\u2019s bigger. It lacks a stylus. Its inner selfie camera is now as obvious as on any other phone. It neither feels, functions, nor looks the same as previous models, despite the near-identical styling.\nI don\u2019t doubt that the Z Fold 7 will attract people who never quite liked the older models enough to make the switch, but it\u2019s doing so at the expense of many of us who did.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6\n- SoC\n- Qualcomm Snapdragon Gen 3 for Galaxy\n- Display\n- 7.6-inch AMOLED inside display, 6.3-inch AMOLED cover display, both with 120Hz dynamic refresh rate\n- RAM\n- 12GB\n- Storage\n- 256GB, 512GB, 1TB\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is a foldable smartphone that combines the functionality of a tablet with the convenience of a phone.

      "text": "Quick Links\nMany of us equate work with being seated at a desk, hunched over a keyboard and mouse. Yet you could take away both of mine and it wouldn't affect my productivity. My stylus, though, has become my most-needed accessory.\nSaying Goodbye to My Keyboard and Mouse\nWe expect to navigate a computer screen by moving around a mouse and know how to type by pressing keys on a keyboard. This is how I was taught, in school, to use a computer. We even had a keyboard typing class.\nThen smartphones completely changed the paradigm. Now, most of us do the majority of our typing on virtual keyboards. Some who grew up with touchscreens even type faster this way. Yet many of us still have the image in our minds that real work requires a keyboard and mouse, or at least a touchpad.\nBut there is another option besides a keyboard, mouse, or finger. There are devices that rely on a stylus instead. Early PDAs embraced this option. These days, the iPad comes to mind. So do Samsung's Galaxy Tab tablets. I use a Galaxy Z Fold 6, a foldable phone that supports an optional S Pen.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6\n- SoC\n- Qualcomm Snapdragon Gen 3 for Galaxy\n- Display\n- 7.6-inch AMOLED inside display, 6.3-inch AMOLED cover display, both with 120Hz dynamic refresh rate\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is a foldable smartphone that combines the functionality of a tablet with the convenience of a phone. It features a large, flexible internal screen that automatically picks up where you left off on the cover display.\nAn S Pen may not have come with my phone, but I carry one with me everywhere nonetheless. In more ways than writing notes or drawing an occasional doodle, this S Pen has become a core part of how I use my phone. When I purchased my book-style foldable, I did not expect it to radically transform computing for me, but it absolutely has.\nSamsung\u2019s S Pen Stylus Is Most at Home With a Foldable Phone\nThe Galaxy Z Fold may not come with an S Pen, but it's still an S Pen's best friend.\nMy Stylus Offers the Precision of a Mouse\nWith a stylus, I can navigate the web on my phone with the kind of accuracy we usually find from a mouse. It's easier to tap in between letters when selecting text. I can click things that are hard to pinpoint with a fingertip, I can open drop-down menus, and I can hover over links.\nI even use mine for gaming. I find it fun to use a stylus with point-and-click adventure games like Midnight Girl as well as puzzle titles like Monument Valley and Timelie.\nI Can Write as Quickly as on a Keyboard\nI also use my stylus to swipe on a virtual keyboard, the same way you usually do with your thumb. I find I can swipe almost as fast as I can type on a physical keyboard.\nThe added concentration I have when focusing on a smaller screen means the time difference cancels itself out, since I'm less likely to get distracted. But that is only part of the story.\nWorking with a stylus on a smaller device opens up many new postures and places I can be in as I write. I don't have to sit at a desk or a table. I can curl up in a comfy chair and write on my touchscreen as though I'm writing on a notebook in my lap. My phone had freed me from the shackles of a desk.\nIt's also easier to switch back and forth between different modes of writing. Sometimes I do put down my S Pen and type out a few words using the virtual keyboard. Other times, I simply use speech-to-text. But I usually come back to my S Pen when I'm done.\nA Stylus Can Do So Much More\nIt's not just that my stylus can adequately replace my keyboard and mouse. That would partly resign it to being a second-rate tool that happens to be good enough. Rather, there's a lot that I gain from my stylus over my keyboard and mouse.\nSamsung has created many features for the S Pen since it first appeared alongside the Galaxy Note in 2011. I can hold down a button to access a floating menu of S Pen actions, such as taking a screenshot and annotating it on the spot. This is one of the fastest ways I know to share and highlight stuff I come across on the web.\nI can just as quickly open a note and start writing something down. With features like AI Smart Select, I can circle any part of the screen and pin it somewhere while I work. This allows me to see information without having to juggle multiple windows, opening up a new form of multitasking. If that selection contains text, even if it's within an image, I can extract and paste that text.\nMy Trusty Pen Is Always on Me\nI carry my stylus in my phone sleeve alongside my phone, so it's somewhere nearby throughout most of the day. No matter where I am, I can pull out my stylus and take notes. I've made a morning habit out of journaling as soon as I wake up, and this has been a big help in making the new habit stick.\nWhen I go to my parents' house or spend the night at a friend's, I can sit down at a table with only my pen and get to work with everything I need. Sometimes, I go to a nearby park and sit on a giant rock, just because I can. If I need to take notes while I'm out in the garden, it's no issue.\nI travel so much lighter now than I ever did with even the smallest of laptops. Plus, I never need to wait until I'm at my laptop to do something. I don't need to be somewhere where I can place a keyboard in my lab. This more than makes up for the slight reduction in how many words I can spit out per minute.\nThe result has been that I get as much done with my phone and stylus as I could before on a laptop. I'm surprised to find that, in fact, I actually work faster.\nShould everyone ditch their keyboard and mouse for a stylus? Hardly. I don't think this input method resonates with most people. It surely has its frustrations\u2014but it's perfect for me. Not only do I no longer have a PC, I now wonder how long I will even hold on to my wireless lapdock. As for my Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, they now spend most of their time in my desk drawer."

      "text": "Quick Links\nLet's face it: phones are too small for digital comics and magazines. Tablets are great, but they're much less portable. Turns out, there's a perfect form-factor that sits in between.\nThe Problem With Most Phones and Tablets\nWhen it comes to digital comics and magazines, hardware matters. This isn't like ebooks, which can scale up or down to whatever screen you want without changing the size of the text (one of the reasons I love reading ebooks on my phone). Viewing comics on a tiny screen means shrinking the page down until you're holding your phone an inch from your face. Or you keep the zoom at a normal level but spend more time panning left and right than actually turning pages.\nIt's not enough to just get something with a bigger screen. A 10-inch tablet will be large enough to fit the entire page, and it will be comfortable for your eyes, but it probably won't be pleasant to hold for extended periods. Most tablets are designed to be held in landscape orientation so that you can enjoy video. When rotated into portrait, they're awkwardly tall.\nEven when weight distribution isn't a problem, tablets are still large devices. You'll have to keep them in a bag or backpack rather than your pocket. This is comparable to carrying around a physical graphic novel, sure, so I'm not saying it's terrible. I know reading manga on either a tablet or eReader is fine; it's just not something I tend to stick with.\nGet a Foldable Instead\nI didn't buy my Galaxy Z Fold 5 specifically for comics\u2014I bought this phone to replace my PC. I discovered just how well-suited it is for the task after the fact. A book-style foldable phone is similar in size to, well, a book. Or you can compare it to an eReader like a Kindle, Nook, or Kobo Libra. Holding a foldable is akin to holding a manga. The interior screen is slightly smaller than the average graphic novel but still large enough to read dialogue without zooming in or panning around.\nI know book-style foldable can give anyone sticker shock. But here's the thing: foldables aren't as expensive as you might think. They tend not to hold their value long and drop in price quickly on the second-hand market. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 costs $1900 MSRP, but it's already going for around $1100 open box or refurbished on sites like eBay. I bought my 512GB Z Fold 5, unused, for under a grand, less than the cost of a new iPhone 16 Pro or Pixel 9 Pro.\nYou can buy a foldable and install an app that already has your comics, be that Comixology, Google Play Books, or manga apps like Shonen Jump. Then you can stop there. Yet, for the best experience, you'll want to put in a little extra work.\nApply a Matte Screen Protector\nVirtually all smartphones come with glossy glass screens. They're bright, vibrant, and often the best screens in most of our homes. But using one doesn't feel remotely like looking at paper.\nCompanies are experimenting with ways to make screens look more like paper, like TCL's NXTPAPER devices. Unlike E Ink, TCL's approach is a modified matte LCD display.\nGuess what? You can turn your existing glossy screen into a matte one by applying a screen protector. I was skeptical of trying this out, particularly on a foldable whose factory-installed interior screen protector isn't intended to be removed. Yet there were third-party matte protectors available for the Z Fold, and enough reviews were positive, so I gave it a shot. I'm so glad I did.\nI love the look of my matte screen protector, which reflects less light and makes the screen visible in even more conditions. Images look a tad less crisp, which isn't necessarily a bad thing since it gives them a closer feel to that of looking at a print magazine. I wouldn't say the text is as convincing as a proper E-Ink display, but it's closer in that direction.\nDifferent foldables have different warranties, so double-check your phone's terms before peeling off your built-in screen protector. I haven't yet experienced any issues with my third-party protector, but others have.\nMatte screen protectors also provide a more tactile experience. It's not rough, but there's more friction. You can more audibly hear your finger swipe against the screen.\nMatte screen protectors can be polarizing, so don't assume you'll like the experience more just because I do. Install a screen protector on the conventional outer display first and try it out for a while before making a decision on your interior one.\nDownload Moon+ Reader\nAn eReader is only as good as its software. The same is true of smartphones and apps. Unfortunately, there aren't as many options for comics as there are for ebooks.\nMany comic apps leave you little in the way of customization options. You can view the full page on your screen and swipe to turn pages. Maybe you get the option to view one panel at a time, which, to me, generally feels gimmicky in execution.\nFortunately, one of the most feature-packed ebook apps is also one of the most comprehensive comic apps. That's Moon+ Reader.\nMoon+ Reader can open PDF, EPUB, CBZ, and many other formats. The app gives you precise controls over how you want to scale a comic or magazine to your screen. Moon+ Reader lets me fit a comic across the entire width of the screen and remove any margin between one page and the next. The end result is a continuous, seamless scroll that feels like a webpage. I've been surprised by how much more immersive I find this compared to flipping pages. It's not ideal for those panels that stretch across two pages, but I like this approach enough to accept that sacrifice.\nMoon+ Reader also does a good job of letting me swipe horizontally, giving me control over the exact amount of zoom and what color to make the background. This allows me to make the background color match the background of the comic, so it looks like the panels are floating on a solid black or white screen rather than viewing a page with black or white margins on both sides.\nThe point is that Moon+ Reader lets you fully configure exactly how you read your comics and magazines, much like ebooks. Find DRM-Free Sources\nThere's a catch to using Moon+ Reader, and that's the inability to read DRM-restricted PDFs. Many digital comic apps don't let you export their comics in the first place. That means you'll need to seek out sources of DRM-free comics or magazines to make the most of this experience.\nI've gotten much of my collection through Humble Bundle, which regularly releases digital comic bundles. I've managed to get the entire run of series like Saga, Montress, and Wayward. You can often get over dozens of volumes of manga in one swoop.\nSome publishers, like Image Comics, release all of their comics DRM-free. I purchase their comics through Google Play and then export them to a comics folder on my phone.\nCan you get every comic DRM-free? No, sadly. If you're into Marvel and DC, you'll have to stick to the major apps. But I prefer to think of things this way\u2014even if I limit my comic-reading habits to DRM-free sources, I still have access to far more comics than I can read.\nIf you don't already have a library of comics, building one can cost quite a bit of money. Here's where apps like Hoopla and Libby really come in handy. Hoopla's selection of graphic novels, in particular, is quite huge, so you could become a prolific comic reader without spending any money as long as you have a library card.\nFor those of you who are already digital comic fans, I really can't recommend book-style foldable enough."

He uses the Z Fold 6 as his primary PC, praising its large internal display, S Pen support, and Samsung DeX for multitasking, while noting that cases can sometimes harm the device. Despite the high cost, the author argues that modern foldables are built to withstand everyday wear, and recommends screen protectors and insurance for peace of mind. The article also highlights how foldables can replace traditional laptops for many tasks, thanks to accessories like keyboards, mice, and styluses, and discusses the benefits of using matte screen protectors for reading comics and e\u2011books.",
