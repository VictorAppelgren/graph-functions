  "description": "The dispute began when he refused to authorise Barca's medical services to submit his post-surgical report to LaLiga, prompting the club to strip him of the armband and open disciplinary action.",
  "content": "Marc-Andre Ter Stegen has been reinstated as Barcelona's first-team captain after a brief disciplinary saga, the club confirmed on Friday.\n\nThe dispute began when the goalkeeper refused to authorise Barcelona's medical services to submit his post-surgical report to LaLiga, prompting the club to strip him of the armband and open disciplinary proceedings.\n\nBy withholding the medical report, Barca risked not being able to register new signings due to LaLiga's strict financial fair play rules.\n\nIf Ter Stegen's recovery lasted more than four months, 80 per cent of his wages could have been allocated for new players like Joan Garcia.\n\nSoon after, Ter Stegen issued a conciliatory public statement, stressing his commitment to the club and explaining that all signings had been concluded before his operation, debunking claims that his absence paved the way for new transfers.\n\nIt read: 'These past few months have been particularly difficult for me, both physically and personally. Like any player, after suffering an injury, my sole priority has always been to return to the pitch as soon as possible, motivated only by the desire to help the team and do what i love most: compete.\n\n'In recent weeks, many things have been said about me - some of them entirely un-founded. Therefore, I feel it is necessary to express my version of events respectfully, yet clearly.\n\n'The decision to undergo surgery was made after consultation with medical professionals and fully approved by the Club, and always with the intention of prioritising my health and long-term sporting career which of course are fully aligned with those of FCB to have myself available on the pitch as soon as possible to keep winning trophies.\n\n'Moreover, I announced publicly the minimum recovery timing that I shall need after that, which had been communicated to me by most reputed experts and always in coordination with the Club.\n\n'I would also like to clarify - in light of certain speculation - that all of the Club's signings and contract renewals were completed prior to my surgery, and therefore, at no point could I consider that my unfortunate circumstances with the new surgery I had to undergo would be necessary for the registration of other colleagues whom greatly respect and look forward to share locker room with for many seasons. Any alternative interpretation seems both unfair and inaccurate to me.\n\n'Throughout my career, I have always tried to conduct myself with professionalism, respect, and commitment towards the Badges I have represented. I have a deep affection for FC Barcelona, this city, and its supporters, who have stood by me for so many years. My commitment to these colours remains absolute.\n\n'I understand that difficult moments can generate tension, but I trust that, through dialogue and responsibility, we can resolve this situation constructively. I am fully willing to collaborate with the Club's management to resolve this matter and to provide the requested authorisation.\n\n'A lot may have changed, but one thing never will: I love you, Culers!'\n\nFollowing his gesture, Barcelona confirmed that disciplinary proceedings were closed and that Ter Stegen would resume his role as captain with immediate effect.\n\nThe statement read: 'FC Barcelona report that Marc-Andre Ter Stegen has signed the authorisation for the club's Medical Services to process the mandatory medical report in La Liga following his surgery.\n\n'The disciplinary file is closed and the player recovers the captaincy of the first team with immediate effect.'\n\nTer Stegen has been a Barcelona stalwart since his move from Borussia Monchengladbach in 2014.\n\nIn the time he has made 422 appearances, grabbing six LaLiga titles, a Champions League, and multiple domestic cups in the process.",
