  "description": "A long time coming",
  "content": "The feature will roll out to Pixel phones such as the new Pixel 10 Pro Fold\n\u2022 It's been spotted in the latest Android preview version\n\u2022 Previously you needed a third-party app to access the feature\n\nThe flashlight is a useful extra you'll get on all the best smartphones, and it's even more useful when you can adjust its strength \u2013 a feature which finally looks set to arrive on Pixel phones with an upcoming update to Android.\n\nAs spotted by Android Authority, the latest Android Canary release \u2013 the earliest testing version of Android \u2013 includes the option to adjust flashlight brightness from the Quick Settings panel, via a simple on-screen slider.\n\nIt's something you can already do on the best iPhones and the best Samsung phones, so we're glad to see the Pixels are finally catching up \u2013 there are lots of scenarios where being able to adjust flashlight strengths can come in handy.\n\nThe functionality has actually been around since 2022 and Android 13, but it hasn't been fully implemented in Pixel handsets before. Up until now, you needed a third-party flashlight app to change the intensity.\n\nIt's not certain how long this will take to roll out to Pixel handsets, but it shouldn't take long. It could well roll out with the Android 16 QPR2 update (that's Quarterly Platform Release, by the way), which is scheduled to arrive for everyone in September.\n\nOther new features that Pixel users can look forward to in Android 16 QPR2 include support for an improved dark mode and better icon theming, more customization for the Quick Settings panel, and lock-screen widgets for phones.\n\nThe Identity Check feature will also be expanded to more apps, which means they require biometric authentication (like a face or fingerprint scan) for access. There's also an upgraded remote-locking feature called Secure Lock Device.\n\nAll of these features will of course appear on the newly unveiled Google Pixel 10 phones, which come with an earlier version of Android 16 out of the box \u2013 but you may find it's the flashlight brightness adjustment that you find yourself using the most.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 How the Pixel Watch 4 may change wearable tech\n\u2022 13 things we saw at the wild Google Pixel 10 launch\n\u2022 My most-used iPhone feature is coming to Android",

      "text": "Early Verdict\nGoogle is taking aim at Apple with the new Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL, with the new Pixelsnap feature that mimics MagSafe perfectly, and the promise of AI features that Apple has so far failed to deliver. It\u2019s a big bet on software, but Google\u2019s Pixel design was already a step ahead, and the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL improve on last year\u2019s great look. Our full review is coming, but my hands-on first impression will give you a good idea of how the Pixel has evolved.\nPros\n- +\nPixelsnap is incredibly useful (especially for iPhone switchers)\n- +\nPro Res zoom at 100x will be fun to play with\n- +\nLive Translate shows the power of Google\u2019s on-device AI\nCons\n- -\nNot a big step up from last year\n- -\nSpecs may not be competitive against the best from Samsung and Apple\n- -\nColors are kind of boring\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro and its larger sibling, the Pixel 10 Pro XL, look like fantastic smartphones \u2013 Google hasn\u2019t messed with the winning formula that made the Pixel 9 Pro my phone of the year choice for 2024. The refinements seem minor, but could signal a sea change in Google\u2019s fight against Apple and its friendly competition with Android rival Samsung. I only had a few hours with these phones, but they look like the best Pixel phones yet \u2013 and some of the coolest features have yet to reveal themselves.\nGoogle doesn\u2019t compete with Samsung on specs or with Apple on features, so it\u2019s been easy to dismiss past Pixel phones as also-ran devices that offer a nice alternative to the iPhone and Galaxy lines, but are rarely the first choice. That changes with the Pixel 10 Pro.\nThe new Pixelsnap magnet features may seem like old news to iPhone users, but they open up a world of new accessories and convenience for Android fans. I\u2019m pretty sure that Samsung and OnePlus will follow suit in due course, but for now the Pixel 10 Pro and its three stablemates are the only Android phones that I can snap onto my bedside charging stand (sorry iPhone 16 Pro) and use with my UAG magnetic wallet.\nI only had a couple of hours with the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro X, so the most important features remain a mystery right now. Google says it has upgraded the image signal processor in the Tensor G5 chipset, which should result in better photos, and possibly a better camera experience.\nThe new Camera Coach feature is totally fascinating, but it wasn\u2019t working on the demo units I tried. Some Google reps had it working on their own phones, so the feature seems baked and ready to serve, but I\u2019ll need to spend a lot of time using the cameras in a variety of situations to see if it really makes a difference.\nIf it does, it could be a turning point for smartphone AI features. So far, AI on smartphones has been a mix of useful tools and frightening oversteps. The Pixel 9 Pro is my favorite AI phone because it does a great job of screening calls, recording meetings, and managing notifications.\nThose are genuinely useful AI tools, not image generators that make lousy (or possibly offensive) images, or writing tools that take over the job of sending love notes to my sweetie. The Pixel 10 Pro promises a host of new and similarly useful AI features, but none of them were apparent in my hands-on time.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe new Magic Cue feature will need to get to know me better before it starts bubbling up relevant information during my phone calls. When it does know me, it should do things like showing me my flight information if it hears me talking about my upcoming travel plans. I hope it works well, but so far AI features like this from other phone makers have failed to materialize after launch, or have failed to demonstrate the utility that phone makers claim.\nI\u2019m not too concerned. The Pixel 9 Pro was already ahead of the competition on useful AI features, and Google is doing an admirable job of keeping the AI processing \u2013 and therefore your private data \u2013 on the device instead of relying too much on cloud computing.\nI saw a Pixel 10 Pro translate the voice of my colleague on a phone call from his English into a natural-sounding Spanish. Other phones can do the translation bit, but the Spanish voice actually sounded like my colleague would if he spoke Spanish! Most astonishingly, all of the processing happened on the Pixel 10 Pro, not in the cloud. The conversation and the sound of your voice are kept private.\nIn other words, after spending a couple of hours with the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL, they seem to me like refined devices that marginally improve on the success of last year\u2019s redesign, and that\u2019s enough for me. If the Pixel 10 Pro simply offers camera improvements and better zoom, along with all of the latest Pixel features I already enjoy, I\u2019ll be able to recommend it easily.\nIf the new AI features really help me take even better photos and do a better job of helping me organize my digital life, I\u2019ll consider that an even bigger win, but I think we\u2019re only seeing the tip of the AI iceberg on these phones. With seven years of Android updates ahead, who knows what the Pixel 10 Pro will be capable of doing in the future.\nPixel 10 Pro and Pro XL hands-on review: Price & availability\nThe Pixel 10 Pro and the Pixel 10 Pro XL both come with 16GB of RAM inside and 256GB of storage to start. Those are very respectable specs, and most people won\u2019t need to spend more for more storage, unless there\u2019s a great discount if you buy more space.\nThe phone comes in four colors: blue-grey Moonstone, light-green Jade, white Porcelain, and dark-grey Obsidian. The Moonstone is very appealing, but I like all of this year\u2019s colors equally, even the blackish Obsidian. I do wish there were more vibrant color options, but subtle seems to be the new norm for Pro-level phones.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL are priced high, but the price is competitive with the top-end iPhone 16 Pro and Galaxy S25 Ultra phones. The new Pixels don\u2019t measure up evenly spec-for-spec, but the overall experience is just as good, and the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL are the newest-looking phones of the bunch, with the most recent redesign.\nWhile I expect the base-model Pixel 10 will drop in price throughout the next year, Google has been more stingy with its Pro models recently. Last year\u2019s Pixel 9 Pro saw regular discounts of $150 in the US, but rarely dropped further than that, and discounts were less common on this phone than on the base model. The price is pretty good, though, so if you want a Pixel 10 Pro, buy it now \u2013 there probably won\u2019t be a huge deal coming that makes you regret buying early.\nPixel 10 Pro and Pro XL hands-on review: Specifications\nThe Pixel 10 Pro launches with 256GB of storage on the cheapest model, a step up from last year, and the same storage and 16GB of RAM inside both the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL. The specs are nearly identical across the two phones, but the differences are significant enough to consider before you buy.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro XL has a larger display, of course, and that means a larger battery inside as well. It uses a big 5,200mAh cell, compared to the 4,870mAh battery in the Pixel 10 Pro. I\u2019ll need to test these phones thoroughly before I can tell you if the larger battery makes a big difference.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro XL is also the only Pixel 10 phone that can charge wirelessly up to 25W, which is the full potential of today\u2019s Qi2 wireless standard. The Pixel 10 series is the first phone family with Qi2 certification, including the magnets that make Pixelsnap features possible, but the other two phones charge at 15W, not the full 25W speed.\nOtherwise, both of these phones pack the Google Tensor G5 processor inside, which has a new and improved image signal processor that should improve image quality and help you take better pics. Both phones have the same 50MP main camera and two 48MP sensors behind the ultrawide and 5x zoom lenses, as well as the same 42MP selfie camera up front.\nDimensions: | 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.6mm |\nWeight: | 204g |\nDisplay: | 6.3-inch Actua display |\nResolution: | 1080 x 2424 pixels |\nRefresh rate: | 60-120Hz |\nPeak brightness: | 3,000 nits |\nChipset: | Google Tensor G5 |\nRAM: | 12GB |\nStorage: | 128GB / 256GB |\nOS: | Android 16 |\nWide camera: | 48MP; f/1.7; 0.5-inch sensor |\nUltrawide camera: | 13MP; f/2.2; 0.33-inch sensor |\nTelephoto camera: | 10.8MP; f/3.1; 0.31-inch sensor |\nSelfie camera: | 10.5MP; f/2.2 |\nBattery: | 4,970mAh |\nCharging: | 25W wired; 15W wireless Qi2 |\nColors: | Indigo, Frost, Lemongrass, Obsidian |\nPixel 10 Pro and Pro XL hands-on review: Design\nThe Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL look nearly identical to last year\u2019s Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL, and that\u2019s a good thing. The iPhone and Galaxy lines have been stagnant for years, using the same basic design, while Google made a significant improvement to its Pixel design last year.\nThe new Pixel look is more durable than before, and Google reiterates that the Pixel 10 Pro is twice as durable as the Pixel 8 Pro, which used the older camera-bar design. The Pixelsnap magnets inside haven\u2019t added any bulk to the latest phones, either, so the devices are just as thin as last year\u2019s models.\nFor better and worse, the Pixel 10 Pro looks almost identical to the base model Pixel 10 as well. You\u2019d need an expert guide to tell them apart \u2013 the Pixel 10 Pro uses a matte finish on the back and glossy sides, while the Pixel 10 flips that script and uses a glossy back with matte side rails.\nThe easiest difference to spot is the temperature sensor on the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL, which somehow still exists even though it\u2019s one of the more useless hardware additions I\u2019ve seen in recent years.\nFor color choices, I liked the Moonstone quite a bit, but it was admittedly drab. The green Jade might be my favorite color, but the black and white options are also very appealing, with that nice matte finish making them look more professional.\nPixel 10 Pro and Pro XL hands-on review: Display\nGoogle doesn\u2019t brag enough about its Super Actua displays on the Pixel Pro phones, and the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL models were incredibly bright and colorful in the time I spent testing them. Seriously, Google\u2019s Pixel displays are quietly the best screens on any smartphone \u2013 even better than Samsung\u2019s. They look great in every lighting condition.\nIn my morning with the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL, I found the displays to be satisfyingly bright and very sharp. Google has great custom wallpapers and themes that match the phone\u2019s color, and this makes the display pop even more when you twirl the device in your hand to get an overall look.\nOf course, I\u2019ll need to spend more quality time with these phones to see if the display really holds up in bright sunlight. Google claims these phones can reach 3,300 nits of peak brightness, but I\u2019ll have Future Labs confirm these claims before I give Google the credit.\nI\u2019m also curious to see how the Pixelsnap feature makes the Pixel 10 Pro into a bedside clock. I use the Standby feature on my iPhone 16 Pro Max every night, and I intend to use the Pixel 10 Pro XL as my new alarm clock \u2013 I hope it provides a better experience than iOS.\nPixel 10 Pro and Pro XL hands-on review: Software\nSoftware is the biggest question mark with the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL. With the new Google Tensor G5 chipset, Google is claiming the Pixel 10 Pro does even more AI processing on the phone than any competitor phone I\u2019ve used. I\u2019m curious to see how effective these AI tools will be, and if performance benefits when the Pixel 10 Pro doesn\u2019t need to call the cloud for every request.\nWith the new Magic Cue features, Google is finally getting into the game of letting the phone know everything about me in order to make useful suggestions. I\u2019m not sure how it will work, but eventually the Pixel 10 Pro will hear what I am saying and offer information from my personal life to help with context, for example flight reservations if it hears me talking to a friend about an upcoming trip.\nApple had a very hesitant launch with this feature on Siri, and eventually delayed the idea entirely. It still hasn\u2019t materialized. Samsung is trying to use data from all of my smart devices and my smart home together, but the results have been disappointing \u2013 I haven\u2019t seen any personal suggestions from my Galaxy phone even after months of using those features.\nOther phone makers like OnePlus and Nothing tend to rely on the AI reading screenshots and photos, and not your Gmail messages. I\u2019m interested to see if Google has finally cooked up a winning recipe for a useful AI assistant that knows me personally, but doesn\u2019t creep me out with that knowledge.\nPixel 10 Pro and Pro XL hands-on review: Cameras\nThe Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL don\u2019t get a camera upgrade this year \u2013 Google is sticking with the same 50MP main camera and twin 48MP ultra-wide and zoom cameras that were on last year\u2019s Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL. Instead, the improvements are software-based, thanks to AI improvements that Google says are possible with the Tensor G5 chipset.\nUnlike the Pixel 10, the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL models has features like high-resolution portrait shots, and an advanced Video Boost feature that will stabilize your videos even better than before. All of the new Pixel 10 phones get Pro Res zoom powered by AI, but the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL will reach up to 100x telephoto range, farther than the 30x Pro Res zoom on the Pixel 10.\nJust like last year, the Pro and Pro XL models have the exact same camera specs \u2013 no need to buy the bigger phone just because you want more zoom.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro uses a smaller sensor than Apple or Samsung on its main camera, but Google relies on a lot more computational photography techniques to fix up images after you take the shot.\nI tried the Pro Res zoom in my time testing the phone, and I definitely noticed how it could smooth images and reduce the significant noise that occurs at the 100x range. I\u2019ll need to see the final images up close on my big monitor before I decide whether or not this feature makes those long zoom shots worth keeping.\nI\u2019m also very curious about the Camera Coach features, which will help you rearrange your shot to get the best composure and lighting. Will it tell me to move my camera around, or turn on a different lamp? Will it suggest I use the flash, or maybe switch to Night mode?\nI\u2019ll need to test the feature in a variety of situations, but I\u2019m excited about the possibilities \u2013 I prefer AI features that help me improve my picture-taking to features that make the picture for me.\nPixel 10 Pro and Pro XL hands-on review: Performance\nThe Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL use the same Tensor G5 chipset as the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro Fold, but the Pro models get 16GB of RAM instead of the 12GB in the base model. That should help with performance, especially when it comes to tackling AI processing on the device itself, without tapping Google\u2019s cloud computers for help.\nGoogle\u2019s Pixel phones have never been performance powerhouses, and I\u2019m not expecting these phones will dominate benchmark tests from Future Labs. I couldn\u2019t download any games in my hands-on time, but in my experience games will run just fine, although hardcore gamers looking to max-out graphics should find a faster phone.\nStill, Google\u2019s Tensor chips enable AI features that other phones often can\u2019t match. The Pixel phones are the best at transcribing my voice accurately, for instance, and the Pixel 10 Pro also has some astounding new AI features, like the live translation that mimics the sound of your voice as it translates your speech.\nMy hope is that Google\u2019s custom chips pay dividends down the road as Google adds more AI features to Android. The Pixel 10 family will all get major Android updates for the next seven years, which should take them from today\u2019s Android 16 to Android 23.\nThat means today\u2019s AI features are important, but tomorrow\u2019s AI features will be even more advanced, and I\u2019m hoping that Google has a long-term roadmap that keeps the Tensor chipset fresh as it improves Android. I\u2019ve been very impressed by Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Elite chips this year, so Google is going to need to do more to justify using its own designs instead of Qualcomm\u2019s proven winner.\nPixel 10 Pro and Pro XL hands-on review: Battery\nAs I only spent a couple of hours with the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL, battery life remains a question mark, but I\u2019m hoping that it will be easier for most folks to keep these phones topped up and charged throughout the day.\nHaving Pixelsnap accessories that work with MagSafe charging will be very convenient. The batteries in both the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL are bigger than last year\u2019s models, even though the phones now have magnets inside for Pixelsnap. That\u2019s an impressive design achievement.\nSadly, the Pixel 10 Pro doesn\u2019t take full advantage of the new Qi2 wireless charging standard. The Pixel 10 Pro XL can charge at up to 25W on a wireless, Qi2-certified charger, while the Pixel 10 Pro can only charge wirelessly up to 15W, so it won\u2019t charge faster than previous Pixel phones, but it will still have the convenience of magnets.\nThe final say on battery life will come after Future Labs tests these phones with our proprietary battery rundown tests. The recent crop of Android phones with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor inside have shown remarkable gains in battery life, so I\u2019m hoping that Google has learned some tricks to improve the Pixel 10 Pro\u2019s battery as well.\nPhil Berne is a preeminent voice in consumer electronics reviews, starting more than 20 years ago at eTown.com.

      "text": "Some of the exclusive Pixel 9 AI photo-editing features could be heading to older phones\n- Some Pixel 9 exclusive photo-editing tools could be heading to older phones\n- The Auto Frame and Reimagine AI tools may roll out more widely\n- Handsets from the Pixel 6 onwards are tipped to get the upgrade\nThe Google Pixel 9 series launched with a stack of AI photo-editing features that were exclusive to those devices \u2013 but now it looks like Google is preparing to push some of these features out to older Pixel handsets.\nAs spotted by @AssembleDebug and Android Authority, the latest version of the Google Photos app for Android features code that suggests both Auto Frame and Reimagine are going to be made available to the Pixel 6 and newer phones.\nAuto Frame lets you make sure the primary subject of your photo is well placed within that photo \u2013 that might involve cropping the image, or expanding the background using some AI magic. There's also a similar feature on the best Samsung phones.\nAs for Reimagine, this lets you tweak parts of your photo using a text prompt and AI image generation. You might want to add a car to a street scene, for example, or a tree to a nature landscape \u2013 if you can imagine it, Reimagine in Google Photos can do it.\nPixel exclusives\nGoogle hasn't said anything officially yet, so it's not clear when these new features will reach handsets such as the Google Pixel 8 (assuming Google follows through with this) but the rollout shouldn't be far away.\nIt makes sense that Google would want to make as many of its AI photo-editing features available to as many people as possible, assuming that their phones have the necessary processing power to run them.\nWhile keeping features exclusive to newer handsets can drive sales, it's not clear how many users have been upgrading to the Pixel 9 just to use the AI image features \u2013 though we've been largely impressed by what they're capable of.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nIn less than a month we'll do it all again, when the Google Pixel 10 series gets its grand unveiling on Wednesday, August 20. Expect a lot more talk about the power of AI, and perhaps some features that are only available on the new Pixel 10.\nYou might also like\nDave is a freelance tech journalist who has been writing about gadgets, apps and the web for more than two decades.

      "text": "As a smartwatch expert, I'm hoping the Pixel Watch 4's best feature is the start of a bold new era in wearable tech\nIt's even worth yet another proprietary charger \u2013 for the sake of progress.\nThe Google Pixel Watch 4 has been revealed, and you can check out our first impressions along with the next crop of phones \u2013 Google Pixel 10, Google Pixel 10 Pro and Google Pixel 10 Fold \u2013 and the Google Pixel Buds 2a headphones.\nWhile there are plenty of features to get excited about, including on-device Gemini, the gorgeous new 3,000-nit domed display, and the improved battery life, there's one feature I'm really happy about, especially due to its implications for the rest of the wearable technology industry. Of all the companies that were going to crack this feature first, I wouldn't have picked Google, yet here we are.\nIn a move towards longevity and sustainability, Google has introduced replaceable batteries and screens to its Pixel Watch series. The Google Pixel Watch 4's case can be unscrewed, allowing users to remove and replace parts. Google will sell the parts during the Pixel Watch 4's life cycle and up to two years after it's discontinued.\nFantastic (Pixel Watch) 4: First Steps\nGoogle not only now offers smartwatch repair services for the Pixel Watch 4, but it's also enabled home repairs for the battery and display by partnering with iFixit just as it's done for phones. Despite the fact anyone with a Torx screwdriver and a bit of patience can replace the battery or display on the Watch 4, according to this WIRED report, it even manages to retain its waterproofing.\nThis is a first for Google, and really there's not much traction on ideas like this in the smartwatch industry as a whole. I've been reviewing smartwatches for years, and most mainstream watches \u2013 including those from the likes of Apple, Samsung and Garmin \u2013 are designed as sealed units. Once they croak (be it from a sudden crack or drop on concrete, or a gradual wearing down of the battery) they are designed to be thrown away and completely replaced.\nIn an age of consumption, Google's throwing a welcome bone to longevity here. Depending on the price of the replacement parts (which Google hasn't yet revealed) this initiative could save users money, as they're able to repair rather than replace their old tech.\nIn addition, it's also a very welcome prospect from an environmental perspective. E-waste is a growing problem, and one that other companies frequently pay lip service to. Apple does offer in-house watch services and repairs via its AppleCare+ scheme, but draws the line at home repairs. If you haven't shelled out for AppleCare, you'll have to pay a one-time fee and shop your watch in while Apple repairs it. Depending on the age of your watch, this fee and inconvenience could be enough to consider throwing it away and upgrading.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nApple made much about the carbon-neutral production of its latest couple of crops of smartwatches, even casting Octavia Spencer to play Mother Earth in a skit two years ago. But while Apple may be offsetting carbon from its production, it's still producing like crazy, churning out annual product releases and enormous volumes of units. It's hardly anti-consumption.\nWhile all the lithium from Google's replacement batteries isn't exactly virtuous, a repairable device is a step in the right direction. You're not throwing away perfectly good electronics just because one part has failed: much like a PC or an older Android device, the Google Pixel Watch 4 can be taken apart and replaced. Perhaps one day, it could even be modded, installing a battery from the Pixel Watch 5 range if compatible. A great start to the scheme.\nFuture imperfect\nIt's not all sunshine and roses, however: the need to open up the back has resulted in a change for the Pixel Watch 4's charging port. Rather than opt for a magnetic or pin-based proprietary puck, like previous incarnations, this charging dock is positioned on the side of the device, allowing the Pebble design to stand up like a little alarm clock.\nIt's cute, and Google has definitely made the best of it with a rotating display and by positioning the digital crown straight upwards, like the snooze button on a real alarm clock. However, there's no doubt we'll see frustration in some corners about the third proprietary charger in as many years \u2013 and there's definitely a sense this is a waste of plastic.\nFor all its faults, Apple has at least stuck with the same charger for nigh-on a decade, so it can be used interchangeably with different watches. However, if Google is intending to keep its devices repairable, this might be the winning design and taken forward to use with next year's model \u2013 and there's no denying that the 'little alarm clock' idea feels like a winner.\nA better tomorrow\nDespite Google and its parent company Alphabet's energy-hungry lust for AI and its greediness for all our data, I'm pleased one of the major tech firms took a small step away from forcing us to buy more stuff we don't need, and instead taking us back to the days in which our watches, our phones, our computers and other essential technologies were repairable and lasted longer.\nHere's hoping it's a massive success, encouraging more companies to adopt similar or even standardized, interchangeable replacements (hah, what a pipe dream!) creating a more ethical, sustainable wearables industry.\nYou might also like...\nMatt is TechRadar's expert on all things fitness, wellness and wearable tech.\nA former staffer at Men's Health, he holds a Master's Degree in journalism from Cardiff and has written for brands like Runner's World, Women's Health, Men's Fitness, LiveScience and Fit&Well on everything fitness tech, exercise, nutrition and mental wellbeing.\nMatt's a keen runner, ex-kickboxer, not averse to the odd yoga flow, and insists everyone should stretch every morning.

      "text": "Android 16 is finally giving the Pixel Camera app the makeover it needs \u2013 and I\u2019m fully on board with the refresh\n- The Pixel Camera app is in line for a redesign\n- We're still waiting for the revamp to go live\n- More Material 3 Expressive updates are coming\nAndroid 16 is out now for Pixel phones (and coming soon for Galaxy phones), and while the Material 3 Expressive redesign we've been promised is lagging behind, it looks as though it's going to arrive for the Pixel Camera app in the not-too-distant future.\nAs spotted by Android Authority, the latest version of the Camera app for Pixel devices features a settings menu revamp that fits in with the Material 3 Expressive redesign \u2013 a redesign intended to add more feeling and appeal to the visuals of Android.\nThe interface changes haven't actually been enabled yet, but the Android Authority team has been able to get them working: we've got subtle changes to backgrounds and spacing that really show off the potential of Material 3 Expressive.\nWhile the difference in the visuals isn't huge, little touches \u2013 such as the checks and crosses on the toggle switches \u2013 make a real difference to how easy on the eye and intuitive the camera settings page is.\nA taste of what's to come\nIt's frustrating that the Material 3 Expressive redesign is taking a while to roll out, but I'd rather Google took its time and got the new look right, rather than rushing it and leaving us with apps and interface elements that don't look their best.\nWhile the settings page in the camera app might not be the most exciting screen you're ever going to come across, I'm really looking forward to the revamp: the look of Android has grown a little stale in recent years, especially on Pixel phones.\nI'm a fan of simplicity and minimalism when it comes to interface design, but the Pixel version of Android could definitely use a bit more flair and emotion, without changing too much \u2013 and that's exactly what the Material 3 Expressive design is bringing here.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nOf course, this is all happening while Apple beta tests its own Liquid Glass visual revamp for the iPhone and its other devices. That goes way beyond the changes in Android 16, with a host of tweaks inspired by glass and transparency.\nYou might also like\nDave is a freelance tech journalist who has been writing about gadgets, apps and the web for more than two decades.

      "text": "The best phone 2025: we've reviewed and ranked the top phones you should buy in the US\nWe're halfway through 2025 and it's been a great year if you're looking to buy one of the best phones, but there are still plenty of new phones on the horizon. We've just reviewed Samsung's latest foldable phones, including our best Samsung pick - the Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nWe've also updated our Android phones to Android 16 and our Apple phones to the iOS 26 Public Beta, so we can tell you which phones perform best with the latest software.\nFoldable phones continue to get better all around, while AI features on phones have mostly flopped. Phones have gotten more powerful than ever - the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite platform has pushed Android performance past the iPhone for the first time ever. But even better is the efficiency the Snapdragon offers; I'm seeing phones last longer with the best battery life ever.\nIf you need to save money on a smartphone, I've never seen so many great options available for half the price of the most expensive flagship phones. It seems like every big phone maker has a bargain option, and there are powerful phones you can buy cheap that will last you for many years.\nLongevity is the best new feature for smartphones, and every big phone maker is now promising years and years of support with major OS upgrades and security patches for any where from four years (OnePlus) to five or six years (Apple) to seven years (Google and Samsung). With that in mind, I'm only recommending phones that will actually last as long as the phone makers promise; phones you'll be happy to have in your pocket in five years or more.\nWe've reviewed over 1,500 phones at TechRadar over the last 20 years, and I've personally been reviewing phones even longer. I've tested every phone on this list to make sure it lives up to its promise and its worth your money.\n\ud83d\udcf1Phil Berne is a pre-eminent voice in smartphone reviews, a professional reviewer since the Palm Treo 700 and BlackBerry Pearl days. He has reviewed hundreds of smartphones, including all of the best iPhone, Galaxy, and Pixel phones. Phil is TechRadar's Senior Editor for Mobile Reviews and Buying Guides.\nThe Best Phones\nBest iPhone\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max gives you the best of everything Apple offers, and it's everything I want in a smartphone. Sure, the Camera Control was kind of a bust (like Apple Intelligence), but it didn't need a fancy new button to be the most refined, powerful and reliable smartphone you can buy.\nRead more below\nBest Android\nThe OnePlus 13 simply blew me away with its fast performance, incredible battery, and stellar cameras. It also looks snazzy and feels amazing to use. It's not quite as polished as the big iPhone, but it's much cheaper, and it beats Apple's phone in many ways.\nRead more below\nBest iPhone cameras\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max have identical cameras, at last. Both give you 5x optical zoom, Camera Controls, and more fine tuning than ever before on an iPhone.\nRead more below\nBest Android cameras\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is like having a full camera bag in your pocket. It's not the biggest step up from the Galaxy S24 Ultra, but it adds megapixels and improved performance with its Snapdragon 8 Elite inside. This is Samsung best camera phone ever, and one of the best camera phones you can buy overall.\nRead more below\nBest Android\nThe Google Pixel 9 Pro was our phone of the year pick for 2024, with a fantastic design and AI features that work so well, they can be scary. It has great cameras and it's more durable than any previous Pixel.\nRead more below\nBest Foldable phone\nWith the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung returns to form, cramming even more power and technology into a device that is somehow thinner than ever before. With its 200MP camera, incredibly thin design, and humongous foldable display, this device is a cutting edge mobile computer, with a price tag to match its exceptional quality.\nRead more below\nBest iPhone battery\nThe iPhone 16 Plus had the longest battery life of almost any iPhone I've tested, both in the real world and in Future Labs. The iPhone 16 Pro Max may last a bit longer, but for hundreds less, the iPhone 16 Plus is the right choice if longevity is your concern.\nRead more below\nBest bargain phone\nThe Pixel 9a is the latest bargain phone from Google, and it gets the same processing power and much of the same camera capabilities as the mighty Google Pixel 9 Pro. Sadly, it veered a bit too far from the Pixel look, but it also comes in at a much lower price, making it not only a bargain Pixel, but the best bargain phone I've tested overall. Look for deals on this one, but even at full price it's a great phone to buy.\nRead more below\nBest for teens\nThe Apple iPhone 15 is a fantastic phone all around, with software that is intuitive and fun to use and great cameras. It won't get Apple Intelligence features, and maybe that's for the best when it comes to your teenager's smartphone.\nRead more below\nThe best phone in 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBelow, you'll find in-depth details about each of the best phones on our list. I've tested each model extensively, so you can be sure to trust our recommendations.\nThe best iPhone overall\n1. Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want the biggest and best: The iPhone 16 Pro Max is the biggest, fastest, longest-lasting iPhone I've ever tested.\n\u2705 You want Apple Intelligence ... eventually: Sometime in the next month this phone will get AI features, then more after that, then more...\n\u274c You want an affordable big screen: If you want to save hundreds, and have more AI features today, check out the Pixel 9 Pro XL instead.\n\u274c You want a smaller screen, actually: The iPhone 16 Pro has all the same cameras this year, so you aren't missing out by picking the smaller phone.\n\ud83d\udcf1 The iPhone 16 Pro Max is the ultimate iPhone, with all of Apple's newest features inside, including the cool Camera Control and the superfast Apple A18 Pro chipset. Apple Intelligence is on the way, so this phone might get better over time, but it's a powerful, durable, stylish smartphone, if you can afford Apple's best. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nApple's iPhone 15 marks the most significant step up for a base iPhone in several years, earning its place as the best value phone money can buy today.\nDesign: This year's iPhone 16 Pro Max is recognizably an iPhone, of course, but the antenna gap is now a Camera Control that offers many new features. There's also a cool desert titanium, which is probably the best color and not just because it's the one I got.\nDisplay: The iPhone 16 Pro Max has the biggest, brightest display ever on an iPhone, and it's a pleasure to use in any lighting conditions, even shooting photos outside under bright sunlight.\nCamera: This is a big year for Apple cameras thanks to Camera Control, but Apple is also giving the iPhone 16 Pro Max more fine tuned tweaks over the tone and look of your photos, and early reviews say the results are fantastic. The high-speed video recording that enables more fluid slow motion may also be a game-changer for cinematic videos.\nPerformance: I couldn't find any way to slow down the iPhone 16 Pro Max, with its Apple A18 Pro chipset inside. I'll see how it handles Apple Intelligence, but in my tests with everything it can do today, the iPhone 16 Pro Max delivered all of the features with no problems.\nBattery life: Our Future Labs battery test rank the iPhone 16 Pro Max as the longest lasting iPhone you can buy today. It lasted just a bit longer than the iPhone 16 Plus, but both offer incredible battery life.\nValue for money: The iPhone 16 Pro Max isn't a cheap phone, but at least Apple didn't raise the price this year, even though this year's Pro Max inarguably offers more hardware and more value than before.\nRead our full iPhone 16 Pro Max review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | A bigger phone with even more power and intelligence that holds the line on pricing | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | Iconic design with excellent materials and a brand-new hardware feature | 5 / 5 |\nDisplay | Larger display but the resolution is unchanged. Still one of the best in the smartphone game | 4.5 / 5 |\nSoftware | iOS 18 full of useful updates and a handful of really big changes to digest. Apple Intelligence is an exciting addition that has yet to reach its full potential | 4 / 5 |\nCamera | Solid sensor updates but a lot ofbig changes on image processing and control. The Camera Control might be a game changer | 4.5 / 5 |\nPerformance | A18 Pro is more power than most need but you will never be disappointed in performance | 5 / 5 |\nBattery | Excellent battery life and a weclome upgrade on wireless charge speed | 4.5 / 5 |\nThe best Android overall\n2. OnePlus 13\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want the best battery life: On top of everything else it does well, the OnePlus 13 tops our charts in battery life testing. It lasts for days.\n\u2705 You want to switch from iPhone to Android: This is the most polished and fun Android phone, with fewer foibles than most. This is the one for switchers.\n\u274c You want this phone for free: You won't get a deal on this phone from your carrier, but OnePlus offers discounts and bonuses.\n\u274c You want the best camera phone: The OnePlus 13 is one of the best camera phones, but the iPhone 16 Pro and Galaxy S24 Ultra have it beat.\n\ud83d\udcf1 The OnePlus 13 took every concern I had about OnePlus and turned them into strengths, with a phone that is durable, long-lasting, and incredibly attractive. There was nothing I didn't like about this phone, and I'm excited to see how it develops in the years ahead with more advanced AI features. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nOnePlus used to be a flagship-killer phone maker, but now it just makes flagships like the OnePlus 13, one of the best phones you can buy, even if you haven't heard of it. You won't find them at your mobile phone store, but it's worth seeking them out.\nDesign: This is a classy phone with an amazing vegan microfiber finish that is soft to the touch and more welcoming than hard glass. I highly recommend a OnePlus case, too, since it opens the world of MagSafe accessories. Oh, and did I mention this phone is IP69 water resistant? You can clean it in the dishwasher.\nDisplay: One of the best displays ever on a mobile phone, this big screen is great for everything you want to do. It's also incredibly responsive, even if you get it wet.\nCamera: Amazing cameras excel at action shots by freezing motion to a standstill. The colors and details get a lot of help from AI, and I still prefer the iPhone 16 Pro just a bit, but this is an enjoyable camera that produces fantastic pics you'll love to share.\nPerformance: In lab tests and the real world, the OnePlus 13 was the fastest phone I've ever seen, and it beats even the iPhone 16 Pro in many important processor tests, like multi-core performance. What can you do with all that power? The future will tell.\nBattery life: This is the battery life winner, lasting nearly 20 hours in our battery rundown test. The big iPhone above died two hours earlier. The OnePlus 13 also charges faster than any other phone on this list. Even wirelessly, it charges faster than an iPhone.\nValue for money: Don't let the sticker price scare you, OnePlus offers perpetual deals that drop the price on the OnePlus 13, and you'll get a trade-in bonus even if your old phone is broken (or connected to a wire). This is a premium flagship that will cost what you'd pay for the base model.\nRead our full iPhone 16 Pro Max review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Don\u2019t let sticker shock scare you away, OnePlus offers discounts and trade-in bonuses to help. You just can\u2019t get one at the Verizon store (try Best Buy). | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | A more professional look and an incredible feel with the new vegan microfiber. Every color is unique and outstanding, but the blue is the one to get, and definitely get a OnePlus case. | 5 / 5 |\nDisplay | The best display on any smartphone in terms of color, and it also looks great with the curving edges sloping down to the frame. It could be brighter, but it\u2019s a winner. | 5 / 5 |\nSoftware | The best Android interface software, but I wish there was more to take advantage of all that power. Eventually AI may come along, but for now OnePlus isn\u2019t pushing AI tools too hard. This phone is refreshing to use all around. | 4 / 5 |\nCamera | The best cameras for action photos, even at night, and great pics all around. It does more with 3x zoom than some phones managed with 10x zoom. | 4 / 5 |\nPerformance | You won\u2019t find a faster phone, according to our benchmarks. In the real world, it was harder to find the fast lane, but the interface was incredibly snappy and responsive. | 5 / 5 |\nBattery | The longest battery life, thanks to a larger battery and the efficient Snapdragon processor, though OnePlus has managed to fit more battery inside without making the phone thicker. Oh, and it charges stupidly fast. | 5 / 5 |\nThe best iPhone cameras\n3. Apple iPhone 16 Pro\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want Pro performance in a smaller size: Finally, the iPhone 16 Pro doesn't compromise on performance or features vs. Apple's larger iPhone.\n\u2705 You want Apple Intelligence ASAP: There are some new features available, but when Apple Intelligence launches with iOS 18.1, the iPhone 16 Pro will be ready.\n\u274c You want the biggest and best screen: The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a bigger display that packs more pixels, and other small phones might be more sharp.\n\u274c You want more AI now: If AI is your jam, check out what the Android phone makers are doing, especially Google and Samsung, because they tend to offer more features right away.\n\ud83d\udcf1 With the latest camera features and the new Camera Control, the iPhone 16 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro Max give you the best iPhone camera experience ever, and it's only going to get more interesting as Apple Intelligence rolls out with new photo features and much more. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nThe iPhone 16 Pro is the pint-sized powerhouse in Apple's latest iPhone lineup. It features all the same camera capabilities as its Pro Max sibling, but at a smaller size and weight. I wish it had more than 128GB to start, because those cameras produce great images you'll want to keep shooting. Otherwise, there are no big complaints about this year's iPhone.\nDesign: The iPhone 16 Pro looks exactly like last year's iPhone. It's a bit heavier, but you won't notice unless you put the two on a scale. The iPhone looks sleek in the new desert titanium color, and make sure to get a case that works with the Camera Control button on the side.\nDisplay: The iPhone 16 Pro features a 6.1-inch OLED display that can remain always-on and can refresh up to 120Hz. For folks complaining about the refresh rate on the iPhone, just go Pro, it's where the best displays can be found.\nCamera: The iPhone 16 Pro has the same 5X zoom lens as the Pro Max iPhone, but its really the improved quality thanks to the A18 chip that will have folks talking. I especially like the slow motion video that looks extra smooth thanks to higher recording speeds.\nPerformance: The A18 Pro chipset is the most powerful mobile platform I've tested, and there was nothing I could throw at this iPhone to slow it down.\nBattery life: Battery life was very good on the iPhone 16 Pro, it always lasted a day of use. The Pro Max lasts much longer, thanks to its bigger battery inside, but the iPhone 16 Pro won't let you down early. Still, buy the faster charger just in case.\nValue for money: The iPhone 16 Pro is a good value for a powerhouse phone in a compact package. Apple hasn't raised the price this year, though I wish it came with more than 128GB storage standard, so upgrade if you can.\nRead our full iPhone 16 Pro review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | The price holds on this lovely and slightly larger phone but the value would be better with more storage | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | Iconic design with excellent materials and a brand-new hardware feature | 4.5 / 5 |\nDisplay | Slightly larger display but the resolution is unchanged. Still excellent | 4.5 / 5 |\nSoftware | iOS 18 full of useful updates and a handful of really big changes to digest. Apple Intelligence is an exciting addition that has yet to reach its full potential | 4 / 5 |\nCamera | Solid sensor updates, 5x zoom is so welcome, and the Camera Control is an exciting addition | 4.5 / 5 |\nPerformance | A18 Pro is more power than most need but you will never be disappointed in performance | 4.5 / 5 |\nBattery | Excellent battery life and a weclome upgrade on wireless charge speed | 4.5 / 5 |\nThe best Android cameras\n4. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want more than just a smartphone: The Galaxy S25 Ultra can do more than any other smartphone. It can be a laptop replacement, a note pad and pen, and an entire camera bag.\n\u2705 You want to feel the future: The Galaxy AI features keep improving, especially in the camera and Gallery app. There are definitely more AI features to come, so this phone could get better with time.\n\u274c You don't need all of that phone: If you don't need everything and more, you can spend less on the Galaxy S25 Plus. It just won't have the amazing cameras you get with the Galaxy S25 Ultra.\n\u274c You prefer elegance and simplicity: Samsung software isn't getting better, though it is getting prettier. It's still complicated, with many duplicate apps and bloatware you don't want.\n\ud83d\udcf1 The Galaxy S25 Ultra takes smartphone cameras to the extreme. You won't find a more versatile, refined, and clever device, but that power and performance comes at a high price tag. If you don't need all the Ultra features (still with the S Pen?), get the Galaxy S25 Plus instead, but if you want the best cameras, and the best Galaxy overall, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is the phone to beat. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nSamsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra redefines smartphone performance. It stands out as arguably the best overall phone available. It surpasses the iPhone in battery life and performance, features more versatile cameras than any other Android device, and includes unique features rarely seen on modern smartphones, such as the Samsung DeX desktop experience.\nDesign: The Galaxy S25 Ultra's design refinements, though subtle, are noteworthy. This substantial phone now features a more rounded profile, which makes it a bit more appealing, though it now looks just like the cheaper Galaxy S25. The screen has gotten just a tad bigger since last year's model, though the phone is lighter overall.\nDisplay: The Galaxy S25 Ultra's bright OLED screen offers an unparalleled smartphone display experience. While slightly brighter or faster alternatives may exist, its anti-glare coating significantly improves outdoor visibility. Samsung's display delivers vibrant colors and exceptional sharpness for any task.\nCamera: The Galaxy S25 Ultra offers the most versatile camera system on any smartphone, with its 3X and 5X zoom lenses, as well as normal wide and ultra-wide offerings. The zoom cameras use much smaller sensors, so the images are only good for sharing, not prints, but the results are still the most impressive of any phone you'll try.\nPerformance: For users demanding top-tier speed, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is the clear choice. In both benchmark tests and real-world scenarios involving gaming and productivity tasks, it demonstrated the fastest performance of any phone tested, even outperforming the iPhone 16 Pro. This marks a first for Android phones against Apple's custom-designed chipsets.\nBattery: The Galaxy S25 Ultra easily provides two days of typical use, and it readily handles a full day of heavy use. Without an increase in battery capacity, that Snapdragon seems to sip power more slowly, resulting in significantly improved battery performance.\nValue: The Galaxy S25 Ultra's price is high, and the improvements may not seem like a dramatic leap. However, Samsung's commitment to seven years of software updates, including major Android OS updates, significantly enhances the phone's long-term value, and the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor should be able to handle whatever the future throws its way.\nRead our full Galaxy S25 Ultra review\nValue | Samsung held fast on the Galaxy S25 Ultra price. it's not a cheap phone, but design updates, integrated AI and inclusion of the S Pen make it good value. | 4.5/5 |\nDesign | The Galaxy S25 Ultra is now fully part of the Galaxy S-series design family and that generally improves it. We have a bigger screen, thinner and lighter body, and we still have all the things that make an Ultra special, including the titanium, the S-Pen and a big-enough battery. | 4/5 |\nDisplay | The biggest Ultra screen ever. It doesn't break any new ground on technology, but is still an excellent screen for all kinds of content and uses. | 5/5 |\nCameras | There are a lot of lenses here and they're backed by high-pixel counts that will result in extremely detailed photos. Samsung only updated one lens since the last Ultra, but choosing the ultra-wide was the right move, as it improves both ultra-wide and macro images. | 4.5 |\nSoftware and AI | Samsung's and its partners' commitment to deep AI integration is laudable, and it makes for the most frictionless AI experience I've found on any smartphone. It's also backed by a solid and even more useful One UI update. And the AI experience will likely get richer over time | 4.5/5 |\nPerformance | The S25 Ultra's Qualcomm Snapdragon Gen 8 Elite for Galaxy is one impressive chip. It's a near-perfect mix of performance and efficiency. | 5/5 |\nBattery | Best battery life I've seen on a smartphone. Days of use is within reach. | 5/5 |\nThe best Android for AI\n5. Google Pixel 9 Pro\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want to create a lot of stuff using AI: The Google Pixel 9 Pro has tons of AI features to be creative. You can make your own images, tweak photos, write stories and messages, and plenty more.\n\u2705 You want an assistant to take notes for you: Google AI can listen to your calls and take notes later, so you don't have to grab a pen when the doctor or the dog-sitter starts giving you detailed instructions.\n\u274c You're worried about AI: The Google Pixel can listen to your calls and make deep fake images that will fool most people. If you're worried about AI, this phone won't help.\n\u274c You want the absolute best cameras: While the Pixel 9 Pro is impressive, nothing beats the Galaxy S24 Ultra for camera capabilities and quality, not even with Video Boost.\n\u274c You want a bigger Pixel 9 Pro: If you want this same exact phone, I mean exactly the same cameras and everything, only bigger ... get the Pixel 9 Pro XL.\n\ud83d\udcf1 The Google Pixel 9 Pro is a huge departure from the past few years of Pixel design, and I love the changes. It looks sleek and modern, and it features more AI tools than you could imagine. Google's AI can have a conversation, fix your photos, or fake an insurance scam. Maybe don't do that last thing. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nThe Google Pixel 9 Pro is a whole new look for the Pixel family, but it keeps the recent Pixel heritage of new AI features, outstanding cameras, and the brightest and most colorful displays you'll find on any smartphone. It's not just a whole new look for Pixel, there's a lot going on that you need to check out, even if you just want to be wary of what's coming.\nDesign: The Pixel 9 Pro gets rid of the old camera bar for a newer, raised camera pill that is sleek, rounded, and very modern. The Pixel is more durable this year, with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back for the best scratch and crack protection. The Pro and the Pro XL are identical, except for the bigger size, so pick your phone according to your comfort.\nDisplay: Google continues to quietly dominate smartphone displays with the Super Actua screen on the Pixel 9 Pro. It's the brightest screen you'll find, and it looks fantastic. It also uses LTPO technology to refresh between 1-120Hz, so it works as an Always-On display without draining too much power. You won't find much better, especially if you need to take photos in bright sunlight. The Pixel 9 Pro display can handle it.\nCamera: Photos looked fantastic from the Pixel 9 Pro, and video looked even better after it got an AI upgrade using Video Boost. There are still better camera phones for image quality and features, but the Pixel 9 Pro gives you a perfect starting point, and then you can jump into Google Photos for exclusive AI editing tools you'll only find on the Pixel phone.\nPerformance: The Pixel 9 pro lags behind all of the competition in terms of raw performance, and unfortunately that lag rears its head in the real world. I saw slowdowns and stuttering when I tried to do everything at once, even though my Galaxy S24 Ultra can handle everything and more. I hope this phone really lasts sevent years of Android updates, but the future is unclear.\nBattery life: Battery life on the Pixel 9 Pro was solid, but it isn't the best around. I had no trouble getting a full day of use from my phone, but I wish it had faster charging in case I needed to top up. The Pixel 9 Pro XL charges faster than other Pixels, if you want that benefit, but otherwise I have no battery complaints, only wishes for next year.\nValue for money: The Pixel 9 Pro seems a bit expensive, especially considering performance can lag behind the competition. Still, with a free year of Google One AI Premium, which includes 2TB of cloud storage, the deal looks a bit sweeter. Keep an eye out later in the year for price drops, there are usually discounts on Google phones near the holiday season.\nRead our full Google Pixel 9 Pro review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | It\u2019s a great phone all around, but performance lags significantly versus other phones in this price range, so maybe wait for a discount or a bundle deal. | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | Excellent new design; the biggest change to Pixel phones in four years. Fantastic materials and a more modern look. | 5 / 5 |\nDisplay | Google offers the best smartphone screens around on the Pixel 9 Pro, and it\u2019s surprising the company doesn\u2019t crow louder. Super-bright \u2013 be careful to not overheat. | 5 / 5 |\nSoftware | With a grain of salt and a sense of humor, the AI stuff is A-Okay. Google avoids bad AI stereotypes, and gives us a nice glimpse of the future for mobile AI. | 4 / 5 |\nCamera | Fantastic cameras rival the best camera phones you can buy. Great new features, including Add Me for AI group photos. Camera settings are too difficult to manage. | 5 / 5 |\nPerformance | Performance lags significantly, both in benchmark testing and the real world. This phone lags if you push too hard, and Google wants you to push too hard. Seven years ahead? We\u2019ll see. | 3 / 5 |\nBattery | Solid battery life beats the iPhone, and the phone has no trouble lasting all day. You\u2019ll want to use the cameras, so pack an extra charger, but if you\u2019re careful this phone lasts no problem. I wish the charging was as fast as Google makes it seem. | 4 / 5 |\nThe best foldable phone\n6. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want the fastest foldable: The Galaxy Z Fold 7 uses the Snapdragon 8 Elite platform, which is the fastest and most efficient chipset we've tested.\n\u2705 You want a foldable with real cameras: The Z Fold 7 packs the same 200MP sensor as the Galaxy S25 Ultra, one of our favorite camera phones. This is the best camera on any foldable phone, by far.\n\u274c You have to pay rent this month: The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the most expensive phone you can buy in most markets, and it costs more than a laptop... or a month's rent.\n\u274c You love to draw and doodle: The Galaxy Z Fold 7 sadly loses its S Pen capabilities, making the Ultra the only phone for folks who love to draw and sign documents on the go.\n\ud83d\udcf1 If you can swing the high price tag, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is more than just the best superphone you can buy, it truly is like carrying two devices hidden in one compact package. With the improved camera sensor and the new lighter, thinner design, Samsung has toppled most barriers to buying a big foldable, except for the cost. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nSamsung slims down the Galaxy Z Fold 7 to nearly impossible thinness, making it one of the thinnest phones we've ever seen. It's still a remarkable powerhouse, with an even better camera than before, but it costs more than ever as well.\nDesign: The Galaxy Z Fold 7 finally gets the design right, with a cover display that looks and feels like any other flagship smartphone, not the narrow look of Fold's past. It's so incredibly thin and lightweight that it feels like a normal phone when it's closed - you almost forget it opens to an 8-inch tablet with as much room as an iPad mini.\nDisplay: The displays on the Z Fold 7 are both top-notch. They are bright and colorful, and perfectly sharp for any task. If you're worried about the crease on the inner display, don't be. It's unnoticeable when you are using the huge screen for browsing, games, or just as a viewfinder for the amazing new cameras.\nCamera: Just like the Galaxy S25 Ultra, the Z Fold 7 has the Samsung ISOCELL HP2 200MP camera sensor inside, and it takes the best photos of any foldable phone we've seen. That big display is also great for Samsung's advanced AI photo editing tools.\nPerformance: The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor isn't just the fastest chipset you'll find in any smartphone today, it's also incredibly efficient, and the Z Fold 7 has better battery life than you'd expect, along with top notch performance for the most advanced games and multitasking.\nBattery life: The Z Fold 7 has a smaller battery than most phone's this size, but the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor helps it sip juice slowly, and it had no trouble lasting a full day in our hands-on review time. Too bad it can't charge faster.\nValue for money: To justify the incredibly high price, Samung needed to create a phone like no other, with capabilities that no other foldable or flagship smartphone can match. It has mostly succeeded, but the price is still a big, tough pill to swallow.\nRead our full Galaxy Z Fold 7 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\n| Row 0 - Cell 0 | Row 0 - Cell 1 | Row 0 - Cell 2 |\nValue | The most expensive foldable out there, but it might also be worth it | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | Excellent, slim and light design that still feels elegant and solid. | 5 / 5 |\nDisplay | Two fantastic and now larger screens. The crease is almost gone, but so is support for an S Pen. | 4.5 / 5 |\nPerformance | Better than the best Qualcomm chip on other Androids, and the performance knocked our socks off. | 5 / 5 |\nSoftware | Android 16! One UI 8! So much AI. It may sound like a lot, but it's a winning combination. | 4.5 / 5 |\nCameras | The 200MP sensor is a major upgrade, and overall photography is excellent. We would have liked a 5x optical zoom. | 4.5 / 5 |\nBattery | Really good battery life | 4.5 / 5 |\nThe best iPhone for battery life\n7. Apple iPhone 16 Plus\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want an a bigger affordable iPhone: The iPhone 16 Plus gives you just enough more to make it worth the extra cost.\n\u2705 You want the best battery (almost): The iPhone 16 Plus has the second best battery life, coming behind the iPhone 16 Pro Max by mere minutes in our tests.\n\u274c You don't want Apple Intelligence: If you don't want the latest Apple AI stuff coming soon, you'll need an iPhone 15 .\n\u274c You want bigger zoom: The ultrawide doesn't compare to 5x optical zoom on the iPhone 16 Pro, but the cameras are still great.\n\ud83d\udcf1 The iPhone 16 Plus is only a bit more expensive than the iPhone 16, but you get a much bigger screen and a bigger\nbattery inside. That extra battery makes this the affordable battery life champ among iPhones, so if you need the most possible battery life from your Apple device, the iPhone 16 Plus is the best choice. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nApple's iPhone 16 Plus is only slightly more expensive than the iPhone 16, but you get a much larger display and the bigger battery that extra size allows. This makes the iPhone 16 Plus not only a great bargain option versus the iPhone 15 Pro Max, but also the best choice for battery life if you need your iPhone to last the longest.\nDesign: The iPhone 16 Plus looks like the iPhone 16 and not the Pro models, so you won't get the titanium frame, but you do have better color options with brighter hues. The USB-C port is also there, as well as the Dynamic Island camera, which used to be for Pro iPhone users only.\nDisplay: The iPhone 16 Plus has a 6.7-inch display, and that 0.6-inch difference versus the iPhone 16 is actually pretty big. Apple didn't just blow up the same resolution, either, you get more pixels to keep the same sharpness as the smaller iPhone.\nCamera: There are only two cameras on the iPhone 16 Plus, a 48MP main camera and a 12MP ultra wide. You might wish for a zoom lens, but these cameras still take stellar pics. It's an iPhone, after all.\nPerformance: The iPhone 16 Plus has a brand new Apple A18 chipset inside, which means it's ready for Apple Intelligence AI features that will be invading more powerful iPhone and iPad models in the next month or so. Even before the AI gets here, this phone is a powerful device that could easily handle anything I threw at it.\nBattery life: In our battery tests in Future Labs, the iPhone 16 Plus was the second best iPhone I ever tested in terms of battery life, only minutes behind the much more expensive iPhone 16 Pro Max. It lasted well over 16 hours of runtime, versus a scant 12 hours of battery life on the smaller iPhone 16.\nValue for money: If you were already considering the iPhone 16, you should probably just spend a little more and have more battery life and a much bigger display. The next upgrade, to the Pro-level chips, is the one that hurts the wallet more.\nRead our full iPhone 16 Plus review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\nDesign | The iPhone 16 Plus offers a 6.7-inch screen in a lightweight design that comes in fun colors. | 4.5 / 5 |\nDisplay | While it's not 120Hz, the 6.7-inch is expansive, rich with details, and gets quite bright. | 4 / 5 |\nPerformance | The A18 makes the iPhone 16 Plus fly and provides ample headroom for years of use. | 4.5 / 5 |\nCamera | Camera Control steals the show, but both the main and ultra wide benefit from improved low-light performance. | 4.5 / 5 |\nSoftware | iOS 18 runs really well here and provides a lot of functional enhancements. | 4 / 5 |\nBattery | While it's no longer the best battery life of any iPhone, the 16 Plus still easily lasts all day long. | 4 / 5 |\nValue | At $899, you're getting plenty of performance in a polished build that should last for years... and get software updates. | 4 / 5 |\nThe best bargain phone\n8. Google Pixel 9a\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\n\u2705 You want a great camera for macro photos While there's no zoom, Google\u2019s Pixel 9a surprisingly shoots some of the best close-up photos I\u2019ve seen on any smartphone, let alone a bargain.\n\u2705 You want a durable phone that will last a while The Pixel 9a is built tougher than previous Pixel A-series, and it will get seven years of major Android OS and security updates.\n\u2705 You want a great AI phone There\u2019s plenty of AI on this phone, and the best features can screen calls and record conversations, helping you keep your hands free and your mind on task.\n\u274c You want a nice looking phone Ugh, there's just no style to this phone. You can hardly tell it comes from the same lineage as the Pixel 9.\n\u274c You don\u2019t want a bigoted AI tool on your phone Google's Pixel Studio produces stereotypes that reinforce bigotry. I hope Google removes the ability to draw people.\n\ud83d\udcf1The Google Pixel 9a is the latest A-series phone from Google, and that means it gives you the same performance as the Pixel 9 with the great cameras and dazzling display you expect from Google. Sadly, the series takes an ugly turn, literally, and the Pixel 9a isn't very handsome, but it comes with most, if not all, of the latest Google AI features. It\u2019s a solid bargain phone, if you don\u2019t mind the looks. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nThe Pixel 9a delivers typical Pixel strengths like great photos and useful AI, backed by a seven-year update promise, but wraps it all in a surprisingly bland design that deviates significantly from the main Pixel 9 series.\nDesign: A major departure from the stylish Pixel 9, the Pixel 9a features a flat, plain design with a simple camera bump, reminiscent of generic budget phones, though the Peony and Iris colors are nice. Despite its looks, Google claims it's the most durable A-series yet with IP67 water resistance.\nDisplay: The 6.3-inch OLED 'Actua' display is excellent for the price \u2013 very bright and colorful, matching the Pixel 9. Turning off the sometimes-dim Adaptive Display mode improves the experience. It uses older Gorilla Glass 3, however.\nCamera: Photos surprisingly hold up well even against the Pixel 9 Pro in terms of color and balance, though resolution is capped at 12MP and fine detail is lacking due to smaller sensors than even the Pixel 8a. The standout feature is its astonishingly good macro photography capability, rivaling dedicated cameras like my own full frame Nikon.\nPerformance: The Tensor G4 chip provides adequate performance for daily tasks and runs most AI features, but it's not as fast as competitors and it felt a bit sluggish in my testing, especially with only 8GB of RAM. Worryingly, it already lacks some AI features found on the Pixel 9, casting doubt on the seven-year update promise's scope.\nBattery life: Despite having a larger battery (5,100 mAh) than the Pixel 9, the Pixel 9a doesn't offer significantly better battery life, lasting a full day but not exceptionally long. Charging is slow at 23W wired, but wireless charging is included, a plus at this price.\nValue for money: At $499 / \u00a3499 / AU$849, the Pixel 9a offers solid value, especially considering the seven-year update commitment and strong camera performance (particularly macro). However, like previous A-series phones, expect potential discounts down the line, making it potentially an even better bargain if you wait.\nRead our full Google Pixel 9a review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | A great phone at this price, with incredible longevity thanks to seven years of updates. The cameras are among the best in this price range, even if the look isn\u2019t so premium. | 5 / 5 |\nDesign | It\u2019s durable, and the colors are real nice. Otherwise, it\u2019s ugly as sin. Seriously, Google had a winning A-series formula that it ruined when it created this phone. But the design doesn\u2019t get in the way, at least. | 3 / 5 |\nDisplay | Excellent display that's bright and colorful, better than most phones at this price. Some trouble with Adaptive mode was easily fixed. If only the phone\u2019s performance could keep up with the fast screen. | 4 / 5 |\nSoftware | A polished version of Android that's easier to use, with plenty of features. Some useful AI tools, but also some AI imagery slop that resorts to bigotry and should be removed from this phone. | 2 / 5 |\nCamera | Solid cameras take photos that look like they could have come from the Pro model, if you don\u2019t look too close. Astonishing macro capabilities rival my DSLR camera and make this phone a winner. Too bad about the low resolution and lack of detail, and some zoom would have been nice. | 3 / 5 |\nPerformance | Performance is adequate for Pixel fans, though it won\u2019t win any races. No problems with my favorite apps and games, but things slowed down when I engaged the AI as it sent requests to and from the cloud. | 3 / 5 |\nBattery | A larger battery somehow doesn\u2019t equal more battery life, but the Pixel 9a still lasts a full day with no trouble, and has wireless charging, a rarity at this price. | 3 / 5 |\nThe best phone for Teens\n9. Apple iPhone 15\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want an affordable iPhone: The iPhone 15 strikes a nice balance between price and cutting-edge features, so you don't feel like you're missing out.\n\u2705 You want a camera upgrade: Between the new 48MP main camera and some excellent portrait photography capabilities, the iPhone 15 offers strong camera specs for the price.\n\u274c You want Apple Intelligence: If you want the upcoming Apple AI features, you'll need a Pro model or better.\n\u274c You want bigger zoom: The 2x optical zoom on offer here doesn't quite compare to 3x optical zoom on the iPhone 15 Pro or Samsung Galaxy S24.\n\ud83d\udcf1 The iPhone 15 has all of Apple's best software features, and that's what makes iPhone owners happy. You get great hardware that will last years, without paying too much for extra cameras and titanium you don't need. Plus, this one comes in better colors than the Pro iPhone. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nApple's iPhone 15 marks the most significant step up for a base iPhone in several years, earning its place as the best value phone money can buy today.\nDesign: The iPhone 15 does what the iPhone 14 did not: it moves the base model forward with a refreshed chassis design, a brand-new (and eye-catching) rear glass panel, and a compatibility-improving USB-C port.\nDisplay: The iPhone 15's 6.1-inch Super XDR OLED display is bright and responsive, however, as on the iPhone 14, its refresh rate is locked to 60Hz. You do get Apple's Dynamic Island this time around, though.\nCamera: There are still just two lenses on the back of the iPhone 15, but one of them is vastly improved over the iPhone 14. The 12MP ultrawide is basically the same, but the main camera is now the same 48MP lens that you'll find on the excellent iPhone 14 Pro (and indeed the iPhone 15 Pro).\nPerformance: The iPhone 15 uses the iPhone 14 Pro's superfast A16 Bionic chipset, which should provide more than enough power for most iPhone owners (for context, the latter was the most powerful handset of 2022).\nBattery life: The iPhone 15 is rated for 20 hours of video playback, 80 hours of audio-only, and a 50% recharge in 30 minutes with the optional 20W charger. In my testing, I was able to use the phone casually for a full day.\nValue for money: In recent years, Apple's standard models have felt like minor upgrades that pale in comparison to their respective Pro-level counterparts, but the iPhone 15 bucks that trend by being a genuinely great value product.\nRead our full iPhone 15 review\nFAQs\nWhat is the best phone in 2025?\nThe best phone is the iPhone 16 Pro Max, which has superlative performance, fantastic cameras and a new Camera Control, and more AI features on the way. The best Android phone is the OnePlus 13, which is the fastest phone you can buy, and also the phone with the best battery life. The iPhone tops the OnePlus in cameras and features, with more features that work between iPhone and other Apple devices.\nWhat's the best camera phone?\nWhich phone has the best cameras?\nThe best camera phone will decide on the photos you like to take, but the iPhone 16 Pro Max is the best camera among iPhone devices, and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is the best camera for Android fans. However, if you want a more artistic look, you might prefer a OnePlus 13 with its Hasselblad camera partnership tuning the look of its photos. Bargain hunters will be happy with the cameras on the Google Pixel 9a.\nWhat phones are waterproof?\nWhat phones can I get wet, and what is the level of water resistance on most phones?\nYou might be surprised to learn that every phone on this list can take a dunk underwater with no trouble. If you get them dirty, you can rinse them gently in the sink (as long as there are no cracks or other damage). All of our best phone picks are rated against water up to IPx7, which means that they can survive a dunk in one meter of fresh water for up to 30 minutes. Some phones, like the OnePlus 13, are even more durable, with an IP69 rating to survive jets and spraying water, and a deeper, longer dunk.\nWhich phone carrier is best?\nWhich wireless mobile network should I choose?\nThat's a tough call, so the best advice I can offer is to ask around and find people in your area who are happy with their cell service - then choose the network they use. Networks vary greatly over the miles and miles of US geography, so while I might be able to say that one offers better performance nationwide, that same carrier might not be the best in your area. I've used all of the major US networks - Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile - and I have seen great performance from all of them, as well as signal loss and dropouts from each.\nIs phone insurance protection worth it?\nShould I buy the extended warranty and phone insurance that my phone maker offers?\nIn general, I buy phone insurance with my own personal phones to protect against damage. I have butter fingers, and I have dropped phones so hard that they break even in a sturdy case. With insurance, my last iPhone drop cost more than $100 deductible to repair, but without insurance it might have been a total loss. I have had great experience with Apple's insurance plan, but I have found that companies using third-party insurance may be harder to deal with. If you don't have insurance, you should at least have a back-up plan or cheap phone if your phone breaks so that you can stay connected.\nWhich phone has the biggest screen?\nWhich phones give me the biggest display?\nIf you want the absolute biggest screen on your phone, you will need to buy a foldable. A flip phone like the Motorola Razr Ultra (2025) can pack a whopping 7-inch display inside, which is larger even than the 6.9-inches you get with an iPhone 16 Pro Max or Galaxy S25 Ultra. But if you want to go even larger, you need a tablet-style foldable like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, which gives you a 7.6-inch display inside. That's almost as big as an iPad mini, tucked away in your pocket.\nHow do I choose the best phone?\nThe first thing you need to decide when buying a new smartphone is how much you want to spend. The smartphone market varies dramatically, from very high-end handsets that cost well over four-figures, to much cheaper phones that can be found for only a few hundred. I have options on this list at both ends of the price spectrum.\nOnce you've decided how much you want to spend, you should decide whether you want to try one of the best Android phones or go for one of the best iPhones. Often, the platform decision has more to do with your work, your friends and family and what they use to share photos and messages, and what sort of computer or devices you already own.\nIf you're looking for something outside the norm, I have plenty of unique options, as well. There are phones with a built-in pen for writing, and phones that fold in half to be more compact. There are large phones, small phones, and Max-sized phones. I have phones with space-level zoom, and phones that specialize in touching portraits.\nNo matter what phone you choose, you can be sure that I've thoroughly tested and vetted every phone on this list, and I know you'll be satisfied with any of these devices in your pocket.\nHow we test\nI've only included phones on this list that have been thoroughly tested in Future Labs and in the real world by our expert review editors. I test every feature on a phone, then we dive deeper to discover all of the hidden goodies.\nI test phones rigorously for battery life and charging times, processor speed and performance, and especially for camera and video recording capabilities. I make sure that phones deliver on the promises and claims they make. If Samsung says a phone charges in 30 minutes, I time it to make sure.\nI've seen every phone you can buy, so I know how each model stacks up against one another. I use both iPhone and Android phones all the time, so I know what I'm saying about the phones you buy, no matter what you pay. I make sure the phones deliver what I'd expect for the price.\nOnce I'm done, I never stop. I update our reviews as the phones are updated. Our reviews are always fresh, so check again before you buy to make sure you're getting the latest review on the best phones you'll find.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nPhil Berne is a preeminent voice in consumer electronics reviews, starting more than 20 years ago at eTown.com.

      "text": "Google is preparing a big customization upgrade for your Pixel phone with Android 16 \u2013 and it could land very soon\n- Pixel phones could soon support themes, according to new code\n- It lets customizations be applied more quickly\n- The feature may arrive with Android 16\nAfter showcasing the big update at Google I/O 2025 earlier this month, Google is all set to launch Android 16 in the coming days, at least as far as Pixel phones are concerned \u2013 and it looks as though Pixel devices are also in line for a major customization upgrade.\nThe team over at Android Authority has spotted evidence of a Pixel themes feature hidden in the code for the latest Android 16 beta. While the feature hasn't gone live yet, it looks as though it's close to completion.\nMany other Android handsets, including the best Samsung Galaxy phones, already offer themes: they let you group together wallpapers, color schemes, and icon packs together in a single bundle, and you can then apply them with a single tap.\nIt looks as though themes would be available via the current wallpaper and lock screen settings on Pixel phones, available through the Wallpaper and style section in Settings. It would also be quite a prominent option, based on the existing code.\nComing soon?\nIt's not clear whether you'll be able to view a gallery of themes provided by Google and perhaps other users, as well as creating your own customization combinations. On Samsung phones, there's a large gallery of theme options to pick from.\nAnother question we have is whether this feature is going to be ready in time for the official, stable Android 16 release: the rumor is that we might see that coming on Tuesday, June 3, though that's yet to be confirmed.\nIt's possible that Google will wait for a later Android 16 release before pushing out themes and making them available to Pixel owners. Other Android phone makers will then be able to use (or not use) Google's theme code as they see fit.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nUpcoming changes we do know about in Android 16 include better battery health monitoring (for newer Pixels), improved security features, and a revamped, more modern look for the interface that's being called Material 3 Expressive.\nYou might also like\nDave is a freelance tech journalist who has been writing about gadgets, apps and the web for more than two decades.

      "text": "Early Verdict\nThe Pixel 10 brings some features to Android that I\u2019ve been hoping to see for years \u2013 especially the new Pixelsnap magnetic charging. With better accessories on the way and a new long zoom lens, the Pixel 10 is the most impressive upgrade among all the new Pixel phones, and it finally puts the Pixel line in a position to beat its Android and iPhone rivals, if it can deliver on its photography promise and AI features.\nPros\n- +\n5x telephoto zoom lens\n- +\nPixelsnap magnetic charging with Qi2 certification\n- +\nSame cool design as last year, with better colors\nCons\n- -\nPerformance is still a big question mark\n- -\nMany AI features weren\u2019t working in my hands-on time\n- -\nThe price is a bit high (but it might drop soon enough)\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe Google Pixel 10 takes a winning formula from last year and adds just enough to make it even more compelling, and make this phone a true competitor to the iPhone 16. In the past, Google's phones have been polished and enjoyable, but never cutting edge. With the Pixel 10 family, Google pushes its way to the front, with features you won't find on either the iPhone or the latest Samsung Galaxy phones. That's new territory for Google, and I'm excited to spend more time with this phone after my morning-lon hands-on session.\nWhat can the Pixel 10 do? It can stick to magnets, for one thing. The new Pixelsnap feature \u2013 and extension of the Qi2 wireless charging standard \u2013 might seem familiar to iPhone owners who\u2019ve enjoyed MagSafe since the iPhone 12 launched in 2020. The Android world is finally catching up.\nMagnets may not seem like a major feature, but Pixelsnap will open a new world of accessories and convenience for Android fans. I keep my iPhone 16 Pro Max charging on a magnet stand, and it's the best bedside clock I've owned. Then I slap a magnetic wallet on the back as I leave my house. I'm always using the iPhone magnets, and I'm relieved that Google and Android are hopping on board.\nBesides Pixelsnap, the Pixel 10 features a real, optical 5x zoom camera. The iPhone 16 doesn't give you any optical zoom, and the Galaxy S25 offers only a 3x zoom lens with a smaller image sensor.\nThat could give the Pixel a huge advantage in photography, especially if the Tensor G5 chipset, with its new image processor, delivers the goods.\nSome of the biggest new Pixel features will rely on AI, of course, and I didn't have time to test most of those, while some of the most interesting, like the Camera Coach, weren't available yet on the demo units I tried.\nSome of those AI features seem very cool and potentially useful. I saw a live translation feature in action that was like nothing I've seen \u2013 it was almost frightening.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nI'm also a Pixel user as well as an iPhone user, so I know the Pixel does the best job of screening phone calls and managing notifications. I'm curious to see how the new Magic Cue features will offer more AI functionality, but I always suspect the AI is being overpromised until I see it in action. Will the Pixel 10 really get to know me? Will it really pull up my flight details at the perfect moment? Time will tell.\nWe\u2019ll have a full review of the Pixel 10 coming soon, after the phones have undergone extensive testing in Future Labs. If you have a Pixel 9, I think you can hold off the upgrade for now \u2013 the differences are slight, and even Pixelsnap can be mimicked with a case that has MagSafe magnets.\nOf course, it\u2019s hard to find a new feature that will stay cutting-edge for long. The Pixel 10 may beat the Galaxy S25 and iPhone 16 when it comes to cameras, but those models are half-a-year to a year old \u2013 middle-aged by smartphone standards. The Galaxy S26 will surely have magnets to fit its Qi2 credentials, and who knows what the iPhone 17 will bring.\nIf you\u2019re coming from an older Android or if you\u2019re a curious iPhone owner, we\u2019ll know soon if the Pixel 10 can hold its own as a camera phone, and whether the new AI features inspire more creativity or existential dread. Has the Google Pixel 10 truly leapt ahead of this year\u2019s best phones, or will it soon fall behind what\u2019s to come? Check out more of my hands-on first impressions below, then come back for our full review.\nGoogle Pixel 10 hands-on review: Price & availability\nThe Pixel 10 costs the same as last year\u2019s Pixel 9, and the base model features the same 128GB of storage and 12GB of RAM inside, which may be falling behind the requirements of the upcoming AI features. I\u2019d certainly like to see more storage, at least.\nThe phone is available in black (Obsidian), light blue (Frost), green (Lemongrass), and bright blue (Indigo). The Indigo will be Google\u2019s hero color, but I think the Lemongrass also stands out nicely. The Frost color looks closer to the Pixel 10 Pro\u2019s Moonstone shade than the name suggests.\nMy big caveat with Pixel phones is that Google\u2019s pricing takes a rollercoaster ride throughout the year, with the first drop coming around the US holiday shopping season. Last year\u2019s Pixel 9 launched in August at $799 in the US, and dropped to $649 in November. It spent more than half the year priced at $150 under the original price, and it dropped to an all-time low of $499 around the last Amazon Prime Day in July.\nIn other words, if you want the Pixel 10, you may want to wait until it\u2019s available for less \u2013 although if you wait too long Google might drop a Pixel 10a on us, just to confuse matters.\nGoogle Pixel 10 hands-on review: Specifications\nThe Google Pixel 10 uses Google\u2019s Tensor G5 chipset, just like every other member of the Pixel 10 family. It comes with 12GB of RAM, which was a respectable amount in the days before on-device AI processing, but now is probably only just enough.\nThe Pixel 10 gains a 10.8MP, 5x zoom camera this year in addition to the 48MP wide camera and the 13MP ultra-wide. That\u2019s not just more zoom than the Galaxy S25, it also comes with a bigger sensor, regardless of the megapixel count.\nOddly enough, the Pixel 10 comes with a slightly larger battery than the Pixel 10 Pro, at 4,970mAh vs 4,870mAh. It charges at 30W, just like the Pixel 10 Pro, with Qi2 wireless charging at up to 15W.\nDimensions: | 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.6mm |\nWeight: | 204g |\nDisplay: | 6.3-inch Actua display |\nResolution: | 1080 x 2424 pixels |\nRefresh rate: | 60-120Hz |\nPeak brightness: | 3,000 nits |\nChipset: | Google Tensor G5 |\nRAM: | 12GB |\nStorage: | 128GB / 256GB |\nOS: | Android 16 |\nWide camera: | 48MP; f/1.7; 0.5-inch sensor |\nUltrawide camera: | 13MP; f/2.2; 0.33-inch sensor |\nTelephoto camera: | 10.8MP; f/3.1; 0.31-inch sensor |\nSelfie camera: | 10.5MP; f/2.2 |\nBattery: | 4,970mAh |\nCharging: | 25W wired; 15W wireless Qi2 |\nColors: | Indigo, Frost, Lemongrass, Obsidian |\nGoogle Pixel 10 hands-on review: Design\nThe Pixel 10 looks just like last year\u2019s Pixel 9, aside from some minor changes to the color, materials, and finish. That\u2019s not a bad thing at all \u2013 the Pixel 9 was one of my favorite new phone designs, and it was the biggest refresh we saw among all the major flagship phones last year. I\u2019m happy the Pixel 10 isn\u2019t a huge departure.\nAfter all, the Pixel 9a was somehow a butt-ugly cheap relation of the Pixel 9, and I was worried that its flat design foreshadowed this year\u2019s flagship phones. Never fear! The Pixel 10 keeps the same pill-shaped camera bump as last year\u2019s model, with the same improved durability. It\u2019s a great phone design, and it even looks good in a case.\nThere is still room for improvement. Did Google not see the iPhone 16\u2019s Camera Control button? I suspect future Pixel phones might have a matching button in the future. They already got MagSafe, why not go all the way?\nSpeaking of magnets, the Pixel 10 with Pixelsnap held a very strong connection to all of the accessories I tried. You couldn\u2019t shake the phone off of the wireless charging puck, which is a hidden part of the new wireless charging stand. I\u2019ll be excited to use Google\u2019s new phones with all of my MagSafe accessories, like my wallet and my magnetic photo tripod.\nGoogle Pixel 10 hands-on review: Display\nGoogle quietly makes the best displays you\u2019ll find on any smartphone, and I\u2019m shocked the company doesn\u2019t spend more time bragging about it. The Actua displays on previous Pixels have always been among the most bright and colorful screens I\u2019ve used, and the Pixel 10 seems like another improvement, if only a subtle one.\nThe Pixel 10 has a variable refresh rate from 60-120Hz, which means things should look nice and smooth when you\u2019re scrolling through long menus or social feeds. Unfortunately, that also means it won\u2019t get the full-color always-on screen you\u2019ll find on LTPO phones like the Pixel 10 Pro.\nI\u2019ll need to spend a lot more time with the Pixel 10 to decide if the screen is as great as it seems. I\u2019m hoping the long-term experience will be just as pleasing.\nGoogle Pixel 10 hands-on review: Software\nGoogle is, for now, leaving us with more questions than answers when it comes to Pixel software. Gemini works in more places \u2013 the onward march of AI progress \u2013 but there are many other features that are going to require a deep dive.\nI\u2019m very curious about the Magic Cue features available during phone calls. Google says the Pixel 10 will pull up details about your travel plans when somebody mentions AirBnB, for instance. I\u2019m curious how far it will go, and whether this feature will seem like a privacy invasion or a useful sidekick.\nThere are also new camera features to try, which I\u2019ll discuss below, but Google is moving beyond editing and generating images to offering tips and instructions. I like this direction. I would rather have a phone that can anticipate my needs, and offer helpful suggestions, than a phone that makes nightmare images of copyrighted cartoon characters committing crimes, as past Pixel phones have done.\nOne of the most impressive new features is the live translation. While other phones, like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25, can live-translate a foreign language speaker during a conversation, the Pixel 10 family has a new trick: it makes the translation sound like the voice of the speaker.\nIf I speak to you in English while you speak Hindi back to me, the Pixel 10 will translate my words into Hindi, and it will make the Hindi speaker sound like a version of me. The TechRadar team got a demo of this feature with our Editor-at-Large Lance Ulanoff speaking, and at the other end what we heard was a Spanish-speaking version of Lance sounding like a native-born speaker. It was uncanny.\nGoogle also says this process happens mostly on the device, which should settle some privacy concerns. Still, I\u2019m wary of a computer that can instantly talk in a voice that sounds like mine; even though it only happens in a foreign language, it still gives me pause.\nGoogle Pixel 10 hands-on review: Cameras\nI\u2019m most excited to try the new camera features on the Pixel 10, because the cameras sees like the biggest improvement on this phone. First of all there\u2019s the new 5x telephoto lens, which is paired with a respectable 0.33-inch image sensor. That\u2019s bigger than the zoom sensor on the Galaxy S25, and is closer to the telephoto camera on the iPhone 16 Pro.\nSecond, the Tensor G5 chipset has an all-new image signal processor, and that component is often the silent partner in making the best camera phones. A new ISP usually means faster processing \u2013 so higher-resolution video recording and better night photography. It could also mean other image enhancements.\nGoogle is talking up the Super Zoom features, but we\u2019ve seen AI zoom before. It may save an otherwise useless 30x zoom pic, but it\u2019s not going to help the Pixel 10 create long-distance images you\u2019ll want to hang on the wall.\nGoogle Pixel 10 hands-on review: Performance\nHow will the Tensor G5 perform? Undoubtedly, it won\u2019t be winning any benchmark races, but that\u2019s never been the point of Google\u2019s Tensor chips. Google builds accelerated chips that work better with its own AI and machine-learning features, like the Magic Editor in Google Photos and the AI transcriptions in the Recorder app.\nThis time around, Google says the Tensor G5 enables features like the aforementioned live translation that sounds like the person speaking, along with a host of new photography features like the Camera Coach.\nThe good news is that Google processes more of its machine-learning tricks on the phone than most other phone makers. That means you aren\u2019t burning fossil fuels to feed a server farm for those AI features. It also means you have a better chance of protecting your privacy when it comes to your AI demands.\nGoogle Pixel 10 hands-on review: Battery\nI can almost forgive whatever battery life I get from the Pixel 10 because I\u2019m excited to use the Pixelsnap feature to keep the phone charged. I have MagSafe chargers that I use next to my bed with my iPhone, but Apple\u2019s device will now get the USB-C cord while my Pixel 10 takes over the magnetic stand. It isn\u2019t a fast way to charge, but my phone will be there all night, so I don\u2019t need to hurry.\nI\u2019m curious to see if the Tensor G5 chip will offer any battery life improvements. Qualcomm\u2019s latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset has been a powerhouse not only in terms of performance but also efficiency. Every Snapdragon 8 Elite phone has been able to last much longer than the generation before, and I hope I see the same benefits from the Tensor G5 when I conduct a thorough review.\nPhil Berne is a preeminent voice in consumer electronics reviews, starting more than 20 years ago at eTown.com.

With the Galaxy S25 launch, Samsung took the lead making the fastest Android phone you can buy, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra packs the most impressive camera array we've ever seen.\nBut 2025 is only getting started for Samsung. At the end of Galaxy Unpacked in January, Samsung teased a Galaxy S25 Edge, a super-thin phone coming later this year. We'd heard rumors that Apple was working on an iPhone 17 Air, so it looks like Samsung may beat its rival to market with the latest slim phone fad. Will it be worth buying, or just a technical accomplishment? We'll know soon enough.\nWe're also expecting big news from Samsung's foldable team this year, because the foldable phone market is hotter than ever, and once again we have rumors suggesting Apple may make a splash. Will Samsung launch the thinnest tablet foldable to compete with the Oppo Find N5, the thinnest phone you can buy? We'll find out later this year.\nI've tested all of the best Samsung phones, from the mighty (and mighty expensive) Galaxy Z Fold 6 to the brand new Galaxy 25, along with most competing Android and iPhone models, so you can trust this list to rank and explain what makes these Samsung phones the best choice.\nOnce you're done marveling over Samsung's phones, check out our list of the best Android tablets, because Samsung makes most of them.\nQuick list\nHere are the best Samsung phones you can buy, whether you want the absolute top phones or the most affordable options with all of Samsung's best features.\nbest overall\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra is one of the best camera phones you can buy, with the most versatile lenses and shooting modes, and now an improved sensor on the ultrawide lens to help with detail and macro photography.\nRead more below\nBest foldable\nThe best Samsung phone does everything, and the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is a phone, a tablet, a desktop computer, a drawing slate, and everything else you can imagine a phone could be.\nRead more below\nBest Battery\nThe Galaxy S25 Plus has the best battery life of any Samsung phone we've tested, even better than the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which makes it the best pick if you need a phone that lasts longer.\nRead more below\nBest for teens\nThe Galaxy S25 isn't a cheap phone to buy your teenager, but it is very durable, with enough software updates on the way to last until they're independent adults, and it's powerful enough to do everything they want a phone to do.\nRead more below\nBest flip phone\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 6 is my favorite flip phone overall, thanks to its fast performance and improved durable design.

He has reviewed hundreds of smartphones, tablets, and mobile devices.\nThe best Samsung phones in 2024\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nI've reviewed all of the phones on this list and we have tested every Samsung phone in Future Labs, so you can be sure that we are recommending the best Samsung phone you can buy.\nThe best overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want more than any other smartphone: There is no phone you can buy that matches everything the Galaxy S25 Ultra can do, except possibly the Galaxy S24 Ultra.\n\u2705 You want a phone that is future proof: The Galaxy AI features are just warming up, and with seven years of major Android OS updates, and plenty of new AI features to come, the Galaxy S25 Ultra will be the first phone to take that step into the next generation.\n\u274c You don't need everything this phone can do: The Galaxy S25 Plus can do almost as much as the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but it doesn't cost nearly as much, so maybe you don't need the S Pen.\n\u274c You prefer something easier to use: Samsung keeps adding apps, features, and bloat, and the menus get harder to use every generation. If you want a big phone that makes things easy, look at the iPhone 16 Pro Max instead.\n\ud83d\udcf1 The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra pushes the bounds of smartphone performance, offering top tier features and class-leading power. It comes at a premium price, but if you want the absolute best in performance, camera quality, and features, the Galaxy S25 Ultra stands in a class all its own. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra from Samsung elevates smartphone expectations. It exceeds the iPhone in both battery life and processing performance, and features a more adaptable set of cameras than any competing Android handset.\nDesign: This Galaxy S25 Ultra now countenances a curvier shape, making it somewhat more attractive, although it bears a stronger resemblance to the less expensive Galaxy S25. The display has expanded marginally compared to the previous year's S24 Ultra, yet the phone's overall weight has decreased.\nDisplay: The brilliant AMOLED display of the Galaxy S25 Ultra delivers an unmatched smartphone viewing experience. Although slightly brighter or faster displays might be available on competing phones, the anti-reflective coating seals the deal, enhancing visibility in outdoor settings.\nCamera: With its 3X and 5X zoom lenses, in addition to standard wide and an improved ultra-wide cameras, the Galaxy S25 Ultra provides the most adaptable camera setup of any smartphone. The zoom lenses utilize considerably smaller sensors, limiting image quality to sharing rather than printing, but the output remains the most remarkable of any phone you'll encounter.\nPerformance: The Galaxy S25 Ultra is the definitive option for users who require world-beating speed. It turned in the quickest performance of any phone evaluated in our benchmarks and real world testing, including gaming and productivity work, even surpassing the iPhone 16 Pro. This achievement represents a new milestone for Android phones, which fell behind Apple's iPhone for years, but not any more.\nBattery: The Galaxy S25 Ultra comfortably delivers two days of regular usage and effortlessly manages a full day of intensive operation. Without a boost in battery size, that Snapdragon 8 Elite platform appears to consume power more efficiently, leading to notably enhanced battery life.\nValue: The Galaxy S25 Ultra carries a premium price tag, and the upgrades might not appear revolutionary. Nevertheless, Samsung's pledge of seven years of software support, including yearly major Android OS upgrades, considerably boosts the phone's long-term value, and the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor is expected to be capable of supporting future AI updates for years to come.\nRead our full Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review\nPhotos taken with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\nValue | Samsung held fast on the Galaxy S25 Ultra price. it's not a cheap phone, but design updates, integrated AI and inclusion of the S Pen make it good value. | 4.5/5 |\nDesign | The Galaxy S25 Ultra is now fully part of the Galaxy S-series design family and that generally improves it. We have a bigger screen, thinner and lighter body, and we still have all the things that make an Ultra special, including the titanium, the S-Pen and a big-enough battery. | 4/5 |\nDisplay | The biggest Ultra screen ever. It doesn't break any new ground on technology, but is still an excellent screen for all kinds of content and uses. | 5/5 |\nCameras | There are a lot of lenses here and they're backed by high-pixel counts that will result in extremely detailed photos. Samsung only updated one lens since the last Ultra, but choosing the ultra-wide was the right move, as it improves both ultra-wide and macro images. | 4.5 |\nSoftware and AI | Samsung's and its partners' commitment to deep AI integration is laudable, and it makes for the most frictionless AI experience I've found on any smartphone. It's also backed by a solid and even more useful One UI update. And the AI experience will likely get richer over time | 4.5/5 |\nPerformance | The S25 Ultra's Qualcomm Snapdragon Gen 8 Elite for Galaxy is one impressive chip. It's a near-perfect mix of performance and efficiency. | 5/5 |\nBattery | Best battery life I've seen on a smartphone. Days of use is within reach. | 5/5 |\nThe best foldable\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want two devices in one: There's a powerful, if narrow smartphone on the outside and a Galaxy tablet with S Pen within. It's flexible and versatile.\n\u2705 You need a Pro folding phone: The Pixel Pro Fold has Pro in the name, but Samsung has Pro in the software, with many more multi-tasking features\n\u2705 You want quality photography: Forget about foldable phones having bad cameras. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 took remarkable pics, up close and far away.\n\u274c You're on a budget: At $1,619 / \u00a31,799 / AU $2,749, this is one of the most expensive phones on the market. At the very least, look for deals before you buy.\n\u274c You a normal cover display: The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is oddly narrow. It still looks great, but other foldable phones have a cover display that looks like a normal phone.\n\u274c You demand the best in camera optics: For the best in phone photography, look elsewhere, like the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, which has bigger sensors and 5X telephoto zoom.\n\ud83d\udcf1The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is a do-everything device with few compromises. It's great for multi-tasking, drawing and doodles, and watching Netflix, and it outperforms the competition. It costs a lot, but you get it all. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nWhat you need to know\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 6 is Samsung's no holds barred super-phone. Samsung took a phone that could already do everything and bent it in half, making it a phone and mini tablet in one. It has the best cameras of any foldable, bucking the trend, and it's powerful enough to replace a laptop. Seriously.\nDesign: The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is a sturdy, polished foldable phone that looks compact and clean. It is durable and water resistant, and it folds nice and flat. It isn't the thinnest foldable phone you can buy, but the difference is minimal, and the Z Fold 6 is still easy to carry and hold. I just wish the front display were wider.\nDisplay: The main screen is a 7.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with 2176 x 1812 resolution, and it's really a big, beautiful screen. Samsung is the only foldable phone maker I've used that supports a real precision stylus, just make sure you get the right S Pen for the Fold line. The cover screen is wider this year than last year, but it still doesn't quite look normal. It offers plenty of room, though, and it makes a bright viewfinder when I'm taking photos.\nCamera: I compared the best foldable phones, and the Galaxy Z Fold 6 took the best photos in almost every situation. It also shot the best video footage I got from a foldable phone. It isn't quite as good as a Galaxy S24, but the photos still looked clean and exciting, thanks to Samsung's dramatic saturation.\nPerformance: With a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy inside, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is one of the fastest phones I've tested ... and that includes the latest iPhones. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 makes an excellent high-performance phones since it was so fun for gaming on the big screen, or for getting work done.\nBattery life: I got more than a day of battery life on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 with balanced use, but using that tempting inner display will drain the battery more quickly.\nValue for money: It's incredibly expensive, but you might find a great deal if you're willing to sign a contract or trade another incredibly expensive phone to get one.\nRead our full Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 review\nPhotos taken with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | The best foldabe design Samsung has ever produced. Sharp and pro-looking at every level | 4.5 / 5 |\nDisplay | A wider cover display and noticeably improved Main screen prove a formidable combo | 4.5 / 5 |\nPerformance | The best Qualcomm has to offer with a ittle bit more that shows in benchmarks and day-to-day performance | 4.5 / 5 |\nCamera | Still good camera array but Samsung could've done more for its flagship foldable | 4 / 5 |\nSoftware | A good blend of Android 14, foldable-friendly utility and Samsung's OneUI | 4.5 / 5 |\nValue | More expensive than ever but there's no denying it's a two-for-one mobile device that's stuffed with power, fun, utility, and AI | 3.5 / 5 |\nThe best battery life\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want top notch performance: The Galaxy S25 Plus has all the power of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, with the same high-resolution display and faster charging, for much less.\n\u2705 You want a bigger, sharper screen: The Galaxy S25 Plus gives you more than a bigger screen, it also gives you Samsung's ProScaler technology and the highest pixel density.\n\u2705 You want more battery life: I got amazing battery life from the Galaxy S25 Plus, and the Plus outperformed even the Galaxy S25 Ultra in our battery lab tests.\n\u274c You want the long zoom cameras: The 5X zoom camera and the high-resolution ultra-wide sensor are the best advantages that the Galaxy S25 Ultra has over the Galaxy S25 Plus.\n\u274c You need easy software: Samsung's OneUI interface is bloated and complicated; more difficult than Apple's iOS by far. Even Google's Pixel 9 is easier to use.\n\ud83d\udcf1 The Galaxy S25 Plus has great battery life and a big, sharp display, with fantastic performance to boot. It gives you all the Samsung features you need and nothing you don't. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nThe Galaxy S25 Plus is incredibly impressive. It might seem surprising that Samsung's middle-tier model is our favorite Samsung model, but it provides identical performance, the same crisp and vibrant display, and the same excellent battery life as the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It's hard to justify spending significantly more for features that even premium users won't utilize.\nDesign: While it lacks the titanium frame of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus is available in a variety of more attractive colors and maintains a premium and contemporary aesthetic.\nDisplay: The Galaxy S25 Plus features a display that is not only larger than the Galaxy S25 but also packs more pixels, resulting in a higher resolution than the Galaxy S25, and it even offers slightly more sharpness than the Galaxy S25 Ultra.\nCamera: You could spend considerably more for 5X zoom on the Ultra, but the Galaxy S25 Plus features a 3X optical zoom camera, in addition to a fantastic main camera and an ultra-wide lens. Samsung's shooting modes and AI photography also help the phone take great pics.\nPerformance: The Galaxy S25 Plus delivers top-tier performance thanks to the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. In our benchmark tests, the Snapdragon often outperformed the Apple A18 Pro chipset found in the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The Galaxy S25 Plus will effortlessly handle your gaming and productivity demands.\nBattery life: The Galaxy S25 Plus lasted longer than nearly every other smartphone I've tested, lasting just a bit longer than the larger Galaxy S25 Ultra. It also charges quickly and offers reverse charging, should you need to power up your earbuds while on the go.\nValue: The Galaxy S25 Plus launched at a price point similar to the iPhone 16 Pro, but Samsung phones are consistently available at a discount, so check Amazon, your preferred mobile carrier, or Samsung's own online store before you make that final click.\nPhotos taken with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus\nValue | Worth the premium over the Galaxy S25, with a display and battery life that beat the more expensive Ultra. Still expensive, but worth the high price. | 4/5 |\nDesign | A solid, refined look that hasn\u2019t changed much over the years, and strongly resembles its biggest rival. I\u2019m ready for something new, but this design is a classic, with good color options this year. | 3/5 |\nDisplay | A fantastic display that\u2019s bright and colorful, making it easy to use in any situation, even taking photos in bright sunshine. I only wish the fingerprint scanner were more responsive, but it\u2019s still a great screen with minimal bezels. | 5/5 |\nSoftware | Samsung has improved One UI with a refreshed look and brighter colors. The bloatware problem is growing, though, and many of the Galaxy AI features mentioned at launch don\u2019t show up on the phone. | 3/5 |\nCameras | Takes good photos, but you can find much better cameras on competing phones, with bigger sensors and more pixels. It\u2019s time for an Ultra-fied camera upgrade for the rest of the Galaxy S25 lineup. | 4/5 |\nPerformance | You won\u2019t find a faster phone than the Galaxy S25 Plus, but what will you do with all that power? This Snapdragon wins benchmark tests, but in real-world performance it\u2019s less apparent. Still, it\u2019s the fastest phone around, even if you can\u2019t see it. | 5/5 |\nBattery | Excellent battery life, topping even the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but the OnePlus 13 is far more impressive, with longer battery life and much faster charging. It\u2019s time for Samsung to catch up if it wants to remain at the top. | 4/5 |\nThe best for teens\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're want power on a budget: The Galaxy S25 isn't cheap, but it packs as much power as the Galaxy S25 Ultra for much less.\n\u2705 You want a compact phone: The 6.2-inch Galaxy S25 offers plenty of power for a phone this small, and you can't find a more powerful phone this size.\n\u2705 You need serious power: Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset is plenty powerful for any task, even running an external display or using the latest AI models.\n\u274c You want a big screen: A 6.2-inch display used to be huge, but these days it's feeling a bit cramped, especially if you're used to a big phone like an iPhone Pro Max or a Galaxy Ultra.\n\u274c Your budget can stretch: For a lot more cash you can have a much better camera system, a magical S Pen accessories, and a huge screen with a big battery inside, if you get the Galaxy S25 Ultra.\n\u274c All of your friends use the iPhone: Samsung's software is a big weakness, and it's lagging behind Apple's iOS in social features that make it fun to share with other iPhone users. If your crowd is all Apple, all the time, check out the iPhone 16.\n\ud83d\udcf1 The Samsung Galaxy S25 packs a serious punch for its small size, with a Snapdragon 8 Elite inside that can handle any task you'd imagine, and thanks to Galaxy AI, even some tasks you never thought possible. There is a lot of software bloat, and of course you can get a lot more from Samsung if you spend more, but the Galaxy S25 is the best compact phone if you need a strong mobile champion for a bit less. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25, the smallest of the Galaxy S25 family, is a remarkably powerful Android. Its compact size makes it the most pocket-friendly option among today's flagship phones.\nDesign: The Galaxy S25 offers a wider range of colors compared to the Galaxy S25 Ultra. However, it forgoes the titanium frame found in the Ultra. Despite this, the S25 remains a robust device with IP68 water resistance and a design reminiscent of its predecessor.\nDisplay: The 6.1-inch display on the Galaxy S25 provides a sharp viewing experience. You don't get the ProScaler tech from Samsung TVs, but I couldn't spot the difference compared to the Galaxy S25 Plus.\nCameras: While the Galaxy S25's camera hardware remains unchanged, Samsung's improved image processing results in better photos. The camera system includes a 50MP main lens, a 12MP ultra-wide lens, and a 10MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom\u2014a feature absent in the iPhone 16.\nPerformance: The Galaxy S25 family is powered by the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor, which delivers exceptional performance. It rivals even the Apple iPhone 16 Pro in speed and efficiency, making it ideal for demanding tasks and gaming.\nBattery life: The Galaxy S25 uses the same battery capacity as the Galaxy S24. Nevertheless, battery life has improved, and most users can expect a full day of typical use.\nValue for money: The Galaxy S25 provides an accessible entry point to the Samsung Galaxy S experience. While it doesn't offer all the features of the S25 Ultra, it comes at a significantly lower price.\nPhotos taken with the Samsung Galaxy S25\nValue | The fastest phone in this price range by a small margin, but the design and specs are getting a bit stale. | 4/5 |\nDesign | The Galaxy S is starting to feel like the same great song stuck on repeat. The phone looks refined with great color options this year, but it also looks just like last year\u2019s model, and the model before that. | 4/5 |\nDisplay | A fantastic-looking display that\u2019s plenty bright, even on a sunny day. It\u2019s smooth and responsive (except for the fingerprint reader), with a very slim bezel. | 4/5 |\nSoftware | Samsung\u2019s One UI 7 looks great, but many of the AI features have failed to materialize, for better and for worse. It does a lot, though it\u2019s bloated with software, but Samsung keeps improving, and this phone will get seven years of software updates. | 3/5 |\nCameras | Very nice cameras that always deliver a great photo, no matter the lighting or subject. I wish there was more zoom and more megapixels available, since the Galaxy S hasn\u2019t seen a camera boost in years, but the AI editing helps smooth rough edges. | 4/5 |\nPerformance | Superlative smartphone performance, really the best you\u2019ll find at any price, though I\u2019m not sure where all of that power is going. Probably the AI? If so, it\u2019s going to get even better over the next few years as the AI develops, but for now it\u2019s just great for playing games with the settings cranked to maximum. | 5/5 |\nBattery | Excellent battery life, the best you\u2019ll find on a phone this size. It lasted a full day in my review testing, and hours longer than the iPhone 16 in our lab tests. I wish it charged faster, but it\u2019s quite capable, with great wireless charging features. | 4/5 |\nThe best flip phone\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a flip phone to keep a while: The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is more durable than the competition, and it will get seven years of software updates.\n\u2705 You want to carry your flip phone to work: Peach Fuzz may be a fun Razr color, but the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is more professional than cool, and it's better for getting work done.\n\u2705 You want to try all the AI features: Samsung's AI features are actually useful and cool to try, if you want to see what the future is all about.\n\u274c You want two phones in one: The cover screen on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is a big let down, especially compared to the Razr 2024, which gives you a versatile device on the outside.\n\u274c You need the best cameras: There's no zoom lens and the image quality is fine, but not great. If you care about photos, get a flat phone for the same price.\n\u274c You don't find a deal: The Galaxy Z Flip 6 might be more expensive than last year's model, depending on where you live, and that's a bit too much. Find a deal or get a bundle to soften the impact.\n\ud83d\udcf1 The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 is the best flip phone you can buy today. It tops the competition, especially the Motorola Razr Plus 2024, with more power, durability, and class, though the Razr does look like it's having a lot of fun. This is the flip phone to get if you want a phone that will last a long time, for work and for play. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nWhat you need to know\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 is Samsung's most refined Flip phone yet, and the improvements are clear when you feel the more durable build quality and amazing power. It doesn't do enough with the cover display, but hopefully future software updates will improve things.\nDesign: The Galaxy Z Flip 6 looks like every other flat phone until you bend it in half, and that's a compliment. It feels solid and durable, like I could crease it a hundred times a day for years and it wouldn't break. I also like the classy color options and the cool textured black design.\nDisplay: The inner display on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is incredibly large for such a compact phone. It beats any iPhone you can buy and gives you a bright, colorful display for games and reading. The cover display can't do much, but it works well as a viewfinder or to check your calendar. You can type a message on it, but it can't run most apps.\nCameras: The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is made for selfies and group photos, so you won't find a zoom lens or high-performance cameras. It's still a lot of fun to find unique angles to place the folded phone, and using the video camera in old-school camcorder mode is a blast.\nPerformance: The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy processor inside is one of the most powerful mobile platforms you'll find on any phone. Too bad Samsung limited what the Galaxy Z Flip 6 can do, like removing DeX desktop environment software, because it feels like this phone is capable of more.\nBattery life: The Galaxy Z Flip 6 had no trouble lasting through a full day of use, though battery life could have been a bit better. Less powerful flip phones also last a bit longer, but that's the trade-off for speed.\nValue for money: The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is expensive, and without more utility on its cover display it feels like you're not getting everything you pay for. I'd wait to find this phone at a discount or part of a great bundle offer.\nRead our full Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 review\nPhotos taken with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is a good value compared to other Galaxy phones and the competition, but is it worth as much as Apple\u2019s best iPhone 15 Pro? That\u2019s the question a foldable flip phone this expensive needs to answer. | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is more durable and refined than ever, with a frame that looks more like an iPhone in a business meeting than a Motorola Razr trying to find the party. | 4 / 5 |\nDisplay | A front-pocket phone that hides a very nice, big inner display and a competent cover screen. Too bad the cover is being wasted by a lack of features, but having a huge phone that you can fold in half is still very appealing | 4 / 5 |\nSoftware | First time I ever wanted more software from Samsung, but I wish the Galaxy Z Flip 6 took more advantage of its cover screen and its flippy-ness. It does most of what Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S24 can do, but it should do everything and more. | 3 / 5 |\nCamera | Flip-phone cameras will always need to compromise, and the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is no exception. The lack of zoom hurts worse than the lack of quality, though. Fun and advanced AI photo-editing tools help soothe the pain. | 3 / 5 |\nPerformance | Wow, simply astounding performance that beats almost everything else I\u2019ve tested, including many iPhone Pro models. Too bad this phone doesn\u2019t get Samsung DeX or cover-screen superpowers; it can definitely handle harder tasks. | 5 / 5 |\nBattery | Disappointing battery life means this phone can\u2019t last as long as the competition. The Moto Razr can still party after work, but the Galaxy Z Flip 6 will need a long nap to recharge. | 3 / 5 |\nThe best Samsung bargain\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a reasonably priced Galaxy: The Galaxy S24 FE finds the sweet spot between price and power.\n\u2705 You're looking for AI on a budget: Many of the best AI phones come with a high price tag, but the Galaxy S24 FE offers a full suite of AI features.\n\u2705 You're a true Samsung fan: Whether FE stands for Fan Edition remains a hot debate, but with Galaxy AI, DeX, and OneUI, you'll be getting all the features Samsung is famed for.\n\u274c You need the very best performance: At this price point, there's no way the Galaxy S24 FE can keep up with high-end and super-premium flagships.\n\u274c You want the very best cameras: The Galaxy S24 FE comes with a solid camera system, but the snappers found on the flagship S24 range still outdo it.\n\u274c You like to keep things simple: Samsung loads its phones with options and settings, and, while it's nice to have choice, Apple and Google still lead the way in simplicity.\n\ud83d\udcf1 The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE goes well beyond our expectations for a typical midrange flagship variant, offering users the full Galaxy AI suite, a brilliant display, premium build quality, and great battery life. That said, the performance, design, and cameras don't quite live up to the flagship S24 line. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nWhat you need to know\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 FE brings the staple midrange Galaxy S phone into the AI age, with a full suite of Galaxy AI features, pro-grade software including the DeX desktop mode, and a specs sheet that earnestly comes close to flagship-level. It's an impressive phone that makes sensible cutbacks to reach its mid-tier price.\nDesign: Heavier and thicker than the flagship S24, the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE feels built to last, and the glass used in its construction can take a beating. It's not exactly svelte, but still feels premium.\nDisplay: The Galaxy S24 FE comes equipped with a bright, sharp, and detailed display that gets bright and comes with a variety of display modes. It's hard to notice that this isn't a flagship display.\nCameras: While not as ludicrously powerful as the camera system on the S24 Ultra, and not quite matching the S24, the S24 FE offers a lot of flexibility. The 50MP main camera has more than enough detail for all kinds of shots, while the 3x optical telephoto camera is a rarity at this price.\nPerformance: Samsung holds its own with the proprietary Exynos 2400e chipset found within the Galaxy S24 FE. This is a powerful and versatile chipset that flies through day to day use and faces more challenging workflows with vigor, but it can take a while to load up AI features.\nBattery life: The Galaxy S24 FE boasts even better battery life than its predecessor and even better longevity than the flagship S24, and proved somewhat difficult to run down all the way in a single day of normal use. It supports both wireless charging and power sharing, and charges at a reasonable 25W.\nValue for money: Samsung makes a lot of mid-range phones, but none of them have as much ambition as the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE. This is an impressive phone by any standards, and you'll be hard-pressed to find one that offers more for the same price.\nRead our full Samsung Galaxy S24 FE review\nPhotos taken with the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | It'll be hard to find another phone this capable at this price point | 5 / 5 |\nDesign | A minimalistic look and larger frame will appeal to some, and is at the least inoffensive. | 4 / 5 |\nDisplay | A great display that pulls few punches, but could be a bit brighter. | 4.5 / 5 |\nSoftware | Galaxy AI is here, but the overall experience could feel more cohesive. | 3.5 / 5 |\nCamera | Solid performance from a versatile camera system, with a surprising level of optical zoom. | 4 / 5 |\nPerformance | Samsung's own Exynos 2400e chipset proves to be a worthy contender, with the only slowdown seen in AI tasks. | 4.5 / 5 |\nBattery | Astoundingly good battery life makes it difficult to run the S24 FE down in a normal day. | 5 / 5 |\nHow to choose the best Samsung Galaxy phone\nIf you've decided to buy a Samsung phone, the next consideration is how much you want to spend. The best Samsung phones cost more than the Apple iPhone, making them the most expensive smartphones you can buy. Make sure you aren't paying more for features you don't need.\nDo you need a pen? The S Pen is more than a stylus, it's also a Bluetooth remote control, but is it worth paying more? Do you need a foldable display? You can replace your tablet with a tablet foldable, but it will cost more than an average phone and tablet together.\nDecide how much you want to spend, wait a moment, because Samsung phones go on sale often. We saw deals on Samsung phones over Black Friday, and Samsung offers trade-in bonuses, bundle offers with earbuds, and other discounts throughout the year.\nWhat makes a Samsung better than other Android phones?\nSamsung makes much of the technology used in mobile phones, even phones from other phone makers, and it is known for producing top tier components. Samsung displays, Samsung memory, and processors made on Samsung's foundries (including chips from other chipmakers), are often the highest quality available, and Samsung uses those components on its own phones.\nSamsung also offers the most robust service and support among any Android phone maker. If you Samsung phone breaks (or if you break it) and you need help, Samsung has a proven track record and numerous options to get your phone fixed.\nHow we test\nHow we test the best Samsung Galaxy phones\nWe only include phones that we've fully reviewed in this guide, so every entry has been extensively tested. As such, we can be confident of how each model compares to other Samsung phones, and to the wider smartphone landscape.\nAs well as the review score, we consider the specs of a phone, how well it all comes together in practice, how much it costs, how good value it is, and how it compares to the competition.\nTo come to these conclusions we'll make use of every key feature of a phone, see how it performs under different circumstances, and see how the battery holds up under different use cases. We'll also run benchmarks.\nWith all that information combined, we're then able to see exactly how each Samsung phone stacks up.\n- See our Samsung promo codes page for this month's best discounts\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nPhil Berne is a preeminent voice in consumer electronics reviews, starting more than 20 years ago at eTown.com.

      "text": "13 things we saw at the wild Google Pixel 10 launch \u2013 including the best Pixel phones yet\nWe had a pretty good idea of what to expect at the 2025 Made by Google event, thanks the many leaks and teasers from Google itself, but it was certainly still a packed launch. Jimmy Fallon looking bemused, several unsubtle digs at Apple, squirrels drinking Pixel coffee \u2013 it had it all.\nAs for the tech, Google ushered in the Pixel 10, with fun colors and three cameras, as well as the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL, and even a new foldable. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold does look impressive, but Samsung\u2019s still got it beat on thickness.\nEven so, these all feature Google\u2019s latest in silicon \u2013 the Tensor G5 \u2013 to make Android run swiftly and to power a bunch of AI features, including full diffusion models on the device.\nGoogle then showed off its repairability chops with the new Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Buds 2a. The smartwatch and earbuds, respectively, all boast repairable designs. The Watch 4 also steps things up with some neat AI features and a domed display.\nBut there\u2019s naturally still more to unpack, so below we've broken down the 13 biggest things we learned at Made by Google 2025...\n13 things we learned from the Made by Google 2025 event\n1. The base Pixel 10 finally has proper zoom\nThe Google Pixel 10 is arguably the most improved Pixel phone this year, because in addition to series-ranging features like Pixelsnap, Camera Coach, and the Tensor G5 chipset (all of which are detailed elsewhere in this roundup), it also gets a whole new camera.\nYes, that\u2019s right: Google has finally equipped its base Pixel with a dedicated telephoto sensor, meaning you no longer need to go Pro to access optical zoom capabilities. Specifically, the Pixel 10 gets a 10.8MP telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom and 20x digital zoom, which is the same telephoto camera as you\u2019ll find on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nOf course, the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL are still the zoom camera kings \u2013 they get a 48MP telephoto sensor and up to 100x digital zoom. But by shipping with three distinct cameras, the base Pixel 10 has got an early head start on the iPhone 17.\n- Read more: see our hands-on Google Pixel 10 review\n2. The Pixel 10 Pro series look like the best Pixels yet\nThe Pixel 9 Pro was our phone of the year in 2024, and the new 10 Pro and Pro XL look like worthy successors.\nCompatibility with Google's new Pixelsnap accessories (see entry no.4 below) is a big enough bonus on its own. But the new Pros also combine a Tensor G5 chip with genuinely useful Gemini features and some inevitable camera upgrades.\nThere's a new 5x telephoto lens, which is paired with a sensor that's bigger than the one on the Samsung Galaxy S25, and isn't far off the telephoto offering on the iPhone 16 Pro. And with new photography features like Camera Coach on board, we're again looking at very strong contenders for the title of best camera phone.\n- Read more: see our hands-on Google Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL review\n3. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold pushes foldables further with two key upgrades\nGoogle\u2019s Pixel 10 Pro Fold didn\u2019t rewrite the foldable script, but it\u2019s still an excellent flexible flagship with a great camera array (thanks for the 5x optical zoom) and more baked-in AI than your average smartphone.\nGoogle held the line on price (unlike some competitors), and polished key components, including a better selfie camera and the more capable Tensor G5 chip.\nHowever, it really got our attention with two key upgrades: IP68 dust and water resistance (a first for a foldable) and Pixel Snap with Qi2 support. It\u2019s like MagSafe (okay, don\u2019t call it that) has finally arrived on Android, and we could not be happier.\n- Read more: check out our hands-on Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold review\n4. There\u2019s finally a MagSafe equivalent for Android, and it\u2019s called Pixelsnap\nThis one is sure to make folks with a Samsung Galaxy jealous \u2013 not only is Google adopting the Qi2 standard for wireless charging on the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro Xl, and 10 Pro Fold, it\u2019s also adding a ring of magnets for something called PixelSnap.\nAnd if that sounds familiar, it\u2019s basically Apple\u2019s MagSafe for the Pixel lineup and MagSafe accessories do work with Pixelsnap \u2013 even the MagSafe Battery Pack. Google has a few first-party accessories, including a ring that doubles as a stand, a wireless charging stand that packs some good heft, and cases with magnetic rings inside.\n5. The Pixel 10's Camera app can help you get the best shot\nGoogle has long offered an excellent Camera app on all its Pixel devices, and the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL, and 10 Pro Fold all look to continue that tradition.\nThanks to Camera Coach, the Pixel will use models powered by Google Gemini to understand the scene you\u2019re trying to capture and then suggest different ways to make it the best shot possible.\nIt can even tell you which mode to use \u2013 for example, a standard photo or Portrait \u2013 or give you tips on like adjusting your angle, turning on more lights, or even suggest a wildly different shot for a unique photo.\n6. The Pixel Watch 4 has a new larger, curved display\nThe Pixel Watch 4 comes in two sizes \u2013 41mm or 45mm \u2013 and sticks with the now iconic, polished pebble-like circular build. It still has an all-glass front, but it\u2019s now domed with an 'Actual 360' display that is 1,000-nits brighter than the previous generation.\nThanks to this curve, which you can feel as you run your finger over it or while navigating the interface, the Pixel Watch 4 has a larger usable space which extends the on-screen content further.\nThis is paired with a new user interface that felt plenty zippy in our early hands-on thanks to a new Qualcomm-made chip under the hood. It also powers some neat software features including Smart Replies, which means the suggested replies for responding to a message actually make sense \u2013 or at least, that's the promise.\n- Read more: check out our hands-on Google Pixel Watch 4 review\n7. The Pixel Buds Pro 2's upgrades are also coming to the current model\nLoyal Google Pixel Buds owners will know that the Pixel Buds Pro 2 have been around since August 2024, but Google is rolling out a significant upgrade to its still-current flagship earbuds \u2013 and there\u2019s a new color option, Moonstone, to match the Google Pixel 10 phone lineup.\nThe best part? All of the improvements (other than the new color, of course \u2013 you\u2019d have to buy a new set to get that) will be delivered to existing Pixel Buds Pro 2 users via a free software update.\nFrom September 2025, Pixel Buds Pro 2 will gain Adaptive Audio (Google-speak for adaptive noise cancelling) which aims to reduce extraneous noise and the impact of ambient sounds in your immediate vicinity, but without totally removing your situational awareness. This will arrive alongside Loud Noise Protection, a decidedly AirPods Pro 2-style perk that should quickly shut down unpredicted and blaringly-loud noise.\nAlso slated to land in September for the Pixel Buds Pro 2 is head gesture control, for picking up calls and replying to texts hands-free, plus improved audio processing for using Gemini in noisier environments.\nFinally, they'll also gain Live with Gemini support (think natural-feeling conversations with Google\u2019s latest AI assistant), plus useful notifications about the remaining battery level within the earbuds' case, so you need never get caught without enough juice ever again.\n8. Google's budget earbuds also got a welcome upgrade\nAlongside a slew of updates that will arrive via a free software update for the flagship Pixel Buds Pro 2, Google\u2019s also finally updating its affordable earbuds. Yes, that means a new A-series entry, more specifically the Google Pixel Buds 2a.\nThese earbuds are more compact and less bulky than the Buds Pro 2, but also have the twist-to-lock stabilizer for getting a comfortable ear fit. These also usher in active noise cancellation and a transparency mode for the first time to the A-Series, thanks to the new Tensor A1 chip \u2013 and Google promises their feature set will be as good as the original Pixel Buds Pro.\nYou also get long battery life, Gemini in your ears \u2013 well, via your linked Pixel phone \u2013 and support for Spatial Audio. Best of all, these start at $129 and could be a compelling option depending on how they perform.\n- Read more: take a look at our ears-and-hands-on Google Pixel Buds 2a review\n9. Replaceable batteries are finally becoming more common\nWhile the Pixel 10, the Pixel 10 Pros, and the Fold didn\u2019t receive a callout for repairability, the Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Buds 2a both did. On the earbuds, not only are the affordable earbuds case much more compact (they're seriously palm-able) their battery is also replaceable.\nSimilarly, the Pixel Watch 4 might look similar, but it now features screws on the side that make it much more repairable, giving you the option to replace the display and battery parts (depending on the region you're in). That's arguably a bigger deal than the new curved Actua display and an example we hope Apple, Samsung and Garmin will follow.\n10. Gemini has some handy new AI tricks\nIt wouldn't be a Google event without some flashy new AI features, and this year's Pixel launch delivered again with some smart new Gemini tricks.\nFirstly, Gemini Live \u2013 Google's natural language voice conversation mode \u2013 is even easier to use on the Pixel 10 thanks to new Visual Overlays, which will highlight on your screen what Gemini is talking about.\nThe Pixel 10 series also have Magic Cue, which lives in your Daily Hub and will apparently proactively help you with chores that are mentioned in your emails or messages \u2013 for example, restaurant reservations or booking Airbnbs.\nIf you get stuck with a technical issue on your Pixel 10, there's also an on-device, AI-powered agent to help you troubleshoot issues, while a new Voice Translate feature in the Google Phone app can translate your call in real-time.\nWith the likes of Camera Coach and Pixel Journal (Google's answer to Apple's Journal app) also on board, there's lots of new Gemini-powered fun to play with \u2013 and with a year of free Google AI Pro coming with all Pixel 10 purchases, you'll have plenty of time to try them all.\n11. Fitbit\u2019s Gemini-powered AI Coach will roll out in October\nStarting from October in the US, and presumably rolling out to other regions in due course, Fitbit users will be getting a long-promised AI fitness coach.\nDescribed as the equivalent of \u201ca whole panel of experts delivering personalized insights on all walks of life\u201d and specializing in \u201cworld-class fitness tools\u201d, the advice will cover sleep, workouts, recovery and a general \u201chealth and wellness advisor\u201d service.\nNot much is known about the tool at this stage, as unlike most of the other new features, there was no demonstration on how it\u2019s going to be used in action. However, based on the use of the term \u201cadvisor\u201d, we could theorize that it\u2019ll be similar to the Oura Advisor service on the Oura Ring, an AI chatbot that uses contextual information from your fitness tracker to answer personal questions about your health, doing all its processing on-device for privacy.\nThe only other two things we do know about the service is that it\u2019ll be backed by science, and it boasts NBA all-star Stephen Curry as a \u201cperformance advisor\u201d of sorts, whatever that means.\n12. Google couldn't wait to throw shade at Apple\nGoogle is no stranger to subtle digs at Apple, but this year\u2019s Made by Google event saw it give Tim Cook et al several sharp jabs in the ribs. Firstly, Google\u2019s head of devices Rick Osterloh noted that there have been \u201ca lot of broken promises\u201d when it comes to launching AI smartphone features. Hey Siri, what could that possibly be referencing?\nBut that wasn\u2019t the only unsubtle call-out. On the subject of RCS messaging (which Apple now supports), Google\u2019s Vice president of marketing Adrienne Lofton said: \u201cThe green-blue bubble battle is silly and it\u2019s tired, and at Google we\u2019re done with that conversation\u201d. Say what you really mean, Google.\nWith the later Pixelsnap segment talking of \u201cwalled gardens\u201d and companies that lock you into their accessories, the event\u2019s friendly tone was laced with a barely-concealed contempt for Apple. The \u2018Android vs iPhone\u2019 battle just got even spicier.\n13. The Pixel Watch 4 has first-of-their-kind fitness and emergency tools\nWhile the Pixel Watch 4 only got a brief showing during the Made by Google presentation, in which Peloton\u2019s Cody Rigsby took it for a spin during a brief workout, we got a glimpse of some of the watch\u2019s new features.\nIt was offhandedly mentioned that the Pixel Watch 4 was \u201cas accurate as a chest strap\u201d for monitoring your heart rate, an impressive feat for a wrist-mounted fitness watch \u2013 although no statistics were presented to verify this.\nThe Pixel Watch 4 can also turn a Pixel phone into a simple cycling computer to display stats during cycling workouts, and boasts impressive-looking activity recognition similar to a WHOOP band. If your watch knows you play soccer on Sundays, it should automatically recognize when you start your workout, and also realize that it\u2019s your regular soccer game.\nAnother first-of-its-kind feature highlighted during the presentation was the watch\u2019s off-grid satellite connectivity, capable of activating its emergency service alerts without using your phone\u2019s data.\nYou might also like\nJacob Krol is the US Managing Editor, News for TechRadar.

Learn more.\nAndroid finally lets you control your Pixel phone's flashlight brightness\n12 hours ago\n- Android has finally added native flashlight brightness controls from the Quick Settings panel.\n- Google added support for controlling the flashlight brightness in Android 13, but there was no way to do so from Quick Settings.\n- This feature is available in the latest August 2025 Android Canary release and may arrive in Android 16 QPR2.\nIf you\u2019re looking for something under a couch, bed, or other dimly lit area, then your phone\u2019s built-in flashlight will come in handy. Nearly every phone has one, including every Google Pixel device. Unlike other devices, though, Pixels don\u2019t let you adjust the brightness of the flashlight from the Quick Settings panel. That\u2019s thankfully changed in the new August 2025 Android Canary release that Googel rolled out today.\nDon\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority?\n- Set us as a preferred source in Google Search to support us and make sure you never miss our latest exclusive reports, expert analysis, and much more.\nAfter installing the new Canary release, I noticed that the flashlight tile was now expandable. Tapping it opened a dialog named \u201cFlashlight Strength\u201d that had a slider and buttons to turn off the flashlight or confirm the brightness level.\nThe feature works exactly as you\u2019d expect. Higher levels boost the intensity of the flashlight, while lower levels dim the intensity. Newer Pixel phones default to 50% brightness when the flashlight is toggled from the Quick Settings, so it\u2019s nice to have the ability to quickly adjust the intensity.\nPreviously, in order to adjust the flashlight brightness on a Pixel phone, you had to use a separate app like FlashDim or Google\u2019s Magnifier. This is because while Google added an API for controlling the flashlight brightness way back in Android 13, the company didn\u2019t utilize this for the Quick Setting tile.\nWe first heard of this feature back in June, so we\u2019re not too surprised to see it in the latest Canary release. That being said, we don\u2019t know when this feature will actually roll out in the stable channel. Our guess is that it\u2019ll appear in a future beta release of Android 16 QPR2 before rolling out with the stable release in December.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Android 13 is here: new features, supported phones, all you need to know\nAndroid 13 'Tiramisu' was announced at Google IO 2022 and released in August a few months later, showcasing refinements in its design, improvements to notifications, and more.\nGoogle had been focusing on security for this year's keynote, and Android 13 applies the same focus, with a shoutout to RCS, a text messaging standard, and wallet improvements.\nThe finished Android 13 version launched on August 15 2022, and you can see if your device is eligible by going to the Android beta webpage. With the debut of the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro, these devices bring some showcasing features to Android 13, such as unblurring photos.\nBelow, you'll find details of all the key features of Android 13, along with which devices will be compatible with it.\nAndroid 13 release date\nAndroid 13 arrived in August 2022, with Google announcing the sudden availability of it for its Pixel phones, much sooner than previous Android releases.\nWhile Android 12 landed in October 2021, the previous two Android versions landed in September of their release years.\nIt had been named in some Google security update notes, which mentioned that Android 13 would run the September 2022 security patch by default. Given that Google releases these patches monthly, that in itself suggested a September launch for Android 13, but it turns out we were a month early in expecting its arrival.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nWith Pixel 7 and 7 Pro having debuted at a Google event back in October 2022, Android 13 is already loaded onto these devices, ready to go.\nAndroid 13 supported devices\nAndroid has a reputation for not making it easy to update your phone to the latest version. Part of it is due to the different manufacturers on how they have designed Android to match a brand, such as Samsung.\nBut with Google releasing a new Pixel phone every year, these usually come with the latest Android version. Indeed, Google confirmed that the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro will run Android 13 at its event announcing both devices, alongside the Pixel Watch.\nThe Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro also support Android 13, as do older models from at least the Pixel 4 onwards, as they all supported the beta too during the summer.\nThese were the first devices to get Android 13, but other manufacturers are due to follow after a few weeks or months of testing and putting their own spin on the new Android release, but in many cases these phones likely won't get Android 13 until the first half of 2023.\nAndroid 13 features\nThere's plenty of refinements for Material You, Android's theme in Android 13, with music controls on your lock screen to adapt to the colors you've chosen, alongside a bigger focus on security.\nEarthquake warnings are being improved, with full-screen alerts to better describe the situation alongside useful ways to get to safety. There are also a few other significant features, detailed below.\nHanding off\nWe were hoping that Google would be inspired from Apple's Handoff feature, and it looks as though our wish was heard.\nYou can hand off your images and media to a Google product, or an Android tablet. There's also 'Fast Pair', which can better pair your devices together in a much quicker way.\nGoogle Wallet\nGoogle Wallet is a redesign of Google Pay, where it stores your payment cards, alongside event tickets, parking passes, vaccine cards, health insurance cards, flight passes, and lots more.\nIt's the one-stop shop for Android 13 users, with the aim to replace the wallet that you've been carrying around your pocket for years.\nThere's also plans for a digital driver's license in the US, debuting later in 2022.\nGoogle also announced a focus for Android 13 is being tailored for tablets and foldable devices, which could hint toward a Pixel Fold.\nDaryl had been freelancing for 3 years before joining TechRadar, now reporting on everything software-related.

      "text": "The best iPhone for you will depend on what you value most in a smartphone. We've reviewed every iPhone released since 2007 (that's 46 models and counting), so we can confidently say that you don't necessarily need to buy the most expensive model to get the best experience with Apple's ubiquitous smartphones.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max is, of course, the obvious choice for power users, but the standard iPhone 16 is a better option for those who prefer smaller phones. The iPhone 15, meanwhile, continues to rank as the best-value iPhone, while the newly announced iPhone 16e is the outright cheapest model.\nThe iPhone 17 series is tipped to land on September 9, so if you're in the market for a new iPhone, we'd suggest waiting until next month (if you can) before making a decision on which model to buy. Even if you're not fussed about owning the latest iPhone, the new line's arrival will likely drive the price of existing models down.\nBelow, we've selected the best iPhones for every use case, comparing key factors such as price, performance, cameras, and battery life to help you find a model that meets your needs. We've tested over 1,000 phones since 2005, so you can be confident that our recommendations are based on expert knowledge, in-depth analysis, and intelligent comparisons between devices.\nOnce you're set on a model, check out our best iPhone deals and Apple coupon codes pages for a roundup of the latest discounts. And for a look into the future, head to our iPhone 17 rumors hub.\nQuick list\nBest overall\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max is the best Apple phone you can buy today. Its combination of an A18 Pro chipset, a great camera suite, and Apple Intelligence compatibility make it a potent flagship handset, though the smaller iPhone 16 Pro is equally impressive.\nRead more below\nBest for most people\nAll things considered, the iPhone 16 is the best all-round iPhone on the market right now thanks to its compact size, A18 chipset, excellent cameras, and future-proof software compatibility.\nRead more below\nBest value\nApple's base 2023 model may lack the bells and whistles of its newer stablemates, but the iPhone 15 is still fast, compact, and photographer-friendly. With USB-C connectivity and the Dynamic Island, it's a very complete iPhone for a compelling price.\nRead more below\nBest budget\nIf you're happy to forgo some niceties like the Dynamic Island and MagSafe, the iPhone 16e is an excellent iPhone entry-point thanks to its top-tier screen and powerful performance.\nRead more below\nBest battery life\nThe iPhone 16 Plus is the model to go for if battery life is your number one priority. The 16 Pro Max offers comparable endurance, but as a value proposition, the 16 Plus has it beat.\nRead more below\nI'm TechRadar's Phones Editor, and have been reviewing and writing about the best mobile devices (iPhones included) for several years. Based in the UK, I handle news and feature coverage for the phones section of the site, and regularly edit TechRadar's phones-related reviews and buying guides. You'll find my byline on over 1,500 TechRadar articles.\nThe best iPhone in 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe best iPhone overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you want the very best iPhone money can buy right now, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is the model to go for. The iPhone 15 Pro Max was already (and still is) an exceptional handset, but Apple's latest flagship comes with a bigger screen, a more powerful chipset, a superior telephoto camera, a new Camera Control button, and Apple Intelligence compatibility.\nApple is pitching the latter of those features as the biggest selling point of the iPhone 16 Pro Max, and while Apple Intelligence endured a rocky start to life, it's beginning to take shape, with more Apple Intelligence features on the way, too.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max is powered by the A18 Pro chipset, which, according to our benchmark tests, is the most powerful chipset Apple has ever produced. In fact, the A18 Pro bested the results of all of the Android phone chipsets we tested in 2024, so the 16 Pro Max is a truly market-leading handset.\nAll that power makes scrolling, streaming, gaming, and productivity tasks a breeze on the iPhone 16 Pro Max, while the phone's gorgeous 6.8-inch Super XDR OLED display (with ProMotion) is the biggest and best iPhone screen, well, ever.\nOn the camera front, the iPhone 16 Pro Max boasts a 48MP quad-pixel main lens, a 48MP ultra-wide lens (the first on an iPhone), and a 12MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom (even more zoom would've been nice, but perhaps that's being greedy). Apple's new flagship also achieved a record-setting 16 hours of battery life in our testing, which is a figure rivaled only by the iPhone 16 Plus.\nIt's worth noting that the 6.3-inch iPhone 16 Pro is exactly the same phone as the iPhone 16 Pro Max, but smaller and cheaper. So, if you're not fussed about owning the biggest iPhone, we'd advise going for that model instead.\nRead our full iPhone 16 Pro Max review\nThe best iPhone for most people\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you're not fussed about the larger size, faster refresh rate, and telephoto camera capabilities of Apple's more expensive Pro models, the standard iPhone 16 is an excellent all-round iPhone that we consider to be the best iPhone for most people.\nThe iPhone 15 (below) is still our pick as the best-value iPhone given its cheaper price, but the iPhone 16's compatibility with Apple Intelligence means that it won't become outmoded as quickly as Apple's 2023 base model.\nOf course, the iPhone 16 brings more than just software upgrades. In addition to the Action button inherited from the iPhone 15 Pro, the iPhone 16 gets an all-new Camera Control button, which can be used as a traditional shutter button or as a capacitive button that lets you zoom and adjust exposure, as well as a superfast A18 chipset, a larger battery and a faster 45W charging speed than the iPhone 15.\nThe iPhone 16's 48MP wide and 12MP ultra-wide cameras are impressive, but if you want truly exceptional zoom capabilities, you're better off going for the iPhone 16 Pro (or indeed the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra or Pixel 9 Pro).\nAs for the iPhone 16's display, you'll get a stunning 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED screen that we found offers punchy colors and stark contrast points, though as alluded to above, you'll have to go for the pricier iPhone 16 Pro to benefit from Apple's ProMotion (i.e. 120Hz refresh rate) technology. For a spec-by-spec comparison of the two models, check out our iPhone 16 vs iPhone 16 Pro explainer.\nRead our full iPhone 16 review\nThe best value iPhone\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDespite the arrival of the iPhone 16 series, we still consider the standard iPhone 15 to be the best-value iPhone in 2025. What it lacks in titanium sides, 120Hz scrolling, or high-spec zoom photography, the standard iPhone 15 more than makes up for in performance and portability.\nFor just $699 / \u00a3699 / AU$1,249 from Apple directly, you get a 6.1-inch Super XDR OLED display, a fast A16 Bionic chipset, a USB-C port, a supremely capable 48MP main camera, and Apple\u2019s smart digital screen cut-out, the Dynamic Island, all delivered in a sleek and eye-catching design package.\nYou do lose out on Apple Intelligence compatibility with the iPhone 15, so if you're ready to embrace smartphone AI and want a future-proof pocket companion, the iPhone 16 is the better buy. However, if you're simply looking for a speedy, long-lasting, and eye-catching iPhone to see you through the next three or four years, the iPhone 15 is an excellent choice.\nFor a spec-by-spec comparison of the two models, check out our iPhone 16 vs iPhone 15 explainer.\nRead our full iPhone 15 review\nThe best budget iPhone\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFollowing the launch of the iPhone 16e in February 2025, Apple discontinued both the iPhone SE (2022) and the iPhone 14, meaning the company's new entry-level iPhone 16 model is now the cheapest iPhone available as new.\nThe iPhone 16e brings several key upgrades over the iPhone SE (2022), including a 48MP main camera, a more powerful chipset, a longer-lasting battery, and Apple Intelligence compatibility. You'll have to make do with a physical notch instead of the Dynamic Island, and there's no MagSafe compatibility to speak of here, but the iPhone 16e is, after all, intended to be a no-frills model.\nIf you're looking for more bells and whistles, go for an iPhone 15 or an iPhone 16 (to see how the iPhone 16e stacks up against those more expensive models, check out our iPhone 16e vs iPhone 15 and iPhone 16e vs iPhone 16 comparisons), but put simply, this is the best budget iPhone available in 2025.\nRead our full iPhone 16e review\nThe best iPhone for battery life\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe iPhone 16 Plus takes everything great about the standard iPhone 16 and supersizes it, meaning this is the handset to go for if you prefer a larger iPhone but don't want to spend big on the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max.\nThis year's model gets all the same benefits as the standard iPhone 16 \u2013 the Action button, the Camera Control button, Apple Intelligence compatibility, and so on \u2013 but the Plus also benefits from battery life that pretty much wipes the floor with its comparatively priced competition.\nIn our testing, the iPhone 16 Plus lasted a whopping 16 hours and 29 minutes; that's endurance to rival the iPhone 16 Pro Max. So, if battery life is your number one priority, we'd recommend going for this phone over the iPhone 16 Pro Max and saving yourself $300 / \u00a3300 / AU$550 (if you don't care about ProMotion, that is).\nRead our full iPhone 16 Plus review\nFAQs\nWhat is the best iPhone?\nThe best iPhone is usually one of the latest numbered models, but the value of each will depend on your specific needs. If you want a big screen, go for a Pro Max (the latest and greatest is the iPhone 16 Pro Max). For top specs in a smaller size, pick a Pro, and if you want to save some money, then get a standard model or the iPhone 16e.\nWhich iPhone is the best value for money?\nRight now, the iPhone that offers the best value for money is the iPhone 15, although the iPhone 16 is the more money-savvy choice if you're keen to use Apple Intelligence features. The iPhone 16e, meanwhile, is the outright cheapest iPhone, so go for that if you're simply looking for the most inexpensive option.\nHow to choose the best iPhone?\nA lot of iPhones are quite similar to one another, so choosing which model to buy mostly just means seeing what's different between them and finding the right fit for you.\nAll iPhones are powerful, and Apple supports them for a long time, so age and chipset needn't be a big deal, but if you don't plan on upgrading for a long time, then a newer model with a faster chipset is ideal.\nBigger factors, though, include the screen size \u2013 and bigger isn't always better. If you want something compact that you can easily slip into a small pocket, then consider Apple's 6.1-inch models. But if you plan on doing a lot of gaming or video-watching, something larger would be better.\nResolution and refresh rate are also worth paying attention to for the optimal visual experience \u2013 the higher the better in both cases, so ideal options will have things like a 120Hz refresh rate and a resolution above 1080p.\nCamera quality and battery life are important considerations, too, and you can't get a full picture of these just from a specs list, so read our full entries above (or click through to our detailed reviews) for insights into how each iPhone fares in those departments.\nHow we test\nWe've reviewed every iPhone on this list, meaning for each, we've passed our expert judgment on them after extensive testing. These reviews saw us use each phone as our main handset for at least a week, and often longer.\nIn the process, we would explore various use cases, including calls, texts, social media, video streaming, gaming, taking photos, and more, with some heavy use days and other lighter ones.\nIn short, we use our iPhones just like you would \u2013 but we make sure to test every key feature, as well as run benchmark tests, checking how long they take to charge, and more.\nUsing that data, we've then ranked each handset, factoring in price, value, and how they compare to one another, with a particular focus on their screens, designs, battery life, performance, and cameras.\n- You've reached the end of the page.
