Trainers noticed that during Romulus and Khaleesi's time together, Khaleesi darted towards a stack of logs in the habitat and climbed under them when her brother started chasing her. This was likely a safety precaution Khaleesi took to feel more comfortable and in control around her larger brother.\n\n\"She's a really smart little dire wolf,\" says the trainer featured in the footage. \"She's small enough that she can make it under some of the logs, and Romulus couldn't, so that helped her control the interactions.\"\n\nAfter some time under the logs, Khaleesi comes back out to continue playing with her brother; occasionally returning to the logs when she wants a safe space.\n\nIn the footage, the trainer also notes that the wolves\u2019 ears were \u201cup the entire time\u201d during their play session, a good sign indicating comfort and happiness.\n\nOnce Khaleesi got to know Romulus, she was introduced to Remus. The trainer notes in the video that both the dire wolves were excited to meet and that Remus was more gentle with his sister than Romulus.\n\nAfter two successful meetings, all three of the dire wolves were able to play together.\n\n\"From here on out, we are going to alternate introducing her to one brother,\" says the trainer in the clip. \"So, like, one day she'll get to hang out and play with Remus, and the next day it'll be Romulus. And we'll just alternate over and over, to give her a sense of confidence.\"\n\n\"We want her to feel like she's controlling all of her interactions with them. So we're going with a cautious approach,\" they add.\n\nOnce Khaleesi grows slightly larger, Colossal Biosciences will consider housing the three dire wolves together, but only if the animals appear confident and comfortable with each other.\n\n\"We want to make sure that nobody is injured, no one is scared,\" the trainer explains.\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nColossal Biosciences first announced the arrival of the three dire wolves back in April, in a statement from CEO and co-founder Ben Lamm.\n\n\"Our team took DNA from a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old skull and made healthy dire wolf puppies,\" said Lamm at the time. \"It was once said, 'Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.'

      "text": "Joe Manganiello Has 'Seen the Future' After Dire Wolves Are Brought Back: 'Lifelong Obsession' (Exclusive) \"This is a part of our evolution, I believe, as a planet,\" the actor and investor tells PEOPLE By Lizzie Hyman Lizzie Hyman Lizzie Hyman is a Writer-Reporter for PEOPLE, where she contributes in-depth features and covers entertainment and news across both print and digital platforms. People Editorial Guidelines Published on April 8, 2025 01:18PM EDT 1 Comment Colossal Biosciences says gene-editing technology helped it essentially revive the extinct dire wolves famously seen in Game of ThronesThe company's headline-grabbing work has attracted a range of supporters, including celebrities Joe Manganiello\"With Colossal\u2019s work to protect and conserve the environment, it would be unethical not to support them,\" Manganiello tells PEOPLE Dire wolves have made a prehistoric comeback \u2014 more or less \u2014 all thanks to a leading genetics company. The canine, last seen in the real world nearly 13,000 years ago and made famous through Game of Thrones, has essentially been brought back from extinction, according to Colossal Biosciences, which recently created modified gray wolves that have the characteristics of dire wolves. For actor Joe Manganiello (no stranger to wolves himself) and the team at Colossal, learning about the legendary animals and how to care for them has been quite the wild ride. \u201cGiven some of our proprietary extraction tools and technologies, we knew about some aspects of the dire wolf, but we didn\u2019t know it had an arctic-like fur and that its tail is thick like a fox,\u201d Ben Lamm, Colossal's CEO, tells PEOPLE. The company says it uses gene editing to modify the traits of existing animals as part of its de-extinction project \u2014 not quite Jurassic Park, but close enough. In the case of the dire wolves, the Colossal scientists relied on DNA from a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old skull in order to better understand what made up the animals' DNA. Then, through gene editing, they birthed modified gray wolves that are, in effect, like modern-day dire wolves. The result? Romulus, Remus and Khalessi, yes, a nod to Thrones \u2014 three young dire wolves now living in a nature preserve in North America who carry the traits of these long-lost giant canines. Courtesy of Colossal Biosciences Colossal Bioscience's Ben Lamm (left) and Joe Manganiello with the dire wolf puppies. Courtesy of Colossal Biosciences Caring for a species that hasn\u2019t existed in thousands of years took time and a team of experts. \u201cI have a fortunate, really experienced team that has worked with everything from critically endangered elephants and lions and tigers to the Perdido Key mouse to the Hawaiian kingfisher,\u201d Matt James, the chief animal officer at Colossal, tells PEOPLE. He adds, \u201cThey bring a wealth of knowledge, and we extrapolate everything we know about close living relatives. In the case of the dire wolf, that's the gray wolf. ... We wrote a 165-page document that outlines how you care for a dire wolf, covering everything from what they eat to how much space they require to learning how you manage social groups of a species that's never been studied.\" One of the 'World's Rarest' Fish, Thought to Be Extinct, Rediscovered After 85 Years The project has garnered notable support, including from Manganiello, 48, and, in the past, Tom Brady \u2014 adding an extra layer of excitement to this endeavor. \u201cI've had a lifelong obsession with biology and genetics. It\u2019s a bit of a hobby of mine,\u201d Manganiello shares, explaining his interest in extinct species. \u201cBecause of that obsession, mixed with the fact that, yes, I played a werewolf for many years, I was contacted by Ben Lamm at Colossal,\" the actor continues. \"We talked, and then I was invited to the laboratory in Dallas and then from there, I was invited to invest and actually join the board of advisors.\" \"So I got to meet [co-founder] George Church and hold an 11,000-year-old apex predator,\" Manganiello says. \"I mean, come on. There is no bucket list for things like this.\u201d Courtesy of Colossal Biosciences Despite the excitement, Manganiello acknowledges some public concerns about attempting to bring back extinct species. But he insists the team at Colossal \u2014 certified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the American Humane Society \u2014 are \u201cthe good guys.\u201d \u201cOne of the beautiful things about the dire wolf ... is that it was done 100% cleanly and successfully,\u201d Manganiello says. (Colossal has been working with other species and recently unveiled the woolly mouse.) The former True Blood star adds, \u201cI know that there's the question of playing God, and just because we can do it, should we?\" But \"the fact is, because of the choices we've made as a society, we are eradicating our environment at a global scale, and at a rate that needs to be slowed,\" he says. \"With Colossal\u2019s work to protect and conserve the environment, it would be unethical not to support them. They are the good guys, and this is a part of our evolution, I believe, as a planet.\u201d Joe Manganiello Reveals the Graphic NSFW Gift He Once Received from a True Blood Fan: 'They F---ed' Courtesy of Colossal Biosciences It\u2019s hard to believe how far Colossal has come, according to some of its leaders. \u201cJust three and a half years ago, I was sitting in a bar in Dallas with Ben talking about this concept. Eighteen months ago, we decided we should create a dire wolf. Now, we\u2019re talking about dire wolves that already exist. I mean, it\u2019s hard for me to wrap my head around,\u201d says James, the chief animal officer. \u201cAnd,\" says Lamm, \"we\u2019re just getting started.\u201d Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. For Manganiello, the so-called de-extinction process \u2014 and its broader implications \u2014 has reshaped his perspective on life. \u201cUnlimited drinking water, the eradication of plastics, the cure for cancer and the end of genetic disorders \u2026 all of that is far more important than anything else I think about during my day,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the future. How can I think about anything else now?\u201d Leave a Comment Read more: Human Interest Animals Pets"

      "text": "Dire Wolves Brought Back from Extinction Have More Than Doubled in Size in Just 6 Months Colossal Biosciences shared a progress update on the world's first new dire wolves \u2014 Romulus, Remus, and Khaleesi \u2014 since the species went extinct By Mon\u00e1 Thomas Published on July 6, 2025 04:45PM EDT 26 Comments Revived Direwolves created by Colossal Biosciences. Credit : Courtesy of Colossal Biosciences NEED TO KNOW Colossal Biosciences shared a growth update on the world's first \"de-extinct\" dire wolvesMale pups Romulus and Remus weigh over 90 pounds at six months, outgrowing standard gray wolvesSlightly younger female pup, Khalessi, currently weighs 35 pounds and will likely join Romulus and Remus' pack soon The world's first revived dire wolves are growing up, and fast. The three dire wolves, two males named Remus and Romulus and one female named Khaleesi, are showcased in a six-month growth report from Colossal Biosciences, published on June 20. Colossal brought back the species as part of its ongoing de-extinction project. Matt James, Colossal's Chief Animal Officer, shared in the update video that the project is going to plan, with the new dire wolf pups hitting all their milestones. Romulus and Remus are preparing for their first annual vet appointments. The medical check-ins are exciting and necessary for the Colossal team, as they provide an opportunity to draw blood from the dire wolves and perform CT imaging, which will grant the team a more in-depth picture of what is happening with the animal's skeletal and muscular systems. \"Today, Romulus and Remus, at a little over six months old, weigh a little more than 90 pounds, which is about 20% larger than a standard gray wolf,\" James shared in the video update. \"So we can really tell that the dire wolf genes are kicking in and we're getting these nice large wolves that are much more representative of what we see in the ancient specimens.\" The two male dire wolves are well over double the size of the pups the public first met when Colossal introduced the animals in April. Romulus and Remus. Khaleesi, who James noted is a bit younger (about three months old) and more petite than her brothers, currently weighs around 35 pounds, making her roughly 15% to 20% larger than a standard gray wolf at that age. According to Paige McNickle, who manages the dire wolves\u2019 daily care team, Remus has begun to take on the role as leader of the pack, and Romulus is effectively \u201cstepping down and being more subordinate.\u201d \u201cRemus really likes to watch things, and he figures stuff out,\u201d explained McNickle. \u201cHe\u2019s also a little bit smaller, so sometimes that\u2019s interesting to think that the smaller of the two would be the more dominant. But he\u2019s crafty and he\u2019s always watching.\u201d Romulus, whom McNickle described as \"the beta,\" likes to go out first when the dire wolves eat and play, which McNickle called \"very much a beta trait,\" since it allows pack leaders to lead from the back. \"It may not stay that way as they continue to grow up,\" McNickle added. \"That may change. It could change when we add Khaleesi into the mix. As they're still young, that pack dynamic isn't set. It's still very fluid.\" As for the dire wolves' eating habits, McNickles reported that the animals are eating adult-sized portions of high-quality dog kibble, ground meat, and organ meats. Romulus and Remus. As the animals get older, McNickle confirmed, they'll be given whole prey items to assist in nurturing \"their abilities and instincts\" of eating in the wild. For now, Khalessi is being kept separate from Remus and Romulus and will join the pack as soon as she's big enough to do so safely. In the meantime, the animals can see and smell each other through a gate, to give the team an idea of the collective temperament. \"Before we make the introduction of bringing Khaleesi into the group with the boys, we're going to be looking for really strong indicators that they are socially compatible,\" explained James. \"We're really excited about that.\" Romulus and Remus. Following their de-extinction of the woolly mouse, Colossal announced the arrival of its dire wolves in a statement on Monday, April 7. \"Our team took DNA from a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old skull and made healthy dire wolf puppies,\" Colossal CEO and co-founder Ben Lamm said at the time. \"It was once said, 'Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.'

It's a bit of a hobby of mine,\" shared Manganiello. \"Because of that obsession, mixed with the fact that, yes, I played a werewolf for many years, I was contacted by Ben Lamm at Colossal.\" Although he acknowledged understanding the public's mistrust of Colossal's de-extinction science, Manganiello expressed his support for Lamm and the company following his lab visit. \"One of the beautiful things about the dire wolf ... is that it was done 100% cleanly and successfully,\" the Deal or No Deal Island host shared.
