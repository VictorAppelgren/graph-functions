  "description": "Looking for some new Android wallpapers? Here's the Android Authority Wallpaper Wednesday roundup for August 13, 2025.",
  "content": "Welcome to Wallpaper Wednesday! In this weekly roundup, we\u2019ll give you a handful of Android wallpapers you can download and use on your phone, tablet, or even your laptop/PC. The images will come from folks here at Android Authority as well as our readers. All are free to use and come without watermarks. File formats are JPG and PNG, and we\u2019ll provide images in both landscape and portrait modes, so they\u2019ll be optimized for various screens.\n\nFor the newest walls as well as all the ones from previous weeks, check out this Drive link. Want to submit your own? Head to the bottom of this article.\n\nAnother week, another set of awesome Android wallpapers for you to share! Remember that we are always looking for submissions from our readers. Head to the bottom of this article to find out how you could have one of your images featured in an upcoming Wallpaper Wednesday!\n\nWith that in mind, we\u2019ve got six awesome images from our readers that would look great on your phone, tablet, or PC. As usual, we also have three images from the Android Authority team.\n\nFirst, we have a photo of a sunset over some water. That comes from a special Android Authority reader: Adamya Sharma\u2019s mom! After that, we have a low-color photo of a field in Poland. That comes from reader Maciej Sulima, who used a Google Pixel 9 Pro for the capture! Next, we have a shot of a flower with a tiny little bug crawling around. That comes from reader (and frequent contributor) Kaustav Pramanik! After that, we have a photo proving that all it takes for a good wallpaper photo is a little creativity. Pasquale Freda sent over a closeup of a rock wall in Acadia National Park, photographed with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra! Next, we have a cool shot of a building in the morning sunlight from reader Thariq, who used a Nothing Phone 2 for the capture! Finally, we have a terrific photo of some flowers. That one was shot in Chennai with a Nothing Phone 3a, and comes from reader Sowmith Rajkumar. Thanks so much for your submissions, all!\n\nFrom the Android Authority team, we have a great photo of a very green insect from Tushar Mehta. We also have a pic of a\u2026uhhhh\u2026very motivational sign from Rita El Khoury. Finally, we have a great shot of a building from Zac Kew-Denniss.\n\nHow to submit your own Android wallpapers We are very excited to see your own contributions to our Wallpaper Wednesdays project. Before submitting, here are the rules:\n\u2022 Your submissions should be your own creation. That means photos you took, digital art you created, etc. Please don\u2019t submit other people\u2019s work \u2014 that\u2019s just not cool. Also, please don\u2019t send images purely created with AI. They will not be accepted. Images you created and then augmented with AI tools are OK.\n\u2022 You must agree to let Android Authority share your Android wallpapers for free with anyone who wants them.\n\u2022 We will not accept watermarked images. You will, however, get a credit and a link in the article itself. We can link to your social media account only. Ready to submit? Fill out the form below. You\u2019ll need to include the highest-resolution version of the image you can provide, your name, and a brief description of what the image is. If you want us to link to a social media page you own in your credit, please provide that, too, but that\u2019s optional.",

      "text": "Rita El Khoury\nRita is a seasoned tech journalist based in Paris who lives and breathes all things Android. She started writing about smartphones in 2007, and it\u2019s been a love affair ever since. From Symbian to Windows Mobile, Blackberry OS, and iOS, Rita has seen it all, but Android\u2019s versatility won her over from the moment she flashed her first custom ROM on her HTC Desire Z. She has spent over a decade testing and writing about Android ROMs, apps, games, and services, as well as covering and breaking the latest Android news, first for Android Police and later at Android Authority.\nWhen she\u2019s not busy attending product launches and trade shows like CES, MWC, and IFA, or guest-appearing on various tech podcasts, Rita can be found using the latest phones, wearables, smart home products, and other random gadgets. She is renowned for her expert opinions shared on Android Authority via reviews, commentaries, and experiential features. As Senior Features Editor, she also works with a team of writers to help them craft creative content, share their experiences with the latest smartphones and gadgets, and compare and contrast devices and services.\nRita\u2019s current gadget lineup includes the latest and greatest from Google \u2014 a Pixel 9 Pro XL, Pixel Buds Pro 2, Pixel Watch 3, and Pixel Tablet. She uses an Apple M1 iMac for work and an M3 MacBook on the go. She also loves to kick back and relax with some rock music and Eurovision songs on her Nest Audio speakers, plan her next travel adventure on her iPad Mini 2024, or catch a Real Madrid game on her Google TV Streamer.\nOtherwise, she\u2019ll be chilling in her home, enjoying her Hue bulbs, Roborock vacuums (there are three of them!), Ajax security system, and Tado thermostat. There\u2019s a Home Assistant project lurking in the background, too.\nIf you ever meet her, don\u2019t be shy to say Hi, Hola, Bonjour, or Marhaba!"

Learn more.\nNothing Phone 2 review: Should you buy it?\nJuly 13, 2023\nNothing Phone 2\nWhat we like\nWhat we don't like\nNothing Phone 2\nNothing Phone 2 review: At a glance\n- What is it? The Nothing Phone 2 is the sophomore Android phone from the London startup brand led by OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei, and the first to be made available to buy in North America. Following on from the warm reception of the Phone 1, the Nothing Phone 2 sticks with the signature Glyph lighting and transparent design while pushing performance to the next level with a high-end Snapdragon 8 series processor and making further refinements that elevate it from the mid-range to affordable flagship status.\n- What is the price? The Nothing Phone 2 is priced at $599 for the base model (8GB/128GB) in the US, with higher-spec variants retailing for $699 (12GB/256GB) and $799 (12GB/512GB). The Nothing Phone 2 starts at \u00a3579 in the UK, \u20ac679 in other European regions, and CAD$929 in Canada.\n- Where can you buy it? Pre-orders for the Nothing Phone 2 started on July 11 on Nothing's online store. General availability begins on July 17.\n- How did we test it? I tested the Nothing Phone 2 for seven days. The review unit was supplied by Nothing.\n- Is it worth it? The Nothing Phone 2 enters a North American smartphone market starved of affordable flagship phones not made by Google, and does so with all the power of an elite handset and the effortless cool of the Nothing Phone 1 that never reached US shores. If you've been waiting for a Pixel 7 alternative with style and substance, and can forgive a handful of concessions (most notably on durability) for superior performance and retrofuturistic vibes, then follow the light and grab yourself a Nothing Phone 2 without hesitation.\nShould you buy the Nothing Phone 2?\nThe Nothing Phone 2 carries over the same transparent glass design and LED lighting array \u2014 portentously dubbed The Glyph \u2014 from the Nothing Phone 1, but ups the ante with more powerful internals, subtle build tweaks, and other minor spec bumps. The result is a familiar Android phone with a fractionally higher price tag, but one that pushes beyond the mid-range trappings of its predecessor to take on the biggest names in the business.\nThe Nothing Phone\u2019s part-retrofuturistic overall aesthetic is kept intact, but when I put the Phone 2 next to the Phone 1, the tweaks to the formula \u2014 admittedly one still heavily indebted to the iPhone \u2014 started to show. The lighter two-tone shades of the Dark Gray model I have on hand work in tandem with the more varied and defined textures and lines to emphasize the internal components and carefully positioned covers far more than the Phone 1. I haven\u2019t seen the White version in person, but it looks just as refined at a glance. The haptics have also been further tuned, and while the uniquely precise and crisp feel and sound of Nothing\u2019s particular vibration style will continue to be an acquired taste (I personally love them), they\u2019re far from the buzzy mess you can get from sub-flagship tier phones.\nThe overall footprint of the Phone 2 has increased and it\u2019s marginally heavier, but it\u2019s far from weighty and is actually thinner than before. The biggest difference in the hand is the rear glass, which is now subtly curved as it tapers into the squared-off recycled aluminum frame, eliminating some of the jagged edges of the Phone 1. Sadly, the actual glass on both the front and rear is still Corning\u2019s aging Gorilla Glass 5 rather than a newer grade like Victus; a strange concession considering both the increased price tag and the fact that Nothing hopes you\u2019ll keep the phone face down, glass first, to see all those funky Glyph lights. I haven\u2019t seen any cracks or scratches on my unit yet, but I\u2019ve been a little extra careful and wary because of it. It\u2019s still a slippery customer too, so you\u2019ll need a good Nothing Phone 2 case (preferably one that doesn\u2019t obscure the back).\nAs for The Glyph itself, Nothing has stuck with the same enigmatic layout of lines of curves, but has split the strips into 11 sections in total up from six, and added more lighting \u201czones\u201d (read: more addressable LEDs; 33 up from 12), for greater diffusion and to allow for more functionality. I won\u2019t go through all the new Glyph features here \u2014 read more at the link. The main additions I found useful were the Essential Glyph to distinguish WhatsApp messages from key contacts and the Timer to track timer progress at a quick glance.\nThe Nothing Phone 2's Glyph and transparent design stand out in a world where smartphones are almost uniformly generic slabs.\nDoes all this make the Glyph a killer app? Honestly, no. The broader feature set makes it less gimmicky than before, but the actual use cases aren\u2019t exactly groundbreaking, and some are clearly underbaked (like the Progress tracker which currently only works with Uber; not particularly useful in my rural village where Uber is non-existent). For The Glyph to really take off, it needs app developer buy-in, and considering it\u2019s a niche feature on a niche phone from a niche brand, well, I don\u2019t see it. That said, I\u2019m glad Nothing is sticking with it. It\u2019s a novel, eye-catching design quirk in a world where smartphones (at least ones that don\u2019t fold) are almost uniformly generic slabs, and the 8-bit-like tones and discordant beats (which you can customize in the Composer) that accompany Glyph arrangements are a genuine delight for nostalgia hounds like me (also the club ringtone is a \u201cbop,\u201d as the kids say).\nThe Nothing Phone 2\u2019s display sticks to an FHD+ resolution with a 20:9 aspect ratio and a smooth 120Hz refresh rate. The pixels-per-inch ratio is technically lower (392 down from 402) but you can\u2019t tell the difference. Plus, the thinner bezels and larger size of the Phone 2 allow for more screen real estate, stretching from 6.55 inches to 6.7 inches. As with the Phone 1, it\u2019s a nice panel with high contrast OLED colors, though it\u2019s made even better by an increased peak brightness (up to 1,600 nits) for improved outdoor visibility, and the use of LTPO technology for adaptive refresh rates as low as 1Hz to preserve battery for static content. The only other change is the newly-centralized punch-hole for the selfie camera.\nThese minor upgrades are nice, but the biggest spec change lies at the heart of the Nothing Phone 2. Despite courting a captive audience of power-hungry early adopters, the Nothing Phone 1\u2019s Snapdragon 778G Plus was something of a disappointment for many. It ran fine for everyday tasks in my experience, but gaming lagged behind (sometimes literally) and the customized version of Qualcomm\u2019s mid-range chip began to age pretty quickly as more and more features were added to Nothing OS. The Nothing Phone 2 blasts all that with 2022\u2019s marquee processor, the Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1.\nThe massively improved peak performance goes a long way to justifying the Nothing Phone 2's higher (yet still affordable) price, though throttling is an early concern.\nWe already know from our extensive Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 testing here at Android Authority that the overclocked chip can offer significant peak burst and sustainable performance upgrades while improving efficiency and limiting temperature spikes over the regular Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It may have been superseded by the Gen 2 in 2023, but the Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 is a great choice for a sub-$600 phone, and the generational improvement, as seen in the benchmarks below, is a massive leap forward over the Nothing Phone 1 that goes a long way to justifying the MSRP increase on its own.\nI had no complaints about performance or overheating during my hands-on tests, be it general use multitasking with GPS and music streaming on the go or gaming with the power-sucking Honkai: Star Rail and a few demanding emulators. It should be noted, though, that the sustained performance drop in the 3DMark Wild Life stress test raises some questions about throttling under load. A 36% drop in GPU scores after just five runs is quite aggressive for this chip, and while overall stability of 54.3% over 20 runs still keeps it above the Pixel 7\u2019s Tensor G2 throughout, it\u2019s far below the steady performance we\u2019ve seen from other Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 phones \u2014 the OnePlus 10T, for example, only dipped to 91% of its maximum in the same test. Here\u2019s hoping Nothing can eke out more sustained GPU power through firmware updates.\nI tested the 12GB RAM variant and memory management wasn\u2019t an issue. I can\u2019t vouch for the 8GB RAM base model, but we\u2019ve seen this exact same setup (with matching LPDDR5 RAM) on the Motorola Razr Plus with no issues whatsoever. If you\u2019re looking for full future-proofing, I\u2019d recommend going for the 12GB model as you\u2019ll also double your fixed storage to 256GB too.\nAnother significant area of improvement for the out-of-the-box experience for the Nothing Phone 2 is the software. I called Nothing OS anemic in my Nothing Phone 1 review as it felt incomplete and underbaked, with missing stock Android features and a lack of anything new in its place. Over time, Nothing worked hard to change that perception with frequent updates filled with tweaks to existing features and entirely new ones. This has culminated with Nothing OS 2.0 on the Nothing Phone 2, and the custom skin finally feels ready for prime time.\nRunning over Android 13, Nothing OS 2.0 brings over all the great additions like the custom weather app, one-handed mode, and Glyph customization options, while adding more room for personalization. You can read about all the Nothing OS 2.0 features at the link, but my favorites are the monochrome mode icons (pictured) and the custom app folder illustrations that let you pick from pre-set dot matrix-style covers and hide the app clutter on your homescreen.\nNothing OS no longer feels like a beta.\nThe only mild criticism I can level at Nothing is that its ambitions of an \u201copen ecosystem\u201d with support for third-party brand devices isn\u2019t really evolving. Support for AirPods battery icons and Tesla connectivity have been stuck in the Experimental Features section for months now, and it\u2019s unclear what the endgame is. Props to Nothing for not locking its features to its own ecosystem, however. Even if you pair some Ear 2 buds, they\u2019ll work the same as on any other Android device. The NFT widget appears to be gone, too. I won\u2019t miss it!\nThe Nothing Phone 2\u2019s camera setup is another area where Nothing Phone 1 users will feel a pang of the familiar, but the changes (and in some cases, lack thereof) are notable. I\u2019ll include some samples below, but for more shots at full-res check out this Drive folder.\nThe main camera has the same overall specs, but swaps the Sony IMX766 sensor for the newer IMX890. This is the same sensor we saw on the OnePlus 11 (that Nothing-OnePlus heritage just won\u2019t fully go away will it?) and the results aren\u2019t too dissimilar, albeit with some custom image processing that builds on the Nothing Phone 1\u2019s already solid main shooter.\nThe biggest improvement is in dynamic range, as multiple light sources are handled expertly. Noise has been reduced in shadows in good lighting, though the white balance does still tend to get a bit skewed in overcast settings (and I see a lot of those here in the UK). The colors continue to be contrast-heavy, which can bleed into other objects and surfaces, though sharpening is kept to a minimum and the auto HDR is far more punchy. AI-assisted motion capture technology also helps avoid blur on moving targets. There\u2019s definitely a warmer temperature to photos captured by the Nothing Phone 2 compared to its predecessor, a look I prefer and one which is far more suited to hoarding those Instagram likes. The auto-night mode feature helps clean up noise in low light, though I\u2019d prefer if it was a constant toggle option rather than one that only appears when the phone detects dim lighting.\nA subpar ultrawide shooter, slight shutter lag, and 1080p-capped selfie video are sore spots in an otherwise impressive camera setup.\nOne mild disappointment is the presence of shutter lag. This was tolerable on the Nothing Phone 1 as it ran on a weaker chip, but the Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1\u2019s raw grunt and upgraded ISP should breeze through rapid snaps, yet there\u2019s a half-second delay over my Pixel 7 Pro (running the same chip as the equally-priced $599 Pixel 7). It\u2019s faster than the Nothing Phone 1 and possibly not enough that you won\u2019t notice without direct comparisons with other devices, but I still hope Nothing can eliminate the slight lag with updates.\nNothing calls its 2x zoom \u201cSuper-res Zoom,\u201d which, aside from being a branding that Pixel-fans will immediately raise an eyebrow at, is essentially a digitally-assisted crop of the main sensor. Detail is surprisingly decent at 2x, but anything beyond that starts to fall apart, though that\u2019s to be expected with no telephoto lens on offer (just like the Pixel 7, no less).\nUnfortunately, the ultrawide camera continues to be the odd one out in an otherwise decent group of cameras. It sticks with the same Samsung JN1 sensor as the Nothing Phone 1 and benefits from that phone\u2019s myriad firmware updates that targeted the ultrawide shooter, but overall the results still suffer from muddy textures and halo effects around objects. The macro mode remains its saving grace, as it uses the high-megapixel ultrawide camera and autofocus to take usable extreme close-ups.\nThat just leaves the selfie camera, which has doubled its megapixel count to 32MP. I was really happy with the snaps, especially the detail and color accuracy. Natural bokeh is already decent, but you can take it further with portrait mode. The edge detection missed a stray clump of hair in the seaside wind in my tests, but in calmer environments, it was far more consistent.\nVideo also received some love, with Action Mode (capped at 1080p/60fps) offering superior stabilization for fast-moving footage. You can still use the Glyph as a fill light and the red video recording light dot is still there buried in the camera app settings for alerting someone when you\u2019re filming them. The real headscratcher, though, is the continued lack of 4K video on the selfie camera, let alone 4K at 60fps. Why this restriction exists on a phone intended to appeal to vloggers and the TikTok generation is beyond me. At least the rear cameras now shoot 4K/60fps to match the competition.\nThe Nothing Phone 2\u2019s larger footprint allows room for a slightly larger battery. With the 4,700mAh cell, combined with the efficient processor and LTPO display tech, the Nothing Phone 2 comfortably outlasts the original. For my average mixed use (music/video streaming, photography, plus general social media and web browsing), it pushed through a day and a half before dropping below 10%. That fell to the following morning with more stressful testing and gaming, but it\u2019s still early days as Adaptive Battery gets used to my usage patterns. Overall, pretty great, as is the charging; 45W Power Delivery PPS support means you\u2019re looking at just under an hour to go from zero to 100%, and 50% in closer to 20 minutes. You\u2019ll need a compatible brick to hit those top recharge speeds, but the Phone 2 supports a smorgasbord of fallback standards in case you have an older adapter. Add in 15W wireless charging and 5W reverse charging for your accessories and you\u2019ve got an all-round impressive phone for battery life.\nQuestionable durability and tinny speakers rank among the few areas where the Nothing Phone 2 falls short of nearby rivals.\nMiddling cameras and not-quite-tough-enough glass aside, the Nothing Phone 2 does have some pesky flaws that keep it from true greatness. Chief among them is the IP54 rating. It\u2019s a notch above the IP53 rating on the Nothing Phone 1, so it\u2019s now protected against sprays of water from any direction, but it\u2019s still not officially rated for immersion or completely ingress protected. At $599, we\u2019re in full water and dust resistance territory for most phones, and it falls behind even cheaper options from Apple, Samsung, and Google. The optical in-display fingerprint reader is also a finicky customer that doesn\u2019t always work the first time, and its oddly low placement means you have to stretch with your thumb if that\u2019s your usual choice for fingerprints. Elsewhere, the bottom speaker has an extra gap in the grille, and the balance between it and the earpiece speaker has been fixed, but the sound the pair delivers is quite tinny and lacks any depth at any volume; again, a tough pill to swallow at this price considering the richness of the Pixel 7\u2019s audio.\nFinally, Nothing\u2019s update policy is good enough, with three years of OS updates and four years of security patches. That\u2019s a decent stretch of coverage and Nothing has thrown off any worries that it won\u2019t deliver long-term support with the way it treated the Nothing Phone 1. However, four years of security support does fall one year short of Samsung\u2019s mid-rangers and (once again) Google\u2019s Pixel 7 that linger around the same price tag.\nWhat are the best Nothing Phone 2 alternatives?\n- Google Pixel 7 ($545 at Amazon): I mentioned the Pixel 7 throughout this review for a good reason. The best value phone on the market comes in at the same $599 price tag but remains a better all-rounder than the Nothing Phone 2 thanks to superior durability, Pixel-exclusive software features, and the magic of Google\u2019s computational photography. Yet while the Pixel 7 has a unique camera bar, the rest of the design isn\u2019t as spiffy as the Phone 2, and Nothing has it beat on raw power for both peak processing performance and charging.\n- Google Pixel 7a ($477 at Amazon): If you can\u2019t stretch your budget over the $500 barrier, the Pixel 7a takes most of the Pixel 7 experience and packages it for $100 less. Yet while it\u2019s still a superior camera phone overall, the limited battery endurance and pitiful charging power are smoked by the Nothing Phone 2.\n- Samsung Galaxy A54 5G ($379.5 at Amazon): With no new Fan Edition phone in sight in the US, Samsung\u2019s closest competitor isn\u2019t the Galaxy S23 but the more affordable Galaxy A54 5G. With Galaxy S stylings, a stunning display, and a whopping four years of software updates (and five years of security patches), the Galaxy A54 5G is a reliable pick, though you\u2019ll miss out on the fun of The Glyph, far superior peak performance and charging, wireless charging, and 4K/60fps video.\nNothing Phone 2 specs\n| Nothing Phone 2 | |\n|---|---|\nDisplay | 6.7-inch LTPO OLED Flat Gorilla Glass 5 cover 2,412 x 1,080 resolution 120Hz variable refresh rate (as low as 1Hz) 240Hz touch sampling rate 1,600 nits peak pixel brightness HDR10+ support 1-bit color depth |\nProcessor | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 |\nGPU | Adreno 730 |\nRAM | 8 or 12GB LPDDR5 |\nStorage | 128, 256, or 512GB UFS 3.1 No microSD card slot |\nPower | 4,700mAh battery 45W PPS/PD wired charging 15W wireless charging 5W reverse wireless charging No charger in box |\nCameras | Rear: - 50MP wide (Sony IMX890, \u0192/1.88, 1/1.56-inch sensor, 1\u00b5m pixel size, 24mm focal length, OIS, EIS, HDR) - 50MP ultrawide (Samsung JN1, \u0192/2.2, 1/2.76-inch sensor, 114-degree FoV, EIS, HDR) Front: - 32MP wide (Sony IMX615, \u0192/2.45, 1/2.74-inch sensor, HDR) |\nVideo | Rear wide: - 4K at 60 or 30fps - 1080p at 60 or 30fps - Slow motion at 4K at 120fps - Slow motion at 1080p at 120, 240, or 480fps Rear ultrawide: - 4K at 60 or 30fps - 1080p at 60 or 30fps Front: - 1080p at 60 or 30fps |\nAudio | Triple mics Dual stereo speakers No 3.5mm headphone jack Bluetooth 5.3 |\nDurability | IP54 rated |\nBiometrics | Optical in-display fingerprint sensor Face Unlock support (insecure) |\nSIM | Dual physical SIM No eSIM |\nConnectivity | 4G: Gigabit with 4x4 MIMO 5G: Gigabit 5G Dual Mode (NSA & SA) with 4x4 MIMO Wi-Fi: Wi-Fi 6, 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax, 2.4G/5G dual-band, 2x2 MIMO and MU-MIMO, Wi-Fi Direct Bluetooth 5.3 NFC support |\nBands | 5G NR: n1, n2, n3, n5, n7, n8, n12, n20, n25, n28, n30, n38, n40, n41, n66, n71, n75, n77, n78 4G LTE (FDD): B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B7, B8, B12, B17, B18, B19, B20, B25, B26, B28, B30, B32, B66, B71 4G LTE (TDD): B34, B38, B39, B40, B41, B42, B48 3G UMTS: B1,2,4,5,6,8,19 2G GSM: GSM 850,900,DCS,PCS |\nPorts | USB-C Dual-SIM tray |\nSoftware | Nothing OS 2.0 based on Android 13 Three years of Android upgrades Four years of Android security updates |\nThe Glyph | 33 individual addressable LED zones Covered with Gorilla Glass 5 White light only |\nDimensions and weight | 162.1 x 76.4 x 8.6mm 201g |\nColors | Dark Gray or White |\nIn-box contents | Nothing Phone 2 Transparent USB-C to USB-C cable Transparent SIM tool Pre-applied screen protector Paperwork |\nNothing Phone 2 review: FAQ\nThe Nothing Phone 2 is not waterproof.

Learn more.\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra is a big, brilliant phone that doesn't feel special enough to me anymore\nFebruary 15, 2025\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\nMSRP: $1,299.99\nWhat we like\nWhat we don't like\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\nYou know that feeling when something comes out and you know that you should love it? Like when your favorite author drops a new title out of nowhere, even if it\u2019s not their typical genre, or your favorite football team signs a promising but injury-prone young player? On paper, you know that there\u2019s a ton of potential there, and your hopes should be sky-high. In reality, though, the experience isn\u2019t always what it\u2019s made out to be.\nFor me, that\u2019s what has happened with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra after testing it for a couple of weeks. Even though I know I should be impressed by its new slate of Galaxy AI features, overclocked chipset, and flexible cameras, I can\u2019t help but think that Samsung\u2019s most expensive candy bar flagship falls a little flat. Here\u2019s why I feel somewhat let down \u2014 but why you might feel differently.\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s design is functional rather than fun\nNobody ever said that Samsung\u2019s massive, productivity-minded Galaxy S25 Ultra had to be the sleekest device around \u2014 nor did I expect it to be. I spent enough time with its predecessor, the Galaxy S24 Ultra, to know that there are only so many ways you can combine four cameras and an S Pen and still have room for a massive 5,000mAh battery. And yet, I remained hopeful that Samsung would at least find a way to keep its absolute beast of a flagship somewhat comfortable to use. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not so much the case for me.\nNow, I didn\u2019t expect it to fit perfectly in the palm of my hand \u2014 I\u2019m a small guy, and this is not a small phone. Huge phones don\u2019t work for me because I struggle to reach across a 6.7-inch (or larger) display, and I don\u2019t love when a device doesn\u2019t fit comfortably in my pocket. However, I\u2019m happy to make exceptions when phones feel well-designed, like the just-round-enough OnePlus 13 or the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL with a slightly softer aluminum frame. The problem, for me, is that the Galaxy S25 Ultra is neither of those things.\nInstead, someone at Samsung decided to merge the design of its largest flagship with that of its smallest. So, off went the rounded frame that made the Galaxy S24 Ultra manageable to hold, and in its place sits a flat, industrial slice of titanium that meets the front and rear glass at sharp right angles. It\u2019s almost identical to the frame on both the Galaxy S25 and the Galaxy S25 Plus, with an additional rear camera and an S Pen tucked along the bottom edge. For me and my small hands, though, the result is a phone that feels too big and blocky to be held comfortably. I need to use two hands with the Galaxy S25 Ultra at almost all times, and that\u2019s without even touching the S Pen.\nOf course, I know why Samsung made the changes it did. I know that it\u2019s better to have a series of flagships that all match and that the Ultra was always going to feel big to have enough space for its additional camera and stylus \u2014 that\u2019s just the way it is. I know that adopting tougher glass for the front and back panels is a substantial upgrade, especially if you want to live that caseless lifestyle \u2014 but please, as a guy who has had to repair a phone or two in his day, don\u2019t trust glass or titanium over concrete.\nAlso, if you\u2019re after a new phone that\u2019s simply gorgeous to sit and look at, I\u2019d recommend you keep moving. My colleague C. Scott Brown recently put together a list of the best-looking phones ever made, and to me, the Galaxy S25 Ultra deserves to be as far away from that list as possible. It\u2019s taken on a generic profile to the point where there\u2019s almost no personality left. The cameras sit in their own little islands once again, and the sharp frame makes the front and back panels of glass feel like they\u2019re so far apart.\nSamsung's choice of materials is excellent, but I wish it hadn't made the Galaxy S25 Ultra less comfortable to hold.\nWhile I have no real love for the size or shape of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, I can\u2019t fault Samsung\u2019s materials. Both the grade-five titanium frame and Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front and back feel like they could take a beating, whether you drop the phone on the sidewalk or let it take a tumble across your kitchen floor. I probably wouldn\u2019t recommend either one \u2014 it\u2019s a $1,300 phone, after all \u2014 but I\u2019m a little more confident carrying this Ultra without a case than I usually am. Besides, if I put a case on it, I won\u2019t be able to appreciate the satin finish that continues to be one of my favorites long after Samsung has given up on the Phantom branding. This year, my color of choice is a shade called Titanium Silverblue, which feels like a silly combination of three slightly different colors, yet it\u2019s spot-on in describing the pale blue finish.\nOf course, Samsung knows you\u2019re not about to buy the Galaxy S25 Ultra for its refreshed design. You might not even buy it for the S Pen \u2014 especially now that it comes without Bluetooth. But, what you should consider buying the Galaxy S25 Ultra for is its display, which is simply excellent. Of course it is \u2014 Samsung had to save something for its top-end launch. I\u2019d go so far as to say that I love the Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s display, I just wish it were in a phone that\u2019s easier to wrangle, almost like it should fold in half for more comfortable carrying\u2026 call it a Galaxy Flip or something.\nAnyway, I\u2019ve yet to find an area where the 6.9-inch Dynamic 2X AMOLED panel struggles, from helping me keep up with Chelsea FC\u2019s not-a-title-race to exploring the new set of Space-Time Showdown cards in Pokemon TCG Pocket. The truly variable 1-120Hz refresh rate is buttery smooth, whether I\u2019m digging through a 38-hour Spotify playlist (not a joke) or trying to recap an entire week of Champion\u2019s League football at double speed (also, not a joke). Samsung\u2019s 2,600 nits of peak brightness might not quite match the 3,000 nits of the Pixel 9 Pro XL or the 4,500 nits of the OnePlus 13, but let\u2019s be honest \u2014 you\u2019re not going to notice a difference. I certainly didn\u2019t, whether I was navigating to drop a friend off at a metro station or doomscrolling before bed.\nMy last two points on the design of the Galaxy S25 Ultra are a little bit disappointing, but neither one is shocking. First, there is no full Qi2 support on Samsung\u2019s top-end flagship. Technically, the entire series is Qi2 Ready, which means it can work with magnetic accessories, but you\u2019ll need a specific magnetic case to add the functionality. Those magnets could also interfere with the S Pen, which is only made worse because it can\u2019t be used as a remote camera shutter anymore, either. Also, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is IP68 rated, which is still great, but we\u2019ve started to see much more affordable devices launch with IP69 protection from jets of water and heat. It would be nice to see Samsung do the same when there aren\u2019t too many other changes in store.\nQualcomm\u2019s overclocked Galaxy-exclusive chipset remains excellent\nAlthough Samsung\u2019s current hardware design falls incredibly flat for me, I can\u2019t argue with anything going on under the hood of the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It\u2019s tough to pack an overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset with 12GB of RAM and up to 1TB of fixed storage and not perform like an absolute winner. Of course, you never know \u2014 I\u2019ve gone into reviews with high hopes, only to discover that a flagship can\u2019t keep up with its own thermal demands.\nBut the Galaxy S25 Ultra is not one of those flagships \u2014 this is a performer through and through based on our comparative benchmarks. As always, I loaded up our usual slate of CPU and GPU-intensive tests and put Samsung\u2019s numbers up against the best from Apple, Google, and OnePlus, taking on the top in-house processors and the standard version of Qualcomm\u2019s best chip at the same time.\nAs expected, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 Ultra came ready to compete across all our tests. It didn\u2019t dominate the competition outright, falling short of the iPhone 16 Pro in single-core Geekbench performance and landing behind the OnePlus 13 across 20 runs of 3DMark\u2019s Wild Life test, but it checked every other box I asked of it along the way. It put up the highest PCMark score I\u2019ve ever seen, suggesting a better balance across various day-to-day tasks than its closest Android rivals.\nI\u2019m also slightly surprised to see how quickly the massive Galaxy S25 Ultra fell behind the OnePlus 13 in terms of GPU performance, though it remains comfortably ahead of competitors from Apple and Google. There\u2019s a good chance that\u2019s precisely where Samsung wants to be \u2014 it seems to treat the iPhone and Pixel as its main threats \u2014 but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the safest plan. To me, the OnePlus 13 is the best phone I\u2019ve used in a long time, and for Samsung to seemingly rule it out feels like a dangerous game.\nLuckily for Samsung, though, benchmarking never tells the whole story. Outside of occasionally being bettered on paper, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is a beast in daily life. As mentioned above, it\u2019s guided me comfortably through my winter of activities, from dropping friends at grad school visits to navigating me to the Apple Store when I needed to repair a device. It\u2019s been somewhat challenging to adopt the Galaxy S25 Ultra as my daily driver, given its massive size, yet I\u2019ve come back to it without fear any time streaming has been involved. It answered my call when I needed some post-hangover Super Bowl highlights, and it will continue to guide me when I have to find my way to the SEPTA station in Wilmington, Delaware, for the victory parade on Valentine\u2019s Day. Samsung\u2019s cooling setup is also strong enough to avoid the kind of overheating issues we saw with some of the earliest Snapdragon 8 Elite handsets.\nIt's tough to doubt a 'For Galaxy' chipset when Qualcomm comes up big time and time again.\nWith Samsung\u2019s ever-reliable 5,000mAh battery under the hood, I\u2019m not too worried about how the Galaxy S25 Ultra will handle a long day spanning three states. It\u2019s a beefy cell that doesn\u2019t seem to slow down very quickly, and I\u2019ve regularly been able to push it for two days away from a charger before I\u2019m worried about turning on power-saving mode. Also, this is usually where I\u2019d insert the results of our standardized battery drain test, which puts a phone through a gauntlet of everyday tasks like web browsing, video streaming, and camera capturing. Unfortunately, Samsung\u2019s top-level optimization has somewhat broken our test for now, with the Galaxy S25 Ultra preferring to save its juice rather than shift from one leg of the test to the next.\nSo, instead, you\u2019ll get my thoughts on the battery performance on an average day. In short, it\u2019s excellent. Although I\u2019m not pulling the Galaxy S25 Ultra out of my pocket and checking it quite as often as other phones when it\u2019s out, I tend to use it for longer stretches at a time. I\u2019ll start by checking a sports score or two from the Now Bar, only to find myself hopping from a video podcast on Spotify to checking off a few levels in Royal Match before I go back to check on the status of my pack stamina in Pokemon TCG Pocket. I\u2019ll occasionally spend a bit longer exploring some of the new Galaxy AI features, too, but we\u2019ll come back to those in a second.\nAnyway, when you knock out the Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s massive cell, you\u2019ll tap into a charging experience that feels all too familiar. For what feels like the fifth year in a row, Samsung is sticking with 45W wired and 15W wireless charging for its most expensive flagship. Don\u2019t get me wrong, 45W wired speeds are pretty good \u2014 as long as you have the required USB PD PPS charger \u2014 but they no longer feel revolutionary or especially impressive. Motorola has surpassed Samsung with 68W speeds on its top Edges and Razrs, and OnePlus is even faster with 80W wired charging on the OnePlus 13.\nAs seen above, Samsung still has Apple and Google in a charging chokehold. Although Google updated its most premium Pixel 9 Pro XL with 37W wired speeds, it still demands an additional 20 minutes on the block before it\u2019s ready to get back in action. The iPhone 16 Pro is even worse, nearly doubling the Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s charging time despite having the smallest battery of the current flagship crop.\nOf course, digging into Samsung\u2019s charging setup gives me another chance to bemoan its lack of proper Qi2 support. It\u2019s been two years since the Wireless Power Consortium launched its Apple-supported take on MagSafe, and I thought we\u2019d have native support by now. Instead, you have to buy a specific case for use with your already expensive phone, and adding magnets to the Galaxy S25 Ultra ultimately strips out one of its most unique features, the S Pen. It\u2019s a bit of a silly limitation on an extremely expensive device that otherwise delivers on just about every front.\nIs Samsung still a camera king?\nSticking with another typical Samsung strength, it\u2019s time to discuss the Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s cameras. Most years, Samsung launches its new slate of flagships, and they slot comfortably onto our podium for the best Android camera phones that money can buy. Sometimes, Samsung even adds an exciting new wrinkle or two or at least a few megapixels to one of its sensors. This year, we got the latter.\nAt a glance, the four sensors that dot the rear panel of Gorilla Armor 2 look almost identical to those that came before. They still live in their individual rings, though those rings are slightly more robust this time around. And, in three out of four cases, they\u2019re identical to the previous generation. Samsung carried over the same primary and telephoto hardware from the Galaxy S25 Ultra, keeping a 200MP sensor as the star of the show and backing it with 10MP and 50MP lenses set to 3x and 5x optical zoom, respectively. The one difference, however, comes in the ultrawide sensor, which has jumped from 12MP to 50MP and expanded its maximum aperture from \u0192/2.2 to \u0192/1.9 to capture more light and offer a shallower depth of field. So, with that basic hardware rundown complete, let\u2019s check out some camera samples. Also, please forgive the general lack of color \u2014 winter in Baltimore is a difficult time to escape red bricks and gray skies, what can I say?\nDespite the overall sameness of the colors across most of my samples \u2014 thanks, default Samsung profile \u2014 I feel like the variety of zoom lengths and shooting modes offers a decent feel for the Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s potential. While I think some of Samsung\u2019s punchier colors, like the orange of the glass bottles and the green of the Pitango Bakery sign, might thrive better in the spring and summer months, the sharpness in both photos is still excellent. I was especially impressed with the detail of the glass bottles as I was using Samsung\u2019s digital macro mode, which relies on the upgraded ultrawide sensor. It pulled solid detail out of the bottles themselves and the cement base in which they\u2019re encased without falling into the fuzzy macro trap some ultrawide cameras suffer from.\nAlso, while I\u2019m mostly unimpressed with Samsung\u2019s camera filters (as I\u2019ll discuss in a minute), I quite like the results of my custom filter when applied to the holly bush. It gives the berries a much warmer punch than reality, and the warmer colors are almost enough to make up for the snow I had to trudge through to find colorful plant life. I can\u2019t give Samsung too much credit for that filter, though, since it\u2019s based on an image I took with my Fujifilm X100V and then ran through Samsung\u2019s camera app.\nBy the way, if you\u2019ve read a recent Samsung Galaxy review, you probably remember us pointing out issues with motion blur, especially when snapping photos of pets. Well, I\u2019m happy to say that those issues have been largely cleaned up, at least in well-lit scenes. I\u2019ve been impressed with a few of the shots I\u2019ve captured of my friends\u2019 dogs running around my neighborhood park and had decent luck catching moving players at the Eagles\u2019 Super Bowl parade, both in bright daylight. Unfortunately, low-light scenes still throw a little bit of a wrench into the motion blur, as the slower shutter speed makes my tuxedo cats look like even more of a black-and-white blur than they already are.\nHowever, the spot where Samsung surprised me most was when I put it through its zoom paces. After all, Samsung has been bragging about hitting 100x on its Ultra-tier flagships for years, so you\u2019d expect the results to be pretty good. Well, I think they can be decent, but there\u2019s a limit to what Samsung\u2019s sensors can resolve with help from Galaxy AI. I reached out to shoot across Baltimore\u2019s harbor to capture the cranes that work day and night at the sugar factory and found myself decently pleased until I hit 30x zoom. Up to that point, the details looked fine, and the overall colors were good \u2014 if a bit dark against the very bright sky \u2014 and then I punched in to 100x zoom and got\u2026 something that looks like it was rendered in the Nintendo 64 classic Goldeneye. Sure, you can make out the lines and shapes of the crane, but they look more like a low-poly render than an image taken with a $1,300 smartphone.\nFlipping the camera around, Samsung\u2019s approach to selfies should be a good reminder that more isn\u2019t always better. I\u2019ve been far more impressed with the front-facing camera on the Galaxy S Ultra models ever since it ditched the 40MP sensor in favor of a 12MP version, picking up bigger pixels and ditching the need to bin along the way. I trust both Samsung\u2019s color science and edge detection in portrait mode, though I might like a slightly wider field of view for the wide selfies since it only really adds enough space if someone is standing right over my shoulder.\nWhile I\u2019d say that, on the whole, the Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s cameras are pretty good (at least up to 30x zoom), I think that Samsung is relying on software upgrades more than ever. Because the sensors themselves aren\u2019t drastically different, I found myself digging into smaller features to find something worth getting excited about. In doing so, I spent a decent amount of time with Samsung\u2019s new set of camera filters, which are specifically designed to challenge Apple\u2019s Photographic Styles, and I also gave Samsung\u2019s Audio Eraser a shot, which is a Galaxy-flavored version of Google\u2019s Audio Magic Eraser.\nUnfortunately for Samsung, both features still need a bit of fine-tuning and polish before they\u2019re ready to take on their original inspirations. I couldn\u2019t find enough differentiation in any of the camera filters to want to pick one over the default profile, though I do like that you can create your own based on an existing image. I also struggled to control the Audio Eraser effectively, with its Auto setting taking out too much noise and the more specific sliders often failing to separate one audio source from another. That said, Samsung will probably push updates to both features over time, so I\u2019ll be curious to come back to them in the future.\nVideo shooters will also be happy to know that capturing clips on the Galaxy S25 Ultra remains excellent. You can shoot in up to 8K resolution at 30fps or 4K at up to 120fps from the rear cameras, and 4K at up to 60fps from the selfie shooter, and Samsung\u2019s stabilization remains rock-solid. There are also a few new pro-grade wrinkles to dig into, like the ability to shoot in Log format for later color-grading or the Audio Eraser tool I mentioned above. I\u2019ll probably skip recording in Log myself, but I\u2019m glad to see Samsung taking on Apple\u2019s ProRes Log support.\nYou can also check out full-size versions of these camera samples and many more at this Google Drive link.\nOne UI 7 is great, no matter how you feel about Galaxy AI\nWhile the camera wrinkles might not have landed perfectly for me, they were far from enough to spoil the rest of my Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra experience. Most of the new modifications to One UI 7 and updates to Galaxy AI kept me using the monster of a phone even after complaining about its overall footprint. I\u2019d even go so far as to forgive Samsung for making us wait so long to get full access to Android 15 once the Galaxy S25 series came out \u2014 especially considering Google beat it to the punch by several months on the Pixel 9 series.\nAnyway, my first hint that Samsung had spent a good long time revamping its Galaxy AI experience was when I went to test out the updated version of its Portrait Studio. See, I was less than impressed when the feature launched last year and only really preserved one human face from a photo at a time, so this year, when it got added into the Drawing Assist experience and paired with a Galaxy AI image generator, it gave me a lot more hope. The new results are significantly better than before, and they hold onto other things about your subject, like their original clothes and almost \u2014 I mean almost \u2014 a semblance of the original background. Drawing Assist struggles when it can\u2019t find a human face, though, occasionally turning my friends into bridges or sunset scenes.\nSamsung also decided to lightly copy Apple\u2019s Dynamic Island but, like most Android developers, wanted to do Apple one better. Thus, the Now Brief and Now Bar were born. In Samsung\u2019s case, the Now Bar is closer to a Dynamic Island-like experience, popping up in your notification bar with score updates, weather forecasts, and more bits of information throughout the day, while the Now Brief is more of a one-stop shop. It appears on your lock screen and home screen several times throughout the day, giving you an easy breakdown of the weather and your upcoming appointments. It\u2019s largely felt impressive to me, though I can\u2019t say I love the politically charged news articles, especially when most other briefings tune their recommendations to your interests.\nSamsung's Galaxy AI theme park is more crowded than ever, but is it worth the price to ride?\nOh, and I guess I can officially bid farewell to my friend and yours, Bixby. After automatically mapping the power button on the previous Galaxy S24 series to open the in-house assistant, that button now launches a Gemini interface, which you can use to complete tasks across apps. Unfortunately for Bixby, I couldn\u2019t be happier. Gemini is faster and more responsive when I ask it for specific context, and I\u2019m already more familiar with the interface after spending most of my time with a Pixel in my pocket. It became my go-to plumbing partner when I needed to fix my kitchen sink, and I\u2019ve been counting on it to help me make plans to reach Broad Street in Philadelphia for one more Super Bowl celebration.\nOf course, the rest of Samsung\u2019s well-established Galaxy AI features are also back. Circle to Search remains really, really good, and Samsung\u2019s Object Eraser in the Gallery app is more accurate than ever \u2014 especially when compared to the state of Apple\u2019s Clean Up feature. I still haven\u2019t found a love for the Writing Assist tools, but I write for a living, so that\u2019s one piece of my job that I will defend until the end.\nOutside of Galaxy AI, though, the rest of Samsung\u2019s One UI 7 experience is just as good, if not better. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is in line for seven years of overall updates and already feels excellent, with redesigned widgets, better color-matching for app icons to your wallpapers, and redesigned default icons that look and feel a little more lively than they used to. I\u2019m not as in love with the split of notifications into one pulldown menu and quick settings into another, but I\u2019m slowly getting used to it after a few weeks with the phone \u2014 and I can\u2019t find the correct setting to restore it to the previous One UI 6 layout. Also, the side-scrolling app drawer is no more; you can finally set your Galaxy S25 up with a vertical, alphabetized drawer, and it\u2019s made my life so much easier.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review verdict: A brilliant phone that\u2019s not for me\nSo, at this point, there\u2019s little doubt left as to how I feel about the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: It\u2019s an excellent Android super-phone that packs all of the features, software support, and premium materials you could ask for, but it\u2019s just not the phone for me. Has it impressed me at almost every turn? Yes, and it certainly deserves praise for that. It\u2019s an objectively excellent phone that largely reminds me why Samsung isn\u2019t all that afraid of what Google, OnePlus, or Motorola comes up with because it just has to rinse and repeat with the things that work and make them just a tiny bit better. In my eyes, though, it\u2019s just too big for me to want to carry it every day, and after another year of minor iteration, it\u2019s not doing enough new to convince me to look past that.\nAnd yes, I know that\u2019s a tough reason to knock a phone so severely that I put my SIM in something else, but it\u2019s true. If they say that the best camera is the one you have with you, then the best phone is probably also the one that you want to carry. Unfortunately, that means carrying something smaller, even if I have to give up on a little bit of battery life or reach for cameras that don\u2019t quite scratch 100x zoom. On the bright side, though, that also means that Samsung has at least one other phone that would fit my needs much better \u2014 and another one pretty soon that we\u2019ve already been teased with.\nI know that the Galaxy S25 Ultra is brilliant, but it's too big for me to fall in love.\nThe base Galaxy S25 ($809.99 at Amazon) and the Galaxy S25 Plus ($999.99 at Amazon) deliver the bulk of the same experience, offering the same number of software updates, the same stable of Galaxy AI features, and similar overall materials while not putting nearly as much strain on your wallet. As someone who doesn\u2019t use the S Pen hardly ever and came away not too impressed with Samsung\u2019s 100x zoom, I would be just as happy with a phone that fits comfortably in my hand and tops out at a usable 30x zoom. That said, if you have a semi-recent Galaxy S phone, you\u2019re almost certainly better off hanging onto it as the upgrades on offer from Samsung across the entire series are pretty meager this year \u2014 or at least wait until we have more info on the still-mysterious Galaxy S25 Edge.\nPerhaps the best way to describe Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 Ultra is this \u2014 it\u2019s a big, powerful phone that doesn\u2019t feel special enough anymore. And while Samsung may not want to admit it, its closest rivals are more competitive than ever.\nGoogle\u2019s Pixel 9 series might still lose in a raw power foot race, but it has been running Android 15 for months and seems determined to advance its overall design and build quality much faster than Samsung. Google also did something I\u2019d been begging for for years and introduced a smaller Pixel 9 Pro ($999 at Amazon) that I find much more comfortable to use than the Pixel 9 Pro XL ($1099 at Amazon). I also think that Google still has an edge in terms of camera processing, with its AI-powered editing features proving just a little bit more reliable than Samsung\u2019, plus you save a bit of cash, which is always a big factor.\nThere\u2019s also Samsung\u2019s major market competition, the iPhone 16 Pro ($999 at Amazon) and Pro Max ($1199 at Amazon). As always, Apple\u2019s most expensive flagships feel like they\u2019ve been tailor-made to challenge Samsung, finally jumping into the AI race and picking up new hardware buttons along the way. So far, Apple has introduced its own take on just about all of the AI features that Google and Samsung have tried, debuting Clean Up to take on the Object Eraser, Image Playground to take on the Portrait Studio, and a slate of writing tools to help clean up your messages. However, the biggest hurdle to picking up an iPhone will still be that you have to give up many of the Android comforts that brought you to Samsung in the first place and will likely have to buy a new suite of accessories \u2014 albeit with far more variety to choose from.\nThe S25 Ultra is the definition of Samsung playing it safe, and the more reasonably priced flagships from both Google and OnePlus are starting to loom very large.\nTo me, though, the real dark horse that Samsung should be worried about snatching away Android power users is the OnePlus 13 ($899.99 at OnePlus) \u2014 a phone that blew me away while reviewing it. Although the lack of official carrier availability will hurt OnePlus\u2019s overall popularity, everything else about its latest flagship should make Samsung sweat. It bumped to an IP69 rating in addition to its IP68 protection, upgraded to even better Hasselblad-tuned cameras that are pretty impressive past 100x zoom, and picked up a slightly rounded body that\u2019s still extremely comfortable to hold despite the massive 6.82-inch display. And again, just like Google, you\u2019ll save yourself some cash with it thanks to the relatively massive $400 price gap.\nOnePlus might still be behind the best Android phones in terms of its software update commitment, but I have to say, switching to the S25 Ultra \u2014 one of the most competent, yet safest plays we\u2019ve seen from Samsung to date \u2014 made me long to go back to a flagship that was genuinely pushing the envelope and didn\u2019t remotely feel like it was settling.\n- Premium materials\n- Great battery life\n- Solid cameras\n- Top-tier Snapdragon performance\n- Brilliant display\n- Excellent software policy\n- Downgraded S Pen\n- Mostly AI-based upgrades\n- Still no full Qi2 support\n- Can be uncomfortable to hold\n- Very expensive\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro is the small Android phone I've been waiting for\nFebruary 1, 2025\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro\nMSRP: $999.00\nWhat we like\nWhat we don't like\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro\nIf you\u2019ve read any of my many reviews here at Android Authority, you\u2019ll know I like a small phone. You\u2019ll know I appreciated devices like the base Pixel 8 and iPhone 15 because they would fit comfortably in my hand (and pocket) and let me go about my life without feeling like I had a tablet in my pocket.\nBut you\u2019ll also know that smaller phones almost always come with compromises, like ditching a telephoto sensor, trimming a few gigabytes of RAM, or capping the charging speed \u2014 minor cuts that limit the overall experience. I always had to give something up to keep a phone I liked in my pocket, at least until Google launched the Pixel 9 Pro.\nNot too big, not too small\nIf I\u2019ve waxed poetic once about Google\u2019s design evolution over the years, I\u2019ve done it a hundred times \u2014 and now I\u2019ll do it just one more time. After all, Google\u2019s penchant for colorful finishes and clean lines drew me to the Pixel series in the first place, and the Pixel 9 Pro is no exception. In fact, the Pixel 9 Pro specifically might well be the best iteration yet, if only because it finally gives me the top-tier Pixel experience in a phone that I can use one-handed. I think it\u2019s fairly obvious that Google saw what Apple was doing with its two Pro-level iPhones and decided it could do one better.\nThat\u2019s not much of an exaggeration, either \u2014 the Pixel 9 Pro is more iPhone-like than ever. It has a simple G logo on the back instead of a half-eaten apple and a camera bar that\u2019s become more of an island, but the flattened side rails and display are similar enough to make Tim Cook blush. And, like I said when I called the Pixel 9 Pro XL the best iPhone ever, I mean that in the best ways. See, Apple has long set a standard when it comes to smartphone build quality. Whether or not its latest iPhone models look exciting, you know they\u2019ll feel sturdy and reliable. Google\u2019s annual updates, on the other hand, always felt like they had room to improve, either due to super-thin side rails, curved displays prone to accidental touches, or in-display fingerprint readers that weren\u2019t very good.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro is the best-made Pixel of all time, and it even fits in my hand.\nNow, it\u2019s hard to even think of those flaws while using the Pixel 9 Pro. Google\u2019s new 6.3-inch AMOLED panel is perfectly flat, yet the slight curve on the back of the aluminum frame allows the phone to sit comfortably in your hand for a long day of usage. Its slightly textured back panel of Gorilla Glass Victus 2 feels ever so slightly more premium than its predecessor, tucking comfortably into the glossy frame rather than sticking out behind it. And, while I thought that glossy frame might have worked against Google\u2019s larger Pixel 9 Pro XL, it\u2019s much easier to admire on a smaller phone that doesn\u2019t feel like you have to hold onto it for dear life. Even if you drop it, the IP68 rating should give you a little peace of mind in dirt and water if you\u2019re out for a weekend away from home. Nevertheless, you\u2019ll definitely want to protect your investment with a suitable case.\nDespite its smaller stature, the Pixel 9 Pro\u2019s display packs the same impressive specs as its top-end sibling. It pairs its slim bezels with an impressive 3,000 nits of peak brightness while holding a solid 2,000 nits in high-brightness mode. Both measures are enough to keep the Pixel 9 Pro easily visible while sitting on the beach during Labor Day weekend on the East Coast \u2014 though I\u2019ve hardly come close to maxing out the phone\u2019s display otherwise. It\u2019s still interrupted by a punch-hole selfie camera, but even that\u2019s about as easy to ignore as the bezels.\nI\u2019ll admit that a small part of me, somewhere deep down, feels slightly disappointed by Google\u2019s newfound maturity. Shrinking the camera bar and giving it durable aluminum edges might make it more durable, but it also means that the days of two-toned Pixels might be gone for good. Its side rails might be easier to hold, yet they\u2019re less distinctive in an ever-evolving Android market. Even the color options feel more muted on the Pixel 9 series, with fun hues like Bay and Mint making way for Rose Quartz and Hazel. They\u2019re still gorgeous, just not as fun or flashy as Pixels of the past.\nHowever, if my biggest complaints are improved durability and slightly grown-up colors, the Pixel 9 Pro is doing many things right. Taking all the best parts of the Pixel 9 Pro XL, it\u2019s easily the most enjoyable Pixel to use in my experience, and it feels like it should set the tone for smaller, lighter phones in the future. The Pixel 9 Pro feels like a message to Samsung, OnePlus, and other Android competitors that a pro-level phone doesn\u2019t need a massive display.\nOh, and the temperature sensor is still here \u2014 just figured I should mention it after Google essentially forgot about it. I\u2019m still struggling to find reasons to use it.\nIt still runs (mostly) like a Pro\nOf course, with Google packing its updated Tensor G4 chipset into a smaller body with less room for cooling components, I was a little nervous about how the Pixel 9 Pro would perform. I figured that any thermal shortcomings associated with the Tensor chip would only be amplified by its new, pocket-friendly residence and that the Pixel 9 Pro might fall a bit behind its full-sized sibling, the Pixel 9 Pro XL. I\u2019m happy to report that I was wrong (mostly).\nAs usual, I put the chipset \u2014 which comes backed by 16GB of RAM and a disappointing 128GB of storage in its base configuration \u2014 through its paces with our usual set of CPU, GPU, and battery tests. But, while you might expect that extra RAM to kick things up a notch, you can only actually use 13GB of it with the remaining 3GB carved out for Gemini. Anyway, I lined it up against its top Android foes and Apple\u2019s more portable Pro, if only so that it could tell me what I already knew: The Tensor G4 is still no benchmarking beast.\nSure, it beat its predecessor, the Tensor G3, in just about all of our testing, but it still has a decent gap to make up before it\u2019s genuinely racing against the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 or Apple\u2019s A17 Pro \u2014 though rumor has it that we might see some of those improvements on the Pixel 10. Surprisingly, the Pixel 9 Pro is neck and neck with the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL across most of our workload and CPU tests. It\u2019s not a significant gap \u2014 just a percentage point or two across most of my tests \u2014 but good news for small phone enthusiasts everywhere. That said, the expected dip in GPU performance for the smaller Pixel 9 Pro is pretty visible as the phone drops to the Tensor G3-powered Pixel 8 Pro\u2018s performance after just five runs, while the XL version manages to sustain decent stability for another 10 runs. This is likely due to the reduced room for the new vapor chamber.\nOf course, while we compared the Pixel 9 Pro to the latest from Apple and Google at its launch, things have changed since then. The iPhone 16 series arrived with Apple\u2019s A18 chip under the hood and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 series picked up an overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor, both of which open the gap a little bit wider over the Tensor G4. So, we\u2019re right back to Google feeling a bit further behind on paper, but we\u2019ll hold out some hope for the next generation to tighten up again.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro's performance keeps up with the XL model... mostly.\nThankfully, the Pixel 9 Pro feels just as capable as its sibling in day-to-day use. I headed down to the Jersey shore for a holiday weekend and compared my Pixel 9 Pro head-to-head against the Pixel 9 Pro XL my dad recently bought from Verizon. We started our days at about the same time, me kicking off my day with a mix of Spotify streaming and checking the Chelsea FC score a few times throughout a five-mile run and him heading to the end of the island to capture some photos and see how the cameras compared to the Galaxy S21 Ultra that he traded in.\nThe rest of the day saw us use our Pixels a bit closer together, sitting in the sun and sand and putting the Tensor G4 under a bit more thermal load than it probably would have liked. I put my Pixel 9 Pro through an hour or so of gaming, split between Royal Match and Warhammer 40,000: Tacticus, which warmed it up a bit, but never to the point where I needed to hide it in the shade to let it cool off. Even though my stretch of gaming didn\u2019t cook the Tensor G4, it did show me one thing \u2014 the Pixel 9 Pro has a bit of a battery weakness.\nI know what you\u2019re thinking \u2014 of course, the Pixel 9 Pro puts in a shorter battery shift than Google\u2019s other Pro-grade Pixels; it has a smaller battery (over ~300mAh smaller than the XL). That\u2019s true, but it\u2019s also powering a smaller display, so I was still surprised to see such a gap in our battery drain testing. It fell short of the Pixel 9 Pro XL by a pretty good margin across all categories, faring the worst when 4K video was involved \u2014 either recording or playback.\nThe smaller Pixel\u2019s Zoom and web results are a bit more respectable, and it leads Google\u2019s trio in gaming durability, but it\u2019s not enough that you can expect two full days of usage between charges. Real life involves a better mix of usage, so you might not feel the effects of poor gaming battery usage, but I found myself reaching for a charger more than every 36 hours.\nWhen you need a charge, you\u2019ll run into another one of Google\u2019s puzzling Pixel decisions. Even though it bumped the Pixel 9 Pro XL\u2019s wired charging up to 37W, it left the Pixel 9 Pro behind with 27W wired charging with a USB PD PPS-enabled charger. Strangely, that\u2019s the same speed the previous Pixel 8 Pro supported, but you wouldn\u2019t know it from the graph above. The Pixel 9 Pro took almost 90 minutes to fill with Google\u2019s brand-new 45W charger, while the Pixel 8 Pro filled its larger battery nearly 10 minutes quicker with an older 68W Motorola TurboPower charger I had lying around.\nInterestingly, our testing showed that the Pixel 9 Pro spent more time charging at near-peak speeds (21 minutes instead of 19), but it reached a top temperature of 42.2 degrees Celsius compared to the Pixel 8 Pro\u2019s 38.2 degrees, which is likely where you see the dropoff at around the 35-minute mark above. Thankfully, though, the Pixel 9 Pro appears capable of reaching its full 27W speeds from that same TurboPower charger that I\u2019ve trusted for a few years \u2014 unlike the Pixel 9 Pro XL, which seems to require an extra special set of chargers to reach its full potential due to weird interactions with charger voltage.\nYou can also skip Google\u2019s headache of a wired setup and charge your Pixel 9 Pro wirelessly, in which case it\u2019ll reach 21W with the second-generation Pixel Stand ($79 at Best Buy) or 12W from any other Qi-certified pad. I wish I could make complete sense of Google\u2019s plan for its charging setup, but alas, Goog\u2019 gonna Goog\u2019.\nPortable Pixel cameras\nOne thing I wasn\u2019t worried about was Google\u2019s cameras not living up to the hype on the Pixel 9 Pro. After all, it packs the same trio of high-resolution sensors I just finished testing on the Pixel 9 Pro XL, just in an easier-to-wield form factor. That means you once again have a 50MP primary sensor with a shallow maximum aperture of \u0192/1.7 with which to capture your world, as well as ultrawide and telephoto sensors to back it up. They fill out the camera bar nicely and make the Pixel 9 Pro one of the best camera phones around \u2014 especially at its size.\nBoth of Google\u2019s peripheral lenses offer matching 48MP resolutions but are pretty much opposites otherwise. The ultrawide snapper gained the same maximum aperture as the primary camera but swapped to a slightly tighter 123-degree field of view \u2014 just like the Pixel 9 Pro XL. While you probably won\u2019t notice that loss of three degrees, you\u2019ll probably welcome the extra light capture, which should make it easier to grab macro shots using Google\u2019s software-based solution. Oh, and it\u2019s a little easier to get close to your subject with the smaller 6.3-inch footprint. The Pixel 9 Pro\u2019s periscope telephoto sensor offers less of a change from its predecessor, sticking with 5x optical zoom and reaching up to 30x Super Res Zoom. Let\u2019s head to the beach to check out a few camera samples.\nFirst, proof that Google still knows how to shoot and process a well-lit photo. My weekend at the beach wasn\u2019t quite as adventurous or colorful as my trips to Pittsburgh and Washington, DC, with the Pixel 9 Pro XL, but I found that the smaller Pixel 9 Pro was just as willing to pull details out of shots throughout its zoom range. I\u2019m particularly pleased with the photo of the sun setting over the bay, which caught everything from the color of the sky to the small birds on the dock and kept the wood boards in the foreground in soft focus.\nThe image of the capybara in the second row is good, too, even if the water around the world\u2019s largest rodent is pretty gross. Google nailed the colors of the floating leaves and the shade as it falls across the animal\u2019s fur, and you can just about make out the turtle swimming just below the surface of the background. I would have liked a little more pop in the image of the boats next to it, though, which looks a little bit dead and flat.\nThankfully, I got all the pop I wanted on an evening walk downtown. The Pixel 9 Pro gave the middle image of a neon sign plenty of glow in the building and on the tree in the background while preserving the barely visible telephone wires overhead. I\u2019m impressed that you can still make out a bit of green in the leaves in the shot to the left, too \u2014 low-light photos often crush those clusters to blackness.\nI\u2019ve said this before, too \u2014 macro mode should always be software-based, and the Pixel 9 Pro shows why. It gives its 48MP ultrawide sensor double duty, and the wide-open aperture means that it can grab more light to process. The result is a snail shell that shows every last grain of sand and a Black-Eyed Susan with plenty of detail through its \u201cblack eye.\u201d\nGoogle\u2019s overall zoom range is pretty impressive, too. I would typically bin almost all of my 10x and 30x samples shortly after writing a review, but I\u2019m pleased with the details in the seagull and the tracks in the sand at 10x zoom. Our feathered friend is a little bit fuzzier at 30x zoom, but you can still make out that he\u2019d come to steal your hotdog if given a chance.\nAnd then, there\u2019s Google\u2019s updated selection of AI-powered features. I already mentioned that I liked the revamp of panorama mode on the Pixel 9 Pro XL, and it\u2019s just as good here. It\u2019s incredibly simple to line up your shot across a series of dots rather than trusting a steady hand, even if there\u2019s a tiny processing error along the dock to the right side.\nUnfortunately, Zoom Enhance isn\u2019t quite as impressive. It took almost a year to launch after being announced alongside the Pixel 8 Pro, but the result is a photo that looks far too sharp in some places while not looking much different in others. The patriotic badge to the right seems almost like it\u2019s been cut with a laser to capture the leaves and outline, giving it edges that are much too sharp. Rather than Zoom Enhance, the feature feels more like Zoom Oversharpen, and sharper isn\u2019t always better.\nZoom Enhance? More like Zoom Oversharpen... which isn't the same thing.\nOther AI-powered features let you be a little more creative, like the improved Reimagine option in Magic Editor. On top of resizing and rearranging elements of your shot, you can now replace the sky, the ground, and things your subject is holding with a tap and a little typing. The Pixel 9 Pro still gets a little fuzzy at the edges of its image generation, but it\u2019s significantly better than the artifact-heavy version launched with the previous generation.\nGoogle gave the Pixel 9 Pro the same selfie camera overhaul as the Pixel 9 Pro XL, which remains one of the bigger surprises in this year\u2019s camera setup. It packed a 42MP sensor into its punch hole, which captured more accurate colors and details when I compared it to the base Pixel 9\u2019s 10.5MP shooter.\nI could copy and paste the Pixel 9 Pro\u2019s video chops if I wanted to, too \u2014 they\u2019re the same as the Pixel 9 Pro XL. It can shoot clips at up to 20x Super Res Zoom, which Google will then apply Video Boost for smoother, sharper final results. The Pixel 9 Pro can upscale videos to 8K resolution, from which you can clip 33MP stills.\nYou can also check out full-resolution versions of these samples (and several more) at this Google Drive link. Oh, and if you want even more samples from the Pixel 9 Pro XL \u2014 which has the same hardware \u2014 we have a gallery of those at this Google Drive link.\nAnd, of course, there\u2019s Gemini\nAs you\u2019ve probably figured out, everything the Pixel 9 Pro XL can do, the Pixel 9 Pro can do too \u2014 just smaller. That, of course, includes its mountain of AI-powered capabilities. I\u2019ve already touched on a few camera-focused features above, but they\u2019re only the start of Google\u2019s lofty plans for the Gemini age.\nAnd yes, I still have reservations about everything I do being used to train Gemini (one week in Pixel-land isn\u2019t enough to change that), but Google\u2019s finished product is much better than the current offerings from Samsung, Motorola, and other phone brands hurriedly jumping into the AI race. Maybe it rushed a few things to market on the Pixel 8 series and launched its Gemini Assistant without giving it the power to, well, assist with your smart home, but it\u2019s clear that Google has learned a lot in the last year or so.\nGemini has come an impressively long way in just one generation, whether I'm creating images or asking tricky questions.\nEverything feels a little smoother and quicker, whether you\u2019re chatting with a revamped and interruptible Gemini Live or generating images from text in Pixel Studio. I\u2019ll admit that since swapping from the Pixel 9 Pro XL to the Pixel 9 Pro, I\u2019ve been a bit more inclined to use the latter than the former \u2014 but that\u2019s more so I wouldn\u2019t have to explain the concept of Gemini Live to my grandparents while sharing a beach house for the weekend. The fact still stands that Gemini Live, with its eight interchangeable voices, is scary good, just in a way that I think would freak out two people who currently use a Motorola Moto G Play from 2021.\nOn the other hand, Pixel Studio feels like something every parent wishes they had when their kid asked them to draw something. In fact, that\u2019s kind of how I explained it while showing off my \u201csmartphone of the week,\u201d as my family calls it. This time, I stuck to a theme of beach-related creations, putting animals on surfboards and burying treasure on 85th Street, and the Pixel Studio continued to show off its Imagen 3-powered chops. You still can\u2019t generate people, though, making the overall experience much different from Samsung\u2019s Portrait Studio.\nOther features, like the revamped Pixel Weather app and all-new Pixel Screenshots app, are more like the unsung heroes of Google\u2019s Gemini revolution. You might not notice things like organizable widgets for the air pressure and wind direction if you never scroll past the hourly forecast and radar, but the AI-generated Weather Report is like the one-sentence reminder your mom used to give you before you headed out the door for school in the morning. I\u2019ll also readily admit that I\u2019m not a screenshot guy \u2014 preferring to leave a billion Chrome tabs open as reminders \u2014 but I might start changing my tune if I can remember to make folders every time I research seven vs seven soccer tactics and look for betting advice during college football season.\nThese are also just the Gemini features we can use so far. Google\u2019s Pixel 9 series is promised software updates for seven years, including Pixel Drops, including security patches, Android versions, and regular feature drops. The Pixel 9 Pro launched with Android 14, which seemed like an unusual step, but it picked up Android 15 shortly after launch.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro review verdict: Small and mighty in equal measure\nWhen I finished reviewing the Pixel 9 Pro XL, I called it the phone I\u2019d been waiting for. As it turns out, the Pixel 9 Pro was the phone I actually had been waiting for \u2014 I just didn\u2019t know it. Everything I said about Google\u2019s larger flagship absolutely still rings true, with impressive cameras, an impressive suite of AI-powered features that are mostly user-ready, and a build quality that\u2019s head and shoulders above Pixels of the past. The Pixel 9 Pro XL is a sublime choice for anyone who wants the very best Pixel has ever had to offer and wants it in the biggest package possible. But for me, it\u2019s just far more enjoyable on a phone that I can use with one hand.\nGoogle\u2019s ability to pack this much power into a 6.3-inch smartphone should put other Android flagship series\u2019 on notice. You don\u2019t need to churn out a nearly 7-inch smartphone to call it a Pro or even an Ultra (though I guess that size still justifies the Plus moniker). The Pixel 9 Pro combines a battery capacity that rivals the Galaxy S24 Plus, cameras that out-process the OnePlus 12, and an update commitment that goes up against just about anyone. Factor in its build quality, and there aren\u2019t many phones I\u2019d reach for before this one.\nFinally, a pro-grade Pixel that fits comfortably in my pocket.\nAnd yet, the Pixel 9 Pro isn\u2019t without a few small phone compromises. Google didn\u2019t see fit to bring its fastest charging to its smaller model, nor has it figured out a few of the kinks (thermals and benchmarking) that have plagued the Tensor chip since its earliest days. Perhaps the latter results from the former, but we\u2019ll probably find out when Google makes its anticipated switch from Samsung to TSMC for its next in-house chipset. I don\u2019t think either flaw is a true dealbreaker, though, as the Pixel 9 Pro escapes most of the charging headache that plagues its big brother while feeling just as smooth as any other flagship from day to day.\nBut if you want a solution for at least one of those issues, Google has a Pixel 9 Pro XL ($1099 at Amazon) that it\u2019ll sell you. It offers almost the same experience as the Pixel 9 Pro, from the flattened-out design to the brilliant cameras and Gemini infusion, just bigger. It picks up an extra half-inch of screen real estate to match its 5,060mAh battery and grabs the 37W wired charging that can save you a few minutes \u2014 provided you have one of a particular set of chargers. My colleagues and I don\u2019t often hand out five-star ratings at the end of reviews, but the Pixel 9 Pro XL more than earned its accolades.\nShould you decide to venture outside of Google\u2019s ecosystem, it becomes a bit tougher to choose natural rivals for the Pixel 9 Pro. It\u2019s configured closer to Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 Plus ($999.99 at Amazon), yet sized to match the base Galaxy S25 ($809.99 at Amazon). Personally, I\u2019d rather have Google\u2019s more natural cameras and more complete AI experience, but I\u2019m sure that some will reach for the Galaxy S25 Plus with its larger 6.7-inch display and faster 45W wired charging at the same price. Both of Samsung\u2019s smaller phones pack the more powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, which might sway users, too, even though it won\u2019t feel any quicker in day-to-day usage.\nAnd then there\u2019s the iPhone \u2014 Google\u2019s twin from another operating system. Whereas the Pixel 9 Pro XL matched up nicely against the iPhone 16 Pro Max, the Pixel 9 Pro is more comfortable against the smaller iPhone 16 Pro ($999 at Amazon). From the side, the two are nearly twins, sharing flat frames and glossy finishes and even matching the placement of their antennas with only the square camera bump and Google\u2019s camera bar to tell them apart, as well as Apple\u2019s new Camera Control, which I\u2019ve only found a few reliable uses for. Of course, going for the iPhone probably means diving headfirst into Apple\u2019s larger ecosystem, which could be quite the investment once you add an Apple Watch and maybe an iPad to replace your current Android alternatives.\nThank you for being part of our community.

Learn more.\nIf the Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro fixed this one thing I would tell everyone to buy them\nApril 5, 2025\nNothing Phone 3a Pro\nMSRP: $459.99\nWhat we like\nWhat we don't like\nNothing Phone 3a Pro\nI like the Nothing Phone 3a \u2014 the Phone 3a Pro, too, for that matter. I think they\u2019re the best phones the company has put out in its short history, and I believe they are well worth the price of admission. And, for most of the world, I can say that you should go out and buy one. I can tell you that they make significant improvements over their predecessors, the Phone 2a and 2a Plus, and that they deliver even better value with new triple-camera setups and shiny Qualcomm chipsets.\nBut I have bad news for US-based Android enthusiasts like myself. Like all of the upstart brand\u2019s recent releases, neither the $379 Nothing Phone 3a nor the $459 Nothing 3a Pro will work properly on major US networks, making this pair of exciting budget phones complete non-starters stateside. Here\u2019s why that decision frustrates me and why I hope it changes really soon.\nTwo great designs, but I have a clear favorite\nRight now, it\u2019s tough to get excited about a lot of the budget-friendly Android phones launching in the US \u2014 especially in terms of design. It often feels like an endless cycle of Samsung recycling cheaper versions of its flagship Galaxy S design, Google trying to figure out what the Pixel A series should actually look like, and Motorola trying to spice things up with a mix of vegan leather backs and bright colors. Of those, I admire Motorola\u2019s approach, but I wouldn\u2019t call it exciting. Nothing\u2019s ever-changing lineup of semi-transparent designs, though? Now, that\u2019s a different story \u2014 one that\u2019s much more fun to tell.\nFrom most angles, it\u2019s the same story across both the Nothing Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro. They have almost everything in common, from their matching plastic frames to the position of their buttons to the slim, even bezels that run around the sides of their respective 6.77-inch, 120Hz AMOLED displays. Even the Glyph Interfaces and semi-transparent layouts are identical, with three LED panels surrounding the one very obvious element that sets these two budget phones apart: The camera bump. On one of these phones, it works, but on the other, it really, really doesn\u2019t.\nYo dawg, I heard you like camera bumps, so I put a camera bump on your camera bump \u2014 but only on the Phone 3a Pro.\nYes, before I can continue praising Nothing for a lot of the things that I like about its latest round of budget phones, I have to talk about the elephant in the room \u2014 almost literally. Although the more affordable Nothing Phone 3a slides by with three simple cameras, all lined up in a small, unobtrusive row, the Phone 3a Pro packs its sensors into what I can only describe as the body of a typical smartwatch and then slaps them on the back of an otherwise sleek, well-balanced slab. Of course, there\u2019s a reason for the massive bump, as I\u2019ll get to down below, but it doesn\u2019t make the phone any more comfortable to carry.\nIn fact, despite Carl Pei\u2019s protests to the contrary, I\u2019d say the Nothing Phone 3a Pro feels nearly as top-heavy as the mega-wobbly Pixel 6 Pro from a few years ago. It threatens to topple out of my hand whenever I try to pick it up one-handed or hold it too close to the bottom. Perhaps the only benefit to such a beefy camera bump is that it worked nicely as a grip while I watched the Washington Spirit take on Bay FC on my favorite free streaming service, NWSL Plus. It\u2019s also served the same purpose nicely while gaming \u2014 it\u2019s much easier to tilt and steer with a beefy camera bump than with something smooth and slight, like the one on any number of Moto G devices.\nBut, while the difference in camera bump is the main thing that swings me towards the more affordable Nothing Phone 3a, it\u2019s not the only advantage \u2014 I like the cheaper phone\u2019s colors better, too. It\u2019s not the most significant difference in the world, nor is it a life or death factor, but I\u2019d much rather have the light blue finish of the Phone 3a than either the gray (or grey, because British) or black of the Phone 3a Pro. I\u2019ll also mention that neither of my units suffered from the small blemishes reported by other buyers.\nOn top of the additional camera sensor, one more new feature sets the Phone 3a series apart from its predecessors: The Essential Key. As Nothing explains it, this new hardware key, which sits annoyingly below the power button, is there so you can easily add screenshots and voice notes to the also-new Essential Space \u2014 which might be the best new software feature I\u2019ve used in a long time. Although I\u2019m not convinced by the need for a new hardware button, which you can single-press to grab a screenshot or long-press to record a voice note, I\u2019ve fallen in love with Nothing\u2019s quick, AI-powered summarization of whatever you save to your own personal space.\nSo far, I\u2019ve relied on the Essential Space mainly as a concert organizer for the summer, snapping screenshots and filtering them into a collection dubbed \u201cConcert Plans.\u201d From there, the Essential Space pulls out everything from the concert date to when tickets go on sale and automatically generates reminders so you don\u2019t miss your shot at good seats (or whatever else you decide to save). Outside of wanting to use on-screen gestures or remap the power button to also control the Essential Space, I have to say that this is one of the better uses of AI I\u2019ve come across. Here\u2019s hoping it stays free permanently.\nOtherwise, the best thing these two phones have in common is their 6.77-inch AMOLED displays. Both 120Hz panels are made from Panda Glass, and both top out at a nearly blinding 3,000 nits. Of course, you\u2019ll hardly spend any time at that peak brightness, but it\u2019s a helpful maximum in case you need it. I\u2019ve yet to find an area where the display has struggled, putting it through plenty of tiny details while catching up on highlights from the early weeks of the NWSL and MLS seasons and also coming in handy so that I could watch Nintendo Direct off to the side of my MacBook Air so I could get the low-down on the Switch 2 while writing this review.\nUnfortunately, Nothing\u2019s budget-friendly design does come with a few cuts \u2014 most notably the lack of wireless charging. This isn\u2019t a surprise, as the Nothing Phone 2a and 2a Plus didn\u2019t support the feature either, but it\u2019s still disappointing. I\u2019m waiting for the day when I unbox a cheap Nothing phone and see that transparent coil design staring back at me. Also, the Phone 3a and 3a Pro have IP64 ratings against water and dust, which is good but not quite great. We\u2019re used to seeing limited ratings in this segment, but Motorola\u2019s $300 Moto G Power (2025) launched with IP68 and IP69 protection only a few months ago. Nothing ditched the transparent ends of its charging cables, too, which is less of a functional complaint and more of a stylistic one.\nWelcome to Nothing\u2019s A series, Qualcomm\nWhile I already knew that I would like most of what Nothing changed on the outside of its latest budget phones \u2014 or at least on the base Phone 3a \u2014 I was much more curious about the changes under the hood. Previously, the company had reserved Qualcomm chipsets for its flagship-equivalent Phone 1 and Phone 2, opting for MediaTek silicon on its more affordable Phone 2a series. Now, though, it\u2019s Qualcomm all the way down, with the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 at home on the Phone 3a and 3a Pro. The two, unsurprisingly, also share identical RAM and storage configurations, with up to 12GB across all models and up to 256GB of fixed space for apps, files, and whatever else (though the base model in most markets pairs 8GB with 128GB).\nI wondered whether the switch was made with an eye on improved performance or to open the door to a more extensive set of AI-powered features, but there\u2019s only one way to find out. So, I set up the Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro for our usual gauntlet of benchmarking tests. I figured that with their identical hardware, they\u2019d also probably put up just about the same scores, and I was right \u2014 well, mostly right. Across both our CPU and GPU-intensive tests, the Phone 3a and 3a Pro finished neck and neck, occasionally trading very slight advantages, like the Phone 3a Pro putting up stronger single-core GeekBench performance and the Phone 3a taking the lead on PCMark\u2019s comprehensive Work 3.0 test.\nPerhaps more surprising to me is how the two phones fared against what I thought would be their closest competitors. I figured that Nothing\u2019s previous flagship, the Phone 2, would probably come out ahead with its Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 chipset, but I didn\u2019t expect the previous Phone 2a Plus to mostly stay ahead of the curve, too. Google\u2019s Pixel 9, which is standing in for how we expect the Pixel 9a with its matching Tensor G4 to perform, also outpaced the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 across both legs of the GeekBench 6 test, though it came back down to Earth during the comprehensive Work 3.0 benchmark.\nAnd then there\u2019s the graphics performance \u2014 another chance for the Phone 3a and 3a Pro to bring up the rear. At first, I thought there might have been an issue with my graph, as I couldn\u2019t find the red line of the Phone 3a, but once again, the two phones simply put up identical numbers. If nothing else, the scores are incredibly consistent, though they\u2019re also consistently behind the Phone 2a Plus from 2024.\nHonestly, I think the on-paper performance of the Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Plus surprised me so much because it didn\u2019t mirror my day-to-day experience. I spent plenty of time with both phones out and about (well, as much as I could without a reliable SIM option) and didn\u2019t notice a stutter or a stumble from either one. I dipped into light gaming in both Warhammer 40,000 Tacticus and Pokemon TCG Pocket when I could find a reliable Wi-Fi network, and I downloaded enough podcasts and playlists from Spotify to the Phone 3a that I could easily take it for hours of listening through my CMF Buds Pro 2.\nThe Phone 3a also reliably made it through a long day that involved waking up for a long run, swinging through a wedding party, and dashing off to Washington, DC, for the Spirit\u2019s home opener before coming back home to make it to a friend\u2019s birthday party. I have to admit I only took the Phone 3a with me for the day, though, as I could only make space for one data-free smartphone in my pocket in addition to the iPhone 16e I was already carrying for testing purposes.\nNothing's latest budget phones perform well, but without reliable US support, it's tough to tell just how well.\nAs you might imagine, though, that lack of 100% viable data options in the US makes it challenging to tell how the Phone 3a or 3a Pro would stand up to a long day of usage. The situation isn\u2019t quite as bad as it previously was with Nothing\u2019s program, as both the Phone 3a and 3a Pro now support at least some 4G and 5G bands across all of AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. Of the three, though, you\u2019ll have the easiest time activating your device on T-Mobile\u2019s network, as both AT&T and Verizon require you to contact the carrier directly in order to allow list your device.\nAnnoyingly, allow listing isn\u2019t exactly the same as full certification for your device, as you still risk dropping either 4G or 5G signal depending on the bands in your area, but it\u2019s better than nothing. Personally, I just did not have the patience to sit on the phone with Verizon\u2019s customer support in order to move my SIM to a phone that may or may not work in my area \u2014 especially if it meant I would have to call back in order to move my SIM once again to a phone with proper band support. Thankfully, you can check the supported bands for both phones on the FAQ page for Nothing\u2019s Beta Program.\nUltimately, though, the personal research and time investment required to get these phones working in the US is still a tall ask for any buyer, and a big hurdle that prevents me from recommending this phone to folks in the same way as a Pixel A or Galaxy A series phone \u2014 with those it\u2019s plug and play, no extra steps needed, and that goes a long way.\nIf the Nothing Phone 3a series does work in your area, though, and you can muster the energy to go through the whole process, I can\u2019t recommend the experience of Nothing OS 3.1 \u2014 based on Android 15 \u2014 highly enough. It\u2019s one of the better near-stock flavors of Android that remains, and it blends just enough of a Pixel UI-like interface with dot-based widgets and fonts for things like the weather and your daily step count. Nothing also relies on Google\u2019s version of a few handy editing tools like Magic Eraser, which I much prefer over Nothing trying to invent a version of its own. The Phone 3a series will be supported for six years of updates, but the company has confirmed it\u2019ll only receive t a trio of major Android updates, which will carry it through until Android 18. That\u2019s a decent enough update policy for the money, but not quite on par with Samsung.\nAnother vital piece of using a phone day in and day out is how its battery holds up. Once again, the Phone 3a and 3a Pro are identical twins sporting 5,000mAh cells with matching 50W wired charging support. As such, you\u2019d be forgiven for expecting the two to hand in matching battery life performance \u2014 I know it\u2019s certainly what I expected. Instead, our controlled battery test gave the Phone 3a a clear advantage in three categories (a simulated Zoom meeting, web browsing, and snapping photos with the camera) while only really falling far behind the Phone 3a Pro while looping through a 4K video. I ran both tests on the same day, both in my temperature-controlled apartment and with the display brightness locked at around 75%, so I\u2019m not sure how the Phone 3a lasted so much longer.\nIn real life, I expect the battery life between the two to be a bit closer together, though you shouldn\u2019t have any issues using your choice of Nothing Phone beyond a day. I managed to take both phones through a busy weekend away from their respective chargers and didn\u2019t find myself sweating my remaining charge until I was about done on Sunday afternoon. Of course, we have to keep in mind that I wasn\u2019t taking calls or responding to texts on either device, which would likely drop the performance.\nWhen you tick your Phone 3a or 3a Pro down to zero, you\u2019ll again have the same option for getting it back up and running. Yes, as mentioned above, both phones support 50W wired charging and only wired charging without a see-through charging coil. This is, of course, faster than most budget phones in the US will support, so you might have to grab yourself a new wall charger if you do decide to give Nothing a try. Also, despite their identical setups, the Phone 3a Pro charged slightly faster than the Phone 3a, holding onto peak speeds for a few minutes longer. This put it close to the 56 minutes that Nothing claims for a full charge, though the Phone 3a\u2019s mark of around 63 minutes isn\u2019t bad, either.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between these triple-camera setups?\nWhile I don\u2019t love the massive camera bump on the back of the Nothing Phone 3a Pro, it offers a pretty significant advantage over the Phone 3a \u2014 at least when you want to zoom in. For the most part, the two budget phones take the same approach to their hardware, picking up almost identical 50MP primary cameras with 24mm-equivalent focal lengths and shallow \u0192/1.9 depths of field. The sensor on the Nothing Phone 3a Pro is a hair larger, but the difference in pixel size is hardly noticeable. Nothing also chose identical ultrawide sensors for its latest launches, opting for relatively small 1/4-inch 8MP sensors with 120-degree fields of view.\nHowever, when you make your way to the third sensor on the back of each device, you start to notice differences. For starters, this is the first time Nothing has ever opted for a triple-camera setup on any of its devices, so there\u2019s automatically more flexibility at play \u2014 a must-have to compete against the best camera phones and a big advantage over other budget camera phones that very rarely have dedicated zoom hardware. That said, the Phone 3a\u2019s straightforward 50MP 2x optical telephoto sensor is a bit limited compared to the Phone 3a Pro\u2019s 50MP periscope telephoto \u2014 which may well just be the cause for the massive camera bump. The latter carries Sony\u2019s stacked LYTIA 600 sensor, which uses a prism to capture and redirect light through the series of lenses, allowing a larger sensor to fit into a smaller space. It\u2019s set to 3x optical zoom with up to 6x lossless zoom via sensor cropping, while the Phone 3a offers 2x optical zoom with up to 4x quality via a crop.\nHonestly, it\u2019s a long, relatively technical way to say that the Nothing Phone 3a Pro delivers slightly better zoom results than its counterpart, topping out at 60x zoom rather than 30x, you\u2019ll have to pay a little more for them and get comfortable with the top-heavy design. As for the actual results from both phones, it\u2019s much harder to tell a difference at shorter zoom lengths. I found myself pretty happy with everything taken between 0.6x on the ultrawide and about 10x zoom, though unsurprisingly, both phones were at their best when optical quality was still within reach. Let\u2019s check out some shots.\nNothing Phone 3a camera samples\nDespite its relatively low resolution of 8MP, I\u2019ve routinely been impressed by what comes out of the Nothing Phone 3a\u2019s ultrawide camera. Although there\u2019s some glare from the lights of Audi Field to the left, the details around the stadium are good, as is the color recreation through the sky. I\u2019m also pleased with the colors through the magnolia tree in the night mode shot, which is lit only by the pagoda that you can see off to the left edge of the frame. It wasn\u2019t a bright evening, so Nothing\u2019s one-second timer had its work cut out for it.\nThis row, however, shows a mix of strengths and weaknesses from Nothing\u2019s more conservative cameras. Even though I quite like the Night Mode shot to the left (featuring the pagoda mentioned above), I wish the framing around the seagull were slightly tighter and the 10x zoom quality on Washington Spirit\u2019s Makenna Morris as she takes a corner kick is, well, not great. You\u2019ll see below how much of a difference the 3x optical telephoto sensor makes concerning that first point, but I\u2019m not sure that even the more powerful hardware would help enough under the tricky lights of a soccer stadium.\nNothing Phone 3a Pro camera samples\nSwitching to the Phone 3a Pro, I have to say that I like the contrast better across all three daylight shots. The wood of the pier below the gulls is slightly darker where the shadows sit, and the copper sundial shows much more detail than the corresponding shot I\u2019d taken (but not included) with the Phone 3a. If ever there was a time for Nothing\u2019s lenticular filter (the vertical wavy glass), it would be in the second shot with the neon signage, though I\u2019ve yet to train myself to toggle to it since I\u2019ve never used it on another phone \u2014 outside of the Phone 2a, of course.\nMoving on, I can\u2019t seem to get a firm grasp of Nothing\u2019s color science from one shot to the next. I love the warm, almost film-like hues in the roses off to the right side, and I can see a little bit of the warmth carried over as I look down one of the streets in Baltimore\u2019s Fells Point neighborhood, but the warm punchiness disappears a bit as I get to the otherwise colorful houses. On a sunnier day, they\u2019d pop off the screen, but I feel like they\u2019re flat against the white, cloudy sky.\nNothing Phone 3a vs 3a Pro zoom comparison\nOf course, you could sit and argue all day long about whether the Phone 3a\u2019s default zoom options for 2x and 4x zoom are better than the Phone 3a Pro\u2019s toggles for 2x, 3x, and 6x, but the truth is that everyone will have their preferences. For example, I\u2019d much rather have the weight and balance of the Phone 3a, but I found myself jumping to the Phone 3a Pro\u2019s 3x zoom length more than any other during my testing. Perhaps the best thing left to do is to compare the entire zoom ranges head-to-head to see where the Phone 3a runs out of steam.\nNothing Phone 3a\nNothing Phone 3a Pro\nAcross the two galleries, there\u2019s not much to pick out from either phone between 1x zoom and about 5x or 6x \u2014 outside of the bizarre color recreation from the Phone 3a Pro at 2x zoom. I\u2019m largely willing to dismiss it, as it didn\u2019t happen in any other camera samples I captured. However, at both 10x and 30x zoom, the Phone 3a Pro has a clear advantage over its more affordable sibling, offering a brighter image at 10x and much better sharpness with less color bleeding at 30x zoom. By the time it hits 60x zoom, though, both the detail and sharpness have pretty much fallen off, with the letters of the Domino Sugars sign still visible but most other details in the structure taking on the sharpness of a low-poly video game character.\nOnce you get past the zoom capabilities on the Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro, the camera experiences start converging again. Both phones opt for high-resolution selfie cameras, with the Phone 3a nabbing 32MP and the Phone 3a Pro going for 50MP, meaning all selfies bin down to more manageable sizes by default. I don\u2019t notice much difference between each set of shots, with solid details on both sides, but the color profile on the Phone 3a Pro is a bit redder, both in my face and in the brick of the building behind me. I\u2019ll also mention that Nothing\u2019s selfie angle jumps to 1.2x zoom (about a 27mm equivalent) by default. It\u2019s not a significant issue, just an odd choice to rely on something other than 1x zoom when you flip the camera around.\nAlso, I appreciate that the Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro have hopped on the resurgence of camera filters, following closely behind Apple\u2019s Photographic Styles. Both phones offer 10 filters to choose from (well, nine plus the lenticular filter that covers your image with a wiggly pane of glass), and you can upload custom LUTs that you might have lying around from Premiere Pro or another video editing platform. You can also swipe through a few camera presets, which automatically jump to specific zoom lengths and filters to save you some time in the settings menu. I\u2019ve relied more on the camera filters than the presets since the presets don\u2019t change too many settings.\nThe last piece of Nothing\u2019s identical pie is video support on the Phone 3a and 3a Pro. No matter which phone you pick up, you\u2019ll have up to 4K resolution at 30fps to work with from the front and rear cameras and 1080p at up to 120fps on the back. To my eye, the stabilization and quality look about the same, but the Phone 3a Pro will handle moderate zoom just a bit better thanks to its longer telephoto focal length \u2014 so long as you can manage the slightly heavier build.\nYou can also check out full-resolution versions of these camera samples (and several more from both phones) at this Google Drive link.\nNothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro review: Winners by split decision\nAs I said from the start, I really like both the Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend either one for its mix of battery life, flexible cameras, and near-stock Android skin. Nothing\u2019s transparent design continues to win me over, too, even if there\u2019s not much purpose behind the style. I\u2019d even tell a prospective buyer to give either the Phone 3a or 3a Pro a try just for the convenience of the Essential Space \u2014 and I\u2019d actually have to do so since the reliance on the hardware button means that the feature isn\u2019t backwards compatible. I\u2019d sway most people to the $379 Nothing Phone 3a over the $459 Phone 3a Pro simply due to the price difference helping alleviate some of the minor gripes like a limited IP rating and software policy, plus the latter\u2019s beefy camera bump. But despite those grumbles, there\u2019s not a truly glaring issue on either budget phone, given the price points\u2026 right up until you want to use one in the United States.\nUnfortunately, despite everything that I\u2019ve loved about my time with both of Nothing\u2019s Phone 3a models, they pretty much hit a hard stop when it comes to my actually using them and recommending them to people here in the US. Due to the continued reliance on launching devices in the US as part of a \u201cbeta program,\u201d neither the Phone 3a nor the Phone 3a Pro comes with complete band support across all three major carriers. Yes, the coverage is getting better, as I detailed earlier \u2014 Nothing now boasts coverage for most of the required bands for AT&T and is finally taking a crack at 5G support for Verizon \u2014 but the 14-day return policy might not be long enough for you to decide whether your new Nothing Phone has the band scope to work well in your area, and that\u2019s after already jumping through annoying hoops to get there in the first place.\nThe Phone 3a series is Nothing at its best, but only if you live outside of the US... again.\nIf it does, though, or you live in a region with official support, it\u2019s extremely easy for me to tell you to pick up the Phone 3a or the 3a Pro. I prefer the much smaller camera bump and the slightly more fun color options of the Phone 3a, but you might find yourself drawn to the somewhat better flexibility of the Phone 3a Pro. Either way, you\u2019ll get a matching experience under the hood, along with wired charging that runs circles around Motorola and Samsung at this price point, and the Glyph Interface will keep people turning their heads to look at what you\u2019re carrying. I just wish I could give these phones a glowing endorsement for US buyers \u2014 and I really hope Nothing listens and embraces the market here sooner rather than later (perhaps with the Nothing Phone 3!)\nThankfully, the world is your oyster for great alternatives. Both Samsung and Motorola continue to raise their respective budget games, with the former onto the Galaxy Ax6 series of its affordable lineup. The Galaxy A36 5G ($399.99 at Amazon) is probably your best bet for US-based buyers, though it comes with some tradeoffs compared to the Phone 3a lineup. Samsung will give you significantly more software updates (up to six compared to just three), but you\u2019ll lose the high-resolution telephoto sensor in favor of just a 5MP macro shooter, and you\u2019ll drop from a Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chipset to a Snapdragon 6 Gen 3. On the bright side, Samsung\u2019s $400 smartphone packs Gorilla Glass Victus Plus on both the front and back for a little extra durability.\nMotorola\u2019s recent Moto G Power (2025) ($299.99 at Amazon) is another good, slightly cheaper option, mixing impressive IP68 and IP69 protection with an eye-catching vegan leather finish. It takes a step further back in terms of processing power, carrying MediaTek\u2019s Dimensity 6300, but it does add wireless charging to the mix, which is nice for flexibility. You can expand beyond the base 128GB of storage, too, thanks to a microSD slot. Remember that it\u2019s only in line for a pair of major Android updates, so you\u2019ll hit the end of the phone\u2019s lifespan even faster than the Nothing Phone 3a.\nIf you have more money to spend, it gets easier to recommend some truly excellent alternatives to Nothing\u2019s Phone 3a series. Google\u2019s upcoming Pixel 9a ($499 at Amazon) is priced very competitively against the Phone 3a Pro, even if it comes without the benefit of a zoom camera. What you do get, however, is the light, smooth Pixel UI experience with plenty of software updates in the pipeline and a freshly streamlined design. We\u2019re still waiting to get our hands on the Pixel 9a to see how its latest round of Gemini features stacks up and whether or not we genuinely miss the camera bar, but at $499, the price feels right for the peace of mind of a phone that works in the US.\nStepping up even further, the OnePlus 13R ($599.99 at OnePlus) and Apple iPhone 16e ($599 at eBay) might be worthwhile, albeit for very different reasons. OnePlus\u2019s mid-ranger is an excellent bet for its stacked spec sheet, which is pretty much copied and pasted from a 2024 flagship. It packs some of the fastest charging you can get and still comes with a charger in the box \u2014 even if it\u2019s a USB-A block. OnePlus has also taken steps to lighten its Oxygen OS skin, making it feel a little bit more like the OnePlus we fell in love with. Apple\u2019s new mid-range iPhone is a little different, combining flagship internals with the body of a much older iPhone \u2014 something like an iPhone 13 if you will. It comes ready for Apple Intelligence and will get years and years of updates, you just have to decide whether or not you can live with a notched display and a single rear camera.\n- Triple camera setup\n- Excellent Essential Space\n- Clean Nothing OS\n- Fast wired charging\n- Eye-catching design\n- Limited, unofficial US carrier support\n- No wireless charging\n- Only IP64\n- Triple camera setup with dedicated zoom\n- Excellent Essential Space\n- Clean Nothing OS\n- Fast wired charging\n- Eye-catching design\n- Limited, unofficial US carrier support\n- 3a Pro top heavy due to hefty camera bump\n- No wireless charging\n- Only IP64\nThank you for being part of our community.
