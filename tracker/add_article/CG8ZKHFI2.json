      "summary": "The S&P 500 has surged 68% since early 2023, reaching historically high levels that historically precede sharp declines, largely driven by the Magnificent Seven tech giants. Its high Shiller P/E suggests overvaluation, prompting investors to consider the Invesco S&P 500 Equal‑Weight ETF (RSP) as a hedge, which reduces concentration in mega‑caps and offers a more balanced exposure. RSP has outperformed the cap‑weighted index during recent market recoveries and when smaller‑cap stocks outperform, but it lags during strong mega‑cap rallies and carries higher expense ratios. The article highlights RSP’s trade‑off between reduced concentration risk and potentially lower returns in a tech‑heavy market, suggesting it as a strategic option for investors wary of a S&P 500 pullback.",
