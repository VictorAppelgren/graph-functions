  "title": "Why 'One Piece' Fans Are Hyped for Nico Robin's Netflix Debut",
  "description": "Learn more about why fans are declaring Sunday their favorite day of the week before the live-action adaptation of Eiichiro Oda's pirate epic returns in 2026.",
  "content": "Over the weekend, Netflix unveiled the official season two trailer of Eiichiro Oda\u2019s One Piece. It\u2019s laden with peeks at where the Straw Hat Pirates\u2019 odyssey will take them on their trek to uncover the pirate king\u2019s hidden treasure\u2014and fans lost their minds at the first look at a fan-favorite character, Miss All Sunday, aka Nico Robin.\n\nWhile it was announced months ago that Nico Robin would be played by Lera Abova (Honey Don\u2019t!) alongside Joe Manganiello as Mr. O (aka Crocodile), fans had yet to see what Abova would look like as the character.\n\nWith the introduction of a new main character alongside Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji, Netflix viewers may be curious about Robin\u2019s background and story. To satisfy that curiosity without making them wait an entire year, we\u2019ve compiled a brief overview that explains everything you need to know about her and why folks (present company included) are over the moon about her live-action debut.\n\nInitially, Robin is an adversary to the Straw Hats, much like Piccolo from Dragon Ball Z, but she eventually joins their motley crew. Nico Robin is the first adult to join the crew, which is mostly teenagers, with Luffy being the second youngest, excluding fellow recruit to season two, Tony Tony Chopper (Mikaela Hoover). For posterity, Nico Robin is 28 years old, Zoro and Sanji are 19, Nami is 18, Usopp and Luffy are 17, and Chopper is 15. Robin serves as the Straw Hats\u2019 archeologist.\n\nWhere did Nico Robin come from?\n\nRobin hails from the island of Ohara, located in the West Blue. Ohara is home to archaeologists who are dedicated to uncovering the mysteries of the Void Century, a secretive period that is as enigmatic as the location of Gol D. Roger\u2019s One Piece. Unfortunately, the people of Ohara suffered a devastating Buster Call\u2014essentially, the One Piece world\u2019s equivalent of a nuclear attack\u2014ordered by the World Government due to their attempts to reveal the lost history that the government has sought to keep hidden.\n\nWith the help of a friend, Jaguar D. Saul, Robin managed to escape the Buster Call, but she tragically lost her mother, Nico Olvia, in the process. Since then, Robin has lived a nomadic life, moving from one pirate ship to another. The bounty on her head, issued by the World Government, branded her a \u201cdevil child\u201d and labeled her presence as a calamity for any vessel that would take her in. As a result, many pirate crews betrayed her for a reward, further deepening her mistrust of her comrades. Even while she was a member of Baroque Works alongside Crocodile, Robin remained wary of any pirate crew.\n\nHow does Robin meet the Straw Hat Crew?\n\nPrior to the Straw Hat crew\u2019s journey to Alabasta, Robin makes an explosive appearance on the Going Merry. While her presence is mostly to tease the crew, stealing Luffy\u2019s treasured straw hat and wearing it atop her own cowboy hat, her purpose is to intimidate the pirate crew from foiling Baroque Works\u2019 political siege of Alabasta. Her warning is especially pointed at former Baroque Works member and princess of Alabasta, Miss Wednesday, aka Vivi Nefertani (Charithra Chandran). Because Robin committed the cardinal sin of making a friend of the Straw Hats sad, her plan goes up in smoke, but it does lay the groundwork for her fascination with how Luffy\u2019s crew operates in contrast with other pirate crews she\u2019s had the displeasure of working with.\n\nSimilar to Luffy, Nico Robin possesses a Devil Fruit power. Her Flower-Flower Fruit ability allows her to replicate any part of her body onto nearby surfaces. Throughout the series, she has utilized this power for various purposes, including espionage, binding enemies, and even sprouting hand wings for flight.\n\nWhile Robin is complicit in being a passive force in Baroque Works\u2019 crusade of the Kingdom of Alabasta, her true goal is to uncover the truth behind the Void History. Fortunately for her, clues about the Void Century are etched in large granite slabs called Polnegriphs located at the heart of Alabasta and other kingdoms the Straw Hats venture toward on their hunt for the One Piece. Upon encouragement of Luffy, as he\u2019s wont to do, Robin joins up with the Straw Hats as their seventh member out of convenience before becoming a stable member of the crew when they learn about her tragic backstory and declare war on the World Government. If you thought Nami\u2019s watershed moment with Luffy and the crew in Arlong Park was a tear-jerker, you haven\u2019t seen anything yet.\n\nOne Piece mania is in full swing: season two of the live-action series is set to premiere next year, a third season is already in development, there\u2019s an anime remake in the works, the original manga and anime are still captivating fans weekly, a brand-new LEGO set is now available, and a sequel anime focusing on its heroines in development. And there are countless ways to explore the world of the Straw Hats. For fans eager to learn more about the crew\u2019s brilliant archaeologist, they\u2019ll find themselves spoiled for choice on which medium they\u2019d prefer to get to know Miss All Sunday.\n\nOne Piece season two releases on Netflix in 2026.",

      "text": "\u201cStar Wars! Nothing but Star Wars! Give me those Star Wars! Don\u2019t let them end\u2026\u201d Just as Bill Murray said it in 1978, we\u2019re still saying it today. Star Wars is everywhere these days, with multiple movies and TV shows in the works from Disney and Lucasfilm. This article will give you the most up-to-date Star Wars release dates so you know exactly when every new Star Wars movie or Disney+ show will arrive.\nWhat are the next three movies? What TV shows are coming up? Have any TV shows or movies been canceled? What are people saying about what\u2019s next? We\u2019ve got you covered on all things in a galaxy far, far away.\nThis post was last updated on 9/13/2023.\nWhat\u2019s the next Star Wars movie?\nSharmeen Obaid-Chioy\u2019s New Jedi Order Film Film\nRelease Date: TBD, but May 26, 2026, December 18, 2026 or December 17, 2027 (In Theaters)\nAt Star Wars Celebration 2023 in London, Lucasfilm announced that three Star Wars movies are now in the works.\nJames Mangold (Indiana Jones 5) will direct a film 25,000 years before any known Star Wars timeline about the first Jedi to use the Force.\nDave Filoni will direct a film that\u2019s kind of the Star Wars Disney+ Avengers, telling the story of a climactic event meeting the stories of The Book of Boba Fett, The Mandalorian, Ahsoka and more in the time between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens.\nAnd Sharmeen Obaid-Chioy will direct a film set 15 years after the events of The Rise of Skywalker following Rey (Daisy Ridley) as she creates a New Jedi Order.\nThis last one, we think, is the film that Damon Lindelof (Lost, The Leftovers, Watchmen) was co-writingwith Justin Britt-Gibson before departing the project. Steven Knight is now reportedly writing.\nA week after the news of these films first broke, it began to seem like the Rey project by Obaid-Chioy could be the first one out of the gate. However, in June, Disney shuffled its release schedule and moved its December 2025 Star Wars movie to May 2026, and added a third Star Wars movie to the schedule in December 2026. So maybe these three movies are on those dates. We\u2019ll see.\nUpcoming Star Wars release dates\nThese shows and movies have all been officially announced and are in various stages of production, even if we don\u2019t know when they will definitely come out.\nStar Wars: Ahsoka\nRelease Date: Now Playing (On Disney+)\nThe first full live-action Ahsoka Tano show from co-creator Dave Filoni is finally here. Rosario Dawson is, of course, returning. And our first look at footage confirmed that actress Natasha Liu Bordizzo has been cast as Sabine Wren; more recently, Eman Esfandi was confirmed as Ezra Bridger. At Star Wars Celebration this year we learned Mary Elizabeth Winstead is playing Hera Syndulla, Lars Mikkelsenis playing Grand Admiral Thrawn and Wes Chatham is his right-hand man.\nWhat does that all mean? Well, in the first teaser trailer, you can see she\u2019ll make good onthe Star Wars Rebels finale and go after Thrawn. And what about the fact she knows Luke Skywalker now? And how does Ray Stevenson\u2019s lightsaber-wielding character fit in?\nThe show is now airing on Disney+ and here you can read our weekly recaps:\nEpisode 1, \u201cMaster and Apprentice: and Episode 2, \u201cToil and Trouble\u201d\nEpisode 6, premiering September 19\nEpisode 7, premiering September 26\nEpisode 7, premiering October 3\nStar Wars: Skeleton Crew\nRelease Date: 2023 (On Disney+)\nCreated by Spider-Man Homecoming/Far From Home/No Way Home director Jon Watts along with writer Chris Ford, this mystery Star Wars show is now currently in development. The title for the show was released during the Star Wars Celebration, and was previously internally referred as \u201cGrammar Radio.\u201d Celebration also revealed its headlining star, Jude Law.\nSet after the events of Return of the Jedi, Skeleton Crew is described as an adventure in the mold of Amblin adventures of the 1980s. The show will be about seeing the galaxy through the eyes of children (but it is not a kids show), and will follow a group of children who get lost in the galaxy and try to find their way home. Jon Watts explained that the series will take place during the same time period as the upcoming Ahsoka series and The Mandalorian.\nFilming on the series began in 2022 and ended in early 2023. And though not much is know about what happens on the show,it has been revealed that The Daniels, the Oscar-winning directors of Everything Everywhere All At Once, directed an episode. Ditto David Lowery, who did the film The Green Knight. Read more about the show here.\nio9 saw the first footage at Star Wars Celebration 2023 and you can read about it here. Three of the main stars of the show are played by Ravi Cabot-Conyers, Kyriana Kratter, and Robert Timothy Smit. Rumors suggest it could debut in November or December 2023.\nStar Wars: The Acolyte\nRelease Date: 2024 (On Disney+)\nRussian Doll co-creator Leslye Headland will be the first person to bring the excellent High Republic timeline into live-action with this show, long rumored to star Amandla Stenberg before an actual confirmation finally arrived at San Diego Comic-Con 2022\u2014one of few Star Wars bits of news to emerge from the convention.\nIn an interview in 2022, Headland revealed the show would be about 100 years before the events of The Phantom Menace. \u201cA lot of those characters haven\u2019t even been born yet,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a look at the political and personal and spiritual things that came up in a time period that we don\u2019t know much about. My question when watching The Phantom Menace was always like, \u2018Well, how did things get to this point?\u2019 How did we get to a point where a Sith lord can infiltrate the Senate and none of the Jedi pick up on it? Like, what went wrong? What are the scenarios that led us to this moment?\u201d\nIn an interview released later, Headland spoke about her goals for the series. For Headland, above all else The Acolyte is a mystery, and that mystery is figuring out what is going on in this peak period. It was also suggested that The Acolyte will bring more elements from the Expanded Universe to canon, but what parts that will be incorporated will remain to be seen.\nIn September 2022, both Jodie Turner-Smith and Squid Game\u2019s Emmy-winning Lee Jung-Jae joined the cast, with an official announcement in November adding Carrie-Anne Moss, Manny Jacinto, and others to the roster. The first image, which you see above, was released in November and you can read about the first footage here, which was shown at Star Wars Celebration 2023.\nAnd no, despite what bullcrap rumors you may have been reading online, the show has not been canceled.\nAndor: Season 2\nRelease Date: August 2024 (On Disney+)\nSeason one of Tony Gilroy\u2019s Rogue One prequel starring Diego Luna showed an excitingly different side of Star Wars. Season two will reportedly be spread across the four years leading up to Rogue One, with four episodes covering each year in Cassian Andor\u2019s life until that fateful point. Filming began in late 2022.\nAt Star Wars Celebration 2023, Gilroy announced the show should be out in August 2024 and showed fans the first footage from the season. Read about it here. Plus, the final episodes of the season/series will take place just days before Rogue One, leading right into that story.\nOne minor hiccup though, due to the Writer\u2019s Guild strike, showrunner and head writer Tony Gilroy left his duties show in May 2023. He\u2019s unlikely to return until the Writer\u2019s Strike is over, which could cause a delay.\nStar Wars: A Droid Story\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nLucasfilm Animation is teaming up with Industrial Light and Magic for this streaming show that will \u201cintroduce us to a new hero, guided by legendary duo R2-D2 and C-3PO.\u201d We don\u2019t know anything beyond that and there hasn\u2019t been a significant update in years, which could be a good thing or bad thing.\nStar Wars: Lando\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nWay back in December 2020, Disney announced a bunch of Star Wars TV shows. Among them was a Lando show which, at the time, was going to be made by Dear White People creator Justin Simien. After that, things went quiet for about three years. Then,in an April 2023 article, Donald Glover hinted that he\u2019s still interested and it\u2019s still possible in the works. A May 2023 interview with Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy confirmed it\u2019s still in the works.\nThe first significant update in almost three years came in July when news broke that Simien has been off the project since he started working on Haunted Mansion, and not only is Donald Glover going to star in the series, he\u2019s co-writing it with his brother Stephen.\nUntitled Taika Waititi Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nIn May 2020, news broke that Oscar-winning director of Thor: Ragnarok would be helming and co-writing along with Krysty Wilson-Cairns. \u201cTaika\u2019s approach to Star Wars will be fresh, unexpected, and \u2026 unique,\u201d Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said. \u201cHis enormous talent and sense of humor will ensure that audiences are in for an unforgettable ride.\u201d\nThere was a time when this was likely to be the next Star Wars film but, after Star Wars Celebration 2023, it seems like it\u2019s now on the back burner. That was confirmed by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy who said the Oscar-winner is still working on the film, it\u2019s just going slowly.\nIn the past, Waititi has discussed some broad ideas of what he wants to do with his upcoming film. Read those below.\nTaika Waititi Doesn\u2019t Want Star Wars to Rely on Legacies\nAre You as Confused About Taika Waititi\u2019s Star WarsMovie as We Are?\nUntitled Dave Filoni Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nWe mentioned this one above but, at some point, Dave Filoni will be directing a film that is meant to be a climactic event wrapping up stories that have begun on shows he\u2019s involved with such as The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, The Book of Boba Fett, Skeleton Crew and others.\nUntitled James Mangold Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nThis was one of the three films announced at Star Wars Celebration but, like Filoni\u2019s, isn\u2019t likely to be next. This one is set 25,000 years before the original trilogy and tells the story of the first person to use the Force.\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s about, I want to be part of the saga, but I also don\u2019t want to be holding so much lore in the air that you can hardly tell a story,\u201d Mangold told io9 when asked about this film. \u201cAnd what I really wanted to do\u2026was just can we make a kind of the Ten Commandments of the Force, you know? A kind of origin story of how the Force came to be known, understood, wielded, and harnessed.\u201d We love this idea so much we even wrote about it.\nStar Wars Movies and TV Shows That Are Currently Unscheduled and Haven\u2019t Been Officially Announced, But We Think Are Still Happening\nThe Mandalorian Season 4\nRelease Date: TBD\nWith The Mandalorian Season 3 now in the books, all eyes look ahead to season 4. However, the season has not yet been officially announced. Unofficially though, series creator Jon Favreau said he\u2019s already written a fourth season which he probably wouldn\u2019t have done just for fun. It\u2019s coming. It\u2019s just a matter of when, especially with writers and actors on strike.\nThe Book of Boba Fett Season 2\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nThe Book of Boba Fett season one ended with the implication that we\u2019d see more of these character in the future. But alas, there has been no official announcement\u2026 yet. Dive into the making-of season one while we wait and ponder the words of executive producer Robert Rodriguez who said he knows when the character is coming back, but he can\u2019t say when.\nUntitled Shawn Levy Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nShawn Levy, the prolific director and producer behind Stranger Things, Night at the Museum, and Free Guy is gearing up to develop a film in a galaxy far far away. He\u2019ll focus on that after completing Deadpool 3, which stars Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman.\nStar Wars Movies and TV Shows That Are Currently Unscheduled and Probably NOT Going To Happen\nStar Wars: Rangers of the New Republic\nOriginally announced alongside shows like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ahsoka, and Andor, Rangers of the New Republic was rumored to be Cara Dune\u2019s show which would tie into The Mandalorian and Book of Boba Fett. However, with actress Gina Carano no longer a part of Star Wars, word on the street is this will no longer be happening. Nothing is official though.\nUntitled Rian Johnson Trilogy\nLet\u2019s be honest. Do we think this is happening anymore? Probably not. Rian Johnson has moved on to other things. But, until we hear otherwise (and no one is officially saying), we\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t mention that before the divisive release of The Last Jedi, Lucasfilm officially said Johnson would make his very own trilogy. It hasn\u2019t officially been canceled yet but, in a new interview, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy suggested that it\u2019s been placed on the back burner as Johnson does other things. With Johnson\u2019s next film, Glass Onion, set for release in late 2022 though, he\u2019s been quoted saying he still hopes these movies happen. So do we.\nStar Wars: Rogue Squadron\nFor several years, Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins\u2019 film about pilots in the Star Wars universe has been earmarked as the next film. Well, that\u2019s no longer the case. After months of rumors suggesting it might move off its 2023 release date, Disney officially took it off the schedule. On December 13 2022, Jenkins said the movie is still in \u201cactive development\u201d but recent news suggests it\u2019s dead. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy disagrees, saying in May 2023 it\u2019s still on the books.\nUntitled Kevin Feige Movie\nMarvel Studios President Kevin Feige is best known for helping create the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But as much as he loves Marvel, he loves Star Wars even more. And so it was exciting to hear that he was producing a Star Wars movie and even recruited Loki and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness writer Michael Waldron to help him. Feige doesn\u2019t like to even acknowledge this project though and in a 2022 interview, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy also tiptoed around the project\u2019s existence. Then, a few weeks before Star Wars Celebration 2023, we learned the project is likely dead.\nFor more, check out io9\u2019s list of every canceled (or re-worked) Disney Star Wars project.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "- For the chapter of the same name, see Chapter 393.\nNico Olvia was the mother of Nico Robin,[1] the older sister of Oran and paternal aunt of Mizuira,[5] and an archaeologist from Ohara who studied the Poneglyphs two decades ago.[2]\nWhile travelling around the ocean with a group of fellow archaeologists, Olvia was captured by the Marines for conducting forbidden research. She was able to return to Ohara and briefly reunite with her daughter with the help of Jaguar D. Saul, before perishing alongside the other Ohara archaeologists due to the Buster Call.[6]\nQuick Answers\nWhat was Nico Olvia's profession before she was captured by the Marines?\nWhat forbidden research was Nico Olvia conducting that led to her capture?\nHow did Nico Olvia manage to return to Ohara and reunite with her daughter?\nWho helped Nico Olvia return to Ohara and reunite with her daughter?\nWhat is the relationship between Nico Olvia and Nico Robin?\nAppearance[]\nNico Olvia resembled her daughter (before timeskip appearance) in many ways: they shared almost identical facial and physical features, and had identically shaped and colored eyes (brown in the manga and blue in the anime). However, Olvia's hair was white instead of black. Her hair was also longer and slightly curly, and in the anime, she had a lighter skin tone.[1] When she departed from Ohara in order to find the Poneglyphs, she had shorter hair.[5]\nWhen she returned from her prison, she sported a completely different attire, consisting of a fur-lined coat over a light blue T-shirt which is slightly too short for her, exposing an inch of her bare midriff and long green trousers. Around her waist, she had a belt decorated by many golden disk-like ornaments. A modest necklace with a thin rope and three little pearls on it circled her neck.[2]\nPersonality[]\nNico Olvia was well aware of the World Government's hostility against Ohara, and was conscious of the fact that searching for the Poneglyphs would be dangerous. Despite that, she set sail, wanting to let the world know the true history and the events that occurred during the Void Century, and endured the imprisonment without confessing, proving herself as a brave and determined woman.\nShe was also very attached to her daughter, Robin, and the decision to leave hurt her very much. However, she did not lose hope and was willing to remain behind during the fire in the Tree of Knowledge in order to save the books, while sending Robin away with Saul, in order to give her daughter a chance to live to the fullest and to discover the true history and hand it down to others.[7]\nRelationships[]\nFamily[]\nNico Robin[]\nShe was the mother of Nico Robin,[1] and was very fond of her daughter. However, her life's work called her away, forcing her to leave Robin behind.[8] She regretted never being there for Robin, but died proud of her for being an amazing, smart child, who could even decipher Poneglyphs.[9]\nHusband[]\nOlvia's husband died many years before the storyline began. However, it can be assumed that she held him in high regard, as she left Ohara to study the Poneglyphs in order to honor his wishes.[8] The absence of him from Robin's flashback suggests that he died before she was born, or when she was too young to remember him.[10]\nOran and Roji[]\nOran accepted responsibility of Robin's care upon Olvia's departure, although his wife was against it.[5][11]\nFriends[]\nJaguar D. Saul[]\nOlvia initially held the giant Vice Admiral in contempt for murdering her colleagues and blindly complying with the World Government's policies without knowledge of the entire situation. Despite still resenting Saul after he released her from incarceration, she was concerned enough to warn him that he could never return to the Marines due to his treasonous actions.[12] Olvia finally trusted him by requesting Saul to protect her daughter and evacuate her from Ohara.[13]\nAbilities and Powers[]\nAs a scholar from Ohara, Olvia had the skills to read Poneglyphs, thus being one of the few people with the ability to discover the truth about the Void Century, and the exact locations of the ancient weapons. As an archaeologist, she had considerable knowledge of history.\nShe had proven herself as a determined woman: she withstood imprisonment at the hands of the World Government without confessing that she was from Ohara, and with the help of Saul was able to escape and return to her homeland. She also has great endurance, as she sustained a beating from two CP9 members and was still able to stand up and help her companions to move books from the Tree of Knowledge to the nearby lake in order to conserve them.\nShe also had some skill in wielding a rifle. She managed to shoot through the cloth of Spandine's coat without hurting him, but just as a way of intimidating him. Olvia was confident she would have hit him with the next shot if she had the chance.[14]\nHistory[]\nAt the age of twenty-seven, after her husband died, she set out on a six-year journey to research the Poneglyph along with thirty three other archaeologists. Although she found it regrettable that she had to leave Robin, it was something she felt she had to do. She left Robin in her brother and his wife's care.[8]\nAt the end of the sixth year of the expedition, her ship was caught by the Marines. Her colleagues fought back to defend Olvia and all were killed except for her.[15][16] From the moment of capture, her fate was determined.[1] Olvia was interrogated by Jaguar D. Saul, and imprisoned. She was then set free by Saul who was disgusted by the World Government's Justice system and managed to get away with the Marine's ship. She was grateful to the giant; however, she refused to forgive him for the actions he and his men committed to stop the expeditions and for killing her comrades.[17]\nUpon arriving at Ohara, Olvia went to the Tree of Knowledge's library. She apologized to her colleagues for failing in the expedition and for pitting the World Government against Ohara, but they instead apologized to Olvia for sending her on such a dangerous journey, and remarked that the World Government had always been against the scholars, as they knew how to read Poneglyphs and as such, how to presumably come into possession of the Ancient Weapons.\nAs she was warning them about the threat they were under, she heard that a World Government ship had docked on the shore. She grabbed a rifle from a rack and ran, unaware that her daughter Robin was running past her at that exact moment going the opposite way.[18]\nShe later reached Spandine, and shot him in his jacket's sleeve to intimidate him. The CP9 leader explained to her that all of the World Government battleships were there in order to destroy Ohara, as a warning to all those who researched the Poneglyphs, and then ordered his subordinates to take her down. She was knocked out and arrested. She was then thrown before the faces of the incapacitated scholars, so as to force them to show their association with the woman and automatically prove their \"guilt\".[19]\nAfter the truth was spoken to the World Government by Clover, Olvia was confronted by Robin as she was being taken away and finally, after Robin's pleas, she admitted her relationship with her. As the Buster Call was about to begin, Spandine ordered that she be taken with them,[20] but panicked after being almost directly hit by an explosion and ran off.\nNico Olvia was left behind and was finally reunited with her daughter. She hugged her and remarked that she was very proud of her. She then pleaded to Saul to take Robin to safety and told Robin to continue to live, to hand down the history to others, and to live her life to the fullest.[21]\nShe assisted the other scholars in the Tree of Knowledge. As it burned down around them, she thought that she did not even leave her daughter with words said as a mother.[22] After that, the tree fell and she along with the rest of the scholars were presumed to have perished.[6]\nTrivia[]\n- The name Olvia may be a reference to Olbia (also spelled \u30aa\u30eb\u30d3\u30a2, Orubia in Japanese), an archaeological site of an ancient Greek city in Ukraine, fitting her profession as an archeologist.\n- It should be noted that when Robin's updated (pre-timeskip) wanted poster was released, the picture looks strikingly similar to how Olvia's poster did. The shot focuses on the right side of her face which is placed towards the left of the shot, with some sort of destructive implications in the background (flames in Olvia's poster, heavy smoke in Robin's).\n- She shares her birthday and her first (and only) bounty with her daughter.[4]\n- In the Japanese and English anime, she has the same voice actress as Robin.\n- Nico Olvia ranked at 44th place in the third popularity poll, 122nd in the fourth, 108th in the sixth, and 160th in the seventh.\n- Olvia's favorite foods are sugar toast and coffee.[3]\nReferences[]\n- \u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 392 (p. 7) and Episode 275, Olvia is first seen in her wanted poster.\n- \u2191 2.0 2.1 2.2 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 393 (p. 9) and Episode 275, Olvia is introduced.\n- \u2191 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 Vivre Card - One Piece Visual Dictionary (Card #0431), Information about Olvia is revealed.\n- \u2191 4.0 4.1 One Piece Blue Deep: Characters World (p. 124), Olvia's birthday is revealed.\n- \u2191 5.0 5.1 5.2 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 393 (p. 14) and Episode 276.\n- \u2191 6.0 6.1 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 398 (p. 2) and Episode 278.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 396 (p. 8-11) and Episode 277.\n- \u2191 8.0 8.1 8.2 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 393 (p. 13-14) and Episode 276, Robin is left behind.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 396 (p. 5-6) and Episode 277.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 395 (p. 15) and Episode 277.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 395 (p. 14) and Episode 277.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 396 (p. 13-15) and Episode 277.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 396 (p. 8) and Episode 277.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 394 (p. 8) and Episode 276.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 393 (p. 9-10) and Episode 276, The story and fate of Olvia's comrades.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 396 (p. 12-13) and Episode 277.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 396 (p. 12-15) and Episode 277.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 393 (p. 8-13, 15-16, 18) and Episode 276.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 394 (p. 8-11, 15-16, 18) and Episode 276.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 395 (p. 13-18) and Episode 277, Olvia and Robin reunited.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 396 (p. 3-11) and Episode 277.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 397 (p. 16) and Episode 278.\n[]\n| |||||||\n| |||||||\n|\nWest Blue Inhabitants | |||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| |||||||||||||\n| |||||||||||||\n|\n| |||||||||\n| |||||||||\n|\n| |||||||||||||||||||||||\n| |||||||||||||||||||||||\n| |||||||||||||||||||||||\n|"

We also know Blade appeared (or at least his voice did) in the end credits of The Eternals.

Shawn Levy (Free Guy) is directing.\nFantastic Four\nRelease date: May 2, 2025 (In theaters)\nPhase Six of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, kicks off with the MCU debut of Marvel\u2019s most famous family. Jon Watts was scheduled to directbut he is no longer doing that\u2014Matt Shakaman of WandaVision is now in the chair\u2014and though we saw John Krasinski as Mr. Fantastic in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, there\u2019s no guarantee he returns.\nAvengers: The Kang Dynasty\nRelease date: May 1, 2026 (In theaters)\nSince neither Phase Four or Phase Five ended with Avengers movies, Phase Six will end with two, back to back.

Marvel and Disney have yet to confirm.\nMarvel Zombies\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nThis new animated show is loosely spun out from a breakout episode of What If? that saw MCU heroes battling a zombie apocalypse.\nSpider-Man: Freshman Year\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nDisney says this new animated series follows Peter Parker \u201con his way to becoming Spider-Man in the MCU, with a journey unlike we\u2019ve ever seen and a style that celebrates the character\u2019s early comic book roots.\u201d\nWhat if\u2026? Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nThe speculative animated series and its omnipresent narrator the Watcher will return with an all-new season.

It also made a ton of money, so a sequel is inevitable. That the film\u2019s director is making Avengers: The Kang Dynasty does throw it into limbo a bit.\nUntitled Wonder Man series\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nMarvel Studios has announced that it\u2019s moving ahead with a Wonder Man series.

His announcement in May 2022 makes him the first Black male actor to play the character on-screen.\nGatwa will star in Doctor Who\u2019s 14th season, set to air some time in 2024.\nMillie Gibson will co-star as the 15th Doctor\u2019s companion.\nGame of Thrones star Indira Varma will play a mysterious character known as \u201cthe Duchess.\u201d\nDoctor Who\u2019s beloved tradition of doing a Christmas Special\u2014no more New Year\u2019s Day Specials, in other words\u2014will return in 2023, with another confirmed for 2024.\nComedian Sooz Kempner will star in Doom\u2019s Day, a new transmedia Doctor Who campaign tied into the anniversary. She\u2019ll play Doom, the titular intergalactic assassin, who has found herself hunted by Death itself\u2014and must use a purloined vortex manipulator with a day\u2019s worth of time-jumping charge to find the Doctor and save herself.\nThis post was last updated 5/30/23.\nWhat\u2019s Been Going on in Doctor Who?\nThree Doctor Who specials aired out the last days of Jodie Whittaker\u2019s time as the Doctor in 2022. \u201cEve of the Daleks\u201d saw the Doctor and her companions Dan (introduced in the prior 13th season, known as Doctor Who: Flux) and Yaz facing the titular iconic monsters in a time loop paradox. \u201cLegend of the Sea Devils\u201d revived the classic \u201870s monsters for a new adventure, while \u201cPower of the Doctor\u201d saw the 13th Doctor face off against the Master in an adventure that ultimately saw her mortally wounded, returning her companions to contemporary Earth while she regenerated into a new body.\nWhy Is David Tennant the Doctor Again? Is David Tennant Playing the 10th Doctor?\nWhittaker regenerated not into previously announced new Doctor Ncuti Gatwa, but David Tennant, who played the official 10th incarnation of the Time Lord from Christmas 2005 to New Year\u2019s Day 2010, before reprising the role for Doctor Who\u2019s 50th anniversary special, \u201cThe Day of the Doctor,\u201d in 2013.\nWhile this marks his first return on-screen in the series since then, Tennant will not be playing the 10th Doctor, but the official 14th incarnation\u2014and the character will be aware that they are both using a familiar form and are a new entity. Aside from the fact that Tennant is arguably the most popular actor to take on the role, so bringing him back for the 60th anniversary makes sense, there\u2019s plenty of reasons Doctor Who can come up with as to why the Doctor\u2019s regenerative process decided to re-use an old identity, more of which you can read about here.\nWhen Will Doctor Who Return in 2023?\nDoctor Who will return for three special episodes in November 2023, set to air in celebration of the series\u2019 60th anniversary.\nWhat Is Doctor Who\u2019s 60th Anniversary Special About?\nAside from Tennant returning as the Doctor, he\u2019ll be joined by former companions Donna Noble and Wilfred Mott, played by Catherine Tate and Bernard Cribbins (the actor\u2019s last role prior to his passing in July 2022) in Doctor Who\u2019s fourth season. Donna exited the series as a regular character after an adventure lead to her needing to have her memory wiped by the 10th Doctor, forgetting her time alongside him lest her mind face grievous harm, so just how Donna will play into the the story remains to be seen.\nThe Doctor and Donna will face a mysterious new adversary, played by Neil Patrick Harris, and will be joined in the specials by Yasmin Finney as a new character named Rose. How Finney\u2019s Rose might connect to the other famous Rose of Doctor Who, Billie Piper\u2019s Rose Tyler, also remains to be seen.\nIs There a Trailer for Doctor Who\u2019s 60th Anniversary?\nThe first premiered at the end of \u201cThe Power of the Doctor,\u201d and you can watch it above. The second premiered in December and you can watch it here:\nWhen Will Ncuti Gatwa Become the Doctor?\nGatwa is briefly seen in the trailer for Doctor Who\u2019s 60th anniversary, so will presumably follow the long tradition of new Doctors appearing in the final moments of their predecessor\u2019s last episodes to become the 15th Doctor. The BBC has announced that Gatwa will appear as the Doctor first \u201cover the festive season\u201d in 2023, before he takes over full-time in a new season of the show after that.\nIs There a Doctor Who Season 14 Release Date?\nThere\u2019s no current release date for season 14 of Doctor Who, but it is expected to be broadcast some time in 2024.\nWhere Is Doctor Who Streaming in the U.S. and UK?\nCurrently, the first 13 seasons of the revived Doctor Who are streaming on the BBC iPlayer in the UK; in the U.S., the revived series streams exclusively on HBO Max. In both countries, episodes from the classic era of the show are available through Britbox.\nThis will change in 2023, at least in the U.S. The BBC and Disney have announced that as part of a new deal, Doctor Who will stream exclusively worldwide on Disney+, except for in the UK and Ireland, where it will still stream on the BBC iPlayer and BBC One. It\u2019s currently unknown if this will affect Doctor Who\u2019s place on BBC America, where it currently airs in the U.S..\nDoes Disney Co-Own Doctor Who Now?\nA report in the wake of the BBC/Disney announcement from British paper the Telegraph alleged that the deal will also see Disney contribute finances to help create the show, and while the series\u2019 creative team will still hold control of the series primarily, the deal will allow Disney some level of say in the creative decisions for the series\u2014as well as allowing access to talent or \u201ccinematic production moments\u201d previously inaccessible due to the BBC\u2019s budget for the show.\nNone of this has been confirmed by the BBC, however. The announcement strictly focused on Disney\u2019s acquisition of Doctor Who\u2019s streaming rights, and did not mention any co-owning. The new era of the series will be made for the BBC by Bad Wolf Studios, created by former Doctor Who producer Julie Gardner and former BBC Controller of Fiction Jane Tranter\u2014which is now owned by Sony Pictures Television, after the studio took a majority stake in Bad Wolf in December 2021. The series was previously made by BBC Studios directly.\nIn January, Davies did say that Doctor Who is now working with a bigger budget, telling GQ that Disney\u2019s involvement came about as part of \u201cthe BBC\u2019s notion to go for a streamer to invest in the show worldwide \u2026 We\u2019re not on the budget level with Star Wars and the Marvel shows, [but] it\u2019s better than it was \u2026 We\u2019re not allowed to talk about budget\u2026 but it\u2019s more than I\u2019ve ever had to work with.\u201d\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "Ohara is an island located in West Blue.[1] The island consisted primarily of archaeologists, and is the birthplace of Nico Robin.\nThe island's surface was destroyed 22 years ago by a Buster Call. This is an important event behind the ongoings of the Water 7 Saga with far-reaching consequences in the Final Saga.[2]\nLayout and Locations[]\nOhara was notable for the Tree of Knowledge,[3] a 5,000-year-old gigantic library tree.[4] Around it, there was once a town where Nico Robin lived with her aunt, uncle and cousin, as well as some woods and a lake big enough to fit all the books from the Tree of Knowledge.\nFollowing its destruction, Ohara now consists of the charred ruins of the town and the Tree of Knowledge with a memorial put up by Vegapunk and Monkey D. Dragon to honor the victims of the incident.[5] The island also no longer appears on any commercial maps.\nFar to the northeast of Ohara, there is an island where Robin boarded a passenger ship.[6]\nGallery[]\nCitizens[]\n- See also the associated category: Ohara Residents.\nOther Inhabitants | ||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|\nHistory[]\n- Further information: Ohara Incident\nA civilization has existed on Ohara as far back as 5,000 years ago, when the Tree of Knowledge was planted on the island. For millennia, archaeologists thrived there learning about history, a course of action that the World Government permitted.[4]\nIn his younger days, Clover set out from Ohara to research the Void Century. After multiple skirmishes with the Marines and subsequent arrests, Clover returned to the island, followed by various other archaeologists and scholars who had begun working under him.[7]\nEventually, another archaeologist from the island, Nico Olvia, left on her own expedition to find out more about the Void Century, but she was captured by Vice Admiral Jaguar D. Saul. After interrogating her, Saul helped Olvia escape back to her homeland, but accidentally ended up as a castaway on Ohara as well,[4] where he befriended Olvia's daughter, Nico Robin. Meanwhile, the World Government, aware of Olvia's research into forbidden subjects, sent a group of CP9 agents to investigate the archaeologists of Ohara.[4]\nAfter the government discovered that the archaeologists were studying the forbidden Poneglyphs and the Void Century,[8] they ordered the island's destruction via Buster Call.[9] Among the Vice Admirals sent to carry out the attack were Sakazuki, who destroyed an evacuation ship carrying all the civilians in case any archaeologists snuck onboard,[10] and Kuzan,[11] a friend of Saul's. During the destruction, the archaeologists threw many of their books into a lake on the island in an attempt to preserve them.[10]\nWith the island and its residents gone, the government then spread propaganda demonizing the citizens of Ohara, stating that they were attempting to use forbidden knowledge for global destruction. To this end, they used the fact that several Poneglyphs also contain information about the Ancient Weapons as justification and supposed proof of their claims.\nThe only native survivor of Ohara was Nico Robin, who was branded a criminal for her ability to read Poneglyphs. The government also blamed her for the destruction of the evacuation ship and Marine battleships that Saul destroyed. After its destruction, Ohara was erased from all maps.[12]\nSome time soon after the incident, Saul enlisted a group of Elbaph giants to retrieve the books the archaeologists had thrown into the lake, bringing them back to Elbaph. Learning of the Government's actions, the Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon and the scientist Vegapunk both independently visited the island in mourning and to pay their respects to Professor Clover. While there, Vegapunk established a memorial in the archaeologists' honor.[5]\nShips[]\nWhile conducting his international research, Clover used a ship with his name written on the sail.[7]\nWhile the research team was studying the Void Century for six years they sailed on a ship that was destroyed by Jaguar D. Saul and his subordinates, with only Nico Olvia as a survivor.\nDuring the Ohara Incident, the non-archaeologist citizens of Ohara boarded an evacuation ship provided by the World Government, only to be destroyed by cannon fire from Marine battleships under orders by Sakazuki.[10]\nGallery[]\nTrivia[]\n- According to Rurubu One Piece, Ohara may have been inspired by England. It shares this distinction with Foosha Village and Syrup Village.\n- The name \"Ohara\" may come from the Irish surname \"O'Hara\" (also spelled \u30aa\u30cf\u30e9 in Japanese). The leading archeologist of Ohara, Clou D. Clover, is also named and themed around clovers, which are a symbol of Ireland.\n- The way the Marines terminated all the scholars of Ohara and its knowledge could be a reference to the supposed burning of texts in 213 BCE and live burial of 460 Confucian scholars in 212 BCE by the Chinese emperor Qin Shi Huang of the Qin dynasty. This was alleged to have destroyed philosophical treatises of the Hundred Schools of Thought, with the goal of strengthening the official Qin governing philosophy of legalism, similar to how the World Government aimed to strengthen their principle of justice.\nReferences[]\n- \u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 39 Chapter 374 and Episode 263.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 391 (p. 9) and Episode 275, Spandam reveals Ohara was destroyed by a Buster Call.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 391 (p. 18) and Episode 275.\n- \u2191 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 392 and Episode 275.\n- \u2191 5.0 5.1 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 112 Chapter 1134.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 398 (p. 3) and Episode 278.\n- \u2191 7.0 7.1 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 106 Chapter 1066 (p. 6) and Episode 1096.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 394 (p. 18) and Episode 276, CP9 discovers the Poneglyphs.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 395 (p. 11) and Episode 277, A Buster Call is ordered on Ohara.\n- \u2191 10.0 10.1 10.2 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 397 and Episode 278.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 396 (p. 12) and Episode 277, Kuzan is one of the Vice Admirals in the Buster Call.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 111 Chapter 1133 (p. 2-4).\n[]\nOhara | |||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| |||||||\n| |||||||\n|\n|\n| |||||||||||||||||||||||\n| |||||||||||||||||||||||\n| |||||||||||||||||||||||\n|"

      "text": "Netflix finally announced that Bridgerton star Charithra Chandran will join the live-action One Piece season two cast as Miss Wednesday, or Alabasta\u2019s wayward princess Vivi Nefertani. Chandran joins actor Sendhil Ramamurthy, who plays Vivi\u2019s father, Nefertari Cobra. Despite creator Eiichiro Oda publicizing season two not reaching the anime\u2019s next major arc, Alabasta, Netflix\u2019s recent casting announcements suggest the live-action series is continuing the first season\u2019s timeline tweaks.\nHer past is shrouded in secrecy but her skills as a Baroque Works agent are unmatched. Here\u2019s your first look at the face of Miss Wednesday! #OnePieceLiveAction pic.twitter.com/bGxeb1mFP7\n\u2014 ONE PIECE(\u30ef\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30b9) Netflix (@onepiecenetflix) August 23, 2024\nAs mentioned earlier, Netflix\u2019s casting of Miss Wednesday and Nefertani Cobra hint that the live-action adaptation will continue playing with timeline events, the way One Piece\u2018s first season did with Luffy\u2019s grandfather, Admiral Garp (Vincent Regan). Garp isn\u2019t introduced until later in the anime, but the Netflix series portrays him as a major player in the show\u2019s first season. By introducing him way earlier, the live-action series hit two birds with one stone by showcasing Garp and Marine recruit Koby (Morgan Davies)\u2019s relationship as the season\u2019s emotional anchor. A relationship, mind you, that developed off-screen in the anime.\nA similar scenario might be at play with One Piece season two, considering Nefertani Cobra isn\u2019t introduced until after the Drum Island arc, where the season will conclude. Time will tell whether One Piece\u2018s second season, due in 2025, will see breadcrumbs of Vivi and Cobra\u2019s relationship fleshed out like Garp and Koby\u2019s was.\nBased on the smash hit manga series, One Piece is described in Netflix\u2019s official synopsis as follows: \u201cMonkey D. Luffy is a young adventurer who has longed for a life of freedom since he can remember. Luffy sets off from his small village on a perilous journey to find the legendary fabled treasure, One Piece, to become King of the Pirates! But in order to find the ultimate prize, Luffy will need to assemble the crew he\u2019s always wanted before finding a ship to sail, searching every inch of the vast blue seas, outpacing the Marines, and outwitting dangerous rivals at every turn.\u201d\nThis latest bit of One Piece news comes on the heels of Katey Segal\u2019s casting as Dr. Kureha in season two, as well as Mark Harelik as Dr. Hiriluk. Variety also reminds us that Daniel Lasker, Camrus Johnson, Jazzara Jaslyn, David Dastmalchian, Werner Coetser, Brendan Murray, Clive Russell, Callum Kerr, Julia Rehwald, Rob Colletti, and Ty Keogh have also been added to the Netflix anime adaptation. The main cast includes I\u00f1aki Godoy as Monkey D. Luffy, Mackenyu as Zoro, Emily Rudd as Nami, Jacob Romero as Usopp, Taz Skylar as Sanji, Ilia Isorelys Paulino as Alvida, Jeff Ward as Buggy, and Michael Dorman as Gold Roger.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "Even if you haven\u2019t been an ardent One Piece fan for over 25 years, you might have become intrigued by one particular character thanks to his adorable Chibi appearance: Tony Tony Chopper. The global phenomenon manga and anime series can be a daunting task to get into, given the sheer volume of pages and episodes, but Netflix\u2019s live-action adaptation of Eiichiro Oda\u2019s epic has opened up his pirate world to wider audiences. And after Chopper\u2019s live-action hybrid animation reveal at Tudum last weekend, his popularity will no doubt skyrocket based on the cuteness teased through Mikaela Hoover\u2019s instantly endearing performance.\nDon\u2019t be fooled, though; this future member of the Straw Hat Crew is more than an adorable pet mascot medic, he\u2019s one of their greatest fighters and fiercest friends.\nHere\u2019s a quick primer on just who Chopper is ahead of One Piece season two\u2019s premiere in 2026 on Netflix.\nWho is Tony Tony Chopper?\nChopper was an outcast reindeer with a blue nose who ate the Human-Human Fruit, which turned him into a reindeer-human hybrid. This Devil Fruit bestowed him with consciousness, a high level of intelligence, and the ability to pick up on human languages. After he consumed the fruit, Chopper was fully rejected by his herd, a lot like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, except if he had suddenly mutated and could get real jacked.\nWhere did Chopper come from?\nAlone in the wilderness of Drum, Chopper eventually crosses paths with the mad scientist Dr. Hiriluk, who is intrigued by his transformation and asks Chopper to be his assistant. Actor Mark Harelik (Preacher), who was cast as the wild-haired doctor for the Netflix series, described Tony Tony Chopper\u2019 first friend on Instagram as filled with \u201cpassion and persistence\u201d and teased that maybe the doctor shouldn\u2019t be \u201cso eager to try untested experiments\u201d on his patients.\nThis bit of foreshadowing echoes his grim fate, which propels Chopper to learn more about medicine under Dr. Kureha when she takes him in. Katey Sagal (Futurama) plays Kureha, the One Piece favorite who would go on to teach Chopper everything she knows. The team-up between Kureha and Chopper is something we\u2019re really looking forward to in season two.\nHow does Chopper meet the Straw Hat Crew?\nNami falls ill near the Drum Kingdom, and Luffy and the crew seek out help in the frozen expanse. Luckily, they meet Dr. Kureha and Chopper. In exchange for helping cure the Straw Hat\u2019s navigator, the crew assists in freeing Drum Kingdom from its tyrannical ruler. Chopper is reluctant to join the Straw Hats but after being snatched by the Foxy Pirate Crew as a member against his will, Luffy liberates him from that by winning a battle against them.\nHe then gives Chopper the choice to join the Straw Hats of his own free will\u2014and eventually, after a lot of his trademark reluctance at being perceived, he gives in. Much like the preview we saw on Tudum, Chopper has his quirks, like hiding the wrong way or breaking out into a dance when complimented, something he gets visibly ornery over (but secretly loves). We can\u2019t wait to see him visibly struggle to hide his excitement when he finally finds a family with the Straw Hats.\nWhat are Chopper\u2019s powers?\nIn addition to his intelligence, Chopper becomes bi-pedal and stays in the form of a cute pet for the most part. However, he can evolve into three forms (kind of like Pok\u00e9mon evolutions) and can go back to the one of his choosing, which happens to cause a lot of cuteness aggression. The other forms come in handy when the Straw Hats are in battle. Chopper uses \u201cWalk Point,\u201d which heightens his reindeer agility and animalistic senses; \u201cBrain Point,\u201d which is the humanoid pet form he stays in with a big head for the smarts it grants along with a small body; and \u201cHeavy Point,\u201d which is when he looks like a jacked human with reindeer features that helps him beat the crap out of enemies. With the use of a drug called the \u201cRumble Ball,\u201d which looks like a yellow gum ball, Chopper can access even more transformation points and becomes an uncontrollable monster if he\u2019s not too careful.\nWhat is Chopper\u2019s dream?\nLuffy\u2019s tendency to recruit Straw Hats always comes down to their dreams and Chopper\u2019s is one of the sweetest ones. After losing Dr. Hiriluk and seeing death spread in ways that existentially changes him, Chopper\u2019s dream is to cure the world of all diseases. It makes him perfect for the Straw Hat Crew as their doctor on board and trusty secret weapon in battle.\nOne Piece season two will be released sometime in 2026 on Netflix.\nWant more io9 news?

As her romantic partner Book (David Ajala) pays time for his own role in a campaign to surreptitiously destroy that anomaly, we\u2019re not sure what awaits Burnham and Discovery\u2019s crew just yet, but given this show, we\u2019re sure it\u2019ll be very, very dramatic.\nIn Flux: Star Trek: Prodigy Season 2\nThe animated series aimed at younger Trek fans (and Janeway fans!) and kids at heart can be found on both Nickelodeon and Paramount+.

As for when it\u2019ll return specifically, Toei said it\u2019ll reveal that airdate on Sunday, December 22 at Jump Festa 2025.\nBut just because \u201cEgghead\u201d is on ice doesn\u2019t mean One Piece\u2019s anime is going away completely. Next week on October 20, there\u2019ll be a special 25th anniversary episode centering on the Straw Hats reuniting after spending two years apart. The twist? They\u2019ll be explored through the eyes of several NPCs (non-pirate characters), including a young girl that\u2019s a big fan of navigator Nami. Then on October 27, a re-edited cut of the \u201cFish-Man Island Saga\u201d (aka, episodes 517-541, then 543-574) will run from then until Sunday, March 30, 2025. This condensed, \u201cspecial 21-episode cutdown\u201d will feature re-shot scenes and wholly new animation scenes, plus a new opening (\u201cWe Go!\u201d by Kitadani Hiroshi) and ending (\u201cSailing\u201d by BE:FIRST) done in the show\u2019s current visual style.\nDespite being a shortened version of the original anime\u2019s lengthy saga, the \u201cFish-Man\u201d re-edit appears to be completely disconnected from WIT Studio\u2019s upcoming One Piece remake in the works over at Netflix. That show is also meant to offer a shortened retelling of this massive, 1,122-episode story, though WIT hasn\u2019t broken down how it\u2019ll go about condensing. Still, at least there\u2019ll be some One Piece to watch between now and the show\u2019s full-on return in April.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "| Ahoy! This here is the 30th Featured Article.\n\"Jaguar D. Saul\" has been featured, meaning it was chosen as an article of interest.\n|\n- For the chapter of the same name, see Chapter 396.\nJaguar D. Saul is a giant and former Vice Admiral who deserted the Marines[2] and happened to wash ashore on Ohara.[1]\nDuring the Buster Call that destroyed Ohara 22 years ago, he risked his life to protect a young Nico Robin and ended up frozen by fellow former Vice Admiral Kuzan.[8] While Robin and the World Government presumed that he had died, he had actually survived. After collecting the books that Ohara's scholars sacrificed themselves to save, he brought them to Elbaph and went into hiding,[5] after which he stayed and became a history teacher for the Walrus School, located on Elbaph's \"Sun World\" level.\nHe is a major ally of the Straw Hat Pirates during the Elbaph Arc.\nQuick Answers\nWhat led to Jaguar D. Saul deserting the Marines?\nHow did Jaguar D. Saul survive the Buster Call that destroyed Ohara?\nWhat is the relationship between Jaguar D. Saul and Nico Robin?\nIs there any connection between Jaguar D. Saul and Luffy?\nWhat did Jaguar D. Saul do with the books he collected from Ohara's scholars?\nAppearance[]\nAs a giant, Saul is many times larger than a human. He has long, orange hair and a big beard that seems to connect around his entire face, which somewhat resembled a lion's mane.\nDuring his time as a vice admiral, Saul wore a Marine coat like all other higher-ranking Marines. However, after his defection, he discarded it. When he crash-landed on Ohara, he was wearing a black shirt and gray jeans that were a little tattered. Also, as a Marine, he had worn the Marine cap, but upon his defection he exchanged it for a cowboy's hat.[1]\nWhile leading a group of Elbaph giants in retrieving books from Ohara, Saul was noted to be wrapped in bandages.[5]\nFollowing the Ohara Incident, Saul received a large scar over his eyes, grew a thicker mustache that is braided at the ends, and had his right foot replaced with a peg leg.[3]\nGallery[]\nPersonality[]\nSaul is a big and friendly giant who was somewhat shy and timid. While he was loyal to the Marines, he questioned their orders at least twice, which shows that he followed moral Justice over the code of Absolute Justice. In the end, it was this moral judgment that led him to betraying them, as Saul could not see why the Marines would need to slaughter an entire clan of mere archaeologists, who had no fighting chance against them. He also justified his choice of defending Robin after seeing a former colleague destroy an entire ship of innocent citizens, who held no related crimes to the incident at hand.\nSaul is also characterized as having a unique, but awkward laugh (Dereshishishishi). He enjoys seeing others laugh and have fun, as shown when he encouraged Robin to laugh.[1] Like other \"D's\" before him, he was seen laughing before his presumed death.[8]\nSaul has shown himself to be a loyal friend and comrade, caring for both his allies and the students of the Walrus School,[9] willing to sacrifice himself to save them, going out in defiance against opponents whose strength exceeds his own,[10] and running into raging flames to ensure that no child can be harmed.[11] He regrets the possibility of losing the knowledge and experience saved from Ohara and passed on to the next generation, and cries over it, but also knows that the lives of the children who were blackmailed into burning down the library and school are far more important.[12]\nRelationships[]\nNico Robin[]\n| \u2014 Saul, to Robin about having friends.[13] |\nHe was one of the three people who influenced Nico Robin. Saul was the first person to have befriended Robin (besides Ohara's archaeologists) after she found him washed up on Ohara's shore. Afterwards, Robin visited and brought food for him for several days while he built a raft to leave the island. One day, he taught and encouraged Robin to laugh whenever she was sad, even if it hurt. Seconds before what Robin thought was his death, Saul told her that she would find friends that will protect her and live with her someday. As Robin left the island, she mourns for him, not realizing he survived, along with the destruction of her home and the death of her mother.\nSaul's relationship with Robin explained how she knows about the Will of D. After saving Luffy from being buried under quicksand, she questioned him about why those who have the Will of D. fight, although Luffy had no idea what she was talking about.\nRobin hallucinates Saul's appearance alongside Olvia and Clover as her \"most precious memories\" under the effects of Black Maria's illusion mist.[14]\nIt would not be until 22 years later that Robin would learn that Saul was still alive and in hiding at Elbaph which she was brought to tears when Shaka revealed this information, despite not being able to verify Saul's name directly.[5] The two would officially reunite when Robin visited Elbaph. Later when he fought Sommers, Saul hid both Robin and Chopper to keep them safe.\nKuzan[]\nSaul and Vice Admiral Kuzan (later known as Admiral Aokiji) also had a good friendship. They also shared the same sight on Moral Justice. Despite this, their friendship was not enough to spare Saul, though the reason Kuzan allowed Robin to live was mostly a final favor to Saul.[15]\nNico Olvia[]\nSaul initially had a hostile interaction with Nico Olvia. She berated him for murdering her colleagues and blindly complying with the World Government's policies without knowledge of the entire situation. Saul realized she was correct and it led him to question his senior officer about the prohibition on Poneglyphs. The lack of answers prompted him to question Olvia about her work and in disdain for the World Government's cruelty defected by releasing her. Olvia warned him that he could never return to the Marines, due to his treason. Saul responded by stating he was following his own ethics and wished her luck on her return to Ohara.[16] Olvia finally trusted him by requesting Saul to protect her daughter and evacuate her from Ohara.[17] Saul told Robin to be proud of her mother and the other archaeologists for their defiance of the World Government.[18] Years after her death, Saul still held respect for Olvia as he praised Robin for inheriting her mother's beauty.\nGiants of Elbaph[]\nDespite not being from Elbaph, Saul was familiar with the giants there, considering them somewhat barbaric.[19] Despite this, he apparently has a good relationship with them, to the point that they helped him transport the books of Ohara and let him live on the island.[5]\nHis students refer to him with the honorific \"-sensei\" (\u5148\u751f?).[20][3]\nStraw Hat Pirates[]\nSaul met the rest of Robin's crewmates during their visit to Elbaph, where the majority of them (minus Zoro and Jinbe) cried in happiness upon seeing Robin happily reunited with Saul. Luffy personally thanked Saul for saving Robin's life. Saul in turn knew who Luffy was, as Luffy had become very famous since becoming one of the Four Emperors and encourages him and the other members of the crew to continue to protect Robin from the World Government.\nEnemies[]\nMarines[]\nAs a Marine officer, Saul was supposed to be loyal to the ideals and duties of the naval military. However, he questioned the orders of his commanding officer at least twice, which shows that he followed Moral Justice over the code of Absolute Justice. In the end, it was this moral judgment that led him to defecting by releasing Nico Olvia from prison,[16] as Saul could not see why the Marines would need to slaughter an entire clan of mere archaeologists, who had no fighting chance against them. He also justified his choice of defending Robin after seeing a former colleague destroy an entire ship of innocent citizens, who held no related crimes to the incident at hand. After the Buster Call ended, Saul undermined its purpose by saving the books that the scholars placed in a lake, preserving the knowledge that the Marines sought to destroy, while allowing Vegapunk to secretly read them and effectively study the forbidden Void Century.[5]\nAbilities and Powers[]\nAs a former Marine Vice Admiral, Saul had command of the lower ranking subordinates, as well as leading a Buster Call along with four other Vice Admirals. However, his defection cost him these privileges.\nHe has experienced the Grand Line and seen Devil Fruit users, so he was not surprised or scared by them at all. He even states that he was somewhat jealous of their incredible abilities.[1] He also knew how to fish for nourishment and build rafts, showing basic survival skills.\nIn the last twenty years, Saul has dedicated himself to studying, becoming well-versed in history and even teaching classes on Elbaph.[3]\nPhysical Abilities[]\nSaul possesses almost unbeatable strength, even greater than that of most giants. Vice Admiral Bluegrass knew Saul as exceptionally powerful when he was a Marine. He could easily lift a Buster Call ship up out of the water to slam it back down and destroy it (a Buster Call ship's size was several times the size of a giant at the time). His durability was immense as well, brushing off explosions from direct cannonball hits. He was also capable of surviving being completely frozen over by then Vice Admiral Kuzan.[5]\nTechniques[]\n- Kimatsu Shiken (\n\u9b3c\u62b9\u5fd7\u62f3 , Kimatsu Shiken?, literally meaning \"Demon-Erasing Resolute Fist\"): Saul hardens his fist with Armament Haki and slams it down on his opponent's head.[22] This is likely a pun on the Japanese term kimatsu shiken (\u671f\u672b\u8a66\u9a13?), which means \"final exam\". In the VIZ manga, this is called Midterm Exslam.\nHaki[]\n- Further information: Haki\nIt was stated that all vice admirals possess Haki, so Saul can also use the ability.[23]\nArmament Haki[]\nSaul is a skilled user of Armament Haki, being capable of hardening his fists at the very least. He first demonstrated his ability in order to take out J\u00f6rmungandr with a powerful punch.[22]\nHistory[]\nPast[]\nEarly History[]\nSaul is a giant, but not an Elbaph giant, as he was born somewhere in the South Blue.\nAt some point in his life, he became a Marine and eventually made it to the rank of Vice Admiral with Doll serving under him. Before the storyline, Saul had traveled in the Grand Line, though nothing was said of his adventures other than the fact that he met many Devil Fruit users.[1]\nDuring his time in the Marines, he became aware of the God's Knights.[10]\nA Storm in the Edd War[]\nWhen the Marines learned that the Roger Pirates and the Golden Lion Pirates were about to battle in the Edd War, Saul was in Marineford and walked with Garp, Kuzan, Sakazuki, and Tsuru, listening to the conversation about Garp's efforts to arrest Gold Roger.[24]\nOhara Incident[]\nWhile on duty, Saul's vessel encountered a wanted ship run by the archaeologists of Ohara, who had left West Blue to locate and decipher the mysterious poneglyphs that bear an ancient, forgotten history that was forbidden to be studied. Despite ordering his men to take the archaeologists alive, Saul's crew slaughtered all but one, Nico Olvia.\nAfter Olvia's capture, Saul was informed by Sengoku that he would be one of the five chosen vice admirals to lead a Buster Call against Ohara for its crimes of deciphering the poneglyphs. Rejecting the study of history as a justification for the order, Saul began to doubt the World Government's actions. After interrogating Olvia, Saul grew disgusted with the military's brutal intentions and defected against the World Government by releasing her.[2]\nSoon after, he was shipwrecked in a storm and sent adrift in the ocean until he unknowingly landed in Ohara. There he met Nico Robin, whom he befriended. She visited for the next four days, while he was building a raft.[1] One he had finished his raft, she told him about her mother, which led Saul to realize that he was in Ohara and that Robin was Olvia's daughter. He then warned her about the battleship that was going to destroy Ohara due to the scholars having studied the Poneglyph.[25]\nUpon seeing the battleships gathering for the Buster Call,[26] Saul rushed off to find Robin.[27] When he found her, she had reunited with her mother. Saul promised Olvia to protect her daughter and then carried Robin to the shore of the island, but the Marine ships spotted him and opened fire. Saul put Robin down and angrily retaliated, picking up one ship[28] and throwing it into another. While attacking other ships, Saul told Robin to go to the evacuation ship. When Spandine refused to allow her aboard, Saul charged at the CP9 ship, but Kuzan intercepted him. Their argument about Justice was interrupted by the evacuation ship exploding. Saul attempted to escape with Robin, but Kuzan froze him in place. Before being completely encased in ice, Saul laughed and encouraged Robin to escape the island and to find friends out at sea.[8]\nWhen he regained consciousness, Saul found himself drowning in the ocean, and concluded that the ice encasing him must have melted and swept him into the water. Awhile afterwards, Saul learned that Robin had survived the Buster Call as well.[3] The World Government believed Saul to have died during the incident, with the assumption that he helped Robin escape the island at the moment of his death.[29]\nAftermath of Ohara[]\nAt some point, Saul became affiliated with Elbaph, and proceeded to lead a group of their giants to retrieve the books that the Ohara scholars had thrown into the lake, and transported the items to their home of Elbaph, where Saul went into hiding. Two years later[30] Saul relayed this knowledge to Vegapunk's clone when the scientist visited the Owl Library on Elbaph, which set Vegapunk on a path to discover the truth of the Void Century.[5]\nThe king of Elbaph, Harald, requested Saul to open a school for the children of the nation as a part of his peaceful reforms, which Saul did, and becoming a history teacher of the newly founded Walrus School.[31]\nFinal Saga[]\nEgghead Arc[]\nDuring Vegapunk's broadcast to the world, Saul was seen relaxing and laughing in the wilds of Elbaph.[6]\nElbaph Arc[]\nOn Elbaph, Saul suddenly collapsed to the ground and was unable to get back up, as others around him called for help.[20] However, once the Straw Hats arrived on the island and reached the beach-like area known as Warrior Springs, it is revealed that Saul was only pretending so he could surprise Nico Robin, something that no one other than Robin herself noticed. Sure enough, once Robin got close, Saul tried spooking her, simply because he did not know what to say to Robin after all these years, so he figured he could surprise her with a joke instead, though it had no effect. Robin told him that his laugh was still funny as he picked her up close to get a better look at her. He told her that she looked just like Olvia now, which Robin is deeply touched by. Saul then asked Robin if she heard Dr. Vegapunk's broadcast and how he considers it Ohara\u2019s legacy and praised the late scientist for risking his life for the sake of preserving its existence.\nShe touched Saul's face, asking about his scars and if they hurt, to which he stated he was fine and that he turned out to be tougher than even he thought, because while he was frozen, the fire of the island melted him free and he fell into the ocean. He later found out that Robin had successfully escaped the island, but he was furious by the lies that were written about her in the paper. Robin, however, tells Saul she does not want to focus on the dark stuff now; instead she wants Saul to praise her for being alive. Saul immediately hugs her and tearfully thanks her for making it all the way here to him. In turn, Robin breaks down into tears saying she missed him, which he replies he missed her too.[32]\nRobin proceeded to introduce him to Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates, in which Saul was happy that they were the friends he hoped Robin would find. Lilith went up to Saul and introduced herself as Vegapunk, and showed the clone of Vegapunk that visited Elbaph 20 years ago, which left Saul confused. Afterwards, Ange and Gerd gave the Straw Hats a tour of the Walrus School, while Saul went to the Owl Library with Chopper, Lilith, and Bonney. Once there, he showed them that the library contained every book he and the giants collected from Ohara.[33] Saul went on to introduce the group to Biblo, the sort of librarian owl who had been there for centuries, and used the power of the Iku Iku no Mi to make the books larger for giants to read. While most of Luffy's friends left to take care of their own business, Robin and Chopper decided to remain with Saul, in order to further study the literature present.[34]\nSometime later, Saul introduced Robin and Chopper to the Harley, a book about the myths and legends of Elbaph, including Nika. He further explained that it had various interpretations, due to its age and ambiguity, and allowed Robin to read from it.[35] Sometime later that day, a construct of J\u00f6rmungandr suddenly attacked the school, forcing Saul and the rest of the staff to defend the student body. While Kiba struck the construct with his hammer, Saul used a haki-coated punch to smash it into the ground, leaving it defeated. Saul apologized to the children about the scary situation, and spoke with Chopper and Robin about the unusual nature of the attack, as most large creatures usually stayed in the Underworld of Elbaph. Just after, however, Saul discovered a severely injured Wolf, the gym teacher, and was greatly confused as he watched many of the giant children sleepwalk away from the school. Moments later, more of the children began to collapse, and Saul stood shocked as massive constructs of the children's fears began to manifest from the nearby forest.[22]\nImmediately afterward, Saul chased the sleepwalking children out of the school. Robin attempted to remind Saul of Wolf's warning, but Saul disregarded it, and proceeded to try to grab Ylva. Saul's attempt was quickly thwarted as invisible thorns around Ylva stabbed his hand, causing him to collapse in pain.[9] Unwilling to give up, Saul equipped himself with a pair of shields, with the plan of simply blocking the children from moving forward without actually touching them. Robin and Chopper wished him luck, however upon being stopped by the shields, the children walked into each other, causing the thorns around each of them to begin pricking them. As Saul aborted his plan, Robin suggested hunting down the user of the devil fruit, but Saul reminded her that nearby flames (that had been started by Loki), would soon enter the children's path, meaning he had to stop them as soon as possible. Making another attempt, Saul equipped a nearby rope, which he used to lasso one of the children at the back. The plan seemed to work, until a MMA of Fenrir appeared, forcing the trio into a fight.[36]\nSaul was able to defeat the MMA; however, the resulting delay allowed the children to make their way directly into the fire. Saul begged the nearby firefighters to stop the flames, but they were having trouble doing so. Jinbe extinguished the flames just in time, giving relief to all.[11] Shepherd Sommers then descended to fight Saul, who warned Chopper and Robin to remain hidden, citing that the God's Knights were immortal, and therefore unbeatable.[10] The fight was over very quickly, with Saul unable to compete with the power of a God's Knight, leading to him collapsing to the ground.[37] Saul remained incapacitated in brambles throughout Sommers' ultimatum to Elbaph. When Jarul gave the order to raze the Walrus School and Owl Library, in order to save the children taken hostage, Saul shed a few tears.[12]\nMajor Battles[]\n- Jaguar D. Saul vs. Buster Call battleships\n- Jaguar D. Saul vs. Vice Admiral Kuzan\n- Jaguar D. Saul vs. Shepherd Sommers\nTranslation and Dub Issues[]\nSaul's surname \"Jaguar\" (\u30cf\u30b0\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb, Haguw\u0101ru?) is based on the Spanish pronunciation of the word \"jaguar\" (/xa\u02c8\u0261wa\u027e/) rather than the English pronunciation, which would be rendered jag\u0101 (\u30b8\u30e3\u30ac\u30fc?) in Japanese. Because of this, some fan translations have been uncertain of the name's origin and used different spelling variants such as \"Hagwar\". The English dub by Funimation uses the English pronunciation of \"Jaguar\", rather than the Spanish.\nOther Appearances[]\nVideo Games[]\nPlayable Appearances\nSupport Appearances\nTrivia[]\n- Saul is currently the only known giant to bear the initial D.; however, he said everyone in his family also has it, meaning that there were/are other giants carrying the initial.\n- Saul is also the only known character with the initial D. who is not a human.\n- Saul's favorite food is whole roasted whale.[4]\n- Although all who reached the rank of Vice Admiral (which includes a fair number of giants) are stated to be able to use Haki, Saul is the first giant in the series to demonstrate its usage.\nReferences[]\n- \u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 392 and Episode 275, Saul makes his debut.\n- \u2191 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 396 (p. 12-15) and Episode 277.\n- \u2191 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 111 Chapter 1133 (p. 8-17).\n- \u2191 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 Vivre Card - One Piece Visual Dictionary (Card #0427), Saul's Vivre Card entry.\n- \u2191 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.3 5.4 5.5 5.6 5.7 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 106 Chapter 1066 (p. 10-15) and Episode 1097, Shaka explains to Robin about Saul's actions.\n- \u2191 6.0 6.1 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 110 Chapter 1114 (p. 11), Saul is seen 22 years after Ohara.\n- \u2191 One Piece Blue Deep: Characters World (p. 135), Saul's birthday is revealed.\n- \u2191 8.0 8.1 8.2 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 397 and Episode 278.\n- \u2191 9.0 9.1 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 112 Chapter 1143 (p. 1-2).\n- \u2191 10.0 10.1 10.2 One Piece Manga \u2014 Chapter 1147 (p. 2).\n- \u2191 11.0 11.1 One Piece Manga \u2014 Chapter 1145 (p. 12-16).\n- \u2191 12.0 12.1 One Piece Manga \u2014 Chapter 1148 (p. 14-15).\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 397 (p. 15-16) and Episode 278.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 101 Chapter 1020 (p. 5-8) and Episodes 1042\u20131043, Robin hallucinates Saul.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 45 Chapter 433 (p. 15-18) and Episode 315.\n- \u2191 16.0 16.1 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 396 (p. 13-15) and Episode 277.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 396 (p. 8) and Episode 277.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 396 (p. 16) and Episode 277.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 392 (p. 11) and Episode 275.\n- \u2191 20.0 20.1 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 111 Chapter 1131 (p. 17).\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 111 Chapter 1133 (p. 16-17), Saul thanks the Straw Hats for protecting Robin the past years while Luffy reassures they will continue to do so.\n- \u2191 22.0 22.1 22.2 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 112 Chapter 1142 (p. 4-10, 14-17).\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 60 Chapter 594 (p. 7) and Episode 511, Dr. Fishbonen states Haki is a power all vice admirals use.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 0 Chapter 0 and Episode 0.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 393 and Episode 276.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 394 and Episode 276.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 395 and Episode 277.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 396 and Episode 277.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 398 and Episode 278.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 112 Chapter 1134 (p. 6-7), Saul and Lilith claim they met 20 years ago.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 112 Chapter 1134 (p. 8, 11-12), Harald's reforms are discussed.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 111 Chapter 1133 (p. 10-17).\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 112 Chapter 1134 (p. 3-7, 9, 13-15).\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 112 Chapter 1135 (p. 2-3, 9).\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 112 Chapter 1138 (p. 14-17).\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 112 Chapter 1144 (p. 11-13).\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Chapter 1146 (p. 16-17).\n[]\n| |||||||||||||\n| |||||||||||||\n|\n| |||||||||||\n| |||||||||||\n|\nSouth Blue Inhabitants | |||||||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| |||||||||||||||||\n| |||||||||||||||||\n|\n| |||||||\n| |||||||\n|\n| |||||||||||||\n| |||||||||||||\n| |||||||||||||\n|\n| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|"

      "text": "The DC Extended Universe is finally giving Marvel a run for its money\u2014something that\u2019s bound to increase now that James Gunn is running the show. The DCEU\u2019s myriad projects stretch far beyond superhero mainstays Batman, Superman, and the Justice League, promising to include new and interesting takes on DC Comics\u2019 enormous stable of characters.\nWhat follows is an up-to-date list of everything DCEU-related that\u2019s on the way: DC movies heading to theaters, as well as DC streaming movies and shows coming to Max.\nLast updated 8/23/2023.\nWhat\u2019s the next DC Movie?\nAquaman and the Lost Kingdom\nRelease date: December 20 (in theaters)\nDirector James Wan returns for the next adventure following Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) as the newly crowned King of Atlantis. Now in his new role, Arthur will explore more of the world under the sea while also dealing with new threats from Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and others. Like Shazam 2, Aquaman 2 has endured its share of release-date changes, with its new Christmas 2023 date designed to give Wan and company ample time to complete all the necessary special effects.\nUpcoming DC Movie Release Dates\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\nRelease date: October 4, 2024 (in theaters)\nTodd Phillips never saw his Joker movie as anything but a singular film. But over a billion dollars at the box office and an Oscar for Best Actor (for star Joaquin Phoenix) obviously changed things. We have a few nuggets of info so far: the title is Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux(French for \u201cshared madness\u201d), Phoenix is returning and will co-star with Lady Gaga (who\u2019s playing Harley Quinn), Zazie Beetz is probably returning as Arthur Fleck\u2019s neighbor, and\u2026 it\u2019s likely going to be a musical? Filming wrapped in early April 2023.\nThe Batman 2\nRelease date: 2025 (in theaters)\nHot off the success of Matt Reeves\u2019 long-awaitedThe Batman, everyone involved made it clear that wasn\u2019t a one-and-done. Robert Pattinson\u2019s Batman will be back. Will he face off with the Joker? It\u2019s possible but not definitive. You\u2019d imagine the Penguin and Catwoman could be back too. We don\u2019t know much yet about this one, but we do know it won\u2019t be arriving until 2025.\nCurrent DC Shows\nDoom Patrol Season 4, Part 2\nRelease date: TBD 2023 (on Max)\nThe fourth and final season of Doom Patrol\u2014starring Brendan Fraser, Matt Bomer, Diane Guerrero, April Bowlby, Joivan Wade, Timothy Dalton, Skye Roberts, and Michelle Gomez\u2014already aired its first batch of episodes; the remaining six will return later this year.\nUpcoming DC Movies and Shows Without Release Dates\nThe Penguin\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nYou saw him in The Batman and now, Colin Farrell\u2019s Penguin is getting his own Max series. As of April 2023, the show is in production, with a cast that also includes Cristin Milioti, Rhenzy Feliz, Michael Kelly, Shohreh Aghdashloo, and Deirdre O\u2019Connell, with Clancy Brown and Michael Zegen recurring.\nPeacemaker Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nFrom the instant that opening credits scene rolled for the first time, DC fans and non-fans alike fell in love with Peacemaker. Well, he\u2019s coming back, still played by John Cena and still from the twisted mind of James Gunn. There\u2019s no word on when it\u2019ll happen but we\u2019re guessing 2024.\nSuperman: Legacy\nRelease date: July 11, 2025\nJames Gunn will write and direct this Superman movie, which is touted as not being an origin story. Casting announcements started with Clark Kent/Superman and Lois Lane, who\u2019ll be played by David Corenswet and Rachel Brosnahan. We also know Isabela Merced will play Hawkgirl, Edi Gathegi is Mister Terrific, and Nathan Fillion is a Green Lantern (Guy Gardner), as well as Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho.\nMore Upcoming DC Movies and Shows Announced for the Gunn/Safran Era\nThe shake-up at DC Studios got a huge zap of energy at the end of January, when James Gunn and Peter Safran announced their massive slate of planned projects. Little is known about most of these projects so far in terms of cast and crew and even release dates\u2014but we do have a few tidbits for each.\nCreature Commandos (An animated Max show) \u2013 A seven-episode animated series written by James Gunn himself. It stars Indira Varma (Obi-Wan Kenobi, Game of Thrones) as the Bride, who\u2019s the lead character, and Marvel veteran Frank Grillo as Rick Flagg Sr.\u2014father of Rick Flagg, played by Joel Kinnaman in The Suicide Squad. The rest of the cast includes David Harbour (Stranger Things) as Eric Frankenstein, Sean Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) as G.I. Robot, Zoe Chao (The Afterparty) as Nina Mazursky, Alan Tudyk (Star Wars: Rogue One) as Dr. Phosphorus, Maria Bakalova (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) as new character Princess Ilana Rostovic, and Peacemaker\u2019s Steve Agee and Sean Gunn returning as John Economos and Weasel, respectively.\nWaller (A live-action Max show) \u2013 Viola Davis will reprise her Suicide Squad character; the story will bring back characters from the Peacemaker show and tell a story with events set between Peacemaker seasons one and two.\nLanterns (A live-action Max show) \u2013 Set on Earth, this mystery series will follow Hal Jordan and John Stewart doing their thing as DC\u2019s \u201csuper cops.\u201d\nThe Authority (Theatrical film) \u2013 The Wildstorm superhero characters will make their big-screen debut in a film co-written by Gunn.\nParadise Lost (A live-action Max show) \u2013 How did Wonder Woman\u2019s world, Themyscira, come to be? Find out in this Game of Thrones-ish tale set before her birth.\nThe Brave and the Bold (Theatrical film) \u2013 Based on the acclaimed Grant Morrison comic run, this will explore the story of Batman\u2019s son, Damien Wayne, and will feature \u201cother members of the extended Bat-family.\u201d\nBooster Gold (A live-action Max show) \u2013 The \u201closer from the future\u201d superhero character gets his own series.\nSupergirl: Woman of Tomorrow (Theatrical film) \u2013 Based on Tom King\u2019s comics run, this movie will explore how Supergirl is different from Superman. It\u2019s not yet certain if Sasha Calle, who plays Supergirl in The Flash, will reprise the role here.\nSwamp Thing (Theatrical film) \u2013 The character\u2019s \u201cdark origins\u201d will be the focus of this one. DC does horror! Rumored but not yet confirmed to be directing, James Mangold (Indiana Jones 5) told Collider that he\u2019s slated to write the script.\nUpcoming DC Movies and Shows That Were Once in Development, But Whose Fate Is Unclear in the Gunn/Safran Era\nTa-Nehisi Coates and J.J. Abrams\u2019 Superman movie\nRelease date: Unknown (in theaters)\nThe news of Superman: Legacy cast uncertainty on this project from writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and producer J.J. Abrams. There hadn\u2019t been an update on this one in a while, but in late April, James Gunn himself told io9 that the two films don\u2019t necessarily cancel each other out: \u201cThat\u2019s an exciting movie \u2026 if it comes in and it\u2019s great \u2026 and if the timing is right, that could absolutely happen. That\u2019s totally unrelated. It would be an Elseworlds tale like Joker.\u201d\nMichael B. Jordan Superman Series\nRelease date: Unknown (for Max)\nMichael B. Jordan was once developing a Superman take for Max as a limited series that would feature Val-Zod as opposed to Clark Kent. Again, there hasn\u2019t been an update in a while.\nStatic Shock\nRelease date: Unknown\nPart of the relaunch of the Milestone comic brand is this adaptation produced by, once again, Michael B. Jordan. A writer was hired back in 2021 to come up with a script and we haven\u2019t heard much since.\nJustice League Dark\nRelease date: Unknown (for Max)\nJ.J. Abrams was among the people involved with bringing this evil super-team to life and while there hasn\u2019t been a ton of movement on the project of late, it\u2019s been around long enough that we\u2019d imagine it happens eventually.\nMetal Men\nRelease date: Unknown\nOne of the more recent pre-Gunn/Safran DC films to go into development, this is this tale of six beings based on various powerful metals. It\u2019s from directors Ron Clements and John Musker (Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and Moana), so if it happens, it\u2019ll have an incredible pedigree.\nZatanna\nRelease date: Unknown\nLast year, Emerald Fennell won an Oscar for writing Promising Young Woman. She followed that up landing the job to write this DC superhero flick about the young magician. Like most of the films in this section, there hasn\u2019t been movement in a while.\nHourman\nRelease date: Unknown\nYes, the hero who takes a drug that makes him a hero for an hour was, back in 2021, rumored to be in development. Whether or not that\u2019s still the case is unknown but we figured it was worth noting.\nUntitled Arkham Show\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nIn addition to The Penguin, Matt Reeves has said he plans to expand the world of The Batman into Max shows. At one point, a series about Gotham PD was in the works, but now he says it might be more about the inner workings at Arkham Asylum. On October 25, The Staircase\u2019s Antonio Campos came aboard as a writer\u2014the third to hold that position on the potential series so far\u2014and may direct and serve as showrunner if the show happens, according to a report in Variety.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "The live-action adaptation of Eiichiro Oda\u2019s One Piece wasn\u2019t just good, it was good in a way that took everyone by surprise. With the numbers to show for it, it\u2019s no wonder Netflix gave it a second season, which is dropping next year.\nAfter a wave of casting announcements, Netflix finally pulled back the curtain on the upcoming season during Tokyo\u2019s One Piece Day celebration. All the Straw Hats\u2014Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji, all new threads from the manga\u2014are present and accounted for, but the big selling point of the trailer is the fresh faces they\u2019ll meet, like bounty hunter Smoker (Callum Kerr) and Baroque Works agents Mss. Wednesday (Charithra Chandran) and All Sunday (Lera Abova). Like last time, this season will adapt several manga arcs, including \u201cLoguetown\u201d and \u201cDrum Island,\u201d which introduce future allies, enemies, and crew members, including doctor Tony Tony Chopper (Mikaela Hoover).\nDuring the presentation, Netflix also revealed One Piece is getting a third season, with production starting in Cape Town later in 2025. The show also has a new co-showrunner for the future season in Ian Stokes, taking over for Matt Owens after his exit from the series earlier this year. Hopefully it won\u2019t be too long a wait after season two, which hits Netflix sometime in 2026.\nWant more io9 news?

      "url": "https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Void_Century",
      "text": "The Void Century, also known as the Void in History (\u7a7a\u767d\u306e\u6b74\u53f2, K\u016bhaku no Rekishi?), is a century-long time period from 900 to 800 years prior to the current storyline with no recorded archaeological history.[1][2] For unknown reasons, research into this era is considered to be one of the worst crimes possible by the World Government.[3] The events of this period are so important and relevant that by learning them, one is said to become aware of the \"true history\" of the Blue Planet.\nIt has been Nico Robin's dream ever since she was a child to uncover the truth of the Void Century.[4] Following his death, the scientist Dr. Vegapunk revealed to the world via a pre-planned broadcast what he knew about the Void Century,[5] although part of it was temporarily interrupted by the Five Elders' attempt to stop the broadcast at all costs.[6]\nBackground\nThis period became known as the Void Century because there is nothing left to acknowledge anything that happened during that time. The only exception are the Poneglyphs, which are written in an ancient language that only a few people in modern times know how to read: Nico Robin,[7] the archaeologists of Ohara,[3] Kouzuki Sukiyaki[8] and Vegapunk.[9] Among these people, only Robin and Sukiyaki are still alive today, as it is unknown if any of Vegapunk's satellites have this ability.\nHowever, it causes a problem with the known histories of the world as nothing ties up because of that missing period. Though many seem to know there is a gap in the historical record, virtually everyone is unaware that filling in this gap is possible. For example, Nefertari Cobra, after being told by Robin about this missing period, was completely shocked that a way to \"tie the threads of history together\" existed.[4] The fact that filling the gap is possible was proven when \"Dark King\" Silvers Rayleigh revealed that the Roger Pirates discovered the true history.[10]\nAll of the World Nobles, including the Five Elders and God's Knights, are adamant in maintaining the secrecy of the Void Century. Some of them however, seem to be unaware of what the Void Century is, as Shalria was confused by Vegapunk's mention of it during his global broadcast.[11]\nThe true history of the world apparently contains secrets so dangerous that those who are aware of them, including outlaws, are highly reluctant to talk about them. The Roger Pirates and Edward Newgate did not reveal to the public what lies hidden at Laugh Tale and Kouzuki Oden did not reveal to his followers the true history because he considered it a burden. Silvers Rayleigh offered to tell the true history to Nico Robin, but warned her that given her state at the time, she would not be able to do anything about it. Furthermore, any knowledge of the true events of what happened in the Void Century is considered a death sentence and holding such knowledge is liable to death in the eyes of the World Government, regardless of the affiliation of the person knowing it.[12]\nEven entire nations will be destroyed and erased from record should even a single person attempt to learn anything about the Void Century. The World Government is not even shy on killing innocent people even if they had nothing to do with the people learning about the Void Century, because of the pure speculation that they might know something about the Void Century.[13] The World Government would not even hesitate from destroying their own property and killing their own valuable allies just to destroy anyone who has an affiliation with the Void Century, whether they know it or not. In fact, all three canon Buster Calls were initiated at least in part due to knowledge pertaining to the Void Century, due to Nico Robin's presence on Ohara and Enies Lobby, plus Vegapunk's presence alongside Robin on Egghead.\nGreat War\nOne of the most important events during the Void Century was the Great War. The reasons and circumstances for how this conflict came to be are currently unknown, but the war resulted in the formation of the World Government, the destruction of the Great Kingdom, and the current geographical state of the world.\nThe First Twenty\u2014royals from twenty different countries\u2014banded together and created an army called the \"Alliance\" in opposition to the Great Kingdom. On the side of the Great Kingdom was Joy Boy, the first pirate, who proved to be so powerful that the Alliance could not defeat him. During the war, the three Ancient Weapons of Pluton, Poseidon, and Uranus were used; however, Vegapunk deduced that the usage of the Ancient Weapons resulted in sea levels across the world rising by 200 meters. Because the Ancient Weapons still exist, Vegapunk believed this war had not yet fully come to an end.[14]\nIt has been indicated that this war was what led to the fall of Shandora.[15]\nLocations and Figures\nElbaph Mural\nA large mural was carved into the fossilized bark of the Treasure Tree Adam on Elbaph sometime during the Void Century. Little is known about it, but according to Ripley, the leading theory is that it was carved by fantasizing children at the time. This is partly due to the mural including several races working together, as while there were sometimes wars between races, the giants know of no instances of cultural exchange. Even so, it is considered a cultural relic due to its historical value.\nIncidentally, the mural appears to visually depict the text of the Harley, which records the ancient history of two worlds that have passed and of one that is yet to occur.[16]\nShandora\nIn Enel's cover story, there is an ancient city on the moon with another bunch of identical Automata. There is a painting on the wall that shows a Skypiean with Automata following him on the left while a Shandorian and Birkan work on the right.[17] After resources on the moon ran out, the three races departed for the \"Blue Star\".[18]\nOne of the three races, the Shandorians, ended up on the isle of Jaya where they built the city of Shandora one thousand years ago. The great city of Shandora collapsed during this war, the Shandorians defended the city against \"those who seek the stone\". The city collapsed, but the Shandia, who are the descendants of the Shandorians, kept on defending the city for over eight hundred years afterwards.\nGreat Kingdom\nThe Great Kingdom was a great and powerful kingdom that was destroyed by the Twenty Kingdoms, who would later evolve into the World Government. The kingdom was so powerful that its existence posed a great threat to the world and is the reason why studying the Poneglyphs is outlawed. In the Great Kingdom's illustration, a few moon-craters are shown, indicating a possible connection of it with the kingdom.\nThe Great Kingdom had a name, which is yet to be revealed. However, Clou D. Clover stated that its name was of tremendous importance and held the key of understanding the Void Century.\nAccording to Vegapunk, the Great Kingdom was a highly advanced technological civilization 900 years ago.[19] Vegapunk is considered to be 500 years ahead of the rest of the world in scientific achievements, and he still considers himself vastly inferior to the Great Kingdom. Despite his intelligence, Vegapunk is only able to replicate that technology to a limited extent.[20]\nJoy Boy\nDuring the Void Century, Joy Boy set sail from his home in the Great Kingdom, becoming the very first pirate in history. He wielded the power of the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika, a Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allowed him to become an incarnation of the ever-playful sun god, Nika. It gave him a body with the properties of rubber, giving him the freedom to fight however he wanted.[21] Joy Boy's defeat marked the end of the Great Kingdom and thus the Void Century.[22]\nJoy Boy also left behind a certain item of unimaginable value in the last island of the Grand Line. According to Whitebeard, the world will be shocked to its core when it is found again.\nOnce Kouzuki Oden learned about the events of the Void Century, he reached the conclusion that Wano Country should be opened to the world before the day Joy Boy returns.\nNoah\nJoy Boy arrived at Fish-Man Island and made a certain deal with the mermaid princess of the day. This princess had the power known as Poseidon, a unique ability among Merfolk to summon and control the Sea Kings, only appearing in a Mermaid princess once every few centuries.\nThe terms of the deal are unknown, but it involved a colossal ship called Noah. The ship was built so the Sea Kings could pull it, but it is unknown where they were supposed to take it to or for what purpose.\nFor unknown reasons, Joy Boy failed to keep his part of the promise. He wrote his apology on the Poneglyph in the Sea Forest.[23] The people of Fish-Man Island continue to keep Noah safe until the \"appointed time\" comes.\nTontatta Kingdom\nBefore the Void Century, the Dwarves of the Tontatta Kingdom suffered oppression under the ruthless rulers of the island of Dressrosa, the Donquixote Family.[24] However, the Dwarves had forgotten what happened during the Void Century.\nWano Country\nWano likely played an important role in the Void Century and was somehow affiliated to the Great Kingdom, as the Kouzuki Family were the ones who created the Poneglyphs, and Pluton, one of the Ancient Weapons, currently rests within the country's depths. The ancient country of Wano that existed at the time was also much different from the one that exists currently, having been more similar to a standard island at sea level instead of the unique water-bowl mountain structure it now displays.\nDuring his visit to Laugh Tale, Kouzuki Oden learned that the country was once connected with the rest of the world but adopted a policy of isolationism to protect itself from a \"great enemy\", leading to massive walls being erected around the perimeter of the whole country, which resulted in everything below the top of the wall to be flooded with rain water, leaving only a few mountainside plateaus habitable. According to Oden, it is essential for the world to reconnect with Wano, thus its borders must open before Joy Boy returns. Doing so would also mean unleashing Pluton once more.\nHowever, the people of Wano seem to be oblivious of why their country is isolated and what happened during the Void Century, despite the fact that the World Government cannot enforce the prohibition of research in the country. Most people in Wano do not know of what lies in the outside world in the first place due to it being a crime to leave the country.\nLili\nNefertari Lili was the queen of Arabasta during the Void Century and one of the twenty royals to ally together against the Great Kingdom. After the collapse of the Great Kingdom, most of the twenty rulers decided to relocate to Mary Geoise, with their descendants becoming known as World Nobles, leaving their kingdoms to establish new royal families. Lili however opted to return home instead. As such, she also did not leave the symbolic weapon at the Empty Throne.\nHowever, she disappeared before she went back to Arabasta and records of her were wiped out. Afterwards, her younger brother took the throne in her stead. The only proof of her existence is the letter that she left behind. [25]\nShe is a subject of interest for Imu due to her mistake that led to the Poneglyphs spreading across the world.[26] Imu also has particular interest in Lili's descendant, Vivi.[27]\nThe Legacy of the War\nGeography\nDuring the Void Century, the global sea level rose by 200 meters, and so the continents that existed a thousand years ago sunk into the depths. The islands known to exist in the present day are merely the mountaintops of those continents.[28]\nVegapunk took climatological, geological, environmental and atmospheric factors into account, and concluded that it is impossible that the extreme rise in the sea level could have been caused by a natural disaster (as one might assume at first). A single century would not have been nearly enough time for the world to change so drastically on its own. Vegapunk then concluded that it was the Ancient Weapons that were responsible for this man-made disaster. Additionally, keeping in mind that the weapons still exist in the present day, waiting to rise again, the Great War that occurred during the Void Century never actually came to an end.[29]\nThe revelation of the rising sea levels and the possibility that they could rise further bring a new light as to why the World Nobles chose to make their home at the top of the colossal Red Line, as well as to the reason for why the World Nobles commissioned the construction of the megastructures Tequila Wolf (\u30c6\u30ad\u30fc\u30e9\u30a6\u30eb\u30d5, Tek\u012bra Urufu?), Vodka Wolf (\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30ab\u30a6\u30eb\u30d5, Wokka Urufu?), Rum Wolf (\u30e9\u30e0\u30a6\u30eb\u30d5, Ramu Urufu?), and Bourbon Wolf (\u30d0\u30fc\u30dc\u30f3\u30a6\u30eb\u30d5, B\u014dbon Urufu?), which slaves have been constructing for 700 years.[30]\nBirth of the World Government\n800 years ago, at the end of the Void Century, after the alliance defeated Joy Boy, the World Government was born and took political control of the entire world, uniting all countries and forming the Council of Kings, which meets every four years. The exact process of how it was founded and how they covered up the 100-year gap remains unknown.\nWith the exception of Queen Lili of Arabasta, all the founding monarchs who joined the alliance and established the World Government relocated to the World Governments capital city Mary Geoise, located at the halfway point of the Grand Line, the \"center of the world\" so to speak, located at the top of the Red Line. Their homelands elected new royal families as a result. The descendants of those 19 royals are known as World Nobles, or \"Celestial Dragons\". The World Government is officially ruled by a council of Five Elders, who are the highest ranking of all the Celestial Dragons.\nThe founding members also pledged the equality between their kingdoms in front of the Empty Throne, a chair located in the Government's Headquarters, Pangaea Castle. The throne in the center of the world having no occupant is meant to signify that the world has no singular ruler. Even the Five Elders who rule the World Government are just that: five of them. Each founder left a weapon of their own stuck in the ground around the throne in order to symbolize their protection over it.\nHowever, the throne being empty is a lie. A mysterious individual known as Imu currently sits on it. Even the Five Elders bow down to this person. The Revolutionary Army suspect that this person might actually be Nerona Imu, one of the founding royals from the Void Century, granted immortality by the power of a certain Devil Fruit.\nFor the World Government, the events of the Void Century were better left unknown as information linked to it is considered far too dangerous.\nPoneglyphs\nPoneglyphs are mysterious, large stone blocks scattered all over the Grand Line. The text inscribed on them is information about what happened during the Void Century, as well as how to find the last island in the Grand Line, Laugh Tale. They are written in an ancient language that very few people in the world are able to translate. They have been said to be unbreakable by Professor Clou D. Clover.\nThe Government has forbidden anyone to research or study these blocks. When the research of the Poneglyphs was outlawed, hundreds of scholars across the world were killed. Since then, a very strict ban on any research at all related to the Void Century has been put in place.[3]\nAncient Weapons\nThe Ancient Weapons are three weapons of mass destruction that are powerful enough to bring ruin to the entire world. The Ancient Weapons are the argument used by the World Government to forbid the research of the missing years.\nThey first weapon is known as Pluton,[31] an ancient battleship capable of massive destruction. The blueprints were left with the Shipwrights of Water 7 who created it, passed down from master to apprentice over the centuries, and the ship itself was hidden in Wano Country after the Great War. Wano is surrounded by a massive wall that was erected around the islands border through unknown means, causing the sea level regions of the country to be flooded with rain water, leaving only a series of mountainside plateaus. Kouzuki Oden believed that Wano's borders should be opened before Joy Boy returned. Rather than ending Wano's policy of isolationism, \"opening the border\" actually meant destroying the wall and releasing Pluton.\nThe second weapon is known as Poseidon. Fish-Men and Merfolk are able to communicate with sea creatures, however communicating with Sea Kings has always been beyond them. Once every few centuries, a mermaid princess is born into the royal family of the Ryugu Kingdom with the power known as Poseidon; the power to speak with and command the Sea Kings. Apparently, even the Sea Kings themselves do not know why their queen always takes the form of a mermaid princess, but she is their exalted ruler all the same. The current mermaid princess, Shirahoshi is the current holder of this power.\nThe third weapon is known as Uranus, the nature and capabilities of which remain unknown. Its location is also a mystery.\nOne Piece\nJoy Boy left something of unknown nature on the last island of the Grand Line. 800 years later, 25 years before the current storyline, Gol D. Roger and his crew became the only ones to make it all the way there since the Void Century. When they saw what was on the island, they burst out laughing and referred to it as a \"funny story\", which is how the island got its name, Laugh Tale.\nIt is currently unknown what they saw, but it was stated they \"arrived a little too early\".\nAfter Roger was diagnosed with a fatal illness, he turned himself in to the Marines, and when he was up on the Execution Platform, he revealed the existence of the One Piece to the world, describing it as his vast treasure and that it was free for the taking to anyone who could find it. For years to come, his last words inspired countless people to set sail as pirates, beginning a time known as the Great Pirate Era.\nAccording to Dr. Vegapunk, the fate of the world will be decided by whoever is able to claim the One Piece. He believes that the ones closest to the truth are those who refuse to buckle under any and all suppression. But the one who finds it may not be the one Joy Boy was hoping for.[32]\nIron Giant\nAround the time the Void Century began, a gigantic armored robot was created for reasons unknown. 700 years later, 200 years before the present, it climbed up the Red Line and invaded Mary Geoise for unknown purposes and circumstances, however it lost power before it could do any damage. The Government ordered for it to be destroyed, but Jaygarcia Saturn secretly ordered scientists to preserved and research it instead, intent to one day use the data they collected for military purposes.[33]\nAccording to Vegapunk, the robot runs on a power source that cannot be replicated today, but was common in the Void Century. It is currently unknown what this is. He was never able to get it to work, being unable to replicate the mysterious Ancient Energy (\u53e4\u4ee3\u306e\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc, Kodai no Enerug\u012b?) that powers it, but it came alive when the \"Drums of Liberation\" began to beat.\nWill of D.\nThroughout the world, there are a number of people who have the middle initial \"D.\" in their name. It is unknown what the \"D.\" stands for, but the Five Elders seem just as adamant to suppress it as they would anything else related to the Void Century. For example, the Government told the public that Gol D. Roger's name was actually Gold Roger.\nThat initial has something to do with the Great Kingdom, but the nature of the connection is unknown. According to Donquixote Rosinante, the \"D.\" has been secretly inherited worldwide and throughout history, and that in a \"certain land\", the family of D. (\nPeople with the \"D.\" all seem to share a passionate desire for freedom and an equally strong belief in destiny and following one's dream. People with the \"D.\" are also known keep fighting until the very end, never giving in until their fate is totally unavoidable, and when that does happen, they are known to smile when they are about to die.\nPeople with the Will of D. always seem to be at the center of major world changing events, like Rocks D. Xebec, Monkey D. Garp and Gol D. Roger at the God Valley Incident, and Monkey D. Luffy, Marshall D. Teach and Portgas D. Ace at the Summit War of Marineford.\nTrivia\n- Gol D. Roger's crew appears to have followed the Poneglyphs all the way and figured out exactly what the missing history is. When queried by Nico Robin on the Void Century and the Will of D., Silvers Rayleigh replied to her that he would tell her the history if she wanted to know. At the same time, he appeared reluctant to even speak about it. He warned her that if she found out now about the history in her current condition, she would not be able to do a thing about it. In his closing statement, he explained that he believed his crew and the scholars of Ohara had been too hasty. At the same time, he encouraged her to see the world herself, so she might come to a different conclusion than the one his crew had.[10]\n- Whitebeard also knew about the truth behind the Void Century and the Will of D., as Roger told him before he died. He told Blackbeard that he is not the one Roger was waiting for, and that just as Roger's will was inherited by others, so will Ace's be. Even though their bloodline is dead, their flames will never die and there will be a man who will find the truth and carry the burden of the centuries upon his back to challenge the world. He further states that the people in the World Government are living in fear of the day when that happens, and a great battle will be fought.[36]\n- Kouzuki Toki was born during this time period, but it is unknown if she knew any history around that time.[37]\nReferences\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 392 (p. 4) and Episode 275.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 395 (p. 7) and Episode 277.\n- \u2191 3.0 3.1 3.2 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 392 and Episode 275, Professor Clover states the grim reality of being a scholar.\n- \u2191 4.0 4.1 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 24 Chapter 218 (p. 5) and Episode 130, Robin reveals her research on Poneglyphs to Cobra.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 110 Chapters 1114\u20131116.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 110 Chapter 1117 (p. 15-17).\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 22 Chapter 202 and Episode 123, Poneglyphs are introduced.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 104 Chapter 1053 (p. 10) and Episode 1080.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 110 Chapter 1114 (p. 12).\n- \u2191 10.0 10.1 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 52 Chapter 507 (p. 4-7) and Episode 400, Rayleigh explains his knowledge of the history to Robin.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 110 Chapter 1114 (p. 11).\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 106 Chapter 1066 (p. 3-4) and Episode 1096, Shaka explains the immense danger of holding the knowledge about the Void Century.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 41 Chapter 393 and Episode 276, Ohara is destroyed and all its inhabitants are killed due to the archaeologists attempting to learn about the Void Century, in what is later known as the Ohara Incident.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 110 Chapter 1115.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 29 Chapter 272 and Episode 174, Robin explains the fall of Shandora.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 112 Chapter 1138 (p. 12-17).\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 48 Chapter 470, cover story: Enel's Great Space Operations Vol. 35, The first of the paintings\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 49 Chapter 472, cover story: Enel's Great Space Operations Vol. 36, The second of the paintings\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 105 Chapter 1065 (p. 17-19) and Episode 1095.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 110 Chapter 1115 (p. 5).\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 110 Chapter 1114 (p. 14-15).\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 110 Chapter 1115 (p. 9).\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 66 Chapter 649 and Episode 569, Robin discusses Joy Boy's promise with Neptune.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 72 Chapter 718 (p. 7) and Episode 648, Gancho reveals Tontatta's 900-year-old history.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 107 Chapter 1084 (p. 7-9) and Episode 1118.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 107 Chapter 1085 (p. 3-4) and Episode 1119.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 90 Chapter 908 (p. 15-17) and Episode 889.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 110 Chapter 1115 (p. 12-14).\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 110 Chapter 1115 (p. 16-17).\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 111 Chapter 1125 (p. 17).\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 21 Chapter 192 and Episode 117, Crocodile mentions Pluton for the first time.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 110 Chapter 1121 (p. 12-17).\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga \u2014 Vol. 111 Chapter 1125 (p. 4-5).\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 76 Chapter 763 (p. 19) and Episode 702, Rosinante reveals to Law the secret of D.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 77 Chapter 764 (p. 7-8) and Episode 703, Rosinante mentions the \"family of D.\".\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 59 Chapter 576 (p. 12-13) and Episode 485, Roger and Whitebeard talk about the Will of D.\n- \u2191 One Piece Manga and Anime \u2014 Vol. 95 Chapter 964 (p. 17) and Episode 964, Toki mentions that even though she is 26, she was born about 800 years ago\n| |||||||||||||||||||||||\n| |||||||||||||||||||||||\n| |||||||||||||||||||||||\n|"

      "text": "When I was a child, I excitedly anticipated the commute my mom and I took every Sunday to our humble Black Lutheran church in Cabrini Green. But what excited me wasn\u2019t hearing the children\u2019s sermons from our youth pastor or the potluck lunches that followed morning service. My excitement came from pulling out my Dragon Ball Z action figures, showing them off to my cousin Jordan, and if I could get away with it, playing with them during the service.\nI adored Dragon Ball. I would book it toward the anime section of Blockbuster to habitually rent out its films and color inside the manga I twisted my mom\u2019s arm to buy from the also very-out-of-business Borders. But of all the characters in the DBZ ensemble of otherworldly warriors, Piccolo, the series\u2019 introverted villain-turned-Z-fighter, was who I felt the closest kinship to.\nAfter scrounging up enough of my allowance to purchase a Piccolo keychain for my mom (I didn\u2019t have a set of keys of my own at the time) from my school\u2019s book fair, my mom asked why I got Piccolo instead of Goku or Vegeta, the heroes of the series.\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s Black,\u201d I answered plainly.\nIf you were to ask any DBZ fan what race Piccolo is, they\u2019d likely say he\u2019s a Namekian, a green slug-like alien from the planet Namek. But when put in context, with him usually serving as the sole representation of an \u201cother\u201d (outside of Mr. Popo but I don\u2019t have the energy to get into that) among a cast of white-presenting characters, Piccolo was my representation.\nMy ability to identify Black-coded characters like Piccolo became second nature as I matured in a world infused with cartoons and anime. Black-coded characters are not technically \u201cBlack,\u201d typically because the race system we\u2019ve constructed is not mirrored in the worlds they exist in. They are instead \u201ccoded\u201d as Black in how their stories or representations often mirror the Black experience in America. Whether it be in the face of adversity from villains or allies alike, these characters stand by their convictions and make sure their voices are heard. Other examples include Naruto\u2019s Rock Lee, Goliath from Gargoyles, and Knuckles from Sonic X\nThis isn\u2019t to say that there weren\u2019t Black characters for me to identify with growing up, either. But they were few and far between, which is partially why coded characters, be they Black-coded, queer-coded, or otherwise, are popular among those who share that identity.\nI wasn\u2019t alone in this experience. Jordan Calhoun, the editor-in-chief of Lifehacker and The Takeout, recently published a memoir titled Piccolo Is Black: A Memoir of Race, Religion, and Pop Culture that explores this very idea\nI spoke with Calhoun about Black-coded characters and how their prevalence in popular media helped shape the person he is today.\nThis interview has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.\nWhat was your \u2018ah-ha moment\u2019 about Black-coded characters\u2019 existence in media like anime and cartoons?\nI think I knew it on an emotional level as a kid, but I didn\u2019t understand it on an academic intellectual level until I was an adult. As a kid, me and all my friends thought it was pretty obvious characters like Piccolo or characters that had a Black voice actor just seemed intentionally Black. They had a story that mirrored what we recognized as the Black experience in the United States. But it wasn\u2019t until becoming an adult that I was able to look at that within the context of the history of animation and a broader cultural picture where animation was really racist in the \u201850s and \u201860s. There was a transition period where Black audiences weren\u2019t really considered as a marketable audience so we wouldn\u2019t get much representation. We just got errant tokenism.\nThe ratio that I describe in the book is a one-to-five ratio. You would have a group like the Power Rangers, and there would be one Black person and sometimes there would be one Asian person and the rest would be white. That was largely because there was a transition happening where Black people were seen as like, \u2018Let\u2019s throw them a bone, let\u2019s have some diversity, let\u2019s have some representation. But let\u2019s not focus too much on them because then we won\u2019t be able to sell these toys. We won\u2019t be able to sell these comics. We won\u2019t be able to sell this merchandise.\u2019\nYou mention in the preface that Piccolo Is Black wasn\u2019t initially written as a memoir. What made you change your mind?\nI didn\u2019t want it to be a memoir. I wanted it to be an approach to all of these same themes and topics, but from a more distant, safe academic context. It would be talking about the history of animation, racial coding, [and] the mental adaptations that Black kids made in the \u201880s and \u201890s during the transition of animation from being super racist to less racist. But my publisher and a few editors who read the early manuscript of the book told me that readers are going to care most about how it affected me as a person.\nHow did you decide what to share and what not to share?\nThe decision that I made was that honesty would be my North Star. Whatever experience I felt, whether I was excited or ashamed of it, whether I look good or bad, or whether other people in my life look good or bad I decided I\u2019m just gonna write things as they happened.\nThe funniest example is that the entire first draft of the book did not include my dad. [laughs] I just didn\u2019t mention him at all. And it wasn\u2019t that I was intentionally trying to write my dad out of it. It was that I just didn\u2019t didn\u2019t think about it. It ended up being probably the first heavy story in the book. It wasn\u2019t until an editor pointed out that a reader\u2019s gonna wonder where your dad is. \u2018You have to either write him outta the book intentionally and explain that he wasn\u2019t in the picture, or you have to explain something of his involvement in your life.\u2019 Is this a comfortable story to tell? Absolutely not. Is this a story that I wanna tell? Nope, but this was definitely formative in my life and helped move my life in certain directions.\nOne of the things that offered me a little bit of comfort in writing the challenging things is that I wrote the entire book from the perspective of whatever age I was at the time. The reader can say, \u201cThis is happening to a kid? Oh, that\u2019s perfectly fine.\u201d Or \u201cThis happening to a kid is absolutely not okay.\u201d I\u2019ll just say the things that it made me think, feel, or do, and readers can decide whether that\u2019s appropriate for adults to have taught that to a kid and if that was a normal response for me as a kid.\nHow were Black-coded characters like Piccolo from Dragon Ball Z, Goliath from Gargoyles, and Optimus Prime from Transformers significant to you as a child and as the writer you are today?\nThey taught me a degree of confidence. Being confident in a place where you are not well represented, being confident in a place where you are outnumbered and you are sticking to your own morals, ethics or opinion. Not to say that you\u2019re close-minded about things. One of my favorite things about Azeem from Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Goliath, or Dinobot from Transformers: Beast Wars was that, in the face of a dominant culture, they did not give a shit. They had a strong sense of who they were and they were gonna be unwavering in what they knew they were right about. That was the trait that I wanted to adopt. I wanted to say, \u201cThis is what I think is right,\u201d or, \u201cThis is who I am,\u201d without trying to bend to the majority.\nThe thing that sticks with me even to this day is that, if I\u2019m in an editorial meeting, I am one of two or three people of color in that room. And I\u2019m still gonna use my voice. I\u2019m still going to stand by what I think is right and not be intimidated, even though there\u2019s a ratio worse than one-to-five. Your point of view can be not well-represented in a room by volume, but you could still have a voice in that room. That was always my favorite thing as a kid: watching characters who had a strong sense of self in the face of a dominant culture that wanted them to change or be silent.\nWhat are the biggest changes you\u2019ve seen in pop culture when it comes to its depictions of Black-coded characters?\nMy childhood experience obviously resonates with me because it was what I had, but that\u2019s not ideal. The thing that I would want for today and for the future is for us to not need to be coded as Black to be palatable for white people or for them to be able to connect with our experiences and to see us as meaningful characters.\nThe racial coding was a segue into a better future. It was a segue in the way that Black people weren\u2019t seen as a viable audience that would actually buy things or carry a TV show or a movie. It wasn\u2019t until very recently in Black Panther that it was proven with an exclamation point that a predominantly Black cast could sell very, very well.\nWhen I think about the connections I made when I was a kid, I look at it in both good and bad ways. On the one hand, it\u2019s really shitty that it was necessary for me to learn racial coding because I had such poor representation of people who look like me. On the other hand, the thing that I celebrate and shine a light on in the book is that we did it. We were able to adapt to that underrepresentation. We found ways to see ourselves as powerful characters.\nWhat advice do you have for other Black nerds who felt or still feel seen through Black-coded characters that you wish you\u2019d gotten as a kid?\nEmbrace the fandom. The opportunities to embrace the fandom and to find like-minded people are far broader today than they were when I was a kid, obviously, thanks to the internet. When I was a kid, being a nerd was about knowing something that\u2019s niche, something that popular culture does not accept as cool. The definition now of being a nerd, for me, is having things that you love enough to want to share with other people. If you have something that you love, whatever it is, that you\u2019re sharing with other people and you\u2019re being inclusive, that is beautiful. That\u2019s the nerd future that I want."
