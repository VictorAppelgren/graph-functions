  "summary": "The US trade deal between the US and Indonesia has resulted in the elimination of tariffs on over 99% of US goods, including wheat, which is a key ingredient in instant noodles. This could make instant noodles more affordable for Indonesians, particularly those of Sindi Noviyani and her family who regularly consume over 20 packets of Indomie each month. The deal is also good news for Jakarta's street food scene, where street food vendors see the cheaper noodles as a boost for their business. The new policy is likely to increase competition among US wheat competitors, particularly Australia's main source of wheat.",
  "shortSummary": "A trade deal with the US will significantly reduce the cost of instant noodles, boosting Jakarta's street food scene and boosting global competitiveness.",

  "argos_summary": "In Indonesia, the elimination of tariffs on US wheat due to a trade deal with the Trump administration is expected to lower the cost of instant noodles, particularly the popular brand Indomie. This change could benefit millions of Indonesians who consume these noodles regularly and support local street food vendors. Economists believe that cheaper wheat will enhance the competitiveness of Indonesia's noodle industry on a global scale, especially as it recovers from pandemic-related downturns.",
