  "content": "Apple\u2019s next iPhone lineup is getting closer to launch, and color may be one of the most exciting changes this year. Leaks suggest the iPhone 17 series will not only bring back some fan favorites but also introduce bold new shades, including one of the brightest colors ever offered for a Pro model.\n\nThe standard iPhone 17 is rumored to come in five finishes: (Pinkish?) Purple, Green, Blue, Black, and White. Either Purple and Green or Purple or Green are expected to return from previous generations, although green sounds more saturated, while Blue has come in many shades over the years. Black and White remain staples for buyers who want a neutral design. Gray has been rumored, but could be a Pro model or no model. Expect the usual aluminum finish for the edges.\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air will reportedly feature a lighter and more refined palette: Light Blue, Light Gold, Black, and Silver. Light Gold is expected to be a pale metallic finish. Light Blue may resemble Sky Blue, while Black and Silver keep the lineup grounded in timeless, versatile choices. These colors could be applied to titanium edges like on iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro.\n\nApple\u2019s high-end models will share the same four finishes: Orange, Dark Blue, Silver, and Black. Orange is the most striking addition and could be the boldest Pro color Apple has released. Dark Blue brings a deep, premium feel, Silver offers a clean metallic look, and Black delivers the familiar professional aesthetic. As for Gray, that color still up in the air. It could be a 17 color, a 17 Pro color, or not offered at all this year. These will look different than the iPhone 16 Pro even if you stick with the same color since titanium is expected to be replaced by aluminum.\n\nApple is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 lineup on September 9, with pre-orders likely to begin on September 12. If the leaks are accurate, 2025 could be one of the most colorful iPhone launches in years.",

      "text": "We\u2019ve previously suggested Tuesday, September 9 as the most likely date for the iPhone 17 event, and a new report says that internal documents held by carriers confirms this.\nThat would mean pre-orders on September 12, shipping on September 19 \u2026\nSep 9 had always looked likely\nBack in July, we looked at what history could tell us about the iPhone 17 release date. Based on the patterns seen between 2021 and 2024, we narrowed it down to the week commencing September 8. We noted that Tuesday was the most likely day.\nBased on this pattern, we can expect Apple to announce the new iPhone 17 lineup the week of September 8. It could be that Monday the 8th, or perhaps Tuesday the 9th. Apple tends to favor Tuesdays for iPhone launches, but last year opted for Monday\u2014presumably to avoid the U.S. Presidential Debate on Tuesday.\nInternal carrier documents support this\nMobile carriers need to make their own preparations for the launch and sale. German site iPhone-Ticker says it got sight of internal documents from at least one local carrier, giving the launch date as September 9.\nAccording to internal information from German mobile phone providers, this year\u2019s launch will be on Tuesday, the 9th September. This would take place the next big Apple event in exactly 35 days.\nThe three key dates you need to know\nThere\u2019s a completely consistent pattern in what happens after the keynote. Pre-orders open on the Friday of the same week, and ship on the following Friday. This would mean the following schedule:\n- iPhone 17 keynote: Tue 9 September\n- Pre-orders open: Fri 12 September\n- First orders ship and retail sale begins: Fri 19 September\nDo you already know which model, if any, you will be buying?
