  "title": "7 Bob Odenkirk Shows and Movies to Put You in the Mood for Nobody 2",
  "description": "Get your Odenkirk fix before (or after) the release of his latest movie.",
  "content": "If you were looking to cast a lead in an action movie involving a lot of fight scenes, Bob Odenkirk might not be your first choice. You'd be wrong, of course; the 2021 action thriller Nobody, starring Odenkirk as a retired hitman, was a success both critically and at the box office.\n\nThe sequel is due to land in theaters on August 15, and while you're waiting, here are seven other excellent Bob Odenkirk shows and movies to get you in the mood.\n\nIf you're a fan of Bob Odenkirk, then you should thank the 2021 action thriller Nobody for the fact that he is still with us. In July 2021, Odenkirk suffered a heart attack on the set of Breaking Bad spin-off Better Call Saul. He was given CPR on the set while the ambulance took 25 minutes to arrive. On The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Odenkirk said that his heart was helped to survive that incident by the fact that he went through two years of fight training to play his role in Nobody, which left him in excellent shape.\n\nIn Nobody, Odenkirk plays Hutch, a man with an apparently ordinary and mundane life. However, when a group of thugs harasses a woman on a bus, Hutch fights them all off with impressive and brutal skill and almost kills one of the thugs. Unfortunately, the thug turns out to be the brother of a Russian crime boss, who seeks out Hutch for revenge.\n\nOdenkirk isn't an obvious choice as an action hero, which is kind of the point of the movie, but he pulls off the role with aplomb. The fight scenes are excellent, and Odenkirk performed many of the fighting sequences himself.\n\nCreating a spin-off series of a movie as iconic as the Coen brothers' 1996 cult classic Fargo is a bold move, but writer and creator Noah Hawley somehow managed to craft a show that perfectly captures the tone of the original film. The show is an anthology series, with each of the five seasons telling a different story with new characters. The show has featured some big names, including Kirsten Dunst, Ewan McGregor, Chris Rock, Jon Hamm, and Ted Danson.\n\nThe first season stars Billy Bob Thornton, Allison Tolman, Martin Freeman, and Colin Hanks, and follows the story of Thornton's psychotic hitman, whose chance encounter with Freeman's insurance salesman leads to a spiraling series of murders that local cops Tolman and Hanks attempt to solve. Bob Odenkirk plays the recurring character of Bill Oswalt, the inept chief of police who continually gets in the way of Tolman's investigation.\n\nIf you enjoy Fargo, you should also check out Legion on Hulu, also written and created by Noah Hawley. It's a superhero series, but unlike any other. If you're suffering from superhero fatigue, this show might just cure it.\n\nNebraska is another movie featuring Bob Odenkirk, but this one is very different from Nobody. It tells the story of an elderly man, played by Bruce Dern, who believes that he has won a million-dollar sweepstakes thanks to a mail scam letter he received. He is trying to get to Lincoln, Nebraska, to claim the prize.\n\nDespite realizing that the letter is a scam, his son David, played by Will Forte, agrees to drive his dad to Nebraska in order to spend more time with him. Odenkirk plays David's older brother, Ross, who is initially skeptical of David's plan and believes his confused father should be placed in a nursing home, but eventually joins up with his father and brother.\n\nNebraska is a gentle mix of drama and comedy, filmed entirely in black and white, and while Odenkirk isn't a lead character, he's a key part of the ensemble cast.\n\nUndone is an Amazon Prime Video original drama series that features Bob Odenkirk in a way you've never seen him before. The show is an adult animation that was made by filming the live actors performing in front of a green screen and using motion capture and rotoscoping to transform those performances into animation. The result is an animation style that captures every nuance of the actors' performances.\n\nThe story centers around a woman named Alma, played by Rosa Salazar, who is involved in a near-fatal car accident. After the accident, she starts to have visions of her dead father, played by Bob Odenkirk, who was killed in a car accident when Alma was a child. In the visions, Alma's father reveals that his death was no accident; he was murdered.\n\nHer father then reveals that Alma has the ability to move through time, and tasks her with traveling back through time to prevent his murder. Throughout, the audience is left guessing as to whether all of this is real or whether Alma is suffering from schizophrenia, a condition that also afflicted her father.\n\nThe show is visually stunning and more than a little mind-bending. Bob Odenkirk is excellent as the dad, and the animation is so good that it's easy to forget you're not watching real actors.\n\nBob Odenkirk is now best known as an actor, thanks in large part to the final two entries on this list. However, he started his career as a comedian and comedy writer. He cut his teeth as a writer on Saturday Night Live, as well as writing and performing on shows such as The Larry Sanders Show and The Ben Stiller Show. It was on the latter show that he met fellow actor and writer David Cross, and the pair started performing in live sketch shows.\n\nThis culminated in the TV sketch show Mr. Show with Bob and David, which ran from 1995 to 1998. Each show is a series of often surreal sketches that transition into one another, with the key characters usually played by Odenkirk and Cross. The show also includes an impressive roster of actors and comedians, such as Sarah Silverman, Jack Black, Scott Aukerman, and Mary Lynn Rajskub. Originally an HBO comedy show, Netflix briefly revived the similar W/Bob & David show in 2015.\n\nMr Show showcases the impeccable comic timing of both Bob Odenkirk and David Cross, as well as their somewhat surreal writing skills. You'll never look at three holes in the wall of a barn in the same way ever again.\n\nBreaking Bad was a hugely successful show that regularly appears at or near the top of lists of the greatest TV shows of all time. It tells the story of a high school chemistry teacher who is dying of cancer and decides to turn to manufacturing and selling drugs to ensure that his family will be provided for. Over five seasons, we see his transformation from a man trying to do the right thing for his family into a hardened and dangerous criminal.\n\nThis is the show that brought Bob Odenkirk into the mainstream. He was cast as the shady lawyer Saul Goodman, but was initially only meant to appear in a handful of episodes in season two. However, show creator Vince Gilligan liked the character so much that Odenkirk became a central cast member for the remainder of the show. Odenkirk himself has described Saul as a once-in-a-lifetime role that he considers himself incredibly lucky to have played.\n\nIf you've never watched Breaking Bad, you should count yourself lucky, because it means you still have one of the best TV shows ever made to enjoy in its entirety. Just make sure you watch it at some point.\n\nOdenkirk was so good at playing the character of shady lawyer Saul Goodman in Breaking Bad that the show's creator, Vince Gilligan, decided that there was more of Saul's story that needed to be told. Better Call Saul is a spin-off series that follows the story of how a small-time lawyer named Jimmy McGill ended up transforming into a sleazy defense lawyer in the pocket of serious criminals.\n\nFollowing up a show as popular and critically acclaimed as Breaking Bad is almost impossible, but Better Call Saul more than lives up to the quality of the original series. It has a different, more character-driven feel, but some people consider Better Call Saul to be even better than Breaking Bad. If you're an Odenkirk fan, then six seasons of watching him play Saul Goodman is about as good as it gets.\n\nDespite starting life as a comedy writer and comedic actor, Bob Odenkirk has become best known for his dramatic roles, with many of the shows and movies on this list being far more dramatic than comedic. That's not to say he still doesn't have his comedy chops. This sketch from the truly amazing Netflix sketch show I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson proves that Odenkirk can still do funny just as well as he always could.",

      "text": "HBO Max is home to some of the funniest original shows of this century. With sketch comedies, stand-up specials, animated series, and more, it\u2019s easy to find something that\u2019ll turn your giggle box upside down.\nI've chosen my personal favorite comedies on HBO Max, based on timing, plot and character relatability, witty dialogue, and overall production value.\n11 Flight of the Conchords\n|\nRelease Year |\n2007 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n2 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n22 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nFlight of the Conchords is a brilliant musical comedy series following the fictionalized lives of Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie. It\u2019s the simple, adventurous story of a multi-instrumentalist folk-rock duo from New Zealand hoping to hit it big in New York City. The Emmy Award-nominated show has quirky situations, relatable characters, and witty dialogue.\nThe funniest element is the duo\u2019s music, with original songs built into the narrative structure. Sometimes they're presented in a music video style that is integral to plot and character development. Other times, they serve as an internal monologue. Either way, you\u2019ll find yourself giggling through every episode.\n10 Insecure\n|\nRelease Year |\n2016 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n5 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n43 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nInsecure is a smart and unfailingly real series showcasing the awkward experiences of modern-day Black women in a predominantly white world. Co-created by Issa Rae and comedian Larry Wilmore, the series follows two best friends as they deal with their flaws and insecurities together in the funniest way possible.\nInsecure is hysterical in its execution and examination of the issues plaguing every single generation of twentysomethings: failed relationships, career confusion, and the frustrating journey to find and accept the self. The show is authentic and socially impactful, with a compelling story and memorable characters. Episodes run about half an hour, so it's one of those hilarious comedies to stream for a quick laugh.\n9 Bored to Death\n|\nRelease Year |\n2009 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n3 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n24 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nWhile it might be a little slow to start, Bored to Death evolves into a quirky plot full of silliness and intrigue. Jason Schwartzman stars as Jonathan Ames, a writer so plagued by boredom that he fabricates an identity to escape his regular life. He creates an alter ego and starts moonlighting as an unlicensed private detective to attract interesting people into his world. His methods? They\u2019re straight out of old detective novels.\nSchwartzman stars with Ted Danson and Zack Galifianakis to give the show a unique blend of unconventional comedy dished out with superb timing. Their strong performances combine with high production value to highlight the show\u2019s ability to be silly yet sincere. Bored to Death is littered with underrated comedy and memorable wit, making it one of the most uniquely funny shows streaming on HBO Max today.\n8 Avenue 5\n|\nRelease Year |\n2020 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n2 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n17 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nHugh Laurie stars in yet another of streaming's most underrated shows, Avenue 5. The sci-fi comedy is set in a time when traveling the solar system has become the world\u2019s biggest business. Sounds silly, right? It is, and that\u2019s what you\u2019ll love about it.\nSet 40 years in the future, Avenue 5 follows life on board the titular ship, a mash-up of a cruise liner and an interplanetary rocket ship fitted with luxury amenities. It\u2019s full of spoiled, snotty space tourists, who panic in the most absurd manner when the ship veers off course into outer space. Things get hysterically worse when their three-week journey turns into three years.\nWhile its comedy is distinctive, its delivery is a tad uneven, but that doesn\u2019t stop this show from being a gem of a dark comedy. It features solid performances, a relatable cast of characters, a unique premise, and a high production value.\n7 Eastbound & Down\n|\nRelease Year |\n2009 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n4 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n29 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nDanny McBride's Eastbound & Down put him on the map as the king of absurdist comedies. He stars as Kenny Powers, a washed-up professional baseball pitcher who\u2019s forced into retirement as a result of his own arrogance and jerkiness. So, he returns to his old middle school in North Carolina to teach physical education. There, he sets out to reclaim his fame and manifest a comeback, all while trying to evolve from giant child to mature grownup.\nEastbound & Down\u2014though profane and obnoxious\u2014is riotously funny with excellent delivery from its cast, who all give such authentic performances that you forget you\u2019re watching a work of fiction. Expect to see the likes of Will Ferrell, Craig Robinson, Gina Gershon, and many more.\n6 Silicon Valley\n|\nRelease Year |\n2014 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n6 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n53 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nFrom award-winning creator Mike Judge comes a genius nerd comedy about the 2010s startup culture. Silicon Valley follows the misadventures of introverted computer programmer Richard Hendricks (Thomas Middleditch). First, he struggles to build his own company, then he and his brainy friends try to strike it rich in a fast-paced, high-tech gold rush culture of startups full of sharks.\nSilicon Valley was nominated for five consecutive Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Comedy Series. It's quick-witted, with joke-heavy dialogue full of hyperbole, puns, and sharp humor, not to mention its parodied yet accurate portrayal of the tech industry\u2019s culture and quirks.\n5 Veep\n|\nRelease Year |\n2012 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n7 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n65 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nIs there anything more entertaining than poking fun at political tropes? Veep does that with such brilliance that, during its seven-year run, it secured 68 Emmy nominations and 17 wins.\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus stars as Senator Selina Meyer, who unexpectedly becomes vice president and learns that nothing is what she\u2019d hoped it would be. Veep presents us with her satirical look at American politics as she stomps out political fires, juggles her public and private life, and navigates her dysfunctional relationship with the chief executive, all while trying to maintain her sanity.\nThe show offers insightful commentary, and challenges the disconnect between reality and fantasy-of-power representations. It\u2019s extremely clever, full of fast-paced comedy and top-notch delivery. You\u2019ll relate to the stress of these characters as it affects their performance and evolution, and its high production value makes you feel like you\u2019re right up on Capitol Hill experiencing the chaos.\n4 Vice Principals\n|\nRelease Year |\n2016 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n2 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n18 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nJust when you think a Danny McBride-created absurdist comedy couldn\u2019t get any better, in comes the brilliant Walton Goggins. His presence makes Vice Principals one of the funniest comedies to stream on HBO Max.\nVice Principals follows rival administrators (and vice principals) Neal Gamby (McBride) and Lee Russell (Goggins) as they duke it out for the head position when the principal retires. However, much to their dismay, an outsider is placed in the coveted spot, forcing Gamby and Russell to put aside their hate and work together to bring her down.\nThe gut-bursting comedy features a unique premise and casts high school administrators in a whole new light. It boasts strong performances from its lead characters, and you'll enjoy seeing them and their relationships evolve just as much as you\u2019ll appreciate their comedic banter. Just note that Vice Principals\u2014while funny\u2014is full of crass humor.\n3 Hacks\n|\nRelease Year |\n2021 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n4 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n36 |\n|\nStatus |\nOngoing |\nYou have my guarantee that you will love Hacks. The Emmy Award-winning comedy follows legendary Las Vegas comedian Deborah Vance (Jean Smart) as she\u2019s forced to collaborate with much younger, but equally stubborn and witty, Gen Z writer Ava (Hannah Einbinder).\nEverything about this show is relatable, from the plot to the characters to their struggles and achievements\u2014even their comedic outbursts. The show tackles issues like sexism, ageism, and the challenges women face, not just in the industry but in the world.\nHacks explores the complex, often hilarious relationship, between two female comedians from very different generations. It\u2019s witty, poignant, and insightful, with outstanding writing and lead performances, and an impressive ability to balance humor with emotional depth. Like most acclaimed shows canceled too soon, Hacks ended far too early and abruptly with season three. Thankfully, after an uproar from fans, HBO revived it.\n2 The Righteous Gemstones\n|\nRelease Year |\n2019 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n4 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n37 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nThis satire brings us into the comedically absurd lives of the world-famous televangelist family, the Gemstones. They\u2019re righteously childish, uber-rich, and completely dysfunctional in their interactions and endeavors. The show follows their unraveling and reconstruction amid secret-bearing extortion plots, inter-faith threats, family bickering, and loads of backstabbing.\nThe Righteous Gemstones excels in top-notch comedy, compelling plotlines, and character relatability, as we all know about family drama and antics. Everything about the show is exaggerated and that\u2019s what makes it a must-see.\nIt offers a satirical, though sympathetic, portrayal of the megachurch culture and those who run it, and poignantly explores faith, family, and forgiveness. Starring alongside show creator Danny McBride are the likes of John Goodman, Adam Devine, and Edi Patterson."

      "text": "10 Best Horror TV Shows To Watch On Prime Video\nAmazon Prime Video has an impressive selection of horror television shows, but if you're looking for the best of the crop, look no further.\nPrime Video is Amazon's streaming service that began as Amazon Unbox back in September 2006. The streaming service has gone through many rebrandings over the year but has managed to successfully compete with other streamers such as Netflix, Max, and Disney+. Some of their most notable titles include The Boys, Carnival Row, and Sound of Metal.\nAmazon Prime Video has an impressive selection of horror television shows, but if you're looking for the best of the crop, look no further.\nAmazon has plenty of great television options to watch, but if you're looking for something more underrated that's still a 10/10, check these out.\nPrime Video's new science fiction is performing even worse on Rotten Tomatoes than a previous version of the same story starring Tom Cruise.\nA new science fiction movie on Prime Video becomes a streaming hit in spite of a dismal score from viewers on the Rotten Tomatoes Popcornmeter.\nPrime Video's latest action series that's dividing audiences and critics is tearing up the global streaming chart just one week after its release.\nAmazon Prime Video's 87% Rotten Tomatoes show had the potential to become a worthy Stranger Things replacement, but it was canceled a little too soon.\nAmazon Prime Video is most famous for long-form series like Bosch and The Boys, but it also has some of the best weekend binge-watches on TV.\nPrime Video's The Assassin debuted to a strong Rotten Tomatoes score with critics, but its audience score may be a problem for the comedy thriller.\nAmazon Prime Video is home to some fantastic movies that were unjustly overlooked by subscribers over time and deserve way more appreciation.\nThese are some of the best miniseries Prime Video has put out, tackling many different subjects and providing a platform for incredible performances.\nThree documentaries about a tragic 2022 murder case climb up the streaming services' charts after the killer's shocking guilty plea last month.\nPrime Video unveils their full panel lineup for SDCC 2025, teasing a farewell to a hit comedy, new adult animation updates, and the return of Gen V.\nFans of Air Force One and White House Down should watch Prime Video\u2019s action thriller starring Viola Davis as the President of the United States.\nPrime Video has a select few movies available for free with ads and they include hidden gems that deserve a chance, completely free of charge.\nHeads of State is just the latest film to debut on Prime Video that deserved to open up on the big screen before making the move to streaming.\nPrime Video's upcoming Vikings replacement series has cast its two lead roles, featuring stars from Bridgerton and Neighbours in the spotlight.\nPrime Video's comedy movie, despite a low 47% Rotten Tomatoes score, defies expectations by soaring into the all-time top three streaming charts.\nA Prime Video thriller series carrying a 78% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes dominates streaming charts weeks after its initial release.\nPrime Video's star-studded new action-comedy movie debuts on Rotten Tomatoes with a perfect score the day it premieres on the streaming platform.\nA high-profile show, from Gilmore Girls creators Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino, has been axed at Prime Video after just one season.\nFrom all-time classics to underrated hidden gems, Prime Video is truly one of the best streaming services for old school kung fu movies."

      "text": "Anthology shows combine the brevity of TV series episodes with the variety of movies, and you never know what the next episode will bring! I've always loved shows like The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits, but today might actually be the golden age of TV anthologies.\nPicking a good variety of the best examples isn't easy, but I think there's something here for everyone, sometimes even within the same series.\n10 Secret Level\n|\nRelease Year |\n2024 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n1 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n15 |\n|\nStatus |\nOngoing |\nVideo gaming is a massive industry these days, and inevitably its influence would flow into the world of movies and TV. It used to be that game adaptations were bad, but with shows like Fallout and The Last of Us it's clear that the stories from games can stand tall with the best of them in this medium.\nSecret Level is an anthology that tells short stories within the various video game universes. My favorite is predictably the Warhammer 40K episode. However, there's a decent spread of both old and new franchises, and of course tabletop gaming, technically.\nA fun and varied anthology of shorts based on different video game franchises.\n9 Electric Dreams\n|\nRelease Year |\n2017 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n1 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n10 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nThere's no overstating how important the short stories of Philip K. Dick have been in the world of sci-fi film and television, and many of my favorite movies are based on his work. I recently completed my physical collection of his short stories that span four rather beefy volumes.\nThe best way to experience his works is in the written form, through the lens of your own imagination, but Electric Dreams (riffing on title of the book Blade Runner is based on) is a solid way to see Dick's stories come to life. Although it was released all the way back in 2017, the budget is decent, and there's some big-name talent behind and in front of the camera. Any sci-fi fan needs to add this to their watch list.\nWhile Dick's works have been adapted into several iconic films, he wrote more than could ever be adapted, and this series brings to life some of his lesser-known works.\n8 Goosebumps\n|\nRelease Year |\n1995 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n4 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n74 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nNo, this isn't the 2023 Goosebumps remake with its serialized anthology format. This is the original 90s series where each episode is based on one of author R.L. Stine's children's horror books. For a 90s kid like me, the original Goosebumps will always be the best. It's cheesy, but earnest, and best of all if you have kids of your own you can definitely watch this with them, since it's technically child-friendly.\nHonestly, the old 90s TV special effects are somehow even creepier than the modern realistic ones, and while every episode isn't a banger, there are a few that are genuinely unsettling and memorable.\n7 Japanese Tales of the Macabre\n|\nRelease Year |\n2023 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n1 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n12 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nJunji Ito is one of Japan's creepiest exports by far, and that's saying something. This dental technician turned horror manga author had clearly seen some stuff in his life, either in the dental chair, or just in his twisted imagination. Personally, I think Ito's stories are most impactful on the page where they first saw the light of day, but this anthology adaptation has its own charms.\nIto's stories aren't particularly graphic, but they are very disturbing and often more for psychological reasons than any visceral ones. In fact, Ito's stories are pretty weak on plot too, so it's best not to think too hard about anything beyond the high concept of each story.\nHorror master Junji Ito's most horrifying and disturbing tales leap from the page and onto your screen. For better or worse.\n6 Marvel\u2019s What if\u2026?\n|\nRelease Year |\n2021 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n3 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n26 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nIf you like watching Marvel Cinematic Universe shows and movies, but don't really read comic books, you might not know how convoluted the different timelines, universes, and retcons are at the best of times. The \"What if\" series of comics do this on purpose, putting forward an anthology that explores how things in the Marvel comic world would have gone differently if you just changed one thing.\nThe TV show What If...? is simply an animated adaptation of that comic series\u2013and it's fantastic. Of course if you don't know the Marvel properties What If...? riffs off, then the show won't have much meaning to you, but if you are familiar with, for example, the Iron Man and Black Panther films, then you're bound to enjoy this.\nAn anthology of shorts showing what would have happened if certain MCU events went differently. Given how comic universes work, all of this stuff is canon somewhere.\n5 Star Wars: Visions\n|\nRelease Year |\n2021 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n2 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n18 |\n|\nStatus |\nOngoing |\nBoth Star Wars and anime are extremely popular, so why not combine the two? In Star Wars Visions Lucasfilm gathered some of the best anime creators and studios in the business to make short films set in the infinite Star Wars universe. It reminds me of The Animatrix, which had pretty much the same approach, creating several short films by different anime creators, that fill in some lore gaps and backstory, if you can imagine that Star Wars still has those.\nRight now there are two volumes with nine episodes each, with a third volume on the way. Set for release in October of 2025.\nBrilliantly-made anime shorts based in the Star Wars universe.\n4 Guillermo Del Toro\u2019s Cabinet of Curiosities\n|\nRelease Year |\n2022 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n1 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n8 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nGuillermo del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities follows in the footsteps of classic anthology shows like Tales From the Crypt, with Mr. Del Toro acting as the curator and host of these varied horror stories, ostensibly linked to the various objects in the eponymous cabinet. Del Toro is a producer of this Netflix series, and if there's anyone who knows the best talent in the world of film horror, it's him.\nThe production quality is magnificent, and what we have here is a showcase of work by both seasoned creators and new talent that deserves the exposure. It's the perfect show to binge over the course of a week, if you can handle that much creepiness back-to-back!\nDel Toro's flair for creature-based horror is given free rein in this anthology of monsters.\n3 LOVE DEATH + ROBOTS\nThe trailer, like the show, is quite spicy. Don't watch it at work.\n|\nRelease Year |\n2022 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n3 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n35 |\n|\nStatus |\nOngoing |\nLOVE, DEATH + ROBOTS absolutely blew me away when I first watched the original season. It's edgy, visually stunning, and brings the sort of sci-fi story to the screen that would usually remain firmly between the covers of short story anthology books.\nBe aware that this is very much a show for adults, but it's not gratuitous. Instead, all that sex and rock 'n roll serves a purpose in storytelling, and many of these shorts will go down as classics of the genre in their own right. This show, in my mind, is definitely one of the best sci-fi anthologies of all time, not just recent history.\nAn amazing sci-fi anthology show made with cutting-edge CG, and the most imaginative art you've ever seen.\n2 The White Lotus\n|\nRelease Year |\n2021 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n3 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n21 |\n|\nStatus |\nOngoing |\nLike True Detective, which I highlighted in my best mini-series roundup, The White Lotus isn't an episodic anthology, but rather a serialized one. Where each season is a standalone story with a new cast. In the case of The White Lotus, the different seasons play out in White Lotus hotels in three different parts of the world. The show has been an absolute phenomenon, with its dark and satirical comedy, and stellar performances, so it's worth dipping your toe in to see if it clicks.\nEach season covers a week of time, as we follow the intrigues of the staff and guests staying at the hotel. They all have their problems, and as each season progresses, the degree of those dysfunctions start to really hit home.\nThe smash-hit darkly-satirical anthology series is composed of self-contained seasons set in different White Lotus hotels, with individual eclectic casts.\n1 Black Mirror\n|\nRelease Year |\n2011 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n7 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n33 |\n|\nStatus |\nOngoing |\nBlack Mirror is the anthology show of the modern age. Usually your Twilight Zone-type stories tell a tale of something that could be true one day, but Black Mirror's stories of technology gone wrong are either just a few years away, or practically already true! That's key to what makes the show so gripping, but it also helps that it's sharply-written and technically well-made.\nOne thing's for certain\u2014you'll never look at your smartphone the same way again.\nThis long-running anthology holds up a \"Black Mirror\" to the utopian myth of modern technology, and shows us the undesirable futures that may be on the horizon.\nI find that anthology shows aren't right for weekend streaming binges. Instead, they are perfect for watching on weekdays. You get to watch a single curated series, but see something new every night. Seems like a great way to get some variety in that TV diet without the need to follow a long complex plot."
