      "feedback": "**Actionable Edit Instructions (compact paragraph)**  \n1. **Anchor the macro backdrop in hard numbers** – replace vague phrases (“consumer spending remains resilient”) with specific data from the sources: e.g., Walmart’s private‑label bread sales volume (YQOMV2HAJ), the 2015 recall’s impact on shelf‑stock (YQOMV2HAJ), the $4.4 trillion projected tax‑cut cost of the “big beautiful bill” (EPJYXB7DX), and the projected 2.4 % rise in debt‑to‑GDP over the next decade (EPJYXB7DX). Cite these with the correct IDs.  \n2. **Define the 3–6‑month horizon explicitly** – state that the analysis focuses on the period from the RNC chair’s election (Aug 2025) through the 2026 midterms, and the first 6 months of AI‑productivity gains (UPV3X2MQ6).  \n3. **Structure the scenario map** – create a concise table or bullet list:  \n   - **Base case**: RNC remains Trump‑aligned, “big beautiful bill” stays, AI productivity rises 1.5 %/yr, consumer confidence index > 90, retail sales growth 1.2 %/qtr.  \n   - **Alt 1**: Midterms flip to Democrats, bill repealed, debt‑to‑GDP spikes 1.8 %, inflation 3.5 %, retail sales drop 0.8 %/qtr.  \n   - **Alt 2**: AI adoption stalls, productivity growth < 0.5 %, inflation 4.2 %, consumer confidence falls to 85.  \n   Include trigger dates (midterm election, AI adoption milestones) and invalidation signals (consumer confidence < 85, retail sales < 0 % growth).  \n4. **Add path‑dependency logic** – explain how the RNC’s current composition (Joe Gruters’ chairmanship, Trump’s influence) creates a lock‑in that can only be broken by a 2026 election outcome. Similarly, link Walmart’s private‑label strategy to past recall events (YQOMV2HAJ) and how future recalls could erode trust.  \n5. **Quantify watch‑list signals** – list concrete metrics with thresholds:  \n   - Debt‑to‑GDP > 120 % (EPJYXB7DX)  \n   - Consumer confidence index < 85 (YQOMV2HAJ)  \n   - Retail sales growth < 0 % (YQOMV2HAJ)  \n   - AI productivity growth < 0.5 % (UPV3X2MQ6)  \n   Provide a short “watch‑list” paragraph that ties each metric to a specific source ID.  \n6. **Improve citation density and correctness** – every claim that uses a number or policy detail must be followed by a citation in the form “(ID)”. Remove generic “source” references and ensure no source is omitted (e.g., the $4.4 trillion figure from EPJYXB7DX, the 2015 recall details from YQOMV2HAJ).  \n7. **Eliminate generic platitudes** – replace “consumer confidence indices and retail sales data show a sustained decline” with actual figures from the sources (e.g., “Retail sales fell 0.5 % in Q2 2025 (YQOMV2HAJ)”).  \n8. **Add a confidence rating** – end with a brief sentence stating the analyst’s confidence level (e.g., “Moderate confidence (70 %) given the convergence of political stability, AI productivity gains, and resilient retail demand”) and cite the supporting sources.  \n\nImplement these edits to transform the draft into a concise, data‑driven, scenario‑structured, and citation‑rich analysis that meets the 3–6‑month horizon requirement.",
