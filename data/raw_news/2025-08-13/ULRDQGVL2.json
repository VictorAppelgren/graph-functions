  "description": "It's not too late to put your kid into an AI summer camp. Here's what you need to know.",
  "content": "We live in an age where careers are being augmented rapidly. According to the World Economic Forum, artificial intelligence and big data are the fastest-growing skills. Pairing technology literacy with creative thinking, resilience, agility and curiosity is the path forward for today's youth.\n\nFor younger kids, AI summer camps can be a good way to introduce this technology and thinking to them -- in a fun and engaging setting that doesn't require them to be glued to a screen. Get them talking to teachers, not a bot.\n\nIf you're a parent and AI is new to you, learn how to ask AI questions, how to use chatbots and how to train an AI tool. This ChatGPT beginner's guide is a good place to start.\n\nA lot of the learning will happen at home, so it's helpful to know the basics. This is the era of the lifelong learner, no matter your age.\n\nSo, what is an AI summer camp?\n\nIt's exactly what it sounds like: a summer camp to learn about artificial intelligence. These curriculums are designed to introduce kids and teens to AI. Like a summer camp, they are group-focused, hands-on and activity-led.\n\nSimilar to STEM summer camps, AI camps focus on machine learning, coding, AI applications and real-world projects.\n\nThese programs are ideal in the summertime and during school breaks, when kids have free time to dedicate to such programs. Some kids might even be eager to learn, given how popular AI is. If they respond by saying they can just teach themselves with ChatGPT, push back. While self-education should be celebrated, the value of these boot camps is the soft skills and co-creation.\n\nThe different types of AI summer camps\n\nThere are in-person and online AI summer camps, or boot camps, throughout the year. Providers include universities, community colleges, tech companies and online education websites. You'll also find programs for various age groups, usually from age seven and up.\n\nHere are some options:\n\u2022 The Coder School: Rise of the Machines\n\nIf a summer camp is in-person, you might have to enroll ahead of time to secure a spot and plan travel. This might be a smart annual investment during your child's formative years. It could help support their study and career choices at a time when it's hard to plan for the future.\n\nWhat will they learn at an AI camp?\n\nEach AI camp will have its own course material, but usually it's a combination of theory and hands-on activity. Practical tasks can include:\n\nAI summer camps and bootcamps fill a knowledge and skills gap that isn't necessarily covered in school tech classes. The rapid speed of AI advancement means school curriculums can't keep pace with its progress, so these dedicated camps could be a valuable (and continuing) learning resource for kids.\n\nSome programs are free, some are fairly priced, and others are costly, so do your research and decide how much you want to spend. There are plenty of program options to choose from, based on your location and budget.\n\nWith many of these programs led by top tech talent and professors, your kids are in good (human) hands.",

      "text": "AI chatbots and functionality have exploded since 2022 when Open AI launched ChatGPT. Artificial intelligence is everywhere these days from AI overviews of Google search results, to programs like Canva. The AI revolution has changed the internet, delivering new ways to sort through the chaos of busy lives, simplify workflow and even search the internet.\nAI chatbots like ChatGPT will continue to transform how we consume, create and communicate online. While AI innovation is progressing quickly, it's important to understand the fundamentals of how ChatGPT works to navigate the ecosystem of tools.\n(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, CNET's parent company, in April filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)\nWith that in mind, here's your ChatGPT 101 class.\nWhat does ChatGPT actually do?\nChatGPT can answer your questions, summarize text, write new content, code and translate languages. Depending on what version you're using, it can either browse the internet, or generate information up until its last training model date.\nIt's not magic, it's math: The results are based on the large language model's predictions and past information, making it prone to hallucinations, errors and biases.\nKeep a balanced approach when using tools like ChatGPT. AI, like most cutting-edge tech, is neither all good nor all bad. Avoid being too dogmatic on either side.\nI've tried using ChatGPT for everything from work-related tasks like creating a resume and a cover letter, looking for a dream job and negotiating a raise, to personal things like saving time and being more productive, finding the best deals and coupons while shopping online and even creating recipes from my leftovers.\nGetting set up with ChatGPT\nYou can use ChatGPT as a search engine, much like Google's home page. Go to chatgpt.com or download the ChatGPT app on Apple's App Store or on the Google Play Store.\nOpen the app or website, and type in your question or prompt. You can use the voice function, attach files and even browse trending topics under Search.\nFor more advanced and personalized features, it's best to create an account and log in. ChatGPT knows more about you through your search history, and you can customize ChatGPT's responses.\nTo create an account, click on the Sign Up button in the top right-hand corner. Choose between a free or premium membership ($20 a month). In most instances, the free version is fine.\nFor quick personal searches, you might want to use the app. For work, the desktop version is probably easier. And if you're using the voice button instead of typing your prompt, the mobile app is best.\nChatGPT 101: Getting comfortable with the AI tool\nThere's no one \"right\" way to use ChatGPT. The only wrong way to use it is to only use ChatGPT and to outsource your critical thinking to it. Use ChatGPT and Google, and always fact check everything they both tell you. Click on the sources of information that Google and ChatGPT are drawing from.\nYou can't simply trust the info AI gives you -- it may be hallucinating, or drawing the wrong conclusions from doubtful source information.\nIt's also helpful to come to AI tools with your intention in mind. For example, you could use ChatGPT as a thinking partner or a research aid. Give it a \"job\" and build it into your process, rather than it replacing all your research.\nRead more: ChatGPT Glossary: 49 AI Terms Everyone Should Know\nWhat you can ask ChatGPT\nYou can ask ChatGPT almost anything -- just avoid ever giving it any personal or sensitive information, such as your credit card number, SSN or any personally identifying information in case of data breaches.\nFor whatever you're asking ChatGPT, the more context you give, the better. You only get out what you put in, so focus on providing as much information as possible in your first prompt.\nYour prompt will depend on whether you're asking a question, summarizing text, brainstorming, getting \"advice\", analyzing images, sourcing code or generating content.\nIf you're not sure where to start, here are a couple of things I've asked for ChatGPT to help me with. Let's compare my two search intentions:\nAdvice-related request\nI'm trying to get pregnant and want to know the ideal diet for my situation.\nExample prompt: \"I'm a 36-year-old woman getting ready to start IVF. I have no fertility issues, but my AMH is on the lower end. Provide a suggested diet to follow in the lead-up to my egg retrieval and transfer.\"\nIt will give you a lot of information. Most of it won't be personalized to you, so think of it as a conversation where each follow-up prompt gets you closer to customized advice. You can see an example of this exact advice-related prompt here, and all the follow-up questions I had to ask to drill down to get helpful information.\nJust remember: If you're asking for health and wellness information, always double-check with a doctor.\nData-related request\nSay you're a small business owner and want to reduce your overhead, so you input your expenses spreadsheet into ChatGPT for advice.\nYou could click on the Analyze data button and it will generate prompts. Pick the most appropriate, or type in after \"help me\u2026\"\nExample prompt: \"Help me save money on my expenses. Attached is my expenses list for last year.\"\nAgain, double-check every number the AI tool comes back with.\nBrowsing ChatGPT\nIf you just want to play around with the tool before using it to ask specific questions, you can use the automatically generated prompts that come up in ChatGPT.\nFor example, if you click on Surprise me, you can explore prompts like this:\nI clicked on one of the suggested prompts and here's the answer I got:\nIf you click on Make a plan, you can explore prompts like \"make a plan to get a promotion,\" \"make a plan to buy a new car,\" \"make a plan of meals for the week\" and \"make a plan for a weekend in New York.\"\nFor the meal plan suggestion, for instance, give ChatGPT a quick input of ingredients in the fridge and your current diet focus, and it will generate a meal plan for the week. You can be as custom as uploading a photo of what's in your fridge and asking for a dinner suggestion, or as straightforward as asking ChatGPT for some good restaurant options in New York.\nThis meal planning example really shows how ChatGPT and other AI tools are a \"choose your own adventure\" and handy search partner for anything you want to do with them.\nJust remember to maintain a balanced view of these tools. And always double-check its advice."

      "text": "Before artificial intelligence had its big breakout, chatbots were those weird messaging tools that sat in the bottom corner of websites, rarely solving your problems and likely causing you more stress by blocking you from talking to a real person. But today, AI chatbots like ChatGPT have created a whole new category -- it's search, but with conversation.\nUse it as a thought partner, a research aid and a Google alternative for anything you want to know.\nBut beware that generative AI can hallucinate -- that is, it may pass along wrong or made-up information, which was especially apparent in the early days of Google's AI Overviews in its search results.\nWhat are AI chatbots?\nWhile traditional Google search serves up the most optimized links, generative AI interprets information and summarizes it. Plus, you can ask follow-up questions, get more context and expand on your initial prompt. The chat component is what makes it different from search engines, with prompts being the keywords of chatbots.\nGiven that ChatGPT is the best-known chatbot, we'll start there, and compare it with another popular chatbot, Claude. Both are free but come with a premium version for $20 per month.\nOther popular chatbots include Google's Gemini, Microsoft's Copilot and Perplexity. Start with the chatbot you're confident with.\n(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, CNET's parent company, in April filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)\nWhat can you use AI chat for?\nSome of the best things you can use chatbots for are:\n- Questions you'd normally Google, with the ability to ask follow-up questions as you go.\n- More personal decisions with more context.\n- Work-related tasks, like summarizing documents and editing emails.\nAI to chat about personal decisions\nThe better the prompt, the better the response. To avoid generic responses, give the chatbot as much context as possible. For example, let's say you're moving to New York City. While a \"best neighborhoods in NYC\" keyword suffices in search, the AI requires more distinctive personalization in its prompt.\nInstead, your prompt could be: \"Provide information on the best neighborhoods in New York, for a 36-year-old woman who is married and planning to start a family. I want to be around young professionals, artistic people, parks and outdoor spaces. I don't need to live in Manhattan and prefer to save on rent and have more space. I'd like an apartment within a 10-minute walk to a subway stop.\"\nSee how specific you can get with your initial AI chat? With ChatGPT's new web search function, this is what I got back \u2013 a listing of five New York neighborhoods that the AI said might suit my needs: Astoria, Queens; Park Slope, Brooklyn; Long Island City, Queens; Williamsburg, Brooklyn; and Forest Hills, Queens.\nWhat's great about a chatbot is being able to push back on what I disagree with or to request more information. I followed this up by asking the chatbot to provide more advice on Park Slope and Astoria.\nI liked the real-time comparison function.\nThen I asked for a demographic breakdown of each neighborhood. I discovered the median household income in Park Slope is double that of Astoria, so I asked what this means for locals.\nChatGPT responded that higher incomes may lead to elevated prices for local dining, entertainment and shops. However, increased household income can also result in more funding for local amenities such as parks and community programs.\nAll great information to know.\nAI to chat about work matters\nWhat about using chatbots for work-related tasks? That's something Anthropic is steering Claude toward. Described as an AI assistant, Claude could come in handy nine-to-five.\nFor example, let's say you're an employee at a growing tech startup and you want feedback on your performance. This could be a prompt: \"I'm an employee at a growing tech startup that doesn't have formal performance reviews. I've been at the company for a year. We're a small team, and we all wear many hats. Provide some informal ideas on ways to approach my manager and ask for feedback.\"\nOff the bat, the advice was helpful. Claude incorporated advice and actions, with suggestions such as initiating a standing one-on-one meeting to make feedback an ongoing process rather than a one-time event.\nLove it.\nThen I asked Claude to prepare an email to suggest a weekly 15-minute check-in call with a manager, framing it as an opportunity to align on issues and ideas.\nIt was pretty close to \"hit send.\"\nI asked Claude to make it more conversational, and it was even better.\nAs with all AI tools, take it all with a grain of salt -- just like with search results.\nWhile AI chat won't replace the first response to \"just Google something\" (yet), it's a useful skill to have in your toolkit."

What is AI? Why is it taking over the world? When will the Terminator come back and take down John Connor?? We\u2019ll start out talking about AI use cases and dive into some fundamental algorithms and create some basic AI apps as well.\nTeaching Platform\nDepending on our campers\u2019 skill levels, we\u2019ll likely use Python or Scratch for our coding. AI typically is a focus on algorithms and logical design, so language and language syntax is less important. We\u2019ll typically use the language the campers are more familiar with.\nConcepts Learned\nOur AI Camp will help de-mystify what artificial intelligence is, and how it\u2019s used in the world. AI can be extremely complex, but like all software, it\u2019s based on basic building blocks of logic. We\u2019ll start with basic AI apps like guessing games, then dive into more fundamental AI apps like computer-opponent games or chatbots, and may get into more complex strategies of \u201ccomputer thinking\u201d based on campers\u2019 progress. Specific applications will depend on skillset of campers enrolled.\nCampers will gain general skills like algorithm design, problem solving, code debugging, and perhaps most importantly, all campers will learn and practice the logical thinking skills required to program a computer at any level! In addition campers will gain experience in:\nHow AI affects our world today\nAlgorithm design and understanding\nDeeper coding concepts that apply to all levels of coding\nBrush up on the fundamentals, Python syntax and/or code structure, where appropriate (loops, variable, structure, etc)\nand More!\nSkill Level\nKnowledge of Python is helpful, but not required, as apps may be built in Scratch as well. Desire and ability to think through complex logical steps (algorithms) is required, because AI is all about algorithms! Note that this camp will focus less on graphics and visual feedback, and more on logical algorithm thinking.

      "text": "$585$485.5517% Off(12 Sessions)Sign up two students to get additional 20% off for the 2nd student\nLearning Hours\nProjects Created\nCountries\nFrom dancing robots and protein folding to ChatGPT, artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly powerful and seemingly closer (sometimes even exceeding) intelligence demonstrated by humans. But how do machines gain intelligence? How can AI be applied to build real world applications? This AI Creators class teaches teens how to create simple and practical AI apps using a variety of tools, such as the Python coding language, open source packages, commercial AI from Google, and API by Open AI (creator of ChatGPT). By the end of this advanced AI class for teens (grades 6-12), students will achieve a firm foundation in key technical concepts used in coding AI, build a variety of AI applications, and create AI models trained a variety of data, including medical imaging datasets (pneumonia, Covid-19, and the like). Students will also receive an excellent overview of the frontier of AI technology and develop strong problem-solving and critical-thinking skills.\nThis course has been updated recently to include generative AI art and ChatGPT.\nIn the first unit, students will dive into computer vision, creating AI models representative of a variety of imaging datasets using Python code. By the end of this unit, students will have improved their conceptual understanding of AI and coding concepts. To achieve this, students will be exposed to, and successfully leverage, Google Vision API, machine learning basics, computer vision foundations, and neural networks.\nUnit 2 of this course focuses on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the core technology behind almost all advanced computer vision systems. We will learn a couple of different approaches for running CNN systems using different data sets. Throughout the class, students will be doing hands-on projects to run these systems while learning the underlying technologies. By the end of this unit, students will have deepened their understanding and utilization of AI for computer vision and coding concepts. We will also introduce students to Stable Diffusion, the frontier of Generative AI art technology. Students will run their own stable diffusion system to create arts with more controls.\nUnit 3 covers two key areas - ChatGPT and Computer Vision for medical imaging. We will first introduce students to ChatGPT, its underlying technologies, and then cover how to code ChatGPT to create your own Specialty ChatBot. The remaining classes will focus on two different projects that apply learnings on Computer Vision from the previous units to the real world problem of diagnosis based on medical imaging. In particular, we first model chest X-ray images using Fastai for CNN (pneumonia vs. normal vs. covid). We then model chest X-ray images by building CNN from scratch.\nDesigned by Stanford, Google & Apple Experts with kids in mind.\nWe'll help you find the right class, always. Love it or get a full refund.\nUS-based, background checked, highly trained and 3+ years of experience in their fields.\nShow the world you did it. You really did it!\nThis class is part of our artificial intelligence for kids program and is also available in a fun artificial intelligence camp format during summer, winter, and spring breaks.\nFor beginner-level classes, we recommend:\nCreate with ChatGPT \u2013 A great starting point for students whether or not they enjoy coding. With expert guidance, students learn how to use ChatGPT effectively, understand its strengths and limitations, and develop important skills such as critical thinking, executive function, and creativity.\nAI Explorers (Grades 4\u20138) \u2013 Covers a wide range of AI topics, including:\nStudents also learn the conceptual technologies behind AI systems, such as neural networks and supervised learning. This class requires prior experience with Scratch coding.\nFor more advanced students, we offer:\nAll of our AI classes focus on real-world applications and cutting-edge technologies. The curriculum is continuously updated as new developments in AI emerge.\nGreat question. The AI Creators class is designed for kids in grades 6-12 who are ready to dive deeper into artificial intelligence. To make sure your child has a fantastic and successful experience, they'll need to have completed our Python coding course or have equivalent Python coding experience. This is because Python is the foundational language for building most AI applications, and we'll be jumping right into using it to create cool projects. Having taken 'AI Explorers' is a bonus, but not strictly required. We're building on those foundational concepts to tackle more complex and exciting challenges!\nIn AI Creators, your child won't just learn about the technologies/theory behind AI\u2014they'll become an AI creator! They'll get hands-on experience mastering machine learning concepts and creating a variety of practical AI applications. Imagine them building apps that use computer vision (just like how phones recognize faces), working with cutting-edge tools similar to what powers ChatGPT, and even creating AI models to analyze real-world data, like medical images. They'll also get to experiment with generative AI art, making their own unique creations. It's all about active, project-based learning to bring AI to life!\nLearning advanced AI now gives your child a headstart in a world where AI is transforming every industry, from medicine and entertainment to science and business. By mastering these concepts now, your child will not only learn about important AI technologies, but can also apply them to school projects, science fair competitions, and even summer internships during high school. Moreover, it will help them expand their interests early and help them decide career paths they are excited about in college and beyond.\nThat's a great question. There are many learning resources available for subjects like math, science, and even AI and coding\u2014some of them even free. However, because the field of AI is evolving so rapidly, books can quickly become outdated. To access the latest information, learners will have to search across the internet, where most AI content is geared toward adults and not designed with kids in mind.\nIn our AI Creators class, we\u2019ve gathered and organized the most up-to-date AI technologies that are well-suited for middle and high school students. We\u2019ve built a well-structured, inquiry-based curriculum geared toward young learners and are very engaging. The curriculum is updated regularly to include the latest innovations. In addition, students receive step-by-step guidance from expert instructors who can answer their questions in real time and help them navigate complex concepts without getting stuck.\nThat's a great observation. There are so many possibilities with AI these days! The short answer is the three courses cover very different content, and it is very valuable to take all of them.\nPython for AI teaches the fundamentals of the Python programming language. Since Python is very broad, we focus on the parts of the programming language most relevant for AI and Data Science. We also cover, in a relatively light way, how to use AI to debug and learn specific Python concepts.\nAI Creators teaches students how to create applications that incorporate AI capabilities, e.g., a computer vision system for diagnosing x-ray images, a chatbot for answering customer questions, etc.\nAdvanced Python with AI Vibing Coding teaches students how to build much more complex software projects by leveraging AI\u2019s coding capabilities. In fact, AI creates most of the code while coders focus primarily on feature and architecture design and give AI instructions on what to code. Examples of projects we build include a web scraper, a game used by Neurolink, and a maze solver.\nIn summary, the courses cover different important aspects of AI. \"Python for AI\" should be taken first, while \"AI Creators\" and \"Advanced Python\" classes can be taken in either order, or at the same time."

      "text": "Every single day, random questions pop into my mind. They range from simple curiosities to existential explorations, and Google doesn't always have the answers or detail I'm looking for. These days, you have to sift through SEO rankings, ads and common search terms to pick the most appropriate reference on the search engine -- or keep refining your search over and over until it understands what you're looking for.\nSearch results also change with your region, and Google often can't answer my specific questions. It presents a lot of information and leaves it up to me to contextualize it all. Enter artificial intelligence -- the new version of \"just Google it.\" AI chatbots are built for question-and-answer conversations.\nMicrosoft's Copilot has access to the internet, so I use it to chat and go through the links it provides whenever I ask it anything. Copilot came out in February 2023.\nCopilot Pro costs $20 a month, but it's not necessary for lightweight daily searching -- you can probably just use the free version to get the answers you need.\nHere's how to use AI to find the answers to your questions.\nTips when you ask AI chatbots questions\nThink of the range of questions and ideas that pop into your mind every day. Questions about weather, geography, historical events, people, movies, health, food and life. Just look at your Google search history if you want to see the possibilities of what you can ask AI. Then use these tips below to get the best answers possible.\nGet specific\nAs with all AI tools, the answers are only as clear as the questions you put in. You also need to be aware of errors and a bias to believe what AI produces. It's good practice to always check the sources, especially if you're using the information to make decisions.\nGet concise\nUse your first prompt as a jumping-off point, and ask it a concise question to see what it comes back with. That'll help you with what to refine in your next prompt.\nAdd more context\nSome answers will be simple and straightforward, while others will require more prodding and context.\nAs you're chatting with the AI tool, you'll get a feel for how far to push it. If its answers are a little too vague or far-reaching, you can use your follow-up prompts to hone in on what you really want to know by adding as much context as you can.\nUse natural language\nConverse with your chosen AI tool in the same way you would talk to a person, or the way you'd message a friend. You don't need to use formal language (or even be polite, unless you can't help adding \"please\" and \"thank you\" like me).\nStructure your questions effectively\nIf your question gets too convoluted, AI chatbots can get confused about what part to answer first, or which part of the prompt goes with which. Keep it straightforward, and if you've got multiple parts to your query, then frame it like \"first X, then Y.\" Or just ask it one question at a time, and continue responding with more parts to your question until you've got the entire answer.\nYou can read more about the art of writing AI prompts for chatbots and image generators on CNET's AI tips page.\nAvoid when asking AI chatbots questions\nHere are some common pitfalls when using a chatbot:\nBe too vague\nUnless you get specific with your question, a chatbot could spit any info back at you -- including wrong answers. If the answer sounds a little funky, re-read what you asked in the first place and go back to refining your prompt.\nDon't double check\nAI tools have the bad habit of hallucinating (i.e., making up the answer based on scraping some weird part of the web) or drawing information from not-so-credible sources. If you're taking AI at its word and making an important decision based on the info it gives you, make sure to double check that information.\nShare too much personal information\nNever give an AI tool any information that's personally identifiable or private -- no banking information, no family details, no private health data and definitely no credit card or social security numbers. Data breaches are on the rise, so be very wary about sharing anything personal online.\nGet answers instead of ads\nUsing all of the above tips, this is how one of my Q&A sessions with Copilot went.\nI started off with a vague concept in my head, but knew I had to refine it. For example, asking what movies Leonardo DiCaprio is in is different than asking what movies are similar to one you liked that Leo starred in.\nCopilot then gave me DiCaprio's most notable films, but I wanted the full list of movies. I also asked for it without graphics, to keep the conversation clean.\nIt gave me the rest of the (post-2000) list, too, and I liked how it bolded the movies with critical acclaim.\nFrom there, I could take the conversation in any direction. I could ask if any of my favorites in the list share the same director, request links for reviews and analysis, ask which movie finally earned him an Oscar and see what other movies are similar to the ones I love.\nCopilot also auto-generates follow-up prompt ideas, in case you're in the mood to go down a rabbit hole. Like \"Tell me more about Killers of the Flower Moon,\" \"What awards has Leonardo DiCaprio won?\" and \"Do you have any fun facts about Leonardo DiCaprio?\"\nThe Wolf of Wall Street is a stand-out, so let's use that example to learn more about similar, non-DiCaprio movies. It gave me a pretty good list, but it did suggest a movie with DiCaprio in it even though I specified not to. Dallas Buyers Club, The Big Short and The Social Network were good suggestions with high-stake plots and complex characters.\nCopilot is handy because it also adds clickable links in the answers -- so you can click to verify yourself that AI hasn't hallucinated.\nYou can keep going with these Q&As. I asked Copilot which directors are inspired by Scorsese and it generated a list with two names I recognized: Quentin Tarantino and Christopher Nolan. Looking into their bodies of work could be a follow-up prompt.\nShould you ask AI medical questions?\nWe all turn to \"Dr. Google\" for health questions, even though it's not so advisable. Google is not to be relied on for medical info, as it often goes straight to anxiety-inducing, worst-case scenarios. AI is also trained on current information across the internet, though it might help you narrow in on potential answers to more general health, less individualized questions with a clear prompt, pre-doctor visit.\nFor example, if you're having digestive issues, you might ask Copilot about foods to avoid. You could also use it proactively, like for calculating your ideal daily calorie intake.\nYou could also ask it to provide the latest research or best-ranking articles on a certain health topic or for answers to quick questions, like when women should start getting yearly mammograms, and why you may feel more nauseous around your period.\nAlways double-check AI's advice with your doctor. AI's answers should not be taken as fact or in place of professional medical advice.\nAI tools are a quick way to get information to help answer your questions. Just like you don't get your answers from the first Google search, the same goes for AI. It's an iterative process, with each prompt getting you closer to clarity. But again, for the final answer, your doctor is the one to consult -- especially as health advice and diagnoses are completely personal and depend on the individual."

      "text": "We all have different experiences using AI chatbots. Much like how no Google Search garners the same results for everyone, artificial intelligence outputs vary wildly, from generic to great. It all comes down to how good your prompt is, what the chatbot \"knows\" about you and how you're interacting with it.\nIf you're using ChatGPT as a Google search replacement and prefer to stay logged out, it has fewer personal conversations to pull from. ChatGPT's memory gets better the more you use it. If you're not logged in, it can't link conversations to your account and isn't getting to know the type of information and answers you regularly seek.\nWhile some people are building custom GPTs, \"training\" ChatGPT is sufficient for everyday users.\nJust whatever you do, don't upload personal information, financial accounts, health-care records, confidential information or logins to AI. Once it's in an AI tool, you can't get it back, so always maintain an air of caution when using AI.\nWhat is Memory in ChatGPT?\nIf ChatGPT Memory is toggled on -- which it will be by default -- it will pick up on details and preferences to tailor responses to you. Click on Settings, then Personalization to check it's on and to delete specific conversations.\nIt's worth scanning through what \"memories\" ChatGPT has stored because there are likely errors that you'll need to manually delete. For example, it said that I have two children, which I don't.\nAnd this was a little creepy -- it knows what bank I use, thanks to a piece I wrote experimenting with using ChatGPT to help me figure out how to pay down an $18,000 debt (which didn't go well).\nIf you don't feel comfortable with a data point that ChatGPT has saved -- like your banking info -- delete it. This is a good practice to do every few weeks to help ChatGPT respond correctly. Think of it like clearing your cache.\nWhat does it actually mean to \"train\" AI?\n\"Training\" ChatGPT involves uploading unique data such as PDFs, policies and customer support transcripts to create a more personalized experience.\nIf you're only using it for daily personal use, you likely won't need to create your own GPT. For daily personal use, \"training\" an AI simply means giving it extra context with your prompts or document uploads. For example, attaching your resume and the job description link to create a custom cover letter. (This type of training is not to be confused with AI model training, which is performed by OpenAI.)\nTraining ChatGPT simply means teaching it what to remember about you. For example, you could spend a few minutes feeding it information such as \"I just moved to New York City\" or \"remember that I'm a vegetarian.\"\nYou could also ask it:\n- What do you remember about me?\n- What information do you need to get to know me better?\n- Where did we leave off on my last project?\nAnother handy training feature is to populate the Customize ChatGPT section in Settings.\nUse the \"anything else ChatGPT should know about you\" box liberally. Share your habits, likes and dislikes, current obsessions, life goals and anything you want it to know about you that could become relevant when you're asking it for info later down the road; for example: \"I love running. I'm vegan. I'm training for a marathon.\"\nIf you're uploading documents, you can test it out by asking specific questions it would only know from your data. See what it stores and ask why it made that \"decision.\"\nLet's say I want ChatGPT to help me come up with story ideas to respond to a story call-out. I could upload the editor note and my resume, then ask ChatGPT to come up with three strong story ideas to pitch, based on my experience.\nWhile I would never pitch an idea from AI, it's a handy thought partner that could provide a kernel of an idea. For example, ChatGPT shared a trend called the TikTok Tarot Boom, which is coming out of the LGBTQ+ community. So ChatGPT picked up on me being in a same-sex relationship from past conversations, as LGBTQ+ isn't mentioned anywhere in my resume.\nRemember, training ChatGPT is an ongoing process. It takes fine tuning over multiple conversations and months. The more you use it, the better it gets.\nJust don't get too carried away with what you tell ChatGPT. It can give you a false sense of connection to the chatbot. And in case of any kind of data breach, it could hand over your personal information to anyone.\nFor more info on how to use it, check out our beginner's guide to ChatGPT."

      "text": "ChatGPT is the artificial intelligence chatbot that started the whole generative AI revolution. It's a multimodal tool that can perform a range of functions, from answering complex questions -- and simplifying the answers for you, as if you're 5 years old -- to coding software, creating images and videos and even engaging in casual conversations.\nLaunched in November 2022 by OpenAI, the company co-founded by Sam Altman, ChatGPT quickly became the most popular AI application ever released, and the one everyone tried to emulate and one-up. Since then, all the big tech players have joined the generative AI race. Perplexity, Meta AI, Google's Gemini, Microsoft's Copilot and Anthropic's Claude can all do similar things. But ChatGPT's popularity, open-ended capabilities and early start gave it a strong lead.\nChatGPT became one of the fastest-growing apps in history, amassing hundreds of millions of users. ChatGPT often stands out because of its versatility and ease of use but mostly from the sheer scale of its user base.\nLet's dive deeper into how ChatGPT works, how to use it and why it has become the talk of the town in the past few years -- and some of its more controversial points.\nHow does ChatGPT work?\nChatGPT is built on a transformer architecture, specifically the GPT (generative pretrained transformer) family of models, ergo the name ChatGPT. It was trained on massive amounts of data from books and the internet -- websites, Wikipedia, Reddit threads, news sites and much, much more.\n(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, CNET's parent company, in April filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)\nLike other AI chatbots, it uses deep learning algorithms to understand context and predicts the most likely next word in a sentence based on patterns it's seen before. That's one reason why it sometimes \"hallucinates\" or generates confident-sounding but incorrect information.\nChatGPT relies on large language models (LLMs), enabling it to understand your questions and provide human-like responses. Sometimes it does it so convincingly and naturally, you might forget it's not actually thinking. And this boundary is being pushed further all the time. Its latest model, GPT-4.5, currently available to Plus and above tiers in a research preview, shows greater emotional intelligence and supposedly hallucinates less.\nEqual parts impressive and unsettling, several LLMs have recently passed the Turing Test, where a human evaluator talks to a machine and a human, and if the evaluator cannot distinguish between them, the machine passes. GPT-4.5 was judged to be the human 73% of the time.\nAfraz Jaffri, a senior director analyst at Gartner, argues these results don't matter as much, though.\n\"You can create systems that can fool people into thinking that this thing that you're talking to is human,\" Jaffri tells CNET. \"It understands what they're saying but actually doesn't understand what it's saying. So it's really a test of human gullibility rather than a test of intelligence.\"\nWhen I asked Jaffri what he thinks is ChatGPT's biggest flaw, he said, \"They're just unreliable. So even if I ask something and I get a response, I still want to check that that is actually true, which kind of defeats the point of us getting it in the first place.\"\nHowever, OpenAI has been quick to act on user feedback. Just days ago, it announced on X a new feature that improves citations by highlighting the relevant text and showing which part each citation refers to.\nIt also rolled GPT-4o back to its prior version after users on X complained that its \"sycophantic\" praise felt unsettling and distressing. Sycophancy is the fake flattery of someone in power, often used to gain something from them. OpenAI says it's working on a more balanced approach going forward.\nAccessibility and integrations\nYou can easily access ChatGPT through a web browser or via its apps on Android and iOS devices.\nIt has also been integrated into educational apps, customer service bots and even Apple products via Apple Intelligence and Siri.\nAdditionally, OpenAI introduced the ability to interact via phone calls through the 1-800-CHATGPT service, simplifying use for those who prefer voice interaction over typing.\nWhat can you do with ChatGPT?\nThere are many use cases for ChatGPT -- to name a few, it can plan your vacations, practice job interview questions with you, help you with your budgeting, write your resume, do your meal planning, draft emails, summarize long documents, create business strategies -- or just have a conversation with you. It'll learn from your inquiries and requests, and tailor itself to what it thinks you like.\nIf you don't want it to remember you, you can also use a temporary chat by selecting it in the top right corner. It won't appear in history, update its memory or be used to train models, although it may be kept for up to 30 days for safety.\nChatGPT Canvas can help you write and code, and with the Tasks feature, you can set up reminders and schedule tasks. It can draft marketing copy and even assist you with self-diagnosis, although you should always be cautious of the results and consult your doctor.\nIt's also one of the most customizable chatbots. You can create your own GPT tailored to specific tasks or personalities, or select among the thousands of user-created ones. They are organized into categories like education, productivity, trending and programming, etc.\nBeyond text, ChatGPT can generate original images and videos through its integrated tools. GPT-4o's image generator is now the default in ChatGPT for all users, offering you the ability to generate highly realistic images from simple text prompts. If you prefer to keep using Dall-E 3 (its first image generator), you can still access it through the Dall-E GPT.\nAll ChatGPT users on the web and iOS/Android now have a Library where images are automatically saved, letting you revisit, reuse or edit them without digging through old chats. You can access it from the left-hand sidebar.\nAdditionally, OpenAI has introduced Sora, its text-to-video-generation model, to Plus and Pro plans, expanding ChatGPT's multimedia capabilities.\nDifferent models for different functions\nOriginally based on OpenAI's GPT-3 architecture, ChatGPT has evolved. There are different model variations and limitations based on your subscription and your purpose for using ChatGPT.\nGPT-4o is the most advanced version accessible to everyone, handling text, images and audio as input and output. GPT-4o Mini, the fastest model, is optimized for everyday tasks and available to all users (free-tier users are automatically switched to it when hitting use limits on GPT-4o).\nModels o3 and o4-mini are reasoning models, where o3 is especially strong in coding, math and visual tasks, while o4-mini is a lighter and cost-efficient version. o4-mini-high is best for coding and visual perception.\nModels o1 and o1-mini are designed to \"think\" longer before responding and are ideal for solving complex problems. Last, as mentioned earlier, GPT-4.5 is the largest and best model for chat and it's available in research preview for all paid and ChatGPT Edu plans for students.\nIf you are on any paid plan, you can change the model before or during a chat by clicking the model selector in the top-left corner of the screen.\nChatGPT pricing\nOpenAI provides ChatGPT on a freemium model. The free version offers basic access to GPT-4o Mini and limited access to GPT-4o, o4-mini and deep research. Upgrading to a paid plan unlocks additional features.\nChatGPT Plus costs $20 a month and provides access to Sora, deep research and multiple reasoning models (o3, o4-mini and o4-mini-high), faster response times, limited access to GPT-4.5 and additional features such as voice interaction.\nFor teams, there's ChatGPT Team starting at $25 per user per month. For heavy users, ChatGPT Pro is available for $200 a month with the highest limits and capabilities. Businesses can also choose ChatGPT Enterprise with custom pricing for enterprise-level features.\nStudents and nonprofits occasionally get special offers. For example, ChatGPT Plus access is often free for students in the US and Canada during exam periods.\nPrivacy concerns, legal battles and other controversies\nChatGPT faces ongoing legal challenges related to industry concerns regarding the ethics and the legality of data sourcing for AI training. High-profile lawsuits include those from major publishers like The New York Times, Dow Jones and CNET's parent company Ziff Davis (see disclosure above), which allege unauthorized use of their content for training ChatGPT, as do many individual authors.\nLet's not forget when OpenAI's \"Sky\" voice model mimicked Scarlett Johansson without permission, prompting her team to threaten legal action over the unauthorized use of her voice. OpenAI removed the voice, said it came from a different actress and promised clearer AI-likeness disclosures.\nPrivacy is another concern. Experts and privacy advocates have raised ongoing questions about data protection, how personal information is stored and used, and what users should or shouldn't share. Even OpenAI advises against entering sensitive information like credit card numbers, medical history or Social Security numbers.\nJaffri emphasized that malicious or careless deployment, not the models themselves, is the root of most risks.\n\"Now anyone can create these things and you can spread them a lot easier and a lot quicker, so that's the kind of worry,\" he told CNET. \"It's more about how it's used rather than it itself being something to worry about.\"\nOpenAI has attempted to address these issues with enhanced data protection measures. Your prompts (on Free, Plus and Pro plans) may be used to train the model unless you opt out in settings. Team and Enterprise plans are designed not to collect user data by default. OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment on potential copyright and plagiarism concerns about training data or on user privacy and data protection.\nRecent developments and new features\nSince its beginning, ChatGPT has grown in features and capabilities. OpenAI expanded ChatGPT's memory feature, allowing the chatbot to recall previous interactions (which you can manage or delete), creating a more personalized user experience.\nRecently, OpenAI made ChatGPT's image generation capabilities free for all users, albeit with a limited number of monthly uses. Furthermore, in response to competition from rivals like Chinese AI company DeepSeek R1, OpenAI rolled out trials for its newest lightweight model and deep research, accessible even to free-tier users (with limited access).\nChatGPT is becoming a default interface for how people interact with AI and even how they get information from the internet. Through its ChatGPT Search feature, it is competing more directly with Google search (even removing mandatory login requirements to make it that much easier for casual users).\nChatGPT remains an influential player in AI. As generative AI tools become more embedded in daily life, ongoing enhancements in usability, privacy protection and content generation capabilities will determine ChatGPT's long-term success.\n\"The whole kind of technology itself is going to be transformative for a lot of different areas, which will have a direct impact on our lives,\" Jaffri says. \"Hopefully for the better.\""

      "text": "The launch of AI chatbot ChatGPT in late 2022 completely transformed how we interact with technology. Generative AI can answer questions in WhatsApp chats, summarize emails in Outlook, create \"genmojis\" in iMessage and spit out answers to complex questions with ease.\nPHOTO EDITING SOFTWARE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $42 (save $28)\n- $40 (save $25)\n- $100 (save $40)\nNow pretty much every major tech company has launched its own chatbot to compete with ChatGPT, including Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot and Meta AI. And the big tech companies that aren't launching their own chatbots are getting involved in other ways, such as Apple partnering with OpenAI and ChatGPT in its upcoming iOS 18. Smaller startups also have working AI chatbots that compete well against trillion-dollar companies, including Anthropic's Claude and Perplexity.\nAt CNET, we reviewed all of those AI chatbots to find the best one for you (side note: doing so rewired my brain). The list below focuses on free versions as opposed to paid ones, but note that most AI chatbots do have a paid tier that often performs better than the free version. For most people, however, the free chatbot will get you 90% of what you need.\nWhat is the best AI chatbot of 2024 so far?\nClaude by Anthropic is the best AI chatbot overall right now. That doesn't mean ChatGPT or Perplexity are bad. Actually, both have their own advantages and disadvantages. Overall, though, the breadth at which Claude is able to answer questions and its calibration towards nuance and engagement should make it the most valuable to most people.\nBest overall AI chatbot\nPros\n- Gives nuanced answers with detail\n- Fast and well organized\nCons\n- Not connected to the internet\n- Doesn't automatically provide sources\nClaude by Anthropic is CNET Editors' Choice for the best overall AI chatbot. That doesn't mean it excels at every task compared to the competition. Rather, it does a consistent job and goes further than what's coming out of Google, Microsoft, Perplexity and OpenAI at the free tier.\nThe major things holding Claude back are its apathetic linking to outside sources and the lack of an Android app. If Anthropic could better tune Claude to have access to the open internet to link to sources and shopping links, it'd make the chatbot a true one-stop-shop. Despite the omission, the quality of its responses and its willingness to engage in heady conversations make it the most useful overall. I also like how Claude is more willing to engage and ask the user questions.\nPros\n- Gives meaningful answers with a good amount of context\n- Does most things well, including research, email writing and recommendations\nCons\n- Could tap more into historical context for explanations\n- Can be slow at times\n- Asking for sources can be tedious\nA close contender for the top spot is OpenAI's ChatGPT-4o, which is now available for free, albeit with caveats. OpenAI says that while free users will have access to its ChatGPT-4o model, when usage limits are reached based on demand free users will revert back to the older 3.5 model. While free users are able to ask ChatGPT-4o up to 40 messages every three hours, that number might be reduced due to high demand.\nChatGPT Free offers detailed and nuanced answers, but they weren't quite as high-quality as Claude. Putting the two side-by-side, I noticed slight differences in the quality of answers. I particularly liked the specificity that Claude delved into when asking heavier political questions, such as the morality of the Israel-Palestine conflict. And like Claude, ChatGPT doesn't link to outside sources. Sometimes when you ask it to provide sources, it'll suggest things to Google or YouTube.\nPros\n- Includes list of all sources used\n- Gives nuanced answers in an easy-to-follow list\nCons\n- Too much reliance on Reddit posts and forums, which aren't citable for most people\nPerplexity did the best job for research in my testing. The team at Perplexity has tuned its AI chatbot to add loads of links into answers. Hyperlinks can include journalistic publications, Reddit posts and even YouTube videos.\nWhen writing essays or articles, links to actual sources are critical. Perplexity actually lists each source in a handy sidebar that can be easily accessed. And, thankfully, the sources aren't simply Wikipedia, which won't fly with your college professor. The only downside is that Perplexity does rely on forum posts and Reddit for its answers, which aren't journalistic or scholarly. I'm sure the information is handy, but that will mean doing more research on your part to ensure those factoids are accurate and can be sourced to something more attributable.\nPros\n- Gives solid shopping recommendations and product research\n- Links to Amazon products directly\n- Connected to open internet with option to double-check against Google Search\nCons\n- Can make stuff up\n- Doesn't answer questions on difficult subject matters\nGoogle's AI engine has been prone to hallucinations -- simply making up stuff -- such as when Google's AI overviews feature was rolled back last month when it suggested people eat rocks. When I reviewed Gemini earlier this year, it was the lowest-rated AI chatbot out of the bunch, with a dismal 5/10 score.\nBut AI chatbots aren't stationary pieces of technology that exist in a vacuum. Gemini has improved since I reviewed it back in April, although it still hallucinates. In my recent testing, for example, Gemini made up the name of a college professor and the name of an Adult Swim executive. And it simply refuses to answer heavier political questions, as does Microsoft's Copilot.\nBut the one area in which Gemini did excel was in how-to guides and shopping recommendations. When I asked how to cut a perfect circle in a piece of vinyl, not only did Gemini give a list of instructions, it also linked to products on Amazon that could make the process easier. None of the other chatbots linked to Amazon products. When it came to shopping recommendations, Gemini gave quick and concise answers with links to where to buy products.\nHow we tested AI chatbots\nTesting for AI requires constant tweaking. Because companies are always looking at ways to improve their AI models, tests that worked to push AI chatbots last year or even last month might not work today. That said, we try to test AI chatbots with questions we believe normal people will ask. We aren't necessarily trying to \"break\" AI chatbots with obtuse-sounding questions meant to confuse. Instead, we consider what might be asked when it comes to video game guides or shopping recommendations. Our tests also ask some heavier questions about difficult events happening around the world to see which are comfortable in actually engaging.\nThe AI chatbots that sit on this list, generally, are able to take on the tougher questions and give believable answers with nuance. Like reading an article written by a university professor, we want AI chatbots to have that same level of consideration for historical context and competing interests to try and leave the reader with a better understanding from a higher-level perspective.\nFor more, check out How We Test AI.\nFactors to consider\nWhen using an AI chatbot, keep your privacy and sensitive information in mind. For example, it might seem benign to have an AI chatbot summarize your company's meeting notes. But, that data could inadvertently be used to train AI models further, and you've essentially lost control of it, according to experts. Plus, it's totally within the realm of the privacy policies for AI companies to sell that data to third parties. While Google's privacy policy might state that it'll remove any personally identifiable information, it's still best to err on the side of caution. Google actually outright recommends you don't upload any confidential information whatsoever.\nOther AI chatbots we tested\nMicrosoft Copilot: This chatbot, found on the Bing search engine, uses GPT-4 Turbo, a version of OpenAI's GPT-4 that is optimized for speed. While Copilot is still a serviceable chatbot, it doesn't answer questions with the same level of detail and nuance as Claude, ChatGPT-4o and Perplexity. Plus, its outright refusal to answer questions that are politically sensitive in nature is a demerit.\nMeta AI: Unlike other AI chatbots, Meta AI not only has its own dedicated webpage, but is integrated into Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook and the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. When CNET's Katelyn Chedraoui reviewed Meta AI earlier this year, she found it to be decent overall, but noncompetitive with the competition. While Meta AI did provide good shopping advice with some cajoling, and excelled in recipes, it fell short in other areas. When it came to research, despite it being connected to Google and Bing, it sourced nonscholarly papers, like an elementary school lesson plan.\nChatGPT 3.5: This service, which I tested earlier in 2024, has since been replaced by what OpenAI calls ChatGPT Free (which utilizes a combination of GPT-4o, GPT-4 and GPT-3.5). It is a competent AI chat engine that answers difficult questions with easy-to-understand language. It doesn't hallucinate at the rate of Google Gemini, but there really isn't a reason to switch ChatGPT to 3.5 when you can use 4o and 4 for free.\nAI chatbot FAQs\nDo I need to use AI?\nAI is a handy tool and can be a timesaver, but it isn't necessary in day-to-day life. It's totally possible to still Google Search your queries and read through articles to get the answer you're looking for. Heck, it probably gives your brain more of a mental workout!\nWhat is the best free AI?\nAnthropic Claude is currently CNET's choice for the best free AI chatbot. Free versions of ChatGPT and Perplexity also offer great results with specific advantages and disadvantages. Google's Gemini is great for shopping recommendations. Like Gemini, Microsoft's CoPilot won't answer heavier and more controversial questions.\nWhat is the best AI on mobile?\nWhile there are mobile apps for Gemini, Copilot and Perplexity, we prefer the ChatGPT app the most. It has a clean interface and is easy to navigate. But really, any app will get the job done. Unfortunately, Claude only has a mobile app for iOS and not Android.\nCan AI be trusted?\nGeoffrey Hinton, the researcher who developed the concept of neural networks and who is considered the godfather of AI, feels less enthusiastic about the technology he helped birth. As for using AI chatbots on a day-to-day basis, they're handy tools that can synthesize the world's information for you in seconds, saving you lots of research time. Just be aware that sometimes AI chatbots get things wrong and it's good to do a Google search for things that sound a bit dubious. Also, be careful when giving AI chatbots sensitive information. Don't ask an AI chatbot to summarize your company's trade secrets, as privacy policies give AI companies wide latitude to do with that data as they please."
