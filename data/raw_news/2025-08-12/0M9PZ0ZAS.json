  "title": "Long-time Nvidia Bull Shrugs Off China H20 Chip Concerns",
  "description": "Ross Gerber, president and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, says Nvidia remains his largest holding despite China's guidance urging local firms to avoid using the US chip giant's H20 processors. He speaks with Yvonne Man and David Ingles on \"Bloomberg: The China Show.\" (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "You're a long time holder of the stock, Ross. I have to ask you then, does this news on video and what China has been urging or at least stressing to its companies, you know, does it change anything in your eyes? Not really. And I guess you gave away I'm not that young either, because, you know, it's been a 15 year churn within media and the issues with China are legitimate because they the chip that they're selling in China is inferior to what the rest of the world and what America is buying. And and it's substantially inferior. So there's a lot of risk of building a lot of systems around the chip when when really it's not the best technology. So it's almost like ceding a lesser position in AI to your competitors. So. So I'm not sure how the chip will do, but it's better than not being able to sell it at all, which was the position we were in. Not you, recently. Yeah. You know, I was going to ask you actually if if the one of the theoretical experiments a few weeks back was if invaded, like the Chinese market, Does the bull case still hold up? I put that question to you, Right. Well, yes, Yes, it does. But no, in the sense of obviously, China will be a formidable investor in Asia as as everybody is and where their dollars will go and how their systems will be built and how compatible they are with other systems are going to be determined now by the foundations of the data centers that are are going to be built. So so quite frankly, from my perspective, you want the absolute best top of the line age if you want to do kind of what the yuan's doing and that's in video and there's no way around in video at the moment. And so so China's in kind of a pickle. So it's do I buy the lesser chips and get going now or do I, you know, try to get them you know, Blackwell's some other way, you know, so so this is a strategic advantage the United States has in technology, which is what we've always had and and why I've always been a technology investor in the United States. A Ross really does report earnings on August 27th. About two weeks from now. What are you expecting this time around? Well, it should be another good quarter. If you look at Marta and all the other companies, you know, ramping up spending on data centers, we're kind of in this core stage. You know, we've been looking at a lot of opportunities because that's what we see as an opportunity and also what clients want. And and, you know, the truth is, we're so early in this process that, you know, you don't want to get ahead of yourselves. We really have not even the power to build the compute necessary to really build the systems that people and vision for the future, including robotics. So so this is really a great position for everybody to be in. And certainly if there's more innovation from other chip makers, there's certainly lots of opportunities. We also our second positions in Broadcom, in my in my fund cadence. So, you know, really it's a great time to be in the datacenter building business and many of the suppliers in that, including in energy. I mean, certainly the concerns over the valuation are always almost a feature here when you talk about in the last few years or so. How useful is it to look at one year forward or do we need to be looking beyond that and looking at the curve looks? Just try to understand what that, you know, how long this runway really is. Yeah, we tend to, you know, being an investor in video for so long, you know, it's traded around 40 to 40 5pe for most of its existence. So, you know, you don't get too many opportunities under that number. What I'm kind of amazed at is that it still trades at that multiple when you have other stocks in a very frothy market trading at quite you know, a lot of stocks are trading at 100 times earnings in their growth stories, but the premiums now are extreme in the markets. And yet in video, which is the best story in the market with the best CEO in the market, you know, for some reason is still at, I'd say a market multiple for big cap tech. So, you know, it's hard not to like Nvidia. You know it's our our biggest position you know and it just keeps growing and I'm loathe to sell it. Even though we're wildly overweight and certain client accounts, especially these early investors that that did get in that early because I'm a gamer, you know and that's the roots of Nvidia's business. And I was fortunate to be a gamer and figure out in video 50 years ago, you know, and then being in autonomy. So knowing what I know about autonomy and how that's growing so exponentially there. So and then cryptocurrencies, which is also GPU based driven systems. So like almost everything is right for this company and investors need to own it.",

  "summary": "Long-time Nvidia shareholder, Ross H20 Chip Concerns have been raised about the company's H20 chip being sold in China as inferior to what the rest of the world and what America is buying. The chip is inferior to the ones sold in the US and other countries, making it potentially a risk of building a lot of systems around the chip for the wrong purpose. However, Ross argues that China will be a significant investor in Asia, particularly in the video industry. He also notes that China's focus will be on the foundations of the data centers that are being built. Despite these concerns, Ross believes the US has a strategic advantage in technology and sees it as a great opportunity for companies like Nvidia. Despite this, Ross remains a long-time fan of the stock, despite concerns over valuation and potential challenges to the company. He concludes that Nvidia's stock is still the best story in the market, trading at a significant multiple multiple multiple in a frothy market.",
