  "content": "No way should the court grant Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs\u2019 request to do his hard time in home confinement on his private Miami island.\n\nYes, he avoided guilty verdicts on the most serious charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, which could\u2019ve landed him a lifetime behind bars, but his convictions are still serious.\n\nThey include two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution \u2014 meaning he hired male escorts, flew them across the country, then forced his girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, and another unnamed woman to have sex with them.\n\nAnd yes, that\u2019s the Cassie that a hotel security tape shows Diddy brutally attacking then dragging across the floor.\n\nHouse arrest at Combs\u2019 palatial compound \u2014 worth a staggering $48.5 million \u2014 isn\u2019t a punishment at all, it\u2019s a vacation.\n\nThe 14,800-square-foot mansion on Star Island, one of the priciest zip codes in America, features multiple pools, a spa and even cabana-style pool houses; it\u2019s not Rikers but Ritz Carlton.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s the scene of many of his drug-fueled \u201cfreak-offs\u201d: The feds\u2019 raid of the home last March found AR-15s, a cornucopia of drugs, boxes full of stripper heels, baskets full of lube and an array of sex toys.\n\nSaying \u201cit\u2019s impossible\u201d for Combs \u201cto show he poses no danger to any person,\u201d Judge Arun Subramian has already denied his request for a $50 million bond to await sentencing at his Miami estate, leaving him in a Brooklyn detention center where he belongs.\n\nSounds like Diddy is headed not to \u201cjail at home\u201d but to something a lot closer to the 51-to 63 months in prison that federal prosecutors want, which is at least a start on real justice.",

Despite avoiding guilty verdicts on the most serious charges, these convictions still carry serious implications.

But mineral independence won\u2019t be easy. \u201cIt takes more than seven years to secure a permit for mining something other than coal or gravel on public land.\u201d The prez is \u201ctrying to remove some of the industry\u2019s obstacles,\u201d yet \u201cthe future pace and success of rare earth extraction in the U.S. remains decidedly uncertain.\u201d\nForeign desk: UK Regime Change Is Coming\n\u201cBritain\u2019s regime forfeited its people\u2019s trust by bungling the economy, bringing in millions of immigrants, and failing to defend the borders,\u201d argues Dominic Green at The Wall Street Journal. \u201cIt now suppresses legitimate responses by trying to interdict private communications and isolate the British from their free-speaking American cousins. But any teenager with a virtual private network can get around the Great Firewall of London.\u201d So Brits \u201chave turned against the regime,\u201d and \u201cthe regime is turning against the people\u201d \u2014 but \u201cit can\u2019t silence them all.\u201d Prime Minister Keir Starmer & Co. \u201cwill go down with the ship. It\u2019s still unclear what kind of regime can refloat Britain and restore its traditional freedoms. Still, regime change is coming.\u201d\nLiberal: Dems\u2019 Disastrous Denial on Disorder\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a fact,\u201d warns the Liberal Patriot\u2019s Ruy Teixeira, \u201cthat most Americans think the social order is falling apart.\u201d Polls show that 66% \u201cflat-out believe \u2018society is broken,\u2019\u201d which \u201craises troubling questions about the current state of the Democratic Party.\u201d Democrats \u201cdon\u2019t recognize\u201d that voters who observe the \u201crolling crisis of the social order\u201d also think \u201cDemocrats are utterly useless at resolving it.\u201d That Dems won\u2019t even acknowledge the problem leads many to suspect \u201cmost Democrats are basically okay with their place in the broken social order.\u201d Dems must admit that they, and \u201cnot just Republicans,\u201d bear \u201cgrave responsibility\u201d for a collapsing social order. Instead, \u201cthings fall apart and Democrats are currently just poking around in the wreckage.\u201d\nCulture watch: Academia\u2019s Sydney Problem\nThat Sydney Sweeney ad campaign \u201ddidn\u2019t \u201cthreaten academia because it was political. It threatened academia because it wasn\u2019t political at all,\u201d claim Kevin Waldman & Forest Romm at The Hill. \u201cIn showcasing her \u2018great jeans,\u2019 Sweeney doesn\u2019t posture. She doesn\u2019t apologize for her \u2018privilege\u2019 \u2014 whether attractiveness, \u2018whiteness\u2019, or able-bodiedness.\u201d She \u201csimply exists.\u201d The ensuing furor \u201cwas incubated in elite institutions,\u201d where \u201ctoday\u2019s curricula often encourage students to devalue and disavow any aspect of identity not classified as \u2018marginalized,\u2019 such as maleness or heterosexuality.\u201d \u201cA figure like Sweeney \u2014 marked by ease, absence of political dog whistles, and comfort in a traditionally beautiful body \u2014 quietly opposes this climate\u201d and so \u201crepresents a loss of control for the prevailing ideological apparatus, which demands punishment.\u201d\nLibertarian: An Unconstitutional Alcohol Ruling\nThough the \u201cSupreme Court has struck down protectionist state wine and liquor laws,\u201d this week \u201ca federal appellate court upheld an Indiana law that forbids out-of-state retailers from shipping wine directly to Indiana consumers,\u201d fumes Reason\u2019s Damon Root. The Constitution\u2019s \u201cDormant Commerce Clause\u201d forbids states \u201cfrom erecting their own interstate economic barriers,\u201d and the new ruling also \u201cwould seem to be at odds with the principles of interstate free trade embraced by\u201d the Supreme Court in two prior decisions. This \u201cmay not sound like the most pressing legal dispute of the day,\u201d but \u201cthe Constitution does protect the right to earn a living free from arbitrary and unnecessary government interference.\u201d\n\u2014 Compiled by The Post Editorial Board"

      "text": "Inside Diddy\u2019s Miami Beach mansion filled with guns, ammo, stilettos, lube and sex toys\nSex toys, stiletto heels, AR-15s, ammunition and a cornucopia of illicit drugs, baby oil and personal lubricant were all found in Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs\u2019 Miami Beach mansion \u2013 and the feds have the receipts.\nJurors saw dozens of images from the Bad Boy Records founder\u2019s mansion Tuesday afternoon and into Wednesday morning in his sex-trafficking and racketeering trial held in Manhattan federal court.\nCombs at one point sat with his head in his hands as Homeland Security Special Agent Gerard Gannon delved into the depraved fruits from the dramatic March 24, 2024, search \u2013 months before the music mogul was arrested.\n\u201cThese are the red heels,\u201d Gannon said, describing a photo showing the contents of Combs\u2019 master closet, which also contained a sex toy.\nThe agent\u2019s testimony about the raid \u2013 which yielded roughly 500 photos snapped by the feds \u2013 kicked off a whirlwind day in Combs\u2019 trial as prosecutors called as witnesses another of the artist\u2019s former employees and a forensic psychologist once hired by Amber Heard in her legal battle against Johnny Depp.\nBut the evidence photos perhaps gave the clearest glimpse into Combs\u2019 perverse personal life.\nThe snaps captured sex toys, such as multiple dildos sitting on one of Combs\u2019 cabinet shelves, as well as lingerie, BDSM gear, women\u2019s black and red stiletto heels and a lacy negligee.\nHe also had containers jam-packed with 25 bottles of baby oil and 30 bottles of Astroglide personal lubricant were found stored next to \u201cfood-grade\u201d nitrous oxide, or \u201cWhip-Its,\u201d photos show.\nNumerous images displayed gun parts, ammunition and a handgun.\nOne photo showed parts for AR-15 semi-automatic firearms that were found in the fallen mogul\u2019s primary bedroom closet and another picture displayed bullets for a .45-caliber gun.\nAgents also found a cache of drugs, ranging from MDMA to cocaine to ketamine, Gannon testified.\nCombs\u2019 bathroom mirror was scrawled with handwritten messages hyping the hip-hop star up, the photos show.\n\u201cYou a legend,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re an icon Puff Daddy\u201d and \u201cUpward Motion\u201d could be seen written on the mirror in the gilded, the marble-tiled room.\nWhether Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs wrote the inspirational messages \u2014 which included \u201cWhat Do You WANT?\u201d \u2014 was unclear.\nGannon \u2014 who works in Homeland Security\u2019s human trafficking investigations group \u2014 testified about being apart of a group of 80 or 90 agents who conducted the search during his two days on the stand.\nThe house was on Star Island \u2014 where a lot of \u201ccelebrities and rich people live,\u201d Gannon told the jury.\nDuring the dramatic raid, agents used an armored car \u201cto break open the gate,\u201d he testified.\nCombs\u2019 Holmby Hills home in the Los Angeles area was also raided the same day.\nAfter Gannon gave a tour inside Combs\u2019 wild home, prosecutors called forensic psychologist Dawn Hughes to testify about the inner life of people \u2013 such as star witness Cassie Ventura \u2013 who remain in abusive relationships.\nHughes, who previously testified for \u201cAquaman\u201d actress Heard, said such victims feel trapped, because there is often love involved and the cycle of physical or emotional abuse makes planning a way out hard.\nDefense attorney Jonathan Bach tried to undercut Hughes by arguing she has an inherent bias, noting her past testimony for prosecutors in domestic violence cases.\nThe argument prompted a spate of long sidebars between Judge Arun Subramanian, prosecutors and Combs\u2019 lawyers.\nSubramanian joked with jurors about playing elevator music during those private discussions, rather than the white noise loudly blaring over speakers so they and others in the courtroom can\u2019t hear the conversations.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get some Muzak put in for some white noise next time\u201d Subramanian quipped.\nWhen the psychologist\u2019s testimony ended, prosecutors called Combs\u2019 former employee George Kaplan took the stand.\nHe told jurors that the volatile Combs made \u201cmonthly threats\u201d to fire him during his stint as an executive assistant at Combs Enterprises between December 2013 and December 2015.\nThe former assistant \u2013 who said he worked 80 to 100 hours a week \u2013 recalled one time when Combs became \u201cangry\u201d with him because he bought two half gallons of water instead of the single gallon that his boss had requested.\nKaplan also testified he booked rooms for the \u201cI\u2019ll Be Missing You\u201d singer at hotels including The Bel-Air Hotel, Trump International, Mr. C Hotel and the InterContinental Hotel, where Combs infamously was caught on tape beating up his then-girlfriend Ventura in 2016.\nHe said he booked the rooms under the name Frank Black, which he said was a reference to the Biggie Smalls \u2014 since the famous rapper also went by the nickname Frank White, after a character in the 1990 film \u201cKing of New York.\u201d\nKaplan said he packed Combs\u2019 bag for the hotel stays, which he made sure contained clothing, a speaker, candles, liquor, baby oil and Astroglide personal lubricant.\nAfter the hotel visits, Kaplan said he collected Combs\u2019 belongings and made sure the rooms were \u201csomewhat\u201d put back in acceptable shape.\nKaplan had planned to plead the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination until prosecutors offered him immunity.\nRapper Kid Cudi \u2013 whose real name is Scott Mescudi \u2014 is expected to take the stand Thursday after Kaplan finishes testifying.\nProsecutors claim Combs, 55, ran a criminal enterprise for over 10 years with his employees\u2019 help, including forcing heavily drugged-up women to have sex with escorts while he recorded it and pleasured himself.\nHe has pleaded not guilty."

      "text": "President Trump, do what\u2019s right for NYC and endorse Mayor Eric Adams for re-election\nPresident Trump, if you decide to get involved in this year\u2019s mayoral race, do what\u2019s right for the city we all love: Back Eric Adams.\nWith his commitment to public safety and civic pride, Adams has shown he deserves a second term in Gracie Mansion.\nHe has stood up to the left-wing legislators of Albany and the City Council, the radicals who want to legalize theft, hold no one on bail and empty all the jails.\nFor the first half of this year, New York enjoyed the lowest number of shootings since the city started keeping track.\nThat didn\u2019t happen by accident.\nSocialist Zohran Mamdani would reverse all that progress.\nThe \u201cDefund the police\u201d activist would hobble the NYPD, drive away businesses and make the streets unsafe.\nWe agree Mamdani must be stopped.\nBut don\u2019t believe that Andrew Cuomo, who already failed to beat him once, is the answer.\nHe\u2019s everything at once\nReports are that Cuomo\u2019s campaign is heavily lobbying you to help him in the New York City mayoral race.\nDon\u2019t listen to him, Mr. President: You know as well as we do that Cuomo cannot be trusted \u2014 except to betray anyone and everyone as fits his convenience.\nFor starters, consider how he treated you during your first term, casting doubt on the \u201cTrump vaccine.\u201d\nThen, once Democrats decided it was their vaccine, Cuomo was a leader of the \u201cYou must get jabbed or you\u2019ll be fired\u201d crew.\nCuomo was for fracking until he was against fracking.\nHe was for charter schools until he was against charter schools.\nHe signed all of the \u201cno bail\u201d laws and other \u201creforms\u201d that caused crime to skyrocket, but now claims he would \u201cfix\u201d them.\nAnd he still refuses to admit those laws were a mistake.\nHeck, he won\u2019t admit to any mistake, ever.\nHow wormy is he?\nOn Thursday (after planting stories to the contrary), Cuomo flatly denied talking to you recently.\nHe\u2019s also blatantly contradicting himself on how hard he\u2019ll \u201cfight Trump\u201d: He recently told business leaders that he\u2019s not \u201cpersonally\u201d looking for conflict with the president.\nHah!\nA month ago, in advance of the Democratic primary, he was vowing he\u2019d \u201cspend eight years in Washington\u201d fighting against your agenda.\nNo: If you care about the city\u2019s future, the man to support is Eric Adams.\nAdams was one of the few Democrats who stood up to Joe Biden, telling the truth about the massive border crisis.\nAnd for that, the previous administration punished him and New York City.\nFound his footing\nThere have been missteps, but Adams has lately found his footing \u2014 particularly by finding a great police commissioner in Jessica Tisch.\nAnother positive sign: The Police Academy just graduated its largest class in years.\nQualified young folks want to join New York\u2019s Finest, confident that they have a commish and mayor who\u2019ll have their backs.\nAn Adams re-election would mean that excellent work will continue.\nA Commissioner Tisch won\u2019t be there under a Cuomo or Mamdani.\nWe\u2019re sure Cuomo\u2019s pollsters painted a picture about the former governor\u2019s chances, but they were wrong in the primary and they are wrong now.\nAll Cuomo is doing is selfishly splitting the vote, trying to hold on to one last shred of relevancy.\nAdams is supported in his re-election bid by all of the police unions and all the major black churches.\nYou know New York, Mr. President, and understand that\u2019s a remarkable coalition \u2014 a perfect start on building a majority in November."

      "text": "Douglas Murray: Mamdani smears Cuomo for allegedly talking to Trump \u2014and yet associates himself with Mahmoud Khalil\n\u201cDemocratic socialist\u201d Zohran Mamdani is trying to smear one of his rivals by association.\nThe Democratic mayoral nominee claimed Wednesday that former Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently spoke to President Trump by phone.\nMamdani claimed that the two men had been \u201cconspiring about the fate of this city.\u201d\nFor his part, Cuomo has denied that he has even had a phone call with the president.\nBut so what if he had?\nIs the president of the United States \u2014 a man who won the popular vote last November \u2014 so fringe that no candidate for mayor of New York should even speak with him?\nThat seems to be Mamdani\u2019s view.\nKeep away from fringe, wacko figures like, er, the president of this country.\nBut if Mamdani is so keen on guilt by non-association, why not apply the same standard to him?\nTo that end, it would be good to know why Mamdani has been so happy to advocate for, associate with and even campaign alongside Mahmoud Khalil, formerly of Columbia University.\n\u2018A moral victory\u2019\nReaders will remember that Khalil was the former student who was weirdly living with his wife in student accommodations but whose main occupation seemed to be leading student protests at Columbia since October 2023.\nIt is Khalil\u2019s group \u2014 Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD) \u2014 that declared the Oct. 7 massacre \u201ca moral, military and political victory\u201d and declared that as an organization, CUAD was \u201cfighting for the total eradication of Western civilization.\u201d\nAfter discovering that Khalil \u2014 a foreign national \u2014 had lied on his visa application, praised terrorists and organized unrest in New York, ICE detained Khalil.\nHe promptly became one of the great poster boys of the anti-American left.\nThey decided that nobody in America will be free until Mahmoud Khalil is free.\nThey decided that Khalil had done nothing wrong and was indeed a free-speech martyr.\nIt\u2019s funny the people some folks are willing to make into folk heroes.\nSince his release from ICE detention, Khalil has been playing the same sob story as his wife did while he was in custody \u2014 claiming that America had been exceptionally mean to him.\nApparently all he wanted to do was to study in the US. Something he appears to have spent almost zero time actually doing \u2014 preferring the path of agitation.\n\u2018Had to reach\u2019\nNow, in an interview out this week, Khalil has once again exposed his real views and intent.\nIn an interview with Ezra Klein of the New York Times, he talked about why he came to America in the first place.\nHe said he was attracted to \u201cthe quality of education\u201d in this country, knew about Columbia because of its reputation in \u201cPalestinian circles\u201d and was pleased to get a scholarship in 2018.\nHe didn\u2019t exactly reward this country for the honor and opportunities it gave him.\nIn fact, he seems to have found one of the most radical campuses in America to be not radical enough for him.\n\u201cThe anti-Palestinian sentiment at Columbia was very obvious,\u201d he now claims \u2014 a statement so deranged that you wonder whether Khalil knows the difference between up and down, earth and sky.\nBut it is his statements about Hamas and the October 7 massacre that are most disgusting. Asked about his reaction to the events of that day, he said: \u201cIt felt frightening that we had to reach this moment in the Palestinian struggle.\u201d\nApart from asking who the \u201cwe\u201d is in that sentence, I\u2019d love to know why Khalil thinks that raping women and massacring young people at a dance party is some kind of inevitability.\nAccording to Khalil, \u201cWe [again] couldn\u2019t avoid such a moment.\u201d\n\u2018Palestinians are here\u2019\nPushed lightly on why it was necessary to murder babies and kidnap pensioners, Khalil went on to explain that the problem was that the Israelis were trying to make a peace and normalization deal with the Saudis.\nSomething that would have added to the extraordinary success of the Abraham Accords that had been signed with other Arab countries.\nKhalil thinks the idea of \u201cnormalization\u201d is appalling.\nIn his view, the Palestinians \u201care not being heard\u201d and so the atrocities and barbarism of October 7 were an \u201cattempt to tell the world that Palestinians are here.\u201d\nThat\u2019s certainly one hell of a way to tell people.\n\u2018It was not inevitable\u2019\nIn case it isn\u2019t obvious, this is pure apologism for Hamas.\nModerate, peace-loving Palestinian voices comprehensively refute Khalil\u2019s evil view. For instance, the proud American, Gazan-born Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, said yesterday, \u201cKhalil invoked the repetitive and tired idea that the October 7 attack by Hamas was an inevitability, when the truth is far more straightforward and needs to be told by Gazan voices and those who are impacted by the war.\u201d\n\u201cOctober 7 was a choice, not an inevitability! A choice that two psychopaths made from within Hamas\u2019 military wing, Sinwar and Al-Deif. It was not inevitable that Gaza had to be the source of the worst single-day attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust.\u201d\nHe went on: \u201cHamas squandered billions of dollars and tens of thousands of lives for a fraudulent resistance narrative.\u201d\nUnfortunately, Khalil is one of many arrivals in this country who have pushed that fraudulent narrative.\nThe same people who claim, as Khalil went on to claim in his interview with Klein, that the bloody and murderous Second Intifada (2000-2005) was a mostly \u201cpeaceful uprising.\u201d\nSo, Mr. Mamdani, if Gov. Cuomo is to be smeared for having the audacity to even be reported to have spoken to the US president, what are we to make of you knowingly and repeatedly associating with a terrorist mouthpiece?\nWhat are the voters of New York to think about a candidate for mayor who is so happy to advocate for terrorists for years and associate himself even now with someone who makes such excuses for terrorism?\nAny candidate for mayor who thinks President Trump is a more reprehensible figure than a Hamas apologist should be nowhere near the running of this city."

As of December, that figure dropped by 9% to $7.58 million.\nAdvertisement\nPrice neighborhoods in San Francisco, including Polk Gulch, Mission Dolores, Lower Haight, and South of Market, also saw double-digit percentage declines in home values over the course of the past three years, according to Zillow.\nNew York and San Francisco have both been plagued in recent years by a decline in the quality of life that local residents have blamed on surging crime rates, rampant homelessness, high taxation, and increasingly unaffordable cost of living.\nFlorida, Texas, and other Sun Belt states have been the beneficiaries of a significant gain in inflow migration in recent years thanks to overall lower cost of living, warmer weather, more lax COVID restrictions, and a friendlier business environment.\nFederal government data shows that Florida recently surpassed New York State in the number of nonfarm jobs for the first time in 40 years.\nLast week, Stephen Ross, the billionaire real estate developer behind the Hudson Yards project, predicted that New Yorkers will continue to move to Florida due to the relative \u201cease of living\u201d in the Sunshine State.\nIn 2022, more New Yorkers moved to Florida than in any year in history, official statistics show."

He faced federal charges of coercing girlfriends into having drug-fueled sex marathons with male sex workers while he watched and filmed them.\nHe was acquitted last month of the top charges \u2014 racketeering and sex trafficking \u2014 while being convicted of two counts of a prostitution-related offense.\nIn denying Combs\u2019 $50 million bond proposal, Judge Arun Subramanian said the hip hop impresario had failed to prove that he did not pose a risk of flight or danger, adding that the record did not show an \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d that would justify his release after a conviction that otherwise requires detention.\nCombs\u2019 arguments \u201cmight have traction in a case that didn\u2019t involve evidence of violence, coercion, or subjugation in connection with the acts of prostitution at issue, but the record here contains evidence of all three,\u201d the judge wrote.\nMessages seeking comment were sent to prosecutors and one of Combs\u2019 lawyers.\nThe conviction carries the potential for up to 10 years in prison. But there are complicated federal guidelines for calculating sentences in any given case, and prosecutors and Combs\u2019 lawyers disagree substantially on how the guidelines come out for his case.\nThe guidelines aren\u2019t mandatory, and Subramanian will have wide latitude in deciding Combs\u2019 punishment.\nThe Bad Boy Records founder, now 55, was for decades a protean figure in pop culture. A Grammy-winning hip hop artist and entrepreneur with a flair for finding and launching big talents, he presided over a business empire that ranged from fashion to reality TV.\nProsecutors claimed he used his fame, wealth and violence to force and manipulate two now-ex-girlfriends into days-long, drugged-up sexual performances he called \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights.\u201d\nHis lawyers argued that the government tried to criminalize consensual, if unconventional, sexual tastes that played out in complicated relationships. The defense acknowledged that Combs had violent outbursts but said nothing he did came amounted to the crimes with which he was charged.\nSince the verdict, his lawyers have repeatedly renewed their efforts to get him out on bail until his sentencing, set for October. They have argued that the acquittals undercut the rationale for holding him, and they have pointed to other people who were released before sentencing on similar convictions.\nDefense lawyer Marc Agnifilo suggested in a court filing that Combs was the United States\u2019 \u201conly person in jail for hiring adult male escorts for him and his girlfriend.\u201d\nThe defense\u2019s most recent proposal included the $50 million bond, plus travel restrictions, and expressed openness to adding on house arrest at his Miami home, electronic monitoring, private security guards and other requirements.\nProsecutors opposed releasing Combs. They wrote that his \u201cextensive history of violence \u2014 and his continued attempt to minimize his recent violent conduct \u2014 demonstrates his dangerousness and that he is not amendable to supervision.\u201d"
