  "title": "Safe zones to be expanded around LAUSD schools; agents detain student at gunpoint near campus",
  "description": "Amid immigration enforcement, city and school officials will set up \"safe zones\" monitored by LAPD and community volunteers to protect undocumented families when school resumes at LAUSD.",
  "content": "In this file photo from 2023, Los Angeles schools Supt. Alberto Carvalho (at podium) speaks at news conference with L.A. Mayor Karen Bass. Bass, Carvalho and other local officials gathered Monday at Roybal Learning Center, just west of downtown L.A., to express their support for immigrant families.\n\nLos Angeles Unified school police, staff and community volunteers will form protective perimeters around at least 100 schools when classes begin on Thursday to help ensure the safe passage of children \u2014 an announcement that came on a day that immigration agents reportedly handcuffed, detained and drew their guns on a student outside Arleta High School in a case of mistaken identity, officials said.\n\nThe 15-year-old boy, a student with disabilities, was visiting Arleta High School with family members when federal agents detained him, L.A. Unified officials said. Family members intervened and, after a few tense moments, the agents released the boy. The school\u2019s principal also came out to assess the situation. Agents left behind some bullets on the sidewalk, apparently by mistake, which were collected by school police.\n\n\u201cSuch actions \u2014 violently detaining a child just outside a public school \u2014 are absolutely reprehensible and should have no place in our country,\u201d school board member Kelly Gonez, who represents Arleta High, said in a social media post.\n\nA spokesperson from the Department of Homeland Security could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nAcross Los Angeles Unified, parents, teachers and staff have expressed deep fears about school safety amid immigration raids. Citywide, leaders are concerned that children whose parents are living in the country without legal status will be kept home as families grapple with the climate of fear.\n\nL.A. schools Supt. Alberto Carvalho spoke Monday at a news conference near district headquarters, saying that the district is doubling down on efforts to protect students and families by creating and expanding \u201csafe zones\u201d around campuses, before and after school, with the help of community workers, school police and local police departments.\n\nBass was not specific about what role the Los Angeles Police Department would play.\n\n\u201cThe school police and the Los Angeles Police Department have a strong working relationship and will continue to share information as appropriate as needed,\u201d Bass said. \u201cBut neither police departments assist with immigration enforcement, and have not for many, many years. There will be adults in the community who will serve as eyes and ears on the street.\u201d\n\nAt least two mayors from smaller cities pledged direct police assistance in patrolling areas around schools.\n\nAlthough local police are not legally allowed to stop or interfere with federal law enforcement actions, authorities will alert parents along walking routes if agents are in the area. Also, they will trigger a communication chain to alert all nearby campuses of raids so that schools can take lockdown actions as necessary.\n\nThe public commitment was intended to reassure families that school will be a safe place and that officials also will do what they can to protect families on their way to and from campuses.\n\nIn a string of recent appearances, Carvalho has reviewed a list of measures taken by the nation\u2019s second-largest school system.\n\nThese included home visits and calls in recent weeks to more than 10,000 families considered at risk of immigration enforcement or at risk of not coming to schools. The school system also is distributing family preparedness packets, \u201call the information in one single form, in a multitude of languages,\u201d said Carvalho, with the goal of \u201cexplaining the rights of our children and their parents, but also providing easy access to the resources that we have available to all of them.\u201d\n\nThe district also has created a \u201ccompassion fund\u201d to provide general help for families, including legal assistance.\n\nIn addition to students from immigrant families, the school system also more than 350 employees who are working legally but who could have their legal status revoked.\n\n\u201cThey continue to be the valiant, productive workers they are with us,\u201d Carvalho said last week.\n\nThe district is working to re-route buses to make transportation more accessible to families. For the most part, the busing system is used by students with disabilities \u2014 for whom transportation is legally required \u2014 and students attending magnet programs at campuses far from where they live.\n\nBut this could change when the parameter for riding a bus is safety. In this light, neighborhood proximity to bus stops matters a lot, because families can be exposed to immigration enforcement while traveling to and from a stop.\n\nThe buses themselves will be a considered an extension of the campus environment and federal agents will not be permitted to board them.\n\nThe Monday news conference took place at Roybal Learning Center, just west of downtown, which also is the headquarters of the L.A. Unified School Police Department, which is expected to have a role in monitoring immigration enforcement and potentially confronting it.\n\nOthers in attendance included members of the L.A. Board of Education as well as South Gate Mayor Maria Davila. West Hollywood Mayor Chelsea Lee Byers and City of Bell Mayor Mayor Ali Saleh.\n\nLos Angeles Unified covers an area totaling 710 square miles, which, along with the City of Los Angeles, includes all or portions of 25 cities and some unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County. Approximately 4.8 million people live within school-district boundaries.",

      "text": "- Share via\nCall forth the mourners from far and wide.\nAnd remind them to bring their chainsaws.\nWe gather to prepare ourselves to bid a frond farewell to Los Angeles\u2019 palm trees.\nLos Angeles knows how to weather a crisis \u2014 or two or three. Angelenos are tapping into that resilience, striving to build a city for everyone.\nDon\u2019t freak out. This isn\u2019t an alert about any wholesale dying of palms. Not all of them, anyway, and not right away. But Ecclesiastes got it right about everything having a season, \u201ca time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted.\u201d\nThe season \u2014 the long, long winning season \u2014 for so many of our palm trees is running its course. Our exotic, come-hither, haphazard forest is being slowly timed out.\nWe stand at an inflection point for L.A., after the fires, in the grip of climate change, recalibrating our future right down to the roots. Literally to the roots. Uncounted thousands of trees burned in the fires. Thousands more are getting thinned out by disease and drought and age. How do we replace our geriatric urban forest with more and better trees?\nOriginal L.A. was not the forest primeval. It was a landscape of scrubby shrubs and chaparral and grasses. What native trees there were grew alongside water, which flowed abundantly, if seasonally, until we took over the land and dried up the waterways.\nPalm trees came to town with the missionaries, for religious ceremonies, and then, decades later, with the great PR sales pitch of Southern California being the \u201cAmerican Mediterranean,\u201d which demanded the right set dressing \u2014 palm trees.\nA veteran of the advertising business recalls a trick New Yorkers used to employ to get a trip to Los Angeles.\nThe City Beautiful movement of the 1910s and1920s and the glories of the 1932 Olympics stuck thousands of trees of all kinds into the ground to adorn public L.A. All they had to do was look good; to fret over drought or heat was treason.\nAngelenos\u2019 faith that pretty much anything could grow here was usually right. The unlikeliest tree cuttings from the world over were carried here, adapted and came to elbow out the locals.\nThus, Los Angeles became a tree zoo.\nNow it\u2019s time to make it a tree ark, and not every species should make it aboard.\nClimate change changes cities. We can no longer afford freeloader trees, however glamorous. Palms suck down water like camels, but give back barely enough leafiness to shade a Hula-Hoop. Falling fronds can deliver a mean whack, and during fires, palms light up like a flare.\nThe nonprofit TreePeople has been trying to prep us for this for years.\nBryan Vejar is a master arborist who directs community forestry for TreePeople, and, yes, in fact, he does have a few thoughts on the topic, and this is the moment we need to hear them, so take it away, Mr. Vejar:\n\u201cTrees are not some cosmetic thing, some ornament. They\u2019re also critical infrastructure, like traffic signs and traffic lights. They have tremendous value for the health and safety of the community.\u201d\n\u201cWe should be planting trees that serve a greater range of ecological benefits. There\u2019s not just one clear answer. The trees we plant now have to be climate-adaptive for weather forecasts for 50 and 60 years.\u201d\n\u201cNative trees also support local wildlife, specifically ones endemic to our geographical biome. Pollinators, nesting birds, migratory birds and other species rely on them.\u201d\nCities are being urged to expand their urban tree canopy to mitigate the effects of climate change, but some are replacing mature shady trees with palms.\n\u201cNot a lot of trees check every box. You want trees that are very durable and very resilient, that can endure many different soil types in any given community.\u201d\nAll right, then. What\u2019s in, and what\u2019s out once we cart away old trees and/or plant new ones?\nOut: most palms. And don\u2019t replace them with something like crape myrtle, which is pretty but doesn\u2019t offer much shade for the space it takes up.\nMost eucalyptus, out. They\u2019re invasive below ground and tiki torches above.\nSweet gums, out; They\u2019re also invasive, triggering allergies, and dropping nasty, spiky balls like alien spoor. (Some trees appear on a city-approved list, but TreePeople gives them a \u201cbranches-down.\u201d)\nI share Vejar\u2019s loathing for the relentless \u201ctree of heaven,\u201d the deciduous plant that is sometimes called a stinking sumac. You see it everywhere; it not only crowds out natives, it also poisons the soil to kill off the competition and ruins biodiversity. Its leaves can also kill your dog. If you see one in your garden, kill it before it kills us.\nVejar\u2019s \u201cins\u201d include native oaks and some sycamores, black walnut trees, desert willows, drought-tolerant African sumac and Chinese pistache.\nFicus trees scrub away air pollution and cast vast shade, something vital when an urban forest can lower temperatures by 10 or 20 degrees. Ideal, right? Yet cities planted them unwisely alongside sidewalks, which their mature roots now crack and split.\n\u201cThe thing that makes it a workhorse for urban forests,\u201d says Vejar, \u201cis also what makes cities have to pay out millions in lawsuits from people tripping, ADA violations and such.\u201d\nSo, suppose the palms do take their last bow? Which understudy is ready to step onstage as our new arboreal star? Oaks and sycamores are too generic. Orange trees? Memento mori.\nBut the jacaranda \u2014 now there\u2019s beauty. Fast-growing, generous with shade, drought-tolerant and soil-forgiving. Bees and butterflies love them. And did I mention beautiful? That ultraviolet haze shimmering around a blossoming jacaranda delivers a moment of transcendent enchantment.\nSo what if the fallen petals are sticky? It\u2019s a small toll paid to glory. Like a wad of gum dropped on the Hollywood Walk of Fame."

      "text": "\u2018Uncharted territory\u2019: Newsom and UC go to battle against Trump\u2019s UCLA sanctions\n- Share via\n- Fearful of Trump actions, UCLA carefully avoided clashes with the president for months.\n- Conflict has come to a head after the Trump administration suspended $584 million in grants and has demanded a $1-billion settlement.\n- Newsom says the state will sue. UC Board of Regents will hold an emergency meeting Monday.\nTwo weeks ago, UCLA was optimistic.\nFor months, it had successfully avoided clashes with President Trump as university leaders declined to publicly criticize him by name over his battle to remake American higher education, first raging against several Ivy League schools.\nThe morning of July 29, UCLA announced it had settled a federal lawsuit with students who accused it of discrimination, paying more than $2 million to Jewish civil rights groups and millions more in legal fees. University leaders hailed the action as \u201creal progress\u201d to combat antisemitism. Privately, they pointed the Trump administration to the agreement, eager to convince federal officials they had made good with Jewish communities.\nThe high lasted just a few hours \u2014 and touched off an extraordinary 14 days of rapid-fire accusations, investigative findings and a massive federal freeze of UCLA\u2019s research funding. It culminated Friday afternoon when Gov. Gavin Newsom unleashed furious comments in response to a federal demand that UC pay a $1-billion fine over a host of allegations against UCLA: antisemitism on campus, illegal use of race in admissions and policies that allow transgender athletes to compete according to their gender identity.\n\u201cHe has threatened us through extortion with a billion-dollar fine, unless we do his bidding,\u201d Newsom said, adding that California would sue. \u201cWe will not be complicit in this kind of attack on academic freedom on this extraordinary public institution.\u201d\nSpokespeople for the Justice Department did not respond Sunday to a question about Newsom\u2019s comments and legal threat.\nThe escalating events lead up to decisive moments this week, starting with an emergency meeting of the UC Board of Regents on Monday afternoon. On Tuesday, a federal court hearing will unfold in a preexisting case that could result in some \u2014 but not all \u2014 UC grants being restored.\nThe Trump administration has proposed the University of California pay more than $1 billion to settle antisemitism charges and restore frozen grant funding at UCLA. Newsom says the state will sue.\nThe developments bring the fight over America\u2019s higher education institutions \u2014 which has roiled elite private East Coast universities for months \u2014 to the nation\u2019s most powerful and lauded public university system.\n\u201cWe are in uncharted territory,\u201d said Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, which represents more than 1,700 colleges and universities. \u201cWe have seen the government come after Columbia, Brown, Harvard and others. But this, now, is a test. Will UCLA be the defender of public universities? Will it strike a deal? And what role will money \u2014 taxpayer money \u2014 play?\u201d\nCalifornia is facing off against a president who has been relentless in his aims to rein in what he calls \u201cMarxist\u201d universities that in his view are bastions of liberalism that have done too little to protect Jewish students, have been too soft on pro-Palestinian protests, and rely too heavily on international student dollars.\nHis administration has accused a host of elite colleges nationwide \u2014 Harvard, Columbia, Brown, Stanford and three UC campuses \u2014 of illegally considering race in admissions and programming to the detriment of white and Asian American students. In response to pro-Palestinian protests, Trump has said colleges have enabled \u201cjihadists,\u201d saying demonstrators are \u201cpro-Hamas\u201d terrorists.\n\u201cUCLA is not a random selection,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThe administration has had issues with California, with the governor, for some time. This is part of a larger battle between the administration and the state of California.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s at stake\nSince July 30, when UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk began receiving notices from the federal government announcing grant suspensions \u2014 totaling nearly half a billion dollars \u2014 UCLA leaders have scrambled to assess the effect on what they describe as life-saving, groundbreaking research. Deans and departments have been told to be prepared for layoffs if the cuts last.\nScience and medical professors, whose research labs would not exist without federal funding, have solicited private donations. Doctoral and postdoctoral students, whose tuition and living expenses are often funded by grants in exchange for lab work, are rushing to speed up their graduation plans before stipends become depleted.\nThe Trump administration has suspended $584 million in grants at UCLA over what the U.S. Department of Justice has described as the school\u2019s \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 to Jewish students\u2019 civil rights.\n\u201cThe federal government claims antisemitism and bias as the reasons. This far-reaching penalty of defunding life-saving research does nothing to address any alleged discrimination,\u201d Frenk said about the messages from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health and Department of Energy.\nUC as a system and UCLA in particular have been under multiple federal investigations for months:\n- Alleged employment discrimination against Jewish employees and job applicants.\n- Civil rights complaints from Israeli and Jewish students.\n- The alleged consideration of race in admissions practices.\n- UCLA is also on a shortlist of 10 campuses, including UC Berkeley and USC \u2014 that a federal task force on combating antisemitism singled out in February.\nThe ongoing investigations were launched by the Education, Justice, and Health and Human Services departments.\nUCLA leaders thought they were being cooperative by sharing internal records over the months with government lawyers and making progress in quiet negotiations over the accusations, senior UC officials said.\nThey hoped the government took notice of efforts that could appease the president: a new campus initiative to combat antisemitism, the banning of Students for Justice in Palestine groups, a UC-wide ban on student government boycotts of Israel, quick shutdowns of pro-Palestinian campus protests, and strict discipline of pro-Palestinian students accused of time, place and manner violations during demonstrations.\nBut the federal government\u2019s stance is now clear: It believes UCLA is guilty of all allegations.\nThe NSF letter said that UCLA \u201cengages in racism, in the form of illegal affirmative action, UCLA fails to promote a research environment free of antisemitism and bias; UCLA discriminates against and endangers women by allowing men in women\u2019s sports and private women-only spaces.\u201d\nWhat Trump wants\nFederal lawyers want UC to pay the billion-dollar fine against UCLA in installments and contribute $172 million to a fund for Jewish students and other individuals affected by alleged civil rights violations.\nThe settlement demands include ending scholarships that focus on race or ethnicity, forcing UCLA to share more admissions data than it already publicly releases with the government and changes to campus protest rules such as a ban on overnight encampments.\nIn addition to the sticker-shock fine, some requests have puzzled UCLA leaders \u2014 as the UC system has already significantly overhauled many practices outlined by the federal government.\nIt has ended the use of \u201cdiversity statements\u201d in hiring. Last fall, UCLA declared a \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy for encampments. The government wants transgender women off women\u2019s sports teams. But as a member of the National Collegiate Athletics Assn., the university is already required to follow new association rules that bar transgender players from women\u2019s teams.\n\u201cIt feels like a cut-and-paste job,\u201d said a senior UC official about Trump\u2019s proposal. The official was not authorized to speak publicly about negotiations. \u201cIt\u2019s like they took a parts of letters to the Ivy Leagues, cobbled them together and added the words \u2018UCLA.\u2019 \u201d\nWhat comes next\nThe 24-member UC Board of Regents, which must approve of any settlement or payout to the federal government and would be involved in a suit, has called an emergency, closed-door meeting Monday afternoon. It\u2019s unclear whether Newsom, who is an ex-officio member of the board, will attend.\nAnother pivotal moment comes Tuesday in San Francisco\u2019s federal district court. There, Judge Rita F. Lin has ordered the Justice Department to explain why the UCLA cuts are not a violation of a June order in which she blocked certain science grant terminations for all of UC.\nThe case, filed by UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco researchers, is being argued by Erwin Chemerinsky, UC Berkeley law school dean and constitutional expert. If the judge rules in UC\u2019s favor, it could apply to NSF cuts that account for about half of those in limbo at UCLA.\nIn an interview, Chemerinsky said actions against UCLA were \u201cclearly illegal\u201d because \u201cthe president lacks constitutional authority to refuse to spend money appropriated by Congress.\u201d\nHe outlined what would likely be California\u2019s argument in a suit: The government\u2019s actions violate the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which restricts the president\u2019s ability to halt spending that Congress has authorized.\n\u201cThe cutoff of funds has been without the due process required by federal laws and the Constitution,\u201d Chemerinsky said. \u201cAgencies cutting off funds, like NIH and NSF, are violating the Administrative Procedures Act in that the actions are \u2018arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.\u2019 Many of the cutoffs of funds violate the 1st Amendment for being based on viewpoint.\u201d\nNegotiations still possible\nBut California faces a risk if it files a suit against the administration\u2019s orders.\nWhen Harvard pushed back against billions in similar cuts earlier this year, the Trump administration hit the university with additional costly funding clawbacks and a termination of its ability to host foreign students, an issue it further sued over.\nCarl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said time \u2014 and politics \u2014 is not on UCLA\u2019s side.\n\u201cAt some point you have to be ready for fall classes and international students coming in and the campus trying to deal with the uncertainty and losing all your grants,\u201d said Tobias. Litigation can take months, if not years, he said. California \u201cmight do well in the district courts and then in the 9th Circuit, but I don\u2019t know what would happen in the Supreme Court.\u201d\nAfter Newsom threatened a suit, UC Regents Chair Janet Reilly told The Times that negotiation is still on the table \u2014 but not on the current \u201cunacceptable\u201d terms.\n\u201cThe university remains willing to engage in a constructive and good-faith dialogue with the federal government but the University of California will always stand firm in protecting the integrity and values of our institution,\u201d Reilly said.\nMark Yudof, a former UC president who led the system from 2008 to 2013, believed negotiations were still likely.\n\u201cWhile litigation is certainly a possibility, my sense is that both sides will first try negotiating a settlement,\u201d Yudof said.

      "text": "The next \u2018Big One\u2019 on the San Andreas fault might not be the earthquake we expect, researchers say\n- Share via\n- A new report studied a massive earthquake that ruptured in the southeast Asian country of Myanmar on March 28 \u2014 on a fault known for being eerily similar to California\u2019s notorious San Andreas fault.\n- While the recent quake could hold vital clues for California\u2019s next \u201cBig One,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author notes that, \u201cEarthquakes never come back exactly the same way.\u201d\nWhat could the next mega-earthquake on California\u2019s notorious San Andreas fault look like?\nWould it be a repeat of 1857, when an earthquake estimated at magnitude 7.7 to 7.9 ruptured the fault from Monterey County all the way through Los Angeles County? Would it be more akin to the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which began just offshore of the city and ruptured in two directions, toward Humboldt County and Santa Cruz County?\nDon\u2019t bet on an identical sequel.\nThat\u2019s the implication of a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The report, coauthored by scientists at Caltech in Pasadena, studied a massive earthquake that ruptured in the southeast Asian country of Myanmar on March 28 \u2014 on a fault known for being eerily similar to the San Andreas.\nThe earthquake ended up rupturing a much longer section of the fault than scientists expected, given the seismology of the region.\nThe implications of this study are that \u201cearthquakes never come back exactly the same way,\u201d Solene L. Antoine, a postdoctoral fellow at Caltech and the study\u2019s lead author, said in an interview.\n\u201cIt came as a surprise that you could get such a long rupture,\u201d said Jean-Philippe Avouac, a coauthor of the study and a professor of geology and mechanical and civil engineering at Caltech.\nMarch\u2019s Mandalay earthquake devastated Myanmar, killing at least 3,791 people and an additional 63 people in Thailand. High-rise buildings were damaged as far away as Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam and homes were damaged in the Ruili area of China. Damage was estimated at $1.9 billion, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\nIt was the most powerful earthquake in Myanmar in at least 79 years.\nThe magnitude 7.7 earthquake ruptured an astonishing 317 miles of the Sagaing fault, a finding based on Antoine\u2019s analysis of satellite data showing earth movement after the quake. That\u2019s the longest seismic rupture ever documented on a continent.\nBy comparison, California\u2019s 1906 earthquake ruptured 296 miles of the San Andreas fault; and the 1857 earthquake, 225 miles. Longer seismic ruptures have been found only on subduction megathrusts deep underneath the ocean.\nWhat\u2019s clear from the study is that while California\u2019s next \u201cBig One\u201d may share some characteristics of previously documented devastating quakes, it\u2019s unlikely to be an exact replay. As the recent experience in Myanmar shows, even well-documented faults can behave in surprising ways.\nThe next step is to develop a model simulating earthquakes over many millennia for the San Andreas fault, which the authors plan to do in the future. But the San Andreas fault \u201cis far more complex,\u201d Avouac said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to come soon, because it\u2019s quite a heavy calculation.\u201d\nStill, such simulations would provide a model of \u201call possible scenarios so that we have a better view of the range of possible ruptures that could happen.\u201d\nFor instance, maybe the San Andreas fault will rupture in smaller, separate earthquakes, Avouac said.\nOr it could be a much larger earthquake \u2014 rupturing the fault not just from Monterey to Los Angeles counties, but perhaps all the way into San Bernardino, Riverside and Imperial counties, which would possibly exceed magnitude 8. Such a quake would be the largest simultaneous disaster in modern California history, with huge swaths of the state wracked by powerful seismic shaking all at once.\nBy comparison, the 1994 Northridge earthquake\u2019s footprint was relatively constrained, severely affecting only a portion of Los Angeles County, especially the San Fernando Valley \u2014 related to its relatively smaller magnitude of 6.7.\nBut while modeling previous activity on the San Andreas fault will provide a glimpse into the wide range of possible outcomes, it will not pinpoint precisely when the next great quake will strike.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just expect the exact same thing to happen,\u201d Antoine said. \u201cIt is a matter of just showing what scenarios are possible, the diversity of scenarios and seeing what are the consequences of each of those scenarios.\u201d\nSometimes, Avouac said, \u201cit\u2019s quiet for a long time, nothing happens ... stress is building up, the fault is locked for a long time, nothing happens, and then, boom, you have a large earthquake.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then you have other periods during which you have a lot of [seismic] activity, but these earthquakes are all smaller,\u201d Avouac said.\nBut \u201csmaller\u201d earthquakes, in the minds of researchers, are still big to the layperson. In the study\u2019s simulations, there are periods where earthquakes around magnitude 7.7 are common. In other periods, earthquakes max out at magnitude 7.5 or so, but are more frequent.\nThe entire length of the Sagaing fault \u2014 including areas that didn\u2019t rupture in the March earthquake \u2014 is 750 miles, north to south, from the Himalayas to the Andaman Sea, and helps accommodate the northward push of the Indian tectonic plate.\nThe fact that 317 miles of the Sagaing fault ruptured in March was surprising to scientists. Only about 170 miles had been quiet seismically for more than a century, having last ruptured in 1839.\nScientists call these \u201cseismic gaps\u201d \u2014 particular areas of a fault that haven\u2019t recently ruptured.\nGenerally, scientists would\u2019ve expected only this long-dormant 170-mile piece of the Sagaing fault to rupture, Avouac said, but not more recently ruptured sections. That includes a 100-mile stretch that ruptured in large earthquakes in 1929 and 1930, and a 50-mile stretch that went off in a pair of quakes in 1946 and 1956.\nInstead, even those fault segments ruptured in the big March earthquake.\nSo what gives?\nA possible explanation is the Sagaing fault\u2019s extraordinary smoothness. \u201cAnd people have observed that when the fault is very smooth, the rupture ... tends to propagate at a velocity\u201d so fast that it results in an \u201cextremely elongated rupture,\u201d Avouac said.\nThe study also published the results of a computer model simulation looking at how earthquakes might rupture along sections of the entire 750-mile long Sagaing fault. The code, developed by study coauthor Kyungjae Im of Caltech, suggests that over a hypothetical 1,400-year period, there would be no repeatable patterns.\nIn other words, earthquakes didn\u2019t seem to re-occur like clockwork, rupturing the same stretch of fault in a repeatable, predictable pattern.\n\u201cThere is complexity here. And this is because each time you have an earthquake, it redistributes the stress on the fault, which is going to influence the next earthquake,\u201d Avouac said. \u201cThere\u2019s a self-induced complexity in the process, and that leads to a bit of randomness.\u201d\nThere is one certainty, which is bound to disappoint anyone who shares the hope that a \u201cBig One\u201d simply won\u2019t ever strike California again.\n\u201cThere will be an earthquake at some point,\u201d Antoine said. \u201cIf there is stress building up on the fault, the fault won\u2019t hold forever.\u201d\nFurther research and observations are essential to refine models of future possible earthquakes, including from the Sentinel satellites, which are operated by the European Space Agency, the authors said.\nThe other coauthors of the study are Rajani Shrestha and Chris Milliner of Caltech; Chris Rollins of Earth Sciences New Zealand; Kang Wang of the Washington-based EarthScope Consortium; and Kejie Chen of the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China."
