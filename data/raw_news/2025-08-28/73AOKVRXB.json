  "description": "",
  "content": "Stocks looked set to open higher on Thursday, but contracts tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 were struggling for direction as a tepid forecast from chip maker Nvidia fueled fears that demand for AI may have plateaued.\n\nXTB said the fall in Nvidia's stock price Wednesday aftermarket and Thursday premarket indicated that investors were disappointed on the China front.\n\nThe tech giant didn't sell any H20 chips to China-based customers in the fiscal second quarter, even though the Trump administration lifted export restrictions last month.\n\n\"The longer it takes to generate sales in China, the more likely it is that Chinese consumers will turn to domestic chip makers who could eventually rival Nvidia's chips for their advanced capabilities.\"\n\nEarnings at Agilent Technologies were in line with analysts' estimates as revenue rose. Shares fell 2.3%.\n\nCooper Cos. lowered its full-year sales outlook. Shares fell 15% despite posting earnings that beat analysts' expectations.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings dropped 3.5% after reporting earnings better than analysts' estimates and topping forecasts.\n\nHP Inc. was down 2.1%.\n\nNutanix fell 4.5%. The company's earnings were better than Wall Street expectations.\n\nUrban Outfitters posted earnings that beat Wall Street forecasts as revenue rose 11. However, the company warned that tariffs would lower future margins and could lead to price increases. The stock fell 5.1%.\n\nVeeva Systems was down 3.7% after better-than-expected adjusted earnings.\n\nGDP for for 2Q, second estimate; Weekly Jobless Claims; Pending Home Sales for July; Canada Current Account for 2Q; Earnings from Toronto-Dominion Bank, Dell Technologies, Marvell Technology, Autodesk, Affirm Holdings, Dollar General, Ulta Beauty, Dick's Sporting Goods, Best Buy, and Gap.\n\n-First Google, Now Microsoft: Tech Staff Are in Revolt Over Gaza\n\n-The U.K. Tried to Clamp Down on Migration-and Wound Up With an Unprecedented Wave\n\nThe dollar fell as concerns about the Fed's independence persist following Trump's move to dismiss Fed Governor Lisa Cook.\n\nThese worries have prompted investors to price in faster rate cuts and higher inflation, Deutsche Bank said.\n\nING said that any boost to the currency from U.S. economic data Thursday would only be brief as the Fed's Waller is due to speak.\n\nWaller, a Trump appointee, could strengthen his calls for interest-rate cuts after the July nonfarm payrolls report validated his concerns over the weakening labor market.\n\nThe euro faced further pressure from French political concerns but declines were likely to be limited in the near term, ING said.\n\n\"We think the dollar trend will dominate here, the euro should find support under $1.1600 into September.\"\n\nSterling looks set to weaken against the euro given the structural factors weighing on the U.K.'s real economy, Commerzbank said.\n\nIt expects the euro to rise to 0.8700 pounds by June 2026.\n\nTreasury yields were marginally lower ahead of key indicators Thursday and Friday.\n\nSecond-estimate GDP data for the second quarter as well as weekly jobless claims are due on Thursday and PCE inflation data--the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation--will be released Friday\n\nBond markets were in focus as borrowing costs rise on both sides of the Atlantic, AJ Bell said.\n\nCentral bank independence is a keystone in anchoring long-term inflation expectations, and that is being put under threat by Trump.\n\n\"Trump wants the economic sugar rush from lower interest rates, but his actions may well serve to push up long-term borrowing costs and weaken the dollar.\"\n\nThat's a problem for an administration that needs the bond market to feed the budget deficit and also benefits from lower borrowing costs as a result of the dollar being the world's reserve currency, it said.\n\nCrude futures eased, with investors shifting focus from Russian supply risks to the prospect of a global supply glut as summer comes to an end.\n\nBenchmarks settled more than 1% higher in the previous session after the EIA reported a larger-than-expected draw in U.S. crude stockpiles, even though the pace of declines slowed compared with the previous reporting week.\n\n\"Broader concerns remain that OPEC+'s unwinding of supply cuts, combined with rising output from non-member producers, [which] could tip the market into surplus,\" MUFG said.\n\nAlthough Brent is still trading at a premium for near-term delivery--suggesting tight supplies--that premium has narrowed, pointing to softer demand expectations ahead, it added.\n\nGold futures held firm at higher prices, finding support from investor unease over Fed developments and potential inflation risks, MUFG said.\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has increased its stake in trading house Mitsubishi Corp., taking it to more than 10%, the Japanese company said.\n\nMitsubishi Corp. said Thursday that National Indemnity, a wholly owned unit of Berkshire Hathaway, acquired additional shares of the company to raise its voting rights to 10.2% from 9.7%.\n\nHP's third-quarter sales got a boost from growing demand for its artificial intelligence-enabled personal computers, a trend its chief executive expects to continue next year.\n\nThe computer and printer maker's AI PC sales continued to rise at a double-digit rate quarter to quarter, CEO Enrique Lores said, which helped the company post better-than-expected revenue.\n\nPernod Ricard Expects Sales to Improve Amid Continued Challenges in U.S., China\n\nFrench distiller Pernod Ricard expects to see improving sales trends in the second half of fiscal 2026 following what it forecasts to be a soft first quarter on continued weak consumer demand in China and further inventory destocking in the U.S.\n\nThe maker of Absolut vodka and Jameson whiskey on Thursday confirmed that the period ahead would be a transition year, starting with a decline in sales in the June to September period.\n\nNvidia's \"new normal\" doesn't look that bad. But in a market awash in waves of AI hype, even the industry's biggest ship can be jostled.\n\nThe company's fiscal second-quarter report marked another period of record revenue and operating profit, with sales surging 56% from a year earlier in the period ended in July. That is actually the slowest growth rate that Nvidia has reported in more than two years, but it still vastly exceeds what other megacap tech companies are currently managing. And that is with sales of AI chips to China effectively shut off owing to national-security concerns.\n\nWhy the Market Doesn't Care Much About Trump Firing the Fed's Cook\n\nWhy don't the markets care more about President Trump's unprecedented attempt to fire a Federal Reserve governor? The yield on the 30-year Treasury initially rose a mere 0.05 percentage points after the president's most serious assault yet on the independence of the central bank, before paring back the rise. Investors just aren't that bothered.\n\nLots of smart commentators, including my colleague Greg Ip, think markets should be more concerned. Here are five good reasons why they shouldn't be-and one reason why, perhaps, they should.\n\nRussia launched its deadliest barrage against Kyiv since President Trump held talks in Alaska with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president who increasingly appears to be defying White House threats of sanctions and pressing on with his war on Ukraine.\n\nRussia's aerial strikes killed at least 14 people in the Ukrainian capital early Thursday, Ukrainian officials said, and involved 629 missiles and attack drones. The Ukrainian Air Force said it shot down 589 of them.\n\nAmtrak's New Acela Trains Are Here. They're Moving Slower Than the Old Ones.\n\nAmtrak is launching a new high-speed Acela train, but there is one wrinkle: It isn't actually faster, yet.\n\nFive next-generation Acela trains begin service Thursday as part of a $2.45 billion project to improve service along the key Washington-to-Boston corridor. But two of them running from Washington to Boston will actually travel more slowly than their predecessors do on the same route Thursday, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Amtrak's schedule. These new trains are scheduled to take at least seven hours and five minutes to complete the trip, compared with the average time of six hours and 56 minutes on the older Acela trains.\n\nKim and Putin to Join Xi in Show of Unity at Beijing Military Parade\n\nBEIJING-North Korean leader Kim Jong Un plans to join Russia's Vladimir Putin at China's grand military parade in Beijing next week, in a show of unity and defiance of the West.\n\nThe parade on Wednesday will be hosted by Chinese leader Xi Jinping and is set to be the trio's first event together, providing powerful optics as Beijing asserts itself as a leader of countries seeking to upend the U.S.-led international order.\n\nTulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, surprised Central Intelligence Agency officials last week when she included an undercover senior CIA officer on a roster of 37 current and former officials she stripped of security clearances.",

  "summary": "The Dow Futures were set to open higher on Thursday, but contracts tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 were struggling for direction due to a tepid forecast from chip maker Nvidia, raising concerns that demand for AI may have peaked. The fall in Nvidia's stock price indicated investors were disappointed with its lack of sales to China-based customers in Q2, despite the lifting of export restrictions. Other tech companies including Agilent Technologies and CrowdStrike Holdings also saw drops in their shares. The dollar fell amid concerns about the Fed's independence following President Trump's decision to dismiss Fed Governor Lisa Cook. The euro faced further pressure from French political concerns, but is expected to be limited in the near future. Key data including GDP data, jobless claims, pending home sales, pending Home Sales, and PCE inflation data are due to be released Friday.",

  "argos_summary": "Stocks opened higher but the Nasdaq 100 struggled after Nvidia\u2019s tepid Q2 earnings, which saw slower growth and no sales to China, raising concerns that AI demand may be plateauing. Several tech and consumer companies reported earnings that beat or matched expectations, yet some shares fell due to outlook cuts or tariff worries. Macro data and Fed policy dominated market sentiment, with investors pricing in faster rate cuts amid concerns over the Fed\u2019s independence and Trump\u2019s attempt to fire a governor. Commodity prices moved modestly, with oil easing on supply\u2011glut fears and gold holding steady amid inflation worries. Corporate news included Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s increased stake in Mitsubishi, HP\u2019s AI\u2011PC sales growth, and Pernod Ricard\u2019s outlook for improved sales in the second half of fiscal 2026.",
