  "content": "An iconic Australian model has shared an adorable throwback photo from her childhood, sending her fans into meltdown.\n\nThe brunette beauty, 35, is preparing to welcome her first child, a baby girl, and was feeling particularly nostalgic on Thursday as she posted a photo of herself wearing an adorable black-and-red party dress for a Christmas happy snap.\n\nIn her caption she wrote: 'There will be another little girl wearing this dress in a few years. Can\u2019t believe my mum kept my little party dress for over 30 years, it was meant to be,' she wrote.\n\nThe glamazon's career would launch just a few years after the photo was taken, as at age 13 she would win the Girlfriend Covergirl modelling competition and shoot to fame.\n\nAt age 19, she became the second Indigenous model to appear on the cover of Vogue Australia, and has since appeared in campaigns for leading brands including David Jones and Seafolly.\n\nThe former Dancing With The Stars contestant, whose mother is Aboriginal and father is German-English, also uses her platform to champion diversity, body positivity, and greater Indigenous representation in fashion.\n\nSo, have you guessed who she is yet?\n\nThe girl in the photo is none other than Samantha Harris!\n\nThe 6ft model, who hails from Tweed Heads, announced in May she is expecting her first child with husband of eleven years Luke Hunt.\n\nThat model made headlines in 2014 when she famously stuck by her beau's side after he was sentenced to four years in prison.\n\nLuke served two years behind bars for the death of a grandfather following a fatal car crash in 2012.\n\nSam secretly married Luke in 2014, two months before he began serving his prison sentence for his involvement in the crash that caused the death of 78-year-old grandfather Kenneth Lay.\n\nNews that the couple had married wasn't revealed until April 2016, after her husband had finished serving his prison term.",
