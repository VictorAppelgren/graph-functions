  "title": "Where To Eat And Drink In Northeast Portland Right Now",
  "description": "From old-school brunch joints to wood-fired pizza, craft cocktails and farm-to-table dinners, here's the best food and drink in Northeast Portland right now.",
  "content": "Northeast Portland has long been one of the city\u2019s most eclectic quadrants\u2014rooted in historic neighborhoods, shaped by waves of cultural change and now brimming with some of PDX\u2019s most exciting food and drink.\n\nOnce known for its strong working-class and jazz-era roots, the area has evolved into a vibrant mix of old-school institutions and cutting-edge culinary talent. Tree-lined streets, restored Craftsman homes and mural-covered walls set the stage for a dining scene where creative chefs, passionate bakers and inventive bartenders make NE Portland distinctly its own.\n\nIn this corner of the city, you\u2019ll find old-school comfort food joints, innovative chef-driven kitchens and cocktail bars with just the right mix of quirk and polish. Whether you\u2019re starting your morning with a plate-sweeping breakfast, lingering over a seasonal dinner or sipping something strong late into the night, these spots prove you don\u2019t have to leave NE Portland to eat (and drink) exceptionally well.\n\nA Portland brunch classic, Gravy PDX is famous for its namesake dish: silky, peppery sausage or veggie gravy poured over biscuits the size of your face. Expect generous portions, a cozy diner feel, a delightful challah french toast and a menu that could easily carry you into lunchtime.\n\nThis PDX neighborhood gem leans into elevated comfort food and a breakfast menu that\u2019s creative without being fussy. Think seasonal scrambles, huge pancakes and the best hot sauce I\u2019ve had in ages, proudly made by the owner. (She walked over to my table and poured it on my eggs, unprompted). Oh yeah, and there\u2019s live music at like, 8 AM. You love to see it.\n\nBeloved for its dog-friendly patio and hearty, feel-good fare, Tin Shed serves big, satisfying sandwiches (the chicken sando with jam was perfectly sweet and savory), bowls and scrambles. It\u2019s the kind of place where the portions are generous, the service is warm and everyone leaves happy (most importantly, your pup).\n\nA whole-animal butcher shop and sandwich counter in one, Pasture PDX turns responsibly raised meats into some of the best sandwiches in the city. Expect expertly layered flavors, house-cured meats and sides that rival the mains, like the daily soup which was flavorful and filling enough to be a meal on its own.\n\nSitting gracefully inside the Cascada Hotel, Terra Mae fuses the rustic soul of the Portuguese countryside with the sleek precision of modern Japanese cuisine. From luxurious milk-bread buns with duck-skin butter to wagyu tartare and octopus salad, every dish unfolds with elegance\u2014and unexpected depth. Be sure to order the peri peri chicken, duck duck rice and the linguica dumplings.\n\nKnown for its naturally leavened pizzas and seasonal salads, Lovely\u2019s Fifty Fifty is a Portland institution. Local produce and house-made everything make for pies that are as beautiful as they are flavorful. Don\u2019t skip the little gem lettuces with fresh and creamy garlic dressing and the cherry tomato confit with shaved summer squash pizza.\n\nWhere To Get PDX Drinks\n\nA lively, neighborhood cocktail bar with irresistible charm, Take Two welcomes you \u201cback on the horse\u201d every evening with stellar drinks, casual bites and a vibe that\u2019s both cozy and cool. With nods to \u201860s-and-\u201970s film, Italian-American fare and western flair all under one relaxed roof, it\u2019s the kind of spot where guilty pleasures feel delightfully guilt-free. Don\u2019t miss their daily happy hour, 3-5 PM.\n\nLocated inside McMenamins Kennedy School Hotel (an abandoned elementary school transformed into a whimsical, retro hotel) the Boiler Room serves up creative cocktails in a cozy, wood-and-brick space. A drink here feels like sipping history with a twist. It\u2019s a quirky date night spot that will give you something to talk about, even if the date\u2019s a bust.",

      "text": "Wild, fanciful murals are everywhere\u2014on the bicycle shop, a parking lot, the patios of bars-mixed in with a totally eclectic mix of bookstores, galleries, cafes for coffee and multinational cuisines and a marijuana shop. Alberta Street, the main thoroughfare of Portland\u2019s Alberta Arts District is such a funky/interesting/colorful stretch that you expect to see Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein ambling by. (The stars of the amiable TV satire Portlandia for those who\u2019ve never watched.)\nOn the western edge of the street, the corner of 11th and Alberta, a very serious, very modern building opened in March: CASCADA Thermal Springs + Hotel. The first hospitality project by Solterra, a company specializing in sustainable buildings, it might be an outlier in the neighborhood\u2019s style with its sleek, contemporary look but its spirit is definitely in sync.\nCASCADA Thermal Springs + Hotel\u2019s Wellness Facilities\nKey to the hotel is that sustainability; every aspect of it is of cutting edge, environmentally friendly composition and function, earning it status as LEED Platinum (solar power, rainwater harvesting, energy efficient lighting and much more.) What is more visible to guests, though, are the cossetting setting and the extensive wellness facilities starting with a 32 foot long pool in the Conservatory bordered by a 25 foot wall of rare plants and maintained at 82 degrees. Not surprisingly, it invites socializing while draped poolside on loungers.\nA floor below is the dark, atmospheric Sanctuary with its centerpiece the hydrotherapy circuit comprised of four thermal pools of varying temperatures (one enhanced with trace minerals and magnesium) with water emanating from the pristine rivers and streams of the Bull Run Watershed east of Portland, then heated and purified with state of the art technology. Around the pools are a hammam, steam room, ice fountain and treatment rooms for rituals combining European, Mayan and Middle Eastern elements with botanicals and advanced techniques. There\u2019s also an outdoor Secret Garden with another pool, cold shower and caf\u00e9 as well as a daily roster of fitness and wellness options such as sound healing, breathwork, pilates and infrared, flow, and power yoga.\nSustainable, Well Equipped Hotel Rooms\nUpstairs, the 100 black/white/grey rooms in contemporary, minimalist style also mirror the sustainable focus with materials such as recycled cork furniture upholstery (which is smooth and comfortable) and wool, fire-retardant mattresses. There are also features such as kitchens and washer-dryers which encourage long stays and balconies for hanging out and watching the goings on in the neighborhood.\nPortuguese/Japanese Cuisine At Terra Mae\nThe restaurant, Terra Mae, a fusion of Portuguese and Japanese cuisine, is already a Portland favorite and one unusually open on a Tuesday night; some top restaurants in town are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. The room is buzzing and the menu creative without being crazy: really delicious dishes such as Dumplings with the Portuguese pork sausage Lingui\u00e7a, leeks, cabbage, peri-peri chili crisp, curry, scallion and black garlic; Mentaiko Udon, the chewy Japanese wheat noodles with spicy pollock roe, garlic, cream, soy cured egg yolk and garlic furikake, a salty Japanese seasoning; Wasabi Salad of King neighborhood pea tendrils, edible blossom, tempura flakes and creamy wasabi dressing and a Fisherman\u2019s Stew with Black Cod, miso, tiger prawns and clams in a rich seafood broth.\nThe Lobby Coffee Bar\nThe hotel also has a lobby level caf\u00e9 Alberta Street Coffee for coffee and croissants or muffins in the morning along with a grab and go case of sandwiches, salads, prepared foods and cheeses; the restaurant Forbidden Fruit is due to open in October for breakfast and brunch. In the meantime, Alberta Street is studded with other options as is Portland, overall, regarded as the top culinary center of the Pacific Northwest.\nAlberta Street Breakfast Spots\nThree blocks away, M\u00e8moire C\u00e0 Ph\u00ea, the Vietnamese brunch caf\u00e9 started by three friends as an homage to their parents celebrates the food they shared with them when they were growing up such as \u0110\u1eb7c Bi\u1ec7t Waffle, a waffle with fish sauce, bacon, fried egg, arugula, crunchy stuff, scallion, and spicy syrup and pastries such as matcha cinnamon rolls. The Australian Proud Mary Caf\u00e9 veers from spins on breakfast classics such as Ricotta Hotcakes (in theirs: lemon chamomile syrup, blueberries &raspberries, yogurt & white chocolate namelaka, poppyseeds, pistachio cookie crumble plus flowers) to sausage rolls and a pulled pork sando with gochujang & fish sauce braised pork, daikon,cilantro, carrot, red cabbage, pickled onion, miso aioli, sesame seed bun, and chili cukes.\nFor more traditional choices, The Tin Shed Garden Caf\u00e9 is popular for breakfast dishes such as Fetch, a bacon, tomato and green onion scramble over potato cakes or cheese grits served with a homemade buttermilk biscuit and sandwiches such as Salmon & Spice: Blackened Alaskan Sockeye with pepperjack, roasted red peppers, arugula, red onion and chipotle aioli on a grilled potato bun. Guests\u2019 dogs are encouraged to accompany their humans on the patio; they have their own dish on the menu, Fido Food: free range chicken thighs and sweet potatoes.\nItalian and Hawaiian Cuisine on Alberta Street\nTwo popular restaurants also settled on the street after stints as a pop up and food cart. Gumba, a handmade pasta specialist moved in after four years as a food cart five years ago. Oahu raised couple Brandon and Tracee Hirahara opened Kau Kau on the street in February serving family recipes for Hawaiian specialties such as Loco Moco, Kalua Pig, Lomi Salmon and an elevated crunchy, sweet and spicy mac salad.\nLocals\u2019 favorite: Cafe Olli\nA few blocks away but still in the neighborhood, Caf\u00e9 Olli, recently anointed one of the 25 best Portland restaurants by the New York Times, is a locals\u2019 favorite not just for what they serve but for the overall spirit of the place due to their employee-owned, generous benefit laden democracy. (A 20% health and wellness fee is added to checks in order to pay employees a living wage and offer health care coverage.) Open all day, it\u2019s known for house made baguettes, ricotta toast, crisp pizzas, particularly the Pomodoro, and in the evening, pastas such as chitarra with sungold sauce, garlic, basil, chili and Parmigiano.\nEem: A Successful Thai/BBQ Fusion\nDown the street, Eem, open for lunch and dinner every day, is the result of three major Portland chefs joining forces: Chef Earl Ninsom (Langbaan, Paadee), Matt Vicedomini (Matt\u2019s BBQ) and Eric Nelson (Shipwreck) with the result a mix of Thai and BBQ that produces deeply flavored, exciting food. Among the choices: Green Curry with Crispy Pulled Pork, roasted cauliflower, lime leaf, oyster mushroom, coconut cream, green onion and fried shallot and Smoked Pork Krapao with pork belly burnt ends, Thai basil and fried egg. But the dish that regulars order again and again, for good reason, is White Curry with Brisket Burnt-ends with roasted cauliflower, coconut cream and green onion. It is that delicious.\nA New Wine Spa\nGiven its proximity to the Willamette Valley, a day trip to sample the region\u2019s famous Pinot Noirs is easy to do. But even easier is to soak in and drink some of that wine while in town. Owner Kelly Lewis opened The Wine Spa last fall after trying out vinotherapy in Eastern Europe and discovering the anti-aging and anti-inflammatory benefits. Making deals with local vineyards which have unsaleable wine due to bottling errors or overproduction allows the use of at least a bottle and half per soak plus an additional glass to enjoy. The result is immediate relaxation (a massage helps too), a perfect end to a day running around town."

      "text": "Portland is a city that\u2019s easy to regularly check in on, and that\u2019s because promising new spots, especially restaurants and bars, are popping up all the time. And with spring officially in the air and summer just around the corner, right now \u2013 just ahead of the upcoming travel rush \u2013 is a sublime time to schedule a trip to the City of Roses.\nBelow, 10 reasons why you should visit Portland, Oregon, this spring.\nAce Hotel Portland\nWhat\u2019s old is new again at this Portland mainstay. Though the boutique hotel occupying a historic downtown structure has maintained its hip reputation since opening in 2007, the pandemic offered a unique opportunity to shift gears and freshen up. The 79 rooms are lighter and brighter than ever, thanks to a crisp paint job, lots of added greenery, and custom touches like batten wall features, APC denim blankets, and black chairs. And though the property\u2019s restaurant Clyde Common regrettably shuttered earlier this year, in its place a complimentary breakfast of Stumptown Coffee, Smith Teas, and St. Honore pastries is offered daily in The Pantry to hotel guests.\nKimpton Riverplace Hotel\nDespite being one of Portland\u2019s more classic properties, Kimpton RiverPlace Hotel manages to feel reserved for those in-the-know \u2013 which is a surprise, given its scenic waterfront location, 84 rooms and suites done up in a handsome, lodge-inspired design, and new chef at its restaurant King Tide Fish and Shell. Peruvian-born Alexander Diestra brings 18 years of experience to the revamped menu, which translates into artful, seafood-driven plates with Peruvian and Japanese flourishes. His Kanpachi Crudo, for example, features slices of buttery fish dressed with avocado, capers, blood orange, and chili vinaigrette so every bite is equal parts savory, tangy, and spicy.\nAlbina Soul Walk\nAvailable for free on the ECHOES mobile app, Albina Soul Walk is a self-guided, one-mile audio tour created by artist Megan Hattie Stahl, curated by Bobby Smith, and narrated by lifelong Portland musicians Calvin Walker and Norman Sylvester. It chronicles how the Northeast neighborhood was once home to an incredibly vibrant soul music scene from the 1960s to 1980s, and gradually dissolved because of systemic racism and gentrification.\nOyatsupan\nIt\u2019s not new. It\u2019s not even technically in Portland, though Beaverton an easy drive from downtown. But this charming and inviting Japanese bakery owned by veteran baker Hiro Horie is an absolute must when you\u2019re in town. Though Oyatsupan bakes about 70 treats all from scratch, you can\u2019t go wrong with more classic items like the pillowy-soft and subtly sweet milk bread \u2013 Horie\u2019s dough undergoes a 24-hour fermentation \u2013 custardy egg salad sandwich, and savory beef curry donuts.\nPhuket Cafe\nBecause hot spot Phuket Cafe doesn\u2019t take reservations, arrive at least ten minutes ahead of opening \u2013 yes, there will already be a line \u2013 to secure a table. Your patience will be rewarded with chef and owner Akkapong \u201cEarl\u201d Ninsom\u2019s imaginative Thai-inspired menu of savory-sweet pandan cheese roti (add the salmon roe), zesty striped bass ceviche, and showstopping Thai Paella with plump mussels and a \u201cdry\u201d tom yum. Save room for the crepe cake flavored with black sesame, coffee, and passionfruit.\nLazy Susan\nAnother buzzy spot by Earl Ninsom, Montavilla\u2019s Lazy Susan whips up approachable, comforting dishes \u2013 many of which are cooked over a natural coal fire. Start with the smoked whitefish spread with fried saltines, before diving into the Backyard BBQ Grill-Burger. Easily one of the city\u2019s best, this version with a beef patty, American cheese, special sauce, and pickles is everything a burger should be: straightforward and satisfying. Even better? It arrives with two gloriously crispy hash browns.\nSt. Beatrix\nIt\u2019s nearly impossible to drop by St. Beatrix, the tiny but mighty bakery owned by Jess Smith, without wanting to try, well, everything. And that\u2019s because of Smith\u2019s penchant for unexpected, but surprisingly cravable flavor combinations \u2013 on my visit, there were blackberry marshmallow coconut muffins and scones with green chili, cheddar, and cream cheese \u2013 and her positively pretty custom cakes adorned with fresh flowers.\nThe Sports Bra\nJenny Nguyen opened The Sports Bra on NE Broadway for one reason: to address the glaring inequality between men\u2019s and women\u2019s sports. To that end, her cleverly-named bar is dedicated exclusively to women's sports. From the paraphernalia decorating the space to the women\u2019s games playing on the TV screens, everything here champions the largely overlooked athetic accomplishments of women.\nGabbiano\u2019s\nGabbiano\u2019s has everything you\u2019d expect in a classic, red sauce joint. The vibe is laid back and lively, and the portions are generous. But where it differs from other old-school spots is in its subtly elevated recipes. The spaghetti with marinara is made with chewy, handmade noodles enrobed in a silky and buttery tomato sauce, while the popular fried mozzarella is shaped into \u201cshots\u201d and filled with the house marinara.\nMikiko Mochi Donuts\nThe mochi donut trend that\u2019s sweeping across the country has landed in the City of Roses at Mikiko Mochi Donuts. Owned by partners in work and life Alex McGillivray and Emily Mikiko Strocher, this cozy Northeast shop turns out the springy, chewy treats in whimsical flavors such as Yuzu Vanilla Funfetti and Horchata Pudding. And because they\u2019re baked and dairy- and gluten-free, you can indulge in more than one."
