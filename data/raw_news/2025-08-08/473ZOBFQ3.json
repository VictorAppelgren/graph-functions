  "description": "There is very little difference in price between buying tools direct from Ryobi or shopping at Home Depot, although sales events can drive prices down.",
  "content": "Is It Cheaper To Buy Ryobi Tools From Its Website Or Home Depot?\n\nRyobi is one of the biggest tool brands around, and has just about any tool you could need for any job. While won't find any Ryobi tools at Lowe's, they're not difficult to find. The most obvious choice is the Ryobi website. Granted, you do need to pay for shipping and wait for your tools to arrive, but at least you're getting them from the source. Alternatively, hardware giant Home Depot is a great place to get Ryobi tools. It has a wide selection and brick-and-mortar locations, so you can get your tools as soon as you need them, while avoiding shipping costs. As far as what tools will cost from these two sources, however, there's no guarantee that one will always be cheaper than the other. Looking over the Ryobi website and the shelves of Home Depot, Ryobi tools tend to vary in price. If you want the cheapest option, you'll have to consider which tools you need to find the cheaper retailer.\n\nIf you want to fill out your Ryobi tool collection fast, a tool kit could be a great buy. In this case, Home Depot is likely your best bet price-wise. Not only is the kit selection wider, but they're often on sale or generally priced lower than their Ryobi listing. For instance, the ONE+ 18-volt two-tool combo kit, ONE+ 18V cordless 12-tool combo kit, and ONE+ 18V cordless drill and impact driver kit are all currently listed at significantly lower prices than their Ryobi website equivalents. Granted, those that are on discount aren't always guaranteed to be at that rate for long, so it's a good idea to jump on such deals while you can. As far as individual tools go, there's a bit more inconsistency. Looking at smaller hand tools such as drills and sanders, there's not much deviation between the two tool sources, but there are some cases where checking both sites is a good idea. Case in point: the 18V ONE+ Airstrike 16-gauge nailer. Ryobi has it listed for $179 on sale, while Home Depot has it listed for $199. There can be discrepancies with larger tools as well, with the 40V backpack blower set \u2014 not to be confused with Ryobi's gas-powered leaf blowers \u2014 costing $429 at Home Depot while Ryobi has it for $329 on sale. To reiterate, though, these sales won't last forever, so keep this in mind while shopping. At the end of the day, all one can really do is check both the Home Depot and Ryobi website listings for the tools they want to ensure they're getting the best rate possible.\n\nTrying to save money beyond Home Depot and Ryobi can get risky While it's not impossible to find a deal on Ryobi tools, the brand's website and Home Depot might still leave you a bit light in the wallet. As a result, other, potentially cheaper sources, such as Amazon or the Walmart website, might seem ideal to build out your Ryobi arsenal. While this might seem like a great way to get a deal from a reputable retailer, they may not have the best selection. Compared to the other negatives, though, this isn't too big of a deal. At the end of the day, Ryobi is technically a Home Depot exclusive brand, having been so since 2000. As a result, the likes of Amazon and Walmart don't technically carry the brand's products in an official capacity. Rather, third-party sellers go through their websites to sell their goods, and while they can be trustworthy, not all of them are. Thus, if you buy Ryobi from them, there's a chance the quality could lack, parts could be missing, and other negatives could present themselves. Not to mention, they may not come with one of Ryobi's warranties, so if something goes wrong, you can't turn to the brand for help. The history of Ryobi tools reveals decent-quality tools sold at competitive prices. They may get expensive through Home Depot and the Ryobi website, but deals can be had, and sometimes, it's worth paying a little more than taking a risk on the product.",

      "text": "The Ryobi Timeline: A Closer Look At The History Of Ryobi Tools\nFor eight decades, the Ryobi brand has produced countless innovations across industries. Despite its humble Japanese origins, it's no wonder that it is now a global household name in more ways than one. Although not necessarily regarded to be as durable as other brands, Ryobi power tools have been known for mostly favorable reviews. Because of their performance and price range, Ryobi power tools are loved by pros and novices alike.\nFrom its cordless drills to soldering pens to air compressors, Ryobi offers products that generally work for straightforward, everyday tasks. Whether you are working on vehicles, kitchen remodeling, or landscaping, there's likely a Ryobi power tool that will help with the job.\nHowever, Ryobi didn't actually start out selling power tools. Here's a look at its history, various owners, and where it might be headed in the years to come.\nThe origins of Ryobi (1940s)\nIn September 1943, the manager of Mitsubishi Electric's Fukuyama Works in Hiroshima, Japan, proposed the possibility of die casting to Yutaka Urakami. At the time, Yutaka was operating a small trading company and knew nothing about it. However, within a week of this conversation, Yutaka rose to the challenge.\nDie casting, according to Ryobi, \"is a metal casting process that involves feeding molten nonferrous alloys into dies under high pressure and at high speed to rapidly create molded products.\" In December 1943, Ryobi, then called \"Ryobi Seisakusho Co., Ltd.\" was established in Hiroshima, Japan. After two months, Ryobi held an opening ceremony for the company, wherein it began manufacturing these products in a retro-fitted soy sauce warehouse and selling them.\nHere, Ryobi was able to mass produce thin, complex products, which created smooth casting surfaces that required less machining after being molded.\nAmong its most popular products, were Ryobi-made automobile industry components. Some of its examples of die casts for cars include cylinder blocks, transmission cases, and shock towers. Ryobi claims that the die casts it produce contribute to the overall weight reduction of vehicles, which is a key aspect that helps improve overall fuel efficiency. After a decade of creating metal die cast products, Ryobi began manufacturing plastic die cast products in 1954.\nRyobi enters the power tools market (1970s)\nIn 1961, Ryobi became a publicly traded company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. That same year, it also began manufacturing offset printing presses and later merged with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Machinery Systems, Ltd. It became RYOBI MHI Graphic Technology Ltd. in 2014. Afterward, it expanded its operations across a variety of industries, such as builder's hardware, fishing tackles, and an insurance agency. To make its name simpler and easier to remember, Ryobi Seisakusho was renamed to Ryobi Limited.\nIn 1968, Ryobi unlocked one category that helped make it a household name worldwide: power tools. From budget-friendly to expensive products made for heavy-duty work, Ryobi amassed a huge portfolio of power tools for both casual and professional users. In 1996, Ryobi launched the cordless lithium-ion technology, the RYOBI 18V ONE+ System, which is still being used until today and features over 280 innovative compatible products.\nUnfortunately, as Japan experienced economic decline in the 1990s, the power tools business came under fire. To keep the company afloat, Ryobi announced its Sound Management Plan, a policy that helped reform unprofitable businesses and focus its resources on areas of strength. To do this, Ryobi planned to reduce its workforce, axe its golfing goods, and fishing tackle businesses, as well as sell most of its overseas power tool business.\nRyobi's changing ownership\nBy 2018, Ryobi decided to execute a company split, which established the Kyocera Corporation, a new company specifically aimed at its power tools business in Japan, Asia, and Africa. Aside from transferring 80% of its shares, Ryobi also turned over all operations related to it, including a manufacturing plant in China and 48 sales office in Japan.\nIn North America, Techtronic Industries Co., Ltd. (TTI), a Hong Kong-based company, has handled the manufacturing and distribution of Ryobi products since August 2000. By 2002, TTI acquired Ryobi's power tools business in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand as well. TTI's brand portfolio also includes other powerhouse brands like Milwaukee, AEG, Empire, Hoover and more. In 2022, TTI claimed to have generated $13.3 billion in annual sales across its portfolio.\nIn 2023, Home Depot named TTI's two brands, Milwaukee Tool and Ryobi, as Partner of the Year under three different categories. In a press release, it also shares that Ryobi Outdoor Power Equipment was one of the finalists of the 2023 Innovation Award. It was the first time in the award's history that a supplier has won three Partner of the Year awards in a single year.\nThe state of Ryobi power tools today\nIn 2023, Yipit Data claims that Ryobi has led the outdoor power equipment industry with a 20% market share for the past two years. In the United States, Yipit Data also notes that Ryobi's power tool brand share for Home Depot made up 35% of its total sales in Q4 2022.\nWith this, it's no wonder that the World Tool Awards hailed the Ryobi cordless nailer R15GN18 as the winner of its Premium class of Cordless Nailers category in 2022. A year later, Ryobi also snagged 9 wins at the 2023 Pro Tool Innovation Awards, including cordless power tools: the Ryobi 18V ONE+ 1800W Power Station RYi818BG for inverters over 1000w and the 18V ONE+ HP Mud Mixer PBLMM01B mixer.\nAnd, it looks like Ryobi has no intention of slowing down. In 2023 alone, Ryobi introduced 17 new products to its line up, which include compact cutting tools, cordless blowers, and hedge trimmers. It also unveiled the new Ryobi 80V Power Source, which works in tandem with existing Ryobi 80V batteries and can provide up to 1000 watts of power on the go."

      "text": "Here's Why You Won't Find Ryobi Tools At Lowe's\nIf you've ever spent much time walking around the power tool section of your local hardware store, then you've probably noticed that most stores only carry a limited selection of brands. Even the biggest major retail chains don't sell everything. You may even notice that some of the most popular power tool brands are missing from their inventory.\nLowe's, for instance, is one of the largest brick-and-mortar power tool outlets in the country, but they don't carry Ryobi products in their stores or even online despite Ryobi being one of the most recognizable and budget-friendly major tool brands on the market. Lowe's sells DeWalt, Craftsman, Bosch, Flex, Black & Decker, Skil, and a wide range of other reputable brands, but the green and black Ryobi products are conspicuously absent from its shelves.\nThis might seem like a curious omission, but there is a simple explanation for why Lowe's doesn't sell Ryobi products. Despite the Ryobi brand of power tools being Japanese in origin, the company has been affiliated with Home Depot for several years. What's more, a major condition of that partnership is that Ryobi not sell its products through other retail outlets in the U.S. You might still be able to purchase Ryobi products from certain online retailers such as Amazon, but Home Depot is the only physical location that is allowed to carry them in the U.S.\nRyobi is a Home Depot-affiliated brand\nRyobi has a fairly unique history for a power tool brand. The company was founded in Hiroshima, Japan, back in 1943 under the name Ryobi Seisakusho Co. It became a publicly traded entity in 1961, entered the power tools market in 1968, and started its first cordless power tool brand in 1996. Ryobi operated more or less like any other independent power tool brand during this period, but in the year 2000, the company entered into an agreement with The Home Depot in which it became the store's exclusive partner.\n\"We're proud to have RYOBI as an exclusive partner of The Home Depot, \" the company's vice president of merchandising, Jim Recore, states. \"RYOBI continues to improve power and run time every season, and we're always excited to bring that innovation to our stores and our customers.\"\nRyobi split into two separate companies in 2018. A controlling interest of Ryobi Limited's ownership shares was transferred to the Kyocera Group in Japan, which continued to run the power tool side of the business. Meanwhile, the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand lawn and garden equipment production was taken over by the Hong Kong-based company, Techtronic Industries. TTI would also later go on to take over the power tool business in these regions as well. But despite all these changes in ownership over the years, Ryobi has remained steadfast in its partnership with Home Depot and still does not sell its products through other physical retailers.\nLowe's has Kobalt\nJust because Home Depot has a lock on Ryobi doesn't mean that Lowe's doesn't have its own affordable power tool brand. Kobalt is owned by Lowe's and serves as the retail chain's official store brand in a very similar capacity to the way Ryobi serves Home Depot. Like Ryobi, Kobalt's tools are largely offered as a budget alternative to other name brands, with the vast majority of its products being marked at significantly lower prices than the competitors you're likely to find in the store. This places them in a position where the brand's first priority isn't necessarily competing to be the top performer, but is more aimed at offering a solid price-to-performance ratio for budget-conscious buyers.\nKobalt has its own 24V battery system for cordless tools. The company doesn't have quite as big a range of products as Ryobi, but Kobalt makes a lot of essentials that you might want for your garage. It manufactures saws, drills, drivers, sanders, and other major power tools as well as outdoor power equipment like blowers, mowers, string trimmers, chain saws, and hedge trimmers. It also makes a wide range of accessories for these tools and several other non-powered products such as wood axes, wheelbarrows, tampers, and some excellent rolling toolboxes.\nSo, those who are set on getting Ryobi tools will either need to order online or commute to the nearest Home Depot, but those who are simply looking for an affordable power tool brand might consider giving the Kobalt tools a look next time they visit their local Lowe's."

My son, who owns a landscaping Co. Was also impressed. The battery life is not going to last all day, but neither do I! I love this more than my Stihl, and that says a lot.\"\n- RvT123\nPortable Dolly & Work Table in One: SPEED BENCH MOBILE WORKSTATION\n\"It's perfect for what I bought it for. I'm a crafter and I'm at fairs and festivals all summer. This allows me to setup my laser quickly and efficiently. When in dolly mode I can carry all the supplies to my booth then unfold it to use as a work table.\"\n- Happyhappy\nThis thing packs the power!!!: 18V ONE+ 4AH LITHIUM HIGH PERFORMANCE EDGE BATTERY\n\"I am shocked at the capacity and power of this thing! I have only had it about two weeks now but it is making projects fun again. More power and it is so effortless to use. It is so nice to have the longer run times! I am grabbing another one of these for the shop and the house! Worth the upgrade, hands down!\"\n- Andrew"

  "argos_summary": "The article compares purchasing Ryobi tools from its official website versus Home Depot, noting that while both sources have varying prices, Home Depot often offers better deals on tool kits. Individual tool prices can fluctuate, so shoppers are advised to check both retailers for the best rates. Additionally, Ryobi is exclusively partnered with Home Depot in the U.S., meaning their products are not available at Lowe's or other major retailers, which could limit options for consumers. Overall, while Ryobi tools can be found at competitive prices, buyers should be cautious when considering third-party sellers on platforms like Amazon or Walmart.",
