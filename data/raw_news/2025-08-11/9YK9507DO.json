  "title": "Thinking about getting a free iPhone 16 Pro from your carrier? Don't make this big mistake I made when you sign the contract",
  "description": "You won't be free to do what you like with that free phone",
  "content": "The best smartphone deals come from mobile network carriers, but there\u2019s a big catch you should know about if you\u2019re considering getting an iPhone 16 Pro \u2018On Us\u2019 or if you want to score a massive discount on a Galaxy Z Fold 7. If you\u2019re planning on switching phones before the payment plan has ended, there\u2019s a major catch, and the warning was hard to find in the contract agreements I signed.\n\nHere\u2019s my situation: when I wanted a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra in early 2023, AT&T offered it for a very low monthly price on two conditions. First, I needed to trade in any Galaxy phone in any condition. No sweat! I had one hanging around. Second, I needed to sign up for a new line of service on a plan with unlimited monthly data. Also, no problem for me; I needed a new line and I use a ton of GBs.\n\nThe Galaxy S23 Ultra with 512GB of storage was almost $1,400 when I bought it. That equals $38.34 per month for 36 months, and AT&T was offering to pay more than 70% of that monthly payment as long as I was a customer. I pay $10.56 monthly, and in the end, I\u2019ll have paid only $380 for the best phone I could buy back then.\n\nYeah, I don't keep any phone for 3 whole years, but this time...\n\nOf course, I wasn\u2019t planning on keeping the Ultra for longer than a year. I signed a three-year agreement, but I planned on trading the Galaxy S23 Ultra for an S24 Ultra a year later. I wouldn\u2019t sign up for a new contract; instead, I would just trade in my phone. Samsung would give me $1,000 for the trade (Samsung\u2019s norm), and I would pay the remaining $400 in cash. Instead, I got hosed.\n\nBefore I traded in my Galaxy S23 Ultra, I looked into selling it on Swappa. When I entered my phone\u2019s IMEI number \u2013 the unique identifier assigned to all smartphones \u2013 Swappa rejected my sale. I was told my phone is ineligible for sale because there is a lien on the phone from AT&T.\n\nI honestly did not know a phone lien was a thing. I knew that information could be attached to an IMEI number. For instance, if you report a phone stolen, the IMEI number can identify the stolen device later if the thief tries to sell it. I had no clue the IMEI could be used by my carrier to claim ownership over a phone I purchased.\n\nHere's how AT&T will stop you from selling your phone before you pay it off\n\nI have spent time poring over every document I signed. I cannot find the word \u2018lien\u2019 anywhere. I reached out to AT&T, and they explained what was happening\u2026 kind of.\n\nMy new smartphone does not technically have a \u2018lien,\u2019 but the contract works the same way. AT&T claims a purchase money security interest (PMSI) on my device until it is paid in full. That means they have the right to claim any proceeds if I sell the device.\n\nThat sounds awfully like a lien, huh? It\u2019s close, but a lien is more legally enforceable. The real purpose of a purchase money security interest clause is to make sure AT&T gets paid if I go into bankruptcy and I\u2019m forced to sell my smartphone. In practice, it keeps me from selling the phone early, the same way a lien on my car title would prevent me from selling my car.\n\nIt's not just an AT&T problem, but carriers still offer a good deal\n\nThis isn\u2019t just an AT&T issue. A Verizon rep told me, \u201cWe do not place liens on devices. If a customer does not continually meet eligibility requirements to get the device on us, they are responsible for payment of the device.\u201d That sounds definitive, but Verizon\u2019s contract language contains a purchase money security interest clause similar to the language AT&T uses.\n\nT-Mobile did not respond with comment, and I could not find any PMSI clause in T-Mobile contracts. However, if you are planning on ditching your phone early, you may want to read the current contract closely, as terms can change.\n\nI still think carrier deals for free phones are good deals. Even if you only get a discount, it\u2019s a huge discount. If you want a Galaxy Z Fold 7, for instance, that phone costs $1,999.99 / \u00a31,799 / AU$2,899. If you sign up with AT&T, they will pay up to $1,100 of that total if you stick with them for three years.\n\nFor most people, that will be the only way to afford today\u2019s most expensive phones, and three years is the right amount of time to own today\u2019s best phones. The required service plan will be a pricier option, but if you use a lot of data like me, a Wi-Fi hotspot amount, you\u2019re probably getting a top plan anyway. You might as well get the best deal on the top phone to go with it.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 I showed the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 to a Z Fold 4 owner, and he was blown away\n\u2022 The Google Pixel 10 Pro series has been pictured in four shades \u2013 some of which we like far more than others\n\u2022 The iPhone 17 has a rumored launch date \u2013 here are 5 big changes to expect",

  "summary": "The article discusses the pitfalls of smartphone deals from mobile network carriers such as AT&T and Verizon, as well as other major networks, for switching phones before the payment plan has ended. The author found a loophole in his contract agreement when he bought a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra from AT&TT for a low monthly price and needed to trade in any Galaxy phone in any condition. The company then claimed a purchase money security interest (PMSI) on my device until it is paid in full, which means they have the right to claim any proceeds if I sells the device. However, this issue is not just an ATTT problem, but carriers still offer good deals. If you are planning on switching phones early, you may need to read the current contract terms carefully.",
  "shortSummary": "Despite offering excellent smartphone deals, AT&T's contract agreements contain hidden clauses that prevent users from selling their devices before payment plans expire, potentially leading to phone sales later.",

      "text": "The iPhone 17 has a rumored launch date \u2013 here are 5 big changes to expect\nIt might land on September 9\n- The iPhone 17 series could be unveiled on September 9\n- It might then ship on September 19\n- We've detailed five of the biggest changes you can expect from these phones\nWe\u2019ve long predicted \u2013 based on Apple\u2019s usual patterns \u2013 that the iPhone 17 series would be announced on September 8, 9, or 10, and now a leak agrees with us, while also getting more specific.\nAccording to \u201cinternal information from German mobile phone providers\u201d shared by iphone-ticker.de (via GSMArena), the iPhone 17 series \u2013 including the iPhone 17 itself, the iPhone 17 Air, the iPhone 17 Pro, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max \u2013 will be unveiled on Tuesday, September 9.\nThey add that these phones will then apparently ship a week and a half later, on Friday, September 19.\nWhile we\u2019d take these claims with a pinch of salt, it is believable that major retailers would now have this information. Plus, it fits with our own predictions, and doesn\u2019t conflict with any other leaks, so for now we\u2019d say September 9 looks to be the most likely announcement date.\nIn which case, there\u2019s only just over a month to wait for Apple\u2019s next handsets, and these phones are likely to be worth the wait, as numerous upgrades and changes have been tipped. Below, we\u2019ve listed five of the biggest changes we\u2019re expecting.\n1. A new design\nPerhaps the biggest change tipped for the iPhone 17 line is a visual one, with numerous sources suggesting these handsets will get a redesign.\nThe main change is likely to come to the camera block, which will reportedly run across the entire width of the back on most models, giving these phones a more Google Pixel 9-like appearance.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThis change could allow for more of a two-tone color scheme, too, with the large camera block being glossy while the rest of the rear is more matte.\n2. An iPhone 17 Air instead of an iPhone 17 Plus\nAnother big rumored change is the replacement of the Plus model with an iPhone 17 Air. This new model will reportedly be far slimmer than any previous iPhone, likely coming in at around 5.5mm thick, which would make it a more direct rival to the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge.\nHowever, as a result of being so slim, it might also have a small battery, and is thought to have just one rear camera.\nSo, it\u2019s a phone that might prioritize style over specs, though it could still have a large 6.7-inch screen like the iPhone 16 Plus.\n3. A 120Hz refresh rate for every model\nApple has continued to stick with 60Hz screens on the base iPhones, despite most mid-range Android phones having had 120Hz screens for years now. But with the iPhone 17 line, Apple might finally be getting with the times.\nNumerous reports suggest that all four expected models will have a 120Hz display, which should make scrolling feel smoother.\nHowever, one source claims that while the screens will all be 120Hz, the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air still won\u2019t have a variable refresh rate, meaning that, unlike their Pro siblings, they probably wouldn\u2019t support always-on display, as this needs a very low refresh rate to function without demolishing the battery. Either way, though, giving them a 120Hz refresh rate would definitely be an upgrade.\n4. New cameras\nThe iPhone 17 series is also rumored to be getting some new cameras, with every model set to benefit.\nFor one thing, all four expected iPhone 17 models will apparently have a 24MP front-facing camera, giving you twice the megapixels of the current 12MP one. We\u2019ve also heard that the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max could have a 48MP telephoto camera, which would be up from just 12MP on the current models.\nSome less likely but still possible upgrades we\u2019ve heard about include 8K video recording for the Pro models, and a mechanical aperture for at least one iPhone 17 model. That latter upgrade would allow you to adjust the aperture, and therefore also the depth of field.\nAnd there are also some rumored camera upgrades that we\u2019re not convinced we\u2019ll see but can\u2019t totally rule out, including an 8x optical zoom for the iPhone 17 Pro models and a second Camera Control button for all four models.\n5. A big boost in power\nFinally, one totally unsurprising but still appreciated upgrade that we\u2019re hearing about is a power boost thanks to a new chipset.\nSpecifically, the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max could have a new A19 Pro chipset, while the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air could have an A19 chipset. In all cases, that should be an improvement, as the current models use A18 or A18 Pro chipsets.\nAdditionally, the iPhone 17 Pro, the iPhone 17 Pro Max, and possibly also the iPhone 17 Air could have 12GB of RAM \u2013 up from 8GB in the iPhone 16 series.\nYou might also like\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

But the other two options are a bit more interesting.\nA bit more color\nThere\u2019s Moonstone, which we\u2019ve actually seen the Pixel 10 Pro in already via an official teaser. This is rather understated, but the hint of blue in it makes this more interesting than a pure gray option.\nThe highlight, though, is arguably Jade \u2013 it\u2019s a soft, delicate shade that still somewhat fits with the rest of the color options, but is a bit brighter and more unusual. Really, we\u2019d like to see more of this sort of thing, rather than top-end phones defaulting to plain shades, but at least there\u2019s one option here for those who want a splash of color.\nWe\u2019ll find out how accurate this color leak is soon, as Google is set to unveil the Pixel 10 series on August 20. We\u2019re expecting to see the Pixel 10 itself along with the Pixel 10 Pro, the Pixel 10 Pro XL, and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, so there should be a lot to look forward to.\nYou might also like\n- Google just teased the Pixel 10 Pro \u2013 and a fresh new Pixel color\n- The Google Pixel 10 series just appeared on multiple official databases, suggesting an imminent arrival\n- The Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold could beat the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 in two significant ways\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nA tougher build, faster memory and storage, a more efficient battery, a custom-tuned chipset and a new 200MP main camera hidden behind a familiar design; the S23 Ultra is a more substantial upgrade than you might first realize. Provided you're not dissuaded by the steep asking price, in every other regard you'll be getting one of the best phones in the world.\nPros\n- +\nBespoke Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset\n- +\nMore base storage than predecessor\n- +\nFunctional refinements\nCons\n- -\nFaster charging would have been nice\n- -\nLooks identical to predecessor\n- -\nSeriously expensive\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nSamsung Galaxy S23 Ultra: Two-minute review\nThe Galaxy S23 Ultra offers up a familiar face that, at a glance, looks identical to its predecessor. The changes are there though, they're just not as big as those you'll find on the Galaxy S23 and S23 Plus. (You can read our Complete Samsung Galaxy S23 review and our thorough Samsung S23 Plus review for more on those two phones).\nA familiar squared design plays host to a tweaked display that offers a greater flat surface area, giving the S Pen stylus more room to work with. The front and back now sport the latest and most resilient Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and all the mod-cons from its predecessor \u2013 including IP68 dust and water resistance, and 45W wired charging \u2013 remain.\nSamsung has also worked to integrate more recycled materials into the phone's design, with the likes of recycled fishing nets going into the construction of the S Pen's inner cover and the speaker module, for example.\nSome elements \u2013 like the 6.8-inch 1Hz to 120Hz adaptive Dynamic AMOLED 2X display and the 5,000mAh battery \u2013 have received seemingly minor tweaks (greater color accuracy and 20% improved efficiency, in the case of the above examples, respectively).\nOn the inside, however, there are some bigger changes, like the new 'Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform for Galaxy' that Samsung and Qualcomm have collaborated on; purpose-built to offer rival-beating performance (51% better NPU performance, 41% better GPU performance and 33% greater CPU performance than previously, according to Samsung). The Ultra \u2013 along with the Galaxy S23 and Galaxy S23 Plus \u2013 is also one of the first phones out there to boast faster and more efficient LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.0 storage.\nA familiar-looking rear four-camera rear array hides a new 200MP lead sensor that offers 16-to-1 pixel-binning, with the aim of advancing the S23 Ultra's 'Nightography' abilities for everything from general snaps, to portrait photography, to videos of the night sky using the new Astro Hyperlapse mode and in practice, although imperfect, you'll be hard-pressed to find an alternative phone with the same level of consistency, quality and confidence across its various sensors.\nThose who want to shoot with greater control now also benefit from enhanced editing control too, with the ability to work with shots at up to 50MP captured in Expert RAW mode.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nYou still get a 12MP ultrawide and dual telephoto lenses at 3x and 10x (periscopic) zoom, respectively, granting the S23 Ultra the same degree of class-leading camera versatility offered up by the last couple of generations of Ultra.\nSamsung has also renewed its commitment to offering up to four years of OS updates and five years of security updates, across the Galaxy S23 series. All three arrive with One UI 5.1 atop Android 13, which folds in better collaborative working in Samsung Notes and an enhanced Privacy Dashboard, among other things.\nWhile the starting price (in the US, at least) remains consistent with the Galaxy S22 Ultra's base price, Samsung has doubled the entry-level storage to 256GB, while the top-tier model can be had with 12GB of RAM (up from 8GB on the base version) and a whopping 1TB of storage.\nFor a deeper dive, head on to the full in-depth review below, but know that, provided you're comfortable with the Ultra's high asking price, there's little to be disappointed by here.\nSamsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review: Price and availability\n- Starts at $1,199.99 / \u00a31,249 / AU$1,949\n- Same US starting price despite double the storage YoY\n- Top 1TB model is more expensive YoY across key markets\n| RAM / Storage | US price | UK price | AU price |\n| 8/256GB | $1,199.99 | \u00a31,249 | AU$1,949 |\n| 12/512GB | $1,379.99 | \u00a31,399 | AU$2,249 |\n| 12/1TB | $1,619.99 | \u00a31,599 | AU$2,649 |\nThe Galaxy S23 Ultra launched alongside its anticipated siblings \u2013 the standard Galaxy S23 and Galaxy S23 Plus \u2013 on February 1, with pre-order availability kicking off on the same day and running until February 16. The Galaxy S23 Ultra is available to buy as of Friday, February 17 (check out the best Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra deals in our dedicated article).\nOne of the nice fundamental upgrades over the Galaxy S22 Ultra is that base storage has been doubled to 256GB (or rather, there simply is no 128GB S23 Ultra), which benefits US customers in particular, as they're being asked to pay no more than they were for the base 128GB S22 Ultra, when it launched, at $1,199.99.\nThe 512GB model is $20 cheaper compared to its predecessor, at $1,379.99, while the top-tier Samsung.com-exclusive 1TB storage variant costs $20 more, at an eye-watering $1,619.99.\nThings are generally worse for UK customers when comparing to the S22 Ultra's pricing, with the baseline S23 Ultra costing the same as last year's 256GB model at \u00a31,249, while the 512GB and 1TB versions are \u00a370 and \u00a3100 more expensive each; at \u00a31,399 and \u00a31,599, respectively.\nCompared to the S22 Ultra, Australian customers pay AU$50 less than the 256GB S22 Ultra cost last year, at AU$1,949. The 512GB version, meanwhile, is AU$100 more this year, while the top 1TB S23 Ultra is AU$200 more, compared to the price of its 2022 predecessor.\nWhichever storage configuration you pick, being asked to pay a premium for Samsung's best shouldn't come as too much of a shock in a market that also plays host to the similarly-priced iPhone 14 Pro Max and a growing contingent of foldable phones that almost all comfortably push past the $1,000 / \u00a31,000 / AU$1,600 mark.\n- Value score: 3.5 / 5\nSamsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review: Specs\nThe Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra comes in three storage configurations, with 8GB of RAM in the base model and 12GB in the two higher storage models.\nSpecs otherwise remain consistent across all three variants.\n| Header Cell - Column 1 | |\n|---|---|\n| Dimensions: | 78.1 x 163.4 x 8.9mm |\n| Weight: | 234g |\n| Screen: | 6.8 inch 120Hz Dynamic AMOLED 2X |\n| Resolution: | 3088 x 1440 pixels |\n| CPU: | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform for Galaxy |\n| RAM: | 8GB / 12GB |\n| Storage: | 256GB / 512GB / 1TB |\n| OS: | Android 13 w/ One UI 5.1 |\n| Rear Cameras: | 200MP Wide, 12MP ultrawide, 10MP telephoto (3x), 10MP telephoto (10x) |\n| Front Camera: | 12MP |\n| Battery: | 5,000mAh |\n| Charging: | 45W (wired) + wireless & reverse wireless |\n| Colors: | Phantom Black, cream, green, lavender |\n| Samsung.com exclusive colors: | Sky Blue, graphite, lime, red |\nSamsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review: Design\n- Almost identical design to predecessor\n- Premium look, feel, and materials\n- Improved environmental credentials\nThe S22 Ultra was the first of Samsung's phones to truly fuse Galaxy S and Galaxy Note sensibilities together, and in doing so it shrugged off the contour-cut camera-led aesthetics of its predecessor and its launch siblings. Instead, it favored a cleaner and more squared form; partly as a means of further differentiating itself from the standard S22 and S22 Plus, but also in order to physically accommodate an integrated S Pen stylus.\nFor the S23 series, the standard and Plus models have played catch-up in the design department, while the S23 Ultra offers only subtle refinements that, to the eye, will be almost impossible to spot for those familiar with the S22 Ultra.\nThere's a similar pill-shaped top-down profile, with curved front and back glass feeding into a metal frame, although one change S22 Ultra users might notice when they pick up the S23 Ultra, is the reduced the radius of the curved edges of the display, giving you a greater flat surface area on which to use the integrated S Pen; a subtle but welcome tweak, functionally speaking.\nI'd argue this small change makes the phone harder to pick up off a flat surface but the difference is negligible. Its squared silhouette will be more divisive, however, making it trickier to pocket than the Galaxy S21 Ultra \u2013 with its rounded corners. It remains an undeniably good looking device that's becoming of its premium standing and promised power, though.\nWith launch S23 colors consistent across the whole range this year, you can pick the Ultra up in one of four finishes \u2013 Phantom Black, cream, green and lavender \u2013 in most places. As in previous years though, there are also a handful of colors exclusive to Samsung.com, including Sky Blue, Graphite, Lime and red (my personal favorite, offset against a black frame).\nWhile the cap of the S Pen matches the body color of your choosing, the rest of the stylus is black, regardless of your preferred finish.\nIn a not dissimilar fashion to the recent Hazel Google Pixel 7 Pro or the brand-new Eternal Green OnePlus 11, the green finish of the S23 Ultra review sample I've been testing is distinctly muted, particularly when viewed in artificial light. To some, this will come across as subtle and tasteful, to others it'll just look bland; so if you get the chance, try and get hands-on with your chosen finish before laying down any cash (assuming you don't plan on sticking it in one of the best Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra cases from the get-go).\nThe company's excellent efforts in durability persist too, with IP68-certified dust and water ingress protection, a resilient Armor Aluminum alloy frame and \u2013 for the first time on any phone, the latest Gorilla Glass Victus 2 \u2013 from Corning. It's a good thing too, as the rounded edges (even if they are slightly less rounded this year), paired with that smooth front and back, and the sheer size of the phone make it tricky to wield one-handed, especially when compared to its smaller, flat-fronted S23 siblings.\nFor all the advanced technology that Samsung has managed to pack into the S23 series, it's also tried to up the ante in terms of environmentally-friendly materials, with the Ultra being the real champion of this initiative. 80% of the deco film used in the construction of the phone's back is recycled, as is 22% of the glass used across its body, along with 20% of the S Pen's inner cover \u2013 reportedly hewn, in part, from ocean-bound polyamide.\nSamsung claims that other recycled materials that have been hammered into the shape of the S23 Ultra include discarded fishing nets, water barrels, PET bottles and pre-consumer recycled aluminum, which have contributed to the construction of components (12 in all \u2013 double that of the S22 Ultra) like the volume keys and SIM tray, speaker arrangement, 5G antenna arrangement and more.\nWhile Samsung isn't alone in working to improve the the green credentials of its phones (the iPhone comes to mind), this is certainly the most vocal we've seen the company about a particular handset in this regards and it represents a push that will hopefully catch on with rival phone makers going forward.\n- Design score: 4 / 5\nSamsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review: Display\n- Familiar display experience to predecessor\n- Promise of more accurate colors and better eye comfort viewing\n- Responsive S Pen stylus experience\nAside from that reduced curvature along its edges and greater protection thanks to that new Gorilla Glass Victus 2, the S23 Ultra's display offers a familiar viewing experience to its predecessor.\nAs on last year's Ultra, you get a 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X panel, with a resolution of 1440 x 3088 and a dynamic refresh rate that can scale between 1Hz and 120Hz, automatically shifting to prioritize power efficiency or visual fluidity as needed. By having the display rate displayed on-screen using developer options, I was able to see the screen switch between 24Hz, 48Hz, 60Hz and 120Hz, which is a wider array of frequencies than I've seen from any other Android phone boasting a dynamic refresh rate, supporting Samsung's claims of greater power efficiency this generation.\nSamsung's displays remain some of the nicest out there on mobile and the S23 Ultra's is no exception. Colors and visibility \u2013 even against strong ambient light \u2013 are great, with viewing angles showing minimal brightness drop-off and a nice consistency to colors. In fact, Samsung has apparently tuned the display to serve up more accurate colors against a wider array of ambient lighting scenarios this time around (three, to be precise), with what it calls its Advanced Vision Booster; adjusting tone and color as needed.\nMax brightness still doesn't compare to the iPhone 14 Pro's impressive 2,000 nit peak (the S23 range all tops out at 1,750 nits), but in real-world viewing, movies, games and other visuals look exceptional. Meanwhile, Samsung isn't making any new claims of further-reduced S Pen latency or additional Air Gesture functionality this time around, but it's already impressively responsive (Wacom-supported tech that allows for 2.8ms latency) and the user experience has been augmented in other ways that appeal to productivity.\n- Display score: 4.5 / 5\nSamsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review: Camera\n- First Samsung phone with a 200MP sensor\n- Improved 'Nightography' experience for stills, portrait and video\n- Integrated Expert RAW shooting now supports up to 50MP\nCameras are one area where the Ultra has always stood out when looking at the best Samsung phones available and the multi-sensor setup that the company's been using for the last few generations has consistently ensured that these devices find a place up at or near the top of our best camera phones roundup year after year.\nWhile the 12MP ultrawide and dual 3x and 10x 10MP telephoto sensors on the back of the S23 Ultra feel decidedly familiar, the phone shrugs off the primary 108MP resolution sensor seen on previous entries in the series and replaces it \u2013 for the first time on a Samsung phone \u2013 with a whopping 200MP primary camera; thought to be the ISOCELL HP2 that TechRadar's cameras editor, Tim Coleman, dived into a few days prior to the S23 series' launch.\nSuch a change in hardware can sometimes result in a drop in quality for some manufacturers; with their camera teams needing time to retune their algorithms and color science to get the best from the new components (something that's happened with the likes of OnePlus in the past). But much as with Google's move to a new 50MP primary sensor on its Pixel 6 series and Apple's shift from a 12MP to a 48MP primary sensor the year after, with the iPhone 14 Pro line, it's clear that Samsung's camera team has ensured that the output from the S23 Ultra's new 200MP Adaptive Pixel Sensor offers just as consistent and impressive an experience as its predecessor, right out of the gate.\nSamsung Galaxy S23 Ultra camera samples\nGalaxy S23 Ultra (top) | Google Pixel 7 Pro (bottom)\nS23 Ultra's zoom range (0.6x to 100x) compared to the Pixel 7 Pro's (0.5x to 30x).\nThe versatility of the S23 Ultra's camera is bolstered by its outstanding stabilization and impressive post-processing, retaining exceptional detail and color consistency across its entire zoom range in well-lit scenarios.\nThe S23 Ultra seems to default to matrix metering when using the standard photo mode, which usually yields great results but in higher contrast scenarios can lead to under or over-exposure of your subject (as seen in the 10x and 100x samples above).\nPixel 7 Pro (left) | Galaxy S23 Ultra (center) | iPhone 14 Pro Max (right)\nIn very dark environments, the S23 Ultra handles night mode shooting very differently to its lead rivals, bring exposure up, revealing more in the darker areas of a scene, but sometimes at the expense of color accuracy and fine detail.\nSamsung's efforts in 'nightography' aren't just hyperbole, it's a phenomenal phone for low-light shooting, even if results are a little stylized. What's more impressive is that it can deliver across the whole zoom range, especially up to its optical zoom ceiling of 10x.\nWhile the previous samples with shot with the standard Photo mode, the above were taken using Night mode and highlight that the feature is best used in more extreme conditions with less light to work with, as the telephoto sensors in particular suffer from a green tinge and more noise here.\nSure, it may be little more than a party trick, but being able to capture a shot of the moon \u2013 from the Sea of Tranquility (top center) to the Tycho Crater (bottom right) \u2013 like this on a smartphone, always feels like magic.\nPixel 7 Pro (left) | Galaxy S23 Ultra (center) | iPhone 14 Pro Max (right)\nNotice the color difference in the sky between the S23 Ultra and its biggest rivals at their respective maximum optical zoom ranges (5x, 10x and 3x).\nPixel 7 Pro (left) | Galaxy S23 Ultra (right)\nWhile both phones capture color beautifully, opt for the S23 Ultra if you like your colors and contrast with a little more pop, as standard.\nThe (presumed) matrix metering mentioned earlier not only affects exposure, but color reproduction across the phone's various rear sensors. Notice how washed out the 10x zoom sample (left) looks, compared to the same section of the building at short focal lengths.\nPixel 7 Pro (left) | Galaxy S23 Ultra (center) | iPhone 14 Pro Max (right)\nAll three phones offer impressive detail capture at their maximum optical zoom ranges, however, in this example the Pixel's handling of dynamic range offers up greater detail in the darkest areas of frame.\nGalaxy S23 Ultra (top) | Pixel 7 Pro (bottom)\nBoth the Ultra and the Pixel serve up a pleasing portrait photography at multiple focal lengths, with a nice level of bokeh and robust edge detection around the subject in both instances. The Pixel's blur looks more natural by default but both phones let you adjust the amount of blur and area of focus after the fact, which is really powerful.\nWhile there's a degree of consistency \u2013 in terms of dynamic range across the S23 Ultra's zoom range in low light \u2013 the 3x sensor processed colors differently and the primary 200MP sensor used all that additional image data to quash noise far better than any other camera on the phone's back.\nSamsung's bias for 'pop' means blacks along the cat's flank in this portrait shot are completely crushed; a scenario where shooting in Expert RAW might have been prudent.\nMain...\n...ultrawide.\nBy default, the S23 Ultra's main camera pixel bins images by 16 to 1, down to 12.5MP (output as 12MP stills) that use all that additional pixel data to iron out image shake, while also taking in more light and retaining more color information. Speaking of which, low light photography is a big area of focus for the camera experience on this Ultra; with the promise of enhanced night shots across the board \u2013 including portraits \u2013 as well as a new astrophotography hyperlapse video mode.\nStabilization across stills and video has been improved too, with double the angle of movement now possible in the OIS (optical image stabilization) system, compared to last year's S22 Ultra (3-degrees on the S23 Ultra), along with improved VDIS (video digital image stabilization) and faster autofocus from the 'Super Quad Pixel' sensor, as Samsung has branded it.\nFor users who want to get more granular with the Ultra's photography experience, the Expert RAW mode \u2013 integrated into the camera UI \u2013 now supports an output of up to 50MP, rather than 12MP previously. The Ultra also lets you snap 200MP stills (as jpegs), if you want to play with the full sensor's available detail.\nOriginal image (left) | Raw file w/ EV+3 (center) | Jpeg w/ EV+3 (right)\nYou can see just how much more image data and fidelity is preserved when adjusting a raw and a jpeg of the same image to the same exaggerated exposure value.\nIn practice, while shooting in raw allows for greater fidelity and significantly more robust editing \u2013 letting you pull more data out of the darkest or lightest parts of an image \u2013 the S23 Ultra seems to consistently under expose in Expert RAW and results all come with a graded profile as standard, rather than a neutral image.\nIn the pursuit of switching up sensors, all three of the S23 series also gain a new 12MP front-facing snapper this generation, set into the display (Samsung hasn't yet been bold enough to import the Z Fold series' under display camera), which holds promise and brings more consistency to the experience of owning an S23, regardless of model.\nSamsung brands the S23 series' camera as its first 'Super HDR selfie camera'.\nPixel 7 Pro (left) | Galaxy S23 Ultra (center) | iPhone 14 Pro Max (right)\nAnecdotally, the 12MP front-facer feels like a faster sensor than the one found on its predecessor, offering up a nice overall image with impressive dynamic range, as selfie snappers go.\nIn side-by side selfie tests with the Google Pixel 7 Pro and the iPhone 14 Pro Max, the S23 Ultra most closely matches Apple's flagship and offers a surprisingly (for Samsung) natural-looking final image, with impressive detail and what often came across as pleasing, more natural skin tones than the Pixel, which was uncharacteristically out of step against both Samsung's and Apple's phones in testing.\nSamsung also continues to work closely with big social brands like Snap, TikTok and Instagram to ensure phones like the S23 Ultra benefit from higher fidelity image and video quality, as well as tighter integration with creative features within each social app, something rival Android phone makers miss out on.\n- Camera score: 4.5 / 5\nSamsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review: Performance\n- Custom flagship-class chipset offers exceptional performance\n- Faster and more efficient memory and storage than many rivals\n- Performance gains over standard 8 Gen 2 are negligible\nIt's not really a secret that Samsung has connections in high places, building Wear OS 3 with Google and having co-developed the last few generations of its own flagship chips in conjunction with Qualcomm, but that partnership has matured into something exceptional for 2023.\nWhereas previously, users in different markets could expect Galaxy S devices powered by either Samsung Exynos or Qualcomm Snapdragon silicon, the Galaxy S23 series gains Qualcomm's latest and greatest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip worldwide.\nThis eliminates performance discrepancies that previously left users of Exynos-powered Galaxy S phones feeling behind the curve and also helps with aspects like camera processing (thanks to the use of the same ISP across regions) and battery life consistency.\nNot only has the 8 Gen 2 already shown its capabilities (our OnePlus 11 review already offers first-hand insight into how the chip performs) but Samsung has managed to gain access to an exclusive tuned variant of the SoC, dubbed the 'Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform for Galaxy'. In a nutshell, the prime Cortex-X3 core inside the chipset has been overclocked to 3.36GHz (rather than 3.2GHz, as is standard); without compromising efficiency or battery longevity.\nAs Samsung's Nick Porter pointed out during a one-on-one interview with TechRadar ahead of the phone's launch, the vapor chamber is \"2.7x bigger on average across the whole S23 series\" this year, helping with thermal efficiency, while the use of faster and more efficient LPDDR5X memory and UFS 4.0 storage, lend themselves to greater performance and quality of life too.\nIn testing, artificial benchmarks reveal what I suspected ahead of time: the S23 Ultra gains a slight edge over the OnePlus 11 \u2013 with its similar-but-technically-lesser chip \u2013 based on the numbers, but the Ultra's lead is so slight that you're unlikely to feel any real-world benefit. As such, that higher prime-core clock speed is far more beneficial for Samsung Galaxy S23 series marketing campaign than it is the end user, but regardless you're getting one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful phone on the market.\nIn real-world use, the pairing of the new chipset, RAM and storage collectively deliver performance that \u2013 as you'd hope for a device with the S23 Ultra's standing and price tag \u2013 feels rock-solid. The most demanding task the Ultra faced during review was running the graphically demanding game Genshin Impact, with settings intentionally set to their upmost limits. Everything ran smoothly for the 20 minutes of play time, but the phone did get noticeably hot, to the point where I'd suggest sticking with the title's default settings (at which it still looks and runs fantastically).\n- Performance score: 4.5 / 5\nSamsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review: Battery\n- Up to 45W wired charging\n- 15W wireless and 4.5W reverse wireless charging\n- Same capacity battery as S22 Ultra, but 20% improved efficiency\nThe battery specs read the same as the S22 Ultra, with a 5,000mAh cell inside the S23 Ultra supporting 45W wired charging (along with wireless and reverse wireless charging), however, Samsung claims that the collective effect of the new hardware efficiencies and tighter integration between hardware and software result in a 20% improvement that Porter claims delivers \"the longest ever battery life on a Galaxy S smartphone;\" and I'd be inclined to agree.\nWhile the 100W charging speeds of OnePlus 11 and 125W speeds of the Motorola Edge 30 Ultra both leave the S23 Ultra in the dust, actual longevity on Samsung's new uber-flagship is greatly improved, despite the phone having the same-capacity battery as its predecessor.\nWhat was a one-day phone at best now lasts a day and a half, in normal usage and will still see you through a full day, even if you plan on streaming Disney Plus with brightness pushed up or want to dive into an hour of CoD: Mobile or Wreckfest.\nIn testing, the S23 also delivered some of the longest screen-on time per charge of any phone we've tested recently, at approximately eight hours; surpassing rival devices with similarly-capacious batteries by at least half an hour.\n- Battery score: 4.5 / 5\nSamsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review: Software\n- Android 13 w/ One UI 5.1\n- Four years OS & five years security updates\n- Customizable and well-featured\nSamsung is class-leading, when it comes to making the best Android phones for update support, promising four years of OS updates and five years of security updates across the Galaxy S23 series; with all three devices running on the latest Android 13 \u2013 dressed in the company's own One UI 5.1 \u2013 out of the box.\nIt should feel like a familiar experience for existing Samsung Galaxy owners, with squircle icons and a generally flat graphical style as standard, dressed with a few new additions that appear to focus on collaboration, convenience and security.\nSamsung Notes now allows for simultaneous creators to work within a single document collaboratively, routines and modes can be set to suit different scenarios \u2013 adjusting settings accordingly and an upgraded privacy dashboard should dispel ambiguity around how secure your device is.\nAir Command and Air Gestures remain in place as part of the S Pen experience, offering the ability to control the camera, translate text and cut and paste on-screen content instantly, with simple stylus-driven actions, although camera controls in particular take a little getting used to.\nWhile One UI won't be to everyone's tastes, it's unique, fairly customizable and displays a level of polish that's evident from initial setup to everyday use, and which you'll be hard-pressed to find elsewhere. Want to scan a QR code to connect to Wi-Fi during setup, instead of having to type out your password? Done. Want your device to auto-restart when it senses performance degradation? There's a toggle for that. Want to run two instances of the same messaging app logged into different accounts simultaneously? There's an option for that too.\n- Software score: 4.5 / 5\nShould you buy the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra?\n| Attributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\n| Value | Despite double the base storage, it's more expensive that its predecessor in most markets and the S22 Ultra was already a pricey phone | 3.5 / 5 |\n| Design | Almost identical to the S22 Ultra's square form, with ergonomic changes that, while appreciated, don't make it any more pocketable | 4 / 5 |\n| Display | A stunning display with even greater color accuracy than previously | 4.5 / 5 |\n| Camera | Iconic Ultra versatility with a new sensor that improves low light shooting | 4.5 / 5 |\n| Performance | The best-performing Android phone on the market, if not the best-performing phone outright | 4.5 / 5 |\n| Battery | Efficiency improvements deliver far greater battery life and the same charging experience as before | 4.5 / 5 |\n| Software | Customisable, polished and plenty of updates in the long-term | 4.5 / 5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou want the best Android phone out there\nThere's little the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra doesn't do and do well by modern smartphone standards. It has everything you could need, plus a few extras.\nYou want one of the best camera phones on the market\nConsistency is hard to achieve between camera sensors and the S23 Ultra does a great job of offering a persistent photographic experience, while also embracing a new sensor and improving low light performance.\nYou need as much power as possible\nWhether for gaming, multitasking or some other productivity use case, the Galaxy S23 Ultra offers some of the most potent hardware currently available on a smartphone, only really contested by Apple's iPhone 14 Pro series, but like for like comparisons get tricky between the two, when it comes to comparing performance; Apples to oranges, if you will.\nDon't buy it if...\nMoney is a concern\nUltras are marketed as the best of the best, but that comes at a high cost and year on year the S23 Ultra is even pricier than its predecessor in a lot of markets.\nYou don't like big phones\nIt's not just big, the squared silhouette of the S23 Ultra means it's especially poorly suited to pockets. One-handed use is also a challenge.\nYou hate One UI\nSamsung's take on Android won't be for everyone; with its own fonts, additional features and distinct aesthetic. While there's a degree of customization on offer and you can use third-party launchers to mask parts of the user experience, you won't be able to hide the Samsung-specific touches outright.\nSamsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review: Also consider\nThe Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is Samsung's statement piece for this point in the year and it's one that's hard to ignore but if you're after a class-leading phone that doesn't come from the South Korean tech giant for one reason or another, here are a handful of alternatives.\nWhile there was never any question that Samsung would be offering up a new Ultra for 2023, there was nothing inherently wrong with its predecessor, and aside from running on the previous year's internals and a lower resolution primary camera, you're getting a very similar experience from a device with a year's worth of price reductions under its belt worth considering.\nIf you're after a large-screened flagship phone with class-leading performance and a capable camera setup that isn't the Galaxy S23 Ultra, Apple will accept a similar amount of money for their latest top dog.\nIf Samsung's take on Android simply isn't for you, or you want a similar experience in a different design, Google's Pixel 7 Pro offers an equally stunning screen, a compelling camera with a 5x optical zoom and a custom-built flagship chipset, tailor-made for sorts of AI-based workloads that we're seeing more and more of.\n| Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra | Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max | Google Pixel 7 Pro | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Price (from): | $1,199.99 / \u00a31,149 / AU$1,849 | $1,099 / \u00a31,199 / AU$1,899 | $899 / \u00a3849 / AU$1,299 |\n| Dimensions: | 163.3 x 77.9 x 8.9mm | 160.7 x 77.6 x 7.85mm | 162.9 x 76.6 x 8.9 mm |\n| Weight: | 229g | 240g | 212g |\n| OS (at launch): | Android 12 | iOS 16 | Android 13 |\n| Screen Size: | 6.8-inch | 6.7-inch | 6.7-inch |\n| Resolution: | 3088x1440 | 2796 x1290 | 3120x1440 |\n| CPU: | Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 / Exynos 2200 | A16 Bionic | Tensor G2 |\n| RAM: | 8 / 12GB | 6GB (est) | 12GB |\n| Storage (from): | 128GB | 128GB | 128GB |\n| Battery: | 5,000mAh | 3,200mAh | 5,000mAh |\n| Rear Cameras: | 108MP Wide, 12MP ultrawide, 10MP telephoto (3x), 10MP telephoto (10x) | 48MP wide (24mm f/2.8), 12MP ultra-wide (13mm f/2.2). 12MP telephoto (77mm f/2.8) | 50MP main, 48MP 5x zoom, 12MP ultra-wide macro |\n| Front camera: | 40MP | 12MP | 10MP |\nHow I tested the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra\n- Review test period = 11 days\n- Testing included = Everyday usage, web browsing, social media, photography, video calling, gaming\n- Tools used = Geekbench 5, Geekbench ML, GFXBench, native Android stats\nI lived with the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra as my primary device for over a week and a half, using it for everything from making and taking calls, to photo and video capture, scrolling through social media, playing music, gaming and even to jot down the occasional note.\nThat killer display lent itself exceptionally well to watching episodes of Dropout's Dimension 20 on my morning and evening commute, and pairing it with the phone's class-leading performance allowed for some fast-paced sessions of Apex Legends Mobile, without me ever feeling like I was waiting for the phone to catch up.\nWhile I value real-world feel and performance above all else, sometimes it's easier to quantify elements of a device to better assess manufacturers' claims of performance, power or aptitude.\nWith most phones, I use Geekbench 5 for CPU testing (the S23 Ultra landed the highest scores of any Android phone we've tested to date), Geekbench ML for machine learning and AI benchmarking (using NNAPI, for those curious) and GFXBench's selection of on-screen tests, with the display set to its highest supported refresh rate and resolution, to stretch the GPU. Battery life was assessed based on real-world usage, with Android natively including screen-on time as one additional useful metrics.\nI bring 12 years of industry experience to my role as Senior Phones Editor here at TechRadar. With a focus on phones, tablets and wearables in the consumer space, I'm well versed in what the market has to offer and how to assess a device like the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, and how it fits into the landscape of that market, as well as how well it does, or doesn\u2019t suit the needs (and the budgets) of typical users\nNote: the iPhone 14 Pro Max used for camera comparison in this review was supplied by Vodafone UK, who offer the phone up from \u00a357 per month, with a \u00a349 upfront cost, on a 36-month Phone Plan, with a 24-month 25GB Airtime Plan.\nFirst reviewed February 2023\nAlex joined as TechRadar's Senior Phones Editor in June 2022, but brings over a decade's worth of experience to the role, with an expertise in smartphones, tablets and wearables. He's covered keynotes hosted by the biggest brands and attended the launches for some of the most influential mobile products of the last few years. His experience was amassed at some of the most reputable consumer technology publications out there, including GSMArena, TechAdvisor and Trusted Reviews."

      "text": "PSA: the Galaxy S25 Edge is free at every major carrier right now with a trade-in\nAnd a plan, of course\nThere's a brand new Samsung flagship in town, and as expected, the major carriers are out in force looking to tempt prospective customers into the upgrade.\nVerizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile all have major trade-in rebates on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge right now with massive discounts of up to $1,099, which conveniently is enough to cover the entire cost of the device.\nI've posted all these promos below in no particular order. All three are fantastic deals, but they follow the usual pattern. You'll likely need to trade in a relatively decent phone to get the full rebate, and all require a new line on an unlimited data plan.\nSome of these plans can be very, very pricey over a two or three-year duration, so lining up a trade-in is absolutely crucial if you're looking to get your hands on the Edge cheap. If you want to skip the plan, Samsung's current deal is a great option for an unlocked device. I've attached more details on this promo below, alongside a quick overview of our thoughts on the device.\nGet the Samsung Galaxy S25 for free with a trade\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge: free with a trade-in and unlimited plan at Verizon\nVerizon's opening Galaxy S25 Edge deal is relatively standard for the carrier. You'll have to trade in an old device to get a discount on this shiny new flagship, and naturally, you'll need a line on an unlimited plan, too. With that said, the maximum rebate of up to $1,099 that covers the entire cost of the device is a little better than the usual $1,000 off we see from the major carriers.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge: free with a trade-in and unlimited plan at T-Mobile\nT-Mobile has a wide range of Galaxy S25 Edge deals today offering multiple options for saving on the device. First up, the biggest saving is via a trade-in and a new line on the Experience Beyond plan, which can potentially get you the device for free. If you're not eligible for that, then you can still get up to $600 off without a trade-in on most of the unlimited plans with a new line.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge: free with a trade-in and unlimited plan at AT&T\nAnother great trade-in focused Galaxy S25 Edge deal today, AT&T's current promo will get you the device for free with a line on an eligible unlimited plan. Note there are a few other great bonus deals to check out at AT&T today that stack with the trade-in - namely a $800 bonus for switching or a $200 bonus for ordering a device online.\nAlso highly recommended today...\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge: up to $620 off with a trade, free storage upgrade, and $50 credit at Samsung\nTechRadar readers can get $50 in added store credit at the official Samsung Store this week thanks to an exclusive promotion. This handy bonus stacks on top of the excellent trade-in rebate of up to $620 off and a free storage upgrade for a massive total savings of $800. Note that if you've already reserved a device, you may not be able to claim our exclusive bonus in addition to that $50 credit.\nIs the Galaxy S25 Edge worth buying?\nWe managed to spend some time with the device during our Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge hands-on session this week, and our initial impressions are positive. The device doesn't add much apart from an incredibly slim design, but we think it's the best looking phone of the year so far.\nA few compromises have been made to fit everything into the device's incredibly svelte 5.8 mm-thick chassis like the lack of a telephoto lens and a slightly smaller battery, but it's otherwise just as powerful and just as advanced as the other devices in the S25 range. Subsequently, it's a great choice for any Android user who wants good cameras, plenty of power, and various AI features wrapped up in a premium design.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAlex is TechRadar's deals editor, specializing in getting our readers the best bang for the buck on the tech that we know and love.

      "text": "Both the iPhone 16 Pro Max and Galaxy S25 Ultra are free with a new line at Verizon right now \u2013 no trade needed, either\nSome of the best Verizon deals of the entire year are available today\nWhile all eyes are on this weekend's 4th of July sales and early Prime Day deals, other retailers are also offering some superb promotions. Over at Verizon, for example, the carrier has some of the best deals we've seen all year on the iPhone 16 Pro Max and Galaxy S25 Ultra. You can bag either of these high-end devices for free alongside a new line on an Ultimate unlimited plan today for a total saving of $1,200.\nWhile the 'Ultimate' plan is the most premium (and priciest) plan at Verizon, you don't technically need to trade in at all to get these devices on the house. That's incredibly impressive considering how much either device still fetches when you pay upfront.\nNote, if you're looking for a lower-end plan, then you'll also find similar deals on the iPhone 16 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S25 with more reasonable eligibility criteria. All devices are also available with a free tablet and smartwatch as bonus gifts, although note that you will need to pay a little extra per month to claim them, so budget accordingly!\nToday's best phone deals at Verizon\nApple iPhone 16 Pro Max: free with an unlimited plan, plus free iPad and Apple Watch at Verizon\nVerizon has just brought back one of its best deals ever on the stunning high-end iPhone 16 Pro Max. Right now, you don't even need a trade-in to get the device for free alongside a new line on an Unlimited Ultimate plan. While the plan here is a very pricey option, you're still getting a massive $1,200 off the phone itself, so this could be a good option overall. In addition to the phone, Verizon is also throwing in a free iPad and Apple Watch right now, although note that accessory cellular lines are paid separately.\nApple iPhone 16 Pro: free with a new unlimited line, plus free iPad and Apple Watch at Verizon\nVerizon's deal on the iPhone 16 Pro is a little more accessible than that on the 16 Pro Max right now, since the carrier is offering it for free alongside any unlimited plan, not just the super high-end Ultimate plan. You can technically get up to four devices for free here on the basic Welcome plan, which would come out at just $30/mo per line without any trades needed. In addition, you can also throw in a free iPad and Apple Watch if you're happy to pay for accessory cellular lines.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: free with an unlimited data plan, plus free tablet and smartwatch at Verizon\nPrefer Android devices? This week's Verizon deals also include a superb option on the latest Galaxy S25 Ultra. Like with the iPhone 16 Pro Max, it's possible to get this premium device for free without a trade-in if you pair it up with a new line on the Ultimate unlimited plan. You can also throw in a free Galaxy Watch 7 and Galaxy Tab S9 FE tablet as bonus gifts, although note that you will need to spend a little extra per month for accessory cellular lines.\nSamsung Galaxy S25: free with an unlimited plan at Verizon\nIf you're looking for something more accessible, Verizon's deal on the Galaxy S25 is a great choice this week. You can pair up this device with any of the carrier's unlimited plans, including the cheaper Plus and Welcome options, and get the device for free. As of writing, this device is still worth $800, so today's deal is a significant discount even if the postpaid unlimited plans are pretty pricey.\nMore of today's 4th of July and early Prime Day sales\n- Amazon: early Prime Day deals on devices, TVs, more\n- Best Buy: 50% off major appliances, plus coupons\n- Dell: up to $490 off laptops, desktops, and gaming PCs\n- Home Depot: 40% off appliances, grills, and summer essentials\n- HP: up to 57% off laptops and PCs for work and gaming\n- Newegg: up to $1,000 off PCs, laptops, components, peripherals\n- NordVPN: $50 Amazon Gift Card + 4 months free on two-year plans\n- Lowes: discounts on grills, tools, appliances, and more\n- Samsung: up to $1,850 off major appliances, phones, and TVs\n- Walmart: decor, fashion, and party supplies from $1\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAlex is TechRadar's deals editor, specializing in getting our readers the best bang for the buck on the tech that we know and love.

      "text": "The best cell phone deals for August 2025\niPhones, Samsung, and Google - it's all rounded up right here\nLooking for a shiny new device? You won't have top pay full with our handy roundup of this week's best cell phone deals. Just below you can find a comprehensive list of all the best savings for both carrier and unlocked devices on models that we've tested (and loved) here at TechRadar. Regardless of whether you're a fan of iPhones or more partial to a Samsung device, you'll easily be able to compare all your options right here.\nJump to the section that's relevant for you:\n1. Carrier phone deals\n2. Unlocked phone deals\n3. Specific pages for more phone deals\n4. Phone deal tips\nGenerally speaking, you'll find cell phone deals coming in two forms - first as an outright sale on an unlocked device, and secondly as part of a carrier-plan tie-in. The latter can be a bit tricky, involving new cell phone plans and also trade-ins on old devices, but the savings can be absolutely huge if you're eligible. We've also seen many carriers throw in freebies alongside their deals recently as an extra incentive to sign up for those plans.\nWhich type of cell phone deal should you go for? Well, that will depend on your personal needs. If you're looking for the latest flagship device and an unlimited plan to pair it up with then you'll find great options at carriers like Verizon and AT&T. If you're looking for maximum flexibility or long-term savings, then it's generally better to consider either buying a device unlocked and then weighing up your plan options separately. This isn't a bad idea since there are a number of great prepaid plans on the market right now and there are often bring-your-own-device savings at the major carriers, too.\nNote, all of the devices featured on our list have been personally reviewed by the staff here at TechRadar. They're all fantastic picks in their own right and you won't find any sub-par choices included. If you'd like to find out which is best for you we'd recommend checking our updated guide to the best phones for 2025.\nToday's best cell phone deals at a glance\n- Samsung Galaxy Z series: up to $1,100 off at T-Mobile\n- iPhone 16 Pro Max: free with a new unlimited data line at Verizon\n- iPhone 16 series: up to $1,000 off with a trade and plan at T-Mobile\n- iPhone 16 series: up to $1,000 off with a trade-in and plan at AT&T\n- Galaxy S25 Ultra: free with a new unlimited line at Verizon\n- Galaxy S25 Edge: free with a trade-in and unlimited plan at AT&T\n- Galaxy S25 series: $580 off with a trade, or $200 off upfront at Samsung\n- Pixel 9: now $399, plus a year of unlimited data for $15/mo at Mint Mobile\n- Apple trade-in: save up to $600 on a new iPhone with a trade\nCarrier phone deals\nNew Samsung Galaxy Z series: up to $1,100 off, plus a free storage upgrade at T-Mobile\nNew and old customers alike can get massive discounts on both the new Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 today at T-Mobile. For a limited time, you'll be able to trade-in a device alongside a new line on either a Go5G Plus or Experience unlimited plan to get a huge discount of up to $1,100 off. Not looking to trade? New customers can instead get up to $800 off when they switch over to T-Mobile this week.\nNew Samsung Galaxy Z series: buy-one-get-one with an unlimited plan at Verizon\nVerizon's opening promotion offers something a little different to customers this week. The carrier brought back an old favorite - a buy-one-get-one free promotion that's perfect for multi-line users. If that doesn't float your boat, then you can instead trade in for a massive rebate of up to $1,100 off - enough to cover the entire cost of the Flip 7.\nNew Samsung Galaxy Z series: up to $1,100 off with a trade-in and unlimited plan at AT&T\nAT&T's also offering an excellent trade-in rebate of up to $1,100 off this week - a significant discount that's enough to get a Flip 7 for free alongside an unlimited plan. If you order online, you'll also get an additional $200 in credit that you can use to cut the cost of your plan down by just over $5 per month.\nApple iPhone 16 Pro Max: free with a new unlimited data line at Verizon\nVerizon's headline deal on the iPhone 16 series is this excellent promotion on the iPhone 16 Pro Max. This device, which is still valued at $1,200, is currently available for free without a trade-in with a new line on an Ultimate plan. While the Ultimate plan is the highest-end plan, and subsequently the priciest, this is one of the rare occasions you've been able to get this premium device for free without the usual trade-in criteria.\nApple iPhone 16 series: get up to $1,000 off with a trade-in and unlimited plan at T-Mobile\nT-Mobile's headline deal on the latest iPhone 16 series is a massive trade-in rebate of up to $1,000 - a rebate that's technically enough to cover the entire cost of the iPhone 16 Pro. To be eligible for the biggest discount here, you'll need a line on the Go5G Next plan, which is unfortunately the priciest plan of them all at T-Mobile. You can, however, get a rebate of up to $830 off on one of the cheaper plans, which is enough to cover the cost of the standard iPhone 16.\nApple iPhone 16 series: up to $1,000 off with a trade-in at AT&T\nIf you're looking for the biggest-possible saving on one of the latest iPhones at AT&T you'll find a massive trade-in rebate of up to $1,000 across several devices in the range. That's enough to get the iPhone 16 Pro (which would be my recommendation) for free alongside any of the carrier's unlimited plans. Note, if you're looking to skip the trade-in, then you can instead opt for the brand-new iPhone 16e for just $5.99 per month right now without the need for a trade.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: free with a new unlimited line at Verizon\nVerizon's current deal on the Galaxy S25 Ultra is easily a match for the best we've ever seen on the flagship. As with the iPhone 16 Pro Max, no trade-ins are currently needed to get this device for free alongside a new line on an Ultimate unlimited plan. While that's a pricey plan, it's very rare to see the device for free without a trade-in required so it's definitely worth considering this week.\nGoogle Pixel 9: was $799 now $399, plus a year of unlimited data for $15/mo at Mint Mobile\nLooking for a cheap flagship and plan combo? Mint Mobile's current deal on the Google Pixel 9 is offering a massive $400 price cut on this device for new customers. On top of that, the prepaid carrier is also throwing in one full year of unlimited data for just $15 per month - that's half-price of what you'd usually pay. Overall, this is a fantastic deal - only slightly overshadowed by the fact the carrier was offering the device for $299 under the same terms this Black Friday just past. Overall, however, this is still an amazing deal.\nApple iPhone 16 Pro: device, plus unlimited plan for $65/mo at Boost Mobile\nLooking for a cheap way to bundle in your shiny new iPhone alongside an unlimited data plan. Boost Mobile's Infinite Access for iPhone plan throws in an iPhone 16 alongside an unlimited data plan for as little as $65/mo. Similar discounts are available across the other three devices in the range and you'll also be eligible for a free device upgrade down the line when the time comes. Overall, a great deal but note that the unlimited plan here isn't likely to be as speedy as those offered at the major carriers and more limited in terms of perks.\nAT&T online special: get $200 bill credits with new line and phone at AT&T\nThis particular deal was originally debuted during the Holiday season but it looks like it's becoming a semi-permanent fixture over at AT&T. Right now, you can get a decent $200 discount on your monthly bills if you pick up a new phone and line at the carrier. Considering this stacks with the various other trade-in deals available across nearly every device, it's a very nice bonus that should be applicable to a lot of customers this month.\n- Verizon - has a whole section of their site dedicated to phone deals\n- AT&T - also offers a huge range of phone deals\n- Sprint - currently offering free phones and other great phone deals\nIf you don't mind switching carriers, you can find many of the best smartphone deals from the big four. The major carriers will often let you split the cost of the phone into monthly payments anywhere from 18 to 30 months, and sometimes longer. The deals they offer frequently cut the price of the phone in half, sometimes even offering the phone for free.\nTo get these deals, you'll generally need to be adding a new line and signing up for a specific mobile plan. But, as long as you're planning to get an unlimited data plan anyway, they can make it a lot more affordable to pick up a brand new phone.\nIf you'd like to deep dive into specific carriers, we've got some great content for you in the form of our Verizon deals and AT&T deals pages. There you'll find a full list of what's available, including discounts on plans and even free phones.\nUnlocked cell phone deals\nSamsung Galaxy S25 series: $580 instant trade-in credit, or up to $200 off upfront at Samsung\nThe official Samsung store usually has great deals for the Galaxy S25 series and this week's no exception. Right now, you can either get a $580 trade-in rebate or just an upfront $200 discount. The rebate isn't one of the best we've seen from the official site (it's been up to $800 off before) but the upfront discount is really good and well worth checking out.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge: up to $580 off with a trade-in, or $100 off upfront at Samsung\nIf you're interested in the new Galaxy S25 Edge, you can get yourself a nice little upfront discount this week as an alternative to the usual trade-in rebate. Considering we saw rebates reaching all the way up to $1,000 at release, I'd say the upfront discount is definitely the stronger deal here.\nAmazon has discounted the excellent Pixel 9 Pro to just $799 this week, bringing the phone to just shy of its lowest-ever price (it crashed to $749 earlier this year). That figure refers to the 128GB model, but the retailer is also offering similar savings on the 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB models. With a full $200 off, this is one very strong option if you're looking to buy one of the latest flagships upfront rather than trading in.\nApple iPhone 16 series: save up to $650 off with a trade-in at Apple\nApple's current iPhone 16 deal is... well, it's typical Apple, with a maximum trade-in rebate of up to $650 off. This is the exact rebate it's been offering across all devices recently so it's not a ground-breaking deal by any stretch of the imagination. It is, however, a pretty good discount overall and the sole option right now if you want to skip the pricey unlimited plan at one of the major carriers.\nApple refurb program: save up to $310 on a refurbished iPhone\nLooking for an iPhone and don't mind getting an older model? The official Apple certified refurbished store is a great choice for upfront discounts. Yep, these devices are 'pre-loved' but Apple itself has serviced them itself and with official parts. Apple has just re-stocked its store pages with the freshly discontinued iPhone 12 series so it's a great time to check out a refurbed iOS device.\n- Apple - offers upfront discounts on unlocked phone deals with trade-ins\n- Samsung - save up to $500 on select phone deals with trade-ins\n- Amazon - has a vast selection of unlocked phone deals on a range of brands\n- Best Buy - also an excellent place to find unlocked phone deals\n- OnePlus - price cuts, trade-in rebates, and freebies with own-brand devices\nDeals on unlocked smartphones aren't always the most eye-popping, as they tend to offer only small cuts to the retail price. Occasionally you'll find a major deal on a new smartphone, usually late into the one-year refresh cycle for that brand. We've seen this kind of price drop commonly for Samsung flagships, but they aren't frequent and rarely match the up-front discounts carriers offer.\nHowever, the savings you get from unlocked cell phone deals can be hidden. That's because an unlocked phone will let you freely move between carriers, so you can always choose the mobile plan that suits you. This can make your savings add up over time, as you won't be stuck on an expensive data plan for 24 months as you pay off your phone on an installment plan.\nYou can also sometimes get deals directly from the phone's manufacturer, as they can offer trade-in discounts that retail stores generally won't.\niPhone and Android deals\nLooking for something specific? We've got a whole host of dedicated phone deal pages that are super handy if you've got your eye on that new iPhone or Galaxy in particular.\nCell phone plans\nLooking to simply save on that bill? Perhaps it's time to switch or upgrade that old plan you've been on for years. Our roundup of the best cell phone plans in the US is one of the best resources on the web for finding the right plan for you. No matter whether you're looking for a cheap plan, unlimited or a plan for your family, our guide will help you out.\niPhone deals\nNot sure which Apple device is for you? If you need a guide to the best prices on the whole range, our iPhone deals roundup is the place to start. You'll find the best offers from all the big carriers right here, as well as the cheapest prepaid and unlocked iPhone deals currently available.\niPhone 16 deals\nOur bespoke page for the latest and greatest devices from Apple. Looking for a shiny new iPhone 16? We've got you covered. With outstanding new components and a new focus on AI integration, these latest flagships are not just the most powerful devices yet from Apple, but also the smartest and most feature-packed.\niPhone 15 deals / iPhone 15 Plus deals\nWe've got also pages specifically handling this week's best promotions on the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus. These 'standard' models are a little older now but still fantastic buys thanks to their modern design, powerful chipsets, and hand-me-down features from the previous year's flagship Pro models.

While outwardly these devices feature a very similar look to the last iteration, the Ultra in particular has had a design refresh that's worth checking out.\nSamsung Galaxy S24 deals\nThe Galaxy S24 range is erringly similar to the latest models and still a great buy for 2025.

This excellent device includes a well-thought-out redesign, powerful Tensor G4 chipset, and host of innovative new AI features. It's the slimmest, lightest, and most clever foldable on the market right now - although it does come at a pretty penny.\nGoogle Pixel Fold\nThe brand's first-ever foldable, the Google Pixel Fold is a fantastic device that's more than capable of giving the more established Samsung devices a run for their money.

Generally speaking, they still hold up great thanks to a powerful chipset and great camera setup. If you can get them for cheap they make a great option right now for Android fans.\nPhone deal tips\nIf you want to be sure you're getting a good deal on a phone, there are a lot of factors you need to consider.\nCompare your favorite retailers\nFor one thing, you should look around for different deals on the same phone. Carriers often offer heavy discounts, but occasionally they can be beat by deals on unlocked phones that will let you avoid getting stuck on an expensive mobile plan. So, if you see what seems like a good deal from a carrier, double check that you can't find a better deal elsewhere. And, be prepared to do some math to consider the price of the phone plus the price of the plan you'll be more or less locked into.\nShop at the right time of year\nShopping around big sales events is also a good time to find a phone deal. While major retailers cut prices on popular products, carriers can also take those opportunities to make their usual discounts even more enticing. Carriers also offer some of these major discounts around the launch of a new phone. Even if the price of the phone doesn't change, there may be some freebies that add extra value.\nSwitch to get the best phone deals\nIf you're after the steepest discounts, though, you'll likely need to be ready to switch carriers or at least add new lines to your account. Major carriers strongly incentivize this, and it's one of the few ways you'll get a new phone for more than 50% off. These deals can sometimes be easier if you have a second person you're shopping with, as buy-one-get-one deals are also incredibly common and often only entail one new line of service.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAlex is TechRadar's deals editor, specializing in getting our readers the best bang for the buck on the tech that we know and love.

      "text": "The best phone 2025: we've reviewed and ranked the top phones you should buy in the US\nOnly the best phones from Apple, Samsung, Google and OnePlus\nWe're halfway through 2025 and it's been a great year if you're looking to buy one of the best phones, but there are still plenty of new phones on the horizon. We've just reviewed Samsung's latest foldable phones, including our best Samsung pick - the Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nWe've also updated our Android phones to Android 16 and our Apple phones to the iOS 26 Public Beta, so we can tell you which phones perform best with the latest software.\nFoldable phones continue to get better all around, while AI features on phones have mostly flopped. Phones have gotten more powerful than ever - the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite platform has pushed Android performance past the iPhone for the first time ever. But even better is the efficiency the Snapdragon offers; I'm seeing phones last longer with the best battery life ever.\nIf you need to save money on a smartphone, I've never seen so many great options available for half the price of the most expensive flagship phones. It seems like every big phone maker has a bargain option, and there are powerful phones you can buy cheap that will last you for many years.\nLongevity is the best new feature for smartphones, and every big phone maker is now promising years and years of support with major OS upgrades and security patches for any where from four years (OnePlus) to five or six years (Apple) to seven years (Google and Samsung). With that in mind, I'm only recommending phones that will actually last as long as the phone makers promise; phones you'll be happy to have in your pocket in five years or more.\nWe've reviewed over 1,500 phones at TechRadar over the last 20 years, and I've personally been reviewing phones even longer. I've tested every phone on this list to make sure it lives up to its promise and its worth your money.\n\ud83d\udcf1Phil Berne is a pre-eminent voice in smartphone reviews, a professional reviewer since the Palm Treo 700 and BlackBerry Pearl days. He has reviewed hundreds of smartphones, including all of the best iPhone, Galaxy, and Pixel phones. Phil is TechRadar's Senior Editor for Mobile Reviews and Buying Guides.\nThe Best Phones\nBest iPhone\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max gives you the best of everything Apple offers, and it's everything I want in a smartphone. Sure, the Camera Control was kind of a bust (like Apple Intelligence), but it didn't need a fancy new button to be the most refined, powerful and reliable smartphone you can buy.\nRead more below\nBest Android\nThe OnePlus 13 simply blew me away with its fast performance, incredible battery, and stellar cameras. It also looks snazzy and feels amazing to use. It's not quite as polished as the big iPhone, but it's much cheaper, and it beats Apple's phone in many ways.\nRead more below\nBest iPhone cameras\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max have identical cameras, at last. Both give you 5x optical zoom, Camera Controls, and more fine tuning than ever before on an iPhone.\nRead more below\nBest Android cameras\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is like having a full camera bag in your pocket. It's not the biggest step up from the Galaxy S24 Ultra, but it adds megapixels and improved performance with its Snapdragon 8 Elite inside. This is Samsung best camera phone ever, and one of the best camera phones you can buy overall.\nRead more below\nBest Android\nThe Google Pixel 9 Pro was our phone of the year pick for 2024, with a fantastic design and AI features that work so well, they can be scary. It has great cameras and it's more durable than any previous Pixel.\nRead more below\nBest Foldable phone\nWith the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung returns to form, cramming even more power and technology into a device that is somehow thinner than ever before. With its 200MP camera, incredibly thin design, and humongous foldable display, this device is a cutting edge mobile computer, with a price tag to match its exceptional quality.\nRead more below\nBest iPhone battery\nThe iPhone 16 Plus had the longest battery life of almost any iPhone I've tested, both in the real world and in Future Labs. The iPhone 16 Pro Max may last a bit longer, but for hundreds less, the iPhone 16 Plus is the right choice if longevity is your concern.\nRead more below\nBest bargain phone\nThe Pixel 9a is the latest bargain phone from Google, and it gets the same processing power and much of the same camera capabilities as the mighty Google Pixel 9 Pro. Sadly, it veered a bit too far from the Pixel look, but it also comes in at a much lower price, making it not only a bargain Pixel, but the best bargain phone I've tested overall. Look for deals on this one, but even at full price it's a great phone to buy.\nRead more below\nBest for teens\nThe Apple iPhone 15 is a fantastic phone all around, with software that is intuitive and fun to use and great cameras. It won't get Apple Intelligence features, and maybe that's for the best when it comes to your teenager's smartphone.\nRead more below\nThe best phone in 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBelow, you'll find in-depth details about each of the best phones on our list. I've tested each model extensively, so you can be sure to trust our recommendations.\nThe best iPhone overall\n1. Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want the biggest and best: The iPhone 16 Pro Max is the biggest, fastest, longest-lasting iPhone I've ever tested.\n\u2705 You want Apple Intelligence ... eventually: Sometime in the next month this phone will get AI features, then more after that, then more...\n\u274c You want an affordable big screen: If you want to save hundreds, and have more AI features today, check out the Pixel 9 Pro XL instead.\n\u274c You want a smaller screen, actually: The iPhone 16 Pro has all the same cameras this year, so you aren't missing out by picking the smaller phone.\n\ud83d\udcf1 The iPhone 16 Pro Max is the ultimate iPhone, with all of Apple's newest features inside, including the cool Camera Control and the superfast Apple A18 Pro chipset. Apple Intelligence is on the way, so this phone might get better over time, but it's a powerful, durable, stylish smartphone, if you can afford Apple's best. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nApple's iPhone 15 marks the most significant step up for a base iPhone in several years, earning its place as the best value phone money can buy today.\nDesign: This year's iPhone 16 Pro Max is recognizably an iPhone, of course, but the antenna gap is now a Camera Control that offers many new features. There's also a cool desert titanium, which is probably the best color and not just because it's the one I got.\nDisplay: The iPhone 16 Pro Max has the biggest, brightest display ever on an iPhone, and it's a pleasure to use in any lighting conditions, even shooting photos outside under bright sunlight.\nCamera: This is a big year for Apple cameras thanks to Camera Control, but Apple is also giving the iPhone 16 Pro Max more fine tuned tweaks over the tone and look of your photos, and early reviews say the results are fantastic. The high-speed video recording that enables more fluid slow motion may also be a game-changer for cinematic videos.\nPerformance: I couldn't find any way to slow down the iPhone 16 Pro Max, with its Apple A18 Pro chipset inside. I'll see how it handles Apple Intelligence, but in my tests with everything it can do today, the iPhone 16 Pro Max delivered all of the features with no problems.\nBattery life: Our Future Labs battery test rank the iPhone 16 Pro Max as the longest lasting iPhone you can buy today. It lasted just a bit longer than the iPhone 16 Plus, but both offer incredible battery life.\nValue for money: The iPhone 16 Pro Max isn't a cheap phone, but at least Apple didn't raise the price this year, even though this year's Pro Max inarguably offers more hardware and more value than before.\nRead our full iPhone 16 Pro Max review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | A bigger phone with even more power and intelligence that holds the line on pricing | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | Iconic design with excellent materials and a brand-new hardware feature | 5 / 5 |\nDisplay | Larger display but the resolution is unchanged. Still one of the best in the smartphone game | 4.5 / 5 |\nSoftware | iOS 18 full of useful updates and a handful of really big changes to digest. Apple Intelligence is an exciting addition that has yet to reach its full potential | 4 / 5 |\nCamera | Solid sensor updates but a lot ofbig changes on image processing and control. The Camera Control might be a game changer | 4.5 / 5 |\nPerformance | A18 Pro is more power than most need but you will never be disappointed in performance | 5 / 5 |\nBattery | Excellent battery life and a weclome upgrade on wireless charge speed | 4.5 / 5 |\nThe best Android overall\n2. OnePlus 13\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want the best battery life: On top of everything else it does well, the OnePlus 13 tops our charts in battery life testing. It lasts for days.\n\u2705 You want to switch from iPhone to Android: This is the most polished and fun Android phone, with fewer foibles than most. This is the one for switchers.\n\u274c You want this phone for free: You won't get a deal on this phone from your carrier, but OnePlus offers discounts and bonuses.\n\u274c You want the best camera phone: The OnePlus 13 is one of the best camera phones, but the iPhone 16 Pro and Galaxy S24 Ultra have it beat.\n\ud83d\udcf1 The OnePlus 13 took every concern I had about OnePlus and turned them into strengths, with a phone that is durable, long-lasting, and incredibly attractive. There was nothing I didn't like about this phone, and I'm excited to see how it develops in the years ahead with more advanced AI features. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nOnePlus used to be a flagship-killer phone maker, but now it just makes flagships like the OnePlus 13, one of the best phones you can buy, even if you haven't heard of it. You won't find them at your mobile phone store, but it's worth seeking them out.\nDesign: This is a classy phone with an amazing vegan microfiber finish that is soft to the touch and more welcoming than hard glass. I highly recommend a OnePlus case, too, since it opens the world of MagSafe accessories. Oh, and did I mention this phone is IP69 water resistant? You can clean it in the dishwasher.\nDisplay: One of the best displays ever on a mobile phone, this big screen is great for everything you want to do. It's also incredibly responsive, even if you get it wet.\nCamera: Amazing cameras excel at action shots by freezing motion to a standstill. The colors and details get a lot of help from AI, and I still prefer the iPhone 16 Pro just a bit, but this is an enjoyable camera that produces fantastic pics you'll love to share.\nPerformance: In lab tests and the real world, the OnePlus 13 was the fastest phone I've ever seen, and it beats even the iPhone 16 Pro in many important processor tests, like multi-core performance. What can you do with all that power? The future will tell.\nBattery life: This is the battery life winner, lasting nearly 20 hours in our battery rundown test. The big iPhone above died two hours earlier. The OnePlus 13 also charges faster than any other phone on this list. Even wirelessly, it charges faster than an iPhone.\nValue for money: Don't let the sticker price scare you, OnePlus offers perpetual deals that drop the price on the OnePlus 13, and you'll get a trade-in bonus even if your old phone is broken (or connected to a wire). This is a premium flagship that will cost what you'd pay for the base model.\nRead our full iPhone 16 Pro Max review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Don\u2019t let sticker shock scare you away, OnePlus offers discounts and trade-in bonuses to help. You just can\u2019t get one at the Verizon store (try Best Buy). | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | A more professional look and an incredible feel with the new vegan microfiber. Every color is unique and outstanding, but the blue is the one to get, and definitely get a OnePlus case. | 5 / 5 |\nDisplay | The best display on any smartphone in terms of color, and it also looks great with the curving edges sloping down to the frame. It could be brighter, but it\u2019s a winner. | 5 / 5 |\nSoftware | The best Android interface software, but I wish there was more to take advantage of all that power. Eventually AI may come along, but for now OnePlus isn\u2019t pushing AI tools too hard. This phone is refreshing to use all around. | 4 / 5 |\nCamera | The best cameras for action photos, even at night, and great pics all around. It does more with 3x zoom than some phones managed with 10x zoom. | 4 / 5 |\nPerformance | You won\u2019t find a faster phone, according to our benchmarks. In the real world, it was harder to find the fast lane, but the interface was incredibly snappy and responsive. | 5 / 5 |\nBattery | The longest battery life, thanks to a larger battery and the efficient Snapdragon processor, though OnePlus has managed to fit more battery inside without making the phone thicker. Oh, and it charges stupidly fast. | 5 / 5 |\nThe best iPhone cameras\n3. Apple iPhone 16 Pro\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want Pro performance in a smaller size: Finally, the iPhone 16 Pro doesn't compromise on performance or features vs. Apple's larger iPhone.\n\u2705 You want Apple Intelligence ASAP: There are some new features available, but when Apple Intelligence launches with iOS 18.1, the iPhone 16 Pro will be ready.\n\u274c You want the biggest and best screen: The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a bigger display that packs more pixels, and other small phones might be more sharp.\n\u274c You want more AI now: If AI is your jam, check out what the Android phone makers are doing, especially Google and Samsung, because they tend to offer more features right away.\n\ud83d\udcf1 With the latest camera features and the new Camera Control, the iPhone 16 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro Max give you the best iPhone camera experience ever, and it's only going to get more interesting as Apple Intelligence rolls out with new photo features and much more. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nThe iPhone 16 Pro is the pint-sized powerhouse in Apple's latest iPhone lineup. It features all the same camera capabilities as its Pro Max sibling, but at a smaller size and weight. I wish it had more than 128GB to start, because those cameras produce great images you'll want to keep shooting. Otherwise, there are no big complaints about this year's iPhone.\nDesign: The iPhone 16 Pro looks exactly like last year's iPhone. It's a bit heavier, but you won't notice unless you put the two on a scale. The iPhone looks sleek in the new desert titanium color, and make sure to get a case that works with the Camera Control button on the side.\nDisplay: The iPhone 16 Pro features a 6.1-inch OLED display that can remain always-on and can refresh up to 120Hz. For folks complaining about the refresh rate on the iPhone, just go Pro, it's where the best displays can be found.\nCamera: The iPhone 16 Pro has the same 5X zoom lens as the Pro Max iPhone, but its really the improved quality thanks to the A18 chip that will have folks talking. I especially like the slow motion video that looks extra smooth thanks to higher recording speeds.\nPerformance: The A18 Pro chipset is the most powerful mobile platform I've tested, and there was nothing I could throw at this iPhone to slow it down.\nBattery life: Battery life was very good on the iPhone 16 Pro, it always lasted a day of use. The Pro Max lasts much longer, thanks to its bigger battery inside, but the iPhone 16 Pro won't let you down early. Still, buy the faster charger just in case.\nValue for money: The iPhone 16 Pro is a good value for a powerhouse phone in a compact package. Apple hasn't raised the price this year, though I wish it came with more than 128GB storage standard, so upgrade if you can.\nRead our full iPhone 16 Pro review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | The price holds on this lovely and slightly larger phone but the value would be better with more storage | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | Iconic design with excellent materials and a brand-new hardware feature | 4.5 / 5 |\nDisplay | Slightly larger display but the resolution is unchanged. Still excellent | 4.5 / 5 |\nSoftware | iOS 18 full of useful updates and a handful of really big changes to digest. Apple Intelligence is an exciting addition that has yet to reach its full potential | 4 / 5 |\nCamera | Solid sensor updates, 5x zoom is so welcome, and the Camera Control is an exciting addition | 4.5 / 5 |\nPerformance | A18 Pro is more power than most need but you will never be disappointed in performance | 4.5 / 5 |\nBattery | Excellent battery life and a weclome upgrade on wireless charge speed | 4.5 / 5 |\nThe best Android cameras\n4. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want more than just a smartphone: The Galaxy S25 Ultra can do more than any other smartphone. It can be a laptop replacement, a note pad and pen, and an entire camera bag.\n\u2705 You want to feel the future: The Galaxy AI features keep improving, especially in the camera and Gallery app. There are definitely more AI features to come, so this phone could get better with time.\n\u274c You don't need all of that phone: If you don't need everything and more, you can spend less on the Galaxy S25 Plus. It just won't have the amazing cameras you get with the Galaxy S25 Ultra.\n\u274c You prefer elegance and simplicity: Samsung software isn't getting better, though it is getting prettier. It's still complicated, with many duplicate apps and bloatware you don't want.\n\ud83d\udcf1 The Galaxy S25 Ultra takes smartphone cameras to the extreme. You won't find a more versatile, refined, and clever device, but that power and performance comes at a high price tag. If you don't need all the Ultra features (still with the S Pen?), get the Galaxy S25 Plus instead, but if you want the best cameras, and the best Galaxy overall, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is the phone to beat. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nSamsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra redefines smartphone performance. It stands out as arguably the best overall phone available. It surpasses the iPhone in battery life and performance, features more versatile cameras than any other Android device, and includes unique features rarely seen on modern smartphones, such as the Samsung DeX desktop experience.\nDesign: The Galaxy S25 Ultra's design refinements, though subtle, are noteworthy. This substantial phone now features a more rounded profile, which makes it a bit more appealing, though it now looks just like the cheaper Galaxy S25. The screen has gotten just a tad bigger since last year's model, though the phone is lighter overall.\nDisplay: The Galaxy S25 Ultra's bright OLED screen offers an unparalleled smartphone display experience. While slightly brighter or faster alternatives may exist, its anti-glare coating significantly improves outdoor visibility. Samsung's display delivers vibrant colors and exceptional sharpness for any task.\nCamera: The Galaxy S25 Ultra offers the most versatile camera system on any smartphone, with its 3X and 5X zoom lenses, as well as normal wide and ultra-wide offerings. The zoom cameras use much smaller sensors, so the images are only good for sharing, not prints, but the results are still the most impressive of any phone you'll try.\nPerformance: For users demanding top-tier speed, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is the clear choice. In both benchmark tests and real-world scenarios involving gaming and productivity tasks, it demonstrated the fastest performance of any phone tested, even outperforming the iPhone 16 Pro. This marks a first for Android phones against Apple's custom-designed chipsets.\nBattery: The Galaxy S25 Ultra easily provides two days of typical use, and it readily handles a full day of heavy use. Without an increase in battery capacity, that Snapdragon seems to sip power more slowly, resulting in significantly improved battery performance.\nValue: The Galaxy S25 Ultra's price is high, and the improvements may not seem like a dramatic leap. However, Samsung's commitment to seven years of software updates, including major Android OS updates, significantly enhances the phone's long-term value, and the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor should be able to handle whatever the future throws its way.\nRead our full Galaxy S25 Ultra review\nValue | Samsung held fast on the Galaxy S25 Ultra price. it's not a cheap phone, but design updates, integrated AI and inclusion of the S Pen make it good value. | 4.5/5 |\nDesign | The Galaxy S25 Ultra is now fully part of the Galaxy S-series design family and that generally improves it. We have a bigger screen, thinner and lighter body, and we still have all the things that make an Ultra special, including the titanium, the S-Pen and a big-enough battery. | 4/5 |\nDisplay | The biggest Ultra screen ever. It doesn't break any new ground on technology, but is still an excellent screen for all kinds of content and uses. | 5/5 |\nCameras | There are a lot of lenses here and they're backed by high-pixel counts that will result in extremely detailed photos. Samsung only updated one lens since the last Ultra, but choosing the ultra-wide was the right move, as it improves both ultra-wide and macro images. | 4.5 |\nSoftware and AI | Samsung's and its partners' commitment to deep AI integration is laudable, and it makes for the most frictionless AI experience I've found on any smartphone. It's also backed by a solid and even more useful One UI update. And the AI experience will likely get richer over time | 4.5/5 |\nPerformance | The S25 Ultra's Qualcomm Snapdragon Gen 8 Elite for Galaxy is one impressive chip. It's a near-perfect mix of performance and efficiency. | 5/5 |\nBattery | Best battery life I've seen on a smartphone. Days of use is within reach. | 5/5 |\nThe best Android for AI\n5. Google Pixel 9 Pro\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want to create a lot of stuff using AI: The Google Pixel 9 Pro has tons of AI features to be creative. You can make your own images, tweak photos, write stories and messages, and plenty more.\n\u2705 You want an assistant to take notes for you: Google AI can listen to your calls and take notes later, so you don't have to grab a pen when the doctor or the dog-sitter starts giving you detailed instructions.\n\u274c You're worried about AI: The Google Pixel can listen to your calls and make deep fake images that will fool most people. If you're worried about AI, this phone won't help.\n\u274c You want the absolute best cameras: While the Pixel 9 Pro is impressive, nothing beats the Galaxy S24 Ultra for camera capabilities and quality, not even with Video Boost.\n\u274c You want a bigger Pixel 9 Pro: If you want this same exact phone, I mean exactly the same cameras and everything, only bigger ... get the Pixel 9 Pro XL.\n\ud83d\udcf1 The Google Pixel 9 Pro is a huge departure from the past few years of Pixel design, and I love the changes. It looks sleek and modern, and it features more AI tools than you could imagine. Google's AI can have a conversation, fix your photos, or fake an insurance scam. Maybe don't do that last thing. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nThe Google Pixel 9 Pro is a whole new look for the Pixel family, but it keeps the recent Pixel heritage of new AI features, outstanding cameras, and the brightest and most colorful displays you'll find on any smartphone. It's not just a whole new look for Pixel, there's a lot going on that you need to check out, even if you just want to be wary of what's coming.\nDesign: The Pixel 9 Pro gets rid of the old camera bar for a newer, raised camera pill that is sleek, rounded, and very modern. The Pixel is more durable this year, with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back for the best scratch and crack protection. The Pro and the Pro XL are identical, except for the bigger size, so pick your phone according to your comfort.\nDisplay: Google continues to quietly dominate smartphone displays with the Super Actua screen on the Pixel 9 Pro. It's the brightest screen you'll find, and it looks fantastic. It also uses LTPO technology to refresh between 1-120Hz, so it works as an Always-On display without draining too much power. You won't find much better, especially if you need to take photos in bright sunlight. The Pixel 9 Pro display can handle it.\nCamera: Photos looked fantastic from the Pixel 9 Pro, and video looked even better after it got an AI upgrade using Video Boost. There are still better camera phones for image quality and features, but the Pixel 9 Pro gives you a perfect starting point, and then you can jump into Google Photos for exclusive AI editing tools you'll only find on the Pixel phone.\nPerformance: The Pixel 9 pro lags behind all of the competition in terms of raw performance, and unfortunately that lag rears its head in the real world. I saw slowdowns and stuttering when I tried to do everything at once, even though my Galaxy S24 Ultra can handle everything and more. I hope this phone really lasts sevent years of Android updates, but the future is unclear.\nBattery life: Battery life on the Pixel 9 Pro was solid, but it isn't the best around. I had no trouble getting a full day of use from my phone, but I wish it had faster charging in case I needed to top up. The Pixel 9 Pro XL charges faster than other Pixels, if you want that benefit, but otherwise I have no battery complaints, only wishes for next year.\nValue for money: The Pixel 9 Pro seems a bit expensive, especially considering performance can lag behind the competition. Still, with a free year of Google One AI Premium, which includes 2TB of cloud storage, the deal looks a bit sweeter. Keep an eye out later in the year for price drops, there are usually discounts on Google phones near the holiday season.\nRead our full Google Pixel 9 Pro review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | It\u2019s a great phone all around, but performance lags significantly versus other phones in this price range, so maybe wait for a discount or a bundle deal. | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | Excellent new design; the biggest change to Pixel phones in four years. Fantastic materials and a more modern look. | 5 / 5 |\nDisplay | Google offers the best smartphone screens around on the Pixel 9 Pro, and it\u2019s surprising the company doesn\u2019t crow louder. Super-bright \u2013 be careful to not overheat. | 5 / 5 |\nSoftware | With a grain of salt and a sense of humor, the AI stuff is A-Okay. Google avoids bad AI stereotypes, and gives us a nice glimpse of the future for mobile AI. | 4 / 5 |\nCamera | Fantastic cameras rival the best camera phones you can buy. Great new features, including Add Me for AI group photos. Camera settings are too difficult to manage. | 5 / 5 |\nPerformance | Performance lags significantly, both in benchmark testing and the real world. This phone lags if you push too hard, and Google wants you to push too hard. Seven years ahead? We\u2019ll see. | 3 / 5 |\nBattery | Solid battery life beats the iPhone, and the phone has no trouble lasting all day. You\u2019ll want to use the cameras, so pack an extra charger, but if you\u2019re careful this phone lasts no problem. I wish the charging was as fast as Google makes it seem. | 4 / 5 |\nThe best foldable phone\n6. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want the fastest foldable: The Galaxy Z Fold 7 uses the Snapdragon 8 Elite platform, which is the fastest and most efficient chipset we've tested.\n\u2705 You want a foldable with real cameras: The Z Fold 7 packs the same 200MP sensor as the Galaxy S25 Ultra, one of our favorite camera phones. This is the best camera on any foldable phone, by far.\n\u274c You have to pay rent this month: The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the most expensive phone you can buy in most markets, and it costs more than a laptop... or a month's rent.\n\u274c You love to draw and doodle: The Galaxy Z Fold 7 sadly loses its S Pen capabilities, making the Ultra the only phone for folks who love to draw and sign documents on the go.\n\ud83d\udcf1 If you can swing the high price tag, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is more than just the best superphone you can buy, it truly is like carrying two devices hidden in one compact package. With the improved camera sensor and the new lighter, thinner design, Samsung has toppled most barriers to buying a big foldable, except for the cost. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nSamsung slims down the Galaxy Z Fold 7 to nearly impossible thinness, making it one of the thinnest phones we've ever seen. It's still a remarkable powerhouse, with an even better camera than before, but it costs more than ever as well.\nDesign: The Galaxy Z Fold 7 finally gets the design right, with a cover display that looks and feels like any other flagship smartphone, not the narrow look of Fold's past. It's so incredibly thin and lightweight that it feels like a normal phone when it's closed - you almost forget it opens to an 8-inch tablet with as much room as an iPad mini.\nDisplay: The displays on the Z Fold 7 are both top-notch. They are bright and colorful, and perfectly sharp for any task. If you're worried about the crease on the inner display, don't be. It's unnoticeable when you are using the huge screen for browsing, games, or just as a viewfinder for the amazing new cameras.\nCamera: Just like the Galaxy S25 Ultra, the Z Fold 7 has the Samsung ISOCELL HP2 200MP camera sensor inside, and it takes the best photos of any foldable phone we've seen. That big display is also great for Samsung's advanced AI photo editing tools.\nPerformance: The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor isn't just the fastest chipset you'll find in any smartphone today, it's also incredibly efficient, and the Z Fold 7 has better battery life than you'd expect, along with top notch performance for the most advanced games and multitasking.\nBattery life: The Z Fold 7 has a smaller battery than most phone's this size, but the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor helps it sip juice slowly, and it had no trouble lasting a full day in our hands-on review time. Too bad it can't charge faster.\nValue for money: To justify the incredibly high price, Samung needed to create a phone like no other, with capabilities that no other foldable or flagship smartphone can match. It has mostly succeeded, but the price is still a big, tough pill to swallow.\nRead our full Galaxy Z Fold 7 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\n| Row 0 - Cell 0 | Row 0 - Cell 1 | Row 0 - Cell 2 |\nValue | The most expensive foldable out there, but it might also be worth it | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | Excellent, slim and light design that still feels elegant and solid. | 5 / 5 |\nDisplay | Two fantastic and now larger screens. The crease is almost gone, but so is support for an S Pen. | 4.5 / 5 |\nPerformance | Better than the best Qualcomm chip on other Androids, and the performance knocked our socks off. | 5 / 5 |\nSoftware | Android 16! One UI 8! So much AI. It may sound like a lot, but it's a winning combination. | 4.5 / 5 |\nCameras | The 200MP sensor is a major upgrade, and overall photography is excellent. We would have liked a 5x optical zoom. | 4.5 / 5 |\nBattery | Really good battery life | 4.5 / 5 |\nThe best iPhone for battery life\n7. Apple iPhone 16 Plus\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want an a bigger affordable iPhone: The iPhone 16 Plus gives you just enough more to make it worth the extra cost.\n\u2705 You want the best battery (almost): The iPhone 16 Plus has the second best battery life, coming behind the iPhone 16 Pro Max by mere minutes in our tests.\n\u274c You don't want Apple Intelligence: If you don't want the latest Apple AI stuff coming soon, you'll need an iPhone 15 .\n\u274c You want bigger zoom: The ultrawide doesn't compare to 5x optical zoom on the iPhone 16 Pro, but the cameras are still great.\n\ud83d\udcf1 The iPhone 16 Plus is only a bit more expensive than the iPhone 16, but you get a much bigger screen and a bigger\nbattery inside. That extra battery makes this the affordable battery life champ among iPhones, so if you need the most possible battery life from your Apple device, the iPhone 16 Plus is the best choice. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nApple's iPhone 16 Plus is only slightly more expensive than the iPhone 16, but you get a much larger display and the bigger battery that extra size allows. This makes the iPhone 16 Plus not only a great bargain option versus the iPhone 15 Pro Max, but also the best choice for battery life if you need your iPhone to last the longest.\nDesign: The iPhone 16 Plus looks like the iPhone 16 and not the Pro models, so you won't get the titanium frame, but you do have better color options with brighter hues. The USB-C port is also there, as well as the Dynamic Island camera, which used to be for Pro iPhone users only.\nDisplay: The iPhone 16 Plus has a 6.7-inch display, and that 0.6-inch difference versus the iPhone 16 is actually pretty big. Apple didn't just blow up the same resolution, either, you get more pixels to keep the same sharpness as the smaller iPhone.\nCamera: There are only two cameras on the iPhone 16 Plus, a 48MP main camera and a 12MP ultra wide. You might wish for a zoom lens, but these cameras still take stellar pics. It's an iPhone, after all.\nPerformance: The iPhone 16 Plus has a brand new Apple A18 chipset inside, which means it's ready for Apple Intelligence AI features that will be invading more powerful iPhone and iPad models in the next month or so. Even before the AI gets here, this phone is a powerful device that could easily handle anything I threw at it.\nBattery life: In our battery tests in Future Labs, the iPhone 16 Plus was the second best iPhone I ever tested in terms of battery life, only minutes behind the much more expensive iPhone 16 Pro Max. It lasted well over 16 hours of runtime, versus a scant 12 hours of battery life on the smaller iPhone 16.\nValue for money: If you were already considering the iPhone 16, you should probably just spend a little more and have more battery life and a much bigger display. The next upgrade, to the Pro-level chips, is the one that hurts the wallet more.\nRead our full iPhone 16 Plus review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\nDesign | The iPhone 16 Plus offers a 6.7-inch screen in a lightweight design that comes in fun colors. | 4.5 / 5 |\nDisplay | While it's not 120Hz, the 6.7-inch is expansive, rich with details, and gets quite bright. | 4 / 5 |\nPerformance | The A18 makes the iPhone 16 Plus fly and provides ample headroom for years of use. | 4.5 / 5 |\nCamera | Camera Control steals the show, but both the main and ultra wide benefit from improved low-light performance. | 4.5 / 5 |\nSoftware | iOS 18 runs really well here and provides a lot of functional enhancements. | 4 / 5 |\nBattery | While it's no longer the best battery life of any iPhone, the 16 Plus still easily lasts all day long. | 4 / 5 |\nValue | At $899, you're getting plenty of performance in a polished build that should last for years... and get software updates. | 4 / 5 |\nThe best bargain phone\n8. Google Pixel 9a\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\n\u2705 You want a great camera for macro photos While there's no zoom, Google\u2019s Pixel 9a surprisingly shoots some of the best close-up photos I\u2019ve seen on any smartphone, let alone a bargain.\n\u2705 You want a durable phone that will last a while The Pixel 9a is built tougher than previous Pixel A-series, and it will get seven years of major Android OS and security updates.\n\u2705 You want a great AI phone There\u2019s plenty of AI on this phone, and the best features can screen calls and record conversations, helping you keep your hands free and your mind on task.\n\u274c You want a nice looking phone Ugh, there's just no style to this phone. You can hardly tell it comes from the same lineage as the Pixel 9.\n\u274c You don\u2019t want a bigoted AI tool on your phone Google's Pixel Studio produces stereotypes that reinforce bigotry. I hope Google removes the ability to draw people.\n\ud83d\udcf1The Google Pixel 9a is the latest A-series phone from Google, and that means it gives you the same performance as the Pixel 9 with the great cameras and dazzling display you expect from Google. Sadly, the series takes an ugly turn, literally, and the Pixel 9a isn't very handsome, but it comes with most, if not all, of the latest Google AI features. It\u2019s a solid bargain phone, if you don\u2019t mind the looks. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nThe Pixel 9a delivers typical Pixel strengths like great photos and useful AI, backed by a seven-year update promise, but wraps it all in a surprisingly bland design that deviates significantly from the main Pixel 9 series.\nDesign: A major departure from the stylish Pixel 9, the Pixel 9a features a flat, plain design with a simple camera bump, reminiscent of generic budget phones, though the Peony and Iris colors are nice. Despite its looks, Google claims it's the most durable A-series yet with IP67 water resistance.\nDisplay: The 6.3-inch OLED 'Actua' display is excellent for the price \u2013 very bright and colorful, matching the Pixel 9. Turning off the sometimes-dim Adaptive Display mode improves the experience. It uses older Gorilla Glass 3, however.\nCamera: Photos surprisingly hold up well even against the Pixel 9 Pro in terms of color and balance, though resolution is capped at 12MP and fine detail is lacking due to smaller sensors than even the Pixel 8a. The standout feature is its astonishingly good macro photography capability, rivaling dedicated cameras like my own full frame Nikon.\nPerformance: The Tensor G4 chip provides adequate performance for daily tasks and runs most AI features, but it's not as fast as competitors and it felt a bit sluggish in my testing, especially with only 8GB of RAM. Worryingly, it already lacks some AI features found on the Pixel 9, casting doubt on the seven-year update promise's scope.\nBattery life: Despite having a larger battery (5,100 mAh) than the Pixel 9, the Pixel 9a doesn't offer significantly better battery life, lasting a full day but not exceptionally long. Charging is slow at 23W wired, but wireless charging is included, a plus at this price.\nValue for money: At $499 / \u00a3499 / AU$849, the Pixel 9a offers solid value, especially considering the seven-year update commitment and strong camera performance (particularly macro). However, like previous A-series phones, expect potential discounts down the line, making it potentially an even better bargain if you wait.\nRead our full Google Pixel 9a review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | A great phone at this price, with incredible longevity thanks to seven years of updates. The cameras are among the best in this price range, even if the look isn\u2019t so premium. | 5 / 5 |\nDesign | It\u2019s durable, and the colors are real nice. Otherwise, it\u2019s ugly as sin. Seriously, Google had a winning A-series formula that it ruined when it created this phone. But the design doesn\u2019t get in the way, at least. | 3 / 5 |\nDisplay | Excellent display that's bright and colorful, better than most phones at this price. Some trouble with Adaptive mode was easily fixed. If only the phone\u2019s performance could keep up with the fast screen. | 4 / 5 |\nSoftware | A polished version of Android that's easier to use, with plenty of features. Some useful AI tools, but also some AI imagery slop that resorts to bigotry and should be removed from this phone. | 2 / 5 |\nCamera | Solid cameras take photos that look like they could have come from the Pro model, if you don\u2019t look too close. Astonishing macro capabilities rival my DSLR camera and make this phone a winner. Too bad about the low resolution and lack of detail, and some zoom would have been nice. | 3 / 5 |\nPerformance | Performance is adequate for Pixel fans, though it won\u2019t win any races. No problems with my favorite apps and games, but things slowed down when I engaged the AI as it sent requests to and from the cloud. | 3 / 5 |\nBattery | A larger battery somehow doesn\u2019t equal more battery life, but the Pixel 9a still lasts a full day with no trouble, and has wireless charging, a rarity at this price. | 3 / 5 |\nThe best phone for Teens\n9. Apple iPhone 15\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want an affordable iPhone: The iPhone 15 strikes a nice balance between price and cutting-edge features, so you don't feel like you're missing out.\n\u2705 You want a camera upgrade: Between the new 48MP main camera and some excellent portrait photography capabilities, the iPhone 15 offers strong camera specs for the price.\n\u274c You want Apple Intelligence: If you want the upcoming Apple AI features, you'll need a Pro model or better.\n\u274c You want bigger zoom: The 2x optical zoom on offer here doesn't quite compare to 3x optical zoom on the iPhone 15 Pro or Samsung Galaxy S24.\n\ud83d\udcf1 The iPhone 15 has all of Apple's best software features, and that's what makes iPhone owners happy. You get great hardware that will last years, without paying too much for extra cameras and titanium you don't need. Plus, this one comes in better colors than the Pro iPhone. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nApple's iPhone 15 marks the most significant step up for a base iPhone in several years, earning its place as the best value phone money can buy today.\nDesign: The iPhone 15 does what the iPhone 14 did not: it moves the base model forward with a refreshed chassis design, a brand-new (and eye-catching) rear glass panel, and a compatibility-improving USB-C port.\nDisplay: The iPhone 15's 6.1-inch Super XDR OLED display is bright and responsive, however, as on the iPhone 14, its refresh rate is locked to 60Hz. You do get Apple's Dynamic Island this time around, though.\nCamera: There are still just two lenses on the back of the iPhone 15, but one of them is vastly improved over the iPhone 14. The 12MP ultrawide is basically the same, but the main camera is now the same 48MP lens that you'll find on the excellent iPhone 14 Pro (and indeed the iPhone 15 Pro).\nPerformance: The iPhone 15 uses the iPhone 14 Pro's superfast A16 Bionic chipset, which should provide more than enough power for most iPhone owners (for context, the latter was the most powerful handset of 2022).\nBattery life: The iPhone 15 is rated for 20 hours of video playback, 80 hours of audio-only, and a 50% recharge in 30 minutes with the optional 20W charger. In my testing, I was able to use the phone casually for a full day.\nValue for money: In recent years, Apple's standard models have felt like minor upgrades that pale in comparison to their respective Pro-level counterparts, but the iPhone 15 bucks that trend by being a genuinely great value product.\nRead our full iPhone 15 review\nFAQs\nWhat is the best phone in 2025?\nThe best phone is the iPhone 16 Pro Max, which has superlative performance, fantastic cameras and a new Camera Control, and more AI features on the way. The best Android phone is the OnePlus 13, which is the fastest phone you can buy, and also the phone with the best battery life. The iPhone tops the OnePlus in cameras and features, with more features that work between iPhone and other Apple devices.\nWhat's the best camera phone?\nWhich phone has the best cameras?\nThe best camera phone will decide on the photos you like to take, but the iPhone 16 Pro Max is the best camera among iPhone devices, and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is the best camera for Android fans. However, if you want a more artistic look, you might prefer a OnePlus 13 with its Hasselblad camera partnership tuning the look of its photos. Bargain hunters will be happy with the cameras on the Google Pixel 9a.\nWhat phones are waterproof?\nWhat phones can I get wet, and what is the level of water resistance on most phones?\nYou might be surprised to learn that every phone on this list can take a dunk underwater with no trouble. If you get them dirty, you can rinse them gently in the sink (as long as there are no cracks or other damage). All of our best phone picks are rated against water up to IPx7, which means that they can survive a dunk in one meter of fresh water for up to 30 minutes. Some phones, like the OnePlus 13, are even more durable, with an IP69 rating to survive jets and spraying water, and a deeper, longer dunk.\nWhich phone carrier is best?\nWhich wireless mobile network should I choose?\nThat's a tough call, so the best advice I can offer is to ask around and find people in your area who are happy with their cell service - then choose the network they use. Networks vary greatly over the miles and miles of US geography, so while I might be able to say that one offers better performance nationwide, that same carrier might not be the best in your area. I've used all of the major US networks - Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile - and I have seen great performance from all of them, as well as signal loss and dropouts from each.\nIs phone insurance protection worth it?\nShould I buy the extended warranty and phone insurance that my phone maker offers?\nIn general, I buy phone insurance with my own personal phones to protect against damage. I have butter fingers, and I have dropped phones so hard that they break even in a sturdy case. With insurance, my last iPhone drop cost more than $100 deductible to repair, but without insurance it might have been a total loss. I have had great experience with Apple's insurance plan, but I have found that companies using third-party insurance may be harder to deal with. If you don't have insurance, you should at least have a back-up plan or cheap phone if your phone breaks so that you can stay connected.\nWhich phone has the biggest screen?\nWhich phones give me the biggest display?\nIf you want the absolute biggest screen on your phone, you will need to buy a foldable. A flip phone like the Motorola Razr Ultra (2025) can pack a whopping 7-inch display inside, which is larger even than the 6.9-inches you get with an iPhone 16 Pro Max or Galaxy S25 Ultra. But if you want to go even larger, you need a tablet-style foldable like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, which gives you a 7.6-inch display inside. That's almost as big as an iPad mini, tucked away in your pocket.\nHow do I choose the best phone?\nThe first thing you need to decide when buying a new smartphone is how much you want to spend. The smartphone market varies dramatically, from very high-end handsets that cost well over four-figures, to much cheaper phones that can be found for only a few hundred. I have options on this list at both ends of the price spectrum.\nOnce you've decided how much you want to spend, you should decide whether you want to try one of the best Android phones or go for one of the best iPhones. Often, the platform decision has more to do with your work, your friends and family and what they use to share photos and messages, and what sort of computer or devices you already own.\nIf you're looking for something outside the norm, I have plenty of unique options, as well. There are phones with a built-in pen for writing, and phones that fold in half to be more compact. There are large phones, small phones, and Max-sized phones. I have phones with space-level zoom, and phones that specialize in touching portraits.\nNo matter what phone you choose, you can be sure that I've thoroughly tested and vetted every phone on this list, and I know you'll be satisfied with any of these devices in your pocket.\nHow we test\nI've only included phones on this list that have been thoroughly tested in Future Labs and in the real world by our expert review editors. I test every feature on a phone, then we dive deeper to discover all of the hidden goodies.\nI test phones rigorously for battery life and charging times, processor speed and performance, and especially for camera and video recording capabilities. I make sure that phones deliver on the promises and claims they make. If Samsung says a phone charges in 30 minutes, I time it to make sure.\nI've seen every phone you can buy, so I know how each model stacks up against one another. I use both iPhone and Android phones all the time, so I know what I'm saying about the phones you buy, no matter what you pay. I make sure the phones deliver what I'd expect for the price.\nOnce I'm done, I never stop. I update our reviews as the phones are updated. Our reviews are always fresh, so check again before you buy to make sure you're getting the latest review on the best phones you'll find.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nPhil Berne is a preeminent voice in consumer electronics reviews, starting more than 20 years ago at eTown.com.

      "text": "I showed the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 to a Z Fold 4 owner, and he was blown away\nThe ultimate folding upgrade\nJust a few weeks before the rollout of the truly excellent Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, I ran into an old friend who inexplicably had a Galaxy Z Fold 4. In all my years covering Samsung's folding phone efforts, I'd rarely seen one in the wild (outside of South Korea, where they are everywhere), let alone someone I knew carrying one.\nIn the 43 years we've known each other, I'd never known my friend to be an early adopter, but there he was with a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4, unfolding it, checking work email, looking at stocks, basically using it as his primary device. I looked at it and noted how the protective covering on the flexible screen was bubbled along the crease and in other areas.\nThis Z Fold 4 has been abused and loved in equal measure. I was just days away from the Samsung Unpacked event, where I expected to see the rumored Samsung Galaxy Z Fold Ultra. My friend and I chuckled about the sorry state of his folding phone, and he started asking me about what he should get next. I recommended he at least wait to see what this \"Fold Ultra\" is all about.\nFast forward a few weeks, and I could not wait to show him the Galaxy Z Fold 7 I'd been carrying. The tech introduction would have to wait, though, because we were all gathering on the beach. As you may recall, the Z Fold 7, like most of the other most recent Folds, is rated IP48 for fresh water resistance but essentially has zero dust and sand capabilities.\nBeach fumble\nMy friend arrived on the beach, and I watched as he took out his Z Fold 4, and then gasped as it slipped from his hands and dropped onto the sand.\n\"Buddy, that's not sand-resistant,\" I told him.\nGingerly picking it up, he started frantically shaking and blowing it, \"I know!\" He added that he usually brings it in a Ziplock bag (I've done the same with the Z Fold 6), but he also never goes to the beach anyway \u2013 except for today, that is.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nWhile he inspected the hinge and ports, I, in an extreme example of 'things you do not need to hear in the moment,' told him how sand could completely destroy the hinge mechanism.\nAttempting a mop-up of my faux pas, I excitedly told him I had something to show him: the new Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nHe looked at me quizzically and chided, \"Hey, you told me to wait for the Ultra.\"\n\"I know,\" I shrugged,\" This is basically that phone, they added 'Ultra' features like the 200MP sensor, but it's not called that.\"\nI could tell that the nomenclature switch or misdirection threw him.\nCozying to the Fold 7\nLater, when we were far from the beach, I collected the Z Fold 7 and showed it to him. His eyes widened. Then I handed the phone to him.\n\"Wow,\" he said as he turned the two-in-one device over in his hands. He marveled at the thinness (4.2mm) and weight, and then struggled a bit to open it. I think the magnets in this Z Fold 7, which help hold the foldable phone closed, are considerably stronger than on his Z Fold 4.\nHe pulled out his Z Fold 4 and opened it, looking at its puckered screen. We talked a bit about the protective covering and how the Z Fold 7 has the same thing, though I would hope it does better in the long run.\n\"Are the screens the same size?\" he asked me, and then he placed his Z Fold 4 on top of my Z Fold 7. The size difference was obvious to him, even as I said, \"No, the Z Fold 7 is an 8-inch flexible display.\"\nI noticed that his rather thick case has an empty slot for a stylus (not sure if it was an S Pen), but I recalled that he said he initially had a case that didn't even fit his pen. While I wasn't sure of just how much my friend used a stylus (the two times I saw him with the Z Fold 4, he was without it), I shared the bad news that the Z Fold 7 lost the digitizing label and no longer supports the S Pen, though he could use a dumb capacitive stylus. He didn't say anything but nodded knowingly.\nWe also talked a bit about the cameras as I took a photo with the 200MM camera and then zoomed in on the photo to show him how much information that sensor can collect.\nHefting the phone like his hand was a scale, my friend smiled as I told him the Z Fold 7 is, at 215 grams, lighter than a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.\nStill holding the Z Fold 7, he said, \"Yeah, but I have to pay $2,300, right?\" I corrected him, \"$2,000.\" He considered this, but I could tell he was already convinced that the Z Fold 7 would be his next phone.\nThroughout that evening, I let other old friends hold the phone. Every single one of them was surprised at the size and weight. I don't know if they, like my friend, would give up their iPhones for it, but for a devoted Z Fold owner, there may be no better upgrade, even with the loss of S Pen support and that price.\nYou might also like\n- The Galaxy Z Fold 7 costs too much \u2013 but this could actually be a good thing for folding phones\n- A YouTuber is folding and unfolding the Galaxy Z Fold 7 200,000 times in an extreme durability test livestream\n- The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 might just be the perfect foldable, and sets a standard for others to follow\nA 38-year industry veteran and award-winning journalist, Lance has covered technology since PCs were the size of suitcases and \u201con line\u201d meant \u201cwaiting.\u201d He\u2019s a former Lifewire Editor-in-Chief, Mashable Editor-in-Chief, and, before that, Editor in Chief of PCMag.com and Senior Vice President of Content for Ziff Davis, Inc.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Apple iPhone 16 Pro is one of the best iPhones Apple has ever made, and if the 16 Pro Max is too big for your tastes then it's the best new iPhone for you, and deserves a spot atop our 'Best phones' list. The screen is slightly larger and still lovely. It packs more power than most people will need in a smartphone and takes beautiful photos. The entire photo and video operation is enhanced by upgraded cameras, new image manipulation tools, and the new Camera Control button. Apple Intelligence is an intriguing addition that's quite useful in some situations but unrealized in others. It's a solid glimpse of what's to come. Overall, the iPhone 16 Pro will be a big leap if you're still using, for instance, an iPhone 12 Pro, but it's not necessarily worth trading in your iPhone 15 Pro.\nPros\n- +\nSlightly larger and heavier but still compact size\n- +\nCamera Control button for instant camera access\n- +\nA18 Pro\n- +\nApple Intelligence\nCons\n- -\nApple Intelligence leaves you wanting more\n- -\nHalf the storage it should have\n- -\nNot the sharpest screen in its class\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nApple iPhone 16 Pro: Two-minute review\nThe iPhone 16 Pro is Apple's 6.3-inch smartphone for those who think a 6.9-inch screen is overkill. Put another way, the iPhone 16 Po is essentially the same as the iPhone 16 Pro Max, just smaller and lighter. Aside from the storage options starting at a lesser (and not very useful) 128GB, there are no major differences between the two handsets. You could arguably read my iPhone 16 Pro Max review and learn everything you need to know about the iPhone 16 Pro.\nLike that larger phone, this iPhone 16 Pro is not a sea change from the iPhone 15 Pro. With the exception of the very welcome 5x optical zoom upgrade (it was only 3x on the 15 Pro) and the new Camera Control 'button', the design is unchanged. This is not a bad thing. Apple has settled on a core iPhone aesthetic, and seems uninterested in changing it. Mostly now it just polishes the edges, changes up materials, and sometimes shuffles the orientation of the camera array (that didn't happen here but go take a look at the iPhone 16).\nThe changes come in the form of power, a Camera Control button that makes this the most traditional camera-like iPhone ever, and an infusion of Apple Intelligence via iOS 18. It's hard to say if any of these enhancements warrant an update from an iPhone 15 Pro, but they will all change your iPhone experience.\nEven though little has changed on the looks side, you might notice that the black bezel around the screen has slimmed down a bit \u2013 this is how Apple makes a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display grow to 6.3 inches without making the phone much larger.\nLeaving screen size and that new button aside, the biggest changes in the iPhone 16 Pro can be found on the inside. There's the powerful, new A18 Pro, a chip that is so speedy it tends to max out many of our benchmark tests, and maintains a measurable lead over competitors' silicon.\nThere's also iOS 18, a platform that brings some big changes to Photos, customizability, the incredible Math Notes, and new apps like Passwords. It's also the delivery vehicle for Apple Intelligence, a work-in-progress AI platform that I was only able to test by running the latest iOS 18 developer build \u2013 note that your shipping iPhone 16 Pro may not have any of these AI features for a little while.\nWhat I did get was a new Siri, impressive photo clean-up tools, and Writing Tools that could help the compositionally challenged. Apple Intelligence generally feels a bit underwhelming, especially without native image generation, Genmojis and third-party LLM integration. It's hard to argue for Apple Intelligence as an upgrade driver when Google and Samsung are selling smartphones with far more complete AI offerings.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe cameras get a few nice upgrades, like a 48MP ultrawide and the ability to shoot in 4K at 120fps. Apple still hasn't implemented 8K video recording, but I don't see that as a huge deal.\nI really like the new video Speed control, which lets you alter the playback speed of that high-frame rate video, and the Audio Mix is a powerful tool that might make you not regret leaving your microphone behind.\nObviously, there's a choice to be made here, but not just between the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max. In that situation, you're choosing based on differences in screen size, battery life (a fairly big difference this year), and base storage. Oh, and price. If you like your screens really big, then the 6.9-inch iPhone 16 Pro Max is for you. If your pockets, and your pocketbook, are smaller, this iPhone 16 Pro might be your best option.\nWhat's interesting, though, is just how close the base-model iPhone 16 is to the Pro now. Yes, the iPhone 16 doesn't have an A18 pro chip, but it does have the A18, which is only a bit less powerful and efficient (will you notice?). The iPhone 16 is only 6.1 inches, and the OLED Super Retina XDR display does not offer super-smooth Pro Motion, which, again, you might not notice.\nThe camera differences are more pronounced. There's no 12MP 5x optical zoom on the iPhone 16, while both Pro phones have it. The ultrawide camera is still just 12MP, while the Pro phones now have a 48MP sensor.\nStill, all iPhone 16 phones do have the new Camera Control button (which feels like it now competes with last year's darling, the Action button), and a pair of aligned cameras that are capable of shooting spatial photos and videos. They'll all also support Apple Intelligence as it rolls out.\nFinally, the iPhone 16 starts at just $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,399, and starts with the same 128GB of storage as the 16 Pro (it maxes out a 512GB option). In some ways, the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have ended up with the bigger upgrades, and might look like better value. That said, I can't live without my telephoto, so I'll always choose the Pro models.\nApple iPhone 16 Pro review: Price and availability\n- Starts at $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,849\n- Pre-orders open now, and the phone ships from September 20\nThe iPhone 16 Pro was announced at the Apple 'Glowtime' event on September 9, 2024, and it's shipping from September 20.\nLike the iPhone 16 Pro Max, the iPhone 16 Pro is slightly larger than its predecessor, has a bigger screen (thanks mostly to a thinner bezel), a faster CPU, incoming Apple Intelligence, and the new Camera Control button, and it still costs the same as last year's iPhone 15 Pro, starting at $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,849.\nMy only frustration here is that this phone is saddled with half the storage space of the Pro Max as a starting option. If I ran Apple, I would make sure all pro-level phones started with the same amount of storage space.\nThe larger but otherwise identical iPhone 16 Pro Max costs $1,199 / \u00a31,199 / AU$2,149. If you like big screens and a reasonable amount of storage for all that 4K 120fps video, you probably want to choose the iPhone 16 Pro Max.\nThe phones are available in Desert Titanium, White Titanium, Black Titanium, and Natural Titanium, which is the color of my test unit. I still prefer the black.\n| Storage | US price | UK price | AU price |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 128GB | $999 | \u00a3999 | AU$1,799 |\n| 256GB | $1,099 | \u00a31,099 | AU$1,999 |\n| 512GB | $1,299 | \u00a31,299 | AU$2,349 |\n| 1TB | $1,499 | \u00a31,499 | AU$2,699 |\n- Value score: 4 / 5\nApple iPhone 16 Pro review: Specs\n| iPhone 16 Pro | |\n|---|---|\n| Dimensions: | 149.6 x 71.5 x 8.25mm |\n| Weight: | 199g |\n| Display: | 6.3-inch OLED |\n| Resolution: | 2622 x 1206 pixels |\n| Refresh rate: | Adaptive 1-120Hz |\n| Chipset: | A18 Pro |\n| Rear cameras: | 48MP main (24mm, \u0192/1.78), 48MP ultra-wide (13mm, \u0192/2.2), 12MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom (120mm, \u0192/2.8) |\n| Front camera: | 12MP (\u0192/1.9) |\n| Storage: | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB |\nApple iPhone 16 Pro review: Design\n- Apple has settled on an iPhone aesthetic\n- Bigger but not unwieldy\n- Excellent materials and build\n- There's a new button in town\nAt a glance it'll be a challenge to discern the differences between the new iPhone 16 Pro and last year's iPhone 15 Pro, but all you have to do is hold the new phone or, if as I did, put the two phones side-by-side to see the differences.\nGranted, aesthetically there are none. It's another Titanium grade 5 phone with flat edges and gently curved corners. The camera array looks unchanged, and the button and port placement are the same, save for the addition of the new Camera Control button, of which more shortly. But the iPhone 16 Pro is unmistakably taller and wider than the iPhone 15 Pro. It's not a lot, but this pocket-sized phone takes a tiny step into phablet territory.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro measures 149.6mm x 71.5mm x 8.25mm and weighs 199g; the iPhone 15 Pro measures 146.6mm x 70.6mm x 8.25mm and 187g. The weight gain between the Pro phones is a bit more than that between the iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPhone 16 Pro Max, at 12g compared to 6g. That extra weight is because the iPhone 16 Pro is a bigger upgrade physically from the iPhone 15 Pro, and that's because the smaller Pro now has a 12MP 5x zoom (it was 3x) which includes the tetraprism lens. The bigger battery also adds a touch more weight.\nThat may all be worth it for the larger screen, better camera, and longer battery life, but I wonder how those with smaller hands will feel about the evolution.\nAs I noted, there's nothing remarkable about most of the button, speaker, and microphone configuration, which is unchanged from the iPhone 15 Pro and also matches the larger iPhone 16 Pro Max.\nOn the bottom edge are the Thunderbolt 4-capable USB-C power and data ports, speaker grilles, and microphones. The rest of the speaker system lives at the very top of the display, and together the speakers provide rich, clear, spatial audio.\nThe biggest change comes by way of the new Camera Control button, which lives approximately where the antenna cutouts lived on the iPhone 15 Pro.\nApple does not call it a button, but the Camera Control\u2026 control can be pressed like a button to instantly access the Camera app. If your phone is asleep, a press will wake it and another press will open the camera. A third press will fire the shutter.\nCamera Control is, however, so much more than a camera shutter button. It's a stack of technology that includes pressure and touch sensors under a sapphire surface. It took some getting used to, but now when I double-press just enough to engage the Taptic Engine, I gain access to additional camera features like different lenses, exposure, aperture, and other controls.\nI worried initially that it might be too easy to accidentally trigger the button, but it's recessed enough that this is almost impossible.\nApple makes undeniably beautiful products, and the iPhone 16 Pro is no exception, Like the 16 Pro Max, it's made of grade 5 titanium over a graphite-covered aluminum substructure. In addition to good looks, the phone is dust and water-resistant. The IP68 rating means it can survive 30 minutes in 1.5 meters of water \u2013 I ran my test unit under a sprinkler and it handled it just fine.\n- Design score: 4.5 / 5\nApple iPhone 16 Pro review: Display\n- Still-excellent Super Retina XDR display\n- Sharp and very bright\n- ProMotion\nApple didn't update its screen technology, but that doesn't mean the display here isn't still gorgeous and generally excellent.\nThe Super Retina XDR's resolution is not the highest in the industry. The 460ppi doesn't beat, for instance, what you can find on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra (501) or even the Google Pixel 9 Pro (495), but past a certain point the human eye can't discern the difference.\nThanks to the larger chassis and skinnier bezel, this is a bigger screen. It's not higher-resolution but there are more pixels to work with. So the iPhone 16 Pro is 2622 x 1206 pixels, as compared to the iPhone 15 Pro's 2556 x 1179 \u2013 yes, you're getting a extra 66 x 27 pixels here, so enjoy.\nThe display's Dynamic Island, which houses the 12MP TrueDepth camera and can display app and services information, is unchanged from the iPhone 15 Pro.\nI don't mind the pill-shaped cutout. Videos usually play with the Dynamic Island cordoned off in black space. I played games where the cutout lives in the action, but it's not distracting.\nThe Dynamic Island houses the 12MP FaceTime camera, which takes great portrait-mode selfies, and Face ID, which is my never-fail biometric unlocking system.\nDespite the size differences, the iPhone 16 Pro's display shares all the same features as the iPhone 16 Pro Max's. It can get really bright, up to 2,000 nits outdoors (there are now phones, like the Google Pixel 9 Pro, that beat it on the peak brightness front though).\nIt has HDR, True Tone, and always-on support. Even in sleep mode, the display will show the date, time, and notifications on the lock screen. In standby mode, it can be the perfect nightstand companion \u2013 I now always sleep with an iPhone docked next to my bed so that I can glance at it in the middle of the night to see the time.\nProMotion is one of the futures you get when you upgrade from an iPhone 16 to one of the Pro models. This enables the display refresh rate to range fluidly from a power-sipping 1Hz up to 120Hz for super-smooth motion in gaming and sports.\nFinally, the 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio delivers inky blacks. In my experience, everything on the screen looks clear, bright, colorful, and fluid. Videos, websites, and games all look great.\n- Display score: 4.5 / 5\nApple iPhone 16 Pro review: Software and Apple Intelligence\n- iOS 18\n- Apple Intelligence is a glimpse of the possibilities\nApple Intelligence is nothing without iOS 18, the platform that will deliver Apple's brand of artificial intelligence \u2013 whenever Apple is ready to deliver it.\niOS 18 is a pretty significant update, with major changes to the Control Center, home screen customizations, the Photos app, Messaging, and more. Not every change will be entirely welcome. I think the Photos app redesign will confuse some, but they'll find relief when they use the new search, which accepts more natural language queries to deliver useful photo results.\nControl Panel is getting a massive overhaul that turns this rather rudimentary one-page drop-down into a customizable play space. System control icons can be moved, resized, and organized to your heart's content.\nPlus, there are some cool hidden features like Math Notes, which lets you solve equations written in Notes (you can use your finger). All you have to do is put an equals sign \"=\" at the end and the results are written out in your handwriting.\niOS 18 brings a robust new Passwords app that surfaces previously hidden security and password features and utilities. I think it'll get a lot of use.\nApple Intelligence should, really, be the star of this show. However, unless you install an iOS 18 beta on your new iPhone 16 Pro, you won't see it out of the box.\nTo test my iPhone 16 Pro, I ran the iOS 18 developer beta, which gave me access to some but not all of the Apple Intelligence features, a good chunk of which might not arrive until October, or even next year.\nThe Apple Intelligence available as a beta today is still a subset of what Apple promised in June at WWDC 24. Writing Tools is here in the beta, and it offers (once you find it) to recast and rewrite bits of text in email, texting, and Notes. It's effective at adding, for instance, professionalism without altering the meaning of your text.\nIn Notes, I can now instantly transcribe a recording (you have to find 'record audio' under the paperclip icon), and it will show me in rea ltime a very accurate transaction. Unfortunately, it's not as good as Google and Samsung's AI transcription capabilities, which can break out different speakers. I do like that Notes will instantly summaries an entire recording.\nSiri gets a makeover, with a full-screen glow replacing the small pulsing Siri orb. Siri is also better at maintaining context. I asked Siri where I was, and then followed up with questions about restaurants, hotels, and Broadway shows (I was in New York). I never had to restate my location or repeat the \"Siri\" wake word.\nI can still summon Siri by name, or by long-pressing the power button. In the latter case, the screen deforms slightly to make it look as if you're squeezing the screen. And when Siri responds, the display undulates \u2013 it's a neat visual effect. Siri is also somewhat better at understanding poorly spoken prompts. If you pause a lot, say \"um\", or stumble, it can figure it out. If you're just babbling, though, it probably can't.\nSiri can give you guidance on basic system tasks, and can still perform tasks for you (ask Siri to \"take a selfie\" and it will open the FaceTime camera; you still have to press the shutter). What Siri still can't do is use the information it understands about you from your phone to be more proactive and contextually aware. It also lacks deeper app insights. These capabilities should show up eventually.\nSiri can also maintain the context of a conversation. As mentioned, I asked about my location and then about restaurants and Broadway shows, and it answered each successive question without my needing to restate \"Siri\" or tell it what place I was talking about.\nOne of my favorite Siri updates is one that means you don't need to speak to it at all \u2013 you can just triple-tap at the bottom of the screen and a text box appears. This has the same limitations as spoken Siri, though. I asked \"Where is my cheese?\" and Siri was stumped. But when I asked about getting a boiled egg into a Coke bottle, Siri brought up science experiments that would enable me to do that.\nClean Up, which is also part of the \"to come\" Apple Intelligence, and found under Editing in the Photos App, is a relatively fast and powerful tool. If you tap the eraser icon, Clean Up analyzes the photo and suggests objects for deletion. I let it choose all the background people in a photo of me and Olympian Stephen Nedoroscik. I tapped on each one, and it removed them and did its best to replace them with a background that made sense. This was a tight shot, though, and Clean Up probably didn't have enough background information to guess properly.\nIt did better with a photo from Paris \u2013 I kept tapping on people to delete them, and the result made it look like they were never there. Sorry, fellow tourists.\nDuring my tests, Create Memories never worked for me, not because it's broken, but because the system can take days to index all of your photos and start to respond to natural language prompts. I'll reserve judgment on this feature for now.\nApple Intelligence has several useful features, like email summaries and the aforementioned Clean Up, but it mostly feels unfinished. There's no image creation, Genmojis, truly conversational AI, third-party LLM support (ChatGPT), or Siri insights into apps so it can help you not just with general prompts and queries but in getting things done with your favorite apps using just your voice.\nAll of that is to come. What's more, even when you do get Apple Intelligence, which I expect will be with the first iOS 18.1 public beta, it won't be enabled by default. You have to enable it in settings and get on a waiting list, though in my experience, the wait can be as short as a few minutes. Still, not turning this on by default when competitors like Google and Samsung are making their AI wares so rich and easy to find seems like a mistake on Apple's part.\nIf Apple is hoping this version of Apple Intelligence will launch a billion upgrades, it may be fooling itself.\n- Software score: 4 / 5\nApple iPhone 16 Pro review: Cameras\n- Nice updates on two of the three rear lenses\n- Undertone and Moods are fun, if maybe not useful\n- The Camera Control button could be a big deal\nSmartphone photography is important, but it may be playing second fiddle to Apple Intelligence on the iPhone 16 Pro. Apple has certainly showed care in its handful of camera updates, but nothing here is a major leap.\nWith the iPhone 16 Pro (and Pro Max) we get a faster 48 MP fusion main camera, a 48MP ultrawide (up from 12MP), and, thankfully, the same 12MP 5x optical zoom that you'll find on the iPhone 16 Pro Max. While this lens is not a major technology upgrade, it is a big deal for the 16 Pro, since the 15 Pro only had a 3x optical zoom camera.\nLast year I chose the larger 15 Pro Max because it was the only way to get the bigger zoom (I still dream of a 10x optical zoom on these Pros). Now I might be able to go back to the lighter (though larger than last year's) Pro model.\nThe other camera is the 12MP TrueDepth, which is similarly unchanged.\nThere are a total of four lenses but Apple breaks it up into millimeter lens options: macro lens, 13mm ultrawide, 24mm, 28mm, classic 35mm, 48mm 2x, and the 120mm zoom lens. Using them might make you feel more like a professional photographer but the different lens choices also have a real impact on the look and feel of your photos. You may learn, for example, that you're a 28mm photographer, or that 2x zoom is where you want your visual style to live.\nUltimately, these are all good lenses, and I was impressed with the improved macro capabilities of the new ultrawide sensor; although if I set my iPhone 15 Pro to the same raw settings, the differences between images from the iPhone 16 Pro and the 15 Pro were less noticeable.\nThe main 48MP camera shoots excellent, color-accurate photos. It's supposed to be faster, so I tested the capture speed with birds in flight and people rushing by in New York City's Penn Station. When compared to the iPhone 15 Pro's main camera, the iPhone 16 seemed to stop the action in its tracks, and even in less-than-optimal lighting situations there was no blur on people's moving feet. Outside, the lens caught a pigeon in flight and left the motion blur behind.\nNight-time astro photography is good, too, with the phone accurately capturing the colors of the night sky, and more stars than I can perceive with my own eyes.\nVideo gets an upgrade, too, with the iPhone 16 Pro now able to capture 4K 120 fps (no 8K yet, folks, although I'm not sure who needs it right now). That high frame rate means you can slow the video way down, and and do so in dramatic increments.\nApple calls this Cinematic Slow Motion, and it is, but I took that to mean there was an update to the Cinematic video mode Apple introduced a few generations back. No, this is just a way to incrementally, and dramatically, slow down high-resolution, high-frame-rate video. There's a new video Speed control under edit that offers four options: 20%, which is 24fps, 25% (30fps), 50% (60fps), and the default 120fps (100%).\nI tried it on clips of people walking through the park and found it fun, easy to use, and, yes, very dramatic.\nI think I'm even more impressed with the new Audio Mix video editing tool. As the name implies, this lets you remix your audio as one might in a studio for a much better and clearer result.\nThere are a few options: Standard, In-Frame, Studio, and Cinematic.\nIn-Frame focuses the audio on what's in the camera frame. I tried this in the park and it worked somewhat, but I think the audio environment was simply too chaotic for it to be truly effective. I also tried it with video playing on my iPad. I ran video of characters speaking on-screen but I would turn the iPhone 16 Pro to the screen and away from it to see how well it pumped up the audio when the characters were in the frame. Again, the results were good, though imperfect.\nI had better luck with Studio, which I used to fix audio I shot in one of our office meeting booths. There's ambient noise and a fan inside, which makes recording without a mic almost impossible. But not for Apple's Audio mix. I applied it to some voice-over videos I recorded, and the quality difference was remarkable. Well done, Apple, I'll be using this all the time.\nApple now has an enhanced set of image control features under Styles that can pre-process or post-process your images. Undertones adjust skin tone while trying to leave the rest of the photo untouched (it still touches the rest a bit). Options include Standard, Amber, Gold, Rose Gold, Neutral, and Cool Rose. Moods, meanwhile, change the look of the entire image.\nYou access both controls through a new grid icon in the upper-right of the Camera app. Swiping left changed the Mood (Vibrant, Natural, Luminous, Dramatic, Quiet, Cozy, Ethereal, Muted B&W, and Stark B&W). You can also adjust and create your own Moods or Undertones by dragging the center point in the grid, which appears below the viewfinder window.\nIf you want people's skin to look a certain way, then you may enjoy Undertones; however, I appreciate the iPhone 16 Pro's ability to capture true skin tones and colors, so using these Style features doesn't really appeal to me. If you're more creative, you might love all this control, and some of the resulting pictures certainly do capture a \"mood.\"\nThe biggest change in iPhone photography, though, does not come from Styles or even the latest sensors, it's the brand-new Camera Control...er...button. Apple is not calling it a button, though that's what it is: a button with a lot of features.\nCamera Control lives on one long side of the iPhone 16 Pro, a couple of inches away from the power button. If you hold the phone in landscape mode it's like a camera shutter button.\nOne press and it opens the camera up. If you press again, it takes a photo. However, there's some hidden magic in this control. Under the sapphire cover is a touch-sensitive surface that responds to pressure, delivering haptic response, and gestures.\nAs a result, I can gently press once to access controls, or double-press to go a level deeper on settings. Once there, I scroll through them with gestures. I could, for instance, use the button to select the camera and then swipe through my lenses. I can also use it to adjust zoom, exposure, and f-stops for my bokeh effect.\nIt's a powerful little button that works really well in landscape mode, but is a bit harder to use if you hold the phone in portrait mode. Even so, I like the button and am excited that it'll eventually be used to control more than just the camera. One upcoming feature is the ability to point it at things, press, and get Visual Intelligence about whatever's in the camera. Third-party apps are already tapping into it. Snapchat will let you take photos, apply filters, and send the image to a friend, all with the Camera Control. Another upcoming feature that I have to wonder why it's not live now is the ability to press gently to focus on your subject and then fully to take the photo. Yes, that's exactly how a regular camera works, and I can't wait to see it on an iPhone.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro is also capable of shooting spatial photos and videos. There's even a new Spatial option in the Camera app. I shot some spatial video, transferred it to a Vision Pro headset, and viewed it there. Not many people have VR headsets, so this feature might be a limited utility, at least for now.\nApple iPhone 16 Pro camera samples\n- Camera score: 4.5 / 5\nApple iPhone 16 Pro review: Performance\n- A18 Pro is one powerful SoC\n- Not as much memory as competitors but it's enough\nApple's now yearly habit of stuffing its iPhones with more processing power than most mere mortals can use continues with the iPhone 16 Pro (and Pro Max). Its new A18 Pro pushed the envelope on all of our benchmarks and still outperforms the best that Qualcomm and Google have to offer. Even with only 8GB of RAM (compared to the 12GB in a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and Google Pixel 9 Pro), the iPhone 16 Pro is a bit of a speed demon.\nIn my tests it was capable of 4K video edits, AAA gaming with Death Stranding and Resident Evil (helped by a new game mode that prioritizes gaming tasks) and numerous everyday tasks. Like the Phone 16 Pro Max, the iPhone 16 Pro gets a little wam, though not as much as the larger phone. Again, this may be down to more efficient heat dissipation.\nCall quality was good, and I'm pleased to see that this is now a future-leaning platform with Wi-Fi 7 support. There's also Bluetooth 5.3 support and second-generation Ultrawideband.\nIn the US, the iPhone is eSIM only, which I like, but some people might miss the physical SIM card.\nApple also upgraded its satellite services. In addition to Emergency SOS where you can text and even share your location, photos, and videos with emergency services, there's now the ability to send and review text messages via satellite with anyone, even when you're not in an emergency, although I couldn't find a cellular dead zone to test this. The satellite service is currently free for the first two years of iPhone ownership.\n- Performance score: 4.5 / 5\nApple iPhone 16 Pro review: Battery\n- Battery life upgrade\n- Qi 2 support\n- No adapter included\nThe iPhone 16 Pro lasts a robust 14 hours (on average) in our Future Labs battery-drain tests. It appears that battery life is as much as four hours better than it was with the iPhone 15 Pro. That's a significant jump. Anecdotally, I saw anywhere from 10 to 18 hours depending on activities, although of course your mileage may vary depending on what you're doing with your phone.\nThe Qi-2 wireless charging support is welcome and it means that, with the right charging adapter and MagSafe charger, you can get a much faster charge. Apple supplied me with is 30W charger and the new Qi-2 MagSafe charger. In my tests, I charged from 0-to-46% in 30 minutes. That's pretty close to the promised 0-to-50% in 30 minutes.\nIf and when your iPhone 16 Pro battery sees its last big recharge the replacement process may be simpler. In the entire iPhone 16 line Apple has replaced the stretch-release adhesives that usually hold the battery in place with an ionic liquid that reacts to a low voltage charge (yes, even from a 9V battery) to release the spent battery. It sounds like a science experiment, but one I want to see.\n- Battery score: 4.5 / 5\nShould you buy the Apple iPhone 16 Pro?\n| Attributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\n| Value | The price holds on this lovely and slightly larger phone but the value would be better with more storage | 4 / 5 |\n| Design | Iconic design with excellent materials and a brand-new hardware feature | 4.5 / 5 |\n| Display | Slightly larger display but the resolution is unchanged.

You can get in on the ground floor now, though.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou want the biggest screen possible with the highest resolution\nApple's iPhone 16 Pro's 6.3-inch display is larger than before but dwarfs in comparison to the iPhone 16 Pro Max's larger 6.9-inch display. And the higher pixel-per-inch can be found on displays from Samsung and Google.\nYou want more AI\nApple intelligence is an exciting start but it's far from finished, and there are other phones from Samsung and Google that hold nothing back on the AI front.\nApple iPhone 16 Pro review: Also consider\nApple's latest flagship iPhone not exciting you? here are a few alternatives from the Android frontier.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro\nThis may be the best and most fully realized AI phone, with deeply embedded Google Gemini that powers loads of camera and intelligence tricks. It's an attractive handset with good-enough performance that might help you forget that you walked away from iOS.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 5\nIf you were holding out hope for an iPhone Fold, Samsung's fantastic foldable could be the next best thing.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is so thin and light that, combined with its larger cover screen, you could easily mistake it for a standard flagship. There's a larger 8-inch display inside, and all this, plus the new camera system \u2013 the main camera finally gets a 200MP sensor \u2013 make this the most desirable Z Fold yet. It's a shame though that it's also the most expensive Fold to date for some \u2013 and that, ultimately, may hold it back.\nPros\n- +\nThe thinnest and lightest Z Fold phone yet\n- +\n200MP main camera\n- +\nUnexpectedly useful AI integration\nCons\n- -\nNo 5x zoom\n- -\nNo S Pen support\n- -\nSo expensive\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7: One-minute review\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the closest thing to a tech inflection point we have at the moment. It's by far the best large-screen foldable ever made \u2013 super-thin, super-light, exquisitely made, undeniably powerful, and full of AI smarts \u2013 and goes straight to the top of our list of the best foldable phones you can buy.\nIt's Samsung's first foldable to almost entirely not underdeliver on cameras, featuring the line's first-ever 200-megapixel camera. This feels like more than progress; it's a folding phone revolution.\nI like it so much that I find myself frantically searching for weaknesses. I probe each part looking for a place where Samsung may have miscalculated and, with very few exceptions, I can't find any weaknesses.\nIf I had to pinpoint where Samsung trips up, it would be in two areas: the removal of the digitizing layer, which leaves the Galaxy Z Fold 7 unable to work with the S Pen, and the price, which now flirts with $2,000 in the US. That's a lot to spend for any phone, though in fairness this really is like two devices in one \u2013 a flagship phone and 8-inch tablet \u2013 and so you might be able to justify the outlay.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 review: price and specs\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 starts at $1,999.99 / \u00a31,799 / AU$2,899, which is $100 more than the previous model in the US, and AU$150 more in Australia \u2013 there's no price hike for buyers in the UK. The base model comes with 256GB of storage and 12GB of RAM. At the time of writing, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is on preorder now, and ships from July 25. It's available in Blue Shadow, Silver Shadow, and Jetblack, plus a Samsung online-exclusive Mint.\nThose prices make the Galaxy Z Fold 7 one of the most expensive foldables you can buy \u2013 in the US it now costs $100 more than a similarly configured Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, for instance. There will be deals, especially for trade-ins, so look out for those.\nI agree, this is a lot to pay for a smartphone, but the Z Fold 7 is not just a phone. It's also a tablet, yet so thin and light that someone glancing at it in your hand might have no idea it's a two-in-one. The question is, are you willing to pay more for something that is truly special?\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 |\n|---|---|\nDimensions (folded): | 72.8 x 158.4 x 8.9mm |\nDimensions (unfolded): | 143.2 x 158.4 x 4.2mm |\nWeight: | 215g |\nMain display: | 8-inch QXGA+ Dynamic AMOLED (2184 x 1968), 120Hz adaptive refresh rate (1~120Hz) |\nCover display:: | 6.5-inch FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED |\nChipset: | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Mobile Platform for Galaxy |\nRAM: | 12GB / 16GB (1TB only) |\nStorage: | 256GB / 512GB / 1TB |\nOS: | Android 16 / One UI 8 |\nPrimary camera: | 200MP f1.7 |\nUltrawide camera: | 12MP f2.2 |\nTelephoto | 3x 10MP f2.4 |\nCover Camera: | 10MP f2.2 |\nInner Camera: | 10MP f2.2 |\nBattery: | 4,400mAh |\nCharging: | 30 mins with 25W adapter (wired) |\nColors: | Blue Shadow, Silver Shadow and Jetblack [Samsung.com Exclusive] Mint |\n- Value score: 4 / 5\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review: design\n- Super-thin unfolded, and almost as thin as a standard smartphone when folded\n- Weighs less than the single-screen Galaxy S25 Ultra\n- Excellent materials and construction\n- Hinge mechanism is pleasingly stiff and strong\nIf you think the pace of smartphone and flagship innovation feels somewhat ho-hum, you probably haven't seen or touched the new Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nThis is one of the best design upgrades I've seen in a while, not because it's radically different to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 that came before it, because it isn't, but because it's so much better in all the ways that truly matter.\nI'll start with the physical specs, because they're the most remarkable thing about of this new handset, especially when compared with the Z Fold 6 and, yes, even the Galaxy S25 Ultra.\nUnfolded, the Z Fold 7 is just 4.2mm thick \u2013 that's 1.4mm thinner than the Z Fold 6. Folded, the Z Fold 7 is 8.9mm, 3.2mm thinner than the Z Fold 6 and only 0.7mm thicker than the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Think about that: this foldable, which when folded is hiding a gorgeous 8-inch display, is almost imperceptibly thicker than a single-screen flagship device.\nEven the weight is impressive. Between versions, Samsung shed a whopping 24 grams, and the Fold 7 is even 3 grams lighter than the S25 Ultra. Yep \u2013 two screens, and it's still lighter than the flagship.\nPerhaps that shouldn't be so surprising. When I hold the Z Fold 7 up to the S25 ultra, the foldable is smaller than the Ultra, which is 162.8mm x 77.6mm, while the Z Fold 7, when folded, is 158.4mm x 72.8mm.\nCarrying the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is now like holding a secret. At a glance, it looks like a standard, 6.5-inch smartphone. It's not until you take a closer look that you notice the seam down one edge and the hinge on the opposite side.\nSize and weight aside, the phone feels good in my hand because of the excellent materials. Its Armor Aluminum frame is covered, front and back, with Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2. A substantial, pill-shaped three-camera array sticks out of the back. Whenever I put the phone down camera-side-first, it tips at an awkward angle. I guess that's the price I have to pay for a better imaging system.\nOn the top edges when you're holding the phone (there are two when it's folded) are a pair of microphone holes, a vent, and a SIM slot (yes, this phone still uses a nanoSIM card, along with a multi-eSIM option).\nThe bottom edges feature more microphone holes, a speaker slot (its stereo pair are along the top edge of the cover screen), and the USB-C data and charging port. The tolerances here are quite something \u2013 the USB port appears to just barely fit in the space.\nThe only buttons are the long volume rocker and the power / fingerprint reader / Gemini button.\nThe foldable screen hinge, which has been shrinking over each Z Fold generation, is the thickness of an average No. 2 pencil, and its subtlety and unobtrusiveness further help it pull off the 'standard flagship' masquerade.\nSamsung has reengineered the hinge, and it's noticeable. The phone is firmly closed when folded (magnets inside help with that) and has considerable, but not overly resistant, tension as you open it and it snaps into position as a fully flat 8-inch tablet.\nUnfolding the phone you're greeted with a flexible display surrounded by a roughly 2mm, forgiving raised border that keeps the Fold 7 from making a metallic snapping sound when you close it.\nThere's still a crease, but it's far less pronounced than what you see on the Z Fold 6. That's due in part to the new teardrop-shaped screen fold hidden in the redesigned hinge, meaning the thin, flexible screen curves into a perhaps more forgiving teardrop shape when the phone is folded. This is likely what accounts for how it can more easily unfold to a nearly perfectly flat plane. I can only see whatever minimal crease remains at certain odd angles, and more so when the screen is off. To the touch, it's barely perceptible.\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is IP48-rated, which means it can handle a sustained dunk in fresh water (not salt water!), but I would keep it away from dust and sand. I ran my device under a tap with no ill effects.\n- Design score: 5 / 5\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7: displays\n- The main display is now 8 inches\n- There's a noticeable punch hole for the camera\n- The cover display is also larger\nA wider and taller Z Fold means not one, but two bigger screens. The cover display is now a 6.5-inch 21:9 display that is finally indistinguishable from a standard flagship phone display.\nWhere the Z Fold 6 has a 968 x 2376 resolution, the Z Fold 7 cover screen is an expansive 2520 x 1080, 422ppi, 1-to-120Hz AMOLED 2X screen. It has a punch-hole for the 10MP selfie camera, but it does not feature an under-the-screen fingerprint reader \u2013 that's integrated with the power button (and works quite nicely, as does unlocking with your face).\nIt's a lovely, bright screen that's now wide enough to more easily accommodate a more usable virtual keyboard, and fully serviceable when you don't want to unfold and use the main display.\nLike the cover display, the main display is larger this year. It's now an 8-inch display, up from the Z Fold 6's 7.6 inches. It's also got more pixels, jumping from 2160 x 1856 to 2184 x 1968. It's still QXGA+ and supports the dynamic 1-to-120Hz refresh rate.\nWhile that display size now matches Apple's iPad mini, the sixth-generation mini's 8-inch screen has an aspect ratio of 3:2, while the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is now 5:6. This makes the Z Fold 7 more of a square as compared to the iPad's slightly rectangular display.\nIn practice, this means that on the Z Fold 7 some videos and games may have larger black borders at the top and bottom. It doesn't bother me, but you might want to see what Netflix looks like on the phone before placing your order.\nThe main screen is big, bright, and responsive. It was useful in bright sunlight, and all motion looked fluid and smooth. I left it on the default setting, which lets the system adjust the refresh rate on the fly, up to 120Hz and down to 1Hz, which is not as energy efficient as locking in at 60Hz. Both screens are rated for a max brightness of 2,500 nits.\nIn Future Labs testing and with HDR enabled we got up to 2,245 nits on the main screen and 2,060 nits on the cover screen. Those are admirable numbers, and mean you shouldn't have any trouble viewing these displays in direct sunlight.\nTo achieve the 4.2mm thickness, Samsung made some changes to the panel configuration, most notably dropping the digitizing layer that, in the Z Fold 6, offered support for specially tipped S Pens. I was initially pretty upset about this, but I did find that I could still draw with my finger \u2013 it's not as precise, but it's not terrible, and I can still use my finger to mark up images for Generative Editing and Sketch to Image. My doodles for the latter are not as good as those drawn with an S Pen, but the screen had no trouble interpreting my rough sketch and transforming it into a very realistic mouse.\nI can report, though, that while the S Pen or any digitizing stylus will not work, a classic dumb, capacitive-compliant stylus \u2013 one you can buy for six bucks on Amazon \u2013 does work with the display. It won't record pressure or angle, but it makes it a lot easier to draw.\nThe other thing you might notice on this new Galaxy Fold 7 display is the noticeably larger camera punch hole. It's not only bigger in order to accommodate a better, 10MP camera (it was just 4MP on the Fold 6); the hole is also no longer covered with pixels, so it remains visible at all times. It's positioned a tiny bit more centrally along the top edge than the punch hole on the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold's flexible display, on which the equally large hole is positioned towards the far-right corner and is maybe a bit more out of sight.\nThese things aside, I love this big, multi-tasking screen, which has room for a couple of apps, or larger-screen views of favorite apps like Weather and Maps. It's also a nice canvas for Gemini Live, which makes the most of the larger space.\nI also enjoyed drawing on it, streaming shows on Netflix, and playing action games.\nThe benefit of a flexible screen is that the Galaxy Fold 7 doesn't have to be only flat or folded \u2013 it can also be 'L' shaped, which I found useful when I was checking over an interview transcription, which I recorded and used AI to transcribe on the Fold. A 90-degree fold also proved useful for watching videos on one half of the screen while the rest of the Fold served as a steady base.\n- Displays score: 4.5 / 5\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7: cameras\n- 200MP sensor is the upgrade the Fold line needed\n- Main-display camera is no longer an afterthought\n- The cameras are capable of some beautiful photography\nThere was nothing much wrong with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6's camera array. It has a nice 50MP lens, a 10MP, and a 3x optical zoom 10MP, but I was very aware that this was a flagship-class phone with a flagship-level price, and it bothered me that the best camera array was reserved for Samsung's Ultra line.\nThat is no longer the case. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 has a new camera system, with two notable upgrades and one disappointment.\nHere's the full camera system:\n- 200MP wide\n- 12MP ultra-wide\n- 10MP 3x telephoto\n- 10MP cover-screen\n- 10MP main-screen\nThe big news here is the new 200MP sensor that, while similar to what's found in the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, has been reengineered to fit into the Z Fold 7's super-slim frame.\nLike most high-megapixel smartphone cameras, this one defaults to a 12MP shot, combining (or pixel-binning) the information from multiple pixels for better clarity, contrast, and colors. It does a nice job, but there is a very good reason to shoot at the full 200MP (it's easy to do \u2013 you just select between 12MP, 50MP, or 200MP): doing so lets you crop into almost any picture detail without losing clarity.\nYou can see some of my sample photos above. While the detail is excellent, I did notice that I probably need to stand a bit more still if I plan to crop in on these huge, full-resolution images. No matter what, though, I love that this sensor, with all the versatility it affords, is included.\nWhile there's now closer parity between the Galaxy Ultra and this Galaxy Fold, the latter can perform a trick that's impossible with the S25 Ultra: you can shoot selfies with the main camera using the 'Cover Screen Preview' setting. This means that if you unfold the phone and choose that option in the camera app, you can use the cover screen as a viewfinder and control for the main, wide-angle, and telephoto lenses. I used the setting to take a 200MP selfie \u2013 I would show it to you, but the clarity is so good it's horrifying.\nI'm also pleased that the main-screen camera is now a full 10MP \u2013 4MP for selfies and even video calls seemed a bit anemic. The tradeoff for that better camera is a bigger punch-hole in the flexible display, and one that isn't covered with pixels when not in use. I think future Z Folds should shift this camera closer to one of the bezels.\nThe 12MP wide-angle has a solid 120-degree field of view, enough for some truly dramatic shots, but I think its macro capabilities are far more impressive. Look at the detail in the flowers below. Leave aside the excellent color accuracy \u2013 just look at the drama inside these blossoms, and in particular the ants transiting the petals. Well done on this lens, Samsung.\nI'm less impressed with the zoom lens; not because it's bad, but it remains underpowered for a flagship. While the S25 Ultra has a nice 10MP 5x optical zoom, the now more ultra-y Fold 7 only gets a 10MP 3x optical zoom. Yes, I am fully aware of the Space Zoom options that go up to 30x, but that's a digital assist, and drags in way too much artificial information for my tastes. When I want zoom, I like it to be optical all the way.\nThe 3x optical zoom does a nice job, and it's definitely useful, just not as strong as I had hoped. In situations where you want to get closer to a subject you might instead choose to shoot with the 200MP main camera at full resolution and then crop in on the detail you want \u2013 at least you know the visual information will all be real, and not partially digitally generated.\nI was also pleased with low-light photography and videography. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 shoots high-quality video up to 8K 30fps, though many video editors still can't handle that video resolution.\nOverall, I think this is a great camera system, especially because Samsung's ProVisual Engine is finally doing a decent job of maintaining visual fidelity (unless you choose less-real presets).\nThe colors in all my shots are good and accurate \u2013 I'm impressed with how the cameras handle challenging Manhattan street shots that are so full of detail and riotous colors.\nThey also did well with backlit shots where a bright Manhattan sky might have overwhelmed the foreground \u2013 I think the Z Fold 7 found a decent balance. When I tapped on the sky to adjust the exposure in favor of the sky I got better cloud detail, but also surprisingly accurate blue sky color. Nothing is too saturated, and this I consider a victory.\nPortrait mode does a nice job on people and objects, such as in my image of planter in the main gallery above, where it had a lot of detail to handle and acquitted itself nicely. It\u2019s not perfect \u2013 some small leaves got lost \u2013 but I\u2019m still pleased with the result.\n- Cameras score: 4.5 / 5\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7: Software and AI\n- The phone will ship with Android 16\n- There's deeper Google Gemini integration\n- Gemini Live fills the main screen\nIn the software space, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is a harbinger of releases to come. It's the first flagship to release with Android 16, well ahead of the next big Pixel launches \u2013 including, we expect, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold \u2013 on August 20, and it also has the latest Samsung software in the form of One UI 8.\nThat former landmark is by Google design, with the tech giant rearranging its development flow to ensure that its big partners have these new releases in time for their latest flagship phones. As for the latter, Samsung just seems to be getting faster and more efficient at updating and improving its own Android overlay.\nBoth platforms are also infused with AI in the form of Samsung's Galaxy AI and Google's Gemini, though where one ends and the other begins may not always be obvious.\nBroadly, Android is now as polished and useful as Apple's iOS. It has many of the same features, including Live Updates in widgets, Quick Share (so much like AirDrop), and endless customization. It's also a fantastic partner for the Fold because the platform is optimized for the larger 8-inch screen, so things like mail, weather, and maps all appear built for the flexible display. Even Google Gemini Live is right at home on the Galaxy Z Fold 7's main display.\nOne UI 8 brings things like the Now Bar and Now Brief, a compendium of all the things you need to know at any point in the day. It's well designed, accessible, and relatively useful. I check it because the Now Bar is always greeting me on my lock screen with a \"Good morning!\", \"Good afternoon!\" or \"Good evening!\" and it almost seems rude not to acknowledge it by digging into the details of my Brief.\nWhen I tap to open it, I see a weather forecast, a calendar of events, news of interest, and music. I can choose to add more elements from my phone, which I assume might make the Brief more useful.\nThere is, of course, a lot of AI on this phone. Google handles the Circle to Search and Gemini side, and the rest of the AI found on the phone is Samsung Galaxy AI.\nAt any point I can long-press the home-screen button to launch a Circle to Search task. After the press, I use my finger to circle something on the screen that Google Search can look at and offer results related to.\nNew here is the ability for Circle to Search to work in games. I used it while playing the racing game Asphalt 9 and PUBG. It works, but it's not necessarily intuitive to bring up the home button and press it during gameplay. On the other hand, I do appreciate not having to leave the game or even capture a screenshot. I just long-press, circle, and Google Search does the rest. When I'm done, I return to the race.\nGemini is summoned by a long press of the power button. It has all the strength of Gemini 2.5 Flash on the web, and also Gemini Live. Gemini Live works in full-screen mode on the large main display, but I find it more useful when you share your screen with Gemini Live and it then operates in the background, offering insights based on what it can see on-screen and the questions you ask it.\nYou can also just have Gemini look through the camera and see your world, and ask it what it sees \u2013 unless you want everyone to hear your Gemini Live conversation, this would be a good time to invest in some Galaxy Buds Pro 3 headphones if you plan to be out and about with the Z Fold 7.\nOther Galaxy AI-powered features remain, and are little changed from the last time I tested them on a Fold. I can use Sketch to Image to instantly add photo-realistic elements to existing photos \u2013 I added a mouse to my coffee table, although as I've mentioned it's a bit harder to sketch the right image idea without an S Pen.\nIt's also easy to remove unwanted objects from images and replace them with the right background. This, depending on the size of the object, is generally effective, though there do seem to be more steps than in Apple's Clean Up. On the Fold, I scribble on what I want to remove (it can be multiple objects), hit the erase icon, and the phone removes them, but I also have to hit 'Generate' to replace the background. My iPhone 16 Pro Max does both in one step.\nDrawing Assist, which lets you turn rough doodles into much higher-quality artwork and is another feature that benefited from S Pen support, also still works, and may come in even more handy now that you'll likely be forced to use your fingertip to make your rough sketch.\nGalaxy AI's reach extends to video, and I used Audio Eraser to clean up the sound on a video shot in the heart of New York City's Times Square. The capabilities more or less match those in Apple's Audio Mix tool, although how the tools pinpoint which extraneous sounds to target differs quite a bit. Audio Eraser focuses on crowd noise, voices, and wind, and the results were good, though my voice did end up sounding just a tiny bit robotic, although not dissimilar from the results I got with Audio Mix the Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max.\nI am, naturally, only scratching the surface of Android 16, One UI, and their AI capabilities, which also include things like Live Translation, Text Translation, and Chat Assist. Overall, though, this is a platform I could easily love. If you're already an Android fan, Android 16 will be a welcome upgrade. If you've used a Galaxy before, One UI will be instantly familiar but also improved. The AI is deeply embedded but never intrusive. It looks and feels the way I thought Apple Intelligence would on an iPhone, and how I hope it will look and feel when Apple eventually delivers the updated Siri.\n- Software and AI score: 4.5 / 5\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7: Performance and Battery\n- Custom Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor\n- Plenty of RAM and strong overall performance\n- Battery is still 4,400mAh, but all-day battery life is real\nNot only does the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 pack Qualcomm's best silicon, it's a customized chip produced just for Samsung's latest foldable: the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Samsung. The difference between the standard Elite and the Samsung version is small but notable: most reports put the 8 Elite's max clock speed on its 2-core cluster at 4.32GHz. On the Galaxy Z Fold 7, according to Geekbench 6, it's running at 4.47GHz. The six-core cluster is running at 3.53Ghz, which is the same speed as the standard 8 Elite.\nSamsung backs this powerful, AI-ready silicon with 12GB of RAM for the 256GB Z Fold 7. The 1 TB model gets 16GB of memory.\nI ran Geekbench 6 three times for both the CPU and GPU, and the numbers are impressive. This is the first time in memory that an Android phone's multicore performance has beaten the latest flagship iPhone; in this case the iPhone 16 Pro Max.\nHere are my average numbers:\n- Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7\n- Single-core Avg: 2,512\n- Multi-core Avg: 8,986.67\n- OpenCL: 17,391\niPhone 16 Pro Max - Single-core: 2,892\n- Multi-core: 8,327\n- GPU Metal Score 33,001\nYes, Samsung (really Qualcomm) beat Apple on the multi-core scores. It may look like Apple handily beat Qualcomm on the GPU side, but those numbers (OpenCL versus Metal) are not directly comparable. What matters here, though, is the performance, and the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 has power to spare.\nI found it fast and fun for everything from web browsing to video games and video editing.\nI tried stressing out the system by opening 51 tabs in Chrome and Gemini Live, which is probably a more resource-intensive operation. A funny side note here: when I allowed Gemini Live to view my screen and asked it how many browser tabs I had open, it said \"10.\" I tried to guide it to the number listed next to the microphone icon, and it said \"11\". When I pointed out its error, Gemini Live apologized and said it had no idea why it made that mistake.\nI wasn't done pushing the system, so I also launched PUBG. The game opened without issue, I started to play (quickly, to my delight, finding an ultralight aircraft to fly around the island) and the phone never skipped a beat (the back got a little warm). I even used Circle to Search to learn more about a car I found.\nPut another way, this is a thin, light, and very powerful system, and it's ready to multitask like the private productivity wonder it is. Plus, there's now true differentiation between the Fold 7 and its little sibling, the Galaxy Flip 7, which runs the ostensibly less powerful Samsung Exynos 2500 processor. That's a fun little foldable phone with a full-screen cover that can accommodate Gemini Live, but it's not about getting things done. And that's the beauty of the Z Fold 7: with its now standard flagship-sized cover screen and even larger 8-inch main screen, it's the perfect blend of pocket-sized power and portability.\nAudio performance out of the stereo speakers is loud but also clear. Do not expect booming bass, but if you want the Fold 7 to power a party via your Spotify playlist \u2013 which, yes, you can summon through Gemini \u2013 the Fold 7 has you covered.\nBattery life for the 4,400mAh battery is rated by Samsung at 24 hours of video playback. However, in mixed use, battery life is anecdotally between 12 and 18 hours in my tests. Future Labs, which runs a more rigorous and intense web-browsing rundown, got just under 11 hours. This is a case where your mileage will vary, but I think you can expect a full workday of battery life.\nThe Qi wireless charging is supported, and while the phone only ships with a charging cable and not the adapter, I was able to charge the phone to 50% in 30 minutes using a 45W charger.\nConnectivity on the T-Mobile 5G network was solid, and, in my neighborhood, better than what I get from Verizon. I'm also happy to report that the phone supports WiFi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4.\n- Performance and Battery score: 5 / 5\nShould you buy the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7?\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | The most expensive foldable out there, but it might also be worth it | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | Excellent, slim and light design that still feels elegant and solid. | 5 / 5 |\nDisplay | Two fantastic and now larger screens.
