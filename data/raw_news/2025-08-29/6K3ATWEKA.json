  "title": "People Use Intuition To Make Important Decisions Rather Than Advice: Study",
  "description": "People from diverse cultures and regions often make difficult decisions by relying on their intuition.",
  "content": "One of the most challenging aspects of adulthood is making decisions, such as who you choose to date or marry, how you invest your hard-earned money, or where you want to live and work. Although people often seek advice from others, they tend to disregard other people\u2019s suggestions and instead use their own intuition and self-reflection to make big life decisions, according to a recent study. The most surprising finding of the study was that people from diverse cultures and regions \u2014 whether from an industrialized country like the U.S. or an individual living in the Amazon rainforest \u2014 often make difficult decisions by relying on their intuition.\n\n\u201cAcross twenty samples from urban and rural communities across multiple continents and including two Indigenous communities, and in the face of six everyday dilemmas devised with local collaborators, people overwhelmingly preferred self-reliant strategies,\u201d the researchers wrote in their study. \u201cPrivate deliberation emerged as the modal preference in most societies, crowd wisdom the least preferred, and this hierarchy of self-reliant over advice-oriented strategies held in industrialized capitals, small towns, and Amazonian rainforest villages alike.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur data show that even the most interdependent samples prefer to deliberate privately, suggesting that interdependence does not translate into appetite for explicit advice. One plausible explanation is pragmatic: in tight networks characterizing interdependent societies, requesting counsel may impose costs, signal incompetence or create new obligations, making inner deliberation the safer, more socially considerate option,\u201d the study authors noted. \u201cAdditionally, seeking advice could force one to disclose personal information, which may be riskier in cultures with low relational mobility. By contrast, participants endorsing independent self-views appeared to choose self-reliance to affirm agency and competence. Thus, both cultural ecologies converge on the same behavioural endpoint\u2014deciding alone\u2014but for subtly different reasons.\u201d\n\nA group of researchers from the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, surveyed more than 3,500 people living in 12 countries in the Global North and Global South. The researchers chose participants who were residents of huge cities in the U.S., Germany, Canada, India, China, and also two small-scale indigenous communities in South American countries like Ecuador and Peru, among others. More than 50% of the participants were women.\n\nThe team then the participants face \u201csix dilemmas: some required choosing between two similarly attractive, incommensurable options, while others pitted self-interest against the interests of others. The scenarios were developed in consultation with the project\u2019s ethnographers and anthropologists,\u201d they explained.\n\nSome of the decisions the participants had to make involved deciding whether to buy an orchard or a herd of animals (for those from indigenous rural communities) and choosing the right university to pursue a degree, or selecting a travel destination. Other forms of decision-making that confronted the participants during the study period was deciding between helping a neighbor but at the expense of missing important work deadlines, or sacrificing time required to study/prepare for exams, or help a friend struggling with their personal problems.\n\n\u201cCritically, most scenarios involved decisions that had significant consequences for the decision-maker and others. For example, one study participant\u2019s decision to help his neighbour could significantly impact both parties\u2019 agricultural productivity, whereas an educational choice\u2014which university to attend\u2014could have long-term career implications,\u201d the study authors explained.\n\n\u201cWhen asked about their personal preference for a decision strategy, Stage 1 participants chose personal deliberation most often, ranging from 37% among Tamils and Meitei in India to 60% among English-speaking South Africans. Intuition was consistently the second most chosen strategy, ranging from 23% among the participants from China to 40% among the participants from Canada. In all countries, the two advice-oriented strategies were visibly less popular: preference for friends\u2019 advice ranged between 9% in South Africa and 22% among Tamils and Meitei, whereas wisdom of crowds advice was preferred only between 2% in Slovakia to 12% in Germany,\u201d they added.\n\nThe study was published in the journal, Proceedings of the Royal Society B Biological Sciences, in August 2025.",
