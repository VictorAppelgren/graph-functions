I wanted to share my experience trying the Ozzmosis burger at Rodeo Goat last week.\n\nDig in: The masterpiece, if I may say so, is going head-to-head with another specialty burger during the restaurant's Battle of the Burgers showdown.\n\nWhat to order: The Ozzmosis ($15) is made with a beef  and breakfast sausage patty, fried hash brown cake, bacon, a fried egg, American cheese, hollandaise, chives and raspberry jam.\n\nMy experience: From the first bite, I was floating. The crunch of the hash brown fry led to an explosion of the best hangover breakfast foods (it is named after Ozzy Osbourne, after all) on a bun.\n\nIf you go: 2105 Dallas St.",
