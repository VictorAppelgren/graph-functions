  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None Net loss (GAAP) narrowed to $6.1 million in Q2 2025, a 22.8% improvement from the prior-year period, driven by reduced research and development spending.\n\u2022 None No product revenue reported; The company\u2019s clinical-stage focus and cash balance of $10.4 million as of June 30, 2025, raise concerns about its funding runway.\n\u2022 None All key clinical data for brilaroxazine program completed; NDA submission targeted for Q2 2026 pending FDA feedback.\n\u2022 These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires \u203a\n\nReviva Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:RVPH), a clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in treatments for central nervous system and respiratory diseases, issued its second quarter results on August 14, 2025. The highlight of the release was the completion of key clinical studies for its lead drug candidate, brilaroxazine, marking a significant milestone on the path toward regulatory submission. The company reported a net loss of $6.1 million, or $(0.12) per share (GAAP), Revenue remained at zero, consistent with its precommercial status. Operating costs declined compared to the prior-year period. The period demonstrates progress in Reviva's clinical strategy, but its limited cash balance and continued need for external funding remain prominent.\n\nReviva Pharmaceuticals is focused on developing novel therapies for central nervous system disorders, with a particular emphasis on schizophrenia and related conditions. Its lead candidate, brilaroxazine, is an oral drug under development for several psychiatric and respiratory diseases, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\nRecently, its main effort has centered on moving brilaroxazine through advanced-stage clinical trials and preparing for regulatory submission. The company\u2019s success relies on demonstrating the clinical benefits of brilaroxazine, securing patents to protect its innovations, and funding ongoing research. Other key factors are advancing a second drug candidate, RP1208, and forming commercialization partnerships.\n\nReviva reported a GAAP net loss of $6.1 million, compared to $7.9 million in the prior-year period. Operating expenses (GAAP) dropped to $6.1 million, Research and development expenses (GAAP) decreased by 33.3% compared to the prior-year period. This reduction came as Reviva completed the major clinical work needed for its upcoming regulatory filing.\n\nThe company did not generate any revenue, which is typical for a biotechnology business before product launches. Meanwhile, the end-of-period cash balance (GAAP) was $10.4 million, down from $13.5 million as of December 31, 2024. This cash burn continues to indicate finite funding\u2014less than two quarters of operational runway is likely at the current spend rate, based on cash and cash equivalents of approximately $10.4 million and a net loss of approximately $6.1 million\u2014making future financing necessary for ongoing development work.\n\nThe most notable operational progress was the completion of all key clinical studies supporting a potential New Drug Application (NDA) for brilaroxazine in schizophrenia, pending FDA feedback on whether additional trials will be required. The company wrapped up its open-label extension (OLE) trial, which tracked patient outcomes over one year. In this study, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), a tool used to measure schizophrenia symptoms, showed improvements over one year in the open-label extension (OLE) trial: total score fell by 18.1 points, positive symptoms by 5.0, and negative symptoms by 4.4. The trial enrolled 446 patients and reported a 35% discontinuation rate after one year in the OLE trial of brilaroxazine for schizophrenia.\n\nReviva raised $10.0 million in gross proceeds through a public equity offering during Q2 2025. However, this resulted in increased dilution for shareholders, as shares outstanding rose to 68.0 million as of June 30, 2025, up from 46.6 million as of December 31, 2024. Total stockholders\u2019 equity (GAAP) turned negative, at $(0.46) million as of Q2 2025, highlighting a balance sheet risk and the potential for future Nasdaq compliance issues.\n\nAlthough the company continues to mention intellectual property initiatives and sees the potential for patent coverage extending to 2045 and beyond, it provided few specifics on new filings or exclusivity length in this period, though management restated its intent to seek commercial partners as the regulatory process advances. The pipeline expanded as well, with an investigational new drug (IND) application planned for a new formulation of brilaroxazine in psoriasis by mid-2026.\n\nLooking Ahead: Financial Outlook and Key Events\n\nManagement did not offer any formal financial guidance for the year or forthcoming quarters. The expected end-of-Phase 3 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is scheduled for the last quarter of 2025. If the outcome is positive, Reviva will target an NDA submission for brilaroxazine in Q2 2026. There remains a risk that the FDA may request additional late-stage clinical trials, which could delay regulatory submission further. The company affirmed its intent to use the current data package, excluding the planned Phase 3 RECOVER-2 trial, for its NDA submission, with a potential NDA targeted for Q2 2026, but acknowledged that the regulatory path could shift if the agency seeks more clinical data.\n\nNo other significant events or changes in dividend policy were declared in this release. RVPH does not currently pay a dividend. Investors should continue to monitor Reviva's cash reserves, progress on regulatory milestones, feedback from the FDA, and any developments related to business partnerships or commercial plans for brilaroxazine.\n\nRevenue and net income presented using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) unless otherwise noted.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."
