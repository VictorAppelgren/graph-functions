  "title": "What Vance saw in Iraq",
  "description": "The vice president\u2019s four years in the Marine Corps planted the seeds of his populism \u2014 and his pursuit of power.",
  "content": "Vice President JD Vance once described himself as \u201ca young idealist\u201d when he deployed to Iraq as a Marine in 2005. But when he came back, he was different. \u201cI returned in 2006, skeptical of the war and the ideology that underpinned it,\u201d he wrote in The Lamp, a Catholic literary journal, in 2020.\n\nJust months after writing that, he leaped into the Ohio Senate race that ultimately set him on the path to the vice presidency.\n\nVance hasn\u2019t discussed his time in the military all that much since then. But what he saw in Iraq, back when he was still known as Cpl. James D. Hamel, left an indelible impression on Vance as a person \u2014 and on his politics.\n\n\u201cIn the Marine Corps, Vance began to form many of the ideas and inclinations that have come to define his broader political philosophy,\u201d writes Ian Ward in this week\u2019s Friday Read: \u201chis skepticism of political elites, his antagonism toward the news media, his ambivalent view of liberal democracy and even his restrictive ideas about immigration and American citizenship.\u201d\n\nWard\u2019s in-depth piece on how the military shaped Vance kicks off POLITICO Magazine\u2019s new War Issue. Over the course of next week, the magazine will publish an ambitious collection of deeply reported stories investigating the turbulent present and uncertain future of U.S. military dominance \u2014 and of warfare itself. You can read them on POLITICO, and you\u2019ll find all of them in next week\u2019s special edition of POLITICO Weekend.\n\nUntil then, we look back at the long shadow of Vance\u2019s four years in the Marines, \u201cone of the most formative periods in his young-adult life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to try and get to heaven, if possible. I\u2019m hearing I\u2019m not doing well. I am really at the bottom of the totem pole.\u201d\n\nCan you guess who dissed ... themselves? Scroll to the bottom for the answer.**\n\n\n\nWhere Are the Mass Protests? ... Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Washington in the summer of 2020 to protest the police killing of George Floyd and racial discrimination. But President Donald Trump\u2019s recent federal takeover of local law enforcement hasn\u2019t prompted anywhere near that level of protest. \u201cLocal elected officials, eager not to provoke the administration, have been diplomatic in expressing their dismay,\u201d writes Capital City columnist Michael Schaffer. \u201cNotably, the small protests I went to were dominated by dedicated activists. ... By contrast, there was little evidence of, you know, the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe FBI raided who? If you somehow missed the news about the bureau searching the home and office of former national security adviser John Bolton, not to worry. Just go undercover and drop these details into conversation at happy hour. No one will suspect a thing. (From Associate Editor Dylon Jones)\n\n\u2014 Hint at your familiarity with FBI and legal procedure with an insight into the paperwork: \u201cThey couldn\u2019t have gotten a search warrant without convincing a judge there was something they might find there. Could mean their investigation is pretty far along.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Challenge your friends to see who can name the most people who\u2019ve crossed Trump only to find themselves under some kind of federal probe or investigation. You can win if you memorize a bunch of them \u2014 just try to make it look natural, like you have to search for a couple: former FBI director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California, former CIA director John Brennan, former homeland security official Miles Taylor, and Democratic Virginia Rep. Eugene Vindman, whose twin brother \u2014 retired Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman \u2014 was a witness in Trump\u2019s first impeachment.\n\n\u2014 Share this analysis from Guardian reporter (and former POLITICO fellow) Joseph Gedeon to show off how much you know about the key players: \u201cFive of the people we just named were in FBI director Kash Patel\u2019s book, Government Gangsters: The Deep State, the Truth, and the Battle for Our Democracy, back in 2023. Remember this came up in his confirmation hearings? There was an appendix that had a list of 60 names in it. Patel denied that it was an enemies list, but five have been investigated within seven months.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Everyone will mention Bolton\u2019s memoir, The Room Where It Happened, and how the Justice Department failed to stop its publication with a lawsuit. But you\u2019ll be the only one sharp enough to remember: \u201cWhen they sued to try to prevent the book from publishing, they also went after Bolton\u2019s $2 million advance. Guess we\u2019ll see what it cost him. Even the judge who let the book go forward said that \u2018Bolton likely jeopardized national security interests by disclosing classified information\u2019 in violation of the NDA he signed when he joined Trump 1.0.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat Really Happened to Austin Tice? ... In 2012, 31-year-old journalist Austin Tice went missing in Syria. \u201cA rebel driver he knew was driving him from Darraya to Lebanon and safety,\u201d writes James Harkin. \u201cEn route, he simply vanished.\u201d For 13 years, the case befuddled multiple administrations, leaving his family without answers. But now, 13 years after Tice went missing, a \u201cdramatic recent development\u201d may have changed everything \u2014 and diminished the hope that he could still be alive.\n\n\n\nA Veteran Diplomat\u2019s Idea for Ukraine ... Trump has called for Ukraine and Russia to skip a ceasefire entirely and go straight for a peace agreement. But in a new interview, veteran diplomat Richard Haass \u2014 who has served under four presidents and negotiated over conflicts in Cyprus, the Middle East and Asia \u2014 tells Nahal Toosi that \u201cit\u2019s a big tactical error to rule out a ceasefire and go directly to final status [issues], because it\u2019s most likely to prolong the war and make it difficult, if not impossible, to succeed.\u201d He also said that despite what Trump may think, his personal relationship with Putin may not matter much at all.\n\n\n\nTrump Wants China Out of Panama ... In his inaugural address, Trump reiterated his view that China controlled the Panama Canal, pledging to take it back. But he\u2019s not stopping with the canal. Eight months later, Trump \u201chas looked far beyond the canal for ways to undercut Chinese influence in Panama,\u201d writes Jared Mitovich \u2014 \u201cand created a political headache for leaders here.\u201d That includes President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, who has faced national uproar over his perceived concessions to Trump.\n\n\n\nFrom the drafting table of editorial cartoonist Matt Wuerker.\n\n\n\n**Who Dissed? answer: It was Trump on Trump. He made the self-deprecating joke in a Fox & Friends interview about his attempt to negotiate a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, saying that if he \u201ccan get to heaven, this will be one of the reasons.\u201d",

He returned in 2006 and entered the Ohio Senate race shortly afterwards, where he later led to his rise to the presidency. This article discusses how the military influenced Vance's political philosophy, including his skepticism of political elites, antagonism towards the news media, his ambivalent view of liberal democracy, and restrictive ideas about immigration and American citizenship. It also highlights the impact of the Iraq War Issue on the future of U.S. military dominance and warfare itself. Despite mass protests by hundreds of thousands in Washington in 2020, President Donald Trump's recent takeover of local law enforcement has not yet led to significant protests. The article also discusses the FBI's raid on the home and office of former national security adviser John Bolton, which could indicate a significant federal investigation.",

      "text": "When Kash Patel, the FBI director, faced senators during his confirmation hearings on 30 January, he bristled at suggestions that his 2023 book contained an \u201cenemies list\u201d. The appendix to Government Gangsters, which included a list of names for around 60 people, was simply documentation of those who had \u201cweaponized\u201d the government, he insisted.\nSeven months later, that denial appears increasingly hollow. Friday\u2019s FBI search of the former national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s home and office, reportedly to find classified documents, marks the fifth investigation targeting people from Patel\u2019s book.\nBolton now joins a growing list of Trump critics from Patel\u2019s roll the administration has targeted with what appear to be retaliatory federal investigations: James Comey, the former FBI director, John Brennan, the former CIA director, Miles Taylor, the ex-homeland security official and Lt Col Alexander Vindman. All five people, investigated in just seven months, were on Patel\u2019s 60-name list.\nTypically, federal prosecutors open cases based on tips, evidence or ongoing criminal activity. They don\u2019t work their way through the index of a political book. While there is no public evidence that the book itself or any outside group is directing investigations, the overlap appears more than coincidence. The Biden justice department definitively closed both civil and criminal proceedings against Bolton in 2021 over his memoir about his time in the Trump White House. Bringing that investigation back to life requires a deliberate decision to re-litigate an already settled matter.\nBolton\u2019s investigation, like those into the other four on Patel\u2019s list, is unprecedented in how it is calculated to target a critic. The justice department acknowledged opening criminal investigations into Comey and Brennan over their 2016-2017 Russia investigation roles. Taylor faced presidential orders revoking his security clearance and demanding investigations into his anonymous anti-Trump writings. The DC interim US attorney pressed representative Eugene Vindman for business records tied to Ukraine aid, targeting the twin brother of Alexander Vindman, who testified against Trump during his first impeachment.\nWhen asked for details about the raids and the reasoning behind them, a spokesperson for the FBI did not answer directly.\n\u201cThe FBI is conducting court authorized activity in the area,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThere is no threat to public safety. We have no further comment.\u201d\nThe systematic nature of these investigations exposes the fundamental contradiction in the administration\u2019s approach. Officials claim to be combating the \u201cweaponization\u201d of justice while at the same time weaponizing it against a pre-compiled list of critics.\nNotably, Patel\u2019s targets are both \u201cdeep state\u201d bureaucrats and former Trump allies. Along with Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton, they include Trump\u2019s own former officials like the former defense secretary Mark Esper and Stephanie Grisham, the press secretary, a suggestion that the list features anyone who crossed or flipped on the president, regardless of their previous loyalty. Patel on Friday morning posted on social media that \u201cNO ONE is above the law\u201d.\nTrump\u2019s reaction to the Bolton investigation undermines claims of prosecutorial independence. Asked about the raids, the president claimed ignorance while launching familiar attacks: Bolton was \u201csort of a lowlife\u201d and \u201ccould be a very unpatriotic guy \u2013 we\u2019re going to find out\u201d, he told reporters on Friday.\nBy systematically investigating critics while claiming to restore justice department integrity, the administration is creating an environment in which political opposition becomes presumed as evidence of criminal behavior.\nThis marks another example of evolution from Trump\u2019s first term, when efforts to weaponize federal law enforcement were often chaotic and ultimately unsuccessful. The current approach appears more disciplined, with Patel\u2019s book providing targets and Bondi\u2019s working group providing bureaucratic cover."
