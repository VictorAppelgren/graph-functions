Cabrera struck out the side in the eighth.\n\nEdwards singled up the middle in the third, scoring to score Dane Myers for a 1-0 lead. Edwards had his 34th multi-hit game.\n\nRookies Jakob Marsee and Troy Johnston added RBI hits in the fourth for a 3-0 lead. Marsee doubled down the left field line and Johnston singled up the middle.\n\nHeriberto Hernandez, another rookie, hit a two-run homer to left in the fifth for his seventh of the season.\n\nBryce Elder (4-9) allowed five earned runs and seven hits in six innings. Dylan Dodd struck out four in three innings of relief.\n\nMarcell Ozuna, who had a go-ahead RBI in the seventh on Thursday, went 0 for 4.\n\nBoth of Miami's walks \u2014 Myers in the third and Kyle Stowers in the fifth \u2014 came in to score.\n\nMiami entered having lost 17 of its last 21 games at Truist Park.
