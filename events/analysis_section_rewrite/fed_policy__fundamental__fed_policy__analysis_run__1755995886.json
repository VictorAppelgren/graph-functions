      "feedback": "**Actionable edit checklist (compact paragraph)**  \n1. **Anchor the narrative in first‑principles** – start with a clear statement of the invariant drivers: (i) the U.S. real‑rate differential vs. euro‑zone and China (use 2025 Fed funds ≈ 4.5 % vs. euro‑zone real rate ≈ 0.5 % from C3ODMIQKZ), (ii) the terms‑of‑trade effect of a dollar that is expected to weaken by 2–3 % after the September cut (GX057ADL7), and (iii) the Fed’s policy‑reaction function (Jackson Hole + Treasury Secretary’s 50 bp call) that sets the probability of a September cut at ~70 % (37UZC9X8I).  \n2. **Quantify the current regime** – state that personal‑loan rates are 10–12 % for fair credit (C3ODMIQKZ) and that corporate spreads are 300–350 bp above the 10‑yr Treasury (use TN66GHPAT’s yield‑spread data).  \n3. **Map the causal chain** – show how a 50 bp cut → lower real rates → tighter credit spreads → lower personal‑loan rates (down 0.5–1 %) → higher corporate earnings → 5–7 % upside in dividend‑paying stocks like Donegal (TN66GHPAT) and J&J (H7Q52FKDH).  \n4. **Specify catalysts and transition triggers** – September CPI, jobs report, Fed minutes, Treasury Secretary’s remarks, and the 10‑yr yield curve steepening.  \n5. **Add risk‑specific catalysts** – (a) an unexpected 0.5 % inflation spike from supply‑chain shocks, (b) a sudden geopolitical escalation in Ukraine, (c) a sharp rise in default rates that could widen spreads by 50 bp (C3ODMIQKZ).  \n6. **Resolve source conflicts** – reconcile the Treasury Secretary’s 50 bp call with the Bloomberg report that suggests a 150 bp “jumbo” cut; note that the former is a “minimum” while the latter is a “potential” scenario.  \n7. **Structure the write‑up** – use sub‑headings: “Invariant Anchors”, “Current High‑Rate Regime”, “Transition Triggers”, “Base‑Case Path”, “Key Risks & Watchpoints”, “Confidence Rating”.  \n8. **Cite IDs consistently** – e.g., (C3ODMIQKZ), (GX057ADL7), (TN66GHPAT), (H7Q52FKDH), (37UZC9X8I).  \n9. **Add a concise confidence statement** – “Moderate‑high confidence (70 %) given clear policy signals; volatility from geopolitical shocks remains a tail risk.”  \n10. **Trim generic language** – replace “high‑rate, high‑inflation regime” with the specific numbers above; replace “lower‑rate, lower‑inflation environment” with “real rates falling to 0.5–1 % and CPI easing to 2 %”.  \n\nImplement these edits to elevate the analysis to world‑class, multi‑year, first‑principles quality.",
