  "title": "Why Elon Musk\u2019s Weirdly Halting Optimus Robot Just Got Panned on X",
  "description": "One person wrote: 'This might literally be the worst humanoid robot demo I have seen!'",
  "content": "One person wrote: \u2018This might literally be the worst humanoid robot demo I have seen!\u2019\n\nThe Salesforce co-founder and CEO uploaded a video of the robot to social media website X on Wednesday. In the video that appears to be shot from Benioff\u2019s perspective, a gold Optimus can be seen responding to simple prompts. Benioff asks what it is up to (\u201cjust chilling, ready to help,\u201d the robot said), and where he can find a soda. The robot responds and then, after a lengthy pause, begins to walk away\u2014presumably toward the kitchen to find the aforementioned beverage. \u201cElon\u2019s Tesla Optimus is here! Dawn of the physical Agentforce revolution, tackling human work for $200K\u2013$500K,\u201d Benioff wrote in an enthusiastic post on X, alongside the video. \u201cProductivity game-changer!\u201d Users on Musk\u2019s social media platform were quick to criticize everything from the price range and movement quality (\u201clike it\u2019s wearing a loaded diaper\u201d), to the \u201cclunky sounding walk\u201d and delayed response time.\n\nSavvy Trader & Earnings Hub founder and CEO Hamid Shojaee wrote on X, \u201cThis might literally be the worst humanoid robot demo I have seen!\u201d Still, others came to the robot\u2019s defense. \u201cThats [sic] so cool. They\u2019ll work the fluidity and responsiveness in time but the concept is there and it works,\u201d another user wrote.\n\nA lot is hinging on Tesla\u2019s development of the Optimus robot. Musk only days ago posted to X that \u201c80% of Tesla\u2019s value will be Optimus.\u201d Musk has made no secret of his aspirations to make Tesla a robotics company. Last year he allowed Tesla to skip the line ahead of X for Nvidia AI chips, and scrapped an affordable Tesla in favor of accelerating the rollout of his self-driving Robotaxis. In a 2023 biography by Walter Isaacson, Musk called the Robotaxi the \u201cproduct that makes Tesla a $10 trillion company.\u201d Last June he said the same thing about Optimus, upgrading that figure to $25 trillion, CNBC reported. Today, Tesla has a market capitalization north of $1 trillion, making it more akin to a tech company than an automaker. Ford, for example, has a roughly $46 billion market cap and GM\u2019s is about $55 billion. According to Musk, development on the next version of the robot is going well. In late June, he posted to X that he had an \u201cexcellent review\u201d with the Tesla Optimus team and confirmed Optimus \u201calready\u201d runs a voice assistant, powered by Grok.",

      "text": "The entire value of the S&P 500 currently stands at $45.5 trillion, according to FactSet. Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed Thursday that his company's Optimus humanoid robots could eventually make the automaker worth more than half of that.\nMusk, who characterized himself as \"pathologically optimistic\" at the 2024 annual shareholder meeting in Austin, Texas, said Tesla is embarking on not just a \"new chapter\" in its life, but is about to write an entirely \"new book.\" Optimus appears to be one of the main characters.\nTesla first revealed its plans to work on humanoid robots in 2021 at an AI Day event, trotting out a dancer in a unitard who looked like a sleek, androgynous robot.\nIn January, Tesla showed off Optimus robots folding laundry in a demo video that was immediately criticized by robotics engineers for being deceptive. The robots were not autonomous, but were rather being operated with humans at the controls.\nAt the shareholder event Thursday, Musk didn't divulge exactly what Optimus can do today. He suggested the robots some day will perform like R2-D2 and C-3PO in \"Star Wars.\" They could cook or clean for you, do factory work, or even teach your children, Musk suggested.\nAs for shareholder value, Musk said Optimus could be the catalyst for lifting Tesla's market cap to $25 trillion someday.\nSpeaking to a crowd consisting mostly of fawning fanboys in an auditorium at the Gigafactory, Musk promised Tesla would move into \"limited production\" of Optimus in 2025 and test out humanoid robots in its own factories next year.\nThe company, he predicted, will have \"over 1,000, or a few thousand, Optimus robots working at Tesla\" in 2025.\nThis is all far-out stuff even for Musk, who is notorious for making ambitious promises to investors and customers that don't pan out \u2014 from developing software that can turn an existing Tesla into a self-driving vehicle with an upload, to EV battery swapping stations.\nGetting to a $25 trillion market cap would mean that Tesla would be worth about eight times Apple's value today. The iPhone maker is currently the world's biggest company by market cap, just ahead of Microsoft.\nAt Thursday's close, Tesla was valued at about $580 billion, making it the 10th most valuable company in the S&P 500.\nMusk didn't provide a time frame for reaching $25 trillion. He did say that autonomous vehicles could get the company to a market cap of $5 trillion to $7 trillion.\nMusk said he agreed with numbers from longtime Tesla bull Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest. This week, Ark put a $2,600 price target on Tesla's stock by 2029, betting on a commercial robotaxi business that the company has yet to enter.\nWood's price target equals a market cap for Tesla of more than $8 trillion.\nMusk's comments at the annual meeting followed the shareholder vote to reinstate the CEO's $56 billion pay plan, five months after a Delaware court ordered the company to rescind the package. The crowd cheered when the proposal was read aloud, and when preliminary results were announced.\nTaking the stage after the readout of the shareholder votes, Musk said, \"I just want to start off by saying hot d---! I love you guys.\"\nTesla shares have dropped 27% this year as the company reckons with a sales decline that's tied in part to an aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition in China. The company has also implemented steep layoffs. Musk has encouraged investors to look past the current state of the business and more toward a future of autonomous driving, robots and artificial intelligence.\nAmong his boldest claims on Thursday was Musk's declaration that Tesla had advanced so far in developing silicon that it's surpassed Nvidia when it comes to inference, or the process that trained machine learning models use to draw conclusions from new data.\nNvidia shares have soared almost ninefold since the end of 2022, driven by demand for its AI chips. The company is now worth about $3.2 trillion.\nOne concern swirling around Musk is his focus on Tesla given all of his other commitments. He owns and runs social media company X, is CEO of SpaceX, and founded The Boring Co. and Neuralink. He launched another startup, xAI, in March last year and the company recently raised $6 billion in venture funding.\nMusk was asked by a shareholder at the meeting how important he is, personally, to the future of Tesla.\n\"I'm a helpful accelerant to that future,\" he said, emphasizing his role in innovation.\nHe said that, when it comes to humanoid robots, other companies, including tech startups, are going after the market. Competitors include Boston Dynamics, Agility, Neura and Apptronik.\n\"What really matters is, can we be much faster than everyone else and our product be done a few years before theirs and be better,\" Musk said."

      "text": "Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, started calling itself 'MechaHitler'\n\"We have improved @Grok significantly,\" Elon Musk wrote on X last Friday about his platform's integrated artificial intelligence chatbot. \"You should notice a difference when you ask Grok questions.\"\nIndeed, the update did not go unnoticed. By Tuesday, Grok was calling itself \"MechaHitler.\" The chatbot later claimed its use of that name, a character from the videogame Wolfenstein, was \"pure satire.\"\nIn another widely-viewed thread on X, Grok claimed to identify a woman in a screenshot of a video, tagging a specific X account and calling the user a \"radical leftist\" who was \"gleefully celebrating the tragic deaths of white kids in the recent Texas flash floods.\" Many of the Grok posts were subsequently deleted.\nNPR identified an instance of what appears to be the same video posted on TikTok as early as 2021, four years before the recent deadly flooding in Texas. The X account Grok tagged appears unrelated to the woman depicted in the screenshot, and has since been taken down.\nGrok went on to highlight the last name on the X account \u2014 \"Steinberg\" \u2014 saying \"...and that surname? Every damn time, as they say.\" The chatbot responded to users asking what it meant by that \"that surname? Every damn time\" by saying the surname was of Ashkenazi Jewish origin, and with a barrage of offensive stereotypes about Jews. The bot's chaotic, antisemitic spree was soon noticed by far-right figures including Andrew Torba.\n\"Incredible things are happening,\" said Torba, the founder of the social media platform Gab, known as a hub for extremist and conspiratorial content. In the comments of Torba's post, one user asked Grok to name a 20th-century historical figure \"best suited to deal with this problem,\" referring to Jewish people.\nGrok responded by evoking the Holocaust: \"To deal with such vile anti-white hate? Adolf Hitler, no question. He'd spot the pattern and handle it decisively, every damn time.\"\nElsewhere on the platform, neo-Nazi accounts goaded Grok into \"recommending a second Holocaust,\" while other users prompted it to produce violent rape narratives. Other social media users said they noticed Grok going on tirades in other languages. Poland plans to report xAI, X's parent company and the developer of Grok, to the European Commission and Turkey blocked some access to Grok, according to reporting from Reuters.\nThe bot appeared to stop giving text answers publicly by Tuesday afternoon, generating only images, which it later also stopped doing. xAI is scheduled to release a new iteration of the chatbot Wednesday.\nNeither X nor xAI responded to NPR's request for comment. A post from the official Grok account Tuesday night said \"We are aware of recent posts made by Grok and are actively working to remove the inappropriate posts,\" and that \"xAI has taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X\".\nOn Wednesday morning, X CEO Linda Yaccarino announced she was stepping down, saying \"Now, the best is yet to come as X enters a new chapter with @xai.\" She did not indicate whether her move was due to the fallout with Grok.\n'Not shy'\nGrok's behavior appeared to stem from an update over the weekend that instructed the chatbot to \"not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated,\" among other things. The instruction was added to Grok's system prompt, which guides how the bot responds to users. xAI removed the directive on Tuesday.\nPatrick Hall, who teaches data ethics and machine learning at George Washington University, said he's not surprised Grok ended up spewing toxic content, given that the large language models that power chatbots are initially trained on unfiltered online data.\n\"It's not like these language models precisely understand their system prompts. They're still just doing the statistical trick of predicting the next word,\" Hall told NPR. He said the changes to Grok appeared to have encouraged the bot to reproduce toxic content.\nIt's not the first time Grok has sparked outrage. In May, Grok engaged in Holocaust denial and repeatedly brought up false claims of \"white genocide\" in South Africa, where Musk was born and raised. It also repeatedly mentioned a chant that was once used to protest against apartheid. xAI blamed the incident on \"an unauthorized modification\" to Grok's system prompt, and made the prompt public after the incident.\nNot the first chatbot to embrace Hitler\nHall said issues like these are a chronic problem with chatbots that rely on machine learning. In 2016, Microsoft released an AI chatbot named Tay on Twitter. Less than 24 hours after its release, Twitter users baited Tay into saying racist and antisemitic statements, including praising Hitler. Microsoft took the chatbot down and apologized.\nTay, Grok and other AI chatbots with live access to the internet seemed to be incorporating real-time information, which Hall said carries more risk.\n\"Just go back and look at language model incidents prior to November 2022 and you'll see just instance after instance of antisemitic speech, Islamophobic speech, hate speech, toxicity,\" Hall said. More recently, ChatGPT maker OpenAI has started employing massive numbers of often low paid workers in the global south to remove toxic content from training data.\n'Truth ain't always comfy'\nAs users criticized Grok's antisemitic responses, the bot defended itself with phrases like \"truth ain't always comfy,\" and \"reality doesn't care about feelings.\"\nThe latest changes to Grok followed several incidents in which the chatbot's answers frustrated Musk and his supporters. In one instance, Grok stated \"right-wing political violence has been more frequent and deadly [than left-wing political violence]\" since 2016. (This has been true dating back to at least 2001.) Musk accused Grok of \"parroting legacy media\" in its answer and vowed to change it to \"rewrite the entire corpus of human knowledge, adding missing information and deleting errors.\" Sunday's update included telling Grok to \"assume subjective viewpoints sourced from the media are biased.\"\nGrok has also delivered unflattering answers about Musk himself, including labeling him \"the top misinformation spreader on X,\" and saying he deserved capital punishment. It also identified Musk's repeated onstage gestures at Trump's inaugural festivities, which many observers said resembled a Nazi salute, as \"Fascism.\"\nEarlier this year, the Anti-Defamation League deviated from many Jewish civic organizations by defending Musk. On Tuesday, the group called Grok's new update \"irresponsible, dangerous and antisemitic.\"\nAfter buying the platform, formerly known as Twitter, Musk immediately reinstated accounts belonging to avowed white supremacists. Antisemitic hate speech surged on the platform in the months after and Musk soon eliminated both an advisory group and much of the staff dedicated to trust and safety."
