  "title": "Disney free cash flow jumps as Lilo & Stitch, sports drive growth",
  "description": "A 53% jump in free cash flow, billion\u2011dollar box office hits, and blockbuster sports deals in its earnings report put the Magic Kingdom on offense",
  "content": "Disney\u2019s last quarter may have delivered old-school magic, but this quarter just did it one better \u2014 delivering a boatload of cold, hard cash.\n\nFree cash flow at the House of Mouse surged 53% to top $1.89 billion on the back of booming sales in Disney\u2019s all-important Experiences segment (parks, etc.) and deferred taxes related to the California wildfire crisis. Lower content spending helped lift Disney\u2019s streaming profitability, too, further strengthening the bottom line.\n\nGains on the top line were more muted, but still positive. Revenue for the fiscal third quarter rose 2% from a year ago to $23.7 billion, while income before taxes grew 4% to $3.21 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.61, up 16%, beating last year\u2019s $1.39. On a GAAP basis, EPS more than doubled to $2.92, inflated by a $3.3 billion non-cash tax benefit tied to a change in Hulu\u2019s U.S. tax classification.\n\nA case study in how Disney turns IP into cash Readers who don\u2019t have young children (or know any nostalgic Gen Zers) may be surprised to hear the \"Lilo & Stitch\" live-action film grossed $1 billion-plus with its release this quarter, becoming the fourth Disney film to cross the billion-dollar mark in the last year. The franchise is a good case study in Disney\u2019s model, which turns IP into dollars across its business lines.\n\n\u201cLilo & Stitch's success has fueled viewership of the original 2002 animated film and related content on Disney+, with more than 640 million hours streamed globally, and a sequel to the live-action film is already in development,\u201d Disney management said in its prepared commentary. \u201cMeanwhile, Lilo & Stitch is on track to become the company's second-largest licensed merchandise franchise this year behind only Mickey Mouse, with more than 70% revenue growth compared to last year. Stitch has also been deployed across our parks and experiences worldwide as we leverage the popularity of this global phenomenon.\u201d\n\nDisney\u2019s sports arm is in dealmaking overdrive ahead of ESPN\u2019s August 21 direct-to-consumer launch. The company struck a five year, $1.6 billion agreement with WWE parent TKO Group for exclusive U.S. streaming rights to marquee events like WrestleMania and SummerSlam, starting in 2026, at $325 million a year \u2014 more than triple the value of WWE\u2019s current Peacock deal, per Wall Street Journal reporting.\n\nThe events will stream on ESPN\u2019s new $29.99 a month service, with select coverage simulcast on cable. The pact builds on ESPN\u2019s existing UFC relationship and comes alongside a sweeping agreement with the NFL that will give the league a 10% stake in ESPN in exchange for media assets including NFL Network, expanded highlight rights, and RedZone distribution.\n\nLooking ahead, Disney forecast adjusted EPS of $5.85 for fiscal 2025, up 18% year over year, and said Disney+ and Hulu subscribers should grow by more than 10 million in the current quarter, mostly from Hulu\u2019s expanded distribution through Charter.\n\nCEO Bob Iger pointed to the launch of a standalone ESPN streaming service, deeper NFL ties, and the integration of Hulu into Disney+ as key growth drivers. With cash generation surging, IP machines firing, and sports rights locked in for the streaming era, the company is signaling it intends to spend the rest of the year on offense.\n\nStill, shares sank 1.5% premarket, even as the broader market edged into the green. Maybe that's to do with the muted top line growth, or perhaps because Disney's full-year strength was already baked into shares. But whatever Wall Street's short-term reaction, Disney's top brass is clearly feeling confident.",

Further, the market sold off in the afternoon, giving up most of its gains. While only one day, that type of action is not what the bulls want to see. Selling into strength is something that the smart money does very well, but those players don't want to make their defensive moves obvious and try to hide their distribution on an up day. As we said, we are rolling into earnings season with huge gains since the April bottom. As such, it's possible that it may not be enough for companies to \"just\" beat on earnings and raise guidance. Most of the recent big gainers on the S&P 500 have low relative strength. So we classify this as a low-quality rally. Beaten-up stocks, going into EPS season, have low expectations, so it's not hard to please Wall Street. Generally, these stocks have decent short positions, so any kind of decent news will get the shorts scrambling and taking profits. Checking in on the S&P 500, we do not see much when it comes to technical trouble. The index has been riding its five-, 10-, and 13-day exponential averages higher since April 23. Every dip has been gobbled up, as more and more investors joined the bullish ranks. Remember, this has taken quite a bit of time in the context of one of the most hated rallies in memory. While we still do not see a lot of technical red flags, we do note a bearish momentum divergence with respect to the daily moving-average convergence/divergence (MACD) on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100. There is also a minor S&P 500 divergence on the 14-day relative strength index. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)\nLast week was another strong period for stocks, as all the mega-cap indices rallied to all-time highs (ATHs).\nLast week was another strong period for stocks, as all the mega-cap indices rallied to all-time highs (ATHs). That includes the S&P 500 (SPX), S&P 100 (OEX), Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF (XLG), Nasdaq, and Nasdaq 100 (QQQ). As we have said, ATHs are bullish -- until the last one. For the week, the SPX rose 3.4% and has advanced in seven of the past 12 weeks. The OEX jumped 3.9%, the XLG added 4.1%, the Nasdaq rallied 4.3%, and the QQQ popped 4.2%. Sector strength again was led by mega-cap tech, with Communication Services up 5%, Information Technology 4.4%, and Consumer Discretionary 4%. Big IT winners were by GOOGL, META, NFLX, NVDA, AVGO, and TSM, while Discretionary rose due to smaller issues. Financial and Industrials were also strong for the week. We were asked an interesting question last week. Is it bullish if we get a \"golden cross\" with the SPX already at ATHs? When the 50-day average crosses above the 200-day, it is called a \"golden cross,\" which is very close to happening. When the 50-day falls below the 200-day, as it did in April 2025, it is a \"death cross.\" Going back to 1980, the buy signals (regardless of whether the index was at an ATH or far from it), have worked very well (such as in 1980, 1982, 1984, 1991, 1995, 2003, 2009, 2012, 2016, 2019, 2020, and 2023). Most of the sell signals were terrible. The times they worked were when there was at least a six-month topping process (1999/2000, 2007/2008, 2021/2022). In addition, the best sell signals tended to occur during huge bear markets, with two of them in the above list.
