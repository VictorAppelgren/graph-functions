  "title": "Tesla Disbands Dojo Supercomputer Team",
  "description": "In a blow to Tesla\u2019s efforts in artificial intelligence, the company has decided to disband its Dojo supercomputer team. Bloomberg\u2019s Max Chafkin discusses what\u2019s behind the move and how the company will pivot with Caroline Hyde on \u201cBloomberg Tech.\u201d (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "What do you make of this move away from making its own hardware in the AI chip space? I mean, it's it's definitely a setback because Tesla, of course, if somewhat famously likes to make everything that's kind of Elon Musk's whole thing. He's tried to make a vertically integrated auto manufacturer that makes Tesla very unusual and and also has been trying, you know, obviously desperately to pivot towards A.I.. So so this is a setback. I will say it's a setback that I think people saw coming to some extent in 2024. During an earnings call, Musk sort of started to tamp down expectations, said they were going to rely on two paths for training its A.I. models. One would be this dojo thing, the other would rely on Nvidia chips, the same very expensive chips that everyone is essentially using to train their models. So. So it is it's a setback, but maybe. But. But I don't think it's devastating. I think what is maybe more troubling is just losing talent. Right? We're in the middle of this A.I. talent war. Tesla historically has been very competitive. Of course, the stock, you know, for for a while was was just exploding and has been fairly stagnant over the last couple of years. And I think you're you know, you're seeing that right there. There's startups out there and these kind of very large privately held companies like open A.I. and Entropic that are just throwing huge sums of money at developers. And, you know, you see Tesla clearly like struggle a little bit to keep up and retain and density AI now forming as a new startup to take on the world of hardware and AI. Max Briefly, I mean, Elon responded saying that doesn't make sense. Have two different avenues for chips and AC 15 and 16 they're going to continue with. But more broadly, this was thinking of the way it set itself apart for the future of supercomputing being vertically integrated. Morgan Stanley thought would be $500 billion added to the market cap. Yeah. And all of those estimates, of course, look, look silly. And I think you have to ask yourself, there are lots of estimates like that around Tesla and its A.I. ambitions, few of which are really realized yet. And it does make you wonder, are like, should we revisit some of those other assumptions? You know, people talking about valuations in the trillions. You know look, you are Musk said this was a moonshot. I think it was kind of a moonshot because the truth is in video dominates this market, the market for trading chips. And Elon Musk took a crack but wasn't able to get there.",

  "summary": "Tesla has disceased its own hardware team in the AI chip space, Dojo Supercomputer Team, and announced it will instead rely on Nvidia chips for training its A.I. models. This move is seen as a setback that many predicted would occur in 2024. However, Max argues that it may be more concerning as Tesla is losing talent due to the ongoing battle for the top in the A.In.I talent war. The company's stock has been stagnant for several years and its valuation estimates range from $500 billion to $100 billion. Max concludes that Tesla's decision to abandon its vertically integrated strategy for the future of supercomputing being vertically integrated could be a setback.",
