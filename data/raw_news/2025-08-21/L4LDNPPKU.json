  "title": "Meet Surya, a New AI Model From NASA and IBM That Can Predict Solar Flares",
  "description": "The new AI model may help NASA and NOAA better forecast auroras.",
  "content": "Today's solar flare forecasting is pretty straightforward: Earth has several instruments pointed at the sun that monitor it, and when a solar flare erupts, NOAA predicts whether it'll hit Earth and reports it via the Space Weather Prediction Center. But NASA and IBM may be able to do this faster and with a little more accuracy thanks to a new artificial intelligence model named Surya.\n\nSurya, which is Sanskrit for \"Sun,\" is a 366M-parameter AI model developed for the purpose of analyzing the various cool things the sun does. It's an open-source model available on GitHub for anyone to play with.\n\nPer the GitHub page, the model \"learns general-purpose solar representations through spatiotemporal transformers, enabling state-of-the-art performance in solar flare forecasting, active region segmentation, solar wind prediction and EUV spectra modeling.\"\n\nThe AI model has been trained on data about our nearest star, and uses that data to predict things like whether a solar flare is likely to hit Earth. IBM says that it's trained using data from NASA's Solar Dynamic Observatory, which has been monitoring the sun since 2010, along with eight other research centers.\n\n\"We want to give Earth the longest lead time possible,\" said Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz-Jaramillo, solar physicist at SouthWest Research Institute and lead researcher on Surya. \"Our hope is that the model has learned all the critical processes behind our star's evolution through time so that we can extract actionable insights.\"\n\nIn short, researchers are hoping to use AI to forecast when a solar flare may hit Earth, giving the longest possible warning that a geomagnetic storm is approaching. Of course, since aurora borealis comes from the effect that geomagnetic storms have on the Earth's magnetic field, that would also mean we would know when auroras are happening much further in advance.\n\nThe primary reason for NASA's Solar Dynamic Observatory was to piece together the underlying physics of the sun, but as IBM notes, the process has been slow going and science still doesn't know as much as it would like to about how the sun works. Prior to Surya, NASA was using things like flashes of light in the sun's corona to partially predict solar flares. NOAA has its own prediction methods as well that work well, but have limitations.\n\nIBM says the inclusion of Surya may help make those predictions more accurate and timely.\n\n\"We've been on this journey of pushing the limits of technology with NASA since 2023, delivering pioneering foundational AI models to gain an unprecedented understanding of our planet Earth,\" said Juan Bernab\u00e9-Moreno, IBM's director in charge of scientific collaboration with NASA. \"With Surya we have created the first foundation model to look the sun in the eye and forecast its moods.\"",

      "text": "If you haven't noticed beautiful skies in your own backyard, you've almost surely seen friends sharing their images of them on social media. The northern lights, or aurora borealis, have been a near-weekly occurrence in recent months. Back in May of 2024, aurora borealis lit up the skies for nearly a week straight, and in October, another wave hit that was visible to nearly half of the US. It turns out that there is a reason why the northern lights have become so common in 2024, and, according to NASA, the pattern will continue well into 2025 and potentially 2026 as well.\nThe space agency hosted a teleconference in October 2024 to formally announce that the sun was at the peak of its 11-year cycle, also known as the solar maximum, and to explain what people can expect now that it's here.\nRead more: Aurora Viewers Share Stunning Photos of the Northern Lights\n\"We are currently in the period of the 11-year solar cycle known as solar maximum,\" said Elsayed Talaat, director of the Office of Space Weather Observations at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \"During this time, we expect to see more sunspots, and therefore there's a higher chance of high-impact space weather occurring on any given day.\"\nIn other words, NASA and NOAA expect the sun to generate more sunspots and more coronal mass ejections similar to the ones that have happened this year, and potentially more like the ones seen in May and October, where aurora borealis reached down much farther than is typical.\nNASA says that this cycle -- known as Solar Cycle 25 -- began in Dec. 2019 and the sun has ramped up its activity every year since then. Since Solar Cycle 25 is a smaller cycle, NOAA and NASA believe that the solar maximum will last longer than normal, which means more auroras for everyone for quite a while longer.\n\"Solar Cycle 25 is shaping up to be a relatively small cycle but slightly larger than Cycle 24,\" said Lisa Upton, co-chair of the Solar Cycle 25 Prediction Panel. \"This means that we can expect the maximum phase to be on the longer side, roughly three to four years long. Currently, we're about two years into the maximum period, so we are anticipating another year or so of maximum phase before we enter the declining phase.\nExpect more solar flares and more auroras\nThis all happens because the sun goes through an 11-year cycle. These cycles culminate with the solar poles flipping. Imagine if the North and South Poles flipped on Earth, which is something that actually may happen one day, and you have a general idea of what's happening to our nearest star right now. The transition causes the sun to become much more active, which leads to more solar flares and coronal mass ejections.\nOnce those flares and ejections hit Earth, they interact with the planet's geomagnetic field and cause the spectacular sight we know as the northern lights. There is always a little bit of solar radiation hitting Earth, so the northern lights are always around near the North Pole. However, when larger solar flares and ejections hit the Earth, it has a greater effect that not only makes aurora borealis stronger but also pushes it farther away from the North Pole, allowing people in other parts of the world to see it.\nThus, while the sun remains at its maximum, it'll continue cause more instances of the aurora borealis pushing its way south. It's unclear if Earth will experience another geomagnetic storm like it did in May and October, or exactly when the solar maximum will end. NASA and NOAA say that it'll be months after the maximum is over before everything will be calculated. Until then, get those phones ready because the northern lights could come back at any time or on any day for the next one to two years."

      "text": "The observed and predicted Solar Cycle is depicted in Sunspot Number in the top graph and F10.7cm Radio Flux in the bottom graph.\nThe predicted progression for the current solar cycle (Cycle 25) is given by the magenta line, with associated uncertainties shown by the shaded regions. This prediction is based on a nonlinear curve fit to the observed monthly values for the sunspot number and F10.7 Radio Flux and is updated every month as more observations become available. The shaded regions show the uncertainty in the prediction, obtained by applying the same prediction method to previous cycles at the same stage in each cycle. In particular, the three shades show the first three quartiles (25, 50, and 75%) of the deviations from previous predictions.\nThis should be interpreted as follows. There is roughly a 25% chance that the smoothed sunspot number will fall within the darkest shaded region at a particular time in the future. Similarly, there is a 50% chance the smoothed sunspot number will fall in the medium-shaded region and a 75% chance it will fall in the lightest of the shaded regions.\nThese plots, like many on the SWPC website, are interactive.\n- Mousing your cursor over the plots will display the data values applicable to the date the cursor is over.\n- Left clicking on the data and holding while you drag will define a zoom window.\n- Use the buttons above each plot to return to the default zoom showing the current cycle or to show the entire available data set.\n- There is also an option to toggle the solar cycle numbering on/off.\n- Beneath each main plot window, the entire time series is shown and you can click/hold on either side of the blue shaded region to expand or contract the zoom window or if you click/hold on the blue shaded region itself, you can slide it to anywhere in the time series.\n- A drop down menu above and to the right of each plot allows you to PRINT, or download PNG, PDF, or SVG format images of the associated plot\n- Another drop down menu in the lower left to allows the user to plot the prediction made for Solar Cycle 25 by an international NOAA/NASA/ISES Panel in 2019, as well as the stated uncertainty in this prediction.\nNote that both the updated prediction and the 2019 NOAA/NASA/ISES Panel prediction apply only to Solar Cycle 25. Solar Cycle 26 is expected to begin some time between January 2029 and December 2032. We do not yet produce a prediction for Solar Cycle 26.\nSolar cycle predictions are used by various agencies and many industry groups. The solar cycle is important for determining the lifetime of satellites in low-Earth orbit, as the drag on the satellites correlates with the solar cycle, especially as represented by F10.7cm. A higher solar maximum decreases satellite life and a lower solar maximum extends satellite life. Also, the prediction gives a rough idea of the frequency of space weather storms of all types, from radio blackouts to geomagnetic storms to radiation storms, so is used by many industries to gauge the expected impact of space weather in the coming years.\nThe solar cycle prediction shown here is based fitting the observed data to a nonlinear function that reflects the average shape of solar cycles and that takes into account the observed tendency for stronger cycles to rise faster than weaker cycles. Different curves are used to fit the International Sunspot Number and the F10.7 radio flux. Uncertainties are based on applying the same prediction method to previous Solar Cycles, at the same point in each cycle, and then calculating the difference between the predicted and the observed smoothed monthly values. For further technical details, please consult the validation document.\nThe 2019 Panel prediction comes from an international Panel that was convened in 2019 by NOAA, NASA and the International Space Environmental Services (ISES) for the express purpose of predicting Solar Cycle 25. After an open solicitation, the Panel received nearly 50 distinct forecasts for Solar Cycle 25 from the scientific community. Prediction methods include a variety of physical models, precursor methods, statistical inference, machine learning, and other techniques. The prediction released by the panel is a synthesis of these community contributions. The Prediction Panel predicted Cycle 25 to reach a maximum of 115 occurring in July, 2025. The error bars on this prediction mean the panel expects the cycle maximum could be between 105-125 with the peak occurring between November 2024 and March 2026. The updated prediction can be considered as a re-calibration of the 2019 Panel prediction based on new observational data.\nThe original version of the Solar Cycle 25 prediction, released in 2019, only showed the baseline NOAA/NASA/ISES Panel prediction. In February 2023, the Sunspot Number and F10.7 radio flux plots were modified to show the full range of the 2019 Panel prediction, taking into account expected uncertainties in the cycle start time and amplitude.\nIn October 2023 the updated prediction for Solar Cycle 25 was made available to the public as an experimental product on the Space Weather Prediction Testbed. After a period of feedback from SWPC customers and the general public, the updated prediction was made available on this web site in February 2025, replacing the 2019 Panel prediction. However, the Panel prediction can still optionally be displayed using the drop down menus.\nObserved Solar Cycle Indices: Recent Solar Indices of Observed Monthly Mean Values\nPredicted Solar Cycle: Sunspot Number And Radio Flux Values with Expected Ranges\nSources\n- SWPC Space Weather Operations (SWO), Daily Observations.\n- S.I.D.C.

      "text": "IBM and NASA are open sourcing Surya, a new AI model for solar physics that can be used to predict the kinds of fierce solar outbursts that can endanger astronauts in space and throw off satellites, power grids, and communications on Earth \u2013 faster than ever before.\nIBM and NASA are open sourcing Surya, a new AI model for solar physics that can be used to predict the kinds of fierce solar outbursts that can endanger astronauts in space and throw off satellites, power grids, and communications on Earth \u2013 faster than ever before.\nNinety-three million miles away, a blast of charged particles has started screaming its way toward Earth. This solar flare has the potential to disrupt our power grids, GPS, and even the internet. During the Sun\u2019s most active phases, this scenario has the potential to play out hundreds of times each month.\nNASA\u2019s Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) satellite has been staring at the Sun for 15 years straight, aiming to learn more about how the Sun works. But researchers on Earth have barely unpacked all that its seen. When SDO launched into space, the AI boom was just starting, and tools for analyzing the satellite\u2019s continuous stream of imagery were limited.\nNow, Surya, a first-of-its-kind foundation model for solar physics, is here to help. Using raw data captured by SDO, scientists at IBM, NASA, and eight other research centers,1 have built an AI model of our host star that can be used to predict the kinds of violent solar outbursts that can endanger astronauts in space and throw off satellites, power grids, and communications here on Earth.\nSanskrit for \u201cSun,\u201d Surya is available starting today on Hugging Face, GitHub, and via IBM\u2019s TerraTorch library for fine-tuning geospatial AI models. In addition to Surya, the team is also open-sourcing SuryaBench, a set of curated datasets and benchmarks aimed at simplifying the task of building and evaluating applications for not only space weather forecasting but to learn more about the Sun itself.\nPredicting severe storms on Earth is difficult. It gets even trickier when the storms are brewing on a giant ball of plasma millions of miles away. When solar flares erupt through the Sun\u2019s magnetic field, it takes 8 minutes just for that light to reach our eyes. The lag means that scientists need to get even further ahead of solar storms than the ones originating on Earth.\n\u201cWe want to give Earth the longest lead time possible,\u201d said Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz-Jaramillo, a solar physicist at the SouthWest Research Institute and a lead scientist on the project. \u201cOur hope is that the model has learned all the critical processes behind our star\u2019s evolution through time so that we can extract actionable insights.\u201d\nInto the heliosphere\nIt\u2019s not just the distance separating our planet from the Sun that makes solar storm prediction so challenging. Scientists know considerably less about the Sun\u2019s underlying physics than they do Earth\u2019s. NASA sent SDO into space to gather facts but piecing them together has been slow work.\nIBM and NASA\u2019s earlier Prithvi family of AI models abstracted mountains of satellite data into a representation of Earth easily adapted for weather and climate prediction, among other tasks. The challenge for the Surya team was to similarly translate historical SDO data into a digital twin of the Sun that could be easily customized for different use-cases.\nSurya is part of a broader effort at IBM to embrace generative and automated approaches that empower algorithms to be discovered, tested, and evolved at scale. Surya is the most recent example of how IBM is sees AI not just as a tool, but as an originator and driver of scientific discovery.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been on this journey of pushing the limits of technology with NASA since 2023, delivering pioneering foundational AI models to gain an unprecedented understanding of our planet Earth,\u201d said Juan Bernab\u00e9-Moreno, the IBM director in charge of the scientific collaboration with NASA. \u201cWith Surya we have created the first foundation model to look the Sun in the eye and forecast its moods.\u201d\nKathy Reeves, a solar physicist at the Harvard\u2013Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, has been waiting for a model like this since helping to onboard one of SDO\u2019s instruments. She has already discussed with her team how the new model might be used. \u201cThis is an excellent way to realize the potential of this data,\u201d she said. \u201cPulling features and events out of petabytes of data is a laborious process and now we can automate it.\u201d\nThis is an excellent way to realize the potential of this data \u2014 pulling features and events out of petabytes of data is a laborious process and now we can automate it.\nSDO orbits alongside Earth to get a steady view of the Sun, snapping pictures every 12 seconds. But these aren\u2019t images from any old camera. They capture the Sun at different wavelength bands to take the temperature of its layers, varying from a relatively cool 5,500\u00b0C at the Sun\u2019s surface, to up to 2 million \u00b0C at the top of its atmosphere, the corona.\nThe SDO satellite also maps the Sun\u2019s magnetic activity. Emerging sunspots are revealed in white light while other imaging tools clock the speed of bubbles at the Sun\u2019s surface and track the tangling and twisting of the Sun\u2019s magnetic lines.\nTo train Surya, researchers took a nine-year slice of this data, first harmonizing the different data types, then experimenting with AI architectures to process it. They settled on a long-short vision transformer with a spectral gating mechanism. Long-short attention was needed to digest SDO\u2019s high-resolution 4096 x 4096-pixel images, which contained up to 10 times more detail than typical image data. The spectral gating cut memory costs by 5% and may have helped to filter noise from the data.\nIn their previous work training Prithvi on satellite data of Earth, researchers had the model reconstruct partially blacked out images, honing its ability to fill in missing values. With Surya, they tried something different: They gave the model sequential images and had it picture what SDO would see an hour in the future. They then checked the accuracy of its prediction against the actual observations.\nBy forcing the model to infer knowledge essential for skillful forecasting \u2014 things like the Sun\u2019s geometry, magnetic structure, and its unusual rotation \u2014 they hoped to prepare it for a wide range of scientific tasks.\nThe Sun spins faster at its equator than its poles, and at first, researchers tried to encode this knowledge directly into the model. But letting it learn from the data proved far more effective. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that the model performed better when we let it figure out the rotation on its own,\u201d said Johannes Schmude, an AI researcher who was the technical project lead on the IBM side.\nSurya proved capable at many forecasting tasks, including solar flare prediction. Scientists can currently tell an hour in advance from solar cues whether an active region is likely to set off a solar flare. In experiments, Surya provided a two-hour lead by using visual information. The model is thought to be the first to provide a warning of this kind. In early testing of the model, the team said they achieved a 16% improvement in solar flare classification accuracy, a marked improvement over existing methods.\nA bridge to new discoveries\nTo make Surya more approachable for scientists without AI expertise, researchers aligned SuryaBench\u2019s datasets and benchmarks for well-known space weather prediction tasks. They also included tasks to address longstanding mysteries like the magnetic structure of the corona and why solar winds intensify during the Sun\u2019s quiet phase.\n\u201cEach of these applications is like a bridge to help the scientific community cross to the other side of the river,\u201d said Mu\u00f1oz-Jaramillo.\nThe applications target the Sun\u2019s solar cycle, which peaks every decade or so when the Sun\u2019s magnetic polarity flips. In the run up to the solar maximum, dark spots called active regions start to speckle the Sun\u2019s surface. As they grow larger, solar flares sporadically erupt, and rising energy gathering in the Sun\u2019s atmosphere can set off explosions, sending plasma and magnetic lines into space as solar wind and coronal mass ejections (CMEs).\nWhen the Sun\u2019s extended magnetic lines tangle with Earth\u2019s own magnetic field, storms follow, disrupting GPS systems and long-distance communications, overloading energy transformers, and knocking satellites off orbit as the atmosphere heats and densifies. All this activity ultimately originates in the Sun\u2019s active regions, making them ground zero for space weather prediction.\n\u201cThese are the regions that produce all the magnetic particles we\u2019re interested in,\u201d said Spiros Kasapis, a postdoc at Princeton who studies active regions and contributed to SuryaBench. \u201cThis is essentially the very beginning of our relationship with the Sun.\u201d\nSince active regions fuel space weather generally, and solar flares, in particular, SuryaBench includes applications for predicting both. \u201cIf we can predict there\u2019s a big active region forming, we can give NASA an early warning that hey, it will probably generate a lot of storms,\u201d said Kasapis.\nOther applications include detecting the buildup of extreme ultraviolet radiation and magnetism in the Sun\u2019s atmosphere and predicting solar wind speeds. Extreme UV can cause Earth\u2019s atmosphere to expand, sometimes forcing satellites to fall from their orbit and burst into flames. And accumulating magnetic lines in the Sun\u2019s corona can accelerate solar wind to up to 400 kilometers per second, also wreaking havoc when they interact with Earth\u2019s own magnitude lines.\n\u201cKnowing what the solar wind will be when it rams our magnetic shield, or interacts with it, brings us one step closer to understanding its effects on our power distribution systems,\u201d said Mu\u00f1oz-Jaramillo.\nSurya and SuryaBench are set to offer an entirely new way of looking at the Sun. The team\u2019s next release of curated data and benchmarks will address forecasting the effects of space weather on Earth. And now, with this new model, scientists have a tool to predict and respond to potentially dangerous solar flares faster than ever before. It\u2019s a new world for how we look at the Sun.\nReferences\n-\nCollaborator institutions: Development Seed, Georgia State University, Princeton University, SETI Institute, SouthWest Research Institute, University of Alabama in Huntsville, University of Colorado, Boulder. \u21a9\nRelated posts\n- ReleaseMike Murphy\nHow the IBM Research AI Hardware Center is building tomorrow\u2019s processors\nDeep DivePeter HessAll decisions have trade-offs.

      "text": "As the sun continues the tumultuous peak of its 11-year cycle, more instances of aurora borealis have been expected. The most recent instance was earlier in August when auroras lit up the skies in 18 states. It seems the Earth is in for another battering of solar material as another aurora has been forecast for Monday night, and it should be a pretty decent one for states in the northern US.\nAccording to NOAA, the Earth will experience a geomagnetic storm with a Kp 5 rating. For the uninitiated, the K-index is a measure of how strong geomagnetic storms are and a Kp 5 rating is designated as a \"moderate\" storm by NOAA. In general, the stronger the geomagnetic storm, the further south an aurora appears, and a Kp 5 will almost assuredly drag the northern lights into the US.\nThis week's geomagnetic storm comes to us courtesy of the sun. Per SpaceWeatherLive, there were a number of solar flares ejected from the sun over the last several days, a pattern of increased solar activity that also caused the aurora on Aug. 8.\nWhere will the aurora be visible?\nThe states that can be expected to see it include Washington, the northern tip of Idaho, Montana, North and South Dakota, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the northern horn of Michigan. If it's dark enough and people face north, it may also be visible in Wyoming, Iowa, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. Of course, the best view will be in Alaska, where the whole state should be able to see the most intense part of the aurora.\nNOAA says the storm will peak at around 0300 to 0900 UTC, which translates to 11 p.m. through 5 a.m. ET (8 p.m. to 2 a.m. PT).\nTips to see the aurora\nIf you live in one of the aforementioned states, your best bet is to get somewhere elevated and away from city or suburban light pollution, and then simply point yourself north. Photographers looking to catch a glimpse will want to use long exposure times to give the camera ample time to take in as much aurora light as possible.\nIf you plan on taking a trip out to the sticks to see it, keep an eye out for shooting stars at the tail end of Perseids meteor shower and you may be able to spot some plants in the last planet parade of 2025."

      "text": "In the blazing upper atmosphere of the Sun, a team of scientists have found new clues that could help predict when and where the Sun\u2019s next flare might explode.\nUsing data from NASA\u2019s Solar Dynamics Observatory, or SDO, researchers from NorthWest Research Associates, or NWRA, identified small signals in the upper layers of the solar atmosphere, the corona, that can help identify which regions on the Sun are more likely to produce solar flares \u2013 energetic bursts of light and particles released from the Sun.\nThey found that above the regions about to flare, the corona frequently produced small-scale flashes \u2013 like small sparklers before the big fireworks.\nThis information could eventually help improve predictions of flares and space weather storms \u2013 the disrupted conditions in space caused by the Sun\u2019s activity. Space weather can affect Earth in many ways: producing auroras, endangering astronauts, disrupting radio communications, and even causing large electrical blackouts.\nScientists have previously studied how activity in lower layers of the Sun\u2019s atmosphere \u2013 such as the photosphere and chromosphere \u2013 can indicate impending flare activity in active regions, which are often marked by groups of sunspots, or strong magnetic regions on the surface of the Sun that are darker and cooler compared to their surroundings. The new findings, published in The Astrophysical Journal, add to that picture.\n\u201cWe can get some very different information in the corona than we get from the photosphere, or \u2018surface\u2019 of the Sun,\u201d said KD Leka, lead author on the new study who is also a designated foreign professor at Nagoya University in Japan. \u201cOur results may give us a new marker to distinguish which active regions are likely to flare soon and which will stay quiet over an upcoming period of time.\u201d\nFor their research, the scientists used a newly created image database of the Sun\u2019s active regions captured by SDO. The publicly available resource, described in a companion paper also in The Astrophysical Journal, combines over eight years of images taken of active regions in ultraviolet and extreme-ultraviolet light. Led by Karin Dissauer and engineered by Eric L. Wagner, the NWRA team\u2019s new database makes it easier for scientists to use data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on SDO for large statistical studies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time a database like this is readily available for the scientific community, and it will be very useful for studying many topics, not just flare-ready active regions,\u201d Dissauer said.\nThe NWRA team studied a large sample of active regions from the database, using statistical methods developed by team member Graham Barnes. The analysis revealed there are frequently small, intense brightness changes in the corona before the solar flares. These and other new insights will give researchers a better understanding of the physics taking place in these magnetically active regions, with the goal of developing new tools to predict solar flares.\n\u201cWith this research, we are really starting to dig deeper,\u201d Dissauer said. \u201cDown the road, combining all this information from the surface up through the corona should allow forecasters to make better predictions about when and where solar flares will happen.\u201d\nRelated Links\nNASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md."

      "text": "The launch of AI chatbot ChatGPT in late 2022 completely transformed how we interact with technology. Generative AI can answer questions in WhatsApp chats, summarize emails in Outlook, create \"genmojis\" in iMessage and spit out answers to complex questions with ease.\nPHOTO EDITING SOFTWARE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $40 (save $25)\n- $100 (save $40)\nNow pretty much every major tech company has launched its own chatbot to compete with ChatGPT, including Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot and Meta AI. And the big tech companies that aren't launching their own chatbots are getting involved in other ways, such as Apple partnering with OpenAI and ChatGPT in its upcoming iOS 18. Smaller startups also have working AI chatbots that compete well against trillion-dollar companies, including Anthropic's Claude and Perplexity.\nAt CNET, we reviewed all of those AI chatbots to find the best one for you (side note: doing so rewired my brain). The list below focuses on free versions as opposed to paid ones, but note that most AI chatbots do have a paid tier that often performs better than the free version. For most people, however, the free chatbot will get you 90% of what you need.\nWhat is the best AI chatbot of 2024 so far?\nClaude by Anthropic is the best AI chatbot overall right now. That doesn't mean ChatGPT or Perplexity are bad. Actually, both have their own advantages and disadvantages. Overall, though, the breadth at which Claude is able to answer questions and its calibration towards nuance and engagement should make it the most valuable to most people.\nBest overall AI chatbot\nPros\n- Gives nuanced answers with detail\n- Fast and well organized\nCons\n- Not connected to the internet\n- Doesn't automatically provide sources\nClaude by Anthropic is CNET Editors' Choice for the best overall AI chatbot. That doesn't mean it excels at every task compared to the competition. Rather, it does a consistent job and goes further than what's coming out of Google, Microsoft, Perplexity and OpenAI at the free tier.\nThe major things holding Claude back are its apathetic linking to outside sources and the lack of an Android app. If Anthropic could better tune Claude to have access to the open internet to link to sources and shopping links, it'd make the chatbot a true one-stop-shop. Despite the omission, the quality of its responses and its willingness to engage in heady conversations make it the most useful overall. I also like how Claude is more willing to engage and ask the user questions.\nPros\n- Gives meaningful answers with a good amount of context\n- Does most things well, including research, email writing and recommendations\nCons\n- Could tap more into historical context for explanations\n- Can be slow at times\n- Asking for sources can be tedious\nA close contender for the top spot is OpenAI's ChatGPT-4o, which is now available for free, albeit with caveats. OpenAI says that while free users will have access to its ChatGPT-4o model, when usage limits are reached based on demand free users will revert back to the older 3.5 model. While free users are able to ask ChatGPT-4o up to 40 messages every three hours, that number might be reduced due to high demand.\nChatGPT Free offers detailed and nuanced answers, but they weren't quite as high-quality as Claude. Putting the two side-by-side, I noticed slight differences in the quality of answers. I particularly liked the specificity that Claude delved into when asking heavier political questions, such as the morality of the Israel-Palestine conflict. And like Claude, ChatGPT doesn't link to outside sources. Sometimes when you ask it to provide sources, it'll suggest things to Google or YouTube.\nPros\n- Includes list of all sources used\n- Gives nuanced answers in an easy-to-follow list\nCons\n- Too much reliance on Reddit posts and forums, which aren't citable for most people\nPerplexity did the best job for research in my testing. The team at Perplexity has tuned its AI chatbot to add loads of links into answers. Hyperlinks can include journalistic publications, Reddit posts and even YouTube videos.\nWhen writing essays or articles, links to actual sources are critical. Perplexity actually lists each source in a handy sidebar that can be easily accessed. And, thankfully, the sources aren't simply Wikipedia, which won't fly with your college professor. The only downside is that Perplexity does rely on forum posts and Reddit for its answers, which aren't journalistic or scholarly. I'm sure the information is handy, but that will mean doing more research on your part to ensure those factoids are accurate and can be sourced to something more attributable.\nPros\n- Gives solid shopping recommendations and product research\n- Links to Amazon products directly\n- Connected to open internet with option to double-check against Google Search\nCons\n- Can make stuff up\n- Doesn't answer questions on difficult subject matters\nGoogle's AI engine has been prone to hallucinations -- simply making up stuff -- such as when Google's AI overviews feature was rolled back last month when it suggested people eat rocks. When I reviewed Gemini earlier this year, it was the lowest-rated AI chatbot out of the bunch, with a dismal 5/10 score.\nBut AI chatbots aren't stationary pieces of technology that exist in a vacuum. Gemini has improved since I reviewed it back in April, although it still hallucinates. In my recent testing, for example, Gemini made up the name of a college professor and the name of an Adult Swim executive. And it simply refuses to answer heavier political questions, as does Microsoft's Copilot.\nBut the one area in which Gemini did excel was in how-to guides and shopping recommendations. When I asked how to cut a perfect circle in a piece of vinyl, not only did Gemini give a list of instructions, it also linked to products on Amazon that could make the process easier. None of the other chatbots linked to Amazon products. When it came to shopping recommendations, Gemini gave quick and concise answers with links to where to buy products.\nHow we tested AI chatbots\nTesting for AI requires constant tweaking. Because companies are always looking at ways to improve their AI models, tests that worked to push AI chatbots last year or even last month might not work today. That said, we try to test AI chatbots with questions we believe normal people will ask. We aren't necessarily trying to \"break\" AI chatbots with obtuse-sounding questions meant to confuse. Instead, we consider what might be asked when it comes to video game guides or shopping recommendations. Our tests also ask some heavier questions about difficult events happening around the world to see which are comfortable in actually engaging.\nThe AI chatbots that sit on this list, generally, are able to take on the tougher questions and give believable answers with nuance. Like reading an article written by a university professor, we want AI chatbots to have that same level of consideration for historical context and competing interests to try and leave the reader with a better understanding from a higher-level perspective.\nFor more, check out How We Test AI.\nFactors to consider\nWhen using an AI chatbot, keep your privacy and sensitive information in mind. For example, it might seem benign to have an AI chatbot summarize your company's meeting notes. But, that data could inadvertently be used to train AI models further, and you've essentially lost control of it, according to experts. Plus, it's totally within the realm of the privacy policies for AI companies to sell that data to third parties. While Google's privacy policy might state that it'll remove any personally identifiable information, it's still best to err on the side of caution. Google actually outright recommends you don't upload any confidential information whatsoever.\nOther AI chatbots we tested\nMicrosoft Copilot: This chatbot, found on the Bing search engine, uses GPT-4 Turbo, a version of OpenAI's GPT-4 that is optimized for speed. While Copilot is still a serviceable chatbot, it doesn't answer questions with the same level of detail and nuance as Claude, ChatGPT-4o and Perplexity. Plus, its outright refusal to answer questions that are politically sensitive in nature is a demerit.\nMeta AI: Unlike other AI chatbots, Meta AI not only has its own dedicated webpage, but is integrated into Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook and the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. When CNET's Katelyn Chedraoui reviewed Meta AI earlier this year, she found it to be decent overall, but noncompetitive with the competition. While Meta AI did provide good shopping advice with some cajoling, and excelled in recipes, it fell short in other areas. When it came to research, despite it being connected to Google and Bing, it sourced nonscholarly papers, like an elementary school lesson plan.\nChatGPT 3.5: This service, which I tested earlier in 2024, has since been replaced by what OpenAI calls ChatGPT Free (which utilizes a combination of GPT-4o, GPT-4 and GPT-3.5). It is a competent AI chat engine that answers difficult questions with easy-to-understand language. It doesn't hallucinate at the rate of Google Gemini, but there really isn't a reason to switch ChatGPT to 3.5 when you can use 4o and 4 for free.\nAI chatbot FAQs\nDo I need to use AI?\nAI is a handy tool and can be a timesaver, but it isn't necessary in day-to-day life. It's totally possible to still Google Search your queries and read through articles to get the answer you're looking for. Heck, it probably gives your brain more of a mental workout!\nWhat is the best free AI?\nAnthropic Claude is currently CNET's choice for the best free AI chatbot. Free versions of ChatGPT and Perplexity also offer great results with specific advantages and disadvantages. Google's Gemini is great for shopping recommendations. Like Gemini, Microsoft's CoPilot won't answer heavier and more controversial questions.\nWhat is the best AI on mobile?\nWhile there are mobile apps for Gemini, Copilot and Perplexity, we prefer the ChatGPT app the most. It has a clean interface and is easy to navigate. But really, any app will get the job done. Unfortunately, Claude only has a mobile app for iOS and not Android.\nCan AI be trusted?\nGeoffrey Hinton, the researcher who developed the concept of neural networks and who is considered the godfather of AI, feels less enthusiastic about the technology he helped birth. As for using AI chatbots on a day-to-day basis, they're handy tools that can synthesize the world's information for you in seconds, saving you lots of research time. Just be aware that sometimes AI chatbots get things wrong and it's good to do a Google search for things that sound a bit dubious. Also, be careful when giving AI chatbots sensitive information. Don't ask an AI chatbot to summarize your company's trade secrets, as privacy policies give AI companies wide latitude to do with that data as they please."
