The reality star shared her reaction to Bachelor alum Madison Prewett and husband Grant Troutt admitting they plan to spank their 6-month-old daughter.\n\n\u201cIt holds no benefit for the relationship of the child or for the parent,\u201d Frost, 55, told E! News. \u201cWe have laws where it is a criminal offense to commit grievous bodily harm or to hit another adult, and to think that we can just bypass that with our youngest, most vulnerable citizens? They are human beings, too.\u201d\n\nAccording to Frost, spanking demonstrates a \u201clack of control\u201d and \u201cemotional regulation\u201d in the parent.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to protect every human being, then we do so for children as well because they are citizens of this country,\u201d she continued, adding that she believes \u201csmacking should be banned in this country.\u201d\n\nFrost\u2019s comments come after the Bachelor Nation star, 29, was hit with a wave of backlash for her stance on disciplining her children.\n\n\u201cIt will be hilarious when we start spanking hosanna. Which we will, on the record,\u201d Troutt, 29, shared in a July episode of their \u201cStay True\u201d podcast. \u201cBecause the Bible so clearly says, \u2018Folly is bound up in a child.\u2019\u201d\n\nPrewett clarified that the Bible specifically mentions the use of a \u201crod,\u201d disagreeing with people who say \u201cyou can discipline [children] with time outs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are consequences to disobedience,\u201d she added.\n\nFrost strongly disagreed, saying, \u201cCorporal punishment should be banned.\u201d\n\n\u201cChildren that receive that corporal punishment are those that have visible and invisible disabilities,\u201d the famous nanny added.\n\nListeners seemed to side with Frost\u2019s stance as many called the couple\u2019s views \u201cso upsetting.\u201d\n\n\u201cHilarious is a wild word with this context,\u201d one follower commented.\n\n\u201c\u2018The rod\u2019 means to keep them in line like a shepherd would do with their sheep. Not physically beat them with a rod.. ?? A CHILD??\u201d another added.\n\n\u201cThe Bible also specifically says to give away all of your wealth\u2026 so why aren\u2019t they taking that literal?\u201d a third wrote.",

      "text": "Jo Frost does not agree with Madison Prewett's views on spanking as a form of child discipline.\nIn fact, the former Supernanny star believes it's an \"outdated practice.\"\n\"It holds no benefit for the relationship of the child or for the parent,\" Jo exclusively told E! News' Francesca Amiker. \"We have laws where it is a criminal offense to commit grievous bodily harm or to hit another adult, and to think that we can just bypass that with our youngest, most vulnerable citizens? They are human beings, too.\"\nThe 55-year-old continued, \"If we're going to protect every human being, then we do so for children as well because they are citizens of this country.\"\nAnd for Jo, she thinks spanking \"shows a lack of control\" and \"a lack of emotional regulation\" on the parent's part, adding, \"Smacking should be banned in this country.\"\nIn recent years, studies have advised against physical punishment for child discipline, including the National Library of Medicine\u2019s research finding spanking \u201charmful\u201d and \u201cineffective.\u201d\nHowever, according to Madison and her husband Grant Troutt, they plan on spanking their 6-month-old daughter Hosanna when she's older for a more religious reason.\n\"Because the Bible so clearly says, 'Folly is bound up in a child,'\" Grant shared in a July episode of Madison's Stay True podcast, paraphrasing Proverbs 22:15, \"'but discipline drives it far away.'\"\nMadison agreed and emphasized that the Bible specifically mentions \"'with a rod,'\u201d though she clarified that she\u2019ll discipline her daughter in a \"really loving way.\"\n\u201cLike, \u2018Hey sweetheart, do you know why you\u2019re being disciplined? Mommy does not want to discipline you. Mommy does not enjoy having to spank you,\u2019\" the Bachelor Nation star explained. \"But there are consequences to disobedience.\u201d\nSo, what can parents do to discipline their children without any physical harm? For Jo, who has partnered with FARE (Food Allergy Research & Education) to advocate for kids with life-threatening allergies, it's important to show \"emotional intelligence\" and \"energetically connect with your child\" through communication.\n\"Corporal punishment should be banned,\" she said. \"Children that receive that corporal punishment are those that have visible and invisible disabilities.\""
