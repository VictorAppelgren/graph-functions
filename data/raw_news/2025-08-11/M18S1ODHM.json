Also, sign up for The Brief, The Tribune's daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\n\nNew Uvalde school district records released late Monday provide more details about campus safety concerns raised before the deadly 2022 Robb Elementary school shooting \u2014 and reveal in a few teachers\u2019 own words how traumatized they remained after the massacre.\n\nThe documents also indicate that the 18-year-old shooter had exhibited inappropriate school behavior, struggled academically and was often absent when he was an Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District student.\n\nThe materials \u2014 more than 200 megabytes \u2014 are part of the latest document disclosure by a government agency involved in the flawed response to the deadliest school shooting in Texas history. The release was part of a settlement agreement in a yearslong lawsuit news organizations, including ProPublica and The Texas Tribune, brought against state and local governments.\n\nThe records include messages from school district officers who responded to the shooting, in which 19 students and two teachers were killed. The documents reveal little new information about several law enforcement agencies\u2019 failure to more quickly confront the gunman. ProPublica and The Tribune previously found that officers wrongly treated the shooter as a barricaded subject, rather than an active threat, and waited 77 minutes to confront him. No officer took control of the response, which prevented coordination and communication between agencies.\n\nNone of the school district police officers were wearing body cameras that day because the district had not issued them the equipment, so no new video or audio was released Monday.\n\nIn one email released Monday, a fourth-grade Robb teacher wrote to the district superintendent about how terrified she was during the shooting, as she tried to keep her students safe while bullets ricocheted around her.\n\nAccording to a Texas House committee\u2019s investigation into the shooting, the teacher was in a classroom across the hall from the adjoining classrooms where the gunaman killed all of his victims and was barricaded.\n\n\u201cI fell on the floor and began knocking desks over onto my legs so I wouldn\u2019t make noise, but I couldn\u2019t block the students from bullets,\u201d she emailed the former district superintendent, who retired after the shooting. \u201cI told my students I loved them. I told them to stay quiet, and I told them to pray.\u201d\n\nProPublica and The Tribune could not reach the teacher late Monday.\n\nThe records release is \u201can important step toward giving the community and public the answers they deserve,\u201d said Laura Prather, a media law chair for Haynes Boone who represented the news organizations in the legal fight for records. \u201cThe court's ruling makes clear that government agencies cannot hide behind vague legal claims to withhold public information.\u201d\n\nThe documents released Monday show that days after the shooting, Hal Harrell, who was superintendent at the time, emailed himself a media report about the timeline detailing the 77 minutes the gunman spent barricaded while law enforcement waited to confront him.\n\nThe Uvalde County Sheriff\u2019s Office has also agreed to release body camera footage and other records, but had not done so by late Monday.\n\nThe Texas Department of Public Safety, which dispatched more than 90 officers to the school, has appealed a judge\u2019s order to release hundreds of videos and investigative files. Prather said the media coalition continues fighting for the release of the state law enforcement agency\u2019s records.\n\n\u201cThree years is already too long to wait for truth and transparency that could prevent future tragedies,\u201d Prather said.\n\nProPublica and The Tribune previously published 911 calls that showed the increasing desperation of children and teachers pleading to be saved and revealed how officers\u2019 fear of the shooter\u2019s AR-15 prevented them from acting more quickly. In a collaboration with FRONTLINE that included a documentary, the newsrooms showed that while the children in Uvalde were prepared, following what they had learned in their active shooter drills, many of the more than 300 officers who responded were not.\n\nDPS spokesperson Sheridan Nolen wrote in an email Monday that the agency followed \u201cits standard protocol in which it does not release records that will impact pending prosecutions.\u201d Two former Uvalde schools police officers were indicted on child endangerment charges last summer over how they responded to the shooting. That includes Pete Arredondo, who was the district\u2019s police chief during the shooting and has been widely faulted for the delay in confronting the gunman.\n\nUvalde District Attorney Christina Mitchell, who is leading the criminal investigation, did not return requests for comment. Spokespeople for the school district and county also did not immediately respond.\n\nFormer Uvalde mayor Don McLaughlin, now a Republican member of the Texas House, called it \u201cludicrous\u201d that the news organizations had to launch a legal fight to obtain records. He added that DPS should also release its information so that the victims\u2019 families could get much-needed answers.\n\n\u201cMaybe there\u2019s something in there that we can keep this from happening again,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a costly mistake, and so I believe everybody should just release their records and give these families not closure, but at least another piece of what went on that day.\u201d\n\nMcLaughlin said he repeatedly asked DPS about releasing the information since starting his term in Austin this year.\n\n\u201cI basically was told it was up to the lawyers what they could and couldn't do,\u201d he said. \u201cI don't know what could be top secret in these reports that could hinder them being released.\u201d\n\nThe teacher in the classroom across the hall from the gunman wrote in her email to the superintendent that she was convinced she was going to die.\n\n\u201cI physically sat almost laying myself on my students and in front of them to be sure I could block them from bullets,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cI knew I would die that day. I had shrapnel in my back from when he shot in my window. I had blood all over the back of me, but I tried to stay calm for my students.\u201d\n\nThe teacher wrote about how much she loved her students and working for the district. But she also noted that no school officials ever reached out to her immediately after the shooting. She wrote that she and other staff were asked not to talk to the media.\n\nA month after the shooting, Elsa Avila, a fourth-grade teacher who survived being shot, finally felt ready to ask about what was happening to her classroom.\n\n\u201cIs it being packed up, if so what will happen with my personal belongings?\u201d Avila wrote in an email to the school\u2019s principal. \u201cThe students had pi\u00f1atas they were working on, were those salvaged or did they get thrown away?\u201d\n\nAvila said in the email that it was hard to accept that she may never get answers to many of her questions about the shooting.\n\n\u201cSo I guess I can start with answers about my classroom,\" she said.\n\nIn a Monday evening interview, Avila said school leaders did not reach out to her directly while she was in the hospital. She also said the district should have released records sooner and that she hopes other agencies will follow.\n\nStill, she said, the government\u2019s actions are lacking \u201cany follow up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were hundreds of officers there, so, to me, it still does not make sense that they only charged two officers,\u201d she said. \u201cWill there ever be any true accountability from other agencies? Because more people would need to be held accountable, more agencies need to be held accountable than just the two officers that they charged.\u201d\n\nThe new records also show that school administrators had been aware of longstanding issues with locks on campus doors. Multiple witnesses told the legislative panel that employees often left doors unlocked, while teachers would use rocks, wedges and magnets to prop open interior and exterior doors. The shooter was able to enter the school through an unlocked exterior door, according to the legislative investigation.\n\nAccording to emails released Monday, administrators had met with the owner of a lock company to discuss purchasing automatic locks for the district\u2019s exterior doors a little less than a month before the shooting.\n\nEmails sent after the shooting occurred showed cost estimates in the millions of dollars for installing new exterior doors, hardened windows, fencing and other security infrastructure.\n\nThe shooting spurred multiple local, state and federal investigations as more than 300 officers from about two dozen agencies responded to the scene.\n\nThe new school district documents also include previously withheld information about the shooter, 18-year-old Salvador Ramos. A Texas House committee report found that he had a tumultuous relationship with his family, including his mother, and likely suffered mental health issues. That investigation also said he was a victim of bullying at school in part due to his lisp, poverty and chaotic family life.\n\nThe emails released Monday show district officials raising alarms about Ramos hitting another student and using sexual language. In 2018, for example, his mother was warned that he was drawing inappropriate pictures as part of a classroom assignment, just one of many such warnings that teachers would send over the years, according to the emails and the state House committee report.\n\nIn another email, former superintendent Hal Harrell noted that Ramos was routinely failing classes and barely attending school.\n\nAcademic intervention plans recommended one-on-one tutoring and parent conferences, however it is unclear what actions district officials or Ramos\u2019 guardians ever took. Intervention plans from the 2016-2017 school year largely list \u201cbehavior\u201d as the reason for intervention. Ramos eventually dropped out.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection, which sent at least 149 federal agents to the shooting, declined to release most records, although the agency was not involved in the newsrooms\u2019 litigation. It issued its own report last September that mostly evaded blame.\n\nThe school district\u2019s records this week largely confirmed what a state House committee investigating the response had already found. The small school district police unit, led by Arrendondo, was unprepared. Arredondo, who could not be reached for comment, dropped his police radio going into the school and did not effectively take charge or communicate with other law enforcement, the report found.\n\nThe newly-released documents include a string of messages between school district officials and Arredondo, who five days after the shooting said that he was invited to a briefing with former President Joe Biden but would be avoiding news outlets. Four months later, he was fired.\n\nAnother text thread between school district officials shows Adrian Gonzales, a school police officer who would later face 29 charges related to child endangerment, being told to \u201cgo hang out at the park with the Seniors\u201d hours before the shooting.\n\nLater in the same thread, a school secretary wrote at 11:40 a.m. that an individual reported hearing shots outside a school. \u201cThey went ahead and locked themselves down,\u201d the text continued.\n\nArrendondo then received texts at 1:07 p.m., after officers from a federal-led strike team killed the gunman, asking him if any students were injured and if the school\u2019s secure status could be lifted.\n\nGonzales, who also could not be reached for comment, was among the first officers to arrive at Robb. Late Monday, Gonzales\u2019s attorneys filed a legal request seeking a trial outside of Uvalde, arguing \u201cit would be impossible to gather a jury that would not view the evidence through their own pain and grief,\u201d according to KSAT.\n\nLaw enforcement experts largely regard the shooting response as among the worst in American history. A U.S. Justice Department report in January 2024 affirmed many of the newsrooms\u2019 initial findings, and recommended that all officers in the country undergo at least eight hours of active shooter training annually.\n\nAt the time, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said, \u201cOur children deserve better than to grow up in a country where an 18-year-old has easy access to a weapon that belongs on the battlefield, not in a classroom.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, \u201cthat is the terrible reality that we face. And so it is the reality that every law enforcement agency in every community across the country must be prepared for.\u201d",

      "text": "Uvalde school board fires Chief Pete Arredondo over shooting response, after he calls vote a \u201cpublic lynching\u201d\nSign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nUVALDE \u2014 The Uvalde school board agreed Wednesday to fire Pete Arredondo, the school district police chief broadly criticized for his response to the deadliest school shooting in Texas history, in a vote that came shortly after he asked to be taken off of suspension and receive backpay.\nArredondo, widely blamed for law enforcement\u2019s delayed response in confronting the gunman who killed 21 people at Robb Elementary, made the request for reinstatement through his attorney, George E. Hyde. The meeting came exactly three months after a gunman killed 19 students and two teachers at the school.\n\u201cChief Arredondo will not participate in his own illegal and unconstitutional public lynching and respectfully requests the Board immediately reinstate him, with all backpay and benefits and close the complaint as unfounded,\u201d Hyde said in a statement.\nArredondo didn\u2019t attend the meeting, citing death threats made against him.\nBut about 100 people, including relatives of the shooting victims, showed up for the vote. Many chanted \u201ccoward\u201d and \u201cno justice, no peace.\u201d Four people spoke during a public comment period before the seven-member board went into closed session to deliberate Arredondo\u2019s employment, criticizing the decision to not discuss the matter in front of the public.\n\u201cI hope they do right by us,\u201d Brett Cross, whose son Uziyah Garcia was killed in the massacre, told other attendees as trustees met behind closed doors.\nIn a statement the day after the meeting, Luis Fernandez, the Uvalde school board president, said firing Arredondo was \u201can important step in accountability and rebuilding our community\u2019s trust in the district.\u201d\n\u201cTo our Uvalde community \u2014 we hear you, and we are committed to doing what needs to be done to maintain a learning environment that is safe, secure, and nurturing for all students,\u201d Fernandez said.\nFor months, school officials faced intense public pressure to fire Arredondo, who was one of the first law enforcement officers to respond to the shooting at Robb Elementary on May 24. Nearly 400 local, state and federal law enforcement officers waited more than an hour to confront the 18-year-old gunman after he entered the school.\nUvalde Consolidated Independent School District Superintendent Hal Harrell recommended that Arredondo be fired \u201cfor good cause.\u201d Hyde asked school officials to read a statement on Arredondo\u2019s behalf at the meeting. They did not comply with the request.\nAs board members began discussing Arredondo, Felicha Lopez, whose son Xavier James Lopez was killed in the massacre, told people attending the meeting that the school board needed to \u201cprotect our kids\u201d as she wiped tears from her face.\nA Texas House committee report released in July said the responding officers lacked clear leadership, basic communications and sufficient urgency to more quickly confront the gunman, who was shot and killed after a U.S. Border Patrol tactical team entered the classroom where most of the victims were shot.\nIn his statement Wednesday, Arredondo\u2019s lawyer said that the school district violated his constitutional due process rights by failing to provide him notice of the complaints against him and conduct an investigation of his response to the mass shooting ahead of the termination hearing.\nArredondo\u2019s lawyer said that he received an email from the district on July 19, recommending his termination based on his failure to establish himself as the incident commander during the shooting, but argued the letter should have been sent earlier and in a physical format.\nArredondo was listed in the district\u2019s active-shooter plan as the commanding officer, but the consensus of those interviewed by the House committee was that Arredondo did not assume that role and no one else took over for him, which resulted in a chaotic law enforcement response.\nIn a June 9 interview with The Texas Tribune, Arredondo said he did not think he was the incident commander on the scene. He said he never gave any order, instead only called for assistance. Arredondo did not have his police radio while he was inside Robb Elementary because he wanted both of his arms free to engage the shooter, he said.\nArredondo testified to the House committee that he believed the shooter was a \u201cbarricaded subject\u201d instead of an \u201cactive shooter\u201d after seeing an empty classroom next to the one where the shooter was hiding.\n\u201cWith the benefit of hindsight, we now know this was a terrible, tragic mistake,\u201d the House report stated.\nTraining for active-shooter scenarios directs law enforcement responders to prioritize the lives of innocent victims over those of officers. For a barricaded suspect, officers are not advised to rush in.\nThe report criticized Arredondo\u2019s focus on trying to find a key to open the door to the room the shooter was in, which \u201cconsumed his attention and wasted precious time, delaying the breach of the classrooms.\u201d The report said the classroom door didn\u2019t lock properly and likely wasn\u2019t locked as police waited to confront the shooter.\nHyde, Arredondo\u2019s lawyer, asserted that his client should not have been assigned as the incident commander. He argued the Uvalde County sheriff should have been in charge of the incident given that this office was the only law enforcement agency that knew the gunman had shot his grandmother prior to traveling to Robb Elementary.\nVicente Salazar, whose granddaughter Layla Salazar was killed in the attack, told other meeting attendees Wednesday that, in addition to Arredondo, the Uvalde County sheriff should also be fired. He encouraged residents to be more civically engaged.\n\u201cWe need to take Uvalde back for our people,\u201d he said.\nState Sen. Roland Gutierrez, a San Antonio Democrat whose district includes Uvalde, also attended the meeting.\n\u201cIt\u2019s 90 days too long to do the right thing,\u201d he said before the school board\u2019s vote.\nGutierrez said other law enforcement agencies also failed in their response and urged residents to keep pushing for accountability.\n\u201cI encourage you to keep fighting,\u201d Gutierrez said.\nIn the Wednesday letter to trustees, Arredondo\u2019s legal team also directed blame back at the school district for allegedly not taking the police chief's security advice.\n\u201cIf the school district would have prioritized Chief Arredondo\u2019s request over a year prior to the incident, for key-card locks, better fencing, better training, and more equipment, [it] could have been different,\u201d the letter said.\nThe Texas House committee\u2019s report investigating the shooting also cited the school\u2019s lack of preparedness for an armed intruder. Some Uvalde residents have also pushed for the termination or resignation of Harrell, the superintendent who recommended Arredondo\u2019s termination. Trustees met behind closed doors on Monday to discuss complaints about Harrell but took no action on the matter.\nArredondo was elected to the Uvalde City Council a few weeks before the shooting but wasn\u2019t sworn in until after the massacre. After missing several meetings, Arredondo stepped down from his District 3 seat to \u201cminimize further distractions,\u201d he said.\nJesse Rizo, whose niece Jackie Cazares was killed in the shooting, said Arredondo\u2019s termination would help people begin healing. But he also said that other law enforcement officers and agencies should be held accountable.\nRizo also expressed shock that Arredondo asked to be reinstated from suspension with backpay.\n\u201cThe audacity,\u201d he said. \u201cWho would come up with that? You didn\u2019t have a car wreck into a stop sign. You had a loss of life. Twenty-one of them.\u201d\nZach Despart contributed to this story.\nThe full program is now LIVE for the 2022 Texas Tribune Festival, happening Sept. 22-24 in Austin.

      "text": "The children hid. They dropped to the floor, crouching under desks and countertops, far from the windows. They lined up against the walls, avoiding the elementary school doors that separated them from a mass shooter about a decade older than them. Some held up the blunted scissors that they often used to cut shapes as they prepared to fight. A few grabbed bloodied phones and dialed 911. And as students across the country have been instructed for years, they remained quiet, impossibly quiet. At times, they hushed classmates who screamed in agony from the bullets that tore through their small bodies.\nThen, they waited. Waited for the adults, whom they could hear in the hallway. If they were just patient, those adults would save them.\nHundreds of law enforcement officers descended on Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, that day in May 2022. They, too, waited. They waited for someone, anyone, to tell them what to do. They waited for the right keys and specialized equipment to open doors. They waited out of fear that the lack of ballistic shields and flash-bangs would leave them vulnerable against the power of an AR-15-style rifle. Most astonishingly, they waited for the children\u2019s cries to confirm that people were still alive inside the classrooms.\n\u201cI\u2019m watching that door. No screams. No nothing. No nothing. You know. Things you would think you would hear if there had been kids in there,\u201d Cpl. Gregory Villa, who had been with the Uvalde Police Department for 11 years, told an investigator days after the attack that left 19 children and two teachers dead.\nIf there were children inside, Villa said, officers would have probably heard the shooter saying, \u201c\u2018Hey, everybody shut up,\u2019 and then kids are like, \u2018Oh no, I gotta, I want my mommy.\u2019\u201d\nVilla, who received active shooter training four years earlier, was among several officers who told investigators that they didn\u2019t believe children were in the classrooms because they were so quiet. The children\u2019s strict adherence to remaining silent was, in fact, part of their training. Officers\u2019 own training instructs them to confront a shooter if there is reason to believe someone is hurt.\n\u201cI just honestly thought that they were in the cafeteria because it seemed like all the lights were off and it seemed like it was really quiet. I didn\u2019t hear any screaming, any yelling. I literally didn\u2019t hear anything at all,\u201d Uvalde police Staff Sgt. Eduardo Canales recalled to an investigator. \u201cYou would think kids would be yelling and screaming.\u201d\nThe accounts of law enforcement\u2019s actions during one of the worst school shootings in history are among a trove of recorded investigative interviews and body camera footage obtained by ProPublica, The Texas Tribune and FRONTLINE. Together, the hundreds of hours of audio and video offer a startling finding: The children in Uvalde were prepared, dutifully following what they had learned during active shooter drills, even as their friends and teachers were bleeding to death. Many of the officers, who had trained at least once during their careers for such a situation, were not.\nMass shootings have become a fact of American life, with at least 120 since the 1999 Columbine High School shooting. Debates often erupt along partisan lines as anguished communities demand change. When children are gunned down, calls for tighter gun laws are matched with plans for arming teachers and hardening schools.\nOne thing that seemingly unites all sides is the notion of better training for law enforcement. But, in actuality, few laws exist requiring such instruction.\nIn the wake of the Columbine shooting, law enforcement agencies across the country began retooling protocols to prevent long delays like the one that kept officers there from stopping the two shooters. Key among the changes was an effort to ensure that all officers had enough training to engage a shooter without having to wait for more specialized teams.\nMore than two decades later, law enforcement\u2019s chaotic response in Uvalde and officers\u2019 subsequent explanations of their inaction show that the promise of adequate training to respond to a mass shooting has yet to be fully realized.\nOfficers failed to set up a clear command structure. They spread incorrect information that caused them to treat the shooter as a barricaded suspect and not an active threat even as children and teachers called 911 pleading for help. And no single officer engaged the shooter despite training that says they should do so as quickly as possible if anyone is hurt. It took 77 minutes to breach the classroom and take down the shooter.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty stunning that we\u2019re 24 years after the Columbine massacre and we\u2019re still dealing with a lack of training on how to deal with these active assailants,\u201d said Mo Canady, executive director of the National Association of School Resource Officers. \u201cI\u2019m not sure who is to be held responsible for that, but it really is unacceptable that officers are not getting that training.\u201d\nA nationwide analysis by the news organizations shows states require far more training to prepare students and teachers for a mass shooting than they do for the police who are expected to protect them.\nAt least 37 states have laws mandating that schools conduct active shooter-related drills. All but four of those states require them at least annually.\nIn contrast, only Texas and Michigan have laws requiring training for all officers after they graduate from police academies. Texas\u2019 law is the strongest in the country, mandating that officers train for 16 hours every two years. That requirement came about only after the Uvalde massacre.\nThe absence of legislation has created an uneven and inconsistent approach, which fails to ensure that officers not only receive the training they need to confront a mass shooter, but drill often enough to follow it in the adrenaline-soaked atmosphere of a real shooting, law enforcement experts said. Some also emphasize the importance of multiagency training so that officers are not responding to a crisis alongside people they\u2019ve never worked with before. Yet few states, if any, require agencies to train together.\nAbout 72% of the at least 116 state and local officers who arrived at Robb Elementary before the gunman was killed had received some form of active shooter training during their careers, according to an analysis of records obtained by ProPublica, the Tribune and FRONTLINE. Officers who received training before the Uvalde shooting had most commonly taken it only once, which law enforcement experts say is not enough. Only three officers would have met Texas\u2019 new standard for training.\nThe news organizations reached out to each of the officers in this piece. An attorney representing officers with the Uvalde Police Department said the city has ordered them not to comment because of an ongoing internal investigation. Officers with other agencies did not return phone calls, texts and emails or declined to comment.\nAcross the country, officers are increasingly responding to situations with active shooters, some of whom have access to weapons originally designed for war. In the absence of gun control legislation, sales of these types of weapons have increased.\nUnlike military service members who spend the majority of their time training for the possibility that they may someday see combat, police spend the bulk of their days responding to a variety of incidents, most of which do not involve violent encounters. Experts say that leaves many unprepared as the nation\u2019s tally of mass shootings grows.\nNo clear consensus exists on just how much training is sufficient, though experts agree on the need for repetition. Even then, consistent training cannot guarantee that officers will do everything right, said John Curnutt, assistant director at Texas State University\u2019s Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center, which is rated as the national standard by the FBI. Still, Curnutt said, routine training is the best way to improve officers\u2019 response.\n\u201cIt has to be really driven into somebody to the point where it becomes instinctive, habitual,\u201d Curnutt said. \u201cBefore you really get a chance to think about it, you\u2019re already doing it. And it takes more than 10 or 11 times to get that good at something like this that is going to be incredibly difficult to do when you know that, \u2018I\u2019m about to die, but I\u2019m going to do this anyway.\u2019 Who thinks like that? Not everybody. We know that. Not everybody that\u2019s in uniform does.\u201d\nIt was 11:30 a.m. on May 24, 2022. The timer that Elsa Avila set had just gone off, notifying her fourth grade class that the extra minutes she\u2019d given them to make shoes out of newspapers for a STEM challenge had drawn to a close. Now they were going outside to test how long the shoes held up on the school track.\nAvila gathered the children for a photo before they formed a single-file line. At the front, one of the students peered into the hallway. \u201cMiss, there\u2019s a class coming in and they\u2019re screaming and they\u2019re running to their room,\u201d Avila recalled the student saying as the teacher of 27 years described the details of that day to investigators.\n\u201cYou let their teacher worry about them,\u201d Avila replied, believing that the student was simply reporting unruly behavior.\nThis was different, the girl insisted. The children were scared. So, Avila peeked into the hallway.\n\u201cGet in your rooms!\u201d Avila heard a woman scream.\n\u201cSo I just slammed my door back in, turned off the lights and, at that time, the kids know, because we practice these drills, they know: \u2018OK, shut the door, you know. Slam the lights. We\u2019ve got to go into our positions,\u2019\u201d Avila recalled.\nThe educator and her students formed an \u201cL,\u201d crouching down against the two walls that were farthest from the doors and windows. It was a drill they\u2019d practiced so much that, at times, it had become tiresome. The training that Avila had hoped they\u2019d never have to use: Run. Hide. Fight.\nFor now, they hid.\nAvila stood up momentarily to make sure that her students were safe.\nIt was then that a bullet pierced the wall, ripping into the teacher\u2019s stomach.\nAvila fell to the ground and dropped her phone. After dragging herself to the phone, she scrolled through previous texts to find one that included a group of teachers from the school.\n\u201cIm shot,\u201d she wrote at 11:35 a.m., mistakenly texting her siblings before eventually also messaging her colleagues.\nOnly five minutes had passed since Avila\u2019s timer rang for what was intended to be a celebratory moment.\nIn that time, the gunman had entered the building after crashing a truck into a nearby ditch and police had received their first 911 call from a teacher informing them that the shooter was in the school. In those five minutes, the teenage shooter unleashed nearly 100 rounds of gunfire.\nOne of Avila\u2019s students was among those injured. Bullet fragments struck 10-year-old Leann Garcia on the nose and mouth. Blood dripped onto her clothes as her friend, Ailyn Ramos, held her and tried to keep her from screaming out in pain.\n\u201cIf I die, I love you,\u201d Leann whispered to Ailyn.\n\u201cAs long as you\u2019re in here with me, you\u2019re not going to die,\u201d Ailyn later recalled responding in an interview with the news organizations. (Ailyn\u2019s account, like those of all the children named in this piece, is included with the permission of a parent.)\nWith their teacher flitting in and out of consciousness, the children huddled together. For a moment they did something that their lockdown training had not taught them, but that their teacher had always told them to do in difficult times, Ailyn told the news organizations.\nThey prayed.\n\u201cPlease let the cops come in.\u201d\nOutside of the school, Uvalde police Sgt. Daniel Coronado heard the unmistakable gunfire from the shooter\u2019s semiautomatic rifle. \u201cOh, shit, shots fired! Get inside,\u201d Coronado yelled at about 11:35 a.m. while breathlessly running toward the building.\nEntering a smoke-filled hallway, Coronado, a 17-year veteran of the department, walked past printouts of summer sandals that had been brightly colored by children, who were now nearing their last day of school. Seconds later, there was another round of gunfire from rooms 111 and 112, the adjoining classrooms from which the shooter was terrorizing teachers and children.\nThe shots injured Canales and Lt. Javier Martinez, two Uvalde police officers who had initially approached the classrooms. Blood trickled from Canales\u2019 ear and bullet fragments grazed Martinez\u2019s head. Both officers retreated. Though hurt, Martinez again ran toward the door. No one followed. He eventually pulled back. The officers had taken active shooter training only once: Martinez in 2014 and Canales the year before the shooting.\nThe failure to engage the shooter was the first in a handful of critical missteps by officers in the initial 10 minutes. Each ran counter to what the training teaches.\nAmong the missteps was the fact that no one took charge or set up a command post to guide the response, which experts say should happen quickly after arrival. Another was Coronado\u2019s decision to relay an unconfirmed report from a school resource officer that the suspect was holed up in an office. The information proved to be inaccurate, and the misunderstanding helped shape officers\u2019 approach to the incident.\n\u201cMale subject is in the school on the west side of the building,\u201d Coronado radioed at 11:41 a.m. \u201cHe\u2019s contained. We got multiple officers inside the building at this time. Believe he\u2019s, uh, barricaded in one of the offices. Male subject\u2019s still shooting.\u201d\nThough some officers struggled with malfunctioning radios, Coronado\u2019s words reached enough of them to contribute to a widespread belief that the shooter was possibly alone inside a room with no victims, even as evidence mounted that children and teachers were in danger.\nInitially believing he was responding to an active shooter, Texas Department of Public Safety Special Agent Colten Valenzuela told an investigator that his mindset changed after arriving at the school.\n\u201cWhen we did get there, we were told that it was a barricaded subject, so that kind of flipped the direction,\u201d Valenzuela said.\nAsked by an investigator about the determination that the shooter was barricaded, Coronado, who completed active shooter training a decade earlier, said: \u201cI don\u2019t know where that came out of, you know what I mean? You\u2019re just reacting to what you\u2019re dealing with at that moment in time.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see any bodies,\u201d Coronado added. \u201cYou don\u2019t see any blood. You don\u2019t see anybody yelling, screaming for help. Those are motivators for you to say, \u2018Hey, get going, move,\u2019 but if you don\u2019t have that, then slow down.\u201d\nUvalde is among the most striking examples of a botched police response to a mass shooting, but officers\u2019 failures to immediately stop a shooter despite being trained extend beyond the Texas city, according to a ProPublica, Tribune and FRONTLINE review of dozens of after-action reports and publicly released video. In some cases, the delays are well-known. In Orlando, Florida, officers waited about three hours to take down a shooter at the Pulse night club in 2016 despite 911 calls indicating some hostages were shot. The initial officer who responded to the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, never entered the building where a shooter killed 17 students and staff.\nOther missteps have not been as widely scrutinized. In Las Vegas in 2017, two officers stayed on the hotel floor below a shooter instead of rushing upstairs to confront him as he spewed bullets into a crowd of concertgoers. The next year in Thousand Oaks, California, officers attempted to confront a shooter within minutes of arriving at the scene. Some retreated after he shot at them. Police did not reenter to engage the shooter again for more than 40 minutes, even as victims remained inside.\nIn contrast, several officers credited their repeated training after they were celebrated for acting expeditiously to take down a shooter in March at a private Christian school in Nashville, Tennessee. Such instruction, they said, allowed them to momentarily ignore the emotion of stepping over a victim to get to the shooter so as to prevent further harm. About two months later, an officer in Allen, a Dallas suburb, shot a gunman minutes after his killing spree began at an outlet mall. Police and fire officials later praised years of joint training as key to the swift response.\nThe ability to work together was absent in Uvalde, Ruby Gonzalez, a school resource officer, told an investigator. Despite most of the officers being trained, various agencies that arrived at the scene were not accustomed to working together and had their own operating procedures, Gonzalez said.\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t find a way to work together because each agency wanted to do things how they, how they see fit,\u201d she said when asked if she believed the response that day followed the training she had taken.\nAt the time of the Uvalde shooting, Texas required only that school resource officers take an eight-hour active shooter course. The requirement did not apply to thousands of officers in police departments and sheriff\u2019s offices across the state, contributing to vast disparities in training.\nAbout 84% of the DPS officers who responded to the Uvalde shooting before the gunman was killed had been trained. Yet only about 67% of the Uvalde Police Department officers and roughly 36% of the Uvalde County Sheriff\u2019s Office deputies had taken active shooter courses, according to an analysis of records that detail training after officers graduate from academies.\nCollectively, local and state agencies sent at least 116 officers to the Uvalde shooting before the breach. While a majority of those officers had received some instruction to confront an active shooter, about half had not been trained since 2018 or before. That was the year a gunman entered Santa Fe High School near Houston and killed 10 people.\nFederal law enforcement agencies, who sent about 180 officers to the scene before and after the breach, declined to provide training records for their officers, leaving the amount of instruction they received unclear. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, the agency with the majority of the federal officers on scene, said in a statement that it continues to review the response and is \u201ccommitted to identifying any improvements to training or tactics.\u201d\nDPS and the Uvalde sheriff\u2019s office did not respond to questions about their departments\u2019 training. A spokesperson for the city of Uvalde said that since the shooting, officials have purchased equipment like shields and breaching tools and have expanded training to include surrounding agencies.\nUvalde officers will also be among those required to meet Texas\u2019 new standard \u2014 16 hours of instruction every two years.\nThe post-Uvalde mandate is rare.\nIn the vast majority of states, officers are only required to prepare to confront a shooter in academies that train new recruits, but even that can vary widely between four and dozens of hours of instruction. Once those officers get the training, most are not required under the law to ever take it again.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re not training the right way and we\u2019re not preparing ourselves and our kids and our responders, then we\u2019re going to keep doing this for the next 25 years,\u201d said John McDonald, who developed the school safety program in Jefferson County, Colorado, which includes Columbine, after the 1999 shooting. \u201cWe\u2019re going to say, \u2018Geez, for 50 years we haven\u2019t figured it out.\u2019 Well, shame on us.\u201d\nNicole Ogburn, a teacher in Room 102, used her Apple Watch to dial 911 three times but couldn\u2019t get through. On her fourth try, at 11:40 a.m., one of the city\u2019s two dispatchers finally picked up.\nOgburn reported that there was an active shooter at the school, saying she could hear the gunshots outside of her classroom.\nWhile Ogburn was on the phone with 911, dispatchers received another call. This time from Pete Arredondo. The school district police chief, who had taken active shooter training four times during his nearly 30-year career, was supposed to take charge, according to the district\u2019s active shooter plan.\nArredondo, who had dropped his radio on the way into the school and didn\u2019t have a body camera, asked the dispatcher for backup and more equipment.\n\u201cI\u2019m inside the building with this man. He has an AR-15. He shot a whole bunch of times. We\u2019re, yes, we\u2019re inside the building,\u201d Arredondo told the dispatcher. \u201cHe\u2019s in one room. I need a lot of firepower, so I need this building surrounded, surrounded with as many AR-15s as possible.\u201d\nIn that brief moment, Arredondo would learn from the dispatcher what police could not see on the other side of the classroom doors: Someone was injured.\nArredondo does not appear to have shared the information with other officers, according to body camera footage and radio calls reviewed by the news organizations.\nActive shooter training instructs that officers should act immediately if there is reliable evidence that an attacker is killing people or preventing critically injured victims from getting medical attention.\nBut 17 more minutes passed before officers opened the door to Ogburn\u2019s classroom. Even then, their discovery of children was an accident.\nUvalde County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Reymundo Lara recalled to investigators how he came to realize there were children in the room. Lara, who had not taken active shooter training, said he took a tactical position, aiming at the classroom where the shooter remained.\n\u201cI was like, you know what, my feet need to be a little bit more comfortable,\u201d Lara added. \u201cSo, I get up, open the door. I propped it open so I could stick my leg in and lay back down and aim at the classroom where this suspect\u2019s at. Something is telling me, \u2018Hey, just check the classroom.\u2019\u201d\nAt first, Lara did not see anything. The lights were off and a movie played on the TV.\nThen, the deputy spotted children.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Lara yelled. \u201cWe got kids in this room.\u201d\nOfficers rushed to help Ogburn and her students escape through the window. \u201cKids coming out. Kids coming out. Kids coming out,\u201d Coronado said, his body camera picking up the moment they were pulled out through the window.\nCoronado\u2019s heart sank. \u201cOh shit, there\u2019s kids,\u201d he recalled thinking while speaking with investigators. \u201cThat was the first time that we realized, no, there are kids inside the building.\u201d\nThough officers were now aware that children and teachers remained in classrooms, Avila and her students continued to wait to be rescued.\nStill losing blood from the gunshot wound to her stomach, the teacher knew she had to stay awake for her students.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to pass out because I didn\u2019t want to leave them alone,\u201d she recalled in an interview with an investigator.\nMoments of darkness were punctuated by the children trying to keep her calm. She could hear some of them saying, \u201cDon\u2019t let her go to sleep.\u201d\n\u201cMiss, we love you. We love you,\u201d she recalled one telling her. \u201cMiss, you\u2019re going to be OK.\u201d\nAvila could hear the school district chief, who began trying to negotiate with the shooter 24 minutes after officers entered the school.\n\u201cCan you please put your firearm down? We don\u2019t want anyone else hurt,\u201d Arredondo said.\nAt one point, the children in Avila\u2019s class heard people fiddling with their door. \u201cPolice open up!\u201d\n\u201cI thought it was a trick,\u201d Leann, the injured 10-year-old, recalled thinking during an interview with investigators.\nNone of the children said anything. How could they know it was not the shooter?\nIndeed, the students did as they were taught to do in their drills.\n\u201cWe tell kids if someone\u2019s knocking on a door and says, \u2018Police officer, open up,\u2019 don\u2019t open the door. We tell teachers that all the time. And we test it,\u201d said McDonald, who now serves as chief operating officer of The Council for School Safety Leadership, an organization that helps school leaders respond to threats and tragedies. \u201cThat could be someone trying to trick you to come out. Cops have keys. They have the ability to breach. They have tools to get in. They will come in.\u201d\nBut the police didn\u2019t come into Avila\u2019s classroom at that moment. They also did not try to enter rooms 111 and 112, where the shooter remained, after learning from Ruben Ruiz, a school resource officer, that his wife, Eva Mireles, was injured in one of them.\nAt 11:56 a.m., Ruiz pushed urgently through a scrum of officers, attempting to get closer to his wife\u2019s classroom after she\u2019d called to tell him what happened.\n\u201cShe says she\u2019s shot, Johnny,\u201d Ruiz said as an officer stopped him from pressing forward.\nInstead of acting on the information, officers guided him outside and took away his gun.\nOne of the officers who heard Ruiz was Justin Mendoza. The rookie officer, who had only been with the Uvalde Police Department for about two years, had not received active shooter training, according to state records.\nMendoza said officers knew they needed to get into the classrooms, including Mireles\u2019, but they didn\u2019t have the right equipment. His sentiment was shared by more than a dozen officers who, in interviews with investigators, expressed fear of the shooter\u2019s semiautomatic rifle.\n\u201cLike I said, we didn\u2019t have any shields, no, no flash-bangs, no nothing that we could\u2019ve used to create a distraction,\u201d Mendoza recalled, \u201cto, not only, like, not to sound selfish, but make sure we go home at the end of the day, but at least more of these kids can go home at the end of the day.\u201d\nThough officers signed up for the job knowing that they were putting their lives at risk, they\u2019d never been confronted with a mass shooter, Mendoza said.\n\u201cNone of us ever thought any of this situation would ever happen here, in Uvalde,\u201d he said.\nAbout 40 minutes after the shooting began, officers received an urgent broadcast over their police radios that experts said marked another crucial moment that should have prompted them to immediately confront the shooter.\nA child who was in one of the adjoining rooms with the shooter had reported a \u201croom full of victims. Full of victims at this moment,\u201d a dispatcher said over the radio.\n\u201cFuck, full of victims,\u201d one officer said aloud after hearing the radio communication. \u201cChild called 911 and said room\u2019s full of victims.\u201d\nMinutes later, the dispatcher radioed again: \u201cBe advised, we do have one teacher that is still alive with wounds and eight to nine children.\u201d\nOfficers did not hear the grueling 17-minute call in which 10-year-old Khloie Torres and her friend Miah Cerrillo pleaded for help, repeatedly asking for police assistance. They didn\u2019t hear Khloie, who had been struck by shrapnel from the shooter\u2019s bullets, as she quietly begged for them to hurry, telling the 911 operator: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of dead bodies. Please help. I don\u2019t want to die.\u201d The same officers who said that the children\u2019s silence kept them from rushing the classroom didn\u2019t get to listen in as the dispatcher repeatedly told Khloie to keep the children quiet. They didn\u2019t hear her promises that officers were on their way to save Khloie and her classmates.\nDespite some radios not working inside the school, officers who heard the dispatcher\u2019s broadcast now knew that children and at least one adult remained alive, trapped with the shooter on the other side of the door. Those details, along with earlier signs that included sporadic gunfire and information that an officer\u2019s wife was shot but still alive in the classroom, should have jogged in their minds a key lesson from training. They should have moved swiftly to stop the killing and stop the dying, experts said.\n\u201cYou know kids are in there. You know you have a teacher that\u2019s hurt. You\u2019ve been shot at already. You\u2019ve got an officer that\u2019s been wounded. I mean, I think the intel is there,\u201d said McDonald, the school safety expert who reviewed the footage at the request of the news organizations. \u201cThe environment is there. So how do you get in that room? What are your options to get in that room? And I think that has to be a priority. You already had one officer who said his wife was in there several minutes ago. Stop the dying.\u201d\nInstead, law enforcement officers, including members of a highly trained Border Patrol tactical team that had just arrived, continued to wait, even as they received some specialized equipment that they said they needed to breach the metal door and enter the classroom. No one ever checked the door to see if it was unlocked, although a state House committee that later reviewed the shooting determined it probably was.\nDays after the attack, Uvalde police Officer Michael Wally recalled to an investigator the moment he heard there were victims in the classroom with the shooter. It didn\u2019t make sense, Wally told him. Since he arrived at the school, he\u2019d been asking who was leading the response. Who was the officer in charge? No one provided an answer, but he was repeatedly told the school district police chief was negotiating with the shooter.\nArredondo later told the Tribune and investigators that he did not view himself as in charge. He defended his actions and those of others.\n\u201cI kept going back to who is OIC. Who is, who\u2019s, who\u2019s fucking in charge? Excuse my language, but who\u2019s, who\u2019s in charge?\u201d recalled Wally, who last took an active shooter course in 2015. \u201cI\u2019m a patrol officer. I can\u2019t, you know, I\u2019m not in there. I\u2019m not in the hallway. I\u2019m not talking to our gunman. I\u2019m not talking to the guy who\u2019s talking to our gunman. No communication is coming back out to me. So there\u2019s got to be someone else. There\u2019s got to be someone else that\u2019s in charge. Someone tell me what to do.\n\u201cAnd you know this, you\u2019ve probably been wearing a badge a lot longer than I have,\u201d Wally told the investigator, \u201cbut chain of command is everything. And, it was not there.\u201d\nIn the absence of clear leadership and communication, misinformation continued to spread.\nShortly after the radio communication from the dispatcher, a Border Patrol medic arrived. He asked about the victims. A state game warden quickly replied that they had not heard of any injuries. \u201cUh, yes there are,\u201d a Uvalde police detective responded.\nThe medic pushed his way into the building and began setting up a triage station to treat the wounded. There, law enforcement officers, including members of the Border Patrol strike team, huddled, body camera footage shows.\nThe minutes continued to tick away as the team prepared to enter the room.\nThough officers had already broken through windows to evacuate students, they fixated on finding keys to unlock the three classrooms that still had children in them.\nArredondo had earlier decided that they would not enter the two adjoining classrooms that would force them to confront the shooter until they cleared others first, according to his interview with investigators and body camera footage.\nThat left Avila\u2019s classroom. Over the years, the teacher had learned that the only way the door to Room 109 would lock was if she slammed it closed. That is just what she did that day to ensure that the shooter could not enter.\nArredondo later told investigators that he knew his decision would likely be scrutinized, but he did what he thought was best at the time. He said that he believed the shooter had probably killed at least one person inside rooms 111 and 112, but that he knew that children in other classrooms remained alive.\n\u201cThe preservation of life around everything around him, I felt was priority,\u201d Arredondo said.\nOfficers tried prying Avila\u2019s door open with a knife. They also tested various keys that did not work in search of a master key. Eventually, they decided that the only way in would be through the outside and began breaking the window.\nAvila\u2019s students started crying as officers yelled, \u201cPolice, we\u2019re here to help you!\u201d Some ran toward the window. Others waited, Avila recalled. They still did not know whether to trust the voices from outside.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to move until I told them to move,\u201d the injured teacher recalled. \u201cSo, then I stood up, and I told them, \u2018Come on guys.\u2019\u201d\nAs soon as the classroom was cleared at 12:26 p.m., Arredondo signaled that officers could begin breaching the classrooms with the shooter. \u201cGot a team ready to go? Have at it,\u201d he can be heard saying on body camera footage as officers stood around him.\nIt\u2019s unclear if that message ever made it to the Border Patrol tactical team, which was on the other end of the hallway, or if anyone, at that point, was heeding the school district chief\u2019s direction.\nOver the next 24 minutes, Khloie and other children in Room 112 continued to rely on one another for survival.\nDespite the excruciating wait, now more than 50 minutes from the time the shooter had fired the initial volley of shots, the children continued to follow their training. They hid and remained quiet, even as several of them had injuries that made such silence inconceivable.\n\u201cI looked around, and I was like, people were cuddling up to each other, they were like, \u2018I\u2019m going to die,\u2019\u201d Khloie later told an investigator. \u201cAnd I was like: \u2018You\u2019re not going to die. Just be really quiet.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI remember telling everybody that \u2018we\u2019re going to get through this, and just don\u2019t make a sound,\u2019\u201d she added. \u201c\u2018Just be as quiet as a mouse.\u2019\u201d\nInstead of being protected, Khloie told the investigator, she became the protector.\nKhloie worked to calm her classmate Kendall Olivarez, who wailed in pain. Kendall was wedged under a teacher who had been killed by the shooter, and bullets had pierced the girl\u2019s arm, back and leg. Khloie helped pull Kendall from under her teacher. They crawled beneath a table as they hid from the shooter who was in the adjoining classroom. Meanwhile, Mireles, their other teacher, was losing blood and cried out for her daughter.\nKhloie grabbed her foot and tried to comfort her. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared,\u201d she told her.\nDesperate for help, Khloie\u2019s friend Miah dialed 911 one last time, pleading with the operator to send police. They were coming, the dispatcher assured her, adding that if anyone entered the classroom, the children should pretend to be asleep.\nAs she waited, Miah, who had been struck by shrapnel, sobbed quietly into the phone.\nFinally, 77 minutes after the shooter entered the school, 54 minutes after one of the officers reported that his wife had been shot and 38 minutes after a dispatcher shared that there were victims in the classroom, the adults had arrived to help.\nAt 12:50 p.m., a team led by the Border Patrol strike team entered Room 111. The gunman jumped out of a closet, firing at a federal officer and grazing him in the head. Officers returned fire, killing the shooter.\nStill on the phone with the 911 operator, Miah, who was hiding in Room 112, mistakenly thought the gunman was coming for her.\nShe later recalled the moment to an investigator, saying, \u201cI was, like, thinking it was him, he came back in the classroom. And then I look up and it was the police and all my friends started running towards them. And me and my friend were crying because we were scared. We ran to the hallway and I saw people, pass \u2014 dead and then blood on all of the floor.\u201d\nFirst responders tried to rush out the living, taking Mireles, who still had a pulse, outside to be treated by medics. EMS declared her dead about an hour later in an ambulance that never left the school. Two children also had a pulse when they were taken out but later died. With insufficient ambulances to treat victims, police placed six children in a school bus, including Miah, Khloie and Kendall.\nWith them were two state troopers who were suddenly forced to act as medics, although they lacked qualifications. With blood from those who were injured around her soaked into her hair and clothes, and smeared on her face and hands, Khloie cried. She wanted her dad and she wanted to know if one of her friends survived, though she knew the answer even before asking.\nShe also wanted the officer to know that she had tried.\n\u201cMa\u2019am, I was on the phone with the police officer,\u201d Khloie told a state trooper through tears.\n\u201cOh, that was you?\u201d the trooper asked.\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\u201cOK, OK, you were so brave. Y\u2019all were so brave, OK?\u201d the officer said, stroking her head.\n\u201cI was trying not to cry,\u201d Khloie replied."

      "text": "\u201cI\u2019m so scared\u201d: 911 recordings reveal fear and urgency of those trapped in Uvalde elementary school\nSign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they\u2019re published.\nEditor\u2019s note: This story contains audio of people calling 911 during a mass shooting incident.\nThe first two 911 calls came in at 11:29 a.m.\nA man had crashed his truck into a ditch by Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, and he was rushing toward the school with a gun.\nThe gunman fired more than 100 rounds by the time police dispatchers received another call two minutes later. An adult voice could be heard making \u201cshh\u201d sounds for nearly 44 seconds before the phone abruptly cut out.\nMonica Martinez, a STEM teacher who was hiding in a closet at the school, was among several callers from inside the school who followed.\nWhat happened on May 24 in Uvalde is well documented. Hundreds of law enforcement officers from nearly two dozen local, state and federal agencies rushed to the scene. It took more than an hour before they entered the rooms where the gunman was located. They treated the crisis as one of a barricaded suspect who was no longer an active threat. Ultimately, 19 children and two teachers were killed in the worst school shooting in Texas history.\nIn the ensuing five months, the delayed law enforcement response has spurred state and federal investigations. The school district\u2019s police chief was fired. He has publicly contested his termination, saying he was unfairly blamed. The acting Uvalde police chief has also been suspended and a state trooper fired. The chief of the Texas Rangers, the Department of Public Safety unit that is leading the state investigation, retired abruptly in September, as did his deputy in August. Several state police troopers remain under investigation. Officers facing punishment either could not immediately be reached for comment or declined to respond.\nThe Texas Tribune and ProPublica have for the first time obtained recordings of more than 20 emergency calls and dozens of hours of conversations between police and dispatchers that lay bare the increasing sense of urgency and desperation conveyed by children and teachers. In chilling, muffled 911 calls, they begged for help from inside the school.\nAlthough the existence of some 911 calls and body camera footage has been reported publicly, the totality of the recordings show the pervasiveness of the miscommunication that unfolded that day.\nDuring some calls, dispatchers and officers warned that class was supposed to be in session in rooms where the gunman had been shooting. On others, law enforcement officers said they were unaware that anyone aside from the gunman was in the classrooms, even as dispatchers received calls from children seeking help.\nTen-year-old Khloie Torres was one of those children. While state officials previously released a transcript with excerpts from one of Khloie\u2019s phone calls, the news organizations obtained additional recordings of her pleading for help that had not been made public. Khloie survived that day.\nIn an interview, her father, Ruben Torres Jr., said he is \u201cdisgusted\u201d that police did not quickly intervene. The fact that his daughter had to wait so long to get help is \u201cmind-boggling,\u201d Torres said.\n\u201cThere was no control. That dude had control the entire 77 minutes,\u201d said Torres, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have him barricaded. He had the police barricaded outside. It\u2019s plain and simple. The police didn\u2019t go in. That\u2019s your job: to go in.\u201d\nDPS officials did not respond to questions from ProPublica and the Tribune about the recordings. A spokesperson for the city of Uvalde, the police chief, the Uvalde mayor and the county\u2019s chief executive declined to comment.\nCommunication was a key failure throughout the response. Many officers assumed the school police chief, Pete Arredondo, was in command. He did not have his radios with him, issued few orders and later said he never viewed himself as the officer in charge. County officials said emergency communications were overwhelmed in the rural community, which typically has only two dispatchers answering 911 calls and juggling the transmission of key information to emergency responders.\nThe emergency radio system has two 911 lines and three emergency channels. Its frequency is designed for the vast, 15,000-square-mile stretch of scrubby desert terrain, rather than for high-density urban areas where equipment must work inside buildings, said Forrest Anderson, the county\u2019s emergency management coordinator who oversaw the radio system\u2019s implementation two decades ago. A legislative committee that later examined the response noted that city police radios worked only intermittently inside the school.\nRadio traffic and footage obtained by the news organizations show that some police knew about the 911 calls, but just how many officers remains unclear.\nHigh-stakes emergency responses always have some communications gaps, but skilled incident commanders should be prepared to overcome such challenges, said Bob Harrison, a former California police chief and homeland security researcher at the Rand Corp., a national think tank.\nHarrison noted that many of the radios used by Border Patrol agents also did not work during the Uvalde shooting response, but the agency\u2019s SWAT team, which does not typically lead the response in school shootings because it is a federal agency focused on immigration and national security, mobilized to breach the classroom once it arrived and determined no one was in control.\n\u201cIf a strong unifying command scene was set up quickly, these discrepancies wouldn\u2019t have been necessarily relevant, and there would have been one voice and one command,\u201d Harrison said of the problems with 911 and radio communication.\nThe state legislative committee reached a similar conclusion in its July investigative report, which stated that a capable incident commander would have realized that the radios were \u201cmostly ineffective\u201d and that responders needed other means of communication to transmit key details such as calls from victims inside the classrooms. The report highlighted that law enforcement is trained to be \u201cprepared to respond effectively without reliable radio communications\u201d and could employ a series of strategies including using \u201crunners\u201d to deliver messages in person.\nBut that day, children and teachers, including Martinez, waited to be rescued.\nIn the dark closet of room 116, Martinez stayed on the phone with a dispatcher and tried to practice a key tenet of the school\u2019s active-shooter protocol: Be quiet.\nClass should be in session\nWhen a new round of gunshots rang out from behind the closed door of the two adjoining classrooms, Uvalde police Sgt. Daniel Coronado sprinted outside, panting heavily as he relayed an urgent message on his radio to city police dispatchers.\n\u201cHe\u2019s inside the building,\u201d Coronado said of the shooter at 11:38 a.m. \u201cWe have him contained.\u201d\nHe asked for ballistic shields and requested that someone call DPS.\nThen he repeated: \u201cHe\u2019s contained. We\u2019ve got multiple officers inside the building at this time. We believe he\u2019s barricaded in one of the offices. Male subject is still shooting.\u201d\nFour minutes later, a male voice, unclear from which agency, asked that someone check the classroom of fourth-grade teacher Eva Mireles, a 44-year-old educator and the wife of Ruben Ruiz, a Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District police officer. Mireles was assigned to classroom 112, one of two adjoining rooms where the shots were coming from.\n\u201cSee if the class is in there right now or if they\u2019re somewhere else,\u201d the official said.\nAnother officer gasped.\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be Ruben\u2019s girl,\u201d he said, referring to Mireles.\n\u201cOh no, oh no,\u201d Coronado muttered under his breath.\nThe exchange demonstrates some officers knew early on that the gunman was not barricaded alone in the classroom. More indicators, and clear confirmations, would come soon after \u2014 yet for much of the response, they would not be heard.\nAt 11:48 a.m., Ruiz, who was standing in the hallway outside of the classroom, told officers that his wife had been shot. Ruiz said his wife had called him and said she was \u201cdying.\u201d Mireles later died in an ambulance.\nOfficers escorted Ruiz outside, taking away his weapon for his safety, according to interviews officers at the scene later gave to the Texas Rangers. But they did not attempt to enter the classroom. One of the police lieutenants who heard Ruiz\u2019s announcement told investigators that they were waiting for DPS and Border Patrol to arrive \u201cwith better equipment like rifle-rated shields.\u201d\nBy that time, Martinez, the teacher, had been on the phone with 911 for more than 10 minutes. She had told the dispatcher that she could hear people in the hallway. The dispatcher urged her to stay quiet and remain barricaded in the closet.\n\u201cYou still there with me?\u201d the dispatcher asked at about 11:47 a.m.\n\u201cI\u2019m still here,\u201d Martinez whispered.\nSeven minutes later, an officer asked if any children were inside with the gunman.\n\u201cNo, we don\u2019t know anything about that,\u201d another officer replied on the radio.\n\u201cEverything is closed, like the kids are not in there,\u201d a third responded.\nAbout a minute later, an officer asked for the shooter\u2019s location.\n\u201cThe school chief of police is in there with him,\u201d another officer replied.\nAs the back-and-forth continued, law enforcement officers rescued people from other classrooms. At 11:58 a.m., Martinez told the dispatcher that she again heard someone knocking. She said the person had identified themselves as a police officer.\n\u201cOpen the door,\u201d the dispatcher said, confirming that the person on the other side was law enforcement. \u201cStay on the line with me until you make contact with him.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d the teacher whispered.\nHer sobs carried through the phone.\nThe teacher did not return calls and emails seeking comment.\nConfusion marks response\nSome children in classrooms 111 and 112 with the gunman kept calling 911, seeking help even when they suspected it was not safe to speak. One of the first calls from a trapped student, at 12:03 p.m., was barely audible.\nThe call lasted a minute and 24 seconds. The child was silent as the dispatcher asked their name and what room they were in.\n\u201cHello, ma\u2019am? Can you hear me?\u201d the dispatcher asked.\nThen at 12:10 p.m., Khloie called.\n\u201cThere is a lot of bodies,\u201d The New York Times previously reported that she told a dispatcher, adding that her teacher had been shot but was still alive.\nKhloie stayed on the phone for more than 17 minutes. While she spoke, another city police dispatcher answered a call from DPS and erroneously reported that the school police chief was inside the classroom with the gunman.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sending everybody that we can, um, heading out there, but do you have any injuries, fatals, anything?\u201d the DPS dispatcher responded.\nOnly one female was shot, and perhaps an officer was injured, the Uvalde dispatcher replied.\nA dispatcher\u2019s voice crackled through the Uvalde police and Border Patrol radio traffic, notifying that she had a child on the line.\nHallway surveillance video from inside the school at the time shows at least four law enforcement officials, one with a shield, kneeling outside the classroom door with their guns drawn.\nIt is not clear if the officers heard that message.\nAt 12:14 p.m., a state trooper\u2019s body camera captured someone saying, \u201cThere\u2019s victims in there, dude.\u201d The trooper was standing outside a door to the school, with at least eight officers from different agencies visible from that camera angle.\n\u201cWe need to get in there,\u201d one responded.\nNo one did.\nFive minutes later, another girl in room 111 called 911. The recording of the call, which lasted a minute and 17 seconds, is mostly inaudible.\nIn the hallway, Uvalde County Constable Emmanuel Zamora wrongly suggested that the gunman may have already shot himself.\n\u201cOne shot at the end was self-inflicted, maybe,\u201d Zamora said in the recording, referring to an earlier burst of gunfire.\nZamora did not respond to texts and emails about his comments, which had not been previously reported.\nIt was the first time he acknowledged to other responders that anyone was wounded inside the two classrooms, according to new footage obtained by the news organizations. The legislative report noted only that he acknowledged \u201csome casualties\u201d 14 minutes later. Arredondo did not return a message seeking comment shared with him by his former attorney.\nA minute later, the gunman fired again.\nOfficers in the hallway flinched, formed a line and started walking down the hall, then suddenly stopped, a state trooper\u2019s body camera footage reveals.\nJust after the shots were fired at 12:21 p.m., the school chief began trying to talk to the shooter for the first time, according to communications and records.\n\u201cIf you can hear me, sir, please put your firearm down, sir,\u201d Arredondo said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone else hurt.\u201d\nJust after 12:30 p.m., three troopers again advanced toward the classrooms before an unidentified person said \u201cno, no, no,\u201d according to body camera footage.\nOnce again, they stopped.\nA DPS trooper who made his way into the hallway around that time asked another officer if there were children in the classroom. The response was, \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d\nBy then, more than 20 minutes had lapsed since Khloie first begged a dispatcher for help. She ended the initial call when she feared the gunman, who she felt taunted the children, was getting close, her father later recalled.\nShe called 911 again at 12:36 p.m.\nAbout two minutes later, Khloie once more asked for police.\nYet again, a dispatcher tried to reassure her.\n\u201cI have someone that is trying to get to you, OK,\u201d she said.\nKhloie whispered that she thought she heard the police next door.\n\u201cThat was you?\u201d\nAs the Border Patrol strike team was almost ready to breach, DPS Capt. Joel Betancourt went on the radio and ordered the agents to wait.\nThe captain did not respond to requests for comment left for him through DPS.\nThe team ignored the order and entered the classroom, quickly killing the shooter. The previously silent hallway filled with officers waiting to act.\nSomeone yelled, \u201cMake a hole!\u201d as police carried out wounded children. Law enforcement officers motioned for those who were not as severely injured to walk out on their own.\nAs the onsite paramedics focused on the most critically injured, officers began taking other hurt children to the hospital. Khloie was among them.\n\u201cI was on the phone with a police officer,\u201d she told the trooper examining her as the screams of other wounded children reverberated in the background.\nThe officer, whose body camera had earlier picked up a dispatcher describing that call, seemed surprised.\n\u201cOh, that was you?\u201d the trooper asked.\nUriel J.

      "text": "UVALDE COUNTY, Texas \u2013 Former Uvalde CISD officer Adrian Gonzales, who was charged in connection with the Robb Elementary shooting, has asked a judge to move his trial outside Uvalde County, court records show.\nGonzales was indicted on 29 counts of endangering a child for his response to the 2022 Robb Elementary School shooting, where 19 children and two teachers died.\nIn the motion for a change of venue filed Monday, Gonzales\u2019 defense team argued that he cannot receive a fair trial by a jury in Uvalde County due to the impact the massacre had on members of the community.\n\u201cThis horrific tragedy touched every member of the Uvalde community,\u201d Gonzales\u2019 attorney Nico LaHood said. \u201cIt would be impossible to gather a jury that would not view the evidence through their own pain and grief.\u201d\nLaHood reiterated that Gonzales pleaded not guilty to the charges in 2024. His trial is scheduled to start later this year.\nIn the defense\u2019s motion, Uvalde Police Department\u2019s public information officer Julisabel Rodrigues Alvarado supported the request.\n\u201cIt is my opinion and belief that Adrian Gonzales cannot obtain a fair trial and an impartial jury in Uvalde County due to the prejudice arising from the emotional wounds, grief, and publicity widespread in the community,\u201d Alvarado\u2019s affidavit stated.\nEdward Trevino, a transportation manager for Vulcan Materials in Uvalde, also expressed his support for the motion.\nEach charge against Gonzales carries up to two years in jail if convicted, according to the Associated Press.\nFormer UCISD police Chief Pete Arredondo was also indicted and pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of child endangerment. Arredondo has been described as the on-scene commander of the law enforcement response.\nNearly 400 officers waited more than 70 minutes before confronting the 18-year-old gunman in two adjoining classrooms filled with dead and wounded children and teachers, even as kids inside called 911 and pleaded for help.\nGonzales and Arredondo are the only two responding officers to have been charged in connection with the response.\nOn Monday, UCISD released thousands of public records related to the tragedy.

      "text": "Findings reveal need for clarity in legal authorities and agency policy, training; Leadership commits to take immediate action in commitment to supporting workforce and community resilience\nWASHINGTON\u2014Today, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) published the findings of the Office of Professional Responsibility\u2019s (OPR) Critical Incident Review (\u201cinvestigation\u201d) of the CBP response to the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, on May 24, 2022.\n\u201cThe active shooter incident at Robb Elementary School was a profound tragedy and deeply traumatic event. The loss of innocent lives and the enduring emotional scars borne by the survivors, families, community, and first responders are immeasurable,\u201d said CBP Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Commissioner Troy A. Miller. \u201cAs our report indicates, we are committed to, and working with our federal, state, and local partners to ensure that our brave officers and agents have effective training, policy guidance, equipment, and legal authority to respond to critical incidents.\u201d\nOn May 24, 2022, CBP personnel stationed in the area responded immediately to the incident, together with local law enforcement. Many CBP personnel live in Uvalde; and they work to protect their community, families, friends, and neighbors every single day. The investigation concluded none of the CBP personnel operating at the scene were found to have violated any rule, regulation, or law, and no CBP personnel were referred for disciplinary action. This investigation was conducted by dozens of OPR special agents, who reviewed thousands of hours of video and conducted over 200 interviews.\nSeparately, in accordance with agency policy, CBP\u2019s National Use of Force Review Board (NUFRB) held a special session in July to evaluate the compliance with agency policy and procedures of the USBP agents who utilized force to eliminate the threat at Robb Elementary School. The NUFRB Board, which consists of senior officials from CBP\u2019s law enforcement component offices, as well as senior representatives from Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), and the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, determined that the agents acted within CBP policy for use of force and also did not identify any misconduct by CBP personnel.\nThe CBP OPR investigation identified several key issues:\n- A lack of clear federal authority that appropriately addresses CBP personnel intervening or engaging in a state-level or local-level emergency response to a mass-casualty criminal or critical incident.\n- A lack of command and control, with multiple law enforcement agencies responding to the scene but no established command and control framework.\n- Gaps in current training that do not address scenarios in which breaching tactics were required in cases involving locked doors to engage an armed suspect.\nFollowing an internal assessment in advance of the OPR report, as well as the recommendations being released today, CBP leadership has initiated a series of actions to identify remedies for the issues raised in the report. These include:\n- Changing policies to address CBP interactions with local and state law enforcement agencies during critical incident responses;\n- Reevaluating training standards to reflect lessons learned; and\n- Improving operational methods to better address the command-and-control issues that occurred during the incident.\nSet forth below is a more detailed overview of the investigative process, the investigative results, and the actions U.S. Customs and Border Protection is taking in response to the investigative report.\nInvestigative Process\nCBP\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility is an independent office within CBP that reports directly to the Commissioner and is responsible for conducting criminal and administrative investigations, responding to and reviewing use of force and critical incidents, reviewing in-custody and other deaths, and producing analysis to identify and mitigate threats to CBP. The Commissioner is not involved in the fact-finding investigative process.\nCBP OPR began its investigation of what occurred in Uvalde in the immediate aftermath of the incident. The investigation documented the facts and circumstances of the incident; assessed whether CBP personnel complied with all relevant policies, regulations, and laws; and identified factors that could mitigate future similar incidents. Consistent with CBP OPR\u2019s investigative procedures, investigators first notified the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) and subsequently coordinated with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).\nInvestigative Results\nThe CBP OPR investigation identified several organizational and scene management issues with respect to lack of command and control, insufficient policy guidance, and training of CBP officers and agents.\nThe OPR investigation into the Uvalde incident established the following findings:\n1. Legal Authorities\n- CBP personnel had an inconsistent understanding of their legal authorities to respond alongside state and local law enforcement agencies to non-federal emergencies, including active shooter situations. Addressing the issue of vague and misunderstood law enforcement authorities could lead to more effective incident responses in the future.\n- Under existing statutes, the legal authority for CBP personnel to either unilaterally initiate, or otherwise assist, a law enforcement response to a life-threatening local, non-federal, mass-casualty or active threat critical incident \u2013 such as an active shooter \u2013 could be no more than that of a private citizen.\n2. Command and Control\n- CBP personnel received no instructions from state or local law enforcement leaders on scene.\n- No arriving federal, state, or local law enforcement personnel established an identifiable incident command and control framework, which ultimately resulted in delays, inaction, and potential further loss of life.\n- None of the first responders or CBP personnel who were in a position to take action against the assailant had access to an accurate school layout or understanding of where to locate the necessary keys for entry to critical areas of the school, which may have been mitigated by a functioning command and control system.\n- CBP personnel established a medical triage area to provide lifesaving care for victims. However, the overall confusion at the scene, exacerbated by the lack of an established command and control system, contributed to a breakdown of adherence to established mass-casualty medical protocols.\n3. Active Shooter and Incident Management Training\n- The CBP OPR investigation determined that existing CBP training on active shooter response procedures was insufficient for the active shooter incident at Robb Elementary School. Training and curricula available at the time of the review focused on incidents on federal property, and did not include the proper application of National Incident Management System (NIMS) or Incident Command System (ICS) protocols. ICS is FEMA\u2019s nationally-recognized, standardized approach to incident management that is trained and used by states and localities as well as the federal government to respond to incidents small and large, planned and unplanned. ICS enables a coordinated response among different jurisdictions and agencies that covers facilities, equipment, and personnel.\n- The training did not prepare CBP personnel for incidents in which they would be responding to a situation at a school, where an active shooter would be engaged behind a locked door, and where local authorities had not established a command and control framework. It also insufficiently covered using a ballistic shield, legal authorities, leadership responsibilities, and agency interoperability.\nRecommendations\nIn response to the investigation\u2019s findings, the CBP Office of Professional Responsibility is issuing the following recommendations:\n1. Legal Authorities\n- CBP must ensure its law enforcement personnel have a clear understanding of their legal authorities to engage with state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement agencies on non-federal issues.\n- CBP must act to generate policies with respect to cases of non-federal mass-casualty, or active threat scenes, and pursue statutory changes to clearly define federal law enforcement authority to act in such cases.\n2. Training\n- All CBP personnel assigned to specialized units who are tasked with responding to dynamic incidents such as the active shooter at Robb Elementary School should be properly trained, and also familiarized with NIMS and ICS protocols. Existing training curricula should be revised and continuously adapted to emerging best practices and lessons learned.\n- CBP should establish procedures for following medical triage best practices in mass-casualty incidents, and provide the necessary training to CBP personnel that may be tasked with responding to these types of critical incidents.\nActions Taken\nCBP has proactively taken significant internal actions to address issues pertaining to legal authorities and relevant policy well in advance of this report. These initiatives reflect CBP\u2019s steadfast commitment to responsibility, continuous evaluation and improvement, and effective law enforcement collaboration. CBP will take additional steps to address the report\u2019s findings and recommendations.\n- CBP has reviewed the varying Peace Officer status levels conveyed by the 50 states and U.S. territories to federal law enforcement personnel. CBP issued a comprehensive, agency-wide policy directive to CBP agents, officers, and managers to ensure its uniformed personnel fully understand their legal authorities and expected actions concerning mass-casualty or active threat critical incidents in state, local, tribal, and territorial jurisdictions. This information will be added to CBP use of force instructor training programs and will be disseminated to agents and officers as part of their regular use of force proficiency and training requirements.\n- CBP is actively pursuing legislative action to address its authority to respond to non-federal mass-casualty or active threat situations.\n- CBP has already begun delivering wider training on ICS directed towards personnel assigned to specialized units who are tasked with responding to dynamic incidents. CBP is developing the expansion of this training to include all CBP Supervisory personnel. CBP is assessing the requirements needed to expand the upward propagation of ICS fundamentals beginning at the basic academies, to be conjoined as employees progress into leadership roles.\n- CBP has updated its active shooter training, in concert with the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC), and expects to make additional refinements in the months ahead.\n- CBP is assessing the need for additional tools, like breaching equipment.\n- CBP is reviewing uniforms and insignia to more easily identify medically trained personnel.\n- CBP is reviewing medical training, credentialing, and equipment.\nConclusion\nAs a professional law enforcement agency, CBP is committed to learning from the incident in Uvalde and improving at all levels. CBP is initiating Agency corrective actions to address the identified vulnerabilities identified in this report, including strengthening incident command practices, improving training, and updating policies governing CBP personnel interactions with state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement agencies. CBP is a major part of the Uvalde community and in addition to the agents assigned to the USBP Uvalde Station, many CBP families from across this region call the city home. The incident at Robb Elementary School was more than just another law enforcement operation for the CBP personnel who responded \u2013 many had a direct, personal connection to the community."

      "text": "A year before Uvalde shooting, gunman had threatened women, carried around a dead cat and been nicknamed \u201cschool shooter\u201d\nSign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nFor 24/7 mental health support in English or Spanish, call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\u2019s free help line at 800-662-4357.

He had also started wearing all black and making over-the-top threats, especially toward women, who he terrorized with graphic descriptions of violence and rape.\nThose details are part of an interim report by the House committee investigating the incident, which points to a trail of missed signs leading to one of the worst mass shootings in Texas \u2014 one that was months in the making.\nThe report, released Sunday, presents the most complete picture to date of Salvador Ramos, the 18-year-old who killed 19 students and two teachers in his former fourth-grade classroom at Robb Elementary. The findings are based on law enforcement interviews with family members, data on the shooter\u2019s phone and testimony presented to the committee.\nHe also shot and wounded his grandmother, Celia Gonzales, before storming the school.\nHe was born in Fargo, North Dakota, but moved to Uvalde as a child with his sister and mother, who struggled with a long history of drug use. A former girlfriend interviewed by the FBI said she believed the shooter had been sexually assaulted at an early age by one of the mother\u2019s boyfriends but that the mother didn\u2019t believe him, according to the report.\nRelatives described him as someone shy and quiet who was reluctant to interact with others because he had a speech impediment. When he started school, his pre-K teacher described him as a \u201cwonderful student,\u201d always ready to learn and with a positive attitude.\nThen, something changed. He started falling behind in school but never received special education services, despite being identified as \u201cat-risk\u201d and having someone request speech therapy for him, according to the report, citing school records.\nFamily and friends told the committee he was bullied throughout the fourth grade over his stutter, short haircut and clothing. He often wore the same clothing day after day. One time, a girl tied his shoelaces together causing him to fall on his face, a cousin said.\nBeginning in 2018, he was recording more than 100 absences a year, along with failing grades. But the report authors said it was unclear whether a school resource officer ever visited his home. By 2021, when he was 17 years old, he had only completed ninth grade, the report\u2019s authors wrote.\nWhen students started to return to school after learning remotely during the pandemic, he dropped out. Instead of trying to fit in, as he had done in the past, he grew more isolated and retreated to the online world. Uvalde High School officials involuntarily withdrew him on October 28, citing \u201cpoor academic performance and lack of attendance.\u201d\nIn an interview with The Texas Tribune, Ariana Diaz, a senior at Uvalde High School and one of the shooter\u2019s former classmates, described him as a \u201cpopular loner,\u201d someone who everyone knew but who kept to himself. She also said that more recently, he seemed to be in what she described as a \u201cdark place\u201d and started wearing all black and combat boots.\nHe became depressed and lonely, those who knew him said.\nHe would tell his girlfriend at the time that he wouldn\u2019t live past 18, either because he would commit suicide or \u201cwouldn\u2019t live long,\u201d the girl later told the FBI in an interview, according to the report. When she broke up with him in mid-2021, he started harassing her and her friends, the girl told officials.\nOnline, the report authors said, he started to show an interest in gore and violent sex, sometimes sharing videos and images of suicides and beheadings. While playing online games, he became enraged and threatened others, especially female players, when he lost.\nPrivately, he wrote about his challenges connecting with others or feeling empathy for them, saying he was \u201cnot human.\u201d His search history, the authors of the report wrote, suggests he was wondering whether he was a sociopath. His internet searches led to him receiving an email about obtaining psychological treatment for the condition.\nAttacking women became a pattern. He was also fired from his job at a Whataburger after a month for threatening a female coworker. And later he was let go of his job at Wendy\u2019s.\nDespite losing his jobs, living at home allowed him to save money. By the end of 2021, when clues of his plans first surfaced, he ordered rifle slings, a red dot sight and shin guards, as well as a body armor carrier he wore the day of the Robb Elementary massacre. But because he was still 17 at the time, he wasn\u2019t legally allowed to buy the weapons, and at least two people he asked refused.\nHe started becoming fascinated with school shootings and increasingly seeking notoriety and fame on social media, the report said.\nIn late 2021, the committee said he shared a video online showing him driving around with someone he said he had met online, holding a clear plastic bag with a dead cat inside, which he \u201cdiscarded in the street and spit on while his driver laughed.\u201d The video then showed him dry firing BB guns at people and ended with footage of emergency services responding to a serious car accident, which he claimed his driver had caused, according to the report.\nBut despite all the threats and violent talk, none of his online behavior was reported to law enforcement. It\u2019s unclear whether other users reported his behavior to any social media platform, but the committee concluded it doesn\u2019t appear there were any actions taken to restrict his access or to report him to authorities as a threat.\nHe moved in with his grandmother, who had retired from the local school district after 27 years, after having a blowout argument with his mother that was livestreamed on Instagram. The report doesn\u2019t specify who livestreamed it, but The Washington Post reported that two months prior to the shooting, he posted an Instagram story in which he screamed at his mother who, according to a high school classmate, he said was trying to kick him out of their home.\nHe confided in an older cousin who was also staying with their grandmother that he didn\u2019t want to live anymore. But the cousin told authorities she thought she\u2019d gotten through to him after a lengthy \u201cheart-to-heart.\u201d\nInstead, he began to buy more firearm accessories beginning in February, including 60 30-round magazines. As soon as he turned 18, on May 16, he started buying guns and ammunition. In the end he bought two AR-15-style rifles and thousands of rounds. In total, he spent more than $6,000, the committee found.\nHe had no criminal history nor had he ever been arrested. There was nothing in his background that kept him from owning the weapons. And while multiple gun sales within a short period of time are reported to the ATF, the committee report authors point out that the law requires purchase of handguns to be reported only to the local sheriff.\n\u201cHere, the information about the attacker\u2019s gun purchases remained in federal hands,\u201d they wrote.\nOnline, the shooter started to reference a timeline, foreshadowing his plans.\nOn April 2, he sent someone a direct message on Instagram, \u201cAre you still gonna remember me in 50 something days?\u201d\nThe person responded, \u201cprobably not.\u201d\n\u201cHmm alright we\u2019ll see in may,\u201d he responded.\nAt least one friend from out of town started to become worried and proposed visiting him in Uvalde. But when the friend said he wouldn\u2019t be able to go until July or August, he said \u201cdamn that\u2019s too late.\u201d\nFive days before he went on a rampage at the elementary school, a man targeted and killed 10 Black people in a Buffalo, N.Y. supermarket. The mass shooting didn\u2019t go unnoticed by the 18-year-old. He saved news stories and other information about it. He also spent time with a cousin\u2019s son who went to Robb Elementary to get information about his schedule and lunch periods, officials reported.\nOn the eve of the shooting, he sent out messages to people about something he was going to do the following day.\n\u201cI got a lil secret,\u201d he wrote to a German girl he had befriended online.\nIt was impossible to do that day, he explained, because he was waiting for something to be delivered.\nHis order of 1,740 hollow-point bullets arrived later that day.\nJoin us at The Texas Tribune Festival, happening Sept. 22-24 in downtown Austin, and hear from 300+ speakers shaping the future of Texas including Joe Straus, Jen Psaki, Joaquin Castro, Mayra Flores and many others.

      "text": "UVALDE, Texas \u2014 Law enforcement agencies across the country should immediately prioritize active shooter training, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said Thursday as he released a scathing report about the handling of the 2022 massacre in Uvalde, Texas, in which lives could have been saved if training protocols had been followed.\nThe Justice Department\u2019s long-anticipated report about the shooting found that \u201ccascading failures of leadership, decision-making, tactics, policy and training\u201d led to the bungled response, which Garland said should never have happened. Nineteen children and two teachers were killed on May 24, 2022.\n\u201cHad law enforcement agencies followed generally accepted practices in an active shooter situation and gone right after the shooter to stop him, lives would have been saved and people would have survived,\u201d Garland said during a news conference on Thursday.\nThe report\u2019s findings about the failure to follow protocol and the lack of sufficient training to prepare officers for a mass shooting largely mirrored the flaws revealed in a Texas Tribune, ProPublica and FRONTLINE investigation published last month that found that states require students and teachers to receive far more training to prepare them for a mass shooting than they require for the police. At least 37 states require schools to conduct active-shooter-related drills, nearly all on an annual basis. But Texas is the only state that mandates that all of its police officers complete repeated training, at least 16 hours every two years. That requirement was implemented after the Uvalde shooting.\nGarland said the report was produced in an effort to offer lessons that would hopefully better prepare law enforcement across the country to respond to future mass shootings. It offered recommendations that included requiring all agencies in a region to train together and providing officers across the country with at least eight hours of active shooter training annually.\nThe vast majority of at least 380 officers from about two dozen local, state and federal agencies who responded to the school had never trained together, \u201ccontributing to difficulties in coordination and communication,\u201d the report stated.\n\u201cOur children deserve better than to grow up in a country where an 18-year-old has easy access to a weapon that belongs on the battlefield, not in a classroom,\u201d Garland said. \u201cAnd communities across the country, and the law enforcement officers who protect them, deserve better than to be forced to respond to one horrific mass shooting after another. But that is the terrible reality that we face. And so it is the reality that every law enforcement agency in every community across the country must be prepared for.\u201d\nMo Canady, executive director of the National Association of School Resource Officers, said in an interview that he appreciates the emphasis the Department of Justice placed on widespread active-shooter training. Still, Canady said he is frustrated that leaders have not already learned that \u201c25-year-old lesson\u201d after the shootings at Columbine High, Sandy Hook Elementary and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\nSince the 1999 Columbine shooting, law enforcement officers have been trained to prioritize stopping the shooter. The report stated that everything else, including officer safety, should be secondary, adding that efforts to engage the shooter \u201cmust be undertaken regardless of the equipment and personnel available.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to understand what the priorities are and, quite frankly, I see there are not a lot of priorities greater than keeping students safe at school,\u201d Canady said.\nKimberly Mata-Rubio, whose 10-year-old daughter Lexi was killed in the shooting, said she hopes the report\u2019s findings lead to action, that \u201cthe failures end today and that local officials do what wasn\u2019t done that day, do right by the victims and survivors of Robb Elementary: terminations, criminal prosecutions and that our state and federal government enacts sensible gun laws.\u201d\nGarland directed questions about whether any officers who responded to the shooting would be criminally charged to the local district attorney, saying that was not within the jurisdiction of the federal government. Uvalde District Attorney Christina Mitchell initially planned to present her case to a grand jury in late 2023 but later told the Associated Press that her investigation would continue into this year. Mitchell said in a statement Wednesday that her office \u201cwill continue our independent review for any potential criminal charges.\u201d\nThe district attorney and the Texas Department of Public Safety have fought the release of records related to the shooting, prompting news organizations, including ProPublica and the Tribune, to sue. A Travis County district judge ruled in the newsrooms\u2019 favor last month, but DPS appealed. The agency did not respond to requests for comment about the Justice Department\u2019s report.\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott, who initially praised the response and later said he was misled, released a statement thanking the Justice Department. He said the state has already adopted some of the recommended measures and would review others.\nThe report, which offers the most comprehensive account to date from authorities about the shooting, echoes many findings from a probe released by a state House committee two months after the shooting.\nIn presenting the new report\u2019s findings, Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta criticized initial misinformation and conflicting accounts provided by officials, including Abbott and DPS.\nThe report noted that the \u201cmisguided and misleading narratives, leaks, and lack of communication about what happened on May 24 is unprecedented and has had an extensive, negative impact on the mental health and recovery of the family members and other victims, as well as the entire community of Uvalde.\u201d\nThe previous mayor of Uvalde requested the federal review days after the shooting when it became clear that the response was flawed. The review was led in part by Sheriff John Mina of Orange County, Florida, who was the incident commander during the 2016 Pulse Nightclub massacre in Orlando.\nAn outside review of that incident found that Florida officers, who waited three hours to take down the shooter, mostly followed best practices, although it stated that the law enforcement agencies in Orlando should update their training and policies.\nIn multiple after-action reviews, including the Pulse report, authors opted not to criticize significant law enforcement delays during mass shootings, according to an analysis of more than three dozen of these reports by ProPublica, the Tribune and FRONTLINE.\nThe Uvalde report was far more critical, finding failures in leadership, command and coordination.\nIt stated that officers wrongly treated the situation as a barricaded suspect incident instead of one in which a shooter was an active threat to children and teachers. Officers should \u201cnever\u201d treat an active shooter with access to victims as a barricaded suspect \u2014 especially in a school, where there is a \u201chigh probability\u201d of potential victims and innocent civilians being present, the report stated.\nOfficers had multiple indicators that should have made it clear they were facing an active shooter, including 911 calls from children and teachers pleading for help, a dispatcher\u2019s announcement minutes after officers arrived that students were likely in the classroom with the shooter, and an Uvalde school police officer announcing that his wife had called to tell him she had been shot, according to the report.\nGupta condemned the medical response, saying that after police breached the classroom and killed the gunman, dead victims were placed in ambulances while children with bullet wounds were put on school buses. Many of those findings were revealed in a 2022 investigation by the Tribune, ProPublica and The Washington Post that determined medical responders did not know who was in charge and that two students and a teacher who later died still had a pulse when they were rescued from the school.\nIn its blistering criticism of responding officers, the report said that supervisors from various law enforcement agencies \u201cdemonstrated no urgency\u201d in taking control of the incident, which exacerbated communication problems and added to overall confusion.\nUvalde school district Police Chief Pete Arredondo, who was listed as the incident commander in the district\u2019s active-shooter plan, had the \u201cnecessary authority, training and tools\u201d to lead the response but did not provide \u201cappropriate leadership, command and control,\u201d the report found. Arredondo could not be reached for comment Thursday through his attorney. He has previously defended his actions and those of others involved in the response.\nBeyond that, no leader from any of the other responding agencies \u201ceffectively questioned the decisions and lack of urgency\u201d demonstrated by Arredondo and Uvalde Police Department Acting Chief Mariano Pargas, who both arrived at the school within minutes of the first round of gunfire. The report listed Uvalde County Sheriff Ruben Nolasco, Uvalde County Constables Emmanuel Zamora and Johnny Field, and an unidentified Texas Ranger as examples of such leaders.\n\u201cResponding officers here in Uvalde, who also lost loved ones and who still bear the emotional scars of that day, deserved the kind of leadership and training that would have prepared them to do the work that was required,\u201d Garland said.\nThe report also found that key officers, including Pargas, had no active shooter or incident command training despite, in some instances, having decades of law enforcement experience. Nolasco, the sheriff, also had no active shooter training and \u201cminimal\u201d incident command training.\nLaw enforcement training academies must ensure that active shooter training instructs officers on how to distinguish between active threats and barricaded or hostage situations, the report said. Officers should be prepared to approach the threat using the tools they have with them, which are often standard firearms. They should not wait for specialized equipment or tactical teams if they know that people are injured, the report stated.\nThe Tribune reported early last year that some officers were afraid to confront the gunman because he had an AR-15 rifle.\n\u201cNo law enforcement agency or community can assume that what happened here \u2014 or in Newtown or in Parkland or in Columbine \u2014 can\u2019t happen in their community,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cThat is our reality.\u201d\nTexas Tribune reporters William Melhado and Pooja Salhotra contributed reporting."

      "text": "When confronted with a mass shooter, the children and the teachers of Uvalde knew what to do.\n\u201cPlease help. I don\u2019t want to die.\u201d\n\u201cJust be as quiet as a mouse.\u201d\n\u201cPlease let the cops come in.\u201d\nMany officers\ndid not.\n\u201cThe kids are not in there.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s, uh, barricaded\nin one of the offices.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s fucking in charge?\u201d\n\u201cSomeone tell me what to do\u201d\nEditor\u2019s note: This story contains explicit language.\nThe children hid. They dropped to the floor, crouching under desks and countertops, far from the windows. They lined up against the walls, avoiding the elementary school doors that separated them from a mass shooter about a decade older than them. Some held up the blunted scissors that they often used to cut shapes as they prepared to fight. A few grabbed bloodied phones and dialed 911. And as students across the country have been instructed for years, they remained quiet, impossibly quiet. At times, they hushed classmates who screamed in agony from the bullets that tore through their small bodies.\nThen, they waited. Waited for the adults, whom they could hear in the hallway. If they were just patient, those adults would save them.\nHundreds of law enforcement officers descended on Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, that day in May 2022. They, too, waited. They waited for someone, anyone, to tell them what to do. They waited for the right keys and specialized equipment to open doors. They waited out of fear that the lack of ballistic shields and flash-bangs would leave them vulnerable against the power of an AR-15-style rifle. Most astonishingly, they waited for the children\u2019s cries to confirm that people were still alive inside the classrooms.\n\u201cI\u2019m watching that door. No screams. No nothing. No nothing. You know. Things you would think you would hear if there had been kids in there,\u201d Cpl. Gregory Villa, who had been with the Uvalde Police Department for 11 years, told an investigator days after the attack that left 19 children and two teachers dead.\nIf there were children inside, Villa said, officers would have probably heard the shooter saying, \u201c\u2018Hey, everybody shut up,\u2019 and then kids are like, \u2018Oh no, I gotta, I want my mommy.\u2019\u201d\nVilla, who received active shooter training four years earlier, was among several officers who told investigators that they didn\u2019t believe children were in the classrooms because they were so quiet. The children\u2019s strict adherence to remaining silent was, in fact, part of their training. Officers\u2019 own training instructs them to confront a shooter if there is reason to believe someone is hurt.\n\u201cI just honestly thought that they were in the cafeteria because it seemed like all the lights were off and it seemed like it was really quiet. I didn\u2019t hear any screaming, any yelling. I literally didn\u2019t hear anything at all,\u201d Uvalde police Staff Sgt. Eduardo Canales recalled to an investigator. \u201cYou would think kids would be yelling and screaming.\u201d\nThe accounts of law enforcement\u2019s actions during one of the worst school shootings in history are among a trove of recorded investigative interviews and body camera footage obtained by ProPublica, The Texas Tribune and FRONTLINE. Together, the hundreds of hours of audio and video offer a startling finding: The children in Uvalde were prepared, dutifully following what they had learned during active shooter drills, even as their friends and teachers were bleeding to death. Many of the officers, who had trained at least once during their careers for such a situation, were not.\nMass shootings have become a fact of American life, with at least 120 since the 1999 Columbine High School shooting. Debates often erupt along partisan lines as anguished communities demand change. When children are gunned down, calls for tighter gun laws are matched with plans for arming teachers and hardening schools.\nOne thing that seemingly unites all sides is the notion of better training for law enforcement. But, in actuality, few laws exist requiring such instruction.\nWatch the Film\n\u201cInside the Uvalde Response,\u201d a documentary that is part of the collaboration, premieres Dec. 5 at 10 p.m. EST on PBS stations (check local listings) and will be available to stream on the PBS App, YouTube and FRONTLINE\u2019s website.\nNew Uvalde school shooting documentary and investigation reveals details of law enforcement\u2019s flawed response\nIn the wake of the Columbine shooting, law enforcement agencies across the country began retooling protocols to prevent long delays like the one that kept officers there from stopping the two shooters. Key among the changes was an effort to ensure that all officers had enough training to engage a shooter without having to wait for more specialized teams.\nMore than two decades later, law enforcement\u2019s chaotic response in Uvalde and officers\u2019 subsequent explanations of their inaction show that the promise of adequate training to respond to a mass shooting has yet to be fully realized.\nOfficers failed to set up a clear command structure. They spread incorrect information that caused them to treat the shooter as a barricaded suspect and not an active threat even as children and teachers called 911 pleading for help. And no single officer engaged the shooter despite training that says they should do so as quickly as possible if anyone is hurt. It took 77 minutes to breach the classroom and take down the shooter.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty stunning that we\u2019re 24 years after the Columbine massacre and we\u2019re still dealing with a lack of training on how to deal with these active assailants,\u201d said Mo Canady, executive director of the National Association of School Resource Officers. \u201cI\u2019m not sure who is to be held responsible for that, but it really is unacceptable that officers are not getting that training.\u201d\nA nationwide analysis by the news organizations shows states require far more training to prepare students and teachers for a mass shooting than they do for the police who are expected to protect them.\nAt least 37 states have laws mandating that schools conduct active shooter-related drills. All but four of those states require them at least annually.\nIn contrast, only Texas and Michigan have laws requiring training for all officers after they graduate from police academies. Texas\u2019 law is the strongest in the country, mandating that officers train for 16 hours every two years. That requirement came about only after the Uvalde massacre.\nThe absence of legislation has created an uneven and inconsistent approach, which fails to ensure that officers not only receive the training they need to confront a mass shooter, but drill often enough to follow it in the adrenaline-soaked atmosphere of a real shooting, law enforcement experts said. Some also emphasize the importance of multiagency training so that officers are not responding to a crisis alongside people they\u2019ve never worked with before. Yet few states, if any, require agencies to train together.\nAbout 72% of the at least 116 state and local officers who arrived at Robb Elementary before the gunman was killed had received some form of active shooter training during their careers, according to an analysis of records obtained by ProPublica, the Tribune and FRONTLINE. Officers who received training before the Uvalde shooting had most commonly taken it only once, which law enforcement experts say is not enough. Only three officers would have met Texas\u2019 new standard for training.\nThe news organizations reached out to each of the officers in this piece. An attorney representing officers with the Uvalde Police Department said the city has ordered them not to comment because of an ongoing internal investigation. Officers with other agencies did not return phone calls, texts and emails or declined to comment.\nAcross the country, officers are increasingly responding to situations with active shooters, some of whom have access to weapons originally designed for war. In the absence of gun control legislation, sales of these types of weapons have increased.\nUnlike military service members who spend the majority of their time training for the possibility that they may someday see combat, police spend the bulk of their days responding to a variety of incidents, most of which do not involve violent encounters. Experts say that leaves many unprepared as the nation\u2019s tally of mass shootings grows.\nNo clear consensus exists on just how much training is sufficient, though experts agree on the need for repetition. Even then, consistent training cannot guarantee that officers will do everything right, said John Curnutt, assistant director at Texas State University\u2019s Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center, which is rated as the national standard by the FBI. Still, Curnutt said, routine training is the best way to improve officers\u2019 response.\n\u201cIt has to be really driven into somebody to the point where it becomes instinctive, habitual,\u201d Curnutt said. \u201cBefore you really get a chance to think about it, you\u2019re already doing it. And it takes more than 10 or 11 times to get that good at something like this that is going to be incredibly difficult to do when you know that, \u2018I\u2019m about to die, but I\u2019m going to do this anyway.\u2019 Who thinks like that? Not everybody. We know that. Not everybody that\u2019s in uniform does.\u201d\nPraying for help\nIt was 11:30 a.m. on May 24, 2022. The timer that Elsa Avila set had just gone off, notifying her fourth grade class that the extra minutes she\u2019d given them to make shoes out of newspapers for a STEM challenge had drawn to a close. Now they were going outside to test how long the shoes held up on the school track.\nAvila gathered the children for a photo before they formed a single-file line. At the front, one of the students peered into the hallway. \u201cMiss, there\u2019s a class coming in and they\u2019re screaming and they\u2019re running to their room,\u201d Avila recalled the student saying as the teacher of 27 years described the details of that day to investigators.\n\u201cYou let their teacher worry about them,\u201d Avila replied, believing that the student was simply reporting unruly behavior.\nThis was different, the girl insisted. The children were scared. So, Avila peeked into the hallway.\n\u201cGet in your rooms!\u201d Avila heard a woman scream.\n\u201cSo I just slammed my door back in, turned off the lights and, at that time, the kids know, because we practice these drills, they know: \u2018OK, shut the door, you know. Slam the lights. We\u2019ve got to go into our positions,\u2019\u201d Avila recalled.\nThe educator and her students formed an \u201cL,\u201d crouching down against the two walls that were farthest from the doors and windows. It was a drill they\u2019d practiced so much that, at times, it had become tiresome. The training that Avila had hoped they\u2019d never have to use: Run. Hide. Fight.\nFor now, they hid.\nAvila stood up momentarily to make sure that her students were safe.\nIt was then that a bullet pierced the wall, ripping into the teacher\u2019s stomach.\nAvila fell to the ground and dropped her phone. After dragging herself to the phone, she scrolled through previous texts to find one that included a group of teachers from the school.\n\u201cIm shot,\u201d she wrote at 11:35 a.m., mistakenly texting her siblings before eventually also messaging her colleagues.\nOnly five minutes had passed since Avila\u2019s timer rang for what was intended to be a celebratory moment.\nIn that time, the gunman had entered the building after crashing a truck into a nearby ditch and police had received their first 911 call from a teacher informing them that the shooter was in the school. In those five minutes, the teenage shooter unleashed nearly 100 rounds of gunfire.\nA child\u2019s drawing for investigators shows how students in Room 109, two doors away from the shooter, followed their training.\nChildren and teachers formed an \u201cL,\u201d crouching against the walls farthest from doors and windows.\nIn the drawing, the child wrote \u201chide,\u201d reflecting a key part of the training.\nOne of Avila\u2019s students was among those injured. Bullet fragments struck 10-year-old Leann Garcia on the nose and mouth. Blood dripped onto her clothes as her friend, Ailyn Ramos, held her and tried to keep her from screaming out in pain.\n\u201cIf I die, I love you,\u201d Leann whispered to Ailyn.\n\u201cAs long as you\u2019re in here with me, you\u2019re not going to die,\u201d Ailyn later recalled responding in an interview with the news organizations. (Ailyn\u2019s account, like those of all the children named in this piece, is included with the permission of a parent.)\nWith their teacher flitting in and out of consciousness, the children huddled together. For a moment they did something that their lockdown training had not taught them, but that their teacher had always told them to do in difficult times, Ailyn told the news organizations.\nThey prayed.\n\u201cPlease let the cops come in.\u201d\nDiverting from the training\nOutside of the school, Uvalde police Sgt. Daniel Coronado heard the unmistakable gunfire from the shooter\u2019s semiautomatic rifle. \u201cOh, shit, shots fired! Get inside,\u201d Coronado yelled at about 11:35 a.m. while breathlessly running toward the building.\nEntering a smoke-filled hallway, Coronado, a 17-year veteran of the department, walked past printouts of summer sandals that had been brightly colored by children, who were now nearing their last day of school. Seconds later, there was another round of gunfire from rooms 111 and 112, the adjoining classrooms from which the shooter was terrorizing teachers and children.\nThe shots injured Canales and Lt. Javier Martinez, two Uvalde police officers who had initially approached the classrooms. Blood trickled from Canales\u2019 ear and bullet fragments grazed Martinez\u2019s head. Both officers retreated. Though hurt, Martinez again ran toward the door. No one followed. He eventually pulled back. The officers had taken active shooter training only once: Martinez in 2014 and Canales the year before the shooting.\nThe failure to engage the shooter was the first in a handful of critical missteps by officers in the initial 10 minutes. Each ran counter to what the training teaches.\nAmong the missteps was the fact that no one took charge or set up a command post to guide the response, which experts say should happen quickly after arrival. Another was Coronado\u2019s decision to relay an unconfirmed report from a school resource officer that the suspect was holed up in an office. The information proved to be inaccurate, and the misunderstanding helped shape officers\u2019 approach to the incident.\n\u201cMale subject is in the school on the west side of the building,\u201d Coronado radioed at 11:41 a.m. \u201cHe\u2019s contained. We got multiple officers inside the building at this time. Believe he\u2019s, uh, barricaded in one of the offices. Male subject\u2019s still shooting.\u201d\nThough some officers struggled with malfunctioning radios, Coronado\u2019s words reached enough of them to contribute to a widespread belief that the shooter was possibly alone inside a room with no victims, even as evidence mounted that children and teachers were in danger.\nInitially believing he was responding to an active shooter, Texas Department of Public Safety Special Agent Colten Valenzuela told an investigator that his mindset changed after arriving at the school.\n\u201cWhen we did get there, we were told that it was a barricaded subject, so that kind of flipped the direction,\u201d Valenzuela said.\nAsked by an investigator about the determination that the shooter was barricaded, Coronado, who completed active shooter training a decade earlier, said: \u201cI don\u2019t know where that came out of, you know what I mean? You\u2019re just reacting to what you\u2019re dealing with at that moment in time.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see any bodies,\u201d Coronado added. \u201cYou don\u2019t see any blood. You don\u2019t see anybody yelling, screaming for help. Those are motivators for you to say, \u2018Hey, get going, move,\u2019 but if you don\u2019t have that, then slow down.\u201d\nUvalde is among the most striking examples of a botched police response to a mass shooting, but officers\u2019 failures to immediately stop a shooter despite being trained extend beyond the Texas city, according to a ProPublica, Tribune and FRONTLINE review of dozens of after-action reports and publicly released video. In some cases, the delays are well-known. In Orlando, Florida, officers waited about three hours to take down a shooter at the Pulse night club in 2016 despite 911 calls indicating some hostages were shot. The initial officer who responded to the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, never entered the building where a shooter killed 17 students and staff.\nOther missteps have not been as widely scrutinized. In Las Vegas in 2017, two officers stayed on the hotel floor below a shooter instead of rushing upstairs to confront him as he spewed bullets into a crowd of concertgoers. The next year in Thousand Oaks, California, officers attempted to confront a shooter within minutes of arriving at the scene. Some retreated after he shot at them. Police did not reenter to engage the shooter again for more than 40 minutes, even as victims remained inside.\nIn contrast, several officers credited their repeated training after they were celebrated for acting expeditiously to take down a shooter in March at a private Christian school in Nashville, Tennessee. Such instruction, they said, allowed them to momentarily ignore the emotion of stepping over a victim to get to the shooter so as to prevent further harm. About two months later, an officer in Allen, a Dallas suburb, shot a gunman minutes after his killing spree began at an outlet mall. Police and fire officials later praised years of joint training as key to the swift response.\nThe ability to work together was absent in Uvalde, Ruby Gonzalez, a school resource officer, told an investigator. Despite most of the officers being trained, various agencies that arrived at the scene were not accustomed to working together and had their own operating procedures, Gonzalez said.\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t find a way to work together because each agency wanted to do things how they, how they see fit,\u201d she said when asked if she believed the response that day followed the training she had taken.\nAt the time of the Uvalde shooting, Texas required only that school resource officers take an eight-hour active shooter course. The requirement did not apply to thousands of officers in police departments and sheriff\u2019s offices across the state, contributing to vast disparities in training.\nAbout 84% of the DPS officers who responded to the Uvalde shooting before the gunman was killed had been trained. Yet only about 67% of the Uvalde Police Department officers and roughly 36% of the Uvalde County Sheriff\u2019s Office deputies had taken active shooter courses, according to an analysis of records that detail training after officers graduate from academies.\nCollectively, local and state agencies sent at least 116 officers to the Uvalde shooting before the breach. While a majority of those officers had received some instruction to confront an active shooter, about half had not been trained since 2018 or before. That was the year a gunman entered Santa Fe High School near Houston and killed 10 people.\nFederal law enforcement agencies, who sent about 180 officers to the scene before and after the breach, declined to provide training records for their officers, leaving the amount of instruction they received unclear. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, the agency with the majority of the federal officers on scene, said in a statement that it continues to review the response and is \u201ccommitted to identifying any improvements to training or tactics.\u201d\nDPS and the Uvalde sheriff\u2019s office did not respond to questions about their departments\u2019 training. A spokesperson for the city of Uvalde said that since the shooting, officials have purchased equipment like shields and breaching tools and have expanded training to include surrounding agencies.\nUvalde officers will also be among those required to meet Texas\u2019 new standard \u2014 16 hours of instruction every two years.\nThe post-Uvalde mandate is rare.\nIn the vast majority of states, officers are only required to prepare to confront a shooter in academies that train new recruits, but even that can vary widely between four and dozens of hours of instruction. Once those officers get the training, most are not required under the law to ever take it again.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re not training the right way and we\u2019re not preparing ourselves and our kids and our responders, then we\u2019re going to keep doing this for the next 25 years,\u201d said John McDonald, who developed the school safety program in Jefferson County, Colorado, which includes Columbine, after the 1999 shooting. \u201cWe\u2019re going to say, \u2018Geez, for 50 years we haven\u2019t figured it out.\u2019 Well, shame on us.\u201d\n\u201cKids in this room\u201d\nNicole Ogburn, a teacher in Room 102, used her Apple Watch to dial 911 three times but couldn\u2019t get through. On her fourth try, at 11:40 a.m., one of the city\u2019s two dispatchers finally picked up.\nOgburn reported that there was an active shooter at the school, saying she could hear the gunshots outside of her classroom.\n911 dispatcher: You can hear the gunshots being fired?\nOgburn: Yeah, they\u2019re in the building. I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s been a lot. A whole lot. And I got a message that somebody, somebody is shot in another classroom.\n911 dispatcher: Somebody is shot in a classroom, ma\u2019am? OK, can you tell me \u2026\nOgburn: Not mine. In another one. Another classroom. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Please hurry. Hurry.\n911 dispatcher: What room number? What room number? Can you tell me what room?\nOgburn: I\u2019m in Room 102.\n911 dispatcher: Is he going to be across from you?\nOgburn: I don\u2019t know where he\u2019s at right now. I got to go. I can\u2019t let him hear me. I can\u2019t let him hear me.\nWhile Ogburn was on the phone with 911, dispatchers received another call. This time from Pete Arredondo. The school district police chief, who had taken active shooter training four times during his nearly 30-year career, was supposed to take charge, according to the district\u2019s active shooter plan.\nArredondo, who had dropped his radio on the way into the school and didn\u2019t have a body camera, asked the dispatcher for backup and more equipment.\n\u201cI\u2019m inside the building with this man. He has an AR-15. He shot a whole bunch of times. We\u2019re, yes, we\u2019re inside the building,\u201d Arredondo told the dispatcher. \u201cHe\u2019s in one room. I need a lot of firepower, so I need this building surrounded, surrounded with as many AR-15s as possible.\u201d\nIn that brief moment, Arredondo would learn from the dispatcher what police could not see on the other side of the classroom doors: Someone was injured.\nArredondo does not appear to have shared the information with other officers, according to body camera footage and radio calls reviewed by the news organizations.\nActive shooter training instructs that officers should act immediately if there is reliable evidence that an attacker is killing people or preventing critically injured victims from getting medical attention.\nBut 17 more minutes passed before officers opened the door to Ogburn\u2019s classroom. Even then, their discovery of children was an accident.\nUvalde County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Reymundo Lara recalled to investigators how he came to realize there were children in the room. Lara, who had not taken active shooter training, said he took a tactical position, aiming at the classroom where the shooter remained.\n\u201cI was like, you know what, my feet need to be a little bit more comfortable,\u201d Lara added. \u201cSo, I get up, open the door. I propped it open so I could stick my leg in and lay back down and aim at the classroom where this suspect\u2019s at. Something is telling me, \u2018Hey, just check the classroom.\u2019\u201d\nAt first, Lara did not see anything. The lights were off and a movie played on the TV.\nThen, the deputy spotted children.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Lara yelled. \u201cWe got kids in this room.\u201d\nOfficers rushed to help Ogburn and her students escape through the window. \u201cKids coming out. Kids coming out. Kids coming out,\u201d Coronado said, his body camera picking up the moment they were pulled out through the window.\nCoronado\u2019s heart sank. \u201cOh shit, there\u2019s kids,\u201d he recalled thinking while speaking with investigators. \u201cThat was the first time that we realized, no, there are kids inside the building.\u201d\n11:56 a.m.\nUvalde Police Sgts. Daniel Coronado and Donald Page tell another officer outside of the school that there are no children inside.\n11:57 a.m.\nUvalde County Sheriff's Deputy Reymundo Lara opens a classroom door and discovers children inside.\n11:58 a.m.\nThe children are evacuated from their classroom through the window.\n\u201cI thought it was a trick\u201d\nThough officers were now aware that children and teachers remained in classrooms, Avila and her students continued to wait to be rescued.\nStill losing blood from the gunshot wound to her stomach, the teacher knew she had to stay awake for her students.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to pass out because I didn\u2019t want to leave them alone,\u201d she recalled in an interview with an investigator.\nMoments of darkness were punctuated by the children trying to keep her calm. She could hear some of them saying, \u201cDon\u2019t let her go to sleep.\u201d\n\u201cMiss, we love you. We love you,\u201d she recalled one telling her. \u201cMiss, you\u2019re going to be OK.\u201d\nAvila could hear the school district chief, who began trying to negotiate with the shooter 24 minutes after officers entered the school.\n\u201cCan you please put your firearm down? We don\u2019t want anyone else hurt,\u201d Arredondo said.\nAt one point, the children in Avila\u2019s class heard people fiddling with their door. \u201cPolice open up!\u201d\n\u201cI thought it was a trick,\u201d Leann, the injured 10-year-old, recalled thinking during an interview with investigators.\nNone of the children said anything. How could they know it was not the shooter?\nIndeed, the students did as they were taught to do in their drills.\n\u201cWe tell kids if someone\u2019s knocking on a door and says, \u2018Police officer, open up,\u2019 don\u2019t open the door. We tell teachers that all the time. And we test it,\u201d said McDonald, who now serves as chief operating officer of The Council for School Safety Leadership, an organization that helps school leaders respond to threats and tragedies. \u201cThat could be someone trying to trick you to come out. Cops have keys. They have the ability to breach. They have tools to get in. They will come in.\u201d\nBut the police didn\u2019t come into Avila\u2019s classroom at that moment. They also did not try to enter rooms 111 and 112, where the shooter remained, after learning from Ruben Ruiz, a school resource officer, that his wife, Eva Mireles, was injured in one of them.\nAt 11:56 a.m., Ruiz pushed urgently through a scrum of officers, attempting to get closer to his wife\u2019s classroom after she\u2019d called to tell him what happened.\n\u201cShe says she\u2019s shot, Johnny,\u201d Ruiz said as an officer stopped him from pressing forward.\nInstead of acting on the information, officers guided him outside and took away his gun.\nOne of the officers who heard Ruiz was Justin Mendoza. The rookie officer, who had only been with the Uvalde Police Department for about two years, had not received active shooter training, according to state records.\nMendoza said officers knew they needed to get into the classrooms, including Mireles\u2019, but they didn\u2019t have the right equipment. His sentiment was shared by more than a dozen officers who, in interviews with investigators, expressed fear of the shooter\u2019s semiautomatic rifle.\n\u201cLike I said, we didn\u2019t have any shields, no, no flash-bangs, no nothing that we could\u2019ve used to create a distraction,\u201d Mendoza recalled, \u201cto, not only, like, not to sound selfish, but make sure we go home at the end of the day, but at least more of these kids can go home at the end of the day.\u201d\nThough officers signed up for the job knowing that they were putting their lives at risk, they\u2019d never been confronted with a mass shooter, Mendoza said.\n\u201cNone of us ever thought any of this situation would ever happen here, in Uvalde,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFull of victims\u201d\nAbout 40 minutes after the shooting began, officers received an urgent broadcast over their police radios that experts said marked another crucial moment that should have prompted them to immediately confront the shooter.\nA child who was in one of the adjoining rooms with the shooter had reported a \u201croom full of victims. Full of victims at this moment,\u201d a dispatcher said over the radio.\n\u201cFuck, full of victims,\u201d one officer said aloud after hearing the radio communication. \u201cChild called 911 and said room\u2019s full of victims.\u201d\nMinutes later, the dispatcher radioed again: \u201cBe advised, we do have one teacher that is still alive with wounds and eight to nine children.\u201d\nOfficers did not hear the grueling 17-minute call in which 10-year-old Khloie Torres and her friend Miah Cerrillo pleaded for help, repeatedly asking for police assistance. They didn\u2019t hear Khloie, who had been struck by shrapnel from the shooter\u2019s bullets, as she quietly begged for them to hurry, telling the 911 operator: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of dead bodies. Please help. I don\u2019t want to die.\u201d The same officers who said that the children\u2019s silence kept them from rushing the classroom didn\u2019t get to listen in as the dispatcher repeatedly told Khloie to keep the children quiet. They didn\u2019t hear her promises that officers were on their way to save Khloie and her classmates.\nDespite some radios not working inside the school, officers who heard the dispatcher\u2019s broadcast now knew that children and at least one adult remained alive, trapped with the shooter on the other side of the door. Those details, along with earlier signs that included sporadic gunfire and information that an officer\u2019s wife was shot but still alive in the classroom, should have jogged in their minds a key lesson from training. They should have moved swiftly to stop the killing and stop the dying, experts said.\n\u201cYou know kids are in there. You know you have a teacher that\u2019s hurt. You\u2019ve been shot at already. You\u2019ve got an officer that\u2019s been wounded. I mean, I think the intel is there,\u201d said McDonald, the school safety expert who reviewed the footage at the request of the news organizations. \u201cThe environment is there. So how do you get in that room? What are your options to get in that room? And I think that has to be a priority. You already had one officer who said his wife was in there several minutes ago. Stop the dying.\u201d\nInstead, law enforcement officers, including members of a highly trained Border Patrol tactical team that had just arrived, continued to wait, even as they received some specialized equipment that they said they needed to breach the metal door and enter the classroom. No one ever checked the door to see if it was unlocked, although a state House committee that later reviewed the shooting determined it probably was.\nDays after the attack, Uvalde police Officer Michael Wally recalled to an investigator the moment he heard there were victims in the classroom with the shooter. It didn\u2019t make sense, Wally told him. Since he arrived at the school, he\u2019d been asking who was leading the response. Who was the officer in charge? No one provided an answer, but he was repeatedly told the school district police chief was negotiating with the shooter.\nArredondo later told the Tribune and investigators that he did not view himself as in charge. He defended his actions and those of others.\n\u201cI kept going back to who is OIC. Who is, who\u2019s, who\u2019s fucking in charge? Excuse my language, but who\u2019s, who\u2019s in charge?\u201d recalled Wally, who last took an active shooter course in 2015. \u201cI\u2019m a patrol officer. I can\u2019t, you know, I\u2019m not in there. I\u2019m not in the hallway. I\u2019m not talking to our gunman. I\u2019m not talking to the guy who\u2019s talking to our gunman. No communication is coming back out to me. So there\u2019s got to be someone else. There\u2019s got to be someone else that\u2019s in charge. Someone tell me what to do.\n\u201cAnd you know this, you\u2019ve probably been wearing a badge a lot longer than I have,\u201d Wally told the investigator, \u201cbut chain of command is everything. And, it was not there.\u201d\nIn the absence of clear leadership and communication, misinformation continued to spread.\nShortly after the radio communication from the dispatcher, a Border Patrol medic arrived. He asked about the victims. A state game warden quickly replied that they had not heard of any injuries. \u201cUh, yes there are,\u201d an Uvalde police detective responded.\nThe medic pushed his way into the building and began setting up a triage station to treat the wounded. There, law enforcement officers, including members of the Border Patrol strike team, huddled, body camera footage shows.\nThe minutes continued to tick away as the team prepared to enter the room.\n12:12 p.m.\nUvalde police Officer Justin Mendoza and Uvalde police Detective Jose Rodriguez hear a dispatcher tell officers that a child said Room 112 was full of victims.\n12:18 p.m.\nSix minutes later, state game warden Dennis Gazaway mistakenly tells Border Patrol medic Diego Merino-Ruiz that there are no injured children inside but is quickly corrected by Rodriguez.\nSearching for a key\nThough officers had already broken through windows to evacuate students, they fixated on finding keys to unlock the three classrooms that still had children in them.\nArredondo had earlier decided that they would not enter the two adjoining classrooms that would force them to confront the shooter until they cleared others first, according to his interview with investigators and body camera footage.\nThat left Avila\u2019s classroom. Over the years, the teacher had learned that the only way the door to Room 109 would lock was if she slammed it closed. That is just what she did that day to ensure that the shooter could not enter.\nArredondo later told investigators that he knew his decision would likely be scrutinized, but he did what he thought was best at the time. He said that he believed the shooter had probably killed at least one person inside rooms 111 and 112, but that he knew that children in other classrooms remained alive.\n\u201cThe preservation of life around everything around him, I felt was priority,\u201d Arredondo said.\nOfficers tried prying Avila\u2019s door open with a knife. They also tested various keys that did not work in search of a master key. Eventually, they decided that the only way in would be through the outside and began breaking the window.\nAvila\u2019s students started crying as officers yelled, \u201cPolice, we\u2019re here to help you!\u201d Some ran toward the window. Others waited, Avila recalled. They still did not know whether to trust the voices from outside.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to move until I told them to move,\u201d the injured teacher recalled. \u201cSo, then I stood up, and I told them, \u2018Come on guys.\u2019\u201d\nAs soon as the classroom was cleared at 12:26 p.m., Arredondo signaled that officers could begin breaching the classrooms with the shooter. \u201cGot a team ready to go? Have at it,\u201d he can be heard saying on body camera footage as officers stood around him.\nIt\u2019s unclear if that message ever made it to the Border Patrol tactical team, which was on the other end of the hallway, or if anyone, at that point, was heeding the school district chief\u2019s direction.\nOne last call\nOver the next 24 minutes, Khloie and other children in Room 112 continued to rely on one another for survival.\nDespite the excruciating wait, now more than 50 minutes from the time the shooter had fired the initial volley of shots, the children continued to follow their training. They hid and remained quiet, even as several of them had injuries that made such silence inconceivable.\n\u201cI looked around, and I was like, people were cuddling up to each other, they were like,\n\u2018I\u2019m going to die,\u2019\u201d Khloie later told an investigator. \u201cAnd I was like: \u2018You\u2019re not going to die. Just be really quiet.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI remember telling everybody that \u2018we\u2019re going to get through this, and just don\u2019t make a sound,\u2019\u201d she added. \u201c\u2018Just be as quiet as a mouse.\u2019\u201d\nInstead of being protected, Khloie told the investigator, she became the protector.\nKhloie worked to calm her classmate Kendall Olivarez, who wailed in pain. Kendall was wedged under a teacher who had been killed by the shooter, and bullets had pierced the girl\u2019s arm, back and leg. Khloie helped pull Kendall from under her teacher. They crawled beneath a table as they hid from the shooter who was in the adjoining classroom. Meanwhile, Mireles, their other teacher, was losing blood and cried out for her daughter.\nKhloie grabbed her foot and tried to comfort her. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared,\u201d she told her.\nDesperate for help, Khloie\u2019s friend Miah dialed 911 one last time, pleading with the operator to send police. They were coming, the dispatcher assured her, adding that if anyone entered the classroom, the children should pretend to be asleep.\nAs she waited, Miah, who had been struck by shrapnel, sobbed quietly into the phone.\nFinally, 77 minutes after the shooter entered the school, 54 minutes after one of the officers reported that his wife had been shot and 38 minutes after a dispatcher shared that there were victims in the classroom, the adults had arrived to help.\nAt 12:50 p.m., a team led by the Border Patrol strike team entered Room 111. The gunman jumped out of a closet, firing at a federal officer and grazing him in the head. Officers returned fire, killing the shooter.\nStill on the phone with the 911 operator, Miah, who was hiding in Room 112, mistakenly thought the gunman was coming for her.\nShe later recalled the moment to an investigator, saying, \u201cI was, like, thinking it was him, he came back in the classroom. And then I look up and it was the police and all my friends started running towards them. And me and my friend were crying because we were scared. We ran to the hallway and I saw people, pass \u2014 dead and then blood on all of the floor.\u201d\nFirst responders tried to rush out the living, taking Mireles, who still had a pulse, outside to be treated by medics. EMS declared her dead about an hour later in an ambulance that never left the school. Two children also had a pulse when they were taken out but later died. With insufficient ambulances to treat victims, police placed six children in a school bus, including Miah, Khloie and Kendall.\nWith them were two state troopers who were suddenly forced to act as medics, although they lacked qualifications. With blood from those who were injured around her soaked into her hair and clothes, and smeared on her face and hands, Khloie cried. She wanted her dad and she wanted to know if one of her friends survived, though she knew the answer even before asking.\nShe also wanted the officer to know that she had tried.\n\u201cMa\u2019am, I was on the phone with the police officer,\u201d Khloie told a state trooper through tears.\n\u201cOh, that was you?\u201d the trooper asked.\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\u201cOK, OK, you were so brave. Y\u2019all were so brave, OK?\u201d the officer said, stroking her head.\n\u201cI was trying not to cry,\u201d Khloie replied.\n1:02 p.m.\nKhloie Torres, on a school bus with other classmates, tells Department of Public Safety Special Trooper Crimson Elizondo that she called 911.\nWarning: The following video has a loud ringing sound and shows a distressed child covered in blood that is not her own. We are publishing it with the family's consent.\nMore than two hours after the shooting began, the school was quiet once again.\nDavid Joy, a Border Patrol supervisor in Uvalde, picked up a body camera that an officer dropped. It was still recording.\nOnce in his car, he called his daughters\u2019 school.\n\u201cI need, I need to talk to the principal as soon as I possibly can,\u201d Joy said to the woman who answered the phone, explaining that he was a Border Patrol agent working out of the Uvalde station. After asking if she had heard about what happened, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s some stuff that was extremely like, I, like there are some issues that I have with the way things, I want to be able to talk with somebody to just give you some advice and stuff that kind of slowed us down a little bit that maybe would be able to, God forbid something, God forbid something happen and y\u2019all aren\u2019t set up for it.\u201d\nEpilogue: learning from the past\nIn the weeks that followed the shooting, hundreds of officers recounted their role in the failed response during interviews with state and federal investigators.\nSome said they did all that they could under the circumstances. Others sobbed. They recalled seeing the children\u2019s lifeless bodies, the fear in the faces of the survivors. They had already felt the anger from residents in the city of 15,000 people who were forced to bury two teachers and 19 children, some of whom were related to officers. Several wrestled with whether they could have done more. A few wondered if any amount of training could have prepared them for that day.\n\u201cIt, it, it was a horrific thing and we lost no matter what. Um, I, I, I want to learn from it, you know,\u201d Coronado, the Uvalde police sergeant, told an investigator. \u201cI, I want, I, I, I want, I want an opportunity to have someone better than me tell me, \u2018Hey, we could\u2019ve done this or we could\u2019ve done that.\u2019 You know what I mean? I, I, I, I, I, I want that.\u201d\nTwo children in his family died that day. He did not attend their funerals, telling an investigator that some of his relatives \u201cthink that we fucking let \u2019em die.\u201d\nThe initial probe by the Texas Rangers, the DPS\u2019 investigative arm, is complete but has not been made public. Of the hundreds of officers who responded that day, less than a handful have been fired, including Arredondo. An attorney representing Arredondo released a statement before he was terminated, saying that his client was being used as a \u201cfall guy.\u201d Several officers from various agencies either resigned, were reassigned or retired.\nNews organizations, including ProPublica and the Tribune, have sued the state for records that would help families and the public better understand what happened that day. The state has repeatedly fought their release, citing an ongoing criminal investigation by the Uvalde district attorney, who has said that she plans to present a case before a grand jury this year. A state district judge ruled in the newsrooms' favor, though DPS has said it plans to appeal.\nThe wait for the findings has now grown to 18 months. It\u2019s unclear whether and when they will be released.\n\u201cI just wish someone would have taken charge. I wish someone would\u2019ve \u2026,\u201d Wally, the Uvalde police officer, said while talking with an investigator in the days after the shooting, his voice trailing off. \u201cAnd I know this is going to be open record one day. Let it be on open record. Fuck politics. Someone take charge. Let\u2019s fix this. That\u2019s what I wanted. That\u2019s what everybody wanted.\u201d\nJuanita Ceballos, Michelle Mizner and Lauren Prestileo of FRONTLINE and Zach Despart of The Texas Tribune contributed reporting.\nIllustrations by Pei-Hsin Cho for ProPublica, The Texas Tribune and Frontline\nDesign and development by Zisiga Mukulu of ProPublica.\nGraphics and development by Lucas Waldron of ProPublica.\nCarla Astudillo also contributed design and development.\nInformation about the authors\nLearn about The Texas Tribune\u2019s policies, including our partnership with The Trust Project to increase transparency in news."

      "text": "\u201cHe has a battle rifle\u201d: Police feared Uvalde gunman\u2019s AR-15\nSign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune\u2019s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nEditor\u2019s note: This story includes graphic descriptions of injuries, and one graphic image taken from inside a classroom. We are not publishing images of injured or deceased victims.\nUVALDE \u2014 Once they saw a torrent of bullets tear through a classroom wall and metal door, the first police officers in the hallway of Robb Elementary School concluded they were outgunned. And that they could die.\nThe gunman had an AR-15, a rifle design used by U.S. soldiers in every conflict since Vietnam. Its bullets flew toward the officers at three times the speed of sound and could have pierced their body armor like a hole punch through paper. They grazed two officers in the head, and the group retreated.\nUvalde Police Department Sgt. Daniel Coronado stepped outside, breathing heavily, and got on his radio to warn the others.\n\u201cI have a male subject with an AR,\u201d Coronado said.\nThe dispatch crackled on the radio of another officer on the opposite side of the building.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d that officer said.\n\u201cAR,\u201d another exclaimed, alerting others nearby.\nAlmost a year after Texas\u2019 deadliest school shooting killed 19 children and two teachers, there is still confusion among investigators, law enforcement leaders and politicians over how nearly 400 law enforcement officers could have performed so poorly. People have blamed cowardice or poor leadership or a lack of sufficient training for why police waited more than an hour to breach the classroom and subdue an amateur 18-year-old adversary.\nBut in their own words, during and after their botched response, the officers pointed to another reason: They were unwilling to confront the rifle on the other side of the door.\n\u201cYou knew that it was definitely an AR. There was no way of going in. \u2026 We had no choice but to wait and try to get something that had better coverage where we could actually stand up to him.\u201d\n\u2014 Uvalde Police Department Sgt. Donald Page\nA Texas Tribune investigation, based on police body cameras, emergency communications and interviews with investigators that have not been made public, found officers had concluded that immediately confronting the gunman would be too dangerous. Even though some officers were armed with the same rifle, they opted to wait for the arrival of a Border Patrol SWAT team, with more protective body armor, stronger shields and more tactical training \u2014 even though the unit was based more than 60 miles away.\n\u201cYou knew that it was definitely an AR,\u201d Uvalde Police Department Sgt. Donald Page said in an interview with investigators after the school shooting. \u201cThere was no way of going in. \u2026 We had no choice but to wait and try to get something that had better coverage where we could actually stand up to him.\u201d\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t equipped to make entry into that room without several casualties,\u201d Uvalde Police Department Detective Louis Landry said in a separate investigative interview. He added, \u201cOnce we found out it was a rifle he was using, it was a different game plan we would have had to come up with. It wasn\u2019t just going in guns blazing, the Old West style, and take him out.\u201d\nUvalde school district Police Chief Pete Arredondo, who was fired in August after state officials cast him as the incident commander and blamed him for the delay in confronting the gunman, told investigators the day after the shooting he chose to focus on evacuating the school over breaching the classroom because of the type of firearm the gunman used.\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna get scrutinized (for) why we didn\u2019t go in there,\u201d Arredondo said. \u201cI know the firepower he had, based on what shells I saw, the holes in the wall in the room next to his. \u2026 The preservation of life, everything around (the gunman), was a priority.\u201d\nNone of the officers quoted in this story agreed to be interviewed by the Tribune.\nThat hesitation to confront the gun allowed the gunman to terrorize students and teachers in two classrooms for more than an hour without interference from police. It delayed medical care for more than two dozen gunshot victims, including three who were still alive when the Border Patrol team finally ended the shooting but who later died.\nMass shooting protocols adopted by law enforcement nationwide call on officers to stop the attacker as soon as possible. But police in other mass shootings \u2014 including at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida \u2014 also hesitated to confront gunmen armed with AR-15-style rifles.\nEven if the law enforcement response had been flawless and police had immediately stopped the gunman, the death toll in Uvalde still would have been significant. Investigators concluded most victims were killed in the minutes before police arrived.\nBut in the aftermath of the shooting, there has been little grappling with the role the gun played. Texas Republicans, who control every lever of state government, have talked about school safety, mental health and police training \u2014 but not gun control.\nA comprehensive and scathing report of law enforcement\u2019s response to the shooting, released by a Texas House investigative committee chaired by Republican Rep. Dustin Burrows in July, made no mention of the comments by law enforcement officers in interviews that illustrated trepidation about the AR-15.\nOther lawmakers have taken the position that the kind of weapon used in the attack made no difference.\n\u201cThis man had enough time to do it with his hands or a baseball bat, and so it\u2019s not the gun. It\u2019s the person,\u201d Sen. Bob Hall, R-Edgewood, said in a hearing a month after the shooting.\nRepublican state and legislative leaders, who are in the midst of the first legislative session since the shooting, are resisting calls for gun restrictions, like raising the age to purchase semi-automatic rifles like the AR-15. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has suggested such a law would be unconstitutional, while House Speaker Dade Phelan said he doubts his chamber would support it.\nAbbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and four Republican members of the Legislature \u2014 Phelan, Hall, Burrows and Rep. Ryan Guillen, chair of the House committee that will hear all gun-related proposals, declined to discuss the findings of this story or did not respond. Two gun advocacy groups, Texas Gun Rights and the Texas State Rifle Association, also did not respond.\nLimiting access to these kinds of rifles may not decrease the frequency of mass shootings, which plagued the country before the rifle became popular among gun owners. During the decade that the federal assault weapons ban was in place, beginning in 1994, the number of mass shootings was roughly the same as in the decade prior, according to a mass shooting database maintained by Mother Jones. It also would not address the root causes that motivate mass shooters, merely limit the lethality of the tools at their disposal.\nRelatives of Uvalde victims, like Jesse Rizo, whose 9-year-old niece Jackie Cazares was killed in the shooting, say the comments by police who responded in Uvalde are undeniable proof that rifles like the AR-15 should be strictly regulated.\n\u201c(Police) knew the monster behind the door was not the kid. It\u2019s the rifle the kid is holding,\u201d said Rizo, referring to the 18-year-old gunman. \u201cIt\u2019s the freaking AR that they\u2019re afraid of. \u2026 Their training doesn\u2019t say sit back and wait.\u201d\nA weapon of war\nOfficers arriving at Robb Elementary on May 24 had similar reactions as they realized that the gunman had an AR-15.\n\u201cYou know what kind of gun?\u201d state Trooper Richard Bogdanski asked in a conversation captured on his body-camera footage outside of the school.\n\u201cAR. He has a battle rifle,\u201d a voice responded.\n\u201cDoes he really?\u201d another asked.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the safest way to do this? I\u2019m not trying to get clapped out,\u201d Bogdanski said.\nThey had good reason to worry: The AR-15 was designed to efficiently kill humans.\nArmaLite, a small gunmaker in California, designed the AR-15 in the late 1950s as a next-generation military rifle. Compared with the U.S. Army\u2019s infantry rifle at the time, the AR-15 was less heavy, had a shorter barrel and used lighter ammunition, allowing soldiers to carry more on the battlefield. It also fired a smaller-caliber bullet but compensated for it by increasing the speed at which it is propelled from the barrel.\nA declassified 1962 Department of Defense report from the Vietnam War found the AR-15 would be ideal for use by South Vietnamese soldiers, who were smaller in stature and had less training than their American counterparts, for five reasons: its easy maintenance, accuracy, rapid rate of fire, light weight and \u201cexcellent killing or stopping power.\u201d\n\u201cThe lethality of the AR-15 and its reliability record were particularly impressive,\u201d the authors reported.\nIts bullets could also penetrate the body armor worn by the initial responding officers to Robb Elementary, an added level of danger they were aware of. While most departments, including the city of Uvalde\u2019s, have rifle-rated body armor, it is not typically worn by officers on patrol because of its added weight.\n\u201cHad anybody gone through that door, he would have killed whoever it was,\u201d Uvalde Police Department Lt. Javier Martinez told investigators the day after the shooting. You \u201ccan only carry so many ballistic vests on you. That .223 (caliber) round would have gone right through you.\u201d\nCoronado echoed the concern in his own interviews with investigators about the moment he realized the gunman had a battle rifle.\n\u201cI knew too it wasn\u2019t a pistol. ... I was like, \u2018Shit, it\u2019s a rifle,\u2019\u201d he said. He added, \u201cThe way he was shooting, he was probably going to take all of us out.\u201d\nThe AR-15 is less powerful than many rifles, such as those used to hunt deer or other large game. But it has significantly more power than handguns, firing a bullet that has nearly three times the energy of the larger round common in police pistols.\nThe AR-15 also causes more damage to the human body. Handgun bullets typically travel through the body in a straight line, according to a 2016 study published by The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery. High-energy bullets become unstable as they decelerate in flesh, twisting and turning as they damage a wider swath of tissue. This creates \u201cnot only a permanent cavity the size of the caliber of the bullet, but also a \u2026 second cavity often many times larger than the bullet itself.\u201d\nThe Defense Department report detailed this effect in plainer language, describing the AR-15\u2019s performance in a firefight with Viet Cong at a range of 50 meters: \u201cOne man was shot in the head; it looked like it exploded. A second man was hit in the chest; his back was one big hole.\u201d\nThe Defense Department placed its first mass order for the rifle in 1963, calling its version the M16, and based each of its service rifles until 2022 on this design. The only significant difference between the military and civilian versions of the AR-15 is that the military rifle can fire automatically, meaning the user can depress the trigger to shoot multiple rounds. The civilian AR-15 is semi-automatic, requiring a trigger pull for each round.\nIn the context of mass shootings, it is a distinction without a meaningful difference: Both rates of fire can kill a roomful of people in seconds.\nThat\u2019s what happened in Uvalde.\nIn two and a half minutes, before any police officer set foot inside the school, the gunman fired more than 100 rounds at students and teachers from point-blank range. Several victims lost large portions of their heads, photos taken by investigators show. Bullets tore gashes in flesh as long as a foot. They shattered a child\u2019s shin, nearly severed another\u2019s arm at the elbow, ripped open another\u2019s neck, blasted a hole the size of a baseball in another\u2019s hip. Other rounds penetrated the wall of Room 111, passed through the empty Room 110, punctured another wall and wounded a student and teacher in Room 109, who survived.\nWhen medics finally reached the victims, there was nothing they could do for most, they said in interviews with investigators. Eighteen of the 21 were pronounced dead at the school. Police assigned each a letter of the alphabet and took DNA samples so they could be identified by family.\nRifle popularity surges\nRuben Torres, who saw what the rifle can do in combat while serving as a Marine infantryman in Iraq and Afghanistan, never imagined someone would use it to try and kill his daughter, Khloie, who was wounded by bullet fragments at Robb Elementary.\nThe Corps spends so much time drilling firearm safety into Marines that Torres can recite the rules from memory. Even now, he has no objection to civilians owning AR-15s, but he thinks they should be required to complete training like soldiers because too many who buy one treat it like a toy.\n\u201cYou get people that never served in the military or law enforcement, and yet they\u2019re wannabes,\u201d Torres said. \u201cThey purchase this weapons system, not having a clue how to use it, the type of power and the level of maturity needed to even operate it.\u201d\nIt was customers seeking a military experience who helped spur the rifle\u2019s surge in popularity over the past 15 years, gun industry researchers say. Civilians have been able to buy an AR-15 since the mid-1960s, but for decades it was a niche product whose largest customer segment included police SWAT units.\nA federal assault weapons ban expired in 2004, creating a new opportunity to market rifles like the AR-15 to the general public, said Timothy Lytton, a professor at the Georgia State University College of Law who researches the gun industry.\n\u201cIn the 2000s, there was a shift in the industry\u2019s marketing to people who are not just looking for self-defense, but people who are also looking for some sort of tactical experience,\u201d Lytton said. He said this new consumer wanted to \u201csimulate military combat situations.\u201d\nSales of the rifle exploded. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, a prominent trade group, estimates American gunmakers produced 1.4 million semi-automatic rifles like the AR-15 in 2015, excluding exports \u2014 a figure 10 times higher than a decade earlier. This group of semi-automatic rifles accounted for 89% of the rifles made by domestic manufacturers in 2020, according to government and industry data.\nAs it grew more popular with the public, the rifle also became more popular with mass shooters. AR-15-style rifles weren\u2019t used in any mass shootings until 2007, according to the mass shooting database maintained by Mother Jones, which includes indiscriminate killings of at least three people in public places, excluding crimes that stem from robbery, gang activity or other conventionally explained motives.\nGunmen used the rifle in 5% of attacks that decade and 27% in the 2010s. 2022 cemented the AR-15 as the weapon of choice for mass shooters. They wielded the rifle in 67% of the 12 massacres that year, including a parade in Illinois where seven were slain and a supermarket shooting in New York that killed 10.\nThe death toll in Uvalde exceeded them both.\nThe gunman\u2019s purchase\nLittle is known about what motivated the shooter in Uvalde or why he targeted the elementary school he once attended. But signs of planning, and a fixation on guns, stretched back months.\nBeginning in late 2021, he began buying accessories: an electronic gun sight, rifle straps, shin guards, a vest with pockets to hold body armor and a hellfire trigger, which can be snapped onto semi-automatic weapons to allow near-automatic fire.\nHe faced a single significant obstacle to assembling an arsenal: Under Texas law, the minimum age to purchase long guns like rifles is 18. That hindrance vanished on May 16, 2022, his 18th birthday. He ordered an AR-15-style rifle from the website of Daniel Defense, a gunmaker that has pioneered marketing firearms via social media.\nIts sleek Instagram videos often feature young men rapidly firing the company\u2019s rifles, wearing outfits that resemble combat uniforms. Other posts feature members of the U.S. military. A lawsuit filed by Uvalde victims\u2019 families against Daniel Defense alleges the gunmaker\u2019s marketing intentionally targets vulnerable young men driven by military fantasies.\nThe company rejected these claims and cast the lawsuit as an attempt to bankrupt the gun industry.\n\u201cTo imply that images portraying the heroic work of our soldiers risking their lives in combat inspires young men back home to shoot children is inexcusable,\u201d then-CEO Marty Daniel said last year. The case is ongoing.\nFederal law requires weapons purchased online to be picked up at a licensed dealer, which also performs a background check. The Uvalde gunman had no criminal history and had never been arrested, ensuring he would pass. He had the Daniel Defense rifle shipped to Oasis Outback, a gun store in town.\nThe gunman visited the store alone three times between May 17 and May 20. First, he purchased a Smith & Wesson AR-15-style rifle, then returned to buy 375 rounds of ammunition, then came back again to pick up the Daniel Defense rifle. Surveillance footage from the shop shows an employee placing the case on the counter and opening it. The gunman picked up the rifle, peered down the barrel and placed his finger on the trigger \u2014 a breach of a cardinal rule of gun safety, to never do so until you are ready to fire.\nThe gun store\u2019s owner told investigators he was an average customer with no \u201cred flags,\u201d though patrons told FBI agents he was \u201cvery nervous looking\u201d and \u201cappeared odd and looked like one of those school shooters.\u201d\nAn online order he\u2019d placed for 1,740 rifle cartridges arrived at 6:09 p.m. on May 23. In the eight days after he became eligible to purchase firearms, he bought two AR-15-style rifles and 2,115 rounds of ammunition.\nHe had broken no laws. He had aroused no suspicion with authorities. And, like many mass shooters, he had given no public warning about his plan.\nMay 24, the day of the Uvalde shooting, was most likely the first time he had ever fired a gun, investigators concluded. To do so with an AR-15 is simple: Insert a loaded magazine, cock the rifle to force a cartridge into the firing chamber, slide the safety switch off and pull the trigger. Still, he initially struggled to attach the magazine correctly in the previous days, a relative recalled to investigators, and it kept falling to the floor.\nHe figured it out by the time he pointed one of the rifles at his grandmother and shot her in the face, amid a dispute about his cellphone plan. The bullet tore a gash in the right side of her face; she required a lengthy hospitalization but survived. He took only the Daniel Defense rifle to the school, leaving the Smith & Wesson at his grandmother\u2019s truck, which he had stolen, driven three blocks and crashed on the west edge of the elementary campus.\nWhen other officers hesitated\nThe 77-minute delay in breaching the fourth grade classroom was an \u201cabject failure\u201d that set the law enforcement profession back a decade, the Texas state police director said in June. Police had failed to follow protocol developed after the 1999 Columbine school shooting that states the first priority is to confront shooters and stop the killing. Yet even beyond Uvalde, the performance of police against active shooters with AR-15-style rifles \u2014 which were rarely used in mass shootings when the standards were developed \u2014 is inconsistent.\nWhen a gunman began firing an AR-15-style rifle in 2016 at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, an officer providing security waited six minutes for backup before pursuing the suspect into the club; he later said his handgun was \u201cno match\u201d for the shooter\u2019s rifle.\nTwo years later, a sheriff\u2019s deputy at Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida did not confront the AR-15-wielding shooter there, either. Investigators said he instead retreated for four and a half minutes, during which the gunman shot 10 students and teachers, six fatally.\nIn some instances, police have confronted the rifle without hesitation. Officers killed a gunman who had fatally shot seven people in a 2019 shooting spree in Midland and Odessa. During the 2021 supermarket shooting in Boulder, Colorado, one of the 10 victims the gunman killed with his AR-15 was one of the first responding officers.\nThe extreme stress the body experiences in a gunfight slows critical thinking and motor skills, said Massad Ayoob, a police firearms trainer since the 1970s. Officers can overcome this with repeated training that is as realistic as possible, he said. Without it, they are more likely to freeze or retreat.\n\u201cHave you ever been in a firefight? Have you ever been in a situation where you were about to die?\u201d said Kevin Lawrence, a law enforcement officer for 40 years and the executive director of the Texas Municipal Police Association. \u201cNone of us knows how we\u2019re going to react to that circumstance until we\u2019re in it.\u201d\nImproved training that reinforces the expectation that police immediately confront active shooters would improve the likelihood that they do so, said Jimmy Perdue, president of the Texas Police Chiefs Association. But because they attack at random locations and times, he said it is unrealistic to expect that all 800,000 law enforcement officers in the United States would be prepared. That rifles like the AR-15 are especially lethal, he acknowledged, adds an additional mental obstacle for officers.\n\u201cAll we can do is play the averages \u2026 and hope that the training will take place and they\u2019ll be able to understand the gravity of the situation and respond accordingly,\u201d Perdue said. \u201cBut there is no guarantee that the one officer that happens to be on duty when this next shooting occurs is going to respond correctly.\u201d\nIn many cases, whether officers follow active-shooter training is irrelevant. Most mass shootings end in less than five minutes, research from the FBI concluded, often before officers arrive.\nThis was the case in Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed 26 people at an elementary school in 2012, and in Aurora, Colorado, where another killed 12 people at a movie theater the same year. Both used AR-15-style rifles.\nResistance to gun control\nTexas has a long, proud and increasingly less-regulated history of gun ownership. It is rooted in a belief in personal responsibility, that average citizens can sensibly own guns to protect themselves and their families and intervene to stop armed criminals in the absence of police.\n\u201cUltimately, as we all know, what stops armed bad guys is armed good guys,\u201d said U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz at the National Rifle Association convention in Houston three days after the Uvalde shooting.\nHe cited two examples: the Border Patrol team who finally breached the classroom at Robb Elementary and the firearms instructor who shot the gunman who in 2017 attacked a church in Sutherland Springs with an AR-15-style rifle. Both actions potentially saved lives. But they failed to prevent the murders of 47 people.\nThis year a group of Uvalde families has been regularly visiting the Capitol to push for stricter gun laws, including to raise the age someone can legally purchase AR-15-style rifles to 21.\nThe mass shootings since 2016 in Dallas, Sutherland Springs, Santa Fe, El Paso and Midland-Odessa \u2014 all but one committed with a semi-automatic rifle \u2014 did not persuade the Legislature to restrict access to guns. Instead, lawmakers relaxed regulations, including allowing the open carry of handguns without a license or training. And Democrats who have proposed a number of new restrictions this session admit that their bills face nearly insurmountable odds.\nThe AR-15s carried by state troopers at the Capitol give Sandra Torres flashbacks. Her daughter, 10-year-old Eliahna, a promising softball player, died at Robb Elementary. Sandra never got to tell her she\u2019d made the all-star team. Mack Segovia, Eliahna\u2019s stepfather, didn\u2019t grow up around guns, but he\u2019s seen enough pictures of 200-pound wild hogs his friends tore up with AR-15s while hunting to understand what the rifle did to his daughter.\nThe couple has made the six-hour round trip to Austin five times already, squeezing with other families into tiny offices for meetings with lawmakers to ask for what they think are commonsense regulations. Most legislators are cordial, but sometimes the families can tell they are being rebuffed, Torres said. Her partner recalled how the House speaker drove 360 miles from his home in Beaumont to Uvalde to tell families he did not support new gun laws, which struck him as a hell of a long way for a man to travel to say: Sorry, I can\u2019t help you.\nThe experience is frustrating. Torres and Segovia said they did not have a strong opinion about guns until their daughter was taken from them by a young man who bought one designed for combat, no questions asked. They said they feel compelled, if Eliahna\u2019s death served any purpose, to make it harder for other people to do the same.\n\u201cThose were babies,\u201d Segovia said. \u201cI promise you, if it happened to those people in the Senate, or the governor, it would be different.\u201d\nInformation about the authors\nLearn about The Texas Tribune\u2019s policies, including our partnership with The Trust Project to increase transparency in news."

  "argos_summary": "Newly released records from the Uvalde school district reveal significant safety concerns and details about the delayed police response during the 2022 Robb Elementary School shooting, where 19 children and two teachers were killed. The documents indicate that the shooter exhibited troubling behavior prior to the attack, while teachers expressed their trauma and fear during the incident. Investigations highlight failures in law enforcement coordination and training, with officers treating the situation as a barricaded subject rather than an active threat, resulting in a 77-minute delay before confronting the shooter. The report emphasizes the need for improved training and accountability among law enforcement agencies to prevent future tragedies.",
