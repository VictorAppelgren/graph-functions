      "feedback": "The draft does many things well (two Up and two Down lines tied to a coherent cloud/AI regime, plus a macro Outlook), but it needs sharper, rule‑driven craftsmanship to reach world‑class quality. Key issues to fix: tighten the four swing lines into strictly one‑sentence, executable drivers with explicit, numeric invalidation points; replace ambiguous language with measurable triggers (e.g., membership thresholds, revenue/margin milestones, regulatory/FDA steps, or macro rate signals) and peg every number to a source ID; ensure probabilities are grounded in explicit evidence (and correct any off‑by‑a‑mile figures, e.g., 38% → 39% to reflect Azure/AI growth); consolidate the evidence so lines cite the most critical IDs only and reconcile any conflicts (e.g., cloud capex momentum vs wage‑cost risk) rather than stacking disparate signals. Improve alignment with SECTION FOCUS by making the Up/Down lines clearly represent near‑term (0–6 weeks) and medium term (2–3 months / 4–6 months) drivers, with a concise note on the range of outcomes and exact invalidation criteria, and ensure the Outlook/Trade Plan conforms to the required format if an asset is tradable (or remains a pure Outlook if not). Specifically: replace the 0–6 weeks Up line with a crisp, one‑line driver such as “AI productivity uplift and Range adoption to 2,000 members; watch Range membership print 2,000 by week 6; invalidate if 2,000 is not reached and Range stalls below 1,500; 39%” with citations to the exact source IDs; tighten 2–3 months Up to reflect Pacaso’s 10 destinations, 21% YoY growth, and 40% consumer interest plus HeartSciences FDA/reg progress, watched as a cadence with explicit invalidation if any milestone lags (e.g., Pacaso delays past the quarter, FDA progress stalls); for the Down lines, frame explicit threats with thresholds (e.g., Pacaso expansion stalls or FDA setback beyond a defined date; Range adoption under a lower KPI; Japanese wage data accelerating inflation beyond a target) and include a clear invalidation point; for 4–6 months Down, tie to a concrete regime trigger (cloud CapEx deceleration below a defined rate and sustained wage-cost pressure) and a measurable counterfactual (e.g., CAPEX holds above 20% for two quarters). For the Outlook, compress to the required fields and ensure it’s a single or two lines, with a concrete path (21% cloud/AI CAGR to 2030 implied multiples) and explicit decision signals, invalidation, and trigger; if you intend a Swing Trade on tradable assets, present 1–2 precise lines (Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence %); otherwise deliver a succinct Outlook line with the same fields. As a concrete starter, consider these revised lines (numbers tied to IDs): Up | 0–6 weeks | AI productivity lift and Range to 2,000 members; watch Range membership hit 2,000 by week 6; invalidate if not reached and Range remains <1,500; 39% (UPV3X2MQ6)(0G3A676BP); Up | 2–3 months | Pacaso expands to 10 destinations; 21% YoY real estate growth; 40% Americans willing to buy vacation home; watch cadence to 10 destinations and regulatory friction; invalidate if cadence stalls for >1 quarter or FDA/HeartSciences progress stalls; 28% (ILYC1M41F)(UPV3X2MQ6)(FOM34PUWA); Down | 0–6 weeks | Pacaso/regulatory delays; Range adoption under 2k; Japanese wage prints risk inflation; watch for Pacaso regulatory cadence slipping and Range underperformance; invalidate if 2k not approached by week 6; 25% (ILYC1M41F)(UPV3X2MQ6)(A7VLN74BK)(FOM34PUWA); Down | 4–6 months | Regime risk from wage-cost pressure and cloud‑capex deceleration; watch CAPEX trajectory and wage trends; invalidate if cloud CapEx remains below ~20% for two consecutive quarters; 24% (0G3A676BP)(4LQD15CFU)(TN66GHPAT)(J99EM2TPZ). Outlook: Direction | Horizon | Expected path/levels | Decision signals | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence 0–100: Bullish | 6–12 months | Base-case cloud/AI regime sustains 21% CAGR with higher multiples; watch disinflation progress and AI CapEx momentum; invalidate on persistent inflation or wage shock; trigger: confirmatory earnings signals and policy cadence; 60% | 65%.",
