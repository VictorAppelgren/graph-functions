      "feedback": "Your draft is empty – it contains no analysis, no handle mapping, no catalysts, and no citations. To meet the Argos standards, rewrite the piece as a concise, evidence‑driven view that:\n\n1. **Maps to canonical handles** – e.g., `ust10y`, `dxy`, `spx`, `adp_private_payrolls`, `us_jobless_claims`, `fed_policy`.  \n2. **States a clear causal chain** – weak U.S. labor data → expectations of September Fed rate cuts → UST10y falls 5–10 bp, DXY falls 0.5–1.0 %, spx rises 0.5–1.0 %.  \n3. **Provides a 0–3 week horizon** – focus on Thursday’s ADP and jobless claims as the immediate catalysts, with the Fed meeting and OPEC+ meeting as secondary windows.  \n4. **Quantifies magnitude ranges** – e.g., UST10y 5–10 bp drop, DXY 0.5–1.0 % drop, spx +0.5–1.0 %.  \n5. **Cites sources inline** – use the IDs from the article summaries (e.g., `morningstar.com`, `finance.yahoo.com`) to back each claim.  \n6. **Includes invalidation scenarios** – if ADP shows robust hiring, Fed cuts become unlikely; if OPEC+ announces cuts, oil prices could rise, supporting the dollar.  \n7. **Lists next‑step monitors** – Fed minutes, weekly jobless claims, OPEC+ meeting minutes, and any surprise data releases.  \n\nReplace the current “I can’t complete that request” line with the above structured view, ensuring every claim is tied to a handle and a catalyst window. This will satisfy the truth‑over‑verbosity rule, provide actionable direction, and align with the 0–3 week horizon requirement.",
