  "description": "AMD Radeon RX 9070 review",
  "content": "The AMD Radeon RX 9070 offers commendable 4K performance for a mid-range GPU, and it even manages to outpace the RTX 5070 with ray tracing switched off. The story changes when DLSS 4 is enabled since Nvidia's card uses 4x Multi Frame Generation versus FSR 4's x2 equivalent, but it makes up for its AI shortcomings by allowing Fluid Motion Frames to be switched on across more games.\n\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+ Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.\n\nThe graphics card scene is obsessed with flagships, so I\u2019m delighted that the AMD Radeon RX 9070 has entered the battlefield before an RTX 5090 rival. Not only does it suggest that Team Red is prioritizing mainstream gaming PC builds, but it also puts pressure on Nvidia to put more love into its mid-range releases.\n\nAnd, for what it\u2019s worth, mid-range competition is fierce within the best graphics card ring. You\u2019ve got the AMD Radeon RX 9070 swinging big punches with its $549 / \u00a3529.99 MSRP, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 matching those blows with the same price tag, and beefier Radeon RX 9070 XT models for just $50 more, making jabs at the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti.\n\nThe vanilla Radeon RX 9070 does have a bit of an issue on its hands, though, and it ties back to both its XT counterpart and RTX 5070 rival. While its price point is pretty much where it needs to be, it does risk being overshadowed in terms of performance per dollar and AI upscaling abilities. The latter isn\u2019t remotely clear-cut, and the idea of \u201cartificially\u201d boosting fps via Frame Generation is nuanced, but it still may lead players to pick up another GPU.\n\nArmed with an Navi 48 XT GPU, the RX 9070 effectively kick-started AMD's RDNA 3 line-up. The card is positioned as the company's \"affordable\" mid-range GPU, but its only current siblings are the slightly beefier RX 9070 XT and entry-level RX 9060 models.\n\nEffectively, there is no AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX successor on the market right now, and the RX 9070 isn't quite on par with the Radeon RX 7900 XT. The new contender wields 16GB GDDR6 VRAM, which is 4GB less than the last-gen flagship, and it's rocking 3,584 shading units versus 5,376. Its RT core count is lower too (84 vs 56), so I'd be hesitant to recommend this card as a newer alternative.\n\nThat shouldn't really come as a surprise, given its real predecessor is technically the Radeon RX 7700 XT, and its specs are pretty similar on paper:\n\nThat said, it is packing enough heat to take on the RTX 5070 and brings the fight to Nvidia's mid-ranger. The fact that it's got more VRAM helps it appear better value from the get-go, even though it is using slower GDDR6 memory rather than GDDR7.\n\nOf course, we are also talking about a new generation of GPUs, and Navi 4 chips can tap into improved AI upscaling features like AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 4. I'd say that's the main draw with the RX 9070 compared to AMD's last-gen lineup, and it will help fill in a few performance gaps.\n\nI\u2019m perhaps more into graphics card designs than I should be, so I was keen to see what the RX 9070 brings to the form-factor table. Sadly, there\u2019s no in-house AMD version of the GPU, so your mileage is going to vary depending on your choice of AIB brand. I\u2019m specifically testing the Asus Prime version of the graphics card that looks nearly identical to the company\u2019s RTX 5070.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for brands to use the same shroud designs for both Nvidia and AMD cards. That said, it does mean that, regardless of the GPU inside, you\u2019re getting the same tri-fan cooling setup, curvy body, and subtle black matte finish with \u201cPRIME\u201d engraved on top. At a glance, the only notable variance is the white printed Radeon text that sits in place of the GeForce logo on the Nvidia model, but you can still play a game of spot the difference.\n\nNotably, the RX 9070 uses two 8-pin power connectors rather than a 12VHPWR dongle used by Nvidia. Sticking with the old socket is something AMD doubled down on last generation, and it seems like the company is maintaining a \u201cnot broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d approach for now. The choice is certainly going to simplify cable management and result in less disruption to your existing case wiring, although the layout is just as visually ugly as the green team\u2019s approach.\n\nIdeally, I would have loved to see an RX 9070 reference design that takes on the slick approach to the RTX 5070 Founder\u2019s Edition. Most AIB models are much chonkier than Nvidia\u2019s FE model, and while that\u2019s not going to matter to those of you with the case space, it\u2019d still help the AMD card squeeze into smaller spaces. Plus, it\u2019s just nice to see options across the board get smaller after the absurd sizes featured last generation (looking at you, RTX 4090).\n\nAMD Adrenaline is the beating heart of the RX 9070\u2019s feature set, providing the GPU with various software tricks that benefit performance, power management, and various other perks. The suite is your key to tapping into the GPU\u2019s new FSR 4 and Frame Generation abilities, including the ability to enable the latter on a driver level.\n\nRather than simply mimicking Nvidia\u2019s DLSS 4 and Multi-Frame Generation, FSR 4 puts on its own show. The idea is similar, but the implementation differs both functionally and philosophically. By that, I mean that AMD is focusing on providing standard MFG rather than shooting for the stars with 4x boosts, something the company says will help provide a better balance between performance and fidelity.\n\nAt the same time, Adrenaline also lets players enable \u201cFluid Motion Frames\u201d in games without FSR 4 baked in. Using the driver-level option effectively gives you a lifeline if frame rates are struggling to reach a sweet spot, but latency will vary depending on what you\u2019re trying to run. As a rule of thumb, I keep it off when responsiveness is pivotal, whereas it comes in clutch for demanding RTS games and casual adventures.\n\nFluid Motion Frames is just one of many options tied in with Adrenaline\u2019s \u201cGame Experience\u201d presets, which include HYPR-RX and Eco modes. These profiles effectively let you switch on features like Radeon Super Resolution, Anti-Lag, and Radeon Chill for specific games, allowing you to sway between full throttle performance and better efficiency. The layout isn\u2019t worlds apart from what\u2019s offered in the Nvidia app, but it does provide up-front data on average frame rates and performance grades based on your recent sessions.\n\nIf you\u2019d rather not have an external app messing with your settings, you can tell Adrenaline to stick with default options. I have noticed that both AMD and Nvidia\u2019s software likes to jump the gun on occasion and apply what it thinks are the ideal presets, and there are instances where you\u2019ll want to quash those suggestions. The idea behind the automation is that you\u2019ll be provided with optimal performance without having to mess with dials, sort of like a console, but as a PC player, I don\u2019t always vibe with having less involvement.\n\nI know for a fact that many of you will scroll straight to the frame rates whenever you see a graphics card review. I mean, that\u2019s exactly why I\u2019ve been sitting benchmarking the RX 9070 across various games and comparing the results to the RTX 5070 and various other cards, and while sometimes that means looking at pretty similar figures, this Radeon GPU has caught me pleasantly off guard.\n\nJust like most new graphics cards, there are two sides to the performance coin. The \"heads\" side in this instance represents native rasterized frame rates, while \"tails\" is the results after Frame Generation and AI upscaling are applied. Both are important in different ways, but I know many of you will consider the former to be a true merit measurement.\n\nOff the bat, the RX 9070 hits higher average frame rates than the RTX 5070 at 4K with ray tracing off. This first became clear when prowling the streets of Night City, as Cyberpunk 2077 runs at around 55fps versus 48fps. That edge will give players something to work with when trying to boost fps on a mid-range PC without any AI assistance, and even temporal upscaling will easily inch things to a 60fps sweet spot.\n\nThe trend continues throughout the likes of Hitman 3, which hits way higher than I was expecting at 130fps versus 114fps, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard manages to venture over 60fps, unlike the RTX 5070. But once you apply ray tracing, Nvidia\u2019s contender starts to regain ground by hitting higher averages.\n\nThe gap isn\u2019t always massive, and the 5070 manages the same 21fps average in Cyberpunk as the RX 9070. Still, it\u2019s clear that when it comes to ray tracing, Nvidia still has an edge, in turn giving its card a higher figure to multiply using Multi-Frame Generation. In fact, if you crank the AI upscaling tool to its max capabilities (x4), you end up with absurdly higher frame rates.\n\nFor instance, the RTX 5070 can churn out a monstrous 215fps average in Cyberpunk 2077, whereas the RX 9070 taps out at 92fps with x2 Frame Generation enabled. Naturally, this is because AMD\u2019s card is duplicating rasterized frames, while the GeForce card is generating three frames. To pull that off without any latency issues or lag, additional tools like Nvidia Reflex are working away in the background, but Team Red seems to believe trying to fill in the gaps to that extent is detrimental to the overall experience.\n\nI\u2019m certainly not here to fuel the \u201cfake frames\u201d debate going on within the GPU scene right now, but some PC enthusiasts value rasterized \u201cnative\u201d results over anything assisted by AI. I have my own personal reasons for not being a fan of anything related to artificial intelligence, but when you get down to brass tacks, every current-gen graphics card is leveraging upscaling tech to improve performance.\n\nAMD does take a slightly different approach, though, and in some ways, the RX 9070 does more to assist performance across the board. That\u2019s largely because you can enable Fluid Motion Frames at a driver level in most games, which will provide them with higher frame rates. This is something that was introduced with Radeon RX 7000 GPUs, and it can make a big difference in the right situation.\n\nLet\u2019s use Total War: Warhammer 3 as an example, an RTS game that I routinely use for benchmarking. Base performance clocks in at around 68fps, which sits nicely about the RTX 5070\u2019s 58fps result. The game lacks any sort of AI upscaling options, so DLSS can\u2019t help the GeForce card out this time around, but switching Fluid Motion Frames on drives average frame rates up to a nifty 140fps.\n\nSega\u2019s RTS romp is a pretty good example of a game that benefits from drive-level Frame Generation with minimal caveats. Again, you can switch this option on across your Steam library, but it is worth considering the latency implications before you get carried away. Yes, you\u2019ll have a Radeon equivalent to Nvidia Reflex to hand, AMD Anti-Lag, but if I\u2019m being honest, your mileage will vary depending on how low a frame rate you\u2019re trying to boost, as well as other underlying factors, and I\u2019d just avoid it when playing anything competitive.\n\nMoving on to temps, the Asus Prime performs pretty similarly to the RTX 5070 version. The GPU rarely reached above 70\u00b0C, and even then, it only managed to touch 72\u00b0C once. More often than not, I find that both reference and custom coolers more than have thermals under control, which means you\u2019ll have one less thing to worry about when building or upgrading your rig. That said, I\u2019m using a fairly large test case, so you could end up with toastier results depending on your build.\n\nShould you buy the AMD Radeon RX 9070?\n\nIf you can grab one for under $450, the AMD Radeon RX 9070 will furnish your rig with great 4K frame rates, 16GB VRAM, and decent AI upscaling tricks. Ultimately, it still falls short compared to the RTX 5070 when it comes to ray tracing and top-line Multi Frame Generation enhanced performance, but the GPU does outpace the GeForce card on the native track.\n\nThe RX 9070 is also a strong option for players looking to give more games an AI upscaling boost, too. Having the option to enable Fluid Motion Frames at a driver level can make a difference in games less reliant on low latency, and it will help those of you with high-performance backlog ambitions.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about the RX 9070, whether you\u2019re into the idea of AI-enhanced PC graphics or not. While the gap between Multi Frame Generation and AMD\u2019s equivalent is significant, it\u2019s perhaps not a deal breaker if you aren\u2019t trying to satiate a high refresh rate gaming monitor, and the extra flexibility of Fluid Motion Frames could end up being a winning tradeoff.\n\nFor two weeks, I used the AMD Radeon RX 9070 within my main gaming PC. During that time, I benchmarked the GPU using a set list of test games at 4K and 1440p with ray tracing on and off, including Cyberpunk 2077, Hitman 3, Total War: Warhammer 3, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider.\n\nThroughout testing, I collected average frame rate data for each benchmark game and monitored peak temperatures. In compatible games, I also enabled AI upscaling tools like AMD FSR and Fluid Motion Frames to compare the results to native abilities, specifically focusing on average fps changes, visual quality, and latency.\n\nFor more information on how we test graphics cards and other PC components, check out our full GamesRadar+ Hardware Policy.\n\nBuilding a PC from scratch?

      "text": "The best RAM for gaming 2025: Blazing-fast speeds for your PC\nIt's time to upgrade to DDR5. Here's the best RAM for gaming that isn't going to break the bank.\nThe best RAM for gaming often flies under the radar, but you can't count out this extremely important PC component when building your dream gaming rig. RAM supports your CPU and GPU in really important ways, so it's important to get short-term memory for your computer that's going to do the job you need. That said, it's easy to overcomplicate things and overspend on RAM, and I'm here to help make your search a bit easier.\nBut how much RAM do you actually need? And what speed is best for you and your rig? Well, if you're trying to build one of the best gaming PCs possible, you'll want no less than 16GB - and ideally in dual channel form as this is more efficient. Whether you go for two 8GB sticks or one 16GB stick, you won't want less than that. In terms of speed, we'd say the sweet spot to aim for is around the 3,500MHz mark for DDR4. If one thing's for sure in 2025, it's definitely time to upgrade to DDR5 if you're thinking of spending any money on RAM. Yes, it may mean a new motherboard, CPU, or system altogether, but with DDR5 getting more affordable and CPU makers cutting off compatibility, it's really time to think about making the move.\nOur best advice, whether you go for an AMD or Intel build in 2025, is to keep the RAM sticks consistent. Mixing and matching models can sometimes function, but you're going to be limited to the lowest speed of the two. Most of the time, though, even if you buy two sticks of the same RAM from the same manufacturer, they won't play ball with one another if they have different speeds and timings written on their boxes. Even if the frequencies match, you could be losing out on features between brands without knowing it. Luckily, XMP and AMD EXPO settings make getting the most out of your DDR5 an easy task these days.\nThe quick list\nBest DDR5 overall\nWhen you sum up the value of price, speed, looks, performance, and compatibility, Klevv's Cras XR5 RGB DDR5 RAM has it all.\nBest budget DDR5\nT-Force's RAM can often be found in the discount aisles during big sales events, and after testing it, we think it's pretty good value for money.\nBest no-nonsense DDR5\nCrucial's DDR5 Pro RAM takes a less-is-more approach, so if you aren't worried about overclocking or RGB lighting, this is what you want.\nBest budget\nIt really isn't the last word in performance, but if you're looking for 16GB of trustworthy DDR4, Corsair's reliable Vengeance LPX kit has you covered.\nSturdiest DDR5\nThe last thing you want when you've bought shiny next-gen RAM is for it to break during installation. This is PNY's sturdiest solution.\nBest looking DDR5\nXPG isn't a slouch when it comes to performance, but its true strengths lie in the looks department. Its RGB array is second to none.\nBest DDR5 for overclocking\nSabrent's Rocket DDR5 is quite amazing. The 4800MHz variant we tested is capable of sitting well above 5000MHz, and it's eerily efficient all the while.\nFastest DDR4\nCrucial's Ballistix RAM can be a bit pricey to find these days, but if you want the fastest DDR4 short of upgrading to next-gen, that'll help you out.\nBest Corsair DDR5\nCorsair's RAM might be one of the more expensive options, but its brand's reputation speaks for it. It also has a wide variety of speeds to choose from.\nRAM is often thought of as the most boring computer component, but I disagree. I think the memory you choose for your PC can make a huge difference to how it performs, and it's underrated when it comes to helping the latest processors keep up to their advertised speeds. I've been testing RAM for two years now, and I'm always happy when I can engage someone on why the jump to DDR5 is, in fact, worth it.\nThe best DDR5 RAM for gaming overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nKlevv is a brand that's headed up by Essencore, a tech company from Hong Kong that personifies the amazing technology markets in that part of the world. They take what's great about bigger-name brands, make it cheaper, but ensure that reliability and power are still there in abundance. That is very much the cloth from which Klevv's Cras XR5 RB DDR5 RAM is cut.\nIn terms of value for money, I'd say Klevv's Cras kit is hard to beat in the DDR5 arena. I haven't seen speeds upwards of 6000MHz for as cheap as this before, and when you throw in the beautiful aesthetics of these sticks, it's such a strong option. The RGB light array on the top of these sticks is absolutely stunning when installed. Colors blend and flow into one another, and the best part is they're controllable through Asus Aura Sync, Gigabyte RGB Fusion, MSI Mystic Light, ASRock Polychrome Sync, and even Razer Chroma.\nWe tested two 16GB sticks with 6,000MHz on the box, but Klevv also sells kits capable of running 6,200MHz if you want to pay a little more. Overall, there's futureproofing, style, and great performance to be had with Klevv's DDR5 RAM, and it's an easy recommendation from me.\nThe best budget DDR5\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTeamgroup's T-Force RAM can often be seen in the discount aisles of online retailers when big sales events are running. Often, it can be found on offer outside of those sales like Black Friday and Prime Day, meaning it's competitively priced the majority of the time. That isn't indicative of its quality though, because T-Force Delta RGB DDR5 looks as good, and performs as well as the rivals you'll find up and down this list.\nIts voltages and timings were very consistent with more expensive DDR5 from bigger brands, so if you buy this for cheaper, you're getting more than your money's worth. It's XMP and EXPO ready out of the box, so it'll suit a wide range of PC builds. It also has all the design and architectural qualities the best DDR5 does, including PMIC colling, and ECC - the latter of which is missing from some more expensive models.\nAesthetically, you get a solid RGB array on top of these modules. They aren't quite as bright as XPG's, and their colors aren't as alluring as Klevv's, but for the money you pay, they do the trick. They have support for ASRock, Asus, Biostar, Gigabyte, and MSI motherboard software too.\nPerformance-wise, there wasn't much to separate this DDR5 from others. It performed just as well as the other memory kits we've tested. Its availability in a slew of capacities and speeds, however, does tell us that this isn't designed for overclocking to the maximum. Other than that, it's hard to fault this RAM, really. If you find this cheaper than other brands, don't hesitate, this will carry you through the DDR5 generation with ease.\nThe best no-fuss DDR5 RAM\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nCrucial's DDR5 Pro RAM seems like the exact type of DDR5 your grumpy uncle would upgrade to. It cuts the fat of gaming-centric RAM, forgoes overclocking, and focuses on offering a simple plug-and-play experience. For first-time upgraders or people who aren't all that confident playing around with BIOS settings, this is an easy fix.\nCrucial's design and feature choices here leave a lot to be desired, but luckily there are 2 XMP profiles and 1 AMD EXPO profile on board. Besides that, these modules make use of Micron's home-baked architecture and an aluminium heat spreader.\nWhen it comes to performance, we found admirable gaming results despite the 5200MT/s sticks being unable to boost to speeds over 5000MHz. For the majority of DDR% we test, we tend to benchmark up at 6000MHz, so this was a tad disappointing. Without any overclocking capability, this is the kind of RAM we'd recommend as a perfect match for Intel Core i5 / Ryzen 5 CPUs, even if those processors are capable of higher speeds at a push.\nFor no-frills, no-nonsense DDR5 RAM that doesn't need to be the fastest, Crucial has a solid contender here. On the other hand, if you want more than what's advertised, any other DDR5 will probably serve you better since these modules really don't go above and beyond.\nThe best budget DDR4 RAM\n4. Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDDR4 RAM from the biggest names in digital storage is actually getting a little harder to find as they ramp up production of DDR5 RAM. Because of that, sometimes replacing your PC's memory with DDR4 can actually be more expensive, if not just as pricey as buying newer DDR5. Luckily, Corsair's Vengeance LPX is a holdout, and you can still find it fairly easily at pretty reasonable prices.\nAs always with DDR4, you aren't going to get the best performance out there, but at least here you get Corsair's reliability and a few color options. The pure aluminium heat spreader here will ensure cool operation, and voltages are seemingly pretty low, all told. You even have some overclocking capabilities here with the 3200MHz version having XMP 2.0 compatibility.\nThe sturdiest DDR5 RAM\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nPNY's XLR8 gaming brand has become synonymous with quality, and that's exactly what I've found with its MAKO DDR5 RAM modules. As DDR5 continues to push its way into the mainstream, PNY has re-established itself as a top contender in the memory market here.\nPNY XLR8 MAKO DDR5 RAM comes in 16GB and 32GB capacities and is available at both 6000MHz and 6200MHz speeds. For those wanting as much RGB crammed into their PC case as possible, PNY also makes an RGB version. We tested two non-RGB 16GB 6000MHz sticks for our review, and besides this kit's high price, it was an easy recommendation that's what our testing rig is currently rocking.\nIf you have a DDR5-compatible motherboard and a CPU that will allow you to get the most out of this RAM kit, then it's a solid option. If you have an aging processor, this is still an easy recommendation. Our 12-Gen i7 managed to ramp the XLR8 DDR5 up to 5000MHz, for example. Just keep in mind that until you upgrade to a more efficient CPU you'll probably not get the quoted speeds on the box. Regardless, PNY's XLR8 DDR5 is a safe option with design choices that deserve a lot of praise.\nThe best looking DDR5\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLet's face it, when it comes to DDR5, you're going to get great performance no matter which stick on this list you choose. Sometimes, the best RAM for you is going to be the one that makes the rest of your PC sing, and XPG's Lancer RGB DDR5 certainly does that. The RGB array on the top of this RAM module shines even brighter than Klevv's, and looks just as pretty. We're awarding XPG's kit with the award of best looking RGB RAM, but it's no slouch in the performance race either.\nSlightly confusingly, XPG (which is a brand owned by ADATA), uses MT/s to market this RAM, as opposed to MHz. While these are similar metrics, they aren't a direct equivalent, so keep that in mind when choosing which speed you want to go for. We tested the 7200MT/s module, which equated to around 5200MHz, although we benchmarked it up at 6000MHz without any problems at all. While it wasn't quite as stable as Klevv's Cras kit, or indeed a few others we've reviewed recently, it does unlock some great performance when overclocked. Annoyingly, that stability also translates to voltages, as we found some of the highest readings of any DDR5 module we've tested in this XPG RAM.\nBesides these few nit-picks, it's undeniable that XPG's Lancer RGB RAM looks a million dollars. It's also very versatile in the looks department, and is able to work with ASUS Aura Sync, Gigabyte RGB Fusion, MSI Mystic Light Sync, and AS Rock's Polychrome equivalent. Finally, it's available in both black and white,\nThe best DDR5 for overclocking\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSabrent's Rocket DDR5 punches three weight classes above what its minimalist design would suggest. It comes in either 16 or 32GB sticks and although it's quoted at 4800MHz out of the box, Sabrent has designed it to withstand up to four times the module capacity. For our review, we pushed it into the 5000MHz range, but we wouldn't be surprised at all if it could keep up with the Corsair Dominator Platinum's speeds. What we have here, then, is a DDR5 module that's priced along with the cheaper DDR5 kits on the market, but can absolutely perform with the top dogs thanks to its XMP capabilities.\nAs you'll see from the images, Sabrent's bit of rocket science is extremely thin, too. It has an ingenious cooling solution in the form of a copper heat spreader that keeps circuitry efficient. At the same time, it's slight form factor makes it feel a tad fragile, so definitely handle it with care. Sabrent's Rocket DDR5 sticks come in 16 or 32GB, and come in smaller form factors so you can use them in a gaming laptop as well.\nThe best DDR4 for pure speed\n8. Crucial Ballistix MAX RGB\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWe'll be real with you - only consider RAM that's this fast if your intention is to overclock the absolute hell out of your DDR4 machine. At the same time, in order to take advantage of these insane speeds, you will also need a top-of-the-line motherboard that can handle that kind of pressure.\nIf you've got the rig for it - and you're brave enough - there's little question that a 4400MHz dual-channel set will tick over flawlessly for years. But, when discussing gaming specifically, you can expect only a minor framerate boost depending on the game (usually in the ballpark of 5-10 extra FPS). Indeed, it's less about the gaming prowess of a set like this and more so what they can do for the everyday operation of your rig.\nThe best Corsair RAM\n9. Corsair Dominator Platinum RGB DDR5-5200\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you're after high-end gaming RAM performance for your Intel 12th gen-enabled rig then the Corsair Dominator Platinum RGB DDR5-5200 offers all the performance speed that you need. With the potential of PCIe 5.0 just now being understood and unlocked by the newest Intel CPUs, you'll be in a very good place for the future of PC gaming as an early adopter in 2022 with this memory kit configuration.\nUnsurprisingly, a DDR5 memory solution is going to cost you a fair amount to invest in early at this current point in time, and the Corsair Dominator Platinum RGB DDR5-5200 is no different. While you're paying a bit of a premium already for the aesthetics and build quality, higher configuration RAM like this clock speed certainly doesn't come cheap.\nBest RAM for gaming - Frequently asked questions\nWhat is XMP?\nIf you're asking yourself \"What is XMP and how do you enable it\", you'll be glad to know it isn't as complicated as it seems. It stands for (E)Xtreme Memory Profile - and it's Intel's way of allowing DDR5 purchasers to get the most out of their memory sticks. Although EXPO is AMD's equivalent, XMP has very much become the blanket term. These profiles usually come aboard your DDR5 memory out of the box, and they essentially allow you to overclock your RAM to get the blazing fast speeds that DDR5 is capable of. Don't fret though, it isn't really overclocking in risky terms, it's only dubbed this because it's faster than most gaming PCs can handle if you aren't running the latest components.\nDo games run better with 16GB RAM?\nAs games continue to get more technologically demanding, we generally recommend a minimum of 16GB of DDR4, and you'll find that more and more minimum requirement spec lists will agree with that recommendation. Even at the DDR5 level, we wouldn't recommend less than 16GB - and you should always aim for dual-channel memory - so 2x8GB sticks, rather than one stick of 16GB.\nCan faster RAM give me higher framerates?\nThis is a much-debated topic within the PC building community online. For the most part, people will tell you that RAM does not have a bearing on FPS in your favorite games, because for the longest time, this has been true. Frame rates are really handled by the GPU and in-part by the CPU, so if anything RAM would really only have a bearing on loadtimes and general PC productivity. However, with DDR5 RAM testing, we, along with quite a few other outlets, have been finding that RAM does impact FPS now because it takes strain off other components and helps your rig run more efficiently. It cen certainly determine whether your frame rate will be stable or fluctuate more, but your mileage may vary depending on the parts you use.\nIs 32GB of RAM overkill?\nDepending on your rig, and the games you like to play, 32GB may be more RAM than you need. For the majority of people, 16GB of DDR5 will be more than enough to be getting along with. However, we are seeing more contemporary games benefit from 32GB, and content creation tasks, especially in 4K, can benefit from the extra headroom. If you'd like to futureproof as much as possible, or you run hardware intensive tasks and games all the time, it might not be overkill for you. Arguably, unless you're doing intense content creation and you keep about 90 tabs open while you play VR games, 64GB of DDR5 would probably be overkill.\nWhat type of RAM is the best for gaming?\nIn short, 32GB of DDR5 RAM will give your system substantial overhead for both gaming and non-gaming tasks, such as anything to with hardware rendering (like video production or 3D modelling). While few, if any, games require such an amount of memory as a prerequisite, 32GB RAM will effectively futureproof your machine, especially if you opt for DDR5. This would keep your system technologically relevant for at least the next five years, if the long reign of DDR4 has taught us anything since its widespread adoption.\nCan I mix different gaming RAM brands?\nWhile the answer to this question is technically yes, we would encourage you to keep your RAM sticks consistent in your build. This is because mixing RAM kits, even though they may be technically clocked to the same speed (such as 3200 MHz, etc.) can lead to slower performance. I tried using two sets of 2x16GB DDR5 RAM from the same manufacturer and that didn't work because they were slightly different clock speeds. So if you want to add more RAM to your PC, make sure it's more of the exact same speed and type of memory, otherwise you'll run into issues. After all, specs will differ between different RAM models and manufacturers even within the same family line.\nWhat is CUDIMM RAM and is it worth it?\nCUDIMM RAM is designed to be faster than regular DDR5 memory. Its name is short for Clocked Unbuffered Dual In-line Memory Module, and it essentially adds more stability at higher speeds. It uses a clock driver to increase that stability, and although it's a new classification of memory, it's sticks are compatible with regular DDR5 motherboards. That said, you'll need a very speedy processor and a motherboard that's up to the highest of speeds to make the most of it.\nThey're a great way to ensure your DDR5 RAM operates as reliably as possible, but they're still fairly new at the moment and therefore cost more. If you're not operating your RAM at over 6,400MHz, you're likely not going to really need this fancy new type of RAM module.\nGet the most out of your gaming setup with the best gaming monitors and best gaming chairs available right now.

Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I\u2019ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension.\n- Jasmine MannanHardware Editor"

      "text": "GamesRadar+ Verdict\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 packs an excellent 4K GPU punch for under $600, but it absolutely needs DLSS 4 to live up to its RTX 4090 performance promises. If you\u2019re happy using AI upscaling to boost fps, this new 70-class model could be the mid-range champion you\u2019ve been waiting for. However, those of you who are focussed on playing natively at UHD resolutions will ultimately need to spend more this generation.\nPros\n- +\nCan boost fps further than RTX 4090 using Multi-Frame Generation\n- +\nSlick Founders Edition design\n- +\nCustom Asus model provides excellent extra cooling\n- +\nApproachable MSRP\nCons\n- -\nSticks with 12GB VRAM\n- -\nRelies heavily on DLSS for 4K gameplay\n- -\nCustom pricing could be a deal breaker\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 doesn\u2019t truly pack RTX 4090 performance, at least not without AI shenanigans. Does that stop the GPU from potentially being a mid-range champion this generation? Absolutely not, but it heavily relies on DLSS and Multi-Frame Generation to get anywhere near close to last-gen flagship frame rates, and that might not be every player\u2019s bag.\nRather than being a RTX 4090 rival, the GeForce RTX 5070 will furnish your eyeballs with approachable mid-range visuals for $549 / \u00a3539. At least, it should do if you can find any RTX 5070 stock at MSRP, and if the rest of Nvidia\u2019s best graphics card contenders this generation are anything to go by, that could be painful. The moment you step into the wasteland of inflated AIB partner pricing, the UHD door practically slams shut on most mid-range player faces, including mine.\nIf the majority of RTX 5070 options can stay under $600, I\u2019m confident that it\u2019ll serve as the graphics card most players should pick up for solid mid-range performance. Whether it\u2019ll actually get to sit pretty on that particular throne really hinges on whether AMD ends up providing more reasons for middle ground players to buy an RX 9070 series instead. I\u2019ll happily watch both scrap it out if it means 4K gaming is technically getting cheaper, and I\u2019d say things are starting to look up for the mid-range scene.\nSpecs\nKitted out with a Blackwell GB205 GPU, and 12GB VRAM, the RTX 5070 isn't drastically different to the RTX 4070 Super. In fact, more of the improvements come in the form of faster GDDR7 memory modules, next-gen cores, and faster boost clock speeds. On paper, the card's core count is actually lower, but that's largely the result of optimized architecture rather than reduced specs.\nModel | RTX 5070 Founders Edition | Asus RTX 5070 Prime OC | RTX 4070 Super |\n|---|---|---|---|\nPrice (MSRP) | $549 / \u00a3539 | $549 / \u00a3539 | $599 / \u00a3579 |\nGPU | GB205 | GB205 | AD104 |\nCUDA cores | 6,144 | 6,144 | 7,168 |\nTensor cores | 192 | 192 | 224 |\nRT cores | 48 | 48 | 56 |\nBase clock | 2,325 MHz | 2,325 MHz | 1,980 MHz |\nBoost clock | 2,512 MHz | 2,512 MHz | 2,475 MHz |\nVRAM | 12GB GDDR7 | 12GB GDDR7 | 12GB GDDR6X |\nMemory bus | 192-bit | 192-bit | 192-bit |\nTDP | 250W | 250W | 285W |\nCustom cards like the Asus RTX 5070 Prime OC boast faster clock speeds, so that's worth keeping note of if you're not gunning for a Founders Edition. Nvidia's FE models are usually the first to sell out, and since there will be factory overclocked cards theoretically available at MSRP, you'll at least end up with something a little faster and with the cooling setup to pull off further overclocking.\nIn short, the RTX 5070 is pretty distant from its beefier Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti in terms of specs. In truth, that GPU feels closer to a GeForce RTX 5080 variant, and the 70-class model is firmly a mid-range graphics card. It is a pity that the card is rocking 12GB VRAM rather than 16GB again this generation, and while the extra memory might not be required with DLSS on, it would help futureproof the card.\nDesign\nFor what feels like years now, I\u2019ve been asking myself why GPUs need to be almost the size of a phat PS2. I get that the new age of UHD gaming requires chonky coolers to keep temperatures at acceptable levels, but I\u2019ve still been longing for a new card that\u2019s around the same size as my trusty old GTX 970.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nWell, we\u2019re finally getting that kind of design back with the GeForce RTX 5070. I\u2019ve been testing two models \u2013 Nvidia\u2019s Founder\u2019s Edition and the Asus Prime OC, and the latter is kitted out with a smaller two-slot shroud that effectively follows the same blueprint as the GeForce RTX 5080. Its sleek, two-tone grey body isn\u2019t going to remotely dominate your PC case, and I can see this card making its way into plenty of small form-factor builds over the next two years.\nJust like with the RTX 5080, the new RTX 5070 FE design is possible due to Nvidia\u2019s new split PCB approach that allows for more efficient airflow and heatsink placement. The brand has used this to pack a dual-fan solution, large fins on top, and ventilation around back. You won\u2019t have to worry too much about thermal caveats, but if Founders Edition cards sell out instantly, you\u2019ll end up with a custom option at (hopefully) MSRP anyway.\nOn that note, the Asus RTX 5070 Prime OC isn\u2019t quite on the same page as the Founder\u2019s Edition, as it sticks with a familiar tri-fan setup that prioritizes cooling. Custom 70-class designs, thankfully, aren\u2019t as absurd as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti since that card uses the same shroud as many RTX 4090 models. Plus, Asus\u2019 take is one of the nicer AIB designs out there, as its curves and subtle black body help prevent the card from looking too industrial.\nIf you\u2019re waiting to hear if the RTX 5070 ditches Nvidia\u2019s new 12-pin power connector, I\u2019ve got bad news. You\u2019ll still have to use the dreaded dongle to hook the GPU up to your PSU, but it at least scales things back to two 8-pin connections, which should create less cable bulk inside your case. The Founders Edition also uses an angled socket to steer wires out the way, but the Asus Prime OC does still have everything firing outwards. Again, it\u2019d be nice to see custom brands embrace some of this generation\u2019s more helpful design queues, but that\u2019ll perhaps come with time.\nFeatures\nDLSS 4 pretty much sits at the core of the entire RTX 50-series range, but the feature arguably does its heaviest lifting in the mid-range ring. In case it wasn\u2019t already obvious, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 embodies the idea of using tools like Super Sampling and Multi-Frame Generation by default, and it\u2019s the reason why Nvidia felt it could get up on stage at CES and say the card packs \u201cRTX 4090 performance\u201d.\nDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be getting to that bold claim, but I\u2019ll outline exactly what DLSS 4 as a package is first. In a nutshell, it\u2019s effectively Nvidia\u2019s umbrella term for its suite of AI upscaling tools for GeForce GPUs. If you\u2019ve already got an RTX 20-series card, you\u2019ll likely have come across Super Sampling, a setting that dynamically scales resolutions to boost fps. RTX 4000 users can also tap into Frame Generation abilities that, in simple terms, fill in frame rate gaps using AI, with the end goal being faster visuals without a noticeable loss in quality.\nWith every generation, Nvidia seemingly builds upon DLSS with a new series-exclusive feature. I\u2019m not remotely a fan of locking software features to newer generations, but in the case of the RTX 50-series, you\u2019re getting enhanced \u201cMulti-Frame Generation\u201d abilities that can make three frames for every single rendered image. Switching the option on means you\u2019re theoretically boosting fps by 4x, and that ultimately helps the RTX 5070 outpace even RTX 4090 in terms of AI-enhanced performance.\nSuper Sampling and Frame Generation is anything but infallible, and both can produce artifacting, latency issues, and other visual hiccups in specific scenarios. Nvidia clearly spends a lot of time looking at its formula in an attempt to kick these quirks to the curb, and DLSS 4 makes headway by adopting a new \u201cTransformer\u201d AI model and additional features like Ray Reconstruction for enhanced ray tracing. The result is instant enhancements in compatible games that are going from strength to strength, and that\u2019s going to help PC builds hopefully resist the generational winds for longer than just a few years.\nI get it \u2013 the idea of AI creeping into PC gaming more than gives me the ick too. However, DLSS as a toolkit did emerge before ChatGPT and the likes sank their claws into global life. Helping lighten the load for GPUs like the RTX 5070 is beneficial, especially since system requirements keep getting more outrageous by the second, but I get why some are trying to stick to native settings where possible. I don\u2019t completely subscribe to the \u201cfake frames\u201d argument making the rounds since I don\u2019t think the situation is as clear cut, but I will be keeping a close eye out for caveats tied to the tech as more games with support roll out.\nThe other main draw of buying cards like the RTX 5070 in 2025 is the Nvidia App. The green team\u2019s new hub has effectively replaced the old GeForce Experience software included with previous generations, and it focuses more on quick optimization and providing easier access to settings buried in the Control Panel. There\u2019s even voltage, power, and temperature sliders to play with in there too, but if you\u2019re using a card like the Asus Prime OC, you\u2019ll want to go with the brand\u2019s own GPU Tweak III software for proper overclocking.\nPerformance\nThe RTX 5070 has a lot on its shoulders thanks to Nvidia. Claims that the $549 GPU can provide the same performance as a $1,500 flagship raised my eyebrows into outer space during CES, and I immediately assumed the involvement of AI was a given. I\u2019m pretty sure the green team is going to receive a bit of backlash post launch, but now that I\u2019ve benchmarked the card, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019ll live up to many players\u2019 mid-range expectations.\nLet\u2019s start by taking a look at comparative RTX 4090 performance. Across my test suite of games, the RTX 5070 naturally fell short on the native track. In Cyberpunk 2077, you\u2019re looking at an average of 48fps using the ultra preset at 4K, whereas the Lovelace flagship can easily hit around 76fps. We\u2019re talking about a card with a 250W TDP and a much lower core count versus a 450W monster, so forgive me if I\u2019m not remotely surprised.\nThat native trend continues across all my benchmarked games, so where\u2019s the RTX 4090 performance Nvidia promised? You guessed it \u2013 the green team\u2019s talking exclusively about DLSS enhanced frame rates. For what it\u2019s worth, Multi-Frame Generation does help the mid-ranger outpace the flagship, as I was able to hit around 215fps with x4 MFG enabled while the 4090 couldn\u2019t quite reach the 200fps mark using x2.\nNvidia claims that 80% of users play games on RTX graphics cards with DLSS on. If you\u2019re one of those players, you\u2019ll effectively be hitting RTX 4090 frame rates using the RTX 5070 across your Steam library. I\u2019m planning to test even more games using the mid-range card throughout the generation, but in my usual go-to benchmark test subjects, the card pulls big moves with ray tracing off. Things are much tighter when you turn fancy lighting on, and the 4090 actually still beat the 5070 by 5fps in that instance, but I ended up with over 10% higher frame rates in Hitman 3 and over 20% in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.\nPersonally, I think comparing the RTX 5070\u2019s native performance to the last-gen Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super makes far more sense. Using Cyberpunk 2077 and Hitman 3 as benchmark examples, the Blackwell card manages to provide a modest native uplift that makes the GPU feel less generational at 4K. I\u2019m talking three frames of a difference in CP2077 with 4K Ultra Ray Tracing enabled, but the gap is far wider at 1440p.\nIn CD Projekt Red\u2019s RPG, I was able to comfortably hit 104fps, whereas the RTX 4070 Super taps out at 87fps. Hitman ran at 174fps versus 140fps on the Lovelace 70-class card, and since you won\u2019t be hitting that 60fps sweet spot at 4K on either card without DLSS assistance, the RTX 5070 makes more sense as a 1440p option at $549. If the last-gen model manages to show up for significantly less, it\u2019ll end up being the better value option, but MSRP versions are practically nonexistent right now.\nSince the RTX 5070 properly hits 4K with DLSS 4 enabled, I want to talk about what that will actually look like on your gaming monitor. For the most part, the visuals look pretty clean, and I couldn\u2019t find many instances of AI-related quirks, glitchy textures, or misinterpreted images. On occasion, I\u2019d see some finer details look slightly strange, most notably a bush in the Obsidian RPG Avowed that had a glowing marker during the opening, but even that was momentary. I also saw some signage in Cyberpunk 2077 briefly look a little garbled when speeding down Night City in a commandeered vehicle, which is something that also happened with the more expensive RTX 5080.\nFrom my experience, most of the visual hiccups are tied to Super Sampling rather than Frame Generation. I\u2019ve yet to see any drawbacks to using x4 MFG specifically compared to x2, and Nvidia Reflex does a nifty job of keeping latency issues at bay in shooters like Marvel Rivals. Keep in mind that in most games, you can switch MFG and SS on and off independently from each other, so if you ever do find visual weirdness tied to one of the options, tweaking settings can help.\nLet\u2019s take a moment to talk about the Asus RTX 5070 Prime OC I\u2019ve also been testing, as its faster clock speeds are somewhat promising. Using just the base factory overclock, I was able to grab a few extra frames here and there, and I was pretty impressed with Hitman 3 running at 302fps with DLSS 4 and MFG on. The three-fan setup means you\u2019ll be able to play around more with higher wattages and squeeze every drop out of Nvidia\u2019s GPU, and if you don\u2019t mind a slightly bulkier card, that could result in some nice performance gains.\nOnto thermals, and the highest recorded temperature I have for the RTX 5070 Founders Edition is 71\u00b0C. That was under full load in Dragon Age: The Veilguard with ray tracing and ultra settings maxed out, so it\u2019s safe to say this smaller card can keep itself pretty cool. For the most part, the reference model stayed within the mid-60s, but if that\u2019s not icy enough, then the fact the Asus Prime OC variant peaked at 67\u00b0C should please you. Keep in mind that\u2019s with the factory overclock enabled, so pushing things beyond the norm shouldn\u2019t get too toasty.\nShould you buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070?\nIt\u2019s not an RTX 4090 alternative, but the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 is a solid mid-range graphics card that\u2019ll help more players hit 4K for under $600. You\u2019ll have to make peace with the fact that DLSS 4 and Multi-Frame Generation are almost mandatory when it comes to UHD performance, but you\u2019re still getting pretty nice results for $50 less than the RTX 4070 Super at launch.\nNvidia is clearly trying to shift the GPU scene away from solely focusing on native benchmarks. That\u2019s exactly why it thinks the RTX 5070 boasts RTX 4090 levels of performance in the first place, and if the entire market ends up embracing AI upscaling as a default setting, marketing graphics cards in that way makes sense. While I\u2019m not seeing any glaring issues with using Mult-Frame Generation right now, there\u2019s no guarantee new quirks won\u2019t emerge in the future, so I\u2019m hoping releases without DLSS support won\u2019t suffer too much over the next two years.\nAMD isn\u2019t leaning quite as hard into AI with the Radeon RX 9070 series from the looks of things, as the company is sticking with standard Frame Generation and actively talking more about native performance. If that mid-range rival manages to pull off higher frame rates without assistance for under $600, Nvidia could find itself in a spot of bother, so we\u2019ll see what happens when I put the card through the same benchmarks.\nOf course, all of that also hinges on whether the RTX 5070 will be available at MSRP. If all the $549 / \u00a3539 stock sells out instantly, it could end up being side-lined. Ideally, retailers will have plenty of both Nvidia and AMD's next gen options available throughout the year, as this still truly help keep things competitive within the mid-range market.\nHow I tested the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070\nFor a week, I used the RTX 5070 Founders Edition and Asus Prime OC in my main gaming PC. During that time, I used Cyberpunk 2077, Hitman 3, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Total War: Warhammer 3, and Marvel Rivals to benchmark the GPU and record average frame rates. This enabled me to compare fps against both the RTX 4090 and RTX 4070 Super to assess whether the new model can provide better native and DLSS 4-enhanced results and whether there are any visual caveats tied to the latter.\nFor more information on how we test graphics cards, swing by our full GamesRadar+ hardware policy for more information.\nPhil is the Hardware Editor at GamesRadar and joined the team in 2023.

It's a 4070 Ti/5070 but for AMD. You're no longer sacrificing features by going AMD either since they caught up in ray tracing and upscaling. If this is either the same price or cheaper than the NVIDIA alternative then I'd recommend this for the additional VRAM. Cyberpunk with full RT can now hit 60fp or higher at native 1080p on a mid-range AMD card which is a huge improvement. Native path tracing is around 30fps but with some quality or balanced upscaling it is more than playable. If you don't care about ray-tracing you can expect 60fps at native 4K. If you're at 1440p you'll be perfectly fine.\nThis sapphire model has a nice design and great temps. This model can also push to 3000MHz and reach about a +10fps gain with some overclocking.

      "text": "The best gaming PC 2025: Take the pre-built route to greatness\n2025 is a great time to shop for one of the best gaming PCs\nIf you're shopping for one of the best gaming PCs right now, I have a few pointers for you. There are new components releasing this year which are starting to appear in prebuilt systems, but that also means it's getting harder to find the more affordable ones with the previous generation of components in them. With Prime Day sales to think about right now, it's a great time to try and get yourself some better value for money.\nThe name of the game right now in PC shopping world is futureproofing, in my opinion. Gaming PCs are pricey, and there's no point in spending loads of money if you're just going to need to upgrade again in a year or two because you're in need of an upgrade that can't slot onto your motherboard. The bright side is that there are now so many affordable DDR5 options out there, and in fact, in the prebuilt sections of any retailer, you have to look quite hard to find the DDR4 options these days.\nYou'll also be glad to know that prebuilt gaming PCs don't come with the same worries they did in years gone by. You can upgrade parts really easily these days, slotting in new RAM and storage whenever you see fit, and if you want the best performance boosts, upgrading GPU and CPU is possible too. There isn't as much proprietary bloatware installed these days either, so you can start with a clean slate and not something that's already slowed out of the box.\nThe Quick List\nBest overall\nThe Maingear Zero Ruby is the best gaming PC we've tested because it manages to blend powerful specs, price, and a great customer experience.\nBest budget\niBUYPOWER's Slate range is affordable for the specs you get inside them, but they're even easier to recommend since they're frequently discounted.\nBest mid-range\nThe HP Omen 35L is readily available in so many great mid-range configurations, and thanks to its use of well-known parts, it's one of our favorites.\nBest Cooling\nNZXT's Player Three gaming PC could also take the accolade for best high-end on this list, but its temperature control truly wowed me during testing.\nBest Alienware\nThe Alienware Aurora R16 is the best machine from Alienware that we've tested. It takes a more conventional path than the brand's usual PCs, which is a nice change.\nBest SFF\nThe Origin Chronos V3 is a new-gen behemoth stuffed inside a mini-ITX case. If you want a gaming PC with a smaller footprint, this is what you should choose.\nShow more \u2193\nBest 13th gen\nThe refreshed Acer Predator Orion 7000 for 2023 is the beefiest gaming PC we've had our hands on. It isn't without flaws, but it's a total powerhouse in 4K.\nBest handheld\nAsus' debut handheld PC is a portable powerhouse that trumps the Steam Deck, but it's pretty pricey. If you want something to take with you, this is our recommendation.\nRead more below\nI've been interested in gaming PCs since around 2019, and since I arrived here at GamesRadar+ as hardware editor, I've become the team's resident computer nerd. I won't lie, I found it tricky getting into this subset of technology because everything uses confusing naming conventions and it all costs way too much money. That's why I try to make my recommendations and explanations as easy to understand as possible, and my mission statement is to find you the best value for money in an expensive world.\nThe best gaming PC overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n- Our favorite configuration:\nMaingear Zero Ruby | RTX 4070 Super | Ryzen 7 7800X3D\nOur favorite configuration of Maingear's Zero range is... the Ruby - shocker! This lands bang smack in the middle of the configuration options, landing a decent mid-range price for a modern PC with zero cable clutter.\nPrebuilt gaming PCs don't often appeal to veteran players, and that's mainly because they make upgrading difficult, and because they traditionally used to come with loads of bloatware and pre-installed nonsense. Maingear has been around for a while now, and it bucks those grating trends of the PC world. The Maingear Zero range is a collection of beautifully assembled configurations that are worth every penny of their asking prices thanks to great cooling, solid customer service, and a lot of gaming power.\n\u2705 You want a great all-rounder. This isn't the most powerful PC we've tested, but it's still our favorite when you take specs, price, and the overall experience of buying a PC into account.\n\u2705 You want a great configuration. The parts this PC is powered by are perfectly balanced for great gaming performance across all the resolutions.\n\u2705 You want something quiet. Maingear is known for its liquid cooling, which stays quiet even when the PC is working overtime.\n\u274c You want the most power available. If you want the be-all end-all of 4K gaming, check out rigs with an RTX 4080 Super or RTX 4090.\n\u274c You are on a budget. Maingear does charge a fair amount for its PCs, but that might not fit for all budgets\n\u274c You want a smaller PC. The chassis for this PC is beautiful, but it's not the smallest.\nDesign & Features: The \"Zero\" in this PC's name comes from its motherboard, which was one of the first to features motherboard connecting pins on the back instead of the front. The result is an incredibly clean build that shows very view cables protruding where pristine components should be. There's a wide range of Zero PCs on offer from Maingear, but the version we tested, the Ruby, takes some beefy mid-range specs and prices them pretty affordably. The RTX 4070 Super powers things here, with a Ryzen 7 7800X3D thrown in for good measure. The liquid cooling is a standout and something this brand is known for.\nPerformance: If you want the absolute last word in 4K power, you'll probably be better off climbing up the price scale in the Zero range, but the 4070 Super is capable of great things at 1440p and 4K, so much so that I was able to play all of our benchmarking games at the highest resolution, achieving at least 60fps after playing around with a few settings.\nIn content creation, this PC also proved its worth, with the X3D cache tech from AMD proving very efficient in video editing. I also loved that Maingear didn't try to cut corners like a lot of PC brands by throwing in a less-than-ideal SSD in order to cut costs. The T-Force drive in this machine was as good as any of the top gen 4 drives I've benchmarked, and that's a real show of quality from this brand's builders.\nFinally, the lack of any bloat or preinstalled nonsense was such a delight. This is a near perfect-prebuilt PC that will last you well into the future.\nThe best budget gaming PC\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n- Our favorite configuration:\niBUYPOWER Slate 8MP 003 | RTX 4060 Ti | Intel Core i7-14700F\nThis is the version of the Slate that we reviewed, and we'd recommend it for the power it gives you across all three major resolutions. It's frequently discounted down to $1,249, which is a generous $200 less than its MSRP.\niBUYPOWER is a name you'll come across quickly if you start shopping for a gaming PC in the US. This is a brand that makes itself widely available at a slew of retailers and offers genuine value for money. Its PCs are well-built, and priced fairly, but its frequent supply of discounts is what makes us keen to tell you about them.\n\u2705 You want something discounted. No matter the occasion, you can almost always find discounts on iBUYPOWER's gaming PCs. If you're looking for a deal, this is the brand for you.\n\u2705 You want something easy to use. Despite some packaging woes with our review unit, and the fact we had to install the GPU ourselves, this was an easy PC to set up and use, with minimal bloatware out of the box.\n\u2705 You want good parts for your money. Despite being discounted often, the iBUYPOWER Slate range has up-to-date parts in it.\n\u274c You want liquid cooling. For an air-cooled gaming PC, this stays surprisingly quiet, but if you want something truly stylish that keeps the noise down, look elsewhere.\n\u274c You hate RGB. One look at this rig in the images above will show you how much RGB there is in this rig. If you aren't a fan, this isn't the PC for you.\n\u274c You want a quick SSD. The SSDs used in these PCs are disappointingly slow, so if you want snappy loading times, look at upgrading or look for another gaming PC.\nDesign & Features: The iBUYPOWER Slate 8MP 003 we tested is just one model from a wider range, but it comes with an RTX 4060 Ti GPU and a 14th Gen Intel Core i7 processor. With that combination, you've got plenty of road to run on regardless of the resolution you like to play at. 4K results won't be spectacular, but they'll be playable, and boostable with DLSS.\nThe case you get in the most recent Slate models is part mesh, and part transparent paneling, and this helps with airflow. There's no liquid cooling for your money here, but the case and homemade CPU cooler do a good job of keeping the motherboard's components calm under pressure. If you like RGB, there's loads to enjoy with the design of this case, which also supplies a healthy amount of connectivity for USB devices. Upgrading parts will be easy thanks to a toolless design that provides easy access to the PC's innards.\nPerformance: I was pleasantly surprised by the consistent power the 14700F and 4060 Ti gave me when testing this PC. The Slate managed to score 60fps in all but one of our benchmarking games when playing in 4K with maxed-out settings. Of course, when you turn ray tracing on, these scores start to dip, but this configuration laughs in the face of anyone who says the 4060 Ti graphics card is for 1080p only.\nThe one major disappointment of this PC is the slow sequential speeds of its SSD, which failed to match the PS5's minimal speed requirements. Luckily, there's an additional M.2 port on the motherboard if you feel the need to upgrade.\nThe best mid-range gaming PC\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n- Our favorite configuration:\nHP Omen 35L | RTX 4060 | AMD Ryzen 5 8500G at Best Buy\nThis configuration is exactly why we love HP's Omen PCs. It's got solid parts in it, but since it's available at a few different retailers, it's a pretty affordable deal, all told. There are more powerful alternatives of this PC available at Best Buy too.\nThe HP Omen desktops have been a staple of the PC market for a while now, but the brand's latest version, the Omen 35L, blends a new chassis design with premium mid-range components this line of rigs is known for. Thanks to its wide availability across so many retailers, this is a rig you'll see often, and frequently discounted. Despite that, it's got some really great parts in it, as we found in our review.\n\u2705 You want a solid mid-range build There's a wide variety of parts that can come in these PCs, but you can bet they'll offer to versatile power for your money.\n\u2705 You want well-known parts. HP's PCs use components from Nvidia, AMD, Intel, but also WD and Kingston, which gives you more reassurance over PCs using budget components.\n\u2705 You want to be able to upgrade later. There are plenty of ways to upgrade these machines, and they're well futureproofed already.\n\u274c You want an AIO cooler as standard. Despite seeing a lot of AIO options in marketing materials, liquid-cooled versions of the 35L are harder to come by.\n\u274c You want high-end parts. You'd be amazed what mid-range components can do these days, but if you want the top drawer CPUs and GPUs, you may need to look elsewhere.\n\u274c You're on a really tight budget. HP's PCs can be discounted regularly, but if you're on a super tight budget, there's no denying that you can find things for cheaper.\nDesign & Features: The 35L replaces the recently discontinued 30L chassis in HP's Omen lineup. That machine had stood as a hero in the mid-range PC division for a number of years, often coming out as the goldilocks option between its 25L and 40L siblings. Those two entry-level and high-end machines still exist, but the catch-all 35L now sits as a current-gen flagship for those looking for a better case design.\nThe older Omen chassis did have its issues. It was famously one of the louder PC cases out there, and the 30L could suffer the worst of that because of the demanding parts that were crammed inside it. This new chassis sports better and quieter cooling solutions instead, as well as a modernized design that doesn't have quite the same formal look. You may see a lot of Omen fans and AIO cooling chatter in the marketing material for this PC, and it's a real shame that that liquid cooler isn't standard in all of these machines. A lot of them, including our review unit, come with an RGB air cooler, which did manage to stay quiet, but isn't the true solution we were hoping for.\nPerformance: The modernized configurations do speak for themselves, though. The review system we tested packed an RTX 4070 Super and an AMD Ryzen 7 8700GG, which did more than enough to satiate our 4K60 ambitions and take things to a much higher gear in lower resolutions. Because so many retailers can pack their own versions of this machine, you'll find plenty of great configurations, including a few 50 series ones, too, depending on where you shop. Because you're bound to get a lot of options here, there's a lot of mid-range versatility at play with the 35L.\nAs is the case 80% of the time with prebuilds, though, we'd swap out the SSD or invest in a secondary gaming drive as soon as you can. The WD label on this PC's storage is great, but the Blue color doesn't hold a candle to the value for money you'd get in older HP Omen desktops with WD Black drives.\nThe best gaming PC for cooling\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNZXT's Player PCs have come under a lot of scrutiny in the last year or so, and understandably so. The brand's Flex subscription is a serious low-point for the PC market, and we do not endorse it whatsoever. We can, however, recommend the company's fully purchasable prebuilts. We tested out the Player Three RTX 5080 Edition, and although it could easily be counted among the best high-end configurations on the market today, the real way it leaves the other building brands in the dust is through its cooling.\n\u2705 You want a high-end rig. All of the Player Three options are absurdly powerful, so if you want a PC that you don't need to compromise with, this is an excellent option.\n\u2705 You do content creation as well as gaming. You can get AMD's gaming and content creation X3D processors in these machines, which are well worth the investment.\n\u2705 You care about temperature control. If you're worried about temperatures or you just want to ensure your components have the longest lives possible, you'll struggle to find better cooling than this.\n\u274c You don't need high-end parts. The Player One and Player Two PCs will be more up your street\n\u274c You want the best deal possible. NZXT frequently has discounts and offers running, but there are definitely cheaper builds out there.\n\u274c You don't trust the brand after the Flex controversy. I hear you, the Flex subscription shouldn't exist, and it's hard to trust the brand after that. All I can recommend is the experience I had with the \"for sale\" option.\nDesign & Features: It should be no surprise that cooling is a massive win for one of NZXT's gaming PCs. The brand has been making some of the most sought-after AIO coolers on the shelves for a while now. I'll admit, I had my doubts about the RTX 5080 edition only having a 240mm cooler as opposed to NZXT's full-size Kraken Elite 360. I reviewed that flagship cooler not too long before trying out this PC, and I wanted to see what it could do inside a fully NZXT-branded rig. The 240mm model did more than enough however, as I'll come onto.\nWhat may surprise you, is that although NZXT makes coolers, motherboards, and cases of its own, the motherboard inside the review sample I was given had a Gigabyte motherboard. ASRock manufactures NZXT's motherboards, so I thought if any partner brand would supply things for its best gaming PC, it'd be them. Nonetheless, the motherboard combined with NZXT's Flow case and aforementioned cooler provide an incredible blend of thermals, aesthetics, and connectivity.\nPerformance: The review system I used harnessed an RTX 5080 and an X3D processor, so as you can imagine, it was capable of out of this world benchmarking scores. If you opt for the 4080, 7900XTX, 4090, or 5090 options, you'll no doubt have a similar experience to me, but the cooling is what I came away floored by. For how much power is in this machine, the CPU didn't take a serious look at 50 degrees celsius, with most of my benchmarking operating between 30 and 40 degrees. AMD's excellent CPU design is to be praised there too, but it takes a special cooler and a well-crafted build to keep modern components that calm.\nIf there's one thing I'd change, it'd be the SSD used in this machine. Most prebuilt manufacturers tend to lean on affordably drives they can buy in bulk, like the WD Blue content creator drives. These are fine for entry-level and mid-range rigs, but for a powerhouse like the Player Three, I really do wish they'd splash down a speedier terabyte or two.\nThe best Alienware gaming PC\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n- Our favourite configuration:\nAlienware Aurora R16 | RTX 4060 | Intel Core i7-14700F | $1,549.99 at Dell\nAlienware desktop PCs can be hard to afford, so one with mid-range specs that isn't grossly overpriced is nice to see. This is a nice mix of parts for the money, and the processor is up-to-date too.\nAlienware Aurora gaming PCs usually look a bit more out-of-this-world than its latest Aurora R16. With its most recent chassis design, the brand has scaled back the weirdness in lieu of a smaller, more recognizable gaming PC. Be warned, Alienware has never been the best brand to pick if you have plans to upgrade your gaming PC later on, and the continuance of its proprietary motherboard and cooling here will continue to put walls up around the configuration you buy. Still, no brand does it quite like Alienware.\n\u2705 You want powerful, modern gaming specs: The Aurora R16 is the latest gaming PC design from the brand, which means you'll be able to choose up to 14th gen Intel parts.\n\u2705 You want an RTX 4090 in a gaming PC: It's not all that common to see the absolute top-dog GPU in prebuilt machines, but Alienware allows you to go all-in.\n\u2705 You have budget to play with: Alienware rigs don't come cheap, so be prepared to pay more than you would for other builds on this page.\n\u274c You have upgrading ambitions: Alienware's proprietary choices make it difficult to futureproof this PC. If you're happy to buy another machine when the time comes, feel free to jump in here.\n\u274c You're trying to keep costs down: Again, this brand will often charge more money than others. You do get good deals throughout the year, but if you're scraping pennies together, you can get more for your money elsewhere.\nDesign & Features: Gone is the positively alien chassis design of the Aurora R12-R15s - this is a much more conventional case to house a modern gaming PC, but it still has that distinct character that Alienware's gear is known for. There are lovely lighting points, clever fan systems that resemble Dyson's handwriting, and solid connectivity. If you're upgrading from a previous Alienware PC, you'll be glad to know this cuts the size of the machine down without losing the potential for beefy parts like the RTX 4090, and it runs so much quieter.\nThe Alienware Command Centre will help you adjust metrics, which can be useful if you want to play around in settings to get the perfect performance for your needs. This app is what you can use to control the RGB lighting as well, which is a welcome aesthetic option.\nPerformance: The configuration of the R16 we tested came with an RTX 4090 and a 13th gen Intel Core i9 processor, so as you can imagine, it trounced our benchmarking tests at 4K. Despite the quieter performance, the AIO cooler managed to keep the infamously hot-running Raptor Lake flagship processor down below 90\u00b0C.\nYou can see from the benchmarking scores below how capable a gaming PC this rig can be when you really splash out for the best parts. Phil, our reviewer was testing Esporty monitors with refresh rates in the 500Hz range while testing this PC, and managed to achieve some ridiculous 1080p performance.\nAlienware isn't the brand we'd recommend to everyone these days for the value prospect alone, but the R16's more conventional design could point to a brighter direction for the brand which opens up its compatibility and upgrading prospects in the years to come.\nThe best small form factor gaming PC\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n- Our favorite configuration:\nOrigin Chronos | Build your own\nThis may be a bit of a cheat answer, but our favorite configuration of this PC is the one you can build for yourself. This way, you get to choose the innards you actually need, and you don't need to waste money on a part you may not get much use out of. For more expensive brands, this may be the answer to saving some pennies.\nThe Origin Chronos V3 is undeniably expensive, but it packs an RTX 4080 and Intel Core i9 CPU into a console-sized case. That means it's perfect for keeping in your living room or karting off to LAN events, and its dinky design doesn't compromise gaming PC performance.\n\u2705 You'd like an actual desktop PC. ITX gaming PCs are very inventive, and they allow you to actually keep a gaming PC on top of your desk, which is uncommon in today's market.\n\u2705 You'd like 4K power. Although this PC is customizable, you can squeeze an RTX 4080 inside it, which means an awful lot of punch for a smaller fighter.\n\u2705 Stylish RGB lighting appeals to you. This is a mesh case with no transparent panels, but the RGB fans still shine through, and look quite stylish, if we may say so.\n\u274c You'd like to show off inner components. No transparent panels can mean less to show off\n\u274c You're on a budget. Origin makes some excellent PCs, but they don't come cheap. Make sure you're on top of your savings for this one.\n\u274c You want a conventional case. ITX builds have their quirks, and if small strays from the conventional PC path scare you, you might be better off elsewhere.\nDesign & Features: The downside to the Chronos V3 is naturally related to its size, as there's not much room inside that Corsair 2000D case. That might be an issue down the line when you decide to upgrade, especially if graphics cards grow larger than they currently are right now. However, it'll probably be a while before you have to swap out the premium components in this PC, as it's also rocking up to 64GB DDR5 RAM and pretty of storage.\nYou don't have to opt for the build featured in our review, as you can customize your own Chronos V3 rig to suit your specific needs. Just keep in mind that if you are looking for a budget build, there are cheaper options than this out there with roomier cases.\nPerformance: We put the Chronos V3 through our usual PC benchmark tests, and found that it can rip through demanding games at 4K with max settings enabled. Better still, it can pull off extraordinary frame rates thanks to Nvidia DLSS 3, and we even managed to achieve well over 100fps in Cyberpunk 2077 with everything cranked up high (although we didn't go anywhere near Psycho mode).\nThe best 13th gen gaming PC\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOur favorite configuration:\nAcer Predator Orion 7000 | Intel Core i7-12700F | RTX 3080\nWhile not quite as tanked out as our review unit, this Acer Predator Orion 7000 configuration marries up price and power at $1,949.99, with specs that are ready for the future. This machine is utilizing 16GB DDR5 RAM so it will be technologically relevant for years to come. Features: Intel Core i7-12700K, RTX 3080, 32GB RAM, 1TB NVMe SSD + 2TB HDD.\nThe Acer Predator Orion 7000 has been one of the top dogs of the prebuilt gaming PC market for a while now. With the Orion 7000 of 2022 releasing just before the launch of new-gen CPUs, GPUs, and more widespread adoption of DDR5 RAM, Acer made the wise decision to refresh its flagship gaming PC with a new motherboard that could handle the power of these 13th Gen Intel processors.\n\u2705 You want power. The upper allowance of configurations here is wild, and the version we tested is a testament to that. If you want the beefiest parts, this is a reliable option.\n\u2705 You are okay with a more up-to-date version being available. We haven't tested it yet, and it isn't out yet, but there is a redesign of this PC coming soon that may fix many of the problems we had with it.\n\u2705 You don't mind paying a bit more. Acer has some great options on the shelves, but they aren't always the cheapest.\n\u274c You want something quiet. This is up there with the noisiest PCs we've ever tested, so keep that in mind.\n\u274c You want good temperature control. I'm not joking, even with all the fan noise, you'll still have to deal with a lot of high temperatures.\n\u274c You hate proprietary software. It's not super intrusive, but you will need to deal with the odd bit of software that's pre-installed on Acer's computers.\nDesign & Features: Now fully compatible with 13th Gen CPUs, DDR5, and wielding the Lovelace power of Nvidia's RTX 40 series, Acer has updated its flagship's innards for increased futureproofing.\nThe version we tested was crammed full of power, housing an unlocked 13th Gen Intel Core i9-13900KF CPU and an RTX 4090. Although that rig, in particular, is pricey, and probably one of the most powerful gaming PCs you can get your hands on at the moment, the Predator Orion 7000 can be found in more configurations than ever before, and we're sure as time goes on we'll begin to see a wider spread of builds up and down the price range.\nPerformance: Having said that, if you're going to buy this monster of a gaming PC, I would strongly, strongly urge you to take a look at the best PC headset for gaming, because by golly are you going to need it. The fans in this rig seem louder than they've ever been, and in all honesty, don't do a great job of keeping the components cool. 13th Gen CPUs are known to run hot, but no one should have to suffer this much noise pollution for temperatures that are still this high.\nFinally, I'm a bit baffled by the fact that these newly refreshed motherboards don't have any XMP compatibility. On the other hand, we did recently review the new Orion X and see improvements to the Predator Sense BIOS, so if those improvements have rolled out to other Acer PCs, you could be in luck.\nThe best handheld gaming PC\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOur favorite configuration:\nAsus ROG Ally | 512GB SSD | Ryzen Z1 Processor\nFor $504, you get the Asus Rog Ally as well as a small cleaning cloth, screen protector, and a handy USB hub. For the price, this isn't a bad little bundle to get your hands on.\nThe Asus ROG Ally is one of the best gaming handheld options out there for PC players, and while we love the Steam Deck, this rival packs more of a punch. Not only can it run more games since it's a Windows 11 device, but it's surprisingly capable at 1080p.\n\u2705 You want to game on the go. A handheld gaming PC is a bit like the Nintendo Switch in that you can buy a dock for it to use at home, but you can also take it on the train, on holiday, or on work trips. There's no limit to where you take your at-home setup with a device like this.\n\u2705 You're like controller inputs. It goes without saying, but if you aren't the biggest fan of using a gamepad, a handheld gaming PC might be a little grating for you.\n\u2705 You aren't married to the original Steam Deck. Although Valve's version was the original, the market really has exploded with new options. If you want a handheld gaming PC but want a more powerful alternative, this is it.\n\u274c You mainly play at home. If you're not actually in need of something to take with you on the go, you're going to struggle to find a need for a handheld.\n\u274c You're expecting gaming PC power and high framerates. Handheld tech has come a long way, but if you're expecting those high frame rate gaming sessions to carry over to this device, you might struggle.\n\u274c You mainly play FPS games. This one might come down to you, but first-person shooters may not feel great on a smaller controller-like device like this, especially if you play competitively.\nDesign & Features: Equipped with a 7-inch 120Hz 1080p display, the ROG Ally provides visuals above and beyond the handheld norm. For context, the Steam Deck's built-in display sticks to a lower 800p resolution, and the Nintendo Switch is still rocking a 720p screen (albeit an OLED one). Just like its rivals, it's kitted out with integrated controls, but you can also connect it to the best Steam Deck dock and turn it into a mini low-spec desktop rig.\nThe ROG Ally doesn't look drastically different from other handheld PCs out there, but it certainly looks like an Asus product. Its white shell and RGB accents underneath its thumb sticks stand out compared to Valve's subtle handheld, not to mention its screen is 16:9 rather than 16:10. It's definitely a great-looking handheld, and it's pretty comfortable to hold too thanks to its ergonomic shape and weight distribution.\nPerformance: Admittedly, the ROG Ally isn't the fastest handheld PC in the West, as that accolade currently belongs to the more expensive Ayaneo 2S. However, it's still a mean machine and can run games like Cyberpunk 2077 at 60fps when using the same resolution and settings as the Steam Deck. If you fancy it, you can dial things up to 1080p to take advantage of the handheld's screen, but it fully depends on whether you prefer higher fps or fidelity.\nUltimately, the Asus ROG Ally is portable for players looking for a proper on-the-go PC experience. That comes with some caveats, as Windows is less optimised for portable play than SteamOS. Nevertheless, if you want all the functionality of your rig within your palms, you'll want to consider this heroic handheld.\nBest gaming PCs - frequently asked questions\nWhat are the best gaming PC specs right now?\nAt the moment, in terms of GPU, you're looking at either the Nvidia RTX 5090 or 5080. On the AMD side, the best you can buy right now is the Radeon RX 9070XT. For processors, you'll be looking to get either the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K, or the Intel Core i9-14900K. Those processors will give you a lot of power, but for gaming specifically, you're probably better off getting one of the AMD 3D V-Cache chips. The most recent, most powerful of these are the AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D, or the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D.\nIs it cheaper to build or buy a gaming PC?\nA couple of years ago this question would have been far more straightforward to answer, as, before the pandemic hit, it was always cheaper to build with individual components than opt for a prebuilt. Nowadays it really depends on what PC you're looking to build. There's great value to be had in cheaper components at the moment, and it's possible to build an RTX gaming PC for under a grand. But in the higher-end, prices can skyrocket when you try to assemble the best components. It can save you a lot of fuss, and a lot of money to buy a prebuild.\nIs it worth buying a PC for gaming?\nDespite the fact that a gaming PC will cost you substantially more than the likes of an Xbox Series X and PS5, at least in the majority of cases, we think that the initial investment is justified by the expanse of what the platform offers over consoles. For example, PCs can be futureproofed a lot easier, since you can change out components if and when you need to. You have way more control over what your gaming hardware can do and how it can run games, you also have far more options regarding backwards compatibility, for far more expansive digital libraries. Perhaps the biggest advantage of a gaming PC is that it can used in a myriad more ways than a typical games console can for work, media production, coding, home server, etc.\nWhich PC brands are best for gaming?\nWhile there are many gaming PC brands that certainly deserve your attention, we typically view the prebuilt market in two distinct categories - boutique built (ABS, Skytech, iBuyPower, etc.) and manufacturer made (Alienware, HP, Corsair, etc.). If you want something sleek that benefits from a manufacturer's guarantee and extended warranty then the latter is going to be preferable for you, however, should you want minimal bloatware and consumer-level components inside (instead of proprietary parts) then the former is the way to go.\nBest gaming PCs: Glossary\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nGPU / Graphics Card\nThe GPU, or graphics processing unit, is the part of your PC that will run the show when it comes to gaming. It handles all the visual and graphical tasks you throw at your PC. The inclusion of one of these is what separates most regular PCs from gaming-specific ones because it's an extra processor specifically for more demanding rendering tasks.\nThere are a few main manufacturers of GPUs today. Nvidia is the biggest and most popular one, which you'll know from its RTX 30 and 40 series. AMD has its Radeon RX 7000 series, which is a little harder to find in prebuilt gaming PCs, but presents better value. Intel has the Arc series, but we haven't ever seen these in prebuilt PCs.\nCPU / Processor\nThe CPU is the brain of a computer. It stands for Central Processing Unit and it's essentially the center through which all of the data your PC has to process, is transferred. The CPU is an important part of your gaming rig because it essentially runs the show and tells the rest of your build what to do.\nThere are two manufacturers of gaming CPUs, AMD and Intel. Intel usually puts more Cores and Threads in (the parts that make up a CPU) but tends to charge more. AMD gives you fewer cores and threads, but its architecture means you still get efficient gaming power without needing to pay as much.\nRAM / Memory\nRAM stands for Random Access Memory, and it's a very underrated part of any PC, mainly because people don't tend to be too certain of what it does. The memory of a PC isn't to be confused with storage, which is where all of your files are held. RAM is essentially a much faster form of storage that holds the files your processor needs to access rapidly. So when multitasking, or browsing lots of different tabs, the RAM will help your processor keep up to its promised speeds by acting like a short-term memory.\nThe current generation of RAM is DDR5, which is extremely quick and efficient but requires a different motherboard than DDR4. DDR5 RAM can't work with a DDR4 motherboard, but DDR4 can work on a DDR5 motherboard sometimes, so it's important that you check you have the right system for you before you buy.\nSSD / Storage\nAn SSD is a solid-state drive, and it's an efficient form of digital storage that can transfer data quickly thanks to clever circuitry. For gaming, a good SSD with strong sequential read and write speeds will ensure you don't sit around in loading screens for too long, and that you can install new applications quickly.\nThese days, you'll almost always find NVMe M.2 SSDs in prebuilt gaming PCs. There are also SATA SSDs which are slower, and more complicated to install in a gaming PC than NVMe ones. HDDs are the most traditional form of computing storage, but they're often too slow to be included in most PCs today except as additional space.\nMotherboard\nThe motherboard is the skeleton of your computer, and it's the central body your various components will connect through. There are loads of different sizes of motherboards and manufacturers that will vary what a motherboard can actually do. Some have better connectivity than others, and some may feature compatibility others don't. Generally for prebuilt PCs, you don't need to worry too much about the motherboard, unless you have specific futureproofing worries and plans while shopping.\nAIO cooler\nSome PCs are air-cooled only, using the intake and exhaust fans of your case. These tend to be louder, and when a CPU is cooled only by a fan, it can be harder to manage temperatures. An AIO cooler is an all-in-one cooler because it uses a liquid coolant, a radiator, and fans to control your CPU temperatures and help to regulate the temperature of your entire PC. These types of coolers tend to be more efficient and stay much quieter than using air only.\nCase / Chassis\nA case is the box you put all your PC components in. It'll keep them neat and tidy, and perhaps most importantly, it'll keep them cool.\nYou can get all sorts of cases these days, and the most traditional is the ATX size, which you can usually see with at least one transparent panel that lets you show off various RGB-lit components. There are also much smaller ITX cases that let you hold the same kind of power without taking up loads of space under a desk or on top of one. You can get some middling sizes that blend ITX and ATX, which you may find as Micro ATX. If you want the biggest size possible you'll probably look at EATX.\nHow we test gaming PCs\nWhile we've outlined how we test gaming PCs in our full hardware policy, it's worth giving the rundown here, too. Every PC we test will get run through its paces. We usually use each PC we review as we would our own machines. That means working, playing, and sometimes creating content on it before we come to a verdict.\nFor general use, this can mean working on it, which can require heavy multitasking power as we write articles, take video calls, and browse international shops to find you the best deals while using VPNs.\nOf course, we'll also do a hefty amount of personal gaming on each rig we test, which can be a great barometer for how they compare to the personal machines we use every day. This can involve playing the latest and greatest demanding games or trying to clear a backlog of older titles we never did get to.\nThen, there are our more formal performance tests. We'll start with software benchmarks using industry-standard programs. To test the CPU, we'll use Cinebench, to test the RAM, we'll check out some numbers and XMP profiles in the BIOS, as well as CPU-Z. SSD testing is done with CrystalDiskMark, and we use 3DMark to run a PC through its gaming paces.\nWe'll also run it through the gauntlet of our demanding benchmarking games. We use Hitman World of Assassination, Returnal, Total War: Warhammer 3, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and Cyberpunk 2077 for gaming tests. These games all come with their own benchmarking tests within their settings to give us a standardized, fair examination of how each rig compares to another. We'll toggle resolutions and DLSS settings, as well as Ray Tracing to keep tabs on various levels of performance here.\nMake the most of the best gaming PCs with the best gaming keyboards, best gaming mouse, and best gaming monitors.\nAnd for audio upgrades, check out the best computer speakers and best gaming headsets going.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nOne of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands. Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I\u2019ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension.\n- Phil HaytonHardware Editor"

      "text": "Best graphics card 2025: the top GPU options I'd recommend for PC gamers\nHere are the best graphics cards for gaming available now\nPicking up the best graphics card in 2025 is anything but easy. Not only are PC players facing another generation where GPUs simply aren't available, but custom card prices are placing many models out of reach. It's hard to get excited about shiny new components when you can't actually get hold of them, so I'm keeping that in mind as I test new contenders.\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is still my best graphics card pick overall despite its beefy RTX 5090 sibling arriving on the scene. If I'm being real with you, both GPUs aren't realistic options for most players due to their price tag, so while I'll acknowledge that they' offer up tremendous 4K abilities, my real starting point is the GeForce RTX 5080. Even then, that cheaper card is extremely hard to get hold of and can cost far too much if you go for a custom model.\nIf you're simply looking for a great GPU right now that boasts great value and performance, you'll find my current best graphics card picks below. If you can find current gen options for a good price, it could be worth picking them up instead of jumping into next-gen options, but if I'm being real with you, it's better to let the next wave arrive before any big spends.\nQuick list\nBest overall\nThe best overall\nThe Nvidia RTX 4090 is still an absolute powerhouse GPU in 2025 thanks to its beefy specs.\nBest for most\nThe best for most players\nNvidia's latest 80-class card packs a next-gen 4K punch and DLSS 4 abilities.\nBest budget\nThe best budget\nThe Radeon RX 7600 is one of the cheapest new gen GPUs right now, and it provides a nifty 1080p PC experience.\nBest under $500\nThe best under $500\nFor the money, AMD's mid-ranger offers up great 4K capabilities.\nRead more below\nBest 4k\nThe best 4K\nIf you're looking for a reliable UHD experience, AMD's premium GPU has you more than covered.\nBest 1440p GPU\nThe best 1440p\nIf you're aiming for QHD visuals that won't require settings tweaks, the RTX 4070 Super is the mid-range GPU to check out.\nLoad the next product \u2193\nBest 1080p GPU\nThe best 1080p\nThe RTX 4060 is the cheapest new-gen GeForce GPU on the block, but it still packs a 1080p punch.\nBest value\nThe best value\nPacking 16GB VRAM and great 1440p capabilities, the Intel Arc A770 is phenomenal value if you can grab it at the right price.\nRead more below\nPhil has been using the latest graphics cards since the GeForce 256 was a thing, and those years of experience and expertise comes in handy when testing brand new GPU options. Our gaming PC expert spends hours benchmarking new Nvidia and AMD cards so that you don't have to, and while high frame rates are important, they'll always base their recommendations with approachable PC gaming in mind.\nApril 22, 2025 - I've just finished up my RTX 5060 Ti review, and while the GPU packs a nice 1440p punch and offers up a generational performance uplift, I'm not ready to award it with a place on my list. That's largely because the RTX 5060 hasn't landed yet and I'm keen to see whether spending $300 can get you a decent experience, but I'll also be testing the RX 9070 XT to see if it can offer up a better mid-range balance between price and specs.\nThe best graphics card overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIt'll soon be replaced by the RTX 5090, but the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is the most powerful graphics card right now by a country mile, and is has undoubtedly changed the standards of PC gaming. Not only does it run circles around its predecessor, the RTX 3090 Ti, but it also benefits from new AI tricks that will help keep it on the throne for even longer. That said, the card's $1,499 / \u00a31,649 MSRP means is firmly an enthusiast option.\n\u2705 You want raw power: Nvidia's flagship graphics card can punch much harder than anything else on the market without using upscaling tricks.\n\u2705 You play at 4K: You won't have to think about dialing back settings to maintain UHD visuals using the 4090, making it one of the first true 4K cards.\n\u2705 You value ray traying: Out of every GPU right now, the 4090 is the one that can handle ray tracing and still maintain high frame rates at 4K.\n\u274c You aren't a PC enthusiast: Other graphics cards can reach well over 100fps at 4K, and Nvidia's flagship more caters to players looking for extreme performance regardless of price.\n\u274c You've got a small gaming PC: The RTX 4090 is extremely chonky, and that could stop you from squeezing it into small cases with only a few GPU slots available.\nFeatures: Thanks to a 4nm GPU, the RTX 4090 packs in 52% more graphics processing CUDA cores than the RTX 3090 Ti, and it also runs 43% faster than the RTX 3090 Ti as well \u2014 all while drawing the same amount of power as the last-gen card. Despite its hardware prowess, some of the 4090's biggest strengths are found in the software side of things, as this card launched alongside Nvidia's Frame Generation tech, which works in conjunction with DLSS to boost fps beyond the imaginable.\nDesign: We checked out the RTX 4090 Founder's Edition when it arrived in 2022, and it's one of the best looking versions of the card out there. Nvidia's blend of silver and black metal help the shroud feel a bit more sophisticated than custom variants, and its illuminated logo steers clear of the usual gamer aesthetic. Its fans are also sensibly placed, but we're not too keen on both the placement and design of the GPU's 12VHPWR connector, which uses a dongle to bridge PSU compatibility.\nPerformance: In terms of gaming performance, it\u2019s the only graphics card that can confidently game at a native 4K resolution with ray tracing without the help of DLSS. It\u2019s more than 50% faster on average than the RTX 3090 Ti, and with DLSS 3 with full frame generation, the RTX 4090 can get as much as double the frame rate achieved with last gen\u2019s DLSS 2.0.\nVerdict: If you can comfortably afford an RTX 4090, you probably won't need to upgrade your GPU for the best part of a decade. While most screens out there largely stick to 4K, Nvidia's latest flagship GPU can actually handle 8K gaming, meaning it'll play nice with screens of the future that cater to beyond UHD. Not that we'd suggest picking one up for that purpose, as the RTX 5090 will send it into retirement.\nRead more: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 review\nPeformance | 5/5 |\nDesign | 4/5 |\nFeatures | 5/5 |\nSoftware | 5/5 |\nPrice | 3/5 |\nThe best graphics card for most players\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIt's safe to say the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 is still a premium GPU, but the new Blackwell model is the card most players should aim for. Sure, if you've got at least $2,000 burning a hole in your pocket, you'll want to invest in the RTX 5090. However, I'd recommend the 80-class card first since it boasts new DLSS 4 superpowers and\n\u2705 You want a 4K capable GPU: If you're looking to play using UHD resolutions and minimal compromise, the RTX 5080 will save you from tweaking settings to boost fps.\n\u2705 You're willing to use DLSS: While the RTX 5090 will provide ridiculous frame rates in all the latest games, the RTX 5080 will still pull off spectacular results if you take advantage of DLSS 4.\n\u2705 You're looking for a sleek card: Nvidia has made the Founders Edition RTX 5080 much smaller than even the last-gen RTX 4070 Ti, so this is a great option for cramped cases.\n\u274c You want the best 4K ray tracing results: If you want something that makes short work of path tracing at 4K without DLSS 4 enabled, the RTX 5090 might be a better fit.\n\u274c You're aiming to play at 1440p: Those of you who aren't fussed about 4K might be better waiting for the RTX 4070 or the slightly beefier RTX 4070 Ti.\nFeatures: Just like the rest of the RTX 5000 crew, the RTX 5080 enters the scene with a new box of AI upscaling tricks. Dubbed DLSS 4, the next-gen version includes \"Multi-frame Generation\" support that'll enable you to boost fps even further using generated frames, and you'll encounter fewer visual quirks thanks to the new Transformer model under the hood. Simply put, by enabling 4X Frame Generation in supported games, you'll end up playing at much higher frame rates with less caveats than before.\nDLSS 4 is exclude to RTX 50-series cards, making it a huge selling point for the next-generation range. There are players who will argue that Multi-Frame Generation isn't a true performance boost since it's artificially predicting visuals. But, it's hard to ignore the benefits when it comes to single player games, and with a Nvidia Reflex 2 on the way to kick latency to the curb, it could even come in handy for fast-paced shooters.\nDesign: Nvidia has found a sweet spot with its Founders Edition design this generation, resulting in an RTX 5080 that is much sleeker than its 4080 predecessor. The card will only take up two PCIe slots in your PC case, which should create less havoc if you're currently using an older GPU. That said, keep in mind that if you go for a custom overclocked card, you might end up with something the same size as the RTX 4090 since it'll feature extra cooling.\nThat's not to say the RTX 5080 hasn't got a lavish fan setup, as Nvidia's redesign enables the card to keep itself much cooler using dual-fans. The GPU maker has actually split its main PCB up into three parts this time around in a bid to direct airflow and position heatsinks more efficiently, resulting in a card that's better at fighting off heat.\nAs for power, you'll have to use Nvidia's new 12-pin connector like before. For most of you, that'll mean using the included PSU cable dongle in the box, so keep that in mind if you've got a specific cable management strategy. Thankfully, the green team has placed the GPU's socket at an angle to help direct cabling out of the way and prevent any damage during installation. While the company has resolved the melty cable issues associated with Lovelace cards, this extra step will help ensure it doesn't happen again via wear and tear.\nPerformance: I've spent a lot of time benchmarking both the Founders Edition RTX 5080 and the custom PNY RTX 5080 OC, and it's safe to say both pack beastly 4K capabilities. The performance jump between the RTX 4080 Super and the new Blackwell GPU is a bit modest, but you're still getting faster visuals than before and the option to boost things even further using DLSS 4.\nTo paint a picture of RTX 5080 performance, I was able to run Cyberpunk 2077 with 4K Ultra settings enabled at 71fps with no AI upscaling assistance. That's a pretty nice uplift compared to 57fps using the RTX 4080 Super, but taking advantage of 4X Multi-Frame Generation ramps that figure up to a remarkable 316fps. Those same benefits apply to outings like Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which leaped from a native 77fps to 288fps with DLSS 4 on, hammering home the benefits of the new features.\nNaturally, you will be able to spot discrepancies with DLSS 4 if you squint hard enough, but I only really noticed a difference in fast paced scenarios. During ordinary gameplay, you're unlikely to notice anything that'll completely break your immersion, so it's hard to argue against using the AI tools. What I will say is that support isn't a given right now in every single new game, and while native performance in the likes of Total War: Warhammer 3 is pretty impressive (an 87fps average at 4K ultra), it might not always be there to boost your frame rates.\nVerdict: It's early days for Nvidia's next-gen GPU line-up, but the RTX 5080 is the class of graphics card most players should aim to get hold of. It'll pack more than enough performance to handle the latest PC games in 2025 whether you use DLSS 4 or not, and it should hold up pretty well in the future too. You will want to still try and pick up an RTX 4090 or the new RTX 5090 if you want more than 16GB VRAM, but with AI changing the foundations of PC performance, games might not need as much memory compared to previous years.\nRead more: Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 review\nPeformance | 5/5 |\nDesign | 5/5 |\nFeatures | 5/5 |\nSoftware | 5/5 |\nPrice | 3/5 |\nThe best budget graphics card\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIt's needless to say the AMD Radeon RX 7600 isn't going to win any fights with performance, but it boasts a ferociously competitive MSRP. For often less than $260 / \u00a3250, you'll be able to run all the latest games at 1080p and take advantage of team red's neat collection of FSR 3 tricks.\n\u2705 You need cheap 1080p performance: For the price, this AMD GPU will provide a reliable entry-level experience when handling new releases.\n\u2705 You want to try out FSR 3: AMD's RDNA 3 tools include driver-level Frame Generation, meaning you can technically boost fps in any PC game.\n\u2705 You want to avoid PSU dongles: The RX 7600 uses a traditional 8-pin power connector, which could make managing cables a lot easier.\n\u274c You want the best 1080p experience: This entry-level GPU isn't always able to keep up with its competition at 1080p, even though it still provides respectable results.\n\u274c Ray tracing is a must: You will be able to switch on ray tracing with this card, but it will affect performance more than with some options out there.\nFeatures: Armed with a Navi 33 RDNA 3 chip, the Radeon RX 7600 serves as AMD's cheapest graphics card this generation. That does come with some caveats, as you'll have to make do with just 8GB GDDR6 VRAM and limitations in terms of ray tracing. However, tapping into features like FSR 3 and Fluid Motion Frames can make all the difference, especially since you can use Frame Generation in every game at a driver level. That in itself comes with latency and stability caveats, but no other GPU maker has attempted a similar approach as of yet.\nDesign: The specific model we tested for out review is the Acer BiFrost RX 7600, and the card's custom blower and fan combo is pretty effective. We found that temperatures stayed chilly even when under intense load, and it's nice to see that traditional methods of GPU are still around in 2024. The GPU's shroud is pretty minimalist, but a mix of glossy and matte plastics help give it a premium vibe, despite costing less than alternatives.\nPerformance: It probably won't come as a shock to hear the RX 7600 isn't the most powerful GPU around, but there's a lot to respect considering the low cost of some models. Demanding games like Returnal managed to respectable average frame rates of 84fps at 1080p, and actually pulled off 60fps at 1440p. Admittedly, it's main rival, the RTX 4060, pulls ahead slightly in similar tests, but Nvidia's contender comes in at over $50 more depending on the model.\nVerdict: Out of every graphics card out right now, the AMD Radeon RX 7600 ultimately serves as the best budget option for well under $300. Versions like the Acer Bifrost will set you back a bit more, so that's worth weighing up while browsing. Still, this card is one to watch if you like to hold off until Black Friday, and it could end up providing an even better experience as more FSR 3 features roll out.\nRead more: AMD Radeon RX 7600 review\nPeformance | 3/5 |\nDesign | 4/5 |\nFeatures | 4/5 |\nSoftware | 5/5 |\nPrice | 5/5 |\nThe best graphics card for under $500\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGrabbing a graphics card for under $500 in 2024 isn't always easy, especially if you still want to hit 4K in the latest games. However, the AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT provides commendable specs and performance headroom while still hitting a sweet price spot, even if its ray tracing capabilities are somewhat behind its green rivals.\n\u2705 You want affordable 4K: If you're hellbent on hitting UHD resolutions while spending under $500, this card will check your boxes.\n\u2705 You willing to use FSR 3: Taking advantage of AMD's upscaling will ultimately make a difference, especially if you don't like to compromise on settings.\n\u2705 You want more VRAM: This mid-range card comes armed with 16GB VRAM, which may help put your mind at ease if you're worried about future memory-munching games.\n\u274c You want proper 4K: If you want to hit UHD in every PC game guaranteed for at least the next 12 months, you'll want to spend a lot more on a premium option.\n\u274c Ray tracing is mandatory: The 7800 XT can't pull off tremendous RT results without compromise, so it's not the best option for those of you who like fancy lighting.\nFeatures: Kitted out with a Navi 32 XT GPU and 16GB GDDR6 VRAM, this mid-range graphics card won't have an issue hitting new-release system requirements. Of course, just like the rest of the current-gen Radeon range, this card also has FSR upscaling to fall back on, and new Frame Generation tricks offer up a multitude of ways to boost fps in different scenarios.\nDesign: We specifically took Acer's Bifrost RX 7800 XT model for a test drive this time around, but this version sticks with what is a fairly standard tri-cooling solution this time around. For a card of this calibre, it's probably wise not to experiment with a blower fan, and the GPU's larger size means this approach will look more ordinary inside your rig. Subtle ridges and grill marks help add a bit of flavor to what is otherwise a vanilla looking component, but its basic design will appeal to some enthusiasts out there looking to avoid flashy parts.\nPerformance: While 4K is something high-end cards are designed for, cheaper alternatives like the RX 7800 XT prove you can achieve UHD gaming on a mid-range system. In the benchmarks, we managed to hit over 60fps in Returnal, and Hitman 3 flourished at over 130fps. More demanding releases like Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Total War: Warhammer 3 did take somewhat of a beating at higher resolutions, but switching on FSR did help keep every tested game above 60fps.\nVerdict: There are undoubtedly better graphics cards out there, but for under $500, the 7800 XT has an impressive performance punch. Naturally, graphics card prices are ever-changing, so we can't promise we won't opt for an Nvidia equivalent for better ray tracing performance in the future.\nRead more: AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT review\nPeformance | 4/5 |\nDesign | 4/5 |\nFeatures | 4/5 |\nSoftware | 5/5 |\nPrice | 4/5 |\nThe best 4k graphics card\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWe have nothing but respect for the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX, especially since it had to follow the tremendous entrance of the RTX 4090. Wisely, the red team decided to fight Nvidia on price rather than performance, and the result is a GPU that offers up an incredible 4K performance for under $1,000 / \u00a31,000.\n\u2705 You want a great value 4K GPU: AMD pretty much wins the price fight this generation with its flagship, providing better than RTX 4080 performance for less.\n\u2705 You prefer FSR 3: If you'd rather use AMD's upscaling tech, then the RX 7900 XTX will make full use of Fluid Motion Frames and other features.\n\u2705 You'd like to try out 8K: Thanks to DisplayPort 2.1, you can actually output a 8K signal using this card and try out even higher resolutions natively.\n\u274c You'd rather buy the best: While the RX 7900 XTX is AMD's flagship, it can't keep up with the RTX 4090.\n\u274c You don't play at 4K: If you've got a 1440p monitor, you might be better off opting for the even cheaper RX 7900 XT instead.\nFeatures: Kitted out with a flagship Navi 31 GPU and 24GB GDDR6 VRAM, AMD's premium contender occupies a weird middle ground. By that, we mean that while it's the company's top GPU, it's designed to take on the more reasonably priced RTX 4080, rather than punching above its weight at the RTX 4090. When it first launched, it actually lacked a way to fight Nvidia's DLSS AI tool suite, but it now has an excellent collection of FSR 3 settings and driver level Frame Generation at its disposal.\nThe latter can actually work with any game, while AMD's Fluid Motion Frames tech is making its way into more releases as the year progresses. Just like DLSS, there are caveats when it comes to latency and artificing, but we're still talking about tech that can fill in the gaps left by native performance.\nDesign: AMD cards normally feature a specific vibe, and the Radeon RX 7900 XTX is no exception. Its triple fan cooler and silver shroud won't be to everyone's tastes, but that design serves the noble purpose of keeping everything ice cold. Plus, this card's design retains a traditional set of dual 8-bit power connectors, so you won't have to wrestle with silly dongles to get everything hooked up.\nPerformance: There's a good reason that the RX 7900 XTX is our go to 4K GPU right now, and it's not just because it beats the RTX 4080 in the benchmark ring. Ultimately, it feels like AMD's flagship card is providing what we'd expect from top tier GPU of this generation, rather than showboating with enthusiast performance. UHD visuals are still going to be accompanied by high frame rates regardless, and the rat tracing experience at hand is pretty great if fancy lighting is your jam.\nVerdict: Like it or not, the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX can't take on the RTX 4090, but it can offer up a more approachable 4K experience and keep the rest of Nvidia's squad at bay. We're also excited to see how this card improves as FSR 3 matures, and adding future AI abilities into the mix could be a game changer.\nRead more: AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX review\nPeformance | 5/5 |\nDesign | 4/5 |\nFeatures | 5/5 |\nSoftware | 5/5 |\nPrice | 4/5 |\nThe best 1440p graphics card\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIn a heroic effort to provide mid-range PC gamers with better performance, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super swoops in with higher specs than the original. Better still, it's price hasn't changed, but we are slightly wary that the vanilla variant could drop to a distracting price as the year progresses.\n\u2705 You want robust QHD visuals: If you're planning on sticking with a 1440p setup, this card will keep things fresh for a few years.\n\u2705 You're keen on using DLSS: A price example of a card that excels with Nvidia's AI kit switched on, with Frame Generation providing a massive uplift.\n\u2705 You want to do some 4K gaming: The RTX 4070 Super can achieve some nice results at 4K, so long as you use DLSS and tweak settings a little.\n\u274c You'd rather buy the original: The OG RTX 4070 is still available, and price cuts could make it the better option in terms of value.\n\u274c You've got an entry-level rig: Those of you planning on jumping from n older 60-class card might be better off checking out the RTX 4060 instead.\nFeatures: We're still slightly grumpy about the fact the RTX 4070 Super comes with 12GB GDDR6X RAM. However, that's perhaps not a deal breaker since it has a higher core count and slightly faster clock speeds than the original. Those improved specs go a long way to pushing this card to a slightly higher 1440p performance standard, and the usual DLSS and Frame Generation tricks are to hand to make 4K gaming a possibility.\nDesign: We used the Zotac Trinity RTX 4070 Super for our review, and it's admittedly a chonker compared to most other mid-range models. It wields the triple fan configuration as the company's RTX 4070 Ti models, and it takes up the same amount of space as a premium GPU as a result. That's not entirely a bad thing, as the bigger shroud and extra fans result in nice low temperatures, but it could be a pain you've got a smaller case with a traditionally sized card. If you reckon that could be an issue, we'd suggest browsing for a two-fan variant instead.\nPerformance: When it comes to QHD gaming, the RTX 4070 Super has it in the bag, making short work of 1440p visuals in games like Cyberpunk 2077, Hitman 3, and Total War: Warhammer 3. Across the board, we were able to reach 100fps without any upscaling assistance, but switching DLSS and Frame Generation on will help you satiate the best gaming monitors and their speedy refresh rates. Even 4K is pretty smooth when using Nvidia's AI suite, even if there's some scaling shenanigans involved to make it happen.\nVerdict: Nvidia's refresh has effectively transformed its mid-range offering into something that's hard to beat, and the RTX 4070 Super deserves the QHD crown. If you're planning on sticking with 1440p monitors for a while, this 70-class card should stop you from thinking about upgrades for a while, provided a potential RTX 5070 doesn't rock up and change a fundamentals of mid-tier gaming.\nRead more: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super review\nPeformance | 4/5 |\nDesign | 3/5 |\nFeatures | 5/5 |\nSoftware | 5/5 |\nPrice | 3/5 |\nThe best 1080p graphics card\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nComing in at $299, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 is the cheapest of the Lovelace bunch yet. However, don't let its lower price fool you, as it's a punchy 1080p GPU that can actually handle a bit of 1440p and 4K with DLSS 3 enabled. You could say it relies on Frame Generation and fancy AI upscaling a bit too much, but the results speak for themselves when you can technically play demanding ports like Returnal without performance caveats.\n\u2705 You want top 1080p performance: The RTX 4060 is the card to beat at this price point when it comes to Full HD gaming, providing a 1080p experience without compromise.\n\u2705 You want to play older games: For under $300 / \u00a3300, you'll get a card that won't even flinch when handling older Steam games, and some will happily run at 4K.\n\u2705 You need a smaller GPU: Nvidia's entry-level card is fairly dinky, meaning it's more likely to fit in even the smallest of cases.\n\u274c You want something more futureproof: Entry-level cards tend to age faster than high-spec alternatives, and the 4060's 8GB VRAM could be an issue down the road.\n\u274c You're looking for a class upgrade: Splashing out on the RTX 4070 will feel like more of a leap for those of you with slightly older GPUs within the same class.\nFeatures: Just like the AMD Radeon RX 7600, the RTX 4060 is insistent that 8GB is enough VRAM for 1080p gaming in 2024. We wouldn't say that's entirely incorrect, but it will mean that future endeavours and ever improving textures could become an issue down the road. Nevertheless, this card provides one of the most solid entry-level experiences right now thanks to its DLSS and Frame Generation arsenal, making up for any pitfalls tied to its scaled down AD106 GPU.\nDesign: If it's a dinky GPU you're after, the RTX 4060 won't disappoint. The MSI version we checked out at launch is small enough to fit in most small cases, and the fact it uses a traditional 8-pin power connector will prevent any awkward dongle situations. In terms of looks, most models are pretty minimalist, meaning you won't have to worry about intrusive shrouds getting in the way of your tiny build plans.\nPerformance: We put the RTX 4060 through our usual benchmarks, and it managed to outpace the RTX 3060. We even ran specific RTX 4060 Cyberpunk 2077 tests and enjoyed around over 100fps at 1080p with all the ray tracing trimmings using DLSS 3. The GeForce tool even makes 4K possible on the entry-level card, as it achieved 72fps in Hitman 3, albeit with ray tracing set to one side.\nIt's worth noting that if you're looking to boost fps without picking up an RTX 4070, you'll probably want to consider the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti. However, while the souped up version offers higher 1080p frame rates, it costs $100 more, and we reckon the vanilla RTX 4060 hits more of a sweet spot.\nVerdict: Overall issues with Nvidia's RTX 4000 pricing and reluctance to offer more than 8GB RAM at entry-level, the RTX 4060 is a solid 1080p option that isn't going to disappoint. That's particularly true if you're one of the many Steam players out there still using a GTX 1660 today, as while the 2019 card is still a budget favorite, it's worth considering an entry level Lovelace model over the aging Turing card.\nRead more: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 review\nPeformance | 3/5 |\nDesign | 4/5 |\nFeatures | 5/5 |\nSoftware | 5/5 |\nPrice | 5/5 |\nThe best value graphics card\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIntel makes graphics cards? Yes! And the Arc A770 is serves as a 16GB light in a dark world filled with 8GB entry-level GPUs. Gags aside, the flagship Alchemist card actually packs more value into its shroud than most options out there, making it a solid option for players who want to make their dollars stretch.\n\u2705 You care about value: When it comes to performance per dollar, the Arc A770 provides a great array of specs and features.\n\u2705 You've got a lot of classic games: The A770 can handle new releases, but it'll excel when it comes to running your Steam backlog.\n\u2705 You want to bet on an underdog: Intel is fresh to the GPU scene, and while its venture got off to a rocky start, Arc graphics cards are getting better with every driver update.\n\u274c You want AI features: The A770 doesn't quite have any tools that can combat DLSS, and that could matter when it comes to pulling off performance tricks in new games.\n\u274c You'd rather wait for next-gen: New Battlemage Arc GPUs could blow Intel's Alchemist out of the water later this year, so waiting might be wise.\nFeatures: Intel arguably makes the best gaming CPUs around, and while AMD might have an issue with that statement, it might want to focus instead of guarding its budget GPU crown. Packing 16GB GDDR6 VRAM and a 2,400MHz boost clock, the A770 packs elevated specs for not far off the price of a RX 7600. Admittedly, Arc models haven't gained powers on par with DLSS and FSR 3 quite yet, but it's early days for the blue team's venture into graphics card land.\nDesign: Funnily enough, the Intel Arc A770 we tested shares DNA with the RX 7600 on our list, as both are Acer Bifrost models. That means that the two graphics cards use the exact same shroud and fan configuration, with that built-in blower helping provide a similar result in terms of cooling. Just like AMD's budget model, you'll also be able to hook straight up to your PSU with an 8-pin connector, and that's a big boon if you've not got much space to work with.\nPerformance: In-game benchmarks were impressive enough, but we found in testing that 4K 60fps was achievable in Returnal, Cyberpunk, and Hitman 3 if we turned the settings down a touch. With that 16GB of GDDR6, a boost clock of 2400MHz, and 19.66TFLOPs to work with, there's a lot of headroom for great gaming performance here, and for under $300, that deserves your attention. Even older games that use DirectX11 or older, which the Intel Arc's struggled to find deal with originally, are now handled with ease.\nVerdict: Acer's model is one of the pricier 16GB A770s around, but all models arguably make for the best value graphics card around considering the specs and features on offer. Now that the Intel Arc B580 is a thing, it's entirely likely it'll replace the Alchemist option here, but I'll let you know once I'e completed testing.\nRead more: Acer Predator BiFrost Intel Arc A770 OC review\nPeformance | 3/5 |\nDesign | 3/5 |\nFeatures | 4/5 |\nSoftware | 3/5 |\nPrice | 5/5 |\nHow we test graphics cards\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nAt GamesRadar, we take an encompassing approach to testing the best graphics cards with a strict set of benchmarking tools before the GPUs end up on our list. First and foremost, we use the likes of 3DMark for quantified and comparable figures in our extensive write-ups. Secondly, and arguably most importantly, we use demanding games with ray tracing enabled, if applicable, to see how the graphics cards hold up in real-world performance.\nYou can find out how we test graphics cards in our full GamesRadar Hardware Policy.\nBest graphics cards: Frequently asked questions\nGraphics card vs GPU - what's the difference?\nGraphics card and GPU are both used interchangeably, but they are two different things. The term 'graphics card' refers to the entire PC component, including its fans, VRAM, PCB, and 'Graphics Processing Unit', which means a 'GPU' is the chip living within your card of choice.\nWhat is the top gaming graphics card right now?\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is currently top of the food chain when it comes to raw graphics card power. Not only can it provide phenomenal 4K performance while maintaining triple digit frame rates, but it's also armed with DLSS AI upscaling, which should help futureproof your PC as more demanding games emerge on the scene.\nHow much does a good graphics card cost?\nGraphics card prices will vary based on the experience you're trying to achieve, and great options are available for as little as $200. Such cards will largely cater to 1080p resolutions and reduced settings, but up-spending to a GPU with more VRAM and faster clock speeds will remedy that. Just keep in mind that if you want a 4K setup with zero compromises, you'll perhaps need to pay around $1,000 for something like an RTX 4080 Super, with the RTX 4090 catering to enthusiasts willing to spend far beyond a grand.\nWhat's the minimum memory for a graphics card\nIn 2024, we wouldn't recommend using a graphics card with anything less than 6GB VRAM. While older releases will still run using less memory, you'll need more to run games at 1080p without major frame rate dips. If you'd rather not dial back settings, you'll want to make sure you go for something with at least 8GB, and you'll find that card designed for 1440p and 4K gaming will boast up to 16GB and beyond.\nLooking to pay less for a GPU?

      "text": "GamesRadar+ Verdict\nThe AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT is another strong GPU offering that performs brilliantly in 4K, and at a more affordable price than the competition. It feels like it lacks a distinct market position though, since its beefier sibling offers better performance for not much more money. Having said that, this is a top-performing GPU that shouldn't fly under your radar.\nPros\n- +\nGreat 4K performance\n- +\nMore affordable than the RTX 4080\nCons\n- -\nNvidia has superior software\n- -\nThe 7900 XTX offers better performance for only ~$150 more\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nThe AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT is another strong high-end GPU that performs brilliantly at a more affordable price than the competition. It suffers from the same (slight) weaknesses as the 7900 XTX, although with slightly less power, these are a bit more noticeable. Regardless, this is a top-drawer GPU that offers performance well within the realms of an RTX 4080 for significantly less money.\nAt an MSRP of only $899 in the US and a lowest price of \u00a3859 in the UK, the 7900 XT comes in only ~$150 cheaper than the XTX. While this is great for the folks who want one of the best graphics cards on the market at the lowest possible price, it does feel to me that the 7900 XT lacks a distinct identity. Having said that, it does successfully undercut the RTX 4080, which sits at an MSRP of $1,199, but usually ends up costing a few hundred more on both sides of the pond.\nThe RX 7900 XT will transform an average rig into one of the best gaming PCs possible if budgets simply can't be stretched. However, it's hard to imagine that someone buying a high-end GPU at this type of price couldn't, and wouldn't want to save $150 more. That makes the RX 7900 XTX a much more tempting prospect, and the 7900 XT harder to recommend.\nDesign and Features\nThe AMD Radeon RX 7900 series was designed with one thing in mind. Offering the best GPU performance imaginable for under a grand. Or, to put it another way, to undercut the price of Nvidia's flagship RTX 40 Series GPUs while not compromising on power.\nBesides weighing in a bit lighter than the RX 7900 XTX, this is essentially the same package. On the underside of the GPU, you have three fans keeping the board cool. In terms of connectivity, you have two DisplayPort bays, one HDMI, and one USB-C. I said the same with the XTX, but again, I'd have liked a second HDMI connection to play with here. It's hardly a major problem, but I think it would have been a nice touch over the competition, particularly for the budget buyers these GPUs attract, who, in all likelihood, can't afford two of the best gaming monitors on the market.\nAs standard in this generation of AMD's GPUs, you have RDNA 3 architecture, which uses the brand's chiplet knowledge to leverage more power for less money. The board runs on the AMD Radiance Display Engine, which is a big reason why DisplayPorts are favored. This feature essentially allows higher maximum refresh rates at higher resolutions.\nRDNA 3 isn't as efficient as DLSS 3, but the addition of Ray Accelerators does help to give the 7900 XT an efficiency boost in raytracing workloads. This is absolutely noticeable when we look at benchmarking tests later, but doesn't quite match up to Nvidia's latest AI deep learning tech.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nSimilarly, where Nvidia's software is the yardstick for a lot of components in the PC market, AMD's drivers are almost just as conclusive. There are handy profiles on board that allow you to fine-tune performance and settings across the board. There's AMD Super Resolution, which gives a bit more of a noticeable boost to this card than it does the XTX. All in all, I do like AMD's software, and I found it was more of a help when testing this GPU than it was with the XTX. The superior power on offer with that card meant I didn't have to rely on software and didn't feel it helping as much. That said, Nvidia's Lovelace architecture, DLSS3, superior Ray Tracing, and conclusive software do have AMD beat as an all-round package.\nWith the RX 7900 XT we have 80MB of 2nd Generation AMD Infinity Cache on a 320-bit memory bus. This is slightly less than the XTX, which has 96MB on a 384-bit memory bus. Likewise, the 7900 XT makes do with 20Gbps GDDR6 memory. This delivers 2912 GB/s of bandwidth to the XTX's 3494.4 GB/s. The 7900 XT's 20GB of memory reduces slightly from the XTX's 24GB. Compare either to the RTX 4080's 16GB though, and you see the extreme value for money come into play.\nPerformance\nThere's no way around it - the RX 7900 XT is definitely a step down compared to the 7900 XTX. It certainly isn't as powerful as the RTX 4090, which is designed for a lot more than just gaming. On the other hand, the XT still offers some staggering 4K performance with excellent frame rates. When you think of the amount of money people have paid for RTX 3080 GPUs in recent years which offer less powerful tech and similar 4K performances, it really drives home how incredible the performance-to-price ratio is in AMD's 7900 series. Make no mistake, these are some of the best value GPUs on the market, and if you're thinking of an upgrade from the 30 series, this shouldn't be written off.\nIn benchmarking tests, the RX 7900 XT performed really solidly, earning legendary scores in 3DMark, and impressively high scores in Geekbench's GPU compute tests. You can see how the 7900 XT performed in the table of results below, and compare it to the 7900 XTX's performance in the same tests.\n| Row 0 - Cell 0 | 3DMark Time Spy (GPU scores) | 3DMark Fire Strike | Geekbench OpenCL GPU Compute | Geekbench Vulkan GPU Compute |\n| AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT | 24 326 | 40 425 | 193584 | 202062 |\n| AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX | 28 011 | 40 392 | 222987 | 209630 |\nSo as you can see, these scores aren't too far off the XTX. Both GPUs were scored alongside our testing rig's Intel i7 12700-K CPU, for reference. But how does this translate to gaming in 4K at max settings? See the tables below for how both GPUs did.\n| Row 0 - Cell 0 | 4K Max Settings | Ray-Tracing | FPS |\n| Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy | \u2714 | \u2714 | 75 |\n| Metro: Exodus | \u2714 | \u2714 | 72 |\n| HUNT: Showdown | \u2714 | Row 3 - Cell 2 | 95 |\n| Apex: Legends | \u2714 | Row 4 - Cell 2 | 160 |\n| The Finals (Closed Beta) | \u2714 | \u2714 | 87 |\n| Row 0 - Cell 0 | 4K Max Settings | Ray-Tracing | FPS |\n| Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy | \u2714 | \u2714 | 120 |\n| Metro: Exodus | \u2714 | \u2714 | 96 |\n| HUNT: Showdown | \u2714 | Row 3 - Cell 2 | 120 |\n| Apex: Legends | \u2714 | Row 4 - Cell 2 | 180 |\n| The Finals (Closed Beta) | \u2714 | \u2714 | 115 |\nAlthough these 4K performances from the 7900 XT are a level below the XTX, they're still great for a GPU under a grand. Keep in mind, too, that these are 4K max settings results. At 1440p, or with slightly reduced settings, the 7900 XT will produce some really competitive frame rates. At 1440p, the XT pushed HUNT: Showdown up to 115fps, and Apex up to 210fps - more than enough for competitive players of either game.\nVisuals and lighting in all of the games I tested with this card looked stunning. These were true 4K scores and besides some more fluctuant frame rates across the board, I was really happy with how the RX 7900 XT performed in comparison to the XTX.\nShould you buy the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT?\nWriting this review has honestly felt a bit repetitive. I reviewed the 7900 XTX last week, and it had a lot of the same strengths, weaknesses, and caveats - hell, even the pictures look eerily similar. The RX 7900 XT is a great GPU that I can easily recommend. It packs a powerful performance punch and does so at the most competitive price on the market for a new-gen GPU. For that, I really do believe it needs to be applauded.\nHowever, I do feel that this GPU lacks a distinct identity - a reason to buy it over the 7900 XTX, especially seeing as that card is only around $150 pricier but offers much more stable 4K frame rates. If stock issues present themselves, then this is a great choice, but it's hard to recommend if someone's budget can stretch a little further. Either way, it's definitely one of the best value cards on the market.\nUltimately though, if you can afford to spend that little bit more, the 7900 XTX is undoubtedly the graphics card to go for.\nHow we tested the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT\nThe AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT was our testing rig's GPU for about a week, following on from our tests and review of the RX 7900 XTX. I compared the two closely for the duration of my time with it and was pleasantly surprised with how it performed.\nFor benchmarking I used 3DMark's Time Spy and Fire Strike tests, as well as Geekbench's GPU compute tests. In terms of gameplay, I put the 7900 XT through its paces by playing plenty of The Finals closed beta, and HUNT: Showdown. I also played Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, Apex Legends, and Metro Exodus to record frame rates in varying technical demands.\nFor reference, our testing rig has a Gigabyte Z690 Gaming X motherboard, PNY XLR8 DDR5 RAM, an RM1000X power supply, and an Intel i7-12700K CPU.\nTo read more about how we test the latest gaming technology at GamesRadar, take a gander at our Hardware Policy.\nWhy not go for a cheaper upgrade for your gaming PC? There are cost of living crises going on after all. Here are our lists of the best CPUs for gaming, the best SSD for gaming, and the best RAM for gaming.\nOne of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands. Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I\u2019ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension."

      "text": "The best CPU for gaming 2025: Processing power unleashed\nStay ahead of the curve with the best CPUs for gaming\nWhat is the best CPU for gaming? Great question, and just to be annoying, I'm going to say that depending on you, your gaming aspirations, and your budget, the answer will be totally unique. Sure, you can opt for the one everyone on Reddit is raving about with a million cores, a 3D V-cache, and a ridiculous max boost clock speed, but it'll set you back way more than you actually need to spend to fulfill your requirements.\nThe architecture of modern chips has come a long way, so much so that \"mid-range\" isn't what it used to be on the Intel or AMD side. That means that if you want something that will keep up with the very best gaming PCs, you don't need to look far, and even Intel's last-gen chips will likely be enough for you because of the move to DDR5 technology. The chips on the list below will do you just fine, and most importantly, won't break the bank.\nFor the vast majority of PC gamers, a 13th-generation Intel Core i5 CPU or AMD Ryzen 5 7000 CPU will do the trick these days since this category of processor has gained a lot of power in recent years. But you'll need to be doubly sure you've got the right motherboard socket for whatever CPU you go for. For example, AMD CPUs can't be used for Intel motherboards, and the same goes for the other way around. DDR5 processors won't fit on an older motherboard either, so you really need to plan these things out thoroughly to make sure you don't burn a hole in your pocket for parts you can't actually use.\nThe Quick List\nBest overall\nThe AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D will give you unparalleled performance boosts in gaming and content creation. Thanks to its 3D V-Cache technology, it's got better capacity for these tasks than any other rival on this list.\nBest for most\nYou can absolutely find better specs on this list and off of it, but the Intel Core i5-13600K packs in all the value, 4K potential, and up-to-date features most players need at a reasonable price.\nBest budget\nUsing this processor will mean you're locked to a DDR4 motherboard, but if you're building on a strict budget you'll be shocked at the solid performance this can give you in 2025.\nBest value 4K\nIf you want an up-to-date DDR5 chip that can handle gaming at 4K, you'll be shocked at the value for money AMD gives you in its 8600G processor. This trounced my expectations.\nBest for content creators\nThe best Intel CPU for content creators\nAMD has the content creation market under its thumb thanks to its fancy 3D V-cache technology, but if you've got an Intel motherboard, the 13700K is the chip we'd recommend to you.\nBest value Ryzen 7\nAMD's Ryzen 7 chips do a lot with fewer cores and threads than Intel, but the fancy 3D V-cache options aren't needed by most gamers. If you want a bit more headroom from Team Red without breaking the bank, here's your stop.\nBest Intel flagship CPU\nIntel hasn't had the best couple of years when touting its flagship processors. The 13900K was the last one that truly blew us away, and since it's cheaper than the newer models, it's what we recommend.\nBest 12 core\nFor many people, 12 cores is the sweet spot these days, and for me, this category of CPU is all about price-to-performance. Without straying into expensive AMD territory, this is the best 12-core option we've tested.\nBest budget DDR5\nAMD's Ryzen 5-8600G will outperform this chip, but Intel's 12600K is the perfect entry point into the DDR5 world, and it's frequently found on offer at the majority of retailers out there.\nI'm the resident CPU nerd here at GamesRadar+, and my ethos is to make this typically confusing component more accessible to the PC gaming masses. I've tested plenty of desktop processors in gaming, content creation, and general use, and I'm always curious to seek out the next one to see how it compares. My main goals with this page are to help you get the best value for money and to hopefully help you understand a bit more about why a certain processor might be better for you.\nMay 20, 2025: We have a new king atop the leaderboard, and it's the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D. Now, I know what you may be thinking. That chip is a few years old at this point, and you'd be correct. But thanks to AMD's excellent motherboard support, that doesn't really matter. Yes, technically, the more up-to-date Ryzen 9000X3D options will be better, but they'll also be more expensive right now, which is why I'd recommend going for the Ryzen 7 7800X3D over them. Not only is it starting to get cheaper, but it's still ludicrously good for gaming at 4K, especially when combined with an up-to-date GPU. Intel's Core i5-13600K has had a great extended run at the top of this guide for a while now, but it still holds the number two spot as the best CPU most gamers will ever really need at the moment.\nThe best CPU for gaming overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D has earned a reputation as the best gaming processor thanks to its excellent performance-enhancing 3D V-Cache and reasonable price to performance versus the Intel competition. Even as it continues to age, it's still a truly brilliant CPU to build with, and whether your rig is targetting 1440p or 4K, you're going to get excellent gaming performance thanks to this chip.\n\u2705 You want something specifically for gaming: Compared to a lot of other processors that are designed for multiple workloads and tasks, this will give you a massive boost in gaming.\n\u2705 You don't mind something a bit older: Even if it came out in 2023, this is still one of the absolute top dogs on the market, especially as it gets cheaper.\n\u2705 You're targeting 4K or 1440p: It doesn't matter what resolution you're going for with this chip, you'll get excellent performance out of it.\n\u274c You have the budget for the newer versions: The Ryzen 9000X3D processors exist, and will likely futureproof you even more.\n\u274c You aren't planning on doing lots of gaming and/or content creation: If you aren't going to be doing intensive gaming, you can save your money and get something more affordable that will still give you what you need.\nSpecs & Features: Built for the AM5 socket that's also used for the Ryzen 8000G and Ryzen 9000 families, it's a great option to install today because there's an upgrade bath lying ahead of you, with even newer Ryzen 9000X3D models offering the best performance increase (when they come down in price a bit). With a boost clock of 5GHz, the habits of most gamers and content creators are going to be satiated, although it must be said that single core performance can be increased by choosing the newer Ryzen 7 8700G, which has a slightly higher boost clock. With a base clock of 4.2GHz though, you're getting better general performance than a lot of Intel's Raptor Lake i5 competition.\nThe main draw here is going to be the 3D V-Cache, which essentially allows a larger L3 cache to store more data on the processor if it needs to access it often, and access it quickly. This means for tasks like gaming and content creation, this thing is a beast.\nPerformance: I saw inexplicable performance gains in some CPU-intensive games, like a 40fps gain in Planet Zoo compared to an even newer Ryzen 7 model. In other games and benchmarks, the wins weren't that dramatic, but they were a significant boost in performance compared to other AMD CPUs we've tested. All-round, as it continues to age, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D is still showing itself to be the best CPU to buy if you're looking for dedicated gaming processor.\nThe best CPU for most players\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Raptor Lake Intel Core i5 processor is an absolute powerhouse that should really make us question what we deem a mid-range CPU to be these days. Packed with 6 performance cores, 6 efficiency cores, and 20 threads, on paper, this is essentially a cheaper and more efficient 12th Gen i7.\n\u2705 You want 4K processing power: There's no need to overspend, this is all most players will need for gaming at 4K.\n\u2705 You want a good deal: Since this is a few generations old now, it gets discounted often, and it's easier to find a good deal on it compared to its launch price.\n\u2705 You haven't upgraded in a while: For a first DDR5 generation chip, this will surprise you. i5 processors have come a long way, and this is essentially an i9 from a few generations before it.\n\u274c You do a lot of content creation: While this is enough processing power for 4K content creation, you may benefit from the extra headroom an i7 can give you.\n\u274c You're still on a DDR4 motherboard: This will only sit in an LGA1700 motherboard, so if you've still got an older PC, this won't work.\n\u274c You don't have a need for integrated graphics: You can always save some money here and get the 13600KF model which doesn't have integrated graphics power.\nSpecs & Features: If there are any flaws to note here, it might be that there's no turbo max 3.0 - that's reserved for 13th gen i7 and i9 processors. Like the others in the Raptor Lake bunch, this CPU can be a tad more power hungry than you might like, and it can run hot under stress. Rest assured though, the i5 gives you the best all round package in these regards, and won't be nearly as extreme as an i7 or i9.\nThe 13600K has 14 cores and 20 threads, making it excellent value for money versus so many of the other contemporary processors out there. It offers more headroom than AMD processors in terms of specs, and since its getting discounts more often these days, it's becoming excellent value for money.\nPerformance: In gaming, benchmarking, and content creation, this CPU barely broke a sweat, and doing both at the same time barely used up to 15% of the CPU's capacity. That's so efficient that I thought there was something going wrong during testing, because an i5 definitely isn't expected to be this powerful.\nWhen you take price-to-performance into account, there really isn't any beating this CPU without moving to the AMD side. For a large majority of players, money shouldn't be wasted on an i7 or i9 because they simply don't need the extra architecture Intel gives them and charges more money for. An Intel Core i5-13600K is all you'll need for 4K gaming and great content creation power right now.\nThe best budget CPU for gaming\n3. AMD Ryzen 5 5600x\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe AMD Ryzen 5600X may not blow anyone away with its sheer power, especially with AMD's 7000 series on the shelves now. But as far as AM4's last-generation chipsets from the company go, it's very hard to beat in terms of price. What's more, the 5600X is frequently on sale, down from its already competitive $260 MSRP.\nThe AMD Ryzen 5600X is a solid all-around performer with both its single-core and multi-core capabilities in-game, too. It has 6 cores and 12 threads, which may not sound like much compared to the DDR5 options on this list, but that's plenty for a budget gaming PC build that's targetting 1080p. This CPU has a higher-than-average clock speed combined with its quiet-yet-cool operation over extended periods of time.\nIf you're after a processor to keep your rig under budget for now, then the 5600X continues to impress across the board all these years later.\nThe best value 4K CPU\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAMD Ryzen chips are known for their phenomenal value, and if there are any builders on a budget looking for a DDR5-compatible CPU that can handle gaming and content creation in 4K, this is the one we recommend. It's available both with and without an AI-oriented NPU, and if you opt for the version without, you get a slightly slower clock speed but pay even less money.\n\u2705 You want 4K power on a budget: 4K processors can be pricey, this one gives you so much power for the money it costs.\n\u2705 You have an AMD motherboard: If you're on a budget on the AMD side but you still want something capable, this will save you from overspending on a Ryzen 9000 option.\n\u2705 You don't plan on doing much content creation: Compared to Intel's equivalents at this price, you don't get an awful lot of content creation power here.\n\u274c You want an X3D option: AMD's best processing efforts come from its X3D V-cache options, but this isn't one of them.\n\u274c You're looking for integrated graphics: You'll probably want a bit more power, so look at the Ryzen 7 from this 8000G generation.\n\u274c You want more cores and threads: If you feel like AMD is a bit stingy with the specs they give you, maybe consider an Intel chip instead.\nSpecs & Features: Six cores and 12 threads may not seem like an awful lot for a modern-generation of processor, but such is the power and efficiency of AMD's Zen 4 architecture. You get less architecturally than you do if you opt for an Intel Core i5-13600K, but you get bang-on equivalent clock speeds and gaming performance, which is very impressive.\nPerformance: Using this CPU for our benchmark tests, I was pleasantly surprised by the results when I was gaming in 4K. Single and Multicore performance in the likes of Cinebench and Blender weren't quite as strong as in Intel's corner, which maybe speaks to how this processor is less viable for content creators. Still, if it's just some gaming in 4K you're after, this is surprisingly capable. Playing Planet Zoo, Homeworld 3, and Cities Skylines, I was able to get 4K60 out of this processor, which is very impressive for something of this price.\nThere's great value to be had here because we've seen how well supported AMD's 5000 series platform has been since 2016 (it's still seeing new additions to the lineup today), and that makes us confident that if you opt for a CPU and motherboard like this for your DDR5 machine, you'll likely get years of upgrades and support for your money.\nThe best Intel CPU for content creators\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBefore there was a Raptor Lake Refreshed Intel Core i7, there was a Raptor Lake Intel Core i7. While we're just about to start testing the 14th gen version of this processor, at this point in time, it's hard not to recommend the 13th gen model. It'll likely start to get cheaper now there's a new wave of Intel chips, and the performance it nets you is no short of ridiculous.\n\u2705 You do a lot of content creation: This is great price-to-performance if you need a little extra headroom for 4K content creation.\n\u2705 You have a great cooler: This is a pretty hot processor under strain, so make sure to invest in a decent cooling system if you buy it.\n\u2705 You play a lot of CPU-intensive games: If you like your RTS and city building games, this is the sort of processor that will get you better performance.\n\u274c You don't have an AIO cooler: Seriously, this is a hot processor, so don't try and air cool it unless you have a properly substantial airflow system.\n\u274c You don't plan to do content creation: You really don't need more than the 13600K if you just need a decent gaming processor.\n\u274c You're building the beefiest rig possible: An enthusiast-level i9 will be better for you if you have the budget.\nSpecs & Features: The 13700K has 16 cores - only two more than the i5. These are made up of 8 performance cores and 8 efficiency cores. In terms of threads running through these cores, you have 24 - four more than the i5. So the real question remains - do you actually need this extra headroom for the money? For most people, we'd still recommend the 13th Gen i5, but for content creators looking for that extra piece of mind, that extra headroom does make a difference when gaming at higher resolutions and settings.\nPerformance: For a full rundown of how benchmarking scores differ between the two, take a look at our review. For now, we'll say that if you're willing to spend that extra $100 or so, you'll get an increase in performance, but just be prepared to work harder when keeping this CPU cool. Similarly, check out the price of the latest AMD Ryzen 7, because the rival version will almost always be found cheaper.\nRegardless, this is i9 power in a chip with i7 branding. If you need extra headroom for content creation tasks like live streaming and video editing, you can't go wrong with the 13700K.\nThe best value Ryzen 7 CPU\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWhile shopping around for a CPU these days, you'll probably hear wonders about AMD's Ryzen 7 options since they offer excellent gaming and content performance for solid value prices. That much is true, but if you dip into the X3D models that are designed for ultimate gaming performance and content creation, you can actually end up spending more than you need to. For me, the Ryzen 7 8700G which can go toe-to-toe with some of those X3D products but costs less is actually a better option for most players.\n\u2705 You need integrated graphics: I wouldn't recommend sticking with integrated graphics, but if you need a holdover until your GPU arrives, this is a solid choice.\n\u2705 You want something that stays cool under pressure: Compared to the Intel Core i7-13700K, this is so much easier to keep cool.\n\u2705 You don't create content: If you want CPU power but don't need the more expensive X3D options from AMD, this is a nice alternative.\n\u274c You do need 3D V-cache features: If you are a content creator or just want to squeeze as much gaming power out of your system as possible, an X3D option is one to consider.\n\u274c You can get by with a Ryzen 5: If you don't tend to play CPU-intensive games, just stick with the Ryzen 5 8600G.\n\u274c You want the latest AMD generation: The Ryzen 9000 series is here, so that may offer you better performance.\nSpecs & Features: The only down side is that compared to the Ryzen 5 8600G, you don't get many wins on your spec sheet. In fact, your base clock speed here is slower than the Ryzen 5 from the same generation, and your L3 cache is just the same. Luckily, single core performance thanks to a higher boost clock speed is better, and you do get a big emphasis on integrated graphics, which could be useful if you're waiting for a GPU upgrade and need a holdover.\nPerformance: Fortunately, performance isn't as dicey as the spec sheet might have you think. In fact, in content creation, and especially in single core performance in Cinebench, the Ryzen 7 8700G matched the former generation's Ryzen 7 X3D model. That's really encouraging as this chip's price continues to fall. Elsewhere, 4K gaming tasks were handled with ease, and one of this processor's most impressive traits is its ability to stay cool under pressure. Each of our benchmarking games saw more stable, and higher frame rates than the Ryzen 5 8600G, although not an awful lot. If you want that extra bit of room to gallop with in content creation tasks, I'd go for this one, but the Ryzen 5 is still an excellent option for even less money.\nThe best Intel flagship CPU\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIntel's 13th Gen flagship CPU is a powerhouse that few will need, but if you're going to go for a top-of-the-range processor from the last few years, this is the sweet spot. Yes, the 14th Gen Core Ultra equivalent will likely give you better performance, but this is the one you'll get better value from in terms of price. The specs separating the latest model are few, so you really are getting the best deal with the Raptor Lake version.\n\u2705 You're building an enthusiast-grade PC: This is overkill for most gamers, so there's no need to overspend on it if you aren't trying to build a powerhouse.\n\u2705 You do heavy 4K gaming and content creation: Looking for the best results? An i9 is undoubtedly the way to go.\n\u2705 You have a high-end GPU: You won't bottleneck 4K GPUs with Ryzen 5 or i5 chips today, but if you want to get the most out of an RTX 5080 or 4090, then the 13900K is the one to go for.\n\u274c You're on a tight budget: There's no need to fork out for the most expensive options these days, you'll be surprised with how good the mid-range options are now.\n\u274c You don't play RTS games at 4K: If you don't plan on playing CPU-intensive titles at 4K, max settings, there's really not much point.\n\u274c You want something that's easy to cool: You need some decent cooling for this sort of chip, so keep that in mind.\nDesign & Specs: This i9 sports a whopping 24 cores and 32 threads, which is enough to make even the busiest of workloads weep. With that amount of headroom, there just isn't anything that'll make this CPU struggle - in gaming, content creation, or anything else you have in mind. We've seen the sorts of performances that come from the lesser i7 and i5 in the Raptor Lake wave, and they were plenty for most gamers to get by on. If our review of this flagship is anything to go by, nothing will stop you with this i9 house in your rig.\nPerformance: One of the biggest concerns we had with this chip was that it would be unruly in its temperature management. With the right AIO in your system though, we actually found very passable results. While providing the best benchmarking scores of any CPU we've tested until now, it remained below 66\u00b0C, which is very impressive for a generation of processors that are known to run hot.\nAgain, let us stress that this processor is overkill for the majority of people. For most gamers, an i5 or i7 in the 13th Generation will get you by easily. For the enthusiast, however, there's no beating this right now.\nThe best 12-core CPU for gaming\n8. Intel Core i7-12700K\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Intel Core i7-12700K was our testing rig's processor of choice for a time, and it still has a place on this list because it lies in a 12-core category and manages to stand out after all this time. 12 cores is a sweet spot for many gamers today, particularly those upgrading their rigs after a long time. AMD has a few options in this category, but they're now more expensive than the 12700K.\nWith DDR5 compatibility on the Intel side, you don't have many 12-core options to choose from, particularly because the 13th generation really upped the ante when it comes to core and threat numbers.\nWe used this processor to test some serious GPU power, including the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX, and so many RAM kits. It never failed us and offered excellent power for 4K gaming. As the price of this chip continues to drop, you're going to get loads of value from it. That said, if you can afford more, the 13th gen equivalent should be more tempting to you.\nThe best budget Intel CPU\n9. Intel Core i5-12600K\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe 12th generation Intel i5 Alder Lake processor does what people were expecting from Rocket Lake - and actually dethrones AMD Ryzen 5000 series for a competitive price-to-performance ratio that's hard to argue against.\nComparing the Intel Core i5-12600K with the less-than-well-received Intel Core i9-11900K, the 12600K actually outperforms it for a fraction of the cost. Indeed, its documented performance means it more than deserves a high spot in our roundup but misses out on that top slot for one simple reason: the 13600K is unreal.\nRegardless, one of our editors has this as their CPU of choice, and it's handled gaming and benchmarking with an RTX 4090 with absolute ease. If you like the look and feel of the 13600K but don't wanna splash out as much dough, this isn't too far behind.\nBest CPU for gaming: FAQs\nWhat CPU is best for gaming right now?\nIn our opinion, the best CPU for gaming right now is the 13th Gen Intel Core i5-13600K. On paper, it's a slightly better 12th Gen i7, but it's a lot cheaper. Don't be put off by the fact higher tier processors exist, an i5 like this is an absolute powerhouse, and it'll save you money you can put into other expensive next-gen components.\nDo you need a powerful CPU for gaming?\nThanks to modern processor architecture, you may not need as \"powerful\" a CPU as you think. Ryzen 5 and i5 chips are equivalent to the i9 CPUs from even a few years ago. While you'll still be able to play most games with a CPU that's a few years old, it can benefit you to pair your computer's brain depending on the GPU you use. Even folks with an RTX 4090 don't need an i9 to work with it. The best CPU for gaming for most people doesn't require you to spend that much these days.\nWhat CPU do pro gamers use?\nWhile we can't speak for everyone, E-Sports athletes and streamers will likely use the best of the best, highest-end components they can get their hands on to optimize everything about their performance. Particularly streaming will put a lot of strain on hardware if it's being done from the same PC that's running a game, so the most powerful CPU and GPU imaginable are necessary if content creators want their footage to look good. Most likely, we'd bet that professional gamers (the type that are draped from head to toe in RGB lighting at all times), will use 13th Gen Intel Core i9 or the most up-to-date Ryzen 9 CPUs.\nWhat is the best CPU type for gaming?\nIf you're wondering which brand does it better, that's a hard question to answer. We've rounded up the best CPUs for gaming from both Intel and AMD, and depending on your preferences, and maybe the rest of your rig, one or the other might be better suited for you individually. Intel may have the edge on popularity, but AMD has come a long way to combat that in recent years.\nFor the majority of people, a 12th Gen Intel Core i5, or an AMD Ryzen 5 or 7 will be more than enough for gaming. If you're a streamer, or someone who spends a lot of time doing multimedia production, a higher-end CPU might be advantageous.\nWhat is the strongest CPU?\nWhen it comes to the best CPU for gaming, content creation, or whatever other demanding tasks you might have for it, you're spoiled for choice these days. There's excellent value to be had with the AMD Ryzen 7000 series, especially the ones with X3D in their names, since they've been bred with unreal performance in mind. On paper, the Ryzen 9 in that family takes the cake. But the 13th Gen i9 also packs some outrageous power if you can afford it.\nHow we test the best CPUs for gaming\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nTesting CPUs for review can get fairly computer science-y, and rightly so. This is the chip that's going to process all of the things you do on your gaming PC, so we try to get a sense of how each will perform while gaming, content creating, and more general tasks. At the same time, we also want to make the numbers and results as clear to understand as possible.\nTo begin, we'll benchmark CPUs using industry-standard software like Cinebench and Blender. These emulate rendering and processing tasks for a CPU during content creation and give us a standardized way of looking at a chip's raw performance against its rivals. This will tell us a lot about its multicore and single-core performance, and we'll typically do each test three times and take a mean average as our result.\nWhile doing these tests we track temperatures, voltages, and percentage of use through monitoring software like HWiNFO, NZXT Cam, or other similar programs. Then, it's onto gaming.\nTo really test a CPU's mettle, we'll play games that are known to make them sweat. This includes RTS games and City Builders that have to simulate loads of calculations and character models at any one time. Across all our tests, you'll notice scores from Total War: Warhammer 3, Homeworld 3, and Cities: Skylines. We'll also test in other CPU-intensive games that we're playing, these could be Planet Zoo, Baldur's Gate 3, Civilization, or anything else that puts a processor under pressure.\nFor more on how we test gaming PCs and their components, check out our Hardware Policy.\nHow to choose the best CPU for you\nThe first thing to determine which CPU you should buy is what motherboard you have. It'll be locked to one type of processor and that'll seriously narrow down your shopping list between AMD and Intel. Besides that, I'd be asking some questions about how you plan to use a CPU. And it'll come down to three things.\nGaming: Do you tend to play a lot of games that put strain on a processor? These are things like RTS games and City Building sims. If you do tend to play games like that, especially at 4K with high settings, you'll probably want a more powerful processor. If you play a wide variety of genres, you can get by with a Ryzen 5 or i5 processor.\nContent creation: If you're a content creator, be it a streamer, video editor, graphic designer, or 3D artist, you'll probably need a bit more processing power than a typical user would. Again, a lot of Ryzen 5 and i5 chips can handle these tasks with ease these days, but if you want things to run as smoothly as possible, a Ryzen 7 or i7 is the one to go for.\nBudget: Lastly, budget is going to play a big role in the sorts of processors you shop for. Luckily, it's a buyer's market just now, so it doesn't take long for even the latest chips to get discounted, but your budget might decide which generation and manufacturer you go for. AMD tends to be cheaper, but Intel offers you more in terms of raw specs. i9 and Ryzen 9 options are more expensive, but Ryzen 5 and Core i5 options are more accessible.\nNow you've got one of the best chipsets available for the money, keep your rig in top tier shape with the best gaming keyboard and best gaming monitor on the market, too.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nOne of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands. Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I\u2019ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension.\n- Phil HaytonHardware Editor"

      "text": "GamesRadar+ Verdict\nAMD's latest flagship GPU is a bulldozer that successfully undercuts Nvidia and hits a home run while doing so. It isn't quite as good as the RTX 4090, but then again it isn't obnoxiously large, it's far more affordable, and gives you all the power you need to run the most demanding games. This is undoubtedly one of the best value GPUs you can buy.\nPros\n- +\nInsane performance for money\n- +\nExtremely powerful GPU\n- +\nMore affordable than the competition\n- +\nIsn't obnoxiously large\nCons\n- -\nOnly one HDMI port\n- -\nSoftware isn't as strong as the competition\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nThe AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX had a lot of pressure on its shoulders. Since AMD lagged so significantly behind in the previous generation of GPUs, the latest flagship from Nvidia's biggest competitor needed to be strong. Put simply, there was a mountain to climb for AMD to reinstate themselves to PC gamers who have spent the last two years hearing nothing but demand for Nvidia's 30 Series.\nSo AMD would have to pull out all the stops. They'd have to make one of the best graphics cards on the market that would cut straight through the noise. But pull out all the stops AMD has, and the result is everything a PC gamer would want if they're unable to afford a new 40 series GPU.\nWhere Nvidia's cards are pricey, the AMD Radeon 7000 XTX is remarkably affordable in comparison. Where the RTX 4090 is comically massive, AMD's heaviest hitter is compact and convenient.\nFor only $999 / \u00a3999, the heavyweight prospect from AMD is one of the best value GPUs money can buy, and its power is remarkable for that price. If you're looking to upgrade one of the best gaming PCs, this needs to be on your shortlist.\nDesign and features\nOne thing I love about the Radeon RX 7900 XTX is the almost escapist feeling that it gave me out of the box. When you first open the packaging, you're greeted with a stylish platform that hoists up the board. It might seem like a trivial bit of marketing design that's taken straight from the rival's playbook, but you're met with a message on the lid: \"Welcome to the red team\". To me, this makes a statement that AMD is coming out swinging, and any potential qualms a buyer might have about choosing AMD should disappear immediately in that moment.\nThe first thing I want to get out of the way is that the physical size of the 7900 XTX is so much more reasonable than you'll find with Nvidia's flagship. It's a sizeable GPU by any means, but it doesn't need a brace. It doesn't need a whole new PC case. In fact, it comes in at 287 mm x 110 mm x 51 mm and only takes up two rows in our testing PC's Corsair iCue 500T case.\nYou'll find three fans on the GPU's underside, along with some flashy RGB lighting which you can control by downloading the appropriate drivers. By way of connectivity, you have a PCI-Express 4.0 x16 interface, 2x DisplayPort 2.1 ports, 1x USB-C bay, and, somewhat disappointingly, only 1x HDMI 2.1 port. This isn't a massive issue - most modern monitors will have scope for DisplayPort or USB-C, so even if you have two monitors, you should be covered. On top of that, the majority of motherboards will have at least one HDMI port. I do still think this is a bit of a drawback though, because it lessens your options. The whole idea of undercutting the competition is to offer \"the same\" at a lower price. For folks with older monitors, this isn't ideal.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nMuch has been said about Nvidia's Lovelace architecture, but AMD's equivalent is RDNA 3, which takes what the manufacturer knows from its chiplet technology and applies it to a GPU to help keep prices down. Onboard then, we have 24GB of GDDR6 memory, as well as AMD RDNA\u2122 3 compute units, with second-generation raytracing accelerators and new AI accelerators that AMD says will \"deliver incredible performance while maximizing graphical fidelity.\" For those who want even more technical details, the 7900 XTX has a second-gen AMD Infinity Cache on a 384-bit memory bus with 20Gbps GDDR6 memory, which delivers a quoted 3494.4 GB/s of bandwidth.\nOf course, the latest and greatest graphics cards in this day and age can't survive on ingenious architecture alone. Software has become of growing importance whether for content creation, fine-tuning performance, or for AI deep-learning to improve frame rates. The software that comes along with the 7900 XTX is conclusive of all those things. I particularly like the ability to change profiles since this will help to prioritise workload if you're streaming or want the absolute best resolutions possible. Overall though, this software isn't as efficient as Nvidia's, and AMD's equivalents just can't compete with DLSS 3. This isn't a massive drawback by any means, but it's no secret that Nvidia has some out of this world software.\nPerformance\nRegardless, slightly worse software isn't enough to stop this powerhouse of a GPU to produce stunning in-game performance. For an entire grand cheaper, you're getting similar performance to an RTX 3090 Ti. In terms of current-gen reference points, that's RTX 4080 performance for around $400 less. In human terms, this is a GPU that will transform your gaming experience in 1440p and 4K.\nTo get the nitty gritty out of the way, I put the RX 7900 XTX through its benchmarking paces. First of all, running 3D Mark's Time Spy, it scored 28 011. Our testing PC houses an Intel i7-12700K CPU, and even with that being a generation behind, the overall Time Spy score was 25 419. In Graphics Test 1 there, the 7900 XTX scored 182.86 FPS, and in test 2, 160.37 FPS. Next up was 3D Mark's Fire Strike test, in which the 7900 XTX turned in a \"legendary\" score of 40 392, with a Graphics score of 71 758. In Geekbench's GPU OpenCL test, we found a score of 222987, and in the Vulkan test, a score of 209630. These tests were done without too much tinkering in AMD's software, and the results are more or less out of the box scores.\nSo all very impressive, then. But what does that mean for down-to-earth gaming? Well, testing the 4K, max/ultra settings performance of this board was quite something. Playing a few different games with varying technical demands, the results were simply stunning, and it never felt like the XTX was even breaking a sweat. In fact, the companion software told me it never pushed beyond 50% of its capabilities. I kept having to remind myself when playing a game that this is a graphics card under $1,000.\n| Row 0 - Cell 0 | 4K Max Settings | Ray-Tracing | FPS |\n| Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy | \u2714 | \u2714 | 120 |\n| Metro: Exodus | \u2714 | \u2714 | 96 |\n| HUNT: Showdown | \u2714 | Row 3 - Cell 2 | 120 |\n| Apex: Legends | \u2714 | Row 4 - Cell 2 | 180 |\nAs you'll see, these results speak for themselves. The Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy frame rate was quite something - especially with ray tracing turned all the way up. Moreover, that frame rate was rock solid, and didn't fluctuate in the slightest. Metro, on the other hand, did fluctuate a bit more, with peaks being just above 100FPS and lows never dipping below 90.\nWith HUNT and Apex, two games that I chose to benchmark more as competitive multiplayer reference points where the majority of players are just looking for the maximum frame rates possible, the results were fantastic. Once again, the frame rate in Hunt was rock solid, and of the two, that's much more technically demanding. Using different profiles in the AMD software, it was possible to tweak these performances as well. It was in Esports mode, however, that I got the best scores. Testing these both out in 1440p, I found that Apex leaped to a ridiculous 250FPS, while Hunt leapt up to 150.\nDon't forget, these were running with every single possible setting maxed out. This GPU transforms games into how they should be played, and it does it at one of the most affordable prices out there.\nOverall - should you buy the Radeon RX 7900 XTX?\nAbsolutely. Yes, you should.\nDon't get me wrong, the RTX 4090 is still a superior GPU, but it's always worth keeping in mind that that was a graphics card designed for much more intensive tasks than playing games. If you are desperate for a new GPU and you want the absolute best performance, the 4090 will offer you more. But if price is a barrier to entry, which I wouldn't be surprised at, the RX 7900 XTX has taken the gloves off and come out swinging.\nFor under a grand (or slightly over when you get to any given retailer), this GPU is pushing boundaries of what is possible. Yes, there are added bonuses to getting an Nvidia 40 Series GPU that has superior software, more technically astounding ray-tracing, and DLSS 3. The thing is, this GPU performs so strongly that you won't really miss those Nvidia benefits.\nIn the current financial climate of high costs of living, record high inflation, and energy bills that will make you want to vomit, AMD has a champion on its hands.\nHow we tested the RX 7900 XTX\nThe AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX was our testing rig's GPU for about two weeks before this review. In that time I put it through its paces by playing plenty of HUNT: Showdown, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, Apex Legends, and Metro Exodus. I also used the companion software top fine tune and control the performance of each game, testing how these things affected in-game performance.\nFor technical benchmarking tests, I ran it through various 3DMark simulations, as well as Geekbench 6.0.\nFor reference, our testing rig's configuration for this review was as follows: Intel i7-12700K, AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX, PNY XLR8 DDR5 RAM, PNY SSD, RM1000X power supply, and a Gigabyte Z690 Gaming X motherboard.\nTo read more about how we test the latest gaming tech at GamesRadar, take a gander at our Hardware policy.\nThinking about some cheaper upgrades for your gaming PC? Why not look at the best CPUs for gaming, the best SSD for gaming, or the best RAM for gaming?\nOne of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands. Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I\u2019ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension."

AMD have stepped up.\nI wanted to upgrade my RTX 3070 and was thoroughly unimpressed with the Nvidia 50 series launch. After seeing such glowing reviews for the 9070 & 9070XT I decided to give AMD a try. Initially I was apprehensive as there's been some talk of AMD's drivers not being as good as Nvidia's. Such talk seems overblown and has not been my experience at all, albeit after only 8hrs use. Nvidia's drivers have not been up to their usual high standards recently and so it's a very good time to consider a change.\nI bought this Sapphire Pulse 9070 16GB for \u00a3560 direct through Amazon and overall I'm very pleased with my purchase. The 9070XT starts at ~\u00a3100 more, which is a tempting upsell. With this in mind I would not pay much more than the \u00a3560 I paid, but when you consider it's only ~10% more expensive than a 5070 yet with 50% more VRAM, it's solid value.\nI'm getting around 50% extra FPS in 1440p gaming. It runs around 10-20\u00b0C cooler in my microATX case, and is considerably quieter my old 3070. It's almost exactly the same size as my old EVGA 3070, which was an important factor for my smaller case. Sapphire are widely regarded as one of (if not the) best AMD GPU manufacturers, which was important for me after the loss of EVGA (RIP).\ntl;dr: A great value GPU in a volatile market.

      "text": "Best SSD for gaming 2025: The best performing drives for your PC\nSay goodbye to loading screens with the best SSDs for gaming\nPicking up one of the best SSDs for gaming can be more than enough to give your gaming PC the boost it needs. A new GPU might be alluring, but they can be pretty pricy, and adding new RAM and processors into the mix can require a whole new motherboard and drive up your budget and frustrations even further. Modern SSDs can be more affordable and, most importantly, easier to install, and give you the performance upgrade you\u2019re looking for without breaking the bank.\nGen 5 PCIe SSDs are here now too, so if NVMe speeds seemed ludicrous already, hold on to your hats. Annoyingly, the support for Gen 5 drives isn't quite here yet, so for the majority of users, we'd still recommend Gen 4. Through all of our testing, the best Gen 4 drive in our eyes is the Samsung 990 Pro. This M.2 SSD offers up the best in performance for PS5 and PC and increases peak read speeds compared with the old 980 Pro from 7,000MB/s to 7,450MB/s. But, there are other types of drives out there, from external drives, SATAs, and more NVMe drives.\nGen 4 M.2 NVMe SSDs are the ones you should set your sights on because even if SATAs are cheaper, the extra performance will make a huge difference to you. SATA's are also a total faff to install, whereas NVMe slot right into place on your motherboard. As we advise for buying one of the best SSDs for PS5 - just make sure you have a heatsink at the ready.\nThe Quick List\nBest overall\nIn terms of pure speed this side of the Gen 5 barrier, Samsung's 990 Pro takes the cake. Now available in up to 4TB capacity, this thing is a monster of the storage world.\nBest no-fuss\nThere's not much that separates some of the top-drawer Gen 4 drives, but the WD Black SN850X makes things easy with all-around brilliance.\nBest budget\nYou might not recognize the T-Force A440 Lite name, but this 2TB M2 drive manages to keep costs low while still providing speeds that get the job done, and an impressive thermal performance to boot.\nBest Gen 5 SSD\nIf it's a swanky new Gen 5 SSD you're on the hunt for, we can recommend the Crucial T700 Pro. It has exceptionally fast speeds, although is fairly pricey.\nBest for PS5\nThis is another trailblazer of the Gen 4 SSD world, and it's our favorite SSD to use with Sony's flagship console. Even in a gaming PC, this is one of the best.\nBest value SSD\nThe Samsung 980 Pro is still one of the best SSDs you can get, and thanks to the 990 Pro being out, you can now find it a bit cheaper. For the money, don't miss this.\nBest SATA SSD\nIf it's a SATA you need, this is the one we'd recommend. Although in all honesty, NVMe drives are much better performers and aren't too expensive.\nBest Value 4TB\nThe WD Blue SN5000 4TB is an SSD designed with content creators in mind that still packs on the fast speeds without breaking the bank - making it the best value 4TB SSD going right now.\nRead more below.\nAs a gaming tech writer, and gaming fan, who's used to sticking to a budget, I'm a huge advocate for making use of what you got. One of the best ways to do that with your gaming tech is by picking up one of the best SSDs to give your hardware a well-needed speed, and storage boost, without the need to buy a whole new device in the process. If you're of the same mindset, you've come to the right place.\nMay 27 - For this update, I swapped the Nextorage NEM-PA Series for the T-Force A440 Lite 2TB SSD, which was reviewed by freelancer Alex Berry. The T-Force A440 Lite SSD was able to keep up with everything that was thrown its way, despite its more affordable $130 / \u00a3125 price tag for a 2TB model, and even had a \" very impressive\" thermal performance to boot.\nAdditionally, I also added a 'Coming Soon' section to this guide, so you can keep up with new SSD launches and what drives we currently have on the testing bench.\nApril 29 - Currently, I'm testing the WD Black SN7100 1TB SSD, which could qualify for a place on this list. For now, our top picks of the best SSDs for gaming remains the same, however, for this update I overhauled the FAQ at the bottom of the list and added 'buy it if' and 'don't buy it if' pros and cons for each drive, to make it easier to see at a glance, what SSD might be the right fit for your gaming needs.\nThe best SSD for gaming overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705Up to 4TB is enough: The Samsung 990 Pro is available with a storage capacity up to 4TB, which should be enough for your game installs, updates, and a ton of other media.\n\u2705 You want some of the fastest Gen 4 speeds: Through our testing, the 2TB 990 Pro reached 7,462MB/s reads and 6,877MB/s writes speeds, which is some of the best where Gen 4 drives are concerned.\n\u274c Not all areas of performance are created equal: The Samsung 990 Pro struggles a bit when it comes to single-queue-depth 4K random access performance, which won't give you that noticeable game performance you may be expecting.\nThe Samsung 990 Pro is the latest Gen 4 M.2 SSD from the brand and offers some top-contender performance for PS5 and PC. Like the SN850 and SN850X, it stayed off our recommendation lists for some time after launch because the 980's performance-price trade-off meant the older model was actually better value. That's started to change now though, and we're seeing the 990 get discounted further, and more regularly.\nSpeaking of the SN850X, this is an excellent competitor to it. The 990 Pro 2TB knocked out 7,462MB/s reads and 6,877MB/s writes in our tests, which is as good as it gets for a Gen 4 drive. In terms of pure speed, this is the best SSD we've tested. Drives like this are now very clearly bumping up against the limitations of the PCIe Gen 4 interface, and Samsung is right up there with the best.\nLike anything, the 990 Pro isn't perfect. We found that its single-queue-depth 4K random access performance was just a touch disappointing. The 80MB/s reads and 231MB/s writes are hardly bad by any means, but they don\u2019t move the game on, which is what we\u2019d been hoping for in a drive like this. When it comes to thermal performance, the 990 Pro tops out at 59 degrees C compared to the 980's 53 degrees.\nOverall, this is one of the best SSDs for gaming you'll find.\nSpeed | 5/5 |\nHeatsink efficiency | 4/5 |\nValue | 4/5 |\nDiscount likelihood | 3/5 |\nThe best no-fuss SSD for gaming\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 Ideal for PS5 players: This SSD comes with a full-length heat spreader, and new thermal management, which can help keep the overheating in your Sony console at bay.\n\u2705 Designed with PS5 in mind: If you're new to SSDs and feel safer using one designed specifically with the Sony console in mind, the WD SN850X is a top choice.\n\u274c You already own the WB Black SN850: The 4K performance and random speeds of previous models like the SN850 are better than that of the SN850X, so making the upgrade, other than for a larger storage capacity, may not be entirely worth the effort.\nThe WD Black SN850X may be one of the purest performing Gen 4 SSDs on the market, but when you take speeds, price, and versatility into account, the SN850X is a solid all-rounder. Not only did it surpass its predecessor, the SN850, but its strong availability, size options, and heatsink make things very easy for shoppers.\nIn all honesty, you won't find too many disparities between the SN850X and the SN850 in terms of performance. The SN850X improves upon the sequential read and write speeds we loved from the older model, and even runs cooler thanks to the integrated heatsink. This was a big problem with the SN850, as it tended to run pretty hot under pressure. The SN850X does a great job of dealing with that though, because WD says it's implemented a new thermal management profile that reduces performance throttling when it's working particularly hard.\nOne slight disappointment is that the 4K performance and random speeds underperformed compared to the older model in our tests. Regardless, the SN850X is one of the strongest all-rounders you'll find on the market, regardless of the platform you play on.\n- Read more: WD Black SN850X review\nSpeed | 5/5 |\nHeatsink efficiency | 4/5 |\nValue | 4/5 |\nDiscount likelihood | 3/5 |\nThe best budget SSDs for gaming\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want more storage at a budget: Typically, the higher the storage capacity, the more costly it gets, but even the 2TB model T-Force A440 Lite SSD is reasonably priced.\n\u2705 You want an SSD that keeps its cool: During our testing, the Teamgroup TForce A440 Lite only reported a temperature over 40 degrees Celsius once and impressed us with its thermal performance power.\n\u274c Design is bare bones: Once your SSD is integrated into your PC, you don't really see it anyway, but the Teamgroup T-Force A440 Lite has a pretty typical M.2 drive design.\nTeamgroup is not new to the SSD market by any means, and currently has 35 different M.2 solid state drive options available to choose from today. However, the TForce A440 Lite is an ideal pick for those who want more storage for their buck, without dealing with the extortionate costs typically found with drives 2TB and up.\nThe Teamgroup T-Force A440 Lite is available in three different capacities, 512GB, 1TB and the 2TB. The later is the largest model available and was reviewed by our freelancer Alex Berry, where it promised the best performance on paper with up to 7,400 MB/s sequential read and up to 6,400 MB/s sequential write speeds.\nDuring performance testing, it didn't quite make hit the mark, with CrystalDiskMark revealing average read speeds of around 7,050MB/s and average write speeds just under 6,200 MB/s. That being said, it was still able to transfer the hefty 72GB game Avowed through the Xbox app and to a Samsung 980 in just under two minutes. Game loading speeds are also notably fast with this drive, with Berry being able to able reach the main menu of Avowed in 7.8 seconds, while it took a whole .2 seconds longer on the Samsung 980 SSD.\nWhat is the shining start of this drive, however, is its cost. The 2TB version has an MSRP of $130 / \u00a3125, and it can even be found cheaper during big sales events. While you will need a compatible heatsink to pop this into your PS5 console, for PC, this makes it one of the best options for those want to extra storage, and aren't too fussed about reaching the fastest speeds on the market. Even better, despite it's cheap cost it offers up a premium thermal performance too. During Berry's testing process, which involved running games on the drive, transferring data and running benchmark tests, the SSD only once reported a temperature over 40 degrees Celsius, with idle temperatures typically sitting at 28\u00b0 with a rise to around 38\u00b0 during heavy testing scenarios.\nRead more: T-Force A440 Lite 2TB review\nThe best Gen 5 SSD\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want more storage options: The Crucial T700 Pr is available in models up to 4TB, so you are limited in how big you go with this drive.\n\u2705 You want to see what Gen 5 drives have to offer: Gen 5 SSDs are still relatively new, so the most noticeable upgrades they can give to your PC gaming won't as obvious for a while, but it can help further futureproof your rig.\n\u274c Your motherboard needs an upgrade: With Gen 5 drives still being relatively new, not all PC motherboards will have a relevant slot so make sure your PC is equipped being you grab one.\nThe Crucial T700 Pro is, by a long way, the fastest SSD we've tested. Using the new Gen 5 PCIe interface, it trounces the typical read/write speeds we know of other gaming SSDs on this list. Unfortunately, its real world applications to harness those speeds are few and far between at the moment, and we likely won't see them become widespread for a while.\nIn terms of design, and availability, the T700 Pro comes in 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB shapes, all with or without a chunky copper-aluminium heatsink on its top. Remember, you will need a compatible motherboard and NVMe slot to make use of its blazing fast new-gen interface, which could be a problem for many slowly ageing motherboards.\nThe T700 features Microsoft DirectStorage compatibility, which is sure to futureproof it if more games begin to support it. Besides this, DirectStorage is said to lessen CPU and GPU loads when multitasking. Powering things is Micron's homemade 232-layer TLC NAND, which helps the drive to reach ludicrous speeds.\nI found that this drive performed marvellously in benchmarking. It almost tapped out its advertised \"up to\" speeds by achieving sequential read/write speeds of 12,379/11,517MB/s. While that goes above and beyond the estimated 1GB/s Gen 5 drives were estimated to reach in their initial outings, it is no less than a feat of engineering on Micron's part.\nAnnoyingly, those raw speeds didn't translate to any difference in gaming performance compared to a Seagate FireCuda 530. While the futureproofing and sheer technical capabilities of this drive are second-to-none, it's unlikely you'll see any true benefits of having one for gaming for quite some time to come. The software and application support is lacking currently.\nRegardless, if you are trying to find the absolute best of the best, this is where you stop on our list. If you can afford those pricey Gen 5 price tags, don't hesitate.\nSpeed | 5/5 |\nHeatsink efficiency | 4/5 |\nValue | 4/5 |\nDiscount likelihood | 3/5 |\nThe best SSD for PS5\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nEditor's note: Seagate has an officially licensed Star Wars version of the Firecuda 530 for PC. These cleverly designed drives have heatsinks and swappable faceplates with RGB lighting that, when powered up, look like the ignited lightsabers of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke Skywalker, and Darth Vader.\n\u2705 4TB is enough for your PS5: Even with PS Plus's game library getting bigger each month, 4TB should be enough to keep them all stored on your precious Sony console.\n\u2705 If you want a drive powered by the Phison E18 controller chip: The Firecuda 530 shares the same chip as some of the fastest drives out there.\n\u274c You have a budget to stick to: The Firecuda 530 is a bit on the pricey side, which is to be expected when it comes to Phison E18 controller chip-powered SSDs.\nSeagate is one of the biggest names in storage and the Seagate Firecuda 530 2TB is absolutely up there with the big boys. This is partly due to the use of its excellent Phison E18 controller.\nWe found in our testing that the Firecuda 530 2TB lived up to the claimed figures of 7,300 MB/s and 6,900 MB/s read, making this drive one of the faster Phison E18-based SSDs around. We clocked just over 7GB/s and just shy of the 6.9GB/s read figures.\nThe random performance of the Firecuda 530 2TB isn't quite as strong as its sequential offerings, though. Simply put, this drive offers good rates but doesn't quite excel in the same fashion as other Phison E18 units. We clocked 83 MB/s 4K reads and 251 MB/s writes, which still offers a great experience, however, doesn't quite hit that 300 MB/s figure that the WD Black SN850 can.\nIf you can say all that of most drives based on the Phison E18 controller, the Firecuda\u2019s epic 2,550TB write endurance rating is something really exceptional. It\u2019s also worth noting that this drive is fully compatible with the Sony PS5 and is optionally available with a PS5-optimised heatsink. All told, it\u2019s one heck of an SSD that also happens to be one of our favourite PS5 SSDs.\n- Read more: Seagate FireCuda 530 review\nSpeed | 5/5 |\nSpeed | 4/5 |\nValue | 4/5 |\nDiscount likelihood | 2/5 |\nThe best value SSD\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 Affordability is key: The Samsung 980 Pro, if you can still spot it in stock, is affordable regardless, but its non-heatsink model can go as low at $60, which is perfect for those with a budget to stick to.\n\u2705You still want fast speeds: The Samsung 980 Pro can reach speeds well over the 7,000MB/s mark, so while it can cheap out in price, it doesn't cheap out on performance.\n\u274cYou want a more modern SSD: Since the launch of the Samsung 980 Pro, there's been newer drives from the brand which offer up more storage options and better performance.\nThe Samsung 980 Pro is still one of the best SSDs for gaming on the market, especially considering that the heatsink model is now widely available, and frequently discounted, too. We've been spotting the non-heatsink model down as near as $60/\u00a360, and if you can get it that cheap, please do.\nWhile this drive may no longer be the absolute fastest Gen 4.0 unit that you can slot into your system, the overall stellar sequential rates of up to 7,000 MB/s read cannot be denied.\nGen 4 drives running the likes of the Phison E18 controller are going to offer more consistent, and faster overall random performance, and the Samsung 980 Pro matches the PS5's internal storage with ease and is usually available substantially cheaper than newer drives on the market. The addition of a dedicated heatsink custom-made for the system is going to be ideal for anyone preferring the plug-and-play approach as opposed to having to go all DIY, too.\nIt's still one of the fastest drives going, offering speeds that can surpass the 7,000MB/s mark.\nRead more: Samsung 980 PRO Review\nSpeed | 4/5 |\nSpeed | 4/5 |\nValue | 3/5 |\nDiscount likelihood | 5/5 |\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Kingston Fury Renegade impresses across the board as one of the best SSDs for gaming on the market right now. With its stated speeds reaching upwards of 7,000 MBS, we're happy to report that this drive really is the real deal when it comes to blazing-fast performance perfect for DirectStorage.\nOur benchmarks don't lie, and neither did Kingston. The Fury Renegade achieved read and write speeds of 7,344.99MB/s and 6,873.21MB/s respectively through CrystalDiskMark, and a stellar Anvil score of 21,649.35 for some seriously impressive performance. Of course, raw numbers mean nothing if the in-game performance can't back it up. Fortunately, loading and transfer times were as close to instant as you would hope for from a drive of this caliber.\nBriefing touching on transfer times, we noted that CyberPunk2077, a 64.88GB game, took only 22.66 seconds being written from one NVMe drive to the Kingston. It's a similar story with Destiny 2, and its 73.5GB of content, which made the jump between drives in just 28 seconds. Loading times were all but non-existent as well, as we were able to jump into Halo Infinite's main campaign in a mere 18 seconds - straight into gameplay.\n- Read more: Kingston Fury Renegade SSD review\nSpeed | 3/5 |\nHeatsink efficiency | 3/5 |\nValue | 3/5 |\nDiscount likelihood | 4/5 |\nThe best SATA SSD for gaming\n7. Crucial MX500\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're limited on M.2 slots: If you need some extra storage to backup your games, or important files, but your motherboard is limited on M.2 slots, a SATA-type can come in handy.\n\u2705 You want extra storage for cheap: SATA drives are low cost, so they can help if you need more storage but don't have a lot of cash to spare.\n\u274c You have the space for a M.2 NVMe SSD: If your motherboard has plenty of M.2 NVMe slots available, you're better off slotting in a Gen 4 (or Gen 5) drive instead, to get those fast speeds and better futureproof your rig.\nSATA-type drives are the oldest form of SSDs on the market. And while they can't quite compare against the M.2 form storage devices, they're sometimes still required when it comes to extra storage because not all motherboards have space for more than one M.2 drive.\nThe good news is, nowadays, they are remarkably cheap. I would issue the caveat though that these aren't all that much cheaper than NVMe SSDs now, with prices being what they are. And most of the time, you can have multiple SATA drives in your PC, provided you have the cables and setup, and for a bargain price. These drives can really shine as great backup drives for games and storing files and the Crucial MX500 is the best of the lot, so you can't go far wrong. Especially since it costs considerably less than other SATA SSD models at just $50 or \u00a340 for 250GB, or around $225/\u00a3200 for a 2TB bad boy.\nOn the benchmarking front, the Crucial MX500 doesn't 'impress' much compared to the other SSDs in this guide, but as explained above, that's due to the SATA connection - everything is relative, after all. In the sequential 1MB test, it provides 561 MB/s read and 468 MB/s write \u2013 almost identical to the 4MB test with 524 MB/s and 482 MB/s respectively.\nIf you're looking for a main SSD, then, budget-dependent, one of the above SSDs are likely your best bet, but if you're looking for a secondary drive, or are building a budget rig, then the Crucial MX500 is certainly one of the best of the rest. I currently use it for all the games I can't fit on my other drives and while the loading speeds aren't quite the same, it's still far better and faster than any HDD would be (and most other SATA SSDs, for that matter).\nSpeed | 2/5 |\nHeatsink efficiency | N/A |\nValue | 1/5 |\nDiscount likelihood | 5/5 |\nThe Best Value 4TB SSD\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're a content creator: The WD Blue SN5000 4TB was designed with content creators in mind, so if you prioritize your creative endeavours over gaming, this is the drive for you.\n\u2705 You could actually use 4TB: Not everyone actually needs that much space, but if you move around a lot of media, as well as need plenty of space for your games, this is an ideal pick up.\n\u274c You want a SSD for your PS5: The WD Blue SN5000 4TB is designed to be used with a PC, and can't have a heatsink popped on top, so PS5 players should give this a miss.\nThe WD Blue SN5000 4TB is one of the first SSDs designed for content creators and professionals that's actually impressed us from a gaming standpoint. Most of these don't have speeds fast enough to really be worth it against the more affordable gaming drives, but the SN5000 4TB changes that. In fact, this may well be the best value 4TB drive going right now.\nDesign & Features: Unlike all the other NVMe, PCIe 4 SSDs on this list, the Blue SN5000 can't be bought with an integrated heatsink bolted to its top. This is a drive designed to be in a gaming PC, under the hood of a motherboard's heatsink. There's very little to be said for its design, and even its features seem pretty barebones compared to many of the gaming-designed options elsewhere on this list. It is available in 500GB, 1TB, and 2TB models as well, but the 4TB model is the one we'd recommend for its reasonable price and increased performance. You'll get Gen 4 compatibility, WD's nCache 4.0 tech, as well as a five-year warranty and an endurance of 1,200TBW. The advertised sequential read/write speeds are 5,500MB/s/5,000MB/s respectively.\nPerformance: In testing, I actually found that this drive was capable of even greater speeds than its box had claimed. A read speed of 5,524MB/s is pretty impressive for a 4TB SSD of this price and is more than quick enough for gamers to feel they're keeping up with this generation's non-existent loading times. In terms of writes, content creators are catered to with 5,055MB/s. This will make file transfers and installations nice and zippy. In gaming and general use, this was a really efficient storage device that's well worth buying compared to pricey 4TB drives geared toward gaming specifically. There aren't many content creation SSDs we'd recommend for gamers, and there aren't many 4TB options we'd suggest you buy instead of smaller 2TB ones as and when you need them. But the WD Blue SN5000 has both of those categories held down, and it's well worth considering if you need this much space.\nSpeed | 3/5 |\nHeatsink efficiency | N/A |\nDiscount likelihood | 4/5 |\nThe best SSDS for gaming coming soon\nBest Gaming SSDs: With Gen 5 SSDs releasing left, right, and center in 2025, there's plenty of SSD releases inbound. Most recently, Sandisk simultaneously announced and launched its first PCIe Gen 5.0 SSD under the WD Black banner, the WD Black SN8100. This compact drive is designed with \"hardcore PC gamers\" in mind, who are looking to future-proof their PC gaming rig with read and write speeds of up to 14,900MB/s1 and 14,000MB/s.\nUpcoming SSD reviews: Currently, I'm testing the 1TB WD Black SN7100 SSD, which boasts read and write speeds of 7250MB/s and 6900MB/s. The latest WD Black drive states it has a \"35% performance boost over\" the previous model and is designed with power efficiency and performance in mind. This SSD doesn't yet have a heatsink model, so while it could be used with the PS5 with the right heatsink, it will be tested primarily for PC platforms.\nBest SSD for gaming: FAQ\nIs SSD recommended for gaming?\nWith PC games continuing to become more demanding in terms of bandwidth and file sizes, SSDs are the way to go to minimize loading times and have faster boot-up speeds. A Gen 4.0 SSD especially is fast enough to load in HD textures and the larger game worlds that modern titles utilize in a flash. Like we mentioned earlier, when compared to HDDs, the read and write speeds aren't even close or remotely comparable.\nIs NVMe or SSD better for gaming?\nWe'd argue that the best SSDs for gaming are NVMe (non-volatile memory express) is the one to buy if you're looking to get the fastest load times and best performance in PC games. These types of drive are faster than SATA SSDs, but are another form of solid state drive that offer even better performance and take up much less space.\nWhat is a good SSD speed for gaming?\nWhile there's no hard and fast rule as to the quickness of an SSD, we would strongly recommend a minimum of a Gen 3.0 drive in your gaming PC as it has rates of up to 3,500 MB/s read and write respectively. However, should you want the best of the best, then we're seeing sequential performance exceeding 7,000 MB/s from flagship Gen 4.0 drives at the moment. Our advice is to go with the fastest drive that your budget allows, but ideally, you'll want to go NVMe over the slower SATA and HDD models online.\nWhat is a good size for a gaming SSD?\nAs games continue to get larger, we generally recommend either a 1TB or 2TB model over anything smaller in the NVMe form factor. This is to give you enough headroom to load up titles from your virtual game libraries (such as Steam, Epic, or Origin) without having to constantly make room for new releases. Also, 1TB / 2TB drives tend to run slightly faster than their smaller siblings in the same product line.\nWhat brand of SSD is best for gaming?\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nFrom the list above, three brands stand out to us as the go-to SSD manufacturers. Seagate, Samsung, and Western Digital.\nWD (which owns SanDisk, if you didn't know), was founded back in 1986 and is now one of the most trusted names in all of storage. Their WD Black products in both SSD and HDD are stellar, and their popularity speaks for them.\nSeagate, which is perhaps more of a household name than WD, has always been at the peak of the storage mountain. Their FireCuda 530 was the first SSD confirmed for the PS5, and it's easy to see why.\nOther brands like Samsung, Corsair, and Crucial, make more than just storage devices, but they all make serious contenders in the SSD game.\nWith that in mind, we stand by what we said earlier on in our list. You don't have to go to big brand names to find exceptional read and write speeds. When it comes to SSD, you can trust the technology.\nHow we test SSDs for gaming\nTesting SSDs inside a PC is all about official benchmarking, and then putting the numbers into context in the form of loading times.\nWe'll slot an SSD into one of our testing PCs and after formatting and adding the necessary partitions that Windows requires, we'll run it through its paces in three different CrystalDiskMark benchmarking tests. This is industry-standard software for testing storage drives. Although it gives us numbers on IOPs and 4K random performance, we're all about keeping things simple for you, so while we'll add notes about these readings if they're of concern, we're mainly going to tell you about an SSD's sequential read and write performance.\nAfter performing three tests, we'll take a mean average of either, and report them back in our coverage. After that, we'll check the motherboard sensor's temperature reading if there's an attached heatsink to see how it's controlling the drive's heat level. Then, to make these numbers actually mean something in a practical sense, we'll play some games.\nWe usually try to take some games that have differing loading speeds typically. We'll take a game that loads fast and maybe has support for WindowsDirectStorage, like Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart. We'll also take a game that loads slower, usually Grand Theft Auto V, and a game with middling loading times. We'll perform a stopwatch loading test, which may not be the most accurate, but it isn't supposed to be. Each drive and motherboard you put one into will come back with different results, we just want to give you an idea of how the ones we're reviewing are going to help you in loading times should you buy it.\nOf course, we'll also look at the design, features, and architecture of a drive and sum it up in our verdict. How does the price reflect its performance? Were the advertised speeds on the box met, or did an SSD come up short? We'll ask these questions before coming to a final review score.\nFor more on how we test SSDs and hard drives here at GamesRadar+, check out our hardware policy.\nIf your rig is already decked out with the fastest drives, check out the best gaming chairs, best gaming desks, best computer speakers, and best gaming monitors guides to help unlock the full potential of your PC gaming setup.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nEver since I first held a NES controller in my hand I've been obsessed with gaming, and the hardware it runs on. I could hook up a NES and SNES to a telly, without instructions, before I could walk. Even now, nothing is more exciting then taking a console, or handheld, out the box for the first time and setting it up. This obsession transformed into a love of games and game music, which lead to my music degree and dream of becoming the Scottish Nobuo Uematsu. After sharing my love of games through music, I began to share my love through words on sites like TechRadar and iMore. This lead to becoming a Hardware staff writer for PCGamesN, and later the Senior Tech Writer for Dexerto, covering all things Steam Deck, PlayStation and Nintendo. With that experience, I was able to level up as Hardware Editor for GamesRadar+, where I'm still just as Nintendo, PlayStation and gaming tech obsessed as ever.\n- Jeremy Laird\n- Duncan RobertsonHardware Editor"

      "text": "GamesRadar+ Verdict\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is capable of hitting frame rates that aren\u2019t too far off its RTX 5080 sibling for $200 less. However, actually grabbing one for $749 / \u00a3729 could be a struggle depending on availability, and since custom models like the Gigabyte Gaming OC come within touching distance of 80-class pricing, I\u2019d recommend either waiting for the RTX 5070 or opting for a base RTX 5080 if you can\u2019t grab a 5070 Ti at MSRP.\nPros\n- +\nCheaper MSRP than RTX 4070 Ti\n- +\n4K performance not far off RTX 5080\n- +\nGreat DLSS 4 boost\n- +\nGigabyte\u2019s model runs extremely cool\nCons\n- -\nCustom cards like Gigabyte Gaming OC are expensive\n- -\nLarger than the RTX 5080 Founders Edition\n- -\nNot revolutionary compared to RTX 4070 Ti\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nIf I had my way, I wouldn\u2019t be talking about the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti right now. It\u2019d make far more sense to look at the \u201cvanilla\u201d RTX 5070 and see what it offers the mid-range scene before checking out what its souped-up sibling offers for $200 more. But, since the green team is going with a top-down release schedule again this generation, I can only speak for how the latest 70-class card compares to its beefier RTX 5080 counterpart, and the gaps aren\u2019t too upsetting.\nNvidia has the RTX 5070 Ti priced at $749 / \u00a3729 \u2013 not too shabby since the RTX 4070 Ti Super originally sat $50 higher. However, the big catch is that this best graphics card contender is at the mercy of custom card pricing, and if fishing around in the gloomy waters of the AIC GPU scene has taught me anything, it\u2019s that you\u2019ll usually end up paying more for models with custom shrouds and factory overclocks regardless of MSRP.\nThe version I\u2019ve been testing for my RTX 5070 Ti review is the Gigabyte GAMING OC, which just so happens to come in at $919 / $969. That\u2019s an exuberant price tag seeing as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 starts at $999, and it\u2019s needless to say that you should just pick up the latter if you\u2019ve got the best part of $1,000 to spend. That\u2019s something that actually upsets me a little since the RTX 5070 Ti does hold up as a nice alternative to the 80-class card when it comes to performance, thermals, and power usage.\nSpecs\nThe RTX 5070 Ti shares a hell of a lot in common with the RTX 5080 despite its 70-class moniker. Both graphics cards wield GB203 GPU and 16GB GDDR7 VRAM, but the 5070 Ti\u2019s chipset is naturally scaled down. This in turn provides it with a lower 300W TDP compared to 360W with the RTX 5080, at the expense of a much lower 8,960 CUDA core count.\nThrow 280 Tensor cores and 70 RT cores into the mix and you\u2019ve got a card that feels like a class below the RTX 5080. That somewhat helps explain why it\u2019s $200 cheaper, but also aligns more with 70-class sensibilities in terms of power draw and efficiency. Ultimately, this model feels like a good replacement for an aging RTX 3070 Ti since its TDP is only 10W higher, but you will want to review your PSU situation if you\u2019re upgrading from a 20-series or lower-spec Ampere.\nSince we\u2019re talking about a custom card, it\u2019s worth touching on what that means for this RTX 5070 Ti. Gigabyte\u2019s GPU boasts a faster 2,588MHz boost clock speeds via a factory overclock, and you can ramp things up further past the standard 2,452MHz using the card\u2019s Control Centre software.\nModel | RTX 5070 Ti | Gigabyte RTX 5070 Ti OC (tested) | RTX 4070 Ti Super |\n|---|---|---|---|\nPrice | $749 / \u00a3729 | $999 / \u00a3989 | Row 0 - Cell 3 |\nGPU | GB203 | GB203 | AD103 |\nCUDA cores | 8,960 | 8,960 | 8,448 |\nTensor cores | 280 | 280 | 264 |\nRT cores | 70 | 70 | 66 |\nBase clock | 2,300 MHz | 2,300 MHz | 2,340 MHz |\nBoost clock | 2,452 MHz | 2,588MHz | 2,610 MHz |\nVRAM | 16GB GDDR7 | 16GB GDDR7 | 16GB GDDR6X |\nMemory bus | 256-bit | 256-bit | 256-bit |\nTDP | 300W | 300W | 285W |\nDesign\nAs I\u2019ve already spoiled, there is no RTX 5070 Ti Founders Edition, so you\u2019ll have to make do with custom variants like the Gigabyte Gaming OC. That\u2019s not inherently a bad thing since models like this are designed with overclocking and maximum efficiency in mind, but Nvidia\u2019s new slimmer FE approach means I\u2019m now struggling to tolerate larger GPUs.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019ll get with the Gigabyte RTX 5070 Ti Gaming OC \u2013 an absurdly large three-slot graphics card that matches the GeForce RTX 4090 in size. Plenty of other AICs are guilty of the same crime, as every other model I\u2019ve checked features a similar three-fan shroud that cares not for your precious PC case space.\nAesthetically, Gigabyte\u2019s RTX 5070 Ti looks fairly industrial thanks to its gunmetal grey plastics and industrial vibes. The whole package feels very \u201cMetal Gear Rising\u201d, albeit if Raiden was clad in rainbow lighting and could run Cyberpunk 2077 at 4K. You\u2019re getting three halo RGB ring lights around each fan and an illuminated logo with this model, and there\u2019s even a little sliding plate that shunts the branding to the left if you\u2019d rather de-badge the GPU. Is all that worth an extra $200 compared to MSRP? Positively not, but some of you might be looking for that specific vibe regardless.\nIt\u2019s not that I think the Gigabyte Gaming OC is ugly, it\u2019s more that there\u2019s no way it should be larger than the standard RTX 5080. The extra heft absolutely comes with cooling benefits that I\u2019ll explore further, but the custom card scene doesn\u2019t seem to be aligned with Nvidia on size this generation. Put it this way, the PNY RTX 5080 OC didn\u2019t get a pass for being extra chonky, so I\u2019m hardly going to let a 70-class card off scot-free.\nOne element that I am slightly nervous about is the 12-pin power connector placement. With the included dongle attached, it sticks out quite a bit in front of the card extending outwards towards my PC side panel. So long as you make sure the adapter is pushed in until you hear a click, and there\u2019s plenty of space between the cable and your PC case side panel, there shouldn\u2019t be any issues.Not angling the connector or positioning it a bit further back on the PCB does play into overheating risks caused by it not being seated properly.\nFeatures\nLike it or not, Nvidia is now an AI company, and just like the RTX 30 series before it, Blackwell graphics cards all draw from an artificially enhanced toolkit. Elements like DLSS 4 have swiftly become the main selling point of GeForce GPUs and, just like the RTX 5080, the new RTX 5070 Ti uses Multi-Frame Generation to address a growing need for monstrous PC performance.\nI\u2019m going to be delving deeper into the benefits and caveats of DLSS 4 as the next generation of GPUs rolls out. But, as things currently stand, both Multi-Frame Generation and Super Sampling effectively fill in frame rate caps to give you a fps boost. The former is there to guess what\u2019s going to happen next visually to generate three frames for every single native image generated, while AI upscaling dynamically dials down resolutions to provide performance headroom.\nWith every passing generation, it becomes harder to pass Nvidia\u2019s \u201cis it 4K cake\u201d test. It\u2019s not flawless, and you\u2019ll find AI wrinkles the closer you squint at finer details like textures and distant text. But, considering you can boost fps to triple digits all while mostly preserving perceived fidelity, the tool is well worth using. Plus, the green team keeps latency issues at bay with its Reflex tech, which is absolutely needed when you\u2019re talking about pairing artificial frames with fast-paced movement.\nOn top of that, you\u2019re also getting Ray Reconstruction, which serves to provide more accurate path-traced lighting, and enhanced Transformer AI model integration. By using the same tech as the likes of ChatGPT, Nvidia claims it can produce better temporal stability, less ghosting, and generally less artificial weirdness, but there\u2019s no 100% guarantee that\u2019ll shield you from graphical nonsense. The results are mostly fine, but as I\u2019ll get on to, there are some hiccups that can somewhat break immersion.\nThe custom model I\u2019m testing features Gigabyte\u2019s Control Centre as an easy way to experiment with overclocking and even just mess around with the GPU\u2019s RGB lighting. Naturally, enhancing boost clock speeds is the main draw here, and the software packs more functionality than many other brand apps I\u2019ve tried.\nI\u2019m a particularly big fan of the OC scanner built into this hub that automatically recommends an optimal stable overclock for your specific system. That feels like the sort of helping hand new overclockers could need to get started, and the whole setup of this chonkier tri-cooler card feels made for ramping up speeds.\nPerformance\nThe RTX 5070 Ti lives and dies by the performance it provides compared to its Blackwell siblings. It\u2019s flanked by both its own RTX 5070 and RTX 5080 flesh and blood and will soon have to contend with the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT on the battlefield. Thankfully, it packed enough of a punch in my tests to justify its existence alongside its 80-class comrade, and while I\u2019ll need to also test the RTX 5070 before truly knowing where it stands, I\u2019m pretty happy with its 4K capabilities.\nNormally, I\u2019d expect 4K ray tracing results to provide the biggest gap between card classes, yet that\u2019s not the case for the RTX 5070 Ti. Switching on the Ultra 4K RT preset in Cyberpunk 2077 produced a 30fps average that isn\u2019t too far off the RTX 5080\u2019s 36fps result. The same applied to my Hitman 3 benchmark, with the 70-class card hitting 38fps versus 48fps. The increased boost clock speed of this card plays a role in these figures, so keep that at the forefront of your mind alongside its lofty price. Still, it\u2019s nice to see that you\u2019re not losing too many frames when opting for the cheaper option.\nDLSS 4 results are a bit more gappy, but that makes sense given that it\u2019s working with lower frame rates to begin with. The results are still impressive with 4x Multi-Frame Generation enabled, given you\u2019ll be able to hit 212fps with ultra ray tracing enabled in Cyberpunk 2077 and a similar 210fps in Hitman 3. Unless you\u2019re looking to completely satiate one of the best gaming monitors with 4K 240Hz abilities, that\u2019s plenty.\nThe RTX 5070 Ti also impresses in shooters like Marvel Rivals and Overwatch 2. The hit comic book hero romp can hit 60fps at 4K max settings without any assistance, but switching on DLSS 4 makes hitting a 260fps average child\u2019s play. Playing Overwatch 2 at a ridiculous 600fps (its frame rate cap) is also easy to pull off with this GPU, so you\u2019ll be able to easily dial things in your screen refresh rate preferences.\nTimespy: 27,961\nFirestrike: 55,468\nDuring all my upcoming GPU reviews, I\u2019ll be on the lookout for any DLSS 4 quirks that come tied to AI upscaling or Multi-frame Generation. While I didn\u2019t come across anything too egregious during testing, I am starting to notice more graphical hiccups as I spend more time with the tools. While driving around the streets of Night City, I noticed that signs would occasionally look nothing like actual letters from a distance, and drawing closer would cause writing to magically transform into English text.\nThe effect felt a bit like when you see an AI image that\u2019s trying to create writing but ends up producing what looks like made-up characters. It\u2019s not something I\u2019ve encountered that often in games using the feature, and I reckon traveling at speed played a part in the quirk. But, it is worth taking note of if you\u2019re hoping to use the upscaling tools by default, especially if new releases start to feature more weirdness.\nAs much as I wish the Gigabyte RTX 5070 Ti didn\u2019t share the same girth as an OG PS2, the extra thickness contributes to exceptional cooling. Across all my benchmarks, I couldn\u2019t get the card to rise above 62\u00b0C. It\u2019s safe to say that leaves plenty room for overclocking potential, which could ultimately help you inch frame rates closer to RTX 5080 levels.\nShould you buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti\nAs a cheaper alternative to the RTX 5080, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti stands as a great 4K graphics card. The issue is that if you go for something like the Gigabyte Gaming OC, the value is swallowed whole by monstrous price tags that are within touching distance of this generation\u2019s 80-class MSRP.\nHowever, it\u2019s worth remembering that Nvidia\u2019s MSRPs only apply to a small selection of models. There will be custom cards with extra cooling solutions for around $749, but as soon as additional RGB fluff and other aesthetic features are thrown into the mix, you\u2019re talking about drastically different pricing. Rather than paying another $200 for some rainbow lighting, I\u2019d instead look at options like the Gigabyte Windforce OC model since it boasts a similar cooling system and is still overclockable while matching the green team\u2019s base pricing.\nAll in all, the RTX 5070 Ti packs just enough juice to make native 4K PC gaming a reality for theoretically less this generation. It also can pull off incredible ray tracing results using DLSS 4 and Multi-frame Generation tricks, and if you can\u2019t spend above $750, you won\u2019t be left disappointed by this graphics card\u2019s capabilities. Just keep in mind that if the vanilla RTX 5070 can pull anywhere near the same performance, or even flex hard enough using AI upscaling to handle 4K frame rates, mid-range players will want to simply hold off for the cheaper model.\nHow I tested the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti\nFor a week, I used the Gigabyte RTX 5070 Ti Gaming OC in my main gaming PC. During that time, I used a set collection of test games including Cyberpunk 2077, Hitman 3, Total War: Warhammer 3, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and Marvel Rivals to benchmark the GPU\u2019s 4K abilities and record average frame rates with Ultra pre-sets and ray tracing enabled. I also tested each game using DLSS 4 and Mult-Frame Generation set to 4x to assess how the card\u2019s AI features can boost fps in different scenarios while preserving visual fidelity.\nFor more information on how we test graphics cards and other PC components, check out our full GamesRadar+ Hardware Policy for more information.\nPhil is the Hardware Editor at GamesRadar and joined the team in 2023.
