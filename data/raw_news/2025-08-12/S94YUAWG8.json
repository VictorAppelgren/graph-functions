The Battery & Energy Products segment includes Lithium 9-volt, cylindrical, thin cell and other non-rechargeable batteries, in addition to rechargeable batteries, uninterruptable power supplies, charging systems and accessories. We show 65 historical shares outstanding datapoints in our ULBI shares outstanding history coverage, used to compute ULBI market cap on those dates. Understanding the changing numbers of shares outstanding, the changing share price, and the resulting changing ULBI market cap history over the course of time is important for investors interested in comparing ULBI's market cap history versus its peers. Many \"beginner\" or \"novice\" investors will look at one stock trading at a price of $10 per share and another trading at a price of $20 per share and think the latter company is worth twice as much. Of course, that is a completely meaningless comparison without also knowing how many shares outstanding there are for each of the two companies, and then calculating their respective market caps. Comparing the share price of ULBI versus a peer is one thing; comparing ULBI market cap versus a peer is a completely different story. Furthermore, via fluctuation both in per-share price and in the number of shares outstanding (via issuance of new shares over time, the repurchase of existing shares), the market cap for a company like ULBI can fluctuate over the course of history.
