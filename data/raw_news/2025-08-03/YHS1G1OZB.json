      "text": "DETROIT \u2013 The U.S. government's auto safety watchdog has opened an investigation into battery fires in Tesla Model S electric cars.\nThe National Highway Traffic Administration says fires broke out in two of the cars in the U.S. after the undercarriage hit metal road debris. The debris pierced the batteries and caused a thermal reaction and fires. In each case, the car warned the driver of the damage, and both escaped without getting hurt.\nThe probe affects more than 13,000 cars from the 2013 model year that were sold in the U.S. Tesla has sold about 19,000 of the cars worldwide. They start at $70,000 but often run more than $100,000.\nTesla's batteries are located beneath the passenger compartment and protected by a quarter-inch-thick metal shield. Experts say that if the batteries are damaged, that can cause arcing and sparks and touch off a fire.\nNHTSA, in documents posted on its website Tuesday, said it opened the preliminary evaluation \"to examine the potential risks associated with undercarriage strikes\" on the Tesla cars. The investigation could lead to a recall, but a decision likely is months away.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said in a blog posting that the company asked the government to investigate, even though its cars catch fire at a far lower rate than gas-powered vehicles.\n\"While we think it is highly unlikely, if something is discovered that would result in a material improvement in occupant fire safety, we will immediately apply that change to new cars and offer it as a free retrofit to all existing cars,\" Musk wrote.\nHe also wrote that Tesla has done an over-the-air software update to give the car more ground clearance at highway speeds.\nMusk wrote that at first, a NHTSA investigation didn't seem like a good use of the agency's time given the higher frequency of gasoline-powered car fires. But he changed his mind. \"If a false perception about the safety of electric cars is allowed to linger, it will delay the advent of sustainable transport and increase the risk of global climate change, with potentially disastrous consequences worldwide. That cannot be allowed to happen,\" Musk wrote.\nHe has said previously that the car won't be recalled.\nPalo Alto, Calif.-based Tesla's stock rose more than 400 percent earlier in the year as the Model S won accolades from Consumer Reports and other magazines. But it has fallen 37 percent since news of the first fire was reported on Oct. 2.\nIts shares fell almost 4 percent, or $4.38, to $117.20 in premarket trading Tuesday.\nThe first U.S. fire occurred along a freeway in Kent, Wash., near Seattle when a Model S struck a curved metal object which pierced the shield and the battery. In the second case, a Model S caught fire Nov. 6 near Smyrna, Tenn., after the driver struck a trailer hitch in the road. Another fire was reported Oct. 17 in Mexico when a Model S burned after a high-speed crash.\nTESLA - TSLA STOCK QUOTE ON FOX BUSINESS\n___\nNational Highway Traffic Administration report: http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/UCM446471/INOA-PE13037-1867.PDF"

      "text": "This isn't your run-of-the-mill minivan, far from it. The Mercedes Vision V is shaking things up as a concept that gives us a sneak peek at what luxury vans could look like when they hit production in 2026.\nMercedes-Benz is on a mission to make you forget everything you thought you knew about family haulers. If you picture vans as boxy, practical and a little bit boring, the Vision V is here to flip that script with its bold looks, jaw-dropping tech and the kind of comfort that makes road trips feel like first-class flights.\nSign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\nGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide free when you join.\nA striking exterior: Chrome, lights, iconic design\nFrom the moment you see the Vision V, it's clear Mercedes wants to turn heads. The exterior features sculpted lines and chrome accents, giving it a modern yet unmistakably Mercedes look.\nAt the front, you'll spot an ornate LED light bar connecting the headlights, just beneath a glowing three-pointed-star hood ornament. The grille has been completely reimagined, combining chrome and illuminated elements for a futuristic touch. Massive 24-inch wheels with illuminated details and a wraparound rear taillight ensure this van stands out on any road.\nCHEVY MAKES HISTORY AT DAYTONA 500 WITH FIRST ELECTRIC PACE CAR\nStep inside the Vision V: Lounge-inspired luxury\nClimb inside, and you're met with an interior that feels more like a private jet than a van. Mercedes uses rich wood trim, white Nappa leather, white silk, and polished aluminum to create an atmosphere that's both tranquil and glamorous. The seats are designed for ultimate comfort, featuring flexible tubular cushions that can recline completely flat, transforming into beds for long journeys or restful stops.\nEntering the Vision V feels special, thanks to a large, automatically opening portal door and an illuminated retractable running board. For privacy, a smart glass partition between the driver and rear passengers can shift from transparent to opaque with just a touch.\nImmersive technology: A digital experience like no other\nMercedes has packed the Vision V with technology that turns every ride into an event. The centerpiece is a massive 65-inch retractable 4K cinema screen that rises from the floor, instantly transforming the rear cabin into a private theater. The 42-speaker Dolby Atmos surround sound system, including four glass-encased speakers, delivers an audio experience that rivals top home cinemas.\nSeven hidden projectors in the roof and floor, along with windows that double as projection surfaces, allow for a 360-degree viewing experience. Ambient lighting can sync with your music, and a fragrance diffuser adds another layer of sensory delight.\nFLYING CAR WITH 620-MILE RANGE SCHEDULED FOR UPCOMING LAUNCH\nSeven digital environments: Personalize every journey\nMercedes has created seven unique \"digital environments\" for passengers to enjoy. In Entertainment mode, you can relax and watch movies or listen to music. Relax mode reclines your seat and fills the screen with soothing landscapes and sounds. If you're in the mood for gaming, there's a controller tucked away, and you can even simulate driving while being chauffeured.\nWork mode lets you take video calls and access productivity tools, while Shopping mode brings a virtual storefront right to your seat. Discovery mode uses augmented reality to let you explore your surroundings in 3D, and Karaoke mode is perfect for those moments when you want to sing along with friends.\nHOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD? USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT\nBuilt on the VAN.EA platform: The future of electric luxury vans\nThe Vision V is built on Mercedes' new VAN.EA electric platform, which will support a lineup of high-end electric vans starting in 2026. This new architecture means a spacious, flat-floor design and the flexibility to include all the advanced features that make the Vision V unique. Mercedes plans to launch production models with names like VLS and VLE, targeting the premium end of the market.\nCompeting in a new segment: Luxury vans for private owners\nWith the Vision V, Mercedes is targeting a growing trend of luxury vans for private ownership. While this segment has been popular in Asia, it's now making its way to the U.S. The Vision V is set to compete with high-end minivans like the Lexus LM and Volvo EM90, but it goes even further with its focus on digital experiences and personalized luxury.\nGET A FREE SCAN TO FIND OUT IF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS ALREADY OUT ON THE WEB\nCost and pricing expectations for the Mercedes Vision V\nWhile Mercedes-Benz has not officially announced the price for the production version of the Vision V, early reports and industry speculation suggest that this luxury van could cost around $200,000, especially for models equipped with all the high-end features seen in the concept.\nFor context, the current V-Class starts at about $60,000 in Germany and can exceed $100,000 with options, so it's reasonable to expect the Vision V to command a significant premium, positioning it well above existing luxury van offerings. As with most high-end vehicles, the final price will likely depend on customization and selected features, but the Vision V is clearly aimed at buyers seeking exclusivity and the ultimate in automotive luxury.\nSUBSCRIBE TO KURT\u2019S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES\nKurt's key takeaways\nThe Mercedes Vision V is a clear signal that the luxury van market is about to get a serious upgrade.
