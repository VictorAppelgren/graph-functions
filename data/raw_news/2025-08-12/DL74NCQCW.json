  "description": "One filmmaker\u2019s playbook for helping people get clemency.",
  "content": "\u201cThat is a wall.\u201d I have a job that should not exist. \u201cHere it comes.\u201d Every few weeks, I drive about four hours to a prison in upstate New York. Then, using my lights and camera, I try to break someone out. [MUSIC PLAYING] \u201cI think I\u2019m starting with tea today.\u201d \u201cIn 2019, this lawyer I knew called me to tell me about this client named Skye Williamson. And he had applied twice for clemency, which is where the governor reduces your sentence. But his application hadn\u2019t gained any traction.\u201d Clemency was designed to give second chances to people who really turned their lives around in prison. But in recent years, clemency cases have plummeted. Clemency is a broken system. And that brokenness keeps me employed. Lawyers actually hire filmmakers like me to use the tools of cinema to tug on the governor\u2019s heartstrings. That\u2019s what I did for Skye. \u201cYou can\u2019t be fully prepared to engage in the world in a courageous and bold, transformative way if you\u2019re just running in denial.\u201d He spoke on camera about his transformation over the years. And his loved ones told me of their fears. \u201cSkye was afraid and spoke of it pretty directly, that he was afraid that he would die in prison.\u201d \u201cI put it all together into this shoddy little documentary. And we waited. And waited and waited. And it was about a year later that I got the call from his lawyer.\u201d \u201cHey, Matt. I just got off the phone with Skye, and the governor has granted clemency. And it wouldn\u2019t have happened without you, so thanks so much.\u201d \u201cI was just like, whoa, these videos really have some power.\u201d \u201cOh, my god.\u201d [LAUGHS] After Skye\u2019s release, I started getting more and more calls. I\u2019ve made about two dozen films for people like Skye. It\u2019s absurd. I\u2019m basically Netflix-ing them out of prison. But it works. My playbook is simple. And it goes like this. \u201cI went to about maybe 13 different foster homes.\u201d \u201cHis mother was treating him badly. She would go away for a weekend and leave him, a 4-year-old boy.\u201d The goal of Chapter 1 is simple \u2014 \u201cThis is my mother and father.\u201d \u2014 to show the governor that my clients were not born criminals. Most were dealt really difficult hands. \u201cHe was a very abusive father. Punches, kicks, verbal.\u201d I use every old photo or video clip that I can get my hands on to show the governor how long it\u2019s been. \u201cIt was a bad place for me to be. But I didn\u2019t recognize it at the time. And it still resonates with me now.\u201d Next up. \u201cCall from \u2014\u201d \u201cJohn.\u201d \u201c\u2014 an incarcerated individual.\u201d \u201cBack in December of 2001, I shot and killed a man. And it\u2019s a decision that I\u2019ll always regret.\u201d Chapter 2, the crime, is the story the governor really cares about. \u201cWe went inside, and I had the gun, just to scare him so we could have money to buy drugs.\u201d No euphemisms, no passive voice. I tell my clients to own their crimes. \u201cWhen he came towards me, took a step, I fired.\u201d \u201cI pulled the gun out of his hand. I was crying. I was angry.\u201d \u201cI just reacted. But it was a bad reaction.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m in shock. It\u2019s an out-of-body experience. There\u2019s no way for me to describe it. Thirty years later, and I think about it every day.\u201d The apology is delicate. It\u2019s my job to make my client\u2019s remorse feel palpable and authentic. \u201cI took away everything they had, man, their whole life, every moment with their family. So I don\u2019t know what I can say to make up for that.\u201d This is where I fade up the piano music. [MUSIC PLAYING] \u201cI have to say that I\u2019m sorry.\u201d To be clear, their apologies are heartfelt. \u201cI would beg for forgiveness because the drugs took me somewhere where I didn\u2019t want to go.\u201d But there\u2019s also a particular feeling the governor\u2019s office wants to feel. And it\u2019s my job to engineer that feeling. \u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate crime, taking somebody\u2019s life. My mother died. Somebody killed my mother. And I can tell you, I went through hell just thinking about it.\u201d A feeling of weightiness, clarity. \u201cI am truly, truly, truly sorry inside with every beat of my heart. Every day, I think about them.\u201d An almost superhuman level of empathy. \u201cEven the police officers. I\u2019m accountable for my actions, so my actions that day that caused them hardships.\u201d \u201cAnybody that I\u2019ve hurt or even inconvenienced, I owe a debt to society. I owe my community for the destruction that I\u2019ve caused in my community.\u201d The final act, the transformation, is where my clients really get to shine. \u201cCrocheting, for me, is very therapeutic.\u201d \u201cThis is a scarf he made. My favorite color is purple.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not a gangster no more. I crochet.\u201d \u201cThe kids in here call me Mama Lolly. They come to me for advice.\u201d Many speak with pride about helping others. \u201cA high percentage of guys come to prison functionally illiterate. So I look at it like if they could read, they wouldn\u2019t be involved in robbing. They wouldn\u2019t be involved in killing somebody. That\u2019s why I chose to be a teacher.\u201d The truth is, the prison system didn\u2019t actually rehabilitate most of my clients. They rehabilitated themselves, despite prison. Nevertheless, Chapter 4 has to send the governor a clear message of subservience. The system has worked on me. \u201cIt does feel like I\u2019ve kind of got lucky and I found my calling.\u201d They all end with a similar resolution, the denouement, if you will. \u201cI am not the person that I was 30 years ago.\u201d \u201cI am no longer that person I was 25 years ago.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not the same person. I have a different outlook on life. I want more.\u201d \u201cSo I\u2019m just going to have you look right into the lens of the camera.\u201d For people serving long sentences, winning a second chance has never been easy. \u201cHave a safe trip.\u201d \u201cReally good to see you.\u201d But for most of our history \u2014 \u201cThank you.\u201d \u201cHave a good one.\u201d \u2014 it wasn\u2019t nearly as hard as it is now. For decades, governors granted clemency pretty frequently. But since the tough-on-crime era of the 1980s \u2014 \u201cAttorney General William French Smith said today that violent crime had become a national problem.\u201d \u2014 second chances for prisoners have declined dramatically. A major reason for this is fear. \u201cBush supports the death penalty. Dukakis allowed murderers to have weekend passes from prison. One was Willie Horton. Horton fled, kidnapped a young couple, stabbing the man and repeatedly raping his girlfriend.\u201d Governors are afraid that the people they release will re-offend \u2014 \u201cPennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Mark Singel is doing some explaining tonight.\u201d \u201c\u2014 says he should never have voted to commute the life sentence of Reginald McFadden, under suspicion of kidnapping, rape and murder.\u201d \u2014 and the governors will suffer the political consequences. \u201cIt was clear to me that that would be the end of the campaign.\u201d There\u2019s mounting evidence that people who get clemency rarely return to prison. But politicians still feel pressure to appear tough on crime. \u201cThe cops know that this governor doesn\u2019t back them up. She catches them and releases them.\u201d \u201cJeff Landry knows criminals should serve their time.\u201d \u201cI voted against the early release of violent criminals.\u201d I understand a cautious approach to clemency. But some years, New York\u2019s governor hasn\u2019t granted clemency to a single prisoner. That isn\u2019t caution. It\u2019s cowardice. \u201cIt feels very dystopian that I have to go there and do this like this. It feels like I\u2019m trying to hack a broken system.\u201d If our prison system really is about rehabilitation, second chances should be part of how it functions without relying on road trips, or piano tracks, or getting the lighting just right. In 2021, Governor Kathy Hochul vowed to overhaul New York\u2019s clemency system. But in 2023, she only commuted the sentences of nine people, and in 2024, only three people. \u201cWhat\u2019d you get?\u201d \u201cCheddar Pringles.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful when it happens. But it should happen way more.\u201d \u201cOK, OK, all right.\u201d \u201cYay!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going home. Yeah, yeah.\u201d So Governor Hochul and other governors across the country \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m free at last.\u201d [CHEERING] \u2014 this is my plea. Put me out of business. I\u2019m not asking you to break from tradition. I\u2019m asking you to return to it. Until you do, I\u2019ll keep filming. [MUSIC PLAYING]",

  "summary": "Matt Kohn, a filmmaker known for using the tools of cinema to break people out of prison who have turned their lives around in prison, is often referred to as \"clemency,\" a system that allows for reduced sentences for individuals who have made a significant transformation in their lives. Kohn's work allows him to use these tools to draw the governor's attention to these individuals' transformation and gain second chances. Despite this, Clemency cases have decreased in recent years due to a decrease in the number of successful cases. Koon's approach to clemency has been successful, with calls from clients like Skye Williamson who had applied twice for clemable being granted. Kookmann's method involves a documentary showing the transformation of a man who was imprisoned for 30 years and was afraid to die in prison. He uses these films to convey the story of his transformation and personal experiences with clients, including murder, drug possession, violence, and drug use.",
