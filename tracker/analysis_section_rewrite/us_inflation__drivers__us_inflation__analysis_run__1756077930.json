      "feedback": "Strong scaffolding and a plausible three‑regime framing are here, but to reach world‑class quality you must tighten the causal chain, quantify the cross‑topic channels with all actionable anchors from the sources, and present a clean, testable watch‑list. Specifically: (1) reconstruct a precise policy‑to‑regime causal chain: baseline tariffs ~10% and China reciprocity up to 34% (with spikes to 145%) drive Regime A’s reshoring/semis AI/data‑center capex and a supply‑chain‑resilience impulse that lifts potential output and gradually compresses inflation/rates; explicitly cite SGB2PAZGK for the tariff/policy mechanism and STBVARD8F for Nvidia AI momentum linking to Regime A (avoid vague “supports A”). (2) formalize a true SECTION FOCUS cross‑topic synthesis: present a single three‑regime map with explicit definitions and region weights (e.g., Euro area Regime A ≈ 50%, Regimes B/C ≈ 30%/20% per NL5YYTLF2) and tie these to macro, policy, flows/positioning, and valuation/technicals, using direct cross‑citations (SGB2PAZGK, J99EM2TPZ, R3WNA7L7A, NL5YYTLF2) for each linkage. (3) embed a first‑principles grounding and a robust scenario structure: explain how AI‑driven productivity reduces inflation pressure and real rates under Regime A, while tariff shocks or policy missteps shift the regime toward B/C; acknowledge the 12–24 month productivity horizon cited in R3WNA7L7A and the euro‑area regime mix in NL5YYTLF2; (4) quantify with all numbers from sources and reconcile any conflicts: quote the numeric anchors (tariffs ~10%, China reciprocity up to 34%, spikes to 145% in SGB2PAZGK; oil regime anchors Brent in mid‑60s, WTI low‑60s; 2025 supply/demand shifts and refinery runs 85.6 mbpd; ACMR/2025 revenue ~$900m with ~4% gross margin per 22PL3Q360; core‑inflation path 0.30–0.40% MoM per Y6SQOEK69) and attach citations to each claim; where sources diverge (e.g., regime probabilities for Europe vs global), present them as a bounded envelope rather than a single point. (5) sharpen catalysts, triggers, and invalidation: lay out explicit catalysts (Nvidia momentum STBVARD8F; tariff policy dynamics; oil‑supply developments; core inflation prints) and clear invalidation signals (e.g., sustained inflation persistence driving higher discount rates per Y6SQOEK69 and 22PL3Q360). (6) build a tight watch‑list of decisive signals with concrete tests and minimal ambiguity, not broad platitudes. (7) tighten formatting so every quantitative claim maps to one of the IDs and no claim floats without a cited anchor; ensure coverage of all critical sources and resolve any internal contradictions by presenting parallel regime paths where appropriate rather than a single narrative.",
