  "title": "5 Apps You Didn't Know Are Owned By Google",
  "description": "You might have heard of these five apps, and might even be a regular user of some of them, but did you know that all five of these apps are owned by Google?",
  "content": "5 Apps You Didn't Know Are Owned By Google\n\nWhen you think of Google, your brain probably jumps straight to Chrome tabs breeding like rabbits, Gmail with its hoard of decade-long unread newsletters, or Maps rescuing you when you've taken one wrong turn too many. Which is completely understandable, but a tech giant like Google is bound to have some hidden tricks up its sleeves, just like these three major companies you might not realize are owned by Google. It hasn't just built fantastic apps, but acquired some pretty solid ones too. There are the obvious big boys like YouTube, and then some hidden gems that edit photos, navigate through the streets, and save your life one math problem at a time. Google owns quite a handful of the apps you're happily tapping away on, and chances are, you didn't even know it. These are some of the apps hiding under Google's umbrella, especially the ones you've been using all along without realizing who's really signing the checks.\n\nTime and again, the rhythms of life show us that true strength lies in nailing the basics, not the glitter of a shiny new trick \u2014 and Snapseed is living proof of that. In the early years of the previous decade, the app wasn't just popular \u2014 it was practically a rite of passage for anyone who loved to take photographs on their devices. The UI is deliciously barebones yet sports a buffet of over 25 tools. Whether you need to flick a gum wrapper out of your photo's background, erase that stubborn pimple, or bathe a dull photo in a faux sunset glow, Snapseed will handle it with a few quick taps on the screen. Before Google swooped in to acquire Snapseed in 2012, it was paid and iOS-only but was already trailblazing to triumph by winning iPad App of the Year. Google's big dream? Rival Instagram in its war against Facebook. Snapseed already had the photo-editing part nailed down tight, but it lacked the social stage. The only way those two were ever linked was when we saw influencers on Instagram sharing their favorite Snapseed settings to edit their photos \u2014 tips you can get in on to make your smartphone photos pop using Snapseed. To this day, a class app like Snapseed is completely free to use on the App Store and Google Play without any subscriptions, upgrades, or even ads. You get every tool out of the box without spending a dime.\n\nBuilt with the daily driver in mind, Waves thrives on real-time, crowdsourced updates. Unlike most conventional navigation apps, it does more than just direct you from one place to another \u2014 your commute is more of a social experience, with driver to driver intel keeping you company through traffic jams and road closures. The interface is vivid and cheerful \u2014 not something navigation apps are really focused on, and what do those random emojis on Waze even mean? You get a clear warning for where police and speed cameras are located, the different parking lots and their prices near your destination, charging stations and tolls. Plus, it lets you link up with Spotify, Pandora, and friends so your playlists stay in reach. The fact that it's second in Navigation on the App Store and has over 500 million downloads on Google Play is a testament to its incredible features. However, there are areas where it stumbles. Setting a starting point anywhere other than your current spot feels like solving a puzzle. If you lose internet connection, you lose Waze \u2014 there's no true offline safety net. It does feel odd at first, doesn't it? Why would Google keep Google Maps and Waze when they technically do the same thing? If you've used them both at certain points, you'll know that both the apps have different identities \u2014 Google Maps is the serious, buttoned-up, fact-driven sibling, while Waze is the cheeky, bright, and trustworthy friend with all the valuable insider gossip.\n\nIn the easiest of terms, Looker Studio is a tool that pulls data from different sources, slices it, dices it, and turns it into reports and dashboards that actually make sense and can be easily interpreted. Under the hood, it uses its own markup language (LookML) to predefine all the joins, filters, and rules, but for the average business user it feels as simple as clicking the right fields and filters on a clean interface. Google's Looker app for Google Play and App Store takes all this power and puts it in your pocket app. You can log in seamlessly on your phone with Google OAuth or 3PIDP, browse through your dashboards, Looks, boards, and even collaborate with your team while you're on the go. This experience becomes even more well-rounded since Looker Studio offers reports optimized for smaller screens. Looker is often seen in contention with other Business Intelligence platforms like Tableau and Power BI, with users preferring Looker due to its robust permissioning and data security framework, but finding it short in customization and dashboard aesthetics.\n\nHere we have the fairy godmother of students struggling with math worldwide. Photomath is almost every student's \u2014 present or former \u2014 dearest wish turned into an app. Someone doing your math homework for you. The only thing you have to do is point your camera at the problem \u2014 whether it's typed, handwritten, or on another screen. Step-by-step explanations, various problem-solving methods, and even animated breakdowns to show you how the math unravels. The millennial in me would never have imagined this could happen some 10 years ago. While this miracle is a ray of sunshine for students, it's a bit of a nightmare for the teachers. If you really look into it. Photomath for App Store and Google Play isn't really about cheating. The app helps you learn at your own pace, and you have a tutor available in your pocket at all times. It's all inclusive, meaning anyone learning elementary to advanced math will find it useful, making it one of the best apps every iPad user should have installed. AI-based apps like these are rewriting the current education system, and when giants like Google throw their weight behind AI-powered learning, it signals a large shift. The question isn't whether apps like Photomath are helpful (they absolutely are), but whether this shift is a blessing or a crutch. While the app is free to download, it does offer in-app purchases with a Monthly plan retailing at $9.99 and a Yearly plan retailing at $69.99.\n\nAccessibility matters, and Lookout for Android makes sure people with low vision or blindness can stay on top of their surroundings and everyday tasks, whether that's handling groceries, keeping track of money, or reading labels and receipts with way less hassle. Using just your smartphone camera, Lookout taps into cutting-edge computer vision and AI to recognize objects, read text, and even describe what it sees right through the lens. It's available in over 30 languages, including English, Arabic, Filipino, Hindi, Italian, Finnish, and plenty more. Paired with some useful tech gadgets that can assist the visually impaired, it contributes to making life much more easier for them. Once you've set up the app, you can lean on it for daily assistance with seven handy modes, giving you instant access to your environment. You can use Document mode to read full pages of text, or switch to Food Labels mode to scan barcodes and recognize products on the spot. Currency Notes mode helps you figure out the type and amount of money in different currencies \u2014 though right now it only works with U.S. dollars, Indian Rupees, and Euros, and doesn't cover coins yet. There's also an Explore mode, which lets you hear real-time descriptions of the objects and text around you.",

      "text": "10 Ways To Make Your Smartphone Photos Pop Using Snapseed\nThere are dozens of photo apps and image editors available for photographers, and they can all be used to improve your smartphone photography to various degrees. However, Snapseed is a powerful yet easy-to-use photo editor that can improve your smartphone photography no end. Despite being owned and managed by Google, Snapseed is available on iOS as well as Android. It's also completely free, with nothing hidden behind a paywall despite some of the tools being magical to use. This makes it accessible to everyone, and we thoroughly recommend you give it a try.\nSnapseed provides a range of editing tools for all smartphone photographers. Amateurs and professionals alike can use Snapseed to make their smartphone photos look better. Most of the Snapseed tools outlined below will make subtle differences to your photos. However, several will make a huge difference on their own, and by using a combination of these, you can turn dull and lifeless smartphone snapshots into photographs you'll be proud to share on social media.\nYou don't need any skills to use Snapseed in its basic form, as the app does the hard work for you. However, if you have more experience editing images and an understanding of what individual settings to tweak, you can also manually manipulate your photos until they look just as you want them to look. Here are 10 ways to make your smartphone photos pop using Snapseed, along with images showing the impact of the edits made.\nChoose one of the default styles that Snapseed offers\nSnapseed offers a range of styles that can be applied to your smartphone photos. Snapseed's styles are just like filters, and apply specific settings to the photo. If you apply the right filter to the right photo, the results can be spectacular. These styles are sometimes enough to make a photo pop without changing anything else, making them perfect for amateur photographers who want to make basic changes without needing a degree in photography. However, even if you apply a Snapseed style, you can still tweak a photo further. You can think of Snapseed's styles as a starting point, giving you a basis to finetune further.\nSnapseed's styles include Portrait (perfect for portraits of people), Smooth (which smooths all of the details out), Pop (which makes the colors and details pop), and Fine Art (which turns the photo black and white with an artistic flair). You can apply each turn to see if it suits the photo you're currently editing, but the edits won't stick unless and until you click the tick icon. Even if you then change your mind, you can undo the most recent edit or revert the photo back to its original form at any point. This applies to all of the editing tools mentioned in this article.\nTune the image utilizing the magic wand\nSnapseed's Tune Image tool lets you change the brightness, contrast, saturation, warmth, and many other visual elements of your photos. You can ramp these up or dial them down as you see fit, or utilize the magic wand and have Snapseed do it for you. The latter option is particularly useful if you're new to photo editing, and are still tuning into what works and what doesn't. In fact, if that's the case, Snapseed's magic wand can help, as seeing what the app chooses to do with your photo and what effect it has can help teach you what to do yourself.\nTo have Snapseed automagically tune the image as the algorithm sees fit, click the magic wand icon. If you then click the slider icon, you will be able to see the changes Snapseed made to each attribute, and adjust them further as you see fit. Or you can start with the manual sliders, bypassing the magic wand function completely. After selecting an attribute from the list, you then just move the slider to the left or right to increase or decrease its value. While you can see the effect your edits are having in real-time, none of them will stick until you tap the Tick icon in the bottom-right of the app.\nCrop the image to improve the composition\nSnapseed's built in Crop tool lets you edit your photo in a number of different ways. This includes changing the aspect ratio, with Snapseed offering a range of default sizes. You can also go freehand to remove any unnecessary elements from your photos or to fill the frame. The ultimate goal of editing any photo is to improve the composition of it, and beyond applying a style or tuning the image, the Crop tool should be the first tool you use. This is because it enables you to change what is and isn't included in the photo as a whole. After all, thinking about what is and isn't in the frame is one of the key smartphone photography tips everyone should be using.\nTo use the Crop tool, open the Tools menu and tap Crop. You'll see a range of different aspect ratios you can apply to your photo, including Original, Square, and a range of common ratios. Tap one, and it will be applied to the image. If you land on one that fits your photo perfectly, tap the Tick to apply it. There's also the option to select Free, and change the edges and corners of the photo as you see fit. You can even do this after selecting a set aspect ratio, which essentially allows you to finetune a default aspect ratio.\nEdit the tonal contrast to sharpen or soften\nUsing the Tonal Contrast tool lets you tweak the high tones, medium tones, low tones, highlights, and shadows. You can tweak each setting with a simple-to-use slider, seeing the results appear in real-time as you make adjustments. While the Tonal Contrast tool isn't necessary for every photo, experienced photographers will get some use out of it as a way of fine-tuning images when the app's automagic settings haven't quite nailed the results they were looking for. Beginners and those who aren't looking to make subtle adjustments can probably leave this particular tool alone.\nTo change the tonal contrast of your photo, open the Tools menu and tap Tonal Contrast. The tool will open with High Tones selected, so just swipe your finger across to the left or right to decrease or increase the high tones as you see fit. When you're happy with these, tap the slider icon under the photo and switch to one of the other settings. Repeat until you're happy with each of the settings.\nChanging the high tones add contrast of the highlights, the medium tones add contrast to the middle gray tones, and the low tones add contrast to the shadows in the image. The Protect Shadows and Protect Highlights options are designed to preserve details even with the contrast being increased.\nChange the white balance using the dropper tool\nAnother important tool to be aware of is the White Balance slider, which lets you tweak the temperature and tint of your photos. There's the option to automatically adjust both with one press of a button. Or you can use the dropper tool to set the white balance of an individual photo based on a particular area of the image.\nChanging the temperature of a photo gives the photo a warmer or cooler vibe depending on your personal preference. Changing the temperature and tint is useful for cluing a viewer into how you're trying to make them feel. This can either be strong or subtle depending on what you're hoping to achieve, and you don't need to stick to the natural color palette that was present when you shot the photo.\nTo change the white balance of your photo, open the Tools menu and tap White Balance. Tap the AW icon to have Snapseed automatically adjust the white balance. Tap the dropper icon and drag it around the image to change the color settings based on the area it's targeting. Alternatively, click the slider icon to manually change the temperature and tint. In general terms, Temperature balances colors between cold blue and warm yellow, while Tint balances colors between green and magenta. I recommend experimenting with each one to find what works for the individual image you're editing.\nAdd a retrolux filter for a retro look\nThe Retrolux tool lets you apply one of a number of filters intended to give an image a retro feel. This is not a Snapseed tool you would use for every image \u2014 unless you're absolutely in love with the retro look, that is \u2014 but depending on the subject and setting, and the look and feel you're trying to create, it can be a useful option regardless. There are over a dozen retro filters to choose from, with each one changing the colors, temperature, tint, and brightness of your photo. Each one offers a slightly different retro look, allowing you to create your own retro style.\nTo add a retro filter to your photo, open the Tools menu and tap Retrolux. You'll see a range of retro filters under your photo, any one of which can be applied depending on what effect you're looking to create. Each filter has a different color palette, but once you have selected the best filter, you can then manually tweak how it looks. Tap the slider icon and you'll be able to increase or decrease the brightness, contrast, saturation, style strength, scratches, and light leaks. This level of control means you can make every single image look exactly as you want it to look.\nAdd a grainy film for an analog feel\nThe Grainy Film tool lets you apply one of a number of grainy filters, giving your digital image a more analog look and feel. We're all now very used to digital photos and how they look, but if you want to give a photo a more analog feel, you can apply one of a number of different filters that brings the grain from color film back. With some photographers actually buying old cameras to achieve this look when shooting, the Grainy Film tool provides an affordable and convenient way of achieving something similar.\nTo apply a grainy film look to your photo, open the Tools menu and tap Grainy Film. You'll see a range of grainy film styles across the bottom of the app, and can apply each in turn to see what effect it has on your image. When you have settled on one, tap the slider icon to open the finetune menu. You can increase both the grain and style strength by swiping left or right. Adding more grain to an image will make it look more pixelated, while style strength changes the strength of the style you have chosen. Setting either to a value of 0 will mean you can focus entirely on the other.\nSwitch from color to black and white\nWhile you probably shoot exclusively in color, some photos look better in black and white. Which makes Snapseed's Black and White tool a must-have in any photographer's arsenal. It lets you remove all of the color from a photo, with the range of filters applying different styles of black and white to your image. You can also make manual edits to adjust very specific elements within that. When coupled with the Retrolux and Grainy Film tools, you can end up with photos that look like they were shot decades ago on old film cameras.\nTo turn your photo from color into black and white, open the Tools menu and tap Black and White. You'll see a small range of black and white styles running across the bottom of your photo, including Neutral, Bright, and Dark. Apply each one in turn to see what effect they have on your photo, and if it suits the subject, tap the Tick in the bottom-right to apply it permanently. You can also tap the slider icon to manually change the brightness, contrast, and grain values. You can also apply a color filter to replicate shooting with a colored glass filter over your lens. This effect may be subtle, but it can vastly impact the look of a shot.\nAdd lens blur to focus on a particular point\nThe Lens Blur tool lets you focus on a certain point of an image, blurring everything else around it. Unlike some of the tools Snapseed offers, this should be used with care, and isn't suitable for most photos. However, if you apply a lens blur to a shot that benefits from it, the results can be amazing. You get to choose the part of the photo to focus on by simply moving a dot around the screen. You can also choose different shapes for the lens blur to use, and make manual edits to change the blur strength, vignette strength, and transition.\nTo add a lens blur effect to your photo, open the Tools menu and tap Lens Blur. You'll see a dot with concentric circles around it. By moving the dot around, you can change the portion of the photo left, and what parts are blurred. Click the target at the bottom of the screen to switch from having the style applied in a circular pattern to a more linear effect. Both of these can then be manipulated on the screen to change the size and shape of the area in focus. You can also change the shape, and manually adjust the blur strength, transition, and vignette strength to fine-tune the effect.\nUse the HDR-scape tool to intensify the colors\nFinally, the HDR Scape tool ramps everything up to 11 by employing high dynamic range. And it's for this reason that it should be used very selectively. The results are most definitely mixed, but when it works, it really works. This is a tool to use in moderation and with caution, as it will cause your photos to look obviously (or even overly) artificial \u2014 potentially making people wonder if it had been made using AI. However, there is the option to make manual changes after the initial application to ensure the effect isn't too over-the-top. With some logical manual editing used, the HDR-Scape tool can make an ordinary photo look extraordinary.\nTo apply an HDR effect to your photo, open the Tools menu and tap HDR-scape. There are four basic styles you can apply: Nature, People, Fine, and Strong. Nature is obviously geared more towards photos showing nature, while People is best applied to portraits and human scenes. Whichever style you pick, you can manually adjust the effect by tapping the slider icon and increasing or decreasing the filter strength, brightness, and saturation levels. I would argue that this is the Snapseed tool that most benefits from manual edits, as without them, HDR-Scape can make your photos look worse rather than better."

Photomath lets you point your camera at the problem and a step-by-step explanation (and answer!) instantly appears on your screen. Triple-digit multiplication? Photomath\u2019s got it. Linear and quadratic inequalities? No problem.\nBest app yet for math\nSo I do sometimes cheat a little with homework but the only benefit is not knowing the answer on tests (no one knows I use it during that time too) I\u2019m not rlly the best student when it comes to math/algebra but it is what it is. Sometimes I think tho that I\u2019m not going to use some of these equations in my future life so might as well not learn about it now but that might take a turn on my later in life but that\u2019s just me. Personally it\u2019s still a great app so I have no dirt to throw on it but maybe some teachers do because it\u2019s not rlly helping the \u201cstudents\u201d but this app also shows the process of how it gets its answers step by step. I haven\u2019t got as far as degrees but you can also look up your book to get the answers too. I\u2019m surprised you got this far but still it\u2019s a cool app to use in your daily life if there\u2019s a WiFi that you need to some bogus math problem, then would you be able to use this app. Kudos to u for getting this far! Also I hope I didn\u2019t waste any of your time, I\u2019m just writing a good review but it might need better punctuation but there\u2019s a different app for that.\nApp Idea!!!!Want to make your app BETTER read THIS!!\nOk, this app is amazing it does wonders! BUTTTT I have to pay for it to teach me how to do it like Bruh. I thought y\u2019all got money\u2019s from ads? Instead of doing that I have an Idea for Y\u2019all. Instead of making people pay to learn how to do it, but You should have a learn option but not like the one you have now, the learn option should be an option that teaches you how to do it but instead you actually have to solve problems and rather you take a quiz on it and retake it as much as you\u2019d like! And up you can make people pay for it as it will be \u201cpremium\u201d. You could also include flash cards, and games to help figure the math type out!! People would definitely be willing to pay for an app that teaches good!! What you have now dose t do much for teaching but instead you can make a new and improved and FUN way to learn math, then you can have them add points to the equation whenever you get a question right! And then add an avatar that you can customize but you will need coins to buy whatever you want, you can earn those coins by answering correctly math. Or at least getting 7/10 or more right!!! Again this would main your app wayyy Funner and teachers could use it as a way to teach and would pay for the program!! So adding that would equal MORE MONEY towards your company!!! Let me know if you guys use this idea, and thanks for reading \ud83e\udd7a\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc95\nDeveloper Response ,\nHi and thanks for your positive feedback!

As always, these are free of charge.\nwe hope you enjoy,\nteam snapseed\nRatings and Reviews\nCorrection\nI\u2019m changing my rating after discovering something and remembering something else since writing my former review. If my new findings prove solid I will change it again to four stars, because I do love this app and hope it is as strong as it once was, but I wanna make sure it\u2019s running smoothly. Here\u2019s my findings:\nFor a while my app was freezing and then I couldn\u2019t upload photos to it at all. I just went to check if restrictions were on and they were, so I changed the setting and now I can upload photos and edit them again. I would have figured this much longer ago had there been a restricted access notification when I tried to hit the open button, but since there was not and since Id been having having other issues with the app, I assumed it had just failed. Another problem I was having involved saving images. For years my saved Snapseed images would show up in my main photo collection, and then one day- I now figure it was after an update- I wasn\u2019t finding them in my main photos, so I would instead use the share option and text them to myself and then save them to my photos; I did this for years not realizing until just now that my Snapseed photos had switched storage locations, now ending up in a separate (hard to reach at the bottom of all my other photo folders) Snapseed folder.\nWho designed the new version?!\nAs a Snapseed user since it was originally launched (~15 years ago?!), the new redesign is frustrating. The developers reversed the direction for edits; ie if you want to increase contrast now you swipe left when previously it\u2019s always been swipe right. There\u2019s no way to change this setting. The export button is in the top right corner rather than the bottom left. The top corners are arguably the least ergonomic locations to put anything due to the average reach of the thumb. The launch animation? Completely pointless. Just launch the app so I can edit! Why are edited/imported images saved on the landing page? Yes, you can delete them but only one by one. If you\u2019re going to force these images to be stored on the app taking up more space at least allow the option for \u2018delete all\u2019.\nI will acknowledge that being able to add/rearrange a few commonly used editing tools is extremely handy and hopefully we\u2019ll see the ability to save more than 4 in a future update. Speaking of which, why not allow the option to save a \u2018look\u2019? The app has always allowed users to quickly apply the \u2018last look\u2019 to images, but it would always be nice to create/save/apply your own recipes for even quicker edits.\nReally hope they allow users to change the direction of edit to match the old app. With the current layout I\u2019m not sure where they\u2019d relocate the export button but GD the top right corner is the worst position\nSo Much Love, But\u2026\nSnapseed has been my go to editing app for close to a decade now. It\u2019s wide range of powerful features and it\u2019s complete lack of hidden purchases still do a lot to recommend it (the Selective Edit feature in particular is what turned me onto it in the first place) but\u2026Having now tried this on two different phones, two different software profiles, the app hangs anytime I go to load a RAW image for development. Now, I could just go to Lightroom for this kind of thing, but the core simplicity and intuitive controls of Snapseed make it much less complicated than Lr. But, I shoot almost everything in RAW so that I can have that editing latitude, and loading an image, waiting and wondering whether I\u2019ll be able to edit it at all have left me looking to other options. For jpeg shooters, however, this app is a marvel: It costs nothing, and is packed with wonderful features. The aforementioned Selective Edit is a great way to punch up contrast and saturation to specific areas of your images and leaving areas of first shot perfection relatively untouched. Furthermore, the preset edits like Portrait and Fine Art (black and white) are a one tap ticket to Gorgeous Town. I just wish the developers would do something about the lottery like nature of RAW development. Fix the lag, and I\u2019ll bring back the Fifth Star, how about that?\nApp Privacy\nThe developer, Google, indicated that the app\u2019s privacy practices may include handling of data as described below.

Way better than othe maps. However I saved my daughter's voice for notifications such as hazards, speed cam etc and it doesn't work anymore. The voice is still there in settings and is selected but only \"pings\" (generic setting)when driving toward a hazard :( update. still experiencing problems have logged a ticket. thank you.\n60 people found this review helpful\nWaze\nFebruary 6, 2025\nHi, Amanda. This article: https://tinyurl.com/4e4tpwp6 should help with the reason as to why you're not getting verbal speed cam alerts.

That detour button needs to come back, and they need to add a way to add a stop on a route. Also, it tends to be off by a few miles at first before I start the route. I bounce between this and Google maps, but if they brought those features in? I'd use it more frequently.\n196 people found this review helpful\nWaze\nJune 9, 2025\nHey, Hadassah!

Why does it stop talking even though the volume is all the way up on the app and my phone? It is doing it more and more. Also, I don't appreciate it changing my route when I'm driving without asking. There should be more than 3 choices for the routes. I've used this app for several years and I was very happy with it but not so much now. I drive many miles a day for work so I really need these bugs or whatever fixed.\n24 people found this review helpful\nWaze\nAugust 4, 2025\nHi Tine. We understand that could be frustrating.

      "text": "5 Tech Gadgets That Will Help The Visually Impaired\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nBeing visually impaired has always brought forth its fair share of challenges for people. However, those affected have always found ingenious, beautiful ways to make everyday life fairly ordinary. As technology has advanced in the last several years, this has presented those with visual impairments with new challenges that they need to deal with, particularly as the overreliance on screens has become the societal norm. Of course, because of technological innovations, there have also been a plethora of gadgets and devices that have become an incredible asset to the visually impaired community.\nSome of these devices are made specifically for those with sight challenges. However, some of them are frequently used by every person, and they might not even know they have significant benefits for those who cannot see well. The five gadgets we are going to mention here fall into both categories and if you are someone out there with vision struggles, you might want to consider picking a few of these up, if not all of them. These aren't crazy things like using artificial intelligence to restore sight. Just functional, dependable products. Living in the digital world has presented many conveniences to people, which should be extended to everyone.\nRing doorbell\nRing has become an enormously popular brand in the last few years as a cheaper alternative for a home security system with its video doorbells. The built-in cameras on these devices have captured so many people trying to break into people's homes or, more commonly, people trying to steal packages from front porches. While these are terrific features that benefit so many, having a camera and a microphone to capture who is at the door can be an incredible asset to someone who can't see well.\nAnswering the door for someone with visual impairments or blindness can be a dangerous situation. You are putting a lot of trust in the fact that when you open the door, the person standing there won't take advantage of your inability to see who it is. By having a microphone built into the Ring doorbell, you can double-check who is at your door by voice before you even get close to opening it up. This is especially helpful for visually impaired children who need to answer the door. Ring wants to make your home a little safer, and this may not even be a way the company imagined the doorbell doing just that.\nAmazon Echo Show\nBecause screens can be an issue for those with problems with sight, using your voice and hearing become two of your biggest strengths. So much of our information and communication today is translated through text, but that can just as easily be done with audio as well. At a baseline, a device every person with visual impairments should have in their stable is some kind of virtual assistant speaker, be it an Amazon Echo with Alexa, a Google Home, or something else. If you need to know the weather or what time it is, want to play a song or ask any question, these devices can do all that and more just through voice commands.\nTo get specific, the Amazon Echo Show would be the best option for those with visual impairments. You may think that to be odd because this is an Alexa device with a screen when that isn't really what visually impaired people need. However, the Echo Show is the best option because of one specific feature: Show and Tell. With this feature, you can hold any item up to the camera on the Echo device, and it will tell you what it is. No more are the days of trying to distinguish between two cans in your pantry or being unsure of what something is on your coffee table. The Echo Show has a screen, but the more important hardware is its camera, making Show and Tell possible.\niPad\nIt is incredibly tough to get through modern life without some sort of smart device, be it a phone or a tablet. It's the primary way we stay connected to the world and the people in our lives. One problem: these devices are essentially just giant screens. They don't even really have buttons for people to differentiate through feel. However, Apple has made quite the effort to make portable screens quite friendly to those with various levels of visual impairment.\nDepending on how impacted your vision is, having a large iPad screen where text can be a lot larger, and icons spread further apart makes it easier to navigate than something where everything is so close together. Beyond the size of the device, though, are the built-in accessibility features. For instance, there's VoiceOver, Apple's screen reader. Not only can it read text on the screen, but it can also do things like tell you how much battery power is left, which app icon your finger is on, and audio notifications for phone calls.\nBeyond VoiceOver, iOS also has a feature that speaks aloud the letters and words you type to make sure they are what you want, as well as a speak-to-text feature. For movie watching, you can automatically have on audio description mode for the visuals. Plus, you can change text size and use a magnifier if that's what you struggle with in your vision. For being a giant screen, an iPad is surprisingly helpful for those who can't see well.\nHable One\nOf course, a large screen is not going to work for everyone with some visual impairments, but that doesn't change the fact that people today need to be connected through some kind of smart device, especially for communication purposes. One of the biggest roadblocks for visually impaired smartphone users is the buttonless keyboard. Particularly for blind people, having the tactility of buttons and bumps is crucial for them to use, but for things like an iPhone, that just doesn't exist on the device.\nThis is where a company like Hable comes in with their product, the Hable One, which is a compact Bluetooth keyboard that connects to your smartphone. This is not a full Qwerty keyboard but a simplified, Braille-inspired keyboard with eight buttons. Because it is more Braille-inspired than actual Braille, this device can also work for visually impaired people who do not know Braille or are learning it. When you purchase a Hable One, it also comes with a 30-minute training course for you to acclimate yourself to the device quickly. The keyboard is also usable by both iOS and Android devices.\nUccello Kettle\nSometimes, the gadgets that can help out those with sight problems do not need to be high-tech products. Sometimes, it can be incredibly simple to help out with one of the most ordinary tasks imaginable: pouring water. Depending on how impacted your vision is, having the spatial capabilities to pour water into a cup can be a challenge, and you find yourself having to clean up spilled liquid more often than you'd like. This can be especially tricky with hot water for tea, and you risk burning yourself.\nThe Uccello Kettle seeks to eliminate any issues one may have with this task. It is a stationary kettle that simply tilts forward when you want to pour it, safely securing it when you pour. This is a kettle obviously designed to heat up water, but if you so choose, this could just be an efficient, safe pitcher to use as well. You may have thought that there wasn't an innovation to be made with the task of pouring water into a cup, but you would be wrong."

The friendly interface and convenient detour routing really help the app shine, and its social-network integration make road trips with buddies a blast.\nGreat app but has definite shortcomings.\nWaze is my #1 choice for GPS. Live traffic updates, being able to edit traffic conditions on the fly to give a more accurate commute, and sharing routes and eta\u2019s are great features. I do hope they integrate voice commands with Siri so we can say things like \u201cHey Waze, drop a stopped vehicle pin.\u201d While we are driving so interaction becomes handsfree and safer.\nI gave 3 stars because there have been repeated issues with the app and service saying \u201cNo GPS available.\u201d I have tried rebooting, deleting & reinstalling, and clearing the app cache on my phone as well as making sure iOS and the app are updated constantly. But the occurrence does not appear to be linked to hardware failure unless it is something inherent to the 8s. Google and Apple maps do not have any issues when this occurs so I\u2019m at a loss as to what causes the issues with Waze. This occurs for about a 8-12 hours once a day, once or twice a month. Not the end of the world but heavily inconvenient when you regularly use the service for your GPS navigation (and it\u2019s a great service) and you are on the road daily for 4-6 hours at a time it is a problem.\nIf they could fix this problem and integrate voice commands for pin drops, this would be a hands down 5 Star app. Hopefully I\u2019ll get some feedback and can continue to use the service.\nLove it & Hate it all at the same time.\nI have been using Waze for about a month now I commute Just over 1000 miles a week. I really like that many people are out there using it and that you get vital information like a car\u2019s coming up on the shoulder, objects in the road and where the police are camping at.\nThe only problem I have with Waze I\u2019d like to see some changes is that there are too many choices to make when reporting information, for example if I want to report a car on the side of the road I have to hit four different selections before my information is sent meanwhile I\u2019m trying to look at the screen to find a small button and not paying attention to what is on the road. Reporting information needs to be simplified for the driver no more than two clicks to report a hazard something along the lines of the first click hazard second click \u201ccar on shoulder\u201d or \u201ccar in lane\u201d or \u201cobject in lane\u201d. Decision making buttons need to be a little larger like when you\u2019re confirming a hazard on the road is it still there yes or no the buttons are too small and I often miss them and not able to confirm the information information. May be a few seconds before you approach the hazard two large buttons could pop up and simply confirm yes or no is it there.\nI will say this I do enjoy using it and it is much better than Google maps or other navigation apps out there.\nApp Privacy\nThe developer, Waze Inc., indicated that the app\u2019s privacy practices may include handling of data as described below.

      "text": "12 Of The Best Apps Every iPad User Should Have Installed\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nSince its inception in 2010, the iPad has evolved from a piece of Apple innovation to a necessary piece of hardware for all kinds of people. In the hands of small business owners, the iPad can be a valuable tool to help facilitate business and efficiency. For students, it can be a great note-taking tool and, in some cases, take the place of laptops. For homebodies, the iPad can serve as a one-stop entertainment center that can host all the latest and greatest streaming apps as well as a host of optimized games that can take the mobile gaming experience to the next level.\nAs the iPad's footprint on the electronics community has grown, so too has the App Store. Apple's home for all things applications has blossomed into a vast catalog that caters to a wide variety of different interests and needs. As of August 2023, there are more than 1.6 million applications currently housed on the App Store. Amidst this abundance, discerning the best apps for a slew of varied functions can be overwhelming. That said, the cream has generally risen to the top of the App Store with true game-changing apps redefining characteristics such as creativity, efficiency, and fun factor.\nHere are 12 of the best apps every iPad user should have installed on their device.\nMint: Budget & Expense Manager\nSmall business owners and those who work primarily for themselves will likely use an iPad or tablet to facilitate business. Those who do should get familiar with Mint: Budget & Expense Manager. In an era where financial literacy and responsible money management are crucial, Mint empowers iPad owners with the tools and insights they need to take control of their finances. The app is developed by Intuit, the same company behind TurboTax and QuickBooks, and offers a deep set of tools to help users create budgets, monitor expenses, track investments, and achieve their financial goals. Another feature of the app allows users to set a wide variety of alerts, doubling as a way for users to raise their financial literacy.\nThough it's free to use, Mint offers a paid version that will run users $4.99 per month. And while it's also available for download on the Google Play Store, premium subscriptions are currently only available for iPadOS users. The paid version offers users access to advanced spending graphs in addition to an ad-free experience. Users can also view their credit scores at any time and track changes without their scores being negatively affected. Ultimately, those in search of a free budgeting app to organize their finances in one place should download Mint.\nProcreate\nAspiring artists and iPad owners generally just looking to have fun in an art application that takes advantage of the iPad's touchscreen should give Procreate some serious consideration. The app succeeds in not catering too heavily to any one subsection of its user base. The app's streamlined user interface ensures aspiring artists can focus on their work without being overwhelmed by complex menus or settings. Meanwhile, the app is not short on a deep collection of features artists of all skill levels can take advantage of. Other notable features include realistic textures and the ability to make time-lapse recordings within the app.\nProcreate provides users with a wide array of brushes, ranging from traditional pencil and pen styles to innovative digital brushes, all of which can be customized to suit the user's personal preferences. Procreate uses a layer system similar to popular programs such as Adobe Photoshop. The Photoshop similarities do not end there, as Procreate also supports the PSD file format, allowing for seamless integration with Photoshop for those who like to work on both their iPad and desktop.\nPerhaps best of all, Procreate boasts an active user community, giving users access to tutorials, resources, and the ability to groupthink alongside other Procreate users and artists. While Procreate is not free, there are no subscription fees associated with it, as it takes a one-time purchase of $9.99 to gain access to all this artistry app has to offer.\nCapCut\nApps such as TikTok and Vine before it have fundamentally changed the way people see social media. Social media posts are no longer limited to photos, videos, blog posts, and quick thoughts and now extend to bite-sized videos that have the potential to hold people's interest for hours on end. While TikTok has an editor built into it, those looking to develop short-form video content for other platforms and want to get more out of their iPad should download CapCut. Ironically enough, CapCut makes use of the same editing interface TikTok does, as its developer, ByteDance, also developed TikTok. As a result, the editing capabilities of CapCut will allow users to produce videos with a similar speed and ease.\nCapCut offers users a variety of video editing tools, such as trimming, splitting, cutting, and merging clips. Users can also add external elements such as text, stickers, and filters to further enhance their creations. You can record voiceovers within the app, and CapCut makes it easy to add audio files to videos as well. When the video is ready to be processed, CapCut users can export their creations in various resolutions and file types, allowing for optimization in accordance with the platform it is to be shared. Because all of CapCut's features are free to use and nothing is hidden behind a paywall, there is little reason for iPad users to not have it downloaded and handy.\nStreamlabs\nStreaming, while perhaps more niche than social media, is another type of media rapidly on the rise. Streamlabs is designed to facilitate streaming for many different purposes on many different platforms, including YouTube, Twitch, and Facebook Live. However, the app is particularly useful to streamers thanks to a bevy of optimized features. The app offers a wide range of customizable overlays, such as alerts, chat boxes, and donation widgets designed to increase engagement. Users can connect their streaming accounts seamlessly and go live with just a few taps, and once that is done, starting and stopping streams, moderating chats, and monitoring viewer engagement can easily be done in the main interface.\nStreamlabs is perhaps best known for its compatibility with other apps. Third-party video editing software and audio mixing tools can be taken advantage of to get the most out of Streamlabs. Additionally, iPad users can take advantage of the iPad's high-end cameras to stream directly off their devices if they wish. While Streamlabs is free to use, it will take a premium subscription for users to gain access to all the app has to offer. It can also be a pricey option for some at $150 per year, but given the utility it provides, it might just pay for itself. Content creators who want to connect with their audience, build a community, and enhance their live streaming presence should look at Streamlabs before trying other streaming apps.\nNotability\nThe iPad makes for a great note-taking aid for students considering its touchscreen functionality and the quality of its screen. The device also makes for a great note-taking aid for green-oriented individuals, as it eliminates the waste of paper. Enter Notability \u2014 a note-taking app designed specifically for iPadOS devices. Its functionality extends beyond simple note-taking, however, as the app also allows for sketching and annotation. The app's treasure trove of features makes it a clear upgrade on standard note-taking apps, but Notability stands out from the pack for the specific package of features it entails.\nOne of the hallmark features of Notability is multimedia note-taking, which allows users to incorporate many different types of content, such as handwriting, sketches, images, audio recordings, and more, into a single note to go with their notes and annotations. Notability's compatibility with the Apple Pencil will additionally provide iPad owners with an authentic note-taking experience. The app is free to download, but once downloaded requires users to choose a subscription plan to use the app. Notability will run consumers $2.99 per month or $14.99 per year for access on all devices, but its versatility on multiple levels makes it a must-buy for those who find themselves taking notes of any kind multiple times per week.\nGrammarly\nGrammarly is an app that comes in many forms, but given the iPad's functionality with note-taking and email, it is a necessary addition to your growing app library. Those who use their iPad to communicate regularly will find Grammarly particularly useful, as the app is designed to serve as an automatic spell checker for spelling, grammar, and punctuation. The app runs in the background and automatically suggests spell-checking changes as the user writes messages and emails. Those who use their iPads for work will never have to worry about accidentally sending a typo-laden email again.\nGrammarly is completely free to use, but the app does afford users a host of premium features hidden behind a $30 per-month paywall that can be condensed to $144 per year. For their money, Grammarly Premium users will receive suggestions for tone and word choice, sentence rewrites, and citations that are particularly helpful for students writing a paper for a class. Whether or not Grammarly's premium package is worth it will depend on the needs of the consumer. However, the app's writing assistance ensures clear, effective communication in various scenarios, giving it plenty of value in the context of the sea of iPad apps available for download.\nGoogle Workspace\nFor many, the apps of Google Workspace have taken the place of traditional programs that provide similar functions because of the app's cloud capabilities. For instance, one might prefer Google Docs to Microsoft Word for the ability to automatically save text documents in Google Cloud Storage, eliminating the need to move such files using external storage. Users of the app can even output their text files in file formats friendly with Microsoft Word, such as \".doc\" and \".docx,\" providing them with the versatility to work on essays, articles, and other projects from anywhere at any time. Since many likely already use Google Workspace in desktop form, there is plenty of reason to download the app for use on the iPad.\nAnother plus for Google Workspace is its ability to host real-time collaboration. Since all of the data lives in the cloud, multiple people can work on the same document, spreadsheet, or project at the same time and even see the edits being made in real-time, preventing one another from stepping on each other's toes. The versatility of apps included in Google Workspace is also a plus. While \"Docs\" can be a substitute for Microsoft Word in most cases, \"Sheets\" can serve the same purpose as Microsoft Excel. Likewise, \"Slides\" can substitute for Microsoft Powerpoint, and so on.\nThe only thing users may have to worry about paying for is extra storage in Google Drive, but Google's yearly fees are reasonable, with plans starting at just $1.99 per month for 100GB, while users can pay for up to 30TB of cloud storage in a given account if they need it.\nTeamViewer\nFor those who use both their iPad and desktop computer to facilitate work in their professional life, TeamViewer has plenty of utility. The app is designed to facilitate access to several devices remotely, giving one the power to, for example, control aspects of their desktop computer from their phone or tablet. Those who need to access desktop files on the go can now do so without needing to log in to a special VPN or get set up on a company share drive. TeamViewer's compatibility with different devices ultimately drives its value, as users can download and use it with their various devices without worrying about whether one device will agree with another.\nFrom there, the various uses of TeamViewer are seemingly endless. Tech-conscious users can get their families set up on TeamViewer to help them troubleshoot any common issues that may arise. Businesses can take advantage of the app to make hybrid remote setups and telecommuting situations more optimized than ever before. TeamViewer can also be used as a remote control of sorts to print files from anywhere in the office, and the screen-sharing capability of the app also makes it ideal for remote presentations. For all that it provides, TeamViewer is not cheap, with plans starting at nearly $25 per month. However, the app offers a free trial, so users should check it out first to see everything it has to offer before taking the plunge.\nChatGPT\nChatGPT has taken the world by storm in 2023, offering new AI solutions to a wide variety of different tasks. Developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT can assist those seeking detailed answers to specific questions without needing to comb through articles and research papers over multiple tabs to find a starting point. With ChatGPT, users can find a starting point and work their way backward through independent research. ChatGPT can also help with creative writing solutions and problem-solving, in addition to serving as a way for users to practice a second language without being intimidated by trying it out with strangers for the first time.\nThe app's presence on the iPad can complement existing applications, adding versatility, entertainment, and efficiency to basic tasks. Of course, the app's functions can be reached on the web from any device, but the iPadOS app is significantly more optimized, and users will likely not want to return to the web client after checking out the app. Users can interact with the app via voice, utilize haptic feedback within the app and even view their chat history when offline, a luxury not afforded on the web. ChatGPT is free for all to use, but those looking to remain on the cutting edge of AI innovation (and gain access to OpenAI's GPT-4 model) need to pay a premium subscription price of $19.99 per month.\nPhotomath\nPhotomath stands out as one of the best educational tools at the disposal of an iPad user. Per the app's website, Photomath was created by a father in search of an easier, more efficient way to help his children with their math homework. For him, explaining math concepts in a relatable way his children would understand proved challenging, opening the door for an app like Photomath to be created to assist its users with learning math outside the classroom. The app's function is in the title \u2014 iPad users can take a photo of a math problem or equation, and the app will provide instructions for ways the equation can be solved. The app can also read and recognize handwriting,\nAs useful as the app can be, it will be up to parents to police its usage as it could be used as a shortcut to solving math problems and completing homework without kids actually \"learning\" new math concepts and methods. While Photomath is free-to-use, users can also take advantage of a premium subscription branded Photomath Plus. The app's premium subscription offers a one-week trial with monthly plans starting at $9.99 and yearly plans starting at $59.99. Those invested in the app as a learning aid should consider subscribing, as the premium subscription offers detailed step-by-step instructions for problem-solving, custom visual aids, and \"deep-dive solutions for hundreds of textbooks.\"\nDuolingo\nThere is no limit on the value of learning a second or third language. For iPad owners, Duolingo is a great choice for those looking to learn or refine their non-dominant language. At its core, Duolingo employs a slew of interactive exercises, including listening, speaking, reading, and writing, to engage learners in a dynamic and immersive language-learning experience. The interface is extremely user-friendly, and while this is a key characteristic of most popular apps, Duolingo takes the phrase \"user-friendly\" to the next level and makes use of the iPad's capabilities to make learning new languages fun and easy (or at least as easy as it can be).\nAssuming users of the application are native English speakers, Duolingo offers courses in 37 different languages that do not include fictional languages also offered, such as Klingon from the \"Star Trek\" series and High Valyrian from the \"Game of Thrones.\" Another plus for Duolingo is the free-to-use nature of the app. Users can subscribe to \"Super Duolingo\" for $7.99 per month, which removes ads and gives users unlimited usage (free users will have to pause their lesson if they get too many questions wrong). A $47.99 price tag for those looking for a yearly subscription is competitive with other language-learning applications, but even still, users can learn as many languages as they want without paying for a premium subscription. This makes the app incredibly valuable for most iPad owners.\nXbox Game Pass and other cloud gaming apps\nThough the idea of using Microsoft software on Apple hardware might be incomprehensible to some, it is not unprecedented. The Xbox 360 did, after all, have compatibility with Apple's line of iPods. Nevertheless, cloud streaming has taken gaming to a new level. Given the quality of the iPad's screen, the device is an ideal candidate for cloud gaming apps, with Xbox Game Pass being chief among them. Other cloud gaming apps to consider might be Amazon Luna, Nvidia's GeForce Now, and Boosteroid.\nNone of them have iPadOS apps though, owing to Apple restrictions, which means all of these are technically web apps. You've to use them via Safari. For Xbox Cloud Gaming, head to Xbox.com/play, Amazon.com/Luna for Amazon Luna, play.GeForceNow.com for GeForce Now, and cloud.Boosteroid.com for Boosteroid. Once you've arrived at the app of your choice, hit the Share button in Safari and tap on Add to Home Screen. This way, you can quickly access it going forward.\nCloud gaming makes it possible for gamers to play their favorite games over the internet without the need for dedicated gaming hardware or local game installations. While technology is not for everyone, it does open up a world of possibilities. Instead of playing games off traditional hardware, cloud gaming shifts the processing and rendering tasks to powerful remote servers that handle the tasks.\nThose looking to game over the cloud will need a strong internet connection for the best possible experience, but it allows for devices like the iPad to accommodate almost any game. Best of all, gaming over the cloud means saving hundreds of gigabytes, so those who plan to use their iPad for business purposes can also use it as a gaming device without having to commit valuable storage to it as a gaming device."

      "text": "What Do The Random Emojis Mean On Waze?\nThough most smartphones come preloaded with some sort of GPS navigational app like Google Maps, it's not necessarily going to be the best option available. Third parties have been working on perfecting navigation apps since our phones replaced MapQuest, giving rise to Google and Apple Maps competitors like Waze. Though there are quite a few similarities between Google Maps and Waze, and understandably so as Google owns Waze, users may find themselves more attracted to the playful and bubbly aesthetic, expansive community, and user-friendly driving features that Waze offers.\nWaze arguably handles navigation better than Google, providing instant route updates when slowdowns lie ahead, but Google Maps offers more information about specific destinations, such as user reviews and business contact details. To make up for its minor shortcomings, Waze also offers a more engaging interface that utilizes a modern staple to warn of potential hazards and indicate nearby Waze users: cute, cartoonish emojis.\nThe problem with Waze's system of icons is that there's no immediate legend, forcing users to learn the meanings ahead of time to understand what they're looking at. With the number of different emojis and symbols that may pop up on the map, it can get overwhelming and confusing. Some of the more common icons, called Moods, look more like messenger emojis and act as profile pictures to distinguish individual drivers. However, there's more to Moods and the many other emojis that may be crowding your Waze map.\nWhat are Waze Moods?\nThink of a Waze Mood as your Waze personality. As a Wazer, the official name for Waze users, you can customize your profile to display your Mood. It's not just about showcasing your actual emotional mood, though. Along with feelings like \"Joyful,\" \"Carsick,\" and \"Amused,\" your Mood icon can also be your astrological sign or certain animals. You can change these emojis on a whim via your profile, and they do show up on the Waze map for other users. The Mood emojis add to the social aspect of Waze, as they may entice another driver to click your icon and send you a message.\nIn addition to the standard Moods, Waze also allows users to choose between Sidekicks. These are more personalized than Mood emojis and typically align with a pop culture reference. For example, do you want Ray Stanz to spout off directions and other supernatural babble while your Ecto-1 car icon drives through your neighborhood? Then you'd want to activate the \"Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire\" Sidekick, which also gives you a special series of Stay Puft Mood emojis to share with other Wazers.\nThere are way too many Sidekicks to list, but if they're not coinciding with the latest theatrical releases, then they cater to niches like astrology, general gaming, zombies, and more. While neither Sidekicks nor Moods alter the navigational experience of using Waze, they can add a bit of fun to an otherwise helpful but mundane service.\nWhat are the other icons on the Waze map?\nMood emojis aren't the only icons you can expect to see on your Waze map. Unlike the personalized floating heads, these other icons serve a practical purpose and help you make decisions about the route ahead. There are 12 categories of these icons, ranging from car accidents to alerts about gas station prices. While icons will already be placed by other Wazers, you can also report hazards and other roadway issues. For example, if you pass stationary police on a highway, you can note their presence and even indicate whether they're hidden or on the opposite side of the road.\nBy making reports, you're not only helping other Wazers, but also increasing your ranking in the Waze ecosystem. Every report filed earns six points toward your Level, or map editing rank, which is more than just bragging rights. When you earn enough points to get promoted to a new rank, the range at which you can edit the map and the types of items you can edit increases. New users start at level one and can only edit up to a one-mile radius, which means you can use the web-based editor to fix misspelled street names and other simple items like setting a new business location within a mile of your own.\nAlong with setting reports, completing drives, adjusting gas prices, adding location-specific photos, updating house numbers, and other activities accumulate points. Regardless of your rank, you can always submit reports."

      "text": "3 Major Companies You Might Not Realize Are Owned By Google\nUnless you've been living under a rock, you're well aware by now how massive a company Google is. It's the most used search engine across the globe, and in the US alone, 60% of search queries are done with Google, according to Statista. Google is also many people's top choice as an email service, productivity tool, and even entertainment \u2014 think YouTube and Google TV.\nBut what you might not realize is that this tech giant is actually a lot larger. While Google killed multiple products in 2024, it still owns plenty of other companies, particularly through its holding company, Alphabet Inc. Alphabet manages the companies outside of Google's usual scope of products and services. This allows the company to venture into other industries, such as biotech research, finance, drug discovery and design, and AI robotics.\nAlthough you probably don't recognize most of Alphabet's acquired companies, there are three major brands you might be surprised to know are actually owned by Google.\nFitbit\nGoogle is primarily known for its software products: Android, Chrome, and Google Workspace, to name a few. But in recent years, it has penetrated the hardware market with all sorts of devices, too. There are the Pixel phones, Google Home smart speakers, and even Chromebook laptops. One hardware product you might not realize is owned by Google, though, is Fitbit.\nFounded in 2007 by James Park and Eric Friedman, Fitbit is designed to be a wearable product to improve your health and lifestyle in general. Fitbit models work through their multiple built-in sensors that track your body 24/7. Your Fitbit can tell you how much stress or excitement you've experienced for the day, whether your heart rate is low, and what health metrics like breathing rate and skin temperature might be affecting your well-being. On top of keeping an eye on changes in your body, Fitbits are great companions for plenty of lifestyle activities too. You can use it to help you time your workouts, play music, and even pay for your order at a restaurant.\nGoogle acquired Fitbit in 2021, and since then, it has become part of the tech giant's lineup of smart wearable devices, along with the Google Pixel Watches.\nWaymo\nDriving your car yourself has become overrated, at least for Google. That's why it came up with Waymo. Originally a self-driving car project of Google's back in the late 2000s, Waymo has been a full-blown firm under the management of Google's parent company, Alphabet, since 2016.\nToday, the brand is primarily focused on developing its proprietary autonomous driving technology, with the goal of reducing the number of accidents on the road. It does so with its public autonomous ride-hailing service, called Waymo One, the first of its kind across the world. Waymo One is available 24/7 in select cities, including San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin, with Atlanta and Miami getting coverage soon. How Waymo One works is similar to your typical human-driven ride-hailing service: just download the app and book a ride. A Jaguar I-PACE car will then pick you up in a couple of minutes \u2014 no driver required.\nAlthough it looks like magic, Waymo is powered by the seamless integration of software and hardware parts that are centered on safety. It's made up of cameras, lidar, and radar sensors and is reliant on its custom, detailed maps and artificial intelligence that provides real-time data and control. These parts help detect what a human eye can: pedestrians, cyclists, traffic lights, and even traffic signs.\nWaymo has already covered more than 20 million miles on public roads in over 15 states. Pair this with over 20 billion miles on simulated roads, and you have an experienced driver who knows exactly how to keep you safe until you reach your destination.\nWaze\nDriver or not, you're most likely familiar with Google's very own navigation tool, Google Maps. Everybody relies on it to get to their destinations, and it's become so popular that it has reached over ten billion downloads on the Play Store. Even on Apple devices, Google Maps is dubbed as the #1 app in the Navigation category, earning 4.7 stars with 6.7 million ratings.\nWith Google Maps being most people's go-to for directions, you might not realize that Google actually owns another navigation app: Waze. Yes, the app that shows you live traffic information using fun and cute icons and avatars is part of the bigger Google group. As a navigation tool, Waze has some similar functionalities to Google Maps. Between Waze and Google Maps, you can check your estimated arrival time, get real-time traffic data in case you need to reroute, and use voice navigation.\nHowever, Waze also features various new capabilities. Thanks to its community-driven approach, it's more efficient in informing you about things like crashes, speed cameras, and toll pricing. You can use Waze to see where police locations are as well. What makes Waze more fun is its gamification and social aspect. Whenever you use Waze to drive, send a report on the app, or edit the map, you'll receive corresponding points. You and your friends can even follow each other's drives in real time through the app's shareable ETA updates.\nWaze has been with Google since 2013, after the search giant bought out the company."
