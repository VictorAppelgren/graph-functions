  "title": "'Dan Da Dan' Set Phasers To Stun With Its Most Momokarun Episode Yet",
  "description": "Science Saru's bias toward Momo and Okarun's budding romance is showing.",
  "content": "After a riot of referential anime references, live-action food, and power metal exorcisms, the latest episode of Science Saru\u2018s anime adaptation of Dan Da Dan delivered the most romantic episode of the show\u2019s sci-fi meets yokai madness yet between its protagonists. You bet your ass we\u2019re going to gush about it.\n\nIn the seventh episode of Dan Da Dan season 2, \u201cFeeling Kinda Gloomy,\u201d the show picks up from the cliffhanger of its previous episode, where Okarun witnesses Momo Ayase working at a maid cafe. After being forced to go by Momo\u2019s besties Miku and Muko (and the in-universe presidents of \u201cMomokarun,\u201d the ship name of Momo and Okarun) the girls make a riot out of poking fun at Momo like any teenagers would when they ambush their friends at work. While Momo working part-time at a maid cafe came as a shock to Okarun, she later explains that she\u2019s only doing so to pay for a new phone, a gripe she\u2019s routinely remarked about since it got broken way back in the show\u2019s premiere. All the same, Miku and Muko had a ball teasing Momo on her first day, and further propel her and Okarun\u2019s romance by taking a group photo performing a \u201cmoe moe tri-beam\u201d before slipping it into his pocket.\n\nMortified, Momo tells Okarun he should head home, but ever the mild-mannered gentleman, he says he\u2019ll wait around until her shift is over to walk her home. Momo handwaves him away, worrying he\u2019ll catch a cold, and shoos him away. All the while, Momo sneaks glances at the clock as she slowly wears down in her day, wondering if Okarun has stayed true to his word. And sure enough, when Momo thought Okarun had high-tailed it back to her place (he, Jiji, and Aira are crashing at the Ayase residence now after the events of the season\u2019s opening), Okarun shows up in a huff, apologizing for being late with their group photo clutched in hand. After catching himself extending a hand to Momo to walk her home and trying to play it off like he was motioning to secure his backpack,, Momo clutches his hand, saying, \u201cain\u2019t so cold now.\u201d Now, shippers can add screenshots of the two handholding scenes to their dedicated computer files, featuring the pair timidly holding hands from a couple of episodes ago and their accidental kiss from season one.\n\nBut because Dan Da Dan is a shonen anime with shojo romance in its DNA, we got even more drama in our midst this episode with the love rectangle, including Aira\u2019s crush on Okarun and Jiji\u2019s crush on Momo. While Aira\u2019s jealousy of Momo was shelved to be handled in what\u2019s sure to be an Okarun/Aira-centric episode next week, this episode saw some trouble in paradise for the love triangle between Momo, Okarun, and Jiji.\n\nWhile Okarun and Momo were making their way back to the Ayase residence, Jiji was back at home training to get his Evil Eye possession under control. While he seemed to have his Ranma 1/2 water transformation under control, Aira spilling her boba tea on him after they both ran up to Momo triggered his transformation. Luckily, with some quick thinking and a bit of luck, Momo was able to spit water on her childhood crush, transforming him back to his usual self.\n\nWhen Jiji goes to check up on Momo, after Evil Eye choked her and ripped at her shirt, Okarun shoves him forcefully away from her, still concerned about the potential threat. It\u2019s a perfect recreation of the moment from the manga, one that has become a meme among readers, often accompanied by the caption \u201cShe good, bruh.\u201d We\u2019re sure to get our fair share of anime-flavored memes soon, now that the scene has finally been adapted so faithfully.\n\nWhat made this episode so special, beyond it cranking up the slow-burning romance between its leads, is how it\u2019s yet another example of Science Saru doing a spectacular job adapting manga creator Yukinobu Tatsu\u2019s ongoing manga. In contrast to contemporary shows that settle for a one-to-one copy-paste of manga panels and call it a day, co-directors Abel Gongora and Fuga Yamashiro embellish and add additional scenes that build on the manga, truly adapting it into the medium in every sense of the word. Not only did we have an opening montage adapting what was a few panels into a full-blown montage of Momo\u2019s workday underscored by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin\u2019s \u201cNocturne in E Flat Major,\u201d we also got a POV camera angles from Okarun\u2019s perspective as his peepers tried their hardest not to get caught gawking at Momo in her maid getup.\n\nTake past episodes showcasing the pair taking interest in each other\u2019s hobbies, with Momo throwing Ultraman poses and Okarun reading what looks like a manga of Ashita No Joe while practicing throwing punches and trying to get stronger through training with Turbo Granny and the boxing single-father alien, Peeny-Weeny, and that\u2019s how love starts, you know? We\u2019re here for the slow burn.\n\nNew episodes of Dan Da Dan air every Thursday on Crunchyroll, Netflix, and Hulu.",

      "text": "Anime adaptations often follow one of two paths. They are either a strict recreation of the manga, rigidly focused on directly transferring panels to the screen without adding the necessary elements to make it a compelling animated experience, or they are so preoccupied with being recognized as profound animated works that they rely too heavily on traditional film techniques and color grading, thereby losing the unique personality and flair that made the original work special. Rather than regurgitating an experience fans could otherwise encounter by simply reading the manga, Dan Da Dan exceeded expectations by boldly following the beat of its own drum with an anime that genuinely adapts creator Yukinobu Tatsu\u2019s ongoing manga.\nDescribing Dan Da Dan is like conveying what an okapi looks like to a schoolchild without a picture. It\u2019s an anomalous chimera in anime that meshes so many different genres that its episodes can go anywhere within the human imagination without feeling confined to just one thing. The 12-episode show follows the aftermath of school nerd Okarun and popular girl Momo Ayase clashing over whether aliens and yokai exist, only to find out they\u2019re both right. Momo gains spiritual powers, while a demon possesses Okarun, and he loses his private parts (which are magically infused). Their call to action? Retrieve Okarun\u2019s family jewels. Despite its un-serious logline, Dan Da Dan triumphs as the must-watch anime of 2024.\nWhile the show comes off as a Mad Libs shonen anime premise with hijinks abound, the anime sidesteps become power fantasy fodder without substance by marrying sci-fi, romantic comedy, and genuinely stirring drama to make a show that\u2019s nigh impossible to compare to anything that came before it.\nEach week, Dan Da Dan provided a refreshing experience, encouraging fans to set aside heated power-scaling debates to relax instead and marinate on the show\u2019s softer moments, which focus on romance and drama. Whether it is the emotionally mature slow-burn romance between the leads, which replaces contrived falling-outs with constructive and cute conversations, or the gripping backstory within its enemy-of-the-week formula, Dan Da Dan excels in all aspects. Even the show\u2019s most controversial element\u2014its depiction of risqu\u00e9 moments among the cast, including portrayals of sexual abuse often labeled as \u201cfan service\u201d in the anime community\u2014is handled with care and respect.\nWeek in and week out, Dan Da Dan\u2018s action is equally kinetic and absurd, with Okarun and Momo combating a giant crab, golden-glove-boxing aliens, and esoteric cryptids like the Flatwoods and the Loch Ness monster. While already masterful and easy to follow in Tatsu\u2019s manga, the sense of scale, weight, and choreography are elevated to even greater heights with Science Saru\u2018s flair for eccentric and provocative. The show balances its blockbuster showdowns with a captivating human drama among its leads, creating compelling angst driving the narrative. Despite the brisk pace of its intense action, charming meet-cute romance, and spellbinding drama, Dan Da Dan manages to maintain their significance within 24-minute episodes.\nDan Da Dan also stands out among its contemporaries by having a musical score that is not understated. When the anime showcases a psychedelic battle with aliens and demons, artist Kensuke Ushio cranks the show\u2019s pathos up to 11 with his inspired musical accompaniment. Chief among them is Ushio double-dipping with his club remix of Gioachino Rossini\u2019s \u201cWilliam Tell Overture.\u201d Even the show\u2019s opening theme, \u201cOtonoke\u201d by Creepy Nuts, is a catchy earworm of a bop with creative musical chop and screwing all its own.\nWhat\u2019s more, Dan Da Dan\u2018s English and Japanese voice performances\u2014often a contentious and archaic talking point among the anime community\u2014are phenomenal. If anything, circling the block on \u201cDan Da Dan Thursdays\u201d and catching A.J. Beckles and Abby Trott or Natsuki Hanae and Shion Wakayama, respectively, as Okarun and Momo adds an extra layer of texture to the characters through their unique performances. It\u2019s also a treat to listen to Mayumi Tanaka\u2019s (Monkey D. Luffy in One Piece) and Barbara Goodson\u2019s (Rita Repulsa in Power Rangers) vocal performances as Turbo Granny.\nDespite only having 12 episodes, Dan Da Dan sets the stage for a potential paradigm shift in the shonen genre, demonstrating the lengths to which creatives can push the boundaries without resorting to well-trodden stereotypes. Thankfully, unlike fellow anime game-changer Chainsaw Man, fans will not have to wait long for Dan Da Dan to ramp up from its cliffhanger ending with a second season.\nAll episodes of Dan Da Dan are streaming on Crunchyroll, Netflix, and Hulu. Season two is on the way.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "The DC Extended Universe is finally giving Marvel a run for its money\u2014something that\u2019s bound to increase now that James Gunn is running the show. The DCEU\u2019s myriad projects stretch far beyond superhero mainstays Batman, Superman, and the Justice League, promising to include new and interesting takes on DC Comics\u2019 enormous stable of characters.\nWhat follows is an up-to-date list of everything DCEU-related that\u2019s on the way: DC movies heading to theaters, as well as DC streaming movies and shows coming to Max.\nLast updated 8/23/2023.\nWhat\u2019s the next DC Movie?\nAquaman and the Lost Kingdom\nRelease date: December 20 (in theaters)\nDirector James Wan returns for the next adventure following Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) as the newly crowned King of Atlantis. Now in his new role, Arthur will explore more of the world under the sea while also dealing with new threats from Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and others. Like Shazam 2, Aquaman 2 has endured its share of release-date changes, with its new Christmas 2023 date designed to give Wan and company ample time to complete all the necessary special effects.\nUpcoming DC Movie Release Dates\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\nRelease date: October 4, 2024 (in theaters)\nTodd Phillips never saw his Joker movie as anything but a singular film. But over a billion dollars at the box office and an Oscar for Best Actor (for star Joaquin Phoenix) obviously changed things. We have a few nuggets of info so far: the title is Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux(French for \u201cshared madness\u201d), Phoenix is returning and will co-star with Lady Gaga (who\u2019s playing Harley Quinn), Zazie Beetz is probably returning as Arthur Fleck\u2019s neighbor, and\u2026 it\u2019s likely going to be a musical? Filming wrapped in early April 2023.\nThe Batman 2\nRelease date: 2025 (in theaters)\nHot off the success of Matt Reeves\u2019 long-awaitedThe Batman, everyone involved made it clear that wasn\u2019t a one-and-done. Robert Pattinson\u2019s Batman will be back. Will he face off with the Joker? It\u2019s possible but not definitive. You\u2019d imagine the Penguin and Catwoman could be back too. We don\u2019t know much yet about this one, but we do know it won\u2019t be arriving until 2025.\nCurrent DC Shows\nDoom Patrol Season 4, Part 2\nRelease date: TBD 2023 (on Max)\nThe fourth and final season of Doom Patrol\u2014starring Brendan Fraser, Matt Bomer, Diane Guerrero, April Bowlby, Joivan Wade, Timothy Dalton, Skye Roberts, and Michelle Gomez\u2014already aired its first batch of episodes; the remaining six will return later this year.\nUpcoming DC Movies and Shows Without Release Dates\nThe Penguin\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nYou saw him in The Batman and now, Colin Farrell\u2019s Penguin is getting his own Max series. As of April 2023, the show is in production, with a cast that also includes Cristin Milioti, Rhenzy Feliz, Michael Kelly, Shohreh Aghdashloo, and Deirdre O\u2019Connell, with Clancy Brown and Michael Zegen recurring.\nPeacemaker Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nFrom the instant that opening credits scene rolled for the first time, DC fans and non-fans alike fell in love with Peacemaker. Well, he\u2019s coming back, still played by John Cena and still from the twisted mind of James Gunn. There\u2019s no word on when it\u2019ll happen but we\u2019re guessing 2024.\nSuperman: Legacy\nRelease date: July 11, 2025\nJames Gunn will write and direct this Superman movie, which is touted as not being an origin story. Casting announcements started with Clark Kent/Superman and Lois Lane, who\u2019ll be played by David Corenswet and Rachel Brosnahan. We also know Isabela Merced will play Hawkgirl, Edi Gathegi is Mister Terrific, and Nathan Fillion is a Green Lantern (Guy Gardner), as well as Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho.\nMore Upcoming DC Movies and Shows Announced for the Gunn/Safran Era\nThe shake-up at DC Studios got a huge zap of energy at the end of January, when James Gunn and Peter Safran announced their massive slate of planned projects. Little is known about most of these projects so far in terms of cast and crew and even release dates\u2014but we do have a few tidbits for each.\nCreature Commandos (An animated Max show) \u2013 A seven-episode animated series written by James Gunn himself. It stars Indira Varma (Obi-Wan Kenobi, Game of Thrones) as the Bride, who\u2019s the lead character, and Marvel veteran Frank Grillo as Rick Flagg Sr.\u2014father of Rick Flagg, played by Joel Kinnaman in The Suicide Squad. The rest of the cast includes David Harbour (Stranger Things) as Eric Frankenstein, Sean Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) as G.I. Robot, Zoe Chao (The Afterparty) as Nina Mazursky, Alan Tudyk (Star Wars: Rogue One) as Dr. Phosphorus, Maria Bakalova (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) as new character Princess Ilana Rostovic, and Peacemaker\u2019s Steve Agee and Sean Gunn returning as John Economos and Weasel, respectively.\nWaller (A live-action Max show) \u2013 Viola Davis will reprise her Suicide Squad character; the story will bring back characters from the Peacemaker show and tell a story with events set between Peacemaker seasons one and two.\nLanterns (A live-action Max show) \u2013 Set on Earth, this mystery series will follow Hal Jordan and John Stewart doing their thing as DC\u2019s \u201csuper cops.\u201d\nThe Authority (Theatrical film) \u2013 The Wildstorm superhero characters will make their big-screen debut in a film co-written by Gunn.\nParadise Lost (A live-action Max show) \u2013 How did Wonder Woman\u2019s world, Themyscira, come to be? Find out in this Game of Thrones-ish tale set before her birth.\nThe Brave and the Bold (Theatrical film) \u2013 Based on the acclaimed Grant Morrison comic run, this will explore the story of Batman\u2019s son, Damien Wayne, and will feature \u201cother members of the extended Bat-family.\u201d\nBooster Gold (A live-action Max show) \u2013 The \u201closer from the future\u201d superhero character gets his own series.\nSupergirl: Woman of Tomorrow (Theatrical film) \u2013 Based on Tom King\u2019s comics run, this movie will explore how Supergirl is different from Superman. It\u2019s not yet certain if Sasha Calle, who plays Supergirl in The Flash, will reprise the role here.\nSwamp Thing (Theatrical film) \u2013 The character\u2019s \u201cdark origins\u201d will be the focus of this one. DC does horror! Rumored but not yet confirmed to be directing, James Mangold (Indiana Jones 5) told Collider that he\u2019s slated to write the script.\nUpcoming DC Movies and Shows That Were Once in Development, But Whose Fate Is Unclear in the Gunn/Safran Era\nTa-Nehisi Coates and J.J. Abrams\u2019 Superman movie\nRelease date: Unknown (in theaters)\nThe news of Superman: Legacy cast uncertainty on this project from writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and producer J.J. Abrams. There hadn\u2019t been an update on this one in a while, but in late April, James Gunn himself told io9 that the two films don\u2019t necessarily cancel each other out: \u201cThat\u2019s an exciting movie \u2026 if it comes in and it\u2019s great \u2026 and if the timing is right, that could absolutely happen. That\u2019s totally unrelated. It would be an Elseworlds tale like Joker.\u201d\nMichael B. Jordan Superman Series\nRelease date: Unknown (for Max)\nMichael B. Jordan was once developing a Superman take for Max as a limited series that would feature Val-Zod as opposed to Clark Kent. Again, there hasn\u2019t been an update in a while.\nStatic Shock\nRelease date: Unknown\nPart of the relaunch of the Milestone comic brand is this adaptation produced by, once again, Michael B. Jordan. A writer was hired back in 2021 to come up with a script and we haven\u2019t heard much since.\nJustice League Dark\nRelease date: Unknown (for Max)\nJ.J. Abrams was among the people involved with bringing this evil super-team to life and while there hasn\u2019t been a ton of movement on the project of late, it\u2019s been around long enough that we\u2019d imagine it happens eventually.\nMetal Men\nRelease date: Unknown\nOne of the more recent pre-Gunn/Safran DC films to go into development, this is this tale of six beings based on various powerful metals. It\u2019s from directors Ron Clements and John Musker (Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and Moana), so if it happens, it\u2019ll have an incredible pedigree.\nZatanna\nRelease date: Unknown\nLast year, Emerald Fennell won an Oscar for writing Promising Young Woman. She followed that up landing the job to write this DC superhero flick about the young magician. Like most of the films in this section, there hasn\u2019t been movement in a while.\nHourman\nRelease date: Unknown\nYes, the hero who takes a drug that makes him a hero for an hour was, back in 2021, rumored to be in development. Whether or not that\u2019s still the case is unknown but we figured it was worth noting.\nUntitled Arkham Show\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nIn addition to The Penguin, Matt Reeves has said he plans to expand the world of The Batman into Max shows. At one point, a series about Gotham PD was in the works, but now he says it might be more about the inner workings at Arkham Asylum. On October 25, The Staircase\u2019s Antonio Campos came aboard as a writer\u2014the third to hold that position on the potential series so far\u2014and may direct and serve as showrunner if the show happens, according to a report in Variety.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "Anime has had a storied relationship with making food look more appealing than in real life. The most prominent example of this is the legendary Studio Ghibli, which has made a career of putting painstaking work into creating its fluid animation of food, practically wafting smoke from behind the screen and beckoning viewers to lean in closer. Dan Da Dan, ever the rebel, has opted for the opposite route in its latest episode by going full live action with its culinary flex.\nIn the fifth episode of the second season of Dan Da Dan, titled \u201cWe Can All Stay There Together,\u201d Okarun, Momo, and their crew continue a tradition made famous by One Piece. After a harrowing battle, they celebrated their hard-earned victory with a feast of delicious foods. This victory involved stopping a raging volcano from setting fire to a nearby village and capturing Evil Eye, who resides in Jiji Enjoji\u2019s body. The otherwise pretty chill episode\u2019s biggest plot development is the discovery that Jiji and Evil Eye switch personalities whenever cold water is poured on him, reminiscent of Ranma 1/2 (which Dan Da Dan references explicitly by having him sing the original anime\u2019s theme song).\nHowever, we\u2019re not here to discuss the plot. We\u2019re here to talk about food. And this episode is chock-full of it in its opening and closing moments. The first is the presentation of a stuffed-to-the-brim bowl of hot pot. Of course, when the characters interact with the communal meal, the live-action food turns into 2D before getting nommed into their mouths. Regardless, Dan Da Dan\u2018s decision to drop all pretenses and post a photo of food instead of animating it was equal parts hilarious and mesmerizing.\nIn fact, the feat was so surprising that even manga creator Yukinobu Tatsu voiced his surprise during his live Twitter reaction to the new episode. The episode doubles down on the visual gag with another live-action shot of some food in the episode\u2019s final scene as well, making it exceedingly clear that their inspired gastronomic animation decision was no fluke.\nTHE REAL LIFE PIC OF THE MARINATED CHICKEN IS SO UNHINGED AND CREEPY WTH pic.twitter.com/KvpcoylUAn\n\u2014 Hikaru \ud83d\udda4 Yoshiki (@hikayoshilover) July 12, 2025\nDan Da Dan isn\u2019t the only Netflix anime that has dipped its toe into showcasing live-action food in its episodes as of late. Cyangames Pictures\u2019 anime adaptation of horror manga The Summer Hikaru Died did so as well, though for more shock-horror purposes. Inverse to Dan Da Dan showcasing food so delicious it\u2019ll make you want to open up your food delivery app and make some knee-jerk disposable income decisions, The Summer Hikaru Died showed a jumpscare frame of marinated raw chicken to exaggerate the feeling of sticking one\u2019s hand inside their demonic, puppeteered friend\u2019s body.

      "text": "Dan Da Dan is poised to make its highly anticipated return to streaming platforms this July. Ahead of the yokai-meets-sci-fi anime series\u2019 second season, studio Science Saru and GKids have joined forces once more with Dan Da Dan: Evil Eye, a theatrical premiere featuring the first three episodes of its forthcoming season. They pick up right where the season one cliffhanger left off adapting creator Yukinobu Tatsu\u2019s ongoing manga.\nWhile the theatrical event includes an insightful interview video with its directors, io9 pierced the veil even further, chatting with Abel Gongora, the opening theme director of Dan Da Dan\u2018s first season and co-director for its upcoming season. During our conversation, Gongora reflected on the pop culture influences that inspired his creative process and his evolving role co-directing alongside longtime collaborator Fuga Yamashiro\u2014and how their shared creative vision and occasional artistic disagreements contributed to the tag-team ebb and flow of Dan Da Dan season two\u2019s early production.\nThis interview has been edited for clarity.\nIsaiah Colbert, io9: Season one ended on a suspenseful cliffhanger that left fans eager for more. Was that always the plan from the start, or did the decision evolve during production to build anticipation for season two?\nAbel Gongora: That was decided at the very beginning\u2014that\u2019s more like a script decision. They have the manga already, so they can see where they want to cut, and that was done very early in the production.\nio9: This time around, you\u2019re stepping into a co-director role instead of just handling the show\u2019s opening, which featured shadowy silhouettes and bold, Kon Ichikawa-styled typography. What led to that shift from being the opening director to the co-director for season two?\nGongara: After the opening, I started to assist [Yamashiro] also. I got involved in the project, and then I got to understand important things to know, like the characters\u2019 story. It went kind of smooth because I was already in season [one] a little bit. The production is really difficult\u2014it\u2019s a lot of work to do one season. Production thought it would be good to have two directors so the work is not too hard on the season one director. I started with all the setting designs that we had at the end of season one, then it was already decided, so I kind of slowly started [directing] in season two.\nio9: Dan Da Dan\u2019s opening theme by Creepy Nuts became an instant fan favorite and even won a couple of anime awards. The sequence features clear nods to pop culture iconography, such as Ultraman, blending bold stylistic choices with the show\u2019s unique energy. What inspired that creative direction, and do you have a personal favorite moment from its opening sequence?\nGongara: At that time, I talked with the director of season one [and] he gave me total freedom because we have worked together for a long time. He knows, more or less, my style. He just asked me to use Ultraman as a reference\u2014those silhouette pictures. He\u2019d say, \u201cAs long as you use that, it\u2019s okay. You can do whatever you want.\u201d So I started watching Ultraman and I started to find some ideas on how to use it, and I also added something extra to make another kind of scenes in the opening. We agreed we didn\u2019t want to have the normal look of the show, so it looks a little bit more like shiny fancy colors\u2014a little bit more special.\nI showed all the ideas and concepts to the director. He liked it. Then I started I started the storyboard when I got the song. I thought the song was really cool, so it was exciting to do the storyboard, because you have to feel the rhythm and find ideas according to the rhythm of the song. Yamashiro was really open to everything. It was difficult, but it was fun.\nMy favorite part is the silhouette that I did myself. And then some of the rough animation cuts that were done by one guy on the team, who is a really amazing animator. I was very happy because I asked him if he could do it on paper and pencil. The picture, like the grain of the paper, is on the screen. If you stop the frame, it has the real grain of the paper, and then the real pencil. That is something we don\u2019t do any more in animation. It\u2019s kind of like a lot of work, and I\u2019m very happy this animator did it. It turned out to be very beautiful. Also, I did the compositing at the end because I wanted to push that rough style. Yeah, those parts are my favorite in the opening.\nio9: Will season two\u2019s opening, \u201cOn My Way\u201d by AiNA THE END, follow a similar approach to using silhouettes like the first season did, or can audiences expect something entirely new meshing with the poppy sound of AiNA\u2019s song?\nGongara: It\u2019s gonna be completely different. I cannot say much, but it\u2019s gonna be really different and I\u2019m happy about it. I think it\u2019s amazing. I wanted something different, because otherwise it might look like trying to redo something that was good, and I thought that wouldn\u2019t be interesting. But yeah, you will see.\nio9: In the Evil Eye director interview, you mentioned watching and drawing heavy inspiration from horror films and Hong Kong cinema to help shape your approach to the Evil Eye arc. What films helped you nail Dan Da Dan\u2019s action-meets-horror atmosphere in season two?\nGongara: The main reference for Dan Da Dan would be Ultraman, of course. I really liked the way Hideaki Anno did the new version of Ultraman, Shin Ultraman. We also have kaiju and things like that, so I really liked Shin Godzilla and Shin Kamen Rider. There\u2019s also some common points with Kung Fu movies. They sometimes share similar storytelling, with one influencing the other. For example, like a crush-zoom on the face of a character, things like that are used a lot in both media. We try to analyze those things.\nI\u2019m also very influenced by the Alien movies. That also fits Dan Da Dan\u2018s science fiction part, and it\u2019s very scary. I think the original Alien is a really amazing film. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really a movie that mixes all this, but we try to get the ideas and general influence by watching a lot of films. I think Yamashiro-san would do that, too.\nio9: The first season was a huge visual spectacle, effortlessly shifting between horror, action, and romance with expressive animation that heightened every moment. Were there any specific scenes from the manga that pushed the studio creatively in season two? Moments where animation allowed the series to take things to another level, but proved to be a challenge to get over the finish line?\nGongara: (laughs) We are in the middle of [production] today. We are trying new things like mixing 3D sometimes to help the animators. Sometimes, we have ideas that cannot be done by traditional animation, or it would be crazy to do. We are trying to find how to use 3D in a more creative way. There\u2019s a little bit in Evil Eye, too. We are experimenting a little bit with the 3D. We also have a lot of new music in the season, and we are experimenting a little bit with the way we use it.\nio9: You\u2019ve mentioned that you and Yamashiro have worked together before, in a collaborative setting. How has the meshing of both your styles to create Dan Da Dan season two been? Has it proved to be a rough feeling-out process working through where you guys disagree creatively, or has it been a seamless transition for the two of you?\nGongara: I think, of course, [Yamashiro] has more heavy involvement because he decided all the things you can see in season one, and I tried to follow his direction. Of course, we don\u2019t agree on everything. But we have half of the season divided. It\u2019s not exactly like half-and-half. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve got the first arc, then he gets the second arc, and then I go back for the third arc, and then he\u2019s also doing something later. We share like that, but still, we are involved in both. Sometimes, he\u2019s helped me adding some storyboard parts or some ideas he had, and I\u2019d also check with him [on] colors. Things like that we need to decide because some designs might appear in both my episode and his episode. We are working all the time together.\nWe have this background where we used to work in many projects together. [We\u2019ve worked] with Masaaki Yuasa before, and we learned a lot from him. So we have similar vision. We agree on many things and our view on animation and cinema is similar. We like to push perspective and we like to push the expression of the characters, maybe more than other directors. It\u2019s kind of not too hard for both [of us], I hope. I cannot talk for him, but I think it\u2019s smooth in general.\nDan Da Dan season two premieres this July on Netflix, Crunchyroll, and Hulu. Evil Eye hits theaters across the U.S. June 6.\nWant more io9 news?

It\u2019s still a ways away, but Saru\u2019s decided to give a cryptic first look at how it plans to adapt the beloved cyberpunk tale.\nSet over haunting vocals that may end up being the anime\u2019s main theme or opening song (or both, the teaser plays through storyboards and key animation of key scenes and characters, like the Major and Batou.

Either way, he thinks this new version by Saru has the potential to be something different, and considered it \u201cthe first installment of a second generation. The original manga is quite old\u2026and I sincerely hope this will once again be an enjoyable visual experience in some form.\u201d\nLook for The Ghost in the Shell to hit sometime in 2026.

      "text": "Dan Da Dan season 2 has consecutively become the talk of the anime community online, with each passing episode becoming another grand moment in its rise to become the main character of the internet. Its latest anime feat sees the show go full death metal in a raucous exorcism.\nIn Dan Da Dan episode 6, titled \u201cWe Became A Family,\u201d Okarun, Momo, and crew are quite literally picking up the pieces from Evil Eye\u2019s sudden attack inside the Ayase house. In the previous episode, which featured the anime using live-action shots of food, the crew discovered that Evil Eye\u2019s possession of their resident goofball, Jiji Enjoji (played by Aleks Le), adheres to the rules of the Ranma 1/2 anime. If cold water touches him, he transforms into Evil Eye, and vice versa with hot water. To help circumvent this, Aira and Okarun move into the Ayase household alongside Momo and Seiko to aid in stopping Evil Eye from taking over Jiji entirely.\nThe last episode climaxed when Okarun accidentally spilled soy sauce on Jiji, prompting him to flip their table of food and transform. However, while the gang managed to diffuse the situation between the opening and closing credits of last episode and this week\u2019s, while the Ayases and their new guests begin arguing among themselves over the incident, a death metal band shows up at their front door.\nTurns out, they\u2019re the HAYASii, musicians that were name-dropped in the previous episode, who can help with exorcisms (inspired by Hayashi, musicians used in traditional Japanese theater). In typical Dan Da Dan fashion, their exorcism comes in the form of a live performance. Their musical prowess is strong enough to shake the souls of the dead despite the band not having any spiritual powers. In short, this episode adds another musical dub to Dan Da Dan\u2018s growing anime resume.\nDan Da Dan has built a career on doing the absolute most it can, and this episode is no exception. The first half of the episode features a free anime concert\u2014one that you can also watch on YouTube, allowing you to join Aira, Okarun, Momo, and Seiko in some collective headbanging.\nAccording to Japanese entertainment site Comic Natalie, HAYASii\u2019s exorcism song, \u201cHunting Soul,\u201d was written by Nagai Seiichi and produced by Ushio Kensuke. Its vocals were performed by Taniyama Kisho, who was accompanied by guitarist Marty Friedman, with drums by Chargeeeeee (yes, they have that many e\u2019s) and bass by Wakazaemon. Should their music move you to want to add it to your workout playlist, Comic Natalie says the song will be available to download on August 9th. While the song feels like it skirts the line between metal parody and a for-real anthem, vocalist Taniyama hopes fans enjoy it whether it gives them laughs or they take it as a loving homage to the genre.\n\u201cI guess you could say it\u2019s a serious joke, but when the person doing an homage or parody does it in a flippant way, the audience senses it and it puts them off,\u201d Taniyama told Comics Natalie. \u201cIt\u2019s because we\u2019re doing it seriously that people can laugh, so I think we\u2019re all proud that this song has turned out to be something that feels satisfying in line with our intentions, from the music production to the singing. For now, we\u2019ve done everything I can, so all that\u2019s left is for everyone to enjoy it.\u201d\nFor those following along with the show\u2019s dub, the official Dan Da Dan English X/Twitter account shared the English version of the raucous anthem, confirming that it was sung by Marc Hudson\u2014yes, DragonForce singer Marc Hudson!\u2014as the English voice of HAYASii\u2019s lead vocalist, Toshiro.\nWas your spirit electrified by HAYASii's soul-shaking vocals in #DANDADAN episode 18?!\nPlease welcome to the stage Marc Hudson (DragonForce) as the English voice of Toshiro, lead singer of HAYASii! \ud83c\udfa4\ud83c\udfb6 pic.twitter.com/TVp8bAGVfy\n\u2014 DAN DA DAN Anime EN (@animeDANDADANen) August 7, 2025\nAside from the rock concert spectacle, the episode still managed to coalesce Dan Da Dan\u2018s capacity for remarkable emotional beats, with Jiji begging the gang to keep Evil Eye around after hearing his tragic backstory. Between the drama and the aforementioned concert, the episode is already getting folks online misty-eyed over how its release also inadvertently serves as a touching tribute to the late Ozzy Osbourne. While the Godfather of Heavy Metal likely never knew much Dan Da Dan existed before his passing, fans are taking the anime\u2019s over-the-top tribute to the genre as an unofficial tribute to the Prince of Darkness, who passed away just weeks after Black Sabbath\u2019s farewell show on July 5.\nPure coincidence or not, it\u2019s awesome to see anime fans embracing the new it-show\u2019s nod to Heavy Metal and channeling that energy to keep Ozzy\u2019s spirit alive in their own way.\nNew episodes of Dan Da Dan air every Thursday on Crunchyroll, Netflix, and Hulu.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "Mondays and Thursdays have become red-letter days for the anime community because they allow fans to read new chapters of the megapopular ongoing shonen manga Dandadan and watch new episodes of its anime adaptation, Dan Da Dan, by Devilman Crybaby studio Science Saru.\nAs of publication, the second episode of Dan Da Dan had finally dropped on Hulu, Crunchyroll, and Netflix\u2014a shared streaming privilege, rarely employed, aimed at further bolstering the show as the new hotness in anime. Like its explosive premiere, episode two of Dan Da Dan excels in action, science fiction, and, most notably, the slow-burn romantic comedy unfolding between the odd couple protagonists Momo Ayase and Okarun. Dan Da Dan\u2018s unique flavor of shonen romance is all thanks to advice the series editor imparted to the creator when pitching the series.\nIn the lead-up to Dan Da Dan\u2018s world premiere, GKIDS announced a special theatrical screening of the anime called Dan Da Dan: First Encounter. Before experiencing Dan Da Dan\u2018s first three episodes, moviegoers were regaled by a special video interview segment with Dan Da Dan manga creator Yukinobu Tatsu, editor Shihei Lin, anime director Fuga Yamashiro, and actors Shion Wakayama (Momo Ayase) and Natsuki Hanae (Okarun). Although the exclusive interview video went a tad long and slightly scooped the visual spectacles that lie in wait, it featured insightful trivia about how Yukinobu successfully pitched Dan Da Dan that many anime fans should follow by example.\nThis was so cute! I am a fan of the show \ud83d\ude42\u2195\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/WDGLVWBxH3\n\u2014 Krystal D. Creative \u2600\ufe0f (@krystalshanelle) October 7, 2024\nAfter serving as an assistant to Chainsaw Man creator Tatsuki Fujimoto (as many new age mangaka seem to have done), he routinely pitched shonen battle series to Lin. Seeing how his fellow assistant mangaka went on to make successful series adapted into anime like Spy x Family and Hell\u2019s Paradise, it\u2019s no surprise that Yukinobu would try his luck in the same genre. However, rather than accept any of his pitches, Lin suggested Yukinobu pump the breaks on all the shonen stuff and instead brush up on reading a bunch of romance manga. While it isn\u2019t unheard of for shonen (literally translated as \u201cboys manga\u201d) to feature romantic elements, they tend to be pretty bare bones. Fortunately, the shojo genre exists and has been feeding the manga-reading masses for years.\nUnlike shonen, shojo series are manga typically geared toward a female audience and depict more nuanced explorations of personal and romantic relationships. Think shows like Fruits Basket, Kimi ni Todoke: From Me to You, and the best-selling shojo manga of all time, Nana (although it dips into the more mature sub-genre, josei). According to Yokinobu, Lin recommended he read around 100 shojo manga before he got back to him with a pitch. Evidently, Lin\u2019s shojo suggestion was the final puzzle piece Yokinobu push his shonen-meets-The X-Files series also include a budding romance between a boisterious gyaru desperately in love with the idea of meeting a stoic man like \u201950s-era actor Ken Takakura and an occult nerd who happens to share his name and demeanor.\nAll that to say, more anime fans who find themselves solely watching shonen series like Jujutsu Kaisen, My Hero Adademia, or Demon Slayer owe it to themselves to broaden their horizons and check out other genres the medium has to offer\u2014whether that is checking out more mature seinen series like Vinland Saga, diving into the sweet sorrows of josei tragedy that is Nana, or making plans to check out A Silent Voice director Naoko Yamada and Science Saru\u2019s upcoming film, The Colors Within. Animation is a wonderful genre so fans owe it to themselves to widen their palate, just like Yukinobu did in the creation of Dan Da Dan.\nWant more io9 news?

According to James Clement on an episode of the Weekly Planet podcast, both Vincent D\u2019Onofrio and Charlie Cox are set to return for the Echo series at Disney+.\nThe series was recently announced along with Ironheart, Agatha Coven of Chaos and What If season 2 as potentially moving to 2024.\nX-Men \u201897\nRelease date: Fall 2023 (On Disney+)\nThe X-Men are coming to the MCU\u2026 kinda. X-Men \u201897 is a revival of the classic \u201890s animated show, bringing back the same style, stories and yes, theme song, of the iconic series. (See more: X-Men \u201897 Looks Like a Nostalgic Blast From the Past)\nIronheart\nRelease date: 2024 (On Disney+)\nWith Tony Stark gone, the MCU needs a new super-genius inventor. Enter teenage prodigy Riri Williams (played by Dominique Thorne), who creates a brand new, ultra-advanced armored suit. Other cast members include Anthony Ramos (In the Heights) as the villain the Hood and Lyric Ross (This Is Us). Chinaka Hodge (TNT\u2019s Snowpiercer) is attached as the head writer, and Black Panther director Ryan Coogler is an executive producer alongside Marvel\u2019s Kevin Feige and others. Manny Montana (Good Girls) has joined the cast of Marvel\u2019s Ironheart in an undisclosed role as well as Han Solo himself, Alden Ehrenreich.\nAgatha: Coven of Chaos\nRelease date: Winter 2024 (On Disney+)\nThis spinoff from WandaVision will star Kathryn Hahn as her fan-favorite character Agatha Harkness. Joe Locke (Heartstopper) and Aubrey Plaza (Hahn\u2019s Parks and Recreation co-star, among her other many credits) are also in the cast, as is Patti LuPone. (A second WandaVision spin-off, this one focusing on Paul Bettany\u2019s Vision, is also reportedly in the works.)\nCaptain America: Brave New World\nRelease date: August 26, 2024 (in Theaters)\nWe\u2019ve got a new Captain America, so it was inevitable that we\u2019d be getting a new Cap movie. Anthony Mackie will appear in the title role. Harrison Ford was announced to take over the role of General Thaddeus Ross and will make his debut in this release.\nDaredevil: Born Again\nRelease date: Spring 2024 (On Disney+)\nCharlie Cox and Vincent D\u2019Onofrio will return as Daredevil and Kingpin for an 18-episode Disney+ series. Jon Bernthal has signed on to reprise his role as the Punisher. Things remain uncertain for Foggy and Karen.\nThunderbolts\nRelease date: December 20, 2024 (In theaters)\nMarvel Studios is readying a movie based on the comic Thunderbolts and director Jake Schreier has been tapped to bring it to life. This film marks the end of Phase Five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Steven Yeun (Nope) signed on for an undisclosed role\nBlade\nRelease date: February 14, 2025 (In theaters)\nDisney hasn\u2019t revealed much about this reboot of the franchise that features a badass vampire-hunter who is also a vampire, but we know that it stars two-time Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali, who also played Cornell \u201cCottonmouth\u201d Stokes in Netflix Marvel series Luke Cage. We also know Blade appeared (or at least his voice did) in the end credits of The Eternals. After losing director Bassam Tariq, who would have been the first U.S.-Pakistani person to helm a Marvel Studios film, Blade was put on pause, and its release date was shifted. But now it has a new director in place: Lovecraft Country\u2019s Yann Demange, as well as a writer in Michael Starrbury, so the September 2024 date looks ever more likely.\nDeadpool 3\nRelease date: May 3, 2024 (In Theaters)\nRyan Reynolds\u2019 \u201cmerc with the mouth\u201d is set to appear in Disney\u2019s first R-rated film following the company\u2019s completed acquisition of Fox assets. Oh, and did you happen to hear that Hugh Jackman\u2019s Wolverine is also appearing in this one? Unless you are cut off from all social media, you no doubt caught that announcement.\nDeadpool 3 writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wenick spoke with Den of Geek about how Deadpool\u2019s move to the MCU will not affect the feel of the movie. Or, in Wernick\u2019s words: \u201cDeadpool\u2019s gonna be Deadpool.\u201d Reese also said that Disney has been more than willing to ensuring the franchise keeps its core identity. Shawn Levy (Free Guy) is directing.\nFantastic Four\nRelease date: May 2, 2025 (In theaters)\nPhase Six of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, kicks off with the MCU debut of Marvel\u2019s most famous family. Jon Watts was scheduled to directbut he is no longer doing that\u2014Matt Shakaman of WandaVision is now in the chair\u2014and though we saw John Krasinski as Mr. Fantastic in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, there\u2019s no guarantee he returns.\nAvengers: The Kang Dynasty\nRelease date: May 1, 2026 (In theaters)\nSince neither Phase Four or Phase Five ended with Avengers movies, Phase Six will end with two, back to back. The first is The Kang Dynasty, a title which heavily suggests that Kang (Jonathan Majors) will play a major role. Destin Daniel Cretton (Shang-Chi) will direct.\nAvengers: Secret Wars\nRelease date: May 7, 2027 (In theaters)\nIt all comes down to this. Phase Six, and the whole Phase 4-6 arc of the Multiverse Saga, ends with Secret Wars. We don\u2019t know anything about the plot other than the comics that the title is based on; Marvel veteran Michael Waldron (Loki, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness) is writing the script.\nArmor Wars\nRelease date: Unknown (In theaters)\nThis project\u2014originally slated for a Disney+ series, but now getting the feature film treatment\u2014will follow James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) as he tracks down stolen tech that allows criminals to replicate Iron Man technology.\nAlso: Marvel slotted several other projects for Phase Six that take place alongside Fantastic Four and the Avengers films. There are two in fall 2024, two in winter 2024, one in winter 2025, two in spring 2025 and two in summer 2025. Some of those are probably\u2026\nUnscheduled But Probably Still Happening Shows & Movies\nMoon Knight Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nMoon Knight himself, Oscar Isaac, was recently spotted in Egypt and teased that a second season of his show could be on the way. Marvel and Disney have yet to confirm.\nMarvel Zombies\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nThis new animated show is loosely spun out from a breakout episode of What If? that saw MCU heroes battling a zombie apocalypse.\nSpider-Man: Freshman Year\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nDisney says this new animated series follows Peter Parker \u201con his way to becoming Spider-Man in the MCU, with a journey unlike we\u2019ve ever seen and a style that celebrates the character\u2019s early comic book roots.\u201d\nWhat if\u2026? Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nThe speculative animated series and its omnipresent narrator the Watcher will return with an all-new season. The show\u2019s creators say next season will focus on new stories, new heroes, and \u201clots of fun.\u201d Though the trailer still hasn\u2019t been released, the Marvel Animation Panel at San Diego Comic Con revealed some Phase 4 characters that will be in the show.\nUntitled Wakanda Series\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nNot much is known yet about this show set in Black Panther\u2019s home country.\nUntitled Shang-Chi sequel\nRelease date: Unknown (In theaters)\nShang-Chi\u2019s debut movie was compelling, exciting and fun. It also made a ton of money, so a sequel is inevitable. That the film\u2019s director is making Avengers: The Kang Dynasty does throw it into limbo a bit.\nUntitled Wonder Man series\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nMarvel Studios has announced that it\u2019s moving ahead with a Wonder Man series. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings director Destin Daniel Cretton is attached to helm and Brooklyn 99 writer Andrew Guest (who also produced Hawkeye) is on board to showrun the series. On October 31, the title star was announced: genre favorite Yayha Abdul-Mateen II.\nUntitled mutants movie\nRelease date: Unknown (In theaters)\nNow that Disney owns the old Fox assets that included all the \u201cmutant\u201d Marvel superheroes, you can very likely count on characters like the X-Men making an MCU debut.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "At a Glance:\nDoctor Who ended the eras of both Chris Chibnall as series showrunner and Jodie Whittaker as the 13th Doctor in 2022 with \u201cThe Power of the Doctor,\u201d bringing to a close a three-season, three-special run.\nWhittaker\u2019s replacement is returning star David Tennant. He will play the official 14th incarnation of the Doctor under returning showrunner Russell T. Davies, who revived Doctor Who in 2005 and managed the series until 2009.\nTennant will appear in three specials in November 2023 to coincide with the 60th anniversary of Doctor Who on November 23.\nHe\u2019ll be joined by returning characters Donna Noble and Wilfred Mott, who were played by Catherine Tate and Bernard Cribbins in season four of Doctor Who. Neil Patrick Harris will play a new villain, while Heartstopper\u2019s Yasmin Finney will play a character named Rose.\nTennant will be succeeded by Sex Education\u2019s Ncuti Gatwa as the 15th Doctor. His announcement in May 2022 makes him the first Black male actor to play the character on-screen.\nGatwa will star in Doctor Who\u2019s 14th season, set to air some time in 2024.\nMillie Gibson will co-star as the 15th Doctor\u2019s companion.\nGame of Thrones star Indira Varma will play a mysterious character known as \u201cthe Duchess.\u201d\nDoctor Who\u2019s beloved tradition of doing a Christmas Special\u2014no more New Year\u2019s Day Specials, in other words\u2014will return in 2023, with another confirmed for 2024.\nComedian Sooz Kempner will star in Doom\u2019s Day, a new transmedia Doctor Who campaign tied into the anniversary. She\u2019ll play Doom, the titular intergalactic assassin, who has found herself hunted by Death itself\u2014and must use a purloined vortex manipulator with a day\u2019s worth of time-jumping charge to find the Doctor and save herself.\nThis post was last updated 5/30/23.\nWhat\u2019s Been Going on in Doctor Who?\nThree Doctor Who specials aired out the last days of Jodie Whittaker\u2019s time as the Doctor in 2022. \u201cEve of the Daleks\u201d saw the Doctor and her companions Dan (introduced in the prior 13th season, known as Doctor Who: Flux) and Yaz facing the titular iconic monsters in a time loop paradox. \u201cLegend of the Sea Devils\u201d revived the classic \u201870s monsters for a new adventure, while \u201cPower of the Doctor\u201d saw the 13th Doctor face off against the Master in an adventure that ultimately saw her mortally wounded, returning her companions to contemporary Earth while she regenerated into a new body.\nWhy Is David Tennant the Doctor Again? Is David Tennant Playing the 10th Doctor?\nWhittaker regenerated not into previously announced new Doctor Ncuti Gatwa, but David Tennant, who played the official 10th incarnation of the Time Lord from Christmas 2005 to New Year\u2019s Day 2010, before reprising the role for Doctor Who\u2019s 50th anniversary special, \u201cThe Day of the Doctor,\u201d in 2013.\nWhile this marks his first return on-screen in the series since then, Tennant will not be playing the 10th Doctor, but the official 14th incarnation\u2014and the character will be aware that they are both using a familiar form and are a new entity. Aside from the fact that Tennant is arguably the most popular actor to take on the role, so bringing him back for the 60th anniversary makes sense, there\u2019s plenty of reasons Doctor Who can come up with as to why the Doctor\u2019s regenerative process decided to re-use an old identity, more of which you can read about here.\nWhen Will Doctor Who Return in 2023?\nDoctor Who will return for three special episodes in November 2023, set to air in celebration of the series\u2019 60th anniversary.\nWhat Is Doctor Who\u2019s 60th Anniversary Special About?\nAside from Tennant returning as the Doctor, he\u2019ll be joined by former companions Donna Noble and Wilfred Mott, played by Catherine Tate and Bernard Cribbins (the actor\u2019s last role prior to his passing in July 2022) in Doctor Who\u2019s fourth season. Donna exited the series as a regular character after an adventure lead to her needing to have her memory wiped by the 10th Doctor, forgetting her time alongside him lest her mind face grievous harm, so just how Donna will play into the the story remains to be seen.\nThe Doctor and Donna will face a mysterious new adversary, played by Neil Patrick Harris, and will be joined in the specials by Yasmin Finney as a new character named Rose. How Finney\u2019s Rose might connect to the other famous Rose of Doctor Who, Billie Piper\u2019s Rose Tyler, also remains to be seen.\nIs There a Trailer for Doctor Who\u2019s 60th Anniversary?\nThe first premiered at the end of \u201cThe Power of the Doctor,\u201d and you can watch it above. The second premiered in December and you can watch it here:\nWhen Will Ncuti Gatwa Become the Doctor?\nGatwa is briefly seen in the trailer for Doctor Who\u2019s 60th anniversary, so will presumably follow the long tradition of new Doctors appearing in the final moments of their predecessor\u2019s last episodes to become the 15th Doctor. The BBC has announced that Gatwa will appear as the Doctor first \u201cover the festive season\u201d in 2023, before he takes over full-time in a new season of the show after that.\nIs There a Doctor Who Season 14 Release Date?\nThere\u2019s no current release date for season 14 of Doctor Who, but it is expected to be broadcast some time in 2024.\nWhere Is Doctor Who Streaming in the U.S. and UK?\nCurrently, the first 13 seasons of the revived Doctor Who are streaming on the BBC iPlayer in the UK; in the U.S., the revived series streams exclusively on HBO Max. In both countries, episodes from the classic era of the show are available through Britbox.\nThis will change in 2023, at least in the U.S. The BBC and Disney have announced that as part of a new deal, Doctor Who will stream exclusively worldwide on Disney+, except for in the UK and Ireland, where it will still stream on the BBC iPlayer and BBC One. It\u2019s currently unknown if this will affect Doctor Who\u2019s place on BBC America, where it currently airs in the U.S..\nDoes Disney Co-Own Doctor Who Now?\nA report in the wake of the BBC/Disney announcement from British paper the Telegraph alleged that the deal will also see Disney contribute finances to help create the show, and while the series\u2019 creative team will still hold control of the series primarily, the deal will allow Disney some level of say in the creative decisions for the series\u2014as well as allowing access to talent or \u201ccinematic production moments\u201d previously inaccessible due to the BBC\u2019s budget for the show.\nNone of this has been confirmed by the BBC, however. The announcement strictly focused on Disney\u2019s acquisition of Doctor Who\u2019s streaming rights, and did not mention any co-owning. The new era of the series will be made for the BBC by Bad Wolf Studios, created by former Doctor Who producer Julie Gardner and former BBC Controller of Fiction Jane Tranter\u2014which is now owned by Sony Pictures Television, after the studio took a majority stake in Bad Wolf in December 2021. The series was previously made by BBC Studios directly.\nIn January, Davies did say that Doctor Who is now working with a bigger budget, telling GQ that Disney\u2019s involvement came about as part of \u201cthe BBC\u2019s notion to go for a streamer to invest in the show worldwide \u2026 We\u2019re not on the budget level with Star Wars and the Marvel shows, [but] it\u2019s better than it was \u2026 We\u2019re not allowed to talk about budget\u2026 but it\u2019s more than I\u2019ve ever had to work with.\u201d\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "\u201cStar Wars! Nothing but Star Wars! Give me those Star Wars! Don\u2019t let them end\u2026\u201d Just as Bill Murray said it in 1978, we\u2019re still saying it today. Star Wars is everywhere these days, with multiple movies and TV shows in the works from Disney and Lucasfilm. This article will give you the most up-to-date Star Wars release dates so you know exactly when every new Star Wars movie or Disney+ show will arrive.\nWhat are the next three movies? What TV shows are coming up? Have any TV shows or movies been canceled? What are people saying about what\u2019s next? We\u2019ve got you covered on all things in a galaxy far, far away.\nThis post was last updated on 9/13/2023.\nWhat\u2019s the next Star Wars movie?\nSharmeen Obaid-Chioy\u2019s New Jedi Order Film Film\nRelease Date: TBD, but May 26, 2026, December 18, 2026 or December 17, 2027 (In Theaters)\nAt Star Wars Celebration 2023 in London, Lucasfilm announced that three Star Wars movies are now in the works.\nJames Mangold (Indiana Jones 5) will direct a film 25,000 years before any known Star Wars timeline about the first Jedi to use the Force.\nDave Filoni will direct a film that\u2019s kind of the Star Wars Disney+ Avengers, telling the story of a climactic event meeting the stories of The Book of Boba Fett, The Mandalorian, Ahsoka and more in the time between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens.\nAnd Sharmeen Obaid-Chioy will direct a film set 15 years after the events of The Rise of Skywalker following Rey (Daisy Ridley) as she creates a New Jedi Order.\nThis last one, we think, is the film that Damon Lindelof (Lost, The Leftovers, Watchmen) was co-writingwith Justin Britt-Gibson before departing the project. Steven Knight is now reportedly writing.\nA week after the news of these films first broke, it began to seem like the Rey project by Obaid-Chioy could be the first one out of the gate. However, in June, Disney shuffled its release schedule and moved its December 2025 Star Wars movie to May 2026, and added a third Star Wars movie to the schedule in December 2026. So maybe these three movies are on those dates. We\u2019ll see.\nUpcoming Star Wars release dates\nThese shows and movies have all been officially announced and are in various stages of production, even if we don\u2019t know when they will definitely come out.\nStar Wars: Ahsoka\nRelease Date: Now Playing (On Disney+)\nThe first full live-action Ahsoka Tano show from co-creator Dave Filoni is finally here. Rosario Dawson is, of course, returning. And our first look at footage confirmed that actress Natasha Liu Bordizzo has been cast as Sabine Wren; more recently, Eman Esfandi was confirmed as Ezra Bridger. At Star Wars Celebration this year we learned Mary Elizabeth Winstead is playing Hera Syndulla, Lars Mikkelsenis playing Grand Admiral Thrawn and Wes Chatham is his right-hand man.\nWhat does that all mean? Well, in the first teaser trailer, you can see she\u2019ll make good onthe Star Wars Rebels finale and go after Thrawn. And what about the fact she knows Luke Skywalker now? And how does Ray Stevenson\u2019s lightsaber-wielding character fit in?\nThe show is now airing on Disney+ and here you can read our weekly recaps:\nEpisode 1, \u201cMaster and Apprentice: and Episode 2, \u201cToil and Trouble\u201d\nEpisode 6, premiering September 19\nEpisode 7, premiering September 26\nEpisode 7, premiering October 3\nStar Wars: Skeleton Crew\nRelease Date: 2023 (On Disney+)\nCreated by Spider-Man Homecoming/Far From Home/No Way Home director Jon Watts along with writer Chris Ford, this mystery Star Wars show is now currently in development. The title for the show was released during the Star Wars Celebration, and was previously internally referred as \u201cGrammar Radio.\u201d Celebration also revealed its headlining star, Jude Law.\nSet after the events of Return of the Jedi, Skeleton Crew is described as an adventure in the mold of Amblin adventures of the 1980s. The show will be about seeing the galaxy through the eyes of children (but it is not a kids show), and will follow a group of children who get lost in the galaxy and try to find their way home. Jon Watts explained that the series will take place during the same time period as the upcoming Ahsoka series and The Mandalorian.\nFilming on the series began in 2022 and ended in early 2023. And though not much is know about what happens on the show,it has been revealed that The Daniels, the Oscar-winning directors of Everything Everywhere All At Once, directed an episode. Ditto David Lowery, who did the film The Green Knight. Read more about the show here.\nio9 saw the first footage at Star Wars Celebration 2023 and you can read about it here. Three of the main stars of the show are played by Ravi Cabot-Conyers, Kyriana Kratter, and Robert Timothy Smit. Rumors suggest it could debut in November or December 2023.\nStar Wars: The Acolyte\nRelease Date: 2024 (On Disney+)\nRussian Doll co-creator Leslye Headland will be the first person to bring the excellent High Republic timeline into live-action with this show, long rumored to star Amandla Stenberg before an actual confirmation finally arrived at San Diego Comic-Con 2022\u2014one of few Star Wars bits of news to emerge from the convention.\nIn an interview in 2022, Headland revealed the show would be about 100 years before the events of The Phantom Menace. \u201cA lot of those characters haven\u2019t even been born yet,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a look at the political and personal and spiritual things that came up in a time period that we don\u2019t know much about. My question when watching The Phantom Menace was always like, \u2018Well, how did things get to this point?\u2019 How did we get to a point where a Sith lord can infiltrate the Senate and none of the Jedi pick up on it? Like, what went wrong? What are the scenarios that led us to this moment?\u201d\nIn an interview released later, Headland spoke about her goals for the series. For Headland, above all else The Acolyte is a mystery, and that mystery is figuring out what is going on in this peak period. It was also suggested that The Acolyte will bring more elements from the Expanded Universe to canon, but what parts that will be incorporated will remain to be seen.\nIn September 2022, both Jodie Turner-Smith and Squid Game\u2019s Emmy-winning Lee Jung-Jae joined the cast, with an official announcement in November adding Carrie-Anne Moss, Manny Jacinto, and others to the roster. The first image, which you see above, was released in November and you can read about the first footage here, which was shown at Star Wars Celebration 2023.\nAnd no, despite what bullcrap rumors you may have been reading online, the show has not been canceled.\nAndor: Season 2\nRelease Date: August 2024 (On Disney+)\nSeason one of Tony Gilroy\u2019s Rogue One prequel starring Diego Luna showed an excitingly different side of Star Wars. Season two will reportedly be spread across the four years leading up to Rogue One, with four episodes covering each year in Cassian Andor\u2019s life until that fateful point. Filming began in late 2022.\nAt Star Wars Celebration 2023, Gilroy announced the show should be out in August 2024 and showed fans the first footage from the season. Read about it here. Plus, the final episodes of the season/series will take place just days before Rogue One, leading right into that story.\nOne minor hiccup though, due to the Writer\u2019s Guild strike, showrunner and head writer Tony Gilroy left his duties show in May 2023. He\u2019s unlikely to return until the Writer\u2019s Strike is over, which could cause a delay.\nStar Wars: A Droid Story\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nLucasfilm Animation is teaming up with Industrial Light and Magic for this streaming show that will \u201cintroduce us to a new hero, guided by legendary duo R2-D2 and C-3PO.\u201d We don\u2019t know anything beyond that and there hasn\u2019t been a significant update in years, which could be a good thing or bad thing.\nStar Wars: Lando\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nWay back in December 2020, Disney announced a bunch of Star Wars TV shows. Among them was a Lando show which, at the time, was going to be made by Dear White People creator Justin Simien. After that, things went quiet for about three years. Then,in an April 2023 article, Donald Glover hinted that he\u2019s still interested and it\u2019s still possible in the works. A May 2023 interview with Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy confirmed it\u2019s still in the works.\nThe first significant update in almost three years came in July when news broke that Simien has been off the project since he started working on Haunted Mansion, and not only is Donald Glover going to star in the series, he\u2019s co-writing it with his brother Stephen.\nUntitled Taika Waititi Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nIn May 2020, news broke that Oscar-winning director of Thor: Ragnarok would be helming and co-writing along with Krysty Wilson-Cairns. \u201cTaika\u2019s approach to Star Wars will be fresh, unexpected, and \u2026 unique,\u201d Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said. \u201cHis enormous talent and sense of humor will ensure that audiences are in for an unforgettable ride.\u201d\nThere was a time when this was likely to be the next Star Wars film but, after Star Wars Celebration 2023, it seems like it\u2019s now on the back burner. That was confirmed by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy who said the Oscar-winner is still working on the film, it\u2019s just going slowly.\nIn the past, Waititi has discussed some broad ideas of what he wants to do with his upcoming film. Read those below.\nTaika Waititi Doesn\u2019t Want Star Wars to Rely on Legacies\nAre You as Confused About Taika Waititi\u2019s Star WarsMovie as We Are?\nUntitled Dave Filoni Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nWe mentioned this one above but, at some point, Dave Filoni will be directing a film that is meant to be a climactic event wrapping up stories that have begun on shows he\u2019s involved with such as The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, The Book of Boba Fett, Skeleton Crew and others.\nUntitled James Mangold Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nThis was one of the three films announced at Star Wars Celebration but, like Filoni\u2019s, isn\u2019t likely to be next. This one is set 25,000 years before the original trilogy and tells the story of the first person to use the Force.\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s about, I want to be part of the saga, but I also don\u2019t want to be holding so much lore in the air that you can hardly tell a story,\u201d Mangold told io9 when asked about this film. \u201cAnd what I really wanted to do\u2026was just can we make a kind of the Ten Commandments of the Force, you know? A kind of origin story of how the Force came to be known, understood, wielded, and harnessed.\u201d We love this idea so much we even wrote about it.\nStar Wars Movies and TV Shows That Are Currently Unscheduled and Haven\u2019t Been Officially Announced, But We Think Are Still Happening\nThe Mandalorian Season 4\nRelease Date: TBD\nWith The Mandalorian Season 3 now in the books, all eyes look ahead to season 4. However, the season has not yet been officially announced. Unofficially though, series creator Jon Favreau said he\u2019s already written a fourth season which he probably wouldn\u2019t have done just for fun. It\u2019s coming. It\u2019s just a matter of when, especially with writers and actors on strike.\nThe Book of Boba Fett Season 2\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nThe Book of Boba Fett season one ended with the implication that we\u2019d see more of these character in the future. But alas, there has been no official announcement\u2026 yet. Dive into the making-of season one while we wait and ponder the words of executive producer Robert Rodriguez who said he knows when the character is coming back, but he can\u2019t say when.\nUntitled Shawn Levy Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nShawn Levy, the prolific director and producer behind Stranger Things, Night at the Museum, and Free Guy is gearing up to develop a film in a galaxy far far away. He\u2019ll focus on that after completing Deadpool 3, which stars Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman.\nStar Wars Movies and TV Shows That Are Currently Unscheduled and Probably NOT Going To Happen\nStar Wars: Rangers of the New Republic\nOriginally announced alongside shows like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ahsoka, and Andor, Rangers of the New Republic was rumored to be Cara Dune\u2019s show which would tie into The Mandalorian and Book of Boba Fett. However, with actress Gina Carano no longer a part of Star Wars, word on the street is this will no longer be happening. Nothing is official though.\nUntitled Rian Johnson Trilogy\nLet\u2019s be honest. Do we think this is happening anymore? Probably not. Rian Johnson has moved on to other things. But, until we hear otherwise (and no one is officially saying), we\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t mention that before the divisive release of The Last Jedi, Lucasfilm officially said Johnson would make his very own trilogy. It hasn\u2019t officially been canceled yet but, in a new interview, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy suggested that it\u2019s been placed on the back burner as Johnson does other things. With Johnson\u2019s next film, Glass Onion, set for release in late 2022 though, he\u2019s been quoted saying he still hopes these movies happen. So do we.\nStar Wars: Rogue Squadron\nFor several years, Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins\u2019 film about pilots in the Star Wars universe has been earmarked as the next film. Well, that\u2019s no longer the case. After months of rumors suggesting it might move off its 2023 release date, Disney officially took it off the schedule. On December 13 2022, Jenkins said the movie is still in \u201cactive development\u201d but recent news suggests it\u2019s dead. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy disagrees, saying in May 2023 it\u2019s still on the books.\nUntitled Kevin Feige Movie\nMarvel Studios President Kevin Feige is best known for helping create the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But as much as he loves Marvel, he loves Star Wars even more. And so it was exciting to hear that he was producing a Star Wars movie and even recruited Loki and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness writer Michael Waldron to help him. Feige doesn\u2019t like to even acknowledge this project though and in a 2022 interview, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy also tiptoed around the project\u2019s existence. Then, a few weeks before Star Wars Celebration 2023, we learned the project is likely dead.\nFor more, check out io9\u2019s list of every canceled (or re-worked) Disney Star Wars project.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "When Dan Da Dan hit streaming platforms last fall, it wasted no time becoming the Johnny-come-lately must-watch anime of the year. With an absolute bop of an opening theme, a seamless blend of comedy, sci-fi action, palpable slow-burn romance, and evocatively bouncy and expressive animation, Science Saru\u2019s off-kilter anime quickly became the standout of 2024. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that the series recently won some Crunchyroll Anime Awards, adding to its growing acclaim and cementing its place as a fan favorite in a year of exceptional anime.\nAccolades aside, it\u2019d be remiss not to note that Dan Da Dan\u2018s first season also left fans hanging in the most excruciating way possible\u2013cutting to black right at the brink of its next big arc. Thankfully, the sting of that cliffhanger didn\u2019t last long, as the series was swiftly renewed for a second season. Now, GKids and animation studio Science Saru are teaming up once again to bring Dan Da Dan: Evil Eye to the big screen\u2013a theatrical preview featuring the first three episodes of the new season. While the film introduces some new annoying pacing quirks typical of anime compilation releases, Evil Eye still sets the stage for an anime that continues to push boundaries with breathtaking animation, high-energy action, and emotionally charged storytelling. If its momentum holds beyond what Evil Eye showed us, season 2 is gearing up to exceed expectations when it premieres this July.\nEvil Eye picks up right after the events of Dan Da Dan Season 1, with Okarun, Momo Ayase, and Jiji Enjoji diving into the mystery surrounding Jiji\u2019s cursed family home. Their investigation uncovers not just one, but two terrifying forces lurking in Byakuja Village: a monstrous worm kaiju that emits blinding light, driving its victims to the brink of self-destruction, and the Evil Eye\u2013a sinister yokai that grants Jiji immense power akin to Okarun\u2019s, but at the cost of his self control. As if these threats weren\u2019t enough, the trio must also contend with the Kito family, a chilling cult with jaundiced-eyed martial artists, responsible for generations of child sacrifices, believing it\u2019s kept the village protected from calamities.\nEvil Eye preserves Dan Da Dan\u2019s signature eccentricity, seamlessly blending horror and comedy with razor-sharp precision. One moment, Momo is locked in a harrowing battle with the Kito family, evoking the eerie menace that is characteristic of Junji Ito\u2019s work. Next, she\u2019s turning the tables in a bare-knuckle brawl straight out of a kung fu flick. Whether delivering tension or laughs, the film nails its timing, utilizing direction that goes beyond simple stylistic gimmicks to embrace anime\u2019s unique storytelling strengths fully. With dynamic flourishes reminiscent of a YouTuber\u2019s fast-paced editing, Evil Eye sharpens its emotional impact, drawing attention to key details, leaning into meme-like framing, and amplifying each heartfelt moment through swelling music and abstract, painterly animation. The result is a story that lingers long after the credits roll.\nOne of Dan Da Dan\u2018s greatest strengths is its ability to add depth and texture to its cryptids and yokai\u2014rather than using tragic backstories as fleeting emotional bait, it ensures they resonate beyond mere shock value. While many contemporary anime lean into dramatic pasts only to quickly abandon them for the next big arc, Evil Eye fully embraces the complexity of its supernatural elements, elevating them beyond surface-level tragedy.\nA prime example is its treatment of Jiji and his connection to the titular Evil Eye. Much like the series did with Acro Silky and Aira Shiratori, it takes a character once framed as comic relief and enriches them with poignant storytelling, recontextualizing Jiji\u2019s class clown nature while giving emotional weight to Evil Eye itself. Instead of feeling like a disposable antagonist, the entity becomes a compelling force within the narrative, allowing its presence to linger in a way that feels more poetic than performative. And Jiji isn\u2019t the only one stealing the show\u2013Turbo Granny delivers some fantastic spit-take comedy as the group\u2019s petulant babysitter, Momo lands devastating kicks, and Okarun shines with his signature cool-guy monologues, complete with an unmistakable JoJo\u2019s reference.\nEvil Eye is the latest proof that Dan Da Dan is anime\u2019s ultimate genre chameleon, effortlessly shifting tones and styles in an instant. This time, it leans deeper into its horror roots, channeling the eerie tension of a Takashi Miike thriller with razor-sharp timing between terror and comedy. But Evil Eye doesn\u2019t just pay homage to horror\u2013it pushes the boundaries of Yukinobu Tatsu\u2019s ongoing manga, elevating its cinematic flair and expanding the chaos to thrilling new heights. Visually, Evil Eye redefines familiar anime techniques. Impact frames take on a hypnotic, lava lamp-like fluidity, while fight choreography moves effortlessly between close-quarters intensity and exhilarating free-running sequences.\nEvil Eye does many things well, serving as a teaser for what\u2019s to come, but it falls into a familiar trap for anime compilation films\u2014padding the runtime. Instead of jumping straight into its horror-thriller setup, it lingers too long on a highlight reel of past episodes, making the early moments feel more like promotional material than an organic transition into the new season.\nWhile neat in theory, this approach dulls the impact of what should feel like a feature-length event. Other GKIDS releases have excelled at diving right into the action, but Evil Eye takes nearly 20 minutes to commit, with an additional 10-minute interview with co-directors Fuga Yamashiro and Abel Gongora sandwiched at the end, further stretching out the experience in disengaging ways where a director interview would have sufficed. This echoes a past misstep from Dan Da Dan\u2019s previous theatrical promo, where behind-the-scenes footage was put at the start of the film, with a majority of its \u201chow the sausage is made\u201d segments spoiling major reveals before audiences even knew what they were in store for. A mistake GKids had been good about not repeating with its other anime preview films!\nWhile the nostalgia is appreciated, it hasn\u2019t been that long since the series aired, and the extended recap feels more like unnecessary filler than a seamless setup. As a result, instead of thrusting audiences straight back into its cliffhanger momentum, Evil Eye slows things down, making its start feel more like a drawn-out warm-up than a thrilling leap into the next chapter.\nOf course, it wouldn\u2019t be Dan Da Dan without another cliffhanger; them\u2019s the breaks with anime compilation preview films. But beyond these minor frustrations, Evil Eye takes bold, creative strides, upping the ante for anime adaptation in a way only Science Saru can. Once defined by its punchy, vibrant colors, Evil Eye teases how the show will go beyond briefly winking at other genres by fully leaning into a dynamic approach to fully manifesting their foundations and aesthetics, further solidifying Dan Da Dan\u2019s ever-evolving identity. Hopefully, that momentum will carry on beyond its opening stretch in new and galaxy-brained ways when the series makes its grand return.\nDan Da Dan season 2 premieres this July on Netflix, Crunchyroll, and Hulu. Evil Eye hits theaters across the U.S. June 6.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "Although the winter anime season is in full swing, most anime fans are still riding the high from last year\u2019s slate of shows\u2014key among them being the first-ballot anime of the year contender Dan Da Dan. Immediately following its cliffhanger season finale, animation studio Science Saru revealed that fans won\u2019t have to hold their breath for long, as a second season is set to premiere in July 2025.\nTo tide folks over as they contemplate reading ahead in the manga, io9 spoke with director Fuga Yamashiro to pick his brain about the challenges of anime adaptations, Momo Ayase and Okarun\u2019s budding romance, and how he and his team brought Yukinobu Tatsu\u2019s wacky ongoing manga to life.\nIsaiah Colbert, io9: Anime adaptations often settle for being a one-for-one recreation of manga panels rather than taking risks beyond being an exact copy of its source material. What was your guiding principle for directing Dan Da Dan?\nFuga Yamashiro: I wanted to avoid having the anime compared to the manga, so I tried sort of rebuilding Dan Da Dan with a different approach from the manga whenever possible. What I mean is, making animation is a group process, so I was trying always to change the field we were playing on, to dodge turning it into a \u201cwhich has the better art\u201d contest. But at the same time, it was necessary to replicate the impression the manga gives, so I put effort into capturing the impactful panels from the manga I assumed everyone wanted to see\u2014the really cool panels, the spreads, etc.\nio9: What are some of your favorite moments when deviating from the manga to create additional scenes/changes in the anime?\nYamashiro: I think the base is the manga, but a lot of the styles and techniques used are exclusive to the medium of anime. I didn\u2019t change this simply because I wanted to change things, but rather because manga and anime are different mediums. You need to translate what\u2019s depicted in manga into anime form in order to give anime viewers the same impression manga readers had. Anime is different from manga, which you can read at your own pace, in that each frame is assigned a specific amount of time. So I paid a lot of attention to the details and adjusted things as necessary to stay close to the idea of Dan Da Dan that readers of the manga had.\nio9: What has been your favorite sequence to animate for Dan Da Dan, and why?\nYamashiro: The crab chase scene in episode four. It really captures the freedom and energy of animation, and also marks the first time Momo and Okarun work together from a dramatic standpoint. They\u2019re in perfect harmony for the first time, completing the buddy unit. There\u2019s a real catharsis in that drama, and it links really well with the energy on screen. A ton of effort was put into the scene in every way\u2014human drama, visuals, and music\u2014and it feels dramatic, but also optimistic. The atmosphere I was aiming for in Dan Da Dan, the relationship between Momo and Okarun in episodes 1-4, it\u2019s all distilled in this scene where they work together.\nBy the way, before they take off, Okarun takes Momo\u2019s hand, and helps her stand up. This isn\u2019t supposed to be comedic, but rather this marks the first time they purposefully touch each other. They\u2019re not really aware of it, but it\u2019s almost like a handshake. I think that\u2019s super dramatic and cool.\nio9: Dan Da Dan stands out by having a filmmaker\u2019s approach to framing and depicting action through first-person point-of-view scenes or villains just out of frame. Where does that direction stem from? Is it a result of standing out from your contemporaries with adapting works, or is it simply taking inspiration from different mediums\u2019 approaches to storytelling?\nYamashiro: I hoped to have visuals and scenes with real direction to them, not just simple paper dolls on screen. As for the reason the camera is so often at around human height and not too high up, it\u2019s to make the audience feel like they\u2019re there with the characters. I wanted to make it feel like you\u2019re laughing, talking, or feeling afraid along with them.\nThere are no episodes or scenes that don\u2019t have any point, no drama or anything. My thought was that even if something doesn\u2019t look super stylish, someone somewhere is always having dramatic development, and that that character\u2019s feelings are always fluid and changing, so I tried to capture that in the visuals. I wanted to depict the changes in feelings that happen when people communicate\u2014not just conversations as simple back-and-forths.\nI actually think that the character development, the way the characters\u2019 emotions evolve, is more important than the action in Dan Da Dan, and so I really tried to make sure all the minute details were captured on screen. The slowing of the tempo in the dialog-heavy scenes was deliberate\u2014I wanted to make them feel different, to make them stand out.\nio9: What\u2019s been the most challenging part of bringing Dan Da Dan to life through animation?\nYamashiro: I wanted to avoid making visuals that didn\u2019t have a specific point to them whenever possible. The visuals are there to express something\u2014more than anything I wanted to avoid adding things just because they\u2019re cool, because they feel good, or because they\u2019ll work as a stopgap to tie things together. I thought about the best way to express the characters\u2019 situations and feelings, as well as the shifts in emotions throughout the scene, and tried to only compose scenes with visuals that really felt necessary.\nI\u2019d think to myself, \u201cWhy is this image necessary?\u201d before adding things. I don\u2019t think that I really managed it, but that\u2019s where my soul is, where my ideal is when I\u2019m working on a project. I want to make things that are well-designed, beautiful, and highly polished.\nio9: In the Dan Da Dan theatrical screening interview, you mentioned that you have a notebook filled with blocking and framing for you to refer back to with different framing and blocking while working on the show. Do you often refer back to it as a bible for directing Dan Da Dan? Have your framing ideas come from directors you\u2019ve seen in other anime or films, or do you come up with these ideas spontaneously and jot them down as they come to you?\nYamashiro: My notebook is mostly for my own study. I use it to keep record of what directorial techniques and what visuals directors and visual creators use in their works, so that I can analyze them. This goes for any film, any piece of media, but there\u2019s something the creators want to say in a project or in an individual scene. There\u2019s always some kind of intention or aim from the production side. I like to figure out what those are, to solve those puzzles and analyze them.\nDirection is really interesting, you know? Changing the time when information appears, or even a single bit of camerawork, can totally change the feeling of the scene. It makes me feel like maybe magic is real. I\u2019m still very much a beginner, so I feel like I need to look at what the great directors before me have done and take inspiration from them, take different ideas and put them together into new ways. I was very careful to ensure that these techniques were \u2018sublimated\u2019 into the project, rather than having it stop at parody.\nio9: Yukinobu Tatsu revealed that he read up on shojo manga to inform how he approached Dan Da Dan\u2019s romance between Okarun and Momo Ayase. Has the Dan Da Dan animation team had to go through a similar routine researching romance series to get further ideas for accentuating the ensuing romance in the show?\nYamashiro: I wasn\u2019t really thinking about shojo manga, but for romantic scenes, I tried the hardest to make those feel natural and realistic.\nRegarding the tempo, the show is generally about 1.25x the speed of normal anime. I tried not to add pauses anywhere. However, with romantic scenes, where we see the inner feelings of characters, or scenes where characters are alone, I made sure to add proper pauses there. I think variation in tempo can have a great effect on people, that feeling of a \u201cgap\u201d between extremes.\nI think it might be easy to understand if you look at the scene with the classical guitar in episode five. Didn\u2019t that feel different from what came before? Okarun and Momo are aware of each other here\u2014they must have been feeling different emotions from normal. I wanted to have the audience experience those emotions vicariously through them.\nio9: What have you learned from working on other anime projects that has served you in directing Dan Da Dan?\nYamashiro: I tried to put everything I\u2019ve learned so far into this project. I served as an assistant to director Masaaki Yuasa (Devilman Crybaby, Ping Pong the Animation, Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!) for a long time, and I think that had a big effect on how I think about projects and how I work. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d exist today without that experience, and I value it very dearly.\nAll 12 episodes of Dan Da Dan are streaming on Crunchyroll, Hulu, and Netflix, and season two is coming soon.\nWant more io9 news?
