  "description": "Dana White's Contender Series Season 9, Episode 1 Results: Everything to know about tonight's DWCS fight card: Results, winners, losers, scorecards, UFC, contract winners",
  "content": "The ninth season of Dana White\u2019s Contender Series begins tonight, Tuesday, August 12, from the UFC Apex in Las Vegas. This season, Season 9 of the DWCS fight cards runs for 10 weeks. The fighters are competing to earn a UFC contract. Five fights are scheduled for this week\u2019s event in three different weight divisions. We will have live results, reactions, video highlights, and a list of UFC contract winners as the DWCS fight card takes place.\n\nSince the DWCS began in 2017, UFC CEO Dana White has awarded 287 UFC contracts to the competitors. Last year, in Season 8 of the DWCS , White handed out 42 UFC deals.\n\nThree fighters have become UFC champions after appearing on a DWCS card: Sean O\u2019Malley, Jamahal Hill, and Jack Della Maddalena.\n\nSeason 9, Episode 1 of the DWCS airs on ESPN+ at 7:00 p.m. ET.\n\nA middleweight matchup between Ilian Bouafia and Neemias Santana is slated to headline the first episode of Season 9 of the DWCS. Bouafia brings a 6-0 record into the event. He is a 6-foot-five inch kickboxer, who last competed under the Ares FC banner. Bouafia\u2019s most recent fight was a February 2025 unanimous decision win over Paulin Begai. The bout marked the first time Boufia went the distance. His previous five outings ended via knockout, with four of those stoppages coming in the first round and the other in the second stanza.\n\nSantana is 7-2-1 over his career. He checks in at 6-foot-two. Santana is coming off a second-round knockout win over Marcos Vinicius on a March 2025 LFA card. He is 3-0-1 heading into Tuesday and has not lost since 2022.\n\nAccording to BetOnline, Bouafia is a -260 betting favorite over the +175 Santana.\n\nBouafia uses his length well and uses a technical kickboxing style. As for Santana, he is a pressure fighter, who looks to use his power to wrap things up.\n\nThe pick is Bouafia to win via knockout, but Santana, thanks to his approach, might be a pick to score an upset KO.\n\nThis Radley da Silva vs. George Mangos bout takes place at featherweight. Da Silva (7-1) is a three-time defending featherweight champ under the Battlefield Fight League banner. The 30-year-old last defended that title in January with a second-round submission win over Drew Brokenshire. Da Silva has three submission wins, three decision victories and one KO. His only loss came in his first pro bout in 2013.\n\nLike his opponent in this scrap, the 21-year-old Mangos (7-0) is a defending champion. He won the HEX Fight Series crown in 2024 and has defended that belt, most recently knocking out Ethan Thomas in 34 seconds in their March 2025 scrap. Mangos has five submissions and two knockout wins. He has gone into the third round once.\n\nThe current betting odds for Da Silva vs. Mangos has Mangos listed at -150 and Da Silva at +120.\n\nBoth of these men are good grapplers, but Mangos might have the advantage there. He is also the better striker. With his better all-around skillset, the betting pick is for a Mangos decision win.\n\nIn the middle of Tuesday\u2019s DWCS fight card is a welterweight matchup between Ty Miller and Jimmy Drago. Miller brings a perfect 5-0-0-1 record with him into the contest. The 25-year-old Miller is coming off a no contest on an LFA card in December. Before that he three knockouts and two decision victories.\n\nDrago is a former Ring of Combat champ. The 7-2-0-1 fighter is also coming off a no contest in his most recent matchup, a March 2025 scrap under the Cage Fury banner. Drago has four knockouts, two decisions and one submission win. He has one knockout loss and one submission setback.\n\nThe betting odds for this bout find Miller at -185 and Drago at +155.\n\nThe pick is for Miller to score a decision victory.\n\nChristopher Ewert and Yuri Panferov are scheduled to meet at 185 pounds. Ewert is a perfect 7-0 since making his pro debut in 2022. The 31-year-old was set to make his UFC debut at UFC 317, but a massive weight miss cost him that opportunity and his UFC contract. However, the promotion is giving him a second chance at a contract via the DWCS. Ewert has five knockouts and two decisions. He last fought in January of this year, going the distance on a Fury FC card.\n\nPanferov has an 8-1 record. The 28-year-old competed on the DWCS in 2023, losing to Torrez Finney via rear naked choke. Since that setback, Panferov is 2-0 with two knockout victories for CES. He has not fought since November 2024. Three of his career wins are by knockout, and the other five have come via submission. Panferov\u2019s most recent fight ended with 10 seconds left in the third stanza.\n\nEwert is a -170 betting favorite over the +140 Panferov.\n\nLook for Ewert to be motivated to earn a UFC contract in this matchup after missing weight for UFC 317. He should be able to exploit the gaps in Panferov\u2019s striking and get a knockout win.\n\nOpening Season 9 of the DWCS is a middleweight fight between Baysangur Susurkaev and Murtaza Talha. Susurkaev is the biggest favorite on the card at -350. He has an 8-0 record with seven knockouts and one decision. The 24-year-old is coming off a knockout on a February Fury FC card. The only question about Susurkaev is that he is taking this fight on short notice.\n\nThe 29-year-old Talha fell short in 2023 when he had an opportunity to earn a DWCS deal. In that matchup, Rodolfo Bellato knocked out Talha in the second round. Since then, Talha is 1-0 with a win over Oleg Klimov who was 0-1 as a pro. So, it is a bit of a head scratcher as to why he is getting a second look on the DWCS. Talha is a +275 underdog.\n\nThe pick is for Susurkaev to pick up a knockout win.\n\nWe will have more on Season 9 of the DWCS as the events take place. On Tuesday night, we will have results, reactions and contract winners for Season 9, Episode 1 of the Dana White Contender Series.",

      "text": "On Saturday, August 16, Dricus du Plessis looks to defend his UFC middleweight title for the third time. His opponent in the main event of the UFC 319 pay-per-view fight card is the undefeated Khamzat Chimaev. We look at the full betting breakdown for Du Plessis vs. Chimaev.\nUFC 319 takes place at the United Center in Chicago. The UFC 319 main card streams on ESPN+ pay-per-view following prelims on ESPN and early prelims on ESPN+.\nUFC 319 Main Event Preview: Dricus du Plessis Vs. Khamzat Chimaev\nDricus du Plessis (23-2) joined the UFC in October 2020 as a 26-year-old with a 14-2 record. Before he joined the UFC, Du Plessis had won titles with KSW and EFC. He made his debut against Markus Perez on the main card of a UFC Fight Night event in Abu Dhabi. Du Plessis knocked out Perez in the first round. He followed that win with a July 2021 \u201cPerformance of the Night\u201d KO win of Trevin Giles.\nThose two wins earned him a shot against the ranked veteran Brad Tavares. Du Plessis won that scrap via decision. The victory put him in the top 15 of the division. A December 2022 submission win over Darren Till moved Du Plessis to No. 10 in the division. A TKO win over the No. 5 ranked Derek Brunson followed.\nDu Plessis, who was working his way up the rankings, faced a tough test in his next outing when he met the No. 2 ranked Robert Whittaker at UFC 290. Du Plessis continued his rise, knocking out the former UFC champion in the UFC middleweight title eliminator and earning another \u201cPerformance of the Night\u201d bonus.\nMore important than the bonus was the title shot Du Plessis received for that win. He faced then-champion Sean Strickland in January, taking the title from Strickland in a \u201cFight of the Night\u201d bonus-winning scrap\nIn his first title defense Du Plessis picked up an August 2024 submission win over former UFC middleweight champ Israel Adesanya.\nDu Plessis most recently faced Strickland in a rematch at UFC 312 in early February of this year. Du Plessis won that contest via unanimous decision.\nI wrote of the champ after that fight, \"Dricus du Plessis looked much more controlled and less reckless at UFC 312 than in many of his previous battles. He mixed up his striking techniques and targets against Sean Strickland, landed the more powerful blows, and didn\u2019t put himself in too many awkward positions.\n\"Du Plessis did a much better job in his UFC 312 rematch against Strickland in shutting down his foe\u2019s offense. In the first fight, Strickland landed 173 of 408 significant strikes. While in the rematch, Strickland was held to 128 landed strikes on 263 attempts. Meanwhile, Du Plessis increased his landed strikes and landing percentage from the first fight to the second. In the first battle, Du Plessis landed 137 of 354 attempts for a landing rate of 38 percent. At UFC 312, the champ landed 147 of 314 attempts for a striking rate of 46 percent.\n\u201cDu Plessis has defended the UFC middleweight crown twice while going 9-0 in the UFC. Despite his winning ways, the champ remains a bit of an enigma because his style shouldn\u2019t work \u2014 but it does.\u201d\nChimaev (14-0) is the No. 3 fighter in the official UFC middleweight rankings. The 30-year-old made his UFC debut in July 2020 with a second-round submission win over John Phillips. He followed that victory with a first-round TKO over Rhys McKee 10 days later, breaking the UFC record for the quickest turnaround between UFC wins in the modern era. Then, in September, Chimaev knocked out Gerald Meerschaert.\nThings slowed down for Chimaev after that. He was booked to face Leon Edwards in December 2020, but that matchup never came to be despite multiple attempts to make the fight happen. The reason behind the numerous cancellations of Edwards vs. Chimaev was COVID-19.\nWhen Chimaev finally returned to the Octagon in October 2021, he made short work of Li Jingliang, scoring a submission at 3:16 of Round 1.\nIn his next bout, Chimaev went the distance for the first time in his career, picking up a victory over Gilbert Burns. He followed that with a submission over Kevin Holland.\nA break of more than a year followed that victory. Chimaev\u2019s next outing was an October 2023 matchup against Kamaru Usman, a fight that Chimaev won via decision.\nA year after that, Chimaev made short work of Robert Whittaker, defeating the ex-UFC middleweight champ via submission (face crank) in the first round of their UFC 308 scrap.\nUFC 319 Main Event Betting Lines And Movement: Dricus du Plessis Vs. Khamzat Chimaev\nAccording to BetOnline, Du Plessis opened as the +165 betting underdog to Chimaev, who was listed as the -190 betting favorite. The betting lines have moved since then. Today, Du Plessis comes in at +185, while Chimaev is listed at -220.\nUFC 319 Main Event Tale Of The Tape: Dricus du Plessis Vs. Khamzat Chimaev\nDricus du Plessis\nAge: 31\nHeight: 6\u20191\u201d\nReach: 76\u201d\nStance: Switch\nKhamzat Chimaev\nAge: 31\nHeight: 6\u20192\u201d\nReach: 75 \u201d\nStance: Orthodox\nUFC 319 Main Event Predictions And Picks: Dricus du Plessis Vs. Khamzat Chimaev\nIf Khamzat Chimaev figures out Dricus du Plessis he will be the first UFC fighter to do so. Du Plessis is an anomaly He doesn\u2019t have great technical skills, but he doesn\u2019t lose under the UFC. On paper he shouldn\u2019t be a UFC champion, but he is.\nAs for Chimaev, he too is a fighter that we have questions about. He has good technical grappling skills and is an explosive starter, but he has very questionable cardio.\nMost of the talk around this fight is that if Du Plessis can survive the first round he should be able to take over with his striking and rack up points for the win, but that\u2019s a big if when it comes to someone as aggressive and explosive as Chimaev.\nThe betting pick is for Du Plessis to win a decision or via late knockout. However, a pick for Chimaev to win via early submission is not out of line.\nWe will have more on the UFC 319 main event, Du Plessis vs. Chimaev, as fight night nears, as well as live results, reactions, highlights and more for the UFC 319 pay-per-view card on fight night"

      "text": "UFC 320 has a main event, and that main event is a light heavyweight title fight rematch. On Saturday, October 4, at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, current UFC light heavyweight champion Magomed Ankalaev puts his title on the line against the man he took the belt from, Alex Pereira. We look at the opening betting odds for the Ankalaev vs. Pereira 2 matchup.\nUFC 320 Fight Card Main Event: Magomed Ankalaev Vs. Alex Pereira 2 Opening Betting Odds\nNot long after UFC CEO Dana White announced the UFC 320 main event, BetOnline came out with betting lines for the fight. Ankalaev opened as the -220 betting favorite over Pereira in their upcoming rematch. Pereira opened as the +185 betting underdog. Less than 24 hours since White announced the matchup, Ankalaev has dropped to -200, while Pereira is now +170.\nUFC 320 Fight Card Main Event: Magomed Ankalaev Vs. Alex Pereira 2\nMagomed Ankalaev (20-1-1-1) has been a member of the UFC roster since 2018. Ankalaev lost his UFC debut when Paul Craig submitted him at 4:59 of the third round. Since then, Ankalaev has gone 13 fights without a loss.\nAnkalaev secured a title fight in December 2022 when he faced former UFC champion Jan Blachowicz for the vacant light heavyweight crown. However, that contest ended in a split draw, and with neither man impressing the matchmakers in that matchup, the UFC opted not to give either man a second go at earning the belt.\nSince then, Ankalaev is 2-0-0-1 with a no contest (illegal knee) against Johnny Walker, and most recently a decision win over Aleksandar Rakic at UFC 308.\nWhen the UFC opted to give UFC light heavyweight champion Alex Pereira a fight against Khalil Rountree at UFC 307 and bypass Ankalaev, he felt snubbed by the promotion, but also motivated.\n\u201cNow everybody knows I'm not fighting for the title and will fight Rakic in Abu Dhabi. Whoever (UFC matchmaker) Mick Maynard gives me I will smash their face so that they can no longer deny me if I do my job impressively. I feel sorry for whoever is gonna fight me from now going forward,\u201d Ankalaev said at the time.\nNot long after that, Ankalaev said that Pereira was running from him.\nWhen the UFC booked the UFC 313 matchup between Ankalaev opened as the -200 favorite over Pereira, who was listed at +170. On fight night, Pereira had moved to a -120 betting favorite over the +100 Ankalaev.\nThe bout lasted 25 minutes. At the end of the contest, Ankalaev earned a unanimous decision win (49-46, 48-47, 48-47).\nAt the time, I wrote of Ankalaev, \"Magomed Ankalaev and his team put together, implemented, and stuck with a strong game plan for Saturday's fight against Alex Pereira. The strategy was to pressure Pereira, land effective strikes, keep the threat of a takedown in Pereira's head, and exploit his lack of defensive movement. Ankalaev did just that, seeming to freeze Pereira over the final 20 minutes of the fight and avoid taking any serious damage.\n\"Fans might not have liked the performance, and the UFC is most likely not going to be overjoyed to see the light heavyweight title move from a knockout artist like Pereira to a fighter like Ankalaev, who is known more for decisions than stoppages, but that's where they are following UFC 313.\n\u201cAnkalaev fought smartly and effectively, managing risk while doing enough damage to carry all three scorecards. Fans don't have to like it, but there's no controversy in the decision.\u201d\nAlex Pereira (12-3) began 2023 by losing his UFC middleweight title to Israel Adesanya by knockout. In July, Pereira followed that setback with a win over former UFC light heavyweight title holder, Jan B\u0142achowicz, in his UFC debut at 205 pounds. He finished the year by knocking out ex-UFC light heavyweight kingpin Ji\u0159\u00ed Proch\u00e1zka at UFC 295 to claim the vacant UFC 205-pound title.\nPereira made his first defense of his crown in April when he knocked out(another) ex-UFC light heavyweight champ, Jamahal Hill, in the first round of their UFC 300 matchup. Pereira showed his power is on another level, when he finished Hill 3:14 into the first round of the main event of UFC 300.\nIn June, on very short notice, the UFC called on Pereira and Proch\u00e1zka to headline UFC 303 when the Conor McGregor vs. Michael Chandler fight fell off that card.\nAfter the bout, which Pereira won via a knockout 13 seconds into the second stanza, I wrote:\n\"Pereira showed that his first win over Prochazka wasn't a fluke. The UFC light heavyweight champ is a fearsome fighter who packs a lot of power in his strikes, but he's also an extremely focused competitor who doesn't let anything bother him.\n\u201cPereira effectively scored two knockouts on Saturday night, blasting former champion Jiri Prochazka to the mat at the bell to end the first round and then sending him right back down in the opening moments of the second round with a head kick.\u201d\nIn August the UFC booked Pereira against Khalil Rountree Jr for the main event of UFC 307, which took place on October 5. Pereira outclassed Rountree, putting a beating on his opponent before scoring a fourth-round TKO win.\nPereira picked up his third UFC title defense of 2024 on Saturday night. Pereira let his opponent, Khalil Rountree Jr, tire himself out in the early going of the fight while simultaneously slowing him with powerful kicks to Rountree's lead leg. Pereira picked up the pace in the third round, fighting very effectively behind his jab. That jab opened up several nasty cuts around Rountree's eye and on the bridge of his nose. Those blows hurt Rountree, and once Pereira had Rountree fading, he picked him apart with precision and power, forcing the referee, Marc Goddard, to stop the fight in the fourth round. Goddard could have stopped this much sooner.\nPereira was in the running for fighter of the year for 2024.\nFollowing his UFC 313 loss to Ankalaev, I wrote the following about the vanquished champion:\n\"Alex Pereira lost his UFC light heavyweight title on Saturday night, falling by unanimous decision to Magomed Ankalaev. Pereira did not seem to have a game plan to answer the pressure and forward motion of his opponent. With Ankalaev leading the dance in the final 20 minutes, Pereira seemed unable or unwilling to switch the momentum of the fight. It was a puzzling performance from the man who entered UFC 313 with an aura of invincibility about him.\n\u201cPereira\u2019s inability to fight off his back foot and inability to keep his head off the center line while defending strikes were especially noticeable on Saturday night.\u201d\nWe will have more on UFC 320, including opening betting odds for the co-main event."

      "text": "Christopher Ewert had a rollercoaster ride of a fight week. The UFC brought Ewert in to serve as a late-replacement opponent opposite Jackson McVey on the UFC 317 fight card. However, Ewert was released by the promotion during the official weigh-ins for the event, with the UFC commentary team announcing that the fight was off after Ewert was 10 pounds heavy for the middleweight matchup.\nWhile Ewert might not be a member of the UFC roster any longer, he will still reportedly get a chance to earn a UFC roster spot through the Dana White\u2019s Contender Series.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand how much we tried and we started the cut at 216,\u201d Ewert\u2019s coach Javier Torres told MMA Fighting after Ewert had been released. \u201cWhen we got to Vegas, we checked in at 216 pounds. [Friday]\n\u201c[Our] flight was leaving from Phoenix 8:30 a.m., [and got] delayed until 11:05 a.m. and we got to Vegas 1 p.m. We did bunch of media, pictures, obligations for UFC. We [had] a small window from 4-6 pm, [so] we did a small cut \u2014 a 30-minute run, pad, mitts, sauna, [and] mummy.\u201d\n\u201cWe told our business partner [we wanted]\n\u201c[Mick Maynard, our business partner] and I [talked] at 4 a.m., I told him what was happening. Chris started getting cramps, small ones. \u201cI let him rest, he couldn\u2019t sleep for shit. We checked his weight at 6:45 a.m., then we started [the cut again] at 7:15 \u2014 run and pads with the sauna suit on, and we got in the sauna and we did the mummy with sauna suit on. And we did this process again until 9:30 am.\n\u201cWe did try super (expletive) hard. We cut 22 pounds from Wednesday to Friday morning.\u201d\nEwert got the call for UFC 317 when McVey\u2019s opponent Sedriques Dumas was forced from the card.\nHowever, on Sunday, Carlos Contreras Legaspi of ESPNDeportes reported that Ewert, who was scheduled to compete on the upcoming season of Dana White\u2019s Contender Series would remain on the schedule for an appearance on the August 12 edition of the DWCS against Yuri Panferov.\nAs for Ewert\u2019s scheduled opponent for UFC 317, McVey, he weighed in at 185 pounds for the canceled bout.\nForbes reached out to the UFC for confirmation on Legaspi\u2019s report.\nEwert is 7-0 as a pro with five knockout wins and two victories via decision. His most recent fight came in January when he defeated Reese Watkins via unanimous decision on a Fury Fighting Championship card."

      "text": "The UFC 319 fight card is less than a week away. The pay-per-view event, which takes place on Saturday, August 16 from United Center in Chicago, has a middleweight title fight in the main event slot. In that contest, Dricus du Plessis looks to make the third defense if his UFC 185-pound title when he faces the undefeated Khamzat Chimaev at UFC 319. A high-stakes featherweight meeting serves as the UFC 319 co-main event. In that contest, the unbeaten Lerone Murphy steps in on short notice to face high-profile free agent Aaron Pico. We look at the early UFC 319 fight week betting odds for each fight on the upcoming UFC event.\nThe UFC 319 main card streams on ESPN+ PPV following prelims on ESPN and early prelims on ESPN+.\nUFC 319 Pay-Per-View Card Betting Odds: Du Plessis vs. Chimaev\nDricus du Plessis (+180) vs. Khamzat Chimaev (-210) - For Du Plessis\u2019s UFC middleweight title\nLerone Murphy (+125) vs. Aaron Pico (-145) - Featherweight\nGeoff Neal (+205) vs. Carlos Prates (-240) - Welterweight\nJared Cannonier (+150) vs. Michael Page (-175) - Middleweight\nTim Elliott (+210) vs. Kai Asakura (-270) - Flyweight\nUFC 319 Preliminary Card Betting Odds: Du Plessis vs. Chimaev\nKing Green (+135) vs. Diego Ferreira (-155) - Lightweight\nGerald Meerschaert (+180) vs. Michal Oleksiejczuk (-210) - Middleweight\nJessica Andrade (+130) vs. Loopy Godinez (-150) - Women\u2019s Strawweight\nChase Hooper (-280) vs. Alexander Hernandez (+240) - Lightweight\nEdson Barboza (-150) vs. Drakkar Klose (+130) - Lightweight\nBryan Battle (-175) vs. Nursulton Ruziboev (+150) - Middleweight\nKarine Silva (-200) vs. Dione Barbosa (+170) - Women\u2019s Flyweight\nRodrigo Sezinando (TBA) vs. TBD (TBA) - TUF Welterweight Final\nIdiris Alibi (TBA) vs. Joseph Morales (TBA) - TUF Flyweight Final\nUFC 319 Main Event: Dricus du Plessis Vs. Khamzat Chimaev\nDricus du Plessis (23-2) joined the UFC in October 2020 as a 26-year-old with a 14-2 record. Before he joined the UFC, Du Plessis had won titles with KSW and EFC. He made his debut against Markus Perez on the main card of a UFC Fight Night event in Abu Dhabi. Du Plessis knocked out Perez in the first round. He followed that win with a July 2021 \u201cPerformance of the Night\u201d KO win of Trevin Giles.\nThose two wins earned him a shot against the ranked veteran Brad Tavares. Du Plessis won that scrap via decision. The victory put him in the top 15 of the division. A December 2022 submission win over Darren Till moved Du Plessis to No. 10 in the division. A TKO win over the No. 5 ranked Derek Brunson followed.\nDu Plessis, who was working his way up the rankings, faced a tough test in his next outing when he met the No. 2 ranked Robert Whittaker at UFC 290. Du Plessis continued his rise, knocking out the former UFC champion in the UFC middleweight title eliminator and earning another \u201cPerformance of the Night\u201d bonus.\nMore important than the bonus was the title shot Du Plessis received for that win. He faced then-champion Sean Strickland in January, taking the title from Strickland in a \u201cFight of the Night\u201d bonus-winning scrap\nIn his first title defense Du Plessis picked up an August 2024 submission win over former UFC middleweight champ Israel Adesanya.\nDu Plessis most recently faced Strickland in a rematch at UFC 312 in early February of this year. Du Plessis won that contest via unanimous decision.\nI wrote of the champ after that fight, \"Dricus du Plessis looked much more controlled and less reckless at UFC 312 than in many of his previous battles. He mixed up his striking techniques and targets against Sean Strickland, landed the more powerful blows, and didn\u2019t put himself in too many awkward positions.\n\"Du Plessis did a much better job in his UFC 312 rematch against Strickland in shutting down his foe\u2019s offense. In the first fight, Strickland landed 173 of 408 significant strikes. While in the rematch, Strickland was held to 128 landed strikes on 263 attempts. Meanwhile, Du Plessis increased his landed strikes and landing percentage from the first fight to the second. In the first battle, Du Plessis landed 137 of 354 attempts for a landing rate of 38 percent. At UFC 312, the champ landed 147 of 314 attempts for a striking rate of 46 percent.\n\u201cDu Plessis has defended the UFC middleweight crown twice while going 9-0 in the UFC. Despite his winning ways, the champ remains a bit of an enigma because his style shouldn\u2019t work \u2014 but it does.\u201d\nChimaev (14-0) is the No. 3 fighter in the official UFC middleweight rankings. The 30-year-old made his UFC debut in July 2020 with a second-round submission win over John Phillips. He followed that victory with a first-round TKO over Rhys McKee 10 days later, breaking the UFC record for the quickest turnaround between UFC wins in the modern era. Then, in September, Chimaev knocked out Gerald Meerschaert.\nThings slowed down for Chimaev after that. He was booked to face Leon Edwards in December 2020, but that matchup never came to be despite multiple attempts to make the fight happen. The reason behind the numerous cancellations of Edwards vs. Chimaev was COVID-19.\nWhen Chimaev finally returned to the Octagon in October 2021, he made short work of Li Jingliang, scoring a submission at 3:16 of Round 1.\nIn his next bout, Chimaev went the distance for the first time in his career, picking up a victory over Gilbert Burns. He followed that with a submission over Kevin Holland.\nA break of more than a year followed that victory. Chimaev\u2019s next outing was an October 2023 matchup against Kamaru Usman, a fight that Chimaev won via decision.\nA year after that, Chimaev made short work of Robert Whittaker, defeating the ex-UFC middleweight champ via submission (face crank) in the first round of their UFC 308 scrap.\nUFC 319 Co-Main Event: Lerone Murphy Vs. Aaron Pico\nLerone Murphy (16-0-1) opened his UFC career with a 2019 draw against Zubaira Tukhugov. Since then, the 34 year old has done nothing but win. Murphy has gone 8-0 with the UFC since that draw, most recently beating former UFC interim title challenger Josh Emmett by decision. Before that April 2025 victory, Murphy picked up wins over Edson Barboza and Dan Ige.\nMurphy is the No. 6 ranked fighter in the official UFC 145-pound division.\nAaron Pico (13-4) joined the UFC as a free agent earlier this year. Pico was with Bellator for his entire MMA career before departing as a free agent. The 28-year-old had an up-and-down run with the promotion, but he enters UFC Abu Dhabi on a three-fight winning streak. His record in his past 10 fights is 9-1. His only loss during that span, which dates back to January 2020, is a October 2022 TKO loss to Jeremy Kennedy in a fighter were the doctor stopped the bout because Pico dislocated his shoulder.\nWhen announcing the initial UFC 319 co-main event of Movsar Evloev vs. Pico, UFC CEO Dana White called Pico, \u201cthe guy most people consider to be the top free agent in the world.\u201d\nWhite added, \u201cAaron Pico is a ridiculously violent striker and a very high-level grappler. Pico has had hype behind him since he was a teenager because of his skill and fighting style, which people compare him to the likes of Justin Gaethje or Dustin Poirier.\u201d\nThe Pico vs. Evloev fight fell apart in mid-July when Evloev was pulled from the card due to illness.\nWe will have more on the UFC 319 fight card as fight night nears."
