      "feedback": "Your draft captures key catalysts but lacks depth, causal linkage, and precise probability justification; tighten the causal chain by linking each driver to a specific market transmission mechanism (e.g., how Nvidia’s earnings affect AI‑related equity risk‑premium), expand the time window to reflect realistic lag (e.g., 1‑2 months for M&A impact), and embed first‑principles logic (e.g., EV profitability tied to unit economics and capital‑intensity cycle); replace generic “70%” with a range derived from the cited probability of a 25‑bp cut (85% → 70% after adjusting for Fed’s stance) and reconcile conflicting sources (e.g., Fed hike risk vs. cut probability); quantify the impact of Japanese banks’ overseas M&A on global AUM growth using the 5‑10 % target and its 8‑12 % earnings lift, then calculate a realistic probability (e.g., 55‑65%) based on current M&A pipeline data; for Ford’s EV risk, integrate the EV loss magnitude from W2622L6WW with the broader auto capex cycle to estimate a 35‑45% chance of sustained low profitability; ensure each line contains a single sentence, cites only IDs, and uses concrete triggers (e.g., “Nvidia Q2 earnings beat >$20 B net income”) and watch signals (e.g., “Fed Jackson Hole remarks on Friday”); finally, adjust the format to exactly four lines, each strictly following the “Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %” template.",
