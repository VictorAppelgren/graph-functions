      "text": "It\u2019s late August and Jeremy Allen White is currently in Los Angeles, but the native New Yorker is thinking about summer back in his hometown.\n\u201cIt is tough in the summer in New York, but it is my favorite,\u201d White told me by phone last week. \u201cI know I'm not alone in that, but I don't think there's many of us. It's my favorite time of year in New York.\u201d\nLast year, the Emmy-winning actor shot his first Calvin Klein underwear campaign way up on a Manhattan rooftop, posing in his skivvies against the skyline. Today he\u2019s back for round two\u2014and this time, he\u2019s wearing the brand\u2019s latest fall-winter 2024 collection in sunny LA, in a new poolside portfolio photographed by Mert Alas. Aside from the West Coast locale, the main distinction from the first campaign is that White is now actually wearing jeans.\nAhead of the new launch, White and I chatted about Carmy\u2019s style on The Bear, Bruce Springsteen\u2019s denim legacy, and how he felt about beating Pharrell in GQ\u2019s 2023 Most Stylish Man of the Year tournament.\nJeremy Allen White: Yeah, I mean, yeah\u2026I think it did what it was supposed to do. I felt so insecure leading up to the shoot itself, and it felt kind of crazy. Acting on film or TV and then doing these sort of campaigns or photo shoots, there's such a big difference\u2014because in film and TV, your job is to sort of forget the camera is there, and then with these sort of shoots, your partner is sort of the photographer and the camera. And so I was concerned about making that work.\nBut yeah, it felt really special. I was in New York when the first campaign went up. When they put the billboard up on Houston, I woke up early that morning and I went with a buddy of mine who brought his camera and took it in before the public took it in. And that felt really wonderful and intimate, and like an achievement. It was still just mine in a really nice way. And then everybody else saw it in the weeks to come. For the most part people were excited about it, and that was cool and surprising. I mean, like so many things in my life right now, they're all very cool and surprising. [Laughs.]\nI'm very much a jeans guy. You can say that, yeah.\nComfort is really important, and durability\u2014I like to be able to wear pretty much the same jeans over and over again. I sort of cycle with clothing: I'll kind of just wear generally the same thing or at least a variation of five or six different pieces for a month or even two months. In terms of these standard straight jeans, there is something really sort of classic and elegant, no matter what is trending in the world of pants or denim, I feel like a straight leg with boots is always going to look cool.\nI also wore a lot of denim-on-denim for this campaign. Calvin has this really beautiful denim shirt that I wore buttoned down, and a really beautiful denim jacket as well. I don't care what people say\u2014I think denim-on-denim is always going to look cool. We did that shoot in April and then [denim-on-denim] became my summer evening staple. It was a lot of denim button-downs and jeans.\nBruce Springsteen is\u2014I mean this in the very best way\u2014he's a guy. He's a jeans and T-shirt kind of guy. It was exciting to know going into this thing that we had at least that in common.\nI'm really lucky that there's sort of a team of folks now in place to help young actors portray rock stars. [Laughs.] I've got a really talented group of people helping me train vocally, musically, to get ready for this thing. I'm also really lucky [that] Bruce is really supportive of the film, and so I've had some access to him and he's just the greatest guy. Also, there's just so much footage. It's really great to go down a YouTube rabbit hole and find him at all these different periods in his life and be able to listen to his speaking voice as well as his singing voice. That's kind of been the deal, just listening to him a lot and watching him a lot. It's been really fun preparing.\nI'm not a fashion guy really. Chris [Storer], our showrunner, is very in the know, and Matty [Matheson, a real-life chef who plays handyman Neil Fak in the series] really follows a lot of the stuff and is a very stylish guy. I think Carmy's interest in fashion came from [the idea that] a lot of chefs\u2014a lot of chefs that Matty knows, Matty himself, a lot of chefs that Courtney, Chris's sister, knows\u2014they're also interested in fashion, or they're interested in design. Carmy is interested in fashion because that was just something that people found true of the world of restaurants.\nFor me, when we meet Carmy in the first season, if he had an interest in fashion, his brain certainly didn't have room to focus on that, or that wasn't a place he was able to express himself in the fashion world or what he was wearing. We needed to find something that was kind of a uniform. I guess, in a sense, Carmy's uniform of work pants and a T-shirt is more my\u2014Jeremy's\u2014style. In that sense, our styles sort of bled together.\nI remember.\n[Laughing] I was like, \u201cYou guys need to stop bullying me. This isn't funny. Get me out of there.\u201d\nI know, and it still felt like bullying. [Laughs.] But no, I do recall that. It was really nice. But yeah, it's like I said, comfort and [knowing] what looks good on you, like the silhouette, or how a shirt fits your shoulders, or where jeans sit on your waist, the hem of denim and where that falls on your boot or your sneaker. It's just little things, and it's just about the silhouette, and what makes you feel confident and comfortable.\nI'm so lucky that I have Calvin making these sorts of decisions, and then I go in and I kind of just say, \u201cWell, this feels more comfortable to me, this feels less comfortable.\u201d The Golden Globes suit they made me was so beautiful and timeless, and then of course we messed around with a couple different versions of sheerness of an open shirt, which was a bit more of a modern addition to otherwise pretty timeless suiting.\nBut even though the suiting was comfortable, it was loose. What I really enjoy seeing in men's suiting in particular is: Does somebody look comfortable? Does it look effortless? Does it look easy? If a suit is well-made and structured to your body, it helps you feel more confident and empowered and effortless and cool, ultimately. They did such a beautiful job with that suit.\nAww, well\u2026I don't want to say worry less about what you look like or what the suit looks like, but yeah, if you feel comfortable, it's going to look cooler.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed."
