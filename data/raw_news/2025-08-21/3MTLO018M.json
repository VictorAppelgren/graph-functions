  "title": "Trump may want you to pay a high tariff for that French wine you enjoy so much. He just left the category blank in his deal sheet with the EU",
  "description": "The tariff agreement is only 3 1/2-pages long.",
  "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration and European Union officials on Thursday released a bare-bones account of their trade deal that imposes a stiff 15% import tax on 70% of European goods exported to the U.S., but they left blank key areas including wine and spirits and steel and indicated that talks would continue on those and a slew of other important goods.\n\nThe two sides said that the document made public Thursday was only \u201ca first step in a process that can be further expanded to cover additional areas.\u201d They are dealing with the vast range of goods traded between the two economies in what is the largest bilateral trading relationship in the world, involving $2 trillion in annual transatlantic business.\n\nThe 3 1/2-page text, which represents a political commitment and isn\u2019t legally binding, contrasts with the typical format for trade agreements, which can be hundreds of pages long and carry legal force.\n\nThe key provisions are the 15% tariff on most EU goods, a zero rate on U.S. cars and other industrial goods exported to the EU, and a range of exceptions to the 15% rate for aircraft and aircraft parts, generic pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients, with other sectors to be added for goods crucial to each other\u2019s economies. Those goods would face lower tariffs from before Trump\u2019s tariff onslaught.\n\nOne goods category that wasn\u2019t excluded from the higher tariff was wine and spirits, which had enjoyed zero tariffs on both ends since 1997. The EU\u2019s chief trade negotiator, Maros Sefcovic, said that EU officials had not won an exemption \u201cyet\u201d but hoped to in future talks and that \u201cdoors are not closed forever\u201d on that issue.\n\nProposals to exempt a certain amount of EU steel imports, known as a tariff rate quota, have been left unresolved pending more talks.\n\nThe 15% tariff is much higher than tariff levels on both sides from before Trump launched his wave of tariffs, when they averaged in the low single digits. The tariffs are paid on the U.S. end \u2014 either absorbed by U.S. businesses importing the goods, lowering their profits, or passed on to American consumers in the form of higher prices at the cash register.\n\nEuropean officials have had to defend the deal against dismay from businesses and member governments at the higher tariff and criticism that the EU gave away too much. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen sold the deal as granting quick relief from the even higher U.S. tariff on EU cars of 27.5% and as opening the way for further negotiations that could exclude more goods from the 15% tariffs. The deal provides that the lower tariff on cars would apply retroactively from Aug. 1 if the EU can introduce legislation to implement its part of the deal by then, which EU officials say they will do.\n\n\u201cFaced with a challenging situation, we have delivered for our member states and industry and restored clarity and coherence to transatlantic trade,\u201d von der Leyen said. \u201cThis is not the end of the process.\u201d\n\nSefcovic, who echoed those sentiments, said, \u201cThe alternative was a trade war with sky high tariffs \u2026 it builds confidence. It brings stability.\u201d\n\nThe deal also includes nonbinding EU commitments to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and for EU companies to invest $600 billion in the U.S. In both cases, the money would come from private companies and is based on assessment by the European Commission on what companies were planning to spend.\n\nMcHugh contributed from Frankfurt, Germany, and Hussein from Washington.",

      "text": "What US consumers can expect from new tariffs on imported goods\nWhat US consumers can expect from new tariffs on imported goods\nAmerican businesses and consumers soon will have a better idea of how President Donald Trump\u2019s foreign trade agenda might affect them now that the United States has imposed higher tariffs on products from dozens of countries.\nIt\u2019s been nearly 100 years since the nation had an overall import tax rate as high as the one set Thursday. But the individual impact on business costs and consumer prices could vary as much as the tariffs applied to goods of nearly 70 U.S. trading partners, from complicated economies like the European Union to the small African nation of Lesotho.\nExports from a majority of them are getting taxed at 15%. For a handful of countries in Asia, the rate is 19%. Products from the rest are subject to taxes of 20% to 50%. Meanwhile, a 55% tariff on Chinese-made goods is scheduled to take effect next week if a U.S.-China trade deal is not agreed on before then.\nBusinesses in the U.S. and abroad have been dealing in various ways since February with Trump\u2019s fluctuating tariffs on specific products and countries. Many automakers appeared to have absorbed the costs for now. But recent government data indicated that retail prices for groceries, furniture and appliances started creeping up in June.\nBecause tariffs are a tax on imports, economists have expected U.S. consumers to foot at least part of the bill eventually.\nThe country-specific round enforced Thursday, together with the president\u2019s earlier tariffs on specific sectors such as automobiles and steel, will increase prices 1.8% in the short term, the Budget Lab at Yale estimated. That\u2019s the equivalent of a $2,400 loss of income per U.S. household, according to the non-partisan policy research center\nThe projections were based on an analysis of duties implemented this year through Wednesday, as well as a doubling of the levy on items made in India that Trump said would be implemented near the end of August.\n\u201cRetailers have been able to hold the line on pricing so far, but the new increased tariffs will significantly raise costs for U.S. retailers, manufacturers and consumers,\u201d Jon Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation trade group, said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press.\nHere\u2019s what to know about the tariffs and where U.S. consumers are most likely to notice effects:\nHow we got here\nTrump unveiled sweeping import taxes on goods coming into the U.S. from 66 countries, the European Union, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands in April. He said the \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs were meant to boost domestic manufacturing and restore fairness to global trade.\nThe president paused the country-specific tariffs a week later but applied a 10% tax to most imports. In early July, he began notifying countries that their exports would be subject to higher tariffs on Aug. 1 unless they reached trade deals. A week ago, he pushed the start date to Thursday.\nIn the meantime, Trump announced a 35% tariff on imports from Canada, but delayed action on Mexico while negotiations continued. However, a free trade agreement reached with Mexico and Canada during Trump\u2019s first term shields most of those countries\u2019 products from punishing duties.\nThe president also ordered a 50% tariff on goods from Brazil. This week, he signed an executive order to take India\u2019s tariff rate from 25% to 50% for its purchases of Russian oil. The timing gives India and Russia a chance to negotiate with the Trump administration.\nOther duties not specific to countries remain in place, such as a 50% tariff on imported aluminum and steel announced in June. Trump also threatened 100% tariffs on computer chips that aren\u2019t made in the U.S. The administration has said tariffs are still coming on imported pharmaceutical drugs.\nTariffs are already impacting prices\nThe U.S. Commerce Department reported on July 31 that prices rose 2.6% in June, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Earlier in July, the government reported that its primary inflation measure, the Consumer Price Index, also ticked higher in June as the cost of furniture, toys and other frequently imported items increased.\nShoppers should be prepared to pay more for clothes and shoes because the combined tariffs \u201cdisproportionately affect clothing and textiles,\u201d according to the Budget Lab at Yale. It estimates that shoe prices will go up 39% temporarily and stay 19% above where they are now. For apparel, the Budget Lab put the comparable figures at 37% and 18%.\nOverall, Americans face an average tax of 18.6% for imported products, the highest rate since 1933, the research center said.\nFood and drink prices will climb\nThe tariffs will almost certainly result in higher food prices, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. The U.S. simply doesn\u2019t make enough of some products, like bananas or coffee, to satisfy demand. Fish, beer and liquor are also likely to get more expensive, the foundation said.\nThe U.S. Wine Trade Alliance and other alcohol industry trade groups sent a letter to Trump that warned a 15% tariff on European wines and spirits could result in more than 25,000 American job losses and cost the industry nearly $2 billion in lost sales.\n\u201cMr. President, we need toasts, not tariffs, as we head into the most important season for our industry,\u201d read the letter dated Wednesday.\nWine distributors and retailers avoided price increases before now by accelerating shipments from France and other EU countries earlier in the year. But with the EU\u2019s tariff rate raised to 15% on Thursday, customers may see European wines costing 30% more in September, U.S. Wine Trade Alliance President Ben Aneff said.\nCar prices hold steady \u2014 so far\nSome automakers already raised prices to counteract tariffs. Luxury sports car maker Ferrari said last week it was waiting for more details of Trump\u2019s trade deal with the EU before scaling back a 10% surcharge it put on most vehicles in the U.S.\nFor the most part, automakers waited for details instead of passing on tariff costs to consumers. But that could change.\nGeneral Motors said on July 22 that the impact of the tariffs could get more pronounced in the third quarter of the year. GM has estimated the tariffs will cost it $4 billion to $5 billion this year.\nToyota reported Thursday a 37% drop in profits in the April-June quarter, cutting its full-year earnings forecasts largely because of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nStill a clouded picture\nEven with so many new tariffs kicking in, the tariff situation remains fluid. Trump\u2019s use of an emergency powers law to implement tariffs is being challenged in the courts. The case is expected to wind up before the U.S. Supreme Court.\nMoreover, the tariffs on goods from China haven\u2019t been finalized. Consumers may start seeing more effects when the administration ends a tax exemption for small parcels sent from other countries.\nTrump last week signed an order to suspend the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption that has allowed shipments valued at $800 or less to enter the U.S. duty-free. International e-commerce companies have widely used the rule to avoid paying customs charges.\nTrump withdrew the exemption in early April for goods shipped from China and Hong Kong tariff-free. It is now set to be eliminated for low-value packages from every country on Aug. 29.\n___\nAP reporter Colleen Barry in Milan contributed to this report."

      "text": "US-EU deal sets a 15% tariff on most goods and averts the threat of a trade war with a global shock\nUS-EU deal sets a 15% tariff on most goods and averts the threat of a trade war with a global shock\nEDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) \u2014 The United States and the European Union agreed on Sunday to a trade framework setting a 15% tariff on most goods, staving off \u2014 at least for now \u2014 far higher import duties on both sides that might have sent shock waves through economies around the globe.\nThe sweeping announcement came after President Donald Trump and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen met briefly at Trump\u2019s Turnberry golf course in Scotland. Their private sit-down culminated months of bargaining, with the White House deadline Friday nearing for imposing punishing tariffs on the EU\u2019s 27 member countries.\n\u201cIt was a very interesting negotiation. I think it\u2019s going to be great for both parties,\u201d Trump said. The agreement, he said, was \u201ca good deal for everybody\u201d and \u201ca giant deal with lots of countries.\u201d\nVon der Leyen said the deal \u201cwill bring stability, it will bring predictability, that\u2019s very important for our businesses on both sides of the Atlantic.\u201d\nMany facets will require more work\nAs with other, recent tariff agreements that Trump announced with countries including Japan and the United Kingdom, some major details remain pending in this one.\nTrump said the EU had agreed to buy some $750 billion worth of U.S. energy and invest $600 billion more than it already is in America \u2014 as well as make a major military equipment purchase. He said tariffs \u201cfor automobiles and everything else will be a straight across tariff of 15%\u201d and meant that U.S. exporters \u201dhave the opening up of all of the European countries.\u201d\nVon der Leyen said the 15% tariffs were \u201cacross the board, all inclusive\u201d and that \u201cindeed, basically the European market is open.\u201d\nAt a later news conference away from Turnberry, she said the $750 billion in additional U.S. energy purchases was actually over the next three years \u2014 and would help ease the dependence on natural gas from Russia among the bloc\u2019s countries.\n\u201cWhen the European Union and the United States work together as partners, the benefits are tangible,\u201d Von der Leyen said, noting that the agreement \u201cstabilized on a single, 15% tariff rate for the vast majority of EU exports\u201d including cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.\n\u201c15% is a clear ceiling,\u201d she said.\nBut von der Leyen also clarified that such a rate wouldn\u2019t apply to everything, saying that both sides agreed on \u201czero for zero tariffs on a number of strategic products,\u201d like all aircraft and component parts, certain chemicals, certain generic drugs, semiconductor equipment, some agricultural products, natural resources and critical raw materials.\nIt is unclear if alcohol will be included in that list.\n\u201cAnd we will keep working to add more products to this list,\u201d she said, while also stressing that the \u201cframework means the figures we have just explained to the public, but, of course, details have to be sorted out. And that will happen over the next weeks.\u201d\nFurther EU approval needed\nIn the meantime, there will be work to do on other fronts. Von der Leyen had a mandate to negotiate because the European Commission handles trade for member countries. But the Commission must now present the deal to member states and EU lawmakers, who will ultimately decide whether or not to approve it.\nBefore their meeting began, Trump pledged to change what he characterized as \u201ca very one-sided transaction, very unfair to the United States.\u201d\n\u201cI think both sides want to see fairness,\u201d the Republican president told reporters.\nVon der Leyen said the U.S. and EU combined have the world\u2019s largest trade volume, encompassing hundreds of millions of people and trillions of dollars and added that Trump was \u201cknown as a tough negotiator and dealmaker.\u201d\n\u201cBut fair,\u201d Trump said.\nTrump has spent months threatening most of the world with large tariffs in hopes of shrinking major U.S. trade deficits with many key trading partners. More recently, he had hinted that any deal with the EU would have to \u201cbuy down\u201d a tariff rate of 30% that had been set to take effect.\nBut during his comments before the agreement was announced, the president was asked if he\u2019d be willing to accept tariff rates lower than 15%, and he said \u201cno.\u201d\nFirst golf, then trade talk\nTheir meeting came after Trump played golf for the second straight day at Turnberry, this time with a group that included sons Eric and Donald Jr. In addition to negotiating deals, Trump\u2019s five-day visit to Scotland is built around golf and promoting properties bearing his name.\nA small group of demonstrators at the course waved American flags and raised a sign criticizing British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who plans his own Turnberry meeting with Trump on Monday.\nOther voices could be heard cheering and chanting \u201cTrump! Trump!\u201d as he played nearby.\nOn Tuesday, Trump will be in Aberdeen, in northeastern Scotland, where his family has another golf course and is opening a third next month. The president and his sons plan to help cut the ribbon on the new course.\nThe U.S. and EU seemed close to a deal earlier this month, but Trump instead threatened the 30% tariff rate. The deadline for the Trump administration to begin imposing tariffs has shifted in recent weeks but is now firm and coming Friday, the administration insists.\n\u201cNo extensions, no more grace periods. Aug. 1, the tariffs are set, they\u2019ll go into place, Customs will start collecting the money and off we go,\u201d U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d before the EU deal was announced. He added, however, that even after that \u201cpeople can still talk to President Trump. I mean, he\u2019s always willing to listen.\u201d\nWithout an agreement, the EU said it was prepared to retaliate with tariffs on hundreds of American products, ranging from beef and auto parts to beer and Boeing airplanes.\nIf Trump eventually followed through on his threat of tariffs against Europe, meanwhile, it could have made everything from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals more expensive in the United States.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great that we made a deal today, instead of playing games and maybe not making a deal at all,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think it\u2019s the biggest deal ever made.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writers Seung Min Kim in Cincinnati and Samuel Petrequin in London contributed to this report."

      "text": "What to know about Trump\u2019s newest and most sweeping tariffs\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s newest and most sweeping tariffs\n\u25b6 Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\nBANGKOK (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Thursday imposed once unthinkably high U.S. taxes on imports from dozens of countries, part of his campaign to turn one of the world\u2019s most open economies into a fortress bristling with barriers to trade.\nThe taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 that took effect at midnight apply to products from 66 countries, the European Union, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands.\nTrump believes the tariffs will protect U.S. industry from foreign competition, encourage companies to build factories and hire workers in the United States and raise revenue to pay for the massive tax cuts he signed into law July 4.\n\u201cGrowth is going to be unprecedented,\u201d Trump said Wednesday.\nBut mainstream economists and policy analysts warn that tariffs are paid by importers in the United States who will try to pass along the cost through higher prices to their customers, businesses and consumers alike; make the economy less efficient and innovative by shielding domestic companies from foreign competition; and threaten U.S. relationships with longstanding allies and trading partners.\nIndeed, the economic damage is already starting show.\nHere\u2019s what to know:\nHefty tariffs have taken effect \u2014 but many could have been higher\nThe levies that took effect Thursday are a revised version of what Trump called \u201d reciprocal tariffs \u201d announced on April 2. Those earlier threats included import taxes of up to 50% on goods from countries that have a trade surplus with the United States, along with 10% \u201cbaseline\u2019\u2019 taxes on almost everyone else. The move triggered sell-offs in financial markets, and Trump backtracked to give countries a chance to negotiate.\nSome of them did, caving in to Trump\u2019s demands to accept high tariffs to ward off even higher ones. The United Kingdom agreed to 10% tariffs and the European Union, South Korea and Japan accepted U.S. tariffs of 15%. Those are well above the low single-digit rates they paid last year, but down from the 30% Trump had ordered for the EU and the 25% he ordered for Japan in April.\nThailand, Pakistan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines cut deals with Trump, settling for rates of around 20%.\nIndonesia views its 19% tariff deal as a leg up against exporters in other countries that will have to pay slightly more, said Fithra Faisal Hastiadi, a spokesperson in the Indonesian president\u2019s office. \u201cWe were competing against Vietnam, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and China ... and they are all subject to higher reciprocal tariffs,\u201d Hastiadi said. \u201cWe believe we will stay competitive.\u201d\nTrump dictated terms to countries that didn\u2019t reach a deal\nFor countries that didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t reach a deal, Trump dictated terms himself, plastering tariffs ranging from 10% on the Falkland Islands to 41% on Syria. Countries in Africa and Asia are mostly facing lower rates than the ones Trump decreed in April. Tiny Lesotho in southern Africa, for instance, ended up with a 15% tariff instead of the 50% Trump originally announced.\nIndia also has no broad trade agreement with Trump. On Wednesday, Trump he signed an executive order placing an extra 25% tariff for its purchases of Russian oil, bringing combined U.S. tariffs to 50%. India has stood firm, saying it began importing oil from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict.\nImpoverished Laos and war-torn Myanmar face 40% rates. Trump whacked Brazil with a 50% import tax largely because he\u2019s unhappy with its treatment of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. South Africa said the steep 30% rate Trump has ordered on the exporter of precious gems and metals has put 30,000 jobs at risk and left the country scrambling to find new markets outside the United States.\nEven wealthy Switzerland is under the gun. Swiss officials were visiting Washington this week to try to stave off a whopping 39% tariff on U.S. imports of its chocolate, watches and other products.\nOverall, the average U.S. tariff rate has risen from around 2.5% before Trump returned to the White House to 18.6% \u2014 the highest since 1933 \u2014 the Budget Lab at Yale University reported Thursday.\nCanada and Mexico have their own arrangements as China talks continue\nGoods that comply with the 2020 United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that Trump negotiated during his first term are excluded from the tariffs.\nSo, even though U.S. neighbor and ally Canada was hit by a 35% tariff after it defied Trump \u2014 a staunch supporter of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 by saying it would recognize a Palestinian state, most of its exports to the U.S. remain duty free.\nCanada\u2019s central bank says 100% of energy exports and 95% of other exports are compliant with the agreement since regional rules mean Canadian and Mexico companies can claim preferential treatment.\nThe slice of Mexican exports not covered by the USMCA is subject to a 25% tariff, down from an earlier rate of 30%, during a 90-day negotiating period that began last week.\nMeanwhile, Trump has yet to announce whether he will extend an Aug. 12 deadline for reaching a trade agreement with China that would forestall earlier threats of tariffs of up to 245%.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the president is deciding about another 90-day delay to allow time to work out details of an agreement setting tariffs on most products at 50%, including extra import duties related to illicit trade in fentanyl.\nHigher import taxes on small parcels from China have hurt smaller factories and layoffs have accelerated, leaving some 200 million workers reliant on \u201cflexible work\u201d \u2014 the gig economy \u2014 for their livelihoods, the government estimates.\nStill, China has shown that it has leverage to resist Trump\u2019s threats: It can withhold exports of rare earth minerals that companies need for everything from wind turbines to electric vehicle batteries.\nConsiderable uncertainty remains\nDetails of the deals reached in a frenzy of negotiations leading up to Trump\u2019s August deadline have not been published \u2014 and are already subject to disagreement.\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, for instance, told reporters that Japan is asking the U.S. government to immediately correct tariffs that are not consistent with their agreement.\n\u201cThe uncertainty about whether Trump was bluffing with his tariff threats and simply using those threats as a negotiating tool has been resolved,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy and economics at Cornell University. \u201cBut the uncertainty about the tariffs themselves, including the rates and what countries and products will be covered, is still unresolved in any durable way and remains subject to Trump\u2019s whims.\n\u201cEven the deals that have ostensibly been negotiated lack clarity about their details and are far from settled.\u2019'\nTrump also is threatening new tariffs \u2014 including levies of 200% or more on pharmaceuticals and 100% on computer chips.\nTrump\u2019s trade agenda also is under attack in court, adding to the uncertainty.\nA specialized trade court in New York ruled in May that Trump overstepped his authority in imposing April 2 tariffs and earlier ones on Canada, China and Mexico. An appeals court, which allowed the government to continue collecting tariffs while the case moves through the judicial system, now has the case, which is expected to eventually go to the Supreme Court.\nIn a hearing last week, the judges sounded skeptical about the Trump administration\u2019s authority to declare a national emergency to justify the tariffs.\n___\nWiseman reported from Washington.

  "argos_summary": "The United States and the European Union reached a trade framework that imposes a 15% tariff on most EU goods exported to the U.S., while exempting certain strategic products such as aircraft parts, generic pharmaceuticals, and some chemicals. The deal also includes non\u2011binding commitments for the EU to purchase $750\u202fbillion of U.S. energy and for U.S. companies to invest $600\u202fbillion in the EU, and it restores lower tariffs on U.S. cars that had been hit by a 27.5% duty. Although the 15% rate is higher than pre\u2011Trump tariffs, it is far lower than the 30% or 50% rates that were threatened, and the agreement aims to prevent a broader trade war while leaving room for further negotiations on excluded categories like wine, spirits, and steel. Meanwhile, the U.S. has imposed a wide range of new tariffs on dozens of countries, raising the average import duty to the highest level since 1933 and prompting concerns about higher consumer prices and economic efficiency.",
