  "description": "The Air Force said a dozen transgender members who applied for early retirement were told 'prematurely' that they were approved.",
  "content": "WASHINGTON \u2212 The Air Force yanked retirement pay for some transgender airmen forced out of the military by the Trump administration after telling them their applications were approved.\n\nThe Pentagon moved to purge transgender servicemembers from the ranks of the military earlier this year. They were offered a \"separation\" payment \u2013 the amount would be doubled if they left voluntarily, according to a February memo from department leadership.\n\nThe Air Force said in May that transgender airmen who had served between 15 and 18 years could withdraw their request for voluntary separation pay and instead apply for early retirement.\n\nAround a dozen who applied were told \"prematurely\" that they were approved, according to an Air Force statement. Then the Air Force backtracked.\n\n\"After careful consideration of the individual applications, I am disapproving all\" of them, Brian Scarlett, the Air Force's acting assistant secretary for manpower and reserve affairs, wrote in a memo first obtained by Reuters.\n\n\"It feels like a betrayal. I'm devastated. I'm heartbroken,\" said Logan Ireland, an Air Force master sergeant who will have 15 years of service in November, including deployments to Afghanistan and Qatar and multiple overseas tours.\n\nIreland said he already had retirement orders in hand and a retirement date of Dec. 1. His parents had bought tickets to travel to Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii where he is currently stationed, for his retirement party.\n\n\"I did everything correct. I was just months away from leaving the military with the dignity and respect that I thought I would be given,\" Ireland told USA TODAY.\n\nThe Air Force said those airmen will now be \"afforded the opportunity\" to apply for voluntary separation. Logan said he received a new deadline of August 15 to apply for the payment. The original deadline to apply has long passed \u2013 June 6 for regular Air and Space Force members, and July 7 for Air Force Reserve members.\n\nIreland said he's not sure what the value of voluntary separation will be, but he no longer has a pension. Some state and school benefits will also be off the table, he said.\n\n\"We planned everything around me being retired,\" he said. \"I'm navigating getting out of the military with a lot of unknowns.\"\n\nIn the Navy, ousted transgender members with less than 18 years of service cannot get retirement, according to guidance issued in May. According to the Army's guidance, trans members with 15 to 18 years \"can request\" early retirement \"for consideration.\"\n\nThe Pentagon has said military commanders should initiate medical record reviews of servicemembers they believe have gender dysphoria and have not stepped forward to resign.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order days after he was sworn into office in January stating transgender servicemembers do not \"satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\" In early February, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a memo barring transgender people from joining the military, and the Pentagon started to expel currently serving servicemembers in June.\n\nA group of transgender servicemembers challenged the policy in court, but the Supreme Court upheld the ban in a May decision.\n\nTrump also banned transgender people from the military in his first term, but the policy was quickly rescinded by former President Joe Biden.",

      "text": "US military to start kicking out transgender troops next month, memo says\nWASHINGTON \u2013 U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has issued internal instructions to the Pentagon to start kicking out transgender troops who do not elect to leave on their own by June 6, according to a memo obtained by Reuters.\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe decision was immediately condemned by transgender rights activists contacted by Reuters.\n\"It is just shameful,\" said Jennifer Levi, a senior director at the pro-LGBTQ legal group GLAD Law.\n\"It is senseless to fast track people out of the military who are meeting standards and putting lives on the line to defend the country.\"\nHegseth's memo illustrates how President Donald Trump's administration intends to swiftly act to remove thousands of transgender servicemembers after the Supreme Court's ruling on Tuesday cleared the way for a ban to take effect.\nIn the memo, Hegseth said active duty transgender troops could identify themselves for \"voluntary separation\" from the U.S. armed forces until June 6. Troops who are in the reserve forces had until July 7.\n\"On conclusion of the self-identification eligibility window, the Military Departments will initiate involuntary separation processes,\" the memo said.\nThe Pentagon's ban is just one of a series of steps the Trump administration has taken to curb transgender rights.\nTrump signed an executive order in January after returning to the presidency that reversed a policy implemented under his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, that had allowed transgender troops to serve openly in the American armed forces. Biden said at the time that \"America is safer when everyone qualified to serve can do so openly and with pride.\"\nAs of late last year, there were 4,240 U.S. active-duty and National Guard transgender troops, officials have said. Transgender rights advocates have given higher estimates."

      "text": "Military commanders to oust trans soldiers through 'medical record reviews,' memo says\nCommanders will be tasked with exposing trans soldiers who don't resign through \"individualized medical record reviews,\" a Pentagon memo said.\nWASHINGTON \u2212 Transgender servicemembers who don't voluntarily leave the military will be identified through \"medical record reviews,\" according to a new memo detailing how the Pentagon should enforce its sweeping effort to expel transgender people from the ranks.\nTransgender servicemembers have until June 6 to voluntarily identify themselves and resign, according to a memo signed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on May 8.\nCommanders will be tasked with exposing those who don't through \"individualized medical record reviews.\"\nCommanders who are \"aware\" that members of their unit have \"gender dysphoria, a history of gender dysphoria, or symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria\" must initiate a review, according to the memo signed by Jules Hurst, the acting undersecretary of Defense for personnel and readiness.\nA senior defense official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said directing the medical reviews would be left up to commanders' discretion. The personal health information of soldiers would be shared only with members of the military \"with a specific need to know,\" according to the memo.\nServicemembers' personal medical information, while normally protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, can be shared to determine if they are fit for duty. According to the Trump administration ban, a gender dysphoria diagnosis means they are not.\nTransgender servicemembers who voluntarily leave the military will receive benefits not afforded to those who refuse to identify themselves, according to the official. Of the 4,200 transgender people serving, around 1,000 have voluntarily self-identified, according to the Defense Department.\nArmy veteran Alleria Stanley, a board member of the Transgender American Veterans Association, said booting anyone with a documented diagnosis or history of gender dysphoria \u2013 not just people who have openly transitioned \u2013 would leave a huge gaps in the military's ranks.\n\"It's going to leave holes in the military that are going to take a long time to fill,\" she said.\nSince the Supreme Court ruled May 6 that the military-wide ban on transgender people could stand, the Trump administration and Hegseth have put in motion a wide-ranging effort to purge transgender people from the military.\nThe Trump administration had filed an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court after rulings from a pair of federal judges put the ban on hold. A group of transgender servicemembers had challenged the policy, saying it lacked evidence that they were detrimental to the military.\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order days after taking office declaring \"adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual\u2019s sex\" is inconsistent with \"a soldier\u2019s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle.\"\nTrump also sought to ban transgender people from the military in his first term \u2013 the Supreme Court allowed the ban to partially stand."

      "text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, and to ensure the readiness and effectiveness of our Armed Forces, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1. Purpose. The United States military has a clear mission: to protect the American people and our homeland as the world\u2019s most lethal and effective fighting force. Success in this existential mission requires a singular focus on developing the requisite warrior ethos, and the pursuit of military excellence cannot be diluted to accommodate political agendas or other ideologies harmful to unit cohesion.\nRecently, however, the Armed Forces have been afflicted with radical gender ideology to appease activists unconcerned with the requirements of military service like physical and mental health, selflessness, and unit cohesion. Longstanding Department of Defense (DoD) policy (DoD Instruction (DoDI) 6130.03) provides that it is the policy of the DoD to ensure that service members are \u201c[f]ree of medical conditions or physical defects that may reasonably be expected to require excessive time lost from duty for necessary treatment or hospitalization.\u201d As a result, many mental and physical health conditions are incompatible with active duty, from conditions that require substantial medication or medical treatment to bipolar and related disorders, eating disorders, suicidality, and prior psychiatric hospitalization.\nConsistent with the military mission and longstanding DoD policy, expressing a false \u201cgender identity\u201d divergent from an individual\u2019s sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service. Beyond the hormonal and surgical medical interventions involved, adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual\u2019s sex conflicts with a soldier\u2019s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one\u2019s personal life. A man\u2019s assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.\nFor the sake of our Nation and the patriotic Americans who volunteer to serve it, military service must be reserved for those mentally and physically fit for duty. The Armed Forces must adhere to high mental and physical health standards to ensure our military can deploy, fight, and win, including in austere conditions and without the benefit of routine medical treatment or special provisions.\nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States Government to establish high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity. This policy is inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria. This policy is also inconsistent with shifting pronoun usage or use of pronouns that inaccurately reflect an individual\u2019s sex.\nSec. 3. Definitions. The definitions in the Executive Order of January 20, 2025 (Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government) shall apply to this order.\nSec. 4. Implementation. (a) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense (Secretary) shall update DoDI 6130.03 Volume 1 (Medical Standards for Military Service: Appointment, Enlistment, or Induction (May 6, 2018), Incorporating Change 5 of May 28, 2024) and DoDI 6130.03 Volume 2 (Medical Standards for Military Service: Retention (September 4, 2020), Incorporating Change 1 of June 6, 2022) to reflect the purpose and policy of this Order.\n(b) The Secretary shall promptly issue directives for DoD to end invented and identification-based pronoun usage to best achieve the policy outlined in section 2 of this order.\n(c) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall:\n(i) identify all additional steps and issue guidance necessary to fully implement this order; and\n(ii) submit to the President through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs a report that summarizes these steps.\n(d) Absent extraordinary operational necessity, the Armed Forces shall neither allow males to use or share sleeping, changing, or bathing facilities designated for females, nor allow females to use or share sleeping, changing, or bathing facilities designated for males.\nSec. 5. Implementing the Revocation of Executive Order 14004. (a) Pursuant to the Executive Order of January 20, 2025 (Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions), Executive Order 14004 of January 25, 2021 (Enabling All Qualified Americans To Serve Their Country in Uniform), has been revoked. Accordingly, all policies, directives, and guidance issued pursuant to Executive Order 14004 shall be rescinded to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this order.\n(b) The Secretary and, with respect to the Coast Guard, the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall take all necessary steps to implement the revocations described in subsection (a) of this section and ensure that all military departments and services fully comply with the provisions of this order.\nSec. 6. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\nSec. 7. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 27, 2025."

      "text": "Pentagon revives ban on transgender troops joining U.S. military\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Pentagon has reinstated restrictions on transgender recruits joining the military, according to a memo filed in federal court by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\nThe memo from last Friday bars people with gender dysphoria from joining the military and pauses treatment for transgender troops who require medical treatment.\n\"Effective immediately all new accessions for individuals with a history of gender dysphoria are paused, and all unscheduled, scheduled or planned medical procedures associated with affirming or facilitating a gender transition for service members are paused,\" Hegseth wrote.\nThe Defense Department's memo marks the latest volley in the controversy over the service of transgender troops and represents an initial salvo to reverse social policies at the Pentagon that President Donald Trump and Hegseth deride as \u201cwoke.\u201d\nIn 2016, then-President Barack Obama erased the Pentagon policy that kept people who did not identify with their gender at birth from joining the ranks. The Obama-era policy had also allowed transgender troops serving in the military to receive counseling and medical care for their condition.\nTrump\u2019s latest move reverses one of the Biden administration\u2019s first acts, itself a repudiation of Trump\u2019s 2017 announcement that banned the service of transgender troops. Days after taking office in 2021, Biden ordered the Pentagon to rescind the ban on troops based on their gender identity.\nIn 2017, Trump surprised the Pentagon by announcing the ban in a tweet, writing that the Pentagon \"will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.\"\nTrump's policy, which took months to craft, required troops to serve based on their sex at birth. Transgender troops who had begun receiving treatment under the Obama-era policy were grandfathered in. Then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said at the time that the Obama-era policy had eroded military readiness.\nEstimates on the number of transgender troops vary from about 10,000 to 14,000 of the nearly 2 million active-duty and reserve forces. About 1,000 of them required treatment. A Pentagon-commissioned study determined that allowing transgender people to serve had minimal cost and effect on the readiness of troops to fight.\nGender dysphoria results from the conflict between physical gender and gender identity and should not disqualify troops from serving, according to the American Medical Association and other major medical and psychiatric organizations.\nIn a statement, SPARTA Pride, an advocacy organization for transgender troops, said anybody who meets the military standards should be allowed to serve.\n\"There are already thousands of transgender service members currently in the military who have met the standards and have more than proven themselves,\" the statement said. \"There's no reason to deny transgender Americans the opportunity to serve or limit access to medically necessary care that all service members are entitled to.\""

      "text": "In win for Trump, Supreme Court allows ban on transgender troops to take effect\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Supreme Court will allow President Donald Trump\u2019s ban on transgender people serving in the military to take effect while court challenges continue.\nIn a win for the president's efforts to curb rights for transgender people, an ideologically divided court on May 6 agreed to the administration's request for help after lower courts paused the ban.\nThe court\u2019s three liberal members \u2212 Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson \u2212 said they would have rejected the request.\nThe justices who backed the decision did not identify themselves or provide an explanation, which is typical for action the court takes on emergency appeals.\nLawyers for the transgender servicemembers challenging the ban called the court's decision a \"devastating blow.\"\n\"By allowing this discriminatory ban to take effect while our challenge continues, the Court has temporarily sanctioned a policy that has nothing to do with military readiness and everything to do with prejudice,\" lawyers with Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation said in a statement.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the decision is a \u201cmassive victory,\u201d adding on social media that Trump is \u201crestoring a military that is focused on readiness and lethality \u2013 not DEI or woke gender ideology.\u201d\nThe Department of Justice said the lower courts improperly second-guessed the Pentagon\u2019s assessments of the risks of transgender servicemembers rather than giving the military the \u201csubstantial deference\" its judgments are owed.\nThe administration also argued the policy is \u201cmaterially indistinguishable\u201d from a partial ban the Supreme Court allowed to go into effect during Trump\u2019s first administration.\nBut the transgender servicemembers challenging the new policy said it\u2019s more expansive. Under the previous rules, for example, servicemembers who had already transitioned were not removed and did not have their health care denied.\nPlus, there are now years of experience showing transgender servicemembers have improved, not harmed, military readiness, lawyers for the servicemembers argued.\nAnd they said the ban is \u201cbased on the shocking proposition that transgender people do not exist.\u201d\nThe administration has declared that there are only two sexes, male and female, and a person\u2019s sex cannot be changed.\nTrump's ban paused in March by federal judge\nTrump\u2019s ban was paused on March 27 by a Seattle-based federal district judge. A three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals backed that decision.\nThe DOJ says letting transgender people serve \"undermines military readiness and lethality.\" U.S. District Judge Benjamin Settle, who was appointed by former President George W. Bush, said there's no evidence to support that.\n\u201cThe government\u2019s arguments are not persuasive, and it is not an especially close question on this record,\u201d Settle said.\nJudge says ban is `soaked with animus'\nA federal judge in Washington, D.C., reached a similar conclusion on March 18 in a related challenge by transgender members of the military. U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes' order temporarily blocking enforcement of the policy is on hold while it's being reviewed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\nReyes, who said the ban was \u201csoaked with animus and dripping with pretext,\u201d was appointed to the bench by former President Joe Biden.\nThe executive order Trump signed soon after taking office said the \"adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle.\u201d\nTo implement the order, the Pentagon has barred transgender people from joining the military, stopped paying for some hormonal treatment and sex reassignment surgery and prepared to remove transgender servicemembers from the ranks.\nEstimates on the number of transgender troops vary from about 10,000 to 14,000 of the nearly 2 million active-duty and reserve forces. About 1,000 of them required treatment. A Pentagon-commissioned study determined that allowing transgender people to serve had minimal cost and effect on the readiness of troops to fight."
