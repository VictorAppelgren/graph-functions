      "feedback": "Add the UST 10‑yr handle to each driver so the mapping is explicit (e.g., “Fed tightening at September 2025 will lift ust10y”). Keep the catalyst window in the “What to watch” field (e.g., “September 2025 FOMC”). Adjust probabilities to reflect the source’s “moderate” confidence (≈55‑60 % for Fed tightening, ≈50 % for spread steepening, ≈40 % for Fed cut, ≈30 % for spread flattening). Ensure each line remains a single sentence, contains no filler, and ends with a single probability value. Include the citation only once per line, immediately after the probability. This will satisfy the handle‑mapping, catalyst‑window, and formatting requirements.",
