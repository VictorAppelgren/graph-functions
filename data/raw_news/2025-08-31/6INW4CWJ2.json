  "title": "7 great Hulu movies to watch on Labor Day",
  "description": "These Hulu movies might be the perfect way to spend Labor Day weekend. Our picks include an Alien entry and a Best Picture winner.",
  "content": "If you\u2019re looking for a way to spend your Labor Day weekend, you might have a desire to spend at least part of it relaxing in front of the TV. While Hulu is no longer its own streaming service, it still has plenty of titles worth watching.\n\nWe\u2019ve pulled together seven recent movies that are all worth catching up with or rewatching over this extended weekend. Whether you\u2019re looking for something action-forward or meditative, you\u2019ll find it on this list.\n\nA total surprise that is still underseen, Predator: Killer of Killersi s an animated anthology film that tells the story of three different people who took on a Predator at different points in history.\n\nWhile the three stories are not equally engaging, each of them has moments of thrilling action that would be almost impossible to replicate in live action. And, because it has such a ferocious pace, Killer of Killers winds up feeling like one of the best action movies of any kind to have been released this year.\n\nYou can watch Predator: Killer of Killers on Hulu.\n\nA genuinely unsettling horror movie that became something of a phenomenon, Longlegs is a riff on The Silence of the Lambs with more of a demonic underpinning. The film follows an FBI agent who begins investigating a series of killings and comes to realize how intimately connected they seem to be to her own past.\n\nDark, strange, and unsettling, Longlegs also features Nicolas Cage at his most unhinged, which isn\u2019t always a bad thing. Even more crucially, it has answers to its central mysteries that will leave you both thrilled and satisfied.\n\nYou can watch Longlegs on Hulu.\n\nThere are plenty of best picture winners that don\u2019t hold up particularly well. Anora is not going to be one of them. Sean Baker\u2019s movie tells the story of a New York prostitute who finds herself in a fairytale romance with a wealthy Russian scion, only to have all of that fall apart.\n\nAnora is equally hilarious and devastating. Mikey Madison\u2019s central performance is daring and brash and becomes even more impressive when you realize how little it has to do with who she is as a person.\n\nYou can watch Anora on Hulu.\n\nJune Squibb has still got it, and Thelma is all the evidence you need of that. The movie stars Squibb as a retiree who finds herself scammed out of her savings and becomes determined to travel across Los Angeles to get her money back.\n\nAlong the way, though, she comes to appreciate how stubborn she\u2019s been about growing old and how unwilling she\u2019s been to change her self-perception. Squibb is predictably hilarious here, as is Richard Roundtree in what turned out to be his last onscreen performance.\n\nYou can watch Thelma on Hulu.\n\nAlien: Romulus is not the best installment, but it is a remarkably sturdy chapter in this saga that gets back to the basics of what these movies are good at. The film follows a group of young people desperate to escape from their off-world colony who find themselves on board a ship that was destroyed by an alien.\n\nWhat happens from there is fairly predictable, but Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson are particularly excellent at the center of the action.\n\nYou can watch Alien: Romulus on Hulu.\n\nA subtle, quiet character study about a Japanese man who lives by a particular routine, Perfect Days is a thoughtful appreciation of what it means to love the life you\u2019ve got. It follows a janitor living in Japan who cleans the public bathrooms of Tokyo and seems to find a great deal of gratification in his work.\n\nWhen his regular routine is disrupted by an unexpected visitor, we come to appreciate how he became the zen person he is today and why he\u2019s living a simple life now.\n\nYou can watch Perfect Days on Hulu.\n\nHow to Blow Up a Pipeline (2023)\n\nA bracing thriller about political terrorism, How to Blow Up a Pipeline follows a group of disparate people who come together over their shared desire to blow up an oil pipeline. As we learn what motivated each of these very different people to join forces, we also see their plan come to fruition and what it costs them.\n\nHow to Blow Up a Pipeline is a movie about people who are furious at what the world has become and decide to do something about it.\n\nYou can watch How to Blow Up a Pipeline on Hulu.",

      "text": "The latest Stephen King adaptation is now on Hulu. Based on King\u2019s short story from the \u201980s, The Monkey wowed audiences with its diabolical humor and insane kills. Now on streaming, the horror film should find a new audience.\nStaying in the horror realm, Ready or Not was a fantastic surprise in 2019. The thriller did so well that a sequel is on the way next year. Elsewhere, 10 Things I Hate About You is always a solid streaming selection.\nKeep reading for the rest of the best movies on Hulu.\nWe also have guides to the best new movies to stream, the best movies on Netflix, the best movies on Hulu, the best movies on Amazon Prime Video, the best movies on HBO Max, and the best movies on Disney+.\n10 Things I Hate About You (1999)\nThe movie that turned the late Heath Ledger into a heartthrob (and rightfully so) was 10 Things I Hate About You. In this modern adaptation of a Shakespeare comedy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as Cameron, a new student who wants to date the popular Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik).\nIn Bianca\u2019s house, there is one rule: she can\u2019t date until her antisocial sister, Kat (Julia Stiles), does. Enter Patrick Verona (Ledger), the handsome bad boy recruited by Cameron to woo Kat. Patrick is used to getting what he wants, but winning over Kat will be his hardest challenge yet.\nThe Monkey (2025)\nDeath comes in the form of a sadistic toy in Osgood Perkins\u2019 The Monkey. Growing up, twins Hal and Bill Shelburn (Christian Convery) discover that a toy monkey causes the most violent and horrific deaths. The boys throw the monkey away, hoping to never see it again.\n25 years later, the monkey reappears and wreaks havoc. Hal and Bill (Theo James) reunite to save their loved ones by destroying this evil monkey. Unfortunately, some people will have to die along the way.\nReady or Not (2019)\nA children\u2019s game turns deadly at a family event in Ready or Not. Grace (Samara Weaving) hits the jackpot by marrying Alex (Mark O\u2019Brien) and joining his wealthy family. On her wedding night, Grace is forced to play a game of hide-and-seek with her new family.\nThinking nothing of it, Grace playfully abides by the rules and hides. She soon finds out that Alex\u2019s family must kill her before dawn, or they die instead. To last until dawn, this bride must fight back and outlast her in-laws by any means necessary.\nThe Amateur (2025)\nRami Malek is a CIA analyst out for revenge in The Amateur. Charlie Heller (Malek) is a cryptographer who prefers to work behind a desk. Charlie\u2019s world comes crashing down after his wife (Rachel Brosnahan) is killed in a terrorist attack. Conducting his own investigation, Charlie identifies the four suspects who played a part in his wife\u2019s death. When Charlie brings this information to his superiors, they refuse to take action.\nMotivated by revenge, the introverted Charlie heads into the field and hunts down his wife\u2019s killers. The CIA eventually realizes that it made a mistake to underestimate Charlie, who becomes a ruthless vigilante that the agency cannot control.\nSunshine (2007)\nBefore directing the Oscar-winning Slumdog Millionaire, Danny Boyle helmed the vastly underrated sci-fi thriller, Sunshine. In the future, Earth begins freezing due to the Sun\u2019s deterioration. The human race will cease to exist if the Sun dies. Eight astronauts \u2014 including Robert Capa (Cillian Murphy), James Mace (Chris Evans), and Cassie (Rose Byrne) \u2014 aboard the Icarus II are tasked with detonating a stellar bomb inside the Sun in hopes of reigniting it.\nLike all explorations to outer space, everything that can go wrong will go wrong. Each problem results in another tragedy. These astronauts thought they could make it home. As they approach the Sun, they quickly realize that completing the mission is all that matters.\n(500) Days of Summer (2009)\nExplore the highs and lows of a relationship in (500) Days of Summer. Greeting-card writer Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) instantly falls hard for the company\u2019s new employee, Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel). Tom and Summer seem like a perfect match due to their compatible personalities and similar interests. Summer wants to keep things casual, while Tom wants a serious commitment. Despite their views on love, they embark on a passionate relationship.\nBecause the film is presented in a nonlinear narrative, you immediately find out that Summer breaks up with Tom. As the film jumps back and forth between timelines, you learn what went wrong for Tom and what he must do to move on. (500) Days of Summer is a unique take on the rom-com genre, backed by charming performances and a hopeful message."

      "text": "Just when you were wondering who the cat is who won\u2019t cop out when there\u2019s danger all about, along comes the first trailer for Shaft with an action-packed answer.\nThe fifth installment of the Shaft franchise, the upcoming film brings together three generations of men in the Shaft family \u2014 the original John Shaft, John Shaft II, and John Shaft III \u2014 for another adventure in the criminal underworld of Harlem.\nNew Line Cinema released the trailer for Shaft, a follow-up to 2000\u2019s similarly titled Shaft, which introduced Samuel Jackson as John \u201cJ.J.\u201d Shaft II. The new film casts Independence Day: Resurgence actor Jessie T. Usher as John Shaft III, an FBI agent and Massachusetts Institute of Technology-educated cybersecurity expert who finds himself in Harlem investigating the death of a friend. Forced to enlist the help of his estranged father, John Shaft II (Jackson), J.J. soon gets caught up in a case that demands both his technical know-how and his father\u2019s formidable street smarts to solve \u2014 and eventually draws in the man they were both named after, the first John Shaft.\nOriginal Shaft star Richard Roundtree reprises his most famous role as the \u201cbad mother\u201d who spawned three films featuring the hard-hitting, lady-romancing, smooth-talking private detective. The cast is filled out by Regina Hall (Barbershop: The Next Cut, The Hate U Give), Alexandra Shipp (X-Men: Apocalypse), Matt Lauria (Friday Night Lights), Titus Welliver (Bosch), and Wu-Tang Clan founding member (and actor) Cliff \u201cMethod Man\u201d Smith (Keanu, HBO\u2019s The Deuce).\nShaft is directed by Tim Story (Barbershop, Fantastic Four) from a script penned by Kenya Barris (Girls Trip, Black-ish) and Alex Barnow (The Goldbergs). The character of John Shaft is inspired by author and original Shaft screenwriter Ernest Tidyman\u2019s novel of the same name.\nThe first Shaft was released in 1971, and was followed by two sequels: 1972\u2019s Shaft\u2019s Big Score! and 1973\u2019s Shaft in Africa. Jackson rebooted the franchise with 2000\u2019s Shaft, which was a moderate critical and commercial success. The upcoming film is expected to pivot into more action-comedy territory, as evidenced by the trailer\u2019s emphasis on humor.\nShaft is scheduled to hit theaters June 14."

      "text": "Hulu\u2019s status over the course of the past decade has changed several times. The streaming service, which is now owned by Disney, still has original movie releases, but it has never competed for Oscars in quite the way that a service like Netflix does.\nAs a result, Hulu original movies can be a little bit of everything, although many of them are the kind of mid-budget movies that have been disappearing from theaters. While all of them are definitely not good, we\u2019ve pulled together a list of 10 excellent ones that are worth watching this summer.\nPalm Springs (2020)\nOne of the great pandemic watches of 2020 was Palm Springs, a Groundhog Day-style story that followed two people attending a wedding who find themselves trapped living the same day over and over again.\nWhile time loop stories are nothing new, Palm Springs manages to inject some fresh life into the genre by trapping two people in this purgatory together as they slowly fall in love and deal with personal demons that predate the time they\u2019ve shared together. Anchored by great performances from Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti, Palm Springs is still just as good today.\nYou can watch Palm Springs on Hulu.\nHappiest Season (2020)\nA holiday romcom with some real bite, Happiest Season tells the story of two women in a committed relationship who visit one of their families for the holidays. When her partner learns that she is not out to her family, she\u2019s forced to pretend to be her friend through a deeply awkward weekend that leaves her questioning their entire relationship.\nHappiest Season is a fairly light comedy about bigotry, but it works because of Kristen Stewart and Mackenzie Davis\u2019s committed central performances and because it\u2019s got some festive holiday zest to it.\nYou can watch Happiest Season on Hulu.\nSummer of Soul (2021)\nOne of the great documentaries of the past decade, Summer of Soul tells the story of the Harlem Cultural Festival, a music festival that did not receive the attention of Woodstock but occurred during the same summer.\nThanks to archival footage of many of the performers, as well as contemporary interviews with experts and some of the performers themselves, the film is deeply emotional and a reminder of the wealth of Black history that often goes unexplored in mainstream culture.\nYou can watch Summer of Soul on Hulu.\nFresh (2022)\nFresh is silly, to be sure, but it knows what it is and is pretty effective at creating a tense, thrilling atmosphere. The movie follows a young woman who is struggling to find any datable men until she comes across a charming man who, it turns out, wants to slowly carve her up and eat her.\nSebastian Stan and Daisy Edgar-Jones are both excellent and utterly committed here, and the movie also has some pretty heavy-handed things to say about misogyny and what men really value in the women around them.\nYou can watch Fresh on Hulu.\nPrey (2022)\nThis prequel to the original Predator executed what everyone had basically always wanted from this franchise. It tells the story of a Native American girl living in the 18th century who stumbles upon a predator and has to figure out how to defeat it.\nAmber Midthunder delivers a hugely compelling central performance. In director Dan Trachtenberg\u2019s hands, Prey becomes a movie much more about one woman\u2019s survival and self-actualization than it is about the larger mythology of this universe, and it\u2019s all the better for it.\nYou can watch Prey on Hulu.\nRye Lane (2023)\nA hugely colorful and charming romantic comedy, Rye Lane is told over the course of a single day and follows two single people who meet in London in the wake of bad breakups.\nAs they slowly form a connection, they have to work through their baggage and figure out whether they\u2019re really interested in pursuing a serious relationship. Filled with actual jokes and riveting banter, Rye Lane would be nothing without the natural chemistry between its stars, David Jonsson and Vivian Oparah.\nYou can watch Rye Lane on Hulu.\nNo One Will Save You (2023)\nA sci-fi movie with a high-minded premise, No One Will Save You is an almost entirely wordless film that follows a young woman who lives alone as she begins to suspect that aliens are invading her home. As she works to battle them off, we learn more about how she came to be so isolated.\nAnchored by the remarkable Kaitlyn Dever, who conveys so much without saying a word, No One Will Save You is more than just its interesting premise. It\u2019s a genuinely exciting sci-fi movie that, thankfully, demands that you actually look at the screen while you watch it.\nYou can watch No One Will Save You on Hulu.\nPredator: Killer of Killers (2025)\nA sort of pseudo-sequel to Prey, but animated this time, Predator: Killer of Killers is an anthology story that follows three different characters from Earth who all took on predators over the course of history. A Viking, a samurai, and a World War II fighter pilot all get their turns taking on the unkillable hunters. After they emerge victorious, the warriors are taken to the Predator homeworld, where they are forced to compete to see who is the ultimate killer of killers.\nFeaturing stylish animation, innovative action sequences, and a breakneck pace, Predator: Killer of Killers is one of the best entries in the franchise.\nYou can watch Predator: Killer of Killers on Hulu.\nMinding the Gap (2018)\nOne of the best documentaries on Hulu, Minding the Gap follows the story of three friends who bond over skateboarding as they grow and change over the course of years. In that time, we come to appreciate the economic hardships facing each of them and the way skateboarding becomes less of an escape as the realities of their lives start to close in around them.\nMinding the Gap features some impressive skateboarding footage, but what really makes the movie stick are all the moments where you see someone trying to escape from the circumstances they were born into, with mixed results.\nYou can watch Minding the Gap on Hulu.\nFire Island (2022)\nA modern retelling of Pride and Prejudice, Fire Island offers a remarkable and humorous glimpse into the culture of gay travelers enjoying a summer vacation on the island. The film is vibrant and captures the complexity of gay culture.\nThe romance at the movie\u2019s center is also deeply charming, anchored by writer and star Joel Kim Booster, who delivers a star-making turn at the center of this movie. Rarely has a retelling of Jane Austen felt as vibrant and modern as it does here.\nYou can watch Fire Island on Hulu."

      "text": "\u201cSean Baker's Anora is an exuberant, heart-wrenching adrenaline rush.\u201d\n- Sean Baker's empathetic, breathless filmmaking\n- Mikey Madison's moving, star-making lead performance\n- An all-time ending that will stick with you for days\n\u201cWhy you can trust Digital Trends \u2013 We have a 20-year history of testing, reviewing, and rating products, services and apps to help you make a sound buying decision. Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nAnora is not a fairy tale, though it has all the potential to be one. Around its midpoint, the film\u2019s title character wonders aloud if she\u2019ll finally get to fulfill her lifelong fantasy of staying in the Cinderella Suite at Disney World for her honeymoon. In a different filmmaker\u2019s hands, it\u2019d be a fitting way for the new dramedy to end. Anora (Mikey Madison) \u2014 or Ani, as she prefers \u2014 may not be a girl wasting away cleaning her evil stepmother and stepsisters\u2019 house, but as a stripper who still lives near New York\u2019s Brighton Beach with her sister, she does fit a kind of modern Cinderella archetype. In Ivan (Mark Eydelshteyn), the gangly, rich son of a Russian oligarch, she even finds her own possible Prince Charming.\nAnora, however, does not follow the same simple, Pretty Woman-esque path that its first act sets up. Instead, under the humanist, hilarious guide of writer-director Sean Baker, Anora assuredly zig-zags across its 139 minutes \u2014 becoming first an uplifting, dreams-come-true romance before suddenly careening into a nocturnal, one-long-night screwball comedy. The film is an ever-evolving farce \u2014 a class comedy about the folly of believing that sex and hope alone might be enough to buy you a better life \u2014 that respects its characters enough to not talk down to them.\nIt is decidedly not a fantasy, but there is an epic-ness to its empathy. Like Cinderella, there is also a heroine at the center of Anora whose dreams, hopes, and heartbreak are rendered so vibrantly that the film manages to reach out and wrap you in its embrace. While it\u2019s easy to imagine a world in which Anora could have concluded like a familiar fairy tale, too, the place where it ends up is far slippier, richer, and harder to forget than the words \u201chappily ever after\u201d could possibly hope to surmise. It\u2019s no wonder it won the Palme d\u2019Or at the Cannes Film Festival in May. It is as vital a piece of American filmmaking as any other we\u2019ve seen this year.\nWe are brought into the world of Anora first through a shimmering haze of purple, pink, and blue lights. As the opening chords and lines of Greatest Day by Take That play, this mirage of color gives way to women\u2019s bodies dancing on the laps of paying customers. At the end of this line of lap-dancers is Ani, whose confidence in the film\u2019s strip club world is evident in her well-practiced movements, closed eyes, and checked-out expression, the latter of which is conveniently hidden from her customers. In this moment, Baker and Madison efficiently make it clear that stripping is a job to Ani, and as we watch her charmingly talk other men into paying for her services, including convincing one to \u201cgo to an ATM\u201d with her, we realize just how good she is at it.\nHer usual routine is interrupted when she\u2019s asked by her boss to charm Ivan, a high-paying \u201cspender\u201d who has specifically requested a girl who can speak Russian. Ani, a Uzbek American who learned the language from her grandmother, is the right woman for the job. Shortly after she\u2019s arrived on Ivan\u2019s lap and the two have moved past their shared insecurity over their respective Russian and English speaking skills, Ani has convinced him to pay for a private dance. \u201cGod Bless America,\u201d he whispers only a quick cut later as Ani nakedly grinds on him while \u2014 in one of Anora\u2018s broadest sexual innuendos \u2014 popping a bubble of gum. Afterward, Ivan asks Ani if she\u2019s available \u201coutside of the club,\u201d and within several days, he\u2019s convinced her not only to come away with him on a well-paid trip to Vegas but also marry him.\nThis opening stretch is elevated by Baker\u2019s breathless filmmaking and Madison and Eydelshteyn\u2019s dueling lead performances. As Ivan, Eydelshteyn is the perfect embodiment of oblivious, boyish charm \u2014 one whose immaturity is offset by how confidently he spends his parents\u2019 money. Opposite him, Madison is mesmerizing. Baker\u2019s screenplay simultaneously resists painting Ani as a solely tragic figure and avoids overcompensating for Hollywood\u2019s bad track record when it comes to escorts by making her a perfect beacon of light. She is confident but intimated by Ivan\u2019s wealth, and Madison plays Ani\u2019s reaction to his proposal beautifully. There is a clear uncertainty in her eyes and voice \u2014 an innate understanding of Ivan\u2019s immaturity and, therefore, thoughtlessness \u2014 but also an understandable yearning to believe that maybe, just maybe, life could be as good and simple as he promises. Some fantasies, it turns out, are too alluring for even the most disillusioned of us to deny.\nIn the aftermath of their shotgun wedding, Ani and Ivan run around Vegas while Take That sings \u201cLet\u2019s make a new start/ The future is ours to find\u201d in Anora\u2018s sole reprisal of Greatest Day. This sequence, composed without an ounce of cynicism by Baker, will make you feel as though you are levitating in your seat. It doesn\u2019t take long, however, for Ani and Ivan\u2019s newlywed bliss to be destroyed. A few days later, a trio of henchmen \u2014 Toros (Karren Karagulian), Garnick (Vache Tovmasyan), and Igor (Yura Borisov) \u2014 sent by Ivan\u2019s father force their way into his New York mansion. They take a screaming Ani hostage after Ivan flees, and Toros demands that she help them find her husband and annul their \u201cfraud marriage\u201d before Ivan\u2019s parents make it to America. What follows is a shockingly funny nightlong search across New York that is tinged by Ani\u2019s growing fear that her new chapter is already closing before it\u2019s even begun.\nThis sickening feeling extends to the viewer. To say that Anora makes you pull for Ani would be a misrepresentation of its melancholic, humanist magic. You don\u2019t just root for her; she roots herself in you. Madison\u2019s performance, despite her brash Brooklyn accent, casts a quiet spell. Baker\u2019s film is ultimately not just one of screwball antics and real-life romantic fantasies but of glances, namely those between Ani and her fellow service workers, whether they be a Vegas hotel clerk Ivan plays a cruel joke on or a gas station attendant who is forced to listen to Toros and Garnick\u2019s bickering. In these silent exchanges exists an unspoken understanding and a collective 9-to-5 exhaustion. These are people whose shared perspective is made evident by their recognition of each other. It\u2019s not just that they hold the same view of the world; they see the world the same way because they see each other.\nBaker\u2019s visual focus on tiny glances pays off in Anora\u2018s breathtaking second half. Ani is too much of a fighter to ever let her increasing anxiety and sorrow spill into her words or body language. But Madison\u2019s eyes tell a different story than her character\u2019s steely New Yorker demeanor. In them, we see both Ani\u2019s world weariness and the desperate-optimism-bordering-on-delusion that forces her to believe Ivan might actually be enough of a Prince Charming to fight for her. It\u2019s this silent battle between hope and resignation, which Madison plays as delicately as Baker writes it, that allows Ani to grab a hold of your heart and squeeze you into increasing anxiety and heartbreak the more it looks like her dreams are on the verge of being broken.\nIt is fitting that Baker has named the film after his heroine. Madison\u2019s Ani is the heart and soul of Anora, and her dreams are its entire thematic landscape. In one of his most brilliant genre subversions, though, Baker does surround his heroine in Anora\u2018s back half with men who aren\u2019t all that unlike herself. Toros, Garnick, and Igor are quickly revealed to be little more than service workers themselves \u2014 ones who are barely equipped to take a scrappy fighter like Ani hostage. They are hounded by the same financial and career insecurities as her, and just as desperate to hold onto their livelihoods. At one point, Toros responds to Ani\u2019s begrudging help with a genuine, exhausted \u201cthank you.\u201d Ani also finds a sympathetic shoulder to lean on in Igor, who is given a surprising sensitivity and observant soul by Borisov, one of 2024\u2019s most unexpected scene stealers.\nIn Igor and Ani\u2019s bond, which develops \u2014 like everything else in Anora \u2014 beneath the surface of its absurdist plot, Baker is able to hone in on the film\u2019s subtextual, largely visual ideas about the nature of seeing and being seen. It\u2019s only after Igor begins to look at Ani head-on that we realize, with the benefit of hindsight, how much the early part of her and Ivan\u2019s relationship was defined by them not actually making eye contact with each other. It\u2019s perhaps because of this that Ivan is able to disregard the havoc he threatens to wreak on Ani\u2019s life, and she is able to momentarily look past the transactional, disconnected aspect of their relationship. It is, on the one hand, a gift to truly be seen by another person, but it is also terrifying and threatening to one\u2019s idea of oneself. Why else do you think all fairy tale romances begin with love at first sight?\nMadison\u2019s Ani, unfortunately, is not a princess. She may never reach the Cinderella Suite. That does not make her life a tragedy, though, and Anora, perhaps more than any of Baker\u2019s other films, knows this. It lies to neither her nor the viewer, but rather finds the space for her to feel the hope and the grief that awaits her at the end of her New York odyssey. It\u2019s a beautiful thing \u2014 realizing that there is more than one kind of happily ever after \u2014 but it is also heartbreaking. To accept a new ending for yourself is to let go of the one you\u2019ve spent your whole life wanting, and that is a loss that lodges itself in your heart and makes the entire world seem slower and quieter than it did before. So does Anora.\nAnora is playing in select theaters now."

      "text": "Gallons of ink, thick as monster blood, have already been spilled on Alien: Romulus. To some, Fede \u00c1lvarez\u2019s legacy sequel looked like the best Alien in ages \u2014 a winningly wet creature feature that took the franchise back to squishy basics. Others saw only a derivative Greatest Hits, content to echo past entries instead of putting its own mark on the series. Opinion, in other words, remains sharply divided on last summer\u2019s return voyage to a space where no one can hear you scream.\nOn one point, however, the Romulus defenders and skeptics do seem to have found some common ground. Ask just about anyone, and they\u2019ll tell you that the extended cameo arranged for a late actor from Alien is icky in all the wrong ways. If you\u2019ve seen the movie, you know the abominable scenes we\u2019re talking about. (Spoilers hereafter.) They\u2019re the ones where our young heroes stumble upon a busted android and plug him in, only to be greeted by the uncannily smoothed likeness (and voice) of Ian Holm, who played the treacherous synthetic Ash in the original Alien. This special effect is so ghastly that it rips a viewer right out of the film.\n\u00c1lvarez has heard your complaints about these scenes, and he\u2019s addressed them. Last week, the director told Empire that he had made some alterations to the most objectionable element of Romulus. Rook, the character \u201cplayed\u201d by \u201cHolm,\u201d was brought to life via a variety of different techniques \u2014 including an animatronic built around a casting of the actor\u2019s head from the Lord of the Rings movies. For the recent home-entertainment release of Romulus, \u00c1lvarez tinkered with the shots featuring Rook, supposedly pulling back on some of the digital enhancements (the CGI laid over the animatronic) to lean more heavily on the original practical effects. \u201cWe just ran out of time in post-production to get it right,\u201d he confesses, before concluding that the new changes \u201cfixed\u201d those problems.\nLook, any improvement to Rook is welcome. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that the android\u2019s appearance in Romulus qualifies as one of the most off-putting, distracting effects \u201cachievements\u201d in recent years, maybe ever. He looks shockingly shoddy \u2014 a video-game cutscene phantom too phony even to convince as a deliberately unreal approximation of humanity. His scenes tell the whole story of the Hollywood effects industry, where overtaxed, non-unionized artists are pressed to make unreasonable deadlines, and where studios are constantly concluding that audiences will simply accept bad effects work. Is it any surprise that the same entertainment conglomerate that released the last Ant-Man into theaters with unfinished CGI would look at the Rook scenes in Romulus and say \u201cgood enough\u201d?\nAll that said, \u201cfixed\u201d is probably overstating the changes \u00c1lvarez has made to those scenes for the Blu-ray release. (The version on Hulu appears to be identical to what theatrical audiences endured.) A side-by-side comparison reveals a strategic obscuring of the effects work \u2014 via shadows and widened shots \u2014 more than a total overhaul. Rook looks a little better, but he mostly remains as Romulus envisioned him: a deepfaked monstrosity. You\u2019re still not seeing much of the old-school puppetry \u00c1lvarez has bragged about in interviews. He\u2019s still a chiefly digital illusion.\nAnyway, to get hung up on the quality (or lack thereof) of the effects work is to miss the larger point. The real problem with Rook, as Romulus conceived him, could not be solved with a mere patch or remaster. His very presence feels like more than just an aesthetic mistake. It\u2019s a walking (or, well, crawling) ethical violation. Simply put, by resurrecting the visage of a deceased actor, \u00c1lvarez has committed a fundamentally ghoulish \u2014 and, unfortunately, increasingly common \u2014 act of digital grave-robbing. It was gross way back in 2004, when the widely forgotten Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow cast the long-dead Laurence Olivier as a hologram of malevolence. And it remained gross in Rogue One and Ghostbusters: Afterlife and The Flash.\n\u00c1lvarez has been quick to report that he sought and received the blessing of Holm\u2019s estate before embarking on this misguided, 21st-century weekend at Bernie\u2019s. But we\u2019re still talking about the ventriloquizing of an actor who had no say in how his likeness is being used. That the filmmaker deployed AI to achieve some approximation of his famously regal voice is a double whammy of dystopian technological offense: Lakes were evaporated to create the unnerving, unconvincing illusion that a dead person said things that he didn\u2019t. All of this is closely related to the growing deepfake dilemma, as well as the issue of digitizing actors raised during the SAG-AFTRA strikes of 2023. No, there\u2019s no confusing Rook for the real Ian Holm. But he\u2019s also not capable of objecting to his \u201ccasting.\u201d Are we staring down the barrel of a future where we lose all control of our image after we die?\nAgain, this is nowhere Disney hasn\u2019t been before. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, an otherwise pretty stirring act of intellectual-property extension, crossed the very same ethical boundaries nearly a decade ago with the equally unsettling necromancy of Peter Cushing. Holm\u2019s unwitting appearance in Romulus is an omen for the future of the franchise, too. It says that the Mouse House will probably treat Alien the way it\u2019s treated Star Wars: like a nostalgia object to be milked ad nauseam in the years to come. In that sense, you could call Rook a canary in the coal mine; his appearance is a warning about where the series will likely go from here now that Disney has added this Fox property to its portfolio.\nHe\u2019s also a microcosm for the whole pandering spirit of the movie. Romulus is very much in keeping with the J.J. Abrams school of legacy sequels, designed mostly to deliver Pavolovian cues to salivate for the comfort food of old box-office hits. It\u2019s a Disneyfied Alien \u2014 not in severity (you\u2019d never mistake its gooey violence for an all-ages play), but certainly in the way it turns a beloved franchise into a theme park of secondhand pleasures. \u00c1lvarez has some fun with the material; the movie\u2019s best set pieces, like a swarm of scurrying Facehuggers and a precarious zero-g ballet, show us things we\u2019ve never seen in an Alien movie before. But those moments are wedged between a barrage of winking callbacks to everything we already have.\nNarratively speaking, there\u2019s no reason Rook needed to look or sound like Holm\u2019s Ash. After all, he\u2019s not the same android, or even necessarily the same model. Any actor could have played him. As some have suggested, it might have been more resonant to hand the role to David Jonsson, who stars as the synthetic Andy. But of course that wouldn\u2019t directly trigger any fan\u2019s nostalgia receptors. Rook looks like Holm because the whole character is an Easter egg, like the pulse rifle or the Prometheus music cue or the scene where Jonsson nonsensically calls the Xenomorph a bitch. That\u2019s the only real function this CGI body-snatching serves. A real human being\u2019s likeness has been (hideously) replicated for no higher purpose than a passing chill of spot-the-reference recognition.\nThen again, maybe there\u2019s an extra layer of dark subtext to those misbegotten scenes and that horrendous digital puppet. Romulus, like almost all of the Alien movies, is really about the horror of capitalism, a force as soulless and carnivorous and uncaring as H.R. Giger\u2019s space bug. What better way to underscore the corporate world\u2019s disrespect for human life than to turn a beloved dead actor into a sock puppet for IP branding, a glorified Marvel cameo from beyond the grave? When it comes to treating people like exploitable, expendable assets, Disney could give Weyland-Yutani a run for its blood money.\nAlien: Romulus is now available on Blu-ray, where the Rook scenes look marginally less terrible, and streaming on Hulu, where they don\u2019t."

      "text": "\u201cLonglegs starring Nicolas Cage is all creepy effect all the time.\u201d\n- It looks hauntingly beautiful\n- The style is arresting\n- Maika Monroe is a superb scream queen\n- The story is derivative boilerplate\n- The creepy power fades\n- Nicolas Cage overdoes the madman shtick\n\u201cWhy you can trust Digital Trends \u2013 We have a 20-year history of testing, reviewing, and rating products, services and apps to help you make a sound buying decision. Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nThe early reactions to Longlegs have been almost hysterical in their steel-your-nerves, hide-your-children hyperbole. You\u2019d think people were being fit for straitjackets on the way out of screenings based on how they\u2019re talking about the film. In truth, this doomy occult killer thriller, scurrying into theaters this weekend on spindly legs of breathless hype, isn\u2019t an onslaught of scares. But it does offer its own kind of overkill. Less interested in rattling nerves than slipping under the skin, the movie immediately cranks the atmosphere of foreboding unease to 11 and leaves it there. There\u2019s scarcely a single scene that doesn\u2019t strain relentlessly to give you the willies. If it fails to creep anyone out, it sure won\u2019t be for a lack of trying.\nIn the early 1990s, a string of unsolved murders has baffled the authorities: Parents turn on their children, as if possessed by a homicidal spirit. Longlegs itself seems a bit possessed. Every moment of this film has a touch of almost pushy malevolence. The camera slowly zooms in on the most banal details with a voyeuristic fixation. The story, cleaved into chapters, lurches forward with sudden stings of cruelly disorienting volume \u2014 the transitional equivalent of jump scares. There\u2019s a cursed quality to the indoor scenes, bathed in sickly orange incandescence and filmed to emphasize the tomblike claustrophobia of dens and basements. And the dialogue chokes on dead air, the suffocating silence between words.\nThe director, Oz Perkins, has a gift for tuning every aspect of a film \u2014 composition, pacing, performance, you name it \u2014 to a particular frequency of consuming dread. Right from the opening frames, Longlegs finds him working that diabolical mojo. It commences with an abbreviated 1970s flashback of something wicked this way coming. Perkins shoots his prologue, in which a station wagon parks on the edge of a country home and a little girl comes out to meet the lanky stranger skulking into her yard, in a strikingly boxy aspect ratio. The muted colors and beveled corners of the frame suggest a slideshow of family photos perverted by sudden danger. The movie has barely begun, and we\u2019re already under its spell.\nThe stranger is the eponymous menace, a mysterious figure somehow responsible for the killings. (He confesses his culpability via letters rife with biblical portent and written in a Zodiac-like cipher.) Is he the heir apparent to Charles Manson, exerting a persuasive influence over the slain families? Or is something more supernatural going on? Longlegs guides us into the mystery with a clammy hand on the shoulder. On the case is Lee Harker (Maika Monroe), a rookie FBI agent with a touch of clairvoyance. She\u2019s introduced correctly pinpointing the home of a killer at large, who promptly shoots her partner dead at the front door \u2014 an early shock in a thriller generally heavier on mood than mayhem.\nHarker is an antisocial, possibly neurodivergent workaholic of cop-movie vintage. She has an uneasy relationship with her religious mother (Alicia Witt), a personal conflict destined to become tangled in an investigation with serious satanic undertones. During one early telephone conversation with Mom, she confesses to not saying her prayers, after which Perkins immediately cuts to a wide shot of a staircase looming behind her, reaching up to a closed door and the less-than-comforting glow of light behind it. Monroe, the perennially haunted star of It Follows, The Guest, and Watcher, makes the heroine\u2019s stock introversion compelling. No modern scream queen better laces fear through curiosity.\nLonglegs has the expected flashes of forensic gore, along with visions of savage violence. The most shocking thing about the movie, though, might be how conventional it turns out to be. Beneath the all-out assault of unholy style, this is a fairly straightforward, even derivative manhunt thriller. Perkins cobbles together his story from other touchstones of the genre: Thomas Harris procedurals, classics of cult horror, even the weekly gumshoeing of Mulder and Scully. Harker, whose rapport with her new partner (Blair Underwood) never evolves beyond boilerplate patter, is basically Clarice Starling combined with Will Graham. And the case itself unfolds through the usual corkboard of crime-scene photos and chased leads.\nThe more the movie comes together, the more it loses its coiling-snake hold over the viewer. It\u2019s no spoiler to say that we eventually meet the killer, and he\u2019s brought to life by none other than Hollywood\u2019s undisputed maestro of oddball intensity and enunciation, Nicolas Cage. With his stringy hair, lurching Slenderman gate, and pasty white features, Longlegs certainly doesn\u2019t look like any character the star has played before. But Cage overdoes the squealing lunatic theatrics, pushing this bogeyman\u2019s psychosis so over the top that it passes \u201cscary\u201d and approaches \u201ccampy.\u201d We\u2019ve been primed to meet the devil, and instead we\u2019re faced with \u2026 Nicolas Cage, doing some typically uninhibited wild man shtick.\nThe film, like its villainous star performance, is only superficially disturbing. It\u2019s all creepy effect all the time. What Longlegs lacks is the psychological dimension of the milestones it\u2019s evoking \u2014 the feeling of being pulled into the warped mind of either the killer or those chasing him. Silence of the Lambs obviously had that gripping power. So do the serial-killer potboilers of David Fincher, driven by their obscene obsession with obsession. In those movies, we saw evil from the inside. Perkins keeps us on the outside looking in, especially when his distorting anamorphic imagery turns the screen into a fishbowl. We\u2019re not so much immersed in a world corrupted by dark forces as left to tap on its glass.\nThis is an unusual problem for the filmmaker, whose previous movies enveloped you emotionally in their dark narratives. His debut, a wintry prep-school slow burn alternately called February and The Blackcoat\u2019s Daughter, scrambled the chronology of a satanic awakening, emerging with something oddly sad and sinister. His second feature, the Netflix-holed I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House, was even more singular: a whispery ghost story with a strangely literary appeal, made in the key of Shirley Jackson. These were suggestive nightmares, unfashionable even in an age of vibes-forward horror. Longlegs applies their tricks without their restraint. At times, it feels like a series of spooky images and moments in search of a movie. No wonder it\u2019s spawned such a brilliantly seductive marketing campaign.\nThe last hour of the film descends into a labyrinth of revelations, as Harker\u2019s pursuit leads her down memory lane and into a fresh inferno of understanding. But because we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of her soul, or the deranged imagination of the monster she\u2019s hunting, these twists pack no real punch; it\u2019s like if Silence of the Lambs never gave us that haunting anecdote behind its title. By the end of Longlegs, Perkins\u2019 blitzkrieg of knuckle-whitening devices, however stylish and arresting, has begun to look like a poor substitute for real terror of the lingering kind. Even if it does get under your skin, its dread is purely skin-deep.\nLonglegs is now playing in theaters everywhere. For more of A.A. Dowd\u2019s writing, please visit his Authory page."
