  "description": "SO how did the club with the richest owners in world football turn into the Tottenham of the North? Why are so many of the most-wanted players in Europe swiping left on the chance to join Newcastle\u2026",
  "content": "The Toon have been snubbed by several key targets\n\nTOON-ING OUT Why Newcastle have become the new Tottenham after getting rejected by stars despite having richest owners in football\n\nSO how did the club with the richest owners in world football turn into the Tottenham of the North?\n\nWhy are so many of the most-wanted players in Europe swiping left on the chance to join Newcastle United?\n\nA club which won its first domestic silverware in 70 years, qualified for the Champions League and boasts a vast, fanatical support, should have been enjoying a transformative summer.\n\nThe euphoria of clinching the Carabao Cup, then heading back into the European elite, was supposed to serve as a launchpad for the Geordie Arabia revolution.\n\nInstead, tumbleweed is blowing across Tyneside as Newcastle risk losing the transfer window due to a combination of neglect, misfortune and the ongoing restrictions of PSR regulations.\n\nAlexander Isak is trying to engineer a move to Liverpool, while Benjamin Sesko prefers lowly, Europe-free Manchester United over St James\u2019 Park.\n\nThe Slovenian striker is expected to join Hugo Ekitike, Joao Pedro, Bryan Mbeumo, Liam Delap, Dean Huijsen and James Trafford among a long list of players to have snubbed the Toon this summer.\n\nIt\u2019s normally only Spurs who suffer such an embarrassing sequence of \u2018thanks, but no thanks\u2019 messages during a transfer window.\n\nIsak\u2019s desire to join the Premier League champions stems back to Newcastle\u2019s unwillingness to grant him a significant rise on his \u00a3120,000-per-week wages.\n\nThe Swede is the jewel in Newcastle\u2019s crown - the closest thing to Thierry Henry in the current era, with his 23 Premier League goals bettered only by Mo Salah last season.\n\nBEST ONLINE CASINOS - TOP SITES IN THE UK\n\nIf Isak leaves, it would seriously damage Newcastle's reputation as a club hell-bent on disrupting the status quo and establishing itself as one of Europe\u2019s biggest clubs.\n\nBut PSR has made it impossible for the Saudis to follow the lead of those previous filthy-rich \u2018disruptors\u2019 Roman Abramovich at Chelsea and Sheikh Mansour at Manchester City.\n\nNewcastle are unable to blow rivals out of the water on transfer fees and wages. Any assault on world domination must be a waiting game.\n\nAnd time is not on Isak\u2019s side, as a 25-year-old reaching the peak of his powers.\n\nWhile an excellent coach who has overperformed throughout most of his career, Eddie Howe is not a dynamic hardman well-suited to dealing with a situation like Isak\u2019s stand-off.\n\nAnd with Sesko preferring a move to Old Trafford, Newcastle\u2019s frustrations in trying to sign a striker - as a potential replacement for Isak, or to boost their existing squad - are being continually frustrated.\n\nAs Alan Shearer says, \u2018it is not a good look\u2019 and the summer has been a \u2018nightmare\u2019.\n\nSo far, winger Anthony Elanga has been Newcastle\u2019s only major signing, in a \u00a355million move from Nottingham Forest.\n\nAnd as Howe looks to juggle the demands of the Premier League and Champions League, Newcastle\u2019s squad looks worryingly thin.\n\nTRANSFER NEWS LIVE - KEEP UP WITH ALL THE LATEST FROM A BUSY SUMMER WINDOW\n\nWhile PSR continues to stifle ambitions, the club does have financial wriggle room to spend this summer - hence their bids for Sesko and several other forwards.\n\nYet there is a major power vacuum at the club, with sporting director Paul Mitchell having left in August after a brief and vexatious spell, while chief executive Darren Eales handed in his notice last year due to a serious health condition.\n\nTo leave both positions vacant during such a pivotal summer looks like carelessness.\n\nThis comes after the departures of Amanda Staveley and her husband Mehrdad Ghodoussi last summer, which wiped away the public face of Newcastle\u2019s Saudi ownership and added to the impression of a rudderless ship.\n\nThere are fears among the club\u2019s support that their Saudi paymasters are indifferent to the club.\n\nThe sporting interests of the Saudi Public Investment Fund are wide and varied - including ventures into golf, boxing and tennis as well as its stakes in four Saudi Pro-League clubs.\n\nWith Saudi Arabia set to host the World Cup in 2034, there are many other sporting priorities on which to focus - without PSR hindrances.\n\nThe Premier League attempted to block Newcastle\u2019s Saudi takeover in the first place and its clubs are determined to hold them back.\n\nIt would be ever so cute to imagine that those rivals are motivated by a distaste for the severe human-rights abuses of the Saudi regime. In truth, it is all about self-interest.\n\nNewcastle\u2019s training facilities remain well short of elite level and plans to expand St James\u2019 Park or build a new stadium remain under wraps.\n\nThere is no sense of urgency or focus about the club and this is acknowledged by many shakers and movers in the transfer market.\n\nYet for Isak, and for any world-class target, there will always be an urgency to win trophies and earn sackloads of money in a short career.",
