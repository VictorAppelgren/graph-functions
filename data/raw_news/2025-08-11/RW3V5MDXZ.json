  "title": "$200 off: Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE discounted for the first time",
  "description": "Samsung's budget flip phone is even cheaper today! Get the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE for just $699.99 while you can!",
  "content": "Samsung\u2019s new foldable phones are exciting, but most are pretty expensive. The only exception is the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE, which usually costs $899.99. Today, we\u2019re taking a look at its first actual discount, which will save you $200 on the retail price. Buy the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE for just $699.99 ($200 off)\n\nThis offer is available from Amazon. The discount applies to both available colors. These include Black and White. We\u2019re specifically referring to the 128GB storage model. The one with 256GB is $200 off, but it is pricier at on sale for $759.99.\n\nDespite only being released late last month, today we\u2019re taking a look at the first discount on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE. Before today, we had only seen offers that included a storage upgrade and/or a free gift card with the purchase, so it\u2019s nice to see an actual discount! The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is already the most affordable foldable phone of the most recent line-up, so think of this as savings on top of savings.\n\nAlthough this device is priced at $699.99, it is still a very capable phone. Its Exynos 2400 processor can handle pretty much any app, game, or task most people will use. After all, it\u2019s the same processor found on the international models of the Galaxy S24 series. It also features 8GB of RAM, which is nothing impressive these days, but it will handle most people\u2019s multitasking needs very well. Most casual users without specialized needs will notice no difference compared to a high-end, premium model.\n\nThe camera system won\u2019t be among the best, but it should take very decent photos. You get a 50MP primary camera and a 12MP ultrawide shooter. The battery is on the smaller side at 4,000mAh, but this is a common downside with foldable phones. It can charge at 25W wired or 15W wirelessly. You still get an aluminum frame and an IP48 rating.\n\nAll things considered, this is a really good phone for just $699.99. It\u2019s an especially nice deal considering it\u2019s such a new phone and Samsung\u2019s only foldable phone on sale. Get it while it\u2019s hot!\n\nIf you\u2019re still not sure, though, we also have a list of the best foldable phones with plenty of alternatives.",

Learn more.\nWaterproof tech: Everything you need to know about IP and ATM ratings\nMarch 7, 2025\nWaterproof tech has become a big trend in recent years. But how do you know how protected your device is? Most devices use either an IP or ATM ratings. Let\u2019s start by talking about what an IP rating is. Most high-end smartphones these days have an IP68 rating. These include the Samsung Galaxy S25 series, Apple iPhone 16 series, and Google Pixel 9 series. Some can even go up to IP69, but that is rare. What does all of this even mean, though? Let\u2019s dig into it.\nWhat is an IP rating?\nYou probably know that IP ratings have something to do with protection from water and dust, but if you are reading this, that may be as far as your understanding goes.\nAn IP rating tells you the level of protection a device offers against solids and liquids. The International Electrotechnical Commission sets these standards. The \u201cIP\u201d stands for Ingress Protection (or International Protection) and is followed by two numbers. The first number indicates the level of protection against solid particles (dust, dirt, etc.) and ranges from one to six. The second number tells you how much water a device can handle without suffering damage, and it goes from one to nine \u2014 the higher the number, the better the protection against liquids. Check out the chart below for detailed info on what each number means:\n| Level | Solids (first number) | Liquids (second number) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Level 1 | Solids (first number) Protected against solid objects over 50mm (example: hands). | Liquids (second number) Protected against vertically falling drops of water. |\n| Level 2 | Solids (first number) Protected against solid objects over 12mm (example: fingers). | Liquids (second number) Protected against direct sprays of water up to 15 degrees from the vertical. |\n| Level 3 | Solids (first number) Protected against solid objects over 2.5mm (example: tools and wires). | Liquids (second number) Protected against direct sprays of water up to 60 degrees from the vertical. |\n| Level 4 | Solids (first number) Protected against solid objects over 1mm (example: small wires). | Liquids (second number) Protected against water sprayed from all directions. |\n| Level 5 | Solids (first number) Dust protected \u2014 limited ingress of dust permitted. | Liquids (second number) Protected against jets of water from all directions. |\n| Level 6 | Solids (first number) Dust-tight \u2014 no ingress of dust permitted. | Liquids (second number) Protected against powerful jets of water from all directions. |\n| Level 7 | Solids (first number) / | Liquids (second number) Protected against the effects of immersion in water \u2014 between 15 cm (5.9 inches) and 1 meter (3.3 feet) for up to 30 minutes. |\n| Level 8 | Solids (first number) / | Liquids (second number) Protected against the effects of long periods of immersion in water under pressure. Usually 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) of immersion for up to 30 minutes. |\n| Level 9 | Solids (first number) / | Liquids (second number) Protected against high pressure and temperature water jets. The device needs to survive 30 seconds of 14-16 liters directed at the phone from multiple angles, at an 80-degree Celsius temperature. |\nAs you can tell by the chart above, a handset with an IP67 rating is entirely dust-tight and will survive in up to one meter of water (3.3 feet) for up to 30 minutes. An IP68-rated device is also completely dust-tight. It is protected against the effects of long periods of immersion in water, which usually means it will survive in up to 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) of water for 30 minutes. If a phone is IP69 rated, it means it can also handle really hot water under high pressure.\nIP69 ratings are still a bit rare in smartphones, but the list is growing. Some popular phones with an IP69 rating include the OnePlus 13, HONOR Magic 7 Pro, OPPO Find N5, and the Moto G Power 2025.\nYou\u2019ve probably also heard of an IP69K rating. This one isn\u2019t relevant to smartphones. IP69K ratings are provided to equipment made for road vehicles. It ensures that the rated product can withstand severe washes using pressure washers.\nWater-resistant, but not waterproof\nEven if a smartphone has a high IP rating, it may not be completely waterproof. You can drop a phone with an IP68 rating in a freshwater pond, or a tub, and it should be fine. However, if that phone is dipped in a chlorinated pool, or in the ocean, which has saltwater, that could cause problems.\nManufacturers are always quick to tell you water resistance is not a permanent state. The rubber seals and gaskets that usually protect a high IP-rated phone from water damage could be weakened over time. This could decrease the device\u2019s overall water resistance over time. Those same seals can erode if a smartphone encounters coffee, soft drinks, or champagne spills.\nRemember that a phone\u2019s IP rating is based on closed lab conditions, not real-world situations. In other words, try to keep your phone dry, even if it might have a high IP rating.\nAdditionally, a phone that has been damaged is likely no longer waterproof. Water can leak into the device through cracks.\nATM Rating\nThere\u2019s another rating to consider for devices, especially for smartwatches; the ATM (Atmospheres) rating system indicates how much static atmospheric pressure a device can deal with while in water. It\u2019s actually an older rating system than the IP certification. A rating of 1 ATM means that you are at sea level, outside of water. If a device has a 1 ATM level listed, don\u2019t put it in water under any circumstances.\nThe system is actually much simpler to understand. Each ATM number represents about 10 meters of depth. So, if you have a device with an ATM 3 rating, you should be able to submerge it as deep as 30 meters. An ATM 10 rating increases the depth to 100 meters, and so on. These are usually used in smartwatches and other more specialized tech.\nHere\u2019s a look at the ATM rating system.\n| Rating | Pressure | Device Meaning |\n|---|---|---|\n| Rating 1 ATM | Pressure 0. | Device Meaning Do not put in water. |\n| Rating 3 ATM | Pressure Under 100 feet. | Device Meaning Device can be used in the rain, and protected against splashes. |\n| Rating 5 ATM | Pressure Under 165 feet. | Device Meaning Device can last for short amounts of time submerged in water, like swimming in a pool. |\n| Rating 10 ATM | Pressure Under 330 feet. | Device Meaning Device can last for much longer amounts of time submerged in water, such as for snorkeling in the ocean. |\n| Rating 20 ATM | Pressure Under 660 feet. | Device Meaning Device can handle being used for high impact water sports like surfing and jet skiing. |\nMilitary ready standards\nYou may be wondering if there are any tougher handsets out there. Military certifications guarantee \u201ccombat-ready\u201d smartphones that can handle all kinds of damage. MIL-STD-810G-certified smartphones go through a series of 29 tests. These include exposure to shock, vibration, heat, cold, gunfire shock, humidity, and more. You can learn more about these in the link below. There\u2019s also the improved MIL-STD-810H now, which goes through 30 tests.\nThese MIL-STD ratings are usually reserved for rugged devices. Here\u2019s our list of the best rugged phones, if you want to take a look at some options.\nLooking after your devices\nAn IP or ATM rating gives you peace of mind if you pick up your device with wet hands, accidentally drop it in the pool, or use it in the rain. Without it, there is no reassurance a device will survive some liquid exposure.\nHowever, that does not mean your smartphone is invincible. Here are some quick tips to ensure you will get the most out of your smartphone:\n- If you decide to take your phone in the water, make sure to cover all the ports. Those may include SIM and microSD card slots. Your USB power port may also have a cover.\n- If you take your phone into a chlorinated pool, wash it off with fresh water when you take it out. Don\u2019t use soap or chemicals.\n- Your phone should stay away from saltwater, like the water found in the ocean.\n- Avoid using your phone in extreme locations, including places with high heat, like a sauna, or rough environments.\n- If your phone goes into the water, dry it off thoroughly before plugging other accessories into their ports. That includes your USB phone charger or wired headphones if the phone has a headphone jack. Also, don\u2019t use a hairdryer to dry off your phone; use a dry cloth.\n- Remove any hair or other small objects that you might see inside your phone\u2019s covers and ports. Even small amounts of dirt could damage your microSD card slot, USB power ports, or headphone jack.\n- One last recommendation we can give you is to always have smartphone insurance. You never know when something can go wrong. Also, read your insurance\u2019s terms, as some might not cover water damage, especially when caused by willful actions.\nConsider getting a waterproof pouch\nIf you must take your phone underwater, we recommend investing in a second layer of protection. Waterproof pouches are a great way to keep your expensive electronics safe when submerged in liquids. Here\u2019s a really good one from CaliCase.\nFAQs\nIP ratings are standards that measure how much a product can withstand solids and liquids. It stands for Ingress Protection, and two numbers follow it. The first measures how much the unit can handle solids, while the second number measures liquid resistance.\nThe best smartphones usually come with an IP68 rating. This makes them dust-tight and protected against immersion up to 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes. Some rugged devices take it a step further and also get IP69 certification, which means they can withstand pressured hot water.\nSmartphones don\u2019t usually come with ATM ratings. These ratings are reserved for watches and other products you might take to deeper depths.\nThe most resistant rugged devices come with a MIL-STD rating. Usually MIL-STD-810H, but some devices still have the older MIL-STD-810G rating. These devices go through a wide variety of tests, and can generally handle more damage, such as shock, high pressures, extreme temperatures, and more.\nSome phones don\u2019t have excellent IP ratings. This means it might be unsafe to get them in contact with water. That said, you can always get a waterproof phone pouch and add a layer of protection to any device.\nSay the worst has already happened, and you\u2019ve already water-damaged your smartphone. We have a guide for fixing water-damaged phones. Just keep in mind none of these methods are guaranteed to work. You might need a new phone.

Here are our 5 top recommendations\nFebruary 25, 2025\nWhile the concept of foldable phones has been around for a while, consumers didn\u2019t get hands-on with one until 2018. Samsung was among the first to enter the scene, quickly becoming the biggest player and the only major option in the US. Thankfully, that has changed recently, with Google, Motorola, and even OnePlus helping push foldables to new heights. If you\u2019re looking for a foldable phone today, you have more options than ever. So in this article, let\u2019s examine the best foldable phones on the market and whether or not they would be a great fit for you.\nThe best foldable phones: At a glance\n- Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold: A major upgrade to the original Pixel Fold, bringing it up to compete with Samsung\u2019s more established Fold.\n- Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6: The most established tablet-phone hybrid, with several features designed to take full advantage of its unique form factor.\n- OnePlus Open: OnePlus\u2019 first foldable, offering a unique Canvas UI and top-notch imaging specs, though priced slightly higher than its reputation might suggest.\n- Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6: Not all foldables are designed to turn into tablets. Looking for a flip phone experience? Samsung delivers the gold standard here, adding a bigger flex window than ever before.\n- Motorola Razr 2024: The Razr 2024 has further refined its flip phone design both on the inside and out, which includes greatly improved software and cameras as well.\nNot sure what you\u2019re looking for in a foldable or if they are even a good fit? We have a guide on how to find the right foldable phones at the bottom of this page (hit the jump link to go there now).\nNow that you know what you\u2019re looking for, let\u2019s dive a bit deeper into each model and who they are for.\nEditor\u2019s note: We will update this foldable phone list as more devices hit the market.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold\n- Release date: September 4, 2023\n- When can you expect a successor? Fall of 2025\nThe Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold shares much in common with the Pixel Fold but brings a much-needed extra coat of polish. The result is a device that is incredibly thin for a foldable, despite offering a larger 8-inch display than its competition. It\u2019s powered by the same Google Tensor G4 found in the Pixel 9 series and backed by 16GB of RAM, with storage options up to 512GB. While the battery is about 171mAh smaller than the Pixel Fold\u2019s, the battery life on the Pixel 9 Pro is similar and should easily last a full day\u2019s use.\nWhile the specs are impressive, the real magic lies in the foldable experience. Thankfully, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold steps it up here.\nNot only does the new design fold flat, but you can hardly see the crease compared to the previous model. Even better news: the Pixel 9 Pro ditches the Pixel Fold\u2019s odd aspect ratio, adopting a design that\u2019s more like a traditional smartphone display rather than the passport-style seen previously. The new 8-inch display isn\u2019t just bigger\u2014its new aspect ratio means it no longer defaults to landscape mode. The older display would add black bars around many apps due to its unique aspect ratio, one of the device\u2019s biggest downsides.\nPixel Fold specs:\n- Display: 8-inch 2,076 x 2,152 and 6.3-inch 2,424 x 1,080\n- SoC: Tensor G4\n- RAM: 16GB\n- Storage: 256/512GB\n- Cameras: 48, 10.5, 10.8MP\n- Front camera: 10MP external, 10MP internal\n- Battery: 4,650mAh typical, 4,727 minimum\n- Software: Android 13\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6\n- Release date: July 24, 2024\n- When can you expect a successor? Summer of 2025\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is the latest and greatest foldable device from Samsung, bringing a host of improvements over its successor including a slightly larger footprint, a more traditional-looking cover screen, a better hinge, and more durability and polish than ever before. It\u2019s also a bit lighter too!\nThe main display is quite big when unfolded at 7.6 inches, while the smaller one comes in at 6.3 inches, which is just a hair bigger than last year. You also get an IPX8 rating, something you won\u2019t find on all the devices on this list.\nIf you want power and performance, the Fold 6 delivers thanks to its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor.\nReally what truly makes the Fold 6 stick out is that Samsung has been building foldable phones for years, meaning it\u2019s had plenty of time to refine its hardware and software. One UI lets you run three apps at a time, keep different home screens for the external and internal displays, and so much more. There are also a growing number of great AI features on board too.\nGalaxy Z Fold 6 specs\n- Foldable Display: 7.6-inch,AMOLED 2x\n- Cover screen: 6.3-inch AMOLED 2x\n- Chipset: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3\n- RAM: 12GB\n- Storage: 256GB/512GB/1TB\n- Cameras: 3x rear cameras (50MP/12MP/10MP)\n- Front camera: 10MP, 4MP\n- Battery: 4,440mAh\n- Software: Android 14\nOnePlus Open\n- Release date: October 26, 2023\n- When can you expect a successor? Early 2025\nDo you feel like the foldables above are a bit too expensive? The OnePlus Open isn\u2019t exactly cheap, but it is slightly less expensive at $1,699.99. It is no slouch, either. In our OnePlus Open review, we found that this device is quite capable, and we had very little to complain about. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and 16GB of RAM offer great performance, as you\u2019d expect. Battery life is also among the best we\u2019ve seen in a larger foldable; we would usually average close to a day and a half. The 67W SuperVOOC charging is also super fast, and surprisingly, for OnePlus, these cameras are actually quite outstanding.\nUnfortunately, the Open might be the least durable option on this list, as the IPX4 rating is pretty disappointing. It\u2019s also the only option that doesn\u2019t offer wireless charging. Its software also doesn\u2019t have the level of polish that you\u2019d find with Samsung. You can\u2019t specify a different homescreen experience of the internal and external display and there\u2019s a bit more general glitchness when even compared to the Pixel Fold. On the bright side, some of its features like its unique Canvas feature that lets you run three apps but minimize them off to the side, help it stand out from its competitors.\nThe OnePlus One is a great first attempt and is probably one of the few OnePlus products I\u2019d recommend, but just be aware it may take it a few years to truly reach the same level las some of its competitors in this space.\nOpen specs:\n- Interior Display: 7.82-inch LTPO3 Flexi-fluid AMOLED with 120Hz\n- External Display: 6.31-inch LTPO3 Super Fluid OLED with 120Hz\n- SoC: Snapdragon 8 Gen 2\n- RAM: 16GB\n- Storage: 512GB\n- Cameras: 64, 48, and 48MP\n- Front camera: 20MP, 32MP\n- Battery: 4,805mAh\n- Software: Android 13\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 6\n- Release date: July 24, 2024\n- When can you expect a successor? Likely in the summer of 2025\nSo far, all the options on this list have been full-sized phones that turn into tablets, but what about foldable flip phones? That\u2019s where the Flip series comes in. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 isn\u2019t nearly as big of an update aesthetically as the Fold 6 but it does see quite a few major improvements under the hood. The camera gets a major update, ditching its 12MP shooter for a new 50MP main camera that\u2019s in line with the Galaxy S24\u2019s main shooter. The 12MP ultrawide lens remains the same, however. Beyond the camera, there\u2019s also plenty of new AI features and an upgrade to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.\nThe Flip 6 should also handle heat better than ever before, thanks to the addition of a vapor chamber cooling system for the first time on the Z Flip series. The RAM has also jumped up from 8GB to 12GB, which should let it handle modern gaming and other high-performance activities without skipping a beat.\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 6 is the most affordable folding option from Samsung in 2024, so it might just be the springboard the company needs to reach the masses. It is also made beautifully and offers a great experience.\nGalaxy Z Flip 6 specs\n- Internal Display: 6.7-inch,AMOLED 2x\n- Cover screen: 3.4-inch AMOLED 2x\n- Chipset: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3\n- RAM: 12GB\n- Storage: 256GB/512GB\n- Cameras: 2x rear cameras (50MP/12MP)\n- Front camera: 12MP\n- Battery: 4,000mAh\n- Software: Android 14\nMotorola Razr (2024)\n- Release date: July 24, 2024\n- When can you expect a successor? Summer 2025\nMotorola has been in the foldable game for a few years, but it\u2019s really upped its game recently. While the Plus shined brighter than the cheaper Razr last year, things have flipped a bit. The Mediatek Dimensity 7300X does a great job in almost every task you through at it, which makes it a great option considering it starts at just $700. Now if you want the absolute best performance the Plus is still a solid choice, just that the gap between the two models has shrunk considerably this year.\nOverall the Motorola Razr family continues to impress though it\u2019s not all perfect. The Razr Plus has less than average battery life and lacks ultrawide, while the Razr has limited zoom capabilities. Software support also remains a weakness compared to Samsung and Google\u2019s 7-year update and security fix pledge though it does at least offer 3 full yeas of OS updates and 4 years of bi-monthly security patches.\nExpanded cover displays\nSmooth, ad-free software\nRazr (2024) specs:\n- Display: 6.9-inch and 3.6-inch\n- Internal display: 6.9-inch LTPO pOLED\n- External display: 3.6-inch AMOLED\n- SoC: MediaTek Dimensity 7300X\n- RAM: 8GB\n- Storage: 256GB\n- Camera: 50MP and 13MP\n- Front camera: 32MP\n- Battery: 4,200mAh\n- Software: Android 14\nRazr Plus (2024) specs:\n- Display: 6.9-inch and 4-inch\n- Internal display: 6.9-inch LTPO pOLED\n- External display: 4-inch OLED\n- SoC: Snapdragon 8s Gen 3\n- RAM: 12GB\n- Storage: 256GB\n- Camera: 50MP and 50MP\n- Front camera: 32MP\n- Battery: 4,000mAh\n- Software: Android 14\nHow to find the right foldable for your needs\nIf you\u2019ve landed on this page, chances are you\u2019re seriously considering purchasing a foldable phone. But how do you choose the right one? The first step is to determine whether a foldable phone is actually a good fit for you. Once you\u2019ve established that, you need to consider what you want from your device:\n- Are you drawn to the flip phone style for its cool factor and pocketability?\n- Are you looking for a device that transforms into a larger tablet for enhanced productivity?\n- How important is your budget?\nLet\u2019s dive deeper into these considerations.\nAre foldable phones worth it?\nThey may be all the hype these days, but are foldable phones worth it? Despite their appeal, they tend to be more expensive and less durable than traditional candy bar phones. As someone who has used the Z Flip, Z Flip 3, and Z Flip 4, I\u2019m a fan of foldable displays. However, based on my experience, it\u2019s important to clarify: Foldables aren\u2019t for everyone.\nDo any of these situations sound familiar to you?\n- Your phones inevitably end up with dents, major scratches, or even tiny screen fractures after a few years of use, even with a case.\n- You have young children to whom you often hand your phone for mobile games.\n- You need your phone around 24/7 for work (or addiction?) and spend a lot of time in dusty or sandy environments.\n- People tend to call you clumsy, and you\u2019re generally not great with fragile items.\nIt might seem obvious, but if you identify with the above, buying a foldable could be an expensive mistake. Personally, I fall somewhere in the middle, yet my Z Flip 3 only lasted about two years of daily use before the hinge jammed. I can\u2019t recall dropping it or anything significant, but I have kids, ADHD, and, well, things happen. If you\u2019re considering a foldable, be prepared to take extra care of it. Many lack waterproofing, and none are dustproof yet.\nFoldables need to be treated with care, so they're only suitable for a certain lifestyle.\nSo, how do you take care of a foldable phone? Simple. Leave it in the car when you go to the beach, or put it in a water- and sand-proof pouch. Ensure you don\u2019t drop it, as hitting the hinge wrong could turn your phone into an expensive paperweight, especially if it\u2019s out of warranty. Be cautious about who you hand your phone to, as not everyone will treat it with care. While a good case can help, most don\u2019t fit snugly and are more likely to slip off compared to traditional phones, at least in my experience.\nDurability is the biggest downside to foldables. They are also more expensive, and some users are bothered by the creases in foldable displays, though this is something one quickly adjusts to.\nThis might sound like I\u2019m discouraging you from getting a foldable. Quite the opposite, I love them but it\u2019s important to understand what you\u2019re getting into investing into a technology that\u2019s only been on the market for a little over five years. If you are certain you\u2019ll take care of a foldable and don\u2019t mind the other downsides mentioned, it can be worth it as long as you have clear expectations going in. Some of the biggest advantages of foldable phones include the ability to transform from a standard phone size to a tablet in the case of tablet hybrids, or they can even fold in half for easy pocketability if we\u2019re talking about foldable flip phones. Foldables also just look infinitely cooler than their more ordinary counterparts.\nWill Apple ever make a foldable and should I wait for it?\nFor now there an Android foldable phone is the only way to go but will there ever be an Apple foldable phone? While the idea of a foldable iPhone has definitely cropped up in more than one rumor over the years, the strongest claims suggest a foldable iPhone will happen first. Likely sometime in 2025 or even 2026. If you currently are an iPhone user you have no choice but to wait it out or jump ship to Android.\nFoldable or Flippable? That is the question\nOkay, technology a folding flip phone is still a foldable device but the point here is that you have two main form factors to pick from:\n- Tablet hybrid: These models are about hte size of a typical phone when folded but transform into a smaller tablet for improved productivity, bigger screen entertainment, and more.\n- Foldable flip phones: These models look more like old school flip phones on the outside, complete with small front displays for glanceable information. Once unfolded, the experience is identical to any other candy bar model.\nI can\u2019t tell you which one works best for you, as it\u2019s mostly a subjective thing. Just be aware flip phones have no major advantages over traditional phones outside of cool factor and pocketability, whereas hybrid tablets clearly have the advantage of screen real estate.\nFAQs\nMost manufacturers make their devices to handle at least 200,000 folds. That would be enough to fold and unfold a handset about 100 times daily for nearly 5.5 years. Of course, your mileage will vary, and you might get a defective handset, but phone makers swear by their technology.\nFoldable devices aren\u2019t cheap. Expect to pay $1,000 for most affordable modern foldables. And this is for flip versions. Fold-out devices will cost significantly more. These are mostly considered high-end handsets, though. At least you\u2019re getting a powerful device for all that cash. The only exception here is the Motorola Razr 2023, which costs only $700.\nNot necessarily! Many of these come with an external display that offers at least some level of functionality. Flip foldables like the Razr 5G have tiny screens in the front, which can be used to glance at notifications, change songs, and more quickly. Fold-out phones have an external display that is more similar to a traditional phone in size. Technically, you could use it without opening the phone at all.\nWhile there are a few options to choose from, we\u2019d recommend getting a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5, Galaxy Z Flip 5, or a Pixel Fold for most people.\nThe most affordable foldable phone we would still be willing to recommend is the Motorola Razr 2023. It is a good foldable and costs only $700.\nIt\u2019s too soon to tell, but at the moment, foldable are still niche devices. Despite being innovative, they still face many problems that prevent them from going mainstream.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."
