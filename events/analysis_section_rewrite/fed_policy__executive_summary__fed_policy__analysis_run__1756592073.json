Keep the causal drivers (short‑covering, Fed dovish tone, expected cuts, tariff‑induced risk premium, equity‑market risk sentiment) and the citations:  \n   *“The U.S. dollar index (DXY) is near 101.5, recently climbing 0.36 % to a one‑week high driven by short‑covering ahead of the July 2025 CPI release and the Fed’s dovish tone that has already priced in a modest lift in yields and a supportive dollar (XTQIQRP5K).  In the Aug 1‑Sep 30 2025 window, consensus projects a 0.2–0.5 % upside to ~102.0, powered by expected Fed cuts, tariff‑induced risk premium from Trump‑era semiconductor and India duties, and heightened equity‑market risk sentiment that would reinforce the dollar’s safe‑haven appeal (XTQIQRP5K)(XTQIQRP5K)(XTQIQRP5K)(FAN5RYW6T).”*\n\n2. **Condense the CPI‑trigger paragraph** into one sentence that links CPI thresholds to Fed action and DXY movement, preserving the 0.1–0.2 % dip vs. 0.2–0.4 % rise and the citations:  \n   *“A July CPI reading above 2.7 % on Aug 1 would likely trigger a Fed cut, lower yields, and a 0.1–0.2 % dip in the DXY, whereas a CPI below 2.5 % would see the Fed hold, higher yields, and a 0.2–0.4 % rise in the index (us_core_cpi)(fed_policy).”*\n\n3. **Merge the tariff‑rollback and tech‑rally sentences** into a single watch‑item line, keeping the 0.05–0.1 % erosion and the spx‑related safe‑haven effect, and cite appropriately:  \n   *“A tariff rollback announced on Aug 28 could erode the dollar’s edge by 0.05–0.1 % (tariff_policy), while a sustained tech rally would diminish the dollar’s safe‑haven appeal and a tech‑heavy sell‑off would reinforce it (spx).”*\n\n4. **Combine the catalysts and risk paragraphs** into one concise watch‑list sentence that lists the key catalysts (July CPI, Fed minutes, Treasury 10‑yr yields, DXY 20‑day MA, spx 20‑day MA, tariff announcements) and the primary risk (delayed Fed cut or sticky CPI > 3 % widening the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread and pushing the DXY higher), citing all relevant IDs:  \n   *“Key catalysts to watch over the next 3–6 months are the July CPI release, Fed minutes on Sep 16‑17, Treasury 10‑yr yield movements, the DXY 20‑day moving average, the spx 20‑day moving average, and tariff announcements on Aug 28 (us_core_cpi)(fed_policy)(tariff_policy)(spx).  The primary risk to the base case is a delayed Fed cut or a CPI that remains sticky above 3 %, which would keep rates elevated, widen the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread, and push the DXY higher (fed_policy)(us_core_cpi)(tariff_policy).”*\n\n5. **Replace the contradictory “200‑bp drop” line with a brief confidence statement** that keeps the ±0.1‑pp margin and cites the source:  \n   *“Overall confidence in the 0.2–0.5 % upside projection is moderate, with a ±0.1‑percentage‑point margin (KX6AOMQZ5).”*\n\n**Resulting brief (5 sentences, all claims cited, all magnitude ranges retained, watch items listed, no extraneous assets):**  \n> The U.S. dollar index (DXY) is near 101.5, recently climbing 0.36 % to a one‑week high driven by short‑covering ahead of the July 2025 CPI release and the Fed’s dovish tone that has already priced in a modest lift in yields and a supportive dollar (XTQIQRP5K).
