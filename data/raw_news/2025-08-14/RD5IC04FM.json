  "content": "Robert MacIntyre carded a brilliant 62 to hold a three-shot lead after day one of the BMW Championship at Caves Valley Golf Club.\n\nThe Scot was among the later starters that got to take advantage of softer conditions after a two-hour rain delay, with darkness preventing Bud Cauley from completing his opening round.\n\nMacIntyre, who is on the verge of joining Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood and Justin Rose in qualifying for Europe\u2019s Ryder Cup team, finished with six successive birdies and carded 10 in total against two bogeys.\n\nThe highlight of the left-hander\u2019s day came when he holed a 66-foot effort for birdie at the 13th to spark his spectacular finish.\n\n\u201cThe last six holes is probably as good as I\u2019ve ever putted in a stretch of holes \u2013 just so consistent,\u201d said MacIntyre.\n\n\u201cWhen you get the eye on, it\u2019s free flowing, and it\u2019s nice.\n\n\u201cI feel like the way I play golf is better suited for the tougher tests, where you\u2019re rewarded for hitting a fairway, you\u2019re rewarded for hitting a green, and then take your chances with the putter. Just happy with today\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nMacIntyre leads by three from England\u2019s Fleetwood, whose wait for a first PGA Tour title goes on after he was pipped by Rose at the St Jude Classic last week.\n\nScottie Scheffler\u2019s hot streak continued as he fired an opening 66 to lie third.\n\nThe world number one finished with three birdies in the final four holes to top the early leaderboard at the second FedEx Cup event.\n\nScheffler, who has registered 12 successive top-eight finishes in a scintillating year, said on Sky Sports: \u201cIt changed pretty significantly, a lot softer. The fairways were a little bit harder to hit this morning.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re still pretty wide, but they were still with the firmness, challenging to hit. And then with the softness coming in with the rain, the golf course got significantly easier.\u201d\n\nScheffler was playing with Masters champion Rory McIlroy, who carded a level-par 70.\n\nThe Northern Irishman, who skipped last week\u2019s FedEx Cup event knowing he is guaranteed to be in next week\u2019s Tour Championship, had a slow start, with three bogeys in the opening six holes, but battled back.",
