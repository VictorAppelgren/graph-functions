  "title": "Belgium to Recognize Palestinian State, Joining Pressure on Israel",
  "description": "The recognition was conditioned on the release of hostages by Hamas. It comes after similar moves by other countries as they try to push Israel to end the war in Gaza.",
  "content": "Belgium will recognize a Palestinian state at this month\u2019s United Nations General Assembly, the country\u2019s foreign minister announced early on Tuesday, joining a number of other states in a push intended to pressure Israel over its war on Gaza.\n\nPalestine will be \u201cclearly a state fully recognized on the international stage by Belgium,\u201d the foreign minister, Maxime Pr\u00e9vot, said on social media, though that recognition would take full effect only if key conditions were met.\n\nThe \u201cformalization\u201d of the move will take place \u201conce the last hostage has been released and Hamas no longer has any role in managing Palestine,\u201d Mr. Pr\u00e9vot said. It would come by royal decree, he added.\n\nEuropean leaders have been frustrated that Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s prime minister, has not ended the war, which has destroyed large parts of Gaza. More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed, including about 18,000 children and minors, according to Palestinian health officials, whose tallies do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The territory is gripped by a humanitarian crisis, with food-security experts saying that large parts of Gaza are suffering from famine. Israel rejects that designation.",
