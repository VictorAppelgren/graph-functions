  "description": "Midmark RTLS, a leading real-time locating system (RTLS) technology provider focused on clinical workflow solutions and data insights that improve the delivery of care, today announced that its staff safety solution, CareFlow RTLS Staff Duress, is Under Construction in the new Staff Duress category in Epic Toolbox.",
  "content": "The planned integration will enable immediate alerts within Epic during emergency situations to protect caregivers. VERSAILLES, Ohio, Aug. 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Midmark RTLS, a leading real-time locating system (RTLS) technology provider focused on clinical workflow solutions and data insights that improve the delivery of care, today announced that its staff safety solution, CareFlow RTLS Staff Duress, is Under Construction in the new Staff Duress category in Epic Toolbox. Midmark CareFlow Staff Duress is Under Construction in the new Staff Duress category in Epic Toolbox. This integration will enhance staff safety by enabling Midmark RTLS badges to send location-aware staff duress alerts into Epic using HL7 FHIR-based APIs. With a discreet press of the button on the Midmark RTLS badge, CareFlow RTLS will be able to deliver a location-based alert to Epic, identifying who needs help and where, so responders can act quickly. When staff are faced with threats in the workplace, patient care is jeopardized, and the healthcare system faces significant challenges in staff retention, patient satisfaction and operational success. Staff duress technology powered by RTLS is a proven strategy to address the heightened state of workplace violence in healthcare. \"Staff safety continues to be a vital use case for RTLS, with health systems experiencing a continual increase in violence,\" said Allen Foucht, BSN, RN, CLSSMBB, senior customer success coaching and education manager at Midmark RTLS. \"We've recently launched a key upgrade to our CareFlow Staff Duress product that allows for centralized management of staff duress incidents and easier configuration of alerts. Our upcoming integration with Epic will take this capability to another level\u2014enabling seamless push notifications within the same system already used by clinicians, further strengthening staff safety across healthcare environments.\" When staff feel threatened, a simple button press on their Midmark RTLS badge will provide Epic with the staff member's name and location. In turn, Epic will notify designated security response and informational groups through its push notification framework to support timely response and coordination. Additionally, responders will be able to acknowledge or decline alerts from within Epic.\n\u2022 Ease of use: Leverages the same RTLS badges often used to automate nurse call systems, without the need for additional devices.\n\u2022 Effective locating and alerting: Provides real-time information on who, when and where during duress events, enabling security teams to respond efficiently.\n\u2022 Empowering work environment: Gives staff confidence to signal for help when needed, delivering peace of mind that their safety is prioritized.\n\nCareFlow is easy to install, even in facilities without existing RTLS. The platform supports both Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and infrared (IR) technologies, offering flexible installation options. Facilities can use existing BLE-capable Wi-Fi access points or deploy Midmark RTLS BLE and/or IR sensory networks with minimal disruption. By combining the room-certain accuracy of IR with the cost-effective, near-room (3-5 meter) precision of BLE, CareFlow delivers reliable location tracking without requiring major infrastructure changes, making it an accessible solution for any healthcare setting. Midmark RTLS has a long-standing relationship with Epic, with the first CareFlow RTLS-Epic integration deployed in 2012, and the platform receiving Epic Toolbox designation for RTLS earlier this year. The planned Staff Duress integration builds on existing benefits, which include keeping the entire care team up to date with real-time location information in Epic, improving patient flow and staff productivity by automating bed assignments and transfers based on patient location data and accurately documenting patient experiences using location data to automatically timestamp patient events in the EMR. Learn more about these benefits here. For more information, find Midmark CareFlow RTLS in the Staff Duress Toolbox category in Epic Showroom, or if you are attending Epic UGM in Verona, Wisconsin, August 18\u201321, 2025, connect with us in person at our booth.

      "text": "Included with all CareFlow Patient Flow solutions, an inbound badge assignment interface to CareFlow from Epic simplifies patient registration by assigning Midmark RTLS badges directly in Epic, without duplicate data entry. Enter the Midmark RTLS Badge ID in the Epic tag field upon patient arrival, and Epic automatically sends applicable patient data to CareFlow.\nWith an outbound EMR interface to Epic (VER-8935-EPC), enable real-time location updates and timestamps in Epic modules such as Grand Central, OpTime, ASAP, MyChart Bedside and more.\nThe clinicians love [the CareFlow-Epic integration]. They love the rapid transfer response time. By the time the nurse logs on to her computer at the bedside, the patient is already loaded in her list and she can do her assessment. She doesn\u2019t have to wait for the secretary to bed the patient.\nSupport Analyst\nMemorial Hospital Miramar\nWhen it comes to adopting a real-time locating system (RTLS) to drive automation in the EMR, reliability and location accuracy are paramount. When integrating CareFlow with Epic, the benefits of accuracy, timeliness and granularity set Midmark RTLS apart from others in the market.\nWith more than three decades of experience developing, driving and delivering comprehensive solutions, Midmark RTLS understands the importance of quality location data for clinical workflow and how it maximizes efficiency in the EMR.\nThe first CareFlow-Epic integration was deployed in 2012, and Midmark CareFlow RTLS received the Epic Toolbox designation in 2025.\nEfficiency is essential for health systems, and the demand for precise RTLS data to enhance EMR information continues to grow. Midmark RTLS offers an optimal investment to provide timely communication, greater efficiency and expand full situational awareness.\nUnlike other RTLS technologies that require multiple, large, or expensive hardware components to achieve the necessary precision for EMR automation, Midmark RTLS delivers the same accuracy with just a small, single sensor in each patient care location. This results in a lower total cost of ownership. Beyond patient care areas, Midmark RTLS provides a cost-effective, full-facility RTLS solution using hybrid technologies.\nEstimation based on industry comparison\nCASE STUDY: LEVERAGING INTEGRATION TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY\nIn its 2024 RTLS report \u201cHow Organizations are Broadening Their Use Cases,\u201d KLAS featured a case study on CareFlow RTLS user Memorial Healthcare System. Memorial, who implemented the first CareFlow-Epic interface in 2012, indicated they are experiencing positive ROI with improved patient throughput, enhanced staff safety, streamlined asset management and increased cash collections.\nEpic, Grand Central, OpTime, ASAP and MyChart are trademarks or registered trademarks of Epic Systems Corporation.\nKLAS is a registered trademark of KLAS Research."
