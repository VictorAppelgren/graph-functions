  "title": "What's next after Florida announced plan to ban vaccine mandates?",
  "description": "Students have long been required to receive vaccinations for once-common childhood illnesses like polio and measles, but some states are moving to change that.",
  "content": "Florida officials announced that the state will work to phase out all childhood vaccine mandates, becoming the first in the U.S. to do so. Health experts say such a move raises the risk of deadly disease outbreaks.\n\nStudents have long been required to receive vaccinations for once-common childhood illnesses like polio and measles. A large majority of Americans believe the government should make vaccines more available and should encourage vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella, a CBS News poll found.\n\nIn the past few years, the United States has seen rising numbers of families getting vaccine exemptions for non-medical reasons, and vaccination rates have declined. Some states have made it easier to seek such exemptions. Florida's plan to roll back requirements would be the most sweeping change to vaccine regulations by far.\n\nWhy do schools have vaccine mandates?\n\nCommunities need to maintain high rates of vaccination to prevent outbreaks of disease and achieve what's called herd immunity, public health experts say. Herd immunity helps protect vulnerable members of the population who can't get vaccinated, like those who are too young or immunocompromised. For a disease like measles, the CDC says a herd immunity threshold of 95% is necessary to avoid outbreaks.\n\nSchool vaccine mandates are an \"important tool\" to maintain herd immunity, said Liz Williams, a senior policy manager with KFF's Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured.\n\n\"It's so important to get those vaccination levels up so it protects everyone,\" Dr. Philip Huang, director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department, told CBS News. \"When you make it a requirement, that's where you get the rates up to where we need to protect everyone.\"\n\nRoutine childhood vaccinations also keep \"children, families and their communities healthy and thriving,\" Dr. Susan J. Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in August.\n\nSchool vaccination rules vary by state. Most states require students receive vaccinations for polio, chicken pox, diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some states also require vaccination for meningitis and hepatitis B.\n\n\"When everyone in a school is vaccinated, it is harder for diseases to spread and easier for everyone to continue learning and having fun,\" Dr. Rana Alissa, chair of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in an email to The Associated Press on Wednesday. \"When children are sick and miss school, caregivers also miss work, which not only impacts those families but also the local economy.\"\n\n.vax-tabs .tablist{display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;gap:8px;margin:0 0 12px} .vax-tabs .tab{ background:#56a9ed;color:#fff;border:2px solid transparent;border-radius:6px; padding:10px 16px;cursor:pointer;font-size:16px;transition:.2s all;user-select:none } .vax-tabs .tab:hover{filter:brightness(.95)} .vax-tabs .tab.is-active{background:#2b7fc7;border-color:#1d5b90;font-weight:700;box-shadow:inset 0 -3px 0 rgba(0,0,0,.2)} /* Panels: stack in same slot; keep rendered; only active is interactable */ .vax-tabs .panels{display:grid} .vax-tabs .panel{ grid-area:1/1;opacity:0;visibility:hidden;pointer-events:none;transition:opacity .18s ease;z-index:0 } .vax-tabs .panel.is-active{opacity:1;visibility:visible;pointer-events:auto;z-index:1} /* Reserve height similar to DW embeds */ .vax-tabs .dw-embed{min-height:563px} @media (max-width:640px){.vax-tabs .tab{width:100%}} MMR DTP, DTaP, or DT Chickenpox (Varicella) Polio Hepatitis B\n\n(function(){ var root = document.getElementById('vax-tabs'); if (!root) return; var tabs = Array.prototype.slice.call(root.querySelectorAll('[role=\"tab\"]')); var panels = Array.prototype.slice.call(root.querySelectorAll('[role=\"tabpanel\"]')); function activate(panelId){ panels.forEach(function(p){ var active = (p.id === panelId); p.classList.toggle('is-active', active); p.setAttribute('aria-hidden', active ? 'false' : 'true'); }); tabs.forEach(function(t){ var selected = (t.getAttribute('aria-controls') === panelId); t.classList.toggle('is-active', selected); t.setAttribute('aria-selected', selected ? 'true' : 'false'); }); } tabs.forEach(function(tab){ tab.addEventListener('click', function(){ activate(tab.getAttribute('aria-controls')); }); tab.addEventListener('keydown', function(e){ if(e.key === 'ArrowRight' || e.key === 'ArrowLeft'){ e.preventDefault(); var i = tabs.indexOf(tab); var dir = e.key === 'ArrowRight' ? 1 : -1; var next = (i + dir + tabs.length) % tabs.length; tabs[next].focus(); activate(tabs[next].getAttribute('aria-controls')); } }); }); // Ensure a deterministic initial state even if CMS reorders DOM var initial = root.querySelector('.tab.is-active')?.getAttribute('aria-controls') || tabs[0].getAttribute('aria-controls'); activate(initial); })(); Will other states ban vaccine mandates?\n\nFlorida is the first state to announce plans to entirely roll back vaccine mandates, but it's not clear when the changes will take effect. Some of the vaccine requirements can be struck down by the health department, while others will require legislative approval. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said a state \"Make America Healthy Again\" commission will help create a \"medical freedom package\" to be introduced in the state Legislature next session.\n\nIdaho loosened many of its rules on immunizations in a new law that took effect over the summer. The \"Idaho Medical Freedom Act\" prohibits schools, companies and government entities from denying admission or services to a person who has not received a \"medical intervention,\" including vaccines. The law weakens school vaccine mandates, said Williams, but does not go as far as Florida's plan.\n\nIdaho is also one of three states \u2014 along with Montana and Iowa \u2014 that have debated legislation that would limit the use of mRNA vaccines, according to Axios. Louisiana officials have not commented on banning vaccine mandates, but said in February 2025 that they will stop promoting mass vaccination campaigns.\n\nParents, across political lines, are overwhelmingly supportive of schools requiring vaccines for measles and polio, according to a KFF-Washington Post poll.\n\nAt least 10 states have made changes to state-level vaccination requirement policies in the last year, said Williams. Most of those changes will result in more students claiming exemptions from vaccine policies, she said. Areas with higher rates of vaccine exemptions tend to have lower vaccination rates and be at an increased risk for outbreaks, Williams said.\n\nThere are two kinds of vaccine exemptions: medical and non-medical exemptions. Non-medical exemptions include those for personal reasons or religious beliefs. All states allow for medical exemptions. California, New York, Maine, Rhode Island and West Virginia do not allow for non-medical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nThe country has already seen a rise in vaccine exemptions in recent years, according to CDC data, and hit a record high last year. During the 2021-2022 school year, 2.2% of students had an exemption for at least one vaccine. Of those, 1.9% were for non-medical reasons. By the 2024-2025 school year, 3.6% students had an exemption for at least one vaccine with 2.4% of those exemptions for non-medical reasons.\n\nIdaho had the highest rate of exemptions during the 2024-2025 school year, at 15.4%, according to CDC data. Nearly all, or 15.1%, of those exemptions are for non-medical reasons. The state with the next highest rate of exemptions is Alaska, at 9.4%.\n\nThe rise in exemptions has led to falling vaccination rates overall. CDC data shows that about 92.1% of kindergarteners received the DTaP vaccine, while 92.5% received the MMR and polio vaccines. The numbers are all down slightly from the previous school year, the CDC said.\n\n\"We've seen children's vaccination rates for routine childhood vaccination decline since the pandemic, and we've also seen exemptions to school vaccination increase,\" Williams said. \"It's likely a lot of these state level policy changes are going to continue to contribute to these trends (of) more exemptions and lower vaccination rates.\"\n\nWhat happens if vaccine rates fall?\n\nIf vaccine rates fall below the numbers needed to maintain herd immunity, experts say the U.S. could see more outbreaks of preventable disease.\n\nEarlier this year, a measles outbreak erupted in a community in West Texas with low vaccination rates, leading to the U.S. recording the most cases of the potentially deadly illness in 30 years. Infections were confirmed in at least 39 states, with more than 1,400 cases nationwide. CDC data showed 92% of the people sickened had not received a measles vaccine or were of unknown vaccination status.\n\nLower vaccination rates have also enabled a number of cases of polio, which had officially been considered eliminated in the U.S. years ago.\n\n\"People forget the successes that we've seen with these vaccines. Before we had the polio vaccine, there were almost 60,000 cases in the U.S. each year, and almost 14,000 cases of paralytic polio,\" Huang, of the Dallas County health department, told CBS News. \"Parents waited fearfully every summer to see if it would strike.\"\n\nWorldwide, vaccines have saved 154 million lives, mostly infants, in the past 50 years, according to the World Health Organization. The CDC says that childhood vaccinations prevent about 4 million deaths worldwide each year.\n\nWhat's next for Trump's funding battle with Harvard?",

      "text": "How the fight against polio was won\nSorrow, fear, hospitals overwhelmed, closures \u2013 all due to the deadly coronavirus. And all hallmarks of another deadly and mysterious virus that terrified Americans, starting at the turn of the 20th century: Polio.\nDuring one huge outbreak in New York City in June 1916, panicked New Yorkers fled town, rushing to piers and railroad stations. As Walter Cronkite recounted in a 1958 CBS News broadcast, that was just the beginning. After World War II, polio became an ever-greater national threat: \"The three-year statistics run 50,000 polio cases, 103,000 cases, 122,000 cases,\" Cronkite said. \"Where will it end?\"\nJoanne Yager was a healthy 14-year-old in Denver when she got polio in the summer of 1951. Her symptoms include a high temperature, pain and headaches. \"I could not move. I couldn't stand up or get out of my bed,\" she said.\nYager spent three months in the hospital, before the disease started to retreat as mysteriously as it attacked. Like COVID-19, polio had different effects on different people. It left Yager with permanent weakness in her legs; she knew a lot of children who'd died. \"That was brought home real quickly, because on the same floor that the ward was on were the iron lungs,\" she said.\nIron lungs were primitive respirators breathing for patients. Like COVID-19, which strikes older adults more frequently, polio had a greater impact on a vulnerable age group.\n\"One of the things that tugged at the heartstrings of everyone is that polio, for some reason, targeted young kids,\" said Carl Kurlander. He spent ten years researching and co-producing a documentary about polio, titled \"The Shot Felt 'Round the World.\"\nHe told correspondent Rita Braver that one pivotal adult was left paralyzed from the waist down: Franklin D. Roosevelt, who would later become president.\nRoosevelt was 39 years old when he contracted the disease. He would help launch the organization that came to be called \"The March of Dimes,\" all in an effort to curb this dreaded disease.\n\"With polio there really was no effective treatment, so it was really a sense of helplessness,\" Kurlander said. \"Probably like we're feeling today with coronavirus.\"\nThe March of Dimes helped fund a groundbreaking effort, in which Dr. Jonas Salk, the director of the Virus Research Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, and his team spent six years working on a vaccine, conducting a huge nationwide trial on 1.8 million children.\n\"No one knew whether it was safe, whether it would be effective,\" Kurlander said. \"But people were so both afraid and believers that they volunteered their school kids to be guinea pigs for this new vaccine.\"\nBut in 1955, came success!\nDr. Paul Duprex, who holds the Jonas Salk Chair and heads the Center for Vaccine Research at the University of Pittsburgh, said that the march of history gives today's scientists an advantage, using tools that those searching for a polio vaccine did not have. \"We can manipulate, we can alter the genetics, the composition of these viruses, in ways that Dr. Salk could only have but dreamed,\" Duprex said.\nSalk, of course, had competition. Dr. Albert Sabin developed an oral vaccine a few years later. Now, Dr. Duprex, who is trying to adapt the measles vaccine to combat the coronavirus, is one of scores of researchers around the world all working toward the same goal.\n\"Competition is something which drives innovation,\" Duprex said. \"But there's another 'C.' We need to be collaborative. And that's not just colleagues in the United States, that's colleagues all over the world.\"\nThe FDA just approved the drug remdesivir as an emergency treatment for COVID-19. But the greatest hope is for a vaccine. Duprex and his team are already testing theirs on mice. And elsewhere, human trials have begun \u2013 several already showing great promise.\nBraver asked Duprex, \"Do you feel that the public is really behind scientists in the way they were behind those looking for the polio vaccine?\"\n\"I do,\" he replied. \"I think it's hard in an instantaneous world that we live; everything needs to be done yesterday. It's hard to be patient. But I think strong leadership, clarity from scientists, helps the public to understand that we are doing our best to defeat this virus.\"\nNeither Jonas Salk nor Albert Sabin and their teams personally profited from their discoveries, as Salk explained to CBS' Edward R. Murrow on April 12, 1955, when he was asked, \"Who owns the patent on this vaccine?\"\n\"Well, the people, I would say,\" Salk replied. \"There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?\"\nSixty-five years later, with polio all but eradicated, it remains to be seen if the creators of a coronavirus vaccine will feel the same way.\nWhen asked what lessons she thinks we can learn from studying the polio epidemic, 83-year-old Joanne Yager, who still lives with the effects of the disease (and who runs a support group for polio survivors in Tucson, Arizona, called Polio Epic Tucson), replied, \"That we can be survivors of some of these illnesses and we can come out as better people.\"\nHistorian Carl Kurlander: \"We've gotta have belief in the scientific community. Joni Mitchell and Neil Young had polio. Francis Ford Coppola, Itzhak Perlman, and ordinary people, once they came through this disease, they were able to really become the best they could be.\n\"And I think that we're at our best when we work as a country, and as a world, to defeat the unseen enemy.\"\nFor more info:\n- Center for Vaccine Research, University of Pittsburgh\n- \"The Shot Felt 'Round the World\" (Documentary produced by Carl Kurlander and Laura Davis, directed by Tjardus Greidanus)\n- carlkurlander.com\n- Polio Epic Tucson\nStory produced by Michelle Kessel.

      "text": "Vaccination rates among kindergarteners fall as exemptions rise to all-time high\nUnited States kindergarten vaccination rates decreased last year while exemptions rose to an all-time high, according to new federal data.\nThe data, posted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website Thursday, showed vaccination coverage among kindergartners during the 2024 to 2025 school year decreased for all reported vaccines from the year before.\nAccording to the data, about 92.1% kindergartners got the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP), and 92.5% received the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) and polio vaccine \u2014 all down slightly from the previous school year.\nThese decreases come as the U.S. has recorded the most measles cases in more than 30 years. A large share of the infections were connected to a West Texas outbreak primarily affecting children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status.\nExperts say outbreaks like these are more likely when vaccination rates drop \u2014 and rates have already fallen below the 95% needed for herd immunity.\nExemptions among U.S. kindergartners also rose to an all-time high during the 2024 to 2025 school year, the data showed, increasing to 3.6% from 3.3% the year before.\nExemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C., with 17 states reporting exemptions exceeding 5%, the CDC added.\nSpeaking on \"CBS Mornings\" earlier this year about the measles outbreak, Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, expressed worry over exemption increases across the country.\n\"We're really seeing a lot of exemptions [and] concerns about vaccination that are not warranted,\" she said, adding, for most people, the MMR vaccine will protect you for life against measles, one of the most contagious infectious diseases. Doctors and public health officials say the vaccine, which has been used for decades, is safe and highly effective."

      "text": "Map shows more than 1,400 measles cases across U.S. as outbreak grows\nIn 2025, the United States has recorded the most measles cases in more than 30 years, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. A large share of the infections were connected to an outbreak in West Texas that led to the deaths of two children.\nThe number of cases in Texas alone grew to over 760 before the state declared it officially over in August, while total cases nationwide have topped 1,400, with infections confirmed in at least 39 states.\nMeasles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and in some cases, can cause severe infections in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. But doctors and health officials say the vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is highly safe and effective.\nWhile most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.\nThe largest outbreak so far this year has been in West Texas, but cases have been reported in other states around the country, as well.\nThe CBS News data team is tracking confirmed measles cases nationwide as new data is released by state health departments and the CDC. (The map below is updated on Wednesdays when the CDC releases its latest weekly numbers.)\nThe Texas outbreak primarily affected children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. State and local health officials confirmed the first patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child, and the second was an unvaccinated 8-year-old girl. Neither of the children had underlying health conditions, the Texas health department said. New Mexico also reported the death of an adult with measles.\nThe last measles death in the U.S. before this year was in 2019, when a 37-year-old man died from measles complicated by meningitis in California, according to CDC data.\nUntil now, the highest number of confirmed cases in the U.S. in recent years was 1,274 in 2019, driven by outbreaks in New York, California and Washington state, but most years the total has been much lower.\nHealth experts point to lower vaccination rates as a reason for increases in preventable diseases like the measles.\nCDC data shows about 93% of kindergarteners in the U.S. were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year and only 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. This is down from 95.2% during the 2019-2020 school year \u2014 a critical threshold to keep people safe.\n\"When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated, most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity),\" the CDC states.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a history of making false and misleading claims about vaccines, voiced support for vaccination as the deadly outbreak spread in the Southwest.\n\"We encourage people to get the measles vaccine,\" Kennedy told CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook in an interview April 8, marking the first time Kennedy has publicly urged people to get the measles vaccine since becoming HHS secretary.\nAsked by LaPook what the federal government's official position on the vaccine is, Kennedy reiterated, \"The federal government's position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine,\" but added, \"The government should not be mandating those.\""

      "text": "Yesterday, Florida\u2019s Surgeon General announced that the state will end all vaccine mandates, including for school children, the first state in the nation to do so. Until now, all 50 states and D.C. had long-standing laws requiring children starting school to be vaccinated against diseases such as measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and polio at federally recommended ages. This move comes as measles cases hit their highest levels since the disease was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, and amid rising exemption rates for school-age children.\nAs Florida moves to end its mandates, early release findings from a new KFF-Washington Post survey show that parents overwhelmingly support current laws that require children to be vaccinated against diseases like measles and polio. The latest poll shows that eight in ten (81%) parents nationally support these requirements, with some medical or religious exceptions, and just one in five (18%) say public schools shouldn\u2019t require measles or polio vaccines for any students. This holds true across partisans: three quarters of Republican parents say public schools should require vaccines for measles and polio, including 73% of those who identify with the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d (MAGA) movement. Florida parents\u2019 views are similar to those nationwide, with 82% saying public schools should require these vaccines and 17% saying they should not.\nPartisan divisions over vaccine policy emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, and polls at the time showed the public was sharply divided on whether schools should require COVID-19 vaccines. Since then, public trust in government vaccine guidance has eroded and CDC data show routine vaccination rates among kindergarteners continue to decline. However, the public overwhelmingly continues to express confidence in the safety of measles vaccines, despite partisan divisions around COVID-19, and this new poll shows most parents still support measles vaccine requirements in public schools. Amid changes to national vaccine policy under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Florida becomes the first state to announce an end to vaccine mandates. At the same time, California, Oregon, and Washington have announced plans to make their own vaccine recommendations, citing concerns that federal guidance is being unduly influenced by political concerns. Other states in the Northeast are reportedly considering a similar alliance. The likely result may be a patchwork of vaccine guidance that is likely to lead to confusion among parents and may further undermine trust in some of these long-standing, life-saving vaccines."

For older children, shots are also advised but up to parents' discretion, the AAP said.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's advice is different. Under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the CDC doesn't recommend COVID-19 shots for healthy children of any age, but instead, the administration says kids may get the shots in consultation with physicians.\nIn a news release Tuesday, AAP President Dr. Susan J. Kressly, said the organization's immunization recommendations will continue to be \"rooted in science\" and in the \"best interest of the health of infants, children and adolescents.\"\n\"Pediatricians know how important routine childhood immunizations are in keeping children, families and their communities healthy and thriving,\" Kressly said.\nIn a statement to CBS News, HHS communications director Andrew Nixon said the American people \"deserve confidence that medical recommendations are based solely on science and public health.\"\n\"We call on the AAP to strengthen conflict-of-interest safeguards and keep its publications free from financial influence, ensuring every recommendation reflects only the best interests of America's children,\" the statement continued, in part, adding Kennedy has \"stood firm in his commitment to science, transparency, and restoring public trust.\"\nDr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, says there's \"a lot of noise out there\" when it comes to vaccines.\n\"Parents should really stick the course and make sure that their children get all of the routine childhood vaccinations,\" she said on \"CBS Mornings Plus,\" adding that more announcements are expected from other professional societies in the coming weeks.\nGounder added AAP's recommendations are really just reaffirming what they've previously advised.\n\"The first encounter with COVID should be with the shot, not with the virus,\" she said. \"There is still a very high risk in younger children, particularly 6 months to 2 years, for hospitalization and severe complications if they get COVID.\"\nThe AAP's recommendations also included guidance for RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, and flu vaccines.\nFor RSV, the APP recommends immunizations for infants younger than 8 months old who aren't protected via a vaccine from the pregnant parent, and for children 8 to 19 months old at high risk of severe infection.\nFor the flu, the AAP recommends annual vaccines for all children starting at 6 months old, unless they have a medical reason that would prevent them from getting the vaccine."

One person infected with measles can lead to a dozen other people becoming infected in any community where less than 95% of people have been vaccinated against measles.\nMeasles vaccine coverage ratesA declined during the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccination rates stalled in 2023 and began increasing in 2024, remaining lowest in low-income countries. Millions of children are unvaccinated or under-vaccinated, which has led to large measles outbreaks in nearly every region of the world.\nHealth impacts\nMeasles can cause serious illness and death.

      "text": "A major landmark study to be published by The Lancet reveals that global immunization efforts have saved an estimated 154 million lives \u2013 or the equivalent of 6 lives every minute of every year \u2013 over the past 50 years. The vast majority of lives saved \u2013 101 million \u2013 were those of infants.\nThe study, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), shows that immunization is the single greatest contribution of any health intervention to ensuring babies not only see their first birthdays but continue leading healthy lives into adulthood.\nOf the vaccines included in the study, the measles vaccination had the most significant impact on reducing infant mortality, accounting for 60% of the lives saved due to immunization. This vaccine will likely remain the top contributor to preventing deaths in the future.\nOver the past 50 years, vaccination against 14 diseases (diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae type B, hepatitis B, Japanese encephalitis, measles, meningitis A, pertussis, invasive pneumococcal disease, polio, rotavirus, rubella, tetanus, tuberculosis, and yellow fever) has directly contributed to reducing infant deaths by 40% globally, and by more than 50% in the African Region.\n\"Vaccines are among the most powerful inventions in history, making once-feared diseases preventable,\u201d said WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \u201cThanks to vaccines, smallpox has been eradicated, polio is on the brink, and with the more recent development of vaccines against diseases like malaria and cervical cancer, we are pushing back the frontiers of disease. With continued research, investment and collaboration, we can save millions more lives today and in the next 50 years.\u201d\nThe study found that for each life saved through immunization, an average of 66 years of full health were gained \u2013 with a total of 10.2 billion full health years gained over the five decades. As the result of vaccination against polio more than 20 million people are able to walk today who would otherwise have been paralysed, and the world is on the verge of eradicating polio, once and for all.\nThese gains in childhood survival highlight the importance of protecting immunization progress in every country of the world and accelerating efforts to reach the 67 million children who missed out on one or more vaccines during the pandemic years.\nMonumental efforts to increase access to vaccination over five decades\nReleased ahead of the 50th anniversary of the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) to take place in May 2024, the study is the most comprehensive analysis of the programme\u2019s global and regional health impact over the past five decades.\nFounded in 1974 by the World Health Assembly, EPI's original goal was to vaccinate all children against diphtheria, measles, pertussis, polio, tetanus, tuberculosis, as well as smallpox, the only human disease ever eradicated. Today, the programme, now referred to as the Essential Programme on Immunization, includes universal recommendations to vaccinate against 13 diseases, and context-specific recommendations for another 17 diseases, extending the reach of immunization beyond children, to adolescent and adults.\nThe study highlights that fewer than 5% of infants globally had access to routine immunization when EPI was launched. Today, 84% of infants are protected with 3 doses of the vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP) \u2013 the global marker for immunization coverage.\nNearly 94 million of the estimated 154 million lives saved since 1974, were a result of protection by measles vaccines. Yet, there were still 33 million children who missed a measles vaccine dose in 2022: nearly 22 million missed their first dose and an additional 11 million missed their second dose.\nCoverage of 95% or greater with 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine is needed to protect communities from outbreaks. Currently, the global coverage rate of the first dose of measles vaccine is 83% and the second dose is 74%, contributing to a very high number of outbreaks across the world.\nTo increase immunization coverage, UNICEF, as one of the largest buyers of vaccines in the world, procures more than 2 billion doses every year on behalf of countries and partners for reaching almost half of the world\u2019s children. It also works to distribute vaccines to the last mile, ensuring that even remote and underserved communities have access to immunization services.\n\u201cThanks to vaccinations, more children now survive and thrive past their fifth birthday than at any other point in history,\u201d said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. \u201cThis massive achievement is a credit to the collective efforts of governments, partners, scientists, healthcare workers, civil society, volunteers and parents themselves, all pulling in the same direction of keeping children safe from deadly diseases. We must build on the momentum and ensure that every child, everywhere, has access to life-saving immunizations.\u201d\nIn 2000, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which includes WHO, UNICEF and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) as core founding members, was created to expand the impact of EPI and help the poorest countries in the world increase coverage, benefit from new, life-saving vaccines and expand the breadth of protection against an increasing number of vaccine-preventable diseases. This intensified effort in the most vulnerable parts of the world has helped to save more lives and further promote vaccine equity. Today, Gavi has helped protect a whole generation of children and now provides vaccines against 20 infectious diseases, including the HPV vaccine and vaccines for outbreaks of measles, cholera, yellow fever, Ebola and meningitis.\n\u201cGavi was established to build on the partnership and progress made possible by EPI, intensifying focus on protecting the most vulnerable around the world,\u201d said Dr Sania Nishtar, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. \u201cIn a little over two decades we have seen incredible progress \u2013 protecting more than a billion children, helping halve childhood mortality in these countries, and providing billions in economic benefits. Vaccines are truly the best investment we can make in ensuring everyone, no matter where they are born, has an equal right to a healthy future: we must ensure these efforts are fully funded to protect the progress made and help countries address current challenges of their immunization programmes.\u201d\nImmunization programmes have become the bedrock of primary health services in communities and countries due to their far reach and wide coverage. They provide not only an opportunity for vaccination but also enable other life-saving care to be provided, including nutritional support, maternal tetanus prevention, illness screenings and bed net distribution to protect families from diseases like malaria.\nSince the study only covers the health impact of vaccination against 14 diseases, the number of lives saved due to vaccination is a conservative estimate and not a full account of the life-saving impact of vaccines. Societal, economic or educational impacts to health and well-being over the 50 years have also contributed to further reductions in mortality. Today, there are vaccines to protect against more than 30 life-threatening diseases.\nWhile the HPV vaccine, which protects against cervical cancer in adults, was not included in the study, it is expected to prevent a high number of future deaths as countries work towards increasing immunization targets aimed at eliminating cervical cancer by 2030. New vaccine introductions, such as those for malaria, COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and meningitis, as well as cholera and Ebola vaccines used during outbreaks, will further save lives in the next 50 years.\nSaving millions more is \u201cHumanly Possible\u201d\nGlobal immunization programmes have shown what is humanly possible when many stakeholders, including heads of state, regional and global health agencies, scientists, charities, aid agencies, businesses, and communities work together.\nToday, WHO, UNICEF, Gavi, and BMGF are unveiling \u201cHumanly Possible\u201d, a joint campaign, marking the annual World Immunization Week, 24-30 April 2024. The worldwide communication campaign calls on world leaders to advocate, support and fund vaccines and the immunization programmes that deliver these lifesaving products \u2013 reaffirming their commitment to public health, while celebrating one of humanity\u2019s greatest achievements. The next 50 years of EPI will require not only reaching the children missing out on vaccines, but protecting grandparents from influenza, mothers from tetanus, adolescents from HPV and everyone from TB, and many other infectious diseases.\n\u201cIt's inspiring to see what vaccines have made possible over the last fifty years, thanks to the tireless efforts of governments, global partners and health workers to make them more accessible to more people,\u201d said Dr Chris Elias, president of Global Development at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. \u201cWe cannot let this incredible progress falter. By continuing to invest in immunization, we can ensure that every child \u2013 and every person \u2013 has the chance to live a healthy and productive life.\u201d\n****\nNotes to editors\nFor more information on WHO World Immunization Week 2024 campaign, visit World Immunization Week 2024 (who.int) and Humanly Possible campaign, http://itshumanlypossible.org.\nAccess photos and broll on immunization here.\nAbout the data\nWHO led the analysis of the impact of the Expanded Programme on Immunization from 1974 to 2024 with input from researchers from University of Basel, Safinea Ltd., University of Washington, KidRisk Inc., Penn State University, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, University of Cape Town, Imperial College London, the Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium, and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.

      "text": "RFK Jr. has raised doubts about vaccines, but data shows how many lives they've saved\nIn his inaugural speech, President Trump vowed to \"keep our children healthy and disease free,\" but his new secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has a long history of raising doubts about vaccines \u2014 despite decades of evidence showing they've saved millions of people from debilitating illness or death.\n\"People forget what it used to be (before vaccines),\" CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook said on \"CBS Mornings Plus,\" pointing to data showing a huge decline in cases and deaths from these diseases compared with pre-vaccine levels.\n\"If you look at the 10 top childhood illnesses every year, vaccines prevent more than 1 million cases and more than 10,000 deaths\" in the U.S., he said. Worldwide, the numbers are even greater, with an estimated 2-3 million lives saved by childhood vaccinations each year.\nHere's what else to know about the impact of vaccines.\nHow do vaccines work?\nVaccines work by imitating organisms like viruses and bacteria without making you sick. \"That gives your immune system a chance to build up defenses so you're better prepared to fight a future infection,\" LaPook said.\nYour immune system creates specific defenses called antibodies against the imitation pathogen \u2014 known as an antigen \u2014 introduced by the vaccine. \"An antigen might be a germ that has been killed or changed so it cannot cause disease. It can be something that looks or behaves like a pathogen, a harmless part of a pathogen, or instructions for the body to manufacture the harmless part,\" according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.\nThen if you encounter the actual pathogen later in life, your immune system is prepared to respond quickly to fight it.\nSome vaccines effectively block illness, while others help prevent you from getting more severely sick if infected. So while it is true you can still get some illnesses after you've been vaccinated \u2014 like the flu or COVID, for example \u2014 the vaccines are still helpful in reducing the risk of severe illness or death.\nIf your body has a strong immune reaction to a vaccine, you might feel tired or experience body aches, headache, swollen lymph nodes or even a fever, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. These potential side effects are normal and typically last no more than a day or two.\nWhat do vaccines accomplish?\nVaccines have vastly reduced deaths in early childhood and largely eradicated certain diseases that used to cause dreaded epidemics.\nA recent study led by the World Health Organization estimates that vaccines, including immunizations against polio, measles and 12 other once-common diseases, have saved an estimated 154 million lives worldwide over the past 50 years. Measles vaccines alone have averted the deaths of about 94 million people, the analysis found.\nIn recent years, however, with backsliding immunization rates, health officials are starting to see the effects of skipping shots.\n\"We don't have to remember too far back to see what happens because of vaccination rates, when there aren't requirements and people don't have access,\" Dr. Carolyn Bridges, the CDC's former associate director for adult immunizations, recently told CBS News, citing a polio case that emerged in New York in 2022.\n\"That's just mind-boggling that we can have a polio resurgence, in a country with all of our resources. It doesn't take all that much for diseases still circulating in other places to retake hold.\"\nPolio cases and deaths before and after vaccines\nOutbreaks of polio once killed thousands of Americans and left many survivors paralyzed, until the disease was virtually eliminated in the U.S. by vaccines that first rolled out in the 1950s.\nFor decades now, the polio vaccine (inactivated polio vaccine or IPV) has been part of the routine childhood immunization schedule in the U.S., as it's the best way to protect against the virus. There is no cure.\nA total of four doses is recommended for the best level of protection. Research shows two doses of IPV provide about 90% protection while three doses provide at least 99% protection.\nMeasles cases and deaths before and after vaccines\nDespite being easily preventable with a readily available vaccine, measles cases have been on the rise in recent years, due largely to an uptick in people skipping vaccination. Measles is highly contagious, and lower vaccination rates give it an opening to spread.\nBefore the vaccine became available in the 1960s, measles was very common in childhood. About 48,000 Americans were hospitalized for it each year, and about 500, mostly children, would die.\nOne dose of the MMR vaccine, which covers measles, mumps and rubella, is 93% effective against measles and the recommended two doses is 97% effective, research shows.\nMost people who are vaccinated will be protected for life, major health organizations say.\nRubella cases and deaths before and after vaccines\nRubella, also known as German measles, is especially dangerous during pregnancy, when it can cause miscarriage, stillbirth or severe birth defects.\nDuring a major outbreak in the U.S. in the mid-1960s, before the vaccine, records show 11,000 pregnant women lost their babies, 2,100 newborns died, and about 20,000 babies were born with lifelong disabilities due to the virus.\nThe MMR vaccine, first introduced in 1971, is about 97% effective at preventing rubella after just one dose, research shows.\nThough rubella is no longer endemic \u2014 meaning constantly present \u2014 in the United States, it remains a problem in other parts of the world. This means it can be brought into the U.S. by people infected in other countries, making vaccination important to prevent illness and outbreaks."

      "text": "As vaccination rates decline, widespread outbreaks of diseases like measles and polio could reemerge\nHealth officials in western Texas are trying to contain a measles outbreak among mostly school-aged children, with at least 15 confirmed cases. It's the latest outbreak of a disease that had been virtually eliminated in the U.S., and it comes as vaccination rates are declining \u2014 jeopardizing the country's herd immunity from widespread outbreaks.\nTiffany Vargas, a mom who lives in the Tampa area, says her 8-year-old daughter has not received childhood vaccines. That includes vaccines for measles, chickenpox and polio.\n\"I started doing research, and I saw that a lot of doctors were just having a really hard time answering the questions that I had,\" Vargas told CBS News.\nDespite long-established safety studies, decades of research and publicly available information about the rare side effects, she questions whether there is enough transparency from the medical community.\n\"We're not anti-vaccine. We just want our questions answered,\" Vargas said.\nIn Florida, parents can opt out of vaccinating their children using a religious exemption, which is one reason Vargas moved her family out of New York.\n\"We were threatened to have CPS called on us, so I saw that was going to be an issue, that I wouldn't be able to exercise my right as a parent to choose what would be best for my child,\" Vargas said.\nThe vaccination rate for Florida kindergartners has fallen to 88.1%, according to the CDC, the lowest in decades. Nationwide, at least 10 states have also seen some vaccination rates fall.\nDr. Jeffrey Goldhagen, a pediatrician and professor at the University of Florida, said, \"90% is nowhere near good enough. That coverage rate will allow for the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases.\"\nHe said if vaccination rates continue to dip, the U.S. could see \"increased numbers of children infected. It means epidemics of measles. We are at great risk for re-emergence of polio in this country.\"\nLike Texas, some Florida schools \u2014 such as an elementary school in Broward County last year \u2014 have already seen measles outbreaks.\nWhile the vast majority of medical organizations say childhood vaccines are safe and effective, it's not enough for parents like Vargas, who told CBS News she is more concerned about possible side effects from the vaccines than her child getting measles or polio."

      "text": "CBS News Poll: Americans say vaccines should be made more available, but many say RFK Jr. making them less\nAmericans tend to believe Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s policies are making vaccines less available rather than more available. But the large majority of Americans feels government policy ought to make vaccines more available if people want them.\nA sizable third haven't heard or aren't sure.\nAlso, there's a wide view that government policy should encourage parents to vaccinate their children for diseases like measles, mumps and rubella, more specifically. Only a scant few think the government ought to discourage that.\nEven as vaccines \u2014 particularly COVID vaccines \u2014 have sometimes been a political issue, this view on encouraging children's vaccinations is true across party lines for the majority of Democrats, Republicans and independents. (That said, Republicans are less likely than Democrats to say outright encourage.)\nThere are differences by education levels: Those with college degrees are more likely to say it should encourage vaccination than those without degrees.\nMuch the same is true for COVID-19 vaccines, specifically: Most Democrats, Republicans, and independents say COVID vaccines should be available to people who want them. (Whether or not they would get one themselves.)\nThe difference in policy perception is connected to differences in approval of RFK Jr's job handling: Those who think he is making vaccines less available overwhelmingly disapprove of his job performance. Those who say he has not changed vaccine policy or made them more available are approving.\nIt's similar for those planning, or not planning, to get flu or COVID shots this winter. Those planning to get one are overwhelmingly disapproving; those not planning to get one are approving.\nAll that leads to something of a slightly net-negative job approval. It's also highly partisan, with most Republicans approving.\nFor information on whether a vaccine is safe or not, Democrats are much more trusting of the FDA and CDC than are Republicans (even as Republicans are more approving of the HHS Secretary.) Americans overwhelmingly will trust their own doctor or medical professionals.\nAmericans tend to think ultra-processed foods are either unsafe or that it depends on the product. But those views are not as connected to RFK's job approval.\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,344 U.S. adults interviewed between August 29 - September 2, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote. The margin of error is \u00b12.3 points."

      "text": "With polio's return, here's what back-to-schoolers need to know\nBefore polio vaccines became available in the 1950s, people wary of the disabling disease were afraid to allow their children outside, let alone go to school. As polio appears again decades after it was considered eliminated in the U.S., Americans unfamiliar with the dreaded disease need a primer on protecting themselves and their young children \u2014 many of whom are emerging from the trauma of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWhat is poliomyelitis?\nPolio is short for \"poliomyelitis,\" a neurological disease caused by a poliovirus infection. Of the three types of wild poliovirus \u2014 serotypes 1, 2, and 3 \u2014 serotype 1 is the most virulent and the most likely to cause paralysis.\nMost people infected with poliovirus don't get sick and won't have symptoms. About a quarter of those infected might experience mild symptoms like fatigue, fever, headache, neck stiffness, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. So, as with covid-19, people who don't have symptoms can unknowingly spread it as they interact with others. But in 1 in 200-2,000 people with a poliovirus infection, the virus may attack the spinal cord and brain. When it infects the spinal cord, people may develop muscle weakness or paralysis, including of the legs, arm, or chest wall. Poliovirus may also infect the brain, leading to difficulty breathing or swallowing.\nPeople can develop post-polio syndrome decades after infection. Symptoms may include muscle pain, weakness, and wasting.\nPeople with poliomyelitis may remain wheelchair-bound or unable to breathe without the help of a ventilator for the rest of their lives.\nHow does polio spread?\nThe virus that causes polio spreads through the \"oral-fecal route,\" which means it enters the body through the mouth by way of the hands, water, food, or other items contaminated with poliovirus-containing feces. Rarely, poliovirus may spread through saliva and upper respiratory droplets. The virus then infects the throat and gastrointestinal tract, spreads to the blood, and invades the nervous system.\nHow do doctors diagnose polio?\nPoliomyelitis is diagnosed through a combination of patient interviews, physical examinations, lab testing, and scans of the spinal cord or brain. Health care providers may send feces, throat swabs, spinal fluid, and other specimens for lab testing. But because polio has been vanishingly rare in the United States for decades, doctors may not consider the diagnosis for patients with symptoms. And tests for suspected polio must be sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since even academic centers no longer perform the tests.\nHow can poliovirus transmission be prevented?\nThe CDC recommends that all children be vaccinated against polio at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years, for a total of four doses. All 50 states and the District of Columbia require that children attending day care or public school be immunized against polio, but some states allow medical, religious, or personal exemptions. The Vaccines for Children program provides polio vaccine free of charge for children who are eligible for Medicaid, uninsured, or underinsured, or who are American Indian or Alaska Native. Most people born in the United States after 1955 likely have been vaccinated for polio. But in some areas the vaccination rates are dangerously low, such as New York's Rockland County, where it is 60%, and Yates County, where it is 54%, because so many families there claim religious exemptions.\nThere are two types of polio vaccine: killed, inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and weakened, live, oral polio vaccine (OPV). IPV is an injectable vaccine. OPV may be given by drops in the mouth or on a sugar cube, so it's easier to administer. Both vaccines are highly effective against paralytic poliomyelitis, but OPV appears to be more effective in preventing infection and transmission.\nBoth the wild poliovirus and the live, weakened OPV viruses can cause infection. Because IPV is a killed virus vaccine, it cannot infect or replicate, give rise to vaccine-derived poliovirus, or cause paralytic poliomyelitis disease. The weakened, OPV viruses can mutate and regain their ability to cause paralysis \u2014 what's called vaccine-derived poliomyelitis.\nSince 2000, only IPV has been given in the United States. Two doses of IPV are at least 90% effective and three doses of IPV are at least 99% effective in preventing paralytic poliomyelitis disease. The United States stopped using OPV due to a 1-in-2,000 risk of paralysis among unvaccinated persons receiving OPV. Some countries still use OPV.\nVaccination against polio began in 1955 in the United States. Cases of paralytic poliomyelitis disease plummeted from over 15,000 a year in the early 1950s to under 100 in the 1960s and then down to fewer than 10 in the 1970s.\nToday, poliovirus is most likely to spread where hygiene and sanitation are poor and vaccination rates are low.\nWhy is polio spreading again?\nThe World Health Organization declared North and South America polio-free as of 1994, but in June 2022, a young adult living in Rockland County, New York, was diagnosed with serotype 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus. The patient complained of fever, neck stiffness, and leg weakness. The patient had not traveled recently outside the country and was presumably infected in the United States. The CDC has since started to monitor wastewater for poliovirus. Poliovirus genetically linked to the Rockland County case has been detected in wastewater samples from Rockland, Orange, Sullivan and Nassau counties, demonstrating community spread as far back as May 2022. Unrelated vaccine-derived poliovirus has also been detected in New York City wastewater.\nHow do I know if I've been vaccinated against polio?\nThere is no national database of immunization records, but all 50 states and the District of Columbia have immunization information systems with records going as far back as the 1990s. Your state or territorial health department may also have records of your vaccinations. People immunized in Arizona, the District of Columbia, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Dakota, and Washington can access their immunization records using the MyIR Mobile app, and those who got vaccines in Idaho, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Utah can do so using the Docket app.\nYou may also ask your parents, your childhood pediatrician, your current doctor or pharmacist, or the K-12 schools, colleges, or universities you attended if they have records of your vaccinations. Some employers, like health care systems, may also keep records of your vaccinations in their occupational health office.\nThere is no test to determine if you're immune to polio.\nDo I need a polio vaccine booster if I was fully vaccinated against polio as a child?\nAll children and unvaccinated adults should complete the CDC-recommended four-dose series of polio vaccinations. You do not need an IPV booster if you received OPV.\nAdults who are immunocompromised, traveling to a country where poliovirus is circulating, or at increased risk for exposure to poliovirus on the job, such as some lab workers and health care workers, may get a one-time IPV booster.\nHow is polio treated?\nPeople with mild poliovirus infection don't require treatment. Symptoms usually go away on their own within a couple of days.\nThere is no cure for paralytic poliomyelitis. Treatment focuses on physical and occupational therapy to help patients adapt and regain function.\nWhy hasn't poliovirus been eradicated?\nSmallpox is the only human virus to have been declared eradicated to date. A disease may be eradicated if it infects only humans, if viral infection induces long-term immunity to reinfection, and if an effective vaccine or other preventive exists. The more infectious a virus, the more difficult it is to eradicate. Viruses that spread asymptomatically are also more difficult to eradicate.\nIn 1988, the World Health Assembly resolved to eradicate polio by 2000. Violent conflict, the spread of conspiracy theories, vaccine skepticism, inadequate funding and political will, and poor-quality vaccination efforts slowed progress toward eradication, but before the covid pandemic, the world had gotten very close to eradicating polio. During the pandemic, childhood immunizations, including polio vaccinations, dipped in the U.S. and around the world.\nTo eradicate polio, the world must eradicate all wild polioviruses and vaccine-derived polioviruses. Wild poliovirus serotypes 2 and 3 have been eradicated. Wild poliovirus serotype 1, the most virulent form, remains endemic only in Pakistan and Afghanistan, but vaccine-derived polioviruses continue to circulate in some countries in Africa and other parts of the world. A staged approach involving the use of OPV, then a combination of OPV and IPV, and then IPV alone would likely be needed to finally eradicate polio from the planet.\nKHN (Kaiser Health News) is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues. Together with Policy Analysis and Polling, KHN is one of the three major operating programs at KFF (Kaiser Family Foundation). KFF is an endowed nonprofit organization providing information on health issues to the nation."

      "text": "Florida moving to end all childhood vaccine mandates, DeSantis says, making it first state to do so\nGovernor Ron DeSantis and state Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo have announced that Florida will work to phase out all childhood vaccine mandates in the state, making it the first in the nation to do so. Vaccines protecting against once-common and sometimes deadly childhood diseases like polio and measles have long been required for children at schools across the U.S.\nDeSantis also announced on Wednesday the creation of a state-level \"Make America Healthy Again\" commission modeled after similar initiatives pushed at the federal level by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nThe vaccine announcement, which Ladapo said would allow people to make their own decisions, drew criticism from physician groups and other health leaders who stress that the vaccines are safe and the most effective way to stop the spread of communicable diseases, especially among schoolchildren.\n\"When everyone in a school is vaccinated, it is harder for diseases to spread and easier for everyone to continue learning and having fun,\" Dr. Rana Alissa, chair of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in an email. \"When children are sick and miss school, caregivers also miss work, which not only impacts those families but also the local economy.\"\nDr. Philip Huang, director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department in Texas, described the idea of dropping school vaccine requirements as \"insane and stupid.\"\n\"People forget the successes that we've seen with these vaccines. Before we had the polio vaccine, there were almost 60,000 cases in the U.S. each year, and almost 14,000 cases of paralytic polio,\" Huang told CBS News. \"Parents waited fearfully every summer to see if it would strike.\"\nHe noted it was similar for measles, which caused 48,000 hospitalizations and 450 to 500 deaths each year before the vaccine was introduced in the 1960s. Earlier this year, lower vaccination rates in some communities enabled the spread of the biggest measles outbreak in decades.\n\"it's so important to get those vaccination levels up so it protects everyone,\" Huang said.\nLadapo likened vaccine mandates to \"slavery\"\nLadapo, who has frequently clashed with the medical establishment, cast current vaccine requirements in schools and elsewhere as an \"immoral\" intrusion on people's rights bordering on \"slavery,\" and said they hamper parents' ability to make health decisions for their children.\n\"People have a right to make their own decisions, informed decisions,\" Ladapo said at a news conference in Valrico, Florida, in the Tampa area. \"They don't have the right to tell you what to put in your body. Take it away from them.\"\nThe state Health Department, Ladapo said, can scrap its own rules for some vaccine mandates, but others would require action by the Florida Legislature. He did not specify any particular vaccines but repeated several times the effort would end \"all of them. Every last one of them.\"\nFlorida would be the first state to eliminate so many vaccine mandates, Ladapo added.\nLadapo said his department will work with lawmakers to make it happen. But the idea received immediate pushback from some officials.\nDemocratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani, who is running for Orlando mayor, said in a social media post that scrapping vaccines \"is reckless and dangerous\" and could cause outbreaks of preventable disease.\n\"This is a public health disaster in the making for the Sunshine State,\" she said on the social platform X.\nA prominent expert in the field, Dr. Michael Osterholm of the Vaccine Integrity Project, said the Florida proposal \"flies in the face of a mountain of evidence that clearly shows the benefits of vaccinating kids before they enter school, and it will make the state less safe to visit or live in. Every parent of a child who dies or who is hospitalized with a vaccine-preventable disease will know exactly why.\"\nFlorida has required vaccines for kids attending school for decades\nIn Florida, vaccine mandates for child day care facilities and public schools include shots for measles, chickenpox, hepatitis B, Diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP), polio and other diseases, according to the state Health Department's website.\nUnder DeSantis, Florida resisted imposing COVID vaccines on schoolchildren, requiring \"passports\" for places that draw crowds, school closures and mandates that workers get the shots to keep their jobs.\n\"I don't think there's another state that's done as much as Florida. We want to stay ahead of the curve,\" the governor said.\nThe state \"MAHA\" commission would look into such things as allowing informed consent in medical matters, promoting safe and nutritious food, boosting parental rights regarding medical decisions about their children, and eliminating \"medical orthodoxy that is not supported by the data,\" DeSantis said. The commission will be chaired by Lt. Gov. Jay Collins and Florida first lady Casey DeSantis.\n\"We're getting government out of the way, getting government out of your lives,\" Collins said.\nThe commission's work will help inform a large \"medical freedom package\" to be introduced in the Legislature next session, which would address the vaccine mandates required by state law and make permanent the recent state COVID decisions relaxing restrictions, DeSantis said.\n\"There will be a broad package,\" the governor said.\nOther states coordinating on vaccine planning\nMeanwhile, the Democratic governors of Washington, Oregon and California announced Wednesday that they've created an alliance to coordinate on health and vaccination guidelines, to counter what they call the Trump administration's politicizing of public health decisions.\nThe partnership plans to align immunization plans based on recommendations from respected national medical organizations, according to a joint statement from Gov. Bob Ferguson of Washington, Gov. Tina Kotek of Oregon and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California."
