  "content": "DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) \u2014 Many of Syria's Alawite religious minority are leaving a Damascus suburb where thousands of their members live in ramshackle houses, days after it was raided by a Syrian pro-government armed faction who beat and arrested many and ordered them to evacuate their homes.\n\nThe Muslim minority group was seen as privileged under the rule of the Alawite Assad family, but since Bashar Assad's government fell late last year, members have feared revenge from the country\u2019s Sunni majority.\n\nThough government officials later said there was no such eviction order, many residents of Sumariya packed their belongings into trucks and left their homes, fearing further attacks.\n\nThe incident illustrated how delicate the situation in Syria is nearly nine months after Assad was ousted in a rebel offensive, ending 50 years of his family's rule.\n\nUnited Nations spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric on Friday said U.N. officials were \u201cfollowing with concern the developments ... including reports of threats of evictions and the reports of abuses against innocent civilians, including women and children.\u201d\n\nAssad was a member of the Alawite minority, and during his time, Alawites were disproportionately represented in the security and intelligence forces. The Sumariya area, northwest of Damascus, once contained military housing, including for members of the 4th Armored Division, which Syrian opposition activists accused of carrying out extrajudicial killings, torture, extortion and drug trafficking.\n\nMost of the 4th division members fled the area when Assad fell. But civilian families also lived there, many in small, shoddily constructed single-story houses.\n\nMohammad Ibrahim, a retired government worker, told The Associated Press on Saturday he had bought his small house in 2010, and later got a court decision making the ownership official.\n\n\u201cThe walls, if you hit them, they will break, and the doors are the same. It\u2019s housing for the most basic level of living,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Syria Report, a publication tracking the country\u2019s economy, said Sumariya emerged in the 1980s on land expropriated from the town of Moadamiyat al-Sham. It noted that \u201cmany current occupants lack official documents proving their ownership or rental agreements, making them vulnerable to sudden eviction.\u201d\n\nBut even those with documentation said they were threatened and ordered to evacuate.\n\nRagda Jerawa, a mother of two and government employee living in one of the small houses in Sumariya, said that residents had been told that an inspection committee would come Thursday to check ownership papers.\n\n\u201cWe had our papers ready, so we thought that\u2019s it, no one would bother us,\u201d she said. \u201cThe next day I went to work, and my husband called me saying they came in, beat him up and beat up my son, and they didn\u2019t even ask for papers.\u201d\n\nJerawa said the armed men told residents that they must leave within 48 hours, \u201cotherwise we\u2019ll demolish the houses over your heads.\u201d Some men were rounded up, detained, beaten and coerced into signing documents giving up their houses, she said.\n\nKaram Khuzam, head of the neighborhood committee, said it had been notified by security officials that inspectors would come to issue eviction orders for some illegally constructed homes whose residents did not have ownership papers for them.\n\nThere had been a court order issued in 2004 legalizing the ownership of land in Sumariya, he said, but after Assad\u2019s fall, some of the original land owners in Moadamiyat al-Sham said the people who had bought houses in Sumariya no longer had legal standing. However, instead of a legal process to determine ownership, armed men descended on the neighborhood and ordered residents to get out immediately.\n\n\u201cThere were some violations \u2014 beating and insulting people, random arrests\u2026 some of the guys hit women,\u201d Khuzam said.\n\nHe said members of the neighborhood committee later spoke with government officials and were told to stay in their houses unless they received an official eviction order from the governor.\n\nEven after being told that there was no official eviction order, residents said members of a local armed faction, led by a man known as Abu Huzaifa, continued to threaten them. Numerous families were too frightened to stay and take their chances.\n\nMany remembered the violence that erupted on Syria\u2019s coast months before, when clashes between security forces and pro-Assad armed groups spiraled into sectarian revenge attacks in which hundreds of Alawite civilians were killed.\n\nJerawa\u2019s family was packing its modest belongings into a truck on Saturday, preparing to take them to the coastal area of Latakia, although Jerawa feared leaving Damascus would mean losing her job.\n\n\u201cTo whom do we complain? Where is the state? We got rid of the old regime, and now what?\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore ... Let them kill us, we\u2019ll be relieved.\u201d\n\nSewell reported from Beirut. Associated Press journalist Omar Sanadiki in Damascus contributed to this report.",
