      "text": "Minaurum\u2019s exploration strategy is to develop and acquire a pipeline of potential Tier One precious and base metals projects in Mexico and USA. The Minaurum team has a proven technical and financing track record and has been credited with the discovery of over 300 million ounces of silver and 63 million ounces of gold in the Americas. The company is listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under \u2018MGG\u2019 | OTCQX Best Market under \u2018MMRGF\u2019 | Frankfurt Stock Exchange under \u201878M\u2019.\nMinaurum's primary focus is advancing its flagship Alamos Silver Project in Sonora, Mexico with a maiden NI 43-101 mineral resource targeted for 2025. Alamos is located adjacent to the Aurifero gold project, and further south the joint ventured Adelita copper-silver project in Sonora. The Santa Marta VMS gold-copper project, Aurena gold project and Taviche silver-gold project are located in the Oaxaca. The Biricu gold project is surrounded by major gold producing mining companies in the heart of the Guerrero Gold Belt. Recently acquired 100% of the Lone Mountain Zinc Project (Nevada, USA) with a historical mineral resource of 3,257,000 tonnes grading 7.57% zinc and 0.70% lead, and PEA demonstrating a 35% after tax IRR.\nMexico has a long history of base and precious metals exploration and mining, resulting in Mexico becoming one of the largest precious metals producers globally and a hub for several Canadian mining companies. Mexico is a \u201cgo-to\u201d destination for international mining companies. Investors looking for precious metals exposure, gold stocks to buy, including a silver stock and some of the best copper stocks. Mexico has a large base of mining employment in exploration or producer gold mining stocks and/or silver stocks. Boasting a strong indigenous mining industry, Mexico is known as a stable mining jurisdiction with a fair tax regime and solid mineral tenures."

The Minaurum team has a proven technical and financing track record and has been credited with the discovery of over 300 million ounces of silver and 63 million ounces of gold in the Americas.

Alamos is located adjacent to the Aurifero gold project, and further south the joint ventured Adelita copper-silver project in Sonora. The Santa Marta VMS gold-copper project, Aurena gold project and Taviche silver-gold project are located in the Oaxaca. The Biricu gold project is surrounded by major gold producing mining companies in the heart of the Guerrero Gold Belt. Recently acquired 100% of the Lone Mountain Zinc Project (Nevada, USA) with a historical mineral resource of 3,257,000 tonnes grading 7.57% zinc and 0.70% lead, and PEA demonstrating a 35% after tax IRR.\nMexico has a long history of base and precious metals exploration and mining, resulting in Mexico becoming one of the largest precious metals producers globally and a hub for several Canadian mining companies. Mexico is a \u201cgo-to\u201d destination for international mining companies. Investors looking for precious metals exposure, gold stocks to buy, including a silver stock and some of the best copper stocks. Mexico has a large base of mining employment in exploration or producer gold mining stocks and/or silver stocks. Boasting a strong indigenous mining industry, Mexico is known as a stable mining jurisdiction with a fair tax regime and solid mineral tenures."
