  "title": "Senior Advocacy Group Pushes $1,400 'Catch-Up' Payment For Social Security Beneficiaries Amid Inflation",
  "description": "",
  "content": "Inflation has been tough on many Americans, especially seniors relying on Social Security. The Senior Citizens League \u2014 a nonpartisan group focused on senior issues \u2014 is now pushing for a \"one-time catch-up payment\" of $1,400 to help Social Security beneficiaries keep up with rising costs.\n\nTheir proposal would come in addition to the regular cost-of-living adjustment that Social Security provides each year.\n\nWhy Do Seniors Need More Than The Usual Cola?\n\nCOLA is meant to protect Social Security checks from losing value as prices rise. But many seniors feel the current calculations don't fully reflect the expenses they face.\n\u2022 The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market \u2014 and you can too at just $2.90/share.\n\u2022 \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share.\n\nA TSCL survey shows that nearly 80% of seniors think inflation last year was higher than official government numbers. Their expenses for essentials like housing, medicine, and groceries tend to rise faster than what the government's consumer price index measures.\n\nIn fact, many seniors spend more than $1,000 a month just on healthcare, according to the survey. And with medical bills and other living costs climbing, the usual COLA increases haven't been enough to cover what seniors actually pay.\n\nWhat Exactly Is The Proposed \u2018Catch-up Payment'?\n\nTSCL suggests a one-time payment of $1,400 for Social Security recipients to help make up for the shortfall in past COLA increases. This idea isn't new \u2014 similar payments were made during tough economic times, like the $250 Economic Recovery Payments in 2009 and the stimulus checks during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTrending: Bezos' Favorite Real Estate Platform Launches A Way To Ride The Ongoing Private Credit Boom\n\nTSCL Executive Director Shannon Benton told Nextstar that this extra payment would give seniors on fixed incomes some much-needed breathing room, especially those who live on very tight budgets. In fact, TSCL estimates that about 7.3 million seniors survive on less than $1,000 a month, which is below the federal poverty level.\n\nWhat About The Upcoming Cola?\n\nTSCL projects the 2026 COLA to be about 2.6%, a slight increase from this year's 2.5%. While any increase helps, many seniors feel it's still not enough given how fast prices for essentials have been rising.\n\nThe group also supports changing how the COLA is calculated. Currently, it's based on the CPI for urban wage earners, but TSCL advocates using the CPI for the elderly, which better reflects the spending patterns of older Americans.\n\nSee Also: In a $34 Trillion Debt Era, The Right AI Could Be Your Financial Advantage \u2014 Get Your Demo\n\nNearly all seniors surveyed by TSCL want Social Security and Medicare reform to be a priority for Congress and the president. Many depend on Social Security for their entire income, and cutting benefits isn't an option for millions.\n\n\"If four in five seniors think inflation was higher than the government reported, maybe it's time to listen to their experiences and rethink how COLA is measured,\" Benton says.\n\nRead Next: Named a TIME Best Invention and Backed by 5,000+ Users, Kara's Air-to-Water Pod Cuts Plastic and Costs \u2014 And You Can Invest At Just $6.37/Share",

      "text": "The Trump administration has cautioned that a reversal of President Donald Trump\u2018s tariffs could pose a threat to federal benefits such as Social Security and Medicare.\nUS Warns Court Tariff Reversal Could Trigger Trillions In Refunds\nSolicitor General D. John Sauer and Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate voiced this concern to a federal appellate court on Monday, according to a report by Axios on Tuesday. They suggested that if the U.S. were forced to refund trillions of dollars from deals not yet fully finalized, the nation could face severe economic repercussions.\nTariff deals with Japan, South Korea, and the EU include pledges for over $1 trillion in U.S. project investments.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is expected to soon rule on whether to affirm or overturn the Court of International Trade's late-May decision that struck down most of Trump's tariffs. Sauer and Shumate's letter introduces fresh arguments in favor of keeping the tariffs in place.\nThe letter states, \u201cIf the United States were forced to pay back the trillions of dollars committed to us, America could go from strength to failure the moment such an incorrect decision took effect.\u201d They also warned of potential job losses, forced evictions, and threats to Social Security and Medicare.\n\u201c\u2026.millions of jobs would be eliminated, hard-working Americans would lose their savings, and even Social Security and Medicare could be threatened.\u201d\nThe letter from Sauer and Shumate suggests that while the Trump administration intends to introduce a new tariff program if the current one is struck down by the courts, the alternatives would be less effective \u2014 a point the administration has not acknowledged before.\nSEE ALSO: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Dogecoin Start The Week Green Ahead Of US-China Trade Talks \u2013 Benzinga\nTrump Warns Tariff Overturn Could Trigger Depression\nThis warning comes after President Trump hinted at a potential economic fallout if his extensive tariff policy is overturned, suggesting a new Great Depression could be on the horizon. Trump\u2019s concerns about a negative verdict on the tariff policy by a \u201cRadical Left Court\u201d and the difficulty the U.S. would face in recovering from such an economic setback.\nMoreover, investment bank Piper Sandler has previously declared President Trump\u2019s trade deals illegal, predicting a Supreme Court ruling against Trump by June 2026, reported Fortune. The bank\u2019s analysis of ongoing court battles and legislative authority concluded that Trump\u2019s reliance on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose wide-ranging tariffs and cut bilateral deals far exceeds the powers granted by Congress.\nRead Next:\nImage via Shutterstock\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nThree of the same VC firms that backed Uber, Venmo, and eBay, respectively, are all investing in another private company: Pacaso.\nVenture backing in companies like Pacaso is nothing new. After all, early-stage companies often have the potential to deliver the most outsized returns.\nBut, recent regulatory updates have opened the door for individual investors to invest alongside these venture capitalists. Normally, everyday investors have to wait for a company to go public before they can invest, missing out on that early gain potential. Now, some companies are opening up investment opportunities to the public.\nThis type of investing has already seen some great success stories. For example, in 2016, 433 people invested an average of $2,730 in a private startup named Revolut. Fast-forward to today, those $2,730 stakes are worth over $1 million, up 89,900%.\nToday, thousands of investors have joined big-name VCs in taking a chance on Pacaso. It's no surprise, considering Pacaso's resum\u00e9:\n- The company has made $110M in gross profits to date\n- Pacaso's co-founder sold his last company to Zillow for $120M\n- They operate in over 40 vacation destinations across the US, Mexico, UK, and France\n- The company reserved the Nasdaq ticker PCSO\nBut the growth potential is where the excitement is. Below we'll reveal more about how Pacaso has ramped up and built a competitive moat so quickly, and how you can share in their growth.\nNext-Generation Co-Ownership\nAfter his $120M exit and subsequent role as a Zillow executive, Austin Allison created Pacaso\u2019s game-changing co-ownership model. Powered by proprietary tech and an innovative structure that eliminates the headaches of traditional vacation home ownership, it\u2019s already leaving a mark. Here\u2019s how:\n- Seamless Transactions: Clients easily buy, finance, and resell, shares of luxury homes through Pacaso\u2019s intuitive platform\n- Turnkey Ownership: Pacaso handles maintenance, scheduling, and furnishing; owners simply enjoy their vacation homes\n- Maximized Value: Homes that once sat empty up to 90% of the year now stay occupied nearly year-round, benefiting owners and local economies\nThe demand for their services and expertise is real. In top destinations, co-ownership is growing 21% annually in the US, and Pacaso homes have appreciated nearly 10% since 2021 \u2013 roughly double the growth of the broader luxury market.\nScaling Into 10 New International Destinations\nPacaso is already leading the charge in the $1.3 trillion US vacation home market, combining real estate innovation with tech-driven efficiency to generate multiple revenue streams. These include transaction service fees on every sale, recurring property management fees, and exclusive financing options tailored to co-owners.\nNow, the platform\u2019s global reach is growing quickly, and they\u2019re already seeing strong returns in the $500B global market. In 2024, they set records in Paris and London. Meanwhile, Cabo (Mexico) is the #3-most-searched destination on their platform. No surprise Europe and Mexico have accounted for 22% of their revenue over the past two years.\nNow, they\u2019re taking international expansion to an entirely new level. They recently announced 10 new international destinations will be added to their platform, spread across Italy, the Caribbean, and Mexico. That means Pacaso\u2019s unique model is poised to dominate a combined $1.8T in vacation home markets.\nWhy Investors Are Paying Attention\nThere are many reasons why firms managing a combined $180B+ in assets, and 10,000+ individual investors have already backed Pacaso, including:\n- Proven Leadership: Allison is joined by executives with decades of real-estate and startup experience.\n- Strong Growth Metrics: Full-year 2024 financials showed a 21% YoY increase in gross real estate volume and a 24% improvement in adjusted EBITDA.\n- Surging Demand: 40% of Americans want to buy a vacation home in the next year (Coldwell Banker)\nAfter impressive full-year earnings showed gross profit grew 41%, and with continued growth and expansion ahead, Pacaso is really hitting their stride.\nPacaso is offering securities through the use of an Offering Statement that has been qualified by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Tier II of Regulation A. A copy of the Final Offering Circular that forms a part of the Offering Statement may be obtained from: invest.pacaso.com.

      "text": "For Immediate Release \u2013 June 16, 2025\nNew TSCL Study Estimates 21.8 Million Seniors Get by On Social Security Alone\nMost Seniors are frustrated with their Social Security benefits. Almost two-thirds of seniors who completed the survey said they were dissatisfied with the amount they receive from their monthly Social Security checks. Meanwhile, 94 percent said they felt the 2025 COLA of 2.5 percent was too low and that their benefits grow more slowly than inflation.\nBenefit reform is a top priority for seniors. Nearly all respondents (95 percent) said reforming Social Security and Medicare should be a top priority for the Presidential Administration and Congress.\nKey Insights:\nMost seniors think 2024\u2019s inflation was much higher than the government\u2019s estimate. The 2025 COLA, which is supposed to adjust Social Security checks to keep pace with inflation that occurred in 2024, was 2.5 percent. When TSCL asked seniors how much they thought inflation was in 2024 based on their economic experiences, 80 percent thought inflation was 3 percent or higher.\nNearly all seniors want to see reforms in Social Security\u2019s COLA calculation. When TSCL asked seniors whether they would support any of three different policies to raise future COLAs, 96 percent said they were in favor of at least one. The most popular option, supported by 68 percent of seniors, was calculating the COLA with an inflation index that better represents seniors\u2019 economic experiences. The government currently calculates the COLA with the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners, but TSCL advocates switching to the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly.\nTSCL Executive Director Shannon Benton says\u2026\n\u201cThe data in this study shows what seniors have been telling TSCL for years: Social Security checks aren\u2019t keeping up with inflation. If four in five seniors think inflation was higher than the government reported in 2024, maybe we should stop questioning their experiences and start questioning why the COLA is failing to measure them.\u201d\n\u201cSeniors also want to fund stronger COLAs and benefits for future generations by cutting loopholes in the Social Security payroll tax. The data show their favorite method for doing so is eliminating the limit on earnings subject to Social Security payroll taxes, which is currently just a loophole that lets wealthy Americans pay less than their fair share into the program.\u201d\n\u201cCutting Social Security benefits simply isn\u2019t an option. With nearly three-quarters of seniors depending on Social Security for at least half their income, any cuts to the program or reductions in benefits would push millions of hard-working Americans further into poverty, robbing them of their right to retire with dignity.\nAbout TSCL:\nThe Senior Citizen\u2019s League (TSCL) is one of the nation\u2019s largest nonpartisan seniors\u2019 groups. Established in 1992 as a special project of The Retired Enlisted Association, our mission is to promote and assist our members and supporters, educate and alert senior citizens about their rights and freedoms as U.S. citizens, and protect and defend the benefits seniors have earned and paid for. TSCL consists of vocally active senior citizens concerned about the protection of their Social Security, Medicare, and veteran or military retiree benefits. To learn more, visit https://seniorsleague.org/about-us/.\nAbout the 2025 Senior Survey:\nTSCL surveyed American seniors over the age of 62 who were eligible for their Social Security benefits. Overall, 3,050 participants took the survey, with 1,920 providing complete enough data to use in the study. TSCL distributed the survey from January to March 2025, then analyzed the results from April to May 2025. The full findings of the study are available for free here.\nContact Information:\nShannon Benton, Executive Director: sbenton@tsclhq.org; 703-548-5568\nAlex Moore, Statistician: amoore@tsclhq.org; 571-374-2658\nAccess Senior Survey Report Here"

      "text": "Deciding when to claim Social Security can be a tricky choice \u2014 even more so when your partner disagrees with your plan.\nOne woman recently turned to Reddit's r/SocialSecurity forum to vent about her 67-year-old partner, who is earning $175,000 annually but wants to start collecting his Social Security benefits now \u2014 even though waiting three more years would increase his monthly check by more than $1,000.\nWhy He Wants the Money Now\nHer partner spent much of his career running a business, often paying himself little or nothing in salary. After selling the business, he began working in accounting and now earns a high salary working directly for a private client.\nDon't Miss:\n- Accredited Investors: Grab Pre-IPO Shares of the AI Company Powering Hasbro, Sephora & MGM\u2014Just $0.63 Before NASDAQ Launch\n- $100k+ in investable assets? Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes \u2013 no cost, no obligation.\nDespite not needing the money, he wants to claim Social Security at 67 \u2014 a decision his partner says doesn't make sense. \u201cHe would barely be making $2,000 a month,\" she wrote. \u201cWith his current income that would jump by over 1000 when he hits 70.\u201d\nBut for him, it's not about financial need. He simply wants the money \u201cin the bank now.\u201d\nWhat Waiting Until 70 Would Do\nUnder current Social Security rules, delaying benefits past full retirement age \u2014 which is 66 or 67 depending on your birth year \u2014 increases your monthly check by 8% per year, up until age 70.\nFor someone like this Reddit user's partner, waiting could mean an extra $12,000 a year for life. But the trade-off is missing out on three years' worth of lower payments \u2014 about $72,000 total \u2014 before that extra income starts.\nTrending: \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share.\nCommenters Weigh In: Is It Worth the Wait?\nThe responses to her post highlighted the classic Social Security dilemma: Take the smaller check sooner or hold out for a bigger benefit later?\n\"It's a gamble,\" one commenter wrote. \"Nobody knows when they'll be taken from this world.\" Another pointed out that if the partner passes away before 70, all that waiting could amount to nothing.\nOthers emphasized the break-even point \u2014 typically around age 76 to 78 \u2014 when the total value of waiting surpasses the value of claiming early. \u201cHe'll be 76 before he starts recovering funds lost that would\u2019ve been given up by retiring early,\u201d one user calculated.\nStill, some said that if he doesn\u2019t need the income, waiting seems like a logical move.\nNot Married? Survivor Benefits May Not Apply\nSome commenters brought up an important point: if the couple isn't married, survivor benefits may not apply. \"I just watched a friend lose out on benefits after her long-time partner passed away,\" one commenter noted.\nSee Also: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here\u2019s how you can earn passive income with just $10.\nSocial Security survivor benefits are generally available only to legal spouses. So if the partner were to pass away before or shortly after claiming, and they aren\u2019t legally married, the woman might not be eligible to receive those benefits. It's a detail worth clarifying when planning for the long term.\nThere's No One-Size-Fits-All Answer\nUltimately, the decision depends on health, life expectancy, financial needs \u2014 and in some cases, peace of mind. Users recommended tools like OpenSocialSecurity.com to help crunch the numbers based on individual situations.\nOne user summed it up: \"It\u2019s your partner\u2019s decision to make.\"\nFor couples nearing retirement, it's a good reminder that Social Security planning isn't just about the numbers \u2014 it's also about communication.\nRead Next: Many are using retirement income calculators to check if they\u2019re on pace \u2014 here\u2019s a breakdown on what\u2019s behind this formula.\nImage: Shutterstock\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Today, Range serves nearly 2,000 clients managing over $6 billion in assets.\nTaresh Batra, Range\u2019s vice president of Investments, says these AI-driven productivity gains could be the key to accelerating GDP growth while bringing inflation and interest rates down. \u201cHigher growth and lower interest rates as a result of AI could be a panacea for the markets,\u201d Batra says.\nProductivity is Key\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office uses the following formula to measure and forecast the country\u2019s GDP, or Gross Domestic Product:\nReal GDP Growth = Labor Growth(x labor contribution) + Capital Growth(x capital contribution) + Productivity\n\u201cOf these variables, changes in productivity have the largest impact on GDP growth,\u201d Batra says. \u201cTechnological innovation has been the driver of productivity over the course of history.\u201d\nAI, Batra argues, has the potential to improve productivity and benefit the economy in the coming years, similarly to how the dot-com boom did in the mid-1990s.\nHere\u2019s how:\n- Direct Economic Growth: With AI, companies and workers can be more productive without requiring additional resources.\n- More Jobs, Not Less: While AI may automate certain tasks, history shows that technology creates more jobs than it replaces. In fact, 60% of today\u2019s jobs didn\u2019t exist in 1940. The World Economic Forum projects AI will generate a net gain of 78 million new jobs this decade alone. Range itself exemplifies this trend by employing CFPs, CPAs, and CFAs who collaborate closely with AI engineers to build smarter financial tools.\n- Increased Tax Revenues: \u201cHigher productivity usually leads to higher corporate profits, wages, and economic activity\u2014all of which generate increased tax receipts,\u201d Batra says. \u201cMore government revenue means less need to borrow.\u201d\n- Disinflationary Pressure: \u201cLess government borrowing leads to lower inflationary pressure,\u201d Batra says. \u201cIn addition, productivity improvements reduce the cost of producing goods and services, which slows down inflation.\u201d\n- Improved Debt Dynamics & Lower Rates: Lower inflation means the Federal Reserve can lower interest rates, which helps stimulate the economy and allows the government to spend less on interest expense and spend more money on the private sector.\nWhat\u2019s more, we\u2019re already seeing measurable productivity gains in industries that have integrated AI tools into their workflow. Even if policymakers fail to rein in spending in the coming years, AI-driven productivity gains in the private sector may allow us to \u201cgrow our way\u201d out of fiscal distress.\n\u201cIf AI delivers even modest incremental productivity gains of 1-1.5% annually, the US could potentially maintain or reduce current debt-to-GDP levels despite continued spending growth,\u201d Batra says.\nAI Is Transforming, Not Destroying the Job Market\nYes, the rise of AI has resulted in people losing their jobs. This, however, is not a new phenomenon.\nTake farming, for example. Around 70% of people were employed in agriculture in the early 1800s, but that number is now less than 2% thanks to the creation of farming machines and other advancements.\nAt the same time, technological innovations not only created new jobs to replace the ones lost. They added new roles that previously never existed.\n\u201cRemarkably, 60% of the jobs people are employed in today didn't exist in 1940,\u201d Batra says. \u201cThat means nearly 90% of employment growth over the last 80 years resulted from technology creating entirely new categories of work.\u201d\nThe World Economic Forum\u2019s Future of Jobs Report estimates that AI and related technologies will create a net gain of 78 million new roles this decade.\nRange is living proof of this. They\u2019ve hired CFPs, CPAs, and CFAs as critical subject matter experts to help their AI engineers build and validate their platform.\n\u201cThese aren't traditional roles\u2014they represent the emergence of new types of knowledge workers who combine domain expertise with technological fluency,\u201d Batra says.\nHow You Could Bring the Power of AI Into Your Wealth Management With Range\nIn just four short years, Range has signed up almost 2,000 high income members and advises them on more than $6 billion in assets.\nCurrently in beta, Range\u2019s proprietary AI engine is capable of delivering financial insights and guidance in seconds, potentially allowing you to capitalize on opportunities and avoid any potential pitfalls \u2014 for example, if you should buy an investment property or if you can retire early based on your complete financial picture\nRange also operates on a flat-fee pricing model and offers portfolio management with 0% Assets Under Management fees, so you won\u2019t pay more as your net worth continues to grow.\nDisclaimers\nPlease be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.

Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nCollect passive income from real estate without taking on the headaches of being a landlord. You can now take advantage of the higher-for-longer interest rate environment by investing in a portfolio of private real estate debt with as little as $100.\nThe explosion of private credit returns is unlikely to last forever, but currently, it\u2019s one of the hottest asset classes out there. In 2020, its total value stood at $1.04 trillion. Just three years later, it grew by a staggering 55% to reach $1.61 trillion. BlackRock expects it to climb up to $3.5 trillion by 2028. The IMF has recognized its spectacular returns in recent years. Bezos\u2019 darling real estate platform, which has completely disrupted the industry, now targets 7%-9% in annual cash dividends through private debt investing.\nPrivate Debt for All\nArrived has become a household investment platform that knows how to deliver passive investments. It has generated $5.6 million for its investors in dividends alone, and its user base continues to grow throughout market fluctuations. The company now boasts 614,000 registered investors who routinely snap up the shares of its carefully vetted offerings. Over the years, it has developed deep knowledge about what makes real estate markets tick. Now, using that knowledge to deliver 7%-9% for investors looking to diversify into real estate private debt through the Arrived Private Credit Fund.\nThis type of corporate credit offers relatively higher profits at lower risk as it's backed by real estate. If things go south, investors may be able to recoup their losses, depending on their position. Arrived uses a tried and tested fund mechanism to deliver passive income to the investors. It pools the funds and uses them to finance specific real estate projects that pay out monthly interest. It\u2019s targeting 7% to 9% returns after all fees and expenses. To achieve this goal across its loans, it approaches individual loans with the same scrutiny level as the homes.\nArrived's Q3 2024 report underscores the broader success of its investment strategy. During the quarter, investors earned over $1.54 million in dividend income, marking a 25% increase from Q2 2024. Across 354 individual properties, single-family residential investments averaged 3.7% annualized dividends, while vacation rentals provided an average return of 2.8%. These consistent results demonstrate the platform's ability to balance income and appreciation across its portfolio.\nLIMITED TIME FOR JUST $100\nThe Byers House\nOwn a piece of the Byers House, a vacation rental located at the iconic home of Joyce, Jonathan, and Will Byers, featured in Stranger Things and located in Fayetteville, GA, just 20 minutes from Hartsfield Jackson International Airport. This property was used to film the exterior scenes in the actual show and influenced the design for the interior sets, which were filmed in a nearby studio.\nDebt Acquisition Tactics\nArrived partners only with experienced professionals with a history of successful real estate projects and a spotless financial record. Sticking to this criterion mitigates the risk of delays, cost overruns, and other unpredictable problems that may arise.\nAdditionally, the platform only considers residential properties in the first loan position, which creates a thick protection barrier in the event of a downside. If the borrower fails to repay the loan, Arrived and its investors would be the first to get their investment back.\nLocation also plays an important factor. Just like with its fractional share offerings, Arrived uses a combination of data science and human expertise to pinpoint the most promising deals that come its way.\nA Way In\nPrivate credit was reserved only for high-net-worth individuals who could afford the astronomical investment minimums and fees. But with the Arrived Private Credit Fund, any investor, accredited or non-accredited, can acquire a stake in the fund with as little as $100 and receive monthly dividends.\nClick here to invest in the Arrived Private Credit Fund.\nCheck out the latest offerings on Arrived\nDiversify your portfolio with a mix of debt and equity real estate investments through Arrived's multiple offerings.\nHold on!\nInvestors are seeing outstanding returns through curated real estate investment alerts.

Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nYou see a shocking number of ads daily \u2013 researchers estimate between 6,000 and 10,000 and 375 to 625 per waking hour. In the modern age, most of them come from social media apps whose entire business model revolves around constantly showing you ads and keeping 100% of the revenue. But what if users got a share? That company might just grow its revenue by 32,481% in three years, help users earn and save $325 million and be named Deloitte's fastest-growing software company in North America. That\u2019s what Mode Mobile did. You can still get in for just $0.30 per share.\nReaching Financial Stability One Tap at a Time\nMost Americans can\u2019t afford a $1,000 emergency bill. That means many are one car breakdown or ER visit away from serious financial trouble. There's no quick fix to such a big financial challenge that over 50% of Americans face. However, it's safe to bet that the masses will flock to any good solutions. Mode Mobile created one such solution years ago by allowing people to earn money doing what they already spend a third of their waking hours on \u2013 tapping, scrolling and looking at their smartphone screens.\nMode Mobile developed a smartphone called EarnPhone, which allows users to earn and save money by playing video games, listening to music and reading the news. With the phone priced at an affordable $99, the barriers to adoption are low. However, users can earn income on their existing devices as well. This extreme competitiveness has allowed Mode Mobile to attract over 50 million registered beta users. Launching the finalized version could bring in millions more, helping the company reach its goal of $150 million in annual revenue within three years.\n6,955,000,000 Users to Go\nCurrently, seven billion smartphones worldwide provide functionality or entertainment but take all the profits. Mode Mobile\u2019s disruption offers the same benefits but allows users to earn money at a time when the prices of goods are skyrocketing. Just like Airbnb lets users earn extra cash by renting out their bedrooms and Uber allows users to make money on their rides back home from work, Mode Mobile wants to enable its users to make money from their phones. However, its total addressable market is much larger than Airbnb\u2019s and Uber\u2019s \u2013 currently at over $1 trillion.\nYou can invest in Mode Mobile at $0.30 per share with a minimum investment of $4,950. Plus, the company is offering the chance to earn up to 120% in bonus shares, if you invest more. All funding rounds open to non-accredited investors, including Mode Mobile\u2019s, are limited in time. So, if you\u2019d like to be part of the future it's building, consider acting soon.\nDisclaimer:\nAN OFFERING STATEMENT REGARDING THIS OFFERING HAS BEEN FILED WITH THE SEC.

      "text": "Retirement, ideally a period of relaxation and enjoyment after years of hard work, is often envisioned as a time to pursue hobbies, travel or simply unwind. But without a solid financial plan, many Americans worry they\u2019ll outlive their money. This fear is often more acute among married couples, who face the added complexity of planning for two people with varying financial needs.\nIf you're 50 or older and have over $100,000 in investable assets, now is the time to take retirement planning seriously. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be difficult. WiserAdvisor's free tool matches you with a vetted financial advisor that meets your needs, with no obligation to hire.\n60% of Americans Lack a Retirement-Specific Account\u2013 Do you?\nA NerdWallet study, using the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances, indicates that 60% of Americans lack a retirement-specific account. The disparity in average household retirement savings by age group further illustrates this issue:\n- Under 35: $49,130 (median: $18,880)\n- Ages 35 to 44: $141,520 (median: $45,000)\n- Ages 45 to 54: $313,220 (median: $115,000)\n- Ages 55 to 64: $537,560 (median: $185,000)\n- Ages 65 to 74: $609,230 (median: $200,000)\nThese figures show a significant gap between average and median savings, pointing to a broad spectrum of financial preparedness across different age groups. Those nearing retirement, especially those with $250,000 or more in retirement savings, stand to benefit most from expert, fiduciary guidance.\nTo guide couples in their retirement planning, T. Rowe Price, a reputable global investment management firm, provides savings benchmarks as multiples of income, varying by household income and marital status.\nFor example, a dual-income married couple with an annual income of $75,000 at age 55 should have retirement savings equal to five times their income, which should increase to 8.5 times by age 65. These benchmarks scale up for higher-income brackets, and for those with $250,000 or more in assets, strategic investment planning becomes especially important.\nFind a Vetted Financial Advisor\nIf you\u2019ve worked hard to build a nest egg of $100,000 or more, WiserAdvisor can connect you with a trusted, independent fiduciary advisor who understands the unique financial needs of pre-retirees and retirees.\nFiduciary advisors are legally required to put your interests first.

      "text": "For many Americans, Social Security is the foundation of retirement. But experts are warning that the program is heading toward a funding shortfall \u2014 and it could arrive sooner than many people realize.\nChile overhauled its failing public pension system decades ago, and despite recent reforms to address its shortcomings, some analysts still point to its early structure as a model worth examining as the U.S. confronts its own Social Security challenges.\nDon't Miss:\n- Accredited Investors: Grab Pre-IPO Shares of the AI Company Powering Hasbro, Sephora & MGM\u2014Just $0.63 Before NASDAQ Launch\n- \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share.\nToday's Best Finance Deals\nWhy Social Security's Future Looks Uncertain\nSocial Security has been around since the Great Depression, and today it accounts for about 22% of all federal spending. It is funded by payroll taxes: workers and employers each pay 6.2% on wages up to $176,100. For a long time, the program brought in more than it paid out. But that changed in 2009. Since then, Social Security has been dipping into its trust fund to cover the difference.\nThe issue is that the trust fund is running out \u2014 and fast. If Congress doesn't act, it could be empty by 2033. That would mean automatic benefit cuts of around 23%, unless lawmakers find another way to fill the gap.\nIdeas have been thrown around \u2014 like raising the retirement age, raising taxes, or borrowing money to fund the program \u2014 but none of these are easy choices. And the longer the delay, the more difficult the decision becomes.\nTrending: $100k+ in investable assets? Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes \u2013 no cost, no obligation.\nFewer Workers, Longer Lives\nWhen Social Security began, there were dozens of workers supporting each retiree, according to the SSA. Today, that number is less than three \u2014 and it continues to shrink. People are living longer, birth rates are lower, and the workforce isn't growing fast enough to keep up.\nThis creates a growing imbalance. A commentary from Law & Liberty, the online magazine of libertarian think tank Liberty Fund, notes that recent retirees are likely to receive more from the system than they put in, while younger generations may pay in far more than they'll ever get back.\nChile Faced a Similar Problem \u2014 and Took a Different Route\nBack in the 1980s, Chile faced an economic crisis, including a stock market crash, that exposed deep flaws in its public pension system \u2014 a challenge made worse by an aging population and rising retirement costs. Rather than raise taxes or reduce benefits, the country introduced a new system that allowed workers to contribute to personal retirement accounts managed by private investment firms. According to Law & Liberty, workers retained ownership of their savings, and over time, many saw strong returns.\nBut the system wasn't without controversy. Critics pointed to low payouts and high profits for private administrators, especially as economic conditions changed. According to Reuters, Chile's Congress passed a major reform package in January that increases employer contributions and introduces a social security component aimed at improving retirement outcomes and reducing inequality \u2014 particularly for women.\nThe new reform, backed by President Gabriel Boric, also restructures the country's pension fund administrators into separate investment and administrative entities and opens the market to new providers, including international firms.\nSee Also: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here\u2019s how you can earn passive income with just $10.\nCould the U.S. Do Something Similar?\nWhile Chile is now revisiting its approach, some experts still point to the country's earlier model as an example of how structural change can be achieved. Law & Liberty suggests that giving younger workers in the U.S. the option to invest payroll taxes in managed retirement accounts \u2014 with built-in safety nets and regulations \u2014 could help reduce long-term strain on the Social Security system.\nOf course, there are big questions to answer \u2014 including how to handle the transition and how to protect savers from market risks. But with Social Security facing a projected shortfall of nearly $23 trillion, some say it may be time to consider broader reforms.\nWhat Comes Next?\nNo one is proposing changes for current retirees or those nearing retirement \u2014 and most agree those benefits should remain protected. But for younger workers, the debate is heating up. As the funding gap grows, lawmakers will face tough decisions about how to keep Social Security solvent.\nWhether reforms come through tax increases, benefit changes, or something more structural, one thing is clear: the longer the delay, the fewer options there will be \u2014 and the harder the choices will become.\nRead Next: Many are using retirement income calculators to check if they\u2019re on pace \u2014 here\u2019s a breakdown on what\u2019s behind this formula.\nImage: Shutterstock\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
