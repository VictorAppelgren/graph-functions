  "description": "From elevator etiquette to AI caregivers, we explore the social, ethical, and global impact of living alongside robots.",
  "content": "Arguably the most important thing that the rise of intelligent AI could potentially bring is access. Access to goods, services, and information not just for the few, but for everyone.\n\nVictoria Slivkoff, Head of Ecosystem at Walden Catalyst and Managing Director of Extreme Tech Challenge \u2014 a nonprofit uniting startups and VCs to accelerate progress toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \u2014 is excited for what lies ahead. In her view, the physical manifestation of AI could bring us closer to realising these ambitious goals.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re moving into the area of reasoning. AI is not just aggregating and organising information, it\u2019s actually making predictions and drawing conclusions. How does that translate to the real world where robots can sense, learn, and interact with their surroundings?\u201d she said to TNW founder Boris Veldhuijzen van Zaten in the latest episode of \u201cKia\u2019s Next Big Drive.\u201d\n\nWatch the full interview where Victoria and Boris discuss how we can leverage emerging technologies for positive global impact as they drive to TNW2025 in Kia\u2019s 100% electric EV9 SUV.\n\nIn the not too distant future, we could be living in a world where robots are regularly navigating busy streets, offices, and classrooms. But as they become more common in our daily lives, is it them or us who will need to adapt most?\n\nPicture this: you\u2019re waiting for the elevator and a robot arrives at the same time. Who goes in first? If there\u2019s only room for one, would you expect the robot to step aside, or would you treat it like a human and follow a \u201cfirst come, first serve\u201d approach?\n\nPast studies have found that most people expect service robots to be submissive, leading humans to prioritise themselves during conflicts, even in instances when a robot\u2019s task was more urgent.\n\nWhat if a robot is carrying out a time specific task? The longer it waits until there are no humans in the queue, the longer it will take to complete it, whether it\u2019s delivering a warm pizza or life saving medical supplies. So, how should robots navigate these social nuances without being ignored, undermined, or even bullied?\n\nThat\u2019s what researchers aimed to find out last year in a study titled A Robot Jumping the Queue: Expectations About Politeness and Power During Conflicts in Everyday Human-Robot Encounters.\n\nThe researchers found that these robot-human interactions were more effective if participants expected an assertive robot which then asked politely for priority and entered first. But it\u2019s not just robots that need to prepare to integrate into human society. The researchers highlighted that we may also need to rethink our attitudes and behaviours towards robots:\n\n\u201cShould we maybe start thinking of service robots as having certain rights regarding priority if they fulfil human jobs with human responsibilities \u2014 or act as proxies for people? This might also help address the issue of robot bullying.\u201d\n\nAs robots take on not only more responsibilities but also develop reason and sentience, at what point should we begin rethinking their social status?\n\nSocial robots \u2014 designed to communicate and interact with humans \u2014 are increasingly being used in caregiving, education, and mental health. In these settings, they help bridge service gaps, ease isolation, and offer emotional or learning support.\n\nUtrecht University of Applied Sciences is among those researching how robots can do more than just fill in; they can augment and enrich human-centred fields. For example:\n\nIn healthcare, how can robots be used to ease pre-procedure anxiety in children? Or help teach emotional skills for young patients who struggle with emotion regulation.\n\nAt last year\u2019s Lowlands Science festival, the University showcased WOKEbot, a project exploring how a robot\u2019s appearance and narrative voice (first vs. third person) influence human openness when discussing polarising topics.\n\n\u201cDisagreements are timeless. People often manage to resolve them, but sometimes they simply can\u2019t reach each other anymore. We saw this happen on a large scale not so long ago during the coronavirus pandemic. Are you for or against vaccination? When people dig in their heels and polarisation threatens, it can be helpful to have a neutral moderator,\u201d said Dr. Mirjam de Haas. \u201cThe advantage of robots is that they are more neutral than humans. While you might be reserved with a person, a robot can make you more open and receptive to a different perspective.\u201d\n\nAs part of her PhD research, Dr. Haas also conducted a number of successful experiments in using robotics to teach Dutch as a second language to students from linguistically diverse backgrounds. In her thesis defence, Dr. Haas explained that in the future, more and more students will fill classrooms. Having a robot aid will help facilitate learning for all students, including those with learning disabilities or those who are not yet fluent in Dutch.\n\nIs the world safe for robots?\n\nPerhaps the most recognisable robot in popular culture is The Terminator. In the first movie, a cyborg played by Arnold Schwarzenegger is sent back in time to assassinate the mother of humanity\u2019s future leader. But, in the sequel, our villain returns with a new mission: to save humanity.\n\nThe SDGs were adopted by all UN members in 2015. Ten years on, in a world sliding further away from the 17 promises laid out for people and the planet, could robots deployed for good be the key to bringing us back to our humanity?",

      "text": "A robot as a buddy in healthcare? \u201cChildren really see it as a friend\u201d\nAnouk Neerincx explored how robots can play a role in youth healthcare\nCan social robots help children during medical procedures and provide emotional support? PhD candidate Anouk Neerincx investigated how robots can reduce stress in healthcare environments and discovered that children respond surprisingly positively. On 24 March, she will defend her dissertation at Utrecht University.\nA robot with a friendly face rolls into a waiting room. \"Hi! How are you?\" it asks a child in a soft voice. The child hesitates for a moment but soon relaxes. They start playing a game together\u2014suddenly, the upcoming vaccination feels a little less scary.\nSocial robots\nVisiting the Centrum voor Jeugd en Gezin (Youth and Family Center) for a vaccination or health check-up can be nerve-wracking for children. But what if a social robot could ease that anxiety? In her PhD research, Anouk Neerincx explored how robots can help reduce stress, encourage children to talk about their health, and teach them emotional skills.\n\"Children often truly see a robot as a friend,\" says Neerincx. \"Unlike adults, who are more aware of a robot\u2019s limitations, children simply go along with the interaction. That makes social robots particularly interesting for healthcare applications.\"\nAdults are more aware of a robot\u2019s limitations\u2014children just play along. That makes social robots interesting for youth healthcare applications.\nDesigning together\nFor her research, Neerincx collaborated with the Centrum voor Jeugd en Gezin, which provides accessible healthcare for children. She involved children, parents, and healthcare professionals in designing her study through creative workshops, interviews, and interactive sessions. \"We asked them: where could a robot truly make a difference?\" she explains. This led to various scenarios and user requirements. During the testing phase, she explored three potential applications for the robot:\n- Easing pre-procedure anxiety \u2013 Could a robot help reduce stress before a vaccination? Using surveys and observations, Neerincx examined how robots affected children in the waiting room. The results showed that the robot helped children relax and provided a welcome distraction. Interestingly, parents tended to step back a little when their child interacted with the robot.\n- Teaching emotional skills \u2013 Together with researchers in Lisbon, Neerincx developed a game where a robot helps children recognise and name emotions. \"Many children visiting the Centrum voor Jeugd en Gezin struggle with emotion regulation,\" she says. \"A robot can provide a safe way to explore feelings.\"\n- Encouraging conversations about healthcare \u2013 Neerincx tested this at science festivals (Betweter and Expeditie NEXT), where visitors could discuss COVID with a robot. \"We found that both the personality of the person and the personality of the robot influenced how much people were willing to share,\" she notes.\nMore than just a screen\nWhat makes a robot more effective than a tablet or an animation? \"A robot can move, gesture, and has a voice. That makes the interaction feel more natural,\" Neerincx explains. Her research showed that a robot with expressive gestures was more effective in reducing anxiety than a static one.\nHowever, social robots are not a one-size-fits-all solution. \"Some children absolutely love robots, while others might find them intimidating. The context in which you introduce a robot greatly influences what it needs to do.\"\nUnexpected bond\nThroughout her experiments, Neerincx repeatedly observed how deeply children could connect with a robot. \"One of the most touching moments was when a little girl\u2014maybe three or four years old, actually too young for our study\u2014started telling the robot stories in great detail. It really doesn\u2019t take much: place a robot in the room, let it do a little dance, and children are immediately engaged.\"\nEven older children responded more positively than expected. \"We worked with kids up to sixteen years old, and even they often enjoyed the interaction. I didn\u2019t see that coming.\"\nWhat\u2019s next?\nAfter completing her PhD, Neerincx will continue as a researcher in Social Robotics and a lecturer in the ICT bachelor\u2019s program at Utrecht University of Applied Sciences. During her PhD, she already taught courses in the Information Science bachelor's program and the Human-Computer Interaction master\u2019s program. She remains committed to exploring human-robot interaction in her future research."

      "text": "HU op Lowlands Science: een inclusief gesprek met de WOKEbot\nVan 16 tot en met 18 augustus staat Hogeschool Utrecht op Lowlands. Festivalgangers konden er bij Lowlands Science in gesprek met de WOKEbot. Mirjam de Haas, docent-onderzoeker bij het lectoraat Betekenisvol Digitaal Innoveren: \u201cHet voordeel van robots is dat ze neutraler zijn dan mensen. Waar je terughoudend kan zijn tegenover een persoon, kan een robot je opener maken, en je ontvankelijk maken voor een ander perspectief.\u201d\nIn de centrale tent van Lowlands Science legt Mirjam de Haas, docent-onderzoeker bij het lectoraat Betekenisvol Digitaal Innoveren, aan bezoekers uit waar het idee van deze robot vandaan kwam. \u201cMeningsverschillen zijn van alle tijden. Vaak komen mensen er wel uit, maar soms weten ze elkaar echt niet meer te bereiken. Dat zagen we nog niet zo lang geleden op grote schaal gebeuren tijdens de coronapandemie. Ben je voor vaccinatie of tegen? Als mensen de hakken in het zand zetten en polarisatie dreigt, kan het helpen een neutrale gespreksleider te hebben.\u201d Alleen, wat is neutraal? Ook een gespreksleider heeft een mening. \u201cMaar een robot niet. Die is ook niet mannelijk of vrouwelijk, heeft geen opleidingsniveau, komt niet uit een bepaalde sociale klasse.\u201d Wat gebeurt er als zo\u2019n robot het gesprek leidt?\nElkaars perspectief laten zien\nDe WOKEbot is een robot met een menselijk gezicht waarvan het uiterlijk op allerlei manieren is aan te passen. Mirjam: \u201cHij kan het gesprek neutraal leiden maar kan ook tijdelijk een bepaalde rol spelen. Zo kan hij in een discussie over coronavaccinaties de rol spelen van arts, van pati\u00ebnt of van een bezorgde burger. De WOKEbot laat mensen dan elkaars perspectief zien waardoor ze elkaar beter leren begrijpen.\u201d\nInclusiever worden\nEen festivalganger wil weten wie de WOKEbot opleidt, met welke data hij (of zij, of hen) wordt gevoed. \u201cNou, onder andere die van jullie\u201d, antwoord Mirjam. Op Lowlands Science wil de HU enerzijds mensen laten kennismaken met mensgerichte AI. Maar met de opgehaalde gegevens kan de WOKEbot hopelijk ook weer verder \u2018leren\u2019, om de optimale gespreksleider te worden. Waarbij de robot nooit de mens gaat kunnen vervangen. Benadrukt Mirjam: het is een hulpmiddel. \u201cRobots kunnen ter ondersteuning zijn voor mensen die zich beter willen leren uiten. Het grote doel is dat mensen nader tot elkaar komen, en daarmee inclusiever worden.\u201d\nConfronterend\nDe animo onder festivalgangers is groot, maar tussen het verwelkomen van nieuwe bezoekers door heeft HU-docent Steijn van der Craats wel even tijd om wat te vertellen over de bezoekers. \u201cDe mensen zijn heel nieuwsgierig. Wat gaan we precies doen? Hoe werkt zo\u2019n robot? Na het gesprek reageren de meesten heel positief. Soms wordt iemand in het gesprek geconfronteerd met de eigen vooroordelen, dan hoor je: \u2018Maar ik ben harstikke woke!\u2019 Dat kan even pijnlijk zijn, maar ook dat is uiteindelijk leerzaam. Vooroordelen hebben we allemaal.\u201d\nGender\nIn het kader van het onderzoek vraagt Steijn aan mensen die zich aanmelden, wat hun gender is. \u201cIk merk dat dit als fijn wordt ervaren; dat we er niet van uitgaan dat we op basis van het uiterlijk al weten wat iemands gender is. Achteraf zeggen mensen ook wel eens: hoe weet ik nou eigenlijk welke gender de robot is? Ook de robot moet dus een gender hebben. Dat zijn onverwachte, leuke en waardevolle inzichten die we hier opdoen op Lowlands Science.\u201d\nHet onderzoek wordt uitgevoerd door het Lectoraat Betekenisvol Digitaal Innoveren en het Lectoraat Smart Systems for Healthy Living van Hogeschool Utrecht.

To accomplish time-critical tasks, it can be necessary for robots to take precedence over humans. Giving a justification for such dominant robot behaviour, based on the urgency of its task, might mitigate negative effects on trust and acceptance and enhance behavioural compliance by waiting for the robot to pass. This study investigates the perceived urgency of different tasks a robot might perform. Therefore, 129 participants rated and compared ten tasks in an online study. The results reveal differences in perceived task urgency, related to time pressure in accomplishing the task. Differences in task urgency also affected the choice of who should be given priority to precede in a spatial conflict (human or robot). Furthermore, the results indicate a bias around human-robot interactions: Priority was more often granted to the human than the robot, when equally urgent tasks were presented for both entities.\nSpringer"

      "text": "In today's world, understanding different viewpoints is key for societal cohesion and progress. Robots have the potential to provide aid in discussing tough topics like ethnicity and gender. However, comparably to humans, the appearance of a robot can trigger inherent prejudices. This study delves into the interplay between robot appearance and decision-making in ethical dilemmas. Employing a Furhat robot that can change faces in an instant, we looked at how robot appearance affects decision-making and the perception of the robot itself. Pairs of participants were invited to discuss a dilemma presented by a robot, covering sensitive topics of ethnicity or gender. The robot either adopted a first-person or third-person perspective and altered its appearance accordingly. Following the explanation, participants were encouraged to discuss their choice of action in the dilemma situation. We did not find significant influences of robot appearance or dilemma topic on perceived anthropomorphism, animacy, likeability, or intelligence of the robot, partly in line with previous research. However, several participants hearing the dilemma from a first-person perspective changed their opinion because of the robot's appearance. Future work can expand with different measures such as engagement, in order to shed light on the intricate dynamics of human-robot interaction, emphasizing the need for thoughtful consideration in designing robot appearances to promote unbiased engagement in discussions of societal significance"
