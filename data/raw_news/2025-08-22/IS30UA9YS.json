  "content": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Just days away from a European deadline, Iran said Friday its foreign minister would hold a telephone conference call with his French, German and British counterparts to avoid the reimposition of United Nations sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program.\n\nThe call, planned for Friday by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi according to Iran's state-run IRNA news agency, comes as the three parties to Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal threaten to reimpose those sanctions under a mechanism known as \u201csnapback\u201d in the accord. The European Union's chief diplomat will also join the call, IRNA said.\n\nThe Europeans' concern over the Iranian program, which had been enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels before the 12-day Iran-Israel war in June saw its atomic sites bombed, has only grown since Tehran cut off all cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency in the conflict's wake. That has left the international community further blinded to Iran's program \u2014 as well as the status of its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60% purity, a short, technical step to weapons-grade levels of 90%.\n\nIran has long insisted its program is peaceful, though it is the only non-nuclear-armed nation enriching uranium at that level. The U.S., the IAEA and others assess Iran had a nuclear weapons program up until 2003.\n\nIn a letter Aug. 8, the three European nations warned Iran it would proceed with \u201csnapback\u201d if Tehran didn't reach a \u201csatisfactory solution\u201d to the nuclear issues. That deadline would be Aug. 31, in nine days, leaving little time for Iran to likely reach any agreement with the Europeans, who have grown increasingly skeptical of Iran over years of inconclusive negotiations over its nuclear program.\n\nRestoring the IAEA's access is a key part of the talks. Iran has blamed the war with Israel in part on the IAEA, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, without offering any evidence. The IAEA issues quarterly reports on Iran's program and the 2015 deal gave it greater access to keep track of it.\n\nIran has also threatened its director-general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, with arrest if he comes to Iran, further complicating talks. Grossi is considering running to become the U.N.'s secretary-general, something Tehran has seized on as well in its criticisms of the Argentine diplomat.\n\nThe \u201csnapback\u201d power in the nuclear accord expires in October, also putting pressure on the Europeans to potentially use it as leverage with Iran before losing that ability.\n\nUnder \u201csnapback,\u201d any party to the deal can find Iran in noncompliance, reimposing the sanctions. After it expires, any sanctions effort could face a veto from U.N. Security Council members China and Russia, two nations that have provided some support to Iran in the past but stayed out of the June war.",

      "text": "What to know about inspections of Iran\u2019s nuclear program by the IAEA ahead of a key board vote\nWhat to know about inspections of Iran\u2019s nuclear program by the IAEA ahead of a key board vote\nVIENNA (AP) \u2014 Iran\u2019s nuclear program remains a top focus for inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, particularly as any possible deal between Tehran and the United States over the program would likely rely on the agency long known as the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog.\nThis week, Western nations will push for a measure at the IAEA\u2019s Board of Governors censuring Iran over its noncompliance with inspectors, pushing the matter before the U.N. Security Council. Barring any deal with Washington, Iran then could face what\u2019s known as \u201csnapback\u201d \u2014 the reimposition of all U.N. sanctions on it originally lifted by Tehran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, if one of its Western parties declares the Islamic Republic is out of compliance with it.\nAll this sets the stage for a renewed confrontation with Iran as the Mideast remains inflamed by Israel\u2019s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. And the IAEA\u2019s work in any case will make the Vienna-based agency a key player.\nHere\u2019s more to know about the IAEA, its inspections of Iran and the deals \u2014 and dangers \u2014 at play.\nAtoms for peace\nThe IAEA was created in 1957. The idea for it grew out of a 1953 speech given by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower at the U.N., in which he urged the creation of an agency to monitor the world\u2019s nuclear stockpiles to ensure that \u201cthe miraculous inventiveness of man shall not be dedicated to his death, but consecrated to his life.\u201d\nBroadly speaking, the agency verifies the reported stockpiles of member nations. Those nations are divided into three categories.\nThe vast majority are nations with so-called \u201ccomprehensive safeguards agreements\u201d with the IAEA, states without nuclear weapons that allow IAE monitoring over all nuclear material and activities. Then there\u2019s the \u201cvoluntary offer agreements\u201d with the world\u2019s original nuclear weapons states \u2014 China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the U.S. \u2014 typically for civilian sites.\nFinally, the IAEA has \u201citem-specific agreements\u201d with India, Israel and Pakistan \u2014 nuclear-armed countries that haven\u2019t signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. That treaty has countries agree not to build or obtain nuclear weapons. North Korea, which is also nuclear armed, said it has withdrawn from the treaty, though that\u2019s disputed by some experts.\nThe collapse of Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal\nIran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, negotiated under then-President Barack Obama, allowed Iran to enrich uranium to 3.67% \u2014 enough to fuel a nuclear power plant but far below the threshold of 90% needed for weapons-grade uranium. It also drastically reduced Iran\u2019s stockpile of uranium, limited its use of centrifuges and relied on the IAEA to oversee Tehran\u2019s compliance through additional oversight.\nBut President Donald Trump in his first term in 2018 unilaterally withdrew America from the accord, insisting it wasn\u2019t tough enough and didn\u2019t address Iran\u2019s missile program or its support for militant groups in the wider Mideast. That set in motion years of tensions, including attacks at sea and on land.\nIran now enriches up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. It also has enough of a stockpile to build multiple nuclear bombs, should it choose to do so. Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but the IAEA, Western intelligence agencies and others say Tehran had an organized weapons program up until 2003.\nIAEA inspections and Iran\nUnder the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to allow the IAEA even greater access to its nuclear program. That included permanently installing cameras and sensors at nuclear sites. Those cameras, inside of metal housings sprayed with a special blue paint that shows any attempt to tamper with it, took still images of sensitive sites. Other devices, known as online enrichment monitors, measured the uranium enrichment level at Iran\u2019s Natanz nuclear facility.\nThe IAEA also regularly sent inspectors into Iranian sites to conduct surveys, sometimes collecting environmental samples with cotton clothes and swabs that would be tested at IAEA labs back in Austria. Others monitor Iranian sites via satellite images.\nIn the years since Trump\u2019s 2018 decision, Iran has limited IAEA inspections and stopped the agency from accessing camera footage. It\u2019s also removed cameras. At one point, Iran accused an IAEA inspector of testing positive for explosive nitrates, something the agency disputed.\nThe IAEA has engaged in years of negotiations with Iran to restore full access for its inspectors. While Tehran hasn\u2019t granted that, it also hasn\u2019t entirely thrown inspectors out. Analysts view this as part of Iran\u2019s wider strategy to use its nuclear program as a bargaining chip with the West.\nWhat happens next\nIran and the U.S. have gone through five rounds of negotiations over a possible deal, with talks mediated by the sultanate of Oman. Iran appears poised to reject an American proposal over a deal this week.\nWithout a deal with the U.S., Iran\u2019s long-ailing economy could enter a freefall that could worsen the simmering unrest at home. Israel or the U.S. might carry out long-threatened airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities. Experts fear Tehran in response could decide to fully end its cooperation with the IAEA, abandon the the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and rush toward a bomb.\nIf a deal is reached \u2014 or at least a tentative understanding between the two sides \u2014 that likely will take the pressure off for an immediate military strike by the U.S. Gulf Arab states, which opposed Obama\u2019s negotiations with Iran in 2015, now welcome the talks under Trump. Any agreement would require the IAEA\u2019s inspectors to verify Iran\u2019s compliance.\nBut Israel, which has struck at Iranian-backed militants across the region, remains a wildcard on what it could do. Last year, it carried out its first military airstrikes on Iran \u2014 and has warned it is willing to take action alone to target Tehran\u2019s program, like it has in the past in Iraq in 1981 or Syria in 2007.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Stephanie Liechtenstein contributed to this report. ___\nThe Associated Press receives support for nuclear security coverage from the Carnegie Corporation of New York and Outrider Foundation.

      "text": "Ceasefire between Israel and Iran appears to hold as Trump vents frustration with both sides\nCeasefire between Israel and Iran appears to hold as Trump vents frustration with both sides\n\u25b6 Follow live updates on the Israel-Iran war\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 A fragile ceasefire between Iran and Israel appeared to hold Tuesday after initially faltering, and U.S. President Donald Trump expressed frustration with both sides, saying they had fought \u201cfor so long and so hard\u201d that they do not know what they are doing.\nBut even as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed Israel had brought Iran\u2019s nuclear program \u201cto ruin,\u201d a new U.S. intelligence report found that the program has been set back only a few months after U.S. strikes over the weekend, according to two people familiar with the assessment.\nThe early report issued Monday by the Defense Intelligence Agency was described to The Associated Press by two people familiar with it. They were not authorized to address the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nThe report also contradicts statements from Trump, who has said the Iranian nuclear program was \u201ccompletely and fully obliterated.\u201d The White House called the assessment \u201cflat-out wrong.\u201d\nAfter the truce was supposed to take effect, Israel accused Iran of launching missiles into its airspace, and the Israeli finance minister vowed that \u201cTehran will tremble.\u201d\nThe Iranian military denied firing on Israel, state media reported, but explosions boomed and sirens sounded across northern Israel in the morning, and an Israeli military official said two Iranian missiles were intercepted.\nTrump told reporters at the White House before departing for a NATO summit that, in his view, both sides had violated the nascent agreement. He had particularly strong words for Israel, a close ally, while suggesting Iran may have fired on the country by mistake.\nFrom AP\u2019s Standards and Stylebook teams:\nThe AP is calling the conflict between Israel and Iran a war, given the scope, intensity and duration of military activities on both sides. Click here for an explanation of this decision.\nBut later he said the deal was saved.\n\u201cISRAEL is not going to attack Iran. All planes will turn around and head home, while doing a friendly \u201cPlane Wave\u201d to Iran. Nobody will be hurt, the Ceasefire is in effect!\u201d Trump said in his Truth Social post.\nIndeed, Netanyahu\u2019s office said he held off on tougher strikes against Iran after speaking to Trump.\nIran\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday the Islamic Republic emerged \u201cproud and steadfast\u201d from the aggression by Israel and the United States.\n\u201cThis proves one simple truth more clearly than ever: diplomacy and dialogue are the only path to resolving the unnecessary crisis over Iran\u2019s peaceful program,\u201d he said.\nA dozen tense days\nThe conflict, now in its 12th day, began with Israel targeting Iranian nuclear and military sites, saying it could not allow Tehran to develop atomic weapons and that it feared the Islamic Republic was close. Iran has long maintained that its program is peaceful.\nIf the truce holds, it will provide a global sense of relief after the U.S. intervened by dropping bunker-buster bombs on nuclear sites \u2014 a move that risked further destabilizing the volatile region.\nTrump phoned Netanyahu after the American bombing on Sunday and told him not to expect additional U.S. military attacks and that he should seek a diplomatic solution with Iran, a senior White House official said.\nTrump\u2019s position was that the U.S. had removed any imminent threat posed by Iran, according to the official, who was not authorized to comment publicly about sensitive diplomatic talks and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nIsrael followed up the U.S. air attacks by expanding the kinds of targets it was hitting.\nAfter Tehran launched a limited retaliatory strike Monday on a U.S. military base in Qatar, Trump announced the ceasefire.\nA protracted conflict could have a broad economic impact if Iran closed the Strait of Hormuz, a major shipping channel.\nChina, which is Iran\u2019s largest trading partner and only remaining oil customer, condemned the U.S. attacks and said it was concerned about a \u201cspiral of escalations\u201d without a ceasefire. Trump suggested the ceasefire would allow Iranian oil to continue to flow, saying on social media that China could keep purchasing crude from Iran.\nIsrael accuses Iran of violating the truce. Iran denies allegation\nThe deal got off to a rocky start.\nAn Israeli military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military regulations said Iran launched two missiles at Israel hours into the tenuous ceasefire. Both were intercepted, the official said.\nIranian state television reported that the military denied firing missiles after the start of the ceasefire \u2014 while condemning Israel for predawn strikes of its own.\nOne of those attacks killed a high-profile nuclear scientist, Mohammad Reza Sedighi Saber, at his father-in-law\u2019s residence in northern Iran, Iranian state TV reported.\nTrump\u2019s frustration with the early morning strikes was palpable as he spoke to reporters before departing for the Hague. He said both sides had violated the agreement and used an expletive to hammer home his point.\n\u201cWe basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don\u2019t know what the f\u2014- they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.\nBreakthrough announced after hostilities spread\nNetanyahu said Israel agreed to the ceasefire with Iran, in coordination with Trump, after the country achieved all of its war goals, including removing the threat of Iran\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\nIn a televised statement, Netanyahu said late Tuesday that Israel took out top generals and nuclear scientists and destroyed nuclear facilities in Natanz, Isfahan and the Arak heavy water reactor. He thanked Trump for his help.\nIt\u2019s unclear what role Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s leader, played in the talks. He said earlier on social media that he would not surrender.\nTrump said Tuesday that he wasn\u2019t seeking regime change in Iran, two days after floating the idea himself in a social media post.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want it,\u201d Trump told reporters on Air Force One. \u201cRegime change takes chaos and, ideally, we don\u2019t want to see much chaos.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News that the U.S. and Iran are already in early discussions about resuming negotiations over Iran\u2019s nuclear program. He called the direct talks and discussions through intermediaries \u201cpromising.\u201d\nBefore the ceasefire was announced, Israel\u2019s military said Iran launched 20 missiles toward Israel. Police said they damaged at least three densely packed residential buildings in the city of Beersheba. First responders said they retrieved four bodies from one building and were searching for more. At least 20 people were injured.\nOutside, the shells of burned out cars littered the streets. Broken glass and rubble covered the area. Police said some people were injured while inside their apartments\u2019 reinforced safe rooms, which are meant to withstand rockets but not direct hits from ballistic missiles.\nThe attack followed a limited Iranian missile assault Monday on a U.S. military base in Qatar in retaliation for earlier American bombing of its nuclear sites. The U.S. was warned by Iran in advance, and there were no casualties.\nElsewhere, U.S. forces shot down drones attacking the Ain al-Assad base in the desert in western Iraq and a base next to the Baghdad airport, while another one crashed, according to a senior U.S. military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly.\nNo casualties were reported, and no group claimed responsibility for the attacks in Iraq. Some Iran-backed Iraqi militias had previously threatened to target U.S. bases if the U.S. attacked Iran.\nConflict has killed hundreds\nIn Israel, at least 28 people have been killed and more than 1,000 wounded in the war. Israeli strikes on Iran have killed at least 974 people and wounded 3,458 others, according to the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists.\nThe group, which has provided detailed casualty figures from Iranian unrest, said of those killed, it identified 387 civilians and 268 security force personnel.\nThe U.S. has evacuated some 250 American citizens and their immediate family members from Israel by government, military and charter flights that began over the weekend, a State Department official said.\nThere are roughly 700,000 American citizens, most of them dual U.S.-Israeli citizens, believed to be in Israel.\n___\nLidman reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

      "text": "What to know about the Iranian nuclear sites that were hit by US strikes\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 U.S. forces have attacked three Iranian nuclear and military sites, further upping the stakes in the Israel-Iran war.\nPresident Donald Trump said the strikes, which he described as \u201cvery successful,\u201d had hit the Natanz, Fordo and Isfahan sites, with Fordo being the primary target. The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran confirmed there were attacks early Sunday at all three nuclear sites.\nIsrael launched a surprise barrage of attacks on sites in Iran on June 13, which Israeli officials said was necessary to head off what they claimed was an imminent threat that Iran would build nuclear bombs.\nThe U.S. military struck three sites in Iran, directly joining Israel\u2019s war aimed at decapitating the country\u2019s nuclear program in a risky gambit to weaken a longtime foe amid Tehran\u2019s threat of reprisals that could spark a wider regional conflict.\nIran, which has long insisted its nuclear program is peaceful, has retaliated with a series of missile and drone strikes in Israel, while Israel has continued to strike sites in Iran.\nThe U.S. and Iran had been in talks that could have resulted in the U.S. lifting some of its crushing economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran drastically limiting or ending its enrichment of uranium. Until Saturday, Washington had helped shoot down Iranian strikes on Israel but had not launched direct attacks on Iran.\nHere\u2019s a look at the sites Trump said the U.S. struck and their importance to Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\nNatanz enrichment facility\nIran\u2019s nuclear facility at Natanz, located some 220 kilometers (135 miles) southeast of Tehran, is the country\u2019s main enrichment site and had already been targeted by Israeli airstrikes. Uranium had been enriched to up to 60% purity at the site \u2014 a mildly radioactive level but a short step away from weapons grade \u2014 before Israel destroyed the aboveground part of the facility, according to the U.N.\u2019s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.\nAnother part of the facility on Iran\u2019s Central Plateau is underground to defend against potential airstrikes. It operates multiple cascades, or groups of centrifuges working together to more quickly enrich uranium. The IAEA has said it believes that most if not all of these centrifuges were destroyed by an Israeli strike that cut off power to the site.\nThe IAEA said those strikes caused contamination only at the site itself, not the surrounding area.\nIran also is burrowing into the K\u016bh-e Kolang Gaz L\u0101, or Pickax Mountain, which is just beyond Natanz\u2019s southern fencing. Natanz has been targeted by the Stuxnet virus, believed to be an Israeli and American creation, which destroyed Iranian centrifuges. Two separate attacks, attributed to Israel, also have struck the facility.\nFordo enrichment facility\nIran\u2019s nuclear facility at Fordo is located some 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Tehran. It also hosts centrifuge cascades, but isn\u2019t as big as Natanz. Its construction began at least in 2007, according to the IAEA, although Iran only informed the U.N. nuclear watchdog about the facility in 2009 after the U.S. and allied Western intelligence agencies became aware of its existence.\nBuried under a mountain and protected by anti-aircraft batteries, Fordo appears designed to withstand airstrikes. Military experts have said it could likely only be targeted by \u201cbunker buster\u201d bombs \u2014 a term for bombs that are designed to penetrate deep below the surface before exploding \u2014 such as the latest GBU-57 A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb in the American arsenal. The roughly 30,000 pound (13,600 kilogram) precision-guided bomb is designed to attack deeply buried and hardened bunkers and tunnels.\nThe U.S. has only configured and programed its B-2 Spirit stealth bomber to deliver that bomb, according to the Air Force. The B-2 is only flown by the Air Force, and is produced by Northrop Grumman, meaning that Washington would have to be involved in such an operation.\nIsfahan Nuclear Technology Center\nThe facility in Isfahan, some 350 kilometers (215 miles) southeast of Tehran, employs thousands of nuclear scientists. It also is home to three Chinese research reactors and laboratories associated with the country\u2019s atomic program.\nIsrael has struck buildings at the Isfahan nuclear site, among them a uranium conversion facility. The IAEA said there has been no sign of increased radiation at the site.\nOther nuclear sites\nIran has several other sites in its nuclear program that were not announced as targets in the U.S. strikes.\nIran\u2019s only commercial nuclear power plant is in Bushehr on the Persian Gulf, some 750 kilometers (465 miles) south of Tehran. Iran is building two other reactors like it at the site. Bushehr is fueled by uranium produced in Russia, not Iran, and is monitored by the IAEA.\nThe Arak heavy water reactor is 250 kilometers (155 miles) southwest of Tehran. Heavy water helps cool nuclear reactors, but it produces plutonium as a byproduct that can potentially be used in nuclear weapons. Iran had agreed under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers to redesign the facility to relieve proliferation concerns.\nThe Tehran Research Reactor is at the headquarters of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, the civilian body overseeing the country\u2019s atomic program. It initially required highly enriched uranium but was later retrofitted to use low-enriched uranium over proliferation concerns.\n___\nAssociated Press staff writer Abby Sewell in Beirut contributed to this report.\n___\nThe Associated Press receives support for nuclear security coverage from the Carnegie Corporation of New York and Outrider Foundation.

      "text": "European and Iranian diplomats meet in Istanbul as return of sanctions looms over nuclear deadlock\nEuropean and Iranian diplomats meet in Istanbul as return of sanctions looms over nuclear deadlock\nISTANBUL (AP) \u2014 Talks between Iranian and European diplomats in Istanbul ended Friday with the sides agreeing to meet again to seek to unpick the deadlock over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program.\nRepresentatives from Britain, France and Germany, known as the E3 nations, gathered at the Iranian Consulate building for the first talks since Iran\u2019s 12-day war with Israel in June, which involved U.S. bombers striking nuclear-related facilities.\nThe talks, which ended after four hours, centered on the possibility of reimposing sanctions on Iran that were lifted in 2015 in exchange for Iran accepting restrictions and monitoring of its nuclear program.\nIranian negotiator, Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi, said that the \u201cserious, frank and detailed\u201d meeting focused on the nuclear issue and the status of sanctions while agreeing to further discussions.\nSnapback mechanism\nThe E3 nations had earlier warned that sanctions could return under a process known as the \u201csnapback\u201d mechanism, which allows one of the Western parties to reimpose U.N. sanctions if Tehran doesn\u2019t comply with its requirements.\n\u201cBoth sides came to the meeting with specific ideas,\u201d Gharibabadi said in a social media post. \u201cIt was agreed that consultations on this matter will continue.\u201d\nAs the talks were ongoing, Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Esmail Baghaei, said that he hoped that the meeting would see the E3 nations reassess their \u201cprevious unconstructive attitude.\u201d\nEuropean leaders have said sanctions will resume by the end of August, if there is no progress on containing Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\nThe snapback mechanism \u201cremains on the table,\u201d a European diplomat said on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks,\n\u201cA possible delay in triggering snapback has been floated to the Iranians on the condition that there is credible diplomatic engagement by Iran, that they resume full cooperation with the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), and that they address concerns about their highly-enriched uranium stockpile,\u201d the diplomat said prior to Friday\u2019s negotiations.\nRebuilding trust\nTehran, meanwhile, has said that Washington, which withdrew from the 2015 deal during the first term of U.S. President Donald Trump, needs to rebuild faith in its role in negotiations.\nGharibabadi previously said that Iran\u2019s engagement was dependent on \u201cseveral key principles\u201d that included \u201crebuilding Iran\u2019s trust \u2014 as Iran has absolutely no trust in the United States.\u201d\nIn a social media post on Thursday, he also said that the talks shouldn\u2019t be used \u201cas a platform for hidden agendas such as military action.\u201d Gharibabadi insisted that Iran\u2019s right to enrich uranium \u201cin line with its legitimate needs\u201d be respected, and sanctions removed.\nIran has repeatedly threatened to leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which commits it to refrain from developing nuclear weapons, if sanctions return.\nEurope\u2019s role\nFriday\u2019s talks were held at the deputy ministerial level, with Iran sending Gharibabadi and a fellow deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-e Ravanchi. A similar meeting was held in Istanbul in May. The identity of the E3 representatives weren\u2019t immediately clear, but the European Union\u2019s deputy foreign policy commissioner was thought to be attending.\nThe U.K., France and Germany were signatories to the 2015 deal, alongside the U.S., Russia and China. When Washington withdrew in 2018, Trump insisted the agreement wasn\u2019t tough enough. Under the original deal, neither Russia nor China can veto reimposed sanctions.\nSince the Israeli and U.S. strikes on Iran, which saw American B-52 bombers hit three nuclear sites, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has accused the E3 of hypocrisy, saying that they failed to uphold their obligations while supporting Israel\u2019s attacks.\nUncertainty ahead\nAgainst the backdrop of the conflict, in which Iran responded with missile attacks on Israel and a strike on a U.S. base in Qatar, the road ahead remains uncertain.\nWhile European officials have said they want to avoid further conflict and are open to a negotiated solution, they have warned that time is running out.\nTehran maintains that it\u2019s open to diplomacy, though it recently suspended cooperation with the IAEA.\nA central concern for Western powers was highlighted when the IAEA reported in May that Iran\u2019s stockpile of uranium enriched to 60% \u2014 just below weapons-grade level \u2014 had grown to more than 400 kilograms (nearly 900 pounds).\nIn an interview with Al Jazeera that aired Wednesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said that Iran is prepared for another war and reiterated that its nuclear program will continue within the framework of international law, while adding that the country had no intention of pursuing nuclear weapons.\nRestarting inspections\nIAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi, meanwhile, said that no date had been set yet to restart inspections of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.\nSpeaking during a visit to Singapore on Friday, he warned that if inspectors \u201cdo not return soon, there will be a serious problem, because this is an international obligation of Iran.\u201d\nWhile he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by Tehran\u2019s readiness to engage with the IAEA, Grossi said that the sides needed \u201cto move from words to the reality.\u201d\n___\nStephanie Liechtenstein reported from Vienna.

  "argos_summary": "Iran's Foreign Minister is set to hold a conference call with European counterparts to discuss the potential reimposition of UN sanctions over its nuclear program, amid rising tensions following a recent conflict with Israel. The European nations have warned Iran of a 'snapback' mechanism that could restore sanctions if no satisfactory agreement is reached by the end of August. Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) continues to express concerns over Iran's uranium enrichment levels, which have reached near weapons-grade purity, and the lack of cooperation from Tehran following the recent military strikes on its nuclear sites.",
