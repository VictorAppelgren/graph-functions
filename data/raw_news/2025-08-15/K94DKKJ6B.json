  "content": "The highly anticipated new Premier League season kicked off at Anfield on Friday, with some supporters still wiping away tears from their eyes on a bright, sunny day. The emotions were on full display ahead of the opener between Liverpool and Bournemouth as fans paid tribute to late Reds star Diogo Jota, who tragically passed away along with his brother Andr\u00e9 Silva in a car crash earlier this summer.\n\nBanners, signs, balloons and scarves emblazoned with Jota\u2019s name, face, and No. 20 kit number were raised above heads by those in attendance when the collective sang out Liverpool\u2019s beloved anthem, \u201cYou\u2019ll Never Walk Alone.\u201d\n\nBroadcast of the match showed some fans teary-eyed while singing the traditional song. The club\u2019s star player, Mohamed Salah, looked upward while the anthem rang out through the ground.\n\nThe public address announcer called for a period of silence in memory of \u201cour forever 20\u201d and his brother, who died on July 3. Liverpool players stood side-by-side with their arms draped over one another\u2019s shoulders as fans displayed a collective mosaic sign in the stands that spelled out \u201cDJ 20\u201d and \u201cAS 30,\u201d shown in green, red and white colors \u2013 the colorway of the brothers\u2019 native Portugal flag.\n\nA black-and-white picture of the brothers was shown on video boards as some players bowed their heads during the moment.\n\nThe match got underway with the crowd full of enthusiasm. In the 20th minute, in reflection of Jota\u2019s number, fans around the ground stood, clapped in unison and chanted in honor of their much-loved forward.\n\nPlayers and coaches on both clubs were wearing black armbands.\n\nLiverpool fans also honored Jota at the annual Community Shield match last weekend.\n\nAs for the match itself, the reigning Premier League champions are looking the part despite a dramatically changed roster.\n\nLiverpool are favored to repeat as title-winners after bolstering the squad with multiple high-profile signings, including a trio from the Bundesliga: Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong from Bayern Leverkusen and Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. New defender Milos Kerkez started as well and faced his former side on Friday.\n\nEkitike will forever remember this day after he scored on his Anfield debut. In the 37th minute, the new striker powered through the Bournemouth backline to slot home, giving the home side a 1-0 lead. The Frenchman held his fingers to form the No. 20 \u2013 Jota\u2019s former number.\n\nThe Arne Slot-led club won the title in his first season in charge last year and will be looking to guide the Reds to their first repeat crown in over forty years.",

      "text": "The soccer world is in mourning following the death of Liverpool and Portugal star Diogo Jota in a car crash in Spain early on Thursday morning. He was 28.\nHis brother, Andr\u00e9 Silva \u2013 who was also a professional footballer \u2013 also died in the accident at the age of 25.\nJota married his long-term partner, Rute Cardoso, with whom he has three children, less than two weeks before the crash.\nThe incident occurred around 12:30 a.m. local time on the A-52 road in Zamora, northwestern Spain, and was caused by a \u201cburst tire while overtaking,\u201d the country\u2019s Guardia Civil said on Thursday. The vehicle that Jota and his brother were in left the road and subsequently caught fire, officials said. It is not known which brother was driving the car, which Spanish media reported was a Lamborghini.\nThe authorities identified the remains based on documents recovered at the scene of the accident, as well as the car\u2019s license plate, CNN Portugal reported. Further forensic testing at a morgue in Zamora confirmed the brothers\u2019 identities, according to CNN Portugal.\nFor investigation, the remains were moved to the nearby town of Puebla de Sanabria, a source close to the sub-delegate of the Spanish government in Zamora told CNN. The players\u2019 family was present in Puebla de Sanabria on Thursday afternoon to finalize the administrative requirements which allow the remains to be released and returned to Portugal, CNN Portugal reported.\nA source from the Government Sub-delegation in Zamora told PA that the crash is being investigated as \u201ca possible speeding incident.\u201d\nA wake for Jota and Andr\u00e9 Silva\u2019s family began on Friday morning at a church in the brothers\u2019 hometown of Gondomar, near Porto, the church told CNN. It added that the doors at the Igreja Martiz de Gondomar will open to the public on Friday afternoon.\nA funeral is set to take place on Saturday at 10 a.m. local time (5 a.m. ET), the church said.\nJota played an important role in the Liverpool team which lifted the Premier League trophy just over two months ago, equaling the English record of 20 top-flight titles. He featured in 26 of the club\u2019s 38 league games, scoring six goals and providing four assists. In total, he scored 65 goals across five years on Merseyside, also winning one FA Cup and two EFL Cups.\nJota was part of the Portugal national team which won the Nations League in June this year, having also won the competition in 2019.\nAndr\u00e9 Silva played for Futebol Clube de Penafiel in the Liga Portugal 2, the country\u2019s second division. In total, he scored 12 goals and contributed 10 assists in 105 matches at full and youth level throughout his career.\nTributes from the soccer world came flooding in throughout Thursday. Portuguese great Cristiano Ronaldo wrote that his compatriot\u2019s death \u201cdoes not make sense,\u201d while former Liverpool manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp, who signed Jota for the club in 2020, offered \u201cprayers, thoughts and power\u201d to Jota and Andr\u00e9 Silva\u2019s family.\nCurrent Liverpool manager Arne Slot also paid his respects, writing: \u201cWhen the time is right, we will celebrate Diogo Jota, we will remember his goals and we will sing his song. For the time being, we will remember him as a unique human being and mourn his loss. He will never be forgotten.\u201d\nTributes also came in from beyond soccer, from the likes of NBA star LeBron James and the United Kingdom\u2019s Prince William, who said he was \u201cdeeply saddened.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Alan Goodman and Duarte Mendonca contributed to reporting."

      "text": "Premier League champion Liverpool has announced the arrival of German midfielder Florian Wirtz \u2013 a statement signing in this summer transfer window.\nWirtz joins Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen in a deal worth up to \u00a3116 million (around $156 million), according to multiple UK media reports, and will only strengthen Arne Slot\u2019s title-winning side heading into next season.\nIt makes Wirtz the most expensive player in British soccer, his reported price tag potentially exceeding the \u00a3115 million ($146 million) that Chelsea paid for Ecuadorian midfielder Mois\u00e9s Caicedo.\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited to have a new adventure in front of me,\u201d Wirtz told Liverpoolfc.com.\n\u201cThis was also a big point of my thoughts: that I want to have something completely new, to go out of the Bundesliga and to join the Premier League.\n\u201cI will see how I can perform there. I hope I can do my best. I spoke also with some players who played there and they told me that it\u2019s perfect for me and every pitch is perfect, you can enjoy every game. I\u2019m really looking forward to playing my first game.\u201d\nAt the age of 22, Wirtz has already made a hugely impressive start to his career with club and country. After joining the Bayer Leverkusen youth setup, he was soon elevated to the first team aged 17 years and 15 days, becoming the club\u2019s then-youngest player to feature in the Bundesliga.\nMore records would follow, with Wirtz becoming the league\u2019s youngest goalscorer when he netted in a defeat against Bayern Munich in 2020, a record that has since been passed by Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Youssoufa Moukoko.\nA torn ACL three years ago halted the playmaker\u2019s progress and put him out of action for 10 months, but Wirtz bided his time on the sidelines and went on to play a starring role in Leverkusen\u2019s astonishing 2023-24 season, winning the German Cup and a first-ever league title.\nOnly a defeat against Atalanta in the Europa League final denied Leverkusen a famous treble, putting an end to a 51-game unbeaten run.\nWirtz had 18 goals and 20 assists in all competitions that season, then went on to notch 16 goals \u2013 six of which came in the Champions League \u2013 and 15 assists in 45 games last year. In that time, the midfielder established himself as one of the most sought-after players in Europe.\nUnderstandably, Wirtz has been heaped with praise. Barcelona and former German national team manager Hansi Flick called him \u201cthe full package,\u201d while former Leverkusen striker Patrick Helmes went as far as to label him \u201cprobably the best midfielder in the world.\u201d\nAlready an established member of the German national team, Wirtz missed out on playing at the 2022 World Cup because of his ACL injury, but did take part in all five of his country\u2019s games at last year\u2019s European Championships.\nTogether with Bayern Munich\u2019s Jamal Musiala, he looks destined to be at the heart of Germany\u2019s attack for years to come.\n\u201cFlorian is a more direct player (than Musiala), a strategic playmaker,\u201d said former Germany coach Joachim L\u00f6w. \u201cHe constantly has his head up, always looking for his teammates, and has the vision to play that decisive final pass.\u201d\nAt Liverpool, Wirtz will be part of a talented midfield featuring Alexis Mac Allister \u2013 a World Cup winner with Argentina \u2013 Dominik Szoboszlai and Ryan Gravenberch, as well as linking up with former Leverkusen teammate Jeremie Frimpong, who the Reds also signed last month.\nOn top of prolific goalscorer Mohamed Salah signing a new contract with the club at the end of last season, Wirtz\u2019s arrival gives Slot an array of attacking options next season."

      "text": "Liverpool paid an emotional tribute to its late forward Diogo Jota on Sunday in the club\u2019s first competitive match since his death in July, as Jeremie Frimpong scored a bizarre goal in the 20th minute of the game, just as fans were applauding in memory of Jota, who wore the number 20 on his jersey.\nThe Reds eventually lost their Community Shield clash against Crystal Palace on penalties at Wembley Stadium on a day that had both planned and seemingly otherworldly tributes to Jota and his younger brother, Andr\u00e9 Silva, who both died in a car crash in July.\nAhead of the match, Liverpool intended to observe a minute\u2019s silence in memory of the two brothers who died on July 3 after their car came off the road following a burst tire and subsequently went up in flames in the early hours of the morning.\nAs the players lined up, though, a few boos and shouts rang out from the otherwise quiet crowd meaning that the moment was cut short.\nBefore the game too, Liverpool icon Ian Rush, Crystal Palace co-owner Steve Parish and FA chair Debbie Hewitt laid wreaths beside the pitch while Liverpool fans sang the club\u2019s anthem \u201cYou\u2019ll Never Walk Alone.\u201d\nBut it was during the 20th minute, as fans were applauding to remember Jota, that the most fitting tribute came. Frimpong collected Dominik Szoboszlai\u2019s floated pass downfield on the right hand side of the box, jagged in past the Palace defense and chipped the ball towards the far post, over the outstretched hands of goalkeeper Dean Henderson and into the net to score 20 minutes and 20 seconds into the game.\nThat gave Liverpool a 2-1 lead after Palace had equalized following Hugo Ekitik\u00e9\u2019s goal in the fourth minute. Palace equalized again in the 77th minute through Ismaila Sarr and the match ended 2-2, meaning that penalties would decide the winner of this year\u2019s Community Shield.\nThe penalty kicks lacked the quality that was on display throughout the 90 minutes with Crystal Palace eventually taking the shootout 3-2.\nPalace goalkeeper Dean Henderson was the star of the shootout for the Eagles and saved two of the Liverpool spot kicks, with Mohamed Salah also blazing over from 12 yards.\nThroughout its preseason, Liverpool has remembered Jota who, at 28, was still in the prime of his career and a key player for the Reds.\nThe club has retired his number 20 jersey across all its teams and laid wreaths in memory of him during its first preseason game against Preston North End last month."

      "text": "Anfield stadium announcer George Sephton can count on one hand the number of Liverpool home games he has missed since his first day on the job on August 14, 1971.\nDuring his first two decades in front of the mic, Sephton got used to announcing Liverpool as the champion of England \u2013 the club won a remarkable 11 First Division titles between 1973 and 1990 to add to the seven it had already won up to that point.\nHad you told him then that it would be another 30 years before he could call the Reds champions of England again, you might have noted a hint of surprise in his response.\n\u201cI\u2019d have said you were crackers!\u201d he laughs in an interview with CNN Sports. \u201cAfter the triumph in 1990, the following season we didn\u2019t get anywhere. And then it goes on each season and you\u2019re thinking, \u2018It can\u2019t go on much longer. It can\u2019t go on. It just can\u2019t go on.\u2019\n\u201cAnd it went on\u2026\u201d\nBittersweet victory\nHad you told him the manner in which Liverpool would finally claim its 19th league title, that surprise would have turned to disbelief.\nIn March 2020, with the Reds 25 points clear at the top of the table under legendary manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp, they looked almost certain to become English champions for the first time since the First Division was rebranded as the Premier League. But then Covid-19 struck, the world went into lockdown and the league was halted.\nIt would resume three months later, but not as fans knew it. Sephton, reinstated in his box in one corner of Anfield, played music and made announcements, but did so to an empty stadium. With English soccer remaining behind closed doors and pubs still closed, fans watched from their homes as the players got their hands on the trophy that had eluded Liverpool for so long.\n\u201cIt was spooky. I remember I came home from the last game when we picked up the trophy at Anfield behind closed doors,\u201d Sephton recalls.\n\u201cI\u2019d just been to a dinner where Peter Moore, who was CEO at the time, he stood up and said that Liverpool had a billion followers worldwide. Then on that night, there were 600 people inside Anfield, including all the Sky TV crew and whatever.\n\u201cI was so privileged to be there, but it was so disappointing for the rest of the Anfield faithful \u2013 people who have been coming for years and couldn\u2019t get in to see it. It was awful.\u201d\nAmong that Anfield faithful is Neil Atkinson, host and CEO of The Anfield Wrap.\n\u201cOf course, something was lost, and the whole situation is covered with sadness,\u201d he tells CNN. \u201cPeople made life decisions around wanting to be in Liverpool for the moment that Liverpool won the league. And then, effectively, it wasn\u2019t the same.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t what it was meant to be.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not to say that Liverpool supporters spent that moment feeling sorry for themselves.\n\u201cI think that everyone made the best of the circumstance that they found themselves in,\u201d says Atkinson, who spent the night with a small group of friends, social distancing \u201con the beach, drinking, setting off fireworks and listening to \u2018Nessun Dorma,\u2019\u201d an aria from Giacomo Puccini\u2019s opera Turandot, most famously sung by Luciano Pavarotti.\n\u201cI\u2019ll remember that for the rest of my life in a really weird way,\u201d he adds. \u201cI hope that Liverpool win the next 10 league titles, and we\u2019ll never celebrate any of them like that.\u201d\nChris Pajak, co-founder of fan channel The Redmen TV, remembers hearing the news that the Premier League would be put on hold.\n\u201cWe never really knew if it would start again,\u201d he tells CNN Sports. \u201cWere we ever going to win the Premier League? Were we that cursed that we\u2019d never be able to lift it?\u201d\nWhen the league did resume, platforms like The Redmen TV and The Anfield Wrap became one of the only ways for supporters to experience the collective spirit that so many craved during one of the biggest moments in the club\u2019s history. Pajak formed a Covid support bubble with best friend and fellow co-founder Paul Machin, and their live watchalongs garnered 25,000 viewers at a time.\n\u201cI got a different experience to probably a lot of other fans because I felt that togetherness,\u201d Pajak reflects. \u201cBut I also felt a little bit hollow because we didn\u2019t get to celebrate it as fans.\u201d\nIt was a hollowness that many believe has extended into seasons since.\n\u201cI think it has affected fans, certainly. I think we kind of felt cheated, to be honest,\u201d says Pajak. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get a parade for a start. We didn\u2019t get to congregate en masse and show our love for the side, the squad and everyone who works behind the scenes.\n\u201cAnd I think a lot of people felt a little bit jaded by that, and that may have been a bit of a hangover into the next few years as well.\u201d\nThe following season would prove difficult at times. With stadiums still closed to supporters, an injury-ridden Liverpool would fall to a club-record six straight losses at home between January and March 2021. Sephton believes the absence of fans was felt more keenly at Anfield than anywhere else in the country.\n\u201cLiverpool have got the best supporters in the business, bar none,\u201d he says. \u201cSo the fact that we didn\u2019t have any supporters in the place meant that we lost more than all the other clubs in terms of background atmosphere.\u201d\nAtkinson is on the same page. \u201cSome players suited empty stadia, some players didn\u2019t suit empty stadia,\u201d he says. \u201cI would argue \u2013 because, of course I would, but I think there\u2019s a fair body of evidence \u2013 that J\u00fcrgen Klopp had done an excellent job of building a squad of footballers who enjoyed emotional football.\u201d\nFans were slowly allowed back into stadiums over the course of that 2020-21 season, and Liverpool was far from unsuccessful in the years that followed, winning an FA Cup and two EFL Cups as well as coming to within two games of an unprecedented quadruple in 2022.\nBut, by the time Klopp departed in May 2024, there was a nagging feeling among some supporters that arguably the greatest team in the club\u2019s history had not managed to win \u2013 or celebrate \u2013 as much as it should have done.\nAfter nearly nine years with its iconic manager, the club would now enter a new chapter under relative unknown Arne Slot.\nBig shoes to fill\nThe consensus among Sephton, Atkinson and Pajak is that the team Slot inherited cannot quite compare to the one Klopp had in 2019-20. There is the sense that this is a squad at the start of its journey, rather than one which had been on the verge of a league title for at least a year.\nPreseason predictions from journalists and pundits reflected that sentiment, with very few forecasting Liverpool to finish above Manchester City or Arsenal.\nIn many ways, it is easy to see why there was a degree of uncertainty around Slot. Winning the league in your first season as a Premier League manager is, by all accounts, really hard. Only four managers prior to Slot \u2013 Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti, Manuel Pellegrini and Antonio Conte \u2013 have ever managed to achieve the feat.\nAnd yet, with Manchester City and Arsenal both suffering disappointing seasons in the league, no one has been able to get close to Liverpool this season.\n\u201cIt is J\u00fcrgen\u2019s squad, but Slot\u2019s got more out of J\u00fcrgen\u2019s squad than J\u00fcrgen could, and I didn\u2019t think that would be possible at the end of the season last year,\u201d says Pajak.\nSephton too has been \u201cpleasantly surprised\u201d by what he has seen from the Reds over the past nine months. But Atkinson sees it differently.\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised with Liverpool\u2019s points total, after this many games. I am surprised at everyone else\u2019s,\u201d he says.\n\u201cFor me, the players are everything, so if Arne Slot had done a reasonable job, I\u2019d have expected them to get around 82 again (as the team managed in 2023-24). But if Arne Slot had done a very good job, which he has, then I think where Liverpool are isn\u2019t unreasonable.\u201d\nClosure\nIn many ways, Liverpool is back where it was five years ago \u2013 it has again strolled to a league title powered by the likes of Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk.\nAnd yet, for most supporters, the conclusion to this season feels like something else entirely.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be completely different because there\u2019ll be so many people who\u2019ve never seen it before, never seen us win it,\u201d says Sephton, speaking ahead of Sunday\u2019s emphatic 5-1 victory against Tottenham which sealed the title with flair.\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be lots of people who missed out in 2020, and for them, it\u2019ll be some sort of closure.\u201d\nPajak shares the sense that Liverpool supporters are almost celebrating two league titles at once.\n\u201cWhen it did happen (last time), it wasn\u2019t like that incredible release of emotion I think I expected it to be. I almost feel like, thinking about the present day, that actually this might give us that release after all these years,\u201d he explains.\n\u201cI genuinely can\u2019t wait for the last game of the season where we get to do a true lap of appreciation, with the players going around lifting the trophy and that. I think at that point you\u2019ll be thinking about people who have been on the journey with you, some people who may have passed who won\u2019t get to have seen them lift the Premier League,\u201d Pajak adds.\n\u201cSo yeah, I\u2019m gonna be a mess by the sounds of it!\u201d\nFor Atkinson, it isn\u2019t so much about the moment the title is confirmed, or even the moment van Dijk lifts the trophy.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get that moment, and that moment will be great,\u201d he tells CNN ahead of the win against Tottenham. \u201cBut it\u2019s more that sense of communal, peaceful satisfaction. That was what we lost \u2013 that long summer of meeting up, talking about it.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve not only won the league for one day,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe winning of the league is the same (as 2019-20). The having won the league will be completely different. And that\u2019s the thing I\u2019m most excited about.\u201d\nThe memories of 2020 \u2013 while they are tangled up with all the uncertainty and pain and \u2018what-ifs\u2019 of the pandemic \u2013 are not bad memories. The giddy joy of live watchalongs and \u201cNessun Dorma\u201d remains mostly intact.\nBut there\u2019s nothing quite like an entire city celebrating together."

Fans and players observed a minute\u2019s silence, displayed banners and sang \u201cYou\u2019ll Never Walk Alone,\u201d while new signing Hugo Ekitike scored the only goal, holding up Jota\u2019s former No.\u202f20 number.  The club also celebrated Jota\u2019s legacy in the Community Shield, where a 20\u2011minute, 20\u2011second goal by Jeremie Frimpong echoed the tribute.  Amid the mourning, Liverpool\u2019s new squad\u2014highlighted by the record signing of Florian Wirtz\u2014continues to build on a title\u2011winning season under manager Arne Slot, aiming for a repeat crown while honoring the memory of a beloved teammate.",
