  "description": "XTRA:NFN 1 Year Share Price vs Fair Value Explore NFON's Fair Values from the Community and select yours It is hard to...",
  "content": "Explore NFON's Fair Values from the Community and select yours\n\n\n\nIt is hard to get excited after looking at NFON's (ETR:NFN) recent performance, when its stock has declined 8.6% over the past month. However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. In this article, we decided to focus on NFON's ROE.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for NFON is:\n\n0.8% = \u20ac388k \u00f7 \u20ac49m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2025).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each \u20ac1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made \u20ac0.01 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nIt is hard to argue that NFON's ROE is much good in and of itself. Not just that, even compared to the industry average of 7.2%, the company's ROE is entirely unremarkable. In spite of this, NFON was able to grow its net income considerably, at a rate of 21% in the last five years. Therefore, there could be other reasons behind this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.\n\nWe then compared NFON's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 15% in the same 5-year period.\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about NFON's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.",

The company's Return on Equity (ROE) stands at a low 0.8%, significantly below the industry average of 7.2%. However, NFON's efficient management and low payout ratio may contribute to its earnings growth potential, even as it underperforms compared to the broader telecom market.",
