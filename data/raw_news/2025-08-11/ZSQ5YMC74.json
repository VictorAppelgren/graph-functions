  "title": "Downderry villagers lose battle to buy former chapel",
  "description": "The former Methodist chapel has been the centre of life in the village near Looe for 10 years.",
  "content": "Villagers in Downderry in Cornwall have had a bid to buy a chapel for community use rejected and face having to vacate the premises. The building has not been used for worship for more than a decade and locals had transformed it into a hub, The Zone, with 16 groups offering a variety of activities. The community raised \u00a3200,000 to buy it but its owners said they wanted to sell it on the open market for the highest price. The Methodist Circuit said: \"The local trustees are charity trustees and are under a legal obligation to act in accordance with charity law and the constitution of the Methodist Church... this means obtaining the best terms and best price when disposing of charity property.\"\n\nAdrian Kemp, chairman of the Zone Steering Group, said meetings with the Methodist circuit and community members were \"very congenial\" for two years until \"something changed\" in April, which \"came as quite a surprise\". He said: \"However, we believe somebody is advising them it is worth a lot more potentially for a building site rather than community use, which is what the planning permission is for at the moment.\" The Methodist Circuit served notices to quit by 12 August. Some groups had been offered space at St Nicolas Church, others the village hall; but time slots were difficult and some groups had wound up, community leaders said. \"It's devastating,\" said Michelle Davies, who is also on the committee. \"It's such a vital part of our village for all ages, from birth all the way up through; so not having that place to come and meet people and be sociable it will make the village very lonely.\"\n\nSue Dobinson was a member of many groups at the Zone, including pilates, yoga and the Women's Institute. She said: \"Hundreds of people use this building. If it goes on the open market to the highest bidder, maybe one family will be able to use it. \"It doesn't make sense. It's so sad.\" Barrister Hugo deRijke said Zone supporters were hoping to meet chapel trustees again. He said the trustees \"were singing the praises of The Zone not so long ago\" before the \"very odd\" U-turn. He said: \"They have not explained their sudden change of heart and mind about this. \"I've been looking into the due process and whether the Methodist Church has acted in good faith, which is one of its policies.\".\n\nThe Reverend Jonathan Budd, superintendent of South East Cornwall Methodist Circuit said the decision to sell was \"a difficult one and is only made by the local trustees as a last resort when there is no continuing Methodist purpose continuing at the premises\". \"Whilst we understand the local frustrations, as charity trustees, the local trustees are acting within the law and in accordance with legal obligations placed upon them,\" he said.",

      "text": "Campaign to save church spire from collapse\n- Published\nA campaign has been launched to prevent the collapse of a historic church spire built as a navigation point.\nThe stone exterior of the tower of St Gerrans Church in Cornwall is so badly eroded water has to be collected in buckets whenever it rains. Now the woodwork that holds the spire together is also under threat.\nFundraising group Save Our Spire has raised more than \u00a3151,000 but needs another \u00a366,000 so urgent work can be carried out before winter storms arrive.\nGroup member James Leggate said: \"The tower was built and 100 years later the spire was added at the request of local fishermen - it's still a navigation point on Admiralty Charts.\"\nResidents of Portscatho and Gerrans packed a meeting called to discuss the threat to the spire and the need to find \u00a366,000 to save it.\nNev Meek, president of The Federation of Old Cornwall Societies, said churches were unique in their value to the community.\n\"There's something about a church that is really important to communities, community cohesion and their identity,\" he said.\n\"It really seems to have an impact on the community that no other building has.\n\"The spire on Gerrans church dates from the 15th Century and they're relatively unusual on Cornish churches. So the fact that it's got this lovely spire is really special for us here in Gerrans.\"\nMr Meek said he was also passionate about saving the spire for personal reasons.\n\"Not only do I have an interest in making sure our tangible cultural heritage is protected and preserved but I have a personal involvement.\n\"It's the church where I was baptised, where my mother was baptised and buried. There are countless generations of my family that are buried in the churchyard, watched over by the steeple and the church,\" he said\nVillage resident Robin Edwards said: \"Ultimately the spire on the church is falling down, it's in a bad state of repair.\n\"There's been a fantastic team that have been fundraising for at least a year but they've come up with a shortfall.\n\"They've got some grants and lottery money but ultimately we're short by about \u00a366,000.\"\nMr Edwards said the spire was an important landmark.\n\"You can see it (the spire) from miles around, it's a very dominant, very important piece of architecture.\n\"It's a piece of history and a focal point of the two villages of Gerrans and Portscatho.\n\"It falls on all of us as custodians of our villages and members of the community to do what we can, if we don't act we could lose this wonderful piece of architecture and history, \" he said.\n- Published16 July\n- Published27 July\n- Published1 July\nFollow BBC Cornwall on X, external, Facebook, external and Instagram, external.
