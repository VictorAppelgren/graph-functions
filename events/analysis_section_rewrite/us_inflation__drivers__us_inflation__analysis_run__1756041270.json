      "feedback": "Overall: the draft anchors the thesis well in a durable Regime A for AI/cloud (Microsoft/Shopify), uses explicit metric anchors (Azure revenue and Shopify GMV/revenue/margin), and ties macro easing, policy signals, and tariff dynamics into a plausible transmission to valuation. However, to reach world-class quality, tighten the causal chain, increase quantified rigor, and deliver a clean cross‑topic synthesis with decisive triggers. Actionable edits in one compact paragraph: (1) Build a formal first‑principles transmission from platform breadth to GMV growth to revenue, margin expansion, and cash flow, with a concise, equation-like step-by-step mapping and explicit leverage from policy-financing conditions; (2) anchor every claim to numbers from the sources and show how Shopify’s +27% GMV and +29% revenue (Q2’25 metrics) feed operating income and FCF, removing vagueness like “velocity slice” and linking to a margin path; (3) deliver a true cross‑topic synthesis by weaving macro policy (GX057ADL7), flows/positioning (0G3A676BP; 48JXC9VDP), and valuation implications into one coherent narrative, plus quantify how a mid‑4% 10‑year yield and a ~25–50 bp September Fed cut would alter discount rates; (4) replace broad statements with quantified sensitivities and scenarios drawn strictly from the sources (e.g., oil oversupply by IEA +2.5 mbpd in 2025 from J99EM2TPZ; tariff pause 90 days from RHXDOHQQX; EU tariff framework from RHFWI02JT), and provide a bounded impact on WACC/NPV; (5) sharpen the watch-list with explicit deciders and thresholds (Shopify GMV/revenue print momentum, actual Fed/yield moves, tariff progress or escalation, and oil-price/inflation signals) and state clear invalidation triggers; (6) reconcile potential conflicts (oil-supply vs inflation, tariff pauses vs negotiation risk) by assigning probability weights or scenarios; (7) audit citations so every factual claim is sourced and remove stray tokens (e.g., fix or discard QF/undercited fragments); (8) tighten format to one core paragraph plus a concise, numeric watch-list, ensuring alignment with SECTION FOCUS (macro/policy/flows/valuation) and preserving a disciplined, non-plagiarized tone.",
