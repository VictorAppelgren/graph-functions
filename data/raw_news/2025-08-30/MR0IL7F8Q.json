  "description": "As summer nears its end, here's a look at when fall colors are expected to begin in Michigan.",
  "content": "Michigan's parks and backroads fill up each fall with people looking for the most spectacular leaf colors. If you're considering a scenic drive, now may be the time to plan; fall colors aren't far away.\n\nA foliage color forecast map available at Explore Fall predicts leaves will begin changing colors in mid-September in the western Upper Peninsula, with parts of the UP reaching peak fall colors by mid-October. The Lower Peninsula will see peak colors by late October.\n\nAmong Michigan's many backroads, travelers consider M-22 along Lake Michigan's shoreline among the best. The road winds along the lake and through numerous stands of colorful hardwoods.\n\nPure Michigan says numerous state parks offer colorful ways to enjoy the outdoors. Tahquamenon Falls State Park is among the most popular with UP trees bracketing the largest waterfall in the state.\n\nPorcupine Mountains State Park features 60,000 acres of woodlands, with numerous elevated vantage points for hikers to take in the colors.\n\nCopper Peak, north of Ironwood in western UP, offers an unparalleled view from the top of an 800-foot hill and an 18-story ski jump. The site boasts that visitors can see three states and Canada on a clear day.\n\nHere's what to know about fall colors in Michigan.\n\nWhen will fall colors begin in Michigan?\n\nIn Michigan, tree leaves begin changing colors soon, starting in the UP by Sept. 13, a map from Explore Fall shows.\n\nThe change will move south throughout the Lower Peninsula, with moderate color starting in the UP by Sept. 27, the map predicts. High and peak colors will start appearing in the western UP by Oct. 6.\n\nBy later October, the UP will be mostly past peak colors, with peak fall colors spreading throughout the Lower Peninsula, according to the website. Parts of the southern Lower Peninsula will still be approaching peak colors.\n\nHow will colors vary by tree types?\n\nWhen colors appear, Michigan's diverse tree varieties each have their own color patterns, according to Michigan State University Extension.\n\nIn the Upper Peninsula and northern Lower Peninsula, maple trees feature orange and red leaves, while quaking aspen and larch trees have yellow leaves. Sugar maples turn bright red, and red maples change from vivid red to orange to bright yellow.\n\nRed oaks, present across the state, have subtle red leaves, while trees in the white oak group, with several in southern Michigan, feature yellow or dusty red leaves. Sassafras, present in southern Michigan, varies from yellow to deep red in the fall and can have three-lobed or mitten-shaped leaves.\n\nHickories, common in southern Michigan, can feature yellow leaves in the fall, the most common variety in the state being shagbark hickory. Larch trees feature needles, which turn bright yellow in the fall before shedding. Eastern larch, or tamarack, is a larch variety found in wetter parts of Michigan.\n\nWhen does fall start in 2025?\n\nThe fall equinox \u2014 the end of summer and start of fall 2025 \u2014 takes place at 2:19 p.m. Sept. 22, 2025, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.",

      "text": "Is Labor Day the end of summer? When DST ends, fall starts in Michigan\nAs parents and kids prepare to head back to school, many may be wondering when summer officially ends and fall begins in Michigan.\nThe good news is we still have a number of weeks of summer left. The bad news is days are already getting shorter.\nAs we head toward mid-August, here's what to know about Daylight Saving Time and when summer ends.\nWhen will summer 2025 end?\nThe fall equinox \u2014 the end of summer and start of fall 2025 \u2014 takes place at 2:19 p.m. Sept. 22, 2025, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.\nAre there two beginnings to fall?\nThe autumnal equinox represents the astronomical start of fall, according to AccuWeather.\nMeanwhile, meteorological seasons are broken into groups of three months. Meteorological fall lasts for 91 days every year, starting on Sept. 1 and lasting through Nov. 30.\n- Meteorological spring is March, April and May.\n- Meteorological summer is June, July and August.\n- Meteorological fall is September, October and November.\n- Meteorological winter is December, January and February.\nWhat is Daylight Saving Time?\nDaylight Saving Time, often called daylight savings time, is when \"daylight\" begins an hour later in the morning and lasts an hour longer in the evening, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\nThe clock change allows the hour of daylight to stay coordinated with the time most people are active outside. Daylight saving time is supposed to save energy, since during the warmer months the majority of people will be outside and not home, which saves energy.\nWhen does DST end in 2025?\nDaylight Saving Time ends on Nov. 2, the first Sunday of November.\nIs it daylight saving or daylight savings?\nWhile it is often referred to as Daylight Savings Time, Daylight Saving Time without the \"s\" at the end is the correct term.\nThe Detroit Free Press and Lansing State Journal contributed.\nContact Jenna Prestininzi: jprestininzi@freepress.com."

      "text": "Michigan's fall colors are hitting peak: What to know, best scenic drives\nFall colors have spread across Michigan, perfect for a scenic drive through the state's natural beauty. Reds, yellows and oranges are in bloom, starting in the Upper Peninsula and now here in metro Detroit.\nConsider hitting the road for an up-close view of fall colors, with picturesque routes across metro Detroit. If you're farther north, check out drives like the scenic Tunnel of Trees, a 50-mile route in the northwestern lower peninsula.\nYou can also visit state parks, take a riverboat or helicopter tour, visit a local apple orchard or cider mill, and more to enjoy the vibrant colors this fall. A full range of fall travel ideas in the state can also be found online from Pure Michigan.\nMichigan fall color forecast, week of Oct. 21\nA foliage predictor map from SmokyMountains.com shows that peak fall colors have arrived here in Michigan. All of Michigan should be past peak foliage during the week of Oct. 28, according to the map.\nAnother map from Explore Fall, a fall foliage tracking website, predicts much of the Upper Peninsula past peak fall colors this week, with peak fall colors spreading south across most of the Lower Peninsula. Part of the southern Lower Peninsula, including metro Detroit, are between moderate and high fall colors, according to the map.\nWhen will Michigan winter begin? Here's what NOAA, AccuWeather, Old Farmer's Almanac say\nMichigan trees and fall colors\nWith fall colors in full effect, Michigan's diverse tree varieties have their own color patterns, according to Michigan State University.\nIn the Upper Peninsula and northern Lower Peninsula, maple trees feature orange and red leaves, while quaking aspen and larch trees have yellow leaves.

      "text": "Introducing Michigan\u2019s fall color lineup\nKnowing which leaves are turning can add to your enjoyment of fall color season.\nAn old adage in baseball is, \u201cYou can\u2019t tell the players without a scorecard.\u201d Knowing who is on the field at each position helps to make baseball games more enjoyable. The same applies to Michigan fall color; knowing which trees are contributing to our fall display adds to our enjoyment of the season. As baseball gears up for its Fall Classic, Michigan State University Extension presents a short guide to the trees that lead the fall color team in Michigan.\nRegional roundup\nMichigan includes a range of diverse forest types that reflect the state\u2019s varied climate and geology. These forest types include a variety of species that have distinctive fall color patterns. In the Upper Peninsula and northern Lower Peninsula, quaking aspen or larch provide vast areas of yellow while maples add splashes of orange and red.\nThe Upper Peninsula usually kicks off Michigan\u2019s fall color in mid- to late September. In the northern Lower Peninsula, fall color typically peaks in early to mid-October (slightly later near the lakeshores). Fall color in northern Lower Michigan is dominated by maples, especially red and sugar maples. In parts of the state where conifers dominate, the color of scattered hardwoods is often accentuated against the deep evergreen background. Southern Michigan provides the greatest assortment of tree types in the state, as northern hardwood trees overlap with central and southern hardwoods such as sassafras, hickories and black gum, providing a mosaic of autumn colors that often lasts into late October.\nThe starting lineup: Common native trees with outstanding fall color\nSugar maple (Acer saccharum). When Michiganders think of fall color, chances are sugar maples are the first trees that come to mind. Sugar maples occur throughout the state but are most common in the Northern hardwood forest type and often provide our most spectacular red fall color. They are large trees with large, palmately lobed leaves (think of the maple leaf on the Canadian flag).\nRed maple (Acer rubrum). Like sugar maples, red maples are found throughout the state but on a wider variety of sites, including mixed upland hardwoods and swamp hardwoods. Red maples have relatively small, three-lobed leaves and can provide colors ranging from vivid red to orange to bright yellow. Red maples are widely planted as landscape trees in large part due to their fall color, which is reflected in the names of common cultivars such as \u2018October glory\u2019 and \u2018Red sunset\u2019.\nAspen. Both quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) and bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata) occur throughout Michigan, but are most common in the aspen forest type in northern Michigan. Aspen trees, sometimes referred to as \u201cpopple,\u201d provide bright yellow fall color. Trees are characterized by light gray bark and leaves that flutter or \u201cquake\u201d in the wind.\nOaks are components of several of hardwood forest types mentioned above and also oak-hickory forests. Red oak (Quercus rubra) is found throughout Michigan and often provides subtle, russet red fall color, in contrast to the brighter colors of maples. Red oaks are characterized by lobed leaves with pointed leaf tips. Several trees in the white oak group (oaks with leaves with rounded leaf tips) are found in southern Michigan including white oak (Quercus alba), swamp white oak (Quercus bicolor) and bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa). Trees in the white oak group may produce yellow or dusty red fall color.\nSassafras (Sassafras albidum) is found throughout southern Lower Michigan. They are easily identified by their leaves, which are sometimes three-lobed or mitten-shaped. Sassafras fall color ranges from yellow to deep red.\nHickories are common throughout southern Lower Michigan, often producing patches of yellow along roadsides and trails in agricultural regions of the state. Shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), easily identified by its peeling bark, is the most common hickory in the state. Other hickories in southern Michigan include bitternut hickory (Carya cordiformis) and pignut hickory (Carya glabra).\nLarch. Eastern larch or tamarack (Larix laricina) occurs primarily in wetter areas throughout the state. Larch trees are the only native conifers in Michigan that shed all their needles each fall. Larch needles turn bright yellow in the fall before they shed.\nUtility players: Less common native trees and landscape trees with outstanding fall color\nBlackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), also referred to as tupelo, is a small tree that is native to southern Lower Michigan. It is not common in Michigan, but provides spectacular red fall color and is used in landscaping.\nHoneylocust (Gleditisia triacanthos). The northern extent of the native range of honeylocust extends just to the southernmost tier counties in Michigan, however the tree is widely planted as an ornamental throughout the state. Honeylocusts are tough and durable trees that produce bright yellow fall color.\nGinkgos (Ginkgo biloba) are native to China. Even though they have broad, fan-shaped leaves, they are more closely related to conifers than to other broadleaved trees. Ginkgos produce bright yellow color in the fall and are often planted as street trees because of their tolerance of poor site conditions.\nBaldcypress (Taxodium distichum). Like larch, baldcypress is an example of a deciduous conifer (conifers that drop their needles in the fall). Baldcypress is native to the southern U.S. but grows well as a landscape tree in Lower Michigan, producing deep, russet red fall color before needle-shed.\nScarlet oak (Quercus coccinea) is a member of the red oak group with pointed leaf margins. It has a limited natural distribution in Lower Michigan, but has striking deep red fall color and is used as a landscape tree.\nSweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua). The native range of sweetgum extends into southern Indiana and Ohio, but it is sufficiently hardy to plant in southern Lower Michigan. It is sometimes mistaken for a maple because of its star-shaped leaves, but is easily distinguished by the hard sweetgum balls that can be a liability when planted near sidewalks. Fall colors range from yellow to deep red or purple.\nRedbud (Cercis canadensis) is a small, understory tree that has a limited native distribution in the southernmost counties in Michigan. Redbuds are most widely noted for their early spring show of pinkish-purple flowers, but they also provide a pop of bright yellow in the fall.\nTulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), or tulip tree, is readily identified by its large tulip-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. This fast-growing tree occurs in southern Lower Michigan and is also planted as a landscape tree.\nMore information\n- Silvics of North America by USDA Forest Service\n- Michigan Forest Communities: A field guide and references, MSU Extension bulletin E3000.\n- Trees of Michigan and the Upper Great Lakes by Norman Smith"

      "text": "When Is The First Day of Fall in 2025?\nThe first day of fall 2025 arrives with the fall equinox on Monday, September 22, 2025, 2:19 p.m.\nWhat Is The Fall Equinox?\nIn mid-September each year, we greet the fall season with the arrival of the fall equinox (otherwise known as the autumnal equinox). This is the moment when the Sun crosses the Equator, and those of us living in the Northern Hemisphere will begin to see more darkness than daylight. Regardless of whether it has been chilly for weeks or there are still balmy summer-like temperatures, this is the start of astronomical fall. (This is different from \u201cmeteorological fall,\u201d which begins on September 1st.)\nAt this point, the Earth\u2019s tilt moves away from its maximum lean toward the Sun. Its rays are aiming directly at the equator.\nThe autumnal (fall) equinox marks the turning point when darkness begins to win out over daylight. Essentially, our hours of daylight\u2014the period of time each day between sunrise and sunset\u2014have been growing slightly shorter each day since the summer solstice in June, which is the longest day of the year (at least in terms of daylight). Then, for the next three months, our hours of daylight will continue to grow shorter.\nAt the autumnal equinox, day and night are approximately equal in length. The name equinox comes from the Latin word aequus, meaning equal, and nox, meaning night. An equinox occurs twice a year (autumnal and vernal, or fall and spring).\nFun fact: Ancient astronomical texts suggest that the Sun aligned with the zodiac constellation Libra during the fall equinox. The \u201cscales\u201d represented a balance of day and night.\nRELATED: What\u2019s the difference between equinox and solstice?\nChanges Are Coming\nEverywhere you look, you can see the visible changes as nature prepares for winter: birds are flying south, temperatures are getting cooler, leaves are changing colors, and animals\u2019 coats are thickening, to name a few. But most significant is the change in daylight.\nIn mid-December, we experience the winter solstice, which will mark the shortest day of the year in terms of hours of daylight.\nAfter the winter solstice, the days will begin to grow longer again. It will take another three months until the vernal equinox (also called the spring equinox) for the periods of daylight and darkness to reach equilibrium once again.\nFrom the vernal equinox, the days will continue to grow longer, until we reach the summer solstice again, and the whole cycle begins anew!\nEquinox Traditions and Celebrations You Probably Didn\u2019t Know About\nAll over the world\u2014and throughout history\u2014you\u2019ll find a variety of traditions and celebrations to welcome the autumn season and harvest time (Oktoberfest, anyone?).
