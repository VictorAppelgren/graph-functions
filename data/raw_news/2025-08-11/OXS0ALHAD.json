  "description": "Apple Cinemas, the company that is being sued for alleged trademark infringement by Apple, today said that it is committed to defending its brand.  ...",
  "content": "Apple Cinemas, the company that is being sued for alleged trademark infringement by Apple, today said that it is committed to defending its brand.\n\nWe are committed to defending our brand, our history, and our continued right to operate as Apple Cinemas--an identity that is and has always been clearly distinct and fully compliant with all applicable trademark laws. Apple Cinemas is a long-established independent theater chain with no connection to Apple Inc. Our name reflects our geographic roots and has never been intended to suggest, or used to imply, any affiliation with their brand. Furthermore, claims of consumer confusion are unfounded. Apple Cinema's branding [sic] is clearly differentiated. We have responded reasonably and transparently to all legal communications regarding this matter and remain focused on growing our business and brand in good faith, as we have for over a decade.\n\nApple filed a lawsuit against Apple Cinemas last Friday. Apple's attorneys accused Apple Cinemas of \"knowingly and intentionally using the name Apple to sow confusion for its own benefit.\"\n\nApple Cinemas has operated since 2013, and the company claims that its name came from its first planned location at Apple Valley Mall in Rhode Island, but a movie theater never opened at that mall. Apple Cinemas operates 14 total locations, according to its website. One of those is in San Francisco, California, while the others are in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and New York.\n\nApple believes that Apple Cinemas is pursuing a nationwide expansion in the United States, including close to Apple's headquarters and retail stores.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Apple said that its \"repeated efforts to resolve the matter amicably\" were unsuccessful. Apple also cited comments from people who were under the impression that Apple Cinemas is owned by Apple. Apple has produced movies and TV shows distributed through its Apple TV+ service since 2019.\n\nApple Cinemas tried and failed to trademark both the Apple Cinemas name and the \"Apple Cinemas Experience,\" with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office denying the marks in 2024 because of potential confusion with Apple's prior trademark rights.\n\nApple is seeking monetary damages and an injunction to stop Apple Cinemas from using the name.",

      "text": "In a federal court in Massachusetts on Friday, Apple sued a small movie theater chain named Apple Cinemas over alleged trademark infringement.\n\"Apple Cinemas is knowingly and intentionally using the name Apple to sow confusion for its own benefit,\" alleged attorneys for Apple, in a complaint filed against all Apple Cinemas locations, and a Sand Media Corp Inc. company connected to the chain.\nEstablished in 2013, Apple Cinemas maintained a limited presence in the Northeastern U.S. until last month, when it opened a theater in San Francisco. The complaint alleges that Apple Cinemas is pursuing a nationwide expansion across the U.S., including in areas near Apple's headquarters and retail stores, leading Apple to take action.\n\"Faced with Defendants' plan to expand to 100 theaters nationwide, as well as widespread public confusion about Apple's involvement in the theaters, Apple has no alternative but to file this lawsuit to protect its brand and customers from deception,\" the complaint states.\nApple Cinemas currently has 14 locations, according to its website.\nApple's \"repeated efforts to resolve the matter amicably\" were unsuccessful. The lawsuit alleges that the companies behind Apple Cinemas have received multiple warnings that the name would cause confusion among consumers, but carried on. The complaint includes examples of some people who believed that Apple Cinemas was owned by Apple, in the comment sections of various online news articles and social media posts.\nThe first warning came from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which in October 2024 denied Sand Media Corp Inc.'s trademark applications for the \"Apple Cinemas\" and \"ACX \u2014 Apple Cinematic Experience\" marks, given they were likely to cause confusion with Apple's prior trademark rights, according to the complaint.\nApple has very strong trademark rights in connection with a wide range of goods and services, including movie distribution, its attorneys said.\nThe second warning came in December 2024, when Apple sent Sand Media Corps Inc. a cease and desist letter directly, according to the complaint. Apple's attorneys also communicated with the company by phone and in writing several times, but it knowingly pushed forward with its Apple Cinemas expansion plans, the complaint adds.\nAs for how the Apple Cinemas name came to be? According to the complaint, the founders of the chain claim they adopted the name due to a planned first location at the Apple Valley Mall in Rhode Island, but they never opened a location there.\nApple is seeking both an injunction and monetary damages."

      "text": "Should You Buy the Apple TV 4K?\nThe Apple TV is Apple's set-top box. The latest version of the Apple TV 4K came out in 2022, and it features the A15 Bionic chip, support for HDR10+, and a Siri Remote with a USB-C port for charging. Apple does not update the Apple TV frequently, releasing a new model around every three years.\nIntroduced in October 2022, the third-generation Apple TV 4K is the newest and only Apple TV in the company's lineup. It is three years old, and a new Apple TV is expected in late 2025. Given that a new model is on the horizon, now is not a good time to buy an Apple TV. If you can wait to make a purchase, we recommend holding off.\nApple TV 4K Feature Overview\nContents\nApple in October 2022 introduced an updated version of the Apple TV 4K, with the A15 Bionic chip and support for HDR10+. It comes alongside a revised Siri Remote with a USB-C port for charging.\nDesign wise, the third-generation Apple TV 4K continues to look like the prior-generation version, with a simple black box design that plugs into a television set over HDMI. It is thinner and lighter than the previous version, and no longer requires an internal fan for cooling.\nThe Apple TV 4K, as the name suggests, offers 4K resolution with support for high frame rate HDR content, including HDR10+ and Dolby Vision. To get the complete experience, it must be paired with a 4K TV and 4K content is also required.\nThere's a faster A15 Bionic chip inside the new Apple TV 4K that delivers up to 50 percent better CPU performance and 30 percent better GPU performance than the previous Apple TV 4K. The efficiency improvements of the chip also mean that the Apple TV uses up to 30 percent less power.\nThe Siri Remote was overhauled last year, adding a new design with a one-piece aluminum body. There's a clickpad control wheel with five-way navigation, with the clickpad also supporting touch gestures. The clickpad's outer ring supports a circular gesture that lets you jog through TV and movie content. The Siri Remote is larger than the prior version and it includes a dedicated power button that controls a TV's power. It also includes volume buttons, a mute button, an option for pausing and fast-forwarding, and a menu button. There's a side button for activating Siri. With the 2022 model, the remote now charges via USB-C instead of Lightning.\nThe Apple TV 4K is priced starting at $129 for the 64GB model with Wi-Fi only. For $149, customers can buy a 128GB model that adds a gigabit Ethernet port and support for the Thread mesh networking protocol to connect even more smart home accessories. The Siri Remote with USB-C is available separately for $59.\nThe Apple TV runs tvOS, an operating system designed specifically for televisions. tvOS 18 is the current publicly available version of tvOS. tvOS 18 brings a number of new features, including new screen savers, InSight for getting into on Apple TV+ shows, Spatial Audio for AirPlayed content, and more.\nNote: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here.\nHow to Buy\nThe Apple TV 4K can be ordered from the online Apple Store, Apple retail stores, and third-party retailers. The Apple TV 4K is priced at $129 for 64GB storage, or $149 for 128GB storage, an Ethernet port, and Thread support. Apple offers refurbished versions of the Apple TV at a $20 discount. The 2022 Siri Remote can also be purchased on a standalone basis for $59.\nReviews\nInitial reviews of the third-generation Apple TV 4K were mixed to positive, with most reviews noting that the latest version's improvements make for a small upgrade in day-to-day use.\nThe Apple TV 4K's performance improvements were somewhat noticeable to reviewers, particularly when switching apps, but they noted that there is little that can practically take advantage of it other than games. TechCrunch's Darrell Etherington:\nIf you have a 2021 Apple TV 4K, which I do, you probably aren't feeling the pinch in terms of performance. In fact, I still have a first-generation Apple TV 4K in active use, and despite it now being six years old, I'd be hard-pressed to tell the difference between it and my 2021 Apple TV in a blind test. That said, the 2022 Apple TV 4K does seem to generally make things snappier when it comes to navigating between the Home Screen and apps, and even potentially within apps as well. It also definitely offers a boost when it comes to using the Apple TV as a gaming device, helping it keep up with the most graphically-demanding Arcade and App Store titles available. With expanded controller support via the most recent tvOS update, the Apple TV is a better gaming console than ever combined with the A15's performance prowess.\nOn the other hand, CNET's Eli Blumenthal found gaming on the Apple TV 4K underwhelming and noted that the A15 Bionic chip still does not help the Apple TV rival games consoles:\nNBA 2K23 loaded quickly, and the game finally has commentary which brings some console-like quality that was lacking in earlier editions, but that's where the similarity ends. In my few games, the title looks and feels a bit slower than the console version. Even with an Xbox controller paired to the Apple TV 4K, there is no direct passing and animations lack the fluidity and sharpness of the game on Xbox One, let alone Xbox Series S/X. Face models are fine, but lack detail in players' tattoos like D'Angelo Russell and Marcus Smart. Standard basketball game staples like instant replays and quick or batch substitutions also remain absent as do 2K23 game modes like The City. Gameloft's Asphalt 8 Plus similarly loaded quickly and played fine using the Apple TV's included Siri Remote. But there isn't ray-tracing or other modern graphical improvements that would make anyone confuse this title for a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series S/X game. All told, there doesn't appear to be anything extra that the A15 Bionic brings to gaming on Apple TV 4K...\nThe Verge's Chris Welch said that while the USB-C charging port of the new Siri Remote is a welcome change, there is still much more that the remote could do:\nOther than ditching Lightning for USB-C, the included Siri Remote is identical to the prior generation. This is largely positive: it's ergonomic and easy to use, and once you get down the clickpad's rotational gesture for quickly scrubbing through a movie or show, you'll rarely bother with the old less efficient way of fast-forwarding and rewinding. I do badly wish that Apple had included a U1 chip in the new remote that would've made it easy to hunt down with precision using a nearby iPhone. Failing that, even a built-in speaker would've been nice for a \"Siri, find my remote\" command. This remote isn't as easy to lose as the previous stupidly thin version, but it still happens to the best of us. You can add backlighting and a raised nub on the play / pause button (making it easier to find by feel) to my wish list for the next iteration of the Siri Remote.\nHardware and Design\nApple did not change the design of the Apple TV 4K with the 2022 refresh, and it continues to be a simple black box that's about the size of the palm of your hand. Apple did tweak the size and weight of the Apple TV, and it is now smaller and lighter.\nIt measures in at 3.66 inches on each of its four sides (down from 3.9 inches) and it is 1.2 inches tall (down from 1.4 inches. It weighs in at 7.5 ounces, which is half the weight of the prior-generation model.\nThere is an Apple logo at the top, and aside from that, the device is unobtrusive, with the black design blending in well with home decor. It is small enough that it can fit on any shelf or TV unit next to a television set.\nThere are two Apple TV variants. One has an HDMI 2.1 port and a port for the power supply, while the second has the same ports with the addition of a Gigabit Ethernet port for a wired connection. Both models feature an IR receiver for connecting to the Siri Remote.\nProcessor and Internals\nThe third-generation Apple TV 4K is equipped with an faster A15 Bionic chip. CPU performance is up to 50 percent faster than the prior generation that was equipped with an A12 chip, and GPU performance is up to 30 percent faster for improved gameplay.\nApple says that the new Apple TV offers improved responsiveness, faster navigation, and snappier UI animations. The Apple TV is available with either 64GB or 128GB of storage.\nConnectivity\nThe Apple TV 4K supports 802.11ax WiFi 6 speeds. WiFi 6 brings improved speeds, expanded network capacity, lower latency, better power efficiency, and upgraded performance in locations with many smart home devices. It is not as fast as WiFi 6E, but it does outperform WiFi 5.\nAlong with WiFi 6, the more expensive version of the Apple TV has built-in Thread support. Thread is a low-power networking technology that offers a secure, mesh-based system able to interface with other Thread-enabled smart home devices for improved connectivity.\nThe Apple TV 4K also supports Bluetooth 5.0 and it comes with an IR receiver for remote input.\nVariants\nThere are now two Apple TV 4K configurations at different price points. The entry-level model features 64GB of storage and a $129 price point, while the upgraded version features 128GB of storage, a Gigabit Ethernet port, and support for the Thread mesh networking protocol for those who use smart home devices. It is priced at $149.\n4K, Dolby Vision and HDR10+ Support\nLike prior versions of the Apple TV 4K, the third-generation Apple TV 4K supports 4K HDR content for brighter, more realistic colors and greater detail than is available with the 1080p resolution.\nWith the A15 chip, the Apple TV 4K supports both Dolby Vision and HDR10+ for the best possible quality for movies and TV shows on compatible TVs. Prior versions of the Apple TV supported Dolby Vision and HDR10, but not HDR10+.\nThe addition of HDR10+ improves HDR performance when the Apple TV is used with television sets that do not support Dolby Vision.\nThe Apple TV 4K requires a compatible 4K television to display content at a 4K resolution, and features like Dolby Vision require a TV that supports Dolby Vision. The Apple TV 4K connects to a television set using HDMI, and an HDMI cable is not included.\nSupported Photo, Video, and Audio Formats\nThe Apple TV 4K supports SDR video with AVC/HEVC, Dolby Vision (Profile 5), HDR10+/HDR10/HLG with HEVC, H.264, and MPEG-4 video. Photo formats supported include HEIF, JPG, GIF, and TIFF.\nSupported audio formats include HE-AAC (V1), AAC (from iTunes Store), MP3 (up to 320 Kbps), MP3 VBR, Apple Lossless, FLAC, AIFF, and WAV; AC-3 (Dolby Digital 5.1), E-AC-3 (Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 surround sound), and Dolby Atmos\nThe Apple TV supports Spatial Audio with Dolby Atmos and standard lossless audio, ranging from 16-bit at 44.1 kHz to 24-bit at 48 kHz. Apple says that the Apple TV 4K \"currently doesn't support Hi-Res Lossless,\" leaving the door open to the possibility of a future software update with Hi-Res Lossless support for the device in the future.\nSiri Remote\nThe third-generation Apple TV continues to use the Siri Remote that was introduced alongside the second-generation version. It features a silver aluminum body and a touch-enabled clickpad with gesture support.\nA single click on the remote brings you into a TV show or move, while a swipe moves through long lists of content. The outer part of the clickpad can be swiped across to scrub through shows and movies, fast-forwarding and rewinding as needed. The remote includes a TV/Home button, a Back button, a Play/Pause button, a Mute button, and a set of volume buttons.\nThere is a dedicated Power button for turning the television off or on, and on the side of the remote, there's a dedicated button for activating Siri. The Siri functionality is limited to a select number of countries, with a list available on Apple's website.\nIn countries where Siri support is unavailable, the Siri Remote is called the \"Apple TV Remote.\"\nSiri on the Apple TV works much like Siri on the iPhone. You can speak into the remote, with the Siri command relayed back to the Apple TV. Siri can be used for\nThe bottom of the Siri Remote features a Lightning port that can be used to recharge it every few months. The prior version of the Siri remote included an accelerometer and gyroscope that allowed it to be used as a controller for Apple TV games, but the new remote does not have that functionality and Apple instead expects users to play games with Bluetooth controllers.\nRemote App\nAlong with the physical Siri Remote, the Apple TV can be controlled using a Remote app that's available in the App Store for the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. The Remote app has a layout that's similar to the Siri Remote, offering virtual controls for navigating the Apple TV interface, accessing Siri, and controlling volume.\nBluetooth Accessories\nPopular controllers from PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo can be paired with the Apple TV for gaming purposes, and Apple expects Apple Arcade and other games to be played with a controller rather than the Siri Remote.\nThe Apple TV 4K can also be paired with Bluetooth keyboards, though typing for searches and other purposes can be done with an iPhone tied to the same iCloud account as well.\ntvOS and the TV app\ntvOS is the operating system that runs on the Apple TV 4K and Apple TV HD, offering a an easy-to-navigate television watching experience on Apple's set-top box. The current version of tvOS is tvOS 18.6, released in July.\nWith a full App Store, tvOS supports downloading a range of different apps and games that can be used on the Apple TV, and the interface design puts content front and center. Get to what you want to watch using Siri commands, the Apple Remote, or the Remote app on iPhone and Apple Watch, and keep track of shows with \"Up Next.\"\ntvOS includes several built-in apps like Photos for accessing your Photo Library, Apple Music, Podcasts, and Apple TV, an app that aggregates TV and movie content from tons of sources, including the Apple TV+ streaming service.\nChannels are included in the Apple TV app, so you can subscribe to and watch content from paid services without having to open up a third-party app, and Apple suggests content you might like to watch. You can even control your smart home products with the Home app.\nInSight\nBuilt into the Apple TV app, InSight is equivalent to Amazon X-ray. It provides information about actors, characters, and music from Apple TV+ movies and shows onscreen in realtime. Users can select an actor to see their background and filmography, or see what song is playing in a scene and add it to an Apple Music playlist.\nWhen using an iPhone as a remote, viewers can also see InSight information on the device.\nScreen Savers\nThe Apple TV supports a number of screen saver options, from aerial screen savers captured with drones to collaborations that feature characters like Snoopy.\ntvOS How Tos\nApple TV 4K: How to Stream Audio From Your TV's Inputs to HomePod (eARC)\ntvOS 26 Features\nApple adds new features to tvOS on a regular basis, and the 2025 update to tvOS is tvOS 26. tvOS updates never bring as many changes as iOS or macOS updates, but there are still some notable features in tvOS 26 that you should know about.\nLiquid Glass Redesign\nWith tvOS 26, Apple the Apple TV is getting the new Liquid Glass design. It features app icons that look like multiple pieces of glass layered on top of one another, along with translucent menu elements and more rounded buttons.\nThe updated design is only available on the second and third-generation Apple TV 4K models.\nTV App\nThe TV app displays movies and TV show posters in vertical cards instead of horizontal cards, so they take up less space on the screen for more to be viewable without scrolling to the side.\nProfiles\ntvOS 26 is able to automatically display profiles when your Apple TV is activated, so multiple people in the home can more quickly access their personalized watchlists and recommendations.\nLogins\ntvOS 26 links login information to your Apple Account for supported apps, so it's easier to sign into apps when setting up an Apple TV.\nSing\nApple Music subscribers that use Apple Music Sing for karaoke can now use the iPhone as a microphone when signing along with the on-screen lyrics. Users can also queue up songs and react to performances with emoji.\nFor some songs in other languages, Apple Music Sing also offers translations.\nFaceTime\nFaceTime in tvOS 26 supports incoming call notifications, larger-sized Contact Posters, and Live Captions in French, German, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, and Spanish.\nScreen Savers\nThere are new aerial screen savers that were captured across India.\nWhat's Next for the Apple TV\nApple is expected to debut a new version of the Apple TV in late 2025, and it is expected to include an Apple-designed Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chip. The new chip will allow Apple's smart home devices to work better together and synchronize data quicker, and it is expected to support Wi-Fi 7. The upcoming Apple TV will include a faster A-series processor, but it is not expected to get any external design changes.\nA next-generation version of the Apple TV could also be less expensive, with Apple aiming to lower prices, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\nFuture Apple TV\nA future version of the Apple TV could include a built-in camera for FaceTime and other video calling apps, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Apple added a FaceTime app to the Apple TV in tvOS 17 that works through a connected iPhone or iPad, but it also paves the way for an Apple TV with a camera.\nApple is also developing a smart display that would serve as a home hub for making video calls and controlling HomeKit devices, but it is not yet known when that will launch.\nTelevision Rumors Resurface\nThere were multiple rumors around 2010 suggesting Apple was working on an Apple-branded television set, but no such product emerged. Apple is now once again rumored to be considering developing a TV set.\nIt's not clear if Apple's plans will progress, but Apple is pushing further into smart home devices and a TV is one possibility if the plan sees success.\nApple TV 4K Roundup Update History\n- August 7 - Updated with rumors about a late 2025 launch for a new model.\n- July 11 - Added tvOS 26 features.\n- May 28 - Updated with info on the next-generation version of tvOS.\n- April 17 - Updated with tvOS 18.4.1 info.\n- March 31 - Updated with tvOS 18.4 info and next-generation Apple TV rumors.\n- December 17 - Added rumors about new Apple TV in 2025, updated Buyer's Guide information.\n- December 12 - Updated for tvOS 18.2.\n- November 20 - Added rumor about Apple television set.\n- November 15 - Added tvOS 18.2 features.\n- September 19 - Updated with tvOS 18 release.\n- September 6 - Updated with info about next-generation Apple TV.\n- August 30 - Refreshed buyer's guide information.\n- August 16 - Refreshed tvOS 18 info, added new video.\n- July 30 - Added tvOS 17.6 release info.\n- July 15 - Updated with tvOS 18 public beta release info.\n- July 9 - Refreshed buyer's guide information."
