      "title": "Apple TV+ is raising its subscription price by 30%",
      "summary": "Apple TV+ has increased its monthly fee to $12.99 as part of a broader trend of streaming services raising prices to offset higher content costs and investor pressure. Apple is also committing an additional $100 billion to U.S. manufacturing to mitigate potential Trump tariffs and demonstrate a shift toward domestic production. The company’s pricing moves come amid a crowded streaming market where rivals are adding ad‑supported tiers and raising fees, while Apple leverages its iPhone ecosystem to attract subscribers. Trump’s tariff proposals and the AI hype bubble add economic uncertainty, prompting Apple to focus on supply‑chain resilience and service expansion. Together, these developments illustrate Apple’s strategy to grow its services revenue while navigating geopolitical and market pressures.",
