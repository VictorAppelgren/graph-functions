  "content": "As President Donald Trump\u2019s August 29th deadline for new tariffs rolled around, the first thing that I thought of was 2026 planners. In July, Trump signed an executive order essentially killing a little-known but highly consequential trade rule, which meant that purchases coming from abroad \u2014 like $100 in planners and accessories \u2014 could enter the US duty-free. My preferred planner, the Hobonichi Techo, is printed and shipped from Japan. With the de minimis exemption removed, my tax bill could be between $15 and $100 \u2014 or more, depending on how the increased costs are factored. Was I willing to risk paying as much in fees, duties, and shipping as my items cost, essentially doubling the cost?\n\nFor months, Americans \u2014 and businesses abroad \u2014 have lived in something resembling a hostage situation. Trump\u2019s tariffs have boomeranged back many times over; terms are negotiated, canceled, and reinstated more times than anyone can count. Shoppers stock up on what they predict will go up in price. US consumers are already absorbing the costs of Trump\u2019s trade policies, even if they don\u2019t immediately notice it. But the end of the de minimis exemption that we all benefited from will hit people like a ton of bricks. A new era of US consumerism is upon us, and it\u2019s starting to get ugly.\n\nIn the lead-up to August 29th, it became increasingly clear which industries would feel the effects of additional import duties. Some Lego parts are now unavailable for purchase from North America. Secondhand camera sellers on eBay have been thrust into the eye of the storm while trying to sell to US shoppers, while other eBay listings for old video games include alerts that US-based customers might have ignored previously: \u201cDue to US policies, import fees for this item will need to be paid to customs or the shipping carrier on delivery,\u201d reads one item page. Vinyl record collectors reported having orders canceled that were shipping from abroad. Mechanical keyboard companies have warned US shoppers that their orders would soon be subject to additional taxes.\n\nThe domino effect extends to areas people might not have considered. Take the knitting and sewing industries: overnight, my Instagram feed became a steady stream of craft supply companies issuing notices to US-based shoppers. UK-based Merchant & Mills, which sells sewing patterns, tools, and fabric from all over the world, announced on August 21st that it would increase US prices by 15 percent to cover duties up front. On August 29th, the company issued another update, this time saying it was suspending all US orders of products originating from India, after sky-high 50 percent taxes kicked in. (India has a rich history of textile production and is the second-largest producer of cotton in the world.)\n\nSome companies have paused orders altogether as postal systems across the world stop delivering packages to the US. Every knitter knows, for example, that some of the best yarn in the world comes from Europe \u2014 in the last few weeks, yarn company after yarn company posted apologetic statements telling US shoppers that they simply won\u2019t be able to place orders for the time being while the companies figure out how to proceed. One announcement that particularly took me by surprise: Working Class History, a popular Instagram account and podcast, announced last week that it would stop shipping T-shirts printed in France to US shoppers.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the crafting industry that is feeling the immediate effects of the end of de minimis. Fans of Asian beauty and skincare products must meticulously track where they can still order from \u2014 a small but dedicated community trying to make sense of a trade war waged for no good reason.\n\nIt is not just low-cost products or fast fashion that will take a hit: luxury apparel retailer SSENSE, based in Canada, now displays customers duties at checkout. (A $326 Bape hoodie, for example, would incur an additional $69.83 in taxes.) And there are signs that the end of de minimis could have long-term, potentially fatal consequences: SSENSE filed for bankruptcy protection in late August after investors pushed for a sale, in part prompted by de minimis exemptions ending. Now that it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s clear which industries and businesses depended on duty-free shipments to operate in the first place.\n\nBut back to my planner. Not wanting to risk a surprise tariff bill, I decided to try and buy a Hobonichi in-person from a local stationary store specializing in Japanese products. But just a few days before they were scheduled to go on sale, the brick-and-mortar shop announced they would be canceling the in-person event: the inbound shipment of planners was stuck in customs, the store said, and they would be switching to a preorder system. It\u2019s a small inconvenience, the definition of first world problems that, until this point, US shoppers are largely not accustomed to. But all of that is changing \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to shake the feeling that this is the beginning of the end for many industries and modes of consumption that Americans took for granted. Many American shoppers are finding that they don\u2019t have access to limitless, instant e-commerce, possibly for the first time in their lives. And at this rate, it won\u2019t be the last time, either.",

Bandcamp said some bands won't be selling to us buyers if it's physical media or merchandise. Same for discogs seller's to. I have 2 albums that I got off Bandcamp that is coming from Germany and have a feeling something is going to happen with them. The band signed the 2 albums for me to. I posted on a FB group and others have delt with this also but I haven't seen no one talk about this. Has anyone delt with this other than me in here? I'm really bummed that my order was cancelled as it's the only way to get the vinyl now as Bandcamp is sold out. It was a 80 dollar album to."

      "text": "President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariff threats have been touch and go. As it stands currently, the 25 percent tax on goods from Mexico and Canada is on ice for a month, but a 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods is set to take effect on Tuesday, via an executive order of questionable legality.\nShein and Temu depend on a 100-year-old tariff loophole that Trump wants to close\nAlong with blanket tariffs on goods from China, Canada, and Mexico, Donald Trump has proposed closing the de minimis exception claimed by ultracheap retailers with roots in China.\nAlong with blanket tariffs on goods from China, Canada, and Mexico, Donald Trump has proposed closing the de minimis exception claimed by ultracheap retailers with roots in China.\nNestled within the order is a brief but important provision that could change how Americans shop online: the closing of a little-known loophole called the de minimis exception.\nUnder the de minimis rule, packages that are valued under $800 can enter the US duty free, and recipients in the US can get up to $800 worth of stuff per day without paying import taxes.\nE-commerce giants like Temu and Shein (but also countless smaller operations) have used this loophole to ship low-value packages to shoppers, who, in turn, benefit from not having to pay import taxes on their purchases. Temu, Shein, and other companies that ship directly to consumers don\u2019t have to store tons of merchandise in warehouses in the US: they can mail orders directly from manufacturers or warehouses in China, where many products are produced.\nThe de minimis provision has been on the books for nearly 100 years, but it\u2019s arguably a bigger issue now than at any point in the past century. The number of packages avoiding taxes has skyrocketed, from 139 million a year in 2015 to over 1.36 billion in 2024, according to US Customs and Border Protection. The cost limit was increased from $200 to $800 in 2016 after groups like eBay, Etsy, and package delivery companies lobbied Congress. And the growing popularity of platforms like Shein and Temu in the last few years normalized waiting a few weeks for orders to come from China in exchange for bargain bin-priced goods.\nThe Biden administration previously proposed tightening the de minimis loophole. Trump\u2019s executive order, as written, effectively kills it \u2014 making low-value shipments subject to existing tariffs plus the additional 10 percent tax. That\u2019s not just an extra fee; it\u2019s an existential threat to the business models of Shein and Temu. A T-shirt from China, for example, would be subject to Trump\u2019s new 10 percent tax, plus standard tariffs that are based on the specific product and then additional China-specific tariffs that the first Trump administration put in place.\nTemu and Shein\u2019s business models keep the retailers\u2019 prices impossibly low and has threatened Amazon\u2019s dominance in online shopping. Last November, Amazon took a page out of Temu\u2019s playbook and introduced Amazon Haul, a marketplace of ultracheap home goods, gadgets, and clothing that looks and feels like Chinese e-commerce platforms. As I wrote in December, Amazon is taking advantage of this same de minimis exemption: the products on Haul are even cheaper than normal Amazon listings, and the marketplace features many products that also appear for sale on Shein, Temu, and AliExpress.\nIf de minimis is indeed closed for packages from China, it\u2019s likely that the impossibly cheap dresses, coats, handbags, and home decor Americans are hooked on will soon get more expensive. Tariffs are a tax on the person or entity importing the goods, not on the exporter. Research has shown that getting rid of the de minimis loophole would both cost the government billions of dollars more in enforcement and disproportionately raise costs for poorer Americans.\nIt\u2019s not just big corporations that would be affected. Dropshippers who fulfill orders directly from abroad would be affected, as would small businesses importing components, parts, or supplies in batches under $800. Small orders from platforms like Etsy or eBay coming from China could cost consumers more, too.\nTemu, Shein, and Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTrump has justified imposing tariffs and ending the de minimis loophole by pointing to \u201cthe synthetic opioid supply chain,\u201d claiming that de minimis packages receive less scrutiny and can be used for shipping drug ingredients. A Reuters investigation last year outlined how de minimis packages could be used to traffic drugs \u2014 but it\u2019s not clear that low-value parcels pose a greater threat than larger shipments.\nThe prices on platforms like Shein and Temu feel unbelievably cheap because, in a way, they are. These goods depend on a technicality that both sides of the political aisle appear motivated to stamp out, and on Tuesday, they might succeed.\nMost Popular\n- Amazon ends shared Prime free shipping outside your home\n- Is AI the end of software engineering or the next step in its evolution?\n- My favorite cooking gadget is getting a big upgrade\n- Dolby Vision 2 goes beyond HDR with more AI and \u2018authentic motion\u2019 smoothing\n- Tesla\u2019s new \u2018Master Plan\u2019 sounds like AI slop"

      "text": "For millions of people, any one of the many unprecedented actions in the first 100 days of the second Trump presidency was enough to show that the US is barreling toward \u2014 or has already arrived at \u2014 billionaire-helmed fascism. Sure, Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has indiscriminately fired thousands of federal employees and gutted the parts of the federal government that protect everyday people. And elsewhere, government funds are being spent on arresting immigrants with no criminal record and sending them to languish in prisons abroad; college students are being disappeared for their opinions on Palestine. But what really seems to have triggered Americans all across the political spectrum is Trump\u2019s plan to levy steep tariffs on just about every country on Earth, and the resulting economic instability. When the stock market lost around $10 trillion in value over the course of a few days earlier in April following the announcement, even Trump\u2019s loudest boosters started to worry.\nAmerica is living in tariff limbo\nThe sweeping, nonsensical tariffs imposed on the world by Donald Trump may finally be what breaks through to the public in a presidency subsumed by chaos.\nThe sweeping, nonsensical tariffs imposed on the world by Donald Trump may finally be what breaks through to the public in a presidency subsumed by chaos.\nTrump\u2019s tariffs are not trade policy as much as they are a fishing expedition: What can he extract from trade partners and from US companies that can be spun as a win for him? Early tariff truces with Canada and Mexico suggest the deals don\u2019t even have to be very good: much of what Canada agreed to do to target fentanyl had already been announced weeks or months prior. Trump\u2019s tariffs are a cudgel looking for a target.\nThe extreme swings between \u201ctariffs on,\u201d \u201ctariffs off,\u201d and \u201ctariffs somewhere in between\u201d have given rise to a culture of constant tariff anxiety \u2014 for US trading partner countries, for private businesses, and especially for people who are not the ultrawealthy. Influencers peddle advice for what products to stock up on; billionaires sound the alarm, then quickly demur. The threat of tariffs \u2014 by now a MAGA buzzword and solution for all of the perceived wrongs against the US \u2014 is at once urgent and ambient.\nIn the past month, article after article has reported on the everyday items shoppers in the US were buying up before tariffs were due to take effect: Italian olive oil, teas, skincare and makeup products, expensive electronics, clothing, and more. Social media platforms like X, Instagram, and TikTok are filled with people sharing their large purchases, trying to anticipate what they\u2019ll need that may go up in price. The call to \u201cstock up\u201d is ceaseless: it comes from influencers and public figures, from random people urging viewers to \u201cbuy up their Amazon carts,\u201d from Mark Cuban, and from reports of panic-buying at Apple stores.\nShould you be saving your money or buying a bunch of vanilla?\nBut even the preparations everyday people can actually make are a gamble; it\u2019s a game of whack-a-mole, a moving target as tariffs shift day to day and week to week. If you are someone who uses Korean skincare, for example, your strategy of buying $500 worth of products may be different depending on whether you\u2019re getting taxed 25 percent versus 10 percent. It is the difference between saving your money and buying a bunch of vanilla because you think Madagascar, a key vanilla supplier for the US, will get hit with 47 percent tariffs under Trump\u2019s plan. If you rushed out to your nearest Best Buy because you thought consumer electronics were about to double in price, you perhaps felt like a fool a few days later when Trump said smartphones, computers, and other products from China would be excluded from the additional 125 percent tax \u2014 only to backtrack again hours later. The uncertainty of tariffs also, ironically, makes for a good marketing tactic: as far back as February, small businesses report getting emails from suppliers suggesting they stock up on components before prices inevitably rise. \u201cDon\u2019t wait,\u201d one email from a magnet supplier reads. \u201cAct now to avoid paying more later.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s tariffs throw a wrench into every business\u2019s supply chain, from giant corporations like Nintendo and Apple to small brands making personal care products and clothing. But despite the wide-ranging effects of tariffs, big tech companies were initially largely silent when Trump\u2019s first rounds of taxes were announced. In general, some of the most transparent businesses have been the ones with the most to lose but the least power to change the hand they were dealt: the American denim brand worried about getting products into overseas markets, the indie cosmetics company warning of knock-on effects to the industry, or the sexual wellness brand adding a \u201cTrump tariff surcharge\u201d to customers\u2019 shopping carts.\n\u201cBy naming the surcharge, we hope to spark more conversations around how economic policies affect the things we use, love, and rely on,\u201d Dame, the sexual wellness company, wrote on its site. \u201cAnd most importantly, how they affect the small, mission-driven businesses trying to create change.\u201d Small operations like Dame likely have little chance of getting a meeting with the President to grovel for tariff exceptions.\nThe businesses speaking out are those with the most to lose and the least power to change it\nTrump\u2019s proposed taxes on imports unnerved even the MAGA faithful. In January, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon backed Trump\u2019s tariffs: \u201cIf it\u2019s a little inflationary, but it\u2019s good for national security, so be it,\u201d Dimon told CNBC. \u201cGet over it.\u201d By early April, as the stock market was hemorrhaging trillions of dollars, his tune had changed, warning that Trump\u2019s tariffs increased the chance of a recession. Bill Ackman, a billionaire hedge fund investor who endorsed Trump, exhibited early signs of a crash-out on X, saying it was \u201cnot what we voted for\u201d despite broad tariffs being one of Trump\u2019s marquee campaign promises. When Trump once again backed down and instituted a 90-day pause, Ackman was back on the horse: \u201cThis was brilliantly executed by @realDonaldTrump,\u201d he posted on X. \u201cTextbook, Art of the Deal.\u201d\nDespite Trump\u2019s about-face on his dubiously calculated tariff rates, the fact of the matter remains: the 125 percent tax on Chinese imports, the blanket 10 percent on everyone else, plus the additional tariffs on products from Canada, Mexico, and steel and automobile parts are severe. They will change how Americans shop, and how and what American companies produce. Consumers \u2014 especially low-income people \u2014 will likely be the first to feel it when their cheap imports will skyrocket in cost, perhaps without them realizing it (online orders from companies like Shein, Temu, and AliExpress are already more expensive than they were). Economists warn that it is difficult to control the effects of tariffs; price increases are unpredictable, and it\u2019s possible that entire categories of products (especially from China) may become unavailable in the US, period.\nThe Trump administration wields tariffs like a weapon, shaking down anyone who might have something of value to them and their political agenda. Even when tariffs are temporarily \u201cpaused,\u201d the threat of sudden change is omnipresent, as long as there is something to be gained for the administration. The only constant seems to be that everyone else gets squeezed.\nMost Popular\n- Amazon ends shared Prime free shipping outside your home\n- Is AI the end of software engineering or the next step in its evolution?\n- My favorite cooking gadget is getting a big upgrade\n- Dolby Vision 2 goes beyond HDR with more AI and \u2018authentic motion\u2019 smoothing\n- Tesla\u2019s new \u2018Master Plan\u2019 sounds like AI slop"

      "text": "Important Notice - USA Customers\nUPDATE: 28/08/25: Royal Mail have confirmed that we will be able to offer a DDP (Delivered Duties Paid) solution to our customers. The current understanding is that the only charges applicable will be the Reciprocal Tariff (based on country of origin) plus a 50p clearance fee. This is good news. We are working on a system that will allow us to calculate and collect these charges at checkout on our website, and we hope to be able to resume shipping to the US within a couple of weeks.\nUPDATE: 27/08/25: DHL have informed us that the taxes/duties that they started charging customers last week were made in error. They are in the process of refunding everyone who paid, so if you were charged unexpectedly, expect a refund soon. This serves to underline how hard it has been to understand the rules - if DHL can't get it right, what chance do smaller independent businesses have! We will get there...\nUPDATE: 21/08/25: We have suspended Royal Mail shipments to the US as specified below.\nUPDATE: 20/08/25: We have suspended DHL shipments to the US with immediate effect. Customers have informed us that DHL have started charging taxes/duties NOW - despite the fact the rules don't change until 29th August. DHL haven't informed us why, and both our DHL account managers are on holiday at the same time (!) so we are completely in the dark as to why DHL have done this.\nUPDATE: 19/08/25: We are working on a DDP (Delivered Duties Paid) solution, which will allow us to collect all taxes and duties due at the point of checkout on our website. We don't know how long this will take to implement (our website software doesn't currently have this capacity), but our best estimate is that we will be able to resume shipments to the USA by mid-September. By this point, we should also have greater clarity on exactly what the tariffs and duties will be.\nIMPORTANT NOTICE: 14/08/25: We currently believe that we will have to suspend all shipping to the USA on 21st August 2025.\nThe US government has announced the elimination of the $800 de minimus exemption for ALL countries posting parcels to customers in the US.\nWhat does this mean?\nPreviously, we were able to send packages below $800 in value to customers in the USA with no additional taxes, duties or tariffs being applied. From 29th August 2025, any package arriving in the US will be subject to additional taxes, duties or tariffs.\nHow much will the extra charges be?\nOur current understanding is that there will be FOUR separate charges:\n- Import duty. This is based on the HS/HTS code of the product. For yarn, this is generally between 4% and 7.5%.\n- Reciprocal Tariff Rate: Based on Country of origin (COO). For example, 10% for UK, 15% for Turkey, 50% for India, 30% for China. These are where most yarn spinners are based.\n- Section 301 Tariff Rate: Based on HS/HTS code. 25% for yarn (ouch). This is the one most people aren\u2019t aware of yet, but also the one with the most question marks over whether it will apply or not. We currently believe it will, but may be wrong. Edit: It now appears that the 301 tariff only applies to goods of Chinese origin. Probably.\n- Clearance fee / use of deferment fee: Generally between 4% and 5%, plus between \u00a30.50 and \u00a32.00 per order.\nSo the likely average extra charges could be in the region of 50% based on our current understanding. Yeah, really not good.\nWhat will Wool Warehouse do?\nWe don\u2019t think many people will be willing to pay an additional 50% charge when it is presented to them by the shipping company (DHL, USPS, etc). This will lead to HUGE amounts of undelivered packages being returned to us.\nWe could try and implement a system where the extra charges are collected on our website before we ship. This is not easy or cheap to do, and frankly we don\u2019t think many people would be willing or indeed able to pay the extra 50% anyway. It simply isn\u2019t a viable option for us at the moment \u2013 though could be a possible solution given more time, and if the charges were reduced at some point in the future.\nWhy are you stopping shipping on 21st August?\nThe rules are based on when the goods enter the US, not when we post them. Given the likely rush and increase in parcels being sent immediately prior to the deadline, we\u2019re planning on stopping shipping a week before the deadline (14:00 BST, 21st August), to give our parcels a fighting chance of actually being received into the US before the 29th August.\nClearly this is not something we want to do. The US is a significant part of our business. This decision is based on our current understanding of the rules. We may not be completely correct, and we hope we aren\u2019t \u2013 but we have to act based on the best information we have available to us.\nIf we can come up with a workable solution that allows us to continue shipping to the US, we will of course jump at the opportunity!"

      "text": "When tariffs are tacked on to many imported goods, someone\u2019s got to foot the bill.\nAccording to President Donald Trump, foreign countries and overseas businesses are eating the cost. But evidence shows that American consumers and businesses are paying for the tariffs the administration has implemented as its go-to policy levers.\n\u201cIt been proven, that even at this late stage, Tariffs have not caused Inflation, or any other problems for America, other than massive amounts of CASH pouring into our Treasury\u2019s coffers,\u201d Trump posted on his social media site, Truth Social, earlier this month. \u201cAlso, it has been shown that, for the most part, Consumers aren\u2019t even paying these Tariffs, it is mostly Companies and Governments, many of them Foreign, picking up the tabs.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s post did not include any substantiation for his claims.\nThere is a growing field of evidence to the contrary: Economic data, academic research, businesses\u2019 expenses, and people\u2019s first-hand experiences are showing that it\u2019s American firms and consumers who are seeing increasingly higher costs due to the tariffs.\nThat burden is expected to grow only heavier in the months \u2014 and, potentially, years \u2014 to come as more tariffs take effect, and others settle more deeply into supply chains.\nWhat the latest data shows\nIf foreign exporters are absorbing tariff costs, one possible way to see that in US economic data is whether they\u2019re lowering their pre-tariff export prices.\nIf that\u2019s the case, it would show up as lower or falling US import prices.\nRecent months\u2019 data, however, has shown that import prices (which exclude the costs of tariffs, insurance and shipping costs) have held mostly steady. They\u2019ve risen by 0.5% since the November election and by 0.2% since March, after which the bulk of new tariffs were announced, according to a recent note from Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\u201cOne argument that had looked plausible until recently was that import prices had been supported by pre-tariff stockpiling in [the last part of 2024 and the first three months of 2025], which saw goods imports soar to record highs,\u201d Pantheon economists Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen wrote in an August 19 note. \u201cThat left foreign exporters flush with orders, providing little incentive to cut pre-tariff prices to remain competitive. But import prices have remained resilient despite goods imports dropping back very sharply in [the second quarter], suggesting a steep decline in prices ahead is unlikely.\u201d\nA more granular look at import price data indicates that there\u2019s a slight dip in import prices from China; however, for the vast majority of countries, it\u2019s basically been flat, Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings, told CNN in an interview.\n\u201cSo that\u2019s telling you that all of that is paid by importers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s now a question of, is it the manufacturer, is it the retailers, or is it the small business that\u2019s bringing it in? They now have to figure out, \u2018How much of this can I take on, and how much of this will I pass on?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s very likely they will pass the bulk of it on,\u201d he added.\nTo this point, consumers have been mostly shielded from starkly higher prices.\nThrough June, US consumers had absorbed 22% of tariff costs, but that share was expected to rise to 67% by October, according to an August 10 estimation from Goldman Sachs economists. That assessment led to a demand from Trump that the investment giant fire its chief economist.\nGoldman Sachs economists said they expect that about 70% of the direct costs of the tariffs will eventually fall on the consumer, and that the total could rise to 100% if including the spillover effects of domestic producers raising their prices (something that has already occurred and is expected to continue \u2014 more on that below).\nThere\u2019s a laundry list of reasons why tariff-driven price hikes are a slow boil: Businesses loaded up their warehouses with pre-tariffed goods; higher costs have been split by entities along the supply chain, lessening the blow at the retail store; and Trump\u2019s fits-and-starts approach to tariffs has meant that the bulk of them did not go into effect for months, and many items are exempted (for at least now).\nAt the same time, inflation has remained relatively tame for both good and not-so-good reasons: Ongoing deflationary trends in key areas, marking a continued unwinding from pandemic-era shortages and price spikes; falling gas prices (they\u2019re down 9.5% from July of last year) amid global economic uncertainty; and then because of depressed consumer demand in areas such as travel.\nStill, recent Consumer Price Index inflation reports reveal increases in the cost of certain imports the United States relies on heavily, including household furnishings, linens, tools, toys and sporting goods.\nSlow-bleeding, tariff-driven \u2018sneakflation\u2019\nAs of August 8, imported goods cost 5% more than pre-tariff trends predicted and domestically produced goods are running 3% higher, according to newly released research from Harvard Business School professor Alberto Cavallo and colleagues.\nCavallo, in an interview with CNN, said he expects that the passthrough will continue in steady increments but could be limited in some cases depending on the competitiveness of the product category and industry.\n\u201cI think it could take over a year for us to see some of the effects of these tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a year from now, maybe two years from now, we\u2019ll notice that consumers ended up paying a significant amount of the tariffs even if they didn\u2019t notice the increases right away.\u201d\nNew research last week from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta showed that businesses \u2014 those directly exposed to tariffs and those who are not \u2014 expect to raise prices this year.\nAt the end of 2024, surveyed businesses anticipated increasing their prices by 2.5% during the year ahead. By mid-May, those estimates shot up to 3.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed, which found that little difference existed in the price growth expectations of firms with or without foreign exposure.\nHowever, the survey showed some starker increases expected among services, providing firms, which prompted questions around whether these price increases could deliver an inflationary impulse as was seen three years ago .\n\u201cThe chief concern regarding the impact of tariffs is whether we will experience the same phenomenon that we witnessed during the pandemic. That is, will price pressures spread beyond only the prices that are directly affected by increased import duties?\u201d Atlanta Fed researchers wrote in the report.\nBut in the coming months, the expectations are for the tariff passthrough to be gradual and drawn out, Matt Bush, a US economist at Guggenheim Investments, told CNN in an interview.\n\u201cBusinesses say they\u2019re working both with suppliers and consumers to help share some of the cost burden,\u201d Bush said. \u201cThey do indicate that they\u2019re willing to eat some of the cost for now. But I think as the realization sets in that these tariffs are not going back down, they will start to pass more on to consumers.\u201d\nThe world\u2019s largest retailer said as much on Thursday: Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said that the company\u2019s costs have risen every week because of tariffs but will aim to keep prices down \u201cfor as long as we can.\u201d\nSmall increases over time could make it easier for some consumers to handle; however, to others \u2014 especially those with little to no wiggle room in their budgets \u2014 that slow burn could very well feel like a slow bleed.\n\u201cLower-income Americans are sadly adept at juggling their expenses and trying to make every dime count,\u201d Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, wrote in an email to CNN. \u201cThey may go without meat or coffee one week in order to buy shoes for their kids. The next week, they may skip a car payment to cover their electric bill and a medical expense. It\u2019s a constant juggle where they allocate money to their most urgent need at that moment.\u201d\nRetailers and major brands know that many Americans live paycheck to paycheck, so they\u2019re using \u201csneakflation\u201d to pass along the tariffs in small increments in hopes that consumers won\u2019t notice or will be able to better absorb it, Long added."

The closure of the \u201cde minimus\u201d exemption, which allowed packages worth less than $800 to enter the US duty free, came as a \u201csurprise\u201d to Ssense and directly contributed to its CCAA application. The change to de minimis is scheduled to go into effect on Friday.\nThe CCAA filing comes in what had already been a tough year for Ssense, which has been squeezed by a luxury slowdown that\u2019s disproportionately impacted its mostly young, aspirational consumer base. Its sales fell 28 percent year over year in the first half of 2025, according to US debit and credit card data from Consumer Edge. In May, it laid off more than 100 employees across departments.\nAtallah added that Ssense will continue to operate as usual, and keep paying salaries and benefits until further notice.\n\u201cWe are here today because the rules of the game have changed,\u201d Attallah said in the memo. \u201cWhat happens next depends on the ruling of the CCAA proceedings, but our determination is unwavering.

      "text": "Trump's 50% tariff on India kicks in as Modi urges self-reliance\nUS tariffs of 50% on goods from India took effect on Wednesday as Donald Trump sought to punish Delhi for buying Russian oil and weapons.\nThe tariffs \u2013 among the highest in the world \u2013 include a 25% penalty for transactions with Russia that are a key source of funds for its war in Ukraine.\nIndia, a vital strategic US partner in the Indo-Pacific, has shown no signs of stopping its purchases, calling the tariffs unfair and vowing to choose the \"best deal\" on buying oil to protect its 1.4 billion people.\nBut there are fears exports and growth in the world's fifth largest economy could suffer. The US was, until recently, India's largest trading partner.\nThe tariff setback has sent the Indian government into firefighting mode.\nEarlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised to cut taxes to mitigate the impact of the tariffs which will disrupt millions of livelihoods across the country's export-driven industries that supply everything from clothes to diamonds and shrimp to American consumers.\nHe said a Diwali gift in the form of a \"massive tax bonanza\" was on its way for the common man and the millions of small businesses that power Asia's third largest economy.\nWearing a bright saffron turban and addressing crowds of spectators from the ramparts of Delhi's Red Fort during Independence Day celebrations, Modi also urged small shop owners and businesses to put up boards of \"Swadeshi\" or \"Made in India\" outside their stores.\n\"We should become self-reliant - not out of desperation, but out of pride,\" he said. \"Economic selfishness is on the rise globally and we mustn't sit and cry about our difficulties, we must rise above and not allow others to hold us in their clutches.\"\nHe has since repeated these comments in at least two other public addresses this week. Modi's message to his countrymen has been loud and clear - both make in India and spend in India.\nThe former has proved increasingly difficult, with the share of manufacturing as part of India's gross domestic product (GDP) stagnating at 15% levels, despite his government rolling out subsidies and production incentives over the years.\nBut spurring long-pending tax reforms that immediately put more money into the hands of people could help the government soften some of the blow, experts say.\nAnd so, after a $12bn income tax giveaway announced in the budget earlier this year, Modi is now aiming for an overhaul of India's indirect tax architecture \u2013 a reduction and simplification of the goods & service tax (GST).\nGST, which was introduced eight years ago, replaced a maze of indirect taxes to reduce compliance and the cost of doing business.\nBut experts say it has too many thresholds and exemptions, making the system extremely complicated. They've repeatedly called for it to be revamped.\nNow, Modi has promised precisely that, with India's finance ministry putting out a proposal for a simplified two-tier GST system.\n\"Combined with the income tax cut in place from April 2025... the GST rate reforms [likely worth US$20bn; \u00a314.7bn] should together provide a meaningful push to consumption,\" analysts from Jeffries, a US brokerage house, said after the announcement.\nPrivate consumption is a mainstay of India's economy, contributing to nearly 60% of the country's GDP. While rural spending \u2013 supported by a bumper harvest \u2013 has remained strong, demand for goods and services in cities has continued to slow down due to lower wages and job cuts in major sectors like IT, post the pandemic.\nModi's \"fiscal stimulus\" or tax cuts should help ensure a consumption recovery, according to investment banking firm Morgan Stanley. It will push GDP up and drag inflation down.\n\"This is particularly crucial amid headwinds from ongoing global geopolitical tensions and adverse global tariff-related developments that might impair external demand,\" Morgan Stanley said.\nAmong the sectors most likely to benefit from the tax breaks are consumer-facing ones such as, scooters, small cars, garments and even things like cement that goes into making homes, where demand typically picks up pace around Diwali.\nWhile the specifics are unknown, most analysts estimate that the revenue loss on account of a lower GST would be offset by surplus collections of some taxes and higher than budgeted dividends from India's central bank.\nAccording to Swiss investment bank UBS, the GST cuts will also have a larger \"multiplier effect\" than the previous corporate and income tax cuts undertaken by Modi, as they \"directly affect consumption at the point of purchase, potentially leading to higher consumer spending\".\nModi's tax handouts could also increase the probability of a further interest rate reduction by India's central bank, which has already slashed rates by 1% in the past few months - something that is likely to spur more lending, according to analysts.\nThis, along with a boost in the salaries of nearly five million government employees and 6.8 million pensioners that kicks in early next year, will help India's economy retain its growth momentum, they say.\nIndia's stock markets have cheered these announcements. And despite the panic caused by trade uncertainties, earlier this month, India also got a rare sovereign rating upgrade from S&P Global, after a gap of 18 years. A sovereign rating measures how risky it is to lend to a government or invest in a country.\nThis is significant because it could lower the government's borrowing costs and improve foreign investment flows into the country.\nBut even as Modi rushes through with long-delayed reforms, India's growth prospects have slowed significantly from the 8% levels seen a few years ago, and its external crisis shows no sign of ebbing.\nThe war of words between Delhi and Washington, especially over the former's energy purchases from Russia, have only intensified and trade negotiations which were set to begin earlier this week, have been called off.\nMeanwhile, at 50%, the tariffs on India are akin to a sanction on trade between the world's biggest and fastest growing economies, say experts - a scenario that would have been unthinkable even just a few months ago.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook."

      "text": "Browsing Amazon Haul, the online shopping giant\u2019s new $20-and-under bargain bin section, I immediately recognize not just a product, but a specific image. The photo is on a listing for \u201cTimeless Black Dress for Both Casual and Formal Gatherings,\u201d and it is stolen.\nThe delusion of Amazon Haul\nAmazon\u2019s new ultracheap discount store looks a lot like Temu. And Shein. And AliExpress.\nAmazon\u2019s new ultracheap discount store looks a lot like Temu. And Shein. And AliExpress.\nThe image actually belongs to a New York-based independent brand called Mirror Palais, which sold the \u201cDaisy Dress\u201d for $545 a few years ago. Elevated by social media algorithms and its celebrity fans, Mirror Palais\u2019 images have traveled from the brand\u2019s website, to tweets, to Pinterest mood boards, and finally, to the discount section of the world\u2019s largest online retailer, where it is \u2014 obviously \u2014 not for sale. On Amazon, it\u2019s listed for $7.49. When I add it to my cart, I realize it\u2019s even cheaper: inexplicably and improbably, it is an additional 65 percent off.\nThis one image of a black mini dress does not just appear on random listings on Amazon Haul \u2014 you can find it on Walmart and AliExpress as well as smaller sites with names like Mermaid Way and VMzona \u2014 all selling dupes (short for duplicates) of the original Mirror Palais dress. I even find a separate listing on Amazon, in the typically but not unbelievably cheap section, where this same image is used to sell the LEZOOEY Womens New Lace Halter Slim Sexy Bodycon Spaghetti Strap Black Mini Dress for $19.99. The listing on normal Amazon has a bit more details about the item, including a video of close-up shots of the straps and hem. If I didn\u2019t know about the original dress, I might assume the Haul version is a dupe of this dupe.\nWhen Amazon announced its ultracheap Haul section in November, it made clear what shoppers already knew: Americans love junk, and the cheaper the better. Amazon Haul joins a constellation of other online retailers that offer the widest possible selection of products for the lowest possible price, exploiting shoppers\u2019 apparently bottomless appetite to consume. But whether it\u2019s Amazon Haul, Temu, Shein, AliExpress, or any number of other retailers, what they sell is the same \u2014 both literally and philosophically. The public\u2019s shopping options are themselves dupes of something else.\nOver the past few years, as e-commerce companies with roots in China like fast fashion brand Shein and online superstore Temu have gained popularity in the US, the tenor of how we shop shifted \u2014 instead of quick shipping, shoppers were happy to wait a couple of weeks while packages full of items made their way stateside from China. Amazon\u2019s moniker, Haul, is indicative of this. A haul, in internet parlance, necessitates purchasing a bunch of stuff. (Recall Temu\u2019s \u201cShop like a billionaire\u201d motto.) Even if a package takes a week or two to arrive, the ability to purchase more is, for many shoppers, worth the wait.\nThe black imitation dress is not the only thing I purchased in my Haul haul: I threw in a salt and pepper grinder ($1.95); a protective case for AirPods ($6.99); a sweater ($19.99); a neon light that says \u201cLove\u201d ($6.99); a pleather handbag ($6.99); and a hat with fake distressing that, confusingly, reads \u201cBICTH\u201d ($7.99). With the 65 percent discount, the total came to $27.05.\nLike the dress, I was able to locate many of these items for sale on other platforms. On Shein, the handbag is listed for $8.60 and uses the same product images as the listing on Amazon Haul. On AliExpress, more than a dozen listings from different storefronts use the same images, priced anywhere from 99 cents to $15. The listings and prices are arbitrary: in the past, when I\u2019ve purchased the same item from multiple AliExpress shops, the physical product is identical. They\u2019re just packaged and presented slightly differently, repeated until it\u2019s unclear where the product even originated from or what the \u201creal\u201d price is. I\u2019ve come to think of all of these ultracheap retailers as front doors leading to the same backend of suppliers and manufacturers, using the same set of lifted images \u2014 a Potemkin village of superstores operated across the globe, shrouded in secrecy.\nIn many ways, online shopping has always required the shopper to suspend their disbelief: that donated clothing actually gets redistributed, that \u201cfree\u201d shipping is real, or that a startup is using a magic AI tool to complete your purchases. The advent of ultrafast fashion brands like Shein has pushed these delusions even further, dangling deals in front of customers and betting (often correctly) that a low, low price will be enough for them to take a chance on a product that, five years ago, would have perhaps seemed like an obvious scam. The mantra of \u201cif it seems too good to be true, it probably is\u201d almost feels quaint now \u2014 impossibly \u201cgood\u201d deals are not a warning sign for consumers, but the expectation.\n\u201cItems in Amazon Haul are from vetted Amazon sellers and are backed by Amazon\u2019s A-to-z guarantee so customers can shop with confidence that the products they\u2019re purchasing are safe, authentic, and in the condition expected,\u201d company spokesperson Maxine Tagay told The Verge in an email. Tagay added that Amazon has a \u201czero-tolerance policy\u201d for counterfeit products and that the company is investing in measures to \u201cprotect customers from fraud and other forms of abuse.\u201d Action taken may include removing counterfeit listings and blocking accounts. After The Verge reached out to Amazon for comment, the image of the black dress disappeared from the Haul listing, though it remains elsewhere on the site.\nThe thing about gimmicks that seem too good to be true is that, eventually, the fantasy fades. Sometimes reality sets in when that product an influencer promoted finally arrives and it sucks, and it eventually makes its way to a landfill. Other times, it\u2019s because the company producing the item admits child labor is involved in its creation. And then, there is what appears to be coming down the pike: the systems that allow for cheap binge shopping come undone.\nPackages valued under $800 \u2014 like my Amazon Haul order or your Shein impulse purchases \u2014 are able to enter the US import tax-free under the de minimis rule, and the White House says more than a billion parcels a year claim the exemption. In September, the Biden administration proposed overhauls of the de minimis loophole that would cut down on the number of small packages that could claim the duty-free exemption. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of 60 percent or more to products coming in from China, which would likely cause the price of goods to go up for consumers. The ultracheap product offerings of Temu, Shein, AliExpress, and Amazon Haul might start to look like not such a great deal.\nMy Haul package arrives about a week and a half after placing the order, traveling from China\u2019s Guangdong Province all the way to New York. Seeing these half a dozen random products shoved in a small paper mailer, everything feels much more pathetic than the pictures online suggested. The sweater is shrink-wrapped in a lump, giving it the look of a package of frozen fish. The dress is thin and flimsy and appears to be incomplete: the ends of the straps dangle in the back instead of being secured on the inside of the bodice. Is it a design choice? Possibly. But each side is a different length. The handbag has a mysterious closure on the handle, which makes it feel like someone asked AI to design a trendy bag and the robot got confused. The hat does indeed read BICTH, which amuses me but really makes you wonder what normal person would buy this. My boss accidentally shatters the plastic battery case for the neon light with his bare hands trying to open it. If you are a shopper enticed by the promise that buying a mountain of $3 products will make you feel rich, you may be disappointed. The items themselves are not made to last \u2014 and perhaps the industry itself isn\u2019t, either.\nMost Popular\n- Amazon ends shared Prime free shipping outside your home\n- Is AI the end of software engineering or the next step in its evolution?\n- My favorite cooking gadget is getting a big upgrade\n- Dolby Vision 2 goes beyond HDR with more AI and \u2018authentic motion\u2019 smoothing\n- Tesla\u2019s new \u2018Master Plan\u2019 sounds like AI slop"

      "text": "Postal services across Europe have suspended most parcel shipments to the US, citing widespread uncertainty about the impact of new import tariffs announced by Donald Trump.\nFrance\u2019s La Poste on Monday joined other operators, including Germany\u2019s Deutsche Post, Spain\u2019s Correos, Poste Italiane and the Belgian, Swedish and Danish postal services, which all halted a majority of US-bound shipments over the weekend.\nAustria\u2019s \u00d6sterreichische Post and the UK\u2019s Royal Mail said they would stop accepting packages on Tuesday, to allow enough time for packages posted before then to arrive in the US before the tariffs, scheduled to come into force at the end of August, kick in.\nThe US president last month signed an executive order abolishing from 29 August a tax exemption that allowed small packages worth less than $800 \u2013 the preferred option for many small European businesses \u2013 to enter the US duty-free.\nA total of 1.36bn packages were sent last year under the so-called \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption, containing goods worth $64.6bn, according to US Customs, but such parcels will now face a 15% tariff \u2013 the same rate as most other imports from the EU.\nAnalysts have said that the regulatory changes, if they are maintained, are likely to have a considerable impact, particularly on small and medium-sized European companies exporting lower-value goods to the US.\nEuropean postal services said they would continue to ship letters and parcels sent by individuals containing gifts worth less than \u20ac100, but warned that these would be subject to extra checks to prevent the service being used for commercial goods.\nThe operators blamed widespread uncertainty about how the new tariffs would work, as well as a lack of time to prepare.\n\u201cKey questions remain, particularly regarding who will have to pay the tariffs and how, what additional data will be required, and how data will be transmitted to US Customs,\u201d said DHL, Europe\u2019s largest logistics company, which owns Deutsche Post.\nThe company said it was no longer \u201caccepting or transporting parcels and postal items containing goods from business customers destined for the US\u201d.\nLa Poste, which sends 1.6m packages on average to the US each year, 80% of them from businesses and 20% from individuals, said the new rules had been confirmed by US authorities only on 15 August.\nThe late announcement had left European postal services with \u201can extremely limited timeframe to get prepared. Moreover, the rules\u2019 related documentation still requires further clarification,\u201d the French operator said.\nPoste Italiane said it had been \u201cforced to temporarily suspend acceptance of all shipments containing merchandise destined for the US\u201d. The Nordic logistics company PostNord said the the pause was \u201cunfortunate but necessary\u201d.\nThe Dutch postal service, PostNL, said the Trump administration was pressing ahead with the new duties despite US authorities lacking a system to collect them, while Royal Mail said it hoped the interruption would last only a few days.\nPostEurop, an association of 51 European public postal operators, said that if no practical solutions could be found before 29 August, it was likely that all its members would suspend the bulk of parcel shipments to the US.\nWith Agence-France Presse and Associated Press"

      "text": "Lego pauses part of its 'Pick a Brick' service for U.S. customers after Trump's de minimis change\nThousands of pieces from Lego's \"Pick a Brick\" service are no longer available to customers in the U.S. and Canada as of this week, which could make it harder for hobbyists to customize their sets and replace lost bricks. You can probably blame President Donald Trump.\nPick a Brick is an online service offered by the Lego Store that lets fans order individual pieces for as little as three cents. The Lego news and reviews site New Elementary reports that \"thousands of elements\" from its \"Standard\" collection were removed from the service for North American customers on Aug. 25. Approximately 1,500 pieces from its mainstream \"Bestseller\" collection still remain.\nLego is calling the removal a \"service pause\" in a note at the top of the Pick a Brick landing page. \"In the US & Canada, Standard pieces are temporarily unavailable,\" the note reads. \"You can still shop our Bestseller range which includes thousands of the most popular bricks and pieces ready to order.\"\nMashable has reached out to Lego to find out why the company has stopped shipping a swath of its selection, and we'll update this story if we hear back. But as New Elementary and others note, Trump's tariff policy is the likely reason.\nMore specifically, Trump has eliminated the \"de minimis\" import rule that exempted packages from taxes and customs duties like tariffs if they amounted to less than $800. The change went into effect on Aug. 29, four days after New Elementary flagged the Standard pieces' disappearance.\nUSA Today reports that more than 30 countries have stopped shipping to the U.S. in response to the end of di minimus \u2014 including Belgium and the Czech Republic, where Lego has distribution centers. Per New Elementary, Standard Pick a Brick pieces are stored and shipped to North American customers from Lego's European warehouses, while Bestseller pieces are located in the U.S.\nAFOLs in search of Standard pieces that Lego no longer carries might have luck on third-party marketplaces like BrickOwl and BrickLink.\nAfter ending the de minimis exemption for imports from China and Hong Kong in May, Trump ordered its global termination in July. A White House fact sheet announcing de minimis' suspension called it \"a catastrophic loophole used to, among other things, evade tariffs and funnel deadly synthetic opioids as well as other unsafe or below-market products.\" But as Mashable previously reported, the end of the exemption will make previously cheap products more expensive for U.S. shoppers, and force small businesses that rely on international goods to decide between absorbing the new costs or increasing their prices.\nHaley Henschel is a Chicago-based Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable who reviews and finds deals on popular tech, from laptops to gaming consoles and VPNs.

However this is not a promotional post.\nTLDR: If you live in the USA and purchasing goods from outside of the country be prepared to pay large import fees as of the 29th August 2025. Make sure shipment method has prepaid taxes such as DPP/DDP to avoid this.\nUSA published the Executive Order \"Suspending Duty-Free De Minimis Treatment For All Countries\". According to this decree, all shipments of goods by business customers arriving in the USA after 29 August 2025, 00:01 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) will be subject to import duties. In addition to the elimination of the previously existing duty-free limit of USD 800, this Executive Order also brings with it numerous procedural changes and provisions for the shipment of goods by post.\nAs a result, we will be suspending our non express services for the time being until we figure out a viable solution to this problem."

      "text": "Subscribe\nThe Trump administration is throwing various hobbies enjoyed by Americans into chaos and is harming small businesses domestically and abroad with its ever-changing tariff structure that is turning the United States into a hermit kingdom. It has made buying and selling things on eBay particularly annoying, and is making it harder and more expensive to, for example, buy vintage film cameras, retro video games, or vintage clothes from Japan, where many of the top eBay sellers are based.\n\u201cTrying to figure out what the future of this hobby is going to look like for those of us in the USA (other than insanely expensive),\u201d a post on r/analogcommunity, the most popular film photography subreddit, reads. \u201cAll of my lenses and my camera body came from Japan, they would have been prohibitively expensive [now], paying an extra $80 per item. I feel like entry level to this hobby is going to get hit especially hard.\u201d Another meme posted to the community under the title \u201cShopping on eBay be like this now\u201d reads \u201cThe age of the Canon Mint++ is over. The time of the Argus C3 has come,\u201d referring to a common way that Japanese eBay sellers list Japanese-made Canon cameras. The Argus C3 was a budget mass-produced, American-made camera that was not popular in Japan, and so most of the people selling them are in the United States. Some people like them, but it has been nicknamed \u201cthe brick\u201d because it \u201ccould serve as a deadly weapon in a street fight.\u201d It remains very inexpensive to this day.\nThe photography hobby is a microcosm of what anyone who wants to buy anything from another country is currently experiencing. The de-minimis exemption, which allowed people to buy things internationally without paying tariffs if the items cost less than $800, made it very easy and less expensive to get into hobbies like film photography, retro video games, and vintage fashion, to name a few. The Trump administration is ending that exemption Friday and it will quickly become a financial and/or logistical mess for anyone who wants to buy or sell anything from another country. Communities and companies focused on electronics, board games, action figures, skincare, flashlights, sex toys, watches, and general ecommerce are also freaking out, stopping service to the United States, or telling U.S. customers to expect higher prices, higher fees, longer shipping times, more paperwork, more headache, and unpredictable delays.\nIn recent days, national mail carriers in the European Union (including DHL, which is widely used internationally), Australia, India, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and, crucially, Japan, have started restricting many shipments to the United States. Some of the few remaining ways to send shipments internationally to the United States is through UPS and FedEx, which have warned customers that the end of de-minimis means more paperwork, higher shipping prices (both have increased their international processing fees), and also means that either the shipper or the receiver will have to pay tariffs on whatever is being sent, which of course adds both costs and processing time. This is on top of the fact that FedEx and UPS are often more expensive services in the first place."
