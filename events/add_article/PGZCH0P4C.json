      "summary": "Crude and gasoline futures fell sharply on Friday as worries over US economic data and President Trump's new tariff regime weighed on demand expectations. The drop was driven by weaker-than‑expected July payrolls, a contraction in the ISM manufacturing index, and a 2‑week low in the S&P 500, all signalling a slowdown in global energy demand. Meanwhile, OPEC+ production hikes and a potential supply glut add further bearish pressure, while sanctions on Russian oil and the possibility of a Russian supply shock remain concerns.",
