  "description": "The Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network, known as FoodNet, has cut required monitoring to just two pathogens that cause infections, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and \u2026",
  "content": "Federal health officials have dramatically scaled back a program that has tracked food poisoning infections in the U.S. for three decades.\n\nThe Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network, known as FoodNet, has cut required monitoring to just two pathogens that cause infections, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That\u2019s down from eight.\n\nRELATED: Salmonella outbreak tied to recalled eggs has sickened 95 people since January\n\nUnder the change, which began in July, health departments in 10 states that participate in the joint state and federal program will be required to monitor only foodborne infections caused by salmonella and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli bacteria. Those are among the top contributors to foodborne illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S., the CDC said.\n\nPreviously, the FoodNet system required surveillance of infections confirmed to be caused by six other germs as well: campylobacter, cyclospora, listeria, shigella, vibrio and Yersinia. That is now optional.\n\nNarrowing the reporting requirements \u201cwill allow FoodNet staff to prioritize core activities,\u201d CDC spokesman Paul Prince said in a statement. The move lets the agency \u201csteward resources effectively,\u201d he added. It\u2019s not clear whether the action is connected to recent funding cuts enacted by the Trump Administration.\n\nBut food safety officials, including those in states that participate in the program, said the change could slow detection of foodborne illness outbreaks and obscure the full picture of food-related infections.\n\n\u201cLong term, it will affect our ability to use surveillance data to better understand risks in the food supply,\u201d said Carlota Medus, who supervises the Minnesota Department of Health\u2019s foodborne diseases unit.\n\nFoodborne infections caused by specific germs are required to be reported to the CDC or to state health departments. But relying on passive reports of infections rather than actively seeking out laboratory data, hospital details and other information can mean that some cases are missed, Medus said.\n\n\u201cFoodNet doesn\u2019t just count cases. The FoodNet sites collect robust data that contribute to the understanding of certain infections,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to Minnesota, FoodNet sites include health departments in Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, New Mexico, Oregon, Tennessee, certain counties in California and New York.\n\nThe FoodNet reduction was first reported by NBC News.\n\nFoodNet was created in 1995 as a partnership between the CDC, the U.S. Agriculture Department, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and several states. It has tracked infections in a surveillance system that captures about 16% of the U.S. population.\n\nIt allowed the U.S. to estimate the number of cases of illness per 100,000 population caused by certain foodborne germs, said Frank Yiannas, a food safety expert and former FDA official.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t know as accurately as possible if we\u2019re getting better or worse in respect to certain pathogens,\u201d Yiannas said.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

      "text": "At a glance\n- FoodNet is a collaboration between CDC, USDA, FDA, and 10 state health departments.\n- FoodNet tracks infections caused by eight pathogens in a surveillance area that includes 16% of the U.S. population.\n- Personnel at each FoodNet site routinely communicate with clinical laboratories and collect detailed information about infections.\nPurpose\nThe Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) conducts surveillance for Campylobacter, Cyclospora, Listeria, Salmonella, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), Shigella, Vibrio, and Yersinia infections diagnosed by laboratory testing of samples from patients. FoodNet also conducted surveillance for Cryptosporidium through 2017.\nObjectives\n- Determine the burden of foodborne illness in the United States\n- Monitor trends in the burden of specific foodborne illness over time\n- Attribute the burden of foodborne illness to specific foods and settings\n- Disseminate information that can lead to improvements in public health practice and the development of interventions to reduce the burden of foodborne illness\nEmerging infections\nFoodNet is the principal foodborne disease component of CDC's Emerging Infections Program, which prevents and controls infectious diseases by providing the highest quality scientific information to monitor emergencies, evaluate public health interventions, inform policy, and measure progress in foodborne disease prevention.\nParticipating sites\nFoodNet was established in July 1995 and is a collaborative program among CDC, 10 state health departments, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nFoodNet personnel located at state health departments regularly contact the clinical laboratories in Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Tennessee and selected counties in California and New York to get reports of infections diagnosed in residents of these areas.\nWhat data we collect\nFoodNet accomplishes its work through active surveillance; surveys of laboratories, physicians, and the general population; and population-based epidemiologic studies.\nActive laboratory surveillance\nFoodNet has conducted population-based surveillance for laboratory-diagnosed infections caused by Campylobacter, Listeria, Salmonella, STEC, Shigella, Vibrio, and Yersinia since 1996; Cyclospora since 1997; and STEC non-O157 since 2000. FoodNet also conducted surveillance for Cryptosporidium from 1997 through 2017. FoodNet began to collect information on infections identified by culture-independent methods in 2009 for STEC and Campylobacter and in 2011 for Listeria, Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, and Vibrio.\nFoodNet is an active surveillance system, meaning that public health officials routinely communicate with more than 700 clinical laboratories serving the surveillance area to identify new infections and conduct periodic audits to ensure that all infections are reported.\nFoodNet collects information on laboratory-diagnosed infections identified by culture or culture-independent diagnostic test (CIDT) for bacterial pathogens and microscopy or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for parasites. Personnel at each FoodNet site collect information about infections and share that information with CDC through FoodNet's database. The information includes\n- hospitalizations occurring within 7 days of the specimen collection date,\n- the patient's status (alive or dead) at hospital discharge (or at 7 days after the specimen collection date if the patient is not hospitalized),\n- whether the patient traveled abroad in the 7 days before illness began, and\n- selected food and environmental exposures.\nHemolytic uremic syndrome surveillance\nFoodNet conducts surveillance for physician-diagnosed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) through a network of pediatric nephrologists and infection-control practitioners. FoodNet staff also review hospital discharge data for pediatric HUS cases to validate surveillance reports and identify additional cases by using ICD-9-CM/ICD-10 codes specifying HUS, acute renal failure with the hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura with diarrhea caused by an unknown pathogen or E. coli.\nSurveillance projects\nIn addition to routine surveillance, FoodNet occasionally conducts special surveillance projects. In 2002, two sites conducted population-based surveillance for reactive arthritis associated with Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, and STEC infections. In 2009, FoodNet conducted a pilot surveillance program for community-acquired Clostridioides difficile infections (formerly known as Clostridium difficile) in Connecticut and New York. In 2010, FoodNet conducted a pilot surveillance program for Cronobacter sakazakii infections in selected sites.\nHow information is collected\nThe burden of illness pyramid is a model for understanding foodborne disease reporting, and illustrates steps that must occur for an episode of illness in the population to be registered in surveillance.\nStarting from the bottom of the pyramid:\n- Some members of the general population are exposed to an organism;\n- Some of these exposed people become ill;\n- Some of these ill people seek medical care;\n- A specimen is obtained from some of these people and submitted to a clinical laboratory;\n- A laboratory tests some of these specimens for a given pathogen;\n- The laboratory identifies the causative organism in some of these tested specimens and thereby confirms the case;\n- The laboratory-confirmed case is reported to a local or state health department.\nFoodNet conducts laboratory surveys, physician surveys, and population surveys to collect information about each of these steps. This information is used to calculate estimates of the actual number of people who become ill. Other information is used to estimate the proportion of these illnesses transmitted by food."

      "text": "By Arthur Allen, KFF Health News\nDon\u2019t get Nathan Jones started on xylitol, the active ingredient in his chewing gum, nasal spray, and other products. He\u2019ll talk your ear off about its wondrous powers against tooth decay, as well as its potential to fight COVID, heart disease, Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 you name it.\nFor now, Jones, the founder of Xlear, can\u2019t make those claims in his company\u2019s advertising. But if the lawsuit his company brought against the Federal Trade Commission succeeds, he\u2019ll likely be able to say anything he wants.\nAs the Trump administration loosens enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission, Department of Justice, and FDA of unproven health claims, Jones and his allies in the \u201cmedical freedom\u201d movement are pushing to permanently roll back the health regulatory state.\nFor decades, the FTC has required companies to back any medical claims about their products with substantial evidence, while taking actions against hundreds of \u201cbogus health cures,\u201d said Jessica Rich, the FTC\u2019s director of consumer protection from 2013 to 2017.\nIf successful, the lawsuit by Jones\u2019 company \u201cwould be a complete game changer,\u201d said Mary Engle, associate director of the FTC\u2019s advertising practices division from 2001 to 2020.\nThe FTC \u2014 and FDA \u2014 don\u2019t have sufficient staffing to rigorously police health claims, but Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s allies in the alternative medicine world have suggested that the agencies already go too far.\n\u201cThe pharmaceutical industry has a stranglehold and monopoly in America,\u201d Jones told KFF Health News. \u201cThe consumer should have a choice in what they\u2019re doing and how they\u2019re being proactive and reactive in their health care.\u201d\nJones and other members of the Alliance for Natural Health USA, which includes alternative medicine practitioners, vaccine skeptics, and proponents of \u201cnatural\u201d remedies, were elated when Kennedy became Health and Human Services secretary in February. One called it a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\u201d\nKennedy had warned shortly before Trump\u2019s reelection that the FDA would face a reckoning for its \u201caggressive suppression\u201d of vitamins, peptides, nutraceuticals, and other products from a supplement industry that has sought more freedom to make claims about its products.\nLosing Regulatory Bite?\nFor decades, the FDA has had the power to recall dangerous products and check health claims, although it has nowhere near the workforce it would need to police the vast$70 billion supplement industry.\nThe FTC has traditionally had more teeth, successfully suing companies that make unsubstantiated claims. For example, the agency won a judgment last year against a company that advertised a supplement as \u201cclinically shown\u201d to improve memory.\nThe FTC under Trump has not announced any new enforcement actions against supplement makers (it did send consumers the proceeds of previous fraud settlements ), and the administration has reversed several COVID-related FTC actions. In March, the FTC dropped a lawsuit filed in 2021 against Jones and Xlear over the marketing of its \u201cdrug-free\u201d sinus rinse as a COVID preventive and treatment. The Department of Justice also closed a case brought on behalf of the FTC and the FDA against a company that claimed its Earth Tea could cure COVID.\nIn June, Jones, who says he spent $3 million fighting the FTC suit before it was dropped, sued back. The company asked a judge to forbid the FTC from requiring that health product marketers back their claims with convincing evidence, such as clinical trials \u2014 a position the FTC has maintained since 1984.\nXlear hopes the suit will be considered under last year\u2019s Supreme Court ruling known as Loper Bright, said Xlear attorney Rob Housman. That ruling gave courts more power to second-guess federal agencies\u2019 interpretation of the laws that govern their activities.\nThe Alliance for Natural Health joined Xlear in a separate petition in May demanding that the FTC drop its requirement for companies to provide substantial evidence backing health claims, and to withdraw 2022 guidelines that generally require companies to run a randomized clinical trial to prove their claims.\nThe petition was filed by Jonathan Emord, a lawyer who has successfully fought FDA and FTC regulation of supplements and unsuccessfully ran for governor of Virginia as a Republican in the 2024 primary.\nEmord\u2019s petition seeks to flip the burden of proof. Instead of requiring the makers of supplements and cosmetic creams, pills, sprays, and herbals to prove their products do what they claim to do, the government would have to prove that they don\u2019t.\n\u201cIf an advertiser throws caution to the wind and makes a health-related product claim without resort to any supporting evidence, the FTC is powerless\u201d to stop it, Emord wrote in the petition. \u201cRather, the claim will be tested in the idea and information market free of government constraint.\u201d\nEmord and the Alliance for Natural Health did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\nThe FTC would not comment on the lawsuit, the petition, or the issue of substantiation in general, spokesperson Juliana Gruenwald Henderson said.\nShorthanded and Mostly Hands-Off\nMeanwhile, with Kennedy\u2019s administration chockablock with proponents of nontraditional health products, \u201cthere\u2019s been a downtick of enforcement,\u201d Housman said.\nSince Trump took office, the FTC has lost at least a quarter of the staff in its Division of Advertising Practices, which took the original action against Xlear, said Serena Viswanathan, who retired as FTC associate director in June. The Department of Justice has reorganized its consumer protection unit, which backed the FTC in many actions, and moved some of its lawyers to immigration and other areas.\nIn one of the only actions it has taken against deceptive health practices under Trump, the FTC hosted a July 9 workshop titled \u201cThe Dangers of \u2018Gender-Affirming Care\u2019 for Minors.\u201d\nIn FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson\u2019s opening statement at that event, he excoriated the Biden administration for allowing hormonal and surgical treatments for youth experiencing gender dysphoria.\nBut Ferguson justified the FTC\u2019s new attack on these treatments by referring to the agency\u2019s traditional practice of pursuing companies for making false and deceptive claims. Noting the agency\u2019s past actions against \u201cshyster snake oil salesmen\u201d promoting fake cures, Ferguson highlighted the Biden-era FTC\u2019s position that \u201chealth claims need to be backed up by reliable scientific evidence\u201d and an \u201cincredibly high standard of scientific \u2018substantiation.\u2019\u201d\nUnder that logic, Ferguson \u201chas to defend against the Xlear lawsuit,\u201d Rich said.\n\u201cIf anyone can just hawk health products without any basis, and customers spend money on bogus cures instead of seeking proper care, it\u2019s really a serious issue,\u201d she said.\n\u2018Nanny State\u2019 or Not?\nFerguson\u2019s remarks reflect one of many contradictions in the administration\u2019s approach to health policy. While favoring deregulation and greater personal liberty to consume unregulated supplements, Kennedy has also pushed for stricter FDA oversight of food and drugs, while advocating for behavioral change that GOP officials derided as \u201cnanny state\u201d tactics when Democrats like former first lady Michelle Obama promoted doing so.\nKennedy, for example, has said he wants more randomized control trials for vaccines and drugs \u2014 a requirement rejected by medical freedom advocates like Jones.\n\u201cI like clinical data; I think it\u2019s great,\u201d Housman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the be-all and end-all.\u201d\nKennedy has also announced plans to change a policy that allows food companies to add ingredients without a full safety review. But many supplement makers use the policy to get their products on the market without FDA review, and some are unhappy about the potential clampdown.\nBanking on Xylitol\nThe FDA approved xylitol as a food additive in 1963 and regulates it as a cosmetic ingredient. Jones, who said his company has about 110 employees and sells to 70,000 retailers, founded Xlear 25 years ago.\nJones expresses skepticism of vaccines, believes the drug industry has a monopolistic stranglehold on health care, and is a \u201ctrue believer\u201d in xylitol, Housman said.\nIn an interview with KFF Health News, Jones said that the slightly sweet, minty-flavored substance reduces gum inflammation by blocking the adhesion of tooth-rotting Streptococcus mutans bacteria to cells in the mouth.\nIn Finland, where water is not fluoridated, dentists have long recommended xylitol-imbued chewing gum for children. In addition to fighting cavities and lowering periodontal disease, Jones said, xylitol could fight chronic illnesses like obesity, Alzheimer\u2019s, and heart disease, which \u201call have a correlation with oral hygiene.\u201d\nBut \u201cthe government bans us from going out and talking about what xylitol does,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot say xylitol can help prevent tooth decay, because xylitol is not a drug, and that\u2019s a drug claim.\u201d\nAs for its use against COVID, three ear, nose, and throat specialists interviewed by KFF Health News said that xylitol is good for moisturizing nasal cavities, perhaps a bit better than simple saline solution. While there\u2019s no evidence it prevents or cures COVID, xylitol, like saline nose washes, may reduce symptoms when used toward the start of any viral upper respiratory infection, said Christine Franzese, a professor of otolaryngology at the University of Missouri Medical Center and the chair of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery\u2019s allergy, asthma, and immunology committee.\nXylitol is poisonous to dogs, but deemed safe to humans when used at recommended doses in sprays, candies, chewing gum, and other products, according to the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, which also states that evidence is mixed on whether xylitol fights cavities effectively.\nAt higher doses, xylitol can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems, and a study funded by the National Institutes of Health and published last year found that regular use of xylitol as a sweetener could exacerbate heart disease. The quantities of xylitol consumed daily by participants in that study were far higher than what\u2019s in a few sticks of chewing gum, however.\nWhether his lawsuit succeeds or not, Jones can probably expect a rosy business future.\nOn May 21, he and pediatric dentist Mark Cannon of Northwestern University were called to testify in the Utah Legislature in support of a pilot project to provide Xlear\u2019s gum to students and prisoners in the state as a replacement for fluoridated water, which the state banned in March.\nFlorida ordered fluoride removed from the state\u2019s water starting July 1, and other states are considering bans. Kennedy wants to end fluoridation nationwide, despite widespread skepticism of his belief that it poisons the brain at common dosing levels.\nThe bans are a boon to Xlear, Jones said. The company would provide gum for the Utah pilot at cost, he said, but if governments promote it and people learn more, \u201cthat\u2019s where we see us being able to grow.\u201d\n____\n\u00a92025 KFF Health News.

      "text": "By Katie Workman, For The Associated Press\nIn the summer heat, we find ourselves drawn to that glorious section of the drinks menu that promises relief in the form of a cold, creamy, brain-freezing indulgence. But ordering a frozen drink looks different in different parts of the U.S., and in different restaurants and ice cream shops.\nSo, what is the difference between a milkshake, a malt, a frappe or maybe even a concrete?\nGeography, tradition and local lingo all play a role in how frozen drinks are made and what they\u2019re called.\nLet\u2019s break it down one strawful (or spoonful) at a time.\nMilkshakes\nPerhaps the most iconic of the bunch, the milkshake is typically a blend of ice cream and milk, blended until smooth and sippable. It\u2019s simple and sweet. The ice cream usually forms the base flavor of the drink, and then other flavorings are involved, from syrups to extracts to fresh fruit.\nAt the Lexington Candy Shop, a 100-year-old luncheonette with an old-fashioned soda fountain on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side, vanilla is the most popular milkshake \u2014 about 60% of all shakes ordered. That\u2019s according to John Philis, who co-owns the shop with Bob Karcher, and whose grandfather, Soterios Philis, opened it in 1925.\nTheir next most popular flavors are chocolate, coffee and strawberry, Philis said. Lexington Candy uses homemade syrups, he says, which give the shakes \u201ca nice wow.\u201d\nOther fan favorites at the shop include the classic black and white (vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrups) and the Broadway (chocolate syrup with coffee ice cream). In the summer, there are peach shakes.\nMalts\nA malt is essentially a milkshake with a scoop of malted milk powder thrown in. Malted milk powder is an old-fashioned flavoring that combines malted barley, wheat flour (caution to the gluten-free crowd) and evaporated milk. It gives the drink that distinct toasted, almost nutty flavor that transports you mentally to a 1950s diner or drive-in.\nFun fact: Malted milk powder was originally created as a nutrition booster, mostly for babies, but it found its home behind the counter of ice cream shops and luncheonettes. It adds slightly richer, old-school vibes to shakes and other frozen drinks.\nThere are also plenty of frozen blended drinks made with frozen yogurt instead of ice cream; these are sometimes known as fro-yo shakes.\nFrappes\n\u201cFrappe\u201d might mean different things to different people, depending on where they\u2019re from. In New England, particularly Massachusetts, a frappe is what most of us would call a milkshake, made with milk, ice cream and usually some other flavorings.\nIn Massachusetts, you will hear this drink called \u201cfrap\u201d (rhymes with \u201cnap\u201d), but believe me when I say there is no consensus on the correct pronunciation of the word. Sometimes a frappe from this region might simply be flavored cold milk, no ice cream involved.\nThere is also a genre of frappes associated with coffee-blended drinks, popularized by chains like Starbucks. Think icy, blended lattes, often topped with whipped cream. These are pronounced \u201cfrap-pays.\u201d\nFrosteds\nPhilis says that in New York City and other regions, a shake used to be known as a \u201cfrosted.\u201d\n\u201cWhen someone comes in and orders a \u2018frosted,\u2019 I like this person,\u201d Philis declares.\nWhen McDonald\u2019s and other fast-food chains started calling shakes \u201cshakes,\u201d the world followed suit, and the word \u201cfrosted\u201d went out of fashion.\nA frosted float, Philis explains, is a milkshake with an extra scoop of ice cream floating on top. Talk about gilding the lily!\nConcretes\nThen we have the concrete, an ultra-thick, creamy frozen dessert so dense that a spoon can stand upright in it. This is essentially frozen custard blended with mix-ins like candy, cookies or fruit, but no milk is added. It\u2019s more of a scoopable treat than a slurpable one.\nConcretes are popular where frozen custard is popular \u2014 mostly in the Midwest. Frozen custard has significantly less air in it than most ice cream, and a required 1.4% of egg yolks, which gives it its signature richness.\nThe concrete was invented at a frozen custard shop called Ted Drewes in St. Louis. If you buy one there, the server will hand it to you upside down, saying, \u201cHere\u2019s your concrete,\u201d and it won\u2019t fall out.\nTravis Dillon (whose wife, Christy, is founder Ted Drewes\u2019 granddaughter) gave this origin story: In the 1950s, a kid named Steve Gamir used to come in and ask the guy behind the counter for \u201cthe thickest shake you can make.\u201d Employees started leaving the milk out of Gamir\u2019s shakes, just running the custard through the machine, resulting in a shake that requires a spoon, not a straw.\nDillon says chocolate is their most popular flavor, then chocolate chip, strawberry and Heath Bar, but adds that there are lots of other flavors to explore, including a malted chocolate concrete \u2014 the best of two frozen-drink worlds!\nFloats\nIce cream floats are the fizzy cousins of shakes. A scoop of ice cream (usually vanilla) is plopped into a glass of soda (usually root beer or cola, occasionally orange soda or a lemon-lime like Sprite) to create a frothy, sweet, bubbly concoction. Floats can be nostalgic for some folks.\nLexington Candy remains old-fashioned with their floats, making the sodas to order with syrup, stirring by hand, then adding the ice cream. In some areas of the country, you might hear a root-beer float referred to as a \u201cbrown cow.\u201d\nIce cream sodas\nLike floats, ice cream sodas are not made in a blender \u2014 but the difference lies in the fizzy base. Philis says his are made by combining the syrup of your choice with seltzer. Then add a scoop of ice cream. He says usually the syrup and the ice cream are the same flavor, but people also like to mix and match.\nSmoothies\nFinally a word about smoothies, the supposedly more health-conscious frozen treat. Smoothies are traditionally made with fruit, yogurt, juice and sometimes ice. Sometimes, the fruit is frozen before it is blended into the drink. Smoothies are designed to feel virtuous, but they can still pack plenty of sugar, calories and richness, depending on the ingredients. For instance, if you see a peanut butter-chocolate-banana smoothie, you may realize quickly that this is more about flavor than health.\nSo the only question is: Is there enough time left in the summer to try the whole lexicon of frozen creamy drinks? Believe in yourself. I believe in you.\nWorkman has written two cookbooks focused on family-friendly cooking, \u201cDinner Solved!\u201d and \u201cThe Mom 100 Cookbook.\u201d She blogs at themom100.com."

      "text": "Emily Brubaker likes to create food that\u2019s simple but flavor-forward. It\u2019s a focus that put her in the role of resort executive chef at Omni La Costa Resort & Spa \u2014 and made her the winner of the first season of the NBC food competition show \u201cYes, Chef!\u201d helmed by judges Martha Stewart and Jose Andres, which aired earlier this summer. That win earned her $250,000.\nThe show was a unique mix of the by-now traditional series of individual and team contests that we\u2019ve become accustomed to from shows like \u201cTop Chef,\u201d combined with a strange dynamic of helping participants overcome personality and behavior issues for which friends, family, and co-workers nominated them. \u201cYes, Chef!\u201d was just as focused on \u2014 and complicated by \u2014 the interpersonal drama these issues created as it was on the food. Brubaker was nominated by her husband, chef Jake Brubaker of the La Jolla Beach & Tennis Club, for her \u201cstubbornness\u201d and \u201cinsecurity.\u201d Others clearly had control and temper issues that manifested themselves throughout the series.\nWhat struck me, though, as I watched the series was neither stubbornness nor insecurity from Emily Brubaker, but the mama bear role she assumed with fellow competitors in team challenges that even extended to the dishes she chose to prepare \u2014 and that won her Most Valuable Chef (MVC) on three episodes. And she\u2019s sharing some of those recipes here.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that these dishes are pretty time-efficient. For instance, Brubaker\u2019s White Bean and Anchovy Dip With Potato Chips earned her her first MVC during a challenge in which the teams had to allot time for each chef on their team to complete their dish.\n\u201cI wanted to give my team as much time as they possibly could get for challenges,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI saw the white beans and anchovies and recalled how my chef friends in Las Vegas, where I had worked, would play with them in every way. So, I thought I\u2019d make a dip. It\u2019s quick and it\u2019s appetizing. And I added potato chips. They could not get enough of my chips. It was hilarious.\u201d\nBrubaker prepared grilled branzino with corn puree for another challenge as well as roasted carrots on orange labneh with harissa vinaigrette \u2014 another MVC win. We have those recipes as well.\nA Carlsbad native, Brubaker earned a psychology degree at UC Santa Cruz before going to cooking school at Le Cordon Bleu in Pasadena.\n\u201cThe psychology degree really helped me on the show because I could see what was going on with the other contestants,\u201d she said.\nIt\u2019s clear that her culinary education also served her well. She went on to work at Jo\u00ebl Robuchon\u2019s Las Vegas restaurant early in her career, as well as Sage at the MGM Resorts International. She took some time off to raise her two kids, and last year the family relocated from Vegas to San Diego for her current job. Now she oversees the development of new dishes and menus for multiple restaurants at La Costa.\nBrubaker\u2019s winning White Bean and Anchovy Dip With Potato Chips is super easy and quick to make. Puree the beans, garlic, coriander, cumin, paprika and anchovies in a blender before slowly adding in olive oil. Once the mixture is smooth, you add lemon juice and kosher salt to taste.\nThat can be all, but you\u2019ll want to also make the herb oil that accompanies the dip. Clean your blender container and fill it with parsley, the anchovy oil from the dip\u2019s anchovies, rosemary leaves, garlic and lemon zest, and pulse.\nBrubaker showed me how she makes her quick and simple homemade potato chips: Use a mandoline to slice russet potatoes very thin. Then briefly place the slices in cold water to wash off excess potato starch. Heat a large, deep skillet or a pot with grapeseed oil to 325 degrees (use a candy thermometer) and fry the potato slices in batches, drain them on paper towels and immediately season them with kosher salt.\nTo serve, spread the bean dip around a serving plate, leaving a large hole in the center to place the chips, then drizzle the herb oil on top of the dip. So pretty and so delicious \u2014 just don\u2019t save the chips for later. They are best after they\u2019re just made. Can\u2019t make chips? Serve with store-bought, or crackers.\nBrubaker\u2019s grilled whole branzino is the main event. She serves it with a unique corn puree with pan-roasted corn and asparagus. Sound intimidating? It\u2019s not at all. A whole fish is a great break from fillets. Go to a fish market and, if branzino isn\u2019t available, Brubaker suggested any kind of seabass that\u2019s around 2 pounds. Make sure it\u2019s gutted.\nStart with the side dish, because the branzino will cook very quickly. For the corn puree, melt butter until it just starts to brown, then add the corn kernels and cook until they\u2019re very tender. Place it all in a blender and puree, then season with salt. Next up is the roasted corn and sliced asparagus. This, too, is simple. Pan roast the vegetables in butter until they just start to get color, then remove from heat. If you\u2019d like to add your own choice of herbs and spices, go for it.\nNow you can grill the fish. Season it inside and out on the skin with just salt and pepper. Fill the cavity with lemon slices and thyme sprigs. Spray the branzino with cooking spray so that it doesn\u2019t stick and place the fish on a hot grill. Don\u2019t try to move it until it easily releases from the grill, so the skin will crisp and stay intact while the flesh cooks. Then flip the fish and, again, don\u2019t move it until it gives easily.\nServe the fish with the corn puree topped by the pan-roasted corn and asparagus. Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the dish.\nIf you\u2019re having a dinner party, you\u2019ll want to have even more food on hand, so we have another dish that won Brubaker an MVC: her Roast Carrot Salad. I like carrots, but I don\u2019t love them, but I loved these Middle Eastern-style carrots.\nBrubaker roasts rainbow carrots cut in half and tossed in coriander, olive oil and salt at 375 degrees for just over 15 minutes, until they\u2019re tender and caramelized. While they\u2019re cooking, she mixes labneh \u2014 a tangy, thick, strained yogurt \u2014 with orange zest and juice and a bit of salt. Then she makes her Harissa Vinaigrette. Harissa is a North African chili paste that\u2019s, yes, spicy, but also very earthy and smoky. She uses the Hamsa brand made by friends, but you can easily find harissa in markets. Mix the harissa with orange juice, olive oil and a touch of salt. Finally comes a little bit of dukkah, a nutty mix of herbs, seeds and spices. Toast coriander seeds, cumin seeds and black and white sesame seeds, then grind them by hand in a molcajete (think mortar and pestle) or in a spice grinder until you have a semi-fine grind.\nTo put it all together, spread the labneh on a salad plate and top with about seven carrot halves. Drizzle with the vinaigrette and sprinkle the dukkah on top.\nReady for dessert? Here is Brubaker\u2019s summery Peach Bourbon Slab Pie. For this, she used peaches from her tree at home. You could also substitute other fresh summer fruit or use the basic recipe and transition into other seasonal fruit throughout the year. To make the dough, use a stand mixer to combine flour, salt and sugar, then add cubes of cold butter and blend until you have a sandlike texture. Keep a glass of ice water nearby, because now you\u2019ll add the water one tablespoon at a time as the mixer is on until the dough just comes together. You won\u2019t need all the water.\nHer crust recipe is pretty standard, but she improves on it with a bit of brown sugar. Her most important tip is to only mix the ingredients until crumbly. Then pull the dough out of the mixing bowl and divide it in two. Shape each in a flat square, wrap in plastic and let rest in the refrigerator for at least two hours but up to 24.\nTo make the filling, cut the peaches into wedges and toss in a large bowl with cornstarch, kosher salt, sugar, vanilla bean paste and bourbon (or lemon juice).\nNow you put it together. Pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees. You\u2019ll bake the pie on a quarter sheet pan (13 inches by 9 inches). Roll out each crust about an inch wider and longer than the pan. Press the edges of the bottom dough against the sides and just a bit over the top. Place the peach mixture evenly over the dough, then cover with the top dough so it just hangs over the sides. Pinch together the top and bottom edges of the dough all the way around. You can cut designs or slashes \u2014 or create a lattice \u2014 in the top dough to release steam. Whisk an egg and brush that on top of the dough and sprinkle a little sugar on top. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes until golden brown and bubbly. Brubaker suggests serving it with butter pecan or vanilla ice cream. Got leftovers? Slice it up and wrap the pieces to store in the freezer.\nWhite Bean and Anchovy Dip With Potato Chips\nMakes 4 servings\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the bean dip:\n12 ounces white beans\n5 garlic cloves\n1 1/2 tablespoons ground coriander seeds\n1 1/2 tablespoons ground cumin\n1 teaspoon paprika\n1 1/2 ounces anchovies\n3 1/2 ounces olive oil\n2 1/2 ounces lemon juice\nFine kosher salt to taste\nFor the herb oil:\n1 bunch parsley, leaves picked\n2 tablespoons anchovy oil, strained from anchovy container\n1 sprig rosemary, leaves picked\n3 cloves garlic\n1 lemon, zested\nFor the potato chips:\n3 russet potatoes, sliced thin on mandoline\n2 gallon grapeseed or other vegetable oil for frying\nFine kosher salt to taste\nDIRECTIONS\n1: Make the bean dip: Add beans, garlic, spices and anchovies to a food processor and process until smooth, about 4 minutes.\n2: Add olive oil slowly. We are looking for a combined smooth texture. Add lemon juice once smooth and season with kosher salt to your taste. Reserve; this dip is great either at room temperature or cold.\n3: Make the herb oil: In a blender, combine all ingredients and pulse until you have a broken vinaigrette. Drizzle over bean dip to your taste.\n4: Make the potato chips: Place potato slices in cold water to wash off excess potato starch.\n5: Heat oil in a deep frying pan to 325 degrees. Use a candy thermometer to keep temperature steady.\n6: Fry potatoes in batches until golden. Drain on paper towels and season with salt. Reserve until ready to eat. Serve with bean dip.\nNote: These will get stale overnight.\nGrilled Whole Branzino With Corn Puree and Pan-Roasted Corn and Asparagus\nMakes 4 servings\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the corn puree:\n3 tablespoons unsalted butter\n4 ears white or yellow corn, cut kernels from cob\nKosher salt to taste\nFor the pan-roasted asparagus and corn:\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter\n2 ears white or yellow corn, cut kernels from cob\n1 bunch green asparagus, cut on bias into coins\nFine kosher salt to taste\nFor the branzino:\n2 pounds whole branzino, gutted\nFine kosher salt to taste\nGround black pepper to taste\n1 lemon, sliced into rounds\n3 sprigs thyme\nCooking spray, as needed\n1 lemon, cut in half\nDIRECTIONS\n1: Make the corn puree: In a saute pan, melt butter until it just starts to brown, add corn and toss in butter. Turn down heat to low and let slow cook until corn is very tender.\n2: Add to blender and let blend until smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt. Set aside.\n3: Make the pan-roasted corn and asparagus: In a saute pan, melt butter and let it slightly brown. Add corn and asparagus and roast until it just starts to get color. Season with salt.\n4: Make the branzino: Season fish inside and out on skin with salt and pepper. Place lemon rounds and herbs inside the cavity of the fish. Spray fish with cooking spray.\n5: Grill the fish, making sure it stays in one place to ensure that skin will crisp and that flesh cooks through. Flip fish to grill second side. Once fish is cooked, the fillets should easily peel away from the bones.\n6: While fish is grilling, place lemon halves flesh side down on the hottest part of your grill. Grill until there is deep caramelization. It sweetens the lemons.\n7: Serve fish with corn puree and corn and asparagus. Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the dish.\nRoast Carrot Salad\nMakes 4 servings\nINGREDIENTS\n15 rainbow carrots, cut in half\n1/2 teaspoon ground coriander\n3 tablespoons olive oil\nFine kosher salt to taste\nFor the orange and coriander labneh:\n6 ounces labneh\n2 oranges, zested and juiced\n2 teaspoons ground coriander\nFine kosher salt to taste\nFor the harissa vinaigrette:\n2 1/2 ounces Hamsa brand Harissa or any harissa paste or sauce\n2 ounces orange juice\n3 ounces olive oil\nFine kosher salt to taste\nFor the dukkah:\n1 tablespoon coriander seed, toasted\n2 tablespoons cumin seed, toasted\n2 tablespoons black and white sesame seeds, toasted\nDIRECTIONS\n1: Make the roasted carrots: Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Toss the carrots with coriander, olive oil, and salt. Roast in oven for 15 to 20 minutes, until caramelized and tender. Set aside.\n2: Make the orange and coriander labneh: Whisk together all ingredients except salt until smooth. Season to taste.\n3: Make the vinaigrette: Mix together harissa and orange juice. Whisk in olive oil. Add salt to taste.\n4: Make the dukkah: Using either a molcajete or a spice grinder, add all ingredients and pulverize until a semi-fine grind.\n5: Assemble the salad: Swoosh labneh on plate. Place seven carrots on top, drizzle vinaigrette over carrots and around the dish, finish with dukkah over the top.\nPeach Bourbon Slab Pie\nMakes 8 servings\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the pie crust:\n2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n1/2 tablespoon fine kosher salt\n1 tablespoon brown sugar\n1/2 pound cold butter, cut into cubes\n1 cup ice water (you will not use it all)\nFor the peach filling:\n1 to 1 1/2 pounds fresh peaches, cut into wedges\n1 tablespoon cornstarch\n1/2 teaspoon fine kosher salt\n6 tablespoons granulated sugar\n1/4 teaspoon vanilla bean paste\n1 1/4 ounces Woodrow Reserve Bourbon\nFor finishing:\n1 egg, beaten\nSugar In the Raw\nDIRECTIONS\n1: Make the pie dough: In a stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, add flour, salt and sugar. Mix on slow for a minute to get it fully incorporated.\n2: Add in butter and let the mixer slowly cut the butter into the flour until it resembles sand. Slowly add ice water 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough starts to come together. The dough should hold shape very loosely, almost crumbly. Cut dough in half and shape each into a flat square. Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest 2 to 24 hours in the refrigerator.\n3: Roll each piece of dough out to just an inch or so larger all around than a quarter sheet pan, 13 inches by 9 inches. Lay one piece of pie dough on the bottom of the sheet pan and press the edges up against and just over the edges of the pan.\n4: Make the peach filling: Toss all filling ingredients together in a large bowl.\n5: Spread peaches over the dough-lined sheet pan. Lay the second sheet of pie crust over the top of the peaches and pinch together with the bottom dough. Here you can cut designs or slashes in the top to release steam. Alternately, you can create a lattice for the top crust.\n6: To bake, pre-heat oven to 375 degrees. Whisk an egg and brush it on the top of the crust. Sprinkle with Sugar In the Raw.\n7: Bake the pie for 40 to 50 minutes until golden and bubbly. Serve with butter pecan or vanilla ice cream.\nRecipes by Emily Brubaker."

      "text": "By Jonel Aleccia | Associated Press\nAt least 95 people in more than a dozen states have been sickened since January in an outbreak of salmonella poisoning tied to recalled eggs, federal health officials said Thursday.\nCountry Eggs LLC, of Lucerne Valley, California, has recalled large, brown cage-free \u201csunshine yolks\u201d or \u201comega-3 golden yolks\u201d eggs and production has been suspended. The eggs were sold in cartons bearing the brand names Nagatoshi Produce, Mishuo and Nijiya Markets. The cartons contain the code CA 7695 and sell-by dates of July 1 through Sept. 16.\nThe outbreak has sickened people in at least 14 states, with illnesses beginning between Jan. 7 and July 25, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Eighteen of those who fell ill were hospitalized. It\u2019s possible that many more people have been sickened and that eggs were distributed to additional states, the CDC said.\nAn investigation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration based on where ill people reported buying or consuming eggs identified Country Eggs LLC, as a common supplier, officials said.\nThe eggs were sold to grocery stores and food service distributors. Consumers should check their refrigerators for recalled eggs and throw them away or return them to stores for a refund.\nSymptoms of salmonella poisoning include diarrhea, fever, severe vomiting, dehydration and stomach cramps. Most people who get sick recover within a week. Infections can be severe in young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems, who may require hospitalization.\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

      "text": "A federal-state partnership that monitors for foodborne illnesses quietly scaled back its operations nearly two months ago.\nAs of July 1, the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) program has reduced surveillance to just two pathogens: salmonella and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told NBC News.\nBefore July, the program had been tracking infections caused by six additional pathogens: campylobacter, cyclospora, listeria, shigella, vibrio and Yersinia. Some of them can lead to severe or life-threatening illnesses, particularly for newborns and people who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems.\nMonitoring for the six pathogens is no longer required for the 10 states that participate in the program, though those states aren\u2019t precluded from conducting surveillance on their own.\nFood safety experts worry that the move, which hasn\u2019t previously been made public, could make it harder for public health officials to understand how common foodborne illnesses are or notice whether cases are rising.\n\u201cEssentially, CDC is backing off on one of their best surveillance systems,\u201d said Dr. J. Glenn Morris, director of the Emerging Pathogens Institute at the University of Florida. Morris, a former Agriculture Department official, was instrumental in helping create FoodNet in 1995.\nFoodNet is a collaboration among the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration, the Agriculture Department and 10 state health departments. Its surveillance area covers roughly 54 million people, or 16% of the U.S. population. The network includes Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Tennessee and select counties in California and New York.\n\u201cAlthough FoodNet will narrow its focus to Salmonella and STEC, it will maintain both its infrastructure and the quality it has come to represent,\u201d the CDC spokesperson wrote. \u201cNarrowing FoodNet\u2019s reporting requirements and associated activities will allow FoodNet staff to prioritize core activities.\u201d\nA list of talking points the CDC provided to the Connecticut Public Health Department, viewed by NBC News, cites a reason for the change: \u201cFunding has not kept pace with the resources required to maintain the continuation of FoodNet surveillance for all eight pathogens.\u201d\nThe CDC spokesperson said Monday that other systems conduct national surveillance for the six pathogens that were removed from FoodNet. For instance, state health departments are still able to report cases through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. And the CDC\u2019s Listeria Initiative collects reports of laboratory-confirmed cases of listeriosis \u2014 serious infections from eating food contaminated with listeria.\nBut FoodNet is the only surveillance system that actively looks for multiple foodborne diseases at the federal level, according to food safety experts. Other federal surveillance systems are passive, meaning the CDC relies on state health departments to notify it of cases.\nExperts worry that without active surveillance of all eight pathogens, public health officials won\u2019t be able to adequately compare trends over time or notice whether cases of a particular illness start rising. Experts also worry that scaling back FoodNet\u2019s operations could make it harder to quickly identify and respond to outbreaks.\nBarbara Kowalcyk, director of the Institute for Food Safety and Nutrition Security at George Washington University, called the decision to reduce FoodNet surveillance \u201cvery disappointing.\u201d\n\u201cA lot of the work that I and many, many, many, many other people have put into improving food safety over the past 20 or 30 years is just going away,\u201d she said. Kowalcyk\u2019s son died in 2001 of complications from a foodborne E. coli infection, and since then she has advocated for improvements to U.S. food safety policy.\nKowalcyk said that the federal budget for food safety hasn\u2019t kept up with the cost of inflation and that cuts to federal funding for state health departments have most likely made it harder to maintain FoodNet surveillance. The CDC requested a $72 million budget for food safety for the 2026 fiscal year, about the same as it has requested in years past.\nMorris said he worries that paring down FoodNet could pave the way for a rollback of food safety regulations under the Trump administration.\n\u201cIf you want to make foodborne disease go away, then don\u2019t look for foodborne disease. And then you can cheerfully eliminate all of your foodborne disease regulations. My concern is that that is the path down which we appear to be heading,\u201d he said.\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement: \u201cThe health and safety of the American people is the Administration\u2019s utmost priority. USDA, HHS, FDA, and the CDC will continue to cooperate and maintain the highest vigilance to safeguard our food supply against pathogens.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear how the changes to FoodNet are affecting surveillance on the state level so far. Morris said it will come down to whether states can finance it without CDC funding.\nThe Oregon and Connecticut health departments said they were aware of the changes as of Monday. Meanwhile, the Georgia Public Health Department said Friday that it hadn\u2019t received any official notice from the CDC. And the New Mexico Health Department said it was awaiting notification from the CDC to determine the scope of its future surveillance.\nThe Maryland Health Department said the state\u2019s health care providers and clinical laboratories are required to report cases of all eight pathogens monitored by FoodNet, so the reporting will continue \u201cregardless of changes to the FoodNet network.\u201d\nBut the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said it will need to scale back active surveillance activities for some pathogens if funding is decreased in 2026."
