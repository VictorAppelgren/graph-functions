  "content": "Welcome to HubSpot's Analyst Day here at INBOUND in San Francisco for the first time, which we love. You can totally get used to this. It's great to see a ton of familiar faces in the room here. I appreciate everybody making the trip, some courses from near and other cases from afar. I also want to extend a warm welcome to those of you joining the webcast. I'm Chuck MacGlashing, and I have the pleasure of leading the Investor Relations team here at HubSpot. I hope you all had a chance to catch Yamini and Karen's keynotes from a bit earlier. I think they did a phenomenal job of highlighting all of the innovation that we've delivered over the last year for our customers, right? Ton of new product announcements today that we're incredibly excited about.\n\nAnd of course, just why we're so excited about the year ahead. Are we getting feedback here? Okay. I'll keep going. Our safe harbor statement in all of its glory. No Analyst Day would be complete without one of these and a bunch of -- yes, just a lot",
