  "description": "The former Texas and Alabama wide receiver wasn't selected in the 2025 NFL Draft but says that's changed today.",
  "content": "\u2022 Former University of Texas wide receiver Isaiah Bond announced he is signing with the Cleveland Browns.\n\u2022 Bond went undrafted in the 2025 NFL Draft after sexual assault allegations, for which he maintains his innocence and says charges will not be pursued.\n\u2022 The Browns receiving corps is currently led by Jerry Jeudy and Cedric Tillman.\n\nWe're nearly to Week 2 of the NFL preseason and teams now have one game of film in addition to what they're seeing in practice to assess roster strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe Cleveland Browns may have decided to add another player to the wide receiver room.\n\nFormer Texas wide receiver Isaiah Bond announced on X that he is signing with the Browns. The Longhorns standout went undrafted in the 2025 NFL Draft and is a mid-training camp addition for Cleveland.\n\n\"I want to express my deepest gratitude to the Cleveland Browns for believing in me and allowing me the opportunity to continue my career in the NFL,\" Bond wrote in his post. \"Football has been my passion since I was six years old, and plying at this level is a blessing I will never take for granted.\"\n\nBond was expected to be a Day 2 pick in the NFL Draft even after a subpar performance at the NFL scouting combine. But Bond turned himself in to the Frisco Police Department for an outstanding warrant for sexual assault in April.\n\nBond stated in his post that the prosecutor has decided not to pursue charges.\n\n\"I will learn from this experience as I grow in wisdom, character, and faith,\" Bond wrote. \"On the advice of my attorney, I will not discuss the details of this case, but I want to be clear: from the very beginning I have refuted these allegations and maintained my innocence. I stand firm by that today.\"\n\nThe deal has not been finalized yet, per ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nBond played in 13 games as a true freshman for Alabama in 2022. He led the team in receptions a year later with 48 for 668 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nBond transferred from Alabama to Texas for his final year of college football in 2024. As a Longhorn, he struggled to build rapport with starter Quinn Ewers and had just 34 receptions for 540 yards and five touchdowns. Fellow transfer Matthew Golden became the top receiver down the stretch for the Longhorns and ended up as a first-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft to the Green Bay Packers.\n\nDespite the drop in production, Bond was viewed as a probable draft pick given his game speed. The off-field allegations kept him from being selected.\n\nHere's how things look ahead of Bond's potential arrival:",

Unfortunately, he may have had the worst time of them all.\nThe Miami Dolphins' 2025 seventh-round pick got the lion's share of the work vs. the Chicago Bears, giving him a first, lengthy taste of NFL action. The one-time five-star recruit and Texas Longhorn product, though, got something of a rude awakening in his Sunday debut.\nEwers went just 4-for-16 passing and was under constant duress throughout the matchup, which ended in a 24-24 tie.\nWhile the expectations are low for Ewers \u2013 and the competition even less so given preseason Week 1 \u2013 he had a debut that he may want to put in the rearview mirror soon.\nHere's how Ewers performed:\nQuinn Ewers stats today\nEwers put together a line to forget in his first NFL game action vs. the Bears:\n- Completions/Attempts: 5/18\n- Passing yards: 91 (5.1 YPC)\n- Passing touchdowns: 0\n- Passer rating: 48.1\n- Sacks: 2\n- Interceptions: 0\n- Fumbles (lost): 2 (2)\n- Rushing yards (attempts): 0 (0)\nEwers was the third quarterback on the field for the Dolphins following starter Tua Tagovailoa and Zach Wilson, getting most of the passing work. He played with backups, so the less-than-great performance wasn't entirely on his shoulder pads.\nStill, Ewers showcased a lack of anticipation on some throws and took two inopportune strip sacks, including one while the Miami offense was backed up near its goal line.\nThat all makes for a painful performance to forget for the rookie. He'll likely get another bite at the apple when the Dolphins take on the Detroit Lions on Saturday, Aug. 16.\nAs the saying goes, it's only up from here for the Dolphins' seventh-rounder."
