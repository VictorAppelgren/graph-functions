  "content": "Here's What To Do If Your MacBook's Keyboard Is Wearing Off (And Why It Happens)\n\nShiny keycaps on a keyboard are a common sight, especially on a MacBook that has been used for a while. This is not the new kind of \"shiny\" we're talking about, and it's usually not good news. If you've witnessed it on your Apple laptop's keyboard, alongside worn-off letters on a few keys, you're not alone. I've seen it happen on the first MacBook I got all the way back in 2017, and it is pretty evident on the M3 MacBook Air I purchased last year. Now, it's not an alarming situation, per se, but merely cosmetic wear and tear. Unfortunately, your Apple Care+ subscription won't fix it. So, what's the fuss all about? When you open a new Apple laptop, the keycaps are matte. It's not exactly rough or grippy for your fingertips, but the keycap surface lacks sufficient friction to prevent your fingers from slipping or feeling sticky due to sweat or grease. But over time, the top layer slowly wears off. As a result, the black keycaps begin to appear shiny, and in some cases, the printed letters also start to fade. how can i prevent my macbook keyboard from becoming like this? pic.twitter.com/13cwaBG2Vj The more heavily a keyboard is used, the quicker its keycaps start appearing smoothened or shiny on the top. And if you have long nails or your keycap stroke involves the fingertips sliding off strongly, the painted letters will also wear off faster. For bloggers, writers, and researchers, it's a fairly common \u2014 and deeply undesirable \u2014 sight.\n\nLet's address the most important doubt first. Will AppleCare+, on the new AppleCare One service, cover a worn-off keyboard? No. Apple says its insurance policy bundle does not cover \"normal wear and tear\" and \"cosmetic damage (like scratches) which does not affect the functionality of the device.\" So, unless the key(s) on your MacBook have stopped responding or hampering your usage at a hardware level, Apple won't do anything about a worn-out MacBook keyboard. If you absolutely can't stand the sight of a keyboard with a shiny patch and faded letters on the keycaps, your only option is to get a full keyboard replacement done by Apple, or try a third-party shop where you can test your luck and check if they have a spare set lying around to replace the old keycaps. You can estimate the cost of a keyboard replacement on Apple's Mac Repair and Service dashboard. Is there a more convenient solution? Yes. You can buy a set of keycap stickers, which come in transparent and opaque colors. Depending on the brand you choose, you can opt for a set with a matte surface finish or select one of the artistic sets featuring printed figures and meme material. Keyshorts has a lovely selection of MacBook keyboard stickers. They come with a two-year warranty and do not impede the backlighting, as well. Moreover, they don't leave an imprint on the screen when the lid of your MacBook is shut. On Etsy, you can find a wide range of artistic decal sets that look lovely.\n\nGo all in with membrane covers If you're seeking a more holistic solution to protect your MacBook from the issues of shiny keys and worn-out letters, consider investing in a rubberized membrane layer that covers the entire keyboard deck, preventing liquid and dust ingress. On Amazon, you can find a wide range of keyboard covers for a variety of MacBook Air and Pro models that have made it to the market in the past few years. Uppercase, Mosiso, and CaseBuy are some of the brands that you should check out. The best part is that just like keycap stickers, the keyboard cover protectors also come in a variety of styles and colors. For folks with a modest taste, they can pick cover skins that exactly match the keyboard layout of their MacBook, down to a black color scheme for keycaps against a partially see-through backdrop. A healthy bunch of the MacBook keyboard covers, like this one by Mosiso, are spill-proof and washable \u2014 all within a $10 budget. It's made out of soft silicon, and thanks to a thickness of just 0.3mm, it won't impede the closing and opening of the MacBook's lid, nor will it impede the typing experience. In my experience, it takes a bit of time getting used to typing on a rubberized membrane layer atop the MacBook's keyboard. While Mosiso's covers come in a variety of colors, too, I prefer the multi-color CaseBuy cover, which also features a neat blocky design and printed shortcuts, too.",

      "text": "AppleCare+ Is Changing For The Worse, And It Could Cost You\nApple is making a major change to the way it offers device servicing and theft security coverage with its Apple Care+ bundle for iPhones. The company is going all-in with a subscription model, ending the upfront payment system that used to be sold via its brick-and-mortar stores and the mobile app. \"If the customer asks, AppleCare+ with recurring payments is no longer available for iPhone,\" Apple was quoted as saying by Bloomberg. And it's going to be slightly pricier, as well. MacRumors first reported a price hike of 50 cents for standard AppleCare+.\nNotably, Apple Care+ is no longer available as a standalone offering from all the purchase points. Instead, Apple now only sells the pricier tier called AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss for iPhones. Apple Care+ mainly offered unlimited incidents of accidental damage protection. The Theft and Lost package, on the other hand, also covers two incidents of theft or loss coverage per year, in addition to the standard set of Apple Care+ benefits.\nApple is still offering the two-year upfront plan, but only from its online store. The monthly plan covering the iPhone 16 Pro series now starts at $13.99, or $139.99 annually. Earlier, a two-year plan was also available at $269, which translates to a net price hike of $20, or $10 per year, on the Apple Care+ coverage. In a nutshell, theft and loss coverage is now mandatory if you purchase an Apple Care+ plan for your iPhone. For example, if you go with the monthly plan on the iPhone 16 Pro for a period of two years, it will cost you $335.76, or $279.98 if paid annually. The standard 2-year Apple Care+ plan for the same phone only costs $199 without theft and loss coverage.\nWhat else is changing for shoppers?\nApple's website now more prominently details the cost of fixing iPhone screens and other hardware damage, which is a step in the right direction. As far as pricing for the older model goes, it comes to $12.99 per month for the iPhone 16 Plus (and corresponding iPhone 15 and 14 Plus models), whereas the annual subscription tier will set you back by $129.99 per phone. The same coverage is available at $11.99 per month for the standard iPhone 14 and its direct successors, going up to $119.99 on a yearly basis.\nNotably, Apple has also ended the one-time purchase plans for Mac hardware as well. The website currently lists only the monthly and annual coverage plans for the Mac portfolio. But not too long ago, the company was also selling a 3-year upfront Apple Care+ coverage plan for its computing machines. The pricing of the annual subscription plan hasn't changed for most Mac hardware, except for the MacBook Air M2, which has dropped from $79.99 to $64.99 per year.\nDo keep in mind that you need to pay a deductible worth $149 for each such incident for theft and loss coverage on iPhones. \"AppleCare agents have been instructed to tell customers that the change is designed to lower upfront costs and prevent future gaps in coverage,\" reports Bloomberg. It is unclear whether Apple is eyeing a phased rollout starting with the U.S., or if it is focusing only on certain markets with the subscription-aligned changes. In other news, Apple has also launched a new Invites app that lets you send custom event invites with a cool social sharing twist to it."

      "text": "AppleCare One Is Here: This Is What The Warranty Plan Offers\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nIf you're budget-conscious, buying a new Apple product \u2014 such as the new MacBook Air M4 \u2014 can be a stressful experience considering its premium price tag. You may even try to save money where you can, as you select your build, sacrificing RAM or disk space to save a few hundred dollars. Choosing whether or not to purchase AppleCare+ may also be a tough decision, as it will add to the cost, but it may also save you money in the long run if the device gets damaged.\nWhile you can usually expect a one-year limited warranty when purchasing most new Apple products, this warranty doesn't cover accidental damage, which anyone with a cracked iPhone screen knows is certainly a possibility. AppleCare+ offers supplemental insurance that covers unlimited incidents of accidental damage, as well as theft and loss protection (at an added cost). Plus, it comes with a free battery replacement if your iPhone's battery health drops below 80% of its maximum capacity.\nIf you own multiple Apple products, these AppleCare+ plans can add up, but you may be able to save money with Apple's newest offering: AppleCare One. Apple has increasingly made subscriptions a core part of its revenue, and AppleCare One is its latest monthly service. Instead of adding AppleCare+ to each Apple product you buy, you can sign up for AppleCare One and have all your devices covered for a single monthly fee. This can simplify both your budget and the process of buying a new Apple device. AppleCare One offers the same benefits as AppleCare+, including 24/7 priority customer support and expedited Apple-certified service, while also expanding theft and loss protection to the iPad and Apple Watch if you add these devices to your plan. (Previously, only the iPhone could be covered.)\nHow much does AppleCare One cost and is it cheaper than AppleCare+?\nYou can still purchase AppleCare+ upfront if you want, though it's now only available online. However, you can save a decent amount of money with an AppleCare One subscription, depending on how many devices you need to cover. AppleCare One starts at $19.99 per month and can cover up to three different Apple devices that you own. You can add additional Apple products to the plan for $5.99 each.\nTraditional AppleCare+ has different fees for each product. For example, two years of AppleCare+ coverage (with theft and loss protection) for an iPhone goes for $219, while iPad coverage costs $34.99 per year. A 16-inch MacBook Pro plan costs $399 for three years. By pooling your multiple devices under a single AppleCare One subscription, you can spend less than what you'd pay for individual AppleCare+ plans for each. Apple states that AppleCare One pricing is the same for all its products. If you enroll an iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch under the $19.99 plan, you can save up to $11 per month.\nHowever, AppleCare One can actually be more expensive than AppleCare+, depending on what you're already paying for. Because theft and loss coverage is now automatically included and you can't opt out, if you're only using AppleCare One for a single iPhone and nothing else, you'll be paying more than you would for an AppleCare+ plan with no theft/loss coverage. Either way, you should also remember that both plans, like traditional insurance, include deductibles you'll also need to pay for in the event of any damage, which also vary per device. A standard Apple Watch has a $69 deductible, for example, while a Mac display has a $99 deductible.\nCan you use AppleCare One for older devices you already own?\nAnother benefit of AppleCare One is that you will be able to add Apple products you already own to your coverage, whether they are one of the three included with the $19.99 plan or a $5.99 additional device. Traditionally, AppleCare+ could only be added to a device within 60 days of purchasing it. With AppleCare One, you can now add older devices that you may not have already covered for any number of reasons, like saving money at the time of purchase. Devices up to four years old can be added to your AppleCare One subscription, provided they are in good condition.\nYou can also move your devices in and out of AppleCare One whenever you want. If you feel an aging Apple Watch is no longer worth covering, you can remove it. If you realize your new AirPods Pro are at more risk for theft or damage than you originally thought, you can immediately add them to your plan.\nThis also makes replacing your Apple devices with newer ones less complicated, since you can't transfer traditional AppleCare+ to a new device (though it is technically possible to transfer your AppleCare+ plan to a new owner if you sell or give away your old device)."

      "text": "MacBook Air M3 Review (2024): Fantastic When You Need It, Expensive If You Don't\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nWhen Apple launched the M2 MacBook Air in 2022, it redefined the concepts of an entry-level macOS laptop, with all its lingering frustrations in tow. \"There's just a lot more to enjoy here,\" surmised SlashGear's review of the machine. In many ways, it was ahead of the M1 MacBook Air, while still being bogged down by Apple's historically stingy hardware approach with even the most fundamental components of a computer, such as RAM and storage.\nIn 2024, we enter yet another Apple generation where design remains unchanged, the innards get a selective uplift, and performance comparisons are proudly made against phased-out Intel-based MacBook Air trims. It makes sense, and then doesn't, especially if you have set your eyes on a new machine and want meaningful generation-over-generation upgrades.\nThe M3-powered MacBook Air, unfortunately, falls in that controversial class. On its own, however, it comes out swinging as a terrific computing machine, one that goes against the best in the Windows ecosystem and demolishes them at metrics like battery life. It's an oddly pleasant laptop, but whether you should splurge on it depends squarely on the PC in your backpack, more so with the M3 generation than ever.\nWe tested the entry-level configuration that comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB onboard storage. The M3 chip on this one packs eight CPU and an equal number of GPU cores. The higher-end variant increases the number of GPU cores to ten and also throws the 35W dual USB-C port adapter into the retail package. This device has a 13.6-inch liquid retina panel (2560 by 1664 pixels) with a peak brightness of 500 nits. It's the same as the M2 version, but on its own, it's one of the nicest LCD panels on a laptop out there.\nDesign and build\nAesthetics and build quality are two areas where the latest 13-inch MacBook Air stands out. Over the past couple of years, I've tested a healthy portfolio of Windows laptops, and the only two that even come close to the Apple offering are the Microsoft Surface Laptop and Dell's XPS Plus. The overall profile is still delightfully slim and extremely well-built. We have the Midnight trim for review, which is more or less a dark shade of navy blue, and arguably the best color Apple has ever picked for its laptops. It's just dreadfully disappointing that this shade picks up smudges and fingerprints in no time.\nThe aluminum chassis is reassuringly solid, with no flex to be seen on the keyboard deck and there isn't any wobbling on the display pane either. The hinge offers just the right amount of resistance, and this might sound like an under-appreciated perk of owning a laptop, but you can lift open the lid with one hand without any struggles. The keyboard is well-spaced with a subtle inward curve on the keycaps. Typing on it is a breeze, but it's a tad bit stiffer compared to the Lenovo ThinkPads, or what HP and Asus have been serving on the Spectre and ZenBook portfolio, respectively.\nThe feedback is satisfactory, and it doesn't take long to hit the usual typing cadence on the MacBook Air's keyboard. The trackpad is generously large and lives up to Apple's standards, offering a desirable mix of accuracy and fluidity. Unfortunately, the port situation is tight-fisted, once again, as you only get a pair of USB-C (Thunderbolt 4) ports, both placed on the left edge. If you seek to take advantage of the MacBook Air's newfound ability to drive two external monitors simultaneously, prepare to live the dongle life.\nNo-compromise perfomance workhorse\nThe MacBook Air is a stunningly good machine, as long as you know the limits of its computing power and not pushing it at tasks that demand something more than an \"Air\" branding. In fact, the M3-powered entry-level configuration delivered a day-to-day performance that visibly outclassed most high-end Windows machines I've tested recently. I am not going to nitpick why Apple keeps comparing the performance gains with the M1 or Intel-powered machines when the M3 easily tears into the Intel Core i7 territory without breaking a sweat.\nFor my latest workflow \u2014 which involved 29 Chrome tabs (none put to sleep mode), a separate window for Docs, Gmail web instance in the dock, and apps like Messages, Slack, Safari, Teams, Asana, Trello, and Apple Music \u2014 the MacBook Air simply breezed through it all. At no point did I experience any delays or apps crashing due to resource load.\nWhen I pushed \"Death Stranding\" (1080p resolution, MetalFX Performance), the frame rate barely ever dipped below the 90fps mark. The generative AI-based editing features in Adobe Photoshop were faster on the M3 Macbook Air, and similar was the case with a short 4K video export with a LUT overlaid on top.\nSurprise improvement, with a caveat\nEven compared to M1 at graphics and compute benchmarks, the M3 consistently outpaces it by a 20-30 percent margin. At a few GPU-driven tests, the M3 maintained a similar lead over the M2, which surprised me. The only problem is throttling, and as you up the workload ante beyond what the trusty MacBook Air is supposed to do, you really start missing facilities like an internal fan, more memory, and a few added cores here and there.\nPlus, heavy workloads usually demand more storage. Even a title like \"Resident Evil 4\" will take up over 60GB storage on first install, leaving an even smaller incentive for picking up the 256GB base storage model if you really seek to push it for work and play.\nOn the 256GB M2-powered MacBook Air from 2022, Apple served a single NAND storage drive that was noticeably slower than configurations 512GB or higher. As a result, both the read and write speeds averaged in the 1,500 MB/s territory. The 2024 version addresses that situation quietly and in a rather empathic fashion. Running Blackmagic's Disk Speed Test with a load size of 5GB, the M3 MacBook Air's SSD consistently delivered read speeds north of 2500 MB/s.\nThe storage situation, complemented by the M3 silicon's gains, are all welcome traits. But that is somewhat undone by how well the M2 MacBook Air performs \u2014 and how well the M1 MacBook Air continues to hold its own. That leaves little reason to pick up the M3 MacBook Air if you already own an M1 or M2-powered version. The most notable practical benefit here would be the added assurance of a few more years of software updates with the M3 machine.\nThe AI boost situation\nWith the M3 MacBook Air, Apple is hawking the promise of the \"world's best consumer laptop for AI,\" thanks to an improved 16-core Neural Engine, accelerators dedicated to machine learning tasks, and the silicon's unified memory architecture. Touting a 40% boost in AI performance, the company further adds that it can run some large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models on-device. Normally I wouldn't automatically benchmark a laptop for AI specifically, but since Apple's made such claims, it's time to jump in.\nTo test the M3's AI mettle, I ran a Python script that uses a machine learning technique called Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) regression to predict the quality of red wine based on certain characteristics fed as CSV data. The process involved training and testing the model, while the configuration chore was handled by the \"tanh\" activation function and the \"sgd\" (Stochastic Gradient Descent) solver. The objective is to predict the quality of wine, while the performance is based on the execution time. At this task, the M3 proved to be 20% faster than the M2 silicon.\nNext, I tested native image segmentation and generation capabilities, which employed the K-means clustering algorithm in an unsupervised learning pipeline. The task involves feeding a test image, which is segmented into different clusters based on the pixel colors and then converted into a two-dimensional array of RGB (red, blue, green) pixels to prepare it for clustering. Using color similarity as the cohesive block, the code creates a new segmented image by using the color clustering formula. Here, the M3-powered MacBook Air raced ahead of the M2 version by a margin of over 22% at the pace of execution.\nThe bad RAM and storage situation\nThe aforementioned AI performance tests only give a rough idea that the M3 brings AI chops to the table, but that doesn't mean you should buy the new MacBook Air to handle heavy AI workloads. As long as the AI features are tethered to the cloud and you have a fast internet connection \u2014 say for using tools like GPT-4, Stable Diffusion, or GitHub Copilot \u2014 the M3 MacBook will fly. But as you shift to on-device workflows for machine learning-based tasks like localized model training and generation, you will need more firepower.\nThat firepower doesn't only mean a Pro or Max tier silicon is crucial alongside internal fans \u2014 which the M3 MacBook Air lacks \u2014 but also a lot more RAM and a few hundred gigabytes of onboard storage. And that's where Apple plays it penurious. The base model M3 MacBook Air still comes with 8 gigs of RAM and 256GB of storage. That's an almost criminal undercutting for a machine that starts at $1,099 in the US, and more elsewhere. I paid close to $1,400 for this configuration, which also condemned me to the M3 variant with an 8-core GPU, instead of the 10-core version.\nThe cost of doubling the RAM to 16GB and bumping the storage to 512GB is $200 each. On the other hand, to perform image processing tasks that incorporate large datasets (i.e., medical image processing, video analysis for traffic surveillance, smart IoT, etc.) the requirement for high-core GPU is necessary. GPU enables faster parallel processing, accelerating training and inference tasks in machine learning, and deep learning models that require numerous iterations of forward or backward passes through neural networks for complex mathematical operations.\nThe hike doesn't make sense\nBy the time you muster enough courage and go with a higher-specced configuration of the MacBook Air to meet those demands, you've already landed in the M3 MacBook Pro territory, which offers an amazing 120Hz mini-LED screen, more storage, better speakers, a wider selection of ports, longer battery life, faster charging, and excellent thermal management. A refurbished unit of the M2 generation MacBook Pro could offer an even more compelling alternative than spending up on the 13-inch M3 MacBook Air \u2014 it's no sub-$1k OLED laptop, but it's still pretty good.\nFor demanding workloads, the MacBook Pro, even in its entry-point configurations offers a much better value in practically meaningful ways. AI workloads or creative tasks like video editing, all of it is going to fan out much better due to the compound effect of \"Pro\" grade innards compared to what you will experience on the MacBook Air. That extends to gaming, as well.\nI launched \"Resident Evil's\" macOS port and was surprised to see it running the game at MetalFX Quality preset, full-HD resolution, and 120fps frame rate. Yes, there were frame hiccups and you really have to work on the graphics vectors to get the best visual fidelity, but in doing so, the MacBook Air runs hot.\nI toned things down to the native resolution, 60fps frame rate, and Metal FX Performance preset while adjusting the shadow and light behavior. I noticed that as the resource load breaches the 80 percent mark, the lack of fans becomes evident and throttling happens rather quickly. It got so bad that after merely 20 minutes of gameplay, \"Resident Evil 4\" crashed. In a nutshell, all that talk of PC-grade gaming on Mac only holds sense for the top-end Apple computing hardware, and not the MacBook Air.\nBattery life\nApple touts up to 18 hours of battery life for the M3 generation MacBook Air. I couldn't quite reach those figures, but the results still outclass Windows laptops by a healthy margin. With a fairly demanding app multitasking workflow, I left home with 40% battery life and returned after a four-hour work session with 10% battery still in the tank. And if you can afford it, the low power mode can further stretch how long the laptop can go without you reaching for a power outlet. I've not used many machines that can assuage my battery anxiety such as the M-class MacBook Air trims or a handful of Intel Evo machines from Dell and HP.\nBut if I were to make a direct comparison, the latest 13-inch machine from Apple still retains a healthy lead, and that can be attributed to how well-optimized the power uptake and performance is for its in-house silicon. But not everything is rosy here, even though the color-matched charging cable is a lovely design touch. Apple still packs a 30W charger with the MacBook Air's base model.\nIt's laughably infuriating that by just picking up the M3 variant with a 10-core GPU and doubling the storage, you get the 35W charger with two USB-C ports. It's uniquely Apple that it can lock a mere 5W charging speed boost behind GPU and storage upgrades. Or, you cough up an extra $20 for this particular power brick. There's also a 70W single port charger on the table, but that costs an additional $20, as well. In hindsight, all of it collectively ties into Apple brazenly nudging buyers into paying more for the higher-end variants so that they can get marginal benefits in a few other areas.\nFinal words: Weirdly amazing\nThe MacBook Air with the M3 chip is a fantastic laptop. I'd call it boringly good because it gets almost everything right that you would expect from a sleek ultrabook. Plus, it pushes the extra mile at battery longevity, sustained performance, and the reliability of macOS Sonoma. If you know your workflow and the Pro model is a definite overkill for you, even the $1,099 base model (with an external SSD strapped to it) will last you for years.\nApple, for some reason, wants to push this laptop's AI capabilities \u2014 which seems like a fashionable-buzzword thing, whereas the device currently remains the benchmark ultrabook. But saying that isn't as topical or attractive as focusing on AI \u2014 and Apple's already been promising that the MacBook Air's been on top of the pile for years.\nThe biggest undoing of the M3 MacBook Air is Apple's penny-pinching attitude with RAM and storage upgrades. The machine sets a poor standard for laptops in this price bracket, and the cost of upgrades, which run into hundreds of dollars, is downright outrageous. But that's been true for a while, and Apple knows exactly what it's doing when it comes to selling hardware and upgraded hardware therein.\nIt also doesn't help that the M1 and M2-powered MacBook Air still perform admirably. Moreover, whatever gaps you see in benchmark figures won't reflect at the same magnitude when switching to the M3 version. I certainly didn't feel any life-changing gains moving from the M2 version.\nThe only reason you should consider getting the latest 13-inch MacBook Air (sold by Apple) is your Intel-based Mac is showing its age \u2014 or you want a palette cleansing away from Windows. And even while out shopping, keep an eye on the M1 version that is now going for as low as $699 refurbished at Best Buy or renewed on Amazon for around $650, or an Apple refurbished M2 MacBook Air (for closer to $850) to get the best bang for your buck."
