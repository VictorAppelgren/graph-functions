      "feedback": "Your draft is on the right track but needs tightening to meet Argos’ strict standards. 1) **Canonical mapping** – explicitly state the handle (TSLA) and any index references (e.g., S&P 500 ^GSPC) with a clear sign and magnitude (e.g., TSLA – 5 % to – 10 % if verdict upheld, TSLA + 5 % to + 10 % if overturned). 2) **Citations** – insert inline source IDs after each claim (e.g., (LJZYDXVL3) after the verdict, (B1KYJ1GPU) after earnings, (5GZPY1XUE) after AI‑spending). 3) **Catalyst window** – phrase the catalysts with dates: “appellate decision in 10–14 days (LJZYDXVL3), NHTSA update next week (LJZYDXVL3), Q2 earnings first week of September (B1KYJ1GPU).” 4) **Causal path** – explicitly link each catalyst to the price move (e.g., verdict → legal‑risk premium → TSLA price). 5) **Magnitude ranges** – give explicit ranges for all handles (TSLA, ^GSPC, ^NDX, etc.) and sign. 6) **Remove drift** – trim the Nvidia/AI paragraph to a single sentence that ties AI spending growth to Tesla’s long‑term narrative. 7) **Actionable language** – end with a concise recommendation (e.g., “Short‑term bias: short TSLA if verdict upheld; hold if verdict overturned; monitor NHTSA and earnings”). 8) **Formatting** – keep the paragraph under 200 words, use bullet‑style points if needed, and ensure every claim has a source. This will satisfy the acceptance gate and provide a defensible, actionable view for top macro PMs.",
