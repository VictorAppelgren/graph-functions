      "summary": "Malik Beasley, a Detroit Pistons guard, is under federal investigation for alleged gambling on NBA games, which halted his talks for a three‑year, $42 million contract that the Pistons had planned to use their non‑taxpayer mid‑level exception. The Pistons instead signed Caris LeVert, exhausting that exception and limiting Beasley to a maximum $7.2 million one‑year deal under the team's non‑Bird rights. Other teams with available exceptions—such as the Nets, Wizards, Bulls, and Kings—could outbid Detroit, while Beasley’s attorneys claim he is no longer a target of the investigation, potentially reopening free‑agency options. The situation leaves Beasley uncertain whether to re‑sign with Detroit for a lower salary or pursue offers from other franchises that can afford a higher pay‑grade.}",
