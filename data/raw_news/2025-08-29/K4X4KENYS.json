  "title": "This Little-Known Social Security Trick Could Boost Your Benefits by Hundreds of Dollars per Month",
  "description": "Nearly 75% of Americans are unaware of this Social Security move.",
  "content": "Social Security can make or break retirement for millions of retirees. Without it, around 16 million Americans age 65 and older would be living below the poverty line, according to 2023 data from the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nIf you plan to rely on your benefits even slightly in retirement, it's wise to ensure you're maximizing them. And there's one Social Security move roughly three-quarters of U.S. adults don't know that could supercharge your monthly payments.\n\nWhen it comes to how much you'll receive in Social Security benefits, everything from your income to the length of your career to your marital status can affect the size of your checks. But one of the most important factors influencing your payments is the age you begin claiming.\n\nYou can file for Social Security beginning at age 62, but to receive the full amount you're entitled to based on your work history, you'll need to wait until your full retirement age (FRA).\n\nFiling at 62 will reduce your payments by up to 30% compared to what you'd receive by filing at your FRA. These reductions are permanent, too, making your claiming age one of the most important retirement decisions you'll make.\n\nOne move that could boost your payments\n\nHeading into retirement, it's wise to think carefully about whether you want to file early or wait. But there's good news for those who file early and change their minds: You get one chance for a do-over.\n\nWithin the first 12 months of claiming, you can withdraw your application for benefits to reverse your decision. Only 26% of U.S. adults know that this is an option, according to a 2025 survey from the Nationwide Retirement Institute. Of the 15 most common Social Security misconceptions revealed in the report, reversing your claiming decision was the most misunderstood by participants.\n\nReversing your decision can be a smart move in some cases. For example, if you file at age 62 but then decide to go back to work, you may want to delay benefits until you retire later. Or if you simply regret your choice to file early, you have the option to undo your decision and file later.\n\nThe benefit difference between filing early and delaying is often substantial. At age 62, for example, the average payment among retired workers is around $1,342 per month, according to 2024 data from the Social Security Administration. To compare, the average payments at ages 67 and 70 are around $1,930 per month and $2,148 per month, respectively.\n\nNot everyone can withdraw their application, as you'll need to do it within 12 months of filing while also repaying any benefits you've already received. But if you file early and then change your mind, reversing your decision and delaying benefits could transform your monthly income.\n\nThe case for claiming early anyway\n\nIf your primary goal is to maximize your monthly income, delaying claiming until age 70 is perhaps the best way to achieve that. Similarly, if you're planning to work late into your 60s or 70s, it may not make sense to file for benefits before you retire.\n\nFor some retirees, though, claiming early can be a smart decision. If you're forced into an early retirement due to job loss or health issues, for example, having an extra source of income can make retirement more affordable -- especially if your personal savings are falling short.\n\nFiling early can also be smart for those who simply don't want to bet on their longevity. Health issues can pop up unexpectedly, and claiming in your early 60s can give you more time to enjoy your benefits if your health suddenly takes a turn for the worse later in life.\n\nThere's no right or wrong time to take Social Security, as it will depend on your unique situation and personal preferences. But knowing all of the options available -- including reversing your decision if you file early -- can make it easier to make the best choice for your retirement.",

      "text": "About the Author\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\nInvest better with The Motley Fool. Get stock recommendations, portfolio guidance, and more from The Motley Fool's premium services.\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\nYou probably expect to get some money from the government in retirement, but how much you get depends on the Social Security benefits formula. Many don't understand how this formula works or when it applies, but it's not too difficult to figure out as long as you're comfortable with some basic arithmetic. Below, we'll break it down step by step so you can better estimate how much money you'll get from the program.\nThe Social Security benefits formula is what the government uses to determine your primary insurance amount (PIA). That's the benefit you're entitled to if you sign up at your full retirement age (FRA). This is 67 for anyone born in 1960 or later.\nBefore the government can use the benefits formula, it must calculate your average indexed monthly earnings (AIME). This is your average monthly earnings over your 35 highest-earning years, adjusted for inflation. We'll talk more about calculating that below.\nOnce the government knows your AIME, it plugs it into the Social Security benefits formula in effect during the year you turned 62. The result is your PIA. But that's not always the same as your monthly benefit.\nSome people choose to apply for Social Security before or after their FRA. If you claim early, you can start receiving benefits as soon as you turn 62. You'll get more checks this way, but each one will be smaller. You can also delay benefits and your checks will grow a little each month until you reach your maximum benefit at age 70.\nIn both of these cases, the government runs an additional calculation to determine how to adjust your PIA to determine your final monthly benefit.\nThe Social Security formula for the year 2024 -- which applies to anyone born in 1962 -- is as follows:\nSo for example, if your AIME was $3,000, you would do the following:\nIn the formula above, $1,174 and $7,078 are known as the bend points. These are the only parts of the Social Security benefits formula that change from one year to the next. In 2025, they will rise to $1,226 and $7,391, respectively. You can find the bend points for any previous year on the Social Security Administration website.\nIf you simply want to know how large your Social Security checks will be if you sign up at a certain age, you can figure this out by creating a my Social Security account. But if you want to understand how the government arrived at this number, you can duplicate its work by taking the following steps:\nThe federal government keeps track of how much money you've paid Social Security taxes on each year in your earnings record. You can view this in your my Social Security account.\nFor most people, their actual income and the income they've paid Social Security taxes on are the same. But this isn't always the case with high earners. In 2024, for example, you only pay Social Security taxes on the first $168,600 you earn. If you earn $200,000 this year and your earnings record only shows $168,600 for 2024, that's correct. Your earnings record only reflects the income you paid Social Security payroll taxes on.\nThe ceiling on income subject to these taxes rises each year. In 2025, it will climb to $176,100.\nThe government uses the Average Wage Index (AWI) to adjust your wages for inflation so it can accurately pick out the years you've earned the most. You can view the AWI for all previous years going back to 1951 on the Social Security Administration's website.\nThe AWI you use to adjust your wages is the one that was in effect in the year you turned 60. You divide this AWI by the AWI for the year you're adjusting wages for. The result is your index factor. Multiply this by your income as reported in your earnings record for that year to get your index-adjusted wages.\nFor example, if you turned 60 in 2022 (meaning you become eligible for benefits in 2024, when you turn 62), you'd use the 2022 AWI of $63,795.13 as your benchmark. If you earned $50,000 in 2015 and you want to calculate your index-adjusted income for that year, you'd do the following:\nIf that's a little too much math for you, you can skip the first step and go straight to the indexing factors. The Social Security Administration keeps lists of all the indexing factors for all years. You just have to enter the year you turn 60 and it will give you the index factors to use. Then all you have to do is multiply those indexing factors by your income for the appropriate year.\nAfter you've adjusted your income for inflation, total up the income from your 35 highest-earning years. If you didn't earn income in at least 35 years, then total your income for all the years you've worked.\nNext, divide this total by 420 -- the number of months in 35 years -- which will give you your AIME. It may not be as high as you expect if you worked fewer than 35 years because you'll have some zero-income years factored into your calculation.\nOnce you know your AIME, you can plug it into the Social Security retirement benefits formula as outlined above. But remember to choose the correct formula for your age. You should use the one that was in effect in the year you turned 62 regardless of whether you signed up for benefits at that age.\nThe results you get from this step will give you your PIA. If you choose to sign up at your FRA, that's also how much you'll get for a benefit. But if you sign up before or after your FRA, there are a few extra steps to calculating your monthly benefit.\nTo do this step, you need to know what your FRA is. Here's a table to help you figure that out:\nIf you claim Social Security early, the government reduces your checks by:\nFor example, if your FRA is 66 and you claimed at 62, you'd lose 5/9 of 1% from your checks for each of the first 36 months you claimed early. So you'd multiply (((5/9) x 0.01) x 36) x 100 and you'd get a 20% reduction. But that's not all.\nThen, you have to add a further 5/12 of 1% monthly deduction for claiming checks between 62 and 63. So you'd take (((5/12) x 0.01) x 12) x 100 and you'd get an additional 5% decrease. Added together, the two steps above result in 25% smaller checks for claiming at 62 as opposed to waiting until 66.\nFor those who choose to delay benefits past their FRA, the process is pretty similar. You add 2/3 of 1% per month for every month you delay past your FRA. However, this only continues until you turn 70. After that, your benefit won't grow any more.\nThe five steps above will tell you the kind of benefit you're entitled to based on your work history and claiming age, but that's not always the same as your take-home benefit. Seniors on Medicare have their Part B premiums automatically deducted from their Social Security checks.\nIn 2024, that's $174.70 per month, but it's increasing to $185.00 per month in 2025. If you're not on Medicare yet, you won't have to worry about this until you sign up for it.\nThe final step in calculating your take-home Social Security benefit is to round your answer from Step 6 down to the nearest dollar. Even if your result from the previous step was $1,680.99, you'd still round down to $1,680 rather than rounding up to $1,681.\nEvery year the government administers a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) to help seniors' Social Security checks keep up with inflation. But it doesn't add the COLA to your take-home check. It adds it to your PIA.\nIf you want to calculate the size of your checks for next year, look at your PIA for the current year and add the COLA. For example, the 2025 COLA is 2.5%, so you'd take your 2024 PIA and multiply it by 1.025 to get your 2025 PIA. Then you proceed with Steps 5 to 7 above to determine your new take-home benefit for the next year.\nOnce you understand how the government calculates your Social Security benefit, you can use this information to boost your own benefit. For example, if you didn't know that the government based your benefit on your 35 highest-earning years, you might have retired before you worked that long. That would have resulted in zero-income years being included in your benefit calculation.\nUnderstanding how your FRA plays into your benefit calculation can also help you choose the best time to sign up. This depends on your life expectancy and financial circumstances.\nYou can use the steps above to calculate your benefit at various claiming ages. Then multiply each of these monthly benefits by 12 to get your estimated annual benefit. You then multiply this figure by the number of years you expect to claim to get your estimated lifetime benefit. For example, if you expect a $2,000 monthly check at your FRA of 67 and believe you'll live to 87, you'd have an estimated lifetime benefit of $480,000.\nThe Social Security benefits formula might seem complicated, but it's not too difficult once you break it down. You may not be able to precisely calculate your benefit if you're too young for Social Security, but keeping these guidelines in mind can help you squeeze the most money possible out of the program."

      "text": "Full retirement age (FRA) is the age when you can claim your standard Social Security retirement benefit. Your standard benefit is called your primary insurance amount (PIA), and it's based on your inflation-adjusted average wages earned throughout your career.\nFull retirement age varies by birth year. For those born in 1960 or later, FRA is 67. If you were born between 1943 and 1959, FRA is 66 and a number of months (dependent on your year of birth). For instance, if you were born in 1959, it is 66 and 10 months.\nIt is important to know your full retirement age, as it affects when you can claim Social Security without reducing your benefits. It also impacts the amount of delayed retirement credits you can earn to raise your benefits and how much you can earn from working while receiving Social Security without forfeiting any of your benefits.\nSocial Security full retirement age chart\nThe chart below shows the full retirement age for people born at different times.\nBirth Year | Full Retirement Age |\n|---|---|\n1943 to 1954 | 66 |\n1955 | 66 and 2 months |\n1956 | 66 and 4 months |\n1957 | 66 and 6 months |\n1958 | 66 and 8 months |\n1959 | 66 and 10 months |\n1960 and later | 67 |\nHow does full retirement age affect your Social Security benefits?\nIf you claim your benefits at full retirement age, you will receive your standard Social Security benefit amount. If you claim prior to FRA, you will be subject to early filing penalties that reduce your benefit by the following amounts:\n- Five-ninths of 1% for each of the first 36 months before FRA\n- Five-twelfths of 1% for each subsequent month before FRA\nThis amounts to a 6.66% annual reduction for each of the first three years and an additional 5% reduction for each following year before FRA. For example, if you claim benefits at 62 with an FRA of 67, you will face a full 30% reduction in benefits.\nBy contrast, if you claim benefits after FRA, you receive delayed retirement credits valued at two-thirds of 1% per month. This results in an 8% annual increase to your monthly benefit. You can earn delayed retirement credits until age 70. After that, there's no financial benefit in delaying your claim. Delayed retirement credits cannot be earned if you are claiming either spousal benefits or survivor benefits.\nWorking after full retirement age\nRetirees may work while collecting Social Security benefits, but those younger than their FRA will be subject to the retirement earnings test (RET). Under this test, if your earnings exceed a certain limit (which changes annually), you will temporarily forfeit some or all of your benefits. Once you reach full retirement age, your benefit is recalculated, and you may receive most of that money back.\nOther key questions about full retirement age\nThere are a few additional key points to consider regarding full retirement age.\n1. Do survivor benefits increase after full retirement age?\nIf you are the surviving spouse who is claiming benefits based on your deceased partner's work record, there is no benefit to waiting until after full retirement age to claim your benefits. You do not earn delayed retirement credits in this case, so your benefit will not increase.\nHowever, if you are the higher-earning spouse, delaying your claim for benefits until after FRA can result in your widow(er) receiving more monthly income, as your widowed partner will receive the higher of the two monthly benefits you were each receiving.\n2. Are Social Security benefits taxable at full retirement age?\nYour age does not have an impact on whether you will owe federal tax on Social Security benefits. Depending on your earnings, you may pay federal taxes on Social Security benefits regardless of the age at which you claim.\nSocial Security benefits are taxed on amounts exceeding the \"provisional income\" limit set by the IRS. To calculate your provisional income, add up all non-Social Security sources of income, including nontaxable income such as municipal bond interest, and include half of your annual Social Security income.\nSingle filers earning provisional income between $25,000 and $34,000 and married joint filers earning between $32,000 and $44,000 will owe income taxes on 50% of their Social Security benefits. For single filers with provisional income above $34,000 and married filers above $44,000, up to 85% of Social Security benefits will be taxable.\nTaxes on Social Security remain in effect following the passage of the \"big, beautiful bill\" (now law) on July 4, 2025. However, a new temporary tax deduction has reduced the number of retirees taxed on benefits because the deductions for more retired people now exceed their taxable benefits.\nThe White House's Council of Economic Advisers estimated that 88% of retirees will not pay tax on their payments as long as the deduction remains in effect.\nRelated retirement topics\n3. Is your full retirement age affected by where you live?\nYour full retirement age is not affected by where you live. Most Social Security rules, including those that determine benefit amount and claiming age, are set by federal law. However, some states do tax Social Security benefits, so where you live can affect tax levels on your retirement income. But again, the age at which you claim benefits won't affect your tax rate -- your income is the key factor."

      "text": "Invest better with The Motley Fool. Get stock recommendations, portfolio guidance, and more from The Motley Fool's premium services.\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\nSpousal benefits are Social Security benefits that are based on your spouse\u2019s work record instead of your own. In some circumstances, you\u2019re eligible for spousal benefits even if you\u2019ve divorced.\nYour Social Security retirement benefit is typically based on your 35 highest-earning years of work. But, if your spouse earned significantly more or your work history is limited, you may get more money from spousal benefits. Read on to learn when you qualify for spousal benefits and how Social Security calculates your payments.\nTo be eligible for spousal benefits if you\u2019re currently married, all three of the following must apply:\nIf you\u2019re at least 62 and your spouse hasn\u2019t started receiving benefits yet, you can take your own retirement benefit and then claim their higher benefit once they file. This is a common Social Security planning strategy for couples.\nHowever, you can\u2019t take spousal benefits and switch to your own higher benefit unless one of the following applies:\nSocial Security will give you either your own retirement benefit or spousal benefits, but not both.\nAs with retirement benefits, spousal benefits are taxable if your income exceeds certain thresholds. It\u2019s important to plan for your taxes in retirement, no matter which type of benefit you expect to receive.\nSpousal benefits are based on your spouse\u2019s primary insurance amount, which is the amount they\u2019re eligible for at full retirement age (FRA). Depending on how old you are when you start Social Security, you can receive 32.5% to 50% of your spouse\u2019s benefit.\nIf you wait until your full retirement age \u2013 which is 67 if you were born in 1960 or later \u2013 you\u2019ll qualify for the 50% maximum. But if you claim as soon as you\u2019re eligible at 62, you\u2019d only receive 32.5% of their full benefit.\nWhen you take your own retirement benefits, you can earn 8% delayed retirement credits for each year you wait past your full retirement age until you reach your benefit cap at age 70. However, you can\u2019t earn delayed retirement credits when you\u2019re taking spousal benefits. You\u2019ll receive your maximum benefit once you reach full retirement age.\nYou also won\u2019t earn extra if your spouse waits past their full retirement age. The rules are different for surviving spouses, as we\u2019ll discuss shortly.\nIf you take spousal benefits, you won\u2019t affect the benefits your husband or wife receives. Their benefit is based solely on their primary insurance amount and when they claim.\nIn the past, couples often maximized their Social Security by taking spousal benefits first and then switching to their own retirement benefits to get credit for delaying. But the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 eliminates this option unless you were born on or before Jan. 2, 1954, you have a disability and also qualify for spousal benefits, or you care for your spouse\u2019s child who is younger than 16 or has a disability.\nIf you\u2019re a divorced spouse, you may be eligible for spousal benefits. To qualify as a divorced spouse, the following rules apply:\nBenefits for ex-spouses are the same as benefits for current spouses. The maximum divorced spouse benefit is 50% of your former spouse\u2019s primary insurance amount if you wait until full retirement age. If you claim early, you\u2019ll receive as little as 32.5%.\nTo receive divorced spouse benefits, both you and your ex need to be at least 62. However, unlike with benefits paid to current spouses, divorced spouse benefits don\u2019t require your ex to actually be receiving benefits. As long as they\u2019re at least 62 and meet Social Security\u2019s minimum of 40 work credits, you can take spousal benefits if you meet the other requirements.\nIf you qualify for retirement benefits based on your own work record, Social Security will use your earnings to determine your benefits. Then your former spouse\u2019s record will be used to qualify you for a bigger benefit if applicable.\nAs with spousal benefits, if a former spouse claims Social Security using your record, your benefits won\u2019t be affected. There\u2019s also no effect on your current spouse\u2019s Social Security.\nWhen your spouse dies, you may be eligible for survivor benefits. You may also be eligible for your ex-spouse\u2019s survivor benefits if you were married for at least 10 years or you care for their child who\u2019s younger than 16 or disabled.\nSurvivor benefits are as much as 100% of the benefit the deceased worker was receiving when they died. If the person died before claiming benefits, the survivor benefit is based on their primary insurance amount.\nTo qualify for the full benefit, you still have to wait until your full retirement age. However, you can claim benefits as early as age 60 (or 50 if you\u2019re disabled). If you claimed survivor benefits as soon as you\u2019re eligible at age 60, you\u2019d only receive 71.5% of your late spouse\u2019s benefit. Surviving spouses or ex-spouses who are caring for a child younger than 16 or who has a disability can receive 75% of the deceased worker\u2019s benefit.\nIf you remarry before age 60 (or 50 if you have a disability), you won\u2019t qualify for survivor benefits. However, if you remarry after age 60 (or 50 if you\u2019re disabled), remarrying won\u2019t jeopardize your survivor benefits.\nSpousal benefits can boost your Social Security if your spouse earns significantly more than you. However, if you\u2019re employed for most of your working years, you may still qualify for a bigger benefit on your own. If you\u2019re wondering how much you\u2019d qualify for on your own record or your spouse\u2019s, you can create a my Social Security account to estimate your benefits and kickstart your retirement planning."

Social Security will not withhold money from your monthly benefit. Social Security also won't take money out of your checks if you claim early but your income is below the thresholds listed above.\nThe Social Security Administration calculates the appropriate amount that you'll forfeit and then takes it out of your monthly benefits. You'll see entire monthly checks held back by the government to cover the withholding. For example, if you normally get Social Security of $1,000 per month but you have to forfeit $4,000, then Social Security will hold back four months' worth of checks.\nAs painful as it is to lose your benefits, there is some payback. If you lose a month's worth of benefits, then Social Security treats you as if you retired a month later than you did. Once you hit full retirement age, you'll start getting larger monthly checks based on that later retirement date. You might not get all your lost money back, but the bigger checks will gradually send some of it your way.\nThere's a special rule for when you work part of the year but then retire. Regardless of your total earnings, you're still entitled to get Social Security checks for any month in which you've officially retired.\nAs an example, say you retire early at 63 and decide that you're going to quit your $200,000-per-year job at the end of June. You'd forfeit all of your benefits for the first six months of the year because of your high earnings, but, starting in July, you could still get checks for the remaining six months even though your total annual earnings were well above the annual limit.\nSocial Security is commonly seen as a source of retirement income. But you're allowed to work and take Social Security retirement benefits or survivor benefits at the same time. If you do so before you reach full retirement age, though, Social Security may withhold part of your benefits.\nBelow we'll cover how you can get Social Security benefits even while you're still working. Learn how you can keep as much of that money as possible."

      "text": "Invest better with The Motley Fool. Get stock recommendations, portfolio guidance, and more from The Motley Fool's premium services.\nSocial Security forms a critical part of most seniors' retirement strategy, so it's natural that people have questions about it, like how much do Social Security benefits increase after age 62? The answer depends on several factors, including when you were born and when you sign up for Social Security. We'll explore this in greater detail below to help you choose your best age for claiming benefits.\nThe government assigns everyone a full retirement age (FRA) based on their birth year. This is the age at which you become eligible for your full Social Security benefit based on your work history. For people born in 1960 or later, FRA is 67, although you don't have to sign up for benefits then.\nYou can claim Social Security as early as age 62, but doing so will shrink your checks as much as 30%. Delaying benefits increases your checks a little each month, as outlined in the table below, until you reach your maximum benefit at 70 years old.\nTo give you some idea of the effect this could have, let's say you have an FRA of 67 and qualify for a $2,000 benefit at 62. Delaying benefits until you turned 70 would net you about $3,543 per month. And you don't have to wait that long to see substantial changes to your checks.\nDelaying benefits by one year could increase the size of your benefit by 5% to 8%, depending on your age at the time. But that doesn't mean it's the right decision for everyone.\nClaiming Social Security at 62 means more years of benefits. This is why it remains one of the most popular ages to apply. Seniors who wish to retire in their early 60s but cannot afford to do so on their own can supplement their personal savings with Social Security to help them cover their expenses.\nSigning up early can also be advantageous if you don't expect to live long. You'll likely get a larger lifetime benefit this way. If you try to delay benefits, there's a chance you could wait too long and miss out on Social Security altogether.\nDelaying Social Security allows you to increase your monthly checks as discussed above. This could lead to a larger lifetime benefit for those who live into their mid-80s or beyond. Larger monthly checks also mean larger cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs). These are annual Social Security increases that all beneficiaries receive to help their checks keep pace with inflation.\nWhen you delay Social Security until your FRA or beyond, you also don't have to worry about the earnings test. Those who work while claiming Social Security under their FRA could lose a portion of their benefits if their annual income is too high. But the money isn't gone forever. When you reach your FRA, the government recalculates your benefit to account for the amount previously withheld and your new checks will be larger. For some, however, this is a hassle they'd rather not deal with.\nWhen you start Social Security is a personal decision. You must look at your financial situation and your life expectancy to decide the best move for you. If you plan to delay benefits, you'll need to be sure you can cover all your expenses on your own until you're ready to sign up. You might do this with a job or by relying on your personal savings.\nIt's a good idea to have a plan for when you'll claim even if you're far from retirement. Knowing when you'll apply can help you estimate how much you'll get from the program, and you can use that information to estimate how much you need to save for retirement on your own. But you have to be willing to adapt as the situation demands it.\nSocial Security's trust funds are expected to run out within the next decade or so. If this happens, the government won't be able to pay out all scheduled benefits unless it takes steps before then to address the shortfall. We can't guess what will happen right now, so we have to do our best to save on our own and adjust our Social Security strategy as needed over time.\nWhatever claiming age you choose, be sure you understand the implications of your decision. It's difficult to change your mind once you've already applied, so it's best to wait until you're confident that you're ready."

  "argos_summary": "The article explains how the age you choose to claim Social Security dramatically affects monthly benefits, with early filing at 62 reducing payments by up to 30% and delayed filing up to age 70 boosting them by 5\u20118% per year. It highlights a little\u2011known option that allows retirees to withdraw an early claim within 12 months and reapply later, potentially converting a 30% loss into a higher benefit. Current averages show $1,342/month at 62 versus $1,930 at 67 and $2,148 at 70, underscoring the financial impact of timing. The piece also notes that without Social Security, about 16\u202fmillion U.S. seniors would live below the poverty line, stressing the program\u2019s critical role in retirement income.",
