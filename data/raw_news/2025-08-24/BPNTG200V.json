  "title": "Earnings Miss: Alkane Resources Ltd Missed EPS By 19% And Analysts Are Revising Their Forecasts",
  "description": "Investors in Alkane Resources Ltd ( ASX:ALK ) had a good week, as its shares rose 4.0% to close at AU$0.92 following...",
  "content": "Investors in Alkane Resources Ltd (ASX:ALK) had a good week, as its shares rose 4.0% to close at AU$0.92 following the release of its annual results. It was not a great result overall. While revenues of AU$262m were in line with analyst predictions, earnings were less than expected, missing statutory estimates by 19% to hit AU$0.054 per share. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nAfter the latest results, the four analysts covering Alkane Resources are now predicting revenues of AU$528.2m in 2026. If met, this would reflect a major 101% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to leap 478% to AU$0.14. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of AU$528.2m and earnings per share (EPS) of AU$0.14 in 2026. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Alkane Resources\n\nThe analysts have been lifting their price targets on the back of the earnings upgrade, with the consensus price target rising 7.4% to AU$1.22. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Alkane Resources at AU$1.25 per share, while the most bearish prices it at AU$1.00. With such a narrow range of valuations, the analysts apparently share similar views on what they think the business is worth.\n\nOne way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. The analysts are definitely expecting Alkane Resources' growth to accelerate, with the forecast 101% annualised growth to the end of 2026 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 17% per annum over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 5.1% per year. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect Alkane Resources to grow faster than the wider industry.",
