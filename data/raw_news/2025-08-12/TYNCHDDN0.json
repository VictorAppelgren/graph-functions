  "description": "Match Group agrees to pay the FTC $14 million after it was sued for deceiving users into buying subscriptions.",
  "content": "Back in 2019, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sued the dating app giant Match Group, accusing it of deceiving Match.com users into purchasing subscriptions through misleading means.\n\nNow, after six years, the company\u2014 which operates popular dating apps Match, Tinder, OkCupid, Hinge, and Plenty of Fish\u2014has agreed to a $14 million settlement, as announced by the FTC on Tuesday.\n\nThe FTC stated that the $14 million will be used to provide \u201credress to injured consumers.\u201d\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, consumers were at risk of being scammed after the company sent marketing emails regarding new messages from senders it had already identified as likely bots or scammers, subsequently deceiving them into purchasing subscriptions while knowingly profiting from it.\n\nAdditionally, Match Group was accused of locking users out of their accounts after they attempted to dispute charges, and kept their money without delivering the paid services they had paid for. The company was also accused of making it difficult for users to cancel their subscriptions.\n\nAlong with the $14 million settlement, the proposed order requires Match Group to take several actions to address the issues.\n\nFor instance, the company needs to clearly spell out the details of the six-month guarantee and ensure it doesn\u2019t take adverse actions against customers who raise billing issues. It also has to provide easy ways for users to cancel their subscriptions.\n\nThe settlement comes as the company continues to face criticism over how it handles trust and safety issues. The hope is that the proposed order will help improve the experience for users.",

      "text": "They\u2019re just not that into you. Or maybe it was a bot? The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday announced it has sued Match Group, the owner of just about all the dating apps \u2014 including Match, Tinder, OkCupid, Hinge, PlentyofFish and others \u2014 for fraudulent business practices. According to the FTC, Match tricked hundreds of thousands of consumers into buying subscriptions, exposed customers to the risk of fraud and engaged in other deceptive and unfair practices.\nThe suit focuses only on Match.com and boils down to this: Match.com didn\u2019t just turn a blind eye to its massive bot and scammer problem, the FTC claims. It knowingly profited from it. And it made deceiving users a core part of its business practices.\nThe charges against Match are fairly significant.\nThe FTC says that most consumers aren\u2019t aware that 25 to 30% of Match registrations per day come from scammers. This includes romance scams, phishing scams, fraudulent advertising and extortion scams. During some months from 2013 to 2016, more than half the communications taking place on Match were from accounts the company identified as fraudulent.\nBots and scammers, of course, are a problem all over the web. The difference is that, in Match\u2019s case, it indirectly profited from this, at consumers\u2019 expense, the suit claims.\nThe dating app sent out marketing emails (i.e. the \u201cYou caught his eye\u201d notices) to potential subscribers about new messages in the app\u2019s inbox. However, it did so after it had already flagged the message\u2019s sender as a suspected bot or scammer.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\n\u201cWe believe that Match.com conned people into paying for subscriptions via messages the company knew were from scammers,\u201d said Andrew Smith, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection. \u201cOnline dating services obviously shouldn\u2019t be using romance scammers as a way to fatten their bottom line.\u201d\nFrom June 2016 to May 2018, Match\u2019s own analysis found 499,691 consumers signed up for subscriptions within 24 hours of receiving an email touting the fraudulent communication, the FTC said. Some of these consumers joined Match only to find the message that brought them there was a scam. Others joined after Match deleted the scammers\u2019 account, following its fraud review process. That left them to find the account that messaged them was now \u201cunavailable.\u201d\nIn all cases, the victims were now stuck with a subscription \u2014 and a hassle when they tried to cancel.\nBecause of Match\u2019s allegedly \u201cdeceptive advertising, billing, and cancellation practices,\u201d consumers would often try to reverse their charges through their bank. Match would then ban the users from the app.\nRelated to this, Match is also in violation of the \u201cRestore Online Shoppers\u2019 Confidence Act\u201d (ROSCA) by failing to provide a simple way for customers to stop the recurring charges, the FTC says. In 2015, one Match internal document showed how it took more than six clicks to cancel a subscription, and often led consumers to thinking they canceled when they did not.\nAnd the suit alleges Match tricked people into free, six-month subscriptions by promising they wouldn\u2019t have to pay if they didn\u2019t meet someone. It didn\u2019t, however, adequately disclose that there were other, specific steps that had to be taken, involving how they had to use their subscription or redeem their free months.\nMatch, naturally, disputes the matter. It claims that it is, in fact, fighting fraud and that it handles 85% of potentially improper accounts in the first four hours, often before they become active. And it handles 96% of those fraudulent accounts within a day.\n\u201cFor nearly 25 years Match has been focused on helping people find love, and fighting the criminals that try to take advantage of users. We\u2019ve developed industry-leading tools and A.I. that block 96% of bots and fake accounts from our site within a day and are relentless in our pursuit to rid our site of these malicious accounts,\u201d Match stated, in response to the news. \u201cThe FTC has misrepresented internal emails and relied on cherry-picked data to make outrageous claims and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims in court.\u201d\nThe Match Group, as you may know, loves to have its day in court.\nThe FTC\u2019s lawsuit isn\u2019t the only one facing Match\u2019s parent company because it doesn\u2019t (allegedly) play fair.\nA group of former Tinder execs are currently suing Match and its controlling shareholder IAC regarding what they say was manipulation of financial data to strip them of their stock options. The suit today continues, even though some plaintiffs said they had to drop out because Match snuck an arbitration clause into its employees\u2019 recent compliance acknowledgments.\nNow those former plaintiffs are acting as witnesses, and Match is trying to argue that the litigation funding agreement overcompensates them for their testimony in violation of the law. The judge was concerned that motion was a \u201csmoke screen\u201d and an attempt to \u201clitigate [the plaintiffs] to death until they settle.\u201d (Another hearing may be held to resolve this point; or the agreement may be revised.)\nThe Match Group also got into it with Tinder\u2019s rival Bumble, which it failed to acquire twice. It filed a lawsuit over infringed patents, which Bumble said was meant to bring down its valuation. Bumble then filed and later dropped its own $400 million suit over Match fraudulently obtaining Bumble\u2019s trade secrets.\nIn the latest lawsuit, the FTC is asking Match to pay back the \u201cill-gotten\u201d money and wants to impose civil penalties and other relief. While the financial impacts may not be enough to take down a company with the resources of Match, the headlines from the trial could bring about an increase in negative consumer sentiment over Match and online dating in general. It\u2019s a business that\u2019s become commonplace and normalized in society, but also has a reputation of being a little scammy at times, too. This suit won\u2019t help.\nAnd given that Match Group operates a majority of the U.S.\u2019s top dating apps, that could have a larger, trickle-down effect on its broader business.\nThe FTC suit is available below.\n[scribd id=427610538 key=key-9TqdBtNFdIACBhoS5tc8 mode=scroll]"
