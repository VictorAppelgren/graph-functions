      "feedback": "The analysis draft presents a solid overview of the current macroeconomic landscape, but it could benefit from enhanced depth and specificity. To elevate the analysis to world-class quality, consider the following actionable edits: \n\n1. **Depth and Clarity of Reasoning**: Strengthen the causal chain by explicitly linking the CPI increase to potential consumer behavior changes and corporate pricing strategies. Provide specific examples or scenarios illustrating how inflation impacts consumer spending and corporate margins.\n\n2. **First-Principles Grounding**: Incorporate fundamental economic principles, such as real rate differentials and terms of trade, to ground the analysis in established economic theory. This will enhance the credibility of your arguments.\n\n3. **Scenario Structure**: Develop a clearer scenario structure by outlining potential future states of the economy based on current trends. For instance, what would a sustained inflationary environment mean for monetary policy and consumer behavior?\n\n4. **Specificity of Catalysts**: Identify and quantify specific catalysts or triggers that could influence the economic outlook, such as anticipated changes in Federal Reserve policy or significant trade developments with China.\n\n5. **Quantification and Use of Numbers**: Integrate more quantitative data and ranges from credible sources to support your claims, avoiding generic statements. For example, specify how much consumer spending might decline if inflation persists at current rates.\n\n6. **Citation Density and Correctness**: Ensure that all claims are backed by appropriate citations from the source material, and reconcile any conflicting information presented in the articles.\n\nBy addressing these points, the analysis will not only be more coherent and compelling but also provide actionable insights for stakeholders navigating the complex economic landscape.",
