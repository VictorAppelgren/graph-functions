  "title": "Here's Why Trump Wants a Stake in Intel",
  "description": "US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick says Trump wants a 'good return' for American taxpayers. Subsidies under the CHIPS Act are 'just a giveaway to rich companies,' he argues.",
  "content": "Don't miss out on our latest stories. as a preferred source on Google.\n\nUS Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has confirmed that the White House wants to take a stake in Intel in exchange for billions in federal subsidies for the struggling chipmaker.\n\n\"America should get the benefit of the bargain. I mean that is exactly Donald Trump\u2019s perspective,\" Lutnick told CNBC on Tuesday. \u201cWhy are we giving a company worth a hundred billion dollars this kind of money? What\u2019s in it for the American taxpayer?\n\n\u201cThe answer Donald Trump has is we should get an equity stake for our money,\u201d Lutnick added. \u201cWe\u2019ll get a good return for the American taxpayer instead of giving grants away.\u201d\n\nIntel is supposed to receive over $7.8 billion from the US CHIPS and Science Act, which was passed in 2022 to bolster the domestic semiconductor industry. Although the funding included various conditions to support Intel\u2019s US factory expansions, the Trump administration reportedly wants a 10% stake in the company as well.\n\n\u201cThe CHIPS Act was just a giveaway to rich companies,\u201d Lutnick alleged in the CNBC interview. Giving the US a stake in the company is \"a worse deal\" for Intel than getting CHIPS Act funds directly, he argued. \"But when you put this money in the hands of Donald Trump, you\u2019re going to get a better deal for the American taxpayer.\u201d\n\nStill, the news has sparked concerns about the federal government sinking even more funds into Intel with no guarantee of a return. Intel itself has delayed its factory expansions in the US, signaling a lack of demand for its upcoming 18A manufacturing process.\n\nLutnick argues that the US is \"just converting what would have been a grant under Biden into equity, for the Trump administration, for the American people. But it\u2019s not governance,\" and would be a \"non-voting\" stake.\n\nThe Trump administration is preparing to announce new tariffs on foreign chips to encourage tech companies to manufacture their products domestically. The president is warning that those tariffs could reach as high as 300%.\n\nIn the interview, Lutnick also mentioned Taiwan\u2019s TSMC, which has been awarded $6.6 billion in CHIPS funding. That raises questions over whether the Trump administration will also demand equity from TSMC, which plans to build six new fabs in Arizona.\n\nEarlier this month, Nvidia and AMD agreed to pay the US government 15% of revenue from their AI chip sales to China, a move that Democrats argue is potentially unconstitutional .",
