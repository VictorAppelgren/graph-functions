      "feedback": "This analysis is dense and repetitive; restructure into 4–6 executive lines that deliver a single house view (base/bull/bear), explicit catalysts/invalidation, and a concise watch-list. Anchor the causal chain to Regime A with a single macro-anchored narrative (policy/calibration of discount rates) and show clearly how cloud/AI monetization and healthcare moats drive durable cash flows and higher multiples, attaching precise numeric anchors to each link (Azure growth 39% YoY; cloud CAGR ~21% to 2030; Shopify +31% revenue; UNH FCF yield >9% and ~3% dividend; LULU ~1.3B cash, no debt and ~13.5x forward). Rebuild the scenario structure into a three-way map with explicit triggers and non-trivial invalidation, identifying near-term catalysts/inhibitors (DOJ outcome for UNH; AI monetization pace; policy-shift signals) and clearly stating their implications for multiples and cash-flow durability. Replace qualitative prose with quantified ranges and sensitivities anchored to the sources; e.g., provide a concise bands-led view of impact on valuations under alternative discount-rate paths or AI-adoption paces, rather than generic statements. Tie every assertion to a source ID (0G3A676BP, IGP1Q4ZEJ, 9X7XOLXMH, Q7VVGNSQE, etc.) and reconcile conflicts (short-term DOJ risk vs long-run moat durability; regime-influenced capital-return dynamics across tech and energy names) within a tight watch-list. Finally, standardize names (avoid “Lulu”) and move ancillary micro-cases (Disney) to the watch-list or omit from the core 4–6 sentence brief, ensuring the 0–3/3–6 week horizons read as non-overlapping, with a crisp, decision-useful house view at the output.",
