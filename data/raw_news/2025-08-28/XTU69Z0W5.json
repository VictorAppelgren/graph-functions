  "title": "Why Dubai is the perfect solo female travel destination",
  "description": "Thinking of a solo trip? Dubai is a top choice for a safe, easy escape with endless things to do",
  "content": "Recently crowned the world\u2019s number-one city for solo female travellers for 2025, dynamic Dubai is perfect if you\u2019re looking for an easy escape for one with plenty to see and do.\n\nLondon-based healthcare consultant Jo Berry (51) has travelled solo to Dubai five times, and is a big fan of the emirate for many reasons. \u201cSafety was a key factor when I started looking at possible destinations for holidaying on my own,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted somewhere I\u2019d feel comfortable exploring on my own without constantly having to second-guess my surroundings. Dubai stood out for that reason.\u201d\n\nDubai\u2019s top ranking by InsureMyTrip among 62 global cities for women travelling alone is driven by a range of factors, including its low crime rate, ease of getting around and variety of things to do. Add to that blissed-out beach days and, for solo travellers like Jo, the emirate is a top choice.\n\n\u201cOnce I had decided on Dubai as my destination, it was all about the hotel experience. The quality, service and the little touches that come with staying somewhere more luxurious. Even on a short trip, having access to things like a private beach, good dining options, gyms, spas and so on makes a big difference. It adds to the sense of ease and enjoyment.\n\n\u201cAnd, of course, the sunshine is a big part of choosing Dubai. Being able to leave the UK\u2019s colder, darker months behind and spend some time in the sun is always welcome,\u201d she says.\n\nFrom contemporary art galleries and a diverse range of museums, Dubai is packed with cultural spaces, ideal for a mooch around in between relaxing by the beach. You can join small-group walking tours around characterful areas such as Al Fahidi Historical Neighbourhood and Deira, both along Dubai Creek, stopping in traditional teahouses for a taste of Emirati hospitality and to shop in souks, learning how to get the best deal on spices, perfumes and gold from in-the-know locals.\n\nFor solo travellers up for an adventure, Dubai also has an array of high-octane things to do, ideal for doing on your own or in groups.\n\n\u201cOn one trip I joined a yacht excursion, which gave me the chance to explore the coast and enjoy some time on the water,\u201d Jo says.\n\nAs for her next visit, Jo has a sky dive over Palm Jumeirah planned.\n\nOther options for adventurous souls include hot air ballooning \u2013 you can take one above Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve and from 4,000ft up you\u2019ll see breathtaking views across the dunes as the sun rises. You don\u2019t need to have a head for heights though \u2013 small group tours will collect you from your hotel and take you out to enjoy the captivating landscapes and stories of the desert from the endemic wildlife and undulating dunes to the tales of the Bedouin culture you're told.\n\n\u201cA desert trip with dune driving, sunset stops and dinner is one of the best things I\u2019ve done,\u201d says Jo. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019d recommend to anyone, especially if it\u2019s your first time. I was in a great group that included other solo travellers too, which made it easy to enjoy without feeling out of place.\u201d\n\nMaybe your dream solo trip is more geared towards lazy beach days. As well as public beaches where you can relax or do watersports, Dubai has a raft of beach clubs, ideal for sunbed lounging interspersed with swimming and laid-back lunches. KYMA Beach on Palm West Beach is a special but chilled out spot.\n\nKeen to socialise? Look out for ladies\u2019 days at beach clubs, which often take place midweek and can be a great way to meet new people and enjoy savings. Ladies\u2019 Day at Zenzi Beach at Jumeirah Zabeel Saray takes place on Tuesdays, and women can enjoy a discounted day pass to relax at the infinity pool and the one-kilometre beach in laidback luxury. Or hotspot Drift Beach Club at the One&Only Royal Mirage has Ladies Who Drift, a sophisticated experience where women can hang out with views of Palm Jumeirah and the Dubai skyline.\n\nFor those craving some pampering, Dubai has many incredible spas and wellness spaces, such as Talise Spa in Madinat Jumeirah. Go for its indulgent, 90-minute signature treatment as part of a blissful solo spa day.\n\nIf you\u2019re in need of a longer pick-me-up, try Taj Exotica Resort & Spa, The Palm, which offers mini well-cations where women can fine-tune their health with wellness consultations and a spa experience.\n\nFitness fans will want to know about Brrn Barre, a women-only fitness studio in hip Al Quoz \u2013 where you can book into single pilates sessions or sculpt classes during your stay. Time your visit for the annual Dubai Fitness Challenge (on this year November 1-30) for a packed schedule of fun, free and friendly activities taking place all month \u2013 think free classes, sporting events and group workout sessions.\n\nFor anyone that can feel awkward dining alone, there\u2019s no need to order room service or eat with your head in a book. Dubai has some convivial supperclubs where you can pull up a chair at a large communal table, eat incredible food and chat to fellow foodies. Creole flavours and easy conversation are on the menu at Kuv\u2019s Secret Suppers while Mesa by Kiki Alvarez serves up plant-based South American cooking. For a five-course Indian-spiced communal feast, try Ett Hem by The Curry Bureau. Expect a warm welcome and to leave feeling well fed along with new friends at all of them.\n\nOr, if you actually relish eating out on your own, you can partake in some of the city\u2019s most acclaimed tasting menus with many restaurants offering them for sole diners. Be wowed by French chef Anne-Sophie Pic\u2019s Michelin-starred cooking at La Dame du Pic. Her signature Les Berlingots ASP (dainty pasta parcels filled with 20 months-aged comt\u00e9 tomato water infused with coffee and tagette) is a thing of beauty. There is a reason she is the world\u2019s most decorated female chef.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing where to stay, Downtown Dubai is a great option. This walkable area is close to many of the city\u2019s landmarks and entertainment \u2013 including the iconic Burj Khalifa and Dubai Mall \u2013 with great places to eat on the doorstep. Rove Downtown is a good mid-range option with a rooftop pool as is Shangri-La Hotel Dubai at the luxe end.\n\nIf you\u2019re planning to spend most of your solo escape on the sand, then Dubai\u2019s stunning beach neighbourhoods are home to a range of hotels and resorts. Try Four Seasons at Jumeirah, where you can stroll out to swim or stretch out on a sunbed whenever the mood strikes. Or gaze across the water from the rooftop pool and restaurant at W Dubai \u2013 Mina Seyahi in Dubai Marina with its stylish suites and spa.\n\nSome Dubai hotels offer particular features to appeal specifically to female guests, such as Jumeirah Emirates Towers, where there are Ladies Deluxe Rooms with dedicated female personnel to attend to their guests.\n\nIn Dubai, you\u2019ll find all the right ingredients for a sun-soaked trip. The sophisticated metropolis by the sea provides unforgettable experiences, from serene safaris in the desert to dining in the world\u2019s tallest building.\n\nBroaden your horizons with a trip that takes in its exhilarating mix of record-breaking architecture, traditional neighbourhoods and white-sand beaches. You\u2019ll return home with plenty of tales to share.\n\nFind out more at, visitdubai.com",

The lower limbs are a chocolate brown to black with the exception of pure white patterns. The face and nose have dark patches and there is often a dark stripe that runs under the neck to the forelegs. In summer dark patches are lighter and often absent altogether. Calves are a uniform brown colour.\nAmong the many local names used to describe the Arabian Oryx is Al Maha. Female Oryx weigh about 80 kg and males about 90 kg. Occasionally males may reach 100 kg. In good grazing conditions Oryx may live to 20 years. In drought life expectancy is greatly reduced.\nRange and Habitat\nArabian Oryx once occurred over all or most of the plains and deserts of the Arabian Peninsula.\nBreeding\nFemale Oryx may conceive at just over 12 months old. Male Oryx may be mature by two years but in the face of competition from other males are unlikely to start breeding until at least three years. Oryx may calve in any month of the year but there is a general pattern of births in the winter period December to April. This is thought to be largely the consequence of winter rains influencing conception. Most female will calve annually, provided adequate food resources are present.\nAfter 18 months of drought females are less likely to conceive and may be unable to suckle their calves. Births are usually single with only one case of twins since the reintroduction began in 1982. Birth sex ratio is usually 50:50 (male: female) and in the wild under normal conditions the sex ratio of the population is 50:50. Gestation Period is usually about 8.5 months.\nGazella arabica\nAl idhmi, Al gazal al jabali\nN/A\nDescription\nOf all gazelle species, the Arabian gazelle is the most slender. The coat is fawn to dark-brown on the back, neck and head, while the belly and buttocks are pure white, separated on the flanks by a dark narrow band. The coat is short, sleek and glossy in summer, reflecting much of the sun's radiation. In winter the pelage is much longer, dense, rainproof and not glossy. Desert subspecies show less seasonal variations in their pelage.\nThe face has two conspicuous white stripes extending from the eyes towards the nostrils with dark-brown to black lower margins, coupled usually with a black spot on the muzzle above the nose. The male's horns are quite long (22\u201329.4 cm), while those of females are generally shorter (5.8-11.5 cm).\nDesert subspecies are only 12-16 kg, longer-legged and with a relatively longer body and ears than mountainous subspecies. Arabian gazelle can reach speeds of 65 km per hour if in danger. Their diet comprises grasses, herbs and shrubs, depending on the habitat.\nRange and Habitat\nAt present Arabian gazelle remain along the Red Sea coast and in the Asir Mountains in Saudi Arabia, on the Farasan Islands in the Red Sea off the southwest coast of Saudi Arabia, along the coast and mountains of Yemen and Oman and in the United Arab Emirates.\nArabian gazelles live in low altitude mountains, sometimes in very steep (up to 45\u00b0) terrain, but avoid rocky areas and walking on rocks. They prefer plateaus, hilly relief, foothills and valleys between mountains and open habitats or areas with light forest in gravel or sandy plains, but also occur in regions of real desert and coastal dunes.\nIn Arabia, they usually live on rough terrain of mountain beds, gorges, and rolling hills.\nBreeding\nA single fawn is born after a gestation period of around 180 days. Gazelles living in deserts can breed throughout the year, but there are two birth peaks: in spring (March - May) and in autumn (October). The life-span is 13 years in captivity and not more than 8 years in the wild.\nTracks and Signs\nRams mark their territory by urinating and defecating on middens.\nGazella marica\nAl gazal al rheem\nN/A\nDescription\nUnlike most gazelles, females of this species are mostly, although not always, hornless, while males boast long, elegantly curved, lyre-like, black horns that diverge outwards and turn back in at the tip. Interestingly, horn development in females increases from Mongolia and China, where they are almost completely hornless, to the Arabian Peninsula, where they have well-developed horns.\nThey vary in colouration between populations, from nearly white to brown with different tones of grey, red or yellow. Generally, the very light brown colouration of the back darkens towards the flanks, where it meets the white under parts in a crisp line, and the black colouration of the first two thirds of the tail contrasts starkly against the white of the buttocks. Eyes are large and black, and the ears are long. Legs and neck are relatively long and the tail is quite short.\nMales are larger and heavier than females, weighing up to 22kg.\nEndangered Status\nVulnerable.\nRange and Habitat\nThe species is now locally extinct in many regions, including Georgia, Iraq, Kuwait, Syria and Yemen, and near extinct in Jordan. A wide variety of desert and semi-arid habitats are occupied. They occur in flat and rolling areas, but prefer foothills with broken grounds, and mountain valley and plateaus, avoiding rocky cliffs, thick woody vegetation, and lands used for agriculture or intensive livestock grazing and areas devoid of gullies and ravines.\nBreeding\nGestation period is 5-6 months with most births happening between March and May. It is the only antelope in this area that often give birth to twins. The young spend their first days in shallow scrapes or under bushes until they are strong enough to move with the adults.\nTracks & Signs\nThis gazelle leaves a track much like any other in the sand and the dung is also very similar too. While Tracks left on harder surfaces are slightly longer.\nVulpes vulpes arabica\nAl taleb al ahmer\nCanid\nDescription\nThe Arabian Red Fox is similar in colour to the common Red Fox. However, it is more adapted to desert life than its parent species and is a brownish pale red colour. The throat is black and abdomen white. The lower legs and ears are reddish, with a reddish-brown bushy tail, tipped in white. Its ears are much larger, and its body is much smaller than that of the Red Fox. It also has fur between its toes, to prevent burning of the feet on the hot desert sand.\nHabits\nThis fox is a solitary animal with well defined home ranges. Its diet consists of rodents, birds, and fish as well as some desert vegetation or even carrion. They are most active at night. Their average weight is 2.7kg - 4.5kg.\nRange and Habitat\nThe Arabian Red Fox is found throughout the UAE and can adapt to all habitats, from desert to mountains, as well as the urban environment. However, it does not seem to penetrate areas such as the Liwa Desert with soft sand and high dunes.\nBreeding\nThe vixen (female fox) can have up to five cubs usually in the spring in a den dug into the sand under a bush. She will then suckle the cubs for up to two months before they start to forage with her, later dispersing to establish their own territories.\nTracks and Signs\nPawprints show distinctive claw marks and are dog-track like in shape.\nUromastyx aegyptia leptieni\nDhub\nReptile, Lizard, Agama\nDescription\nA large lizard that can live for up to 80 years and grow to 65cm in length, it has a spiny tail which it will use in its defence. They are able to changes their skin colour through the day. In the mornings, when they are cold, they are a dark grey. The dark colour absorbs the solar heat, which warms them up quickly. Once optimum body temperature is reached they turn light sandy beige which then reflects the sunlight and prevents them from over heating.\nThe Dhub is preyed upon by the Desert Monitor and large birds of prey, such as eagles, as well as by man. Bedouin considered the tail of the Dhub a delicacy which they roast over a fire before eating.\nRange and Habitat\nFound only in the UAE and Oman, they live in loose colonies on hard substrates such as gravel plains into which they can dig their deep burrows. They will then utilise a territory around their burrow to graze the shrubs and bush, as the adult Dhub is 99% herbivorous.\nBreeding\nNot much is known about its breeding. Males can be observed fighting from May \u2013 June (below centre), after which courtship of females commences\nTracks and Signs\nTheir dung is darker when fresh and lightens as it dries out. Dhubs most often leave an unmistakable track, dragging their tails as they move across the ground. The bottom jaw of a Dhub shows the bony plate of 'teeth' it uses to chew.\nVaranus griseus\nWarel\nReptile, Lizard, Monitor\nDescription\nThe largest lizard in the UAE it grows to 120cm of which the majority is its tail. Sandy in colour with darker speckling, it blends in superbly in the desert environment. One of the most aggressive reptiles in the UAE: when threatened they will inflate their bodies with air and hiss loudly. It will then use its tail in a whip-like action for self defence as well as giving a painful bite which will often become infected. The monitor is an active hunter and will eat anything it can catch and overpower; this includes other reptiles, small mammals, birds and even carrion.\nRange and Habitat\nAlthough predominantly desert-dwelling, the desert monitor occupies variety of arid and semi-arid habitats including clay steppe, savanna and riverbeds up to elevations of 1,300 meters. Subspecies Varanus griseus griseus is found from the Rio de Oro in the Western Sahara, east to Egypt and northern Sudan, its range also extends throughout the Arabian Peninsula, and from there, north to south-eastern Turkey.\nBreeding\nThe female will lay eggs in an underground burrow and leave them to hatch by ground heat. Males grow larger than the females.\nDanaus chrysippus\nN/A\nN/A\nDescription\nMedium-sized (wingspan 60mm), with orange-brown wings, bordered with black. Apex of forewings black with white bar and spots. Hind wings with black spots. Male with four, female with three on each wing. Side of the thorax black with white spots. Antennae are clubbed.\nBreeding\nMales generally have large hair pencils that release pheromones during courtship and procure sexual pheromones by feeding on several withered plants. Eggs are flattened domes with prominent ribs. Larvae will pupate underneath leaves or in between bark.\nRange and Habitats\nLarvae feed on Sodom\u2019s apples and fire bush (part of the milkweed family), which results in them being poisonous. Caterpillars and adults are brightly colored. Widespread in the UAE.\nTracks and Signs\nPupae are hardly seen, in between the think foliage of the fire bush, being small and light green and white perfectly camouflaged.\nTribulus arabicus\nZahar\nN/A\nBotanical Description\nPerennial, stems branching from base, up to 70cm high, with ascending and spreading stout greyish-green branches, woody at the base, densely hairy.\nLeaves\nGrey-green, opposite, one leaf half the size of the other, leaflets oblong with pointed tips.\nFlowers\nLarge, 1.5 to 2cm across, solitary, yellow, 5 petals, 5 sepals, on 1cm long stalk from the leaf nodes.\nFruit\nDensely hairy, with 5 unequal wings, shallowly toothed edge, underside of stems.\nFlowering\nFrom February to September.\nHabitat\nStable sand and sand plains.\nDistribution\nCommon and widespread in sandy regions.\nUses\nThere are no records of its use in the UAE.\nBubo ascalaphus\nAl Buma\nBird, Raptor\nDescription:\nThe Pharaoh Eagle Owl is a fairly large owl, its body length is around 50 cm and can weigh up to 2.3kg. Females are large and heavier than males. When adult, their feathers are cinnamon or ginger in tone, with a lower breast and belly noticeably barred. Its eyes are yellow to deep orange.\nHabits:\nThey are primarily active between sunset and sunrise, hunting mainly on small vertebrates such as rodents, lizards, and smaller birds, but also insects and scorpions. During the day, they can be found perched in trees or roosting in mountain crevices and cave entrances.\nHabitat:\nThese owls can be found in mountains, cliffs, rocky outcrops, and sand desert with large trees and shrubs.\nBreeding:\nThe Pharaoh Eagle Owl is a resident breeder in the UAE, nesting in the winter period between December and April. Males and females pair for life, having a clutch of 2 to 4 eggs at a time. In the first month when the eggs are laid, the female incubates the eggs alone while the male hunts and supplies the food. Once the eggs are hatched, both female and male share feeding duties until the hatchlings leave the nest. Nests can be found in mountain crags and crevices, Ghaf trees, Prosopis cineraria, or inside large desert shrubs such as the Broom Bush, Leptadenia pyrotechnica.\nTracks and Signs:\nOne clear indication a Pharaoh Eagle Owl is present in an area is by finding its pellets, generally containing small bones from small invertebrates and insect carapaces. Another sign of Pharaoh Eagle Owl presence is by coming upon their distinct yellowish-orange, beige, and brown feathers.\nTorgos tracheliotus\nAl Nasr\nBird, Raptor\nDescription:\nThe Lappet-faced Vulture is one of the largest vultures in the world. These vultures weigh between 6 to 9Kgs, have body lengths of around 1 meter, and wingspans of about 2.5 meters. When adult, their feathers are overall blackish-brown and their feet and legs are white. As indicated in the name, their heads and forenecks are unfeathered with loose folds of pinkish-white skin.\nHabits:\nThey are mainly active during the day, using thermals, pockets of warm rising air, to move around and detect carcasses from high up above. Capable of soaring for long periods of time, they are able to travel several hundreds of kilometres without stopping. As scavengers, they primarily feed on carrion. In the DDCR, they are frequently recorded feeding on Arabian Oryx (Oryx leucoryx), Arabian Gazelle (Gazella arabica) and Sand Gazelle (Gazella marica), carcasses.\nHabitat:\nThese vultures can be found in mountains, rocky wadis, semi-desert steppes, and desert with large trees and shrubs.\nBreeding:\nLappet-faced Vulture nests can be found on top of large flat-top trees, such as Umbrella Thorn Acacia, Vachellia tortilis, and in crevices and crags on mountain slopes. Vulture pairs build large stick nests and refurbish them annually. Usually a single-egg clutch can be found in nests, but two-egg clutches can also occur. Males and females share responsibility for incubation, providing shade to hatchlings, and chick rearing. The incubation period is about 2 months and chicks fledge around 4 months after hatching.\nTracks and Signs:\nLarge blackish-brown feathers are often found in areas where vultures congregate, indicating that the vultures preened themselves and stayed in the area for an extended amount of time. Another clear sign of vulture presence is their distinctively large, four-toed, pointed claw tracks.\nTHINGS TO DO AT DDCR\nBook our approved excursions and set off on an adventure in nature\nOUR RESEARCH\nAt DDCR, we ensure the preservation of biodiversity on the reserve through continuous data gathering and research"
