      "summary": "A massive landslide triggered by heavy rain on Sunday buried the village of Tarasin in Sudan's Jebel Marra range, killing over 1,000 residents and leaving only one survivor. Rescue teams struggled to reach the remote site amid ongoing conflict, with aid delivery hampered by fighting between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces. The Sudan Liberation Movement, which controls the area, appealed to the UN for assistance, while the African Union urged a ceasefire to facilitate relief. The disaster highlights the vulnerability of Darfur's fragile infrastructure during the rainy season and the broader humanitarian crisis amid the war that has displaced millions.",
