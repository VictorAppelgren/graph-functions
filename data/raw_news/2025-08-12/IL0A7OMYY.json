  "description": "One of the leaders of the protests against President Trump's plan to combat crime in Washington, D.C., has long been a supporter of defunding the police.",
  "content": "FIRST ON FOX: One of the prominent activists behind the protests against President Trump\u2019s move to federalize Washington, D.C., to combat crime is a Black Lives Matter organizer who has a long history of calling for defunding and abolishing the police and other far-left agenda items.\n\nIn recent days and on Monday, shortly after Trump's press conference announcing federal resources being sent to the nation's capital in accordance with the Constitution, protesters took to the streets opposing the crime crackdown, including Nee Nee Taylor, the executive director of Harriet's Wildest Dreams and Free DC's co-founder and operations organizer.\n\n\"Free D.C.,\" Taylor told protesters gathered around her on the streets of Washington, D.C., on Monday. \"This is our city.\"\n\n\"Take it to the streets. This our D.C. No justice, no peace,\" she continued. \"If we don't get no justice, they're not going to get any peace\u2026 The only violence that's happening in D.C. right now is the violence against our communities that this president is directing.\"\n\nTOP DEMOCRATS RIPPED ON SOCIAL MEDIA OVER 'BONKERS' REACTIONS TO TRUMP'S DC CRIME PLAN: 'MASSIVE LIAR'\n\nOver the years, Taylor has repeatedly called for police to be defunded and abolished on her X account, formerly known as Twitter, with the username \"SpiritOfHarrietTubman.\"\n\nIn 2018, Taylor posted on X, \"Let\u2019s [sic] clear I want to abolish the police\"\n\n\"Black Morning! I woke up like this, in my Greatness and also still having to shout to the World that we are FREE! Abolish the enslave Patrols that beat, kill and arrest Black people,\" Taylor posted on X in 2021. \"Call & demand that all Protesters be release. [sic]\"\n\n\"Ayeee! May all Jails and Prisons be abolish! [sic]\" Taylor posted on X in 2021 in response to the anniversary of Chelsea Manning, who was found guilty of espionage before being pardoned by former President Obama, being released from prison.\n\nTaylor has specifically called for the defunding of the police department in Washington, D.C., where she is now opposing Trump's move to send in federal resources.\n\nMSNBC CONTRIBUTOR RAGES AT TRUMP'S FEDERAL TAKEOVER OF DC POLICE TO FIGHT CRIME\n\n\"Wasn\u2019t the conclusion to tow cars and hold club owners responsible for violence? Being reactive and not pro active won\u2019t keep people safe,\" Taylor posted on X in 2022. \"Defund @DCPoliceDept and invest in resources that keep people safe. #DefundMPD invest in community.\"\n\n\"Access to food is a fundamental human right, yet due to poverty many people aren\u2019t afforded this right,\" Harriet's Wildest Dreams posted on Facebook in 2022. \"The state, using police, maintains poverty and therefore hunger. In today\u2019s episode of #PoliticalEducationMondays we discuss why \"Defunding Police is Food Justice.\"\n\nTaylor's group went on to slam the police in a series of other social media posts, saying it has \"always targeted queer and trans folks\" and that \"police have existed to violently protect property and its owners.\"\n\nTaylor has also been vocal about abolishing ICE, railing against the Los Angeles ICE raids in a June Facebook post. The June 9 post said the raids were \"chaos\" and were being \"provoked by this administration.\" She went on to say law enforcement \"doesn't keep us safe. Not the police, not ICE, not any system built to control us.\"\n\nHarriet's Wildest Dreams and Taylor have also both celebrated Assata Shakur, also known as JoAnne Chesimard, who was convicted in the 1973 killing of New Jersey state trooper Werner Foerster, who left behind a wife and 3-year-old son.\n\n\"Assata Shakur is a freedom fighter and political activist. A prominent figure in the Black Liberation Movement, Assata sought refuge in Cuba in 1984 after escaping political persecution in the U.S,\" the group wrote last year on Facebook with the \"HandsOffAssata\" hashtag. \"She became the first woman on the FBI's Most Wanted list. Denying criminal accusations, she embodies a symbol of resistance against racism and injustice.\"\n\nIn another Facebook post from last week, the group included a graphic with Shakur's face and a caption that read, \"Black August is a time to honor those who chose freedom, no matter the cost. We carry the stories of those who risked everything for liberation.\"\n\nTaylor posted several times about Shakur being a \"freedom fighter\" and downplayed her murder conviction by saying she was stooped for a broken taillight, ignoring her involvement in the shooting. Shakur later escaped prison and fled to Cuba, where former Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro granted her asylum. She is currently still wanted by the FBI.\n\nA flyer distributed by the Free DC Project, an organizer along with Harriet's Wildest Dreams, said that the opposition's \"guiding principles\" are: Do not obey in advance. Prioritize joy. Take up space. Be in solidarity, and organize.\n\n\"Silence is compliance, so we need to get loud, starting tonight and every night of this occupation, go outside at 8:00 PM and bang pots and pans, sing, chant, or make noise for five minutes,\" the flyer, posted on Instagram on Monday, explained.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHarriet's Wildest Dreams refers to itself as a group formed out of Black Lives Matter with the intent \"to begin the next chapter of our journey as organizers in the movement for Black lives and liberation in DMV (DC, MD, VA).\"\n\nOn the Harriet's Wildest Dreams website, Taylor is described as \"our modern-day Harriet Tubman.\"\n\nHarriet's Wildest Dream was also active in 2024 pushing back against the arrest of anti-Israel protesters on college campuses, including George Washington University in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe nation's capital in the following years has been rocked by shootings that have left innocent children shot and dead, a trend of juveniles committing carjackings that have turned deadly in some cases, shoplifting crimes and attacks on government employees, summer interns and others, including the fatal shooting of 21-year-old congressional intern, Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, in June.\n\nTrump responded on Monday by announcing that he is federalizing the D.C. police department to curb spiraling violence, sparking pushback from Democrats who have claimed crime is down in the nation's capital.",

      "text": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was slammed on social media Monday after she dismissed President Trump\u2019s efforts to combat crime in Washington, D.C. as \"unhinged\" with other top Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, receiving similar pushback.\n\"As you listen to an unhinged Trump try to justify deploying the National Guard in DC, here's reality,\" Clinton posted on X on Monday, along with a DOJ press release from early January of this year, in conjunction with Trump\u2019s press conference announcing the federalization of the nation\u2019s capital to combat crime. \"Violent crime in DC is at a 30-year low.\"\nClinton\u2019s post immediately drew pushback from conservatives on social media, including from inside the White House, with many making the case that crime in Washington, D.C. has gotten out of control.\n\"On top of being a big-time loser, you're also a massive liar,\" White House deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson posted on X along with an article headline about a D.C. police commander being suspended for allegedly altering crime data.\nPIRRO CALLS OUT DC LAWS LETTING 'YOUNG PUNKS' OFF THE HOOK FOR VIOLENT CRIMES\n\"If Hillary Clinton thinks DC is safe, she should go move to Anacostia or Navy Yard,\" conservative communicator Steve Guest posted on X.\nJeffries posted a similar reaction to Clinton on social media saying, \"Violent crime in Washington, D.C. is at a thirty-year low. Donald Trump has no basis to take over the local police department. And zero credibility on the issue of law and order. Get lost.\"\nConservatives on social media ripped Jeffries as well.\n\"A selection of headlines in our nation\u2019s capital this month,\" NRCC deputy executive director Jack Pandol posted on X along with several news headlines of recent violent crime in DC.\n\"Why do Democrats always take up for thugs, violent criminals, and illegals over law abiding citizens?\"\n\"Democrats are lining up to oppose crime being lower in DC,\" Outkick founder Clay Travis posted on X. \"It\u2019s bonkers.\"\nTRUMP VOWS TO MAKE DC 'SAFER' AND 'BEAUTIFUL' AS CAPITAL BATTLES CRIME AND HOMELESSNESS\n\"Democrats like Jeffries would rather preserve dangerous cities than admit their policies fail,\" GOP Congressman William Timmons posted on X.\n\"IN FACT, murder is the most violent and accurately measured crime, and the D.C. murder rate in 2024 was 83% higher than in 2012,\" the social media account for the nonprofit research institute Just Facts posted on X.\n\"Jeffries\u2019 stat is deceitful because it ignores the FBI\u2019s warning against \"making any direct comparison\" of its crime data over time given that \"changes in police procedures, shifting attitudes toward crime and police, and other societal changes can affect the extent to which people report and law enforcement agencies record crime.\"\nTrump said in the Monday press conference that he is federalizing the D.C. police department to curb spiraling violence.\n\"The murder rate in Washington today is higher than that of Bogota, Colombia, Mexico City, some of the places that you hear about as being the worst places on Earth, much higher,\" Trump said Monday. \"This is much higher. The number of car thefts has doubled over the past five years, and the number of carjackings has more than tripled. Murders in 2023 reached the highest rate, probably ever. They say 25 years, but they don't know what that means because it just goes back 25 years can't be worse.\"\nTrump whipped out charts showing the media that the nation's capital allegedly suffers worse crime trends than other cities worldwide, calling on them to \"take a look at numbers\" as he rattled off the data's findings.\n\"Look at these. Baghdad is\u2026 we doubled up on Baghdad. Panama City, Brasilia, San Jose, Costa Rica, Bogota, Colombia. Heavy drugs. Mexico City, I mentioned Lima, Peru, all double and triple what they are. So do you want to live in places like that? I don't think so. I don't think so. And I think the people in this room, if you wrote correctly, you'd see. Look at the kind of numbers we have. D.C. 41 per 100,000 (for homicides in 2023). No. 1 that we can find anywhere in the world. Other cities are pretty bad, but they're not as bad as that. That the way you want to live? The reporters of the world? Juvenile offenders and crimes against persons as they say, it's getting worse, not getting better. It's getting worse,\" he continued.\nThe nation's capital in the following years has been rocked by shootings that have left innocent children shot and dead, a trend of juveniles committing carjackings that have turned deadly in some cases, shoplifting crimes and attacks on government employees, summer interns and others, including the fatal shooting of 21-year-old congressional intern, Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, in June.\nTrump's opponents have cited crime statistics showing crime in Washington is on the decline. Violent crime is down 26% this year, in comparison to the same timeframe in 2024, according to Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department. Likewise, assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 20%, and homicides are down by 12%.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"This is Liberation Day in D.C., and we're going to take our capital back,\" he said. \"We're taking it back under the authority vested in me as the president of the United States. I'm officially invoking section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act. You know what that is. And placing the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control. \u2026 In addition, I'm deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in Washington, DC. And they're going to be allowed to do their job properly.\""

He also announced federal legislation to end the practice of no-cash bail, which allows judges to send suspects home from jail without them paying bail.\nThe Metropolitan Police Department\u2019s 3,400 officers will be under the command of DEA administrator Terry Cole. The National Guard troops will be commanded by Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced. Trump vowed to remove homeless encampments popping up around the city and have the U.S. Park Police remove graffiti in the nation\u2019s capital.\nTRUMP'S PLAN TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD IN DC SPARKS BACKLASH FROM RESIDENTS\u2014BUT SOME WELCOME IT\n\"He really doesn't really care about what's actually happening in D.C. On a certain level because he's not trying to get at the underlying root causes,\" Glaude continued.\nThe president is allowed to federalize local D.C. police for up to 30 days in the event of an emergency, according to the Home Rule Act which granted the nation\u2019s capital self-governing rights in 1973. Congress can lengthen the president\u2019s emergency powers through a joint resolution.\n\"Watch them, the police are standing, and they're told not to do anything under any search or this, and you can see they want to get at it. And they're standing there and people are spitting in their face, and they are not allowed to do anything, but now they are allowed to do whatever the hell they want,\" Trump said.\nTrump has long railed against what he sees as out-of-control crime in the nation\u2019s capital. Metropolitan Police Department data shows that while the homicide rate is falling, the last five years saw the greatest number of murders since 2008.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\nGlaude, a professor of African American Studies at Princeton University, claimed that Trump\u2019s announcement was just an attempt to throw \"red meat\" to his base in an attempt to distract them from the Jeffrey Epstein case.\nEpstein, a former longtime friend of Trump, former President Bill Clinton and other high-profile individuals, killed himself in federal prison while awaiting trial on sex trafficking of minors charges. Many in the MAGA world have demanded the release of the so-called \"Epstein files,\" while Trump has dismissed the affair as \"pretty boring stuff\" and denounced the \"past supporters\" agitating around it."

Taylor, who has a history of advocating for the defunding and abolition of police, argues that the violence affecting communities is a result of Trump's policies. Meanwhile, Trump claims that crime in D.C. is escalating, citing alarming statistics, while Democrats counter that crime rates are actually declining. The situation has sparked significant debate and backlash from both sides.",
