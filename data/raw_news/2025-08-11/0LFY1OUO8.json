  "description": "Porsha Williams\u2019 ex-husband Simon Guobadia was accused of failing to pay his legal bills following his loss in court, Us Weekly can exclusively report",
  "content": "Porsha Williams\u2019 ex-husband, Simon Guobadia, has been accused of failing to pay up on a six-figure debt owed to his divorce lawyer, Us Weekly can exclusively report.\n\nOn June 10, Guobadia\u2019s divorce lawyer, Onyema Farrey, filed an attorney\u2019s lien against his 5-bedroom, 8-bathroom, 15,284 square foot Georgia home, worth an estimated $7.3 million. Williams currently lives in the home after being awarded possession in the divorce.\n\nThe lien said Guobadia owed $205,884.25 for services provided on his divorce from Williams.\n\nThe RHOA star filed for divorce in February 2024 after 15 months of marriage. She asked the court to enforce the terms of the prenuptial agreement.\n\nGuobadia, 61, demanded that the prenup not be enforced due to Williams, 44, making alleged misrepresentations during the negotiations. Specifically, he said she intended to be a stay-at-home mom and had no plans to return to reality television.\n\n\u201c[Williams] failed to disclose that she would return to her employment on The Real Housewives of Atlanta as a cast member,\u201d Guobadia argued. \u201cInstead of disclosing this material fact, the Wife made it very clear to [Guobadia] (and the public) that she was leaving the television show and not returning.\u201d\n\nA couple of weeks after filing for divorce, Williams asked for temporary exclusive use of the home she shared with Guobadia. The court granted her request and Williams has been there ever since.\n\nAs Us previously reported, the divorce was finalized in court on June 11. Guobadia had been deported to Nigeria, due to immigration issues, days before the hearing.\n\nThe judge sided with Williams and ordered the prenup to be enforced. \u201cThe Court finds that the Prenuptial Agreement between the parties contains all essential elements of an enforceable contract,\u201d the order read.\n\nFurther, the order read, \u201cthe Court finds that [Williams] has been a reality TV celebrity for years, which was well known to Husband at the time of negotiating the Prenuptial Agreement, and [Guobadia] nevertheless married Wife with this knowledge.\u201d\n\nThe judge added, \u201cThe Court does not find merit in [Guobadia\u2019s] argument that [Williams\u2019] desire to return to reality television or employment in the future constitutes a non-disclosure of material fact and misrepresentation, as these terms are not mentioned whatsoever in the parties\u2019 Prenuptial Agreement.\u201d\n\nAt the hearing, Guobadia claimed his company Simcol\u2019s value went from $296 million to nothing after he was detained by ICE. \u201cThe Court finds that [Guobadia\u2019s] testimony is inconsistent and lacks credibility, especially given [Guobadia\u2019s] testimony that prior to the ICE detention, he resided outside of the U.S. for more than one-half of the year and was able to successfully run and operate the company internationally,\u201d the judge wrote.\n\nThe judge said Guobadia\u2019s testimony \u201cthat almost $297 million dollars in business value vanished entirely over the course of a few months, without recourse or recovery, strains credibility.\u201d\n\nPer the prenuptial agreement, Guobadia will pay Williams $40,000 a month in spousal support for 14 months. In addition, Williams was awarded the home but will have to pay her ex 50 percent of the equity.\n\nWilliams will have 36 months to refinance the mortgage to remove Guobadia\u2019s name or sell the home.\n\nThe deal also awarded Williams a 2021 Rolls Royce and all other cars in her name. Guobadia will also have to pay Williams\u2019 legal bill totaling $224,000.",

      "text": "Billy Joel\u2019s ex-wife Elizabeth Weber is opening up about where she stands with the famed singer after their infamous affair and nearly decade-long marriage.\n\u201cIf I wanna talk to him or if I have something to say, I am able to contact him whenever I want to,\u201d Weber exclusively told Us Weekly on Friday, August 8. \u201cBut he has a wife and he has children and right now, he\u2019s struggling with something that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s a big thing.\u201d\nIn May, Joel, 76, canceled the remaining dates of his 2025 tour after revealing he had been diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus, a brain condition in which an abnormal amount of cerebrospinal fluid builds up, causing walking, memory, balance and bladder control problems.\n\u201cSo, [our relationship] is as close as it needs to be for two people who decided to divorce 40 years ago,\u201d Weber continued, adding that \u201cof course\u201d she reaches out to her ex amid his health diagnosis.\nWeber first met Joel when she was married to his best friend and former bandmate, Jon Small. The pair engaged in a subsequent affair, which led to the band breaking up and Joel battling a severe depression that included two suicide attempts. (The affair and its aftermath were discussed in the two-part HBO documentary Billy Joel: And So It Goes, which premiered in July.)\nThe pair later reconnected after Weber\u2019s divorce and married in 1973, going on to spend nearly 10 years together before ending their marriage in 1982. Joel went on to marry Christie Brinkley in 1985, welcoming daughter Alexa Ray Joel before calling it quits in 1994. Joel then married cookbook author Katie Lee in 2004 \u2014 the pair divorced five years later in 2009. In 2015, Joel married Alex Roderick. The pair share two children, Della Rose Joel and Remy Anne Joel.\nWeber, for her part, shares a son, Sean Weber-Small, with her first husband.\nWhile speaking with Us, Weber said that her son and her grandchildren also know and are even somewhat close to Joel.\n\u201cI have my grandchildren that he knows and they know him,\u201d she explained. \u201cMy granddaughter Ella taught Bill what TikTok was and showed him what was happening. And his relationship with Sean is important to both of them.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cSo, we\u2019re not distant but we\u2019re, you know, and he lives in Florida and I live in California. But it\u2019s all good. \u201c\nWeber said that her son Sean and Joel \u201cwere very close,\u201d adding that during their marriage the three \u201clived on top of the mountain.\u201d\n\u201cWe entertained each other,\u201d she explained. \u201cBill and I worked all day long and the whole writing process was never done \u2014 in the years that Bill and I were together \u2014 was never done remotely or in [a] studio. It happened in our living room, and Sean was an integral part.\u201d\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available. Call or text 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org."

      "text": "Game of Thrones wrapped up its eight-season run in 2019, and there have been a few contenders to be the next GoT, including the prequel series House of the Dragon.\nHowever, Amazon Prime Video\u2018s upcoming miniseries King & Conqueror is giving off some serious Game of Thrones vibes, and there isn\u2019t a dragon in sight.\nThis story is based on the conflict between Harold Godwinson and William the Conqueror in 1066 for the throne of England.\nWhile only a few previews have been released so far, Watch With Us is sharing three reasons to watch King & Conqueror when it debuts on Prime Video later this year.\nThe \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Connection\nIf you thought William the Conqueror looked familiar in the trailer, you\u2019re not wrong. Game of Thrones\u2018 Nikolaj Coster-Waldau \u2014 who portrayed Jaime Lannister on the series \u2014 is playing William on this show. William is a vastly different character from the one that Coster-Waldau played for eight seasons, but the actor just seems to fit in well within a medieval setting.\nJames Norton is also leading the cast as William\u2019s rival, Harold Godwinson. The rest of the performers include several veteran British actors, including Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy, Emily Beecham, Luther Ford and Eddie Marsan. They may not be household names in America, but that\u2019s a solid cast by any standard.\n\u2018King & Conqueror\u2019 Looks Like It Has High Production Values\nAdmittedly, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of trailers from King & Conqueror yet, so our impressions may change. But even from the early look at the show, it looks like a big budget was spent to bring this show to life in a convincing way.\nEverything from the costumes to the battle scenes suggests that King & Conqueror is going all-out with its production. It may not hit on the same level as last year\u2019s incredible Shogun adaptation, but it seems very promising for now.\nThe Series Will Tackle One of the Most Famous Battles in History\nUnless you\u2019re a student of history, you may not be familiar with the Battle of Hastings. Nearly a thousand years later, that battle is still considered to be one of the bloodiest encounters in English history. William and Harold\u2019s forces met on the battlefield, and the winner went on to rule the country and consolidate their power.\nHistorical details about what happened at the Battle of Hastings are incomplete, and there are also conflicting accounts. So there will probably be some creative liberties taken with it. But we do know how it ends, and it should be entertaining to see this fight play out.\nKing & Conqueror will premiere on Prime Video later this year."

      "text": "New details surrounding the drowning death of Emilie and Brady Kiser\u2019s son Trigg, 3, have emerged following the release of the redacted police report.\nThe documents, obtained by Us Weekly on Friday, August 8, detail the events that led up to Trigg\u2019s death on May 18 after he was pulled unconscious from a pool at the influencer\u2019s home in Arizona.\nAlthough details of the security footage were redacted, the Chandler Police Report noted there were discrepancies between what the footage showed and Brady\u2019s initial recollection of events. The report also noted that the pool was unsecured at the time of the incident and that the toddler was not adequately supervised while outside playing near the uncovered pool and did not know how to swim.\nThe police report noted that Trigg had exited the home without being accompanied by a supervising adult and Brady was \u201caware\u201d that his son was playing outside alone.\nAccording to the report, Brady, 28, told officers at the scene who arrived after he called 911 that Trigg had been out of his sight for around \u201cthree minutes\u201d or \u201cfive minutes\u201d before he saw him in the pool and immediately jumped in to pull him out.\nPer Brady\u2019s statement, he told an officer, \u201cI didn\u2019t have a clock, obviously, I don\u2019t know the exact time, but it was moments, it wasn\u2019t minutes, it was moments, it wasn\u2019t that he\u2019d been out of sight for long.\u201d\nHowever, the police report also noted that the security footage did not appear to line up with Brady\u2019s versions of events. Discrepancies included how long Trigg was outside before Brady checked on him and Brady reporting instances that did not occur on the surveillance camera such as saying he saw Trigg \u201cplaying on the grass.\u201d Due to this, a second interview with Brady was undertaken.\nFollowing the second interview with Brady, the report concluded, \u201cThis tragic incident was the result of [Trigg] being in the backyard unsupervised while playing around the unsecured pool and unable to swim. It is clear from the video that he did not go into the water intentionally, rather he tripped and fell in while playing with an inflatable chair.\u201d\nThe Chandler Police Department conclusion continued: \u201c[Redacted] was in the backyard from 18:29:42 hours until Brady found him in the pool at 18:39:00 hours. He was in the water from 18:32:15 until 18:39:07. It is clear Brady\u2019s attention was divided, and he was not watching at all during the critical times mentioned. During two interviews he did not know what was doing before he fell in and did not see [redacted] struggling to swim.\u201d\nIn other statements to the Chandler Police Department, both Brady and Emilie, 26, noted that Trigg had limited swimming skills.\nBrady told police that Trigg had taken some lessons and \u201cknows how to kick his feet and swing his arms\u2026but he\u2019s not proficient.\u201d He added that his son \u201cknows not to go in the water without us.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Emilie also confirmed Trigg had taken some lessons but \u201cdidn\u2019t fully know how to swim.\u201d She added he knew \u201chow to swim to us and he knew how to climb the wall, but where he fell in there was no wall.\u201d\nThe documents also noted that there was no cover securing the pool at the time of the incident. Brady and Emilie both noted they usually use a \u201cKatchakid\u201d safety net, but this was not in place at the time of the incident. In addition, the documents noted there were four access doors to the backyard and the alarm systems did not sound on any of them, none were self-closing and one appeared to be malfunctioning.\nThe Chandler Police Department also included its reasons for submitting the case to Maricopa County Attorney\u2019s Office for a review into child abuse with criminal negligence claims.\n\u201cThis conclusion is based on several factors. Brady knew the pool net was not on the pool. He knew [redacted] was in the backyard and didn\u2019t know how to swim. According to video evidence, [redacted] was in the backyard unsupervised for more than nine minutes, and in the water for about seven of those minutes,\u201d the report read. \u201cBrady\u2019s statements do not match what is seen on the video; he did not accurately describe one thing did after he went outside. This leads to the conclusion that Brady was not aware of what was doing and was not watching him. The combination of these factors led to drowning, and a remedy to any of the contributing circumstances could have prevented the outcome.\u201d\nThe Maricopa County Attorney\u2019s Office released a statement on July 25, announcing Brady will not face child abuse charges due to there being \u201cno likelihood of conviction\u201d following review of the evidence.\n\u201cEvery case submitted to the Maricopa County Attorney\u2019s Office is evaluated using the same standard: whether there is a \u2018reasonable likelihood of conviction,\u2019\u201d the statement continued. \u201cAfter careful review of the evidence submitted by Chandler PD, it was determined this case does not meet that standard. MCAO\u2019s review of the case involved the attorneys assigned to it, along with highly experienced senior attorneys and the County Attorney herself.\u201d\nBrady\u2019s attorney Flynn Carey responded to the update in the case via a statement shared with multiple outlets at the time.\n\u201cWe are grateful to law enforcement and the county attorney for conducting a thorough investigation and confirming that this was a tragic accident,\u201d the statement read.\u201cBrady remains in the midst of the grieving process and is thankful to be with his family as they heal together. We appreciate the compassion and support shown during this difficult time.\u201d"

      "text": "Porsha Williams\u2019 ex-husband Simon Guobadia is not done fighting the Real Housewives of Atlanta star in court, telling Us Weekly that he has no \u201cdesire\u201d to see her benefit from his decades of hard work.\nGuobadia, 61, who is living in Dubai after being deported from the United States earlier this month, spoke to Us after People published an exclusive interview with Williams, 44, and weeks after the court sided with the Bravo star by enforcing the prenuptial agreement they signed before walking down the aisle.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve had a prenuptial agreement,\u201d he told Us. \u201cIn past relationships, the agreements were honored and never challenged, largely because they were approached with mutual respect and without animosity. In contrast, this situation has been marked by an unprecedented level of disrespect and dishonesty. Porsha\u2019s actions appear designed to trigger financial provisions in the prenup by manufacturing grounds for divorce \u2014 thereby causing direct harm to my businesses, my name, and my family.\u201d\nGuobadia claimed that \u201cPorsha initiated divorce proceedings in a manner I believe was entirely dishonest\u201d in February 2024.\u201cWhat unfolded was a calculated and elaborate scheme \u2014 crafted for a story line \u2014 to rejoin the Bravo RHOA franchise by targeting and damaging the legacy I\u2019ve spent 43 years building in the United States.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cFor 35 of those years, I\u2019ve had no issues with the law, and have instead dedicated myself to sustained professional work, successful business ventures, and longstanding support of the Atlanta community.\u201d\nHe told Us he plans to appeal the decision.\nHe said, \u201cI will continue to challenge the validity of this prenuptial agreement through every legal avenue available to me, especially as long as Porsha continues to seek its enforcement.\u201d\n\u201cLet me be clear: I have no desire \u2014 whether in life or in death\u2014for Porsha or her family to benefit from the wealth I\u2019ve built through 43 years of hard work, particularly at the expense of my own children,\u201d the businessman added.\nIn her sit-down, the reality star told People spoke fondly of her time with Guobadia and claimed he was a \u201csafety net\u201d after being hurt in previous situations.\nShe claimed that she confronted Guobadia after learning about his immigration issues. Williams said she told him not to travel, but he refused.\nWilliams told People that she hired an immigration lawyer to handle her ex\u2019s \u201ccomplex\u201d issues with his legal status in early 2024.\nShe said she later tried to bring in attorneys to deal with paperwork but said Guobadia was against it.\nShe said she pressed him about the issue on Valentine\u2019s Day but she received a \u201clook that felt dark\u201d from Guobadia. Williams said she filed for divorce days later.\nShe filed for divorce a little over a week later.\nA source close to the situation tells Us, \u201cPorsha has moved on and wishes Simon the best.\u201d\nAs Us first reported, Guobadia was arrested on a return flight to America where he planned to attend a hearing in his divorce. He was detained at an ICE facility for months.\nAround the time of his release, the judge presiding over the divorce ruled in favor of Williams and ordered that the prenuptial agreement they signed was valid.\nGuobadia had argued Williams made misrepresentations during negotiations and he would have never agreed to it if he knew what he knows now. In court, his lawyer claimed the prenup, \u201crequires [Guobadia] to pay a substantial financial obligation to [Williams] totaling over hundreds of thousands of dollars and terms that require him to split the equity of his $7,000,000 million pre-marital home (the Marital Residence) with [Williams], and pay significant debts and expenses for the Wife\u2019s benefit.\u201d\nAs Us first reported, Guobadia told Us he has no bad feelings towards President Donald Trump despite his deportation as part of the ICE raids.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any animosity towards the situation. I don\u2019t have any problems with Donald Trump like any other CEO or chief executive, who I am. We look to hire the best people we can find. And the issues that he\u2019s dealing with are no different than any other organization,\u201d Guobadia told Us. He said he hoped to talk to Trump, 79, about immigration in the near future."

      "text": "The official cause of death for Kelly Clarkson\u2019s ex-husband, Brandon Blackstock, has been confirmed.\nSilver Bow County Coroner Dan Hollis told Us Weekly on Monday, August 11, that Blackstock\u2019s cause of death was melanoma, a form of skin cancer, and the manner of his death was natural causes. \u201cBrandon Blackstock passed away peacefully at his home in Butte, Montana on August 7th under hospice care surrounded by his family,\u201d Hollis said in a statement.\nBlackstock died on August 7 after privately battling cancer for three years. He was 48.\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years. He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family,\u201d a family rep told Us in a statement. \u201cWe thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family\u2019s privacy during this very difficult time.\u201d\nOne day earlier, Clarkson, 43, alerted fans to Blackstock\u2019s illness when she put her Las Vegas residency on pause, though she didn\u2019t reveal the nature of his condition at the time.\n\u201cUnfortunately, I need to postpone the remainder of the August Studio Session dates in Las Vegas,\u201d she announced via Instagram on August 6. \u201cWhile I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children\u2019s father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them. I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.\u201d\nClarkson and Blackstock wed in October 2013 and went on to welcome daughter River, 11, and son Remington, 9. During their marriage, Blackstock worked as the singer\u2019s manager. Clarkson ultimately filed for divorce in June 2020 after nearly seven years. The pair finalized the proceedings in March 2022 following a messy legal battle.\nPrior to his relationship with Clarkson, Blackstock was married to Melissa Ashworth from 2001 to 2012. The exes shared daughter Savannah, 23, and son Seth, 18.\nIn January 2022, Blackstock became a first-time grandfather when Savannah gave birth to her and now-husband Quentin Lee\u2019s son, Lake. Savannah announced in July that the couple are expecting their second baby.\nOutside of his marriage to Clarkson, Brandon had another Hollywood connection via his father, Narvel Blackstock, who was Clarkson\u2019s manager earlier in her career. Narvel was previously married to Reba McEntire from 1989 to 2015, during which time she was stepmom to Brandon and his two sisters, Chassidy and Shawna. Narvel and McEntire\u2019s son, Shelby, who was born in 1990, was Brandon\u2019s half-brother."

      "text": "Real Housewives of Atlanta star Porsha Williams scored a win in her divorce battle with ex Simon Guobadia after a judge ruled in her favor to enforce their prenup, Us Weekly can report.\nOn Tuesday, June 11, a hearing took place in Williams and Guobadia\u2019s bitter divorce. The exes were fighting over the enforcement of the prenup they signed before walking down the aisle.\nThe hearing had been postponed several times, partly due to Guobadia, 61, being taken into custody by ICE. As Us first reported, Guobadia was released from custody last week and deported back to Nigeria.\nWilliams, 43, filed for divorce in February 2024, following 15 months of marriage. In her petition, she asked for support and for the division of property to be determined by the prenup.\nGuobadia opposed the request to enforce the agreement. He claimed Williams made misrepresentations during the negotiations.\n\u201c[Williams] failed to disclose that she would return to her employment on The Real Housewives of Atlanta as a cast member,\u201d the docs read. \u201cInstead of disclosing this material fact, the Wife made it very clear to [Guobadia] (and the public) that she was leaving the television show and not returning. [Guobadia] relied on the representations \u2014 or misrepresentations \u2014 [Williams] made to him during their engagement, the negotiation phase, and at the time that the parties signed the Prenuptial Agreement.\u201d\nGuobadia claimed that if it were not for Williams\u2019 \u201cmisrepresentations\u201d about leaving RHOA, he would not have agreed to a prenup that, \u201crequires him to pay a substantial financial obligation to [Williams] totaling over hundreds of thousands of dollars and terms that require him to split the equity of his $7,000,000 million pre-marital home (the Marital Residence) with [Williams], and pay significant debts and expenses for the Wife\u2019s benefit.\u201d\nWilliams did not agree with Guobadia on the matter. She said that the negotiations took place over the course of months.\nAt the recent hearing, the judge sided with Williams and ordered the prenup to be enforced. Sources tell Us that Guobadia has yet to determine if he will appeal the decision.\nBefore the hearing, Williams requested permission to attend via video.\nShe told the court she was offered a job that would help her \u201coffset the numerous financial obligations that [Guobadia] has failed to maintain under the Temporary Order, as well as to offset the significant legal expenses [Williams] has already incurred in pursuing enforcement of the parties\u2019 Prenuptial Agreement and defending herself against [Guobadia] as it relates to the instant divorce action.\u201d\nHer lawyer added, \u201c[Williams] shows that her request for virtual appearance is made in good faith and reflects a balancing of her professional obligations and the serious nature of these proceedings, not a desire to delay or further complicate the instant litigation.\u201d\nGuobadia appeared at the hearing via video.\nAs Us first reported, Guobadia was deported to Nigeria last week. The businessman has been in ICE custody since February.\nGuobadia\u2019s friend and business partner, Tai Savet, told Us that he was in \u201cgood spirits\u201d after his release. Tai told Us that Guobadia hoped to have a conversation with President Donald Trump."

      "text": "Porsha Williams\u2019 estranged husband, Simon Guobadia, was released from ICE custody and deported back to his home country after spending months at a detention center, Us Weekly can exclusively report.\nGuobadia\u2019s friend and business partner, Tai Savet, tells Us that the Nigeria-born businessman was sent on a flight back home a couple of days ago.\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security website no longer lists Guobadia as being in their system. Us also obtained a selfie taken by Simon on Monday, June 9.\nSavet said Guobadia, 61, was in \u201cgood spirits\u201d after a tough experience at the detention center, which was the first time he had ever been behind bars.\nSavet added that Guobadia is not mad at President Donald Trump, and would like a sit-down with him.\nGuobadia and his team launched a new business where they will be selling shirts that will help people in ICE custody.\nBack in February, Williams\u2019 ex was taken to the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia, about two hours outside of Atlanta, as part of the government\u2019s mass deportation efforts.\nGuobadia moved to the United States in 1982 but reportedly overstayed his visa. He left the country but came back and overstayed his visa a second time, according to a local report.\nWSB-TV reported Guobadia was deported in 1992 but was granted permanent residency status the same year when he used an \u201cundisclosed identity.\u201d\nHe attempted to gain citizenship over the years but was shut down each time.\nWilliams, 43, filed for divorce from Guobadia in February 2024, following 15 months of marriage.\nThe exes went back and forth for months over Williams\u2019 request for exclusive use of their marital home.\nThe judge sided with Williams and ordered that she could live in the home until a final decision is reached in the divorce.\nThe exes are set to face off at a divorce hearing later this week, with Guobadia being allowed to appear via video due to his deportation.\nThe reality star and her ex are fighting over the prenuptial agreement they signed before they walked down the aisle on November 25, 2022.\nThe hearing has been postponed several times, partly due to Guobadia\u2019s detention.\nAfter he was taken into custody, Guobadia asked for the hearing to be postponed to allow him time to attend.\nHis lawyer argued, \u201cThe motion to enforce the Prenuptial Agreement is a substantive motion that requires findings of fact by this Court. The outcome of the motion will also have a substantial effect on how the remainder of the divorce case proceeds, as it may be dispositive of some of the issues and result in litigation on others.\u201d\nThe judge granted Guobadia\u2019s motion and rescheduled the hearing for June 11.\nThe order instructed ICE agents to transport Guobadia to the hearing if he was not released.\nFor her part, Williams filed a motion requesting permission to attend the hearing via video.\nThe RHOA star\u2019s lawyer told the court, \u201c[Williams] is a well-known reality television personality, a career in which last-minute travel and unexpected opportunities frequently arise.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201c[Williams] shows that this employment opportunity would help [Williams] offset the numerous financial obligations that [Guobadia] has failed to maintain under the Temporary Order, as well as to offset the significant legal expenses [Williams] has already incurred in pursuing enforcement of the parties\u2019 Prenuptial Agreement and defending herself against [Guobadia] as it relates to the instant divorce action.\u201d\n\u201c[Williams] shows that her request for virtual appearance is made in good faith and reflects a balancing of her professional obligations and the serious nature of these proceedings, not a desire to delay or further complicate the instant litigation,\u201d the reality star\u2019s attorney argued.\nThe judge has yet to rule."

      "text": "Porsha Williams\u2019 ex-husband Simon Guobadia revealed he is seeking a massive six-figure sum in damages from The Real Housewives of Atlanta star as part of his federal lawsuit against her, Us Weekly can exclusively report.\nAccording to court documents obtained by Us, Guobadia, 61, told the court he will be seeking $500,000 for lost business opportunities and sponsorships. In addition, he will also be seeking unspecified general damages for harm to his reputation, emotional distress and humiliation.\nGuobadia said he believes he is also entitled to punitive damages for Williams\u2019 alleged \u201cmalicious conduct.\u201d As Us previously reported, Guobadia sued Williams, 44, for defamation in November 2024 over a series of Instagram posts she made.\nGuobadia, who split from Williams in 2024, claimed their relationship became \u201ccontentious\u201d when she started \u201cmaking negative, false and misleading statements about him on social media, using her outsized platform to negatively influence public perception of him.\u201d In his suit, he said Williams made statements regarding erectile dysfunction.\n\u201cThese posts were intentionally crafted to imply that [Guobadia] suffers from this condition, casting him in a negative and humiliating light,\u201d his lawyer alleged.\nGuobadia\u2019s attorney added, \u201cThe nature, timing, and context of these posts, amidst the couple\u2019s public separation, led reasonable viewers to infer that [Williams\u2019] statements were referring to [Guobadia] \u2013 because they were.\u201d\nIn court documents, Guobadia argued that Williams\u2019 posts were \u201cpresented in a factual manner\u201d that implied he had ED and were \u201cclearly intended to cast\u201d him in a \u201cnegative and humiliating light.\u201d\n\u201c[Williams\u2019] statements were false; [Guobadia] does not have ED and has never suffered from or been diagnosed with this condition,\u201d his lawyer wrote.\nThe businessman, who was recently deported, claimed he had suffered emotional distress and personal anguish due to the Instagram posts made by his ex-wife.\nHis suit added, \u201cBy making these claims in a public forum, [Williams] ensured their immediate and widespread dissemination, amplifying the harm to [Guobadia\u2019s] credibility and social esteem.\u201d\nIn response, Williams demanded the suit be thrown out of court. Her lawyer wrote, \u201cNone of [Williams\u2019] posts refer to any particular individual, let alone [Guobadia] specifically. [Williams] cannot and should not be held liable for sharing information regarding a common condition that likely plagues many of [Williams\u2019] social media followers. For this reason, and the reasons detailed herein, this Court should dismiss [Guobadia\u2019s] Complaint in its entirety.\u201d\nHer lawyer argued, \u201cThese posts simply provide information regarding a common condition, and Defendant even uses the hashtag \u2018Mens Health Awareness\u2019 to draw awareness to the information that may help some of Defendant\u2019s social media followers.\u201d\nIn his new filing, Guobadia claimed he would submit his medical records to rebut \u201cimplications\u201d made by Williams. The case is ongoing.\nAs Us first reported, last month, Williams\u2019 divorce was finalized. The judge ruled in the RHOA star\u2019s favor and said the prenuptial agreement would be enforced, which Guobadia had opposed. He vowed to appeal the decision."

      "text": "Real Housewives of Atlanta star Porsha Williams\u2019 ex Simon Guobadia broke his silence exclusively to Us Weekly days after being released from ICE custody \u2014 and detailed the \u201cnightmare\u201d four months he spent in detainment as well as his plans for the future.\nGuobadia, who was deported to Nigeria over the weekend, explained he was spending time overseas amid his divorce. He took a flight back home to America to attend a hearing in the case.\nHe said he was \u201cmet at the entrance\u201d of the gate, and \u201cabout seven agents with ICE\u201d came on board the plane to escort him off.\nGuobadia, 61, said he was asked \u201ca bunch of questions about my business and where I was traveling from, and then they asked me to turn over my devices.\u201d\nHe said they took his laptop and two phones, one of which was dedicated to business in Dubai and the other for work in the United States.\n\u201cSo I had everything on me, literally a mobile office. [They] took those from me and [I] gave them passcodes so they could do their forensic investigation, [if] you will. After that, they basically came and told me that I was being detained and that they would be taking me in, and I\u2019ll be seeing a judge at some point. So they slapped the cuffs on and I was taken away,\u201d he told Us.\nGuobadia said he had no idea he was going to be taken into custody that day. He noted it all happened \u201ca day or two before the premiere of season 16\u201d of The Real Housewives of Atlanta.\nHe found the whole thing odd since his immigration issues were well-known. Guobadia said he had never had any issues traveling.\nWhen asked if it felt like he was targeted, Guobadia told Us, \u201cYes, it felt like a target. It felt like a target because they had no reason [and] it felt like a target on a number of fronts. One, for sure, is the new administration and new administration policies, they\u2019ve heightened their targets apparently as agents are waiting, looking through flight [logs] for names that may have popped up on their radar and take them into custody.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cAnd the second one was that I expected that I\u2019m in a contentious divorce, and it\u2019s not just one individual I\u2019m dealing with. I am dealing with those behind her, the powers behind her that, obviously, would like to see her succeed and ensure that the investment in this person will come to fruition. So I was not totally oblivious to the possibilities of \u2026 some interference.\u201d\nGuobadia said he did not know but felt it was possible Williams, 43, or someone connected to her may have called ICE. \u201cIt\u2019s possible. I just don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have all the facts,\u201d he said. (A source with knowledge of the situation tells Us, \u201cThere\u2019s zero truth to this theory that there\u2019s a connection between Porsha and Simon\u2019s arrest. It was an internet meme.\u201d)\nAfter being questioned at the airport, Guobadia said he was transported to a facility. He was told he would see a judge eventually but could not get bond.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when my shock realization kicked in that, \u2018Oh my God, what\u2019s about to happen?\u2019I was transported to a detention center that I don\u2019t recall the name right now, to be housed overnight and went through that experience [of] taking my regular street clothes off and having to put on inmate clothes,\u201d he told Us.\nGuobadia choked up at one point, telling Us, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. There are a lot of things that I kind of bottled up for a while. So this interview is the first time I\u2019m truly speaking out about the experience.\u201d\nEventually, he was transported \u2013 with his hands and feet in cuffs \u2013 to the Stewart Detention Center, where he stayed until his recent release.\nGuobadia said he slept for two days upon his arrival. He said his friends and family were able to come visit him shortly after. He was able to spend one hour with them.\n\u201cThat was the first time [they visited me]. It was very emotional for me because prior to that, I didn\u2019t have a phone call. I didn\u2019t have a chance to phone them. I didn\u2019t have my phone book. I guess the kindness, or I don\u2019t know what it was, but the officer let me use this phone and I was able to get through to my house manager and she in turn got in touch with [my close friend].\u201d\nHe added, \u201cBut the way this thing is designed is not like you\u2019re arrested and you\u2019re immediately given time to call. It could take a while, and sometimes it could take days before you\u2019re able to reach your family.\u201d\nA couple of days after his arrival. Guobadia said he was pulled aside and told he was being put into protective custody due to his being a celebrity.\n\u201cThey said, \u2018Well, there are people who recognize that you\u2019re a celebrity,\u2019 and they want to take precautions. And so they took me into protective custody. I was taken to an area that is called segregation,\u201d Guobadia told Us.\nGuobadia said he was placed in an area with dangerous people but given his own cell. He said he was given the choice to be with the general population, but decided to go to assess the situation. In segregation, Guobadia said he was locked in a cell for 23 hours of the day. He would be allowed one hour outside. If the weather was bad, he said he spent the whole day inside the cell.\n\u201cI understood why people would kill themselves, but I\u2019m too strong to do that. But I understand why people, when you [are] put in a certain mental headspace, you start to understand why people do what they do,\u201d he told Us.\nEventually, Guobadia said he convinced a guard to let him back into the general population. Guobadia told Us that the population was mostly Hispanic men \u201cwho looked like they were picked up from work sites or their jobs.\u201d\nHe said the facility was mostly \u201cclean.\u201d\nHowever, he noted, \u201csome of the glaring things I saw were \u2026 the staff was poorly trained, they didn\u2019t have a whole lot of staffing. There was overcrowding, there were people detained, individuals who were sleeping in makeshift beds.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cThose facilities were built to house \u2026 about 200 people [per unit], and each cell would house two people, a top and a bottom bunk.\u201d He said the facility had many more people than it was built to hold.\nGuobadia also described the \u201cterrible\u201d food at the facility.\n\u201cBreakfast is typical cereal and milk. I never got coffee. I never got tea. There was no purified water, no bottled water \u2026 none of that,\u201d he explained.\nWhen he was in segregation, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s a panel [in my door] to open and serve the food, and sometimes they come back and take the [empty trays]. Sometimes they wait till the end of the day while I pile three meals in a day with empty trays and then get it back to them.\u201d\nThe lunch consisted of a \u201cmake-believe burger\u201d that was not real meat and \u201clot of beans.\u201d\nHe said, \u201cEvery meal came with beans.\u201d Guobadia said they had tacos and rice, and Spaghetti for dinner, but not much variation.\n\u201cThe food was bad,\u201d he added. \u201cThere was nothing; it had no nutritional value.\u201d\nIn the general population, Guobadia said he made a few friends. He would often watch the news on a TV in the main waiting room.\nHe said the other detainees played basketball, volleyball, and soccer when allowed outside. He said the cell doors were open for people to roam around during the day but there were guards around and rules to follow.\nGuobadia said the entire experience was a \u201cnightmare,\u201d but it also \u201cmade me realize that I\u2019m a pretty tough cookie.\u201d\nWhile in custody, he ended up with the flu and had to be housed at a clinic for days.\nGuobadia said he received no updates on his case while inside. He said the running joke inside was that ICE agents were \u201cnever truthful\u201d when asked by detainees when they were leaving.\nHe said he was only told he was leaving two weeks before being deported. When it was time for him to leave, he was put into a holding cell with others and not given food for 18 hours.\nLooking forward, Guobadia has plans to head to Dubai, where he has previously lived, and is in the process of reuniting with his children."

      "text": "Porsha Williams has demanded an emergency hearing after allegedly being locked out of her home by her estranged husband, Simon Guobadia.\nWilliams, 42, claimed Guobadia, 59, changed the locks on their Atlanta residence to prevent her attempts \u201cto access her home, seemingly to be vindictive and retaliatory for wanting to divorce him,\u201d according to court documents obtained by Radar Online.\nThe reality star further claimed that, in the event of a divorce, the couple\u2019s prenup stipulates that Guobadia would vacate the home within 30 days of filing. Williams filed for divorce from Guobadia on February 22 after 15 months of marriage. Guobadia allegedly requested an extension that would have allowed him to stay in the house until March 31, but Williams denied it.\nOnce the proposal was shot down, the legal documents claim Guobadia \u201cdisabled her access to the gate of the Marital Residence, effectively blocking her ability to access her own residence.\u201d\nWilliams was eventually able to access the gate, but then Guobadia allegedly \u201cdisabled Wife\u2019s access to the residence, changed the locks, and changed the garage code almost immediately after Wife left the residence.\u201d\nFurther, Williams\u2019 attorney was told Guobadia had obtained a new lawyer who indicated Guobadia had no intention of leaving the home. Calling Guobadia\u2019s behavior \u201cerratic,\u201d Williams said her daughter Pilar, 5, had also been \u201cdisplaced from the residence.\u201d\nDespite his insistence to stand his ground, the legal filing indicated Guobadia is not even in the country at the moment, rather currently spending time in Dubai.\nIn separate legal documents obtained by Page Six on Monday, March 25, Guobadia claimed Williams had brought \u201can armed gunman\u201d to their home. The documents allege Williams left their home and returned with \u201ca man visibly bearing a gun for reasons unknown.\u201d\nOn Thursday, March 21, Guobadia called the police to \u201cmaintain the peace.\u201d Three days later on Sunday, March 24, Williams allegedly forced her way into their home with her mother and her mother\u2019s boyfriend, where Guobadia claimed they disengaged security cameras and \u201ctampered with items and evidence.\u201d\nAfter the couple\u2019s split was announced, Williams broke her silence via Instagram on February, 25, thanking fans for their \u201cprayers & support.\u201d\nWilliams\u2019 divorce filing came just over a week after she announced her return to The Real Housewives of Atlanta, which she left after season 13 in 2021."

Porsha added a broken heart and prayer hands emoji to her social media message.\nWilliams\u2019 Instagram post came days after news broke on Friday, February 23, that she had filed for divorce from Guobadia. (Williams still has her married name on her Instagram profile as of Monday, February 26.)\nGuobadia, 59, addressed the split in a since-deleted Instagram Story post.\n\u201cWill Stop Loving My Wife When Divorce is Final,\u201d he wrote, according to a Bravo fan account who shared the post on Sunday.\nPeople was first to report the news of Williams\u2019 divorce filing on Friday, with a source telling the publication that the split had nothing to do with reports regarding Guobadia\u2019s citizenship status. (Guobadia was born in Nigeria.)\nDays before filing for divorce, Williams referred to Guobadia as her \u201cride or die\u201d in an Instagram post. The video, posted on February 17, showed the estranged couple riding on a boat that appeared to be modeled after a yellow sports car.\nWilliams took her relationship with Guobadia public with her engagement in May 2021, revealing that they had only been together for one month. (Guobadia and ex-wife Falynn Guobadia announced their divorce had been finalized one month prior.)\n\u201cI know it\u2019s fast but we are living life each day to its fullest. I choose happiness every morning and every night. Tuning out all negative energy and only focused on positive wishes. He makes me so happy and to me, that is what matters most,\u201d Williams wrote on Instagram when sharing the engagement news. \u201cFor all of you that need facts, I get the optics but Simon filed for divorce from a previous marriage in January.

That\u2019s between the two of them.\u201d\nFalynn appeared on RHOA in a \u201cfriend of\u201d role during season 13, which forced Williams to explain her connection to the fellow Bravo star.\n\u201cFalynn and I are not friends, and Simon\u2019s divorce has been settled,\u201d she concluded. \u201cOur relationship is a positive, loving step forward in everybody\u2019s lives.\u201d\nWilliams and Guobadia ultimately tied the knot in November 2022.\nWeeks before her divorce news, Williams announced her plans to return to RHOA for the upcoming 16th season. She also signed an overall scripted deal with NBCUniversal.\n\u201cI\u2019m incredibly thankful for the vision and faith NBCUniversal has put in me to be a larger part of their family,\u201d Williams shared in a statement on February 13. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to being back on \u2018The Real Housewives of Atlanta,\u2019 and showing the world my new world!\u201d"
