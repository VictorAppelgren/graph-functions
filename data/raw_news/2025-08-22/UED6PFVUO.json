  "description": "The Estate Whiskey Alliance was founded in September 2024 with seven members.",
  "content": "The Estate Whiskey Alliance was founded on August 22, 2024 with seven members. The Alliance membership is composed of whiskey producers, farmers, suppliers, academic institutions and related entities to promote estate whiskey. To be considered estate whiskey, at least two-thirds of the grains used in making the whiskey must be grown on land owned or controlled by the distillery, and all production\u2014milling, cooking, fermenting, distilling, barreling, aging and bottling\u2014must occur on land owned or controlled by the distillery.\n\nSince its formation one year ago, membership in the Alliance has nearly tripled. \u201cWe are now at 16 members,\u201d said Landon Borders, director of the Alliance and senior executive director of the UK Innovate at the University of Kentucky, in a telephone interview. \u201cWe are pleased as punch with that.\u201d\n\nAs part of its efforts to promote estate whiskey, the Alliance has created a seal that can be found on certified products. Fourteen products from four distilleries now bear the Estate Whiskey Certified logo, indicating that the whiskey meets the Alliance\u2019s definition of estate whiskey. The logo also indicates the percentage of grains\u2014a minimum of two-thirds\u2014in the whiskey coming from the estate.\n\nIn order to be allowed the carry the Estate Whiskey Certified logo, estate distilleries must apply to the Alliance. \u201cThe product must be made by an Estate Whiskey Alliance member,\u201d explained Borders. \u201cThere is a lot of required disclosure around the origins of the grain, maps of the estate down to the location of the mill. It is arduous.\u201d Once the disclosure has been reviewed, a site visit by Alliance representatives is required, to ensure compliance and quality control. For distilleries making both estate and non-estate whiskey, proper segregation of grains and distillate need to be assured.\n\nBorders notes that in the wine industry, estate wine commands a premium of about 30% over other wines. The potential for a similar premium for estate whiskey is what is driving interest in the Alliance and its certification.\n\nBut it\u2019s more than just money.\n\nMaker\u2019s Mark Distillery achieved the very first Estate Whiskey Certified product, their Star Hill Farm Wheat Whisky (Maker\u2019s Mark prefers to spell \u201cwhisky\u201d without the \u201ce\u201d) was granted Certification Number 2025-0001. The whiskey is a blend of seven- and eight-year-old whiskey, so it was a product in the making years before the Estate Whiskey Alliance was created. But its production was intended to showcase exactly what the Alliance is all about, so it made sense for Maker\u2019s Mark to seek certification.\n\n\u201cFor us, when we look back to our founding family\u2014the Samuels family who founded Maker\u2019s Mark in 1953\u2014they recognized nature\u2019s role in making fine whiskey,\u201d said Blake Layfield, master distiller and head of innovation and blending. \u201cThis certification makes it a global standard for working with grains that showcase place.\u201d\n\nLayfield notes that since the founding of Maker\u2019s Mark, the Starr Hill Farm Wheat Whisky is their first release with a grain bill different from original Maker\u2019s Mark. Rather than creating a new expression with cask finishing or extraneous flavorings, the distillery sought to make a whiskey that celebrates their land. \u201cFor us, innovation comes from nature and innovation comes from place,\u201d he said.\n\nBatches of whiskey require individual certification so it is the intent of Maker\u2019s Mark to release new batches of Starr Hill Farms Wheat Whisky annually, each earning certification. Other certified products will also need to certify new releases and with the program only being one year old, it is anticipated that the number of certified products will continue to grow.\n\nOn August 18, 2025, the Estate Whiskey Alliance announced awarding the first grants under its research grant program. The program is intended to fund research that focuses on agriculture, manufacturing and terroir that will influence the future of estate whiskey production.\n\nThe two projects receiving grants are led by researchers at the UK Martin-Gatton College of Agriculture, Food and Environment and are titled \u201cExploring Regional Terroir in Kentucky-Grown Barley for Single Malt Whiskey Production\u201d and \u201cConsumer Perceptions of Certified Estate Whiskeys: Marketing Insights for Sustainable Branding.\u201d\n\nIn just one year, the growth of the Estate Whiskey Alliance and the launching of two major programs\u2014the Estate Whiskey Certified Products and the grant program\u2014proves the desire for whiskey produces to have ways to distinguish their products. \u201cIt is another way to be as transparent as possible with consumers,\u201d said Borders.",

      "text": "When Maker\u2019s Mark debuted in the 1950s, the bourbon became known for a few things: Its distinctive square shaped bottle with a red wax seal on the neck, spelling whiskey without the \u201ce\u201d as a nod to the brand\u2019s Scottish heritage, and for being a \u201cwheated bourbon\u201d \u2014 using red winter wheat as a flavoring grain rather than just rye.\nIts newest product, which debuts Tuesday, is a wheat whisky, so it doesn\u2019t have any corn \u2014 a key ingredient in bourbon. It is named after Star Hill Farm, the 1,100-acre farm that is home to the Maker\u2019s Mark Distillery. The plot was chosen by Maker\u2019s Mark founders, Margie and Bill Samuels Sr., in 1953 for its water source and proximity to grain farmers. The bottle proclaims it is \u201clocally grown whisky, farmed to showcase the influence of our land. Nature as maker.\u201d\nThinking about terroir is common in wine making and beginning to gain traction in whiskey production. Bruichladdich in Scotland began distilling whisky in the 2010s using only barley from Islay. Last year, the University of Kentucky established the Estate Whiskey Alliance with seven founding members. Star Hill Farm Whisky will be the first to carry an Estate Whiskey certification which means that it was produced entirely on the distillery estate, using grains sourced from estate owned or controlled land.\nIf you\u2019re going to tout the farm and quality of grain your whisky is coming from, then it is also key to care about the soil. Maker\u2019s Mark is also the first distillery to received certification from Regenified, a regenerative agriculture certification company.\nTo get the certification, farms must not only currently meet certain standards of regenerative agriculture, such as reducing the amount of soil disturbances like tillage and using cover crops to benefit the soil, but also show they are making improvements in their practices, said Salar Shemirani, the CEO at Regnefied. Maker\u2019s Mark has committed to transitioning a million acres of conventional farmland to regenerative over the next three years.\nCompanies have different motivations for transitioning to regenerative agriculture, Shemirani said in an interview.\n\u201cThe way we are producing food in our agricultural system is simply not sustainable. And not just from an environmental perspective, but from a land capacity and production and availability perspective,\u201d Shemirani said. \u201cThe other one that is critical to the whole system is quality, and we are noticing that that quality of our crops is really diminishing. The carrots my mom would eat 20 or 30 years ago have 30% less nutritional availability now\u2026 Makers Mark really started in pursuit of flavor, and where flavor comes from.\u201d\nMaker\u2019s Mark will have an impact on farmers around them in their supply chain, but also on other distilleries, Shemirani said. Regenified is currently working with two other distilleries working on getting their certification.\n\u201cI do believe that something extraordinary is happening,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re as good and nimble and ambitious as Maker\u2019s Mark to know where your grains come from, you want to support your farmers going down this path.\u201d\nControlling the agricultural product that goes into making the liquid has an impact on taste, said Rob Samuels, an eighth-generation whisky maker and managing director of Maker\u2019s Mark who called the process a \u201c10-year journey to unlock nature\u2019s depth of flavor,\u201d in a press release. resulting in something new from the Maker\u2019s Mark Distillery,\" Samuels said in a press release. \u201c\nThe traditional mashbill for Maker\u2019s Mark bourbon, is 70 percent corn, 16 percent red winter wheat and 14 percent malted barley. Star Hill Farm Whisky will change each year. The 2025 release is a blend of two seven and eight year old whiskies with two mashbills, one with 70% soft red winter wheat and 30% malted barley, and the other with 100% malted soft red winter wheat. Blended together, that ends up being 51% soft red winter wheat, 27% malted soft red winter wheat and 22% malted barley. It\u2019s bottled at cask strength at 114.7 proof.\nThe result is a very different whisky than Maker\u2019s Mark bourbon. It doesn\u2019t have the corn sweetness, but does pack a more nuanced, spiced punch at the higher proof. Dr. Blake Layfield, the master distiller of Maker\u2019s Mark, described the nose as having notes of buttery caramel, golden raisins and gingerbread, with honeyed toffee, chocolate-covered cherries, and a hint of apple pie spice on the palate. The finish is \u201csmooth and inviting, with toasted pecans and soft cinnamon bringing it all together.\u201d\nThe limited-time release will be available for $100."

      "text": "The University of Kentucky, which often partners with industry to promote whiskey, which has significant economic impact in the State of Kentucky, has established the Estate Whiskey Alliance, with seven founding members.\nThe Estate Whiskey Alliance will open its membership to whiskey producers, farmers, suppliers, academic institutions and related institutions\u2014not just estate whiskey distilleries. Next year, the Alliance plans to release an Estate Whiskey Certified logo that can be used only on whiskey meeting the Alliance\u2019s requirements. Those requirements are that all production\u2014milling, cooking, fermenting, distilling\u2014occurs on land owned by the distillery, from grains at least two-thirds of which are grown on land owned or controlled by the distillery.\nThe seven founding members are Black Fox Farm and Distillery of Saskatchewan, Canada, while the other six founding members are American: Heaven Hill Distillery (Bardstown, Kentucky), Hillrock Estate Distillery (Ancram, New York), Maker\u2019s Mark (Loretto, Kentucky), Peterson Farms (Loretto, Kentucky), Thousand Acres Distilling Company (under construction in Bardstown, Kentucky), and Western Kentucky Distilling Company (Beaver Dam, Kentucky).\n\u201cThere is a lot of interest from whiskey producers in estate whiskey as a differentiator in products or businesses,\u201d said Landon Borders, director of the Estate Whiskey Alliance and executive director of Innovation Connect at the University of Kentucky in a telephone interview.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nAlthough the Alliance was founded with seven members, Borders says he has been speaking with distilleries from around the world and expects membership to triple within a year. \u201cWe know there is a lot of interest,\u201d said Borders.\nThe interest of producers in having an official designation for estate-made whiskey is in response to consumer demand. \u201cI am a whiskey connoisseur myself,\u201d said Borders. \u201cWhat has fascinated me is that this adds a lot of dimensions to the consumer experience.\u201d\nEstate whiskey promises to tantalize consumers with heirloom or innovative grains\u2014Black Fox Farm and Distillery makes whiskey from triticale grown on their farm, for example\u2014and a chance to experience terroir. Borders notes that estate whiskey producers not only create different flavors influenced by soil and weather unique to their farm, but that they can actually taste differences from grains grown on different locations on the same farm. And with weather creating more variability, estate whiskey could offer vintage dating that signifies actual sensory differences beyond age.\nAs the Estate Whiskey Alliance grows its membership geographically, Estate Whiskey Certified spirit may also allow spirits consumers to discover new or to rediscover heritage grain varieties. With large production whiskey, the distillers demand uniform ingredients to create a consistent product. That restricts the varieties of corn, barley, wheat, oats and rye they will work with, which varieties have geographic areas in which they thrive.\nEstate Whiskey Certified producers have the ability to distill spirit in much smaller quantities, allowing them to work with grains that thrive on the land and in the weather of their estate, wherever that may be, and whatever grain that produces. This may mean the rediscovery of heritage corn varieties, in the case of bourbon, or new hybrid rye varieties in the case of rye.\nEven larger whiskey producers will be able to make unique estate lines to compliment their core range, offering a subsection of their fanbase with an elevated experience.\nPart of the appeal of Estate Whiskey Certified will also be the visitor experience. With distilleries located on farms, estate-based whiskey distilleries will be able to provide an interesting and education experience that promises to reconnect whiskey drinkers to agriculture."

      "text": "UK\u2019s Estate Whiskey Alliance\u00ae announces 1st awardees in research grant program\nLEXINGTON, Ky. (Aug. 18, 2025) \u2014 The University of Kentucky\u2019s Estate Whiskey Alliance\u00ae (EWA) has announced the first awardees of its research grant program.\nResearch projects focus on agriculture, manufacturing and terroir (the interplay of environment, farming practices and raw material characteristics) to shape the future of estate whiskey production.\nEstate whiskey is produced entirely on the distillery estate using grains sourced from the estate or local to that site.\nTwo projects led by researchers in the UK Martin-Gatton College of Agriculture, Food and Environment were selected:\n- Harmonie Bettenhausen, Ph.D., \u201cExploring Regional Terroir in Kentucky-Grown Barley for Single Malt Whiskey Production\u201d\n- Tracy Lu, Ph.D., and Min-Young Lee, Ph.D., \u201cConsumer Perceptions of Certified Estate Whiskeys: Marketing Insights for Sustainable Branding\u201d\n\u201cSelecting these first two research projects reflects our commitment to advancing estate whiskey by uniting innovation with tradition,\u201d said Landon Borders, EWA director. \u201cFrom studying how land, grain and climate shape a whiskey\u2019s character to understanding how certification builds consumer trust, we\u2019re helping ensure the legacy of estate whiskey thrives worldwide for generations to come.\u201d\nThe alliance brings whiskey producers, farmers, suppliers, academic institutions and other related organizations together as members. The EWA Research and Education Committee set the priorities for this research program.\nThe selected projects focus on opposite ends of the estate whiskey production cycle, from the grains to the consumer.\nThe science behind estate whiskey\nBettenhausen, faculty lecturer at the James B. Beam Institute for Kentucky Spirits, is leading a project on terroir in winter barley used for single malt whiskey production.\nThis research team includes researchers from the Department of Plant and Soil Sciences and the Department of Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering. The team will also work with Walnut Grove Farms, Maker\u2019s Mark\u2019s Star Hill Farm and Riverbend Malthouse.\nResearchers will analyze two barley varieties grown at three distinct Kentucky locations, then process them through malting, distillation and conduct sensory and metabolomics analysis to link environmental factors to whiskey flavor.\n\u201cThis project directly supports EWA\u2019s mission by connecting Kentucky-grown grain to distinctive estate whiskey character, offering clear value to growers, distillers and consumers,\u201d said Bettenhausen. \u201cThis work will also address a knowledge gap on barley and advance the science behind estate whiskey.\u201d\nInvestigating consumer perceptions\nThe other selected project will focus on what happens once Estate Whiskey Certified\u2122 products are on the shelves.\nLu, an associate professor in the Department of Retailing and Tourism Management, and Lee, department chair, will investigate consumer perceptions to understand how certification labels impact consumer trust, purchasing behavior and marketing effectiveness.\nThe team will conduct focus groups and surveys and use eye-tracking technology to develop actionable marketing recommendations and educational tools for the estate whiskey sector.\n\u201cCertification and transparency are growing priorities for consumers, yet little is known about how these labels affect consumer decision-making in the estate whiskey sector,\u201d Lu said. \u201cThis study will be the first to link consumer perceptions to marketing outcomes for this product.\u201d\nLu and Lee are collaborating with Old 55 Distillery in Newtown, Indiana, and Whiskey Acres Distilling Co. in DeKalb, Illinois, on this project. The distilleries will help recruit participants and will pilot the resources created from this study to help further shape them for other EWA members.\n\u201cOur long-term goal with this study is to support the relationship between consumer and estate whiskey producer,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWe are fostering collaboration between researchers, producers and consumers. Such collaboration will provide valuable insights that can shape both product strategy and industry education for years to come.\u201d\nVisit estatewhiskey.org to learn how to become an EWA member, get products Estate Whiskey Certified and find a list of current certified products.\nAs the state\u2019s flagship, land-grant institution, the University of Kentucky exists to advance the Commonwealth. We do that by preparing the next generation of leaders \u2014 placing students at the heart of everything we do \u2014 and transforming the lives of Kentuckians through education, research and creative work, service and health care. We pride ourselves on being a catalyst for breakthroughs and a force for healing, a place where ingenuity unfolds. It's all made possible by our people \u2014 visionaries, disruptors and pioneers \u2014 who make up 200 academic programs, a $476.5 million research and development enterprise and a world-class medical center, all on one campus."

      "text": "The University of Kentucky announced on Thursday that it had received the largest gift in its nearly 160-year history - $100 million bestowed by the late Carol Martin \u201cBill\u201d Gatton to the UK College of Agriculture, Food and Environment (CAFE) through The Bill Gatton Foundation.\nAccording to the university\u2019s announcement, the gift is also believed to be the largest ever to a college of agriculture in the United States. It became UK\u2019s largest donation just weeks after the university had announced its previous largest gift - a $34.5 million commitment from alumnus Stanley Pigman and his wife Karen for UK\u2019s College of Engineering\nIn recognition of the gift, UK, plans to rename CAFE the Martin-Gatton College of Agriculture, Food and Environment.in honor of Gatton\u2019s parents, Edith Martin and Harry W. Gatton Sr. (In full disclosure, I served as UK\u2019s provost from 2001-2005 and knew Mr. Gatton.)\nAccording to Nancy Cox, UK vice president for land-grant engagement and the dean of the College of Agriculture, Food and Environment, the college will form a task force of faculty and staff members to consider how the gift will be used to support its scholarships, academic programming, infrastructure and research.\n\u201cThis is a transformational gift that will have a profound impact on CAFE and the University of Kentucky,\u201d said UK President Eli Capilouto. \u201cIt will be a cornerstone in our efforts \u2014 and our singular mission \u2014 to advance Kentucky in everything that we do. Like Mr. Gatton did, we dream of a Kentucky tomorrow that is healthier, wealthier and wiser than it is today. This gift reflects his profound belief in this institution to be a partner for progress in our capacity and commitment to advance Kentucky.\u201d\nGatton, who passed away in April 2022, was a lifelong philanthropist and was the largest individual donor to UK, with gift totaling more than $180 million. The university\u2019s Gatton College of Business and Economics and the Gatton Student Center are both named after him. He served on UK\u2019s Board of Trustees.\nBill Gatton Foundation Trustee Danny Dunn, said the gift was an indication of how much Gatton believed in the transformative power of higher education.\n\"Mr. Gatton believed that investing in the University of Kentucky was investing in Kentucky's future,\" Dunn said, in the university\u2019s announcement. \u201cThis gift marks a significant milestone for the foundation, representing its first major donation since his passing. This gift symbolizes the foundation\u2019s commitment to honoring Mr. Gatton's passion for Kentucky and his desire to support its agricultural community as an essential way to advance this state.\u201d\nBill Gatton was born and raised on a farm near Bremen, Kentucky, in Muhlenberg County. He earned his BS in 1954 from the University of Kentucky and later received an MBA in finance and banking from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.\nAs a student at UK, Gatton began selling cars at a local dealership, an activity that was a start of his successful career of entrepreneurship. He later opened his own car dealership - Bill Gatton Motors in Owensboro, Kentucky, in 1959 - before expanding the Bill Gatton Automotive Group with dealerships in Tennessee, Alabama, and Texas.\nIn addition he was engaged in various real estate projects in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Texas. Gatton was also the former Chairman of the Board of Directors of Area Bancshares., which during his tenure, was the largest bank holding company headquartered in Kentucky. He served as the director of the boards of all seventeen subsidiary banks located throughout Kentucky.\nFormer UK Vice President for Philanthropy and Alumni Engagement Mike Richey, a long-time friend and confidant of Mr. Gatton\u2019s, said this gift from the foundation would have been very important to Gatton.\n\u201cFor the last few years of his life, Mr. Gatton never wavered in his interest and desire to do something philanthropic for agriculture in Kentucky through the College of Agriculture, Food and Environment,\u201d Richey said. \u201cThis wonderful gift shows he has done that very thing.\""
