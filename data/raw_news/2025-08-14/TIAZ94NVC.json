  "title": "8 ways ChatGPT beats Google Search",
  "description": "Still using Google Search to learn new things and find information online? ChatGPT approaches discovery in a completely different way, and will likely give you a better experience.",
  "content": "When you want to find information online, where do you go? For a long time, Google was the answer. The search giant has become so embedded in modern culture that we use \u201cto Google\u201d as a verb. But there\u2019s a new player on the block\u2014one that has upended everything.\n\nMore and more people are flocking to ChatGPT as their primary mode of query fulfillment, and why not? ChatGPT isn\u2019t merely an answer engine. It offers a much more interactive experience than traditional search. Google helps you find links, while ChatGPT does more.\n\nHere are all the ways ChatGPT beats Google Search and why people are choosing ChatGPT over Google for their queries.\n\nNote: We\u2019re only comparing to Google Search here. Google technically has AI Overviews as well as AI Mode now, which are attempts to replicate the magic of ChatGPT\u2014and while even those still fall seriously short of what ChatGPT is capable of, they\u2019re beyond this article\u2019s scope.\n\nWith Google, you know how it goes: you type in your keywords, then click on a bunch of semi-relevant links hoping that one of them has the information or guidance you need. Google merely directs you to web pages that match your query. ChatGPT, on the other hand, digests all the information on the web and answers you directly. This fits much better with how humans have shared information for millennia, passing knowledge on from one generation to the next. It also cuts out the middleman, with you being shown and told what you need to know without having to bounce around the web via clicks. Personally, I much prefer having a conversation with a chatbot than being shepherded around the web to half-answers\u2014especially if, at the end of said conversation, I can walk away with what I was looking for when I went online in the first place. And if you don\u2019t like being spoon-fed answers? ChatGPT has a new mode that you\u2019ll love! When you search on Google, you get a list of web pages\u2014and those web pages are ranked and sorted according to how relevant they are to your query. This is how Google organizes what it knows and how it presents all of that to you. Google has to work this way, otherwise you\u2019d have to sort through millions of web results yourself. But the problem with Google is that its algorithms are far from perfect. Some websites are unduly weighted more heavily than others, smaller publishers get pushed down the rankings because they don\u2019t have enough \u201cauthority\u201d or \u201cbacklinks,\u201d and lesser-known \u201chidden gems\u201d are rarely surfaced. And more recently, Google is getting outplayed by AI-generated websites that offer little to no value. In short, you\u2019ve probably noticed that Google\u2019s search results have been getting worse. To be fair, ChatGPT employs numerous algorithms of its own\u2014but it synthesizes everything into a single answer for you. Unlike Google, ChatGPT isn\u2019t weighting individual web pages; rather, it\u2019s digesting web information to build language models. It\u2019s a different approach that produces (arguably) better results that are more fair, more timely, and more personalized to you as the query-giver. ChatGPT can be fine-tuned to your needs When you Google something, you\u2019re limited to typing in keywords and exploring the links that are spit out. If you don\u2019t get the response you want, your only real option is to try again with tweaked keywords\u2014which may or may not take you closer to what you need. With ChatGPT, you can tweak the responses in various ways. Don\u2019t like ChatGPT\u2019s tone? Ask it to be more polite, or cut the sycophantic flattery, or simplify things in a way that even a child would get it. Not satisfied by generic advice? Provide as much extra context as you can muster so ChatGPT gives you specific, highly targeted replies. Hate walls of text? Tell ChatGPT to use bullet points, tables, or whatever else. Google Search simply can\u2019t compete with ChatGPT\u2019s versatility and ability to deliver exactly what you want and how you want it. It also opens the way to use ChatGPT in surprisingly creative and clever ways. Have you ever searched for something specific on Google, only for Google to ignore or misinterpret your query? Pretty sure we\u2019ve all been there. And sure, ChatGPT also fails sometimes, but on the whole it\u2019s way better at understanding context than Google. Here\u2019s an example: You\u2019re looking for some feel-good movies to watch with your family, but some of your family doesn\u2019t speak English, plus you want to keep the runtime to around 90 minutes max. You also want to limit the results to movies on Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+ because those are the only streaming services you have. If you try to search for that on Google, you\u2019ll end up spending hours scouring through generic lists of \u201cfeel-good movies\u201d and filtering for the ones that match your criteria. But if you ask ChatGPT for feel-good movies with all that extra context, you\u2019ll get a much tighter list. Once Google sends you its list of links for your query, its usefulness has essentially come to an end. It\u2019s hard to follow up, drill down, and filter the results more towards what you originally intended. With Google, you can run a repeat search with tighter keywords, but that\u2019s about it. Context doesn\u2019t carry over from search to search. Compare that to ChatGPT, which operates more like a conversation with back and forth messages, allowing you to ask further questions or tweak its responses without losing any context along the way. Even if you start with a dead-simple one-line ChatGPT prompt, you can always keep the conversation going\u2014either with your own follow-ups or using one of ChatGPT\u2019s own suggestions. Then, later on, you can reference something from earlier in the conversation and ChatGPT will get it. ChatGPT cuts through the worst of the web I\u2019m old enough to remember the earliest days of the web, so I often lament the current state of things: clickbait, intrusive ads, paywalls, autoplaying videos, and more. All of it has made navigating the web more of a chore than the pleasure it used to be. As of this writing, ChatGPT doesn\u2019t suffer from any of that. You don\u2019t have to sift through clickbait, block ads, close videos\u2014and that\u2019s why ChatGPT\u2019s user base continues to grow and grow. ChatGPT compiles everything and presents it to you in whatever format you want, making the experience far more pleasant. You might run into chat limits and upgrade nags with the free version, but that\u2019s about it. Google Search merely points you to pre-made web pages that are written in one specific way. A listicle of movies might be helpful, but it\u2019s static\u2014you can\u2019t rearrange that article according to different criteria. It\u2019s presented one way and you have to take it or leave it. On the other hand, ChatGPT doesn\u2019t just point you to links. It absorbs all the information it comes across and waits for you to ask what you want to know in the format you desire. Whereas Google Search is a repository of links, ChatGPT is more like a database you can play around with. For example, search Google for a list of US presidents and you might get them ordered by birth date, by term years, or by age at inauguration. But what if you want a list of US presidents ordered by their wife\u2019s age at the time of their death? Or what about a list of all current NFL coaches ordered by debut year? These kinds of highly-specific, dynamic queries are an example where ChatGPT shines over Google Search. ChatGPT will actually do things for you What\u2019s better than being told how to do something? Someone else doing it for you, of course! Especially when that something is a menial task like writing emails or generating itineraries. With Google Search, you\u2019re stuck navigating websites that tell you things\u2014advice, walkthroughs, fun facts\u2014but with ChatGPT, you get an interactive assistant that can generate written and visual content for you. For example, maybe you need a refreshed job r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Searching Google might lead you to various templates that can help you get started, but ChatGPT can create a personalize r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for you. All you have to do is feed it the right information and maybe tweak the results a bit. Further reading: Never say these things to ChatGPT, or else",

      "text": "If you\u2019ve spent any amount of time using ChatGPT, you already know that it often requires lengthy explanations, prompt tweaks, and/or extra context to get it doing what you actually meant. Often, but not always.\nChatGPT is capable of performing useful tasks with single, one-line prompts. When worded correctly, ChatGPT will perform the following tasks without hesitation, without extra context, and without issue \u2014 though as always, AI can sometimes suffer from inaccurate \u201challucinations,\u201d so be sure to double check ChatGPT\u2019s work for critical or sensitive needs. Let\u2019s dig in!\nGet meal ideas from available ingredients\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nMost of us endure busy working lives these days, which leaves little time for doing much of anything else\u2014and that can include grocery shopping for the ingredients needed for home-cooked meals. Thankfully, if you ever find yourself with a small set of ingredients and no idea what to make with them, ChatGPT can help.\nJust list the staple (and otherwise) ingredients you have available and ask ChatGPT for some meal ideas using them. As an example, I asked, \u201cWhat meals can I make with rice, eggs, and frozen mixed vegetables?\u201d ChatGPT suggested egg fried rice, a vegetable rice omelet, and baked egg fried rice muffins, among others. Pretty nifty in a pinch.\nTroubleshoot tech and home repair problems\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nWhen something goes wrong, your first instinct might be to panic or shut down\u2014but maybe it should be to ask ChatGPT for help instead. ChatGPT can provide troubleshooting help whenever you\u2019re stuck dealing with an unknown or unexpected issue.\nJust ask ChatGPT to provide a list of troubleshooting steps for whatever has gone wrong. In my case, I\u2019ve asked what I can do about a Windows laptop that has stopped working\u2014my short prompt of \u201cPlease list some troubleshooting steps for a Windows laptop that has stopped working\u201d resulted in a solid list of 10 things I could try.\nThis is equally useful for all kinds of other problems, like if your toilet randomly flushes on its own every so often, if your car starts making a weird noise, or if your wireless router is on the fritz. Just make sure you never share sensitive personal data with ChatGPT!\nCreate tailor-made workout routines\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nWhile YouTube remains an option when looking for a workout routine, ChatGPT can provide you with ones that are as general or as specific as you need them to be. Want exercises for people your age? Or stretches for an aching lower back? Or simple workouts you can do at home without any equiment? Ones you can do at your desk? No worries!\nI personally asked ChatGPT, \u201cPlease create a short workout routine a 40-year-old can do in their lounge.\u201d (I\u2019m a bit older than 40, but what better way to stay young than to work out as a younger person would?) ChatGPT came through for me with a 20-minute low-impact workout routine that I found challenging but doable. It\u2019s one of the many ways you can use ChatGPT to actually improve your life.\nGenerate comprehensive checklists\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nChecklists are so useful for when you absolutely don\u2019t want to forget an important step, like when you\u2019re packing for vacation, hosting a party, or spring cleaning your home. ChatGPT can help by creating checklists for lots of different scenarios\u2014and for best results, you\u2019ll want to include specific details to clue ChatGPT into your specific needs.\nI asked ChatGPT to \u201cPlease provide me with a checklist for packing for a vacation to Italy in September.\u201d Note that I mentioned both the location and time of year I was visiting! The more context you can provide in your prompt, the more accurate and helpful the checklist will be.\nExplain concepts (like I\u2019m 5)\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nWith a single, one-line prompt, ChatGPT can explain even the most complex concepts in a way that you can grasp. Want to understand nuclear fission? Or how EV batteries work? Or what kind of engineering goes into modern data centers? Just ask!\nBut make sure to tack on the \u201clike I\u2019m 5\u201d to your prompt\u2014taken from the ELI5 trope on Reddit\u2014so that ChatGPT dumbs down the subject enough to be digestible no matter your background. As an example, I asked ChatGPT to explain the concept of time travel like I\u2019m 5. (Feel free to change the age or add any other qualifiers you want.)\nSummarize online articles\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nDo you feel like you\u2019re inundated with so much information that you just can\u2019t keep up or absorb it all? You aren\u2019t alone. There are billions of web pages out there\u2014no one has the time or energy to read every single thing that catches their eye. Thankfully, ChatGPT can help by analyzing any online article and spitting out the most important bits.\nIn the example above, I asked ChatGPT to summarize my own article about mundane tasks ChatGPT can handle for you\u2014and it accurately broke it down, correctly citing PCWorld as the source throughout. In testing, I found that ChatGPT sometimes even pulls info from other sources to fill in details and provide more context.\nSee what happened on a day in history\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nIt\u2019s important to not only know what has happened in the past, but to understand why those things happened. You could work your way through encyclopedias and history books, spending years of your life absorbing facts and putting them together\u2026 or you could put ChatGPT to work and get it to do all the heavy lifting for you.\nWith a simple prompt, ChatGPT can list all the major historical events that have happened on a particular day. You can ask about a specific day in a specific year, or the same particular day throughout the years. If the response stokes your interest, you can follow up with probing queries and learn more. But for many, the initial one-line prompt should suffice.\nAnswer simple trivia questions\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, you frequently come across questions to which you don\u2019t know their answers. Not to worry! You can just ask ChatGPT to answer those questions for you, pronto.\nI\u2019m talking about questions with definitive answers, such as trivia. Who won a certain sports tournament in a given year? What year was a certain music album released? Which mountain is the tallest in the world? That sort of thing. Any question with an open-ended answer, or one with multiple potential answers, could complicate matters.\nLearn a new word every day\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nI love learning something new every day, whether it\u2019s practical and purposeful or gimmicky and trivial. One thing that blends both ends of the spectrum is the concept of a \u201cword of the day\u201d\u2014and ChatGPT can provide you with a new word every day via a one-line prompt.\nJust input, \u201cPlease provide a word of the day for today.\u201d ChatGPT will then provide a word along with its meaning, origin, and an example of it used in a sentence. It will then ask if you\u2019d like a different word each day from then on, saving you from ever having to ask again.\nCombine tasks like this with ChatGPT\u2019s nifty \u201cscheduled tasks\u201d feature to boost your productivity and save lots of time!\nTranslate words or simple phrases\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nIf you\u2019re traveling abroad, you should try to learn some of the local language. Sure, most people around the world speak enough English to get by, but that\u2019s no excuse for being lazy! Pick a few choice words or phrases and learn how to say them in the language of the country you\u2019re visiting\u2014and that\u2019s something ChatGPT can help you with.\nTo be clear, ChatGPT is more than capable of translating longer phrases and even whole articles, documents, and publications. However, once you enter that kind of territory, you\u2019re leaving the \u201cone-line prompt\u201d zone and will need to write prompts that are more complex.\nConvert units of measurement\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nAs a kid, I never imagined how often I would need to convert one type of unit into another\u2014but as an adult, I\u2019m doing it far too often. While Google and other tools do a decent job of converting all types of units, I\u2019ve actually found ChatGPT more capable.\nIn this example, I asked ChatGPT to \u201cconvert 100 centimeters into feet and inches.\u201d It converted 100 centimeters into both feet and inches along with its reasoning. You\u2019ll be pleased to know that the math checks out!\nFurther reading: 9 mundane chores ChatGPT can handle in seconds, saving you hours"

      "text": "You might already be one of the millions around the world using ChatGPT to help out with mundane tasks and automate menial chores. But ChatGPT is capable of much more than just answers and automations. Indeed, ChatGPT can actually be fun!\nWith some creative prompting, you can use ChatGPT for all kinds of out-of-the-box stuff\u2014social experiments, hypothetical scenarios, product inventions, even simulated chats with fictional characters.\nIf you\u2019re new to ChatGPT, here are some interesting and unusual things to try that might just blow your mind.\nDisclaimer: ChatGPT is just a predictive language generator and doesn\u2019t actually \u201cthink\u201d for itself. It doesn\u2019t \u201cknow\u201d what it\u2019s saying and is therefore prone to hallucinations, falsehoods, and nonsense. Always approach ChatGPT\u2019s responses with a degree of skepticism!\nRun experiments on a fictional town\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nOne of the most fascinating things I\u2019ve done with ChatGPT is create a virtual town to conduct experiments on\u2014and you can easily try this out yourself! Just ask ChatGPT to create a fictional town and the AI chatbot will do the rest. You can base it on a real town, specify the population count and/or demographics, and provide as much detail as you want.\nOnce your fictional town exists, you can then run experiments on its population and infrastructure\u2014and it\u2019s up to you how malevolent or benevolent you want to be. Either way, ChatGPT will detail the effects of your experimental actions and you can laugh maniacally at what you\u2019ve inflicted on the (thankfully) non-existent population.\nSimulate potential outcomes of scenarios\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nHave you ever wondered what the most likely outcome would be if a certain scenario came to pass? Well, you don\u2019t have to wonder anymore. You can simply ask ChatGPT to see what would happen\u2014and it works with real-world scenarios or imaginary ones, with scenarios ranging from serious to silly to morbid to outlandish.\nFor example, I\u2019ve asked ChatGPT things like what would happen if North and South Korea were to reunify and what would happen if (in a plot stolen directly from The Avengers) half of the world\u2019s population were to disappear in an instant. Both responses made for fascinating\u2014though slightly scary\u2014reading. Your imagination is the limit here!\nExplore historical what-ifs\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nIn a similar vein to the above, you can ask ChatGPT to explain what would have likely happened if history played out differently. What if dragons were real creatures in medieval Europe? What if the Roman empire had never collapsed? What if Genghis Khan was never born?\nOne obvious example that I just had to explore was what would life be like now if the Axis powers had beaten the Allies in World War II. Turns out, ChatGPT\u2019s interpretation of what the last 80 years might\u2019ve been like makes for grim reading.\nThankfully, more light-hearted scenarios are also on the table, such as what would have happened had Will Smith never slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars in 2022. Have some fun with it!\nChat with fictional characters\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nHave you ever wanted to have a casual chat with Superman? Or ask Mickey Mouse what it\u2019s like to be such an iconic pop culture character? Well, now you can! Just inform ChatGPT that you want to have a chat with a given fictional character and it will do the rest. You can even specify the type of chat you want and/or what you want to discuss.\nFor example, I had great fun asking Clark Kent about his relationship with Lois Lane and how he copes with leading a double life. I had just as much fun asking Mickey Mouse about his relationship with Walt Disney and what it\u2019s like to have been famous for a century.\nMy colleague Jon Martindale does something similar by using ChatGPT as a kind of virtual counselor, treating it as if it were a person and \u201ctalking things out\u201d with the AI chatbot!\nPlay an interactive text adventure\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nI grew up playing text adventures, first in the form of choose-your-own-adventure paperback books where every decision took you to a specific page, and later in the form of computer games. I have a nostalgic itch for these games that I occasionally like to scratch.\nChatGPT has made that a lot easier, as it can create a playable text adventure all within the chatbot itself. Simply ask ChatGPT to create one, giving it as much or as little detail as you want.\nIn this example, I didn\u2019t direct ChatGPT at all as far as what the story should be\u2014and I ended up exploring a forest seeking a lost memory. The whole thing was cleverly constructed and left me pondering the nature of identity and how costly it can be to seek knowledge.\nGenerate characters for stories or DnD\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nIf you\u2019re ever stumped when creating a character for any kind of medium\u2014whether a short story, a D&D campaign, or freeform roleplaying\u2014then ChatGPT can help. Provide some barebones details about what sort of character you want and what the intended medium is.\nWhile ChatGPT is great for one-line prompts, character generation is an area where the more information you provide, the better. You\u2019ll get best results if you define the genre, basic plot, any specific quirks or ideas you might have yourself, plus other factors. After all, you don\u2019t want ChatGPT creating a sci-fi alien raider when you need a love story hunk.\nWhen it comes to D&D character generation, you probably have something in mind already, so direct ChatGPT as much as you can. One neat trick here is to provide a fictional character (such as Iron Man) to use as the basis for your new D&D character.\nDebate two sides of an argument\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nChatGPT is quite capable at considering both sides of an argument in a logical way, which makes it the perfect tool when you need a third party to mediate an argument\u2014whether that argument is between you and someone else, or just one you\u2019re debating in your own head.\nAs an example, I asked ChatGPT to help me look at both sides of the debate around investing more money in space travel. Some people see humanity reaching out to the stars as the best way forward, while others see it as a waste of money. ChatGPT looked at the pros and cons of each side and ended with a sensible set of conclusions.\nHowever, it did end up sitting on the fence a bit, so you may need to push it harder if you want a strong answer one way or the other. Maybe you lean one way and you want ChatGPT to persuade you! Just make sure you don\u2019t threaten ChatGPT because that doesn\u2019t work anymore.\nInvent new products from text descriptions\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nChatGPT can serve as a dummy for bouncing ideas off of, which comes in handy when you\u2019re in a creative rut\u2014or when you just want to have some fun. For example, if you\u2019re looking at a product you use on the regular and wondering how it could be improved, just ask ChatGPT to provide some next-gen ideas for it.\nGoing one step further, if you already have an idea for an invention in your head but no idea whether it would work or how to bring it to fruition, ChatGPT can help with that. Just describe the invention you have in your head and it\u2019ll explore the potential of the idea, create a mock visual of it, and even suggest ways to improve upon it.\nAsk ChatGPT to analyze itself\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nLast but not least, I present the most meta of these creative ways to use ChatGPT\u2014and it\u2019s potentially the most fascinating of the lot. It involves you asking ChatGPT to analyze itself. Who (or what) is it? What does it do and why? Is it likely to be a force for good or bad? Etc.\nYou can ask ChatGPT to delve as deeply as you\u2019re comfortable doing, pushing it to consider philosophical questions about its existence, ethical questions about its capabilities, the long-term sociental impact it could have, and more. The responses might surprise you.\nJust remember the disclaimer from the start of this article: ChatGPT is a language model and isn\u2019t \u201csentient\u201d or \u201cself-aware\u201d to any degree. Don\u2019t be fooled into \u201cbelieving\u201d anything it says about itself. This is just a fun and silly exercise, not a real self-analysis with weight.\nFurther reading: Awesomely practical ways to use ChatGPT"

      "text": "Whether you embrace it or not, AI is shaping the future of Google Search. Google is bringing AI Mode to Google Search for every U.S. user, beginning today.\nGoogle launched AI Overviews a year ago, which aims to answer your question before showing the traditional list of links. AI Mode is the next step: from what Google has shown, the list of links will disappear entirely, replaced by tiny link icons that link back to the information Google is slurping up.\nGoogle\u2019s Liz Reid, a Google vice president and head of Google Search, said that AI Overviews totals 1.5 billion users and will be expanded to over 200 countries. At the beginning of May, Google migrated AI Mode out of its Labs environment into a small subset of users in the real world and has apparently replaced the \u201cI\u2019m feeling lucky\u201d button with an AI search button as well.\nIt\u2019s not clear whether AI Mode will be the default search for all U.S. users, or whether Google will allow users to express a preference or preserve the choices they\u2019ve made before. Traditional search doesn\u2019t look like it will go away, but it will be relegated to a different tab, in much the same way a search for \u201cImages\u201d requires you to shift to another search tab within Google. Reid said that it\u2019s bringing AI Mode to AI overviews, too.\n(After Google I/O\u2019s initial keynote concluded, Google pushed out AI Mode to Google Search, but it defaulted to a traditional list of links, at least from my perspective. A screenshot is further below.)\n\u201cWe use what we call a query fan-out technique,\u201d Reid said, in describing how AI Mode works. \u201cAnd this basically takes your question and it breaks it up into different subtopics, and then we search on each of those different search topics that allows us to go way deeper in the web and find that really hyper-relevant, incredibly specific content that might be great with you.\u201d\nFoundry\nGoogle said that it\u2019s upgrading the version of Gemini that powers its AI Mode to a more advanced version and bringing the technology to mobile, too. \u201cDeep Search\u201d will be more like the \u201cDeep Research\u201d mode in Gemini, where, behind the scenes, Gemini will issue dozens of separate searches and then aggregate the results. Google\u2019s AI Mode may even generate custom graphs to present information from search and finance questions, Reid said.\nAgentic search is coming to AI Mode, too. What Google has previously known as \u201cProject Mariner\u201d can be used to research the cheapest seats for a specific game. AI Mode will then start digging through various shopping sites and point you to the cheapest seats. Finally, the Project Astra technology Google showed off last year is being added to Gemini Live so that it can \u201csee\u201d through your smartphone\u2019s camera and then talk through any problems you might have.\nYou can also add data from Gmail, Google Drive, etc. to affect your searches.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be pulling all of that in,\u201d Reid said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to always be in control. So it\u2019s your choice to opt in to doing this in the first place, but you can connect and disconnect it at any time going forward.\u201d\nBad news for tech publishers\nIt\u2019s impossible to entirely disconnect what Google is doing or how it will affect major media \u2014 meaning that it\u2019s difficult to remain entirely objective. Put simply, Google\u2019s AI overviews and AI Mode pass off third-party news, opinions, roundups, and data as (almost) Google\u2019s own, links or not. Major publishers are beginning to sound alarm bells, and even Google itself is worried about losing money from Google Search ads.\nWill users click through to the sites where an AI Mode summary originates? Search data says no, though Google disagrees.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen with AI overviews is that pages with AI overviews get higher quality clicks to websites,\u201d Reid said. \u201cAnd you might ask, what does that really mean? And what it means is people spend more time on those websites. They\u2019re not going to those sites and immediately figuring out it\u2019s not what they want and bouncing back. They\u2019re really digging in to the content there, and that\u2019s our goal with AI Mode as well.\u201d\nGoogle seems like it\u2019s being pressured by Wall Street, who seem to be wondering if Google will fall behind Anthropic and OpenAI, both of which use AI to replace traditional search results. Microsoft, too, has an AI-powered replacement for Bing Search waiting in the wings called Copilot Search. But Google remains the Web\u2019s top search engine, and it apparently aims to stay that way.\n\u201cThe way you can think about that is AI mode is not just this AI-powered experience end to end, but it also is a glimpse of what\u2019s to come in search overall,\u201d Reid said. Great.\nUpdated at 12:17 PM with an additional screenshot and detail."

      "text": "There\u2019s no denying that ChatGPT and other AI chatbots make impressive chat companions that can converse with you on just about anything.\nTheir conversational powers can be extremely convincing too; if they\u2019ve made you feel safe about sharing your personal details, you\u2019re not alone. But \u2014 newsflash! \u2014 you\u2019re not talking to your toaster. Anything you tell an AI chatbot can be stored on a server and resurface later, a fact that makes them inherently risky.\nWhy are chatbots so risky?\nThe problem stems from how the companies that run Large Language Models (LLMs) and their associated chatbots use your personal data \u2014 essentially, to train better bots.\nTake the movie Terminator 2: Judgment Day as an example of how an LLM learns. In the film, the future leader of the human resistance against Skynet, the child John Connor, teaches the Terminator, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, personal slogans like \u201cHasta la vista baby\u201d in an attempt to make it more human.\nSuffice it to say, it learns those phrases and uses them at the most inopportune times \u2014 which is kind of funny.\nLess funny is the way your data gets harvested and used by companies to update and teach their own AI models to be more human.\nDominic Bayley / IDG\nOpenAI\u2019s terms and conditions outline its right to do this when you use its platform. It states: \u201cWe may use the data you provide us to improve our models.\u201d It\u2019s the reason ChatGPT logs everything \u2014 yes, everything \u2014 that you say to it. That is, unless you make use of the chatbot\u2019s new privacy feature which allows you to toggle a setting to prevent your chat history being saved.\nIf you don\u2019t do that, details like your financial information, passwords, home address, phone number, or what you ate for breakfast are fair game \u2014 if you share those details. It also stores any files you upload and any feedback you give it.\nChatGPT\u2019s Ts&Cs also states that the chatbot may \u201caggregate or de-identify Personal Information and use the aggregated information to analyze the effectiveness of our Services.\u201d It\u2019s a small addition, but it opens the possibility that something the chatbot has learned will be later accessed by the public \u2014 a troubling thought indeed.\nWhy should you care?\nTo be fair, it\u2019s highly unlikely any company running an AI chatbot intends to misuse the personal information they store. In recent years OpenAI has released statements intended to reassure ChatGPT users about the collection and use of personal data.\nFor example, in February this year when it was accused by Italy\u2019s Data Protection Authority (DPA) of breaching provisions contained in the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), OpenAI told the BBC: \u201cWe want our AI to learn about the world, not about private individuals.\u201d\nThen this: \u201cWe actively work to reduce personal data in training our systems like ChatGPT, which also rejects requests for private or sensitive information about people.\u201d\nThat may be true, but it doesn\u2019t guarantee user data is safe from breaches. One such breach occurred In May 2023, in which hackers exploited a vulnerability in ChatGPT\u2019s Redis library, giving them access to the stored personal data from chat histories.\nThe leaked personal information included names, social security numbers, job titles, email addresses, phone numbers, and even social media profiles. OpenAI responded by fixing the vulnerability, but it was little consolation to the approximately 101,000 users whose data had already been stolen.\nAnd it\u2019s not just individuals having privacy issues with AI chatbots either. Indeed, companies, too, are scrambling to keep a lid on confidential company data amid notable high-profile data leaks. One such leak was discovered by Samsung when it found that its own engineers had accidentally uploaded sensitive source code to ChatGPT.\nIn response, In May 2023 the company banned the use of ChatGPT and other generative AI chatbots from being used for work purposes. Companies like Bank of America, Citigroup, and JPMorgan have since followed suit.\nAwareness is growing but it\u2019s early days\nOf late there\u2019s been a growing awareness about the dangers of AI chatbots at the level of the government and industry, which is a promising sign for the tightening up of data security.\nOne big move forward happened on October 30 last year, when U.S. President Joe Biden signed an Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and use of Artificial Intelligence \u2014 a document that outlines the key principles governing the use of AI in the U.S.\nOne of the priority points stipulates that \u201cAI systems must respect privacy and protect personal data.\u201d Exactly how that is to be implemented, though, is yet to be seen and could be open to interpretation by AI companies.\nKind of contrary to that point is the fact that there\u2019s still no clear law in the U.S. stating that training AI on data without the consent of an owner is any kind of copyright infringement. Instead, it can be considered fair use \u2014 which means there\u2019s nothing solid in place to safeguard consumers\u2019 rights.\nUntil we get something firmer, as individuals our best line of defense is still simply to not overshare. By treating an AI chatbot like the algorithm it is, rather than a trusted friend, no matter how much it compliments you on your hairstyle or choice of clothing, you can at least keep a lid on what it knows about you from your end."

      "text": "It should come as no surprise that students the world over are using ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence chatbots to cheat. On homework, on tests, and on anything else you care to mention. After all, why work something out yourself when there\u2019s an AI chatbot waiting and willing to do the hard work for you?\nThis is obviously a problem in need of fixing, and OpenAI\u2019s answer is a Study Mode that\u2019s now baked into ChatGPT. The idea is to stop students from simply asking ChatGPT to tell them the answer to a question, and to have ChatGPT teach them how to answer the question for themselves.\nWill this work? Possibly. Maybe. Probably not. Either way, I gave ChatGPT\u2019s Study Mode a spin for ourselves to find out what it\u2019s capable of \u2013 and I wound up utterly loving it.\nHow to enable ChatGPT\u2019s Study Mode\nDave Parrack/Foundry\nFirst things first. In order to use Study Mode, you\u2019ll need to be logged into ChatGPT. Then, under the invitation to \u201cAsk Anything,\u201d click Tools > Study and Learn. This will put ChatGPT into Study Mode, forcing the AI chatbot to respond in a very different way than it usually does.\nChatGPT offers three default prompts in Study Mode: \u201cHelp me with my homework,\u201d \u201cExplain a topic to me,\u201d and \u201cCreate a practice quiz.\u201d You can either select one of these or provide ChatGPT with another prompt to deal with. I initially asked it to explain a topic to me, forcing it to ask for more details as to what I was studying and what grade I am in.\nI answered truthfully that I was a mature adult learning purely for the sake of learning. That way, ChatGPT knew exactly who and what it was dealing with. It then offered up some fascinating topics we could explore together, from ancient empires through to quantum physics. I chose the latter because it\u2019s a fascinating subject. I then got a basic explanation of quantum physics before ChatGPT paused to throw a question back at me. Namely, how do I picture an electron in an atom? The point was to force me to actively think about the subject and what I think I know about it rather than just passively absorb whatever information ChatGPT offered up.\nWhy I love ChatGPT\u2019s Study Mode\nDave Parrack/Foundry\nThis is, in a nutshell, why I love ChatGPT\u2019s Study Mode. It forces ChatGPT to teach you, and forces you to learn. I find the interactions regarding a specific subject matter much more useful when in Study Mode than in the AI chatbot\u2019s regular mode. It\u2019s the old adage about teaching a man to fish writ large. Sure, just like a calculator would, ChatGPT could just tell me what 32 multiplied by 53 is, but that only helps me once. Explain the easiest way to multiple 32 by 53, however, and that helps me for life.\nBeyond that essential raison d\u2019etre, I love the way ChatGPT\u2019s Study Mode seeks to continue the conversation at all costs. While the regular ChatGPT mode is also good at encouraging follow-ups, Study Mode ramps things up a notch \u2014 leading to me having a long, ranging conversation about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, for example. ChatGPT has taught me something, I have learned something, and it was a collaborative effort.\nI also love the way that ChatGPT\u2019s Study Mode changes the essence of what generative AI is and does. So far, AI has been seen as a quick fix for problems. From managing mundane chores for you, to achieving everyday tasks with single, one-line prompts, generative AI has taken the lead. Whereas, once ChatGPT has been switched into Study Mode, it forces you to do the work yourself. Turning it from a lecturer to a teacher, from a servant to an assistant.\nChatGPT\u2019s Study Mode: Room for improvement\nDave Parrack/Foundry\nIs ChatGPT\u2019s Study Mode perfect? No. But then this is just the first iteration, with OpenAI committed to improving it. One obvious way of doing so would be to have an option to lock ChatGPT into Study Mode. That would prevent students (or just curious adults such as myself) from getting so far before simply giving up and asking for the answer. However, regardless of how Study Mode evolves, it has already given me a new way of interacting with ChatGPT.\nIf you try ChatGPT\u2019s Study Mode for yourself, I recommend pushing beyond the default options, and experimenting with prompts. Options range from questions as simple as, \u201cWhat are the three states of matter?\u201d to questions a lot deeper and likely to force a longer back-and-forth discussion, such as \u201cWhat is the meaning of life?\u201d\nI asked the latter in both ChatGPT\u2019s Regular Mode and Study Mode, and the responses were very different. In Regular Mode, ChatGPT simply offered up some possible answers based on different interpretations of the question. However, while in Study Mode, ChatGPT asked me what I myself thought the meaning of life was.\nWhich is 42, obviously. Thanks for all the fish, ChatGPT Study Mode."

      "text": "It\u2019s the start of Google\u2019s yearly I/O developer event today. But Google doesn\u2019t seem all that interested in telling developers what they\u2019ll be able to do with Google \u2014 it\u2019s more interested in telling regular users all the cool stuff that the company\u2019s Gemini AI can do right now, and will be able to do in the future. Presenters really wanted us to know we\u2019re in the \u201cGemini era.\u201d\nWhat does that mean for regular users? More or less, it\u2019s all about smarter searching that pulls more and deeper information from more websites, and organizes it in smart ways. It all starts with \u201cAI Overviews,\u201d the new, fancy version of the Rich Results you currently see before (and sometimes to the right of) standard text results. AI Overview will soon be graduating from the Search Labs walled-off area to standard users in the US, with Google hoping to expand it to \u201cover a billion people by the end of the year.\u201d\nThese auto-generated results created from indexed and crawled websites will include the familiar \u201cpeople also ask\u201d queries, shopping results (which, of course, earn Google some ad revenue), and results for more complex questions phrased in natural language. The example on the Google Search blog and given live on stage include \u201cfind the best yoga or pilates studios in Boston and show me details on their intro offers, and walking time from Beacon Hill [Boston].\u201d AI-generated results include the local studios in card form with a map showing their location relative to the smartphone user. Pretty standard stuff.\nIt\u2019s worth pointing out that Google claims people are \u201cvisiting a greater diversity of websites for help with more complex questions\u201d with this tool. But how that actually translates into traffic to said websites was not elucidated. AI-powered general results, with their source context hard to dig into or purposefully obscured, is a concern for the sustainability of the websites Google Search is built upon.\nA much more impressive demo was taking a live photo with Google Lens, asking vocally about the context, and then being delivered relevant results. The presenter took a video of an analog record player, asked why \u201cthis\u201d wasn\u2019t staying in place, and was given step-by-step troubleshooting tips for fixing the tonearm of that exact model of turntable. That\u2019s more of the \u201cmagic\u201d feeling Google was hoping for throughout its presentation\u2026though you\u2019ll only get to try it out in Search Labs, sometime \u201csoon\u201d in the US."

      "text": "ChatGPT is rapidly changing the world. The process is already happening, and it\u2019s only going to accelerate as the technology improves, as more people gain access to it, and as more learn how to use it.\nWhat\u2019s shocking is just how many tasks ChatGPT is already capable of managing for you. While the naysayers may still look down their noses at the potential of AI assistants, I\u2019ve been using it to handle all kinds of menial tasks for me. Here are my favorite examples.\nFurther reading: This tiny ChatGPT feature helps me tackle my days more productively\nWrite your emails for you\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nWe\u2019ve all been faced with the tricky task of writing an email\u2014whether personal or professional\u2014but not knowing quite how to word it. ChatGPT can do the heavy lifting for you, penning the (hopefully) perfect email based on whatever information you feed it.\nLet\u2019s assume the email you need to write is of a professional nature, and wording it poorly could negatively affect your career. By directing ChatGPT to write the email with a particular structure, content, and tone of voice, you can give yourself a huge head start.\nA winning tip for this is to never accept ChatGPT\u2019s first attempt. Always read through it and look for areas of improvement, then request tweaks to ensure you get the best possible email. You can (and should) also rewrite the email in your own voice. Learn more about how ChatGPT coached my colleague to write better emails.\nGenerate itineraries and schedules\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nIf you\u2019re going on a trip but you\u2019re the type of person who hates planning trips, then you should utilize ChatGPT\u2019s ability to generate trip itineraries. The results can be customized to the nth degree depending on how much detail and instruction you\u2019re willing to provide.\nAs someone who likes to get away at least once a year but also wants to make the most of every trip, leaning on ChatGPT for an itinerary is essential for me. I\u2019ll provide the location and the kinds of things I want to see and do, then let it handle the rest. Instead of spending days researching everything myself, ChatGPT does 80 percent of it for me.\nAs with all of these tasks, you don\u2019t need to accept ChatGPT\u2019s first effort. Use different prompts to force the AI chatbot to shape the itinerary closer to what you want. You\u2019d be surprised at how many cool ideas you\u2019ll encounter this way\u2014simply nix the ones you don\u2019t like.\nBreak down difficult concepts\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nOne of the best tasks to assign to ChatGPT is the explanation of difficult concepts. Ask ChatGPT to explain any concept you can think of and it will deliver more often than not. You can tailor the level of explanation you need, and even have it include visual elements.\nLet\u2019s say, for example, that a higher-up at work regularly lectures everyone about the importance of networking. But maybe they never go into detail about what they mean, just constantly pushing the why without explaining the what. Well, just ask ChatGPT to explain networking!\nOkay, most of us know what \u201cnetworking\u201d is and the concept isn\u2019t very hard to grasp. But you can do this with anything. Ask ChatGPT to explain augmented reality, multi-threaded processing, blockchain, large language models, what have you. It will provide you with a clear and simple breakdown, maybe even with analogies and images.\nAnalyze and make tough decisions\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nWe all face tough decisions every so often. The next time you find yourself wrestling with a particularly tough one\u2014and you just can\u2019t decide one way or the other\u2014try asking ChatGPT for guidance and advice.\nIt may sound strange to trust any kind of decision to artificial intelligence, let alone an important one that has you stumped, but doing so actually makes a lot of sense. While human judgment can be clouded by emotions, AI can set that aside and prioritize logic.\nIt should go without saying: you don\u2019t have to accept ChatGPT\u2019s answers. Use the AI to weigh the pros and cons, to help you understand what\u2019s most important to you, and to suggest a direction. Who knows? If you find yourself not liking the answer given, that in itself might clarify what you actually want\u2014and the right answer for you. This is the kind of stuff ChatGPT can do to improve your life.\nPlan complex projects and strategies\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nMost jobs come with some level of project planning and management. Even I, as a freelance writer, need to plan tasks to get projects completed on time. And that\u2019s where ChatGPT can prove invaluable, breaking projects up into smaller, more manageable parts.\nChatGPT needs to know the nature of the project, the end goal, any constraints you may have, and what you have done so far. With that information, it can then break the project up with a step-by-step plan, and break it down further into phases (if required).\nIf ChatGPT doesn\u2019t initially split your project up in a way that suits you, try again. Change up the prompts and make the AI chatbot tune in to exactly what you\u2019re looking for. It takes a bit of back and forth, but it can shorten your planning time from hours to mere minutes.\nCompile research notes\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nIf you need to research a given topic of interest, ChatGPT can save you the hassle of compiling that research. For example, ahead of a trip to Croatia, I wanted to know more about the Croatian War of Independence, so I asked ChatGPT to provide me with a brief summary of the conflict with bullet points to help me understand how it happened.\nAfter absorbing all that information, I asked ChatGPT to add a timeline of the major events, further helping me to understand how the conflict played out. ChatGPT then offered to provide me with battle maps and/or summaries, plus profiles of the main players.\nYou can go even deeper with ChatGPT\u2019s Deep Research feature, which is now available to free users, up to 5 Deep Research tasks per month. With Deep Research, ChatGPT conducts multi-step research to generate comprehensive reports (with citations!) based on large amounts of information across the internet. A Deep Research task can take up to 30 minutes to complete, but it\u2019ll save you hours or even days.\nSummarize articles, meetings, and more\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nThere are only so many hours in the day, yet so many new articles published on the web day in and day out. When you come across extra-long reads, it can be helpful to run them through ChatGPT for a quick summary. Then, if the summary is lacking in any way, you can go back and plow through the article proper.\nAs an example, I ran one of my own PCWorld articles (where I compared Bluesky and Threads as alternatives to X) through ChatGPT, which provided a brief summary of my points and broke down the best X alternative based on my reasons given. Interestingly, it also pulled elements from other articles. (Hmph.) If you don\u2019t want that, you can tell ChatGPT to limit its summary to the contents of the link.\nThis is a great trick to use for other long-form, text-heavy content that you just don\u2019t have the time to crunch through. Think transcripts for interviews, lectures, videos, and Zoom meetings. The only caveat is to never share private details with ChatGPT, like company-specific data that\u2019s protected by NDAs and the like.\nCreate Q&A flashcards for learning\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nFlashcards can be extremely useful for drilling a lot of information into your brain, such as when studying for an exam, onboarding in a new role, prepping for an interview, etc. And with ChatGPT, you no longer have to painstakingly create those flashcards yourself. All you have to do is tell the AI the details of what you\u2019re studying.\nYou can specify the format (such as Q&A or multiple choice), as well as various other elements. You can also choose to keep things broad or target specific sub-topics or concepts you want to focus on. You can even upload your own notes for ChatGPT to reference. You can also use Google\u2019s NotebookLM app in a similar way.\nProvide interview practice\nDave Parrack / Foundry\nWhether you\u2019re a first-time jobseeker or have plenty of experience under your belt, it\u2019s always a good idea to practice for your interviews when making career moves. Years ago, you might\u2019ve had to ask a friend or family member to act as your mock interviewer. These days, ChatGPT can do it for you\u2014and do it more effectively.\nInform ChatGPT of the job title, industry, and level of position you\u2019re interviewing for, what kind of interview it\u2019ll be (e.g., screener, technical assessment, group/panel, one-on-one with CEO), and anything else you want it to take into consideration. ChatGPT will then conduct a mock interview with you, providing feedback along the way.\nWhen I tried this out myself, I was shocked by how capable ChatGPT can be at pretending to be a human in this context. And the feedback it provides for each answer you give is invaluable for knocking off your rough edges and improving your chances of success when you\u2019re interviewed by a real hiring manager.\nFurther reading: No, don\u2019t threaten ChatGPT for better results. Try this instead"
