  "title": "Vault Minerals Limited Earnings Missed Analyst Estimates: Here's What Analysts Are Forecasting Now",
  "description": "Shareholders of Vault Minerals Limited ( ASX:VAU ) will be pleased this week, given that the stock price is up 15% to...",
  "content": "Shareholders of Vault Minerals Limited (ASX:VAU) will be pleased this week, given that the stock price is up 15% to AU$0.49 following its latest yearly results. It was not a great result overall. While revenues of AU$1.4b were in line with analyst predictions, earnings were less than expected, missing statutory estimates by 10% to hit AU$0.035 per share. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Vault Minerals after the latest results.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Vault Minerals' nine analysts is for revenues of AU$1.59b in 2026. This would reflect a meaningful 11% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to surge 27% to AU$0.044. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of AU$1.60b and earnings per share (EPS) of AU$0.047 in 2026. So it looks like there's been a small decline in overall sentiment after the recent results - there's been no major change to revenue estimates, but the analysts did make a small dip in their earnings per share forecasts.\n\nThe consensus price target held steady at AU$0.61, with the analysts seemingly voting that their lower forecast earnings are not expected to lead to a lower stock price in the foreseeable future. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Vault Minerals, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at AU$0.75 and the most bearish at AU$0.50 per share. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.\n\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. We would highlight that Vault Minerals' revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 11% annualised growth rate until the end of 2026 being well below the historical 43% p.a. growth over the last five years. Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 5.1% per year. Even after the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Vault Minerals is also expected to grow faster than the wider industry.",
