  "title": "These Were the 9 Phones That Ruled the Streets Before Touchscreens Took Over",
  "description": "Touchscreens stole the spotlight, but these phones built the stage.",
  "content": "Before the age of endless swipes and glass rectangles, mobile phones came in every imaginable shape and size, each with its own quirks. These devices filled pockets, purses, and street corners long before touchscreens became the default.\n\nWhen it comes to early mobile phone fame, the Motorola DynaTAC is the undisputed icon. Released in the 1980s, it was massive, expensive, and looked like something out of a sci-fi film. Towering at about 10 inches, tipping the scales at 2.5 pounds, and sporting a hefty $3,995 price tag at that time, this behemoth gave a mere 30 minutes of talk time after a grueling 10-hour charge. Today, pristine DynaTAC 8000X units have morphed into rare collector's items, some fetching over $21,000 on eBay, the price of a budget car.\n\nBut Motorola didn't stop there. Motorola's obsession with miniaturization culminated in the MicroTAC, released in 1989. This model introduced what we'd now call a \"semi-flip\" design, where the mouthpiece folded over the keypad to protect it and to make the whole thing feel more compact. It sold for roughly $2,500\u2013$3,500 at the time and was the first phone that truly felt like it could live in a shirt pocket.\n\nThen came 1996 and with it, the StarTAC, Motorola's first true clamshell (flip) phone. It was slim, light, and stylish enough to clip on your belt like wearable tech before wearable tech was even a phrase. Beyond its good looks, it brought real utility: SMS messaging, vibration alerts, and the later models even ran on lithium-ion batteries.\n\nThe Nokia 3310arrived in late 2000 and was the phone of its time. Famously tough, it shrugged off drops, knocks, and tumbles that would leave most modern smartphones in pieces, which is why it earned its reputation as \"the brick.\"\n\nIts battery was just as iconic. With up to 260 hours of standby time\u2014more than a week\u2014you didn't even think about charging it every night. And while it wasn't packed with apps or fancy features, it had Snake II (my absolute favorite), which was all many of us needed to lose hours of our lives in pixelated glory. The swappable Xpress-On covers added a touch of personality, letting you dress it up in neon, patterns, or whatever matched your mood.\n\nThe phone was simple, reliable, and utterly everywhere, delivering simple calls, texts, and some friendly competition.\n\nWhen it arrived in mid-2003, the Nokia 6600 felt like a glimpse of the future. Running Symbian OS 7.0s with the Series 60 interface, it was one of the first devices that truly acted like a pocket computer. You could install apps, run productivity tools, and even browse the web. Granted, the browsing wasn't exactly lightning fast, but it was definitely ahead of its time.\n\nThe 6600's bright TFT color display was a world apart from the monochrome screens that came before it. And Nokia didn't stop there\u2014it packed in a VGA camera with 2\u00d7 digital zoom, video recording, Bluetooth, IrDA, MMC expandable memory, plus email and multimedia playback. For early tech enthusiasts and business professionals, it was finally a phone that went far beyond just calls and texts.\n\nThe very first model in the series, the Nokia 9000 Communicator, looked like a phone until you flipped it open\u2014then it turned into a miniature laptop, complete with a QWERTY keyboard and a monochrome display. Inside was a 24 MHz Intel i386 processor with 8 MB of memory, just enough to handle email, fax, and even dial-up web browsing. On a mobile device. In the mid-'90s.\n\nThe line kept evolving with each generation: the Nokia 9210 introduced color screens in 2000, the 9500 added serious multimedia chops in 2004 with Office tools, a browser, and expandable MMC storage, and then came the grand finale\u2014the E90 Communicator in 2007.\n\nThis chunky beast ran the Symbian S60, and featured dual displays (one of them a massive-for-its-time 4-inch panel at 800\u00d7352), a full physical keyboard, Wi-Fi, 3G, GPS, and even a 3.2-megapixel camera. For many, it felt less like carrying a phone and more like carrying a laptop that happened to make calls.\n\nIn 2004, Motorola rewrote the rulebook with the Razr V3. This phone was razor-thin (hence the name), wrapped in brushed aluminum, and lit up with an electroluminescent keypad which stood in sharp contrast to the clunky plastic phones of the era. Even the tiny outer glass screen felt clever\u2014you could sneak a glance at the time or see who was calling without flipping it open.\n\nNow, specs-wise, the Razr wasn't blowing anyone away. The VGA camera was average at best, storage was laughably small, and the software was barebones. But none of that mattered. Motorola leaned hard on design and exclusivity. The Razr debuted at over $500 on contract (ridiculous for the time!), quickly sold out, and became the best-selling flip phone ever with 130 million units sold. Celebrities loved it, it appeared in countless music videos, and it was the phone to have if you wanted to look cool without saying a word.\n\nSamsung made serious waves with its SGH lineup, marrying style with substance. The SGH-D500, which arrived in late 2004, is a perfect example. It was a slider that actually made sliding cool: slim, polished, and packed with then-cutting-edge features like a 1.3 MP camera with flash, Bluetooth, an MP3 player, and a vibrant 262K-color TFT screen. It popularized the \"active slider\" form factor and even walked away with \"Best Mobile Handset\" at the 3GSM Congress in 2005.\n\nBut Samsung wasn't only about sliders. A year earlier, in 2003, it had already shown off the SGH-E700, a clamshell so refined that it got nicknamed the \"Benz Phone.\" With its smooth lines, internal antenna (a novelty at the time), and external color screen paired with a VGA camera, it radiated sophistication, cementing Samsung's pop-culture status in mobile fashion.\n\nThe Sony Ericsson Z530i landed in 2006, and while it never tried to outshine the flashier flagships of its day, it nailed the spirit of mid-2000s flip-phone culture. It was compact, came in playful colors, and had that oh-so-satisfying snap when you closed it after a call\u2014a small ritual of attitude that touchscreens sadly erased.\n\nFeature-wise, it kept things simple but practical: MP3 ringtones, a VGA camera that was more handy than high-end, and expandable storage with Sony's Memory Stick Micro cards. What really stuck with people, though, was the balance. It was affordable, reliable, and stylish enough to feel current in an era when flipping your phone shut was part of the vibe.\n\nSony Ericsson carved out its niche with the W810, part of its Walkman-branded lineup. This 2006 model was all about music, with dedicated playback controls, excellent audio quality for the time, and expandable storage for MP3s.\n\nIt was a hit with music lovers who wanted a phone that doubled as a portable media player. The W810 also had a solid camera, making it a well-rounded choice for those who valued both entertainment and utility.\n\nThe BlackBerry Pearl, released in 2006, was BlackBerry's attempt to win over a broader audience beyond business professionals. Unlike the bulky Bold or Curve, the Pearl was sleek, compact, and more pocket-friendly. It introduced the innovative \"SureType\" keyboard \u2014 a clever compromise that paired two letters on each key but kept a QWERTY-like rhythm, so typing still felt intuitive once you got the hang of it. It also featured a trackball for navigation, a first for BlackBerry at the time, replacing the old scroll wheel and giving users seamless four-way control.\n\nMost importantly, it gave everyday users access to BlackBerry Messenger (BBM), the free, instant, and encrypted chat app that made BlackBerry the must-have device of the late 2000s. Teens and young adults lived for BBM groups and those cheeky \"pings,\" the same way people now cling to WhatsApp or iMessage.\n\nI never owned a Pearl myself (I was a Bold 9700 person), but I still feel a twinge of nostalgia whenever I think about BlackBerry. The whole BlackBerry era left such a mark that people literally nicknamed it the \"CrackBerry\"\u2014a nod to just how impossible it was to put down.\n\nDo you have a favorite throwback phone that still makes you smile? If so, please drop it in the comments. I\u2019d love to swap memories and revisit the classics with you!",

      "text": "Lately, I've caught myself looking at my current smartphone and realizing how far we've come from what was once my favorite device, back in 2009. I used to rely on a BlackBerry Bold 9700, and the contrast between that focused, utilitarian experience and today's everything-in-one devices has become hard to ignore.\nI Miss the Tactile Satisfaction of a Physical Keyboard\nNothing, and I mean nothing, compares to the feeling of typing on a BlackBerry keyboard. Those tiny, perfectly sculpted keys were a joy to use, just as much as they were functional. Each press gave immediate feedback, letting my fingers know exactly when a letter had registered. I could type with confidence, speed, and, most importantly, accuracy.\nI used to write entire emails on my phone while walking down the street, never once looking at the screen. I can't say the same for my current phone, the Galaxy S22 Plus\u2014if I tried that now, the message would probably read like it was typed during an earthquake. While you can connect a USB keyboard to an Android phone, that's obviously not practical unless you're sitting still with it.\nHaptic feedback on modern phones tries to simulate the feeling of pressing a real button, but it's like comparing a photograph of food to an actual meal. You're constantly second-guessing whether you hit the right key, squinting at tiny letters, and watching autocorrect turn \"meeting\" into \"metering,\" for example. (Though, granted, there are ways to minimize autocorrect fails.)\nMy BlackBerry Bold Was So Durable That I Didn't Even Need a Case\nOne of the aspects I miss most about my BlackBerry was how absurdly tough it was. I never worried about dropping it. It could tumble out of my hand, bounce off the pavement, and get stepped on without me worrying about spiderweb cracks.\nAlthough after a long stretch of use, the corners showed some wear, the screen stayed intact, nothing came loose, and it kept working like it was new. It had a solid build: a stainless steel frame around the edges, a faux-leather back, and just enough weight to feel reassuring in the hand.\nBy contrast, I can't help but think that phones these days are like glass sandwiches held together by anxiety, good phone screen protectors, and phone cases. We've normalized the idea that from the moment you unbox it, you need to immediately wrap your $1,000+ device in silicone or leather for the back, and tempered glass for the screen, just to survive regular life.\nAs our iPhone 16 review found, the phone is glossy and beautiful. But it's also so fragile that dropping it without a case or screen protector is practically an act of vandalism against your wallet.\nBBM Was a Messaging Platform That Felt Personal and Powerful\nBefore the explosion of messaging apps like iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram, there was BlackBerry Messenger (BBM)\u2014and it did the job beautifully. It was clean, fast, and focused. You'd send a message and instantly know when it was delivered and when it was read. Features like message deletion and timed disappearing messages were already there, long before they became trendy elsewhere.\nThere were no random suggested contacts from your phone's address book, ads, or endless GIF suggestions. Unfortunately, BlackBerry Messenger was officially discontinued in 2019.\nOne of BBM's most underrated strengths was its PIN system. It worked like a username, but without tying your identity to a phone number or email address, which meant you could maintain a high level of privacy. If you wanted to chat with someone, you had to exchange PINs and mutually accept the connection. Your number and email were irrelevant to the chat itself.\nCompare that to the present messaging landscape, which is fragmented and sometimes frustrating. You need different apps for different groups of people, notifications are scattered across platforms, and it\u2019s not unusual to receive messages (often scams) from total strangers. And half the time, you're not sure where to reply or even if your message was seen.\nThe 3 Reasons BlackBerry Failed Spectacularly\u2014and Why They Might Rise Again\nBlackberry rode the massive highs, but has long embraced the crushing lows.\nSwappable Batteries Meant I Never Worried About Battery Life\nThis might be the feature I miss most about BlackBerry devices: the ability to swap out a dead battery for a fresh one in about 10 seconds. I used to carry a couple of fully-charged spare batteries, and whenever one ran low, I'd swap it out. I didn't have to carry power banks with charging cables bulging in my pocket, or hunt for power outlets whenever my phone was low on juice.\nNow, smartphone manufacturers have convinced us that sealed batteries are somehow better. But after a few years of using a phone every day, you'll have much worse battery life than you did at the beginning. And at that point, your only option is to replace the entire phone or pay for expensive battery replacement services.\nTo be fair, not every BlackBerry had a fully swappable battery. Later models like the Key2, Z10, Z30, and Passport, for example, required more effort and careful disassembly due to stronger adhesive and tighter builds. But even then, battery replacement felt more doable than with today's glued-shut designs.\nThe Notification LED Gave Me What Many Modern Phones Don't\nThe BlackBerry notification LED was a tiny feature that made a massive difference in daily productivity. That small, multicolored light could tell you everything you needed to know about your phone's status from across the room. Red meant you had messages, green meant the network was connected, and blue meant Bluetooth was active. You could glance at your phone on your desk and immediately know if anything important required attention, without picking up your phone, unlocking the screen, or breaking your focus.\nWhat made it even better was how customizable it became, especially for power users. With third-party apps like BeBuzz (also known as BerryBuzz), you could assign different colors and blinking patterns to specific types of notifications like emails, texts, BBM messages, missed calls, and even individual contacts. Just a glance at the LED, and you'd know exactly what kind of alert had come in.\nMost modern smartphones have walked away from this kind of subtle, glanceable feedback. Instead, we get attention-hungry pop-ups, vibrations, or always-on displays that constantly pull us back into our screens. My Samsung Galaxy still offers edge lighting, and some older Samsung models support LED camera cutout notifications, but even that feels like a watered-down version of what BlackBerry had.\nThe iPhone never had anything like this, so every ping or buzz demands you stop what you're doing and check\u2014whether it's important or not.\nI'm not suggesting we throw out all the progress we've made and rewind to 2009 during the narrow window when BlackBerry was on top. Smartphones these days are undeniably impressive; packed with cameras that once felt like science fiction, apps that do everything from banking to video editing, and processing power that outpaces older desktop computers.\nBut I miss the BlackBerry line for what it represented in its time: a focused, purpose-built device that prioritized communication, reliability, and thoughtful design."
