The company received some of Everest Group's highest scores for value delivered, scope of services, and vision and strategy. The report also highlighted Manpower's robust upskilling programs and significant investments in managed services and proprietary technology, underscoring its commitment to enhancing client efficiency and experience. \"We are proud to be recognized by Everest Group as a Leader and Star Performer, an acknowledgment of our strong vision and ongoing commitment to helping clients solve their most pressing workforce challenges,\" Rajesh Namboothiry, Senior Vice President, Manpower North America, said. \"Our Manufacturing Center of Excellence is just one example of how we're elevating skilled trades, and through this Managed Services Program [MSP], we're helping clients optimize operations, performance and compliance. At the same time, our strategic investments in technology are powering more agile, insight-driven solutions that meet evolving needs and deliver long-term value.\" Everest Group's PEAK Matrix\u00ae Assessment is an annual evaluation of contingent staffing providers' market success and delivery capability. The 2025 U.S. edition reviewed roughly 25 companies across multiple dimensions: vision and strategy, scope of services, innovation and investment, and delivery footprint. Based on this evaluation, companies are classified as Leaders, Major Contenders, or Aspirants. The Star Performer distinction is awarded to organizations that demonstrate the most significant year-over-year improvements, with top-quartile performance in both market success and capability advancement. \"Manpower's dedicated focus on skilled trades through Manpower Skilled Technical, as well as its strong footprint in manufacturing and logistics, reflects its industrial domain expertise,\" said Priyanka Mitra, Vice President, Everest Group. \"Its investments in proprietary platforms such as Sophie and PowerSuite, along with data-driven tools such as the Total Cost of Workforce (TCoW) and Client Stability Index (CSI), showcase its innovation and strong vision for enhancing operational efficiency.
