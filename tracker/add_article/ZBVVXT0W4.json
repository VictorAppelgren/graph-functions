      "summary": "Asian equities were mixed this week, with Mainland China’s STAR Board and Shenzhen markets outperforming while Taiwan and Korea lagged. The Shanghai and Shenzhen market cap surpassed RMB 100 trillion for the first time, and a strong semiconductor rally was driven by concerns over Nvidia’s H20 chips and the launch of DeepSeek’s V3.1 AI model. Q2 earnings from Baidu, Bilibili, Kuaishou, Xiaomi and Xpeng largely beat estimates, sparking varied market reactions, and several Chinese tech names surged after strong results or strategic moves such as XPeng’s share buy‑back. Meanwhile, China’s central bank continued liquidity injections, and upcoming MSCI index rebalancing and Q2 earnings reports are expected to influence investor sentiment further.",
