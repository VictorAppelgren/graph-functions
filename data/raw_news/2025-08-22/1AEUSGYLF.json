  "title": "Dillard's' (NYSE:DDS) Soft Earnings Are Actually Better Than They Appear",
  "description": "Dillard's, Inc.'s ( NYSE:DDS ) recent soft profit numbers didn't appear to worry shareholders, as the stock price...",
  "content": "Dillard's, Inc.'s (NYSE:DDS) recent soft profit numbers didn't appear to worry shareholders, as the stock price showed strength. Our analysis suggests that investors may have noticed some promising signs beyond the statutory profit figures.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nAs finance nerds would already know, the accrual ratio from cashflow is a key measure for assessing how well a company's free cash flow (FCF) matches its profit. In plain english, this ratio subtracts FCF from net profit, and divides that number by the company's average operating assets over that period. You could think of the accrual ratio from cashflow as the 'non-FCF profit ratio'.\n\nAs a result, a negative accrual ratio is a positive for the company, and a positive accrual ratio is a negative. That is not intended to imply we should worry about a positive accrual ratio, but it's worth noting where the accrual ratio is rather high. Notably, there is some academic evidence that suggests that a high accrual ratio is a bad sign for near-term profits, generally speaking.\n\nDillard's has an accrual ratio of -0.15 for the year to August 2025. That implies it has very good cash conversion, and that its earnings in the last year actually significantly understate its free cash flow. To wit, it produced free cash flow of US$771m during the period, dwarfing its reported profit of US$575.7m. Dillard's' free cash flow improved over the last year, which is generally good to see.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nOur Take On Dillard's' Profit Performance\n\nDillard's' accrual ratio is solid, and indicates strong free cash flow, as we discussed, above. Because of this, we think Dillard's' earnings potential is at least as good as it seems, and maybe even better! Unfortunately, though, its earnings per share actually fell back over the last year. The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider. So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Dillard's at this point in time. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Dillard's, and understanding it should be part of your investment process.",

  "summary": "Dillard's, Inc. has reported soft profit numbers, but its stock price hasn't been negatively assessed. The accrual ratio from cashflow is a key measure for assessing a company's ability to match its profit to the company's FCF. However, this accruall ratio significantly understates its free cash flow, which was significantly higher than its reported profit of US$575.7m. Despite this, Dillard's' earnings per share have actually fallen over the last year. The company's accreeal ratio indicates strong free cashflow, but there are risks facing the company at this time.",
