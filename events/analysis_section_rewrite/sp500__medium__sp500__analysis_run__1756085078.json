      "feedback": "Strengths are the solid use of Netflix metrics (Q2 rev +15.9%, FCF +86.9%, >300m subs, 8.8% US Nielsen viewing, P/E ~51.7) and a nod to cross-asset dynamics; to reach world-class, replace the single-sentence summary with a formal 3–6 month scenario map and tighten causal logic around triggers, timing, and invalidations. Actionable edits: 1) Build a crisp scenario tree (base case, alt1, alt2) anchored to Netflix’s near-term catalysts (ad-tier uptake, password-sharing enforcement, international growth) with explicit timing windows (e.g., by Q3–Q4 2025 earnings; ad-tier ramp by 4Q25) and measurable milestones; 2) Quantify the base-case thesis using the sources: base-case growth decelerates from prior outsized gains but remains positive (cite 61SVFUKBY/A88B7V8PY), with near-term upside from ad-tier and live-events; specify target ranges (e.g., revenue growth 8–12%, FCF margin expansion to a specified range, ARPU uplift) and the implied path for the P/E multiple; 3) Define invalidation signals that would derail Netflix’s thesis within the horizon (e.g., two consecutive quarters of sub-growth deceleration, ad-tier revenue share or ARPU not moving toward targets, P/E compressing meaningfully toward the mid-30s); 4) Explicitly map macro/flows: weave in the AI-demand backdrop (945 TWh by 2030) as a backdrop for tech/entertainment capex and a cross-asset check against AI-leader dynamics (cite STBVARD8F); 5) Integrate 1–2 alternative ideas (KO as a defensive ballast with mid-20s P/E and ~2.9% yield; Alphabet’s diversified AI/ads pivot) with quantified angles and connect to the dividend-stock sleeve in YX2J8NHZ1; cite KO/Alphabet metrics where relevant (KO trailing/forward P/E ~25, yield ~2.9% per STBVARD8F; Alphabet dividend context per YX2J8NHZ1); 6) Add a Disney‑style cost/benefit risk signal (early-perk removal as a form of operating-flexibility learning) to illustrate potential margin impact in consumer experiences (U3ZK13ZQI); 7) Conclude with a clean base case, 1–2 alts, explicit risks, a watch-list of signals, and a clearly stated confidence band, each tied to the cited IDs after each point (61SVFUKBY, A88B7V8PY, STBVARD8F, U3ZK13ZQI, YX2J8NHZ1); 8) Recast the prose into a structured, concise format (not a single paragraph) while preserving numeric specificity and ensuring every factual claim is anchored to the source IDs. This will produce a regime of testable triggers, timing, path-dependency, and clearly delineated base/alt/risk signals suitable for a 3–6 month horizon.",
