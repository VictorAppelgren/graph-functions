  "title": "Can Tencent Shares Recover Back to All-Time Highs?",
  "description": "As global tech megacaps climb to new records, investors see a chance for Tencent shares to catch up. While it has added more than $150 billion in market value this year, shares remain 26% below its all-time high and still trade at a discount to historical norms. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "Our team have put out actually this almost full preview of what it might take for the share price to actually get back to the all time highs, which as things stand, about 20, 25% away. That's the blue line you see on your screens. The earnings estimates in yellow, as you can see, have been bumped up year after year to a record high. So the earnings story remains robust. And we put the two things together for you that is effectively PE. Right. And PE on a chart takes you back to 2010, including your sort of sigma levels. And as things started trading at about 17 times, earnings are actually still. Can we change the chart please. This one here click. Thank you so much. There we go. There we are. 17.6 is still one sigma below the norm as far as ten set go. So how does this compare then to 1010 its global peers? Thank you so much. There we go. Sony, Nintendo, game makers, metal Platforms, a bigger platform company and also Apple Tencent is in why you should that 17 multiple in the earlier chart that's basically in white below and as you can see there it does show that it is trading at a discount to at least compared to its peers if one.",
