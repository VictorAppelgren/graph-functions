  "content": "adesso SE (ETR:ADN1) recently posted some strong earnings, and the market responded positively. We did some digging and found some further encouraging factors that investors will like.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nMany investors haven't heard of the accrual ratio from cashflow, but it is actually a useful measure of how well a company's profit is backed up by free cash flow (FCF) during a given period. In plain english, this ratio subtracts FCF from net profit, and divides that number by the company's average operating assets over that period. This ratio tells us how much of a company's profit is not backed by free cashflow.\n\nAs a result, a negative accrual ratio is a positive for the company, and a positive accrual ratio is a negative. While it's not a problem to have a positive accrual ratio, indicating a certain level of non-cash profits, a high accrual ratio is arguably a bad thing, because it indicates paper profits are not matched by cash flow. That's because some academic studies have suggested that high accruals ratios tend to lead to lower profit or less profit growth.\n\nOver the twelve months to June 2025, adesso recorded an accrual ratio of -0.13. That indicates that its free cash flow was a fair bit more than its statutory profit. In fact, it had free cash flow of \u20ac54m in the last year, which was a lot more than its statutory profit of \u20ac12.3m. adesso did see its free cash flow drop year on year, which is less than ideal, like a Simpson's episode without Groundskeeper Willie.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nOur Take On adesso's Profit Performance\n\nAs we discussed above, adesso has perfectly satisfactory free cash flow relative to profit. Because of this, we think adesso's earnings potential is at least as good as it seems, and maybe even better! And one can definitely find a positive in the fact that it made a profit this year, despite losing money last year. The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider. So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for adesso you should be aware of.",
