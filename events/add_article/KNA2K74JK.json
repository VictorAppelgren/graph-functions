      "summary": "The article argues that the global climate transition has already passed its tipping point, with 90% of new electricity coming from renewables, yet European climate‑tech funding has fallen to a five‑year low. It highlights community‑led energy initiatives, EV vehicle‑to‑grid technology, and innovative storage solutions like Finland’s sand battery as key drivers for accelerating the transition. Despite public support for climate action, the piece stresses the need for increased investment, grid flexibility, and policy alignment to sustain momentum and avoid outages such as Spain’s 2025 blackout.",
