  "title": "Councillor Audrey Dempsey who made 'white racism' claim joins Reform",
  "description": "Audrey Dempsey was suspended from Scottish Labour over alleged racist remarks in April 2024 and later quit.",
  "content": "A Glasgow councillor who quit Labour after making an unsubstantiated claim about a rise in \"racist attacks on white children and teachers\" has joined Reform. Audrey Dempsey was suspended from Labour in April 2024 and later quit to sit as an independent after she was accused of making racist remarks. She is now the second Reform councillor in Glasgow, joining the council's former Scottish Conservative group leader Thomas Kerr, who quit his party in January. Dempsey said she hoped to make \"real change\" with Reform as she believed the party was not afraid of having \"difficult conversations\".\n\nScottish Labour launched an investigation into Demsey's remarks last year, but a party spokeswoman said it never concluded because she left the party. Dempsey did not provide statistical evidence for her claim about a rise in attacks, which was contained in an agenda for a recent meeting of the Labour group. She previously told BBC Scotland News that she had asked \"an honest question\". It was not asked at the meeting. Glasgow City Council said it was \"not aware of any rise in incidents of this kind across the city\". When she quit, Dempsey accused the party of a \"character assassination\" and said she felt \"deeply hurt and disappointed\". She has represented Shettleston and Robroyston as an independent councillor since then.\n\nDempsey said there was \"no place\" for an independent in Glasgow and people had to be in a party to make \"real change\". She said: \"We need drastic change and we need it sooner rather than later. We can shape Glasgow Reform to suit the needs of Glasgow. \"Nothing has been changing at all. I feel other political parties are afraid of difficult conversations. They try to brush it aside. \"Reform don't shy away from these conversations.\" Dempsey said she no longer believed that Labour represented the rights of working class people, claiming she \"saw very little evidence of that\" as a party member. BBC News has contacted Scottish Labour for further comment. The councillor added: \"I have done research on the party and Nigel Farage. Everything he says he will do \u2013 he does. \"There is no other leader can say that. He has been true to his word.\"",

      "text": "Conservative MSP Graham Simpson defects to Reform\n- Published\nConservative MSP Graham Simpson has defected to Reform.\nSimpson announced his move as he appeared at a press conference in Scotland with Reform leader Nigel Farage.\nThe new Reform MSP told journalists that many would not be surprised to see him defect, and that leaving the Conservatives was \"an enormous wrench\".\nHe is the second MSP to leave the party's Holyrood group in the past week.\nA Scottish Conservative spokesperson said the party remained focused on \"holding the SNP and Labour to account\".\n\"The Scottish Conservatives are determined to provide positive common-sense solutions to drive our economy forward, so we can reduce NHS waiting lists and invest more in education,\" the party said.\n\"Nigel Farage has said he's content with another five years of SNP government. We're going to keep focusing on how to get the nationalists out of power.\"\nThe defection means Simpson becomes Reform's sole current MSP.\nMichelle Ballantyne sat as a Reform member at the Scottish Parliament from January to May 2021, having left the Conservatives the previous year and sitting for a short spell as an independent.\nShe lost her seat at the May 2021 election.\nSimpson has been an MSP for the Central Scotland region since 2016. He is a former journalist with The Sun and Daily Record.\nHe said he would remain in parliament following his defection and would not give up his seat on the Central Scotland regional list.\nSpeaking at a press conference in Broxburn, West Lothian, he said: \"It's fair to say that some of you won't be surprised to see me here, given that the Scottish Tories have been touting my name as a potential defector for months now.\n\"So today, I'm giving them what they want, but perhaps not for the reasons that they think.\n\"Leaving the party that I first joined when I was 15 is an enormous wrench, and I've been through a lot of soul searching in the past few weeks.\"\n- Published23 hours ago\n- Published1 day ago\nSimpson said he decided to join Reform UK to \"create something new, exciting and lasting\".\nSpeaking with leader Nigel Farage by his side, he added: \"I've joined Reform because we have the chance to create something new, exciting and lasting that puts the needs of people over the system, that asks what is going wrong and how we can fix it.\"\nHe said he thought Reform could \"help\" to remove the SNP from office after 19 years in power.\nFarage said Reform will have a Scottish leader in place ahead of the Holyrood election next year.\nThis contradicted previous statements from his deputy, Richard Tice, that a leader would be chosen after the election to prevent internal rifts.\nSpeaking to journalists after the announcement, Farage denied Reform is becoming a new Conservative party and said he would fight to beat the SNP next year.\nHe suggested he could make a deal with Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar to keep the SNP out of power.\n\"Mr Sarwar and I don't necessarily get on that well, but it's remarkable after an election what mathematics can do,\" he said.\n\"But anyway, why would Labour beat us next May? We are going to beat them.\"\nFarage had previously said he would not strike a deal with Labour.\nReform's deportation plans\nFarage's visit came against a backdrop of increased tension and rhetoric around the immigration.\nOn Tuesday, the Reform leader launched a scheme called Operation Restoring Justice, aimed at tackling the migrant issue.\nHe said Reform would deport 600,000 migrants over five years if it won power at the next election.\nFarage said his party would bar anyone who comes to the UK on small boats from claiming asylum, under plans announced earlier.\nIt says it would make \u00a32bn available to offer payments or aid to countries like Afghanistan to take back migrants, with sanctions potentially imposed on uncooperative countries.\nHis comments came after a poll, by the David Hume Institute and Diffley Partnership, suggested 21% of Scots think immigration is one of the top three issues in the country, up from 16% in May and just 4% in May 2023.\nIt means immigration is now seen as the third biggest priority for the country, with only health and the cost-of-living crisis regarded as more important by voters.\n'Tories by another name'\nHousing Secretary Mairi McAllan, described Farage as \"the ultimate symbol of Westminster failure\".\nThe SNP MSP accused him of promoting \"ugly, anti-immigrant rhetoric\" and \"whipping up hatred against vulnerable people\".\n\"Labour has failed, and Nigel Farage has nothing to offer,\" she said.\n\"Scotland needs a fresh start \u2013 and the only one that will work for Scotland is independence.\"\nScottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie said: \"Yet another lifelong Tory has decided to flee their sinking ship in a bid to save their own career, but it will take more than a new rosette to make Scots forget the damage Tories like Graham Simpson have inflicted on our country over the years.\"\nShe said Reform are \"simply Tories by another name\" and said neither party had answers to the \"challenges Scotland faces\".\nBaillie added: \"The next Scottish Parliament election will be a direct choice between a third decade of SNP failure or a new direction with Scottish Labour.\"\nIt felt like it was only a matter of time until a Conservative MSP jumped ship to Reform.\nWith a Holyrood election next year, the Tory position looks bleak. Reform UK seems to be on the up.\nGraham Simpson's name was one that was doing the rounds as a likely defector.\nThe Conservatives seem to be leaking MSPs fast. Will he be the last to depart?\nSimpson seems to see this as an opportunity to help shape something new.\nIt may also be a route to make his re-election to Holyrood next year more likely.\nGraham Simpson is a big campaigner for recall - the right to essentially fire your MSP under certain circumstances.\nIronically, there will be plenty who think that switching parties should be grounds for that.\nBut Simpson insists it's right that he stays put on the Holyrood benches.\nScotcast: \u2018I\u2019m with Farage\u2019 - the Graham Simpson interview\nReform UK's new MSP on quitting the Scottish Conservatives.\n- Published3 days ago\n- Published2 days ago\n- Published18 August"

I have not spoken to Reform about standing for Holyrood.\n\"They haven't offered me anything like that whatsoever. This is about me putting my constituents first, not myself first.\"\nAs recently as June, Kerr was critical of Reform. He warned voters ahead of the general election, external to be \"careful what you vote for\".\nHe told BBC Radio Scotland that the party had become more professional since the election as part of \"remarkable turnaround\".\n\"The party that I was warning people about is no longer the party that exists,\" the councillor said.\n'Disillusioned and disconnected'\nFindlay described the defection as \"very disappointing\".\nAsked if there could be more defections, he told reporters at Holyrood: \"I can't control what people may or may not decide to do.\"\nFindlay said he understood voters were \"disillusioned and disconnected\" but insisted he was focused on showing \"the people of Scotland that we're on their side\".\nKerr was one of two Tory councillors on Glasgow City Council, and will be Reform's first in the city.\nHe is the fifth former Scottish Conservative councillor to join Reform - with two others in Aberdeenshire and two in North Ayrshire.\nReform leader Nigel Farage said he was \"delighted\" to welcome Kerr.\nHe added that his party was looking forward to the election with \"increasing anticipation\".\nFarage's party is aiming to win its first Holyrood seats at the 2026 election.\nA Scottish Conservative source speculated that Kerr had made the move in the hope of being elected to the Scottish Parliament.\nA recent Survation poll for the Holyrood Sources podcast found Reform was on course to finish in joint third place with the Conservatives on 15 seats.\nA Reform UK spokesperson said: \u201cNo discussions have ever taken place regarding the Holyrood 2026 election or list rankings.\u201d\nGreen councillor Anthony Carroll described Kerr's defection as a \"slap in the face\" for voters and said he should call a by-election.\nScottish Labour deputy leader Dame Jackie Baillie said Findlay had \"lost control of his party\".\nShe added: \"After 14 years of incompetence and sleaze in government it's no wonder the Tories are fleeing their sinking ship - but Reform doesn't have anything to offer the people of Scotland.\"\n- Published23 July 2024\n- Published7 May 2017"

      "text": "The journalists are funded by the BBC as part of its latest Charter commitment, but are employed by regional news organisations.\nA total of 165 reporters are allocated to news organisations in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThese organisations range from television and radio stations to online media companies and established regional newspaper groups.\nLocal Democracy Reporters cover top-tier local authorities, second-tier local authorities and other public service organisations.\nPrinciples of operation: Questions and answers\nStories written by the democracy reporters are shared with more than 1,100 media titles and outlets that have signed up to be part of the Local News Partnerships scheme.\nTo be awarded the democracy reporter contracts, the successful news organisations had to pass stringent criteria which included financial standing and a strong track record of relevant journalism in the area they were applying to cover.\nThe award decisions were made by senior editorial BBC figures.\nThe full list of organisations that were awarded contracts can be viewed here.\nLocal Democracy Reporter content can be downloaded via an online portal, accessed via a log-in code supplied to all qualifying news organisations.\nThe Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) is a public service news agency: funded by the BBC, provided by the local news sector, and used by qualifying partners. It\u2019s like a franchise: different companies with different approaches, but using common editorial standards and all publishing into the same system.\n- The core purpose of the LDRS is to provide impartial coverage of the regular business and workings of local authorities in the UK, and other relevant democratic institutions such as mayoralties, combined authority areas, P&CCs, quangos, etc.\n- The Local Democracy Reporters' (LDRs) brief is to report on the decision-making process: what decisions are made in the public's name and how they are arrived at, what evidence is presented to the council, etc.\n- The expectation is that LDRs shall endeavour to attend all meetings in person.\n- In two-tier council areas the LDRs should cover district council affairs sufficiently to ensure that significant decisions (eg planning) are reported.\n- LDRs may provide other stories which are focused on local democracy and which are in the public interest so long as that does not detract from the core purpose of the service.\n- All their work must be available to all qualifying partners.\n- National politics is out of scope, but election campaigns and constituency work of MPs, AMs, MSPs and MLAs that specifically relates to relevant local audiences may be covered so long as it does not detract from the core purpose of the LDRS.\nLDRs report to the contract holder, not to the BBC or any other partner.\nWith the guidance and support of the contract holder, LDRs work to the brief covering the stories of greatest public interest and they should not undertake commissions for any partner.\nDirect questions and clarifications relating to content are acceptable, but any suggestions or comments relating to the service should go through a LDR's manager.\nThe only difference between the BBC and others is that it has a right to request interviews or 2-ways for BBC Local Radio. Depending on workload and commitments it is up to each LDR to decide whether or not to agree.\nNo. While meeting the highest standards of accuracy and impartiality, written content may conform to an employer's normal style. BBC training will help create a common standard for media content production.\n- All content must be created for all qualifying partners.\n- Content should be published as soon as possible after a meeting or event.\n- All content must be published using the LDRS Authoring Tool so all partners see it simultaneously.\n- All content must be titled COUNCIL NAME: Story Name.\n- It must be tagged with at least one top-tier local authority, but can have as many tags as are relevant.\n- Images and media must have a descriptive label.\n- Images and media must be rights-free (LDRs should not use their employer\u2019s picture library, or images supplied by agencies or freelance contributors).\n- LDRs should, where possible, assign a \"Feature Image\" to a story.\n- LDRs must provide an Advisory note in the publishing system before the end of every week indicating their diary for the next seven days (or longer).\n- LDRs should source their content. An explanatory Note to Editors at the end of a story regarding the source will reduce queries from partners, especially around whether qualified privilege applies to all or part of a story.\n- LDRs should not file a story based on a press release already in the public domain unless it has been significantly developed with new quotes or information.\n- Embargoed content must explain why publication should be delayed.\n- Posts should be via LDRs' personal accounts rather than contractors' branded accounts.\n- LDRs are encouraged to post an Advisory in the LDRS Authoring Tool to let partners know if they intend live-Tweeting from a meeting, for example.\n- Tagging #LDReporter will help the partnership collate relevant tweets.\n- LDRs should be credited as \"First Name, Last Name, Local Democracy Reporter\".\n- By-lines or references within copy are acceptable.\n- Broadcasters should acknowledge LDRs when they appear on air or when the format allows.\n- Shared credit with other reporters is acceptable if LDRs' content is copied, edited or incorporated into new pieces of work.\n- The LDRS logo can also be used in print, online or on TV, but is not compulsory.\n- LDRs should refer to themselves as \"Local Democracy Reporters\", not \"BBC Local Democracy Reporters\" in all forms of communication, including social media profiles.\n- Corrections and clarifications relating to previously published stories must be clearly highlighted and issued immediately.\n- The headline style should be as follows: 'COUNCIL NAME: Story Name - CORRECTION'.\n- The first paragraph of the body copy should be as follows: 'CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that\u2026'."

  "argos_summary": "Audrey Dempsey, a Glasgow councillor suspended from Labour over unsubstantiated claims of rising racist attacks on white children and teachers, left the party and joined Reform, citing a desire for \"real change\" and a willingness to tackle difficult conversations. Her move follows a broader trend of defections to Reform, including former Conservative councillor Thomas Kerr and MSP Graham Simpson, as the party positions itself as a new right\u2011wing alternative in Scotland. Labour has said it never concluded its investigation because Dempsey left, while council officials deny any rise in such incidents. Dempsey\u2019s departure highlights growing frustration among some former Labour members who feel the party no longer represents working\u2011class interests.",
