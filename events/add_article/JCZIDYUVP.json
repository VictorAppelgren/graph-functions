      "summary": "The article reports on the growing trend of consumers turning to AI tools and alternative wellness products, particularly pineal gland supplements, driven by dissatisfaction with traditional healthcare. It highlights Enki Elixir, a new liquid supplement marketed as a gold‑based ormus formula that claims to activate the pineal gland, boost energy, and enhance consciousness, positioning itself as the 2025 best in its category. The press release blends marketing with a narrative of ancient alien influence, Sumerian tablets, and conspiracy theories about government secrecy, while offering a sales pitch with bonuses and a money‑back guarantee. The piece underscores the broader cultural shift toward ingredient transparency, self‑guided health routines, and the allure of mystical wellness claims.",
