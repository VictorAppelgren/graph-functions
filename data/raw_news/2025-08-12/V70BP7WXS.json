  "content": "So a friend into stained glass gave me a \"starter kit\" (in order to convert me into her hobby methinks): a soldering iron with tips & stand, tip cleaner, and an assortment of glass. Really neat pieces, some that are worthy of making jewelry with even.\n\n \n\n She ran me through the process in her studio, and at the time it seemed easy to solder pieces together with a relatively even bead this first time I tried. Was fun, and enthused, I bought a bit more - some copper tape, flux, random little tools, lead free solder (for possible jewelry), and patina for the solder. \n\n \n\n But I absolutely cannot replicate even soldering two pieces of glass together at home as I did in her studio; everything falls apart. Solder, if I am able to apply is just gloppy, can't get an even bead. I suspect perhaps the soldering iron she gave me is a cheapie, maybe that's it. I'm also not certain what temperature to set. Maybe lead free solder is more difficult to work with? But really, it is my absolute ignorance is most likely the issue.\n\n \n\n I've searched YouTube and watched a few videos. I haven't seen any yet that has helped, there still seems some assumption of knowledge and skill even in the \"for beginners\" tutorials.\n\n \n\n So, thought I'd throw this out to Ars. I am certain a lot of Ars \"makers\" solder regularly, what with electronics nerds and/or professionals & hobby enthusiasts probably the dominant species in this particular ecosphere.\n\n \n\n If anyone feels like throwing me some pointers - or point to some resources for beginners, it would be appreciated. Doesn't have to be stained glass centric, as I'm more interested in smaller projects not like windows or something, so even if tips/resources focused on electronics or whatever, I'll still learn.\n\n \n\n Thanks if anyone can help!",
