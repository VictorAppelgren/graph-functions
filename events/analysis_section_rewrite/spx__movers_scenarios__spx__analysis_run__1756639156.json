      "feedback": "The draft is off‑track: all four items focus on ETH, yet the SECTION FOCUS demands S&P 500, DXY, and related macro drivers. Delete the crypto entries and replace them with two Up and two Down items that map to canonical handles (spx, dxy, ust10y, us_core_pce). For the Up scenario, use the Fed’s September 20 cut (fed_policy) to lift tech earnings and reduce discount rates, projecting spx +1 % to +4 % over 3–6 mo (FAN5RYW6T) with a 30 % probability; for DXY, note the expected 200 bp drop to 95.8 by Aug 31 followed by a 0.5–1 % rise as the Fed cuts steepen the curve (Z7O1DCHS7)(B1KYJ1GPU) with 70 % probability. For the Down scenario, cite the risk of a Fed pause or hike (fed_policy) that would dampen valuations, projecting spx –6 % to –9 % (FAN5RYW6T) at 60 % probability; also include a DXY decline if inflation eases sharply, reducing the yield advantage (us_core_pce, ust10y) with 35 % probability. Ensure each line is a single sentence, includes the catalyst window (e.g., September 20 FOMC, October 15 CPI), and cites the relevant IDs.",
