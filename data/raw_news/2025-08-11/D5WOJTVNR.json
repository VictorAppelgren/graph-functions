  "description": "The new developer beta release, iOS 26 beta 6, adds new ringtones, faster app launches, and fixes the Camera swipe direction issues.",
  "content": "Apple on Tuesday released its sixth developer beta of its mobile operating system, iOS 26, along with updates for iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, Mac, and others. As the new software gets closer to its September public launch date, the changes and tweaks aren\u2019t as significant, but there are still some surprises to be found. In beta 6, that includes a new selection of ringtones, a final decision on the Camera swiping direction controversy, a new onboarding experience, and other updates.\n\nThe addition of half a dozen new ringtones, all a variant of the \u201creflection\u201d tune, was an unexpected addition that\u2019s already getting attention on social media. Early adopters are particularly enthused about the \u201cDreamer\u201d ringtone, which has been described as going \u201chard,\u201d \u201ccrazy good,\u201d and \u201csuch a bop,\u201d among other things. It might even encourage some to take their phones out of silent mode for a change.\n\nAlso new in iOS 26 beta 6 is a new update on the controversial change to the Camera app.\n\nThere was quite a bit of backlash over the way Apple changed how the Camera mode switcher responds to touch. Users complained that the change, introduced in prior betas, broke their muscle memory, since the swipe gesture on this interface would reverse the scroll direction they were used to \u2014 which was the same design paradigm that all other native Apple apps use. In beta 5, Apple responded to these complaints by introducing a new Settings toggle that would allow you to switch back to \u201cClassic Mode,\u201d which would once again make the Camera app work like all others.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t have been surprising for Apple to go this route. When it wants to make a major user interface change, it often adds a fallback for those who don\u2019t like the update. That\u2019s why you can still toggle off \u201cNatural scrolling\u201d on the MacBook\u2019s Trackpad, and you can move Safari\u2019s address bar back to the top of the screen on iPhone. But in this case, Apple seems to have decided the Camera direction isn\u2019t a fight worth having. In beta 6, it removed the Settings toggle and changed the scroll direction back to the way it was before.\n\nOther notable updates in the new beta include faster transitions and the introduction of new open and close animations for launching apps\n\nLiquid Glass, the updated user interface for Apple devices, is also still being subtly tweaked for readability in some areas and more \u201cglassiness\u201d in others. This time, the changes have added more color dispersion as you move between an app\u2019s tabs using the clear, magnifying glass-like selector. The Lock Screen and toggles also now offer Liquid Glass effects.\n\nAfter you update the OS, you\u2019ll see a new startup/onboarding experience, as well, which is used to introduce Liquid Glass and other iOS 26 features, like the dark and clear icons and redesigned interfaces in various apps.\n\nAs with other beta releases, you can expect some bug fixes, but you may come across new ones as Apple moves forward with the software development process. However, users report that overall, this beta feels more stable and much faster than prior releases, suggesting that Apple is nearing its public launch.\n\nNow that the developer beta has been released, those testing the public beta should expect an update soon.",
