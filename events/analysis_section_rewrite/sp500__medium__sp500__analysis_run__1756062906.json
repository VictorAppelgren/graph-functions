      "feedback": "Strong start, but the piece needs a formal 3–6 month scenario map with disciplined triggers, timing, and invalidation rules, plus precise, source-grounded quantified anchors. Actionable edits: (1) reframe as a named 3–6m scenario set (Base, Upside, Downside) with explicit timing windows (e.g., Costa sale chatter and bid timing 0–3 months; GM U.S. manufacturing cadence and unit-volume milestones through 2026–27; Disney’s Jan 2026 policy change; Nvidia/AI compute/data-center demand trajectory into Q4’25–Q1’26) and explicit invalidation conditions (e.g., tariff escalation beyond 25% on autos or a tariff rollback; Costa sale falling below £2B); (2) quantify catalysts using the sources’ numbers: Costa sale ≈ £2B (STBVARD8F); Costa 2023 sales £1.22B; Global Ventures revenue $3.13B and 6.7% of KO sales; Coca‑Cola acquisitions last year $315M and $179M in H1’25; GM capex guidance $10–12B through 2027 and the Orion/Spring Hill production plans; Elevated Velocity off-road/VE modes and 24\" wheels; data-center energy demand ~945 TWh by 2030; Nvidia’s central AI compute role with the AI 30 list expansion (CrowdStrike, Roblox, GE Vernova, Nebius) and removals (Adobe, C3.ai); Disney’s Lightning Lane vs. early entry; (3) delineate clear transmission channels and tie them to numbers: AI capex drives data-center load and supplier demand; energy costs for AI scale; auto pricing margins under tariff scenarios; consumer-demand dynamics for CO rating and park pricing; (4) add explicit sensitivity/load scenarios where possible instead of qualitative assertions: e.g., small adoptions of AI-tools in auto retail under tariff uncertainty could alter margins by mid-single digits; (5) tighten risk scaffolding with surveillance signals and watch-list: Nvidia data-center utilization metrics; GM production milestones; Costa sale progress and bidder activity; Disney attendance/merch pricing and park-revenue per guest; IUSV-factor-rotation signals as a hedge against AI-equine concentration (4661GWFP7); (6) ensure path-dependency is explicit: if AI capex accelerates or stalls, the base case tilts toward different sector winners; (7) align every claim to a cited ID in SOURCE MATERIAL and place the ID after each relevant clause; (8) trim over-generalities, keep the end-state framing (base case, 1–2 alts, risks, watch-list, confidence) tight and with a crisp closing tie to the horizon. If you incorporate these changes, the piece will deliver a world-class, first-principles–driven scenario map that coherently links AI capex, policy, manufacturing cycles, and consumer/leisure dynamics, anchored by the cited sources (STBVARD8F; WTNT85IPR; U3ZK13ZQI; YX2J8NHZ1; 4661GWFP7).",
