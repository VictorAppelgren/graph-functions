  "content": "Kraken Robotics Inc. (CVE:PNG) posted some decent earnings, but shareholders didn't react strongly. We think that they might be concerned about some underlying details that our analysis found. Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit. As finance nerds would already know, the accrual ratio from cashflow is a key measure for assessing how well a company's free cash flow (FCF) matches its profit. In plain english, this ratio subtracts FCF from net profit, and divides that number by the company's average operating assets over that period. You could think of the accrual ratio from cashflow as the 'non-FCF profit ratio'. As a result, a negative accrual ratio is a positive for the company, and a positive accrual ratio is a negative. While it's not a problem to have a positive accrual ratio, indicating a certain level of non-cash profits, a high accrual ratio is arguably a bad thing, because it indicates paper profits are not matched by cash flow. To quote a 2014 paper by Lewellen and Resutek, \"firms with higher accruals tend to be less profitable in the future\". For the year to June 2025, Kraken Robotics had an accrual ratio of 0.38. As a general rule, that bodes poorly for future profitability. To wit, the company did not generate one whit of free cashflow in that time. Even though it reported a profit of CA$14.8m, a look at free cash flow indicates it actually burnt through CA$16m in the last year. We also note that Kraken Robotics' free cash flow was actually negative last year as well, so we could understand if shareholders were bothered by its outflow of CA$16m. Unfortunately for shareholders, the company has also been issuing new shares, diluting their share of future earnings. That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates. To understand the value of a company's earnings growth, it is imperative to consider any dilution of shareholders' interests. In fact, Kraken Robotics increased the number of shares on issue by 33% over the last twelve months by issuing new shares. That means its earnings are split among a greater number of shares. To talk about net income, without noticing earnings per share, is to be distracted by the big numbers while ignoring the smaller numbers that talk to per share value. You can see a chart of Kraken Robotics' EPS by clicking here.\n\nA Look At The Impact Of Kraken Robotics' Dilution On Its Earnings Per Share (EPS) Three years ago, Kraken Robotics lost money. The good news is that profit was up 53% in the last twelve months. On the other hand, earnings per share are only up 27% over the same period. So you can see that the dilution has had a fairly significant impact on shareholders. In the long term, earnings per share growth should beget share price growth. So it will certainly be a positive for shareholders if Kraken Robotics can grow EPS persistently. However, if its profit increases while its earnings per share stay flat (or even fall) then shareholders might not see much benefit. For the ordinary retail shareholder, EPS is a great measure to check your hypothetical \"share\" of the company's profit. Our Take On Kraken Robotics' Profit Performance In conclusion, Kraken Robotics has weak cashflow relative to earnings, which indicates lower quality earnings, and the dilution means its earnings per share growth is weaker than its profit growth. For the reasons mentioned above, we think that a perfunctory glance at Kraken Robotics' statutory profits might make it look better than it really is on an underlying level. If you want to do dive deeper into Kraken Robotics, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing. For instance, we've identified 3 warning signs for Kraken Robotics (2 are concerning) you should be familiar with. Our examination of Kraken Robotics has focussed on certain factors that can make its earnings look better than they are. And, on that basis, we are somewhat skeptical. But there is always more to discover if you are capable of focussing your mind on minutiae. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business. While it might take a little research on your behalf, you may find this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity, or this list of stocks with significant insider holdings to be useful.

  "summary": "Kraken Robotics Inc. (CVE:PNG) has posted some decent earnings but its shares were not widely received by shareholders. This article suggests that the company's accrual ratio from cashflow, a key measure for assessing a company's ability to match its profit to its free cash flow (FCF) and net profit. This ratio subtracts FCF from net profit and adds that number by the company\u2019s average operating assets over the period. However, a negative accruAL ratio indicates that companies with higher accruals tend to be less profitable in the future. For the year to June 2025, Kraken Robotics had an accruable ratio of 0.38, indicating a lack of free cashflow compared to its profit of CA$14.8m. Despite this, the company did not generate any significant free flow in that time. The company has also been issuing new shares, diluting their share of future earnings. This dilution has had a significant impact on its earnings per share growth. Kraken Robotics has weak cashflow relative to earnings, indicating lower quality earnings, and its dilution means its growth is weaker than its profit growth. The article also suggests that high equity return on equity could be a good sign of a quality business.",

      "text": "Results\n22\nMidstream oil and gas companies, specifically pipeline operators, are well-positioned to benefit from Trump\u2019s executive orders on fossil fuels enacted in early 2025. \u2013 \u2013 These policies aim to accelerate infrastructure development by streamlining environmental reviews and permitting processes, such as those under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling. Pipelines and storage facilities will be critical to moving larger volumes of oil and gas efficiently, especially with the renewed emphasis on LNG exports to meet global demand.\n22

  "argos_summary": "Kraken Robotics Inc. reported solid earnings growth but weak free\u2011cash\u2011flow and a high accrual ratio of 0.38, signalling lower quality earnings. Shareholders were muted as the company diluted its equity by 33% over the past year, eroding EPS growth relative to revenue. Analysts have lifted the price target to CA$4.25, but concerns remain over negative free cash flow and the impact of share dilution on future profitability.",
