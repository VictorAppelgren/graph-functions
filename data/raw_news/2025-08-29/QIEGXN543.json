  "description": "President Trump has maligned Democratic-run cities that all are in states that opposed him in 2024. But he hasn't threatened sending in the National Guard to any major cities in Republican-leaning states.",
  "content": "President Trump has threatened to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, New York, Seattle, Baltimore, San Francisco and Portland, Ore., to fight what he says is runaway crime. Yet data shows most violent crime in those places and around the country has declined in recent years.\n\nHomicides through the first six months of 2025 were down significantly compared to the same period in 2024, continuing a post-pandemic trend across the U.S.\n\nTrump, who has already taken federal control of police in Washington, D.C., has maligned the six Democratic-run cities that all are in states that opposed him in 2024. But he hasn\u2019t threatened sending in the Guard to any major cities in Republican-leaning states.\n\nJohn Roman, a data expert who directs the Center on Public Safety & Justice at the University of Chicago, acknowledged violence in some urban neighborhoods has persisted for generations. But he said there\u2019s no U.S. city where there \u201cis really a crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a remarkable moment in crime in the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump might be tapping somewhat into public perception when he describes cities such as Chicago as a \u201ckilling field.\u201d The vast majority of Americans, 81%, see crime as a \u201cmajor problem\u201d in large cities, according to a survey released this week by The AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, though there is much less support, 32%, for federal control of police.\n\nThe public was reminded this week that shootings remain a frequent event in the U.S. In Minneapolis, which has seen homicides and most other crime fall, a shooter killed two children attending a Catholic school Mass Wednesday and wounded 17 a day after three people died in separate shootings elsewhere in the city.\n\nStill, over time, the picture is encouraging, according to numbers from AH Datalytics, which tracks crimes across the country using law enforcement data for its Real-Time Crime Index.\n\nAggravated assaults \u2014 which includes nonfatal shootings \u2014 through June were down in Chicago, Portland, Seattle, Baltimore and San Francisco and were virtually unchanged in New York. Reports of rape were up in New York and Chicago during the first half of the year, but down in the other cities, including a 51% drop in San Francisco.\n\nThe crime index also showed that property crimes, such as theft, burglary and motor vehicle theft, were mostly down in those six cities in the first six months of 2025. Theft crimes rose from 2020 to 2024 in four of the six cities analyzed by AP.\n\nTrump exaggerated and misstated facts about crime in Washington when his administration took over the D.C. police department and flooded the capital with federal agents and the National Guard. He referred to Baltimore, 40 miles (64 kilometers) away, as a \u201chellhole\u201d during a Cabinet meeting and has said he might \u201csend in the \u2018troops.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not walking in Baltimore right now,\u201d Trump said.\n\nYet Baltimore has shown drops in major crime, according to the crime index. Homicides and rapes were down 25% or more in the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. Homicides were down for three consecutive years through 2024 and were 35% lower when compared to 2018.\n\n\u201cDeploying the National Guard for municipal policing purposes is not sustainable, scalable, constitutional, or respectful,\u201d Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, said on social media site X.\n\nBaltimore has found ways to reduce violence by offering mentorship, social services and job opportunities to young people likely to commit crimes, said Michael Scott, director of the Center for Problem-Oriented Policing at Arizona State University and a former police chief in Florida.\n\n\u201cThat approach has resulted in more significant reductions in shootings and homicides than any other strategy I\u2019ve seen in the over 50 years I\u2019ve been in the field,\u201d Scott said.\n\nVice President JD Vance told a Wisconsin crowd on Thursday that governors and mayors should ask the Trump administration for help.\n\n\u201cThe president of the United States is not going out there forcing this on anybody,\u201d Vance said of using the National Guard, \u201cthough we do think that we have the legal right to clean up America\u2019s streets if we want to.\u201d\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t seem to disparage big cities in states that favor Republicans. Charlotte, North Carolina, had 105 homicides in 2024 compared to 88 in 2023. The rate of vehicle thefts per 100,000 people more than doubled there from 2020 through 2024. Indianapolis had a homicide rate of 19 per every 100,000 residents in 2024 \u2014 more than four times higher than New York\u2019s.\n\nAmy Holt, 48, who recently moved to Charlotte from a gated community in northern Virginia, said someone tried to steal her husband\u2019s car in their new city. She also found bullets on the ground while walking with dogs.\n\nThere\u2019s no discussion about sending the National Guard to Charlotte. Holt believes most cities should be trusted to be in charge of public safety, adding that troops in uniforms would be \u201calarming\u201d and \u201cscary.\u201d\n\nDemocratic elected officials in cities targeted by Trump have publicly rejected suggestions that their residents need the National Guard. \u201cCrime is at its lowest point in decades, visitors are coming back, and San Francisco is on the rise,\u201d Mayor Daniel Lurie said.\n\nExperts question just how effective the National Guard would be and where troops would be deployed in cities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to make residents think: Things must be much worse than I realize to have the military in my neighborhood. What\u2019s going on?\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt\u2019s more likely to generate undue fear and apprehension than it will lead to perceptions of reassurance and safety.\u201d\n\nWhite and Keller write for the Associated Press. White reported from Detroit and Keller reported from Albuquerque, N.M. AP video journalist Erik Verduzco in Charlotte, N.C., contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Trump says Beverly Hills is crime-ridden. Really? \u2018I\u2019ve never felt unsafe here\u2019\n- Share via\nPresident Trump this summer has railed against American cities he says are beset by crime and disorder.\nLos Angeles: \u201cLawless.\u201d\nChicago: \u201cA killing field.\u201d\nBaltimore: \u201cA hell hole.\u201d\nWashington: \u201cOut of control.\u201d\nBut Beverly Hills?\nAs the president this week threatened to send National Guard and other troops to more American cities, he has some choice words about the wealthy enclave where he once owned a home. During an Oval Office talk in which he defended troop deployments in Los Angeles and Washington, the conversation suddenly turned to Beverly Hills.\nTrump called the city \u201ca great place\u201d but noted he has friends who leave the trunk and doors of their cars open because they know they\u2019re going to be vandalized and don\u2019t want to risk getting the windows or other parts of their vehicles damaged.\n- Share via\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want the trunk ripped off in order for them to steal what\u2019s in there, in the back,\u201d he said.\nThe president also said another friend of his leaves his garage door open, \u201cso that people can just walk into his garage and take whatever they want and leave.\u201d\nIn a city that prides itself on its opulent image, the comments took officials by surprise.\nResponding to a question about Trump\u2019s comments, a city spokesperson told The Times in a statement that Beverly Hills is not aware of residents intentionally leaving their vehicles unlocked to prevent vandalism.\nReported cases of stolen items (that amounted to less than a $950 loss) from a vehicle within the city have steadily increased, according to Beverly Hills Police Department data. In 2022 there was a total of 324 theft reports, an estimated 386 in 2023, in 2024 there were 472.\nPolice data show overall crime in the city rose in 2022 and 2023 but fell in 2024.\nIn recent years, Beverly Hills police have been most focused on retail crime in the luxury-good corridor of Rodeo Drive, not car thefts. After a series of high-profile incidents \u2014 including the armed robbery of a diner\u2019s $500,000 watch at a local restaurant \u2014 the city beefed up patrols and security details. Officials also started a drone surveillance program. The department has also faced allegations \u2014 which it denies \u2014 of targeting Black shoppers.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the president has made this claim about the city. At the Republican convention in Orange County two years ago, Trump made the same remarks without attributing the information to any source, ABC News reported.\nStill some strolling Rodeo Drive this week were taken aback by the president\u2019s comments.\nIan Campbell, a Rodeo Drive regular in a yellow-tinted pair of Louis Vuitton shades and leather designer bag, said Beverly Hills isn\u2019t and has never been a place known for crime.\n\u201cI\u2019m here all the time, and it\u2019s always been safe and mostly calm,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cNothing has changed recently\u2026. I\u2019ve never felt unsafe here.\u201d\nJason Trucco, a former resident of Beverly Hills who now lives in New York on the Lower East Side, said he believed Beverly Hills was still relatively safe compared with other places where he stayed.\n\u201cI lived in a lot of more dangerous neighborhoods than this,\u201d Trucco said.\nThe president\u2019s remarks were about public safety, said Roxanne Hoge, chair of the Republican Party of Los Angeles County.\n\u201cWhich is the No. 1 job of government, and when our local leaders can\u2019t get it right then I understand Trump\u2019s need to speak up and take action on this very important topic,\u201d Hoge said.\nThere are people, she said, who live in Los Angeles County who know which are the \u201cno-go\u201d zones and which are safe. Beverly Hills, however, is not in the \u201cno-go\u201d zones, Hoge said.\nThe president of the West Hollywood-Beverly Hills Democratic Club, Noah Margo, chalked up Trump\u2019s remarks to \u201cpublicity stunts that are used to divide us.\u201d\n\u201cAs far as their validity, I can\u2019t speak for every resident of Beverly Hills, but I would venture to say that most of us keep our vehicles locked,\u201d Margo said.\nSo why did Trump bring up secondhand accounts of crime in Beverly Hills?\n\u201cUsing our name tends to reach more people than most other cities might,\u201d Margo said. \u201cAlthough I find it ironic that he picked one of the least crime-affected cities in Los Angeles County.\u201d\nSome residents will agree with Trump, and others may find the president\u2019s remarks insulting, Margo said.\n\u201cWhat should concern most people is why the National Guard would need to be involved with people breaking into cars,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that falls under the jurisdiction of any of our military branches.\u201d"

      "text": "\u2018Leave our kids alone\u2019: Schools reopen in D.C. with parents on edge over Trump\u2019s armed patrols\n- Share via\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Public schools reopened Monday in the nation\u2019s tense capital, with parents on edge over the presence in their midst of thousands of National Guard troops \u2014 some now armed \u2014 and large scatterings of federal law enforcement officers carrying out President Trump\u2019s orders to make the District of Columbia a safer place.\nEven as Trump started talking about other cities and again touted a drop in crime that he attributed to his extraordinary effort to take over policing in Washington, D.C., the district\u2019s mayor was lamenting the effect of Trump\u2019s actions on children.\n\u201cParents are anxious. We\u2019ve heard from a lot of them,\u201d Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a news conference, noting that some might keep their children out of school because of immigration concerns.\n\u201cAny attempt to target children is heartless, is mean, is uncalled for and it only hurts us,\u201d she said. \u201cI would just call for everybody to leave our kids alone.\u201d\nRumors of police activity abound\nAs schools opened across the capital, parental social media groups and listservs were buzzing with reports and rumors of checkpoints and arrests.\nThe week began with some patrolling National Guard units now carrying firearms. The change stemmed from a directive issued late last week by his Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\nArmed National Guard troops from Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee were seen around the city Monday. But not every patrol appears to be carrying weapons. An Associated Press photographer said the roughly 30 troops he saw on the National Mall on Monday morning were unarmed.\nArmed Guard members in Washington will be operating under long-standing rules for the use of military force inside the U.S., the military task force overseeing all the troops deployed to the district said Monday. Those rules, broadly, say that while troops can use force, they should do so only \u201cin response to an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm\u201d and \u201conly as a last resort.\u201d\nThe task force has directed questions on why the change was necessary to Hegseth\u2019s office. Those officials have declined to answer those questions. Speaking in the Oval Office on Monday, Hegseth said it was common sense to arm them because it meant they were \u201ccapable of defending themselves and others.\u201d\nAmong their duties is picking up trash, the task force said, though it\u2019s unclear how much time they will spend doing that.\nBowser reiterated her opposition to the National Guard\u2019s presence. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that troops should be policing American cities,\u201d she said.\nTrump is considering expanding the deployments to other Democratic-led cities, including Baltimore, Chicago and New York, saying the situations in those cities require federal action. In Washington, his administration says more than 1,000 people have been arrested since Aug. 7, including 86 on Sunday.\n\u201cWe took hundreds of guns away from young kids, who were throwing them around like it was candy. We apprehended scores of illegal aliens. We seized dozens of illegal firearms. There have been zero murders,\u201d Trump said Monday.\nSome other cities bristle at the possibility of military on the streets\nThe possibility of the military patrolling streets of Chicago, the nation\u2019s third-largest city, prompted immediate backlash, confusion and a trail of sarcastic social media posts.\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, a first-term Democrat, has called it unconstitutional and threatened legal action. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker deemed it a distraction and unnecessary as crime rates in Chicago are down, as they are nationwide.\nPritzker, often mentioned as a presidential contender, posted an Instagram video Monday of his 6 a.m. walk along a Lake Michigan path filled with runners and walkers.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who in Washington thinks that Chicago is some sort of hellhole, but you may need to look inward,\u201d he said, mocking Trump\u2019s term describing Washington.\nOthers raised questions about where patrols might go and what role they might play. By square mileage, Chicago is more than three times the size of Washington, and neighborhoods with historically high crime are spread far apart.\nFormer Chicago Police Supt. Garry McCarthy, who also worked for the New York Police Department, wondered what the National Guard would do in terms of fighting street violence. He said if there was clear communication, they could help with certain tasks, such as perimeter patrol in high-crime neighborhoods, but only as part of a wider plan and in partnership with police.\nNational Guard troops were used in Chicago to help with the Democratic National Convention last summer and during the 2012 North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit.\nOverall, violent crime in Chicago dropped significantly in the first half of 2025, representing the steepest decline in over a decade, according to police data. Shootings and homicides were down more than 30% in the first half of the year compared with the same time last year, and total violent crime dropped by over 22%.\nStill, some neighborhoods, including Austin on the city\u2019s West Side, where the Rev. Ira Acree is a pastor, experience persistent high crime.\nAcree said he\u2019s received numerous calls from congregants upset about the possible deployment. He said if Trump was serious about crime prevention, he would boost funding for anti-violence initiatives.\n\u201cThis is a joke,\u201d Acree said. \u201cThis move is not about reducing violence. This is reckless leadership and political grandstanding. It\u2019s no secret that our city is on the president\u2019s hit list.\u201d\nIn June, roughly 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines were sent to Los Angeles to deal with protests over the administration\u2019s immigration crackdown. California\u2019s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, and other local elected officials objected.\nSherman, Khalil and Tareen write for the Associated Press. Tareen reported from Chicago. AP writers Konstantin Toropin and Will Weissert contributed to this report."

      "text": "August 27, 2025\nEarlier this month President Trump activated National Guard members to reduce crime in Washington, D.C. and has threatened similar federal interventions in other large cities. Two-thirds of the public think crime is a major problem in the country overall and 8 in 10 say it is a major problem in large cities. Only about a fifth say crime is a major problem in small towns or rural areas, or in their own community.\nFifty-five percent of the public think it\u2019s acceptable for the U.S. military and National Guard to assist local police in large cities. But only a third support the federal government taking control of major city police departments.\nThere are large differences in the views of Republicans and Democrats regarding use of the military in urban law enforcement. About 8 in 10 Republicans say it\u2019s acceptable for the federal government to use the military and National Guard to assist local police. However, only half think it is acceptable for the federal government to take control of large city police departments.\nDemocrats are opposed to having the federal government send troops to large cities at all.\nTwo-thirds of the public think crime in the United States is a major problem and even more, 81%, think it\u2019s a major concern in cities. Ninety-six percent of Republicans see crime as a major problem in large cities, along with 68% of Democrats.\nFew people say crime is a major problem in their own community, but residents of urban areas are more likely than suburbanites or people living in rural areas to say crime is a major problem in their community. Thirty-seven percent of city dwellers say crime is a major problem in their community compared with only 19% of people who live in the suburbs and 22% of those who reside in rural parts of the country.\nCrime is a relatively strong issue for the president, with 53% of the public approving of how he is handling it. That is higher than Trump\u2019s overall job approval or approval of his handling of other issues. His overall job approval rating of 45% is up 5 points from the AP-NORC poll taken in July. The public\u2019s opinion of how the president is managing the economy has also ticked up compared with July. Forty-three percent approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the economy, up from 38% last month. Still, 6 in 10 say the national economy is in poor condition.\nThe nationwide poll was conducted August 21-25, 2025, using the AmeriSpeak\u00ae Panel, the probability-based panel of NORC at the University of Chicago. Online and telephone interviews using landlines and cell phones were conducted with 1,182. The overall margin of sampling error is +/- 3.8 percentage points.\nSuggested Citation: AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. \u201cMost say crime is a major problem in America\u2019s cities, but few support a federal takeover of police departments\u201d (August 2025). https://apnorc.org/projects/most-say-crime-is-a-major-problem-in-americas-cities-but-few-support-a-federal-takeover-of-police-departments/"

      "text": "Some National Guard units in D.C. are now carrying firearms in escalation of Trump deployment\n- Share via\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Some National Guard units patrolling the nation\u2019s capital at the direction of President Trump have started carrying firearms, an escalation of his military deployment that makes good on a directive issued late last week by his Defense secretary.\nA Defense Department official who was not authorized to speak publicly said Sunday that some units on certain missions would be armed \u2014 some with handguns and others with rifles. The spokesperson said that all units with firearms have been trained and are operating under strict rules for use of force.\nAn Associated Press photographer on Sunday saw members of the South Carolina National Guard outside Union Station in Washington with holstered handguns.\nA statement from the joint task force that has taken over policing in the nation\u2019s capital said units began carrying their service weapons Sunday and that the military\u2019s rules say force should be used \u201conly as a last resort and solely in response to an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm.\u201d It said the force is committed to protecting \u201cthe safety and wellbeing\u201d of Washington\u2019s residents.\nThe Defense official who spoke to the Associated Press said only troops on certain missions would carry guns, and that would include those patrolling to establish a law enforcement presence throughout the capital. Those working in transportation or administration would probably remain unarmed.\nThousands of National Guard and federal law enforcement officers from several states are now patrolling the district\u2019s streets, drawing sporadic protests from residents.\nThe development in Trump\u2019s extraordinary effort to override the law enforcement authority of state and local governments \u2014 which began with his ordering the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests against his immigration crackdown \u2014 comes as he is considering expanding the deployments to other Democratic-led cities, including Baltimore, Chicago and New York.\nEarlier Sunday, the president responded to an offer by Maryland\u2019s governor to join him in a tour of Baltimore by saying he might instead \u201csend in the \u2018troops.\u201d\nGov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, has criticized Trump\u2019s unprecedented flex of federal power, which the president says is necessary to combat crime and homelessness in Washington. Moore last week invited Trump to visit his state to discuss public safety and walk the streets.\nIn a social media post Sunday, Trump said Moore asked \u201cin a rather nasty and provocative tone,\u201d and then raised the specter of repeating the National Guard deployment he made in Los Angeles over the objections of California\u2019s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom.\n\u201cWes Moore\u2019s record on Crime is a very bad one, unless he fudges his figures on crime like many of the other \u2018Blue States\u2019 are doing,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cBut if Wes Moore needs help, like Gavin Newscum did in L.A., I will send in the \u2018troops,\u2019 which is being done in nearby DC, and quickly clean up the Crime.\u201d\nMoore said he invited Trump to Maryland \u201cbecause he seems to enjoy living in this blissful ignorance\u201d about improving crime rates in Baltimore.\nAfter a spike during the pandemic that matched nationwide trends, Baltimore\u2019s violent crime rate has fallen. The 200 homicides reported last year were down 24% from the prior year and 42% since 2021, according to city data. From 2023 to 2024, overall violent crime was down nearly 8% and property crimes down 20%.\n\u201cThe president is spending all of his time talking about me,\u201d Moore said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m spending my time talking about the people I serve.\u201d\nTrump is \u201cspouting off a bunch of lies about public safety in Maryland,\u201d Moore said in a fundraising email.\nIn Washington, where Trump is surging National Guard troops and federal law enforcement officers, a patchwork of protests popped up throughout the city over the weekend, while some normally bustling corners were noticeably quiet. In some of the most populated areas, residents walked by small groups of National Guard troops, often talking among themselves. Videos of arrests and detainments circulated on social media.\nTrump has said Chicago and New York are most likely his next targets, eliciting strong responses from Democratic leaders in both states. The Washington Post reported Saturday that the Pentagon has spent weeks preparing for an operation in Chicago that would include National Guard troops and, potentially, active-duty forces.\nAsked about the Post report, the White House pointed to Trump\u2019s earlier comments discussing his desire to expand his use of military forces to target local crime.\n\u201cI think Chicago will be our next,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday, adding, \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll help with New York.\u201d\nTrump has repeatedly described some of the nation\u2019s largest cities \u2014 run by Democrats, with Black mayors and majority-minority populations \u2014 as dangerous and filthy. Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott is Black, as is Moore. The District of Columbia and New York City also have Black mayors.\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton, speaking during a religious event Sunday at Howard University in Washington, said the Guard\u2019s presence in the nation\u2019s capital was not about crime: \u201cThis is about profiling us.\u201d\n\u201cThis is laced with bigotry and racism,\u201d he later elaborated to reporters. \u201cNot one white mayor has been designated. And I think this is a civil rights issue, a race issue, and an issue of D.C. statehood.\u201d\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, said there is no emergency warranting the deployment of National Guard troops in Chicago.\n\u201cDonald Trump is attempting to manufacture a crisis, politicize Americans who serve in uniform, and continue abusing his power to distract from the pain he\u2019s causing families,\u201d Pritzker wrote on X. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to follow the law, stand up for the sovereignty of our state, and protect Illinoisans.\u201d\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said the city doesn\u2019t need \u201ca military occupation\u201d and would sue to block one. He said there has been no communication from the White House about a possible military deployment.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to surrender our humanity to this tyrant,\u201d Johnson said Sunday on MSNBC. \u201cI can tell you this, the city of Chicago has a long history of standing up against tyranny, resisting those who wish to undermine the interests of working people.\u201d\nCooper, Askarinam and Toropin write for the Associated Press. Cooper reported from Phoenix and Cooper and Ashkarinam from Washington."

  "argos_summary": "President Trump has threatened to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, New York, Seattle, Baltimore, San Francisco and Portland to combat what he calls runaway crime, even though data shows violent crime in those cities has fallen in the first half of 2025 compared to 2024. The article highlights that crime rates have declined post\u2011pandemic, with homicides and aggravated assaults down in most of the targeted cities, and that public opinion sees crime as a major problem but is largely opposed to federal takeover of local police. Trump\u2019s remarks have drawn criticism from city officials, who argue that the National Guard would be ineffective and politically motivated, and from the public, who are wary of militarizing urban law enforcement. The piece also notes that the president\u2019s rhetoric may influence market sentiment, particularly in equity indices and the U.S. dollar, as investors weigh the political risk of federal intervention.",
