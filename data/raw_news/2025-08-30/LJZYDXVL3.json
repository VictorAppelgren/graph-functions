A jury earlier this month found that the speeding Tesla driver was mostly to blame but Tesla was also responsible because of faulty technology.\n\nThe case has been watched closely by carmakers racing to develop fully self-driving features. They fear it could portend massive liability risks should future juries reviewing accidents decide carmakers are also to blame even when drivers act recklessly.\n\n\u201cIf the verdict is allowed to stand, it will chill innovation, harm road safety and invite future juries to punish manufacturers who bring new safety features to market,\u201d the company said in the filing.\n\nTesla is also arguing that opposing lawyers \u201cled the jury astray\u201d by introducing \u201chighly prejudicial but irrelevant evidence\u201d suggesting Tesla had hid or lost video and data that, after it was dug up by the opposing side, helped recreate what went wrong moments before the crash. Tesla had said that it made a mistake in not offering up the evidence earlier and did not do that deliberately.\n\nMusk had taken a big chance by allowing the case to go to trial at a pivotal moment for his electric car company. He is trying to convince Americans that his self-driving technology, improved since the 2019 crash, can be trusted amid ambitious plans to roll out driverless Tesla robotaxis around the country.\n\nMany similar cases against Tesla had either been dismissed or been settled by the company before going to trial.\n\nThe plaintiff lawyers revealed in a court filing last week that they had told Tesla that they were willing to accept $60 million to settle. But Tesla refused. In the end, the jury decided on compensatory and punitive damages for the family of the killed Naibel Benavides and her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, amounting to four times that amount.\n\nThe filing by Tesla on Friday asked the judge to grant it a new trial, throw out the award or at least vastly reduce it.\n\nThe jury held that Tesla bore significant responsibility because its technology failed even though the driver had admitted he was wrong to be distracted by his cellphone. The driver had settled separately with the Benavides family and Angulo. Tesla has said the technology had nothing to do with the crash.",

      "text": "Jury orders Tesla to pay more than $240 million in Autopilot crash case\nJury orders Tesla to pay more than $240 million in Autopilot crash case\nMIAMI (AP) \u2014 A Miami jury decided that Elon Musk\u2019s car company Tesla was partly responsible for a deadly crash in Florida involving its Autopilot driver assist technology and must pay the victims more than $240 million in damages.\nThe federal jury held that Tesla bore significant responsibility because its technology failed and that not all the blame can be put on a reckless driver, even one who admitted he was distracted by his cellphone before hitting a young couple out gazing at the stars. The decision comes as Musk seeks to convince Americans his cars are safe enough to drive on their own as he plans to roll out a driverless taxi service in several cities in the coming months.\nThe decision ends a four-year long case remarkable not just in its outcome but that it even made it to trial. Many similar cases against Tesla have been dismissed and, when that didn\u2019t happen, settled by the company to avoid the spotlight of a trial.\n\u201cThis will open the floodgates,\u201d said Miguel Custodio, a car crash lawyer not involved in the Tesla case. \u201cIt will embolden a lot of people to come to court.\u201d\nThe case also included startling charges by lawyers for the family of the deceased, 22-year-old, Naibel Benavides Leon, and for her injured boyfriend, Dillon Angulo. They claimed Tesla either hid or lost key evidence, including data and video recorded seconds before the accident. Tesla said it made a mistake after being shown the evidence and honestly hadn\u2019t thought it was there.\n\u201cWe finally learned what happened that night, that the car was actually defective,\u201d said Benavides\u2019 sister, Neima Benavides. \u201cJustice was achieved.\u201d\nTesla has previously faced criticism that it is slow to cough up crucial data by relatives of other victims in Tesla crashes, accusations that the car company has denied. In this case, the plaintiffs showed Tesla had the evidence all along, despite its repeated denials, by hiring a forensic data expert who dug it up.\n\u201cToday\u2019s verdict is wrong,\u201d Tesla said in a statement, \u201cand only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla\u2019s and the entire industry\u2019s efforts to develop and implement lifesaving technology,\u201d They said the plaintiffs concocted a story \u201dblaming the car when the driver \u2013 from day one \u2013 admitted and accepted responsibility.\u201d\nIn addition to a punitive award of $200 million, the jury said Tesla must also pay $43 million of a total $129 million in compensatory damages for the crash, bringing the total borne by the company to $243 million.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big number that will send shock waves to others in the industry,\u201d said financial analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good day for Tesla.\u201d\nTesla said it will appeal.\nEven if that fails, the company says it will end up paying far less than what the jury decided because of a pre-trial agreement that limits punitive damages to three times Tesla\u2019s compensatory damages. Translation: $172 million, not $243 million. But the plaintiff says their deal was based on a multiple of all compensatory damages, not just Tesla\u2019s, and the figure the jury awarded is the one the company will have to pay.\nIt\u2019s not clear how much of a hit to Tesla\u2019s reputation for safety the verdict in the Miami case will make. Tesla has vastly improved its technology since the crash on a dark, rural road in Key Largo, Florida, in 2019.\nBut the issue of trust generally in the company came up several times in the case, including in closing arguments Thursday. The plaintiffs\u2019 lead lawyer, Brett Schreiber, said Tesla\u2019s decision to even use the term Autopilot showed it was willing to mislead people and take big risks with their lives because the system only helps drivers with lane changes, slowing a car and other tasks, falling far short of driving the car itself.\nSchreiber said other automakers use terms like \u201cdriver assist\u201d and \u201ccopilot\u201d to make sure drivers don\u2019t rely too much on the technology.\n\u201cWords matter,\u201d Schreiber said. \u201cAnd if someone is playing fast and lose with words, they\u2019re playing fast and lose with information and facts.\u201d\nSchreiber acknowledged that the driver, George McGee, was negligent when he blew through flashing lights, a stop sign and a T-intersection at 62 miles an hour before slamming into a Chevrolet Tahoe that the couple had parked to get a look at the stars.\nThe Tahoe spun around so hard it was able to launch Benavides 75 feet through the air into nearby woods where her body was later found. It also left Angulo, who walked into the courtroom Friday with a limp and cushion to sit on, with broken bones and a traumatic brain injury.\nBut Schreiber said Tesla was at fault nonetheless. He said Tesla allowed drivers to act recklessly by not disengaging the Autopilot as soon as they begin to show signs of distraction and by allowing them to use the system on smaller roads that it was not designed for, like the one McGee was driving on.\n\u201cI trusted the technology too much,\u201d said McGee at one point in his testimony. \u201cI believed that if the car saw something in front of it, it would provide a warning and apply the brakes.\u201d\nThe lead defense lawyer in the Miami case, Joel Smith, countered that Tesla warns drivers that they must keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel yet McGee chose not to do that while he looked for a dropped cellphone, adding to the danger by speeding. Noting that McGee had gone through the same intersection 30 or 40 times previously and hadn\u2019t crashed during any of those trips, Smith said that isolated the cause to one thing alone: \u201cThe cause is that he dropped his cellphone.\u201d\nThe auto industry has been watching the case closely because a finding of Tesla liability despite a driver\u2019s admission of reckless behavior would pose significant legal risks for every company as they develop cars that increasingly drive themselves.\n__\nCondon reported from New York.\n__\nEarlier versions of this story incorrectly reported that the jury ordered Tesla to pay $329 million and that the compensatory damages totaled $49 million."

      "text": "Musk\u2019s \u2018robotaxis\u2019 draw regulatory scrutiny after video shows one driving in an opposing lane\nMusk\u2019s \u2018robotaxis\u2019 draw regulatory scrutiny after video shows one driving in an opposing lane\nFederal traffic safety regulators are looking into suspected problems with Elon Musk\u2019s test run of self-driving \u201crobotaxis\u201d in Texas after videos surfaced showing them braking suddenly or going straight through an intersection from a turning lane and driving down the wrong side of the road.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Tuesday that it has asked Tesla for information about the apparent errors. Though many other videos show robotaxis driving perfectly, if regulators find any major issues, that would likely raise questions about Musk\u2019s repeated statements that the robotaxis are safe and his claim that Tesla will dominate a future in which nearly all cars on road will have no one behind the wheel \u2014 or even need a steering wheel at all.\n\u201cNHTSA is aware of the referenced incidents and is in contact with the manufacturer to gather additional information,\u201d the agency said in a statement.\nPassengers in Tesla robotaxis on the road in Austin, Texas, have generally been impressed, and the stock rose 8% Monday. Investors grew more cautious Tuesday after news of NHTSA\u2019s inquiry, and the stock fell more than 2%.\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nA bullish Tesla financial analyst who was driven around in a robotaxi on Sunday when the test runs began said his ride was perfect and suggested the videos on X and YouTube showing errors were no big deal.\n\u201cAny issues they encounter will be fixed,\u201d said Wedbush Securities\u2019 Dan Ives, calling the test a \u201chuge success\u201d in the past three days \u201cdespite the skeptics.\u201d\nOne of those skeptics, a Telemetry Insight expert in car technology, said the videos were alarming enough that the tests as currently run should be halted.\n\u201cThe system has always had highly erratic performance, working really well a lot of the time but frequently making random and inconsistent but dangerous errors,\u201d said Sam Abuelsamid in a text, referring to Tesla\u2019s self-driving software. \u201cThis is not a system that should be carrying members of the public or being tested on public roads without trained test drivers behind the wheel.\u201d\nIn one video, a Tesla moves into a lane with a big yellow arrow indicating it is for left turns only but then goes straight through the intersection instead, entering an opposing lane on the other side. The car seems to realize it made some mistake and begins to swerve several times, with the steering wheel jerking back and forth, before eventually settling down.\nBut the Tesla proceeds in the opposing lane for 10 seconds. At the time, there was no oncoming traffic.\nThe passenger in the car who posted the video, money manager Rob Maurer, shrugged off the incident.\n\u201cThere are no vehicles anywhere in sight, so this wasn\u2019t a safety issue,\u201d Maurer said in commentary accompanying his video. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable in the situation.\u201d\nAnother video shows a Tesla stopping twice suddenly in the middle of the road, possibly responding to the flashing lights of police cars. But the police are obviously not interested in the Tesla or traffic in front or behind it because they have parked on side roads not near it, apparently responding to an unrelated event.\nFederal regulators opened an investigation last year into how Teslas with what Musk calls Full Self-Driving have responded in low-visibility conditions after several accidents, including one that was fatal. Tesla was forced a recall 2.4 million of its vehicles at the time.\nMusk has said his Teslas using Full Self-Driving are safer than human drivers and his robotaxis using a newer, improved version of the system will be so successful so quickly that he will be able to deploy hundreds of thousands of them on the road by the end of next year.\nEven if the Austin test goes well, though, the billionaire faces big challenges. Other self-driving companies have launched taxis, including Amazon\u2019s Zoox and current market leader Waymo, which is not only is picking up passengers in Austin, but several other cities. The company recently announced it had clocked its 10 millionth paid ride.\nMusk needs a win in robotaxis. His work on in Trump administration as cost-cutting czar has alienated many buyers among Tesla\u2019s traditional environmentally conscious and liberal base in the U.S., tanking sales. Buyers in Europe having balked, too, after Musk embraced some extreme right-wing politicians earlier this year in both Britain and Germany."
