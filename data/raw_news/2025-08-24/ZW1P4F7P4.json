  "content": "MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 The sole survivor of a deadly lunch laced with toxic mushrooms said on Monday he felt only half alive following the death of his wife and he continued to grieve the loss of his two closest friends.\n\nA jury convicted Patterson, 50, in July of murdering Wilkinson\u2019s wife Heather Wilkinson, her sister Gail Patterson, and her husband Don Patterson with a lunch of beef Wellington pastries and foraged death cap mushrooms in July 2023.\n\nErin Patterson was also convicted of attempting to murder Ian Wilkinson, who spent weeks in hospital and survived after receiving a liver transplant.\n\nWilkinson, a Baptist pastor, described his wife as a woman who took her faith seriously and was full of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness, faithfulness and self-control.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the distressing shortcomings of our society that so much attention is showered on those who do evil and so little on those who do good,\u201d he added.\n\nHe described Gail and Don Patterson, the parents of Erin Patterson\u2019s estranged husband Simon Patterson, as the closest people to him after his wife and family.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m distressed that Erin has acted with callous and calculated disregard for my life and the lives of those I love. What foolishness possesses a person to think that murder could be the solution to their problems, especially the murder of people who have only good intentions towards her?\u201d he added.\n\nWilkinson offered Patterson his forgiveness for the harms she had done to him.\n\n\u201cI say \u2018harms done to me\u2019 advisedly. I have no power or responsibility to forgive harms done to others,\u201d Wilkinson said.\n\n\u201cMy prayer for her is that she will use her time in jail wisely to become a better person,\u201d he added.\n\nErin Patterson attended the Melbourne court in person on Monday rather than watch via a video link from prison which she did during a hearing earlier this month. She wore a paisley top with a light brown jacket.\n\nSeven relatives of victims either read impact statements to the court on Monday or had them read on their behalf.",
