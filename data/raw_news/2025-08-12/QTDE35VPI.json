  "description": "Everything you need to know from the Giants' first day of joint practice with the Jets.",
  "content": "FLORHAM PARK, N.J. \u2014 If you like defense, Tuesday\u2019s joint practice between the New York Giants and Jets was for you! Here\u2019s everything that happened in the slugfest between MetLife Stadium\u2019s co-tenants:\n\nWith the practice conducted at the Jets\u2019 facility, the Giants left their injured players at home to rehab. That group included RB Cam Skattebo, WR Malik Nabers, WR Jalin Hyatt, WR Da\u2019Quan Felton, OL Evan Neal, CB Dru Phillips and CB Tre Hawkins.\n\nCoach Brian Daboll doesn\u2019t provide details on injuries, so it\u2019s hard to know the exact status of those players. But Nabers\u2019 continued absence is notable, as he was shut down during last Wednesday\u2019s practice and hasn\u2019t participated since. Nabers said after Wednesday\u2019s practice that his limited workload was \u201cpart of the plan.\u201d The star wide receiver has been managing a lingering toe injury all offseason.\n\nSkattebo hasn\u2019t practiced since enduring a setback with a hamstring injury Aug. 1, while Hawkins has been sidelined since last Wednesday after aggravating a hamstring injury, according to a league source.\n\nNeal was sidelined for practice last Thursday and didn\u2019t participate in Saturday\u2019s preseason opener with an undisclosed injury. He is losing valuable time in the battle for the starting right guard job. Phillips left Saturday\u2019s game after one series with an undisclosed injury.\n\nHyatt\u2019s absence is curious. He missed four practices early in camp with lower body \u201ctightness,\u201d but he had been a full participant in six straight practices before being a surprise inactive for the preseason opener. Daboll didn\u2019t reveal the nature of Hyatt\u2019s injury or when he got hurt.\n\nAll of the players on the physically unable to perform (PUP) list \u2014 RB Eric Gray, LT Andrew Thomas and OLB Victor Dimukeje \u2014 were also absent. Gray and Dimukeje are expected to shift to the reserve PUP list when the season starts, which would require them to miss at least the first four games.\n\nThomas\u2019 prolonged stint on the PUP list isn\u2019t yet a concern, but the season opener is less than four weeks away. The clock is ticking because the team will want to give Thomas time to ramp up for game action after an extended rehab process from a Lisfranc injury in his foot.\n\nJames Hudson, who has been filling in for Thomas as the first-team left tackle, left the field briefly but returned to finish practice. Cornerback Deonte Banks was spotted leaving practice during the final period.\n\nLinebacker Demetrius Flannigan-Fowles (undisclosed) and cornerback Korie Black (groin) worked on the side with trainers. Both players are working back from injuries.\n\nThere (still) is no quarterback controversy. Jaxson Dart\u2019s impressive preseason debut didn\u2019t impact the quarterback pecking order. The rookie worked exclusively with the second-team offense Tuesday, while Russell Wilson took every first-team rep.\n\nIt was an up-and-down practice for Dart, who completed 11-of-17 passes in 11-on-11 periods. Dart had one play blown dead when he failed to catch a shotgun snap, had a pass batted at the line and was off-target on a few incompletions.\n\nThe most encouraging aspect of Dart\u2019s day is that he was aggressive, pushing the ball downfield, and not just on deep bombs. He was patient behind rare good protection to hit tight end Theo Johnson on a deep out. Dart went through his progressions before finding wide receiver Montrell Washington for a chunk gain on a crossing route. Dart climbed the pocket to avoid pressure and hit wide receiver Ihmir Smith-Marsette on a deep out, which drew the quarterback an enthusiastic high-five from Daboll.\n\nPractice finished with a red-zone period. Dart capped the second-team\u2019s \u201cdrive\u201d with a perfectly-placed back-shoulder throw to wide receiver Zach Pascal, who did a tremendous job getting his feet inbounds while juggling the ball for a touchdown. That drew a huge smile from Daboll, who has been beaming about his first-round pick recently.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say the Giants\u2019 offense will be in trouble if it is without Nabers and Thomas this season. The absence of the offense\u2019s top two players was felt during an extremely sluggish start for the first team.\n\nThis is how Wilson\u2019s first four reps went: A sack as Hudson was beat inside (and was flagged for holding); a sack as Wilson fell with right guard Greg Van Roten getting pushed into his lap; a batted pass at the line; and a sack as Jets edge rusher Will McDonald blew past right tackle Jermaine Eluemunor with an inside move.\n\nThe number of sacks was telling since plays are rarely blown dead in practice. But the pocket collapsed so much or the pressure was so immediate that there was no choice but to declare a sack.\n\nDaboll\u2019s blood pressure was clearly rising as the period progressed, with penalties continuing to be an issue. Daboll and Eluemunor appeared to have a testy exchange at one point, as the starting offense continued to sputter.\n\nThird-string quarterback Jameis Winston, who only got four 11-on-11 reps in the practice, addressed the entire offense during a huddle after the poor showing in the first competitive period.\n\nDaboll\u2019s mood turned around as the offense finished the day on a high note in the red-zone period. The starters finished with the day three straight touchdowns. First, Wilson hit Johnson in the seam with a laser from the 8-yard line. Then, running back Devin Singletary found a huge hole on a zone-read handoff from the 7-yard line. Finally, Wilson delivered a strike to wide receiver Darius Slayton on a crossing route from the 4-yard line. Daboll greeted Wilson with a big high-five after the final touchdown of the drive.\n\nSlayton\u2019s workload was limited in his return from missing four practices with an undisclosed injury. Undrafted rookie Beaux Collins, who hadn\u2019t practiced since July 31 with an undisclosed injury, got extensive work with the first-team offense in his return to action. Pascal, Washington and Lil\u2019Jordan Humphrey also took reps with the starters.\n\nMeanwhile, even with Neal out, the rotation at right guard continued. The Giants continued managing the workload of 35-year-old starter Greg Van Roten, as Aaron Stinnie and Jake Kubas each played one period at right guard with the first-team offense.\n\nThe Giants\u2019 defense delivered a strong day. Jets quarterback Justin Fields had some quality moments early, but he eventually succumbed to a relentless Giants pass rush, which had itself a day.\n\nThe Giants\u2019 front, which is poised to be its strongest position group, combined for a lot of would-be sacks \u2014 had whistles been blown. On multiple plays, there were so many Giants in the backfield, it was tough to say who would\u2019ve gotten credit for the sack.\n\nWe know outside linebacker Brian Burns got one against Jets first-round right tackle Armand Membou. On another play, star defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence ran Fields to the sidelines, forcing him to throw the ball away.\n\nOutside linebacker Abdul Carter continues to demonstrate why he was the No. 3 pick in this year\u2019s draft. Perhaps the best example of his dominance came when he easily beat Jets center Joe Tippmann to get to Fields before he could throw the ball. While Fields eventually completed a beautiful pass to wide receiver Tyler Johnson, it likely would have been a sack in a regular game.\n\nAs has been the case all camp, Carter played on both sides of the defense and worked with both the first and second teams. While he was tested against Jets left tackle Olu Fashanu, Carter made it look easy going against the Jets\u2019 second-team line.\n\nThe Jets\u2019 first-team offense only scored one touchdown in its red-zone period at the end of practice, with Fields firing a sidearm strike to tight end Jeremy Ruckert from the 3-yard line.\n\nBanks had been running with the first-team defense before leaving during the final red-zone period. Art Green and O\u2019Donnell Fortune both got reps in Banks\u2019 place.\n\nWhile the Giants starters logged just two series in Saturday\u2019s preseason opener, Banks played the entire first half. General manager Joe Schoen said during the broadcast that it was \u201cimportant to get out here and let him play,\u201d so the Giants clearly want Banks getting as many reps as possible in these joint practices.\n\nInside linebacker Micah McFadden\u2019s impressive camp continued with a strong play against Jets running back Breece Hall to stop a run. Meanwhile Lawrence, who did not play in Saturday\u2019s preseason opener, took more team reps Tuesday as he works his way back from a dislocated elbow suffered last season. Lawrence said he\u2019s on track in his recovery.\n\nThird-round defensive tackle Darius Alexander, who has had a quiet camp, pressured Fields while playing with the starters in the final red-zone period.\n\nPascal\u2019s touchdown catch from Dart in the red zone was a masterful combination of soft hands and quick feet. Pascal was blanketed by Jets cornerback Jarrick Bernard-Converse, but Dart showed faith in the receiver by firing a pass to his back shoulder. Pascal tipped the ball back to his body with his right hand, tapping both feet inbounds as he hauled in the catch.\n\nQuote of the day\n\n\u201cWe have to respond tomorrow, honestly. Greatness and being a great team, you got to be consistent. We did well today. We have to go do well tomorrow because they\u2019re going to have a fire in them tomorrow.\u201d \u2014 DL Dexter Lawrence\n\nThe Giants will host the Jets for a second joint practice at 10 a.m. ET on Wednesday.",

      "text": "Here we go again.\nThe New York Giants and Jets are getting back together this week for joint practices, bringing into focus just how similar these two iconic franchises really are right now. The teams that share MetLife Stadium also share the same overarching storyline as we prepare to enter the 2025 season: Both are looking to shed the stink of the last couple of seasons and start building toward something better.\nAdvertisement\nWhile we won\u2019t see any regular-season action between these teams this year, they will square off for a pair of joint practices (Tuesday and Wednesday) ahead of Saturday\u2019s preseason game, where we\u2019ll crown a MetLife champion. But not really.\nTo preview how much has changed this offseason, our Jets and Giants reporters, Zack Rosenblatt and Charlotte Carroll, got together for a little back-and-forth to break down their respective teams.\nCall it the state of the tri-state:\nLet\u2019s start with a vibes check. Remember, the vibes coming out of New York by the end of last season were abysmal (not you, Buffalo. You\u2019re good). The Jets were a mess, pretty much from start to finish, while Giants fans were paying for planes to fly over MetLife, dragging banners demanding the franchise \u201cfix this dumpster fire.\u201d So \u2026 any improvement?\nRosenblatt: The vibes are significantly improved (so far). This is entirely Aaron Glenn\u2019s show, and everybody seems to be rowing in the same direction as the new coach. He, along with new general manager Darren Mougey, turned over the roster, injected it with youth and mostly rid themselves of older players or those who tended to draw too much unwarranted attention \u2014 specifically one. (Try to guess who.)\nMany players have gone out of their way to take shots at the previous regime, pointing out how Glenn has made this year\u2019s training camp competitive and physical. Meanwhile, stars like Garrett Wilson have spoken out about how they appreciate Glenn holding them accountable, something the previous staff struggled to do. Who knows if these positive summer vibes will lead to wins? The roster isn\u2019t as talented top to bottom as it was in recent years, but it\u2019s a lot quieter, and everyone seems to be buying in. A bonus: Justin Fields might be a question mark, but you won\u2019t find this quarterback making headlines in the same way as the last one.\nJustin Fields\nJets\n- Tier 4\n- Rank #27\n- Vote Avg. 3.7\nCarroll: Dare I say it? Hope has returned to Giants football. Yes, it\u2019s the preseason, and hope springs eternal for nearly every franchise in August \u2014 when everything is promise and potential, even though no \u201cmeaningful\u201d football has been played yet.\nHowever, the moment the Giants selected Jaxson Dart with the No. 25 pick in April\u2019s NFL Draft, they gave their fans reason to harbor some hope for the future. And so far \u2014 again, all the necessary caveats apply as no meaningful football has been played \u2014 Dart has done nothing but foster that hope.\nAdvertisement\nHe\u2019s said all the right things and done (almost) all the right things on the football field, most recently with how effective and poised he looked in his preseason debut against the Buffalo Bills. Even Giants coach Brian Daboll couldn\u2019t help but shower the young QB with praise \u2014 before adding the caveat that it\u2019s only the first preseason game.\nAnd we\u2019re going to let that last note bring you back down to Earth. We\u2019re talking about less than a half of football. It was a strong debut, to be sure, but we all know that a strong preseason doesn\u2019t guarantee anything in the regular season. Just look back at Daniel Jones\u2019 first preseason if you want proof.\nBut back to the question: The vibes are good. Maybe even great. Everyone is happy with Dart, and No. 3 pick Abdul Carter looks like he could be a game-wrecking force on an up-and-coming defense. But the good vibes will dissipate quickly if the Giants get off to another slow start to the regular season. Remember, Daboll and general manager Joe Schoen need a big bounce-back season if they\u2019re going to return for Year 5. A strong start could go a long way in keeping the good vibes alive.\nIs the quarterback of your team in 2027 already on the roster?\nRosenblatt: Back to Fields: This year will be a test of his viability as a long-term starter in the NFL. Based on what he\u2019s shown in his career so far in Chicago and Pittsburgh, it would be difficult to suggest he\u2019ll still be this team\u2019s starting quarterback years from now; he still has to prove he should be the starting quarterback for next season.\nThe Jets signed him to a contract (two years, $40 million) that would look stellar if he makes a Sam Darnold/Baker Mayfield-esque leap. And if he doesn\u2019t work out, it\u2019s not debilitating, and he can either act as a backup to someone else next or take part in a quarterback competition of some sort.\nAdvertisement\nAt a base level, the Jets want to be a running team; they built their offense around Fields\u2019 skill set, and this might be the best support system he\u2019s had in the NFL. If it were ever going to work, it would be with this group. If the experiment fails, the Jets can move on without any skin off their backs.\nCarroll: The Giants certainly hope so. They drafted Dart to be the future face of the franchise, but that was the easy part. The hard part is helping him become that caliber of player. The Giants have given him the gift of time (probably), as he\u2019ll sit behind starting QB Russell Wilson, and perhaps Jameis Winston, as he acclimates to the NFL.\nBut at some point, he\u2019ll need to prove it was a good idea for the Giants to trade up to get him. Will that be this season? That\u2019s what everyone wants to know. In an ideal world, essentially meaning if the Giants start fast, that time figures to be much later in the year, if at all. But things get more complicated if Wilson gets hurt or plays poorly and the Giants struggle out of the gates. If that happens, how quickly will Daboll go to the break-glass-in-case-of-emergency option and turn to Dart? And how will Dart respond if he\u2019s suddenly thrust into the spotlight? For as promising as his debut in Buffalo was, the only answer to that question is: We have no idea.\nRussell Wilson\nGiants\n- Tier 4\n- Rank #26\n- Vote Avg. 3.6\nWhich roster, excluding the QB, is in better shape?\nRosenblatt: This feels like more of a discussion than it was a year ago. On offense, the Jets are better at running back, tight end and on the offensive line, while the Giants have the edge at wide receiver \u2014 Malik Nabers and Garrett Wilson are probably a wash, but the rest of the Jets\u2019 wide receiver room might be the biggest concern on the roster.\nBoth teams have high-end talent on defense too: Sauce Gardner, Quincy Williams, Quinnen Williams, Jamien Sherwood, Michael Carter II and Will McDonald are as solid a young core as you\u2019ll find in the NFL. The Jets have the better secondary and off-ball linebackers, but the Giants have the better defensive line. All in all, it might be a wash, and, if we bring quarterbacks back into the mix, it probably just depends on how you feel about the 2025 ceilings of Fields and Dart.\nCarroll: So, what you\u2019re saying, Zack, is we should combine these rosters to create a New York super team, infuriating tri-state football purists who\u2019ve dedicated decades to their respective fandoms? It\u2019s a fun idea to mull over a beer, or in this case, a story previewing joint practices and the 2025 season. But I\u2019m not that diabolical.\nI think you laid out the roster differences pretty well, and I agree with most everything you said, though I\u2019d quibble with Nabers and Garrett Wilson being a wash. I think Nabers has true superstar potential; his 109 receptions (the most ever for a rookie WR) and 1,204 receiving yards in his rookie season (in 15 games) are feats that Wilson has yet to reach, despite playing for three seasons.\nAdvertisement\nOn defense, there\u2019s no Gardner in the Giants\u2019 secondary, but with the additions of Paulson Adebo and Jevon Holland in free agency, the Giants have a chance to make things close in that category, as well. Anyway, I\u2019ll be curious how my opinion changes about these rosters after watching joint practices this week.\nAs we\u2019re obviously expert oddsmakers, what percentage chance would you give the team you cover to make the playoffs?\nRosenblatt: I\u2019d say 25 percent. The Jets tend to be better served when there are no expectations. There was a lot of noise about them as a contender the last two years, and they failed miserably as dysfunction and an inability to overcome adversity destroyed them. They are moving in silence in 2025, which is what Glenn wants.\nAny shot they have at making the playoffs revolves around a few factors.\n1. Glenn and the coaching staff. The Jets lost a handful of games last year in which they led entering the fourth quarter, only to be done in by mental errors, poor coaching decisions and brutal mistakes. If the coaching is an upgrade, that could be good for a few wins.\n2. Quarterback. If Fields becomes the quarterback the Jets think he can be, the supporting cast is good enough to make this team a playoff contender.\n3. The AFC East is in a time of transition. The Buffalo Bills are locked in as the clear-cut favorite, but the Jets and New England Patriots have new coaches and are rebuilding, while the Miami Dolphins feel on the verge of disaster. All that said, the Jets lack weapons in the passing game outside of Wilson, at least at wide receiver; Fields is far from proven; depth across the board on defense is an issue; and both Glenn and offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand are in their roles for the first time in the NFL. A lot has to go right for this team to make the playoffs.\nCarroll: I was never very fond of math in school; numbers have never been my favorite. I prefer words, so let me put it this way: I\u2019ve never strongly considered playoff chances for this Giants team. I\u2019m more concerned with whether they show improvement and finish better than their 2024 record (3-14). A playoff berth means the offseason additions have worked tremendously, and this regime has cemented its future in New York.\nAdvertisement\nBut so much would have to go right for that to happen, and it just doesn\u2019t seem likely in a strong NFC East. Remember, the Giants went 0-6 against division opponents last year, and those teams are still somewhere between good and great. The division features the reigning Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles, the NFC runners-up Washington Commanders and the Dallas Cowboys, which will see the return of a healthy Dak Prescott. And that\u2019s just the division foes. New York is slated to take on what some consider the toughest slate in the league.\nPlus, unlike for the Jets, there likely will be a lot of noise around the Giants, especially if they start slow. If that happens, you\u2019ll be hearing a lot about: The end of Russell Wilson\u2019s career, when Dart should make his debut and if/when the Giants should fire their coach and GM.\nSo, the playoffs? That\u2019s not really something to think about right now.\n(Photos of Jaxson Dart and Justin Fields: Seth Wenig / Associated Press and Kayla Wolf / Imagn Images)"

That was twice his total from 2024, an indication the two-time MVP has proven his ability as a passer, including in the playoffs, at least to an extent.\nEvery 2025 QB Tiers ranking\nAnthony Richardson\nEagles\n- 2.18 Avg. tier\n- Retained tier Change from '24\nAmong the other highlights, Joe Burrow is a unanimous Tier 1 choice for the first time, Matthew Stafford makes his Tier 1 debut and Jayden Daniels sets a QB Tiers record for highest debut by a second-year QB.\nMeanwhile, Aaron Rodgers plummets to Tier 3, Caleb Williams checks in fourth among 2024 first-round QBs and Russell Wilson falls to Tier 4.\nDifference in overall rank year-over-year\nThe 2025 QB Tiers results are complete with commentary from the panel of 50 voters, who were granted anonymity to share candid evaluations. The panel comprised six general managers, six assistant GMs, six former GMs, five other executives, eight head coaches and 19 other coaches, including 15 coordinators.\nEach voter placed 34 veteran quarterbacks into five tiers, from best (Tier 1) to worst (Tier 5). Quarterbacks were then ranked by average vote and placed into tiers based on vote distribution. The survey excludes rookies because voters have not seen them play in the NFL.\nPatrick Mahomes\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n1 | Retained tier | 1 |\nVoters still consider Mahomes the best even though others have surpassed him statistically.\n\"I think Mahomes is the best quarterback to ever live,\" an offensive coordinator said, \"but the gap is smaller than it was a year ago.\"\nThis is Mahomes' fifth season as a unanimous Tier 1 selection. Only Aaron Rodgers, with six, has more unanimous selections since QB Tiers debuted in 2014.\n\"Mahomes is the best quarterback in the world,\" a GM said. \"Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson had better individual seasons. In fairness, the infrastructure around Patrick has eroded.\"\nMahomes led the league last season in game-winning drives (seven) and fourth-quarter comeback victories (five), per Pro Football Reference. Both were single-season career highs as Kansas City went 11-0 in games decided by eight or fewer points.\n\"Mahomes has the Brady seat now, until someone proves otherwise,\" an offensive coach said. \"Last year, I saw a headline saying something to the effect of, 'Mahomes' worst year to date, and the Chiefs are undefeated.' This is when this guy is too good for his own good.\"\nThe Chiefs' shrinking victory margins correlate with the shrinking gap between Mahomes, Burrow, Allen and Jackson.\n\"It would probably be Mahomes first just because he can beat you so many different ways,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"He ain't fast, but he runs on you. He throws it from all over the place. I hate facing Lamar now that they have Derrick Henry. I hate to see Josh Allen, and then Joe (Burrow) has great targets, but you can get after him.\"\nMahomes ranked 10th in EPA per pass play, 17th in passer rating (93.5) and 26th in yards per attempt (6.8) last season.\n\"Patrick is obviously still a 1, but he is winning out of need at the end of games,\" a head coach said. \"That is what it's about, but Burrow, Lamar and Josh played better than him in quarters one through four.\"\nNo voters came close to placing Mahomes in any other tier.\n\"Criticizing him is like walking into the Sistine Chapel and saying, 'I like Michelangelo's drawings, but his sense of color is off,'\" a defensive coach with AFC West experience said.\nJoe Burrow\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n1 | Retained tier | 1(-0.1) |\nThis is Burrow's fourth consecutive season in Tier 1 and his first as a unanimous top-tier selection. Rodgers (six), Mahomes (five), Tom Brady (four) and Russell Wilson (one) are the only other unanimous Tier 1 selections in the survey's history.\n\"He is the closest thing to Joe Montana that I have seen,\" a head coach said. \"That is about as big a compliment I can give you as a quarterback.\"\nOne difference: Montana's San Francisco 49ers led the NFL in fewest points allowed during the 1980s, while Burrow's Cincinnati Bengals ranked 25th last season.\n\"To me, it's Mahomes and then Burrow if I had to rank them,\" a veteran offensive coach said. \"Burrow could be a 1 with a red cross on him. They don't protect him, and he gets the s--- knocked out of him constantly.\"\nBurrow played all 17 games last season, leading the NFL in attempts, completions, yards and touchdowns.\n\"He's a stud, particularly with those freaks he has out there at receiver,\" a defensive coach said. \"I respect the arm talent, don't get me wrong, but you have to be able to fool him presnap, and you have to be able to rush with four and get there.\"\nJosh Allen\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n1 | Retained tier | 1.1(-0.1) |\nAllen ranks a tick below Mahomes and Burrow even though some consider him the most challenging to defend. That's because a few voters valued pure passing over running strongly enough to place a line after Mahomes and Burrow.\n\"Josh Allen presents some issues that Mahomes doesn't present, just how strong he is and how good of a runner he is,\" one voter said. \"I watched him single-handedly beat us. It's just, God, you can't tackle him. And he's got a cannon.\"\nAllen set career bests in 2024 for EPA per pass play, sack rate and rate of pass plays gaining more than 15 yards.\n\"Josh Allen reminds me of (Brett) Favre when he was younger,\" an offensive coach said. \"He is like a bull in a china shop, trying to score 70 every week. Burrow does it like a surgeon.\"\nThe Favre comp seems less relevant after Allen suffered only eight turnovers last season. That was down from 22 in 2023, and a career low by far.\n\"Josh Allen is the toughest quarterback to defend,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"He is a combination of Lamar and Burrow. Lamar is the better runner. Burrow is the better pure passer. Josh is right in the middle. He can sling the ball around for 400 yards. If you have that covered, he can run for 100 yards, too.\n\"The only thing that has been an issue for him is turnovers playing hero ball, and that was better last year.\"\nLamar Jackson\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n1 | Jumped 1 tier | 1.1(-0.5) |\nJackson has finally ascended into the top tier after two seasons of good health and great production in an offense showcasing his passing. He did so with 46 top-tier votes, twice his total from 2024 QB Tiers.\n\"Lamar has really done a great job, and I do not think it has been him that has let them down (in the playoffs),\" a defensive coordinator said. \"It has been other parts of their team. He has taken leaps and bounds in the last couple years.\"\nJackson set career bests last season for passing yards (4,172), yards per attempt (8.8), touchdown passes (41), interceptions (four), passer rating (119.6), sack rate (4.6 percent) and rate of passes gaining 15-plus yards (21.3 percent).\n\"There is a maturity of how he plays the game and when he turns on his magic,\" another voter said. \"We played them, and s---, he was almost perfect that day. He is definitely a 1.\"\nMost voters thought Jackson should have won MVP last season.\n\"It would have been his third,\" an offensive coordinator said. \"You can't win three MVPs, still be in your prime and not be a 1.\"\nOnly Sam Darnold and Baker Mayfield made bigger year-over-year gains in average tier vote, remarkable considering Jackson already ranked in the top five a year ago.\n\"There was doubt before because it was off-schedule, it was running, it's not sustainable, they have a great defense, they have this, they have that,\" another voter said. \"The offense has put the ball in his hands more, to sling the ball around.\"\nVoters also thought the Ravens' improved skill players were a factor.\n\"I'm a firm 1 on Lamar now,\" another defensive coordinator said. \"Even last year's game in the playoffs, he brought them back. (Mark) Andrews drops the ball at the end. Lamar is the total package, a very unique player.\"\nMatthew Stafford\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n1 | Jumped 1 tier | 1.5(-0.1) |\nStafford is making his Tier 1 debut at age 37 after 11 consecutive seasons in Tier 2. His ability to work through a back injury that has sidelined him in camp will be key.\n\"I always had a high admiration for him as a competitor, arm talent and playmaker, but always thought he was a gunslinger,\" one voter said. \"He still has that in him, but his mind, his ability to process, think and communicate stand out.\"\nStafford's ability to process and play from the pocket has long endeared him to offensive coaches who prefer to play that way.\n\"I guarantee all your 1s for Stafford came from offensive coaches,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"Offensive coaches kiss this guy's ass all the time, especially guys from that system. He's really good, though. I would take him over (Justin) Herbert because he is a better passer, with better timing.\"\nIt wasn't just offensive coaches pushing Stafford into Tier 1. Far from it. Three GMs, one assistant GM, three former GMs, four other personnel execs and seven defensive coordinators accounted for the bulk of Stafford's 26 top-tier votes.\n\"That dude is something,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"Every time I watch him, I go, 'Whoa!' He is a high 2.\"\nThis coordinator reconsidered when asked what was keeping Stafford from Tier 1.\n\"There is really nothing,\" the coordinator replied. \"He's a 1. He's that good. They are a play away from (the NFC Championship Game) last year. He worries the s--- out of you.\"\nJayden Daniels\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n2 | New to Tiers | 1.7 |\nNo second-year QB has made a higher Tiers debut than Daniels. His 1.71 average and 17 top-tier votes break the records C.J. Stroud set last year. Stroud had eclipsed 2021 Justin Herbert.\n\"What I respect most is it never seems too big for him,\" a defensive coordinator said of Daniels. \"He would stand in the pocket and deliver the ball. Once we saw him running around, it was, 'OK, he is going to be a problem.'\"\nDaniels became the only rookie starting quarterback in the Super Bowl era to reach a conference championship game without a top defense (Washington ranked 24th in defensive EPA per play, per TruMedia).\n\"He's a 2 with the arrow up,\" another defensive coordinator said. \"He can run, he can throw with accuracy and he's really calm \u2014 the s--- ain't too big for him, and it's easy to see when you are playing him. He doesn't get flustered.\"\nDaniels' 891 yards rushing last season ranked second to Jackson among quarterbacks. He is among 10 QBs in league history to average at least 50 yards rushing per game in 14-plus starts. The others: Jackson, Justin Fields, Bobby Douglass, Michael Vick, Randall Cunningham, Robert Griffin III, Russell Wilson, Jalen Hurts and Kyler Murray. Daniels might already be a better passer than most of those.\n\"He is probably the best passer in our division,\" a voter from one of Washington's NFC East rivals said. \"He is really good.\"\nDaniels commanded 13 more Tier 1 votes than the rest of the NFC East combined (Hurts got three, while Dak Prescott got one).\n\"This dude has got arm, legs and processing,\" another defensive coordinator said of Daniels. \"He just took his team to the championship game with a non-championship-caliber roster.\"\nCan Daniels sustain it? Stroud regressed after a stellar rookie season. Also, opponents seemed to figure out Washington offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury when he was in Arizona, where another dual-threat QB, Murray, failed to sustain early promise.\n\"I think he is tremendous,\" a head coach said of Daniels. \"I don't want to '1' him because I want to see another year. Get me halfway through that second year and I'll have a good feel. The defensive coordinators will have all had their shot.\"\nJustin Herbert\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n2 | Retained tier | 1.8(+0.2) |\nThe downward trend for Herbert among Tiers voters is clear. After peaking with 36 top-tier votes in 2022, the number has fallen to 29, 19 and now 13.\n\"A lot of people have him as an automatic 1,\" an offensive coordinator said. \"I want him to take it. It seems like he is almost there, but he hasn't really done it.\"\nThe talent is obvious.\n\"He is just a little bit robotic,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"You can tell, the way he processes everything, it is a click slower than some of the elites, but he is a stud \u2014 he is really good.\"\nShifting to a more run-oriented offense under coach Jim Harbaugh is another factor.\n\"He is probably like Joe Burrow lite,\" another voter said. \"Good player, can make all the throws, can decipher and operate. If they had more around him and he kept maturing, maybe there is some more there.\"\nThis voter thought the Chargers needed to add weaponry.\n\"They have like 18 running backs out there now,\" he said. \"They were so dependent on one receiver (Ladd McConkey) that we felt good matching up against everyone else.\"\nVoters wanted to see more from Herbert in critical moments.\n\"He's very smart and very competitive, but he lets little things distract him,\" an offensive coach said. \"He needs to forget about the little things. Jim (Harbaugh) will point that out to him and get it right. This will be a big year for him.\"\nJared Goff\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n2 | Retained tier | 2.1(-0.1) |\nGoff's standing in Tiers improved for a third consecutive year, resulting in career bests in ranking (eighth) and average vote (2.06).\n\"Goff and Burrow are probably the two best anticipation throwers that I have seen lately, so you have to put him at a 1,\" a head coach said. \"You might put him at a 2 from a pure quarterback standpoint \u2014 he struggles to extend plays \u2014 but the guy has played at a 1 level for three years.\"\nGoff has a league-high 96 touchdown passes over the past three seasons.\n\"You will see this year if it is the coordinator or the quarterback, but I think it has been more the quarterback than advertised,\" an exec said, noting that the Lions lost offensive coordinator Ben Johnson. \"Goff and Mayfield are legit guys who can get in a rhythm and dice you up. They are not as good as the top guys in Tier 1, but they deserve to be up there.\"\nEight voters placed Goff in Tier 3.\n\"He's a 3 because he needs the run game, he needs a defense, he needs all those things,\" one of these voters said.\nGoff's five top-tier votes this year are two more than he has commanded in eight previous QB Tiers appearances combined.\n\"He has definitely grown over the last couple years,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"Early in his career, if you got him to be just a dropback quarterback, he would make a lot more mistakes. He is better in that area as far as protecting the football. He has a good run game, they have a good team. I'm not going to hold that against him too much.\"\nC.J. Stroud\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n2 | Retained tier | 2.2(+0.4) |\nStroud remained solidly within Tier 2 despite suffering the fifth-largest year-over-year fall in average vote.\n\"He got rattled because of his offensive line, and you saw that in his play,\" one defensive coordinator said. \"When I watched them, I felt like he felt the rush. Because of that, I still think the talent is in there.\"\nStroud got one Tier 1 vote, down from 12 last year.\n\"Everybody wants to downgrade C.J.,\" another defensive coordinator said. \"His No. 1 receiver was out, the line did not play great, the run game wasn't there like it should have been.\"\nThis voter saw Stroud as a low 2.\n\"I read an article, they said it's time for him to take the next step,\" an offensive coach said. \"What is the next step? It's time for his team to take the next step. He's pretty damn productive.\"\nTwo voters compared Stroud to the Packers' Love.\n\"Very similar to Love in that some of the disguises, he'll hold the ball quite a bit, take some sacks, throw it into coverage at times,\" one of these voters said. \"The decision-making can be average.\"\nThe defensive coordinator who faced Stroud did raise concerns over the quarterback's 86-yard game against the Packers.\n\"He can carry the team,\" this coordinator said. \"He is special in my eyes because he can throw from the pocket, he can throw off-schedule, he has been really good with the game on the line. The one thing that would sway me to go to a 3 was his performance at Green Bay. I wasn't crazy about the play calls at the end, but if he had won that game, he would be a solid 2. He is a 2-3 to me.\"\nJalen Hurts\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n2 | Retained tier | 2.2(-0.1) |\nHurts' standing in Tiers barely changed after his Eagles won the Super Bowl with a run-oriented offense, a stacked roster and high-level production from Hurts on the biggest stage.\n\"Jalen does everything the right way for how they have been built,\" an offensive coordinator said. \"I see him as a really good player on a team with a bunch of really good players.\"\nThis is Hurts' third consecutive season in Tier 2.\n\"He has improved from the pocket, but when you play him, you still want him to beat you from there \u2014 that is the whole plan,\" a head coach said. \"If he can get out of the pocket in two-minute, he is effective as hell, and he has done it. But he has to do it with his legs in crunch time. The guys you want can do it with the arm and legs in crunch time.\"\nHurts has the lowest average tier vote for any quarterback coming off a Super Bowl victory since Eagles alum Nick Foles won as a backup after the 2017 season.\nThis speaks to the Eagles' ability to assemble top-notch rosters around their quarterbacks. Hurts also might be underrated.\n\"This is going to sound like I don't like him, but I do,\" a GM said. \"Just by the definition, I feel he is more of a 3. Am I on an island with that?\"\nNope: Eleven other voters also placed Hurts in Tier 3.\n\"Hurts is always a tough one for me,\" a former GM said. \"I think he is a 3. They are very talented around him, and he is not as consistent as a passer. They have a strong defense, great playmakers, great offensive line. He is able to function that way. But I don't know that he is the one that elevates them. That is not a slight.\n\"He is a good player. But putting him in that 2 category, I don't see that.\"\nHurts attempted 30 or more passes in each of the Eagles' first four games last season, but only once thereafter as Philadelphia leaned into its run game.\n\"They tried to throw it more early in the year,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"He could not do that, so they said, 'Screw it, run the ball 40 times a game.' I still gave Hurts a 2. He is a winner, and he can do it sometimes.\"\nBaker Mayfield\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n2 | Jumped 1 tier | 2.3(-0.5) |\nAnother strong season in Tampa pushed Mayfield to career bests in ranking (11th) and average tier vote (2.30).\n\"He went from being a wild man to being a contained wild man now,\" an offensive coach said. \"He is still going to turn the ball over here and there, but he can elevate everyone around him through his style of play.\"\nMayfield's 33 votes in Tier 2 were one fewer than he commanded over the past five years combined.\n\"He has matured,\" a defensive coach said. \"Think of this: Same guy who was wearing a bath robe in a commercial when he played for the Browns?\"\nMayfield has gone from Dave Canales to Liam Coen to Josh Grizzard as his offensive coordinator in three years with the Buccaneers.\n\"To his credit, he has different coordinators the last few years, and he is getting progressively better,\" an exec said. \"His ability and playmaking has helped him get back to the place where he was drafted, first overall.\"\nCanales and Coen had never been primary play callers in the NFL. Both became head coaches after one season with Mayfield.\n\"You look at his path, s---, talk about playing your best ball with your back against the wall,\" a head coach said. \"Gotta give him a 2.\"\nDoes Mayfield's status as a No. 1 pick give him the benefit of the doubt over, say, Brock Purdy, who entered the NFL as Mr. Irrelevant?\n\"Baker has more playmaking ability \u2014 he can carry it a little bit more,\" one voter said.\nPurdy has benefited from playing in the same system.\n\"Purdy is a better, quicker decision-maker, and he sees it, and he has a little more touch on the passes, whereas Baker throws that b---- hard,\" another defensive coach said. \"He lacks some touch and may not get it out of there as quickly as the other guy.\"\nMayfield's ability to transcend systems works in his favor.\n\"You can see their design,\" a defensive coordinator said of the Bucs. \"You can see the play selection. More of the throws are going outside. I think they are opening his line of vision because he is a smaller guy. That is where I feel like Liam did a good job fitting the system around him.\"\nDak Prescott\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n2 | Retained tier | 2.4(+0.3) |\nPrescott slipped lower in Tiers than at any point since 2019 after missing nine games to injury last season. He still remained solidly within Tier 2.\n\"I'm not necessarily worried about anything when I play him, but he's just solid,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"He will put the ball where it needs to be, he can scramble a little bit. If he has to carry it and throw it 50 times, you'll get him a few times. I think he is still good. I started to 2 slash 3 him, but I think he is a 2.\"\nEntering his 10th year, Prescott has as many seasons leading the league in average annual salary as he has playoff wins (two). Does any long-established QB need a deep postseason run more?\n\"He has proven when it comes to the big games, he can't win,\" another defensive coach said. \"I've had him as a 2 before, but over the years, it is the same thing over and over again.\"\nThe Cowboys infamously have not played in an NFC title game since the 1995 season, the longest drought in the conference. With six starts this season, Prescott will pass Tony Romo for the most by a Dallas quarterback during the drought.\n\"That place is so funny \u2014 it just teeters with disaster,\" an offensive coach said. \"They put the expectations so high, they can never reach them. Dak has been fantastic for what he is. He plays past his draft status all the time. He plays past his physical abilities most of the time. And then it catches up to him when it really matters the most.\"\nJordan Love\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n2 | Retained tier | 2.4(-0.1) |\nLove leveled off after his promising 2024 season, rising one spot in the rankings while his average tier vote improved by only four-hundredths of a point. Knee and groin injuries limited him at times last season.\n\"I do like his accuracy, his athleticism and his arm strength,\" one exec said. \"The vision and processing holds me back a little bit.\"\nOpinions surrounding Love were varied and fascinating.\n\"When we faced him last year, I felt like if you could get to him, you could rattle him,\" a defensive coach said. \"He distributes the ball, and they have big skill (players who are) tough to bring down. That is how he makes his hay. I do not watch him and think, 'Oh, he is f---ing people up.'\"\nAnother coach saw it the other way around, contending the Packers could do more for Love.\n\"Jordan does a great job,\" this coach said. \"He has a mastery of their offense, he handles multiple cadences and tempos well, and if anything, I think his growth is stifled a little by playing the coach's offense as opposed to doing more of what Jordan would excel doing.\"\nA defensive coach also found the Packers' offense interesting.\n\"When we played them, I was like, 'Man, this ball is going downfield \u2014 he don't give a s---,'\" this coach said. \"You don't see a lot of quarterbacks play like that these days. It's almost like they build it into their offense and see the benefits of making you defend the whole field and hitting a couple in exchange for a pick or two.\n\"It was interesting playing him. I came away thinking there is something different about this kid.\"\nLove led the NFL with 35 passes traveling 30 or more yards downfield. His 11 interceptions included throws traveling 34, 21, 14, 13, 13, 13 and 10 yards past the line of scrimmage.\n\"He is like what you wish Geno Smith was,\" an offensive coach said. \"He is a little bit of a gunslinger, and at times it gets him in trouble, but he is more consistently good than bad, where Geno is more toward the middle or back of that. Jordan has the physical talent to get away with it better.\"\nBrock Purdy\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n2 | Retained tier | 2.5(+0.2) |\nPurdy slid slightly, with seven fewer Tier 2 votes than in 2024, but opinions of him have not shifted fundamentally.\n\"He does more on tape than I think a lot of guys can do in terms of the anticipation and accuracy,\" an opposing coach said. \"Yes, it faltered at times. I also got the sense he was playing through some things. But when he is healthy and on, I don't think there are a lot of guys who are at the level he is at.\"\nPurdy leads the NFL in EPA per pass play over the past three seasons. He was fifth in 2024. Tua Tagovailoa also ranks among the top five. Some voters compared the two players as beneficiaries of their environments.\n\"When you play San Fran, you are thinking about (Christian) McCaffrey, you are thinking about (George) Kittle, you are thinking about (Brandon) Aiyuk,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"You know Purdy will get it to them, but you are not necessarily thinking about Purdy. You are facing their defense, all these skill guys, Kyle Shanahan.\"\nThe 49ers' defense fell off last season, and the offense wasn't the same without McCaffrey (Aiyuk also missed 10 games). Purdy could not save them from finishing 6-11.\n\"He's a facilitator for them,\" the defensive coordinator added.\nOne exec said Purdy possesses a conglomeration of winning skills and traits, with nothing special beyond his makeup.\n\"Purdy doesn't get enough credit,\" a head coach said. \"The draft is over, OK? The guy has played his ass off. Recognize that! He is not the last pick in the draft anymore. The guy is one win away from being a 1 for some people, if he won a Super Bowl.\"\nKyler Murray\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n3 | Retained tier | 2.7 |\nMurray has stood almost frozen in Tiers balloting since 2023. This year, Baker Mayfield passed him. Aaron Rodgers, Tua Tagovailoa and Trevor Lawrence slipped below him.\nIs treading water good for a highly paid quarterback stuck atop Tier 3?\n\"I've played him too much, and I still think he's a 3,\" a defensive coach said. \"I don't think he wins it for you in the two-minute drill. If you want to be in the top half of this league, you have to win in the two-minute drill and control it. He does not do that.\"\nAnother defensive coach who faced Murray saw things similarly.\n\"Creates the mismatch with his legs, not his arm,\" this coach said. \"He's Tier 3 with a good-looking baseball slide after his fourth scramble in a two-minute drill.\"\nMurray could use more help. He is one of 32 quarterbacks with at least 25 starts over the past three seasons. None of the 32 has gotten worse support from his defense/special teams on a per-start basis than Murray over that span.\n\"Kyler to me is a tough one,\" an offensive coach said. \"He is probably in that 3 category. You have to have a strong defense. He has not shown an ability to win it on his own.\"\nArizona owes its 14-22 record in Murray's last 36 starts to its defense (-110.4 EPA), not its offense (+41.6 EPA) or its special teams (+0.8 EPA, which is near average).\n\"I think he grew a lot last year,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"He was a problem for sure when we played him. He cut down turnovers, used his legs a lot more, came into his own after the injury.\"\nMurray's efficiency fell off after Week 10.\n\"I still don't trust him,\" a GM said. \"He has 2 talent but is still a 3 to me. Is he committed to it? He always tends to tail off as the season goes on.\"\nAaron Rodgers\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n3 | Dropped 1 tier | 2.8(+1) |\nRodgers' average tier vote plummeted a full point from last year, a drop more than twice as large as for any other player (Daniel Jones fell by nearly one-half tier).\nIt's strange seeing him way down here.\n\"You are hoping for Brett Favre to the Minnesota Vikings, but they had Adrian Peterson, Percy Harvin and a bunch of dudes,\" one exec said.\nThe Steelers acquired receiver DK Metcalf.\n\"Aaron has had good route runners around him when he was at his best,\" a defensive coach said. \"I don't know who the route runner is on that team. Metcalf is like a bully, jump-ball, kill-you-in-the-red-zone guy. Truthfully, I have no idea how that works there.\"\nRodgers' age (41), late arrival to the team (June), lack of history with Pittsburgh's offensive coordinator (Arthur Smith) and recent injury history (torn Achilles in September 2023) are among the factors working against success in Pittsburgh.\n\"Too slow to consistently win with his legs, yet his mind and hard count will have your disguise broken and your D-line in the neutral zone multiple times a game,\" another defensive coach said.\nInitial reports suggest it'll take time for Rodgers and the offense to jell.\n\"They all have to be going into this with eyes wide open,\" an offensive coach said. \"Aaron obviously feels comfortable with Mike (Tomlin) and Arthur. He doesn't need to be No. 1 in the league in passing anymore. He needs to protect the football and throw touchdowns. He can still do that.\"\nThere's a good chance Rodgers will be healthier this year than last, when he was still working his way back from the Achilles injury.\n\"He can still see, and he can still fit balls in there,\" a former head coach said. \"He can't be dynamic like he was \u2014 scrambling, avoiding the rush and throwing it 60 yards down the field \u2014 but I still think he can play.\"\nTua Tagovailoa\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n3 | Retained tier | 2.8(+0.3) |\nThe Dolphins' offense averaged 24.1 points per game in 11 games with Tagovailoa in 2024, compared to 13.3 in six games without him.\n\"They literally cannot operate the offense when he is not out there, and then they are a top-10 offense when he is out there,\" an offensive coach said. \"I don't even like watching him play, but at this point, dude, I can't say you are not that guy.\"\nThat voter was among a dozen placing Tagovailoa in Tier 2, half as many as in 2024.\n\"He is probably a 2 on the production, but if the game is on the line, I'd be scared to death if he were my quarterback,\" an exec said.\nAnother voter called Tagovailoa \"damn near the most accurate quarterback\" in the NFL.\n\"It is the off-script plays that he doesn't have,\" a defensive coach said. \"And if it is not paired with the run game to draw the under coverage, then you don't get full utilization of his accuracy on the second and third level.\"\nThe result is a quarterback who can look really good or really bad, depending on the situation.\n\"He does a really good job of hitting these play-action windows and putting it on guys where it's catch-and-run and has good anticipation for it and can get it out of his hands,\" another defensive coach said. \"I have yet to see him carry his team when they are not clicking in other phases. Has Miami ever won where their run game is getting killed, they can't hit play-action stuff and it's just time for Tua to sling the ball?\"\nTrevor Lawrence\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n3 | Retained tier | 2.8(+0.2) |\nLawrence peaked in Tier 2 entering the 2023 season. He's fallen each of the past two years, with only flickering hope among voters that he'll ever challenge for Tier 1.\n\"I thought he would be better,\" a head coach said, \"but he just isn't naturally accurate.\"\nInjuries were a big factor last season.\n\"I always thought Lawrence was a unique talent from a body-type standpoint \u2014 so athletic for a guy that tall \u2014 and the way he played at Clemson was outstanding,\" another head coach said. \"But when I watched him this year (2024), the instinct wasn't as high there. He looked hesitant. He had some ugly tape.\"\nThe Jaguars are betting that improved health and new coach Liam Coen can help Lawrence get back to where he stood entering 2023, when he ranked eighth in Tiers voting and commanded 36 votes in the top two tiers. A coach impressed by Lawrence two years ago questioned how well the QB was seeing coverages after the snap in 2024.\n\"He hasn't proved that he can take the team up a level or make the team play better than they are,\" a former GM said. \"I definitely think Liam Coen can help him if he is able to be helped.\"\nA defensive coach who has faced Lawrence multiple times, including in 2024, didn't see anything special.\n\"He has missed a bunch of schemed-up shots (downfield),\" this coach said. \"There is nothing that scares you about the kid. How is he beating you unless he happens to hit on some of those deep ones? I don't know how much of that is scheme versus what he does and cannot do. There is nothing elite about him from a big-picture standpoint.\"\nGeno Smith\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n3 | Retained tier | 2.9(-0.1) |\nSmith, making his third consecutive appearance in Tier 3, inched up to a career-best 2.90 average. But this was more a case of Smith receiving fewer votes in Tier 4 than it was about him commanding more votes in Tier 2.\n\"Geno is pretty good at everything, but nothing stands out as an elite trait,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"There is not one X-Man power where you are like f---, this guy.\"\nFor a player whose average grade is in the middle, there's considerable variance in opinions on Smith.\n\"He has as good of arm talent as anyone, he is accurate and he has won games where he was the reason in some of those fourth-quarter victories and shootouts,\" an offensive coordinator said. \"He has had some struggles, too. What prevents him from being in that elite level? In the games that are really, really hard, he has not overcome those, although they did beat San Francisco this past year.\"\nAnother coordinator polled his staff, reporting that the room was split on whether Smith belonged in Tier 2 or 3. One person whose confidence in Smith has never wavered: Pete Carroll, the coach who revived Smith's career in Seattle and brought him to Las Vegas.\n\"I think he's a 2 because when the game is on the line, he can make the throws to win,\" a head coach said. \"He stands in there. Guys that can stand in there, take hits when the game is on the line, whether it's third down or two-minute, those guys are legit.\"\nThis coach placed Smith among the NFL's top 10 or 15 in two-minute proficiency, lauding him for his play over the years in shootouts against Detroit and Dallas.\nOthers see Smith as a quarterback whose team will always be looking to upgrade, with one defensive coordinator suggesting Smith doesn't solve post-snap coverage rotations quickly enough, leading to turnovers and negative plays.\n\"He is a game manager who is going to turn the ball over and can't carry it,\" a coach with multiple games against Smith said. \"Even when the team is good, you are always going to feel like we don't quite have the guy.\"\nBo Nix\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n3 | New to Tiers | 3 |\nNix, the sixth quarterback selected in the 2024 draft, ranks second among them to Washington's Daniels heading into the group's second season.\n\"He looks pretty sharp, he knows where to go with the ball, he runs better than you think, he throws better than you think,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"He looks like he is a good competitor who makes people around him better. That is what your quarterback has to do.\"\nOne GM whose team was not in the market to draft a quarterback said Nix was much better than he anticipated. He thought Nix would be a \"dink-and-dunk\" quarterback.\n\"I think the biggest strength is he is very mobile and can keep his eyes down the field when he's moving,\" an offensive coach said. \"He made big plays on the move. That being said, I'm being generous with the 2. Now you have people with tape on him. The one thing I know about Sean (Payton), he is no fool. He is going to get players in there. They should not have a shortage of playmakers.\"\nThe fit in Denver appears excellent.\n\"He was fortunate having a strong system and a strong defense,\" a former GM said. \"If he has a chance to be more, it is because that system really fits him well.\"\nAnother former GM said there's nothing surprising about Nix's early success.\n\"He's got processing, he's got vision and he's got accuracy,\" this ex-GM said. \"He is definitely going to win. He has a chance to elevate.\"\nOne coach predicted the hierarchy of the 2024 quarterback draft class would change over the next couple of years, like some other classes have recently. Could Nix overtake Daniels?\n\"What we are going to see is Sean Payton's ability to develop a quarterback relative to Kliff Kingsbury's ability to do that,\" this coach said. \"Both players appear to be dialed into the profession of quarterbacking \u2014 taking care of the body, coming in early, leaving late, being all about ball. I'm interested in seeing who is able to grow the most this coming year. I actually think Bo Nix is going to win out in that.\"\nSam Darnold\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n3 | Jumped 1 tier | 3(-1) |\nThe Seahawks swapped out Geno Smith for the younger, less expensive Darnold.\nDid they upgrade?\n\"I think Geno operates at a higher level, especially in critical moments,\" an offensive coach said. \"Sam's two-minute stuff versus Geno's two-minute stuff, that is where Geno separates himself.\"\nDarnold outdueled Smith in Seattle last season, tossing three touchdown passes, including the game-winner in the final four minutes, as Minnesota beat the Seahawks. Darnold had no interceptions. Smith had two.\n\"Sam, when you put the pieces around him, has as higher ceiling,\" another voter said. \"This is wild to say, but Geno is maybe better if your team is bad. Sam is better if your team is good.\"\nSmith could be the higher-variance player, by this way of thinking.\n\"Geno can look great, and you can win a game you should not win, but you are also going to lose two or three against teams that are the same as you because he throws a pick in the end zone, plays blind, doesn't see it,\" the voter added. \"Sam, when the team is bad, you are going to feel like, f---, this guy is limited, and we cannot overcome it. But when your team is good, you are going to operate really well.\"\nOthers think Darnold is well-suited to play in offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak's system, partly because of his familiarity with it. But there is no consensus yet that Seattle has found a long-term successor to Smith.\n\"I think Sam starts one year, and they go with the young kid,\" an exec said, referring to 2025 third-round pick Jalen Milroe.\nDarnold's poor finish with the Vikings lingered in the minds of voters.\n\"I like Darnold, but the end of the season killed me,\" one said.\nDrake Maye\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n3 | New to Tiers | 3.1 |\nMaye, the third quarterback drafted in the 2024 class, checks in third among the group here, behind Daniels and Nix.\n\"Daniels and Nix went into a helluva lot better situations than Drake did,\" an offensive coach said. \"(Maye) is a big athlete that has good vision, can push the ball up the field, he can run, I think he's coachable. Josh (McDaniels) does a good job of eliminating negative plays with a quarterback, so I think that will help him.\"\nMaye took 32 sacks and suffered 10 interceptions in 12 starts. He barely played in two of the three starts that New England won, exiting one with an injury (the Patriots rested him after one series in Week 18).\n\"Drake turned the ball over a lot, he got injured and had a concussion,\" another coach said. \"But it was tough what they were doing offensively under Jerod Mayo.\"\nA defensive coach whose team faced Maye pushed back against some of the early excitement.\n\"I remember coming out of our game, and people were like, 'Oh, we saw the future,' and I'm like, 'I don't know about that; he made about three throws,'\" this coach said. \"Let's not Winston Wolf it yet.\"\nThe situation around Maye led some to punt on firm evaluations.\n\"His team was so bad,\" an offensive coordinator said. \"Vince Lombardi couldn't have gotten that team any more wins than they got. Maye has promise. There is talent. There is ability. I think he looked very natural at the position.\"\nA head coach said he thought Maye's physical stature made him a good fit for the weather in New England. Voters generally thought Maye could become a 2.\n\"The person and the leadership and the ability to run made him good as a rookie,\" another offensive coordinator said. \"He can ascend pretty quick if he can start to hit progressions.\"\nCaleb Williams\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n3 | New to Tiers | 3.2 |\nWilliams entered the 2024 draft as the consensus No. 1 quarterback. He enters his second season facing questions about his ability to process and play quickly after taking 68 sacks, third-most in NFL history.\n\"I think that will come in time,\" a GM said. \"Maybe it is a little bit like Josh (Allen) early in his career, where he has so much good other stuff that you will live with some negative plays, and as he gets more snaps under his belt, that part will come.\"\nMost evaluations reflected some skepticism.\n\"He's got the talent to go up, but in terms of processing ability and getting the ball out of his hands, it was the worst we played against,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"He just holds the ball forever. I'm thinking, 'The ball should go right there! Throw it! Throw it!' And he did not throw it.\"\nVoter after voter raised the same concerns.\n\"He is definitely a 1 talent,\" a head coach said. \"I just think it's going to take him longer than Jayden Daniels. He is not playing fast right now. There is something there. His processing to me was alarming watching the tape.\"\nSome thought new coach Ben Johnson would have to adjust expectations accordingly.\n\"You saw signs and ability, and I also think you saw signs and ability that scare you,\" another coach said. \"Nervousness in the pocket, inability to see and play on time. But I do not know yet if that was him or coaching. Parts of me wondered if you could get it done with this guy, but it's good enough to make you think you have a chance.\"\nVoters aren't necessarily betting against Williams, but they aren't betting on him, either.\n\"He's very talented,\" another defensive coordinator said. \"Ben is more under center. Caleb is more of a gun quarterback. That dynamic is going to be interesting to me. I would not be shocked if the kid plays well. Ben is good. He can adjust. I'm sure they will find a happy medium somewhere.\"\nBryce Young\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n3 | Jumped 1 tier | 3.4(-0.4) |\nThe Panthers ranked 14th in offensive points per game in the 10-game stretch after Young returned to the lineup in Week 8. They were 32nd across his 10 previous starts.\nThere was clearly improvement. What does it mean?\n\"Don't get fooled by the final games of a season when you are out of it and the teams you are playing are out of it,\" a veteran coach said. \"That is where his production came from. Everyone is excited about it. Now, you start the season over again, you are playing teams that are game-planning seriously, that have a lot to play for, and it's different.\"\nAn executive from an AFC team cast the lone Tier 2 vote for Young.\n\"I think he has taken that step,\" this exec said. \"He has learned to play at his size in the National Football League. He was a drop away from beating Philly. If he comes back in with that same type of play, which I think he will with the same coach and coordinator, you will see better, more consistent play.\"\nMost voters questioned how much better Young could get, suggesting the top of Tier 3 could be his ceiling.\n\"I was watching him in pregame, and I'm like, 'The ball does not jump off his hand very well, and he's small,'\" a defensive coordinator said. \"I just don't know if there's enough talent to really become a 2, to be honest.\"\nSome thought Carolina could get Tier 2 production from Young with a better supporting cast.\n\"The environment around him was better when he got reinserted to the starting lineup, which was huge, and then (Dave) Canales stopped calling the game with handcuffs,\" a GM said. \"He was super conservative, and then Bryce has to be in third-and-long the whole game. He's a great kid, so I want him to be successful. I'm optimistic. I would put him in 3, and then we'll see how far he can go from there.\"\nKirk Cousins\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n3 | Dropped 1 tier | 3.5(+1.1) |\nCousins is included in QB Tiers in case he lands elsewhere as the Falcons transition to Michael Penix Jr. as their starter.\n\"I look at Rodgers and Kirk Cousins similarly, as older players coming off the Achilles,\" an offensive coach said. \"If Cousins were starting in Atlanta, I would say Kirk would have a bounce-back year. I think Aaron will bounce back. Both will be healthier, and if that's the case, we will see the arm talent more.\"\nVoters suspected Falcons ownership was reluctant to trade Cousins after the team invested so much in him.\n\"He is probably in that 4 category right now, because where is he at physically?\" an offensive coach said. \"Is he starting to deteriorate so much? He should be a 2 if healthy. I just do not know if that is where he is at right now.\"\nVoters found Cousins' immobility striking last season.\n\"The things they did to keep him clean in the past, he could not do,\" a defensive coordinator said, referring to formations and plays putting the quarterback on the move.\nCousins peaked in QB Tiers last year with 31 Tier 2 votes and a 2.38 average, both career bests. He set career lows in 2025.\n\"His arm strength was not great and has fallen off a little more,\" a former GM said. \"I think that affected his confidence. Is that the injury, or is that him declining?\"\nRussell Wilson\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n4 | Dropped 1 tier | 3.6(+0.4) |\nWilson, now on his third team in three seasons, has fallen in the Tiers rankings from tied for first (2020) to fourth (2021), eighth (2022), 16th (2023), 22nd (2024) and 26th (2025).\n\"If you are a quarterback who has to create time \u2014 instead of one who knows where everything is, hits his back foot and throws it \u2014 then this is what happens to you,\" a defensive coach said.\nGiants coach Brian Daboll has repeatedly said Wilson is the starter entering the season. The fact that Daboll needs to make such declarations reflects Wilson's tenuous status.\n\"He has pelts on the wall for two-minute offense, and you have to give him credit for that,\" a head coach said. \"I think he is a legitimate starter. I wish he would play better, but he's been in three offenses in the last three years. You know how that goes.\"\nPete Carroll, Sean Payton and Mike Tomlin all decided to move on from Wilson in recent years.\n\"What he had that was magical about him \u2014 the ability to create plays on the move \u2014 is gone,\" a defensive coordinator said.\nWilson's time as a full-season starter might be ending.\n\"He can still do some things, but I think he is just declining. Some of the throws he was good at are not there for him anymore,\" another defensive coordinator said. \"I did not feel like he was ripping throws. Even his deep throws were like airball stuff, hoping George Pickens makes a play.\"\nJustin Fields\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n4 | Retained tier | 3.7(+0.1) |\nFields peaked among Tiers voters as a low 3 entering 2023. His average tier vote entering 2025 (3.74) is about what it was after his 2021 rookie season (3.72). The difference is that Fields has played enough to make it tougher for voters to envision meaningful growth.\n\"(The Jets) know who he is, what he is, and they are going to try to structure things for him,\" an offensive coach said. \"The problem is, the hardest thing to fix with a quarterback is keeping their eyes up the field, seeing the field and not being affected by the rush. And those are three of the worst things that he does.\"\nThe Steelers started 4-2 with Fields in the lineup last season. They ranked 20th in offensive EPA per play to that point in the season, while ranking fifth in combined EPA on defense and special teams.\nThat formula could work for the Jets.\n\"This is another guy who, in the pure-pass world, you say probably not,\" a head coach said, \"but you put him in Tier 3 because he is the run game, probably, and then on top of that, the Jets are hopefully going to play good defense. If they put together an RPO play-action system, this guy could easily be a really positive thing for them.\"\nFields' ability to run and his limitations as a passer lock in the Jets for one style of play.\n\"At the end of the third quarter, you will be down 8-10 points,\" another offensive coach said. \"Great, you kept it close. Now, what?\"\nMichael Penix Jr.\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n4 | New to Tiers | 3.8 |\nPenix started three games late in his rookie season. It wasn't much to go on.\n\"I would make him a 3 because, small sample size, but I thought the guy played really well in that two-minute drill against Washington,\" an offensive coach said. \"How you play in two-minute is the X-factor for quarterbacks in the NFL. For a young guy, he went in there, and he was slinging it. I think you can win with him and a healthy run game.\"\nGetting the first-team reps this offseason should help.\n\"His poise, his arm strength made a difference,\" an exec said. \"He can make a lot more throws than Kirk (Cousins) could make (last season). His decision-making was really good. His accuracy was spotty at times, but outside of that, he finished strong. He gives you hope.\"\nA former GM thought Penix needed better vertical weapons.\n\"If he had that, and if he were playing for Bruce Arians, it would be awesome,\" this former GM said.\nJ.J. McCarthy\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n4 | New to Tiers | 4 |\nMcCarthy drew all Tier 4 votes because he has yet to play in an NFL game, not because voters are necessarily down on him.\n\"I would have hope for him with that coach and that system if he can stay healthy,\" a former GM said. \"He has that slight build. He looked pretty good in the (2024) preseason, in a short period of time. I believe in the head coach and the system. He has the arm strength, he is athletic, he is smart, he has all those things.\"\nPlaying indoors could be another plus, a head coach said.\n\"I just hope he is not an (injury-prone) guy,\" this coach said.\nThere's a perception among some voters that Minnesota had reservations about McCarthy this offseason.\n\"I don't just hear slam dunk stuff out of there,\" the head coach said.\nMcCarthy was back on the field for Saturday's preseason opener after recovering from the torn meniscus he suffered in his right knee last preseason. He had surgery to repair the meniscus in August 2024 and another procedure in November to reduce swelling in the knee.\n\"How healthy is he going to be?\" another coach said. \"They are only doing one joint camp, with New England. He plays on Monday night at Chicago to open the season. I'm pretty interested to see what that looks like.\"\nDaniel Jones\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n4 | Retained tier | 4(+0.4) |\nVoters overwhelmingly thought Jones would win the starting job in Indy. That said much about his primary competition, Anthony Richardson, who ranked ahead of only Spencer Rattler and Kenny Pickett in Tiers voting this year and then dislocated his pinkie finger in the preseason opener.\n\"I get nervous with Jones,\" an offensive coach said. \"I understand if you are not very good on offense and cannot protect, there will plays when you look bad, but there are too many times where he has a guy wide open and he throws it in the dirt or 10 feet over his head. I just don't think he is naturally accurate, and I did not think he was in college.\"\nJones had 10 touchdown passes and 13 interceptions over the past two seasons with the Giants. Richardson has 11 and 13 for Indy over the same span.\n\"A couple years ago, Jones was probably worthy of being a 3,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"He still might be that. He has to show it.\"\nAn offensive coach with NFC East experience thought Jones, who carried the ball on designed runs a career-high 10 percent of the time last season, has been miscast.\n\"Why keep running this guy?\" the coach asked. \"He can do it, but he's f---ing 6-5. He takes hits. He doesn't have that slither at the end of those runs.\"\nA defensive coordinator said he thought Jones could be like the 2024 version of Darnold with a defense, running game and the right coordinator. But concerns over Jones' ability to process linger.\nJoe Flacco\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n4 | New to Tiers | 4.1 |\nFlacco is making his first QB Tiers appearance since 2021. Voters are slightly higher on him now, at age 40, than they were back then, at 36.\n\"He's still playing?\" a defensive coordinator asked.\nFlacco is the favorite to start in Week 1, with Kenny Pickett limited by a hamstring injury and the two rookie draft choices, Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders, working in the background.\n\"I respect him, particularly in that scheme,\" another defensive coordinator said of Flacco. \"He pairs well with what (Kevin) Stefanski wants to do.\"\nLittle-known fact: Flacco has a higher completion rate, yards per attempt and passer rating over the past two seasons than he had in his career previously.\n\"Flacco has no regard for ball security, so you don't know when he is going to throw into a crowd,\" an offensive coach said. \"He's going to make some throws because of that, but he's also going to have bad plays and turnovers.\"\nFlacco's two pick sixes for Cleveland in the playoffs after the 2023 season come to mind as examples.\n\"I think Joe is a good backup,\" a third defensive coordinator said.\nAnthony Richardson\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n4 | Retained tier | 4.2(+0.4) |\nAn overwhelming majority of voters expected Daniel Jones to beat out Richardson for the job, well before Richardson dislocated his right pinkie finger on a sack in the preseason opener. Faith in Richardson's long-term development has cratered, with 11 voters placing him in Tier 5, reserved for players who should not start at all.\n\"I think it is a pipe dream right now, based on what I have seen, to say he is a starter in the NFL,\" an exec said. \"The accuracy is not there. If you want to do college football RPO-type stuff, that is your guy. But some of the stuff last year was not starter quality.\"\nVoters remain mystified by Richardson's decision to briefly exit a Week 8 game at Houston because he was too \"tired\" to stay on the field.\n\"That is a tough one to overcome,\" a head coach said. \"If you can, more power to ya.\"\nThe decision showed zero feel for the quarterback's leadership role on a team.\n\"He's a freaky athlete for his size, but he's been hurt every year because of it,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"Unless he is rearing back and throwing the ball as far as he can and somebody runs underneath it, he's not accurate and can't make any of those throws.\"\nRichardson has completed 50.6 percent of his career passes. He has completed more than 10 passes in a game seven times in 15 starts.\n\"They are not ready to say that they f---ed up, but they are hedging,\" a defensive coach said.\nThe manner in which Richardson injured his finger \u2014 turning to throw left when he had an unblocked rusher coming from the right \u2014 was telling for some.\n\"The Anthony Richardson experiment is over,\" one voter said.\nSpencer Rattler\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n4 | New to Tiers | 4.3 |\nRattler, who started six games as a fifth-round rookie in 2024, appears in Tiers this year in case New Orleans does not go with second-round rookie Tyler Shough. (Jake Haener has also rotated in with the Saints' first-teamers but is not considered a serious contender to start.)\n\"You watch Rattler play against Tampa Bay in his first game, then watch him play against Tampa Bay in his last game, I mean, there was a lot to love there,\" the lone voter placing Rattler in Tier 3 said. \"He improved. I thought Rattler definitely had a chance to be a starter.\"\nThe Saints went 0-6 and averaged 10.8 points per game on offense with Rattler in the lineup last season. They were 5-5 with a 24.8-point average when Derek Carr started.\n\"I saw Rattler \u2014 he's up and down,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"Not real high on him.\"\nKenny Pickett\n'25 Tier | Change from '24 | Vote Avg. |\n|---|---|---|\n5 | New to Tiers | 4.6 |\nPickett and Ben Roethlisberger combined to start 38 games for the Steelers when Matt Canada was the team's offensive coordinator. The offense averaged slightly more yards per play (4.9 to 4.8) and EPA per play (-0.05 to -0.06) in the 22 games Pickett started than in the 16 games Roethlisberger started.\n\"Sometimes, guys just get into bad situations, so you really don't know what they are,\" a defensive coordinator said. \"That is why sometimes you see guys go somewhere else and you say, 'Hey, the guy can play a little bit.' They can all play if they are drafted in the first round. Do they get in the right system?\"\nPickett has made 22 of his 25 career starts so far with Canada as his offensive coordinator. Canada's only NFL job was with the Steelers from 2020 to '23. He has not coached since.\n\"I liked Pickett coming out of college, but he really collapses in the pocket, he doesn't like to get people around him,\" an offensive coach said.\nPickett has been limited in camp and missed the preseason opener as he recovers from a hamstring injury. He's competing with Joe Flacco and rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders for the starting job in a Browns offense that ranked last in EPA per play over the past two seasons.\n\"I was never a big Pickett guy,\" another defensive coordinator said. \"When they had success against us, it was because of their run game and defense.\"\nThe Rankings and Tiers series is sponsored by E*Trade from Morgan Stanley.

      "text": "NFL preseason performances have to be taken with a grain of salt. Unlike the regular season, few coaches game plan for their opponents, and teams run their base plays. Some players shine in preseason, only to look like they don\u2019t even belong in the league in the regular season.\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t learn anything from watching preseason film; we just shouldn\u2019t overreact to it. The four high-profile rookie quarterbacks (Cam Ward, Jaxson Dart, Tyler Shough and Shedeur Sanders) made their debuts in the first batch of preseason action and mostly looked good. Here\u2019s what we learned from the young signal callers and what they need to improve on.\nCam Ward\nThe Tennessee Titans\u2019 top pick looked like he was back at Miami, sitting back in the pocket, as relaxed as he was on the beach \u2014 only he was playing against Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Todd Bowles\u2019 pressure scheme. Defenses are usually vanilla during the preseason, but even early installation plays for the Bucs involve sending a second-level player or two at the quarterback. One reason to be optimistic that Ward can have early success is that the Titans are going into their second year under offensive line savant Bill Callahan. The offensive line looked sound fundamentally and schematically, easily picking up blitzes and giving Ward time to throw downfield.\nAdvertisement\nThe most impressive part about Ward\u2019s debut was that he threw the ball mostly on time, though he could throw it a tick or two earlier at times, while still being aggressive. He had some longer-developing plays called and often threw after one or two hitches and still averaged a robust 11.1 air yards per throw. He converted a third-and-6 and third-and-9, both within the structure of the offense, and displayed the ability to zip in passes and layer passes when necessary. He nearly threw an interception on a go ball with which he had to balance throwing with pace to beat the safety but with touch to get the ball over the cornerback. He didn\u2019t put enough touch on it, and the cornerback got his hands on the pass. However, it was the right idea and a good learning experience for him to understand what it takes to complete that pass in the NFL.\nSecond quarter, 13:12 remaining, second-and-10\nWard used the hard count to get the Buccaneers defense to show its hand. Linebacker Deion Jones (No. 45) inched toward the line of scrimmage, which told Ward and the Titans offensive line that he was going to blitz.\nThis meant one of the safeties would have to rotate down to cover the tight end, and the Buccaneers would man blitz. Ward knew Calvin Ridley would have the entire middle of the field to work with on his crossing route.\nIdeally, Ward would let the ball rip to Ridley here, but he took an extra step on his drop before throwing. This is an example of where he could clean up his feet.\nBecause of the extra step, he was pressured but still delivered a perfect pass to Ridley for a 13-yard pass.\nIt was a short sample, but Ward looked comfortable and displayed the natural feel for the game that made him the NFL Draft\u2019s top pick.\nJaxson Dart\nDart has the longest developmental arc of the four quarterbacks on this list, which is why the New York Giants signed Russell Wilson \u2014 to give the rookie time to sit and develop. Sunday, the Giants did a good job of simplifying things for Dart, and he executed consistently. However, he left some meat on the bone with a few inaccurate passes. Like in college, Dart was fearless in the face of pressure, which was evident on his touchdown pass.\nSecond quarter, 12:06 remaining, second-and-5\nHere, Dart saw the Buffalo Bills\u2019 safeties rotate, meaning the defense was in Cover 1 (man-to-man with one deep safety).\nDart knew he had a chance to attack downfield, so he signaled to receiver Lil\u2019Jordan Humphrey to run a \u201cgo\u201d route.\nGiants right guard Jake Kubas whiffed on his block, but Dart didn\u2019t flinch, stepped into the throw and delivered a perfect pass.\nJAXSON DART FIRST TD PASS IN THE NFL.\nLil'Jordan Humphrey on the other end!\nWatch on @NFLNetwork\nStream on @NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/afUQ8Ijt59\u2014 NFL (@NFL) August 9, 2025\nDart attacked the single-receiver side on three-by-one formations, hit some screens that became explosive plays and showed off his athleticism on scrambles, which Giants fans should be excited about. We\u2019ll see if the Giants decide to add more to his plate in the preseason, but they seem intent on sticking with the plans regardless of the flash plays he makes this preseason.\nTyler Shough\nThe New Orleans Saints\u2019 rookie signal caller had a rough outing against a well-coached Los Angeles Chargers defense. Shough got his first snap with 1:38 left in the first half and instantly had to operate a two-minute drill. He missed on a potential touchdown throw in which receiver Kevin Austin Jr. got open on a double move, but ultimately got the Saints into field goal position. Shough mostly threw underneath \u2014 45.5 percent of his throws were under 5 air yards, and 36.4 percent were at or behind the line of scrimmage. He had some opportunities to throw to the intermediate part of the field but didn\u2019t pull the trigger.\nHis biggest issue was staring down his receivers. He rarely moved his eyes, which led to a pick six in the third quarter.\nChargers rookie Eric Rogers intercepts the pass for a Pick-6!\nWatch on @NFLNetwork\nStream on @NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/muotymCVoy\u2014 NFL (@NFL) August 10, 2025\nYou want to see a 25-year-old play with more poise and nuance, but we won\u2019t put too much stock into 30 preseason snaps.\nShedeur Sanders\nSanders was decisive and accurate and mostly made good decisions. The Cleveland Browns didn\u2019t score against the Carolina Panthers\u2019 starting defense, but that should be expected, as Sanders was at a disadvantage, playing with the Browns\u2019 backups. But again, he made the throws that were there, and he avoided turnovers. There were a few times when he held on to the ball and retreated too far backward. One of those plays was a fourth-and-1 in which you might as well try to make something happen; however, he ran backward about 10 yards, which is a cardinal sin.\nAdvertisement\nHe managed to barely throw the ball away, but the lesson for him on that play was not to make a bad situation worse by setting up your defense in a worse field position if you don\u2019t convert the fourth down. On a sack in the third quarter, the Panthers sent a safety blitz from depth, and Sanders had plenty of time to throw the ball away but took a sack. These plays are notable because they littered his college film and were one of the big reasons he dropped in the draft. He mostly made quick decisions and threw the ball in the middle of the field with timing and accuracy, but he passed up on some wide-open receivers as well.\nSecond quarter, 1:10 remaining, first-and-10\nOn Sanders\u2019 second touchdown pass, he had a full-field progression, starting with a two-man stick concept to his left.\nSanders didn\u2019t like what he saw on the stick side. The Panthers sent an inside linebacker blitz, which running back Ahmani Marshall picked up from across the formation.\nSanders stepped away from the pressure while keeping his eyes on his third read. The free safety drove on the inside post.\nAs the play was designed to do, the outside post opened up, and Sanders zipped in a perfect pass.\nShedeur Sanders to Kaden Davis AGAIN for the TD!\nCLEvsCAR on @NFLNetwork\nStream on @NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/9ucfAJiMNY\u2014 NFL (@NFL) August 9, 2025\nSanders made the most of his opportunity and was impressive. Reportedly, it took some time for him to learn coach Kevin Stefanski\u2019s playbook, terminology and overall operation, but he looked poised and should earn more of an opportunity to run with the ones or twos in the coming weeks.\n(Top photo: Mike Ehrmann / Getty Images)"

      "text": "FLORHAM PARK, N.J. \u2014 Once upon a time, Giants and Jets joint practices brought a little feistiness, the kind that saw Jeremy Shockey trying to take on half the Jets roster, and Tom Coughlin yelling at Jets defensive coordinator Donnie Henderson. They\u2019d take shots at each other in the press, and talk trash on the field.\nAdvertisement\nThe teams met again on Tuesday, and it was \u2026 mostly pleasant. There were a couple of moments \u2014 Jets defensive tackle Phidarian Mathis got into it with some Giants offensive players during 11-on-11 drills \u2014 but otherwise there wasn\u2019t a whole lot of drama. It was a straightforward football practice where the defenses, for the most part, won the day against offenses with some question marks.\nOften, it\u2019s easy to walk out of joint practices with a good feeling about which team is (or will be) better. Tuesday felt fairly even. Wednesday\u2019s joint practice will take place at the Giants\u2019 facility in East Rutherford.\nHere are some observations from Tuesday\u2019s practice that stood out to me from a Jets perspective\u2026\nJustin Fields, playing it safe\nThere\u2019s an obvious aspect to the Jets offense: They will lean on the run. As I\u2019ve said, it would not surprise me if the Jets led the NFL in rush attempts this year, after coming in last with a year ago. And the Jets showed what that might look like during Saturday\u2019s preseason game against the Packers.\nBut something I\u2019ve noticed, especially recently, is that the Jets seem to mostly be playing it safe in the passing game \u2014 or at least Fields has been. If the Jets tracked air yards in practice, Fields\u2019 number would be low; it\u2019s been a lot of quick slants, dump-offs, screens and the occasional throw to the intermediate area. There haven\u2019t been many shots taken down the field \u2014 and that was true on Tuesday too. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, just something I\u2019ve had my eye on, curious to see if the Jets are going to limit the amount of risk Fields takes on. It was an \u201cup and down\u201d day for Fields on Tuesday, head coach Aaron Glenn said \u2014 and I would agree with that assessment.\nHe was solid during seven-on-seven drills, completing seven passes in a row, and the eighth pass only fell incomplete on a nice breakup by Giants safety Jevon Holland, intended for Josh Reynolds. The first run of seven-on-seven included a perfectly executed wheel route by running back Braelon Allen, and Fields did a good job of selling that he was going to throw it to the opposite side of the field before turning at the last second and connecting with Allen.\nAdvertisement\nIn 11-on-11, Fields connected on a perfect throw on the move to Tyler Johnson at the sideline, who made the catch with two defenders nearby \u2014 though Fields might have been lit up for a sack by Abdul Carter if the defense was allowed to hit. Fields completed his first five passes in 11-on-11, then wasn\u2019t as successful for a stretch. He had a pass batted down at the line of scrimmage, was sacked at least two or three times, missed Johnson on a slant, threw an incomplete pass intended for Garrett Wilson and threw the ball away as Dexter Lawrence chased him.\nIn red zone 11-on-11 drills, it looked like Fields might have been sacked on the first play by Brian Burns, though he did complete the pass to Breece Hall. He closed out the day with a perfect side-arm laser to Jeremy Ruckert in the back of the end zone for a touchdown.\nAll told, I had Fields completing 7 of 12 passes in 11-on-11 drills and 7 of 8 during seven-on-seven \u2014 including three straight passes to Garrett Wilson at one point.\nMason Taylor is back\nThe rookie tight end missed a little over a week with a high ankle sprain, which can often knock players out for much longer than that. Taylor picked up right where he left up on Tuesday, catching a few passes from Fields but really standing out on a sliding catch he made on a pass from Adrian Martinez. Glenn raved about that grab after practice, calling the play \u201coutstanding,\u201d highlighting the way Taylor was able to maneuver his feet to stay inbounds.\n\u201cThose are the things I expect from him in the passing game,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing new. He just has to make sure that he comes along at the right pace so we don\u2019t re-injure that ankle again, but he\u2019s a fighter. He wants to be out there \u2026 I thought he had a hell of a day.\u201d\nO-Line battles\nThe starting offensive line had a dominant performance against the Packers on Saturday, and they flashed some of that on Tuesday. Though the Giants\u2019 pass rush will give even the best of offensive lines some trouble, and it did that on Tuesday. It doesn\u2019t get much more fearsome than the trio of Burns, Carter and Lawrence, and all wreaked their own level of havoc \u2014 Burns, in particular, was moving around the formation and giving trouble to rookie tackle Armand Membou. Carter bowled over center Joe Tippmann for a sack at one point.\nAdvertisement\nOlu Fashanu, to his credit, held his own against Kayvon Thibodeaux both in the run game and pass game. Fashanu has been one of the Jets\u2019 best and most consistent players throughout the summer. Carter also had his way with the Jets\u2019 backup offensive line, beating left tackle Max Mitchell for a sack at one point.\nDefensive dominance\nThe way the Jets\u2019 practice field is set up, reporters essentially have to choose whether they want to watch the Jets offense versus the Giants defense, or the Jets defense versus the Giants offense (at least until the scrimmage period at the end of practice). I opted to watch Fields and the offense \u2014 but reporter accounts on the other side indicated that the Jets defense was dominant, especially against Russell Wilson. Micheal Clemons and Jay Tufele \u2014 building on a stellar preseason performance \u2014 both had sacks, and Wilson struggled to complete passes against the Jets secondary.\nI did see the Jets defense in red-zone drills and they were a little less effective in that area \u2014 Wilson hit tight end Theo Johnson in double coverage in the back of the end zone, beating Andre Cisco and Tony Adams. Then Wilson beat Adams again on a touchdown to Darius Slayton a few plays later.\nBanged up \u2014 but getting healthier\nThe Jets got some good news and some not-so-good news on the injury front on Tuesday. The good: Taylor, defensive tackle Quinnen Williams, guard John Simpson, wide receiver Xavier Gipson and defensive end Jermaine Johnson all returned to practice. This was Johnson\u2019s first practice since being activated off PUP \u2014 the Jets are easing him back into things even though, as Johnson said, he feels ready to be a full-go.\nOn the flip side: Quarterback Tyrod Taylor had his knee scoped and, Glenn said, he\u2019ll miss the rest of the preseason but is expected to be ready for Week 1. Wide receiver Allen Lazard (shoulder) will miss a couple weeks. Running back Isaiah Davis (ankle) sat out Tuesday\u2019s practice, as did defensive tackle Byron Cowart (ankle). Quarterback Brady Cook hurt his ankle and limped off the field on Tuesday but Glenn said he\u2019ll be fine. That leaves the Jets with only two healthy quarterbacks, in Fields and Martinez.\nMiscellaneous observations\n\u2022 Wide receiver Brandon Smith continues to make plays with the backups as he pushes for a roster spot. He made a nice diving catch on a Brady Cook pass during team drills.\n\u2022 Same goes for wide receiver Jamaal Pritchett, who is pushing Gipson as a returner too. He made multiple impressive catches in team drills, though he did muff one punt, the first time he\u2019s done so in camp. The undrafted rookie still has a shot to stick though.\n\u2022 Defensive tackle Leonard Taylor III \u2014 another standout from Saturday \u2014 had a dominant one-on-one rep against Giants offensive lineman Jimmy Morrissey, which hyped up the Jets entire defensive line group. He\u2019s feeling safer and safer for the 53 as camp progresses.\n(Photo: Ishika Samant / Getty Images)"

      "text": "Let the New York Giants\u2019 quarterback controversy commence!\nOK, not really. But the preseason is the time for overreaction, and rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart\u2019s debut was encouraging enough to allow Giants fans to dream about the future.\nDart looked sharp in Saturday\u2019s 34-25 preseason-opening win over the Buffalo Bills, completing 12 of 19 passes for 154 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions. The first-round pick added 24 yards on three carries.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt\u2019s about what I thought he would do,\u201d coach Brian Daboll said. \u201cEfficient, effective, aggressive, confident in the pocket.\u201d\nDart\u2019s debut won\u2019t make the Giants scrap their plan to open the season with 14th-year veteran Russell Wilson as their starting quarterback. However, it\u2019s clear that one performance \u2014 albeit in the preseason, mostly against Bills backups \u2014 strengthened the strong internal feelings about Dart.\nDaboll was uncharacteristically effusive in his praise of Dart before adding disclaimers that it was only one game. It\u2019s obvious the coach is fully invested in the development of Dart, whom the Giants traded up to take with the 25th pick of the draft in April.\nThis comes after the arranged marriage of Daboll and Daniel Jones ended in an unceremonious divorce last November. It never seemed like the fiery Daboll fully embraced the stoic Jones. Daboll appears far more compatible with the self-assured Dart.\n\u201cHe\u2019s someone that I enjoy coaching and have a very good relationship with,\u201d Daboll said. \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s here.\u201d\nWilson got the opening possession with the first-team offense, driving to Buffalo\u2019s 27-yard line with a steady diet of short passes before consecutive penalties by left tackle James Hudson. The Giants were forced to settle for the first of three 50-plus-yard field goals by Graham Gano, with Wilson\u2019s day ending after the 12-play drive.\nDart, who has been the No. 2 quarterback throughout training camp, took the field midway through the first quarter with the second-team offense. Offensive coordinator Mike Kafka leaned on the run-pass options that Dart is comfortable with from the Ole Miss offense. Dart completed his first pass and gained one first down before a third-and-3 pass zoomed incomplete past tight end Greg Dulcich.\nDart\u2019s second drive was his best. Taking over at the Giants\u2019 20-yard line, he hit running back Dante Miller for an 18-yard gain on a screen on third-and-9. A quick out to Montrell Washington gained 29 yards on the next play as the wide receiver used a nasty stop/start move to evade tacklers.\nAdvertisement\nDart\u2019s next pass was tipped at the line of scrimmage \u2014 that happened twice on his 19 attempts \u2014 and was nearly intercepted by Bills linebacker Joe Andreessen. Facing third-and-6 from Buffalo\u2019s 28-yard line, Dart identified a one-on-one matchup with wide receiver Lil\u2019Jordan Humphrey against cornerback Dane Jackson.\nHumphrey beat Jackson off the line on a go route, and Dart lofted a perfect pass a moment before getting blasted by defensive tackle T.J. Sanders. Humphrey ran under the pass that landed in his outstretched hands at the goal line for a touchdown.\nJaxson's FIRST\u203c\ufe0f\n\ud83d\udcfa: NBC4/NFL Network pic.twitter.com/6hRaaH4BXb\n\u2014 New York Giants (@Giants) August 9, 2025\n\u201cSweet throw,\u201d Daboll said. \u201cHe gives guys chances down the field.\u201d\nPlaying behind a second-team offensive line that refreshingly wasn\u2019t a disaster, Dart displayed good pocket awareness. He wasn\u2019t sacked on 21 dropbacks and didn\u2019t get flustered when there was pressure. He made an athletic play just to get rid of the ball on his first drive when an unblocked defender off the edge was in his face instantly.\n\u201cWe saw that on tape at Ole Miss,\u201d Daboll said. \u201cHe did that for a long time there. He\u2019s tough. He\u2019s got good moxie. He\u2019s got toughness. He\u2019s got leadership.\u201d\nDart led two more drives that led to long field goals by Gano before exiting at halftime. On the first field goal drive, Dart shrewdly lofted a screen pass to Miller that gained 13 yards on third-and-12. Dart then gained 19 yards on a scramble as the pocket collapsed, although he took an unnecessary hit at the end of the run instead of sliding.\n\u201cI think (Daboll) likes it, to be honest,\u201d Dart said of his cavalier running style. \u201cIt\u2019s more my teammates like, \u2018Hey, we don\u2019t need to see you take any of those extra shots, so make sure you\u2019re sliding.\u2019\u201d\nDART ON THE RUN \ud83d\udd25\n\ud83d\udcfa: NBC4/NFL Network pic.twitter.com/SWxKROlLgO\n\u2014 New York Giants (@Giants) August 9, 2025\nThat drive stalled when a third-and-7 pass from Buffalo\u2019s 31-yard line went through Washington\u2019s hands. The pass was well-placed in a tight window and should have been caught.\nDart\u2019s final possession gave him a valuable opportunity to run a two-minute drill. The Giants took over at their 36-yard line with 2:26 remaining in the first half.\nAdvertisement\nDart moved the Giants into Buffalo territory with consecutive completions to Washington that gained 31 yards. The first connection was an 18-yard strike over the middle after climbing the pocket. Facing third-and-5 from Buffalo\u2019s 33-yard line, Dart again targeted Washington.\nHis throw on a deep out was a beat late and could have been placed farther outside, but it was another pass that should have been caught. Ending his last two drives on missed opportunities left a slightly bitter taste in Dart\u2019s mouth.\n\u201cI just felt like the only reason that we stopped ourselves from scoring touchdowns were some of those third downs and not converting,\u201d Dart said. \u201cPersonally, I\u2019m really hard on myself, so in those moments I want to capitalize on that.\u201d\nNow that Dart\u2019s performance has been recapped, it\u2019s necessary to add context. Preseason schemes are typically vanilla, so he wasn\u2019t being challenged to read a complex NFL defense. After a punt on his one drive against the Bills\u2019 starters, Dart\u2019s three scoring drives came against backups (of course, he was playing with the Giants\u2019 backups).\nAnd most importantly, preseason performance isn\u2019t predictive. If it were, Jones would still be the team\u2019s quarterback because his rookie preseason was immaculate \u2014 29 of 34 for 416 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions in four games.\nThis is not meant to pour cold water on the enthusiasm generated by Dart\u2019s debut. It\u2019s intended only to add perspective.\nPerhaps Dart\u2019s debut will prove to be a precursor to a brilliant career that reverses the franchise\u2019s fortunes. Or maybe it will be long forgotten if he fails to develop into a franchise quarterback. It\u2019s too soon to know that answer, so all the Giants and their fans can do is appreciate the strong first impression and hope it\u2019s a first step toward a brighter future.\n(Photo: Bryan M.

      "text": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 This spring, at New York Giants OTAs, defensive lineman Rakeem Nu\u00f1ez-Roches approached Evan Neal.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t keep doing this,\u201d the 11-year veteran told the offensive lineman. \u201cYou\u2019re going to continuously get beat.\u201d\nNeal, a 2022 first-round pick, has spent this offseason working on his transition from tackle to guard. During OTAs, Neal played dozens of snaps with the starting offense and against the starting defense, meaning he matched up against Nu\u00f1ez-Roches pretty often. Following this particular play, Neal, who is 6-foot-7 and 340 pounds, used a familiar hand technique, leaving him vulnerable to a wise veteran like Nu\u00f1ez-Roches.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cOnce I beat your hands, I\u2019m gone,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez-Roches told Neal. \u201cI\u2019m too quick for you to recover.\u201d\nFortunately for Neal, the conversation continued. When asked about it later, Neal said they talked about the importance of changing things up \u2014 like using different set angles to throw off defenders off and varying how he uses his hands.\nAs Neal said, \u201cIn this league, it\u2019s all about adaptability.\u201d\nThat word is one Neal has had to embrace \u2014 not only with his technique but with his entire career.\nThree seasons ago, he was poised to become a Giants building block. The franchise drafted Neal at No. 7 out of Alabama, expecting him to serve as the pillar opposite All-Pro left tackle Andrew Thomas for years to come. But that never happened. Injuries \u2014 he\u2019s played in just 29 games in three seasons \u2014 and poor play resulted in Neal coming to something of a crossroads this offseason. If he was going to make it in New York, it was not going to be at tackle.\nAnd so, the transition began. Neal\u2019s been working at guard this offseason and now finds himself in a competition with last season\u2019s starter, 35-year-old journeyman Greg Van Roten, at right guard. Though preseason depth charts tend not to mean too much, the Giants listed Van Roten as the starter and Neal as his backup on their first depth chart, released Tuesday.\nWhile the switch to guard is an adjustment for Neal at the NFL level, he has some experience inside, playing left guard his freshman year at Alabama in 2019. Obviously, Neal couldn\u2019t simply rely on that experience to carry him through, and he didn\u2019t. He spent part of his offseason working at his old school, IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida, dialing in on footwork that would be required of him to play guard. He also focused on building up his strength and endurance.\nWith the Giants back at training camp for the past two weeks, teammates have seen a change in Neal\u2019s play and his confidence at the new position.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, OK, you\u2019re playing the game. You\u2019re getting comfortable,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez-Roches said. \u201cHe\u2019s already a big man. No one\u2019s getting around him. When he throws those combinations at you, it not only has you guessing, but now you don\u2019t know where to put your hands.\u201d\nLeft guard Jon Runyan Jr. has some experience with transitioning to guard, as he primarily played tackle in college. He\u2019s been encouraged by the progress he\u2019s seen Neal make.\n\u201cAt guard, you\u2019re in a wrestling match, like kind of in a phone booth,\u201d Runyan said. \u201cYou have to stay in front of the guys; you have to anchor, and you have to set the depth of the pocket. And Evan, you see those flashes of him when he gets his feet under control and he\u2019s punching; he\u2019s a large human, and not many people can bull rush him and set him back.\u201d\nGiants right tackle Jermaine Eluemunor, who regularly lines up next to Neal, is already thinking about how \u201cdouble teams are going to be terrible for defensive tackles.\u201d\n\u201cPlaying guard is a hard position in this offense, because you have to know so much,\u201d Eluemunor said. \u201cYou have to be basically a center. \u2026 You have to know the slides, the squeezes, the defenses, how to ID the fronts, all those different things. \u2026 But he\u2019s getting the technique down, and he\u2019s such a big freaking guy that you\u2019re not gonna run through him. You try to run around him, and he\u2019s gonna put those freaking 40-inch arms (Neal\u2019s arms measured at 34 inches at the NFL combine) on you, and it\u2019s over. He\u2019s really bought into it.\u201d\nSo far during training camp, Neal\u2019s on-field results have been mixed. The highs \u2014 stonewalling impressive rookie edge rusher Abdul Carter in a one-on-one matchup last week and playing fairly well in some team periods \u2014 have been encouraging, but the lows \u2014 losing to Carter on the ensuring one-on-one rep last week and getting pushed to the ground too much during some team periods \u2014 are indicative of a player who is still adjusting to a new position.\nEvan Neal v. Abdul Carter round 2 https://t.co/MPtGIdk13g pic.twitter.com/nLRI2Tb5qn\n\u2014 Bobby Skinner (@BobbySkinner_) July 29, 2025\n\u201cI\u2019m still working out the kinks,\u201d Neal said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I played guard, so the set angles are just a bit different. Just trying to get comfortable in my guard stance and just making sure my technique is on point. But that\u2019s gonna come with time.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been getting better and better. I\u2019m not where I want to be, but I\u2019m on the way.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nNeal has largely split starting reps with Van Roten during camp, but he\u2019s recently picked up a majority of the first-team snaps as Van Roten missed three practices last week while awaiting the birth of his daughter. With Van Roten back Monday, the two rotated again, while Neal also played some second-team snaps at left guard.\nNeal has said he\u2019s willing to play wherever the Giants need him, but he acknowledged that since he has played on the right side the last three seasons, that does feel \u201ca bit more comfortable.\u201d Keeping him on the right should suit the Giants, as Runyan has settled into the left guard role.\nWhile it\u2019s fair to presume the Giants would prefer Neal to win the right guard job with Van Roten likely nearing the end of his career and playing on a one-year deal, coach Brian Daboll hasn\u2019t tipped his hand on who is leading the competition. Instead, Daboll said the team will be looking closely at each player\u2019s performance in the preseason.\nThe Giants\u2019 first game action comes Saturday against the Buffalo Bills. Exactly how many reps Neal will play Saturday and throughout the rest of the preseason remains an open question, with Daboll not yet unveiling his plans for playing time during the exhibition season. However, it would stand to reason that the team would want to get Neal plenty of snaps so he can keep adjusting to the spot.\nGreg Van Roten on Evan Neal's transition to playing guard:\n\"It's not easy to move inside, especially at this level, but he's taking it in stride, he's trying to learn every day, work on his technique, and improve\" pic.twitter.com/L8jooXrNsp\n\u2014 Giants Videos (@SNYGiants) August 5, 2025\nWhile Neal certainly is still figuring out his new position, he\u2019s embraced the challenge. It\u2019s hard not to notice a sense of calm exuding from the lineman when he talks about the forthcoming season. To that end, Neal believes that being healthy and focusing on football, rather than any outside critiques or criticisms, has put him in a better headspace. All he cares about, he said, is putting himself in a position to help the team win.\nBut, of course, Neal will win, too, if this switch pans out. He\u2019s playing in the final year of his rookie contract after the Giants declined to exercise his fifth-year option.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a natural amount of pressure playing a high-level sport like this in general,\u201d Neal said. \u201cBut I\u2019m confident in myself. I\u2019m confident in my abilities and my work ethic. I know I\u2019m going to be all right. Nothing\u2019s ever perfect, but I know that (if) I continue to approach the game the way I approach it, I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\n\u2014 The Athletic\u2019s Dan Duggan contributed to this report\n(Photo: Yuki Iwamura / Associated Press)"
