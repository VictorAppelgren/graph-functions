  "description": "Appaloosa's billionaire investor has swapped out two artificial intelligence (AI) hardware goliaths for a rapidly growing company in the fintech arena.",
  "content": "Appaloosa's billionaire investor has swapped out two artificial intelligence (AI) hardware goliaths for a rapidly growing company in the fintech arena.\n\nBetween near-daily economic data releases and the six-week period each quarter (\"earnings season\") where many of Wall Street's most-influential business reveal their operating results, keeping up on market-moving news events can be challenging. Once in a while, something of importance can fall through the cracks.\n\nFor example, the sheer abundance of Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission might go unnoticed by investors. A 13F is a required filing no later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter for institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management. It provides a snapshot for investors of which stocks Wall Street's smartest fund managers are buying and selling.\n\nWhile there's no substitute to quarterly earnings reports, knowing which stocks and trends Wall Street's leading asset managers are buying into or selling out of is equally valuable.\n\nBeyond Warren Buffett, Appaloosa's billionaire chief David Tepper tends to be one of the most-followed fund managers. Tepper's willingness to dive into popular growth stocks has resonated with investors during the current bull market.\n\nHowever, Tepper's trading activity over the previous year (April 1, 2024\u2013March 31, 2025) has been eyebrow-raising, to say the least. Based on 13Fs, he's been a persistent seller of two of Wall Street's most-popular artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, Nvidia (NVDA -0.44%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.30%). At the same time, he's chosen to buy shares of a cutting-edge company whose total addressable market is estimated at $205 billion.\n\nOver a 12-month period ended March 31, Tepper and his team completely exited 14 holdings and reduced Appaloosa's stake in 19 other positions. Among these moves, the two most noteworthy are:\n\u2022 Nvidia: 4,120,000 shares sold, representing a 93% reduction (note: this accounts for Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split in June 2024).\n\nOn paper, everything would seem to be going great for these developers of graphics processing unit (GPUs). Nvidia's Hopper (H100) and Blackwell GPUs hold a majority of AI-accelerated data center market share, while AMD's Instinct series chips are ramping up and aiming to siphon away market share from Nvidia. For more than two years, businesses have been spending aggressively on AI-data center infrastructure to gain first-mover advantages over their peers.\n\nNvidia has been particularly adept at growing its sales and keeping customers loyal thanks to its CUDA software platform. CUDA is what developers use to maximize the computing potential of their Nvidia GPUs, as well as to train large language models.\n\nHowever, David Tepper's selling activity in AI hardware stocks was likely undertaken with a purpose.\n\nOne possibility is that Tepper and his team were (pardon the pun) taking their chips off the table after a sizable run-up in the shares of both Nvidia and AMD. The average holding period for Appaloosa's securities is two years and five months, which suggests Tepper isn't shy about locking in gains when presented with the opportunity to do so. The concern is there may be more to this story than just profit-taking.\n\nArguably the biggest worry with the AI revolution is that it'll follow historical precedent. For more than three decades, every game-changing technology has worked its way through an early stage bubble that eventually burst. Put another way, investors have consistently overestimated how quickly a new technology would earn wide adoption and become useful. It takes time for next-big-thing innovations to mature, and artificial intelligence doesn't look as if it'll be the exception.\n\nIf an AI bubble were to form and burst, AI hardware stocks like Nvidia and AMD would undoubtedly feel the pinch.\n\nCompetitive pressures are also a concern (more so for Nvidia than AMD). Though most eyes tend to be on external competitors developing AI-GPUs, internal competition is possibly an even bigger story.\n\nMany of Wall Street's most-influential companies are internally developing AI chips to use in their data centers. Even though this hardware can't compete with Nvidia and/or AMD on a compute basis, it'll be considerably cheaper and more readily available. In other words, it's a recipe for less AI-GPU scarcity, weaker pricing power, and lower gross margin for Nvidia and AMD.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Tepper added 10 new stocks to Appaloosa's nearly $8.4 billion investment portfolio over the last year (excluding options). Arguably one of the more attractive additions is that of fintech juggernaut Block (XYZ -0.52%).\n\nDuring the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tepper's fund held in excess of 400,000 shares of Block. But by the end of the first quarter of 2021, every share had been sent to the chopping block. Following a four-year hiatus, Block stock is back in Appaloosa's investment portfolio, with Tepper adding 75,000 shares during the March-ended quarter.\n\nBlock has two distinct operating segments -- Square ecosystem and Cash App -- each of which brings a sizable addressable market to the table.\n\nThe Square ecosystem is Block's foundational operating division, with this segment sporting an estimated addressable market of $130 billion, based on a research note released in November 2024 by Piper Sandler analyst Arvind Ramnani.\n\nSquare is the merchant-focused portion of Block's business that's designed to facilitate digital/mobile payments, as well as provide merchants with payment solutions and data analytics. During the fourth quarter of 2020, gross payment volume (GPV) totaled $29.4 billion for the Square ecosystem. But as of the second quarter of 2025, GPV topped $64.2 billion.\n\nThe rapid expansion in GPV on Square's payment networks is a function of sustained double-digit growth in international markets, as well as a higher percentage of GPV originating from larger businesses (those with $500,000 or more in annual GPV).\n\nThe other key puzzle piece for Block is its mobile payment service known as Cash App. Ramnani views Cash App as being a $75 billion addressable opportunity for Block. When combined with the Square ecosystem, Block is staring down an estimated $205 billion tailwind.\n\nAt the end of 2020, Cash App had 36 million monthly active customers. But as of the midpoint of 2025, there are now 57 million monthly transacting active users. Cash App is a higher margin opportunity for Block than the Square ecosystem, with gross profit per Cash App user often heavily outpacing the cost to acquire Cash App actives.\n\nThough both of Block's operating segments are more than a decade old, they're arguably still early in their respective expansions. Even with competition picking up in the digital payments arena, Block appears well-positioned to capitalize on a sustained double-digit growth opportunity.",

      "text": "Fintech is a combination of the words finance and technology. It\u2019s a broad category made up of companies that apply new technology to financial businesses. For example, companies that develop new digital payment-processing solutions are considered fintech, as are companies that build and operate person-to-person payment applications.\nThe potential of fintech is exciting. You might be surprised at how many cash-based transactions are still happening around the world, and how many people still have their savings at brick-and-mortar banks that barely pay any interest.\nIn this article, we'll take a look at the different types of fintech stocks, and some specific examples of promising fintech stocks you can buy right now.\nTypes of fintech stocks\nTypes of fintech stocks\nFintech is a broad term that refers to any company that applies technology to the world of finance. Many types of companies are under the fintech umbrella. Here are some of the products and services they offer:\n- Payment processing.\n- Online and mobile banking.\n- Online and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending.\n- Person-to-person payments.\n- Financial software.\n- Financial services.\nMost fintech companies fall under the umbrella of growth stocks.\nFive top fintech stock in 2025\nFive top fintech stock investments in 2025\nAs we head into 2025, many fintech stocks have rebounded from the bear market we saw after the COVID-19 pandemic ended but remain well below all-time highs.\nHowever, there's a ton of long-term potential in the fintech industry. And there are some fintech stocks that look like especially strong opportunities right now. With that in mind, here are five fintech stocks that could make great additions to your portfolio:\n1. Block\n1. Block\nFormerly known as Square, Block's (NYSE:SQ) product suite has evolved from a way for merchants to accept credit cards using their mobile phones into a large-scale financial ecosystem for individuals and small businesses.\nBlock now processes payments for merchants at an annualized rate of about $240 billion, has its own banking subsidiary (Square Financial Services), and a thriving small business lending platform.\nCash App is especially interesting, with 57 million active monthly users as of late 2024 and virtually unlimited potential to build out its consumer financial service offerings. The platform already offers direct deposits, debit cards, the ability to buy and sell Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC), and a user-friendly stock trading platform. Cash App could still be in the early stages of monetization and could have major upside potential in the future.\n2. PayPal\n2. PayPal\nPayPal Holdings (PYPL -0.87%) is the undisputed leader in online payments -- and so much more. Its Venmo person-to-person payment platform has emerged as an industry leader, and its namesake PayPal brand continues to innovate the ways we pay for things both online and off.\nPayPal has a completely new executive leadership team that has been quite active when it comes to looking for ways to reinvigorate the business' growth. So far, the team has successfully boosted efficiency and has rolled out exciting initiatives such as Fastlane checkout and the creation of an advertising platform.\nWith more than $11 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and about $5 billion in annualized free cash flow, PayPal has the financial flexibility to pursue opportunities as they arise.\nPayPal has 432 million active accounts in more than 200 countries around the world. In a nutshell, this is a highly profitable industry leader, and there's no reason to believe that will change anytime soon.\n3. Bank of America\n3. Bank of America\nThis one might sound odd at first. When many people think of Bank of America (BAC 0.25%), they think of old-school banking -- literally the opposite of fintech innovation.\nHowever, there are some good reasons Bank of America is more of a fintech than it seems. In 15+ years since the 2008-09 financial crisis, CEO Brian Moynihan and his team have done a great job of improving asset quality and focusing on efficiency. Technology has played a big role. Bank of America has been named the No. 1 bank for \"Online Banking and Mobile Banking Functionality\" by Javelin, as well as the \"Best Consumer Digital Bank in the U.S.\" by Global Finance.\nAs more customers take advantage of the bank's excellent digital channels, the business will become more efficient. With a valuation that's cheaper than many other large banks and a 2.3% dividend yield, Bank of America is an outside-the-box fintech worth considering.\n4. Adyen\n4. Adyen\nAdyen (ADYE.Y -0.4%) isn't exactly a household name to most U.S. investors, but it certainly belongs in the same conversations as Block and PayPal.\nBased in the Netherlands, Adyen provides payment processing solutions to businesses and has operations around the world (including a large U.S. presence). It offers payment solutions for in-person, online, and mobile channels. But, unlike the other major payment processing tech companies, Adyen focuses almost exclusively on large businesses. Microsoft (MSFT -0.16%), Uber (UBER 1.14%), and McDonald's (MCD -0.38%) all rely on Adyen for their payment processing needs. You may recall that eBay dropped PayPal as its preferred payment processor several years ago; that was in favor of Adyen.\nAdyen's growth has been impressive, and the business had processed more than $1.4 trillion in annualized payment volume as of mid-2024. Plus, Adyen is highly profitable, with a 46% earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin that could get even better as the business scales.\n5. MercadoLibre\n5. MercadoLibre\nMercadoLibre (MELI -2.62%) is often referred to as the Amazon (AMZN -0.7%) of Latin America, and the nickname certainly makes sense. The company has a massive e-commerce business, with well over $50 billion in annualized merchandise sales volume, and it continues to grow at an impressive pace.\nThe company also has a logistics platform (Mercado Envios) and a lending business (Mercado Credito), both of which have gained serious traction in recent years. Mercado Credito is especially interesting, with 77% year-over-year growth in the credit portfolio in late 2024.\nFiscal Quarter\nHowever, it's the Mercado Pago payments platform that is most exciting, at least from a fintech perspective. The business processes more than $200 billion in annualized payment volume and is growing at a much faster rate than the e-commerce business. Most encouraging is that Mercado Pago is growing fastest when it comes to processing payments outside of MercadoLibre's e-commerce platform. Think of Mercado Pago as an earlier-stage PayPal (remember when it was part of eBay?) that has developed into an impressive business all by itself.\nOne great fintech ETF to consider\nWhenever you have a high-growth and relatively young industry, it can seem intimidating for investors to try choosing one or two stocks. And that's especially true in a volatile and unpredictable market environment like we saw in the bear market a few years ago.\nWith that in mind, an alternative that lets you profit from the fintech boom without having to pick individual stocks can be an exchange-traded fund (ETF). If this sounds good to you, consider the Global X Fintech ETF (FINX -0.64%).\nThe fund invests in a portfolio of fintech companies and holds more than 60 stocks as of January 2025. The portfolio includes a few of the names on the list above (PayPal is the largest holding), as well as several others, such as Fiserv (FI -0.74%) and Coinbase (COIN 2.97%), plus many others of all different sizes and business models. The point is that all the companies have excellent growth potential, but your investment won't get crushed if one or two of them don't quite live up to expectations.\nRelated investing topics\nA great arena for long-term growth investors\nInvesting in fintech stocks isn\u2019t for investors with a low tolerance for volatility and risk. Like any exciting growth industry, fintech is likely to be a bit of a roller-coaster ride as the industry matures.\nHowever, for long-term investors with relatively high risk tolerance, fintech stocks such as those mentioned here can be an excellent means of capitalizing on one of the most exciting growth trends in the business world.\nFAQ\nInvesting in Fintech Stock: FAQ\nWhat is fintech?\nFintech, short for financial technology, describes technologies that are being leveraged to make financial processes easier, more efficient, and more profitable. Fintech companies develop a variety of software platforms, apps, hardware solutions, and more to achieve these goals.\nWhat are the best fintech companies to invest in?\nThese five fintech stocks could make great additions to your portfolio:\n- Block.\n- PayPal.\n- Bank of America.\n- Adyen.\n- MercadoLibre.\nAre fintech stocks cyclical?\nGenerally speaking, the answer is yes. Fintech stocks are cyclical businesses for the most part. They largely perform in correlation with consumer spending and business investment. That said, not all fintech stocks are equally cyclical. For example, companies that develop technology for insurance companies aren't inherently cyclical since insurance is a rather recession-resistant business. On the other hand, companies that develop payment technologies, which are more vulnerable to the effects of market forces, are more likely to experience significant slowdowns during recessions."

      "text": "Roughly three decades ago, the advent of the internet changed everything for corporate America. Although it took many years for the internet to mature as a technology, and for companies to realize its full potential, it's positively altered the growth trajectory for businesses and opened new doors that previously hadn't existed.\nSince the mid-1990s, Wall Street has been waiting for a new technology or game-changing innovation to replicate what the internet did for businesses. Artificial intelligence (AI) appears to have answered the call.\nWhat makes AI such an intriguing technology is its broad-reaching utility. AI-driven software and systems have the capacity grow smarter and become more efficient at their assigned tasks over time. What's more, software and systems may be able to learn new tasks without human intervention.\nTo some, the sky is truly the limit for artificial intelligence. In Sizing the Prize, the analysts at PwC predict AI will increase global gross domestic product by $15.7 trillion come 2030, with these gains coming from a combination of increased productivity and consumption-side effects.\nA $15.7 trillion addressable market leaves plenty of room for multiple companies to be winners. But over the past two years, there's been no clearer beneficiary of the AI revolution than semiconductor colossus Nvidia (NVDA -0.44%), which vaulted from a $360 billion market cap to end 2022 to $3.56 trillion, as of the closing bell on Nov. 11.\nNvidia's operating expansion has been virtually flawless\nInvestors don't have to look far to discover why Nvidia has become Wall Street's most-valuable publicly traded company. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the preferred choice of businesses operating AI-accelerated data centers. Nvidia's H100 GPU, commonly known as the \"Hopper,\" and successor Blackwell GPU architecture, are effectively the brains that allow for split-second decision-making by AI software and systems.\nBased on a study from the analysts at TechInsights, Nvidia accounted for roughly 98% of the 2.67 million GPUs shipped to data centers in 2022, as well as the 3.85 million GPUs shipped in 2023. It's unlikely to lose its near-monopoly market share this year, either, with orders for the Hopper chip and Blackwell backlogged.\nThis is a good time to mention that when demand for a good or service outstrips supply, the price of that good or service often rises. Nvidia has been able to command $30,000 to $40,000 for the Hopper, which is 100% to 300% more than what competing AI-GPUs cost. Businesses have been willing to pay this premium given the computing advantages offered by Nvidia's hardware, and it's translated into a sizable uptick in the company's gross margin.\nThe company's CUDA platform also deserves credit for its virtually flawless operating expansion. CUDA is the software toolkit developers use to get the most out of their GPUs, including building large language models (LLMs). It's playing a key role in keeping Nvidia's clients loyal to the company's ecosystem of solutions.\nLastly, investors have been mesmerized by never-before-seen growth rates from a market-leading company. When fiscal 2023 came to a close on Jan. 29, 2023, Nvidia reported $27 billion in full-year sales. But based on Wall Street's forecast for fiscal 2026, Nvidia is on track to deliver $180 billion in revenue. That's a three-year compound annual sales growth rate of about 88%!\nYet in spite of its nearly textbook operating expansion, one undeniable threat looms large for Nvidia -- and pretty much no one is talking about it.\nThis threat has the potential to knock Wall Street's AI darling off of its pedestal\nAs most investors are probably well aware, the jaw-dropping addressable market for artificial intelligence has businesses clamoring for their piece of the pie. In the coming quarters, Nvidia is going to face no shortage of external competition.\nEven though Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.30%) entered the scene after Nvidia, it's had no trouble ramping up production for its MI300X AI-GPU. AMD also recently introduced its next-gen chip, the MI325X, which is expected to go into production before the end of this year. AMD's chips have a decisively lower price point than Nvidia's Hopper and Blackwell, which may make them attractive for businesses wanting to leverage AI in their data centers.\nHowever, external competition isn't the greatest threat to dethrone Nvidia. Rather, the biggest immediate headwind for Nvidia is internal competition.\nMany of America's most-influential businesses have ordered and are using Nvidia's GPUs in their high-compute data centers. This includes Microsoft (MSFT -0.16%), Meta Platforms (META -0.49%), Amazon (AMZN -0.70%), Alphabet (GOOGL -0.27%) (GOOG -0.30%), Tesla, OpenAI, and AI infrastructure kingpin Super Micro Computer, which incorporates Nvidia's GPUs into its customizable rack servers.\nFor the three months ended July 28, 2024, four of Nvidia's customers -- it doesn't disclose the name of its top customers -- accounted for 46% of its net sales, with a fifth contributing less than 10%, but still likely in the high single digits. We can comfortably say that half of Nvidia's revenue comes from just five customers. If I had to venture a guess, I'd expect to these clients to be Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Super Micro (not in this order).\nThe concern for Nvidia is that most of these top customers are developing AI-GPUs for use in their respective data centers.\n- Microsoft developed the Azure Maia AI chip, which can be used to train large language models and oversee generative AI solutions within the company's Azure cloud infrastructure platform.\n- Meta is working internally on developing the \"Meta Training and Inference Accelerator\" chip to maximize the potential of its AI data center.\n- Amazon is developing a number of GPU chips, including Trainium2 and Inferentia, which will cater to clients of its world-leading cloud infrastructure service platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n- Alphabet is relying on tensor processing units (TPUs) for training LLMs and inference. TPUs are application-specific integrated circuits custom-built for AI applications.\nWhile there might be various aspects of these internally developed chips that outperform Nvidia's Hopper and/or Blackwell, the latter's hardware should remain decisively superior with regard to its computing capabilities. However, this may not be enough to keep Nvidia from losing valuable data center real estate in the quarters to come.\nMicrosoft, Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet have very deep pockets and abundant operating cash flow. While they can all afford Nvidia's premium price point for its AI-GPUs, it doesn't mean they're satisfied paying a considerably higher price point for this hardware. The order backlog associated with Nvidia's chips, coupled with the ease and cost of using internally developed AI-GPUs, will likely cause Nvidia to lose data center space in the future.\nRemember, AI-GPU scarcity has been the leading catalyst that's driven Nvidia's exceptional pricing power. With its top customers developing hardware of their own, it's only a matter of time before this scarcity wanes and Nvidia's margins weaken.\nInternal competition is, by far, the biggest threat to Nvidia's AI dominance."

      "text": "Data is the currency that keeps Wall Street's proverbial hamster on its wheel -- and investors are rarely, if ever, short of information to analyze. In fact, it can be argued that between earnings season and near-daily economic data releases, it's easy for something of importance to fly under the radar.\nFor example, no later than 45 days following the end to a quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management (AUM) are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This filing, which had a deadline of May 15 for the March-ended quarter, allows investors to see which stocks Wall Street's smartest fund managers bought and sold in the latest quarter.\nWhile investors tend to focus on the 13F of Wall Street's premier money manager, Warren Buffett, he's far from the only billionaire known for their keen insights and supercharged returns. Appaloosa's billionaire chief David Tepper is another asset manager investors wisely pay attention to.\nTepper, who's big fan of large-cap growth stocks, closed out March overseeing more than $8 billion in AUM spread across 38 holdings (stocks and options). Over the trailing year (ended March 31, 2025), Tepper has overseen the addition of 13 positions and the complete disposition of 14 stakes.\nAmong these numerous transactions, the most eye-popping just might be Tepper's complete exit from artificial intelligence (AI) favorite Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.30%), and his aggressive purchasing of two industry-leading companies whose addressable markets are forecast to grow tenfold over the next eight years.\nBillionaire David Tepper bids adieu to AMD\nWith the stock market entering 2025 at its third priciest valuation when back-tested to 1871, based on the Shiller price-to-earnings ratio, Appaloosa's billionaire investor hasn't been shy about ringing the register and/or taking some of his fund's chips off the table. Between April 1, 2024 and March 31, 2025, he green-lit the sale of 1,630,000 shares of Advanced Micro Devices, which is commonly referred to by its shorthand, \"AMD.\"\nDespite Nvidia being the undisputed market share leader in graphics processing units (GPUs) used by businesses in AI-accelerated data centers, there's the belief that AMD shouldn't have any trouble (pardon the necessary pun) chipping away at this market share lead. AMD's Instinct series AI-accelerating chips are less-costly than Nvidia, and its innovation timeline appears to be mirroring that of Wall Street's AI darling. This is to say that AMD's chips should enjoy strong demand from cost-conscious businesses and those companies that don't want to wait to get their hands on AI-data center hardware.\nIf Advanced Micro Devices is ideally set up to benefit from the AI revolution, the million-dollar question becomes: Why did David Tepper sell his fund's entire stake?\nOne possible answer is profit-taking. Appaloosa's average security has been held for about two years and five months, as of the end of the March. Tepper's position in AMD was entered during the second quarter of 2023, so it was held for around years. During that time, AMD stock moved from below $100 per share to between $100 and $200 per share for much of the last 20 months. This was a solid opportunity for Tepper to lock in gains.\nBut there may be more to this selling than meets the eye.\nFor example, AMD's growth rate has largely disappointed Wall Street analysts and investors, relative to other AI hardware names. Though the company appears to have found its stride in the first quarter of 2025, its gross margin of 50% is underwhelming. AMD failing to wow Wall Street may have to do with its ROCm software, which is designed to optimize AI workloads, not standing out in the same way as Nvidia's CUDA platform, which has cemented its clients within its AI ecosystem.\nThe other concern Tepper might have with AMD is the growing likelihood of an AI bubble forming and bursting. For more than 30 years, investors have consistently overestimated the early adoption rates and utility of game-changing innovations -- and AI looks to be the next technology in line to suffer this fate. Although Advanced Micro Devices is far more than just an AI stock, a bubble-bursting event for AI would weigh heavily on AMD.\nAppaloosa's billionaire investor piled into two companies on the cutting-edge of a hot growth trend\nOn the other end of the spectrum, it's billionaire David Tepper's aggressive addition to two existing positions (as of the end of March 2024) that really stands out.\nOver a four-quarter period, ended March 31, 2025, Appaloosa's billionaire chief purchased 1,840,000 shares of ride-share kingpin Uber Technologies (UBER 1.14%) and 8,532,382 shares of Lyft (LYFT 0.37%). This increased Tepper's stakes by 135% in Uber and 1,825% in Lyft.\nThe prevailing theme here is that Appaloosa's brightest investment mind isn't attempting to pick a winner in the ride-sharing space between Uber and Lyft. Rather, he's angling his fund to take advantage of a trend that's expected to grow tenfold over the next eight years. Based on estimates from Stratis Research, the global ride-sharing market is projected to grow by more than 10X, from $87.7 billion in 2025 to $918.2 billion come 2033. A 21% compound annual growth rate offers ample opportunity for both companies to thrive.\nAnother important distinction to be made is that Uber Technologies and Lyft have both turned the corner to recurring profitability. Despite a few potholes in its expansion, Uber has been led masterfully by CEO Dara Khosrowshahi since taking the reins in 2017. Meanwhile, David Risher tightened the belt at Lyft and vastly improved its operating cash flow since taking the reins in April 2023. Both companies appear to offer sustained double-digit growth potential.\nSomething else noteworthy about Uber and Lyft has been their ability to capitalize on other revenue channels beyond ride-sharing. Specifically, both are leaning into advertising opportunities associated with their ride-share programs as a way to bolster revenue and improve their operating cash flow. The nonlinearity of economic cycle tends to bode well for ad-driven businesses.\nIt's also worth mentioning that Uber has a bit more scale here than Lyft. On top of maintaining roughly three times as much of the ride-share market as Lyft, Uber also handles food delivery services and logistics. This diversifies its business a bit more and allows it to take advantage of long-winded periods of economic growth.\nPerhaps the one knock against Tepper's strategy is that Lyft, which is Appaloosa's smaller holding of the two, looks to be the better value. Whereas an argument can be made that Uber's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 4 is a reflection of its dominant market share in the ride-share space, it has to be asked: Is that really worth four times the P/S ratio of an equally fast-growing Lyft? I'd argue it isn't.\nBut if the addressable market for ride-sharing grows by 21% on annual basis worldwide over the next eight years, both stocks are very likely to be winners, assuming they can maintain or grow their respective market share."

The analyst believes that Block's Square payments business has a total addressable market of $130 billion, and that its Cash App payment app is tapping into a $75 billion market.\nThe analyst is optimistic that Block will continue to benefit as consumers and businesses move further into electronic payments, and believes the company's Square and Cash App segments are at the leading edge of innovation.\nThe positive sentiment toward Block comes after the company reported its third-quarter financial results last week. Block reported mixed results, with adjusted earnings per share of $0.88 that were in line with Wall Street's consensus estimate, but revenue of $5.9 billion missed estimates of $6.2 billion. That caused Block stock to dip last week, but investors are feeling optimistic again today.\nThis could be giving Block an additional boost\nIn addition to the analyst's comments, some investors are likely optimistic about Block today, as the price of Bitcoin has jumped to $86,900, as of this writing.\nInvestors can easily buy and sell Bitcoin in Block's Cash App, and the company owns about $630 million worth of the cryptocurrency. Block hasn't been shy about its bullish position on Bitcoin, and the company is investing in Bitcoin mining and has a digital wallet product called Bitkey.\nWith positive comments from an analyst and rising Bitcoin values, it's not surprising to see Block's stock jump today."

      "text": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a federal regulatory agency that enforces financial laws and aims to prevent stock market manipulation and other illegal activity. SEC filings are available to the public and provide a level of transparency that helps prevent financial abuse and allows investors to stay informed.\nIn particular, the SEC Form 13F provides valuable insights into the stocks and other equities and financial instruments owned and managed by companies and individuals.\nWhat is it?\nUnderstanding the SEC Form 13F\nInstitutional investment managers are required to submit a 13F form to the SEC if they hold or manage more than $100 million in securities that fall under the agency's 13F category. These securities include shares of stocks that trade on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).\nThe category also includes shares of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and closed-end investment companies. Convertible debt securities, equity options, and warrants are also reported in some cases.\nWho must use it?\nWho has to submit 13F forms?\nInvestment conglomerates, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, and individual investment advisors are all subject to 13F filing requirements if they hold more than $100 million in relevant securities. Businesses holding large investment portfolios are also considered institutional investment managers. Even companies operating outside the financial services space must submit quarterly 13F filings.\nFor example, Nvidia (NVDA -0.44%) began submitting publicly available 13F forms to the SEC in 2024. Interest in artificial intelligence (AI) helped push the value of the company's stock portfolio above $100 million, so the semiconductor specialist had to submit the disclosure filing to the agency. Because of Nvidia's highly influential position in the AI revolution, the disclosure of its investments helped create additional bullish momentum for some stocks it owned.\nInstitutional Investor\nImportance\nWhy are 13F forms important for investors?\nRetail investors can use 13F filings to track Wall Street's biggest players. Due to their size and resources, institutional investors enjoy significant advantages in the stock market. While 13F forms are submitted to the SEC only on a quarterly basis, these filings offer the average investor a window into the strategies of the world's most successful investment companies and individual asset managers.\nThe 13F disclosures can also substantially impact the valuation of individual stocks and the market at large. These filings show the stocks that Wall Street's most high-profile investment managers are buying and selling, and this information can help shape market sentiment.\nAn example\nAn example of the 13F form in action\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.15%)(BRK.B -0.11%) is one of the world's largest and most successful companies. Led by CEO Warren Buffett, the company owns a stock portfolio worth hundreds of billions of dollars and a long list of fully and partially owned subsidiary businesses. Buffett's investment conglomerate submits a publicly available 13F form to the SEC after each quarter, and its holdings disclosures are watched closely in the financial world.\nRelated investing topics\nMany investors pay close attention to Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly 13F filings because they reveal which stocks the investment company bought and sold in the previous quarter and how much cash and fixed income investments it owned. By tracking which stocks Buffett's company owns, investors can observe and replicate the strategies of one of the world's most successful financial conglomerates.\nMonitoring Berkshire's cash pile and whether the company has been a net buyer or seller of stocks can also provide insight into how Buffett and his team of analysts feel about the health of the overall stock market."

      "text": "For some investors, earnings season is the pinnacle of each quarter. This six-week period, where many of Wall Street's most influential businesses lift the hood on their operating results, provides investors with invaluable information.\nHowever, an equally strong argument can be made that the quarterly filing of Form 13Fs with the Securities and Exchange Commission is just as important as earnings season. A 13F offers investors a way to see which stocks Wall Street's top money managers have been buying and selling. In other words, these filings clue investors in to the stocks, industries, sectors, and trends that have piqued the interest of highly successful asset managers.\nArguably no trend has been hotter than the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Empowering software and systems with the tools to make split-second decisions without human intervention is a multitrillion-dollar global opportunity, which explains why AI stocks have soared.\nBut not all of Wall Street's prominent billionaire fund managers are along for the ride.\nBased on 13Fs filed in mid-May that detail first-quarter trading activity, Appaloosa's billionaire chief David Tepper has been a big-time seller of three red-hot AI stocks -- Nvidia (NVDA -0.44%), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.30%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), or TSMC -- over the previous year. Curiously, though, Tepper has been loading up on another AI stock that somewhat recently joined the exclusive trillion-dollar club.\nBillionaire David Tepper has been a persistent seller of Nvidia, AMD, and TSMC stock\nTepper and his team tend to be fairly active and are regularly building up or reducing their existing stakes. Rather than looking at changes from the prior three-month period, more wisdom can often be gained by examining year-over-year changes to Appaloosa's more than $8 billion dollar investment portfolio.\nBetween April 1, 2024, and March 31, 2025, Tepper oversaw a significant reduction in, or the complete exit from, three of the AI revolution's top companies:\n- Nvidia: 4,120,000 shares sold (93% reduction), which has been adjusted to account for Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split in June 2024.\n- Taiwan Semiconductor: 230,000 shares sold (46% reduction).\n- Advanced Micro Devices: 1,630,000 shares sold (completely exited position).\nAll three of these companies have been successful in their own right within the AI arena. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) account for the bulk of GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers, while AMD's Instinct series chips are slowly adding market share. Meanwhile, TSMC is the world's leading chip-fabrication company, with its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity rapidly expanding to satiate growing enterprise demand for AI infrastructure.\nIf everything is going to well for Nvidia, AMD, and TSMC, the question that has to be asked is: Why did billionaire David Tepper sell over a 12-month period?\nSimple profit-taking is one of the more logical answers. All three companies have seen their shares appreciate noticeably over the trailing-three-year period, and Tepper has demonstrated he's not shy about locking in gains. What's worrisome is there may be more to this persistent selling activity than just a desire to take some chips off the table.\nFor example, every next-big-thing technology since (and including) the proliferation of the internet in the mid-1990s has navigated its way through a bubble that eventually burst. In plainer English, investors continually overestimate the adoption rates and/or utility of game-changing technological advances. It's going to take time for AI to mature as a technology and for businesses to figure out how to optimize their solutions and generate a positive return on their investments. This suggests another bubble may be brewing.\nWhereas Taiwan Semiconductor is a diversified company that generates a meaningful percentage of its net sales from fabricating chips for smartphones, Internet of Things, and automotive, Nvidia and AMD are increasingly reliant on enterprise GPU orders. If an AI bubble were to form and burst, these two companies would be hit hard.\nValuation may have also come into play for Appaloosa's billionaire chief. Historically, industry-leading businesses thriving on the heels of a next-big-thing trend have topped out at 30 to 40 times trailing-12-month sales. Nvidia's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is 31, as of this writing.\nWith the stock market also historically pricey, Tepper may view Nvidia, AMD, and TSMC as being on shakier ground than their respective share prices would indicate.\nThis trillion-dollar AI stock is bucking the trend in Tepper's fund\nWhereas billionaire David Tepper has been an undeniable seller of artificial intelligence stocks over the trailing year, based on 13F filings, there's one trillion-dollar AI stock that's managed to buck the trend. During the March-ended quarter, Appaloosa gobbled up 130,000 shares of Broadcom (AVGO -0.47%), which is one of only 11 public companies around the world to have ever reached a $1 trillion valuation.\nWhile Nvidia and AMD have locked down the lion's share of GPU market share in AI-accelerated data centers, Broadcom is the preferred choice for its host of AI networking solutions. Its products are capable of connecting tens of thousands of AI-GPUs in order to maximize compute capacity, as well as minimize tail latency. Put simply, Broadcom's hardware reduces lag, which facilitates the split-second decisions that need to be made by AI-empowered software and systems.\nBroadcom is also making a name for itself thanks to its custom AI chips. During the company's fourth-quarter conference call in late 2024, CEO Hock Tan opined that a few of its hyperscaler clients could spend anywhere from $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027 (its fiscal year ends in late October or early November). As long as AI remains a hot trend, Broadcom is expected to be one of the more unstoppable stocks.\nBut what Appaloosa's Tepper might appreciate most about Broadcom is that it's much more than just an AI-driven company. While AI is, unquestionably, Broadcom's most meaningful growth driver at the moment, it has plenty of other channels that generate sales and positive operating cash flow.\nBefore AI became the hottest thing on Wall Street, Broadcom was known for its lead role in developing wireless chips and accessories used in next-generation smartphones. Even though smartphones aren't the growth story they were a decade ago, the ongoing expansion of 5G service globally provides a modest growth opportunity for Broadcom.\nIn addition, it offers an assortment of solutions for industrial product lines and automobiles, as well as owns an enterprise cybersecurity solutions division. The point being that if the AI bubble were to burst, Broadcom would, in all likelihood, be in better shape to navigate the coming storm than hardware giants Nvidia and AMD.\nLastly, Tepper may have found Broadcom's valuation more palatable than the likes of Nvidia. As of this writing on Aug. 5, Broadcom is valued at 35 times forward-year earnings, but appears to be sporting a sustainable annual growth rate of 20% or greater."

      "text": "When the curtain closes on 2024 in less than two weeks, it'll likely represent another banner year for Wall Street. The iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average, benchmark S&P 500, and growth-powered Nasdaq Composite have each ascended to multiple record-closing highs this year.\nThough there have been a confluence of factors lifting Wall Street's major indexes to uncharted territory, including better-than-expected corporate earnings, stock-split euphoria, and Donald Trump's November victory, nothing is creating more buzz than the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\nThe long-term addressable market for AI is practically limitless. Software and systems empowered with AI can become more proficient at their assigned tasks, and can evolve and \"learn\" without human intervention. It's why the analysts at PwC estimate AI will add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by the turn of the decade.\nIn response to this generational opportunity, top-tier AI stocks have soared -- and with good reason.\nNvidia (NVDA -0.44%) has gained nearly $2.9 trillion in market value since the start of 2023, with the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) becoming the undisputed top choice in AI-accelerated data centers. Last week, AI networking solutions specialist Broadcom became just the 11th publicly traded company globally to reach a $1 trillion nominal valuation. Meanwhile, AI-driven data-mining specialist Palantir Technologies (PLTR -2.27%) is nipping at the heels of a 1,000% gain over the trailing-two-year period.\nThese represent just some of Wall Street's prominent tech stocks that have soared on the expectation that demand for AI hardware and software will change the corporate landscape.\nBut while Nvidia's and Broadcom's growth forecasts have knocked even the loftiest analyst expectations out of the park, there are reasons to believe the artificial intelligence bubble will burst in the new year.\nHistory has a flawless track record of upending parabolic rallies in next-big-thing innovations\nAmong the catalysts that could halt the nearly parabolic climb AI stocks like Nvidia and Palantir have enjoyed, none stands out more than history. Although history isn't a timing tool, it does have an immaculate track record of forecasting eventual downside in market-leading businesses on the cutting-edge of next-big-thing innovations.\nApproximately 30 years ago, the internet began going mainstream and positively changed the corporate growth arc forever. However, the utility of the internet wasn't fully understood by businesses for many years, which is why we witnessed the dot-com bubble take shape.\nSince the advent of the internet, we've witnessed plenty of next-big-thing technologies, innovations, and trends, including genome decoding, 3D printing, blockchain technology, cannabis, and the metaverse. The problem is that they've all endured an early stage bubble-bursting event.\nWithout fail, professional and everyday investors have consistently overestimated how quickly a new technology or innovation would be adopted and utilized. This eventually leads to the disappointment that causes market leaders of these next-big-thing trends to lose 80% to 99% of their value.\nTo be clear, I'm not in any way suggesting AI can't be a game-changing technology. What I am saying is that all new technologies and innovations need time to mature. The simple fact that most businesses can't lay out a clear plan as to how they'll deploy AI to generate a positive return on their investment is a pretty good indicator that we're in a bubble.\nRemoving GPU scarcity would quell investor euphoria (and margin)\nAnother reason the AI bubble can burst in 2025 is due to the expected resolution of GPU scarcity that's sent Nvidia's stock into the stratosphere.\nDemand for Nvidia's hardware has been otherworldly, with orders for its H100 GPU, commonly known as the \"Hopper,\" and its successor Blackwell GPU backlogged. When the demand for a good or service handily outstrips its supply, it's normal for its price to climb. Earlier this year, Nvidia was commanding around $40,000 for its Hopper chip, which is up to a 300% premium to what Advanced Micro Devices was netting for its Insight MI300X GPUs.\nIn other words, Nvidia has been able to use AI-GPU scarcity to its advantage to increase the price point of its hardware and pump up its gross margin to the mid-70% range.\nHowever, I fully expect this scarcity advantage to wane in the new year. AMD is rapidly increasing production of its chips and recently introduced its next-generation MI325X GPU.\nAdditionally, many of Nvidia's top customers by net sales are internally developing AI-GPUs to use in their data centers. Even though Nvidia's chips should remain superior from a computing standpoint, these internally developed GPUs are going to be substantially cheaper and easy to access. It's a recipe for Nvidia to lose valuable data center real estate, and for its pricing power and margin to decline.\nThe U.S. government can put the kibosh on the AI rally\nBesides history not being on the AI revolution's side, the AI rally could also be upended because of actions taken by U.S. regulators.\nIn 2022 and 2023, regulators under the Biden administration announced restriction on exports of high-powered AI chips and chip-related manufacturing equipment to China. This affects leading hardware producers like Nvidia, as well as the company's providing the equipment to produce AI solutions. For instance, semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment company Lam Research generated 37% of its revenue from China during the September-ended quarter, and 39% in the quarter before that.\nUnder President-Elect Donald Trump, it's unlikely we'll see these restrictions eased or lifted. Trump took a hardline stance toward the world's No. 2 economy during his first term as president, and this is likely to continue when he takes office on Jan. 20.\nTo add, Trump has opined that he'd impose a 35% tariff on imports into the U.S. from China on Day One. More than likely, this is going to prompt a trade war that strains trade relations between the world's two-largest economies and adversely affects AI product sales to China.\nAI stock valuations are an eyesore that can no longer be ignored\nThe final reason the AI bubble will burst in 2025 has to do with historically unsustainable valuation premiums that are currently being assigned to market-leading artificial intelligence stocks.\nOver the last 30 years, businesses on the leading edge of next-big-thing innovations have often topped out at multiple of 30 to 40 times trailing-12-month sales. This is where Amazon and Cisco Systems peaked before the dot-com bubble burst.\nIn 2024, we've witnessed Nvidia top a price-to-sales ratio (P/S ratio) of more than 40, while Palantir Technologies is currently pushing a P/S ratio of almost 69. Although it's impossible to predict when investor euphoria will fade, history has been crystal clear that extended valuations of this magnitude aren't sustainable over the long run.\nThough businesses with sustained moats, such as Nvidia and Palantir, are deserving of a premium valuation, relative to their peers, price-to-sales ratios of 29 for Nvidia and nearly 69 for Palantir make no sense."

      "text": "Over the span of a few months or a couple of years, directional moves in the benchmark indexes are no more certain than a coin flip.\nDespite these uncertainties, Wall Street has consistently provided a path for patient investors to grow their wealth. Since 2024 began, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have all hit fresh record-closing highs. Yet even with the bulls running wild on Wall Street, amazing deals can still be found for opportunistic, long-term-minded investors willing to seek them out.\nWhat makes putting your money to work on Wall Street even better is that most online brokers have tossed aside barriers that had previously kept retail investors on the sidelines. Gone are the days of minimum deposit requirements and commission fees for most common-stock trades. This means any amount of money -- even $600 -- can be the ideal amount to put to work.\nIf you have $600 that's ready to invest, and you're certain this isn't cash you're going to need to pay bills or cover emergency expenses as they arise, the following three stocks stand out as no-brainer buys right now.\nRealty Income\nThe first phenomenal company that would make for a surefire buy with $600 is retail real estate investment trust (REIT) Realty Income (O -0.04%). That's right income investors, I'm giving you a shout-out, as well as alerting you to an amazing company that's raised its payout for 106 consecutive quarters!\nThe reason Realty Income's stock chart looks like something of a horror show over the past year has to do with the Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary policy. Aggressive interest rate hikes designed to quell a historically high inflation rate in 2022 sent short-term Treasury yields soaring past 5%. Investors opted to put their money to work in less-volatile T-bills instead of REITs.\nHowever, the Fed's rate-hiking cycle looks to be over. While it's anyone's guess when the nation's central bank will begin easing rates, Treasury yields have already begun retracing. When coupled Realty Income's falling share price, the company's 5.8% yield is now more attractive.\nWhat makes Realty Income \"tick\" is its superior commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio. Following the completion of its Spirit Realty Capital acquisition in January, Realty Income has in excess of 15,450 CRE properties. The company estimates that 89% of its total rent is resilient to downturns in the U.S. economy.\nA significant percentage of its annualized contractual rent (~40%) is tied up in grocery stores, convenience stores, dollar stores, drug stores, and home improvement stores. These are stores that consumers are visiting regardless of whether the U.S. economy is expanding or contracting, which leads to steady rental revenue for Realty Income.\nBest of all, Realty Income has demonstrated its intent to diversify its revenue stream beyond just the retail industry. For instance, the aforementioned buyout of Spirit Realty Capital opens new lease streams. Further, the company closed two major deals in the gaming industry over the past two years.\nShares of Realty Income can be picked up at present for a multiple of 11.7 times forecast cash flow in 2025, which represents a 34% discount to its trailing-five-year multiple to cash flow.\nTeva Pharmaceutical Industries\nA second no-brainer stock that's begging to be bought with $600 right now is brand-name and generic-drug developer Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA 0.30%).\nThe previous seven years have not been easy for Teva or its shareholders. The company buried itself in debt by overpaying for generic-drug maker Actavis, dealt with the loss of exclusivity on blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone, and has worked its way through a litany of litigation concerning its role in the opioid crisis. Suffice it to say, there have been viable reasons why Teva stock has been clobbered.\nThe good news for current and prospective investors is that many of these gray clouds have cleared. In particular, the company forged a $4.25 billion opioid settlement with 48 U.S. states last year. Teva will pay this sum over 13 years, with up to $1.2 billion of this total coming from the delivery of overdose-reversal drug Narcan.\nOne of the keys to Teva's multiyear turnaround efforts has been its ability to cut its expenses and de-lever its balance sheet. Under prior CEO Kare Schultz, the company disposed of noncore assets and shed north of $3 billion in annual operating expenses.\nCurrent CEO Richard Francis is continuing this trend. Teva's intended divestiture of its active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) segment will free up capital, hone its operating focus, and allow it to further reduce its net debt. Since closing the Actavis deal in August 2016, Teva's net debt has declined from around $35 billion to a more manageable $16.6 billion, as of Dec. 31, 2023.\nThe other key to Teva's success is its operating transformation that devotes more of its research and capital to novel therapeutics. Although brand-name drugs have finite periods of sales exclusivity, the growth rates and margins associated with them are considerably higher than generic drugs. Novel therapies like tardive dyskinesia drug Austedo, which is on pace for $1.5 billion in sales this year after recording $1.23 billion in sales in 2023, should help fuel Teva's growth.\nConsidering that Teva's sales are expected to expand in 2025 and beyond, a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 5 is nothing short of a bargain.\nBlock\nThe third no-brainer stock you can confidently buy with $600 right now is none other than fintech innovator Block (XYZ -0.52%).\nAs you'll note from its stock chart, Block has taken shareholders on quite the ride. It was pumped up during the COVID-19 pandemic by the prospect of consumers and businesses shifting to digital payments. But over the past two years, it's been beaten down by growing competition in the digital payment arena. Though this competition is still growing, competitive advantages should aid the sustained double-digit expansion of Block's bottom line.\nBlock's foundation for more than a decade has been its Square ecosystem. This is the segment that provides point-of-sale payment and funding solutions to merchants. In 2023, gross payment volume (GPV) traversing its network reached nearly $210 billion, which represents 13% currency-neutral growth from the previous year.\nBut the real story here is that Square's payment solutions are becoming more popular with larger businesses. During the December-ended quarter, 40% of Square's GPV can be traced back to businesses generating at least $500,000 in annualized GPV. What this shows is that Square is \"growing up\" as a payment facilitation tool and landing bigger fish. Since Square is predominantly a transaction-driven platform, higher utility from bigger businesses should translate into steady gross profit growth.\nThe other segment that's expected to drive Block's cash flow and profits substantially higher throughout the remainder of the decade (and beyond) is Cash App. As of the end of 2023, Cash App had 56 million active customers (that's up from 7 million just six years prior), along with 23 million monthly active Cash App Card users. Cash App Card directly links to a users' Cash App account. The cost to acquire new Cash App users has historically been dwarfed by the gross margin Block generates from its Cash App collective.\nThe prospect for a decline in interest rates may also provide a further lift to Block's Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) platform. Block enjoyed a 25% surge in BNPL GPV during the fourth quarter to $8.6 billion.\nThe final piece of the puzzle is Block's attractive valuation. Shares can be purchased right now for 19 times forward-year earnings despite the expectation that adjusted earnings per share (EPS) will nearly double between 2024 and 2027."

      "text": "The amount of data thrown investors' way can be overwhelming at times. Between earnings season -- the six-week period where most S&P 500-listed companies report their quarterly operating results -- and economic releases from the U.S. government, it can be tough to stay on top of Wall Street's market-moving events.\nFor example, investors might overlook the quarterly filing of Form 13Fs with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is, arguably, right up there in importance with earnings and economic data releases.\nA 13F is a required filing no later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter by institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management (AUM). This filing provides an under-the-hood look at which stocks Wall Street's brightest money managers purchased and sold in the latest quarter. Though 13Fs can paint a stale picture for very active hedge funds, they're usually insightful in the sense that they can help investors spot the stocks and trends piquing the interest of Wall Street's leading asset managers.\nBillionaire Warren Buffett is the stock market's most-famous and followed money manager -- but he's not the only billionaire known for his keen investing insights and ability to generate big profits. Investors also pay close attention to billionaire fund manager David Tepper of Appaloosa, who's overseeing north of $8 bullion in AUM, as of March 31.\nWhat's made Tepper so popular has been his willingness to put his fund's capital to work in the high-growth tech stocks that have led the current bull market rally on Wall Street. But you might be surprised to learn that Appaloosa's billionaire chief has been a pretty persistent seller of three \"Magnificent Seven\" components over the previous year (March 31, 2024 \u2013 March 31, 2025), and an avid buyer of a double-digit growth stock with a burgeoning addressable market.\nDavid Tepper is sending shares of three market leaders to the chopping block\nForm 13Fs show that Tepper has cashed in his chips (partially or fully) on a number of high-growth tech stocks from the end of March 2024 to the close of March 2025. But the selling activity that stands out most has to do with members of the Magnificent Seven. Over 12 months, Tepper reduced his fund's positions in:\n- Nvidia (NVDA -0.44%) by 93%, or 4,120,000 shares. (accounting for Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split in June 2024)\n- Meta Platforms (META -0.49%) by 51%, or 572,500 shares.\n- Amazon (AMZN -0.70%) by 34%, or 1,318,000 shares.\nIt's also worth mentioning that Tepper has cut his fund's position in Alphabet, specifically the Class C shares (GOOG), by 3%, as well as purchased put options on Apple.\nTo be fair, this selling activity in Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Amazon might be nothing more than simple profit-taking. These companies have led the market higher, and Tepper has absolutely demonstrated a willingness to ring the register and lock in profits when the opportunity presents itself. The concern is there may be more to this selling than just profit-taking.\nPerhaps the biggest worry is that Nvidia, Meta, and Amazon sport downside risk if an artificial intelligence (AI) bubble were to form and burst. Despite AI being the hottest trend on Wall Street since the advent of the internet roughly three decades ago, there hasn't been a next-big-thing innovation during this span that's avoided a bubble-bursting event. Investors consistently overshoot when it comes to early stage adoption and utility, and that'll likely be the case, yet again, with artificial intelligence.\nThe silver lining for Meta Platforms and Amazon is that their businesses were thriving well before the AI revolution. Meta brings in almost 98% of its net sales from advertising, while Amazon's rapidly growing cloud infrastructure service platform (Amazon Web Services), advertising services, and subscription services, would fare just fine if AI investments slowed. The same can't be said for Nvidia, whose AI-graphics processing units are the backbone of AI-accelerated data centers and the company's primary growth driver.\nAppaloosa's billionaire chief may also have valuation concerns. While Meta and Amazon aren't valued at egregious multiples, Nvidia is tipping the scales at a trailing-12-month (TTM) price-to-sales (P/S) ratio above 26. That's more than double its peers and historically not a sustainable multiple.\nFurthermore, the S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio entered 2025 at one of its priciest earnings multiple dating back 154 years. The five previous times the Shiller P/E has topped and sustained a multiple of 30 have, eventually, led to declines of 20% or more in Wall Street's major stock indexes. The Mag-7 stocks would likely endure significant selling pressure if the market rolls over.\nThis is the stock billionaire David Tepper can't stop buying\nHowever, Tepper has been doing some selective buying over the last year. Excluding options contracts, he's added 10 new positions to his fund and increased his stake in six other securities (stocks and exchange-traded funds, better known as ETFs).\nNone of these new purchases or additions stands out more than ride-sharing colossus Lyft (LYFT 0.37%). Between March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, Appaloosa's billionaire investor increased his stake by 8,532,382 shares, or 1,825%.\nIt's worth pointing out that while Lyft made up 1.3% of Appaloosa's invested assets at the end of March, chief ride-share rival Uber Technologies (UBER 1.14%) accounted for 2.8% of invested assets. In other words, this doesn't look to be Tepper choosing one company over the other. Rather, it appears to be a direct wager on rapid growth in ride-sharing.\nAs you might imagine, growth forecasts for the ride-sharing market are all over the map (pun fully intended). According to Stratis Research, the global ride-sharing market is projected to roughly 10X from an estimated $87.7 billion in sales in 2025 to a little north of $918 billion come 2033. This works out to a compound annual growth rate of 21% and is more than enough reason for Tepper to be excited about the two biggest players in ride-share space.\nBut there are company-specific reasons Tepper chose to increase Appaloosa's stake in Lyft by more than 1,800% over the last year. One of those reasons is the company's much-improved key performance indicators. In the latest reported quarter (ended March 31), total rides climbed 16% to 218.4 million from the prior-year period, active riders jumped 11%, and gross bookings totaled $4.2 billion. In simple terms, Lyft is attracting more riders, and its active customers are using the service more frequently.\nArguably even more important than attracting new and return customers has been Lyft's operating cash flow. John Risher made it a point to improve the company's operating cash flow since taking over as CEO in April 2023. In two years, we've witnessed a complete 180, with Lyft now generating robust net cash from operations.\nWith Lyft decisively profitable and its cash flow rapidly expanding, it looks to be a much more attractive way to invest in the ride-sharing space than Uber Technologies. Mind you, Uber has a decisive market share lead, and with that typically comes some degree of valuation premium. But is Uber worth 4.3 times TTM sales while Lyft trades at a P/S ratio of just 1.1? Either Uber stock has gotten ahead of itself or Lyft is an attractive bargain.\nAdditionally, Lyft is leaning into digital advertising as a way to diversify its revenue stream and bolster its margins. Sponsorships that show up in maps or in \"Sponsored Rides by Mode\" offer a way for businesses to target users with their message(s), and for Lyft to put extra dollars in its coffers.\nThough Lyft hasn't demonstrated its ability navigate an organic recession, it does bring an intriguing growth story to the table that's clearly piqued the interest of one of Wall Street's most-prominent billionaire money managers."

      "text": "Roughly three decades ago, the advent and proliferation of the internet began changing corporate America forever. Although it took many years before businesses figured out how to optimize their internet usage to maximize their margins and profits, it became a game-changing technology that helped companies reach new customers.\nFor 30 years, Wall Street and investors have been waiting for the next technological leap that could catapult corporate growth. After a long wait, artificial intelligence (AI) looks to be the answer.\nWith AI, software and systems are given the capacity to make split-second decisions without human assistance. It's a broad-reaching technology that the analysts at PwC believe can increase global gross domestic product by a whopping 26% come 2030.\nWhile a laundry list of businesses has benefited from the AI revolution, none has reaped the rewards of this technological leap forward more than semiconductor titan Nvidia (NVDA -0.44%). Since the end of 2022, Nvidia's market cap has catapulted from $360 billion to an all-time closing high of $3.76 trillion, as of June 25.\nBut according to one highly optimistic Wall Street analyst, the stock market's AI darling is just warming up and on its way to a greater than $6 trillion valuation.\nNvidia has a new highwater price target\nTo be fair, buy ratings are a dime a dozen when it comes to Nvidia. As of June, 66 Wall Street analysts had issued a rating on Nvidia, with a combined 58 listing it as the equivalent of a strong buy or buy. That compares with just one sell rating.\nHowever, the June 25 update from Loop Capital analyst John Donovan stands out from the crowd for one particular reason: His and his firm's price target is head and shoulders above everyone else's. Donovan lifted Loop Capital's price target for Nvidia from $175 per share to $250. If Nvidia's share count stays static, we're talking about a $6.1 trillion market cap if Donovan's issued price target is achieved.\nNvidia is already the undisputed leader in graphics processing units (GPUs) deployed in AI-accelerated data centers. The company's Hopper (H100) and successor Blackwell GPUs have consistently been backlogged due to overwhelming demand. With demand for AI-GPUs handily outpacing their supply, Nvidia has been able to charge a premium for its hardware, which in turn has sent its gross margin to north of 70%.\nBut Donovan only sees this dominance building. In his note to investors that explained Loop Capital's Street-high price target, Donovan pointed to Nvidia shipping an estimated 6.5 million GPUs this year and 7.5 million next year, with average selling prices for these GPUs topping $40,000. For context, Nvidia has enjoyed a 100% to 300% pricing premium over its AI-GPU direct rivals.\nMore specifically, in speaking with various cloud-service providers, Donovan anticipates that an uptick in data center spending from governments, midsize cloud providers, and startup companies can lead to the next wave of supercharged growth for Nvidia. For instance, CoreWeave's purchase of 250,000 Hopper chips is the perfect example of startups angling to capitalize on the presumed insatiable demand for compute capacity.\nThe other factor working in Nvidia's favor is that it's been able to grow into its valuation over the last year. Given the company's torrid sales and profit growth, Nvidia is trading at a forward-year earnings multiple of only 27 for fiscal 2027, which will end in January 2027.\nIf Loop Capital's dart throw proves accurate, Nvidia can tip the scales as Wall Street's first $4 trillion, $5 trillion, and $6 trillion business.\nLoop Capital's optimism overlooks some very tangible headwinds\nWhile there's no disputing Nvidia's monopoly-like market share of GPUs being deployed in AI-accelerated data centers, there are a couple of tangible headwinds Donovan appears to be overlooking that can send Nvidia stock in the opposite direction.\nArguably the biggest issue for Nvidia is that every game-changing technology and innovation needs ample time to mature, and we're not at that point yet with artificial intelligence.\nIncluding the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, there hasn't been a next-big-thing trend in three decades that's escaped a bubble-bursting event early in its expansion. The fact that most businesses aren't generating a positive return on their AI investments, nor have they optimized their existing AI solutions, suggests that investors have grossly overestimated the early-innings adoption rate and utility of this technology. This bodes poorly for Nvidia stock over the short run.\nIt's also impossible to overlook growing competitive pressure. Don't get me wrong, CEO Jensen Huang's aggressive innovation timeline, which will bring a new advanced GPU to market annually, should have no trouble keeping Nvidia in the lead when it comes to compute potential. But there's more to data center infrastructure than just speed.\nIt can be argued that Nvidia's biggest competitive edge has been the persistent scarcity of AI-GPUs. But with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ramping up its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity and Advanced Micro Devices upping its production of Instinct series AI-accelerating chips, direct competition is growing.\nWhat's more, many of Nvidia's top customers by net sales are internally developing GPUs to use in their data centers. Even though this internally developed hardware trails Nvidia's Hopper and Blackwell in terms of compute potential, it's notably cheaper and more readily accessible (i.e., not backlogged). Internally developed chips could easily take up valuable data-center real estate, delay future upgrade cycles, and pressure Nvidia's gross margin.\nLastly, Donovan's research overlooks the sustained priciness of Nvidia stock relative to its trailing-12-month (TTM) sales.\nOver the past three decades, megacap companies on the leading edge a next-big-thing trend have historically topped out at TTM price-to-sales (P/S) ratios of roughly 30 to 43. Even Nvidia topped out at a TTM P/S multiple of just over 42 last summer. Although the company's rapidly expanding sales has brought this multiple down, it's still tipping the scales at a P/S ratio of almost 26. That's well over double other market-leading \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, and history strongly suggests it's not sustainable."

      "text": "Over the last century, no asset class has come particularly close to outpacing the average annual return of the stock market. But just because stocks have proved to be a bona fide wealth creator, it doesn't mean there aren't hiccups along the way.\nBased on data from market insights firm Yardeni Research, there have been 40 corrections of at least 10% in the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC -0.25%) since the start of 1950. This works out to a double-digit percentage decline occurring, on average, every 1.9 years. The stock market wouldn't be a \"market\" without the ability for stocks to move in both directions -- and these dips are normal, healthy, and inevitable.\nOn occasion, these swings in equities can become eye-popping. Over the last two weeks, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have all registered their respective largest-ever single-session point gain, as well as some of their biggest single-day point losses on record. The S&P 500, for instance, logged its fifth-largest two-day decline in 75 years on April 3 and April 4 -- a loss of 10.5%.\nHistory has shown that wild vacillations in the stock market can be the ideal time for investors to go shopping. It can be an especially attractive time to scoop up fast-growing companies at a discount.\nWhat follows are three supercharged growth stocks you'll regret not buying amid historic stock market volatility.\nBlock\nThe first high-octane growth stock you'll be happy you added amid a period of turbulence for Wall Street is fintech up-and-comer Block (XYZ -0.52%).\nBlock's rock-solid foundation is built atop the Square ecosystem. This is the company's digital payment network for merchants, which also offers data analytics and loans, among other tools. Gross payment volume (GPV) surpassed $227 billion in 2025, with GPV growth consistently in the high single digits. The international expansion of the Square ecosystem, along with its ability to attract larger merchants, is a recipe for sustained growth and higher gross profit from this operating segment.\nHowever, Block's long-term growth story and juiciest margins are tied to the success of Cash App. When 2019 came to a close, Cash App had only 24 million monthly active users. As of the end of 2024, this figure had increased to 57 million monthly active users. The introduction of new payment solutions, including buy now, pay later, represents one of the ways the Cash App digital payment ecosystem is going to grow in importance over time.\nHistorically, the gross profit per monthly active Cash App customer has trounced the cost of acquiring new customers to this substantially higher-margin segment. It's in Block's best interest to funnel product development and innovation to Cash App.\nValued at just over 10 times forward-year earnings, Block shares appear to be a screaming bargain.\nA second fast-paced growth stock you'll be kicking yourself for not buying during a historic bout of volatility on Wall Street is social media platform Pinterest (PINS -2.46%).\nAlthough Pinterest's monthly active user (MAU) count was whipsawed a bit during the COVID-19 pandemic, a wide-lens look at its MAUs shows a fairly steady incline. More users than ever before are visiting Pinterest on a monthly basis (553 million), which is translating into improved ad-pricing power for the company. Pinterest's ongoing expansion into overseas markets should only enhance its average revenue per user.\nWhat makes Pinterest such an intriguing social media stock from an investment standpoint is that it isn't bound by data-tracking tools. Whereas app developers now allow users to back out of data-tracking, which can hurt the ability of advertisers to target users, the entire premise of Pinterest's platform is for its MAUs to willingly and freely share what interests them. This is relevant and valuable data the company can serve to advertisers on a silver platter. It may also position Pinterest to eventually become a jumping-off point for e-commerce sales.\nPinterest is sporting quite the treasure chest, as well. It closed out last year with north of $2.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, which is more than enough capital to invest in its platform, innovate for the future, and buy back some of its own shares.\nSimilar to Block, Pinterest's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12 is simply too cheap for investors to ignore.\nOkta\nThe third supercharged growth stock you'll regret not buying amid historic stock market volatility is cloud-based cybersecurity solutions provider Okta (OKTA -3.43%).\nOne of the smartest moves investors can make during periods of turbulence on Wall Street is to put their money to work in companies that can thrive in any economic climate. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses have accelerated the pace by which they're moving their data and that of their clients online and into the cloud. Cybersecurity solutions have evolved into a basic necessity over time, and third-party providers like Okta are increasingly being relied on to keep this data safe from hackers.\nOkta has made its mark as a provider of identity verification solutions. Its suite of products relies on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to become more efficient at spotting and responding to potential threats over time. While cloud-based AI and ML platforms have their own learning curve, they've proved to be nimbler than on-premises solutions.\nPerhaps more importantly, Okta ended fiscal 2025 (Jan. 31, 2025) with a record $4.22 billion in remaining performance obligations, which is effectively the company's backlog. This figure has been steadily growing by a double-digit percentage, with Okta also landing larger clients. Since subscription-driven cybersecurity models generate high margins, Okta's subscription margin should approach 80% over time.\nLastly, Okta's forward P/E ratio is below 29. Though this is still a bit pricier than the forward P/E of the S&P 500, Okta is growing faster than the average S&P 500 company and its products have evolved into a basic necessity. In other words, it's worth the premium."

      "text": "It costs money to make money. Every successful business keeps its costs below revenue to generate profits. One way to measure a company's profitability is to calculate its gross margin, which is the percentage of revenue it retains after subtracting the costs directly related to the sale of goods or services.\nWe'll take a closer look at this profitability measure by exploring:\n- What is gross margin?\n- How to calculate gross margin.\n- Gross margin vs. gross profit: What is the difference?\n- How to use gross margin to evaluate a company.\n- What are the limitations to gross margin?\nWhat is it?\nWhat is gross margin?\nGross margin -- also called gross profit margin or gross margin ratio -- is a company's sales minus its cost of goods sold (COGS), expressed as a percentage of sales. Put another way, gross margin is the percentage of a company's revenue that it keeps after subtracting direct expenses such as labor and materials. The higher the gross margin, the more revenue a company has to cover other obligations -- like taxes, interest on debt, and other expenses -- and generate profit.\nHow to calculate\nHow to calculate gross margin\nThe computation for gross margin is a two-step process. First, you need to determine a company's gross profit, which is a straightforward calculation:\nGross profit = Revenue-COGS\nYou can find the revenue and COGS numbers in a company's financial statements.\nYou can then use the gross profit number to determine gross margin:\nAs an example of how to calculate gross margin, consider a company that during the most recent quarter generated $150 million in sales and had direct selling costs of $100 million. The company's gross profit would equal $150 million minus $100 million, or $50 million, during this period.\nWe can use the gross profit of $50 million to determine the company's gross margin. Simply divide the $50 million gross profit into the sales of $150 million and then multiply that amount by 100. The gross margin for this example company is 33.3%.\nGross margin vs. gross profit\nGross margin vs. gross profit: What is the difference?\nThere can be some confusion between gross margin and gross profit. Gross profit is a measure of absolute value, while gross margin is a ratio. Gross profit is simply the difference between a company's sales and its direct selling costs, and a company's gross margin is its gross profit expressed as a percentage of sales. Gross margin puts gross profit into context by taking the company's sales volume into account.\nHow to use it\nHow to use gross margin to evaluate a company\nMargins are metrics that assess a company's efficiency in converting sales to profits. Different types of margins, including operating margin and net profit margin, focus on separate stages and aspects of the business. Gross margin gives insight into a company's ability to efficiently control its production costs, which should help the company to produce higher profits farther down the income statement.\nCalculating gross margin is useful for comparison purposes. Determining a company's gross margins for multiple reporting periods provides insight into whether the company's operations are becoming more or less efficient. Determining the gross margins of multiple companies within the same industry is another type of comparison, and it can help you to understand which market participants have the most efficient operations.\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations to gross margin?\nWhile calculating gross margin can be helpful for evaluating a company's reporting periods or similar companies, the metric has more limited value when comparing companies in different industries. Capital-intensive industries, like manufacturing and mining, often have high costs of goods sold, which translates to relatively low gross margins. Others, like the tech industry, that have minimal costs of goods typically produce high gross margins.\nRelated investing topics\nGross margin is a strong indicator of profitability\nDetermining gross margin is an easy and straightforward way to understand the core elements of a business. It's also a great way to get started when assessing any income statement. Gross margin is something that all investors should consider when evaluating a company before buying any stock."
