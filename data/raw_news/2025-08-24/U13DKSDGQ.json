  "title": "PLS CEO Talks Up Lithium Outlook After Posting Loss",
  "description": "PLS CEO Dale Henderson says the company is prepared if lithium prices stay low for longer, with over A$1 billion cash on hand. PLS posted a first loss in four years as a protracted lithium slump hit earnings.  (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "What happened? What happened? Well, F1 25 results, fantastic set of results. And what's it's been a very challenging part of the market cycle over the last 18 months with sort of same price declines. And we've been deep into the cost curve over this past year. But despite that, well, the year we've had has been the most transformational year record breaking production. We build out the base lower cost base operating platform, the P6 ATP 1000 project, and we also became a chemicals producer care of a joint venture with POSCO and South Korea. So we're now producing a battery grade hydroxide in South Korea and separate all of that while we went international with that first offshore acquisition care of the UP project in Brazil, care of the Latin resources transaction. So all of that happened this past year. So incredibly transformational year. And I should just say, well, we also ended the year with a very strong balance sheet, more than a billion cash. So we're an incredibly well put good position for this part of the cycle. Yeah, they are given that, you know, as you say, right, you definitely have come through with some bright spots as well, despite this protracted slump in lithium prices. I don't envy you lithium producers like you these days. Right. What is the strategy going to be moving forward if prices stay low? Sure. Well, we're kind of set up for that scenario. Even care of basically we've got this stronger operating base, a lower cost operating platform, care of the work we've been doing over the past year. So we're we're already a low cost operator now or even even more competitive. So that's the first thing. The second is our strong balance sheet. I mentioned more than $1,000,000,000 of cash, 1.6 billion in liquidity. We've got a very, very strong foundation if pricing is to be lower for longer. But it's hard to see that happening long term given that we've been deep into the cost curve for the last sort of at least the last a year. So that can't that just can't be sustained because, well, the world needs a lot more lithium. You know, the industry is compounding at something like a 30% growth rate here. It is a massive storage. Well, more supply has to come now that new supply is not being invested. And so we foresee tightness ahead. And of course, that sets up what we think is a perfect storm for Platts. And help us understand what. Obviously, there are things within the company's control. There are things that are not. Is a turnaround possible over the next 12 months? Anything's possible in the lithium market. Now, the recent price appreciation we saw the last four weeks, nobody was anticipating that. So we've seen a strong upward tick. And even with that upward tick look, we're still well below the consensus average of the expected long run price. So if you believe we're going to get to a long running price war, there's more to go just to get to there. But of course, as we've seen historically, lithium had a tendency to rally hard and go to some extremes. That may well happen again, but only time will tell. Is it possible we see prices go back to where it was in the last peak, or do you think that there's just too much capacity out there, Dale? Well, when you when you look back at the the characteristics of of the last page, it was a case of a shortfall of supply. It was a case of an inefficient market where price discovery was. And some of the mechanisms for price discovery weren't there. And we saw strong momentum buying. Well, fast forward to today. Well, a lot of those characteristics could well repeat because a lot of those same things are still here. We still have an inefficient pricing landscape. We have what we think is going to be a shortage of supply in the future. So it could well all happen again. Only time will tell. And Dale, just to pick your brain on, you know, what the Chinese are doing. As far as you know, you mentioned it's too much supply in this market, but you do see some shortness ahead. What do you think of their exercise there in terms of licenses and what the supply outlook is in mainland China for for lithium, for example? Do. Sure. So, you know, taking the announcements on face value, China's indicated they want to look at some of the approvals, a number of the supply sources. And and it's anticipated there'll be some supply curtailments as a function of of those approvals. And of course, the market is anticipating shortness because of that. And we've seen the price appreciation from from this point. So, you know, when we take it on face value, that all seems to stand to reason. And and the good news which flowed from that is it's jolted the pricing out of what was a very, very low price point and brought it some way up closer to what the long run average needs to be. But as I say, there's more to go. You mentioned about some of the products you're talking about in Downstream. Right. The one in South Korea, also a midstream project in Western Australia. Del, can tell us a bit more about other plans if the opportunity arose in Australia. Would you look further downstream? Yeah, the way we've thought about downstream as we think this is a very necessary link of the supply chain and we think that within the downstream link of the supply chain there'll be a spectrum of sort of low cost, highly profitable operations to the other end of the spectrum and everything in between. So for our company, we've always taken the view that, gee, if we can be involved at the right end of that, ask that supply chain, either the well positioned, profitable and well, that's a smart place for us to be for a multitude of reasons, to diversify our supply chain and create a more resilient supply chain and of course, to capture some more value for our shareholders, for our products. So with that end in mind, where we went and diversified kind of our joint venture with POSCO and we'll look to do more of that provided a proves up and provided it goes well. Now, how does it how does all this mean? And as it relates to Australia? Well, at the end of the day, the lithium market, it's a global market and a globally competitive market. So we'll continue to run the ruler on Australia, but it needs to stack up, it needs to be globally competitive. And historically when we've looked at it, it's been hard, hard to do that and, and hence why we were attracted to other locations like South Korea. But we'll continue to consider Australia. And Dale, final question for you. And speaking of the need to perhaps look at new areas, I mean, you guys in hard rock, lithium, are you ever going to consider going into brine, for example, because their core focuses is hard rock processing upstream and then to downstream? That's that's what our business has been built on. But we do have an open mind to diversifying potentially. But if we ever consider that, well, we'd probably do it in a very small way and a de-risked way as as we've done with our other diversification strategies like severe downstream partnership with POSCO, where we've got a minority interest, we would we'd probably look at something similar if we were to take a step in that direction. But it's certainly not a focus right now. The focus is about capitalizing on on the investment cycle we've just completed. We want to sweat. Yes. Prove those returns to our shareholders and sit there ready to enjoy what we think will be ultimately price appreciation in the future.",

However, the CEO suggested that the industry is growing at a 30% growth rate and that more supply is needed to come now that new supply is not being invested. He also highlighted the potential for a long-running price war, but noted that there is a tendency to rally hard and go to extremes, which may not be sustainable.",

Management sees short\u2011term price volatility but anticipates a long\u2011run rally as supply constraints and Chinese licensing curtailments drive prices toward the historical average. The company plans to deepen downstream integration, potentially expanding into other regions such as Australia, while remaining open to limited diversification into brine operations if it can be de\u2011risked.
