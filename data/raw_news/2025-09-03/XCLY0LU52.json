  "content": "The next season of Marvel Rivals will bring two new heroes to the team-based shooter: Angela and Daredevil. Developer NetEase Games confirmed Marvel Rivals' season 4 additions in a dynamic new animated trailer, one that also confirms that Angela will be absolutely jacked in the game. Damn.\n\nWhile the trailer for Marvel Rivals season 4 doesn't reveal much about how either character will play, it certainly implies that Angela is a Vanguard-class hero, based on her lats alone. But hopefully Matt Murdock going Super Saiyan in the trailer is an indication that the Man Without Fear will have an interesting twist to his gameplay.\n\nWe'll find out soon enough. Marvel Rivals season 4, aka The Heart of the Dragon, will launch on Sept. 12. If you've been keeping up with the story, here's where it's going, according to the trailer's official description:\n\nThe Timestream Entanglement has drawn the Seven Capitals together, forming the Heart of Heaven. After Knull\u2019s fall, Hela is imprisoned in the An'Hay-Zhidi, where Dizang\u2014Devil of the Eighth City\u2014dares her to atone for her sins. But Angela will not forgive her betrayal. She arrives in the Heart of Heaven demanding Hela be handed over, yet its guardian refuses to surrender someone under his protection. Justice will be served and a debt will be paid. But while they fight, an even greater danger stirs. Doctor Doom seeks to steal the Chronal Chi of the slumbering dragon Shou-Lao, threatening to unravel the fate of the Heavens themselves. Can Iron Fist protect the Immortal Dragon\u2026 or will Doom claim its power?\n\nAngela's history in Marvel Comics is an interesting one. Originally created by Neil Gaiman and Todd McFarlane for the Spawn universe in 1993, a legal dispute between Angela's creators wound up transporting her to the Marvel universe in 2013, where she was re-canonized to be Thor's sister.\n\nMarvel Rivals is available now on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. As NetEase Games' new trailer confirms, it's also coming to PlayStation 4.",
