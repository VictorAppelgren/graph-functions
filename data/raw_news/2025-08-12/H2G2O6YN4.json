  "title": "LISTEN: \u2018Grand Theft Auto 6\u2019 and the Pricing Debate in Gaming; Inside Variety\u2019s Emmy Extra Editions",
  "description": "As anticipation builds for 'Grand Theft Auto 6,' the latest 'Daily Variety' episode dives into the growing debate about pricing strategies for games.",
  "content": "As the gaming biz gears up for the dawn of \u201cGrand Theft Auto 6\u201d next year, there\u2019s a growing debate about pricing strategies for premium titles.\n\nJennifer Maas, Variety\u2018s senior business writer for TV and gaming, explains on the latest episode of \u201cDaily Variety\u201d podcast that $80 has become a flashpoint for the industry. Nintendo raised the bar earlier this year with the release of its \u201cMario Kart World\u201d game. Microsoft tried to follow that lead but wound up cutting the price for \u201cThe Outer Worlds 2\u201d back to the $70 benchmark that has been the standard for high-end titles for about five years.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s continued conversation surrounding pricing of games, what people are willing to pay for games, what\u2019s a fair price for games based on the amount of time put into making it,\u201d Maas explains. In her recent interview with Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick, she pressed him on the pricing question for the most anticipated game release in years, \u201cGrand Theft Auto 6,\u201d set to debut in May.\n\nTake-Two is keeping those details under wraps for now. But if ever there was a title that would support a higher pricetag, \u201cGTA 6\u201d is it. The anticipation is enormous and growing as it\u2019s been more than 10 years since \u201cGTA 5\u201d was first released.\n\n\u201cFor something like \u2018GTA 6,\u2019 they could certainly charge $80, but they could charge more than that and people will still pay it because this game is going to be so big,\u201d Maas observes.\n\nMaas also weighs in on a larger question: Why is \u201cGrand Theft Auto\u201d so popular? For one, it was one of the first games to breakthrough with casual game players as an entertainment experience that was not to be missed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of millennial nostalgia there. There\u2019s a lot of Gen X nostalgia there. It was one of the first like big games that got a lot of people into it, depending on how young you were at the time,\u201d Maas says. For many fans, \u201cGTA\u201d was \u201cthe first game where it felt like, OK, it\u2019s not a sports game. It\u2019s not a fighter. It\u2019s this other thing. It creates an immersive world. And what you could do in \u2018GTA\u2019 was very different from the traditional \u2018Zelda\u2019 or \u2018Mario\u2019 or playing a sports game. It was this other thing and this other product that probably drew in people who weren\u2019t traditional gamers, because the concept of the game on its own was interesting to them.\u201d\n\nAlso in the episode, Emily Longeretta, Variety\u2018s senior TV features editor, gives listeners a behind-the-scenes glimpse of how Variety\u2018s annual Emmy Extra Edition issues are assembled.\n\n\u201cMy best friend is an Excel doc and Word doc,\u201d Longeretta says of the process of organizing coverage by show, by award category and discipline and genre.\n\nVariety will publish a total of five standalone Extra Editions devoted to the Emmy Awards this month: Actor (Aug. 7), Actress (Aug. 11), Comedy (Aug. 14), Drama (Aug. 18) and Reality/Documentaries/Game Show (Aug. 19). Prior to this year\u2019s Emmy nominations announcement on July 15, we published no less than eight standalone Emmy Extra Editions.\n\nAfter the nominations are out, the playing field narrows and the lobbying for coverage during the voting period intensifies. Only someone who loves TV as much as Longeretta would thrive on this tough editing assignment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not lobbying for the huge stars. It\u2019s the lobbying for the supporting actors who got their first nomination ever,\u201d Longeretta observes. \u201cWhat I love about that it is that so many of the freelancers we work with and with the staff that we have, so many people pitch me. \u2018Can I talk to him?\u2019 \u2018Can I do that?\u2019 And it makes me excited to see people excited about these shows.\u201d\n\nListen to Daily Variety on iHeartPodcasts, Apple Podcasts, Amazon Music, Spotify and other podcast platforms.",

      "text": "Brian Tyree Henry \u2018Found Tools\u2019 to Face His \u2018Demons.\u2019 Then Came \u2018Dope Thief\u2019\nAs a kid, Brian Tyree Henry was blind for about a week. Well, not really, but he really committed to pretending, just as he did when he adopted a British accent for days or started his own sign language.\nHenry grew up with four much older sisters, which propelled him to grow up fast. \u201cI was always trying to catch up with the adults,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAnd instead of asking questions I would observe and then go do it.\u201d\nBut he also clung to the fun of childhood, especially since he needed to both entertain himself and strive to get attention. He\u2019d rearrange the furniture to act out scenes he\u2019d learned from his favorite babysitter, a.k.a. television. (Nickelodeon took him from \u201cThe World of David the Gnome,\u201d which is \u201cstill one of my favorite shows,\u201d to \u201cThe Dick Van Dyke Show.\u201d) He also transformed a dollhouse into a movie set. \u201cMy sisters would say, \u2018Why is this house upside down?\u2019 and I\u2019d say, \u2018Oh, there was a hurricane,\u2019\u201d he says.\nPopular on Variety\nGrowing up this way is \u201cdefinitely a big part of why I act,\u201d says Henry. Just as at home, Henry has garnered attention for performances without being the star of the show. He earned Tony nominations (for \u201cLobby Hero\u201d), an Oscar nod (\u201cCauseway\u201d) and two Emmy nods (\u201cThis Is Us\u201d and \u201cAtlanta\u201d), but all were in supporting or guest roles. Finally, with Apple TV+\u2019s \u201cDope Thief,\u201d he\u2019s now carrying the show and it has led to his third Emmy nod, his first for lead actor.\nIn previous interviews previewing \u201cCauseway\u201d and then for \u201cDope Thief,\u201d Henry struck me as thoughtful and hyper-articulate about the projects he\u2019s in and the characters he plays, but also so open about how his personal pain and vulnerability fed his acting. (His mother, with whom he was close, died in a car accident while he was finishing the first season of \u201cAtlanta\u201d; his \u201cCauseway\u201d character lost a leg in a car accident. In \u201cDope Thief,\u201d Ray has a tumultuous relationship with his father; Henry lived with his father during middle and high school but says he never had a male role model and was working through his own traumas by playing Ray. Then his own father died while the series was filming.)\nBut during this most recent video interview, he\u2019s happy and relaxed \u2014 grateful for reaching this next level, determined to keep ascending and also smart enough to savor it all, several times mentioning the camaraderie he found with fellow nominees.\nFor Henry, who has had to prove himself in an industry that doesn\u2019t always offer substantial roles for Black actors, this nomination is especially meaningful. Early in his career, he says, people would say to actors of color that they should just be grateful to be doing this at all.\n\u201cBut that wasn\u2019t enough for me. I knew that I had a voice, and I knew that I had my own place,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m quite proud of the progression and to have this lead nomination under my belt. Now Jake [Gyllenhaal] and Colin [Farrell] and Stephen [Graham] are also my peers. This is great.\u201d\nHe\u2019s also in a better place emotionally and now views his role as being able to grant some grace to his characters. \u201cI\u2019ve found tools to battle my demons, I\u2019ve figured out how to walk my walk, so I was just constantly trying to just get Ray to a place to be on the other side of it all,\u201d Henry says. \u201cThat\u2019s why the ending is a cry of surrender and salvation. I\u2019ve taken enough of a journey now and I\u2019m in a place where I\u2019ve learned how to be. If the part of Ray came to me six years ago, I\u2019d have been no help to him. But now I want to say to him, \u2018Hey, look, man, it\u2019s going to be all good.\u2019 I know that sounds crazy.\u201d\nHenry, who split his childhood between his divorced parents and between Fayetteville, N.C., and Washington, D.C., didn\u2019t start acting until college, but in high school, he did enjoy performing \u2014 in speech and debate, show choir and marching band. At Morehouse College, he was a business major until he was encouraged by a friend to audition for \u201cAntigone.\u201d After that, he landed a major role in August Wilson\u2019s \u201cJoe Turner\u2019s Come and Gone.\u201d\n\u201cThat was the best experience ever,\u201d he says, especially because he got to perform the scene for Wilson when the playwright was honored in a ceremony at the school. Soon after, Henry was getting his MFA at the Yale School of Drama. Hanging out in front of a bar late one night he saw Wilson (whose play \u201cRadio Golf\u201d was there) walk by and summoned the courage to introduce himself.\n\u201cIn my mind, it was like meeting Gandhi or the pope,\u201d he says. They chatted about their Morehouse encounter. The next day, Yale dean James Bundy called Henry in to say that Wilson told Bundy that accepting Henry to the program was the best decision he\u2019d ever made. \u201cThat was hands down one of the best moments in my life.\u201d\nSoon after, Henry was sleeping on an air mattress with a slow leak in the furthest reaches of Brooklyn, stealing cable from neighbors, eating bologna sandwiches and collecting bus transfers to help with his commute to Manhattan\u2019s theaters. While he admits there were times when he \u201cquestioned whether it was sustainable,\u201d he loved it all. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t know what else I was meant to do.\u201d\nHe believes those experiences informed his acting and says that even years later, he was drawing on that uncertainty and the need to hustle for Ray in \u201cDope Thief.\u201d\n\u201cDope Thief\u201d creator Peter Craig says Henry brought so many layers to the character. \u201cHe was better than I thought anybody could be at playing a defense system, and the person behind the defense system,\u201d says Craig. \u201cHe has so much intelligence both emotionally and analytically so he knew how to show Ray was one kind of construct when he was in fight or flight but was a completely different person underneath.\u201d\nCraig also praised the actor\u2019s commitment and depth, both as an actor and an executive producer. \u201cHe was foundational in terms of producing \u2014 a lot of the crew came from Brian\u2019s recommendations from \u2018Atlanta\u2019 and they were some of the pillars of the crew.\u201d\nHenry relished the producing role, saying the collaborative side harkened back to his theater roots but adding that he enjoyed being able to advocate for anyone who needed him. \u201cIt brings out a different side of you,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen every kind of set, and I wanted everyone who signed up to tell this story with me to know that they were safe, protected and that they made the right choice.\u201d\nHe also wants people to see his name on something as an executive producer or an actor as a sign of quality and integrity. \u201cI want my name to be synonymous with really great stuff so when they see I\u2019m a part of something they want to tune in,\u201d he says, because everything may not work perfectly but it should always be compelling and ambitious.\n\u201cIf you see Tilda Swinton is in something \u2014 even if she\u2019s playing a statue and not speaking \u2014 you know it\u2019ll be interesting,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of stuff I want to create. I want to be a leading man with great character arcs in great stories, but I also want people to see my name and just say, \u2018OK, we are gonna go on this ride.\u2019\u201d"

Amidst all of the uproarious surprise appearances, the film also offers a subtle nod to late actor Cameron Boyce, who starred alongside Sandler in \u201cGrown Ups\u201d and \u201cGrown Ups 2\u201d before his untimely death in 2019.\n\u201cHappy Gilmore 2\u2019s\u201d tribute to Boyce comes in a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it moment when Sandler\u2019s titular character checks in for a tee time early in the film. When Happy approaches the desk, one of the workers is watching TV on his laptop and observant viewers will notice that the footage is from an episode of \u201cJessie\u201d featuring Boyce. It is a discreet reference, but one that numerous viewers have noticed and brought attention to on social media.\nThis marks the second time that Sandler paid tribute to the late actor in a film. Boyce was supposed to appear alongside Sandler in the 2020 film \u201cHubie Halloween.\u201d Instead, the film is dedicated to his memory, with the credits mentioning, \u201cIn loving memory of Cameron Boyce. Gone way too soon and one of the kindest, coolest, funniest, and most talented kids we knew. You live on forever in our hearts and are truly missed every day.\u201d\nPopular on Variety\nBoyce was a child actor who came up on Disney Channel, starring in the sitcom \u201cJessie\u201d as well as the \u201cDescendants\u201d movies. He also appeared in the 2008 films \u201cMirrors\u201d and \u201cEagle Eye,\u201d before playing Sandler\u2019s on-screen son in both \u201cGrown Ups\u201d films.

Thank you, Cameron, for all you gave to us. So much more was on the way. All our hearts are broken. Thinking of your amazing family and sending our deepest condolences.\u201d"

      "text": "Cate Blanchett on Her One Note When Joining \u2018Disclaimer,\u2019 Portraying a Victim of Abuse and How She Landed That Surprising \u2018Squid Game\u2019 Cameo\nCate Blanchett is no stranger to playing complicated, misunderstood women. But in Apple TV+\u2019s \u201cDisclaimer,\u201d Alfonso Cuaron\u2019s seven-part series about a documentarian whose deepest, darkest secrets come to light in a novel written by an unreliable narrator, the two-time Academy Award winner, and now three-time Emmy nominee, was tasked with embodying an embattled woman who loses control of her own story.\n\u201cThe challenge for me, and I suppose the painful reality, was that when you play a central character in a narrative, you invite an audience not necessarily to have empathy with you, but you invite them into your character\u2019s point of view,\u201d Blanchett says from her home in London. \u201cDisclaimer\u201d was the \u201cantithesis\u201d of that conventional wisdom, forcing Blanchett to sit in others\u2019 snap judgments of her character, Catherine Ravenscroft, until she finally reclaims her story in the harrowing finale.\n\u201cI, as an actor and as a character, was put inside a very small box that was slowly having the air squeezed out of it until I finally got to speak,\u201d explains Blanchett. \u201cAlfonso has impeccable judgment, but there was a conversation at one point where a certain scene wasn\u2019t going to be in the final edit. And I said, \u2018I think it\u2019s really important that the people hear that perspective, because we\u2019ve asked them to sit through Catherine\u2019s silence. She has to say why she didn\u2019t speak. Otherwise, we are robbing the audience of the full stop.\u2019\u201d\nPopular on Variety\nAt the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Cuar\u00f3n approached Blanchett about collaborating on an adaptation of Ren\u00e9e Knight\u2019s 2015 novel, which he had read before making \u201cRoma.\u201d It would be expanded into seven episodes \u2014 or, as the filmmaker likes to put it, seven \u201cchapters.\u201d After signing on as the star and an executive producer, Blanchett became heavily involved in each step of the production. But, much like the audience, the actor found herself being confronted with her \u201cown immediate judgments of characters\u2019 motivations.\u201d\n\u201cAlfonso was really engaged in the fact that there\u2019s this war at the moment \u2014 and it does feel like a battle, actually \u2014 for a singular truth, which I think is a really dangerous and rather pointless exercise, because truth is such a complex thing,\u201d Blanchett says. \u201cWe all know it\u2019s made up of so many different perspectives, and the ones that we lean into are often the most pre-digested, pre-masticated ones that are really easy to swallow and somehow make us feel like we\u2019re good people and the guardians of all knowledge and morality. We don\u2019t like those truths that make us feel uncomfortable about ourselves.\u201d\n\u201cDisclaimer\u201d specifically forces viewers to confront their own biases and the cultural vilification of so-called \u201cbad\u201d women. \u201cI think if you go back and watch it a second time, there\u2019s a crude picture of Catherine that the people were assembling for themselves that didn\u2019t have a lot to do with who she was or what she did, or the impact that she was having in the room,\u201d says Blanchett.\nThe truth was hiding in plain sight. For the first six episodes, viewers were led to believe that Catherine, while vacationing in Italy years earlier, had initiated a self-absorbed affair with a 19-year-old stranger named Jonathan (Louis Partridge), who ultimately died after saving Catherine\u2019s young son from drowning in the ocean.\nIn the finale, Catherine finally confronts Jonathan\u2019s father, Stephen (Kevin Kline), whose late wife, Nancy (Lesley Manville), had written the novel based on a false perception of her son\u2019s final days. But what really happened was that the night before his death, Jonathan had broken into Catherine\u2019s hotel room, forced her to pose for nude photographs, and then violently sexually assaulted her.\n\u201cI think to know that you were moving through and unpicking an audience\u2019s often intractable judgments of what had gone on was a profound relief,\u201d says Blanchett, who recalls feeling markedly lighter after shooting that extended, 40-page monologue all in one take.\nThe devastating final twist was a secret that Blanchett fought to keep, even if it made press next to impossible. \u201cThere are many tangential conversations I would\u2019ve loved to have had about what happens when you sit with abuse, and the various different ways that people bury this [trauma],\u201d she says. \u201cThe courage that it takes still in this day and age to stand up and say it, even after you\u2019ve been sitting on that shame, and the attendant shame that comes for people who are victims of abuse \u2014 I feel like it would\u2019ve been great to use the series in a way as a launchpad to talk about that stuff. You can\u2019t make that stuff happen, but I\u2019ve had quite a few people stop me in the proverbial supermarket to talk about that.\u201d\nWhile she is most renowned for headlining films, Blanchett says she is \u201cabsolutely\u201d looking to venture further into television. In 2020, she earned her first two Emmy nominations for FX\u2019s \u201cMrs. America,\u201d as both an actor and producer. Having always been actively involved in the development of a show, she is now \u201cparticularly keen\u201d to join a series \u201cthat is fully formed.\u201d\nBlanchett may get her wish sooner rather than later. Last year, she filmed a top-secret cameo for the final scene of Netflix\u2019s \u201cSquid Game,\u201d in which she played an unnamed American recruiter who the Front Man (Lee Byung-hun) acknowledges and sees playing ddakji with a homeless man in a back alley. The offer \u201ccame out of the blue,\u201d and Blanchett was given little context.\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s such a cult series and they were shooting in L.A. of all places, everyone was on a need-to-know basis,\u201d she recalls. She didn\u2019t even do a costume fitting; the production asked her to bring her own suit. \u201cI got a couple of storyboards. I had to [learn to] play the game very quickly. I had to practice and practice. I knew there were four or five setups that they were going to do, and I knew what they needed from every shot, and then I was given the sides. But it was one of the more mysterious jobs.\u201d\nThe surprise casting of a movie star of Blanchett\u2019s caliber suggests that Netflix is exploring new ways to keep the IP alive. Does this mean she is open to leading a potential English-language spinoff or sequel to \u201cSquid Game\u201d?\n\u201cI am wildly open to anything,\u201d Blanchett says, leaning back in her chair with a smirk. \u201cAnd in a world that is so beautifully, magically created like that, for sure. They\u2019re amazing world-builders, and that series has been eaten alive. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a corner of the globe that it hasn\u2019t touched in some way.\u201d\nWhile there has been speculation that David Fincher, Blanchett\u2019s \u201cThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button\u201d director, has pitched an English-language series set in the \u201cSquid Game\u201d universe, Blanchett doesn\u2019t have an answer. \u201cI mean, I\u2019d love to work with David again. It\u2019s been ages. But no, I don\u2019t know anything more than you do. I\u2019m not being coy. I really don\u2019t.\u201d\nThroughout her career, Blanchett insists she has always been more interested in choosing her various collaborators than playing a specific kind of character, and \u201cDisclaimer\u201d was no different. \u201cI guess that\u2019s why I\u2019ve played characters big and small in lots of different genres,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s more access to different audiences that I am really interested in, because you catch an audience on a different rhythm when they\u2019re at home watching something, or when they\u2019re on the train watching something on a smaller screen, or when they\u2019ve come to the theater. In the end, what I seek is that different connection with them.\u201d"
