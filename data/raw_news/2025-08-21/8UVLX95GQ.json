  "content": "Walmart\u2019s eCommerce momentum continues unabated, as price-conscious customers pivot to digital channels for everyday items, notably grocery.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nThe company\u2019s Thursday (Aug. 21) earnings release indicated that eCommerce sales were 26% higher than a year ago and digital sales for grocery were up double digits. Store-fulfilled delivery of grocery items were up 50%.\n\nThough a slight miss on earnings\u2014where costs are rising in the wake of tariffs\u2014sent shares lower by about 2% in intraday trading, the retail behemoth raised its full year guidance. Net sales are projected to grow in a range of 3.75% to 4.75% for the fiscal year. That\u2019s higher than the 3% to 4% range that had previously been in place.\n\nComparable sales in the quarter were up 4.6% in the U.S., outpaced by Sam\u2019s Club growth of at 5.9%.\n\nDuring the conference call with analysts, CEO Doug McMillon said that all segments posted eCommerce sales growth north of 20%, and overall, \u201csales were stronger than we expected when we started the quarter.\u201d Sales were positive across all general merchandise categories.\n\nAs for the marketplace, McMillon said: \u201cGlobally, we grew our marketplace by 17% and membership 0income by 15%. We grew global advertising by 46%, including VIZIO. Walmart Connect in the U.S. was up 31%, and that excludes VIZIO. These strong growth rates in our newer businesses continue to change the shape of our income statement,\u201d and boosted profits, in a move that overcomes tariff impacts.\n\nWith a nod to those tariffs, McMillon said: \u201cWe\u2019re doing what we said we would do. We\u2019re keeping our prices as low as we can for as long as we can. Our merchants have been creative and acted with urgency to avoid what would have been additional pressure for our customers and members. They\u2019ve done a terrific job managing pricing and mix across merchandise categories. They managed to generate rollbacks.\u201d\n\nMcMillon told analyst that spending by U.S. consumers has \u201cbeen generally consistent. We aren\u2019t seeing dramatic shifts. The way things have played out so far, the impact of tariffs has been gradual enough that any behavioral adjustments by the customer have been somewhat muted. But as we replenish inventory at post-tariff price levels, we\u2019ve continued to see our costs increase each week, which we expect will continue into the third and fourth quarters. Not surprisingly, we see more adjustments in middle- and lower-income households than we do with higher-income households.\u201d\n\nHe noted too, that \u201cin discretionary categories where item prices have gone up, we see a corresponding moderation in units at the item level as customers switch to other items or, in some cases, categories.\u201d\n\nMcMillon also told analysts that artificial intelligence (AI) remains a key focus, as the digital assistant Sparky, tied to the company\u2019s app, will develop agentic capabilities over time.\n\n\u201cAs we improve and scale Sparky, we\u2019ll make it even smarter and more personalized. It\u2019ll be the primary digital vehicle for discovery, shopping and for managing everything from reorders to returns \u2026 The other super agents we\u2019re building include one for associates that\u2019ll bring everything into one place, from scheduling to sales data. [There\u2019s also] one for our suppliers, sellers and advertisers that they will use to manage things like onboarding, orders and campaigns.\u201d\n\nCFO John Rainey said that the comp sales growth reflected \u201congoing share gains across key categories and all income cohorts, with upper-income households contributing the largest gains\u201d and said later in the call that membership fee income was up 15% across the enterprise. Sam\u2019s Club continued to see steady growth in member counts, renewal rates and increased penetration of Plus members, resulting in 7.6% membership income growth, while Walmart Plus membership income grew double digits, according to commentary.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m also really excited about the upcoming launch of our new One Pay Cash Rewards credit card, which should be available before the holiday\u201d shopping season, Rainey said.\n\nThe CFO added: \u201cIt is a kind of a nuanced earnings report given some of the cost pressures. But when you dig into the details, particularly of the eCommerce business, you look at things like membership growth of 16%, advertising growing 50% year over year, 30% in the U.S \u2026 You can go line by line and you can see why we\u2019re excited about the momentum in the business.\u201d\n\nAs he told analysts, \u201cwe are more than just a standard brick-and-mortar retail business. We have a much more diversified set of profit streams now that are both higher growing as well as higher margin.\u201d",
