  "content": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nAOL's dial-up internet is finally taking its last bow.\n\nYes, while perhaps a dinosaur by today's digital standards, dial-up is still around. But AOL says it's officially pulling the plug for its service on Sept. 30.\n\n\"AOL routinely evaluates its products and services and has decided to discontinue Dial-up Internet,\" AOL wrote in a brief update on its support site\u2014noting that dial-up and associated software \"optimized for older operating systems\" will soon be unavailable on AOL plans.\n\nAOL, formerly America Online, introduced many households to the world wide web for the first time when its dial-up service launched decades ago, rising to prominence particularly in the 90s and early 2000s.\n\nThe creaky door to the internet was characterized by a once-ubiquitous series of beeps and buzzes heard over the phone used to connect your computer online\u2014along with frustrations of being kicked off the web if anyone else at home needed the landline for another call, and an endless bombardment of CDs mailed out by AOL to advertise free trials.\n\nEventually, broadband and wireless offerings emerged and rose to dominance, doing away with dial-up's quirks for most people accessing the internet today.\n\nStill, a handful of consumers have continued to rely on internet services connected over telephone lines. In the U.S., according to Census Bureau data, an estimated 163,401 households were using dial-up alone to get online in 2023, representing just over 0.13% of all homes with internet subscriptions nationwide.\n\nAOL was the largest dial-up internet provider for some time, but not the only one to emerge over the years. Some smaller internet providers continue to offer dial-up today. Regardless, the decline of dial-up has been a long time coming. And AOL shutting down its service arrives as other relics of the internet's earlier days continue to disappear.\n\nMicrosoft retired video calling service Skype just earlier this year, for example\u2014as well as Internet Explorer back in 2022. And in 2017, AOL discontinued its Instant Messenger\u2014a chat platform that was once lauded as the biggest trend in online communication since email when it was founded in 1997, but later struggled to ward off rivals.\n\nAOL itself is far from the dominant internet player it was decades ago\u2014when, beyond dial-up and IMs, the company also became known for its \"You've got mail\" catchphrase that greeted users who checked their inboxes, as famously displayed in the 1998 film starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan by the same name.\n\nBefore it was America Online, AOL was founded as Quantum Computer Services in 1985. It soon rebranded and hit the public market in 1991. Near the height of the dot-com boom, AOL's market value reached nearly $164 billion in 2000. But tumultuous years followed, and that valuation plummeted as the once-tech pioneer bounced between multiple owners. After a disastrous merger with Time Warner Inc., Verizon acquired AOL\u2014which later sold AOL, along with Yahoo, to a private equity firm.\n\nAt the time Verzion announced that sale to in 2021, an anonymous source familiar with the transaction told CNBC that the number of AOL dial-up users was \"in the low thousands,\" down from 2.1 million when Verzion first moved to acquire AOL in 2015\u2014and far below peak demand seen back in the 90s and early 2000s. But beyond dial-up, AOL continues to offer its free email services, as well as subscriptions that advertise identity protection and other tech support.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Amid the hodgepodge of Verizon Media assets that Apollo Global Management is buying from Verizon \u2014 Yahoo Finance, TechCrunch, advertising technology, Yahoo Fantasy \u2014 there's one cash flow stream that will not die: AOL.\nThe famed internet company that once bought Time Warner for $182 billion and used to make billions of dollars annually selling dial-up modem access, still has a monthly subscription service called AOL Advantage.\nIn 2015, 2.1 million people were still using AOL's dial-up service. That revenue stream has dried up. The number of dial-up users is now \"in the low thousands,\" according to a person familiar with the matter.\nBut AOL still has a fairly lucrative base of customers who pay for technical support and identity theft services each month. There are about 1.5 million monthly customers paying $9.99 or $14.99 per month for AOL Advantage, said another person, who asked not to be named because the information is private. If average revenue per user is $10 per month, conservatively, that's $180 million of annual revenue.\nApollo announced Monday it's paying $5 billion for 90% of Verizon Media. The private equity firm doesn't have immediate plans to spin off or sell any of the Verizon Media Group assets, preferring to grow the collection through investment and management, said the people. Still, the long-term plan may involve finding different buyers for the collection of businesses after Apollo attempts to add value to the units, the people said.\nVerizon agreed to pay $4.4 billion for AOL in 2015 and $4.5 billion for Yahoo in 2017.\nWhile AOL has largely faded from popular culture, Yahoo still has about 150 million daily active users and nearly 900 million monthly active users.\nA spokesperson for Apollo declined to comment. A spokesperson for Verizon Media didn't immediately respond for comment.\nWATCH: Cramer on Verizon's deal to sell AOL, Yahoo to Apollo for $5 billion"
