  "content": "The US and EU have struck what is being billed as the largest trade deal in history, after talks in Scotland last month.\n\nSome details of the deal have emerged after the countries initially released only the framework for the agreement.\n\nThe announcement by President Donald Trump and EU chief Ursula von der Leyen offers clues about which sectors and groups could be hit hardest or have the most to gain.\n\nAfter promising new trade deals with dozens of countries, Trump has just secured the biggest of them all.\n\nIt looks to most commentators that the EU has given up more, with instant analysis by Capital Economics suggesting a 0.5% knock to GDP.\n\nThere will also be tens of billions of dollars pouring into US coffers in import taxes.\n\nBut headlines heralding the deal may not last long if critics point to recent inflation, jobs, growth and consumer confidence data as evidence that Trump's radical reshaping of the US economy is backfiring.\n\u2022 Why were US job numbers which riled Trump revised down by so much?\n\nOrdinary Americans are already aggrieved at the increased cost of living and this deal could add to the burden by hiking prices on EU goods.\n\nWhile not as steep as it could have been, the hurdle represented by a 15% tariff rate is still significant, and it is far more pronounced than the obstacles that existed before Trump returned to office.\n\nTariffs are taxes charged on goods bought from other countries. Typically, they are a percentage of a product's value. So, a 15% tariff means that a $100 product imported to the US from the EU will have a $15 dollar tax added on top - taking the total cost to the importer to $115.\n\nCompanies who bring foreign goods into the US have to pay the tax to the government, and they often pass some or all of the extra cost on to customers.\n\nStock markets in Asia and Europe rose after news first emerged of the deal framework.\n\nUnder the deal, the US will levy a 15% tariff on goods imported from the EU. While this rate is significant, it is less than what it could have been and at least offers certainty for investors.\n\nThe agreement is \"clearly market-friendly, and should put further upside potential into the euro\", Chris Weston at Pepperstone, an Australian broker, told AFP.\n\nThe deal will need to be signed off by all 27 members of the EU, each of which have differing interests and levels of reliance on the export of goods to the US.\n\nWhile some members have given the agreement a cautious welcome, others have been critical - hinting at divisions within the bloc, which is also trying to respond to other crises such as the ongoing war in Ukraine.",

      "text": "Why were US job numbers which riled Trump revised down by so much?\nPresident Donald Trump has fired the head of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) after the department revised down recent job numbers by more than 250,000.\nHe says the figures were \"rigged\" to make his administration \"look bad\".\nAlthough the latest revisions were bigger than usual, it is normal for the initial monthly number to be changed and it has happened routinely under both Democratic and Republican presidents.\nHow are the job figures collected?\nThe BLS head - known as the commissioner - plays no role in collecting the data or putting the numbers together, only stepping in to review the final press release before its published, according to former commissioners.\n\"My reaction was, 'That couldn't happen,'\" says Katharine Abraham, who served as BLS commissioner from 1993 to 2001, about Trump's claims that the numbers had been rigged.\n\"The commissioner doesn't have control over what the numbers are,\" she adds.\nThe jobs report from the BLS is based on two surveys \u2013 one that collects data from about 60,000 households and another from 121,000 public and private sector employers.\nThe estimates of job gains come from the survey of employers, often referred to as the establishment survey. It tends to be considered more reliable than the household survey because of its large sample size.\nA majority of the responses come from large firms, typically enrolled in a programme that automatically submits their employment information. BLS staff also run web surveys and telephone interviews.\n\"The initial estimates of payroll employment are a preliminary look at what occurred in each month,\" the BLS told BBC Verify.\n\"It is the quick but lower-resolution snapshot of what went on in the job market for a particular month. Because the revised estimates are based on more complete data, they create a higher resolution picture - and occasionally the revised data produce a different picture,\" it added.\nThe bureau updates the figures in the two months following the initial monthly estimate, as more responses come in. It also recalculates the numbers annually to incorporate data from unemployment insurance tax records.\n\"There are all of these career people who also have the data and if the commissioner were to try to change the numbers they would all know and it would get out,\" Prof Abraham says.\nHow unusual are the latest revisions?\nThe figures for May and June have been revised down by 125,000 and 133,000 respectively.\nThe 258,000 combined reduction total for the two month period represents the biggest change since records began, aside from the months in 2020 following the outbreak of the Covid pandemic.\nHowever, there are adjustments every month and large changes are not unprecedented.\nIn this case, many analysts were already expecting revisions to the June figures, which had showed an unusual rise in school employment during a month when most schools were about to close for the summer.\nLater responses also disproportionately reflect smaller firms, which are more vulnerable to changes in the economy such as tariffs, analysts note.\nThe May figure was adjusted down largely in response to the June revision and is consistent with other data showing a slowdown.\nIn records going back to 1979, the average monthly change to the jobs figures (either up or down) is 57,000, according to the BLS.\nBut revisions tend to get bigger during times of economic turmoil.\nAside from the most recent numbers and the 2020 Covid period, there have been eight other occasions since 2000 when the BLS revised down monthly job numbers by more than 100,000 - with most of these coming around the 2008 financial crisis.\nFor instance, there was a 143,000 reduction to the January 2009 figure when President Barack Obama was in office.\nThe BLS also said job gains for the entire year in 2009 were 902,000 lower than it first estimated - the largest full-year revision on record.\nThe jobs created in 2024 under President Joe Biden were revised down by 598,000, though that was a smaller change than the more than 800,000 initially estimated - an update which also caused political fallout.\nProf Abraham says updates are part of the process and she was not surprised to see such large revisions for May and June, given increased difficulty of collecting responses and lack of investment in new methods - and the wider slowdown in the economy, driven in part by new tariffs.\n\"It's always difficult when you're at a point where things may be changing and then you add to that the fact that staffing has been constrained and the agencies haven't had the resources to invest in following up with respondents the way they might have in the past,\" she says.\nHave there been problems with the data in the past?\nResponse rates have dropped significantly over the last decade, accelerating after the pandemic, raising concerns about the reliability of the data.\nFor example, the response rate for the establishment survey was less than 43% in March, compared with more than 60% a decade earlier.\nOther countries, including Canada, Sweden and the UK, have been wrestling with similar falls. Response rates to the labour force survey have fallen to roughly 20% in the UK.\nIn the US, the drop-off has sparked some efforts to explore new methods of data collection, including web-based surveys.\nBut the significance of the problem remains a matter of debate.\nA review by researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in March of this year, found that revisions in recent years were mostly in line with pre-pandemic patterns, which it said should be reassuring to those worried about reliability."

  "argos_summary": "The United States and the European Union have announced what is being billed as the largest trade deal in history, following talks in Scotland, with the U.S. agreeing to impose a 15% tariff on EU imports\u2014a rate that, while significant, is less than some had feared and is expected to generate tens of billions in revenue for the U.S. Treasury. Analysts suggest the deal may cost the EU about 0.5% of GDP and could raise prices for American consumers, potentially exacerbating inflation and dampening consumer confidence. The announcement has sparked mixed reactions within the EU, with some member states welcoming the certainty it brings to markets while others criticize the tariff and its broader economic implications amid other crises such as the war in Ukraine. In a separate but related context, President Trump fired the head of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics after the agency revised down recent job figures by over 250,000, a move that highlighted the normalcy of monthly revisions and the challenges of data collection amid declining response rates and economic turbulence.",
