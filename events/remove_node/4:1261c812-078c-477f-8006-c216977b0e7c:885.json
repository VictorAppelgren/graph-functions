    "reason": "The topic ‘Cultural Appropriation in Fashion’ is a social issue with no direct, actionable impact on macroeconomic variables or broad market movements. It does not provide a clear, timely signal for trading decisions or cross‑asset transmission, and thus does not meet the criteria for any of the importance levels. Therefore it should be removed from the macro‑market focus.",
