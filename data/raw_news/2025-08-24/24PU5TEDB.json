  "content": "Statistically speaking, long term investing is a profitable endeavour. But that doesn't mean long term investors can avoid big losses. For example, after five long years the Kawan Food Berhad (KLSE:KAWAN) share price is a whole 61% lower. That's not a lot of fun for true believers. We also note that the stock has performed poorly over the last year, with the share price down 42%. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 25% in the last three months.\n\nNow let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nWhile the share price declined over five years, Kawan Food Berhad actually managed to increase EPS by an average of 11% per year. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Or possibly, the market was previously very optimistic, so the stock has disappointed, despite improving EPS.\n\nBecause of the sharp contrast between the EPS growth rate and the share price growth, we're inclined to look to other metrics to understand the changing market sentiment around the stock.\n\nThe steady dividend doesn't really explain why the share price is down. While it's not completely obvious why the share price is down, a closer look at the company's history might help explain it.\n\nYou can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\n\nIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. If you are thinking of buying or selling Kawan Food Berhad stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Kawan Food Berhad the TSR over the last 5 years was -56%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!",

  "argos_summary": "Kawan Food Berhad\u2019s share price has fallen sharply\u2014down 61% over five years and 42% in the past year\u2014yet the company\u2019s earnings per share have grown an average of 11% annually, indicating a disconnect between market sentiment and fundamentals. Total shareholder return over five years is -56%, partly because dividends do not offset the price decline. Forecasts project earnings growth of 17.3% and revenue growth of 6.9% per year, with an expected EPS growth of 16.1% and a modest 9.8% return on equity, suggesting potential upside if the market realigns with the company\u2019s improving fundamentals.",
