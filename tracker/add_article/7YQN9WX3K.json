      "summary": "Russia announced the capture of the villages of Sredneye and Kleban-Byk in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region, marking a further push toward Kostiantynivka and the logistics hub at Kramatorsk. Ukrainian forces countered by recapturing Zeleny Gai, while Russia had earlier claimed three villages. Amid these developments, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa urged a Russia‑Ukraine summit, joining calls from other world leaders, but Russian officials denied any meeting plans and the United States’ Trump‑led mediation efforts appear stalled. The conflict continues to intensify as global leaders seek diplomatic solutions.",
