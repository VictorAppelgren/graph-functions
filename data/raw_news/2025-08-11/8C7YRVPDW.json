      "text": "Published\n- 10 min read\nEko 2.0 Now Available: Faster, Smarter Agentic Workflow Framework\nThe future of work isn\u2019t just about having intelligent tools\u2014it\u2019s about having tools intelligent enough to adapt and recover on their own, while possessing the performance and scale to handle complex production-grade task scenarios. Today marks an important moment in that evolution. Eko 2.0 represents more than an incremental update; it\u2019s a dual breakthrough in both capability boundaries and execution efficiency for Agentic Workflow Frameworks.\nEko 2.0: Building the Foundation for Powerful Agentic Workflows\nWhen we launched Eko 1.0, our vision was simple: make complex agentic workflow automation accessible to everyone through natural language, giving developers an out-of-the-box solution for building and running intelligent workflows. The community response was incredibly encouraging, but it also revealed something crucial\u2014the demand for truly production-ready, high-performance agentic frameworks was far outpacing what existing solutions could deliver.\nEko 2.0 is the result of months of intensive research, community feedback, and real-world deployment insights. This isn\u2019t just about piling on new features\u2014it\u2019s about exploring what becomes possible when cutting-edge AI capabilities meet production-grade architecture. While Eko 1.0 successfully enabled developers to build agents that could tackle repetitive tasks, Eko 2.0 takes things to the next level as a robust Framework for creating truly production-grade agentic workflows.\nThe performance improvements speak for themselves: Eko 2.0 doesn\u2019t just add native support for multi-agent collaboration\u2014it also delivers breakthrough results on the rigorous Online-Mind2web benchmark, with task success rates jumping dramatically from 31% to 80%. This significant performance leap demonstrates real progress in framework reliability and practical utility.\nPerformance Revolution Breakthrough: Eko 2.0 Dominates the Online-Mind2web Benchmark Rankings\nThe significant performance improvements we mentioned earlier are just the beginning\u2014the specific data is even more compelling. Eko 2.0 has achieved SOTA performance on the widely recognized Online-Mind2web benchmark in the industry.\nWhat\u2019s even more noteworthy is Eko 2.0\u2019s consistently excellent performance across different complexity levels:\n- Easy Tasks: 95% success rate (vs 80-90% for other products)\n- Average Success Rate: 80% success rate (vs 56-61% for other products)\n- Medium Complexity: 76% success rate (vs 49-58% for other products)\n- Hard Tasks: 70% success rate (vs 32-43% for other products)\nBehind these numbers lies the critical difference between unreliable automation tools and production-ready Agentic Workflow Frameworks that enterprises can truly depend on.\nWhat\u2019s New in Eko 2.0: The Standout Improvements and Feature Additions\n| Feature | Eko 2.0 | Eko 1.0 |\n|---|---|---|\n| Performance | 1.2x faster execution | Baseline speed |\n| Multi-Agent Support | \u2705 Native orchestration | \u274c Single agent only |\n| DOM Event Handling | \u2705 Real-time monitoring | \u274c Static interactions |\n| Tool Integration | \u2705 MCP Protocol support | \u274c Limited tool options |\n| Agent-to-Agent Communication | \u2705 Coming soon | \u274c Not supported |\n| LLM Configuration | \u2705 Dynamic switching | \u274c Fixed configuration |\n| Planning System | Stream Planning & Replan | Simple Plan |\n| Callback Architecture | Stream & Human Callbacks | Basic Hooks |\nMulti-Agent Collaboration Architecture\nEko 2.0 natively supports Multi-Agent collaboration, delivering significant improvements in both speed and capability. In developing Eko 2.0, we\u2019ve witnessed the rapid development of inter-agent communication protocols. Soon, we\u2019ll also natively support A2A functionality, enabling direct information exchange between agents and further enhancing the intelligence level and execution efficiency of entire Agentic Workflows.\nThis multi-agent collaboration architecture doesn\u2019t just boost performance\u2014more importantly, it provides more flexible and reliable solutions for complex business scenarios.\nDynamic Planning Engine\nEko 1.0 used single-shot planning. Once an execution plan was set, it couldn\u2019t be flexibly adjusted, which often proved inadequate when facing complex and dynamic real-world scenarios. Eko 2.0\u2019s Dynamic Planning Engine completely transforms this limitation.\nStream Planning & RePlanning enables Eko 2.0 to generate and adjust execution plans in real-time. When workflows encounter unexpected situations during execution, such as webpage structure changes, API response anomalies, or data format mismatches, the system doesn\u2019t simply throw errors and stop. Instead, it dynamically replans subsequent steps based on the current execution state. This adaptive capability ensures workflow continuity and reliability, gracefully handling and recovering even from unforeseen circumstances.\nDynamic LLM Configuration further enhances the system\u2019s intelligence level. Eko 2.0 can dynamically adjust language model parameters at runtime based on specific task requirements, even switching between different model configurations during various execution phases. This intelligent resource allocation not only optimizes performance but also significantly improves cost-effectiveness.\nReactive Execution Control\nIn Eko 1.0, we provided developers with workflow observability and intervention capabilities through our Hook system\u2014workflow hooks, subtask hooks, and tool hooks enabled monitoring and adjustments at critical points. While this design performed well in static environments, modern web applications increasingly rely on dynamic content and asynchronous loading, presenting challenges that traditional hook mechanisms often struggle to handle effectively.\nEko 2.0\u2019s Reactive Execution Control system builds upon the core principles of the Hook system while being specifically redesigned for the challenges of dynamic web environments. We\u2019ve evolved from passive \u201chook listening\u201d to proactive \u201cevent response,\u201d enabling agents to truly \u201cunderstand\u201d and adapt to constantly changing web environments.\nDOM Event Watching & Loop Tasks functionality gives Eko 2.0 real-time awareness of webpage changes. Unlike Eko 1.0\u2019s reliance on preset hook points, the new system can proactively monitor DOM changes, user interactions, and JavaScript-generated dynamic elements. This means agents no longer need to rely on fixed wait times or repetitive polling\u2014instead, they can intelligently respond to actual page changes, dramatically improving the efficiency and reliability of web automation.\nAdvanced Callback System represents a comprehensive upgrade of the original Hook system. While maintaining core functionalities like workflow hooks and subtask hooks, it introduces advanced features such as stream callbacks, human callbacks, and callback chains. Stream callbacks enable real-time monitoring of workflow execution status, human callbacks introduce manual intervention mechanisms at critical decision points, and callback chain functionality connects these capabilities together, building event processing workflows that are more complex and flexible than traditional Hook systems.\nThis evolution from \u201cstatic hooks\u201d to \u201cReactive Execution Control\u201d not only enhances the system\u2019s adaptability to dynamic environments but, more importantly, provides developers with unprecedented control granularity and flexibility.\nExtensible Tools Framework\nExtensibility is an indispensable feature for building production-grade Agentic Workflow frameworks. Eko 2.0 now supports MCP integration, enabling developers to freely and efficiently integrate third-party tools and services.\nFurthermore, the custom tool extensions functionality unleashes the framework\u2019s potential even further. Developers are no longer limited to preset tool collections but can build specialized tool modules according to specific business requirements. Eko 2.0 provides clean and powerful tool development interfaces. Developers can easily encapsulate their tools into Eko-compatible modules and integrate them seamlessly with the entire workflow system.\nThis open and flexible tool architecture design ensures that Eko 2.0\u2019s capability boundaries will continue to expand, providing increasingly rich solutions for automation needs across various industries, making the Eko Framework continuously scalable.\nArchitecture Reimagined: Built for Scale, Speed, and Capability\nEko 2.0\u2019s architecture represents significant architectural improvements built around three core principles: scale, speed, and capability.\nScale Expansion: Eko 2.0 evolves from single-agent architecture to support multi-agent collaborative systems, enabling complex tasks to be better handled through specialized division of labor. Through MCP protocol integration, the framework gains virtually unlimited tool integration capabilities, allowing developers to easily expand functional boundaries. The upcoming A2A (Agent-to-Agent) communication feature will further enhance coordination between multiple agents, building truly intelligent collaborative networks.\nSpeed Optimization: Eko 2.0 achieves a 1.2x performance improvement through optimized execution processes and reduced redundant operations, significantly enhancing overall execution efficiency. Intelligent resource scheduling mechanisms enable the system to dynamically select optimal LLM model configurations based on specific task requirements, further optimizing performance while maintaining quality.\nCapability Enhancement: Eko 2.0 achieves a qualitative leap in intelligent decision-making, evolving from simple instruction execution to a system with intelligent judgment and environmental adaptation capabilities. Dynamic replanning functionality enables the framework to gracefully handle exceptions and unexpected changes, while the 80% benchmark success rate demonstrates its powerful ability to handle complex real-world scenarios. The advanced callback system supports fine-grained human intervention and supervision, with stream planning combined with real-time DOM event monitoring ensuring workflows can accurately respond to dynamically changing web environments.\nBuilding on these foundations, Eko 2.0\u2019s architecture represents a significant upgrade, starting with the user and connecting through Web, Node.js, and browser extension environments to the core planning agent system. This system integrates intent detection, DOM listening, and timer functionality while maintaining bidirectional communication with advanced LLM models. The framework establishes a complete memory system implementing \u201cthought-and-observation\u201d and \u201cself-reflection\u201d capabilities, while deploying specialized computer, file, and browser agents that share powerful tool pool resources including variable storage, task status management, and event triggers.\nEko 2.0 vs The Competition: A Clear Advantage\nWhen compared to other automation frameworks, Eko 2.0\u2019s advantages become clearly evident:\n| Feature | Eko 2.0 | Langchain | Browser-use | Dify.ai | Coze |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Platform Support | All platforms | Server-side only | Browser only | Web only | Web only |\n| Natural Language Workflows | \u2705 | \u274c | \u2705 | \u274c | \u274c |\n| Human Intervention | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u274c | \u274c | \u274c |\n| Development Efficiency | High | Low | Medium | Medium | Low |\n| Open Source | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u274c |\n| Private Resource Access | \u2705 (Coming soon) | \u274c | \u274c | \u274c | \u274c |\nWhile other frameworks confine themselves to specific environments or demand complex configurations, Eko 2.0 achieves the perfect combination of universal platform support and natural language workflow generation\u2014a pairing that\u2019s simply unavailable elsewhere in the current market. The integration of cross-platform compatibility and natural language workflow generation makes Eko 2.0 a framework that truly delivers on the promise of accessible, powerful automation.
