  "title": "Alabama names Ty Simpson starting quarterback: Reports",
  "description": "Jalen Milroe's backup the last two seasons beats out Austin Mack, Keelon Russell for starting role.",
  "content": "Alabama has named Ty Simpson its starting quarterback, according to multiple reports. Simpson, a redshirt junior, was in a competition with redshirt sophomore Austin Mack and five-star true freshman Keelon Russell, who possesses plenty of promise.\n\nThough the decision became official on Monday, things have been headed this way for a while. During a press conference at the end of the spring, Crimson Tide offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb said, \u201cif we\u2019re playing a football game tomorrow, Ty Simpson would start. And he earned that.\u201d\n\nSo, Simpson has been viewed as the leader in the clubhouse for a few months. He backed up Jalen Milroe, who left for the NFL, for the past two seasons.\n\nSimpson has attempted just 50 passes during his career, so he\u2019s a bit of an unknown. Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer clearly believes in him because he did not dip into the transfer portal to add a quarterback this offseason.\n\nThere is some skepticism within the SEC, though. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be in the upper tier of the league,\u201d an SEC assistant told The Athletic this summer when asked about where Simpson stands among SEC quarterbacks.\n\nSimpson ranked 47th among 136 FBS starting quarterbacks in The Athletic\u2019s College Football 2025 quarterback tiers. He will be supported with a strong play caller in Grubb, a great receiver group led by star sophomore Ryan Williams, and a strong offensive line.\n\nSo there\u2019s a strong possibility for Simpson to outplay that ranking.",

      "text": "No position can change a team\u2019s fortunes quite like the quarterback.\nIt\u2019s often called the most difficult position to play in sports because of all that comes with it \u2014 the credit when the team wins, the blame after a loss.\nCollege quarterbacks, with their varied skill sets, unique journeys and diverse backgrounds, are a special breed. One can go from a small-town star to the big man on campus overnight.\nAdvertisement\nAnd this is the time of year when fans love to debate who the best quarterbacks are and pundits rank their top signal callers.\nWe\u2019ll join in on the fun. Borrowing from Mike Sando\u2019s popular NFL QB Tiers, we set out to rank all 136 FBS starting quarterbacks and separate them into levels of potential impact. Introducing The Athletic\u2019s College QB Tiers.\nFor this exercise, we surveyed more than 40 coaches and staffers from across college football, soliciting their opinions on the quarterbacks they faced, how the QBs in their conference stack up and who the best in the country are. We relied heavily on this feedback to form the list. There was no formal point system or vote tally. We simply leaned on coaches for their expertise. All coaches were granted anonymity in exchange for their candor while discussing other teams\u2019 quarterbacks.\nThe rankings and tiers are based on a combination of coaches\u2019 perspectives, the players\u2019 physical abilities and traits, career accomplishments to date and a projection of what 2025 may hold for them. We ranked the quarterbacks based on how they stack up at the college level, not what their NFL Draft projection will be (though draft analysis is included for some 2026-eligible prospects, courtesy of Dane Brugler and Nick Baumgardner).\nThe quarterbacks are also ranked by conference and by their status: returning starter, transfer or new starter. Returning starters are those who generally started more than half of their current team\u2019s 2024 games, with exceptions for QBs who were opening-day starters but lost extended time to injury. Transfers include only the projected starting QBs who transferred to their current team this offseason. New starters are mostly first-time starters and generally include QBs who haven\u2019t started at least half a season before.\nAdvertisement\nFor teams that haven\u2019t officially named a starter because they\u2019re still engaged in a quarterback battle, we ranked who we project to start based on information gathered to this point.\nLet the debate begin.\nCade Klubnik\nThe lack of consensus on a clear-cut No. 1 underscored the unique quarterback year this is in college football. There\u2019s no alpha. Garrett Nussmeier, LaNorris Sellers and DJ Lagway all got No. 1 votes. But Klubnik received the most love from opposing coaches because he checks every box.\n\u201cHe\u2019s really solid everywhere,\u201d a Power 4 head coach said. \u201cGood, accurate passer, good size, can run. \u2026 I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s elite at any trait, but I don\u2019t think he has any weaknesses.\u201d\nKlubnik, a former five-star recruit, increased his production from 2023 to 2024, cut down his interception rate and got Clemson back to the College Football Playoff.\n\u201cI was a Cade Klubnik hater,\u201d a Power 4 offensive coordinator said. \u201cHe balled out last year. I was impressed with him.\u201d\nThe Tigers are a trendy pick to go deep into the CFP in 2025, and Klubnik is a big reason why.\nGarrett Nussmeier\nNussmeier waited three years on the bench for his chance to be QB1 at LSU, but when his time arrived, he dazzled. He\u2019s the only returning starter in the FBS who threw for 4,000-plus yards last season.\nHis ability to laser the ball to any part of the field has won a lot of admirers.\n\u201cI was up and down on him, then I watched him play (up close) and I was like \u2018This f\u2014\u2019s pretty good,\u2019\u201d a Power 4 offensive coordinator said. \u201cHe can make some great go-ball throws.\u201d\nHis footwork and ability to navigate pressure, climb the pocket and still deliver the ball accurately and on time is one of Nussmeier\u2019s best traits. He\u2019s not immune to a head-scratching decision, and he\u2019ll have to work through that, but he plays winning football.\nSaid an SEC assistant, \u201cGarrett Nussmeier\u2019s a baller, dude.\u201d\nLaNorris Sellers\nImagine you\u2019re an SEC defensive lineman or linebacker. You have a free, clean shot at the quarterback with no blockers, no impediments between you and the target. It\u2019s a sack, right? Not if it\u2019s Sellers. It may instead turn into a 40-yard gain.\nSouth Carolina\u2019s breakout star is a tank. He\u2019s raw as a passer, but he put up respectable numbers in his first year as a starter. But his playmaking ability, even in the toughest of circumstances, is otherworldly.\n\u201cHe\u2019s like the size of a defensive end in that league,\u201d a former SEC assistant said. \u201cSo when he decides to tuck the ball and run with it, he\u2019s a bad matchup for people.\u201d\nOther schools thought highly of Sellers; one reportedly offered him a two-year deal for $8 million that he turned down, according to his father. Hanging on to him should have the Gamecocks firmly in CFP contention this season.\nJohn Mateer\nIf you didn\u2019t stay up late last season or tune into the CW, you might have missed one of the most exciting quarterbacks in the country. The Washington State transfer accounted for nearly 4,000 combined passing and rushing yards and 44 touchdowns. He followed offensive coordinator Ben Arbuckle to Oklahoma, so the system continuity will benefit him and the Sooners.\nHis speed and elusiveness jump off the tape, but he\u2019s no slouch as a passer. Coaches we spoke with were nearly universal in their praise, and expectations are high for Mateer, even as he steps into the rugged SEC.\n\u201cHe has some Baker Mayfield to his game,\u201d a Power 4 personnel director said. \u201cHe can throw off-platform and run around back there if he needs to, but he still has really good arm talent. He\u2019s not hesitant to throw it in tight windows.\u201d\nDJ Lagway\nThe No. 1 QB in the 2024 recruiting class according to On3, Lagway opened eyes immediately last season, throwing for a Florida freshman record 456 yards in his first start. He started the second half of the season, and though he made his share of freshman mistakes, he showed why he was so highly regarded, capping the year with a 300-yard performance and bowl game MVP honors.\nHe displayed elite arm talent, good mobility and poise beyond that of a typical true freshman. His size and strength helped him keep plays alive. With Lagway behind center, the future is bright in Gainesville.\n\u201cIf I\u2019m starting a team right now, I\u2019m probably taking DJ Lagway as my quarterback,\u201d a Power 4 offensive coordinator said.\nDrew Allar\nAllar is a polarizing player. There are very credible NFL Draft analysts who view him as a potential top-five pick. Other observers are less enthusiastic: \u201cHe\u2019s timid. He gets freaked out by pressure,\u201d a Power 4 personnel director said. \u201cNow, he is athletic. He can run. I know people probably make the Josh Allen comparison. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s that athletic, but he\u2019s a moose. I think he\u2019s just OK.\u201d\nThe truth is not many quarterbacks possess Allar\u2019s physical tools \u2014 the size, the great arm, the athleticism. He\u2019s also experienced and will be surrounded by a good supporting cast and strong play caller (OC Andy Kotelnicki).\nFolks have soured on the former five-star because he\u2019s been underwhelming in nearly every big game he\u2019s started. Penn State has sky-high expectations this season, so Allar has an opportunity to change the narrative on the field.\nSam Leavitt\nCoach Kenny Dillingham has quickly built a strong reputation for QB development. Leavitt is well on his way to becoming the latest success story.\nLeavitt rapidly progressed from first-time starter into the Big 12\u2019s best quarterback by season\u2019s end. He\u2019s a fluid athlete who relied on that athleticism and his legs early on until he found his groove as a passer in the second half of the year. Once he did, Arizona State\u2019s offense took off on its way to a Big 12 title and CFP appearance. Running back Cam Skattebo, the Sun Devils\u2019 heartbeat, is gone, so Leavitt will be relied upon more, but he showed in the second half of last year he\u2019s ready for that sort of responsibility.\n\u201cSuper smart, really good processor, has traits, a real arm. He\u2019s gonna be a stud. He\u2019s a real one,\u201d a Power 4 general manager said.\nKevin Jennings\nThe lasting impression of Jennings at the end of 2024 \u2014 throwing three interceptions, including two pick sixes, in a CFP first-round loss at Penn State \u2014 is hard to shake. But coaches didn\u2019t let that cloud their judgment about his talent and body of work, when he went 9-2 as SMU\u2019s starter last year.\nJennings has the arm strength to get the ball to every part of the field and is elite at creating off schedule. He needs to trim his interception total, but most of those occurred in two games (Penn State and Duke).\n\u201cThe kid\u2019s a baller, a gamer, he gets it done,\u201d a Power 4 offensive coordinator said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t always look the prettiest. He\u2019s a little herky-jerky as a thrower. He\u2019s rail thin. But he wins games and is a great leader. And he can throw the crap out of the ball.\u201d\nJosh Hoover\nIf you\u2019re looking for a traditional passer who can pick a defense apart from the pocket, Hoover fits the bill. \u201cHe\u2019s the most natural thrower in our league,\u201d a Big 12 coordinator said.\nHoover, the Big 12\u2019s most productive returning passer \u2014 he set a TCU single-season record with 3,949 passing yards last year \u2014 is accurate, operates the offense cleanly and efficiently and has the zip to get the ball to the sidelines and down the field quickly. He\u2019s not a dynamic runner but is mobile enough to escape pressure or pick up a first down in a pinch. Some feel he has a case as the league\u2019s best quarterback over Leavitt.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a problem,\u201d a Power 4 head coach said. \u201cIf he's gonna sit back there and throw it 40-plus times a game, you're gonna be concerned until the end of the game that he's going to move the football and score points.\u201d\nArch Manning\nRanking Manning was one of the toughest exercises. The outside expectations have reached a fever pitch, thanks to his recruiting profile, bloodlines and famous last name. There\u2019s little question about his physical skills: He\u2019s big, with a rocket arm and a healthy dose of athleticism. \u201cHe can throw with anticipation and be completely on schedule with everything he does,\u201d a Power 4 personnel director said.\nBut there is some skepticism among opposing coaches in the rush to anoint him after he showed a few growing pains in limited action.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I would be ready to crown him as the best quarterback in the nation right now,\u201d a Power 4 offensive coordinator said. \u201cI didn\u2019t walk away from the Louisiana-Monroe film thinking, \u2018Man, this kid is a no-doubt first overall pick in the draft.\u2019\u201d\nMost coaches we spoke with remarked on how unrealistic the expectations of Manning are. But they almost all conceded future success for him.\n\u201cArch Manning\u2019s probably going to be great,\u201d a Power 4 head coach said. \u201cHe should be great. He\u2019s at Texas with a good coach and a good roster, and I think he\u2019s good. All the fanfare is on potential, though.\u201d\nSawyer Robertson\nRobertson was not Baylor\u2019s opening-day starter last year \u2014 that was transfer Dequan Finn \u2014 but when Robertson took over, it quickly became evident who gave the Bears the best chance to win.\nAfter Baylor hit rock bottom with a 2-4 first half, Robertson led the team to a six-game winning streak to save the season. In his second season as QB1 with an offense that fits his skill set, he should be even better.\nRobertson doesn\u2019t have the strongest arm or the quickest release, but he gets the job done with consistency and accuracy. He manages Baylor\u2019s offense well and is a real running threat.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s limited as a passer, but he was really productive and is a good athlete who can make some plays,\u201d a Big 12 coordinator said.\nCarson Beck\nA year ago, Beck would have contended for No. 1 on this list. But an up-and-down final season at Georgia, an elbow injury and a transfer to Miami have led to some skepticism. Nobody questions his arm talent or his ability. But Beck\u2019s lack of consistency is a concern.\n\u201cYou watch his tape and you\u2019re like, \u2018All right, this guy is pretty good.\u2019 And then you keep watching and it\u2019s same mistakes over and over again,\u201d a Power 4 offensive coordinator said. \u201cWhen you need a good throw in a critical moment, sometimes you don\u2019t get it.\u201d\nMultiple coaches were bothered by his lack of mobility. An ACC personnel director said Miami is in for a \u201crude awakening\u201d if it thinks it will be better with Beck compared to Cam Ward. But a former Power 4 scouting director still has optimism.\n\u201cIf he\u2019s healthy \u2014 a big if \u2014 he\u2019s the second-best quarterback in the ACC,\u201d he said.\nLuke Altmyer\nAltmyer progressed from Ole Miss\u2019 backup in 2022 to first-time starter at Illinois in 2023 to quality Big Ten quarterback in 2024. Coach Bret Bielema\u2019s offenses will always be run-first, but they\u2019re at their best when the quarterback can make the necessary throws. And Altmyer is ideal for the system.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a really good game manager,\u201d a Big Ten assistant coach said. \u201cGood, accurate passer. He can run it if he needs to, too. Probably a better athlete than people might think. He\u2019s a good player. He\u2019s definitely scrappy, too.\u201d\nAltmyer has demonstrated moxie in several late-game situations. His game-winning touchdown pass in the final seconds against Rutgers turned some heads, but he also orchestrated clutch drives against Kansas, Nebraska, Purdue and South Carolina last year. Illinois will be a trendy Playoff pick this offseason, and Altmyer is one of the reasons for the optimism.\nRocco Becht\nThe Pop-Tarts Bowl MVP and son of former NFL tight end Anthony Becht led the Cyclones to their first double-digit win season in school history. Iowa State leaned on him more as a passer in his second year as the starter, but he also became a real rushing weapon (318 yards, eight TDs). His 35 rushes for first downs as a QB trailed only Garrett Greene and Avery Johnson in the Big 12 (41).\n\u201cHe plays his nuts off,\u201d a Power 4 personnel director said of Becht.\nHe\u2019s not the most physically imposing quarterback, but he has good anticipation and consistently gets the ball into tight windows over the middle with plenty of velocity.\n\u201cGood decision maker, processes well, does everything quickly,\u201d a former Power 4 scouting director said. \u201cHe manages the position and the game well.\u201d\nDiego Pavia\nPavia got an extra year after challenging an NCAA eligibility rule regarding junior college seasons, and we all benefit because there are few quarterbacks more fun to watch. There may not be a better marriage between quarterback and scheme than what Pavia has at Vanderbilt under offensive coordinator Tim Beck, who also coached him at New Mexico State.\nPavia\u2019s not the biggest, strongest or fastest, but he produces (he led SEC QBs with 801 rushing yards). He\u2019s slippery, able to elude elite SEC rushers whether scrambling to throw or looking for ground gains. And his competitive edge is off the charts. His performance in the Commodores' win over Alabama will live in SEC lore, but he\u2019s also the biggest reason they logged their first winning record since 2013.\n\u201cHe\u2019s accurate in the RPO game and underneath throws,\u201d a Group of 5 head coach said. \u201cBut he\u2019s the epitome of what you want in an alpha.\u201d\nHaynes King\nAfter leading the Yellow Jackets to a winning record in the ACC and a bowl game in consecutive seasons, King has won over a lot of people inside and outside the conference with his dual-threat ability (1,324 combined rushing yards in 2023 and 2024) and hard-nosed play style. His performance in Georgia Tech\u2019s eight-overtime loss to Georgia last November was the epitome of the Haynes King experience.\nMost coaches had similar critiques. \u201cI hate the way he throws, but he\u2019s a f\u2014ing competitor,\u201d an ACC personnel director said.\nSaid a Power 4 head coach, \u201cHe\u2019s a warrior. He\u2019s a winner. He\u2019s a leader. He\u2019s tough. \u2026 Can he throw it good enough? I don\u2019t know. If he\u2019s healthy and takes the next step as a passer, I think he fits what Georgia Tech\u2019s doing.\u201d\nFernando Mendoza\nMendoza flew under the radar of the more casual college football audience while at Cal the past two seasons, but he was definitely not overlooked by some of the top programs in the country. Georgia pursued him in the transfer portal before he chose Indiana. Mendoza has a solid arm and enough athleticism to create and improvise in the pocket. He breathed life into what had been an anemic passing attack at Cal.\nMendoza will face tougher defenses in the Big Ten than he did in the Pac-12 and ACC, but he\u2019s stepping into a good situation from a personnel and coaching perspective at Indiana.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be all right,\u201d a Power 4 OC said. \u201cHe\u2019s young, he works hard, he cares. The Indiana OC (Mike Shanahan) does a good job of calling plays in situational and stuff. He can spin it.\u201d\nDarian Mensah\nMensah is a gifted young passer who burst onto the scene with Tulane last year. He was highly coveted when he entered the transfer portal, and Duke made sure he was well compensated. The Blue Devils pushed out a capable starter, Maalik Murphy, to bring him in as well. Armed with that context, expectations will be really high for Mensah this fall as the Blue Devils try to build off a nine-win season in coach Manny Diaz\u2019s first year at the helm. \u201cReally talented with his ability to extend and create,\u201d said a personnel staffer whose program faced Mensah last year. \u201cOnly going to get better. We had him bottled up a couple times, and he turned it into a big play.\u201d\nNico Iamaleava\nMeet one of college football\u2019s lightning rods, a player who has always been at the forefront of NIL drama \u2014 the latest being a failed holdout at Tennessee. Still, Iamaleava was a starting quarterback on a Playoff team last season, and the physical tools are obvious. \u201cExtremely athletic, a better runner than people give him credit for,\u201d an SEC assistant coach said. \u201cCannon for an arm, accurate, capable of making every throw.\u201d\nLast season, Iamaleava\u2019s first as a starter, demonstrated the former five-star prospect is still very much a work in progress. Although Tennessee did reach the Playoff, the Volunteers' run game and defense led the way. Now he\u2019ll be tasked with leading a UCLA squad with a weaker supporting cast on offense, a first-time play caller in OC Tino Sunseri and a defense that\u2019s middle of the road at best.\nIamaleava faces a tall order but also a chance to outperform this ranking if he plays well.\nBrendan Sorsby\nHow does a quarterback of a team that went 5-7 make it this high on the list? \u201cVery talented thrower, NFL arm, one of the best in the country,\u201d a former Power 4 scouting director said.\nSorsby\u2019s big and gets the ball downfield effortlessly, but he\u2019s not a statue. His 447 rushing yards were third most among Big 12 QBs last year, and he was the only QB in the country last season to record a 425-yard passing game and a 125-yard rushing game.\n\u201cSuper talented,\u201d a Big 12 coordinator said. \u201cReally natural thrower, can run around.\u201d\nNow, can the former Indiana transfer help the Bearcats take the next step and return to the postseason after a two-year absence?\nTaylen Green\nThe word that comes to mind when watching Green is \u201csmooth.\u201d He\u2019s a fluid runner with a long stride and the ability to make opponents miss (602 rushing yards, eight TDs in '24), and his throws look effortless, whether he\u2019s fitting it into an intermediate window or finding an open receiver 40 yards downfield.\n\u201cThat guy\u2019s a real-deal player,\u201d a Power 4 offensive coordinator said. \u201cHe\u2019s so explosive as a runner, and he\u2019s a better passer than you think.\u201d\nSome question his decison-making and processing \u2014 \u201che takes some awful sacks,\u201d an SEC assistant said \u2014 and cite his need to be a better passer in critical situations. But the former Boise State transfer is entering his second year working under Arkansas OC Bobby Petrino, so the bet is that Green will take a significant step forward.\nAvery Johnson\nJohnson\u2019s first year as K-State\u2019s starter had its ups and downs. There were nights when it all came together and he was the dual-threat star many projected, and others when he was bit by the turnover bug, which doomed the Wildcats in losses to BYU and Houston.\nHe\u2019ll have to do a better job of understanding coverages and identifying defensive looks pre-snap to cut that down. But when he takes care of the ball, there are few more electric than Johnson, who has the acceleration and burst to eat up chunks of yards on the ground (605 rushing yards, seven TDs). Coaches love Johnson\u2019s upside.\n\u201cSupreme athlete,\u201d a Power 4 general manager said. \u201cIt\u2019s really a good fit for that offense. It\u2019s third-and-2, third-and-3 and he scrambles around and escapes.\u201d\nMaddux Madsen\nIt\u2019s hard to argue with Madsen being the top-ranked Group of 5 quarterback after he helped Boise State reach the Playoff. He doesn\u2019t possess overwhelming physical traits, but he gets the ball out quickly and generally makes good decisions.\nBoise State will need that composure as it navigates life after star running back Ashton Jeanty. It\u2019ll be impossible to replace Jeanty, so more will be required of Madsen. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what the Broncos offense looks like without the 2024 Heisman runner-up.\n\u201cThat will hurt the offense overall, I\u2019m sure,\u201d a G5 general manager said. \u201cBut I think Madsen is talented and experienced.\u201d\nDante Moore\nMoore threw just eight passes last season, but his inclusion in the top 25 is a bet on his potential, Oregon OC Will Stein\u2019s ability to produce prolific offenses and head coach Dan Lanning\u2019s talent acquisition skills. Moore, a former five-star prospect, started five games as a true freshman at UCLA in 2023 and displayed promising flashes but turned the ball over too much and was benched. We\u2019ll see how much sitting behind Dillon Gabriel last year helped his development. There will be a big spotlight placed on Moore this fall, but there\u2019s no reason for him not to be successful.\n\u201cI just thought he was accurate. I thought he was efficient \u2014 from when I saw him in high school, anyway,\u201d said a Big Ten assistant coach. \u201cHe has made a couple plays in his (college) career. I think he\u2019ll be a good player.\u201d\nDevon Dampier\nIf you wanted to capture the essence of an NFL Street quarterback (remember that game?) in a real-life signal caller, he might play like Dampier. Every dropback can be an adventure, and more often than not, something memorable \u2014 good or bad \u2014 will happen.\nHis elusiveness is his best trait. At New Mexico in 2024, he ranked fourth in the FBS in rushing yards among quarterbacks (1,166). But he can make some dynamite throws as well. Joining Jason Beck, his New Mexico offensive coordinator, at Utah and running the same offense should ease Dampier\u2019s transition to the Power 4. He\u2019s not immune to throwing an egregious interception, but there\u2019s a lot to like.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a magician back there,\u201d a P4 GM said. \u201cReally slippery. Has a good feel for it. Throws it better than you think.\u201d\nMarcel Reed\nReed, a late take in A&M\u2019s 2023 recruiting class, filled in for the injured Conner Weigman, then took over as the starter in the final month of the season after a breakout performance in a win against LSU. He showed enough that the Aggies didn\u2019t take a QB to compete with him for the starting job in the portal after Weigman left.\nHis speed is a game-changer. \u201cHe\u2019s explosive,\u201d an SEC assistant said.\nHe needs to develop more as a passer, but he has good arm strength and a fluid motion, and he\u2019s a good fit for Collin Klein\u2019s offense, which utilizes heavy doses of the quarterback run game.\nBehren Morton\nSince signing as the highest-ranked QB recruit in program history in 2021, Morton has steadily increased his production and cut down his interception rate each of the last three years. But there\u2019s a level he hasn\u2019t reached just yet, perhaps in part because he played the last season-and-a-half with an AC joint injury that was finally repaired over the winter. Will a fully healthy Morton make a sizable leap?\n\u201cHe\u2019s good but didn\u2019t blow me away talent-wise,\u201d a Power 4 GM said.\nGio Lopez\nLopez is a stocky southpaw with some juice. Coaches love his arm strength. He\u2019s not the twitchiest athlete, but he\u2019s a speedy, tough and effective runner (463 yards, 7 TDs last year).\nCan he elevate his play, going from South Alabama to the ACC?\n\u201cHe\u2019s a no-brainer Power 4 guy,\u201d a Power 4 OC said. \u201cHe has serious playmaking abilities.\u201d\nSaid a former P4 scouting director, \u201cHe\u2019s the guy in the ACC who\u2019s gonna raise the most eyebrows.\u201d\nEli Holstein\nHolstein was very productive through five games last season, but he suffered a concussion and a leg injury that sent his and Pitt\u2019s season into a tailspin. So health will be key for Holstein, who managed to play in 10 of 12 regular-season games but was never seemingly at full strength down the stretch.\n\u201cHe had some good moments and is physically impressive, but last year he just made some of the worst decisions you can imagine,\u201d said a former P4 scouting director.\nMaalik Murphy\nDuke favored Darian Mensah over Murphy, who transferred to Oregon State, but if you were to draw up a prototypical quarterback, he\u2019d have Murphy\u2019s size and arm. Murphy is still an unfinished product who needs refinement, but he made several big-time throws in clutch situations last year.\n\u201cBig dude. \u2026 Now, he wasn\u2019t really mobile, but he just had a cannon for an arm,\u201d said an assistant coach who faced Murphy last season. \u201cA really sharp arm, and he\u2019s fairly accurate. Sometimes he throws it too hard. But he definitely had a cannon.\u201d\nCJ Bailey\nBailey, a good passer who is more than capable of making plays with his legs, emerged as one of the most promising young quarterbacks in the country last season. There is plenty of optimism about him within the ACC.\n\u201cI love CJ Bailey. He\u2019s a dude. He\u2019s only going to keep ascending. We\u2019ll see how the supporting cast is around him this year, but I think he\u2019s going to take a big step,\u201d an ACC personnel director said.\nJulian Sayin\nOhio State is breaking in a first-year play caller, Brian Hartline, and a quarterback who has thrown just 12 collegiate passes. Sayin has the pedigree as the top-rated quarterback recruit in the 2024 cycle. Additionally, Sayin will be surrounded by the best receiving group in the country. However, questions will remain until we see him in live action.\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be growing pains any time a guy hasn\u2019t played,\u201d a Big Ten assistant coach said. \u201cHow does he handle the fishbowl of being the quarterback at Ohio State?\u201d\nDemond Williams Jr.\nWashington brought Williams along slowly last year, but it\u2019s the electric youngster\u2019s show now. Williams demonstrated great creativity in the pocket, dynamic running ability and a good deep ball in two starts to end the season. Pair those skills with coach Jedd Fisch\u2019s mentoring, and Williams has the potential to have a big season.\n\u201cFisch is gonna put him in every situation he can to be successful,\u201d a Power 4 general manager said. \u201cHe\u2019s a kid who I think more people will talk about and know about (nationally) by the end of the season.\u201d\nJalon Daniels\nThe quarterback who led Kansas\u2019 revival is still heavily respected around the Big 12, even after a down 2024 in which he never got in a groove and his turnover total skyrocketed. On the bright side, the oft-injured Daniels played all 12 games for the first time in his career. If he can do that again, there\u2019s a belief that he\u2019ll return to form.\n\u201cHe\u2019s electric,\u201d a Big 12 coordinator said.\nJackson Arnold\nA mess of offensive problems \u2014 from the line, to the receiving corps, to the coordinator \u2014 muddied Arnold\u2019s would-be breakout sophomore season at Oklahoma, where he was briefly benched.\n\u201cHe was set up to fail at OU,\u201d a Power 4 coordinator said.\nAuburn provides a fresh start for a guy coaches are still bullish on talent-wise, but he\u2019ll have to take better care of the ball.\nNoah Fifita\nFifita was tremendous in 2023 but regressed under a new coaching staff last year. New offensive coordinator Seth Doege will have the responsibility of getting Fifita back on track, but there\u2019s still confidence in Fifita\u2019s abilities.\n\u201cThat son of a b\u2014 can play now,\u201d a Power 4 head coach said. \u201cHe\u2019s a shorter guy and may take some unnecessary risks, but he can run. He\u2019s really talented, arm talented, has a great feel for the game.\u201d\nAustin Simmons\nSimmons is a unicorn: a lefty who reclassified up by two years and has already earned his college degree at 19. His resume is limited (32 career pass attempts), but he showed enticing potential last season when he stepped in for an injured Jaxson Dart against Georgia and led a touchdown drive while going 5-for-6 for 64 yards.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t even blink and dropped five dimes like he was the starter the whole time,\u201d a G5 head coach said. \u201cHe has no fear, he\u2019s confident, can run, has a strong arm. He\u2019s got a shot.\u201d\nBeau Pribula\nThe Penn State transfer hit the portal when Drew Allar decided to return for one more year and was a coveted prospect. Pribula looked plenty capable in relief of Allar, especially in the second half of a road win over Wisconsin. He doesn\u2019t have the biggest arm, but his mobility, accuracy, poise and command are encouraging. And he\u2019s a real run threat, scoring four touchdowns as a change-of-pace option last season.\nMark Gronowski\nGronowski missed the spring while recovering from shoulder surgery, but he won two national championships at the FCS level as South Dakota State\u2019s starter. He\u2019s a winner. He has good arm strength and is a tough, physical runner who has accounted for 130 touchdowns in his career.\nThe quarterback spot has been a black hole for Iowa in recent years, but Gronowski is a ray of light who could help elevate an anemic passing game.\nDylan Raiola\nRaiola looked every bit of a five-star prospect last September but hit a wall midway through his true freshman season. The hope is he\u2019ll make a jump with Dana Holgorsen fully in charge of the offense now.\n\u201cHas a calmness, maturity, and swagger to him which you want out of your QB,\u201d a Big Ten personnel staffer said. \u201cThink him continuing to get bigger, faster, stronger and leaner in the offseason can take his game to another level.\u201d\nRaiola didn\u2019t display top-end athleticism last year, though, which has left some in the sport wondering how high his ceiling actually is.\nBlake Horvath\nHorvath is only the third quarterback in Navy history to run and pass for more than 1,200 yards in a season. Horvath\u2019s versatility has him in line to be a top-tier G5 QB this fall.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a unique kid because he\u2019s got the ability to really run, but they actually throw the ball pretty effectively,\u201d a G5 head coach said. \u201cThat kid\u2019s a different type of academy quarterback than people are used to.\u201d\nBraylon Braxton\nBraxton is a physical runner, who is a load for a defense to tackle. He seemingly turned a corner as a passer last season as he led Marshall to a Sun Belt title. Now he and coach Charles Huff will try to turn things around at Southern Miss, which won one game in 2024.\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably the most dynamic playmaker at the position (in the conference),\u201d said a personnel staffer who worked in the Sun Belt last year. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t stop him.\u201d\nMiller Moss\nMoss is a solid college quarterback who can keep an offense on schedule. He doesn\u2019t have elite athleticism, and his limitations were on display at USC last fall. Moss should be highly motivated after getting benched toward the end of the 2024 season. It's beneficial to be playing for Louisville coach Jeff Brohm, who has maximized the skill sets of transfer quarterbacks Jack Plummer and Tyler Shough the past two seasons.\nAidan Chiles\nChiles was inconsistent as a first-time starter last year, but some in the Big Ten still believe in his talent, skill set and athleticism. He could be poised to take a leap forward under coach Jonathan Smith, who typically gets the most out of his quarterbacks.\n\u201cReally talented but still growing as a quarterback, how to run a team, making winning plays,\u201d a Big Ten assistant coach said. \u201cBut that\u2019ll come with experience.\u201d\nPreston Stone\nThe highest-ranked QB SMU has signed in the modern recruiting era, Stone threw for nearly 3,200 yards and 28 TDs during a 2023 run to the AAC championship. But he was replaced by Kevin Jennings early last season and landed at Northwestern. Stone can extend plays if necessary but is not an elite runner. He\u2019s best in the dropback game, attacking downfield.\n\u201cHe throws a really good deep ball,\u201d a Power 4 head coach said.\nKyron Drones\nDrones\u2019 physical talent is enticing. \u201cHe\u2019s 230 pounds of pure muscle,\u201d an ACC personnel director said. \u201cHe\u2019s so hard to bring down.\u201d\nBut as effective a runner as he is (1,154 yards, 11 TDs in the last two seasons), coaches want to know whether Drones can win through the air. His career completion rate is 59.4 percent.\n\u201cHe's gonna have to prove he can play the position as a passer to be an all-around guy,\u201d a Power 4 head coach said.\nTy Simpson\nSimpson is competing with Austin Mack and five-star freshman Keelon Russell, but he led the race coming out of spring and has the experience edge after backing up Jalen Milroe for two seasons. In his limited action, Simpson showed a penchant for making plays with his legs by running for first downs, throwing on the run or escaping pressure. But his potential ascension to full-time action is a subject of curiosity and even some skepticism around the conference.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be in the upper tier of the league,\u201d an SEC assistant said.\nGunner Stockton\nThere\u2019s no questioning Stockton\u2019s toughness \u2014 it\u2019s hard to forget the hit he endured in overtime of Georgia\u2019s SEC title win over Texas \u2014 and even in his first career start in the CFP against Notre Dame, Stockton showed poise under constant pressure and uncorked some impressive downfield throws. His physical gifts aren\u2019t quite those of his predecessor, Carson Beck, so his preseason ranking is very much a wait-and-see approach.\nCJ Carr\nCarr emerged as the leader in the QB competition coming out of spring practice. He took only four snaps last season and didn\u2019t attempt a pass as he recovered from an injury to his throwing elbow suffered during preseason camp. But in the Blue-Gold game, the former Elite 11 QB showed touch and accuracy on downfield throws and a good feel for the offense.\nHe\u2019ll make mistakes as a first-time starter. How he handles those, along with the pressure that comes with being QB1 at Notre Dame, will be telling.\nBryce Underwood\nIt\u2019s difficult to temper the optimism, excitement and massive expectations surrounding Underwood, who was the No. 1 recruit in the Class of 2025. \u201cHe\u2019s the most talented QB I\u2019ve ever watched,\u201d said someone who evaluated Underwood thoroughly during the recruiting process. \u201cLiterally has it all.\u201d\nUnderwood is a freak athlete with a huge arm and will take over the starting role at Michigan at some point. When will that be? And will the supporting cast be good enough around him?\n\u201cReally hope Michigan doesn\u2019t screw it up putting him out there early without a good enough supporting cast,\u201d that same source said. \u201cJust because he\u2019s that good doesn\u2019t mean he needs to start Week 1.\u201d\nConner Weigman\nThe former Texas A&M five-star recruit is seeking a fresh start with the Cougars. When healthy, Weigman showed flashes of why he was so highly regarded coming out of high school, showing a quick release, good downfield accuracy and touch and the athleticism to make plays off schedule.\nBut injuries got the best of him more often than not in Aggieland. Houston is betting on a rejuvenated Weigman to revive one of the worst offenses in the FBS.\nKaidon Salter\nThere\u2019s a lot of buzz out of Boulder about freshman Julian Lewis, who likely will see significant time this season. But Salter is a seasoned veteran with 29 career starts and a New Year\u2019s Six bowl appearance under his belt at Liberty.\nSalter had notable statistical dropoffs last year, and there\u2019s some skepticism as he goes to the Power 4 \u2014 \u201cHe was super erratic,\u201d a Group of 5 GM said \u2014 but he\u2019s still an intriguing dual-threat.\n\u201cI\u2019m betting Salter will be the starter at Colorado,\u201d a Power 4 head coach said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a great skill set.\u201d\nOwen McCown\nThe son of former NFL QB Josh McCown had a breakout 2024 to emerge as one of the best QBs in the Group of 5. His ability to move both within and outside the pocket and keep his eyes downfield keeps defenses guessing. He throws an accurate ball, is athletic enough to pick up chunk yards on the ground and manages UTSA\u2019s offense well.\n\"He\u2019s a competitor,\u201d an AAC assistant said. \u201cI think he\u2019s clearly the best quarterback in this conference.\u201d\nJayden Maiava\nMaiava played well in moments last year but also displayed some really confounding lows. USC\u2019s offense was inconsistent as a result. Maiava will be in his second year under Lincoln Riley, who is one of the best QB mentors in the sport, but he\u2019ll have to trim the fat from his game and eliminate the three to four bad mistakes that stall the offense. Otherwise, the Trojans will be boom-or-bust offensively.\nChandler Morris\nMorris has been at Oklahoma, TCU (where he was twice the opening-day starter only to have injuries cut his seasons short) and North Texas, where he finally blossomed and led the American Athletic Conference with 3,774 passing yards.\nHis return to the P4 gives the Cavaliers a serviceable, mobile, gritty player who should provide them consistency.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a big guy that's going to sit back there and pick you apart, but they can get creative offensively and keep him on the move, which he's good at,\u201d a P4 head coach said.\nBilly Edwards Jr.\nMaryland struggled last year, but Edwards was adequate as a first-time starter. He attempted 40 or more passes in six games, and the Terrapins\u2019 run game was one of the worst in the country. Jeff Grimes has taken over as the offensive coordinator at Wisconsin. The goal should be to re-establish the Badgers' identity as a run-first outfit and lessen the load for Edwards. Regardless, he\u2019ll be an upgrade at QB in Madison.\nNicco Marchiol\nThis job is not cinched just yet, as new coach Rich Rodriguez also signed Texas A&M transfer Jaylen Henderson, but Marchiol has the experience edge, with 19 games of action in a Mountaineer uniform, including a 3-0 record as a starter. He\u2019s a capable thrower who can drive the ball downfield and layer it over defenders. He\u2019s also a strong runner who isn\u2019t afraid to get physical \u2014 like he did when he ran over Oklahoma State safety Trey Rucker last year. He just has to prove he can do it across an entire season.\nBlake Shapen\nAlmost four years have passed since Shapen led Baylor to a Big 12 title game victory, and he still flashes the ability that was so intriguing then. His deep-ball prowess is a good fit for Jeff Lebby\u2019s offense, which is heavy on deep choice routes.\n\u201cHe\u2019s an elite thrower,\u201d a Power 4 coordinator said.\nShapen showed that last fall in his four starts before suffering a season-ending shoulder injury. Staying healthy and consistent \u2014 both of which have been elusive in his career \u2014 are top priorities.\nCaden Veltkamp\nVeltkamp was named the 2024 Conference USA Offensive Player of the Year while at Western Kentucky. Now he\u2019s paired up with coach Zach Kittley, who led a top-five scoring offense as Texas Tech\u2019s OC last year. Veltkamp should post some prolific numbers.\n\u201cThat's one of my favorite quarterbacks from last year,\u201d a G5 head coach said. \u201cI think he's extremely difficult to defend. I\u2019m shocked that he\u2019s at FAU. I can\u2019t believe a Power 4 school didn\u2019t get that kid.\u201d\nJoey Aguilar\nThere will be plenty of eyes on Aguilar because of his place in the Nico Iamaleava saga. He gained an extra year via the Diego Pavia ruling and, after two years as a starter and a coaching change at Appalachian State, transferred to UCLA in the winter. But Iamaleava\u2019s arrival in Westwood prompted another transfer, and Aguilar is now in position to be Iamaleava\u2019s successor in Knoxville \u2014 though he must beat out Jake Merklinger and George MacIntyre for the starting role.\nAguilar\u2019s skills translate well to what Tennessee does. \u201cHe\u2019s got a cannon, so that will fit that offense perfectly with how many deep shots they take,\u201d a former G5 recruiting director said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s a better runner than you think.\u201d\nHe can trust his arm too much, though, as evidenced by his rising interception total last year. He\u2019ll have to take better care of the ball in the SEC. But he\u2019s confident and fearless.\nSteve Angeli\nAngeli was the odd man out of a three-man competition at Notre Dame this spring and quickly landed at Syracuse, where he\u2019ll have to beat out LSU transfer Rickie Collins. Angeli demonstrated strong poise in a relief appearance in the Orange Bowl last season and looked good in a start against a decimated Oregon State team in the Sun Bowl the year before that. Outside of that, his game is still a mystery.\nBrendon Lewis\nLewis took a substantial step forward at Nevada in 2024 after years of subpar play. He\u2019s a true dual-threat, and he displayed enough of those abilities for Memphis, one of the most consistent G5s in the country, to bet on him at quarterback.\n\u201cI thought he improved a lot last year,\u201d a G5 general manager said. \u201cGave us some issues, does a lot with his legs.\u201d\nZach Calzada\nThe sixth-year senior has had an eventful journey. He led Texas A&M to a landmark upset of Alabama in 2021 but transferred to Auburn in 2022, where a shoulder surgery knocked him out for the year. He found a home at FCS Incarnate Word, where he was the Southland Conference Player of the Year and led the Cardinals to the playoffs.\nNow he\u2019s back in the SEC in hopes of proving he can excel at that level.\n\u201cHe has one of the strongest arms in the country,\u201d an SEC assistant said. \u201cHe\u2019ll have to clean up some things from a touch and accuracy standpoint, but he can absolutely rip the ball.\u201d\nTommy Castellanos\nCastellanos was benched by Boston College last November and left the team before the season ended. Now, a Florida State program that desperately needs a culture reset is taking a chance on him and his former coach at UCF, offensive coordinator Gus Malzahn.\n\u201cWhen you ask him to be a quarterback, he struggles. But if you get him going as a runner and allow him easy access throws, then he gets confident, he can play,\u201d an ACC personnel director said.\nMaverick McIvor\nCould McIvor be Bailey Zappe 2.0 for the Hilltoppers? He\u2019s following a similar path. Like Zappe, he came oh-so-close to upsetting Texas Tech while quarterbacking an FCS program (Abilene Christian lost 52-51 to the Red Raiders in overtime last year, as McIvor threw for 506 yards). He followed Rick Bowie, his ACU offensive coordinator, to WKU, like Zappe did with Zach Kittley. And McIvor comes with tools. \u201cI think he has the best arm in the league,\u201d a G5 scouting director said.\n\u201cStands big in the pocket, delivers strikes down the field, strong arm and can run,\u201d a G5 head coach said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a chance to have a big year.\u201d\nParker Navarro\nIn his first year as a starter after Kurtis Rourke\u2019s departure, Navarro dazzled, leading the Bobcats to the MAC championship and winning Cure Bowl MVP honors. Navarro\u2019s legs are his best asset: He racked up 1,046 rushing yards and 18 touchdowns to go with 2,423 passing yards.\n\u201cHe\u2019s elusive, he\u2019s hard to tackle,\u201d a G5 head coach said. \u201cHe\u2019s not the best pure thrower, but he\u2019s a winner.\u201d\nColton Joseph\nIn eight starts as a redshirt freshman, Joseph dazzled with his dual-threat ability. He ran for 647 yards and 11 touchdowns to go with 1,627 passing yards. Opposing coaches see a rising star.\n\u201cHe's super dynamic,\u201d a former G5 personnel director said. \u201cHis athleticism can change the game, and they scheme it up really well.\u201d\nTayven Jackson\nJackson, who is competing with Cam Fancher and Jacurri Brown, was Indiana\u2019s opening-day starter in 2023 before being replaced midseason by Brendan Sorsby. He backed up Kurtis Rourke last season and excelled in limited action. He has good size and velocity on his throws and can move. But he\u2019s on his third stop (he played at Tennessee in 2022). Can he be a consistent, winning QB for an entire season?\nAnthony Colandrea\nGood luck predicting whether Colandrea, a transfer from Virginia, will produce an amazing play or a costly turnover from one down to the next. But coach Dan Mullen is good with quarterbacks and could fine-tune Colandrea\u2019s game.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a casual fan just watching the game, you enjoy it,\u201d a former Power 4 scouting director said. \u201cIf you work for the team he plays for, you hold your breath a little bit. If Mullen\u2019s gonna do his traditional stuff, Colandrea\u2019s gonna be a great fit.\u201d\nTucker Gleason\nGleason is big and mobile (364 rushing yards, seven rushing TDs), which makes him a load to bring down and comes in handy in the red zone. He did some of his best work last year against Power 4 opponents, leading the Rockets to wins over Mississippi State and Pitt with a combined 636 passing yards and six touchdowns. He should be even better in his second year as Toledo\u2019s full-time starter.\nByrum Brown\nComing off a phenomenal 2023 season, Brown would\u2019ve been much higher on this list a year ago. But the dual-threat playmaker was underwhelming and injured last season. Which version will show up in 2025?\n\u201cWhen there are good things happening, they\u2019re good,\u201d a former P4 scouting director said. \u201cBut he\u2019s been there for three years now and it doesn\u2019t feel like someone you can parse yet. \u2026 If it clicks, sure, you can take a chance on that.\"\nDequan Finn\nIt\u2019s a return to the MAC for Finn, the league\u2019s 2023 MVP at Toledo. Finn struggled in a brief stint at the Power 4 last year at Baylor, and an injury two weeks into the season opened the door for Sawyer Robertson, who never relinquished the job.\nWith the RedHawks, can Finn recapture the success he had his first time around in the conference?\n\u201cHe\u2019s a big, raw, pull-the-ball-down-and-go guy,\u201d a G5 head coach said. \u201cNot a pure polished quarterback but a good player who\u2019s strong.\u201d\nGrayson James\nJames is a good-looking athlete, has a good arm and is fluid enough to hurt defenses with his legs when the situation calls for it. He\u2019s involved in a competition with Alabama transfer Dylan Lonergan, but James has an edge in experience \u2014 both in Boston College\u2019s offense and from his three seasons and 422 passing attempts at FIU. That should give him a leg up.\nBrendan Sullivan\nSullivan has never been a full-time starter but has a shot at Tulane this season if he can beat out Ball State transfer Kadin Semonza, who was productive in the MAC. Sullivan is the more athletic, dynamic option but still has work to do as a passer. The Green Wave have been one of the better G5 programs over the past three seasons, so this is an intriguing situation to monitor.\nAthan Kaliakmanis\nKaliakmanis has attempted 800 passes over the past three seasons for two Big Ten programs (Minnesota and Rutgers). We have a pretty good idea of what he is at this point: a so-so passer who completes around 53 percent of his throws. He was the first Rutgers quarterback to cross the 2,000-yard passing mark since 2015, so he has provided some stability under center for the Scarlet Knights.\nHauss Hejny\nHejny (pronounced hey-knee) is competing with Zane Flores, but his familiarity with OC Doug Meachem, who was at TCU with Hejny, and QB coach Kevin Johns, whom Hejny originally committed to at Duke before flipping to the Horned Frogs, gives him an edge.\nThere\u2019s very little experience to draw upon: He only took 18 snaps in four games as a true freshman last year. But the ball rockets out of the hand of the former Elite 11 QB, and he possesses 10.6-second speed in the 100-meter dash.\n\u201cHe is a little shorter, but the kid is a tough son of a b\u2014,\u201d a Power 4 coordinator said.\nBen Finley\nFinley helped Akron to four wins last season, the program's most since 2018. The former NC State and Cal QB can zip the ball to any part of the yard and has enough mobility to pick up a first down or create conflict in a defense.\n\u201cHe\u2019s super underrated, but I think he could be an NFL prospect,\u201d a G5 head coach said. \u201cHe can absolutely sling it.\u201d\nJaylen Raynor\nRaynor is a very entertaining watch because he\u2019s athletic and slippery in the pocket, which allows him to keep plays alive that would normally be doomed. He\u2019s entering his third year as the Red Wolves\u2019 starter, and that experience will make him one of the best signal callers in the Sun Belt.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the best pure QB in the league that\u2019s returning,\u201d said a personnel staffer who worked in the Sun Belt last season.\nAlonza Barnett\nThis is a very interesting situation. Barnett was a dual-threat standout for the Dukes last season but suffered a serious knee injury that kept him out of the bowl game and spring practice. Coach Bob Chesney brought in UNLV transfer Matthew Sluka, who played for Chesney at Holy Cross. Sluka famously left the Rebels last September after an NIL dispute.\nSluka is a good insurance option and has history with the staff, but Barnett offers higher upside \u2014 health permitting.\n\u201cIf he can stay healthy and get back to a consistent level of play, he could get some P4 attention,\u201d a former P4 scouting director said.\nNicholas Vattiato\nVattiato is coming off back-to-back 3,000-yard passing seasons and has a chance to hit 10,000 career passing yards with another productive year. He has no issues pushing the ball down the field or freelancing to make a play on the run.\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the purest passers in the conference,\u201d a G5 head coach said. \u201cExtremely level-headed. Nothing rattles him and he\u2019s extremely consistent.\u201d\nWalker Eget\nEget started just seven games last season but still passed for 2,504 yards. He fits the gunslinger mold, and he isn\u2019t afraid to test the defense vertically. Eget is also a surprisingly good athlete for his size. There\u2019s little doubt he\u2019ll post big numbers in Craig Stutzmann\u2019s spread-and-shred offense, especially now that Eget is armed with the confidence of being the clear starter for the first time in his career.\nJoe Fagnano\nFagnano\u2019s 20 touchdown passes last season (on 206 pass attempts across 10 games and six starts) were the most by a UConn QB since 2017. He\u2019s a steady presence and displays an array of skills, from patience in the pocket as he works through progressions to a willingness to deliver the ball as a defender is closing in for a hit. He possesses good touch on downfield passes and good velocity in the intermediate game.\nBrayden Fowler-Nicolosi\nColorado State asked Fowler-Nicolosi to do less last season, which created more offensive balance and cut down on the 16 interceptions he threw in 2023. Fowler-Nicolosi is talented and experienced. Can he put all the tools together to elevate himself toward the top of the league?\n\u201cI didn\u2019t necessarily feel like he was an absolute world beater. But I do think he\u2019s a solid quarterback,\u201d one G5 head coach said. \u201cHe\u2019s a good player. There just wasn\u2019t a level of fear when we played him.\u201d\nDevin Brown\nBrown was involved in a competition for the starting role at Ohio State each of the past two seasons but never claimed the job. He\u2019s the front-runner to do so at his new home, Cal, as it moves to a new offensive coordinator, Bryan Harsin. Brown doesn\u2019t have an overwhelming arm, but he is a willing runner. We\u2019ll see how that translates to Harsin\u2019s offense and whether Brown can hold off true freshman Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele.\nMalachi Singleton\nAll but four of Singleton\u2019s 28 pass attempts at Arkansas came in blowouts last season: a win over Arkansas Pine-Bluff and a loss to Ole Miss. While he\u2019s a major unknown, Singleton should be a plus in the run game at the very least. He hasn\u2019t been named the starter but is the favorite for the job. Former Boilermaker quarterback Ryan Browne transferred back to the program this spring and could be in the mix along with Evans Chuba.\nKeyone Jenkins\nJenkins is a difference maker in CUSA. Entering his third year as a starter, he is one of the league\u2019s better passers and a good enough athlete to move the chains.\n\u201cWhen he has time, he\u2019s dropping dimes,\u201d a G5 head coach said. \u201cArm strength isn\u2019t overwhelming. His expertise is over-the-middle throws, hitting digs and spots.\u201d\nEJ Warner\nWarner, a former starter at Temple, has a lot of career production (8,814 yards) but needs a better scheme fit than what he had last year at Rice, where he was a bit out of his comfort zone and the turnovers piled up.\n\u201cHe struggles to push the ball down the field, but he\u2019s smart enough to take the checkdowns and know where the ball should go,\u201d a G5 defensive coordinator said. \u201cIf (Fresno State is) able to do some things maybe more West Coast-style, to use his skill set, he\u2019ll be better off.\u201d\nRobby Ashford\nAshford is at his fourth school and looking to finish his career off by claiming the starting job in coach Jake Dickert\u2019s first season at Wake Forest. Ashford only has one season of starting experience (Auburn, 2022), and his career passing numbers are fairly underwhelming. But he can be a strong threat in the run game at the very least, assuming he can hold off Charlotte transfer Deshawn Purdie for the No. 1 spot.\nDrake Lindsey\nLindsey will be one of the least experienced quarterbacks in the Big Ten. His main competition for the role, Zach Pyron, transferred out of the program during the spring, so he\u2019s the overwhelming favorite to start. Max Brosmer was fine for Minnesota last year but had to adjust to the FBS level after five seasons at New Hampshire. There will be growing pains for Lindsey, who has attempted just five passes in his college career.\nJustyn Martin\nTrue freshman Malik Washington is the future at quarterback for the Terrapins. It\u2019s just a matter of when that future arrives. In the meantime, Maryland can rely on Martin, who played sparingly (one start) in three seasons at UCLA. Either way, the Terrapins will start a relatively green player at quarterback this fall.\nDewayne Coleman\nBryson Daly did so much for the Black Knights in 2024 and finished sixth in Heisman voting. It\u2019ll be really difficult for anyone to fill that void, but Coleman is going to get the first crack at it. His lack of experience \u2014 one career start against a sub-.500 Air Force team last season \u2014 is why he\u2019s low on this list. He\u2019ll have a chance to be productive in this offense.\nBryson Barnes\nBarnes isn\u2019t going to wow anyone as a passer, but he emerged as a very credible run threat at the end of last season, rushing for 193 yards against San Diego State and 185 against Colorado State. There\u2019s a new staff in place \u2014 Bronco Mendenhall is the new head coach \u2014 but Barnes\u2019 running ability makes him the surest bet among the Aggies' quarterback candidates.\nElijah Brown\nBrown doesn\u2019t have the strongest arm, is only an OK athlete and lacks experience. But he\u2019s the only quarterback on the roster who threw a pass for Stanford last season, so that makes him the leader in the race for the starting role. UCF transfer Dylan Rizk could be a factor. Interim coach Frank Reich has no ties to either quarterback. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how this situation unfolds.\nKatin Houser\nHouser, a former Michigan State transfer, is a gamer. He oozes confidence, and it shows when he uncorks a downfield throw. It can get him into trouble at times, as evidenced by his interception total. And he played last season with a fractured wrist, which was repaired after the season. But given his arm strength and above-average mobility, there\u2019s a lot to like.\nJacob Clark\nClark, a seventh-year senior who spent his first three seasons at Minnesota, broke out in 2024, averaging over 300 passing yards per game while averaging nearly 10 yards per attempt. As the Bears move up to the FBS, Clark has a chance to immediately be one of CUSA\u2019s best passers.\n\u201cArm strength isn\u2019t a question mark; it comes out of his hand quickly,\u201d a G5 personnel director said. \u201cHe has a smooth, consistent release. He\u2019s not the most athletic guy, but athletic enough to make guys miss.\u201d\nJC French IV\nFrench leads all Sun Belt returnees in 2024 passing yards (2,831), and he set a single-season school record for completion percentage. \u201cHe\u2019s got a pretty good arm,\u201d a former G5 personnel director said. \u201cThey throw a lot of back-shoulder fades, and they trust him to make a bunch of throws.\u201d Ball security will be paramount for French, who threw two pick sixes last year.\nEthan Vasko\nVasko, who started his career at Kansas but spent the last two years at Coastal Carolina, is a big, tough dual threat with a fierce playing style. He should be an ideal fit for Jamey Chadwell\u2019s spread option attack.\n\u201cVasko is a way better runner than he is a thrower,\u201d a former G5 personnel director said. \u201cHe\u2019ll run all the option stuff really well, and he\u2019s good enough as a thrower for that offense.\u201d\nDrew Pyne\nThe well-traveled Pyne is on his fourth stop after tours at Notre Dame, Arizona State and Missouri. He started 10 games with the Irish in 2022, going 8-2, but departed when it became clear they were taking a transfer quarterback. He had highs (three TD passes in a win over Oklahoma) and lows (three interceptions in a loss to Alabama) at Mizzou. But coaches are optimistic about his future at Bowling Green.\n\"He\u2019s a little undersized, but he has a chance to be a good player in that league,\u201d a G5 head coach said.\nMcCae Hillstead\nAfter Jake Retzlaff\u2019s departure, the Cougars will enter the year without any quarterback who took a snap for them last fall. Hillstead (Utah State) and Treyson Bourguet (Western Michigan) transferred to BYU before the 2024 season but didn\u2019t see the field. Former Stanford signee Bear Bachmeier also transferred in this spring and may have the highest upside of the bunch, but it seems unlikely the Cougars will trot out a true freshman come Aug. 30.\nBoth Hillstead and Bourguet have starting experience from their previous stops, but coaches haven\u2019t tipped their hand. Bourguet is the bigger of the two (6-2, 205) but Hillstead is the more mobile, showing elusiveness and good instincts in the pocket. His diminutive stature is hard to get over (5-10 feels like a generous listing), but he processes quickly, and his arm strength is sufficient.\nChubba Purdy\nThis will be Purdy\u2019s sixth season in college, but it\u2019s lining up to be his first as a full-time starter. He has completed only 54.8 percent of his passes in his career and has thrown more interceptions (eight) than touchdowns (seven), so he will have to take a significant step forward in that area. He does have decent mobility, though, which should give Nevada\u2019s staff something to work with.\nAJ Swann\nSwann, who is competing with Iowa State transfer JJ Kohl, started 12 games in two seasons at Vanderbilt before a brief detour to LSU last season. Swann has the type of zip on his throws you\u2019d expect from someone his size and enough mobility to evade the pass rush. But turnovers were an issue in his last year at Vanderbilt, and he has yet to complete 60 percent of his throws in a season.\nBrad Jackson\nThere\u2019s a boatload of quarterbacks in San Marcos. In addition to Jackson, Holden Geriner (Auburn), Nate Yarnell (Pitt) and Keldric Luster (SMU) all arrived this offseason. But don\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s Jackson, the redshirt freshman returnee, who emerges from the competition.\nHe was primarily used as a runner last season to take advantage of his speed and agility, but he\u2019s an accurate passer as well. Lack of experience is his biggest issue.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s going to be really special,\u201d a Power 4 coordinator said. \u201cI think he\u2019ll be there a year or two and then he\u2019ll be a Power 4 kid.\u201d\nEvan Simon\nNew coach K.C. Keeler brought in former Idaho and Oregon State quarterback Gevani McCoy in the spring portal window, but Simon is in position to win the job. Simon started nine games last season for the Owls, throwing for 2,032 yards. He has gotten a lot of buy-in from the team and staff in the offseason. If Keeler runs an offense similar to what he had at Sam Houston, McCoy, who\u2019s the more athletic quarterback, figures to have a role.\nMJ Morris\nMorris, a former NC State and Maryland QB, figures to have a leg up on fellow transfer Emmett Brown (San Jose State) because of his familiarity with Chanticleers head coach Tim Beck. Morris was recruited to NC State by Beck when he was the offensive coordinator for the Wolfpack.\n\u201cHe has a really good understanding of the game and a good arm,\u201d a former G5 recruiting director said.\nMicah Alejado\nAlejado started Hawaii\u2019s regular-season finale and turned in an awesome performance with 469 passing yards and five touchdowns. We know Alejado was talented enough to start at a high school power like Bishop Gorman (Las Vegas). We also know that his size is a concern. Will he be able to hold up for a whole season? If he can, Hawaii may have found a diamond in the rough.\nZach Pyron\nPyron is a good runner for his size but is inconsistent and inaccurate as a passer, which his career 56.8 completion percentage demonstrates. But South Alabama needed to find someone after Gio Lopez left the program in mid-April and transferred to North Carolina. So Pyron found a landing spot in his home state, and based on experience alone, he should be in line to start for the Jaguars this fall.\nJalen Kitna\nUAB coach Trent Dilfer is high on Kitna, saying in May that the QB has an NFL skill set and compares favorably to past Elite 11 passers he tutored. It shows in Kitna\u2019s arm; the ball whizzes off his hand and gets to its target quickly. But the interception rate needs to come down as he enters his second year as a starter.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that he\u2019s in the upper echelon quite yet, but he\u2019s a really good, solid player,\u201d a G5 defensive coordinator said.\nZevi Eckhaus\nIt feels like Washington State, at the very least, always has someone intriguing at quarterback. Eckhaus backed up John Mateer last season and started the Holiday Bowl. Eckhaus looked a little Mateer-lite, producing on short-to-intermediate-range throws while showing good mobility. But he forced some risky passes, which led to two picks.\nEckhaus will also have to adapt to a new coaching staff and a new set of receivers after the Cougars lost their top two wideouts from a year ago.\nBrandon Rose\nThe Utah transfer is short on experience, with only three appearances and 86 career snaps, all coming last year. Rose did show some poise and decent skill in his lone career start, in the Holy War against rival BYU. He throws a solid ball and is confident enough to attack the middle of the field. He has enough straight-line speed to be accounted for as a runner. But he\u2019s not immune to a turnover; he threw two interceptions in 36 attempts last season.\nHe suffered a lower leg injury against BYU that kept him out of spring ball, but if he\u2019s healthy in time for camp, he\u2019ll be well-positioned for the job. Yale transfer Grant Jordan and returnee AJ Hairston are also in the mix.\nJack Layne\nLayne is a promising passer when given proper protection but won\u2019t contribute much in the run game. What should give him a boost this fall is familiarity. He followed coach Jason Eck and offensive coordinator Luke Schleusner from Idaho to New Mexico. So while Layne will be taking a step up in competition, at least he\u2019ll be comfortable in the offense.\nAidan Armenta\nThere were some freshman growing pains for Armenta last season, but he also showed poise, leading the Warhawks to wins in his first two starts. He\u2019ll have to rein in the turnovers, but there\u2019s reason for optimism.\n\u201cHe really throws the ball pretty well,\u201d a Power 4 offensive coordinator said. \u201cI\u2019d expect him to take a pretty big jump.\u201d\nTa'Quan Roberson\nRoberson is looking to start in his seventh and final season after stops at Penn State, UConn and Kansas State. Most of his game experience came in 2023, when he started 10 games at UConn. He has only one start outside of that season. He displays solid mechanics and a quick release and is an adequate runner.\nWalker Howard\nHoward was an Elite 11 quarterback in the 2021 class but has seen minimal playing time while buried on the depth chart at LSU and Ole Miss. He\u2019s attempted a combined 10 passes in three seasons and only two last year. In Lafayette, Howard should finally get to prove himself.\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely got a whip and he can control it,\u201d a G5 defensive coordinator said. \u201cHe can throw 60 yards off his back foot to the far hash.\u201d\nHunter Watson\nThis is an interesting situation to watch. Watson started 12 games last year and helped lead Sam Houston to its breakout 10-3 campaign in Year 2 of FBS membership. He\u2019s a battering ram as a runner (647 yards, nine TDs) but not an elite thrower. New coach Phil Longo is bringing his Air Raid-inspired scheme to Huntsville, along with a former four-star recruit he signed at Wisconsin, Mabrey Mettauer.\n\u201c(Watson) was great for what their system was last year with the QB run game and power read,\u201d a Power 4 offensive coordinator said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s a good system fit for Longo and what they do, dropping back, throwing the football.\u201d\nThree coaches we spoke with felt Watson is one of the best QBs in CUSA, though. \u201cI love that kid,\u201d a G5 head coach said. \u201cTough as nails.\u201d\nReese Poffenbarger\nThe sixth-year senior is on his fourth school after stops at Old Dominion, Albany and Miami. His only substantial action was at the FCS level, throwing for 6,000-plus yards and 60 touchdowns in two seasons for Albany. He threw seven passes at Miami last season.\n\u201cI really like Poffenbarger. I loved him at Albany,\u201d a G5 head coach said. \u201cHe\u2019s got some s\u2014 to him. He\u2019s got some damn moxie. He ain\u2019t gonna lack confidence. He can sling it around.\u201d\nHe\u2019ll have to fend off Drew Mestemaker, a former walk-on who had 448 total yards and three touchdowns in North Texas\u2019 bowl game in December.\nGoose Crowder\nCrowder started the first four games of the 2024 season before being sidelined by injuries. The former West Virginia transfer doesn\u2019t have a huge arm or elite athleticism, but he\u2019s accurate and mobile enough to escape trouble. He showed poise in the lone crunch-time situation he faced, leading a touchdown drive in the final minute vs. Nevada. He just needs more reps; he has just 219 career snaps entering his fifth season.\nConner Harrell\nHarrell, a North Carolina transfer, is one of three newcomers at QB, joining Grayson Loftis (Duke) and Zach Wilcke (junior college). Harrell has the most intriguing skill set of the bunch with an extra gear in the running game. He still has much to prove as a passer, though.\nJayden Denegal\nCoach Sean Lewis is still searching for the right trigger man for his fast-paced offense as he enters his second season at San Diego State. Enter Denegal, a transfer from Michigan who hasn't thrown a pass in a game since 2023. Denegal is an imposing physical presence with a strong arm and good athleticism. He still needs to beat out Central Michigan transfer Bert Emanuel Jr., who is a dynamic running threat.\nEvan Bullock\nBullock fits into the traditional mold: a big, dropback passer. He worked his way up from third on the depth chart to start the final 10 games last season. He won\u2019t produce jaw-dropping highlights or wow anyone with his athleticism, but he\u2019s accurate and keeps the ball out of harm\u2019s way.\n\u201cHe's 6-5, has got a good arm and can sling it, but his decision-making is what's gonna give those guys a chance to win every game,\u201d a G5 head coach said.\nNoah Kim\nKim started five games at Michigan State in 2023 before transferring to Coastal Carolina, where he backed up Ethan Vasko last year. When in the pocket and in rhythm, Kim can make some impressive throws. But coaches who have seen him believe he can get easily rattled.\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a pretty good arm,\u201d a former G5 personnel director said. \u201cHe should be a solid-to-above average MAC quarterback, as long as he\u2019s got his confidence back.\u201d\nKaden Anderson\nAnderson started three games for Wyoming and showed some promising flashes as a passer, particularly in a 49-45 win against New Mexico, but the overall performance during those contests was a mixed bag. Still, he has an advantage in the Cowboys\u2019 QB competition based on the experience he gained last November.\nDexter Williams II\nIt\u2019s been a long road to significant playing time for the sixth-year senior, who endured two major knee injuries in his four years at Indiana. Williams appeared in five games in a reserve role at Georgia Southern last year and has just 68 career pass attempts but is trending toward being the starter at Kennesaw State. If healthy, Williams is an intriguing dual threat: The ball flies off his hand, and he\u2019s shifty when on the move.\nChristian Veilleux\nVeilleux made two Power 4 stops \u2014 Penn State and Pitt \u2014 before arriving at Georgia State last year and starting seven games. He was productive but inconsistent. He has thrown 20 touchdowns and 19 interceptions in his last two seasons.\n\u201cBig, good-looking kid who can really throw it, but he\u2019s hit-or-miss,\u201d a Power 4 coordinator said.\nJoe Labas\nLabas started CMU\u2019s first six games before an arm injury sidelined him for the rest of the season. He has the velocity to fire the ball into tight windows over the middle or make teams pay downfield. But he\u2019ll have to take much better care of the ball. Labas threw interceptions in half of his 2024 starts, including a five-INT outing in a blowout loss to FIU.\nJosh Holst\nIn a true QB battle, Holst led coming out of spring over former Arkansas-Pine Bluff transfer Jalen Macon, who\u2019s bigger (6-5, 230) and talented but raw. Holst started three games last year, including the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl, where he won MVP honors. He\u2019s a true dual threat and doesn\u2019t lack confidence, but he and Macon are inexperienced.\nLogan Fife\nThe former Fresno State and Montana quarterback should bring a steady, consistent presence to the Aggies, who need it. Two coaches we spoke with believe Fife slots in as a mid-tier CUSA starter because of his lack of elite traits. \u201cSolid arm, makes solid decisions,\u201d a G5 scouting director said.\n\u201cTakes care of the ball, manages the game well and is an accurate passer,\u201d a G5 head coach said. \u201cOn tape, nothing struck me as a redeeming quality, but he\u2019s crisp and fundamentally sound.\u201d\nZach Marker\nThe Blue Hens, who make their FBS debut in 2025, played three QBs last year, including two returnees: Marker and Nick Minicucci, who each have six career starts. Marker took a redshirt year in 2024 but played in four games \u2014 and played well, throwing for 1,011 yards despite coming off an ACL injury. He showed flashes of his athleticism but doesn\u2019t have the biggest arm.\nBroc Lowry\nThe Broncos may have one of the most inexperienced QB depth charts in the country. Lowry, a former Indiana transfer, has the most FBS pass attempts (nine) on the team. He was used regularly in designed quarterback runs last season and displayed significant speed and a tough running style that allows him to run through contact. Two of his three touchdown runs last season involved broken tackles.\nMalachi Nelson\nThe 2023 five-star recruit is at his third stop after one year at USC and one at Boise State, where Maddux Madsen beat him out for the starting job last year. Locked in a quarterback battle with returning starter Skyler Locklear in El Paso is not where anyone pictured Nelson at this point.\nThough Locklear has the experience edge, Nelson will have a good shot at the starting job, spending this summer catching up. The Miners will probably bet on Nelson\u2019s physical talent and upside, but he has attempted just 20 passes in two college seasons.\nKiael Kelly\nKelly has traveled a unique path to potentially being QB1 at Ball State. He started six games in 2023 but was more of a run threat than a passer. He entered the portal after the season but returned to Ball State and changed positions. He took limited snaps at quarterback, receiver and running back in 2024 and re-entered the portal after a coaching change, but new coach Mike Uremovich convinced him to return and promised him a true shot at quarterback in an offense that will fit his athleticism (724 rushing yards, seven TDs in 2023).\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good runner, but I don\u2019t know what kind of thrower he is,\u201d a G5 head coach said.\nKirk Francis\nFrancis had a tough first year as the starter, struggling through poor offensive line play and an injury. He possesses a quick release and nice touch on downfield throws, and he can throw from multiple arm slots. But he has limited mobility and needs to trim the turnovers.\nZion Turner\nTurner hasn\u2019t received extended snaps since 2022 at UConn. His production was underwhelming, but he was only a true freshman at the time. He\u2019s attempted just six passes since then, so he\u2019s a pretty big question mark for a Marshall program that will have turned over much of its roster and coaching staff from last year's Sun Belt title team. Syracuse transfer Carlos Del Rio-Wilson will be in the mix, but Turner played for offensive coordinator Rod Smith at Jacksonville State last year.\nChase Jenkins\nJenkins hasn\u2019t attempted a pass since his true freshman season in 2023, but that\u2019s likely to change. New Rice coach Scott Abell is bringing the gun option that he used to marked success at Davidson. Rice\u2019s other two quarterbacks, AJ Padgett and Drew Devillier, are more suited for the pro-style attack the Owls used previously. Jenkins has real burst and is a more natural fit for the offense. But with just 19 career pass attempts and 15 rush attempts, he will have a learning curve as he steps into the starting role.\nGavin Wimsatt\nThe former Rutgers starter, who played in a reserve role at Kentucky last season, brings good size and athleticism to the Gamecocks. Wimsatt has rushed for a combined 680 yards and 13 touchdowns the last two seasons, but his throwing accuracy is lacking: his career completion percentage is 46.2. He also has more career interceptions (21) than touchdown passes (17).\nDevin Kargman\nKargman started the Golden Flashes' first four games before an injury against Penn State knocked him out for the year. He can put tremendous velocity on the ball behind his large frame, but his inconsistent accuracy can make it difficult to establish a rhythm in the passing game. He\u2019ll have to be on target much more than he was in 2024. Fordham transfer CJ Montes, who was an All-Patriot League pick in 2023 but missed most of last season with an injury, is also in the mix.\nJosh Johnson\nJohnson\u2019s sample size is extremely small (14 pass attempts, 14 rushes), but he\u2019s the only quarterback on the Falcons' roster who has played in a college game. Air Force had one of the worst offenses in the country last year and will likely turn to Johnson. His speed should help in the run game, but he is limited as a passer. Sophomore Liam Szarka is also a candidate for the job.\n(Illustration: Will Tullos / The Athletic; Photos: John Byrum, Tim Warner, Julio Aguilar, Robin Alam / Getty Images )"
