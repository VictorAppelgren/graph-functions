  "content": "It's back-to-school season for Catholic schools across South Florida, and for the Archdiocese of Miami, this year marks another milestone.\n\nOn Tuesday, officials welcomed 37,000 students into classrooms across its 65 schools, continuing a five-year trend of rising enrollment.\n\nCatholic school leaders say a combination of curriculum, safety measures and scholarships is fueling the growth. That demand has led to the opening of new campuses, including Holy Rosary Saint Richard in Palmetto Bay.\n\nIt's the first program in the Archdiocese to welcome students as young as three months old.\n\nUniforms were crisp, backpacks hung on hooks, and crayons were in students' hands. Three-year-old Jesse Barnes proudly declared his favorite part of the day: \"Dinosaurs!\" Two-year-old Greyson Puerto offered his own one-word review\u2014\"Yeah!\"\u2014while his mother, Elizabeth, admitted to first-day jitters.\n\n\"I wanted him to know I'd be back and I wasn't leaving him,\" she said. \"He's so happy\u2026 he said he had the best day ever.\"\n\nOver the past five years, the Archdiocese says it has opened or reopened four new schools to keep up with demand.\n\nSaint Malachy Catholic School in Tamarac, for example, grew from 25 students in its first year to 125 this year.\n\nParents like Christina Hileire say faith is a driving factor. \"We felt like he would have the best education,\" she said.\n\nThe surge in Catholic school enrollment comes as Broward County Public Schools anticipates a decline of at least 8,000 students this year.\n\nDistrict officials point to school choice, state vouchers, and family relocations as contributing factors\u2014the same trends boosting Catholic school numbers.\n\nFlorida's Step Up For Students scholarship program has also made Catholic education more accessible.\n\nIn Broward County, awards range from $7,600 to just over $8,300 for students in kindergarten through 12th grade. In Miami-Dade, eligible students can receive up to $8,500, and in Monroe County, scholarships are between $11,000 and nearly $12,000.\n\nSafety remains a priority. Catholic school officials say they have invested in security cameras, gates, and teacher training to ensure student well-being.\n\nPublic school enrollment figures in Broward and Miami-Dade won't be finalized until after Labor Day.",

      "text": "Haitian Catholics in Miami celebrate first Sunday service with Pope Leo XIV, who has Haitian roots\nHaitian Catholics at Notre Dame D'Haiti Church gathered for a historic Sunday service, celebrating the first sermon from Pope Leo XIV \u2014 marking not only the first American pontiff but also the first with Haitian heritage.\nEliette Silver, a longtime parishioner who has attended the Miami church for 40 years, said she never imagined sharing cultural roots with the head of the Catholic Church.\n\"It says to the world that you're a great nation. Haiti is a great nation. Haitian is a great people,\" she said.\nThe significance of Pope Leo's first Sunday sermon resonated deeply with the congregation.\n\"Let us ask our Heavenly Father and assist us in living in service to one another, each according to his or her state of life,\" the pope said in his message, delivered from the Vatican and translated for global audiences.\nPope Leo XIV has Haitian family ties\nBorn Robert Francis Prevost in Chicago in 1955, Pope Leo XIV has maternal ties to Haiti.\nCBS News obtained records showing his maternal grandfather was Haitian and his grandmother was from New Orleans. His brother, John Prevost, confirmed in an interview with CBS This Morning that their mother's parents were Haitian.\nThe timing of the pope's first address couldn't be more symbolic, as it coincides with Haitian Heritage Month \u2014 a moment of celebration and pride for a community grappling with turmoil back home.\nA message of hope for Haiti amid crisis\nFather Reginald Jean-Mary, who leads Notre Dame D'Haiti Church, acknowledged the emotional impact of the new pope's background.\n\"They are very happy to know that. It is uplifting because Haiti is very down at this moment. The spirit is very low,\" he said.\nWith Haiti in the grip of political instability and gang violence, Jean-Mary expressed hope that Pope Leo could help inspire peace.\n\"It's the moment for all Haitians, all those resources, to form a bank of human resources so we can revitalize the face and despair of Haiti,\" he said.\nThe sense of unity and spiritual renewal was palpable as Miami's Haitian community embraced this historic papacy as a source of hope and global recognition."
