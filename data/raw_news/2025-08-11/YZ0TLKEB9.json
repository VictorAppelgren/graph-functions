  "description": "The best hairball control cat food contains vet-recommended fiber. Our top picks are dry and wet food for hairball prevention and a healthy coat.",
  "content": "If your cat coughs up one or more hairballs every week, it's worth asking your veterinarian if they recommend switching their diet to the best hairball control cat food. Hairballs aren't just messy \u2014 they can pose a serious health risk if they get stuck in your cat's gastrointestinal tract. Hairball control foods are formulated to reduce hairballs and typically contain more insoluble fiber than other recipes. They may also include extra omega-3 fatty acids to support healthier skin and fur and reduce shedding.To find the best options, we consulted vets about what makes a good cat food for hairballs, and then researched dozens of formulas. One standout is Hill's Science Diet Urinary Hairball Control Savory Chicken Entree. This wet food contains added fiber to help cats pass hairballs more easily, along with omega fatty acids to support skin and coat health.All of our picks for the best cat foods below meet the criteria recommended by veterinarians. The recipes also align with the pet food standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) and the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) Global Nutrition Guidelines.Read more about how Insider Reviews tests and researches pet products.Best overall wet: Hill's Science Diet Urinary Hairball Control Savory Chicken - See at ChewyBest overall dry: Royal Canin Hairball Care - See at ChewyBest budget wet: Purina One Indoor and Hairball Ocean Whitefish and Rice - See at ChewyBest budget dry: Iams ProActive Health Indoor Weight and Hairball Care with Chicken and Turkey - See at ChewyBest for seniors: Hill's Science Diet Adult 7+ Indoor Chicken - See at ChewyWet food can help prevent hairballs since it provides extra water, which helps hair move through the digestive system, Dr. Sara Ochoa, a small animal veterinarian at the Animal Hospital of West Monroe. In addition to containing more moisture compared to dry food, the best and healthiest wet cat foods for hairball control should also contain sources of insoluble fiber, like wheat bran, psyllium husks, cellulose, rice hull, and pea fiber. These ingredients help pull hair through the digestive system, says Dr. Jennifer Larsen, a veterinarian and professor of clinical nutrition at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. If you want to compare the fiber content and other nutritional values of wet and dry foods, you'll need to convert the wet food's values to a dry matter basis. This involves removing the moisture from the wet food values and then calculating the nutritional values based on the remaining solids. For this guide, we contacted the manufacturers to get the dry matter nutritional profiles of each food. If you'd like to compare recipes yourself, you can use these directions from the Cummings Veterinary Medical Center at Tufts University, call the food manufacturer, or ask your vet for help.Our recommendations below for the best wet hairball cat foods contain powdered cellulose and exceed 4% fiber, as recommended by the veterinarians we consulted. They also contain omega fatty acids from fish oil and salmon, which may improve skin and coat health and reduce shedding, Ochoa says.  \n              This cat food for hairball control contains insoluble fiber and omega fatty acids to help reduce hairballs and promote healthy skin and coat.\n            HighlightsSpecifics\n          Animal protein sources in this adult wet food are chicken byproducts, pork byproducts, chicken liver, and pork liver. The food is high in fiber, including powdered cellulose. Its nutritional breakdown is 40.3% protein, 14.7% fat, 5.6% fiber, and 55 kcal/3-ounce can.\n        Our experts recommend wet food for hairball control because good hydration decreases the likelihood of hairballs. However, if your cat prefers dry food, Ochoa says you can add water or cat-safe bone broth to their kibble. In addition to containing less moisture, dry cat foods are typically more calorie-dense than canned options, Larsen says. Still, they have plenty of other benefits. For instance, the best and healthiest dry cat food is easier to portion and use in feeder puzzles. Our recommendation from Royal Canin contains psyllium seed husk and pea fiber. Our dry food pick from Hill's includes powdered cellulose. Both foods contain dried beet pulp. Dierenfeld says beet pulp is an ideal fiber source for cats since it contains both soluble and insoluble fiber to pull hair through the intestines and fermentable fiber to feed good bacteria in the gut.\n          This hairball control dry food for adult cats contains chicken byproduct meal and chicken fat as its main protein sources. Fish oil provides omega fatty acids to reduce shedding and added psyllium seed husk and dried plain beet pulp help move hair through the digestive tract. It contains 32% protein, 13% fat, 8.5% fiber, and 342 kcal/cup.\n        \n          This hairball control adult cat food contains animal proteins from chicken and chicken meal. Powdered cellulose and dried beet pulp are added for fiber, and fish oil is a source of omega-3 fatty acids. Its nutritional breakdown is 29.5% protein, 15.5% fat, 6.5% fiber, and 323 kcal/cup.\n        The best budget-friendly cat foods often contain higher proportions of low-cost byproducts, like organ meat and byproduct meals, than premium recipes, but these ingredients are very nutritious. There are many different quality animal-based proteins, including byproducts and byproduct meals, says Ellen Dierenfeld, a comparative animal nutritionist and founder of Zootrition. Cats are obligate carnivores, which means they mainly eat meat and must get their essential amino acids, like taurine, from animal protein sources. That's why our budget picks for the best hairball control cat food include whole meat, byproducts, and meals as the first ingredients. They also contain insoluble fibers, omega fatty acids, and antioxidants to promote better overall health for your cat.\n          This recipe for adult cats contains sources of animal protein such as ocean whitefish, chicken, liver, and pork lungs. Fiber from brown rice and powdered cellulose aid in digestion. The food contains 45.6% protein, 22.2% fat, 9.7% fiber, and 77 kcal/3-ounce can.\n        \n          This hairball control food for adult cats contains salmon, meat byproducts, and chicken as its main protein sources. The omega fatty acids from salmon may reduce shedding and added powdered cellulose helps move hair through the digestive tract. The nutrition profile for this food is 45.7% protein, 30.3% fat, 9.5% fiber, and 84 kcal/3-ounce can.\n        Budget hairball cat foods are a great choice for cat parents who want to prevent hairballs. These foods are affordable and have a long shelf life. Plus, many cats love the crunchy texture. Premium hairball foods may have free-range, wild-caught, or human-grade ingredients, but budget dry foods still provide all the nutrients your cat needs, plus added fiber to move hair through their gastrointestinal tract safely.Our wallet-friendly dry food option from Nutro contains lean chicken proteins to nourish your cat and psyllium seed husk to help pass hairballs. Our pick from Iams is specially formulated with powdered cellulose and beet pulp. \n          This dry adult cat food helps prevent and eliminate hairballs with its added fiber from ground whole grain corn, dried plain beet pulp, and powdered cellulose. Its main protein sources are chicken, chicken byproduct meal, and turkey, and fish oil is a source of omega fatty acids. It contains 30% protein, 13.5% fat, 8.3% fiber, and 302 kcal/cup.\n        \n          Chicken, chicken meal, and chicken fat are the main protein sources in this dry hairball control food for adult cats. It includes beneficial fiber from whole grain brown rice and psyllium husks. The nutrition profile for this recipe is 33% protein, 16% fat, 6% fiber, and 398 kcal/cup.\n        Senior cats may benefit from hairball management food with healthy extras like glucosamine and chondroitin. These ingredients support joint health, which can improve your cat's movement, grooming ability, and overall quality of life. The high fiber content in hairball control foods can also help cats feel full for longer, and weight management is crucial for older cats at risk of joint disease and pain. Just check with your vet before changing your senior cat's diet. Our picks for the best foods for senior cats with hairballs include beneficial extras, joint-supporting ingredients, and insoluble fibers. Our pick from Blue Buffalo contains antioxidants from blueberries and cranberries, which may help lower a cat's risk of degenerative diseases of the liver, kidney, and brain diseases. Hill's senior recipe contains L-carnitine, an amino acid that can help cats lose weight by making it easier to burn fat.\n          This dry senior cat food contains animal protein from chicken. You'll also find fiber from powdered cellulose and dried beet pulp, omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil, antioxidants from vitamin E and cranberries, and fat-burning L-carnitine. Its nutritional breakdown is 34.1% protein, 17% fat, 8.6% fiber, and 316 kcal/cup.\n        \n          This wet food for indoor senior cats counts protein from chicken, chicken broth, and chicken liver. It also contains fiber from powdered cellulose and antioxidants from cranberries, blueberries, and vitamin E. The nutritional profile for this food is 47.7% protein, 32.8% fat, 3.4% fiber, and 170 kcal/5.5-ounce can\n        When shopping for the best cat hairball cat foods, keep the following criteria in mind:AAFCO nutritional adequacy statement for adult maintenance or all life stages: The AAFCO is a nonprofit organization that outlines nutritional recommendations for pet food. An AAFCO statement means the food meets the nutritional needs of cats based on their life stage. You can confirm a cat food is nutritionally complete and balanced for \"adult maintenance\" or \"all life stages\" if it has an AAFCO nutritional adequacy statement on the label. Hairball control foods contain more fiber than most cat food recipes. Because of this, they aren't recommended for kittens. A kitten's developing gastrointestinal tract may have trouble with this much fiber, Ochoa says, adding that while kittens might have an occasional hairball, they groom less frequently than adult cats. In other words, they likely won't need hairball food. Always check with your vet before changing your kitten's diet or giving them any supplements. Guaranteed analysis and nutrient profiles: The guaranteed analysis on a pet food label shows the percentages of important nutrients, including protein, fat, fiber, and other essential vitamins and minerals. Food for adult cats, including seniors, must have a minimum of 26% protein and 9% fat. Ochoa says the best hairball control cat foods generally have high fiber, more than 4% but 6% or more is ideal. Ingredients list: The ingredients on a pet food label appear in order of weight. Cats are obligate carnivores, so meat should appear first on the ingredient list as whole meat, meat meal, or animal byproducts. To help your cat pass hair and reduce the frequency of hairballs, shop for cat food recipes that include both meat protein sources and insoluble fiber sources like wheat bran, psyllium husks, cellulose, rice hull, and pea fiber. Expert formulations: Our picks for the best hairball control cat food come from brands that employ full-time board-certified veterinary nutritionists or PhD-level animal nutritionists. This ensures the food meets nutritional recommendations, includes the right ingredients for cats, and aligns with the WSAVA guidelines and our experts' guidance.Manufacturing standards: When choosing a commercial cat food brand, it's important to consider the manufacturer's quality control measures. Reputable brands should be transparent about the types of tests they conduct, how often they test, and the results of those tests. This information should be easily accessible on the company's website, or brand representatives should provide it on request.Calorie content: The calorie content of cat food is measured in kilocalories (kcal). The best hairball control cat food formulas contain more fiber than other cat foods, which can help keep kitties feeling full. For this reason, cats eating a high-fiber hairball management food may eat less at each meal and be less likely to demand snacks between meals. Just make sure your cat gets the right number of calories each day. Your vet can help you figure out how many calories your cat needs.Food recommendations from veterinarians: If you're considering adding fiber to your cat's food to reduce hairballs, talk to your vet first. Too much fiber or the wrong type of fiber could cause more digestive issues. Your vet can offer more guidance with choosing the best hairball control cat food based on your cat's lifestyle and other health needs.To select the hairball control foods in this guide, we consulted two veterinary nutritionists and a small animal veterinarian. They told us what causes hairballs and what cat food ingredients may help reduce and eliminate them. We then reviewed dozens of AAFCO complete and balanced cat foods to narrow down our top picks.Ellen Dierenfeld is a comparative animal nutritionist with a doctorate in animal nutrition from Cornell University. She is the founder of Zootrition, a software designed to record and evaluate the diets of animals. Diernfeld has over 30 years of experience in zoo, wildlife, and companion animal nutrition.Dr. Jennifer Larsen is a veterinarian, distinguished member of the American College of Veterinary Nutrition, and professor of clinical nutrition at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. Larsen spoke with us about cat nutrition and the role of high-fiber diets in feline nutrition and well-being.Dr. Sara Ochoa is a small animal veterinarian at the Animal Hospital of West Monroe located in Louisiana. Ochoa spoke with us about hairball management in cats and how to reduce their occurrence.The best cat food for hairball control contains more insoluble fiber than other cat food recipes, typically 6% or more fiber compared to less than 4% fiber in other recipes. Some common insoluble fiber ingredients include wheat bran, psyllium husks, cellulose, rice hull, and pea fiber. Hairball food may also include extra omega fatty acids. These can help improve skin and fur health and reduce shedding. The moisture in wet food can help fur pass through the digestive system, Ochoa says. However, if your cat prefers kibble, you have plenty of options for dry cat foods for hairballs. That said, it may be possible to switch your cat to wet food by finding a food with a texture and taste they enjoy. The more they like the food, the greater the chances of a successful transition.Hairball control cat food works by adding bulk to stool with insoluble fiber, which helps pull fur along the digestive tract, Larsen says. As a result, ingested fur is more likely to end up in the litter box, not on your floor as a hairball. Cat food for hairballs doesn't have to be a year-round expense. Ochoa says your cat may only need it during the summer months when they shed more. Talk to your vet about the best approach. Just keep in mind that a change in diet shouldn't replace regularly grooming your cat with one of the best cat brushes, which can also help minimize hairballs. Hairballs cannot be dissolved. Cats can't digest their fur, so they must pass hairballs either in their feces or by coughing them up. The best hairball control cat food can help bulk up the stool, making it easier for hair to pass through the digestive tract. If a hairball becomes too large for a cat to pass, it can cause an intestinal obstruction, and your cat may need surgery. Sometimes, the best hairball remedies for cats and laxatives may also help cats pass hairballs, but only with your vet's recommendation and supervision.",

  "summary": "Insider Reviews has compiled a list of the best cat foods for hairball control, which are formulated to reduce hairballs and typically contain more insoluble fiber than other recipes. The top ten recommendations include Hill's Science Diet Urinary Hairball Control Savory Chicken Entree for wet food, which contains added fiber to help cats pass hairballs more easily and omega fatty acids to support skin and coat health. All of these cat foods meet criteria recommended by veterinarians and align with pet food standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) and the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) Global Nutrition Guidelines. Wet food can prevent hairballs as it provides extra water, which helps hair move through the digestive system. However, dry foods typically contain less moisture and are typically more calorie than canned options. The best wet cat foods are recommended due to their higher fiber content and high protein levels. The recommendations for wet hairball cat foods contain powdered cellulose and exceed 4% fiber, as recommended by experts, and are also recommended by the veterinarians.",

      "text": "Business Insider Reviews has been covering the best pet products for more than five years. Our reporters are experts in the field who have worked as dog trainers, studied veterinary science, and assisted in vet offices. We've also consulted dozens of veterinarians, animal behaviorists, dog trainers, pet safety experts, and devoted pet owners to guide us in recommending products that offer the best quality, value, and safety.\nWhat types of pet products we cover\nFood: After hundreds of hours of interviews and research, we carefully selected the best cat foods and best dog foods. Animal nutritionists and veterinarians guided all of our picks. We've also tested popular fresh dog food, including The Farmer's Dog, Just Food for Dogs, and Ollie, and the best cat food delivery services.\nHealth and wellness: There is an overwhelming number of flea and tick preventatives and pet supplements on the market, but not all are equal. Our reporters consulted veterinarians to find the safest and most effective options for cats and dogs. Read more about them in our guides to the best dog flea and tick treatments, flea treatments for cats, cat dewormers, dog dewormers, dog supplements, and probiotics for dogs. And if you're in a pinch and need some advice, we've also researched the best online veterinarians.\nHarnesses: Some dogs pull on leash; others walk nicely but need a harness that will hold up to rugged outdoor adventures. Our reporters tested harnesses with untrained shelter dogs. They drew from two decades of combined experience as professional dog trainers to bring you the best no-pull dog harnesses and dog harnesses. And because cats can explore the great outdoors, too, we spoke to adventure cat parents to get their picks for the best cat harnesses.\nCat litter and boxes: Cats are finicky about many things, particularly their litter box. We've tested 35 models to choose the best cat litter boxes. We also put dozens of litters to the test for our guides to the best cat litters and natural cat litter.\nGrooming: Regular grooming and dental care are a pet parent's most challenging \u2014 and least enjoyable \u2014 responsibilities. We've tested the best dog nail clippers, dog brushes, and cat brushes. Veterinarians and professional groomers also helped us narrow down the best dog toothpastes, dog dental chews, cat dental products, dog shampoos, and cat shampoos.\nToys: Toys are a big part of the equation when it comes to keeping our pets happy and healthy. But not every cat or dog will appreciate the same puzzles, balls, or scratchers. That's why we've tested dozens of the best dog toys and cat toys and talked to animal behaviorists, dog trainers, and pet parents about their favorite dog toys for aggressive chewers and puppy toys.\nTravel gear: To keep your pets comfortable and safe while traveling, we tested 30 pet carriers for our guides to the best cat carriers for everyday use and the best airline-approved cat carriers. If you're looking to hit the road with your dog, check out our road trip must-haves with tips from pet safety experts.\nOutdoors: Because pet parents spend a lot of time outdoors with their dogs \u2014 on land and water \u2014 we've covered hiking gear, dog life jackets, boots, snow coats, and rain jackets.\nPet training and behavior: Whether you're bringing home a new pet or want to teach an old dog new tricks, our reporter, who is a professional dog trainer, can help you choose a dog muzzle, protect furniture from cat scratching, introduce a new cat and dog, potty train a puppy, train a dog, calm an anxious dog, prevent separation anxiety, and keep kids safe around pets.\nHow we evaluate and test products\nWe approach every article with pet safety and wellness in front of mind. Our testing methodology and product selection criteria are informed by interviews with impartial experts, including veterinarians and animal behaviorists. We devise tests to ensure our recommendations are easy to use, hold up to wear and tear, and keep our pets happy.\nWhen we can't lab test products like flea and tick medications and pet food, we head straight to our experts and consult industry standards from organizations like the World Small Animal Association and the Association of American Feed Control Officials to rigorously evaluate options. Our guides are then vetted by impartial medical reviewers who are licensed veterinarians.\nMeet our expert pets team\n| Our editor, reporters, and medical reviewers | Bios |\n|\nLisa is the senior pets editor for Business Insider Reviews.

      "text": "The average cat is excellent at self-grooming, spending up to half the day cleaning themselves. However, both short- and long-haired cats can benefit when you regularly groom them with one of the best cat brushes or combs. Regular grooming with a brush or comb removes loose hair and distributes natural skin oils throughout a cat's coat, says Dr. Aimee Simpson, a veterinarian and medical director of VCA Cat Hospital of Philadelphia.\nWe tested 31 different grooming tools with four cats to make our recommendations below. Our top pick is the Hartz Groomer's Best Combo Brush, which is designed for daily use with short- and long-haired cats. The two-sided pin and bristle brush removes loose fur, works out small tangles, and smoothes the top coat and delicate hairs on the face.\nRead more about how Business Insider Reviews researches and tests pet products here.\nOur top picks for the best cat brushes\nBest overall: Hartz Groomer's Best Combo Brush - See at Chewy\nBest deshedding: Andis Deshedding Tool - See at Chewy\nBest slicker: Safari Self-Cleaning Slicker Brush for Cats - See at Chewy\nBest comb: Chris Christensen Cat/Carding Buttercomb #013 - See at Amazon\nBest dematting tool: Well & Good Prostyle Dual-Sided Shedding Rake - See at Amazon\nBest grooming gloves: HandsOn All-In-One Bathing and Grooming Gloves - See at Chewy\nBest silicone: Furbliss Pet Brush - See at Chewy\nBest overall\nThis dual-sided brush has pins for removing loose fur and small tangles and nylon bristles for smoothing and softening the coat \u2014 it's like a massage for your cat and costs less than $10.\n- Easily removes loose fur\n- Reaches undercoat fur while protecting skin from pokes and prodding\n- Soft nylon bristles delicate enough for face and softens top coat\n- Easy to grip\n- Unexpensive\n- Cats may chew rubber handle and plastic tips\n- Stainless steel tines may bend if brush dropped\nPersuading your cat to sit through a grooming session can be challenging, but the double-sided Hartz Groomer's Best Combo Brush makes the process easier and, dare we say, even enjoyable for cats of all fur lengths and humans alike.\nBoth gentle and effective, this combo brush is our top pick for the best cat brushes and our go-to for daily use. It features stainless steel pins on one side to remove loose fur and small tangles, while the other side has nylon bristles for smoothing and softening the coat. The metal pins gently dislodged loose hair from our long-haired cat's coat, and both the pins and bristles proved ideal for our short-haired cat. Our tester cats especially enjoyed the bristles around their delicate faces. Although the pins successfully work through small tangles, you'll need a different brush for more substantial knots and mats.\nThis brush has the safety features that Daniel Lioyryan, a cat groomer at Cats in the City, looks for in pin brushes. The rubber tips on the stainless steel pins provide a massaging effect and protect cats from getting poked, and the soft pad that holds the pins in place is flexible enough to prevent the tines from jabbing a cat. We also found it easy to grip the rubber handle while grooming.\nBest deshedding tool\nThe hooked teeth on the Andis Pet Deshedding Tool deftly remove hair from a cat's undercoat without irritating the skin.\n- Easily removes undercoat fur while protecting skin from irritation\n- Lightweight and easy to grip\n- Small enough to reach tight spots\n- Removes more hair than other brushes\n- Leaves behind a layer of loose hair\n- Pricey\nLioyryan recommends using a deshedding tool on cats monthly to every other month to remove excess and compacted fur and thin out dense coats. The Andis Pet Deshedding Tool is the most effective tool we tested for both short- and long-haired cats. In just a few strokes, it removes as much, or more, fur than other tools do in an entire brushing session.\nThe power of the Andis deshedder lies in its curved metal teeth, which reach beneath the topcoat to pull hair from the undercoat. The teeth gently catch hold and remove hair without causing discomfort or irritating a cat's skin. One of our cats absolutely adored being brushed with this tool, and the hooked teeth prevented us from accidentally nicking or over-raking their skin. The tool itself is lightweight, and its handle is easy to grip. The width of the head, about 4.5 inches, is an ideal size to get the job done quickly while still fitting into hard-to-reach nooks and crannies.\nThe tool's only drawback is that it leaves a thin layer of loose fur on the topcoat. Lioyryan recommends using a comb or slicker brush after deshedding to remove excess loose fur.\nBest slicker\nThe Safari Self-Cleaning Slicker Brush helps detangle matted undercoat fur and can be cleaned out with the push of a button.\n- Self-cleaning design for easy hair removal\n- Ergonomically designed handle with rubber grips\n- Good for removing loose fur and small mats\n- May not reach entire undercoat of long-haired cats\n\"Slicker brushes are often a cat's favorite,\" Lioyryan says. He adds that they are particularly useful for removing loose fur from the coat's outer layer and gripping the short strands of a short-haired cat's undercoat. For long-haired cats, a slicker brush is ideal for light daily brushing and catching pin knots, small mats, and loose clumps of fur. The Safari Self-Cleaning Slicker Brush accomplishes all this but stands out for its brush head size and retractable pins.\nSafari's lightweight slicker brush has an ergonomic handle with rubber grips. Its 3-by-2-inch paddle with 288 stainless steel pins is agile enough to get into hard-to-reach places. When the pins are full of hair, simply press a button on the back to push the front plate forward and dislodge the hair.\nWhile the brush couldn't remove every mat on a long-haired cat, it did a great job helping us combat those on the chest and under the arms. You'll need to remove tougher tangles with a comb or dematting tool. If your cat's coat is severely matted, it's important to take your cat to a veterinarian or groomer who can safely remove them. \"Never try to cut mats out of your cat's hair with scissors,\" Simpson says. \"This can lead to accidental laceration of the skin.\"\nRead our full Safari Self-Cleaning Slicker Brush for Cats review.\nBest comb\nThe comb has teeth of two lengths to remove tangles and mats on long-haired cats.\n- Dual-length stainless steel teeth\n- Solid brass spine\n- Lightweight\n- Comfortable to use at different angles\n- Only useful for untangling matted fur\n- Pricey\nLong-haired cats are prone to developing tangled mats in their undercoat, causing discomfort and, in some cases, leading to illness. \"Matting causes the hair to pull at the skin, which is painful,\" Simpson says. At the hind end, urine and feces may also stick to mats, increasing the risk of skin and urinary tract infections.\nThe best comb to smooth out matted fur is Chris Christensen's Cat/Carding Buttercomb #013, says Loel Miller, owner of Mobile Grooming by Loel. We found she was right. It excelled at digging into mats and untangling the fur caught within them.\nThe lightweight comb has stainless steel teeth embedded in a solid 6-inch spine. The teeth alternate in a pattern of long and short tines. The comb has no real handle, just about a quarter-inch-wide ridge that runs its length. It turns out that the lack of a handle makes this comb more versatile and easier to use \u2014 it can be held comfortably at any angle to work out tangles.\nBest dematting tool\nThis two-in-one tool has different types of teeth built into each side of the head so you can easily dislodge mats and remove loose fur.\n- Two-in-one tool\n- Grips and removes stubborn mats\n- Removes excess fur to prevent future matting\n- Small head to reach nooks and crannies\n- Durable, metal tines\n- Pricey\nWhile you can use a comb to remove mats from your long-haired cat, you may find a rake is easier to maneuver. Lioyryan says the best dematting rakes have sharp, curved tines that dislodge mats with minimal pulling. Our top pick, the Well & Good Prostyle Dual-Sided Shedding Rake, stands out for its superior ability to grip and remove pesky mats.\nThis versatile two-sided tool has an ergonomic handle with rubber grips and a 3-inch wide head. On one side of the head is a seven-toothed dematting tool, and on the other, there is a deshedder with 13 teeth. In one fell swoop, you can turn the tool over in your hand to go from dematting to deshedding, removing excess fur and preventing new mats from forming.\nAlthough our long-haired cat didn't have any stubborn mats during testing, the tool performed well in our simulated dematting tests. We also found it incredibly easy to use the dematting side along our cat's tummy to eliminate tangles, then quickly flip to the deshedding side to thin her fur. While this rake may not remove as much hair as the Andis Deshedding Tool, it effectively clears away loose fur on long- and short-haired cats.\nThe only downsides are the rake's price and the lack of metal hardware connecting the teeth to the tool. Lioyryans says all-metal hardware will prove the most durable. For a more budget-friendly two-in-one tool, the Maxpower Plant Pet Grooming Brush is a good option, though it's slightly heavier and has a larger head that may prove challenging when removing mats from tight underarm spots.\nBest grooming gloves\nThese grooming gloves are an ideal way to remove hair, dirt, and dander from cats that are sensitive to grooming and handling.\n- Good for cats who are sensitive to grooming\n- Flexible and comfortable\n- Available in five sizes\n- Can be used wet or dry\n- Good for massage or bathing\n- Removes relatively little hair, dirt, and dander compared to other brushes and combs\nCats who refuse to be groomed with one of the best cat brushes or a comb may tolerate grooming gloves, which fit closely to the natural shape of your palm. \"Using a grooming glove or a soft rubber grooming brush can acclimate your cat to the feeling of being brushed in a gentle way,\" Simpson says.\nRelative to all of the other brushes and combs we tested, gloves are the worst at removing hair from a cat's coat. However, if your cat is sensitive to brushing, gloves will help remove some fur, dirt, and dander. The well-constructed HandsOn Grooming Gloves were the best of the brands we tested. The rubber palms are covered with rounded nubs, three clumps on each finger and two on the thumb. The other side of the glove is made of strong nylon fabric with a velcro closure at the wrist that secures it snugly.\nThe gloves come in five sizes, junior to extra large. As an average-sized woman, the medium pair fit me comfortably. Unlike the other gloves we tested, these didn't feel overly bulky. The gloves can be used dry or wet, and so far, they have not cracked, torn, or grown mildew, which the company claims is a feature of their durability.\nBest silicone\nThe versatile Furbliss Pet Brush is the only grooming tool most short-haired cats will ever need, and it even removes fur from upholstery and clothing. Save an extra 20% at checkout and free yourself from clinging fur.\n- Medical-grade silicone\n- Multipurpose design\n- Dishwasher and washing machine safe\n- 100% satisfaction guarantee within 3 months of purchase\n- Hair difficult to remove from brush when dry\nThe Furbliss is one of the best cat brushes not just because its flexible silicone nubs are gentle and effective at removing loose hair but also because you can use it to massage your pet, remove hair from clothing and upholstery, and dispense shampoo in the bath.\nPet groomer Melissa Tillman says good curry brush is ideal for grooming a short-haired cat. We found this curry-style brush can help remove loose hair, dirt, and dander from long-haired cats, but it really shines on cats with shorter hair. The two-sided silicone brush has flexible nodules that smooth out the topcoat and stimulate circulation. The lightweight brush was easy to grip and use. Fur sticks to the silicone material, making it a challenge to clean, but you can rinse it under the faucet or run it through the dishwasher or washing machine. On the back, there are reservoir cells to hold shampoo for deep cleaning while bathing. You can also rub the backside over clothing and upholstery to remove hair and lint.\nThe Furbliss comes in two different designs. The blue brush has dense, cone-shaped teeth designed for short-haired pets, and the green brush has larger, more widely spaced nubs for long-haired pets. However, we tried both brushes and didn't notice a significant difference.\nWhat to look for in a cat brush\nWe spoke to three professional groomers and two veterinarians to narrow down the best cat brushes for every coat type and budget. They recommend keeping the following features in mind when shopping for cat grooming tools:\nShape and length: The shape of the brush directly impacts how well the brush removes fur and mats, especially from hard-to-reach places. Dematting and shedding brushes with small heads, like Andis Pet Deshedding Tool and Well & Good Prostyle Dual-Sided Shedding Rake, are great for reaching problematic areas such as under the limbs. The moderate length of Chris Christensen Buttercomb's teeth angles along the body, effectively tackling tough knots and mats.\nFunction: Not all brushes serve the same purpose, and you'll need more than one in your arsenal to address all of your cat's grooming needs.\n- Pin brushes: These brushes are gentle enough for daily use. The metal tines effectively tackle minor tangles, while the rubber tips provide a gentle, massaging sensation without poking your cat.\n- Bristle brushes: The nylon bristles remove loose hair from the topcoat and ensure the rest of the coat is smooth and lying in the same direction, which will help prevent future mats and tangles. A combo pin and bristle brush is particularly suitable for multi-cat households with both short- and long-haired cats.\n- Slicker brushes: These are effective for light daily brushing, removing loose fur, and managing small tangles. The metal tines are numerous and slightly bent at the ends, making them especially useful for grabbing loose hairs from the undercoat of short-haired cats.\n- Skip tooth combs: This type of comb has a single row of steel tines with alternating lengths, designed to penetrate the undercoat of long-haired cats. If a comb has teeth that are all the same length and closely spaced, you might push the undercoat down instead of effectively brushing through it, Lioyran says. Combs are the ideal weekly or as-needed tool for small mats and grooming following a deshedding.\n- Deshedding tools or rakes: These tools have curved times to grip and remove excess fur. The number of tines varies, and Lioyryan says you might need to experiment with several deshedding rakes before finding the one that best suits your cat. He recommends using deshedding rakes monthly or every other month to eliminate loose fur and thin out thick coats. Lioyryan says even short-haired cats require deshedding, given their higher hair follicle count than long-haired cats.\n- Dematting rakes: If a stubborn mat pops up, a dematting rake is the best tool. Our experts strongly advise against using scissors on your cat's fur. Lioyryan recommends dematting tools with curved tines rather than straight ones because they tend to have a better grip.\n- Grooming gloves: These are gentle enough to acclimate cats to grooming and are less likely to overstimulate cats who are sensitive to touch.\n- Curry brushes: These versatile brushes with rubber nubs effectively remove loose hair, massage your pet, remove hair from clothing and upholstery, and lather shampoo during baths.\nComfort: The tines of a brush shouldn't poke and prod at your cat, and a tool should never excessively tug at the fur. To ensure your cat's comfort, opt for a pin brush with rubber-tipped tines and slickers with a soft brush pad that allows the tines to move with the curvature of your cat's bones. The best cat brushes also have ergonomic and rubber handles for the groomer's comfort.\nSome cats may still dislike their grooming tools even if they check all the right boxes for comfort. \"Just like people, some cats love being brushed, and they tolerate tension on their fur very well. Other cats do not,\" Lioyryan says. \"If a cat doesn't like a particular tool, it doesn't necessarily mean that the tool is wrong.\" He suggests holding the skin taut to reduce pulling when using a deshedding rake and being mindful when brushing over bones.\nIntroducing your cat to grooming tools early increases the likelihood that they will tolerate and even enjoy the grooming process. For cats sensitive to grooming, grooming gloves such as HandsOn All-In-One Gloves may be the best option.\nHow we tested the best cat brushes\nTo identify the most effective cat brushes and combs for this guide, we conducted the following tests with 31 brushes and combs.\nHair removal test: To objectively compare the brushes in the deshedding tool and slicker brush categories, we used a different grooming tool for one to three days to give our tester cats \u2014 two short-haired cats and two long-haired cats \u2014 a complete brushing. The removed hair was placed in labeled plastic bags that were laid side by side to reveal which tool removed the most.\nEase of use test: While using each grooming tool, we evaluated the following characteristics:\n- How easy the tool was to use overall\n- The weight of the tool\n- The size of the tool and how well it fit in our hands\n- How well the tool accessed hard-to-reach places\n- How easy the tool was to clean after use\n- The durability of the tool\nDematting test: This test was devised for the products in the dematting comb category. For each comb, we began by rolling, mashing, and entangling a large pile of undercoat fur removed from a long-haired cat using a deshedding tool. We then attempted to restore the fur to its smooth, unmatted state with the comb. The top three tools went on to tackle the small mats on one of our tester cat's chest and under his forelegs, where he has trouble reaching during grooming. The comb that dematted the hair most easily and efficiently was declared the winner.\nCat brush FAQs\nWhat is the best type of brush to use on a cat?\nWhile we have several picks for the best cat brushes, the ideal brush for your cat depends on their hair type and grooming requirements. A combo pin and bristle brush is the best choice for everyday grooming for both short- and long-haired cats. The pins remove loose hair and small tangles while the bristles smooth the top coat. However, no single brush can fulfill every grooming need. Long-haired cats require grooming with a deshedding rake monthly or every other month, followed by a skip tooth comb or pin brush to remove loose fur and handle small tangles. For bigger knots and mats, you'll also need a dematting tool. If you have a short-haired cat, you can skip the comb but should use a slicker or pin brush to tackle small tangles and remove loose hair from the undercoat. You may also need a deshedding rake and a dematting tool. Some cats may prefer the gentle touch of a soft rubber curry comb rather than a pin or slicker brush. A grooming glove is another good option for short-haired cats, particularly if they are handling sensitive.\nAre cat brushes good for cats?\nYes. Brushing a cat removes dead hair and skin cells that would otherwise end up being swallowed while grooming or shedding onto your floor. The less hair a cat consumes, the less likely they are to have regular hairballs. Brushing also distributes the natural oils in the coat to keep it shiny, stimulates blood circulation, and helps a cat and their caregiver bond.\nHow often should you brush your cat's fur?\nOpinions differ even among professionals regarding how often a cat should be brushed. According to the ASPCA, brushing once or twice a week can help keep a cat's coat healthy. VCA Hospitals recommends brushing your cat daily, especially if they have long hair or a thick coat. Tillman's rule of thumb is to brush your cat as often as they will let you, while Harper says he has no rule of thumb but recommends at least running your hands, if not a brush or comb, over your cat's body once daily. Older cats who cannot self-groom may need more regular sessions than younger cats.\nHow often should I use a deshedding tool on my long-haired or thick-coated cat?\nLioyryan recommends using a deshedding tool on long and short-haired cats monthly to every other month, followed by brushing with a skip tooth comb, slicker brush, or pin brush.\nHow long should I brush my cat?\nInstead of sticking to a set period of time, pay close attention to your cat's body language. If they become agitated or attempt to move away from the brush or comb, call an end to the session and pick it up again later.\nHow do you brush an unwilling cat?\nThe earlier you begin to introduce your cat to brushing, the better. \"Kittens that are regularly groomed and have their nails trimmed become used to being handled,\" Simpson says. To set your cat up for brushing success, Simpson recommends positioning them in a comfortable, quiet area and pairing gentle brush strokes or combing with delicious treats. Lickable foods such as Inaba Churu are especially high-value for many cats. To keep your hands free for brushing, you can spread food on a Lickimat or scatter treats in front of your cat. Simpson says cats are less likely to be anxious if you work alone without restraining them.\nShould cats go to groomers?\nAnytime a cat is heavily matted, it's best to consult a professional. \"Cats' skin is easy to cut, so it's best to leave that up to us,\" Tillman says. If you have a cat who dislikes being brushed, don't hesitate to hire a groomer to do the basics. \"It's best not to push the limits of a cat where you are in danger of being injured,\" Miller says. Cats who are easily stressed during trips to the groomer may benefit from a mobile grooming service that will come to your home.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "Finding the best cat food to keep your finicky feline happy is no easy feat. There are a handful of key factors to consider, from your cat's age to whether you prefer the convenience of dry food over the beneficial moisture in wet food. If your cat has specific health concerns, there are also foods formulated to address everything from hairballs to weight management.\nWe've spent the last four years researching hundreds of cat foods and interviewing more than a dozen veterinarians and animal nutritionists to learn how to identify high-quality, nutritious cat foods. While there's no one-size-fits-all food, our selections are nutritious recipes from top brands. One of the overall best adult wet cat foods is Wellness Gravies Salmon Entree. In addition to salmon and turkey, it contains fish oil, a source of beneficial omega fatty acids.\nBeyond our recommendations here, you can find more nutritionally complete and balanced foods in the buying guides linked throughout the article. All of our picks meet the veterinarian-recommended standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) and the Global Nutrition Guidelines published by the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA). If you'd like to learn more about these standards, scroll down to the section on \"what to look for in a cat food.\" However, always make sure to talk to your vet before making any changes to your cat's diet.\nYou can read more about how Business Insider Reviews tests and recommends pet products.\nOur top picks for the best cat foods\nBest wet overall: Wellness Gravies Salmon Entree - See at Chewy\nBest dry overall: Farmina N&D Ancestral Grain Lamb and Blueberry Recipe - See at Chewy\nBest budget wet: Natural Balance Original Ultra Chicken and Liver Recipe - See at Amazon\nBest budget dry: Nutro Wholesome Essentials Adult Salmon and Brown Rice Recipe - See at Chewy\nBest for indoor cats: Royal Canin Indoor Morsels in Gravy - See at Chewy\nBest for kittens: Purina Pro Plan Kitten Salmon and Ocean Fish Entree - See at Chewy\nBest for seniors: Wellness Complete Health 7+ Age Advantage Tuna and Salmon Entree - See at Chewy\nBest fresh: Just Food For Cats Fish and Chicken Recipe - See at Chewy\nBest for sensitive stomachs: Royal Canin Digestive Care Thin Slices in Gravy - See at Chewy\nBest for weight loss: Hill's Science Diet Perfect Weight Adult Liver and Chicken Entree - See at Chewy\nBest for hairball control: Hill's Science Diet Urinary Hairball Control Adult Savory Chicken Entree - See at Chewy\nBest wet overall\nThis wet cat food is high in protein but not calories, helping your cat feel full and satisfied while supporting their lean muscle mass.\nCat food should include animal protein as a top ingredient because cats are obligate carnivores who cannot produce essential amino acids on their own. These amino acids, such as taurine, are required for healthy growth and physical well-being. They must be sourced from a meat-based diet, says Dr. Jonathan Stockman, a veterinary nutritionist and associate professor of clinical veterinary sciences at Long Island University College of Veterinary Medicine. Wellness Gravies Salmon Entree delivers with a whopping 51% protein from salmon and turkey in a savory broth.\nWellness Gravies Salmon Entree is low in calories and can help manage your cat's weight when served in appropriate proportions. Thanks to its high moisture content, it's also more filling than dry food. The food contains healthy extras, such as antioxidants from cranberries, which may help lower a cat's risk of degenerative diseases of the liver, kidneys, and brain. It also includes inulin from chicory root, a fiber source that promotes regularity and may help cats feel fuller for longer.\nWhile high-protein foods such as this one can benefit many cats, consult your veterinarian before offering a high-protein diet if your cat is senior or has underlying health issues. Foods high in protein can be harmful to cats with kidney disease, says Dr. Carly Fox, a senior veterinarian at the Schwarzman Animal Medical Center.\nFor more excellent options, check out our guide to the best and healthiest wet cat foods.\nBest dry overall\nThis crunchy cat food has 36% protein in a lower-calorie nutritious formula that supports digestive health.\nIf you're looking for a convenient and practical way to nourish your cat, dry food is an excellent option. It's generally more affordable than wet food and lasts longer once opened. Plus, many cats enjoy its crunchy texture and flavorful coating. One of our favorites, Farmina N&D Prime Lamb and Blueberry Recipe, provides 36% protein with healthy servings of fat and fiber.\nLike all our recommendations for the best cat foods, this recipe is formulated by a veterinary nutritionist. It includes dried beet pulp, a good source of fermentable fiber that can support digestive health by feeding beneficial gut bacteria, says Ellen Dierenfeld, a comparative animal nutritionist and founder of Zootrition. The food also includes sources of fiber from oats, inulin, and psyllium. In addition, blueberries and pomegranates provide beneficial antioxidants.\nOmega-3 fatty acids are essential nutrients that your cats must get from their diet. Small, cold-water fish like herring are excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids, and this food includes herring in both meat and oil form. Omega-3 fatty acids can help maintain a healthy coat, prevent dry skin, and reduce joint inflammation in cats.\nOur guide to best and healthiest dry cat food includes more recommendations for cats of all ages. You can also learn more about the differences between kibble and canned food in our explainer on wet versus dry cat food.\nBest budget wet\nThis smooth pate provides complete nutrition for cats of all ages, eliminating the need to switch between kitten and adult foods, all at an affordable price.\nWet cat food often costs more than kibble, but high-quality, affordable options exist. Natural Balance Original Ultra Chicken and Liver Pate is one such food. It's packed with protein-rich organ meat, including liver, essential nutrients, and healthy extras, like antioxidants from cranberries.\nOrgan meats are often listed as byproduct meals and meat on ingredient lists. They're nutrient-rich parts of a cat's natural diet. Liver, for instance, provides many good vitamins and minerals that can be very beneficial, Stockman says. These ingredients help keep cat food affordable without sacrificing quality or a cat's health.\nThis food is formulated for all life stages, meaning it's suitable for cats of all ages, from kittens to seniors. It's a convenient option for households with cats of various ages or people who prefer not to transition their kitten to adult food later on. However, Stockman says all life stages formulas are higher in nutrients and calories compared to adult maintenance foods. This difference could lead to weight gain in some adult cats. For cats with weight management issues, a food tailored to their age might be better.\nBest budget dry\nNutro Wholesome Essentials Adult Salmon and Brown Rice keeps your adult cat on the prowl with 33% protein from salmon, a good source of omega fatty acids.\nEven if you have more money to spend, don't write off the best budget-friendly cat foods. Nutro Wholesome Essentials Adult Salmon and Brown Rice is an affordable AAFCO complete and balanced dry food that is just as nutritious as pricier kibble.\nThis budget-friendly dry food contains whole meats and protein-rich meat meals, as well as ingredients like whole brown rice and whole grain oatmeal. Whole grains are preferred over processed flours and meals, says Dr. Korinn Saker, a veterinary nutritionist and retired associate professor of clinical nutrition at the College of Veterinary Medicine at North Carolina State University. Whole, complex carbohydrates keep cats feeling full because they take more energy to digest. They're also a good source of fiber, which can help with digestion and reduce hairballs.\nThe salmon in this recipe is a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which may improve a cat's skin and fur health and reduce shedding. It also contains the fermentable fiber beet pulp to promote digestive health.\nBest for indoor cats\nThis high-moisture wet food is low in calories and includes a special source of fiber to keep your cat feeling full for longer \u2014 perfect for sleepy days indoors.\nEven with the best cat trees, exercise wheels, and toys, indoor cats are often less active than their outdoor counterparts, which can increase their risk of weight gain. In addition to portion control, feeding low-calorie food can help keep your cat satisfied and at a healthy weight.\nWe recommend Royal Canin Indoor Adult Cats Morsels in Gravy. This low-calorie wet cat food contains added fiber from powdered cellulose to help your cat feel fuller for longer. It also contains L-carnitine, an amino acid that may help the body burn fat for energy to support a healthy weight.\nIf you're unsure how much your cat should eat, ask your veterinarian about the Body Condition Score (BCS), a nine-point scale used to assess your cat's body fat and help determine their ideal weight and calorie requirements.\nYou can find more dry and wet food picks in our guide to the best indoor cat foods.\nBest for kittens\nThis wet kitten food's ingredient list starts with salmon and ocean fish, which provide protein-rich ingredients and essential fatty acids to support growth.\nKitten food is specially formulated for cats under a year old, with a minimum of 30% protein, 9% fat, and extra vitamin A, calcium, and phosphorus. These foods also contain docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid. DHA supports brain development and can be found in fish, fish oil, and fish meal, such as the salmon and ocean fish in Purina Pro Plan's Kitten Salmon and Ocean Fish Entree.\nWhether a kitten is fed dry food, wet food, or a combination, each can provide adequate nutrition if formulated for growth at all life stages. This smooth pate, however, offers a gentle transition from mother's milk. While its high moisture content promotes proper hydration, cats of all ages should always have access to fresh water.\nIn addition to being formulated under the guidance of a veterinary nutritionist, this food stands out for its proven nutritional adequacy through feeding trials. This means it was fed to a group of kittens to ensure its nutritional value and safety.\nIn our guide to the best kitten foods, we highlight both wet and dry foods with various proteins and textures.\nBest for seniors\nThis senior cat food offers joint support and weight management, helping you and your cat make the most of their golden years.\nOnce a cat reaches 7 years of age, they start to show signs of aging. Around 12 years old, they enter their senior years. Although older cats have the same minimum AAFCO nutritional requirements as younger adult cats, they may experience age-related conditions such as arthritis, weight gain, or muscle loss. A senior diet can help manage these specific issues.\nWellness Complete Health Age Advantage Plus Tuna and Salmon Entree is one of the best cat foods for seniors. The wet food includes omega-3 fatty acids, glucosamine, and chondroitin sulfate, found in tuna and salmon. These joint-supporting ingredients may help reduce inflammation and stiffness.\nWeight management can be a challenge with senior cats due to decreased exercise and a slowing metabolism, but it should remain a priority. This high-moisture food includes L-carnitine and beet pulp to help maintain a healthy weight. Along with portion control, age-appropriate play can prevent weight gain.\nCheck out our guide to the best senior cat foods for more nutritionally complete and balanced recommendations.\nBest fresh\nJustFood For Cats delivers complete and balanced nutrition with whole meats and fish.\nFresh cat food is a relatively new trend in which whole meats, vegetables, essential vitamins, and minerals are combined and then frozen to maintain freshness. Some fresh pet foods are available via fuss-free subscription, and others are available in the freezer section of pet stores.\nWhile several fresh cat food companies meet the AAFCO standards, Just Food For Cats stands out because they have a veterinary nutritionist on staff. According to our experts, this is an essential quality to look for when choosing any cat food. Additionally, the company has a research advisory board of 14 veterinarians who provide nutrition research and feeding guidance.\nJust Food for Cats offers one recipe for cats: Chicken and Fish. While the selection is limited, we like that the most nutritious parts of the chicken are used, including the thighs, hearts, and livers. Pacific cod and sardines add to the palatability and are also a good source of omega fatty acids for skin and joint health.\nBest for sensitive stomachs\nCats with sensitive stomachs may get relief from this tasty wet food with easy-to-digest ingredients.\nLike humans, some cats have more sensitive stomachs than others, leading to unpleasant gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea, or gas. If your cat experiences these issues, Royal Canin Digestive Care Thin Slices in Gravy may provide relief. However, you should consult your vet before switching to one of the best cat foods for stomach sensitivity.\nRoyal Canin Digestive Care Thin Slices in Gravy contains minimal fat (1.6%) and low fiber (2.5%), making it gentle on sensitive stomachs. The limited fiber in this recipe comes from powdered cellulose, an insoluble fiber that may help relieve constipation by increasing stool volume and bowel movement frequency. Instead of whole meats, the recipe includes processed proteins like pork byproducts, chicken liver, and pork plasma. Foods with more processed proteins may help your cat absorb the nutrients more efficiently, Saker says.\nThis food is formulated for adult cats only. Kittens have specific nutritional needs for growth. If your kitten has gastrointestinal issues, consult your vet before considering our picks. Then, you should only consider foods formulated for growth or all life stages, such as Royal Canin Kitten Loaf in Sauce.\nOur guide to the best sensitive stomach cat food highlights more formulas for various budgets.\nBest for weight loss\nA serving of this wet food keeps cats satisfied thanks to fiber-rich ingredients such as powdered cellulose and carrots.\nThe more overweight a cat becomes, the more likely they are to develop conditions such as diabetes, liver disease, arthritis, and pancreatitis. You can help your cat lose weight and maintain a healthy body weight by closely controlling their portion sizes and switching them to a weight management diet, such as Hill's Science Diet Perfect Weight Adult Liver and Chicken Entree.\nFiber-rich weight management foods like this one can help your cat feel fuller longer. This means less meowing between meals and less temptation to sneak your cat a treat or overfeed them. This diet's fiber sources include powdered cellulose, an insoluble fiber, and carrots, a soluble fiber source. This adult cat food also contains the amino acid L-carnitine to help the body burn fat for energy.\nWhile both wet and dry weight management diets can be effective, wet food's moisture content aids in satiety, reducing begging and overeating. Plus, it's generally easier to overfeed your cat with dry food than wet since dry is more calorie-dense.\nYou can find more dry and wet food options in our guide to the best weight loss foods for cats.\nBest for hairball control\nThis cat food for hairball control contains insoluble fiber and omega fatty acids to help reduce hairballs and promote healthy skin and coat.\nWhen cats groom, they often swallow loose hairs. These hairs may pass through their digestive tract without issue or clump into hairballs. Coughing up a hairball once every week or two is normal for most cats. But some hairballs may grow too large and get trapped in the stomach, where they can cause a dangerous blockage. Hill's Science Diet Urinary Hairball Control Savory Chicken Entree may help cats who struggle with hairballs.\nAlthough this food won't stop your cat from licking themselves or swallowing hair, insoluble fiber sources such as powdered cellulose and dried beet pulp might help prevent loose hairs from getting stuck in the digestive tract. Insoluble fibers don't dissolve during digestion, so they work by pulling along hairs on their way out.\nIn addition, this recipe contains fish oil, a good source of omega fatty acids. Omega fatty acids may improve skin and coat health and reduce shedding.\nOur guide to the best hairball control cat food highlights nine more excellent formulas.\nWhat to look for in a cat food\nWhen shopping for the best cat foods, there are some key criteria to keep in mind.\nAn AAFCO nutritional adequacy statement: The most basic measure of nutritionally complete and balanced cat food is an AAFCO statement on the label. The AAFCO is a nonprofit organization that defines the standard nutritional requirements for pet food and animal feed. A cat food with an AAFCO statement is guaranteed to be complete and balanced for cats at specific life stages. The AAFCO designates the stages according to the following criteria.\n- Growth and reproduction: Foods that carry this designation are for kittens under 1 year old and pregnant or nursing cats. These formulas are high in protein (30% minimum) and fat (9% minimum) to support rapid growth. They also contain more vitamin A, calcium, and phosphorus than adult maintenance foods.\n- Maintenance: Maintenance foods are formulated for adult cats. They are lower in protein (26% minimum) and fat (9% minimum) than kitten foods.\n- All-life stages: You can feed these foods to kittens and adult cats because the formulas meet the higher nutritional demands of kittens.\nWhile many senior cats benefit from specialized nutrition, the AAFCO does not recognize \"senior\" as a distinct life stage. Senior cat foods typically meet the nutritional recommendations for maintenance. For senior cats without weight management or those experiencing muscle loss, an all-life-stages formula, which meets the higher nutritional requirements of kittens, may be beneficial.\nLook for one of three AAFCO statements on the label of cat food to ensure that it is nutritionally complete and balanced.\n- \"[Product] is formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO Cat Food Nutrient Profiles.\" This statement confirms that the food's minimum nutrient profile has been verified via a third-party laboratory analysis.\n- \"Animal feeding tests using AAFCO procedures substantiate that [product] provides complete and balanced nutrition.\" Instead of submitting a food for laboratory analysis, a company may test food through controlled feeding trials. Keep in mind that these trials are imperfect; the AAFCO requires eight healthy cats to consume the food for six months. At the end of the trial, at least 75% of the participating cats must meet four blood test parameters and must not have lost more than 15% of their original body weight.\n- \"[Product] provides complete and balanced nutrition and is comparable in nutritional adequacy to a product which has been substantiated using AAFCO feeding tests.\" A cat food manufacturer whose family of products has already met the AAFCO's feeding trials criteria may carry this statement for recipes that were not directly tested.\nAlmost all commercially made cat foods exceed the minimum standards set by the AAFCO, says Dr. Valerie Parker, a veterinary nutritionist and professor of clinical small animal internal medicine and nutrition at The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine. The manufacturer must conduct a third-party laboratory analysis or feeding trials using AAFCO protocols to determine whether a product meets the minimum standards. A cat food without an AAFCO complete and balanced statement for an individual cat's life stage should never be fed as the cat's primary food.\nGuaranteed analysis: The guaranteed analysis on a pet food label shows the percentages of protein, fat, and other important nutrients in a food. If you're looking to compare wet food to kibble, you'll find the guaranteed analysis of wet food doesn't give you the complete picture of how much of these vital nutrients are present. That's because the two types of food have vastly different moisture contents (around 75% to 78% in wet food and 10% to 12% in dry food).\nThe percentages of fat, protein, and fiber in wet food must be converted to \"dry matter basis.\" To find the dry matter basis, use these directions from the Cummings Veterinary Medical Center at Tufts University, call the food manufacturer, or ask your veterinarian for help.\nCalories: A cat food's calorie content should be clearly listed on its packaging. The calorie content of cat food is listed in kilocalories (kcal). According to WSAVA, the average cat weighing between 8 and 10 pounds should consume between 230 and 270 kcal daily.\n\"The most common mistake that pet parents make, leading to overweight or obese cats, is feeding too many calories,\" says Dr. Nell Ostermeier, a veterinarian and veterinary spokesperson at Figo Pet Insurance. You can calculate your cat's daily calorie needs based on your cat's weight, or consult your vet for a personalized plan. \"Leave a little extra room for about 5% to 10% of their calorie intake to come from treats,\" Ostermeier adds. Our guide to the best cat treats is a great starting point for finding low-calorie options to please your cat.\nBrand reputation: By carefully reviewing the WSAVA Global Nutritional Guidelines, you can distinguish trustworthy brands from those that may fall short. We prioritize brands that align with these standards, considering their expert formulation, research initiatives, quality control measures, and recall history.\nSelecting pet food manufacturers that employ at least one full-time board-certified veterinary nutritionist or an animal nutrition expert with a master's or doctorate degree can help ensure the highest quality standards. \"Pet food production requires a thorough knowledge of pet nutrition, pet food ingredients, processing methods and their effect on nutrients, plus a good understanding of physiology, chemistry, mathematics, microbiology, and biochemistry,\" Okada says.\nIt's also important to consider a manufacturer's quality control measures and the types of facilities where they produce food. Parker says this information should be easily accessible on a pet food company's website. If not, you should be able to call the company and get quick answers.\nSome smaller pet food companies produce their food in facilities used by larger, more established manufacturers. This is a reliable way to ensure food quality and safety, says Dr. Yuki Okada, a veterinary nutritionist at Seven Hills Veterinary Hospital. When in doubt, select a larger manufacturer with a long history of making pet food. \"If a problem arises, it will likely be discovered sooner if the product is widely distributed,\" Okada says.\nIngredients: The ingredients on a pet food label are listed in order of weight. Proteins in the form of whole meat or meat meal should come first on the ingredients list. Beyond that, you can look for healthy extras that may benefit your cat's specific needs, such as L-carnitine for weight loss, fish oil for joint health, or high-fiber foods that will keep your cat feeling full.\nSpecial formulations: Cats with specific needs, like sensitive stomachs, age-related issues, weight management, or hairballs, might benefit from specialized diets. However, you should always check with your veterinarian before changing your cat's food.\nUnderlying health conditions like kidney disease, allergies, or cancer often require close veterinary coordination. For instance, Swanson says cats with low-functioning kidneys require lower protein diets. The less protein a cat with kidney problems has, the less likely it will be to build up waste products in the blood that make them sick.\nBeware of marketing and pet food myths: Focus on a cat food's complete and balanced nutritional profile rather than individual ingredients or marketing claims. Terms like \"flavor,\" \"premium,\" \"gourmet,\" and even \"natural\" can be misleading.\nFor example, a \"tuna-flavored\" cat food does not have to contain tuna. The flavor may come from a broth, byproduct, or meal. While \"no artificial flavors\" suggests a more natural cat food, these additives are rarely found in cat food. \"Premium,\" \"gourmet,\" and \"grain-free\" foods do not necessarily contain higher-quality ingredients and are not required to meet higher nutritional standards. Ultimately, the nutritional content is the most important factor.\nHow we selected the best cat foods\nOur recommendations for the best cat foods are based on over four years of research and testing. We've consulted with more than a dozen veterinary experts, including board-certified nutritionists and doctorates in animal nutrition who teach at accredited veterinary colleges. Our recommendations align with the key factors highlighted in this guide.\nCat food FAQs\nIs dry or wet food better for cats?\nWhether to feed your cat wet or dry food, or a combination of both, should be based on a cat's preferences and a guardian's budget. Parker says neither dry nor wet food offers specific health benefits. While both options provide complete nutrition for healthy cats, wet food requires refrigeration after opening and has a shorter shelf life than dry food. On the other hand, dry food tends to be more calorically dense and can easily lead to overfeeding and weight gain if not proportioned appropriately.\nWhich dry cat food is best for cats?\nDetermining the best dry food is highly individual. Factors like age, health conditions, and personal preferences should be considered when choosing a food for your cat.\nWhat wet cat food do vets recommend?\nVeterinarians recommend wet cat foods that meet the AAFCO nutritional standards for your cat's life stage. If your cat enjoys a particular food and shows signs of good health, such as good energy, a healthy coat, and no signs of illness, it's likely meeting their nutritional needs.\nHow much should I feed my cat?\nFeeding a cat just the right amount depends on many factors, including age, size, overall health, activity level, and reproductive status. Highly active cats need to eat more to sustain their energy, while sedentary cats may need to eat less to avoid weight gain. Pregnant female cats require more food to meet the demands of pregnancy, while their spayed counterparts do not need to eat as much. The WSAVA has a helpful chart for determining how many calories a cat should eat according to weight. This chart provides only general recommendations, so consult your veterinarian to discuss your cat's needs.\nHow often should I feed my cat?\nThe feeding frequency depends on factors such as age, lifestyle, and overall health. For example, kittens do best with eating small meals throughout the day, while adult cats are usually OK with eating just twice a day. Free-choice feeding, in which food is left out all day, is convenient if you are not home for most of the day. However, this feeding method puts cats at risk of overeating and gaining excess weight. Providing meals at specific times of day and in specific amounts will help control your cat's food intake and prevent overeating. Your veterinarian can help you develop an ideal feeding plan for your cat.\nDo cats need grain-free food?\nNo. Despite marketing claims, grain-free food has not been proven nutritionally superior to foods containing grains. A cat's digestive system is not designed to digest a large amount of carbohydrates, but cats do well eating foods that contain carbohydrate sources of grains, such as corn, oats, and wheat. These can be sources of essential nutrients like fiber and various vitamins and minerals. A grain-free food would be recommended for cats with grain and gluten allergies, but these allergies are exceedingly rare in cats. In recent years, the FDA has been investigating a potential link between grain-free dog foods and the development of a heart condition called non-hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy. However, this link has not been identified in cats eating grain-free foods.\nIs raw food good for cats?\nRaw meat diets have gained popularity in the pet food world. However, the risks of diets that contain raw meats outweigh any potential health benefits. Raw meat can contain disease-causing bacteria, such as E. coli, Listeria, and Salmonella, which can sicken cats and their owners if the meat is not handled correctly or prepared. Also, there is no nutritional benefit to feeding raw meat to cats. Any cat food with raw meat should be avoided.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "As consumers compare the infinite number of pet food products available, digest the promotional art and marketing language, evaluate the many ingredients and attempt to make sense of it all, is it any wonder that choosing the right pet food can seem complicated and confusing?\nAAFCO is here to provide pet owners with practical, real-world information for answering questions about pet food. It\u2019s important for us to point out that AAFCO and its members, as feed control officials, are not practicing veterinarians. AAFCO does not provide veterinary medical advice or recommendations of any type.\nIf a pet is sick, pet owners should immediately seek veterinary care and advice for sick pets before doing anything else.\nAAFCO\u2019s Role in Pet Food Regulation\nThroughout this section, there are numerous references to the AAFCO Model Pet Food Regulations or other AAFCO Models. Many states base their own feed laws, regulations and policies on the AAFCO Model Bill and Model Regulations. Pet food laws and regulations are enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and both state and federal jurisdictions help regulate pet food.\nAAFCO does not regulate, test, approve or certify pet food. It establishes model language that states and other governing bodies may adopt into law.\nUnderstanding Pet Food\nTo say that pets are important companions to humans may well underestimate the nature and value of human relationships with dogs and cats. If a pet gets sick and dies, it may feel like a family member has been lost. Uncommon, but well-publicized, events have occurred when a pet food was to blame for a pet\u2019s illness or death, or when a pet owner may have become ill handling contaminated pet food or treats.\nAside from these rare events, feeding the wrong product to an animal can have minor to devastating effects on our pets. The best defense consumers have is understanding what they are feeding animals in the first place, how to handle pet food products safely and how to use them correctly in feeding companion animals."

      "text": "While small amounts of ingested hair usually pass through a cat's digestive tract without issue, too much hair can ball up and become trapped inside the stomach. In such cases, the cat may eventually cough up the hairball. Treating and preventing hairballs in cats is essential to avoid the risk of a dangerous intestinal obstruction. Regular brushing can help reduce the amount of fur your cat swallows during grooming, but your veterinarian may also recommend using one of the best cat hairball remedies.\nHairball remedies are available in several forms, including gels, foods, treats, and supplements. Most contain lubricating ingredients, fiber, or a combination of both to help hairballs move more easily through a cat's digestive system. For this guide, we spoke to two veterinarians and evaluated products based on their ingredients, ease of use, and whether they carry the National Animal Supplement Council (NASC) quality seal. Our top pick for a hairball medicine is Tomlyn Laxatone Hairball Remedy Gel, a treatment that works quickly and is recommended by veterinarians.\nRead more about how Business Insider Reviews researches and tests pet products.\nOur top picks for the best cat hairball remedies\nBest hairball gel overall: Tomlyn Laxatone Hairball Remedy Gel for Cats - See at Chewy\nBest non-petroleum hairball gel: Nutri-Vet Hairball Paw Gel - See at Chewy\nBest hairball treats: Feline Greenies Smartbites Healthy Indoor - See at Chewy\nBest hairball supplement: Vet's Best Hairball Relief Digestive Aid - See at Chewy\nBest dry hairball control food: Iams Proactive Health Indoor Weight and Hairball Care - See at Chewy\nBest wet hairball control food: Purina Pro Plan Hairball Adult Wet Cat Food - See at Chewy\nBest hairball gel overall\nTomlyn Laxatone Hairball Remedy Gel gently lubricates your cat's digestive tract to help existing hairballs pass through and prevent them from forming in the future.\n- Contains three lubricants to help pass hairballs\n- Multiple flavors\n- Easy-to-give gel formula\n- Contains omega fatty acids for skin and coat health\n- Safe for use in kittens\n- Carries the National Animal Supplement Council (NASC) quality seal\n- Not labeled for use in nursing or pregnant cats\nLubricant-based gels are among the best cat hairball remedies because they are the most effective at treating and preventing hairballs. Hairball gels use ingredients like white petroleum, mineral oil, or other oils to gently help hair pass through your cat's digestive tract so it can be eliminated through their stool.\nOur top choice for hairball control gel is Tomlyn Laxatone Hairball Remedy Gel. It carries the National Animal Supplement Council (NASC) quality seal. In addition to safely and gently eliminating hairballs, it can prevent their formation in the future.\n\"The Laxatone hairball supplement from Tomlyn, that's been a favorite of mine for a long time,\" says Dr. Keith Harper, veterinarian and owner of Hayward Veterinary Hospital in California. \"I've had the most success with the Laxatone over my career.\"\nTomlyn Laxatone gel provides quick relief with a blend of three gentle lubricants (petrolatum, light mineral oil, and soybean oil) in three different flavored gels: catnip, maple, and tuna. Omega-3, 6, and 9 fatty acids are added to help support skin and coat health. It's easy to give: Simply squeeze a small amount on your cat's nose or paw for them to lick off.\nBest non-petroleum hairball gel\nNutri-Vet Hairball Paw Gel contains natural non-petroleum ingredients to lubricate your cat's digestive tract and it supports healthy skin and coat.\n- Natural lubricants help hairballs pass through digestive tract\n- Contains omega-3 fatty acids for healthy skin and coat\n- Thick gel is easy to administer\n- Carries the National Animal Supplement Council (NASC) quality seal\n- Limited flavors and sizes\nMany hairball gels contain white petrolatum, a semi-solid gel derived from oil and the same ingredient found in Vaseline. Although petrolatum is a safe and effective hairball remedy recommended by veterinarians, some pet owners prefer to avoid petroleum products.\nOur top pick for a petroleum-free hairball gel is Nutri-Vet Hairball Paw Gel, which uses natural lubricant ingredients to prevent and eliminate hairballs. The gel consists of three natural oils (hydrogenated vegetable oil, soybean oil, and corn oil) plus fiber to provide lubrication and help eliminate and prevent hairballs in adult cats and kittens.\nThe veterinarian-formulated remedy also contains omega-3 fatty acids for a shiny coat and healthy skin \u2014 the other non-petroleum hairball gel we considered does not.\nIt's available in chicken and salmon flavors and is easy to give. Just place some of the gel on your cat's paw for them to lick off or squeeze on top of your cat's food.\nBest hairball treats\nFeline Greenies Smartbites help minimize hairball formation and aid digestion while also giving your cat a boost of healthy nutrition.\n- Developed by a veterinarian\n- Contains plant-based fibers and petroleum\n- Made with protein-rich chicken\n- Some cats may not like the flavor or crunchy texture\n- Only comes in two flavors\nHairball control treats are a good option for cats that refuse to take hairball control gels because they don't like the taste. Developed by a veterinarian for hairball prevention, Feline Greenies Smartbites are our top choice for hairball control treats because they contain two effective ingredients: petrolatum and fiber.\nSmarbites are loaded with chicken-based protein and contain a combination of plant-based fibers and a small amount of petroleum. The added oil helps lubricate the digestive tract to minimize hairball formation and help with digestion. Available in both chicken and tuna flavors, each treat has less than 2 calories. You can feed a 10-pound cat up to 18 treats per day.\nBest hairball supplement\nVet's Best Hairball Relief Digestive Aid supplements contain fiber and natural ingredients to support digestion and prevent or eliminate hairballs.\n- Plant-based ingredients support digestion and prevent hairballs\n- Carries the National Animal Supplement Council (NASC) quality seal\n- Not intended to treat existing hairballs\n- Tablet may need to be broken into pieces for consumption\n- Only comes in one flavor\n- Not for use in kittens younger than 12 weeks old\nIf you're looking for a supplement to promote healthy digestion for hairball prevention, our top pick is Vet's Best Hairball Relief Digestive Aid supplement. It contains three types of ingredients to support digestion and prevent or eliminate hairballs: fiber, probiotics, and multiple natural ingredients. We chose this over VetriScience Hairball Chicken Liver Flavored Soft Chews Hairball Control Supplement for Cats, which only contains fiber.\nThe chews, made from all-natural plant-based ingredients, including marshmallow root, slippery elm bark, and papaya extract, support your cat's digestive system and help prevent hairballs. This supplement carries the National Animal Supplement Council (NASC) quality seal. This formula is free from petroleum-based ingredients and comes in a chicken flavor. Each bottle contains 60 tablets to provide your cat a full 30 days of hairball prevention.\nThe chicken-flavored chewable supplements are easy to administer. Simply break the tab into pieces to entice your cat and give them as a treat.\nBest dry cat food for hairballs\nThis dry adult cat food helps prevent and eliminate hairballs with its added fiber from ground whole grain corn, dried plain beet pulp, and powdered cellulose. Its main protein sources are chicken, chicken byproduct meal, and turkey, and fish oil is a source of omega fatty acids. It contains 30% protein, 13.5% fat, 8.3% fiber, and 302 kcal/cup.\n- Contains extra fiber to support digestion\n- Reduces hairballs\n- Helps maintain healthy weight\n- Contains omega-3 and -6 fatty acids for healthy coat and skin\n- Offers complete and balanced nutrition\n- Not as effective at eliminating hairballs as gel remedies\nHairball control cat foods contain extra fiber to help prevent or eliminate hairballs. Although the best hairball control cat food is not as effective at eliminating hairballs as gel remedies, they are a great addition to a prevention routine and useful for cats who refuse to take gel remedies.\nIams Proactive Health Indoor Weight and Hairball Care is a high-fiber, budget-friendly food. Its fiber blend includes beet pulp to aid in digestion and reduce hairballs. Added omega fatty acids help support a healthy coat and skin, too.\nBest wet cat food for hairballs\nPurina Pro Plan Hairball Adult Wet Cat Food contains extra fiber to help prevent or eliminate hairballs and support digestive health.\n- Contains extra fiber to support digestion\n- Reduces hairballs\n- Promotes healthy weight\n- Offers complete and balanced nutrition\n- Comes in four flavors\n- Not as effective at eliminating hairballs as gel remedies\n- Doesn't contain as much fiber as dry hairball foods\nHairball control cat foods contain extra fiber to help prevent or eliminate hairballs. Dry hairball foods may be more effective since they contain more fiber than wet formulations. However, for cats that eat wet food only, Purina Pro Plan Hairball Adult Wet Cat Food is our top recommendation.\nThis wet food has the most fiber of any of the canned hairball cat food formulas we considered. It also contains about 50% more than Purina's popular adult wet food (Complete Essentials Chunky Chicken Entr\u00e9e) and comes in three flavors: chicken, turkey, salmon, and ocean whitefish and tuna.\nWhat to look for in hairball remedies for cats\nIf your cat is throwing up hairballs, make an appointment with your veterinarian. They can recommend which hairball medicine or remedy might be appropriate for your cat.\n\"We simply recommend choosing the remedy that the cat is most likely to accept and eat,\" Whittenburg says. \"Some cats refuse the treats. Some cats don't like the gel. Some cats won't eat the food, or have medical conditions requiring a different diet. All the remedies are similar, but the delivery method is different.\"\nFinding which hairball remedy works best for your cat might take some trial and error. Harper says it's possible to overdo it with hairball remedies and recommends trying one remedy at a time. \"It could turn into a situation where the cat is not vomiting up hairballs, but it's vomiting up everything else,\" he says. \"One thing at a time would be sufficient to see what works best. Otherwise, you won't know.\"\nIf the best cat hairball remedies don't seem to be helping, it's time to go back to the vet for a follow-up. \"More diagnostics need to be performed to rule out more serious gastrointestinal issues,\" Whittenburg says.\nHere are the different types of hairball remedies to consider:\nHairball gels: Hairball gels are given daily to eliminate current hairballs or a few times a week to prevent hairballs from forming. Most over-the-counter hairball remedies contain petroleum or mineral oil, which provide lubrication to help move the hair through your cat's digestive system.\n\"These products are not absorbed into the cat's gastrointestinal system and will pass right through, so there is no danger posed to the cat's health,\" Whittenburg says, emphasizing that all hairball products should be given according to the directions on the label. However, regular grooming is always the first line of defense for avoiding hairballs.\nHairball food: Specially formulated hairball diets contain extra fiber to support digestive health and help push hair through the digestive tract. Both dry and wet hairball diets are available. Hairball foods are complete and balanced and intended to be used as your cat's regular diet.\nHairball treats: Like hairball food, hairball treats usually contain fiber. Some also contain lubricating ingredients like petroleum or other oils. Treats are typically given daily \u2014 follow the recommendations on the package.\nHairball supplements: Hairball supplements are not intended to eliminate hairballs that your cat currently has, but they contain natural ingredients to support digestive health and help prevent future hairballs from forming.\nHow we selected the best cat hairball remedies\nWe researched various gels, pills, treats, and foods to bring you our top picks for the best cat hairball remedies. Products that carry the National Animal Supplement Council (NASC) quality seal are rated higher than those that do not. NASC-certified products pass a comprehensive third-party audit and maintain ongoing compliance with rigorous NASC quality requirements.\nFor additional expertise, we interviewed two veterinarians for advice about preventing and treating hairballs in cats. Although the information they shared contributed to our product selection, our veterinary experts did not specifically endorse any of the products included in this guide, unless explicitly stated.\nCat hairball FAQs\nWhy do cats get hairballs?\nCats inadvertently develop hairballs when they groom themselves. \"When a cat grooms, they swallow some of the loose hair from their coat,\" says Dr. Jamie Whittenburg, veterinarian and owner of Kingsgate Animal Hospital in Lubbock, Texas. \"Cats are especially prone to ingesting loose hair because they have spikes on their tongues called lingual papillae. The hair becomes caught in the spikes, and the cat then swallows it.\" Since cats cannot digest hair, it must pass through the digestive system and come out in the cat's stool. However, sometimes hair becomes trapped in the stomach, creating a hairball.\nIs it normal for cats to throw up hairballs?\nAll cats can develop the occasional hairball. Long-haired cats are especially prone to them. If your cat gets a hairball occasionally, it's usually not cause for alarm. But if your cat is throwing up hairballs frequently, it needs to be addressed. \"Once a month normally is not as big of a deal, once a week is a little bit too much,\" Harper says. \"When people tell me that their cat vomits every day or every week, it's a problem.\"\nCan hairballs be dangerous?\nCats often vomit up hairballs \u2014 what some people call \"coughing up\" hairballs \u2014 but if hair becomes lodged in the small intestine, it can cause a life-threatening obstruction, which could require surgery.\n\"A cat that is vomiting or retching, lethargic, or does not want to eat may have an obstruction from a hairball,\" Whittenburg says. \"Defecating does not rule out a hairball, as feces are stored in the colon and intestinal obstructions occur in the small intestine.\"\nWhat should you do if your cat is throwing up hairballs?\nIt's important to make an appointment to see your veterinarian if you suspect your cat is having an issue with hairballs. Harper says that cats that get frequent hairballs may have some kind of underlying skin condition causing them to over-groom themselves and, as a result, develop hairballs. Red rashes or areas with very short hair or no hair at all are all cause for concern and should be shared with your veterinarian, explains Harper.\nAfter checking your cat for other health concerns, your vet can discuss the best ways to address your cat's hairballs. These include increasing brushing with one of the best cat brushes to reduce how much hair your cat swallows while self-grooming and using one or more hairball remedies, such as a hairball gel, food, treat, or supplement.\nHow can you prevent hairballs?\nAccording to Whittenburg, the best way to reduce hairballs is through daily brushing. \"Removing the hair before the cat has a chance to swallow it works wonders,\" she says. Cats with recurrent severe issues can also benefit from shaving, but other measures, like hairball food and treatments, may still be necessary.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "A healthy, nutritious dry food can meet your cat's protein needs while also being more convenient and affordable than canned food. The best dry cat food is rich in animal proteins because cats are obligate carnivores, which means they mainly eat meat and must get essential amino acids, like taurine, from animal protein sources. That said, the sheer number of kibble formulas can make it tough to pick a specific brand and recipe for your pet.\nTo recommend the best and healthiest dry cat food for kittens, adult cats, and seniors, we evaluated hundreds of recipes to find foods that meet several nutritional standards that veterinarians recommend. One of the best dry foods for adult cats is Acana Bountiful Catch With Salmon and Whole Herring. It includes omega fatty acids that help reduce inflammation and support skin, coat, and brain health.\nIn addition to making our selections based on the advice of veterinarians, we made sure each recipe meets the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) standards for complete and balanced cat food and the Global Nutrition Guidelines from the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA).\nHighlights for the best dry cat food\nBest overall: Acana Bountiful Catch With Salmon and Whole Herring - See at Chewy\nBest budget: Nutro Wholesome Essentials Adult Salmon and Brown Rice - See at Chewy\nBest for indoor cats: Farmina N&D Prime Adult Chicken and Pomegranate - See at Chewy\nBest for sensitive stomachs: Purina One +Plus Sensitive Skin and Stomach - See at Chewy\nBest for senior cats: Hill's Science Diet Adult 11+ Chicken - See at Chewy\nBest for hairball control: Iams ProActive Health Indoor Weight and Hairball Care Chicken and Turkey - See at Chewy\nBest for kittens: Hill's Science Diet Kitten Chicken Recipe - See at Chewy\nBest overall\nThe best cat foods meet the AAFCO's minimum nutrient standards for growth (kittens), maintenance (adult cats), or both. This ensures the food contains enough animal protein and other nutrients for your cat's specific life stage.\nThe AAFCO standards say that foods formulated for kittens or cats of all life stages must contain at least 30% protein and 9% fat. Food for adult cats \u2014 labeled \"maintenance\" or \"for all life stages\" \u2014 must have a minimum of 26% protein and 9% fat on a dry matter basis, which is calculated after moisture is removed. The biggest difference between dry and wet cat food lies in moisture content. The best and healthiest wet cat food formulas typically contain 75% to 78% moisture, while dry food contains only 10% to 12%.\nOur picks below for the best dry cat food meet our criteria for quality food for adult cats. While they cost more than our budget picks, they're packed with ingredients like deboned chicken, salmon, and beef fat.\nThis dry cat food contains a variety of fish sources for protein, all of which contain omega-3 fatty acids to support brain and immune health. It's also packed with fiber and probiotics to support digestion and added antioxidants for disease prevention.\nChicken, chicken meal, egg product, and beef fat are the main protein sources in this adult dry food. The recipe also provides beneficial fiber from carrots. Its nutritional profile is 35% protein, 14% fat, 4% fiber, and 394 kcal/cup.\nAnimal protein sources in this dry adult cat food include deboned chicken, chicken meal, turkey meal, and dried egg. The recipe also contains fiber from brown rice, barley, oatmeal, and chicory root. It consists of 36% protein, 17% fat, 3.5% fiber, and 397 kcal/cup.\nBest budget\nThe price of a pet food doesn't necessarily indicate its nutritional value or quality, says Dr. Korinn Saker, a retired veterinary nutritionist who was associate professor of clinical nutrition at the North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine.\nTo put it simply, quality food doesn't have to cost a bundle. Any pet food with a nutritional adequacy statement on the label or packaging will meet the minimum nutritional requirements of your pet. When it comes to cats, Saker says quality means that protein is the number one ingredient, especially for growing kittens and active adults. When animal protein is the first ingredient, that protein source will meet most of a cat's essential amino acid needs.\nOur picks for the best budget-friendly cat foods have an animal-based protein as the first ingredient. Plus, they're supplemented with vitamins and minerals like omega fatty acids and antioxidants to promote better overall health for your cat.\nNutro Wholesome Essentials Adult Salmon and Brown Rice keeps your adult cat on the prowl with 33% protein from salmon, a good source of omega fatty acids.\nThe main protein sources in this food for adult cats are salmon, chicken meal, chicken fat, and fish meal. It includes omega-3 fatty acids from salmon and fish meal, fiber from brown rice, oatmeal, powdered cellulose, and dried chicory root, and antioxidants from cranberries and blueberries.

The food contains brewers rice, pumpkin, and dried plain beet pulp for fiber and cranberries as a source of antioxidants. Its nutritional profile is 34% protein, 12% fat, 8% fiber, and 375 kcal/cup.\nBest for indoor cats\nEven when indoor cats have trees, perches, and exercise wheels, they are often less active and may have a slower metabolism than their outdoor counterparts. As a result, they are more prone to weight gain over time. In fact, research indicates up to 63% of cats may be overweight or obese.\nWhen your veterinarian examines your cat, they use a scale known as the Body Condition Score (BCS) to assess your cat's body fat based on evaluations of their ribs, belly, and hips. The scale ranges from emaciated (1) to obese (9), with a score of 5 representing an ideal weight. Based on the BCS, your vet can determine your cat's ideal weight and the number of calories they need to reach or maintain that score.\nWhen choosing the healthiest dry cat food for your pet, you'll need to consider the number of calories per cup and feed them the appropriate amount for their individual needs. If you need help calculating the right amount, your vet can provide more guidance. Our low-calorie picks for the best indoor cat foods are packed with beneficial ingredients, like soluble and insoluble fibers, which help keep your cat feeling fuller for longer.\nThis dry food for indoor adult cats includes protein from chicken, chicken fat, dried whole eggs, and herring. Omega-3 fatty acids from herring oil support brain and skin health and fiber from sweet potatoes, inulin, and psyllium seed husk help with digestion. It has been feeding trial tested for nutritional adequacy and contains 44% protein, 20% fat, 1.8% fiber, and 412 kcal/cup.\nDeboned chicken, chicken meal, turkey meal, chicken fat, and dried egg product make up the main protein sources in this dry food for adult cats. The recipe also provides beneficial fiber from inulin (from chicory root) and cognitive and skin support from salmon oil.

Nutritional adequacy has been substantiated through feeding trials. It contains 27% protein, 11% fat, 5.7% fiber, and 325 kcal/cup.\nBest for sensitive stomachs\nIf your cat friend has signs of food intolerance, such as diarrhea, vomiting, or gas, the best sensitive stomach cat food can help relieve their symptoms. These special formulas usually contain highly digestible proteins, omega fatty acids to reduce inflammation, and digestive aids like prebiotics and probiotics.\nWhenever your cat has symptoms of gastrointestinal stress, it's important for your veterinarian to assess your cat. before making changes to their diet. food intolerance is different from a food allergy, for example. Cats with food allergies may have different symptoms, including itchy skin and ear infections, along with vomiting or diarrhea. Saker says the difference between a food allergy and intolerance lies in an immune system response.\nIf you think your cat may have an allergy, let your vet know. They'll often recommend starting a prescription diet.\nThis dry food for adult cats with sensitive stomachs contains protein sources from salmon, chicken, chicken fat, and chicken meal. It includes dried beet pulp, a fiber that boosts digestive health. The food has been feeding trial tested for nutritional adequacy and contains 35% protein, 21.9% fat, 1.1% fiber, and 507 kcal/cup.\nThis sensitive stomach food for adult cats counts its protein from turkey, chicken byproduct meal, beef fat, and dried egg product. It includes fiber from whole grain corn, oatmeal, dried chicory root, and carrots. The food's nutritional adequacy has been substantiated through feeding trials.

It also includes potatoes and dried chicory root for fiber and fish oil, which can help reduce gastrointestinal inflammation. It contains 30% protein, 14% fat, 6% fiber, and 403 kcal/cup.\nBest for senior cats\nAs cats start to show signs of aging around 7 years old and enter their senior years at about 12, their activity levels and metabolism begin to slow down. That's when you might want to consider switching to one of our top picks for the best foods for senior cats, which are lower in calories and fat. This change can be beneficial for your cat's health since high-fat diets can lead to weight gain and obesity-related issues in less active senior cats, Saker says.\nWhen selecting one of the best dry cat food for a senior, it's important to know that the AAFCO doesn't have specific nutritional guidelines for senior cat foods, says Dr. Jennifer Larsen, a board-certified veterinary nutritionist and clinical nutrition professor at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. Senior cat foods with an AAFCO nutritional adequacy statement will meet the minimum nutrient, vitamin, and mineral requirements for both adult and senior cats. However, the calorie, fat, protein, and fiber content in formulas for older cats varies by brand. That's why it's wise to check the calorie content of each formula and consult your vet for advice on your cat's daily calorie needs.\nDr. Deb Zoran, a board-certified small animal internist and professor of small animal clinical sciences at the Texas A&M University School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, says she likes to rotate Nutro into her cats' food lineup. Their senior food has fewer calories than most adult foods while still providing plenty of protein. As part of our senior food picks, we've included recipes that contain antioxidants, omega-3 and onega-6 fatty acids, and beta-carotene. These ingredients may help reduce inflammation, boost your cat's cognitive function, and strengthen their immune system.\nThis feeding-trial-tested food contains chicken, poultry byproduct meal, beef fat, dried egg product, and fish meal as animal protein sources. It also contains fiber from rice, cassava root flour, dried chicory root, and fish oil for skin and brain health. Its nutrition profile is 38% protein, 17% fat, 2.5% fiber, and 604 kcal/cup.\nChicken is the main protein source in this dry food for senior cats. The recipe also contains beneficial fiber from whole grain wheat, powdered cellulose, and dried beet pulp, fish oil for cognitive and skin support, and l-carnitine to support fat burning. It contains 34.7% protein, 20.9% fat, 8.5% fiber, and 398 kcal/cup.\nChicken, chicken meal, and chicken fat make up the main protein sources in this senior cat food. The recipe also provides cognitive support from fish oil, beneficial fiber from dried beet pulp, and antioxidants from vitamin E. It contains 36% protein, 17% fat, 6% fiber, and 445 kcal/cup.\nBest for hairball control\nHairballs form when cats groom themselves or each other, which are natural and healthy behaviors. Small amounts of hair can pass through their system and be eliminated as waste. However, if cats ingest too much hair, the excess may end up as a hairball on your carpet \u2014 or, worse, become stuck in their digestive tract, potentially causing an obstruction.\nWhile a change in diet and the best cat hairball remedies can help, they shouldn't replace regular brushing. High-fiber cat food, however, can assist in moving hair through the digestive system, Larsen says. \"The goal is to use fiber to help push the hair along the gastrointestinal tract so it's passed as waste instead of forming a ball in the stomach,\" she explains. Key ingredients that promote this movement include rice hulls, pea fiber, and cellulose.\nAdditionally, Larsen says there's another benefit to fiber-rich diets for cats. High-fiber formulas can help cats feel fuller for longer, which may reduce their overall calorie intake. So, if your vet recommends weight loss for your cat, a fiber-rich diet could be a good option. Our picks for the best hairball control cat food contain added fiber, and Royal Canin and Iams include extra omega fatty acids.\nThis hairball control dry food for adult cats contains chicken byproduct meal and chicken fat as its main protein sources. Fish oil provides omega fatty acids to reduce shedding and added psyllium seed husk and dried plain beet pulp help move hair through the digestive tract. It contains 32% protein, 13% fat, 8.5% fiber, and 342 kcal/cup.\nThis dry adult cat food helps prevent and eliminate hairballs with its added fiber from ground whole grain corn, dried plain beet pulp, and powdered cellulose. Its main protein sources are chicken, chicken byproduct meal, and turkey, and fish oil is a source of omega fatty acids. It contains 30% protein, 13.5% fat, 8.3% fiber, and 302 kcal/cup.\nChicken, chicken meal, and chicken fat are the main protein sources in this dry hairball control food for adult cats. It includes beneficial fiber from whole grain brown rice and psyllium husks. The nutrition profile for this recipe is 33% protein, 16% fat, 6% fiber, and 398 kcal/cup.\nBest for kittens\nIf your cat is less than a year old, feed them one of the best kitten foods or a food labeled \"for all life stages.\" All life stages foods are formulated to meet the minimum nutritional requirements for growth, including protein, calcium, phosphorus, and fat. Saker says these foods exceed the minimum requirements for an adult cat's nutritional needs.\nHowever, foods specially formulated for growing kittens may be a better choice. Not only is the smaller kibble better suited to tiny mouths, but kitten food has higher minimum percentages of essential nutrients. It also contains docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid that supports brain development in kittens. Fish, fish oil, and fish meal are excellent sources of DHA.\nYou can help your kitten become more open to different foods by rotating brands, flavors, and textures. Zoran says this approach encourages food flexibility throughout their life. However, this doesn't mean your kitten should eat a completely new food every day. Instead, rotate foods every couple of weeks. You can gradually transition to a new food by adding a little more of the new food each day. If your kitten doesn't seem to like the new food or shows signs of stomach upset, you can slow the transition or return to feeding the previous food.\nProtein from chicken, chicken byproduct meal, chicken fat, and dried egg product are included in this kitten recipe. The food contains fish oil as a source of DHA and dried plain beet pulp for beneficial fiber. Its nutritional profile is 33% protein, 21% fat, 3% fiber, and 484 kcal/cup.\nAnimal protein sources in this dry kitten food are chicken, chicken fat, and egg product. Sources of fiber include brown rice and dried plain beet pulp and fish oil is added for DHA. Its nutritional adequacy has also been substantiated through feeding trials. It contains 33% protein, 19% fat, 4% fiber, and 555 kcal/cup.\nThe main protein sources in this kitten food are chicken, chicken byproduct meal, and beef fat. It has undergone feeding trials to ensure nutritional adequacy. The food\u2019s nutrition breakdown is 40% protein, 15% fat, 2.5% fiber, and 406 kcal/cup.\nWhat to look for in a dry cat food\nTo select the healthiest dry food for your kitten, adult, or senior cat, consider the following guidelines and tips.\nAAFCO nutritional adequacy statement: The most basic measure of nutritionally complete cat food is an AAFCO statement on the label. The AAFCO is a nonprofit organization that defines the standard nutritional requirements for pet food and animal feed. Food with an AAFCO statement for growth or all life stages is guaranteed to be complete and balanced for kittens, while food with an AAFCO statement for maintenance or all life stages is guaranteed to be complete and balanced for adult cats.\nGuaranteed analysis and nutrient profiles: The guaranteed analysis consists of the percentages of protein, fat, and other important nutrients in a food. Food for kittens should have a minimum of 30% protein and 9% fat, and food for adult cats should have a minimum of 26% protein and 9% fat. Food for cats of any age should also contain other essential nutrients, including amino acids like taurine, fatty acids, minerals, and vitamins.\nTo compare the nutrients in wet food to those in dry food, convert the percentages of fat, protein, and fiber in wet food to a \"dry matter basis.\" You can use these directions from the Tufts University Cummings Veterinary Medical Center, call the food manufacturer, or ask your vet for help.\nKey ingredients: Pet food labels list ingredients in order of weight. Because cats are obligate carnivores, proteins in the form of whole meat or meat meal should come first on the list.\nExpert formulations: For this guide, we prioritized brands with a dedicated nutrition expert on staff, which aligns with the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) guidelines and our experts' guidance. We also opted for brands active in research on small animal nutrition and brands that collaborate with universities and colleges.\nManufacturing standards: When selecting a cat food brand, consider a manufacturer's quality control measures and the types of facilities they use. For instance, manufacturers that own their plants have more control over the ingredients in the recipe and the food your cat consumes. Just keep in mind that it's not enough for a brand to say they conduct quality control. Pet food companies should also provide information about their quality control practices on their website or upon request.\nCalorie content: The calorie content of cat food is listed in kilocalories (kcals). Your cat will have different calorie needs, depending on their age and activity level. Kittens grow quickly in their first year, and all that growth requires plenty of energy. Therefore, kittens should eat multiple meals per day without calorie restrictions. As your kitten approaches 9 to 12 months of age, talk to your vet about their ideal body condition, weight, and caloric needs.\nOnce cats reach their adult years, the amount of food they should eat depends on their weight, energy level, breed, and overall health. Your vet can offer more detailed and personalized guidance about how many calories your cat requires per day.\nHow we selected the best dry cat food\nTo make our recommendations for the best dry cat food, we consulted experts in animal nutrition.\nDr. Deb Zoran is a board-certified small animal internist, nutritionist, and professor of small animal clinical sciences at the School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Texas A&M University. Zoran's expertise helped us better understand cat nutrition and quality food. She also shared her personal feeding preferences, which may not represent specific endorsements shared by Texas A&M University.\nDr. Jennifer Larsen is a board-certified veterinary nutritionist, a distinguished member of the American College of Veterinary Nutrition, and a professor of clinical nutrition at the School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis. Larsen's expertise helped us better understand senior cat nutrition and the role of high-fiber diets in feline nutrition and well-being.\nDr. Korinn Saker is a retired veterinary nutritionist who was a professor of clinical nutrition at the College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University. Saker helped improve our understanding of feline food intolerance and sensitivities, as well as an indoor cat's metabolic needs.\nWe also consulted guidelines and recommendations from other organizations, including AAFCO and the WSAVA Global Nutrition Guidelines.\nDry cat food FAQs\nWhat are the benefits of dry cat food?\nDry food is a popular choice for its affordability, convenience, and ease of storage. \"There is a small amount of evidence that some, very few, and specific dry cat foods may have some oral health and dental benefits,\" says Dr. Bruce Kornreich, a board-certified veterinary cardiologist and director of the Cornell Feline Health Center at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. \"But the most important thing that cat owners can do to maintain their cat's oral health is to brush their cat's teeth,\" he says.\nWhat is the healthiest dry cat food brand?\nTo ensure you're purchasing quality food for your cat, Zoran recommends first checking the label for the AAFCO statement. That way, you'll know the recipe meets your cat's nutritional needs. Then, you might consider other brand attributes, including whether their food has ever been recalled, if they employ board-certified nutritionists, and whether they participate in research studies. If a company is reputable, you can generally trust what they print on the label, according to Zoran.\nWhat is the best dry food to give a cat?\nThere's not a perfect dry food choice that fits every cat or kitten. Instead, ask your veterinarian for food recommendations tailored to your pet. They may be able to suggest some options that meet your cat's specific nutritional and calorie needs, based on their age, body condition, and overall health.\nIs it OK to feed cats dry food only?\nZoran recommends feeding cats a combination of dry and wet food from different brands starting at a young age. This encourages food flexibility in cats and can prevent them from becoming picky eaters, which may prove particularly helpful when their preferred food is unavailable, recipes change, or they require a prescription diet.\nDo vets recommend dry or wet food for cats?\nBoth canned and dry food choices can meet the nutritional needs of cats and kittens, as long as they're labeled with the AAFCO statement for your cat's specific life stage. The ideal food for your cat generally depends on your budget, along with their overall health and food preferences. However, to prevent finicky tastes and food inflexibility, Zoran recommends rotating textures, proteins, and brands from a young age. You can learn more in our explainer about wet vs. dry cat food.\nShould I leave dry food out for my cat all day?\nZoran doesn't recommend free-feeding cats. \"It is exceptionally hard to regulate a cat's weight and proper amount of food by free-choice feeding,\" she says. Instead, portion their food into two to three small meals a day. If you're not sure how much to feed your cat, you can ask your vet for more specific guidance based on your cat's age, ideal weight, and overall health.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "The best foods for senior cats can help support your older cat's health and improve their quality of life. Cats may earn \"senior\" status around age 10, but this can vary depending on their breed and overall health. Around this time, their nutritional needs change. They often begin to gain fat and lose muscle, and many have a less robust immune system compared to younger cats, says Dr. Carly Fox, a senior veterinarian at the Schwarzman Animal Medical Center.\nTo make our recommendations for the best wet and dry foods for older cats, we spoke with veterinarians about their unique health concerns and nutritional needs. One of our top picks for canned senior food is Royal Canin Aging 12+ Loaf in Sauce. It contains fish oil, glucosamine, and chondroitin to help reduce inflammation and support joint health.\nAll of our picks for the best senior cat food meet the pet food standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) and the Global Nutrition Guidelines from the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA). However, before choosing a food for your senior cat, Fox says it's important to consult your veterinarian since not all formulas address the same health needs. For example, cats with chronic kidney disease often require a diet lower in phosphorus, sodium, and protein. On the other hand, high-protein diets can benefit senior cats with healthy kidneys who have muscle loss.\nRead more about how Business Insider Reviews tests and researches pet products.\nHighlights for the best foods for senior cats\nBest overall wet: Royal Canin Aging 12+ Loaf in Sauce - See at Chewy\nBest overall dry: Hill's Science Diet Adult 11+ Chicken Recipe - See at Chewy\nBest budget wet: Blue Buffalo Tastefuls Chicken Entree for Mature Cats Pate - See at Chewy\nBest budget dry: Iams ProActive Health Healthy Senior - See at Chewy\nBest for sensitive stomachs: Purina Pro Plan Adult 7+ Prime Plus Ocean Whitefish and Salmon Entree - See at Chewy\nBest for weight loss: Royal Canin Indoor 7+ Morsels in Gravy - See at Chewy\nBest for hairball control: Purina One +Plus Indoor Advantage Senior 7+ - See at Chewy\nBest wet overall\nDomestic cats evolved from desert-dwelling felines who stayed hydrated by eating prey made up of about 70% water, says Ellen Dierenfeld, a comparative animal nutritionist and founder of Zootrition. Wet cat foods are formulated to replicate these diets. With 75% to 78% moisture content, wet foods can help keep your cat hydrated, which is especially important for senior cats with health conditions, says Dr. Kelly Fishman, a veterinarian and founder of Strut Animal Mobility Specialists.\nSenior cats with chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and hyperthyroidism often drink more water and urinate more frequently than healthy cats. Fishman says taking steps to prevent dehydration can help your cat live a longer, happier life. One way to help keep senior cats hydrated is by offering them wet food.\nOur top picks for the best and healthiest wet cat foods for seniors contain beneficial extras like fish oil, glucosamine, and chondroitin. Fox says these nutrients can support your aging cat's joints and mobility. They can also benefit cats with osteoarthritis, a condition that affects more than 90% of cats over age 12. The soft texture of wet food is also ideal for senior cats with dental disease or who have had teeth extracted.\nTo compare the nutritional values of wet and dry foods, you'll need to convert the wet food values to a dry matter basis, which are the values with all moisture removed. For this guide, we contacted the food manufacturers to get the nutritional profiles on a dry matter basis. If you want to compare other wet and dry foods yourself, you can follow the directions provided by the Tufts University Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine, call the food manufacturer, or ask your veterinarian for help.\nThis food for cats 12 years and older counts its main protein sources as pork byproducts, pork liver, chicken, and chicken liver. It contains fish oil, glucosamine, and chondroitin to reduce inflammation and support joint health. It's feeding-trial tested for nutritional adequacy and contains 51% protein, 19% fat, 6% fiber, and 71 kcal/3-ounce can.\nThe main protein sources in this wet food for cats over 7 years old are chicken, turkey giblets, pork byproducts, and pork liver. Added fish oil may help reduce inflammation and pain from arthritis. The food\u2019s nutrition breakdown is 39% protein, 24% fat, 3% fiber, and 90 kcal/2.9-ounce can.\nBest dry overall\nBoth wet and dry senior cat foods must meet the same minimum AAFCO nutritional standards as adult maintenance or all life stages foods. As long as the food has an AAFCO nutritional adequacy statement on the label, your older cat will get the nutrients they need to support their overall health.\nThat said, while dry cat food (kibble) formulated for seniors provides similar nutritional benefits to wet food, there are key differences between the two types of food that might make one a better choice for your cat. Kibble has a longer shelf life and may promote dental health by scraping plaque off the teeth. However, dry food contains about 60% less water than wet food. Fishman says this can be a concern for senior cats at risk of feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD).\nWhatever type of food you choose, our experts recommend selecting one that contains quality protein sources. As obligate carnivores, cats need animal-based proteins like fish, chicken, and eggs. Our kibble recommendations for the best cat foods for seniors contain these along with other nutritious ingredients, such as fish oil and antioxidant-rich cranberries. Antioxidants may help reduce a cat's risk of degenerative diseases of the liver, kidneys, and brain. Several of our senior picks for the best and healthiest dry cat food also contain L-carnitine, an amino acid that can support weight loss by helping cats burn fat more efficiently.\nAnimal protein sources in this dry food for cats over 11 years old include chicken, chicken fat, and egg product. The food also contains fiber from dried beet pulp, fish oil for joint support, and L-carnitine to support fat-burning. It consists of 32.7% protein, 22.5% fat, 3.7% fiber, and 510 kcal/cup.\nThis feeding-trial-tested food contains chicken, poultry byproduct meal, beef fat, dried egg product, and fish meal as animal protein sources. It also contains fiber from rice, cassava root flour, dried chicory root, and fish oil for skin and brain health. Its nutrition profile is 38% protein, 17% fat, 2.5% fiber, and 604 kcal/cup.\nBest budget wet\nSenior cats, even those who have had multiple teeth removed, can still eat kibble, says Dr. Emily Luisana, a board-certified veterinary nutritionist and co-founder of Peak Veterinary Specialists. However, if your cat doesn't like to drink water, has sensitive teeth, or loses interest in kibble, your vet might recommend switching to wet food instead.\nOften, budget plays a role when choosing a cat's food. Wet food tends to be more expensive than dry food because of its higher moisture content. However, there are still plenty of affordable, nutritious wet food options for senior cats. Depending on your cat's specific health needs and preferences, you might also consider feeding a combination of wet and dry food.\nFor this category, we selected the best foods for senior cats made with quality ingredients and with beneficial extras, such as powdered cellulose for fiber and vitamin E. This vitamin is an antioxidant that can help combat oxidative stress and inflammation associated with aging and joint problems, says Dr. Nicole Savageau, a small animal veterinarian at The Vets.\nThis wet food formulated for senior cats over age 7 includes protein from chicken, ocean fish, liver, and pork lungs. Powdered cellulose is an added source of fiber and vitamin E as a source of antioxidants. The nutritional profile is 48.9% protein, 34.7% fat, 0.5% fiber, and 87 kcal/3-ounce can.\nThis wet senior cat food contains animal protein from chicken and chicken liver. It includes fish oil, a source of omega-3 fatty acids, and powdered cellulose for digestive support. The food's nutritional profile is 46.8% protein, 31% fat, 2.8% fiber, and 95 kcal/3-ounce can.\nBest budget dry\nWhen feeding your cat, portion control is an important consideration because even a few extra kibbles can add up to a lot of extra calories for a cat. Serving measured portions can help them maintain a healthy weight while also helping you save money on cat food. \"Be mindful in maintaining your older cat's weight, as overweight cats are more prone to diabetes, neoplasia, skin disease, and painful osteoarthritis,\" Fox says.\nThe best budget-friendly cat foods meet the AAFCO's recommended nutrient profiles for all life stages, meaning they have the same essential nutrients as pricier options. However, they may not contain as many healthy extras, like probiotics to support digestion or antioxidants to help protect against age-related conditions.\nOur budget dry food picks for senior cats include proteins like chicken and chicken byproduct meal as their first ingredients. Chicken byproduct meal is a source of glucosamine and chondroitin. Our selection from Purina also contains L-lysine, an amino acid that supports the immune system and may increase a cat's resistance to certain viruses.\nAnimal protein sources in this dry formula for senior cats include chicken, chicken byproduct meal (also a source of glucosamine and chondroitin), and dried egg product. The food also contains fiber from dried plain beet pulp, fish oil for skin and brain health, and L-carnitine to support weight loss. It consists of 34% protein, 17% fat, 3% fiber, and 399 kcal/cup.\nAnimal protein sources in this dry food for cats over 7 years old are poultry byproduct meal, animal fat, and chicken. It contains fiber from dried chicory root, inflammation-reducing antioxidants from vitamin E, and immune support from L-lysine. Its nutritional profile is 34% protein, 12% fat, 4% fiber, and 382 kcal/cup.\nBest for sensitive stomachs\nWhen it comes to senior kitties, the best sensitive stomach cat food can vary, depending on their individual needs. Luisana tailors her patients' diets to their age, underlying medical concerns, senior lab work, muscle mass condition score, and body condition score (BCS). For instance, many cats can easily digest high-protein diets, but food high in protein can be harmful for cats with kidney disease.\nGenerally speaking, certain nutrients and ingredients can make a food more easily digestible for cats. Our experts say that pets have an easier time digesting more processed proteins, like meals and byproducts. Recipes with low to moderate fat are also less likely to upset your cat's stomach. Additionally, foods formulated for sensitive stomachs often contain easily digestible carbohydrates, like whole wheat, corn, or white potatoes.\nOur recommendations contain nutritious animal proteins like chicken meal and salmon, which is a good source of omega fatty acids. Our pick from Purina includes inulin, a soluble fiber typically derived from chicory root that can aid digestion. Our low-protein pick from Hill's contains dried beet pulp. Dierenfeld says beet pulp is a good source of fermentable fiber for cats and may help improve digestive health.\nThis wet food for senior cats counts its protein from ocean whitefish, liver, meat byproducts, and salmon. It contains fiber from chicory root (inulin) and inflammation-reducing fish oil. Its nutrition breakdown is 47.4% protein, 36.5% fat, 0.7% fiber, and 107 kcal/3-ounce can.\nThis dry food for senior cats with sensitive stomachs contains protein sources from chicken, chicken meal, and egg product. It includes fiber from whole grain oats and dried beet pulp, fish oil to reduce gastrointestinal irritation, L-lysine for immune support, and L-carnitine to promote fat burning. The nutrition breakdown for this food is 33% protein, 17% fat, 2.1% fiber, and 465 kcal/cup.\nBest for weight loss\nIf your cat is overweight, your vet may suggest a tailored diet to help them live longer and improve their quality of life. The best foods for senior cats who need to lose weight are low in calories and fat, high in nutrients, and often higher in fiber than other cat foods. In addition, Fox says an exercise routine is just as important, even for senior kitties.\nOur experts recommend a diet that can reduce joint pain and encourage your senior cat to become more active again. Ingredients that may help include fish oil, glucosamine, and chondroitin. Savageau says salmon is a particularly excellent protein source for senior cats because it's high in omega-3 fatty acids.\nOur picks for the best weight loss foods for cats contain nutrients that help support healthy weight loss. For instance, they contain omega-rich menhaden fish oil, high-fiber cellulose, and fat-burning L-carnitine. Other healthy extras include probiotics for a healthy gut and antioxidants from blueberries and cranberries to help ease the effects of aging.\nAnimal protein sources in this senior wet food include pork byproducts, chicken byproducts, pork liver, chicken, pork digest, and pork plasma. The recipe also contains fish oil for skin and coat health, fiber from powdered cellulose, glucosamine and chondroitin for joint health, and fat-burning L-carnitine. It consists of 57.12% protein, 15.36% fat, 4.38% fiber, and 65 kcal/3-ounce can.\nThis senior cat food counts chicken meal, egg product, and menhaden fish meal among its protein sources. Brown rice, oat groats, and dried plain beet pulp provide fiber, and menhaden fish oil reduces inflammation. It also contains antioxidants from dried cranberries and blueberries and probiotics for digestive support. Its nutrition profile is 30% protein, 8% fat, 3.2% fiber, and 366 kcal/cup.\nBest for hairball control\nIf you've had your cat for a while, you've probably cleaned up a few hairballs. Cats groom themselves as a natural behavior, but when too much hair clumps up in their stomach, a hairball forms. The hairball then travels through the digestive tract as waste or gets coughed up onto your floor (or bed). In some cases, hairballs can become a medical issue if they get stuck in the digestive tract and cause a dangerous obstruction.\nDierenfeld recommends fermentable fibers like beet pulp in cat diets because they feed the good bacteria in the microbiome and help improve gut health. Insoluble fibers like wheat bran, cellulose, and rice hull are also ideal ingredients in hairball control foods because they help pull waste through the digestive tract.\nJust know that while plant-based fiber does play an important role in feline diets, Fox says cats should never eat a vegan or vegetarian diet. Cats require amino acids from animal-based proteins that their bodies can't make. Our picks for the best hairball control cat food vary in protein and fat, so you may want to ask your vet about your cat's specific nutritional needs.\nIn this wet food for senior cats, you'll find meat protein from chicken, chicken byproduct meal, and beef fat plus powdered cellulose and soybean hulls for beneficial fiber. It contains antioxidants from vitamin E and immune-supporting amino acid L-lysine. Its nutritional profile consists of 36% protein, 13% fat, 4.95% fiber, and 413 kcal/cup.\nThis wet food for indoor senior cats counts protein from chicken, chicken broth, and chicken liver. It also contains fiber from powdered cellulose and antioxidants from cranberries, blueberries, and vitamin E. The nutritional profile for this food is 47.7% protein, 32.8% fat, 3.4% fiber, and 170 kcal/5.5-ounce can\nThis dry senior cat food contains animal protein from chicken. You'll also find fiber from powdered cellulose and dried beet pulp, omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil, antioxidants from vitamin E and cranberries, and fat-burning L-carnitine. Its nutritional breakdown is 34.1% protein, 17% fat, 8.6% fiber, and 316 kcal/cup.\nWhat to look for in senior cat food\nWhen shopping for the senior cat food, considering the following criteria can help you make the right choice:\nAAFCO nutritional adequacy statement for adult maintenance or all life stages: The AAFCO is a nonprofit organization that recommends nutritional profiles based on an animal's life stage. They haven't established specific recommendations for senior cat diets, so these foods must meet the minimum AAFCO nutritional recommendations set for adult or all life stages foods. This means the nutritional profile of senior foods can vary from recipe to recipe. But if you choose a senior cat food formulated for adult maintenance or all life stages, the recipe will meet an adult cat's dietary requirements.\nGuaranteed analysis and nutrient profiles: The guaranteed analysis shows the percentages of protein, fat, and essential nutrients in a food. According to AAFCO standards, all life stages food must meet the minimum nutrient requirements for kittens, which is a minimum of 30% protein and 9% fat. Adult maintenance cat food must have a minimum of 26% protein and 9% fat. Cat food must also contain essential nutrients, including amino acids like taurine found in animal protein, fatty acids from cold water fish, minerals, and vitamins. Our experts say it's critical to discuss your cat's recommended nutrient profile with your vet before transitioning to a new food.\nIngredients list: The ingredients list on a pet food label appears in order of weight. Your cat can get the nutrients they need from various ingredients in many different combinations, Dierenfeld says. However, cats are obligate carnivores, so they require animal-based proteins for essential amino acids. Proteins in the form of whole meat, meat meal, or byproducts should always come first on the ingredients list.\nExpert formulations: Our picks for the best senior cat foods all meet quality control standards as recommended by WSAVA. This means the brands employ a full-time board-certified veterinary nutritionist or a PhD-level animal nutritionist. These standards help ensure your cat's food is formulated to meet nutritional recommendations using the right ingredients for cats.\nManufacturing standards: When choosing a brand of cat food, consider the quality control measures and facilities used. Brands that own their manufacturing plants have greater control over the ingredients in their recipes and, therefore, the food your cat consumes. Pet food brands should also be transparent about how they implement quality control measures. It's generally not enough to simply say they conduct quality control. Pet food companies should make this information available on their website or provide it upon request.\nCalorie content: The calorie content of cat food is listed in kilocalories (kcals). Instead of basing calorie needs solely on age, our experts recommend discussing your cat's lifestyle and eating habits with your vet. Before recommending any senior diet to pet parents, Luisana assesses a cat's ideal weight, BCS, and muscle mass condition score. The BCS assesses your cat's body fat on a scale of 1 to 9 while the muscle mass conditioning score assesses your cat's muscle loss on a scale from normal to severe. This can help you understand if they need to lose or gain weight and lean muscle. You can ask your vet to teach you how to use this visual tool so you can check your cat's BCS and muscle condition score at home.\nHow we selected the best foods for senior cats\nTo select the best senior cat foods, we followed recommendations from the AAFCO, the WSAVA Global Nutrition Guidelines, and various publications and organizations linked in this guide. We also consulted two animal nutritionists and three small animal veterinarians to select the senior cat foods for this guide.

She is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine.\nSenior cat food FAQs\nWhat is the best food to feed a senior cat?\nThere is no one best food for any cat, whatever their age. It may help to consider a few key factors when choosing among the best senior cat foods. For example, high-protein food may be a good choice for senior cats with age-related muscle loss, but vets don't recommend these diets for cats with kidney disease. What's more, since senior cats commonly have arthritis, most will benefit from a diet with supplements that reduce joint pain. These supplements may include omega-3 fatty acids, green-lipped mussel extract, glucosamine, or chondroitin. Additionally, senior cats who are overweight may benefit from a diet with L-carnitine, an amino acid that helps the body convert fat into energy. This healthy extra may help some senior cats lose weight, which can improve their overall health.\nIs there a difference in senior cat food?\nThe AAFCO hasn't set specific nutritional recommendations for senior cats, so the minimum nutritional recommendations for senior cat foods align with those for adult maintenance or all life stages foods. This leaves a lot of room for variation between senior recipe formulas. Many senior food recipes contain added nutrients to relieve joint pain and increase mobility. Other senior diets may be formulated to help manage specific health conditions, like chronic kidney disease.\nWhen should you switch your cat to senior food?\nThe 2021 AAHA/AAFP Feline Life Stage Guidelines define \"senior\" as 10 years or older. However, certain breeds of cats with chronic health conditions may be considered seniors as early as 8 years old. However, senior cats in good health who eat a quality diet may not need to switch to a senior cat food. If you're trying to decide whether to transition your older cat to a senior diet, you'll want to talk to your vet as a first step. They can recommend the best diet for your cat based on their overall health and any signs of aging you've noticed.\nIs wet or dry food better for senior cats?\nBoth wet and dry foods formulated for your cat's life stage can offer similar nutritional benefits, but wet food may be a better fit for some cats. It helps keep cats hydrated, which is especially important for seniors with conditions like kidney disease and diabetes. On the other hand, dry food may promote dental hygiene by helping clean plaque from the teeth. Kibble is also more budget-friendly than wet food. Dierenfeld says the best food for some senior cats and their caretakers may be a combination of wet and dry food. Ultimately, the decision between wet and dry food will come down to factors like your budget and your cat's health \u2014 along with their preferences.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "While our cats might not know what a love language is, they sure appreciate it when we feed them tasty food. The best wet cat foods come in a range of different flavors and textures, so there's something to please every cat. Ultimately, the healthiest wet food for your cat is nutritionally complete and balanced for their life stage and any specific health issues.\nTo gain insight into how to choose nutritious wet food for kittens, adult cats, and seniors, we consulted veterinarians. With their guidance, we selected formulas from trusted brands. One standout is Wellness Gravies Salmon Entree for adult cats. It provides a healthy balance of protein from salmon, turkey, and egg whites.\nAll of our recommendations meet the standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) and follow the Global Nutrition Guidelines from the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA). For more tips on how to choose high-quality wet cat food, check out our \"what to look for\" section at the end of this article.\nRead more about how Insider Reviews tests and researches pet products.\nHighlights for the best wet cat foods\nBest overall: Wellness Gravies Salmon - See at Chewy\nBest budget: Natural Balance Chicken and Liver - See at Chewy\nBest for indoor cats: Purina One Indoor + Hairball Ocean Whitefish and Rice - See at Chewy\nBest for older cats: Hill's Science Diet Adult 7+ Savory Chicken - See at Chewy\nBest for sensitive stomachs: Royal Canin Digestive Care Thin Slices in Gravy - See at Chewy\nBest for kittens: Iams Perfect Portions Healthy Kitten Chicken - See at Chewy\nBest for hairball control: Purina Pro Plan Hairball Salmon - See at Chewy\nBest fresh: Just Food for Cats Fish and Chicken - See at Chewy\nBest overall\nBoth wet and dry food are quality options for feeding your cat, says Dr. Bruce Kornreich, a board-certified veterinary cardiologist and director of the Cornell Feline Health Center at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. However, your veterinarian might recommend feeding wet food alongside, or in place of, dry food in some instances. Kornreich says wet food is beneficial for cats who need more hydration, particularly older cats with kidney disease. That's because it contains 75% to 78% moisture, compared to 10% to 12% in kibble, according to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nWhen choosing a wet food, make sure meat is listed as the first ingredient. Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they require animal proteins to meet their essential amino acid requirements and maintain normal body functions. You should also check for an AAFCO nutritional adequacy statement on the label. This indicates that the food meets the AAFCO's recommended balance of fats, proteins, essential vitamins, and minerals for a cat's life stage.\nAdditionally, the AAFCO standards say that foods for adult cats should contain a minimum of 26% protein and 9% fat. To compare a wet food's nutrient profile to these standards, you'll need to convert the food's percentages of fat and protein to a \"dry matter basis.\" You can do this by following these directions from the Tufts University Cummings Veterinary Medical Center, contacting the food manufacturer, or asking your veterinarian for help.\nSome of our top wet food picks for the best cat foods are more expensive than other options, but they are rich in animal proteins like deboned chicken, salmon, and turkey \u2014 ingredients that support your cat's health and also appeal to their taste buds.\nThis wet cat food is high in protein but not calories, helping your cat feel full and satisfied while supporting their lean muscle mass.\nAnimal protein sources in this pate for adult cats include deboned chicken, chicken liver, chicken broth, and dried egg product. The recipe also contains omega-3 fatty acids from Menhaden fish oil to support brain health. It consists of 50.1% protein, 36.2% fat, 0.3% fiber, and 101 kcal/3-ounce can.\nSalmon, pork liver, and egg product make up the main protein sources in this wet food for all life stages. The recipe also provides beneficial fiber from carrots and pumpkin and antioxidants from cranberries and blueberries. It contains 48% protein, 18% fat, 9% fiber, and 90 kcal/3-ounce can.\nBest budget\nCost plays an important role in deciding what to feed your cat. The good news is that the best budget-friendly cat foods are nutritionally complete and balanced to meet your cat's needs.\nMany affordable cat foods include byproducts, which are concentrated sources of protein that are biologically appropriate for felines. Byproducts are repurposed ingredients that keep the cost of cat food down, says Dr. Korinn Saker, a retired associate professor of clinical nutrition at the College of Veterinary Medicine at North Carolina State University. These byproducts include parts of the animal other than skeletal meat, like organs, that are still nutritious for cats. Some cat foods are marketed as free of byproducts, grains, or artificial preservatives, but there's no evidence that these diets are more beneficial than other foods that meet the AAFCO standards.\nOur budget-friendly picks for the best wet cat foods contain significantly more protein than the 26% minimum recommended by the AAFCO and include options with and without byproducts.\nThis smooth pate provides complete nutrition for cats of all ages, eliminating the need to switch between kitten and adult foods, all at an affordable price.\nIn this food for adult cats, you\u2019ll find meat protein from chicken, liver, meat byproducts, and turkey plus carrots for beneficial fiber. Its nutritional profile consists of 50% protein, 9% fat, 7.5% fiber, and 73 kcal/3-ounce can.\nThis food for adult cats contains chicken, chicken broth, chicken liver, and egg product. Brown rice and carrots are fiber sources to support digestion and keep cats feeling full. The food contains 50% protein, 22.2% fat, 8.3% fiber, and 80 kcal/3-ounce can.\nBest for indoor cats\nWhile indoor cats may be safe from outdoor dangers like predators and food shortages, they are facing a growing epidemic: feline obesity.\nPet caregivers play a crucial role in managing a cat's access to food and ensuring it's appropriate for their needs, says Dr. Debra Zoran, a board-certified small animal internist and professor at Texas A&M University. Since indoor cats can't hunt for their own food and generally don't get as much exercise as outdoor cats, their diet should be adjusted accordingly. That diet shouldn't replace environmental enrichment or daily play, but offering food formulated for their unique needs is a step in the right direction.\nOur top picks for the best indoor cat foods are lower in calories and fat to help maintain a healthy weight and physique. Added insoluble fibers like powdered cellulose and probiotics such as beet pulp support digestion, while omega-3 fatty acids derived from fish oil keep fur soft and shiny and help reduce shedding and hairballs.\nThis high-moisture wet food is low in calories and includes a special source of fiber to keep your cat feeling full for longer \u2014 perfect for sleepy days indoors.\nThis recipe formulated for indoor adult cats includes protein from turkey broth, turkey, salmon, chicken, chicken liver, and dried egg whites. Omega-3 fatty acids from salmon oil support skin and brain health and fiber from beet pulp aids in digestion. The nutritional profile is 42.3% protein, 26.1% fat, 1.8% fiber, and 80 kcal/3-ounce pouch.\nThis recipe for adult cats contains sources of animal protein such as ocean whitefish, chicken, liver, and pork lungs. Fiber from brown rice and powdered cellulose aid in digestion. The food contains 45.6% protein, 22.2% fat, 9.7% fiber, and 77 kcal/3-ounce can.\nBest for older cats\nAs your cat begins to show age-related changes as early as 7 years old and reaches their senior years around 12 years old, simple adjustments can improve their quality of life. They will likely have two wellness checkups a year instead of one, providing an ideal opportunity to talk with your vet about their changing activity level and caloric needs.\nMost senior cats can eat dry food, says Dr. Jennifer Larsen, a board-certified veterinary nutritionist and professor of clinical nutrition at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. However, even the best and healthiest dry cat food options are typically three to four times more calorie-dense than canned foods. Wet food also contains more moisture, which helps support kidney function and can help manage symptoms of chronic kidney disease. You can learn even more about the differences between canned food and kibble in our explainer on wet vs. dry cat food.\nThe AAFCO does not set specific standards for senior cat food. Instead, foods labeled for seniors are formulated to meet the AAFCO nutritional recommendations for adults and may vary in calories, fiber, and protein. To be sure a food is suitable for your cat, review its nutritional and calorie content and run it by your veterinarian. Look for ingredients like glucosamine and fish oil, which are included in our picks and may help reduce pain, inflammation, and stiffness from age-related conditions such as arthritis. Our recommendations for the best senior cat foods also have fewer calories than our adult food picks.\nThis senior cat food offers joint support and weight management, helping you and your cat make the most of their golden years.\nThe main protein sources in this wet food for cats over 7 years old are chicken, turkey giblets, pork byproducts, and pork liver. Added fish oil may help reduce inflammation and pain from arthritis. The food\u2019s nutrition breakdown is 39% protein, 24% fat, 3% fiber, and 90 kcal/2.9-ounce can.\nThis food for cats 12 years and older counts its main protein sources as pork byproducts, pork liver, chicken, and chicken liver. It contains fish oil, glucosamine, and chondroitin to reduce inflammation and support joint health. It's feeding-trial tested for nutritional adequacy and contains 51% protein, 19% fat, 6% fiber, and 71 kcal/3-ounce can.\nBest for sensitive stomachs\nThe best wet cat foods for sensitive stomachs can reduce the risk of digestive issues like diarrhea, vomiting, or gas. These foods typically contain more easily digestible animal proteins, such as meat byproducts and meat meals, omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil to reduce inflammation, and fiber to prevent constipation.\nLimited ingredient diets can also benefit cats with food intolerances and sensitive stomachs. They contain fewer ingredients, which helps reduce the risk of digestive upset. However, before transitioning your cat to a limited ingredient diet for digestive issues, it's important to talk to your veterinarian to rule out other underlying problems. Saker says food intolerances can mimic some food allergy symptoms, but unlike allergies, they usually affect only the gastrointestinal tract rather than triggering a full-body immune response.\nOur picks for the best sensitive stomach cat food include dietary fiber from ingredients like pumpkin and cellulose, which can help regulate your cat's digestion.\nCats with sensitive stomachs may get relief from this tasty wet food with easy-to-digest ingredients.\nThis all-life stages food contains limited ingredients in the form of animal protein from deboned Alaskan pollock, salmon broth, and cod liver. The omega-3 fatty acids from these marine sources may help decrease gut inflammation. Its nutritional breakdown is 42% protein, 18% fat, 0.9% fiber, and 148 kcal/5-ounce can.\nThis limited-ingredient recipe includes three animal protein sources (deboned chicken, chicken liver, and chicken broth) and one fiber source (flaxseed). Its nutrition profile consists of 36.4% protein, 27.7% fat, 6.4% fiber, and 93 kcal/2.75-ounce can.\nBest for kittens\nSelecting the right food for your kitten can be tricky. First, you'll need to look for foods that meet a growing kitten's nutritional needs. These formulas meet the AAFCO standards for growth or all life stages. They will contain at least 30% protein and 9% fat to support a kitten's rapid growth and high-energy requirements.\nAdditionally, food formulated for growth contains essential nutrients like calcium to support strong bones and teeth and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid, for brain and mental development.\nOur selections for the best kitten foods have all the key nutritional qualities to promote growth. They also include healthy ingredients like antioxidants and prebiotics, which help support a kitten's developing immune and digestive systems.\nThis wet kitten food's ingredient list starts with salmon and ocean fish, which provide protein-rich ingredients and essential fatty acids to support growth.\nThis kitten food is made up of protein from chicken, chicken liver, and chicken broth. Menhaden fish oil is an excellent source of DHA to support cognitive growth and development. Its nutrition profile is 46.7% protein, 37.2% fat, 1% fiber, and 105 kcal/3-ounce can.\nProtein from chicken, poultry liver, chicken broth, and dried egg product are included in this kitten recipe. It contains fish oil as a source of DHA. The nutritional breakdown for this food is 44% protein, 41% fat, 0.4% fiber, and 90 kcal/2.6-ounce twin pack.\nBest for hairball control\nAlthough hairballs are common, it's important to tell your veterinarian if your cat gets them frequently. Hairballs can become a medical issue, balling up in the digestive tract and causing an obstruction. Sometimes your vet may recommend one of the best hairball remedies for cats or a special diet.\nA high-fiber diet can help your cat safely pass hairballs, Larsen says. While the AAFCO doesn't recommend a specific level of dietary fiber for cats, most complete and balanced cat foods include fiber sources in the form of digestible (starches), fermentable (oats), and insoluble (cellulose) fibers. Most hairball control diets also contain insoluble fiber sources like rice hulls and pea fiber. While all types of fiber are beneficial for digestion, insoluble fiber adds bulk to stool, which helps pull fur through the digestive tract.\nDry cat foods are typically higher in fiber, but the best hairball control cat food recipes are formulated with extra insoluble fiber. They also include omega fatty acids to improve skin health and reduce shedding.\nThis cat food for hairball control contains insoluble fiber and omega fatty acids to help reduce hairballs and promote healthy skin and coat.\nAnimal protein sources in this adult wet food are chicken byproducts, pork byproducts, chicken liver, and pork liver. The food is high in fiber, including powdered cellulose. Its nutritional breakdown is 40.3% protein, 14.7% fat, 5.6% fiber, and 55 kcal/3-ounce can.\nThis hairball control food for adult cats contains salmon, meat byproducts, and chicken as its main protein sources. The omega fatty acids from salmon may reduce shedding and added powdered cellulose helps move hair through the digestive tract. The nutrition profile for this food is 45.7% protein, 30.3% fat, 9.5% fiber, and 84 kcal/3-ounce can.\nBest fresh\nSome cats want a bite of every meal we cook, but not all of us have the time or resources to cook our pets fresh meals consisting of whole meats and vegetables. Fresh cat food provides a solution with nutritionally complete and balanced meals made with high-quality human-grade ingredients. Some fresh foods are offered through subscriptions, while others are available for single purchases.\nJustFood for Cats is the best fresh cat food we've tested. It's made in one of nine privately owned kitchens across the US, where it's prepared in collaboration with veterinary nutritionists. JustFood doesn't share processing plants or packaging lines with other companies. Kornreich says this means greater quality control over the ingredients and the prepared food.\nJustFood For Cats delivers complete and balanced nutrition with whole meats and fish.\nWhat to look for in wet cat food\nWhen choosing among the best wet cat foods for your kitten, adult, or senior cat, you'll want to consider the following criteria.\nAAFCO nutritional adequacy statement: A cat food with an AAFCO statement on the label is nutritionally complete for a cat's life stage. The AAFCO is a nonprofit organization that sets the standard nutritional requirements for pet food and animal feed. Foods labeled with an AAFCO statement for growth or all life stages are guaranteed to be complete and balanced for kittens. Foods with an AAFCO statement for maintenance or all life stages are guaranteed to be complete and balanced for adult cats.\nGuaranteed analysis and nutrient profiles: The guaranteed analysis lists the percentages of protein, fat, and other key nutrients. For kittens, a minimum of 9% fat and 30% protein is recommended, while adult cats should get a minimum of 9% fat and 26% protein. Additionally, cat foods should contain other essential nutrients, including amino acids like taurine, fatty acids, minerals, and vitamins.\nTo compare the nutrients in wet food to those in dry food, convert the percentages of fat, protein, and fiber in wet food to a \"dry matter basis.\" To find the dry matter basis, you can use these directions from the Tufts University Cummings Veterinary Medical Center, call the food manufacturer, or ask your veterinarian for help.\nKey ingredients: Ingredients on a pet food label are listed in order of weight. Animal protein is essential for cats to maintain normal body functions because it contains essential amino acids. As a result, cats are obligate carnivores, and animal-based protein should be the first ingredient in cat food.\nExpert formulations: Choose brands with a dedicated nutrition expert on staff, which aligns with the WSAVA Global Nutrition Guidelines and the advice from the veterinarians we interviewed. Even better are brands that actively conduct research on small animal nutrition or collaborate with universities and colleges.\nManufacturing standards: When deciding on a cat food brand, it's important to consider the quality control measures and facilities used in production. Brands that own their manufacturing plants have greater control over the ingredients in their recipes and, therefore, the food your cat consumes. Transparency is also key \u2014 brands should be clear about how they implement quality control measures. Simply saying that they conduct quality control may not be sufficient. Pet food companies should provide this information on their website or be willing to provide it upon request.\nCalorie content: Calorie content in cat food is provided in kilocalories (kcal). The number of calories a cat needs depends on factors like their age and activity level.\nAccording to the Merck Veterinary Manual, kittens should be fed multiple meals daily and allowed to eat as much as they want, as they need more energy to support their rapid growth. When your kitten reaches 9 to 12 months of age, consult your veterinarian to determine their ideal body condition, weight, and caloric requirements.\nThe WSAVA provides a reference chart to estimate the number of calories an adult cat should consume based on their weight, but these are general guidelines. The ideal amount of food for your cat depends on their weight, energy level, breed, and overall health. Your veterinarian can help you determine your cat's daily caloric needs.\nHow we selected the best wet cat foods\nWe consulted three board-certified veterinary nutritionists and one board-certified veterinary cardiologist to land on our recommendations for the best and healthiest wet cat food.\nDr. Bruce Kornreich is a board-certified veterinary cardiologist and director of the Cornell Feline Health Center at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. While Cornell University faculty cannot recommend or recommend against specific brands, Kornreich helped us understand when wet cat food might be appropriate to serve in addition to, or in place of, dry food. He also guided our understanding of what makes a high-quality wet food and what to avoid.\nDr. Debra Zoran is a board-certified small animal internist and professor at Texas A&M University. She also holds a doctorate in animal nutrition from Texas A&M University. Zoran shared insights on cat nutrition and quality food.\nDr. Jennifer Larsen is a board-certified veterinary nutritionist and professor of clinical nutrition at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. Larsen spoke with us about senior cat nutrition and the role of high-fiber diets in feline nutrition and well-being.\nDr. Korinn Saker is a board-certified veterinary nutritionist and a retired professor of clinical nutrition at the North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine. We spoke with Saker about the metabolic needs of indoor cats and feline food intolerance and sensitivities.\nWe also consulted guidelines and recommendations from other organizations, including the AAFCO and the WSAVA Global Nutrition Guidelines.\nWet cat food FAQs\nWhat is the healthiest wet food for a cat?\nBecause cats are obligate carnivores, the best wet cat foods include an animal-based protein as the first ingredient. A nutritionally complete and balanced food also features an AAFCO nutritional adequacy statement on its label. However, there isn't a perfect formula appropriate for every cat or kitten. Your veterinarian can recommend a food tailored to your pet's specific nutritional and caloric requirements based on their age, body condition, and overall health.\nWhat wet food is best for indoor cats?\nObesity is common among indoor cats, especially middle-aged and neutered male cats. Regular exercise, play, enrichment, and low-calorie indoor cat food can help your cat maintain its ideal weight. Omega fatty acids are also included in some indoor cat formulas to promote healthy skin, which could mean less shedding and fewer hairballs. Larsen says indoor cats prone to frequent hairballs may benefit from a diet high in insoluble fiber. Most hairball control diets contain insoluble fiber sources like rice hulls, pea fiber, and cellulose.\nIs it OK to give cats wet food every day?\nWet food with an AAFCO statement of nutritional adequacy is OK to feed your cat every day. However, to prevent food inflexibility, Zoran recommends rotating textures, proteins, and brands starting from a young age. If you'd like to feed your cat at specific times, check out our guide to the best automatic cat feeders.\nDo vets recommend wet food for cats?\nBoth canned and dry foods can meet the nutritional needs of cats and kittens, as long as they're labeled with the AAFCO nutritional adequacy statement for your cat's specific life stage. The most appropriate food for your cat depends on their overall health, your budget, and your cat's preferences. Kornreich says veterinarians may recommend a wet diet for older cats with kidney disease or those prone to dehydration. If you're unsure how much your cat should eat or if they have special nutritional needs, talk to your veterinarian.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "When it comes to cat food, many people assume that a higher price means better quality. But the most important thing for cats is a complete and balanced diet, says Dr. Lisa Weeth, a board-certified veterinary nutritionist at Metropolitan Animal Specialty Hospital and founder of Weeth Nutrition Services. The best cat foods are rich in animal-based proteins and have a good balance of healthy fats, fiber, and some carbohydrates. While expensive foods often include premium ingredients like probiotics, extra vitamins, or whole chunks of meat, they can cost nearly twice as much as the best budget-friendly cat foods. Cheaper cat foods, however, still meet the essential nutritional requirements without the added extras that drive up the price.\nOur top pick for affordable wet cat food, Natural Balance Original Ultra Chicken and Liver, costs just $0.36 per ounce, compared to the average price of $0.59 per ounce for premium brands. Budget brands such as Natural Balance keep costs down by using processed pates, large-scale production, and simple packaging. You can save even more money by purchasing budget dry food. We recommend Nutro Wholesome Essentials Adult Cat Salmon and Brown Rice, which contains nutrients from salmon and liver to support healthy joints and lean muscle mass.\nRegardless of its price, your cat's food should meet the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) requirements for complete and balanced nutrition. For more advice on choosing a budget-friendly cat food, scroll down to the \"What to look for\" section on this page.\nRead more about how Business Insider Reviews tests and evaluates pet products.\nOur top picks for the best budget-friendly cat foods\nBest dry: Nutro Wholesome Essentials Adult Cat Salmon and Brown Rice - See at Chewy\nBest wet: Natural Balance Original Ultra Chicken and Liver - See at Chewy\nBest dry for kittens: Purina Kitten Chow Naturals Original - See at Chewy\nBest wet for kittens: Iams Perfect Portions Healthy Kitten Chicken - See at Chewy\nBest for indoor cats: Natural Balance Original Ultra Indoor Chicken - See at Chewy\nBest for seniors: Natural Balance Original Ultra Salmon - See at Chewy\nBest for sensitive stomachs: Iams Perfect Portions Sensitive Digestion and Skin Turkey - See at Chewy\nBest for weight loss: Purina One Ideal Weight White Meat Chicken in Gravy - See at Chewy\nBest dry\nNutro Wholesome Essentials Adult Salmon and Brown Rice keeps your adult cat on the prowl with 33% protein from salmon, a good source of omega fatty acids.\nCats are obligate carnivores, meaning they need animal-based proteins to get essential nutrients like taurine, which supports heart health, vision, and immune function. So long as the food meets the AAFCO's nutritional recommendations, it doesn't matter whether taurine comes from whole meats like deboned chicken or concentrated protein like the chicken meal in Nutro Wholesome Essentials Adult Cat Salmon and Brown Rice.\nMarketing often influences our perceptions of pet food ingredients, such as meat meals and byproducts. These ingredients, which come from animal parts such as liver, heart, and spleen, aren't inherently bad for your cat. In fact, they're more nutrient-dense than whole cuts of meat. This allows brands like Nutro to use smaller amounts of ingredients while still providing complete and balanced nutrition, helping to keep costs lower for some of the best dry cat foods.\nNutro has been making pet food since 1926, giving them nearly a century of experience. Weeth says choosing a manufacturer with at least 20 years in the industry is important because it means they've had time to refine their formulas, maintain quality control, and establish a proven track record.\nBest wet\nThis smooth pate provides complete nutrition for cats of all ages, eliminating the need to switch between kitten and adult foods, all at an affordable price.\nPremium canned cat food brands often contain minimally processed ingredients, such as shredded chicken and chunks of liver. These whole-muscle meats and carefully selected organ meats closely resemble the nutritional profile of a cat's natural diet and have an appearance that appeals to people. However, the extra attention required for ingredient sourcing, processing, and presentation drives up the cost without necessarily making the food more nutritious than more processed options. \"What matters is the quality control behind the sourcing and processing of these ingredients, not whether they resemble human food,\" says Dr. Nita Vasudevan, a veterinarian and veterinary consultant for Embrace Pet Insurance.\nNatural Balance Original Ultra Chicken and Liver Recipe stands out as one of the best wet cat foods with a lower price tag. The pate-style formula is cheaper to produce than more complex shredded or steamed recipes. Vasudevan says liver, whether it's in a smooth pate or chunky form, is an especially nutritious ingredient for cats, as it's rich in vitamins and amino acids. Weeth says liver also has a taste and smell that's especially appealing to cats, Weeth says.\nNatural Balance has been producing pet foods for over 30 years and is available at major retailers both online and across the United States. Weeth says brands like Natural Balance that distribute nationwide often have to meet stricter regulations than smaller, local companies because they ship products across state lines.\nBest dry kitten food\nThe main protein sources in this kitten food are chicken, chicken byproduct meal, and beef fat. It has undergone feeding trials to ensure nutritional adequacy. The food\u2019s nutrition breakdown is 40% protein, 15% fat, 2.5% fiber, and 406 kcal/cup.\nKittens need multiple meals a day, and while each portion may be small, the cost can add up quickly \u2014 especially if you've adopted a pair. Purina Kitten Chow Naturals Original is a budget-friendly alternative to premium formulas like Purina Pro Plan, Royal Canin, and Hill's, with its cost-effective ingredients that still meet the essential nutritional requirements for healthy growth.\nPremium kitten food brands often go beyond the basics, incorporating higher levels of animal-based protein, added probiotics, or extra functional nutrients like docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega fatty acid essential for cognitive growth and development in kittens, and vitamin E, an antioxidant that provides immune support. Purina Kitten Chow Naturals Original keeps costs lower by meeting, rather than exceeding, recommended nutrient levels. It contains a blend of chicken byproduct meal and corn gluten meal for cost-effective, concentrated protein and fats, while fish oil provides DHA to support healthy development.\nThis recipe has undergone feeding trials, meaning real cats have tested it to ensure its palatability, digestibility, and long-term nutritional benefits. Additionally, Purina recipes are backed by the Purina Institute, a global organization owned and operated by Nestl\u00e9 that collaborates with leading veterinary associations and academic institutions to advance pet nutrition research.\nBest wet kitten food\nProtein from chicken, poultry liver, chicken broth, and dried egg product are included in this kitten recipe. It contains fish oil as a source of DHA. The nutritional breakdown for this food is 44% protein, 41% fat, 0.4% fiber, and 90 kcal/2.6-ounce twin pack.\nWet food is typically more expensive than kibble, which is one reason our sources recommend feeding kittens a mix of wet and dry foods. This approach helps manage costs and exposes kittens to different textures, making them less likely to become picky eaters as they grow. \"Cats fixate on textures and flavors at a relatively young age, so the first one to two years of life is your opportunity to add variety,\" Weeth says.\nIams Perfect Portions Healthy Kitten Chicken Recipe is a standout choice because its small servings prevent food \u2014 and money \u2014 from going to waste. Kittens will lap up the chicken and savory chicken broth in this food, which also includes nutrient-rich poultry liver and dried egg product as additional protein sources. Like our other picks for the best kitten foods, it's fortified with essential vitamins and minerals to support growth, while fish oil provides DHA.\nIams is a budget-friendly brand owned by Mars Inc., which distributes pet food in more than 40 countries.\nBest for indoor cats\nThis recipe for indoor adult cats includes protein from chicken and whitefish. It includes omega-3 fatty acids from salmon oil that support skin and coat health and dried plain beet pulp for beneficial fiber. The nutritional profile is 45.4% protein, 29.8% fat, 1.66% fiber, and 200 kcal/5.5-ounce can.\nWith so much time spent lounging in sunbeams, our experts say indoor cats benefit from food that supports weight management. Natural Balance Original Ultra Indoor Chicken Recipe wet food is one of the best indoor cat foods because it contains lean proteins and hearty fiber. Plus, its high moisture content means fewer calories per serving, says Dr. Liza Cahn, a veterinarian and veterinary consultant for Embrace Pet Insurance.\nChicken and whitefish provide lean protein, while fiber from dried plain beet pulp and carrots help regulate bowel movements and prevent hairballs. \"Fiber content in your cat's diet can help move hair through the digestive system,\" says Dr. Jamie Richardson, head of veterinary medicine at Small Door Vet. Plus, omega fatty acids \u2014 found in the salmon oil in this recipe \u2014 support joint health, to keep your cat comfortably prowling around the house.\nBest for seniors\nThe main protein sources in this wet cat food are salmon, fish broth, chicken liver, chicken, mackerel, and dried egg product. Added salmon oil provides joint support, and it contains antioxidants from vitamin E. The food's nutrition breakdown is 49.7% protein, 27.7% fat, 1.2% fiber, and 165 kcal/5.5-ounce can.\nThe AAFCO doesn't publish nutritional recommendations for senior cats like they do for kittens and adults, so a product marketed for seniors isn't necessarily formulated to meet their unique needs. That means a brand can charge more by simply labeling a food as \"senior,\" even if it doesn't contain meaningful differences in nutrition. According to Dr. Carly Fox, a senior veterinarian at the Schwarzman Animal Medical Center, the best senior cat foods support weight management and include fatty acids, both of which can be highly effective in improving mobility.\nUltra Original Ultra Salmon Recipe isn't formulated \u2014 or marketed \u2014 specifically for senior cats, which may contribute to its lower price than other budget-friendly senior options. However, it's packed with omega fatty acids from sources like salmon, ocean fish, egg, and salmon oil. It's also the lowest in calories at 30 kcal per ounce, yet it helps keep cats feel satiated with brown rice, a complex carbohydrate that takes longer for the body to break down.\nIt's always a good idea to consult your vet before selecting a senior diet for your cat to ensure it meets their individual needs. In fact, prescription diets are often recommended for cats with age-related diseases such as kidney or liver disease. Weeth says a therapeutic diet formulated to address specific health concerns is a better choice because it can have a significant impact on their health.\nBest for sensitive stomachs\nThis pate is packed with proteins that are easy to digest, high-quality fiber, and beneficial omega fatty acids.\nHealthy cats on an ideal diet typically poop once or twice a day, Weeth says. If your cat's digestion seems off, you might not need to jump to expensive, premium foods. \"There are budget-friendly non-prescription diets tailored to common health concerns,\" Vasudevan says.\nFor cats with sensitive stomachs, Vasudevan recommends looking for recipes with limited ingredients, easily digestible proteins (such as chicken, turkey, or whitefish), fiber, and omega fatty acids. She also says the soft texture of wet foods can be gentler on sensitive stomachs compared to some dry foods.\nA great food to consider is Iams Perfect Portions Sensitive Digestion and Skin Turkey Recipe. It features turkey as a primary, easily digestible protein. Whitefish and added fish oil are rich in omega fatty acids while dried beet pulp provides fiber.\nBest for weight loss\nThis wet weight management food contains protein chicken, liver, pork lungs, and ocean whitefish. It also includes fiber from powdered cellulose and L-carnitine to support fat burning. Its nutrition profile is 47.1% protein, 11.7% fat, 4.4% fiber, and 69 kcal/3-ounce can.\nCutting back on the amount you feed your cat isn't the safest way to help them lose weight because it can lead to nutritional deficiencies, says Dr. Julie Churchill, a veterinary nutritionist and professor of nutrition at the University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine. Instead, a nutrient-dense, low-calorie food formulated for weight loss can help cats lose extra weight gradually and safely.\nWet food, like Purina One Ideal Weight White Meat Chicken Recipe, is a great option because it contains extra water that can help fill a cat up even though they're consuming fewer calories. While dry food costs less, it's more calorie-dense, even in weight management formulas. Wet food lets your cat enjoy a bigger portion size, which can make them feel more satisfied.\nOur budget pick for the best weight loss food for cats includes lean protein from chicken and whitefish. It also contains fiber from powdered cellulose to help your cat stay full, reducing the chances of them begging for snacks between meals. However, if your cat tends to eat too quickly or still begs between meals, a puzzle feeder can help. \"Replicating hunting behaviors with puzzles can prevent boredom, reduce stress, and promote a healthier, more active lifestyle,\" Richardson says. The addition of the amino acid L-carnitine may also help them burn fat and build muscle.\nWhat to look for in budget-friendly cat food\nWhen choosing a budget cat food, it's essential to make sure it meets the same standards as all of the best pet foods. Here are the key qualities to look for when selecting a healthy recipe for your cat.\nAAFCO nutritional adequacy: The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) is a nonprofit organization of animal feed regulators from the US and Canada. In collaboration with the US Food and Drug Administration, the AAFCO sets nutritional standards for pet food. We only recommend products that meet these standards. To check if a food meets these standards, look for a statement on the label that says it was tested by feeding it to animals or formulated to be complete and balanced. \"This is a quick way to make sure the food you are feeding your pet is balanced and not lacking in certain key nutrients,\" says Dr. Caitlin Johnson, a veterinarian at Lovet Pet Health Care.\nWSAVA nutrition guidelines: The World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) is an international network of veterinarians who work together to publish guidelines for pet nutrition and disease management. You can think of the WSAVA Global Nutrition Guidelines as the gold standard for evaluating pet food and making informed purchasing decisions. For instance, brands should employ a board-certified veterinary nutritionist, conduct feeding trials or formulate their food to be complete and balanced, and follow strict quality control and safety testing to ensure the highest quality food for pets, Johnson says.\nGuaranteed analysis and calories: The guaranteed analysis on a pet food label lists the minimum and maximum percentages of essential nutrients, such as protein, fat, and fiber. Because wet food contains more moisture than dry food, you'll need to convert the percentages to a dry matter basis, which is the amount of nutrients with the water removed. You can do this by following these directions from Tufts University, reaching out to the manufacturer, or asking your vet for help. For this guide, we contacted the manufacturers to verify the guaranteed analysis. The label should also provide the number of calories, listed in kilocalories (kcals) per cup, ounce, or serving. If the calories aren't listed, you may need to contact the manufacturer or check the brand's website for more details.\nBrand reputation: Choosing a pet food brand with at least 20 years of experience can give you confidence in its long-term track record and the reliability of its formulas over time. While you may be inclined to support small, local businesses, Weeth says to think twice about pet food from small, regionally distributed brands. Companies that sell across multiple states must meet stricter regulations, adding an extra layer of quality assurance to their products.\nIams, Natural Balance, and Purina are known for being some of the best budget-friendly cat food brands. Their affordable recipes are often backed by more robust science than boutique brands. Because these companies are large, they have the resources to hire full-time, board-certified veterinary nutritionists and conduct extensive research to advance our understanding of pet nutrition.\nIngredients: The most important ingredient in any cat food is animal-based protein, and it should be listed first or, in wet food diets, second only to water. \"Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning, they eat strictly animal products,\" Johnson says. This doesn't mean cats can't or shouldn't eat grains and carbohydrates. These ingredients provide fiber and are required for energy. \"In the wild, cats naturally consume grains from the stomach contents of their prey,\" she says.\nOrgan meat is one of the best protein sources for cats and is often found in the form of byproducts or meat meals in our picks for affordable cat food. Although these ingredients frequently get a bad rap, Weeth says strict regulations define what qualifies as a byproduct, so your cat receives only highly nutritious and appropriate ingredients.\nPrice per pound and feeding guidelines: The feeding guidelines on the back of a pet food package offer a rough estimate of how much to feed your cat. However, they often overestimate portion sizes, which can lead to overfeeding and higher costs. While these guidelines can be helpful for comparing per-serving costs between different foods, the most accurate way to determine appropriate portion sizes is by consulting your veterinarian, who can recommend your cat's ideal daily calorie intake. If you can't get to the vet right now, the Pet Nutrition Alliance provides an online calorie estimator for cats and dogs.\nAuto-shipping discounts: Once you've found a food, you can buy it in bulk or set up automatic shipments to save more money. Retailers such as Chewy and Amazon offer modest discounts for signing up for auto-ship subscriptions, and the savings can really add up over time. Plus, with automatic deliveries, your cat's meals show up right when you need them.\nHow we selected the best budget-friendly cat foods\nAs a pets reporter for Business Insider, I've written over a dozen articles on pet food and spoken to even more experts in the field. I wouldn't recommend any food I wouldn't feed my own cats. Every brand selected in this guide has been making pet food for over 20 years and employs a full-time board-certified veterinary nutritionist to ensure quality and safety.\nTo make informed recommendations about the best cheap cat food, I consulted two veterinary nutritionists and five small animal veterinarians. While they didn't recommend specific foods, they helped me identify what makes a high-quality cat food and how to feed a cat safely on a budget. I also reviewed guidelines from the AAFCO, WSAVA, and other authoritative sources cited in this guide. Finally, I evaluated each food's cost per pound or ounce, as well as ingredient quality, nutritional value, and feeding guidelines, to compile my list of the best budget-friendly cat foods.\nBudget-friendly cat food FAQs\nWhat is the cheapest way to feed a cat?\nIt might be tempting to feed your cat scraps from your own meals, but even meat scraps aren't complete and balanced. \"The least expensive dry kibble at the store is still better than an unbalanced home-prepared diet,\" Weeth says. The best cheap cat food is a complete and balanced kibble that meets the AAFCO nutritional guidelines. To keep costs down without compromising nutrition, choose a well-established brand that produces food in large batches. Large-quantity food production reduces the cost per unit. Well-established brands often have a strong track record of quality control and safety, ensuring that large batch production doesn't compromise the consistency or nutritional value of the food. To make your bag of kibble last longer, feed only the recommended portion and store leftovers in an airtight container.\nWhat is the most nutritious cheap cat food?\nThe most nutritious cat food contains animal-based proteins, fiber, fat, and some carbohydrates. Some of the best ingredients that make cat food cheap yet nutritious are byproducts and meat meals. \"Organs like liver and heart are naturally rich in vitamins and amino acids,\" Vasudevan says. Our pick for the best affordable dry cat food is Nutro Wholesome Essentials Adult Cat Salmon and Brown Rice, which costs about $3 per pound when purchased in bulk.\nHow can I feed a lot of cats cheaply?\nAnimal rescues and caretakers feeding feral or community cats often choose kibble over wet food because it's the most cost-effective option and won't spoil when left out for a day or two, says Kara Burns, a licensed veterinary technician and nutrition specialist at EveryCat Health Foundation. Kibble is cheaper to produce than canned food, and it's more calorie-dense, so a smaller portion will provide cats with adequate nutrition. Buying in bulk from trusted brands like Iams, Natural Balance, or Purina helps stretch your budget even further.\nWhat can I do if I can't afford cat food?\nIf you're struggling to afford cat food, there are many resources available to help keep your pet fed. Start by contacting your county animal shelter or animal services, as many offer pet food and supplies at no cost. You can also search for community pet food banks in your area, such as this list of pet food banks in the Pacific Northwest. Websites like FindHelp.org help you to find local animal welfare organizations and other assistance programs by zip code. Additionally, there are financial assistance and grant programs, such as RedRover, which offers support to households meeting specific income requirements.\nIf you're open to crowdfunding, platforms like GoFundMe or Facebook Fundraisers can help raise money for pet food or medical costs and supplies. You can also create and share an Amazon wishlist with family and friends. If veterinary bills are preventing you from affording pet food, consider Waggle. It's a pet-specific crowdfunding site that works with your vet to estimate care costs and create a fundraiser on your behalf.\nLastly, don't beat yourself up if premium pet food isn't in your budget \u2014 what matters most is providing a complete and balanced diet. \"Your love and care matter more than a fancy food label,\" Vasudevan says.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "Pet Food Nutrient Calculator: Comparing nutrient levels between two pet foods\nMany owners use the label to compare the amounts of nutrients in different pet foods. Or they look on the manufacturers\u2019 websites or even give them a call to get more information on nutrient levels. Once you get these numbers, the comparison isn\u2019t as easy as it seems, however. Two things need to be considered about nutrient levels in pet food:\n- The numbers you get from the label (and usually the numbers you get from the manufacturer) are usually either in percent, mg/kg, ppm (parts per million), or more rarely IU/kg.\n- These nutrient amounts are usually given on an \u201cas fed\u201d basis (i.e. as the food is in the bag or can). \u201cAs fed\u201d numbers make it very difficult to compare foods because they don\u2019t take into account the variable levels of water or calories in different foods.\nComparing a nutrient in two dry foods\nAs an example, think about the two foods in Table 1 below. These are real dry dog foods that both have the same % of calcium as fed. However, they differ dramatically in terms of calories! If your dog requires 500 calories per day to stay at her optimal weight, she\u2019d need to eat 2 cups of Diet A per day or 1 cup of Diet B per day to meet her calorie needs. When we calculate how much calcium she is actually getting from each food, in milligrams (mg), we see that because she\u2019s eating twice as much of Diet A, she\u2019s also getting twice as much calcium from Diet A.\n| Calories/cup | % Calcium on label or website | Mg of calcium per cup | Cups eaten per day | Total mg calcium eaten per day | |\n| Diet A | 250 | 1.12% | 430 | 2 | 860 |\n| Diet B | 500 | 1.12% | 296 | 1 | 296 |\n| Table 1. Comparison of the calcium content of two dry dog foods fed to a dog that needs 500 kcal per day to maintain an ideal weight. |\nNow let\u2019s look at two cat foods, one dry and one canned (Table 2). Perhaps your vet has suggested trying a lower fat diet for your cat. Which diet do you think is lower in fat \u2013 Diet A, a dry food that contains 12% fat, or Diet B, a canned food that contains 6% fat? It seems obvious that it should be the canned food, but as you can see below, once we take the water out (called dry matter) and adjust for the calories, the canned food actually has nearly twice the fat that is in the dry food. This is because the percentages on the label include all the water in the food and don\u2019t take into account the calories in the food, either. The average dry food is about 10% water and canned foods are approximately 75% water. Therefore, the percentages on the canned food will always look much lower compared to dry foods.\n| Type of diet | % fat on label | % moisture | % fat dry matter | Fat g/100 kcal food | |\n| Diet A | dry | 12 | 7% | 12.8 | 3.5 |\n| Diet B | canned | 6 | 78% | 26.3 | 6.3 |\n| Table 2. Comparison of the fat content of a dry with a canned cat food |\nThe best way around these issues is to convert the nutrient amounts to the same units based on calories [units per 100 calories (kcal)] so you can compare apples to apples. This conversion involves some math, but we\u2019ve made it easy for you with this calculator.\nTo use this calculator, you\u2019ll need 2 pieces of information:\n- How many calories are in your food or treat, in kcal/kg. This information should be on the label, but may also be on the manufacturer\u2019s website. If you can\u2019t find it on either of those, you\u2019ll need to call the manufacturer\u2019s customer service line (and you should be suspicious of the manufacturer as this information is required to be on food labels and most treat labels!).\n- You\u2019ll also need to know the amounts of the nutrient(s) you are interested in (sodium, fat, copper, phosphorus, etc) on an \u201cas fed\u201d basis \u2013 this information may be on the website, but you\u2019ll more likely need to call the customer service line. Ask for the \u201caverage\u201d or \u201ctypical\u201d analysis (not the \u201cguaranteed analysis,\u201d which is only minimums or maximums). And double check that they\u2019re giving you numbers on an \u201cas fed\u201d basis. Remember, if the company can\u2019t or won\u2019t give you this information, it should be a red flag and you probably don\u2019t want to feed that food to your pet."

      "text": "Fiber Frustrations\nIf you asked me to name the nutrient that causes the most confusion for pet owners and veterinarians alike, I\u2019d have to say fiber. Fiber is carbohydrate from plants that cannot be digested by the enzymes that mammals make and use in our gastrointestinal tract.\nFiber is associated with health benefits in both people and pets. For healthy pets, fiber can affect stool quality and regularity and promote a healthy population of gut bacteria. It can also have benefits for a number of health concerns in pets such as gastrointestinal issues, diabetes, high cholesterol and triglycerides, and for weight loss.\nThere are two properties based on which fiber can be classified: solubility and fermentability. Solubility is a measure of how thoroughly the fiber dissolves in water. Insoluble fibers do not dissolve while highly soluble fibers dissolve completely. Insoluble fibers basically enter and exit the body virtually unchanged. They tend to increase stool volume and frequency. The most common type of insoluble fiber found in pet foods is cellulose. Wheat bran is a good source of insoluble fiber that may be supplemented for people or pets.\nSoluble fibers include pectins, gums, and fructans. Pure soluble fibers will dissolve in water and form gels if in the right proportions (pectins are used to make jam). Soluble fiber supplements for people are often advertised as being able to be mixed in with any kind of food or beverage while producing \u201cno gritty residue\u201d. Common soluble fiber sources in pet foods include guar gum and inulin (often derived from Jerusalem artichoke or chicory root). Soluble fibers tend to slow digestion and pull water into the gut.\nFibers can also be categorized on the basis of the ability of gut bacteria to use them to produce nutrients for the bacteria as well as the cells that line the colon. This process is called fermentation. Generally, the more soluble the fiber source, the more rapidly and completely fermentable it is. While the ability to be fermented by gut bacteria can provide health benefits to the gut and the bacteria (which appear to be closely tied to overall health), too much highly fermentable fiber can interfere with digestion and can lead to excessive production of gas and associated gastrointestinal discomfort. Fermentable, soluble fibers are often called \u201cprebiotic\u201d fibers because of their benefit to the gut bacteria.\nNot all fiber is completely soluble or insoluble. Some is a mixture \u2013 examples include beet pulp, psyllium seed husk, and oat bran. These fibers will have an effect related to their ratios of soluble to insoluble components as well as their fermentability.\nComparing fiber content between foods\nOne of the biggest challenges of fiber is that it can be very difficult to compare the amounts of each type of fiber or even the total fiber between commercial pet foods. The fiber amount listed on the pet food label in the Guaranteed Analysis is the maximum \u201ccrude fiber\u201d, which includes most, but not all, insoluble fiber, but does not include any soluble fiber. Plus, because it is a maximum, the actual crude fiber in the diet could be much lower. In general, the crude fiber on the pet food label is not a very good representative of the actual amount of fiber in a pet food.\nAnother type of fiber analysis, total dietary fiber (TDF), measures soluble fiber and the most common types of insoluble fibers in pet foods and is a more accurate measurement of the total fiber in a food. The TDF analysis (used for human foods) is more time-consuming and considerably more expensive than crude fiber measurement. Because of these limitations and because it is not required of pet food companies, TDF is rarely available for commercial pet foods.\nBecause the crude fiber only includes insoluble fiber, total fiber in the diet may be much higher than the crude fiber value listed on the label if the diet is high in soluble fiber. This discrepancy is likely why it can be so hard to match up fiber amounts in pet foods \u2013 two diets that are similar in crude fiber could be very different in terms of the total amount and the types of fiber and these variations could have a dramatically different effect in the pet.\nDifferences in fiber type and amount likely result in many of the gastrointestinal issues that pet owners see that vary with diet \u2013 they can often explain a pet who has poor stool quality on one diet but perfect stool on another. Too much or too little or the wrong mixture of fiber is a much more likely reason for a pet to not do well on a specific diet than a food allergy, despite much misinformation to the contrary.\nAdjusting the fiber in your pet\u2019s diet\nIf you think your pet might benefit from more fiber, touch base with your veterinarian. If she agrees, you have the option of feeding a higher fiber diet, or adding fiber supplements to the existing diet. If you\u2019re going to try a higher fiber diet, it\u2019s best to use one from your veterinarian \u2013 therapeutic high fiber diets will have more accurate measurement of the types and amount of fiber than over-the-counter diets, making it much easier to sort things out.\nCommon fiber supplements that may be added to pet foods include psyllium seed husk, wheat bran, cellulose, and inulin, all of which are available commercially for humans. Many pet owners also add vegetables such as pumpkin or green beans to the diet as fiber sources. The challenge with these foods is that while they are healthy and safe for most pets, the fiber they contain is variable and typically low compared to the amount that could be obtained from a small amount of a concentrated fiber supplement.\nWhich type of fiber to use and how much is going to vary based on the goals, size of pet, type of pet (cat vs dog), and to a good extent some trial-and-error. There is limited guidance for standardized dosages of fiber to add to an existing commercial diet. One study found benefits in dogs with a median dosage of 2 tablespoons per day of a common human psyllium supplement, although there was a range of 0.25 to 6 tablespoons per day.\nIf supplemented, fiber should always be given gradually over a few days to weeks until the stool reaches the desired composition or other desired benefit is reached (or it becomes clear that it is not helping). When choosing a fiber supplement, take care that any products intended for people do not contain xylitol or other artificial sweeteners. It is generally best to select pure sources with no added flavors, colors, or sweeteners.\nThe table below compares the TDF as well as the soluble and insoluble breakdown of several fiber sources commonly included in pet foods or supplemented in addition to pet foods.\nCommon fiber supplements used for pets (nutrients per tablespoon)\n| Fiber | Calories | Total Dietary Fiber (g) |\nSoluble fiber (g) | Insoluble fiber (g) |\n| Canned pumpkin | 5 | 0.4 | 0.1 | 0.4 |\n| Wheat bran | 8 | 1.6 | 0.1 | 1.6 |\n| Oat bran | 14 | 0.9 | 0.4 | 0.5 |\n| Psyllium seed husk | 17 | 3.5 | 3.0 | 0.5 |\n| Inulin | 5 | 2.5 | 2.5 | 0 |"

      "text": "About\nDr. Ellen Dierenfeld has been working in the field of comparative animal nutrition for many years. Her interest started with exposure to wildlife pets (skunks, raccoons, alligator (bad choice), salamanders, turtles, rabbits along with routine domestic pets (dogs, cats, ducks, chickens) and livestock (pigs and lambs in our kitchen!) through growing up in Iowa with a large-animal veterinarian father. Studying Fisheries and Wildlife Biology initially, then transferring to Animal Science for undergraduate work at Iowa State University led to more detailed graduate studies in animal nutrition at Cornell University (giant pandas for MS degree; wombats, kangaroos and rabbits for PhD topic). She headed the Department of Wildlife Nutrition at the Wildlife Conservation Society (based at the Bronx Zoo) for 17 years before moving back to the Midwest and overseeing the Nutrition Department at the St. Louis Zoo. She spent additional time working various roles within the pet food (Director of Nutrition and Research, Oxbow Pet Products) and animal agriculture industries (Lead Scientist, Outreach; Africa R&D and Manager, Global Sustainability, Novus International), with field work conducted on 6 continents. She oversees multiple graduate students and serves as honorary faculty at several universities globally, has published over 200 research papers in peer-reviewed journals, and currently consults privately several zoos, companies, wildlife organizations and individuals.\nHistory\nIn response to a lack of suitable software for dietary management in zoos, her team developed and managed Zootrition\u2122 software over the past 2 decades. Initially supported by a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library services in the 1990s, Zootrition was designated a national standard by the Dutch Federation of Zoos and the Colombian Zoo Association in South America, and recognized as an important resource by the European Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Functionality and design reflected feedback and input from hundreds of users across the globe, including academicians, clinicians, advisors, and colleagues, as well as participants in more than 200 training workshops on three continents.\nAn upgraded program (Zootrition 2.0) was funded through a Conservation Endowment Fund grant from the American Zoo and Aquarium Association, as well as support from the Wildlife Conservation Society. Saint Louis Zoo and the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums assisted in securing the development of subsequent 2.6 and 2.7 versions to incorporate additional data and technical functionality.\nThis latest version (Zootrition 2020) seamlessly migrates your older version data and edits into the new program and further integrates additional data and technical advances into a more streamlined and comprehensive tool for recording and evaluating diets of wildlife species under our care and commitment. The continued interest, suggestions and promotion of Zootrition by the global wildlife community is sincerely appreciated.\nTestimonials\nAna Raquel - Conservation Director of AZAB and member of the Nutrition Committee\n\"I had the opportunity to meet Dr. Ellen in 2014, during a nutrition workshop organized by the Brazilian Zoos and Aquariums Association, AZAB. Back then, she introduced the Zootrition software and made copies available so that the professionals which attended could put into practice everything they learned. From this moment on, a nutrition committee was organized in AZAB and, besides supporting institutions on the utilization of the software, other workshops were organized, and the analysis of diets offered by the institutions to the species that are part of conservation programs was performed. We can say that Zootrition brought a new perspective to the nutrition of Brazilian zoos and aquariums, and we are very grateful for this opportunity. It's an easy-to-use software, and it has lots of information. For sure, the animals in our care are thankful for it too!\""
