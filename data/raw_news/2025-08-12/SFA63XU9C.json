  "description": "The 38 asylum seekers arrived in Portugal after a perilous voyage of up to 250 miles in a tiny 15ft boat - and face being deported from Portugal within weeks",
  "content": "This is the moment a group of migrants land on an Algarve beach where thousands of wealthy Brits holiday every year.\n\nThe 38 asylum seekers arrived in Portugal after a perilous voyage of up to 250 miles in a tiny 15ft boat - and face being deported from Portugal within weeks.\n\nThey were rounded up by Portuguese police on Friday near Burgau on part of the Algarve coast which is a popular retreat for tourists, and only four miles from Praia da Luz where Madeleine McCann disappeared.\n\nOne of the Moroccan nationals claimed that four people on the flimsy wooden boat had died during their five days at sea in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nBut in an example of Portugal\u2019s no-nonsense policy on illegal immigration, the 25 men, six women and seven children face being quickly returned to Morocco.\n\nTourists and locals alike watched in amazement as the dehydrated and hungry migrants stumbled ashore on idyllic Boca do Rio beach.\n\nThree of the children, aged 12 months, eight and ten, were taken to a paediatric emergency clinic in Faro, and a man was taken to a hospital in Portim\u00e3o, but all were soon discharged.\n\nThe group whose arrival was the largest on the Algarve coast in recent years were temporarily given makeshift camp beds at a sports hall in Vila do Bispo near Sagres and kept under guard.\n\nThey were given food kits containing biscuits, juice, milk, bread, p\u00e2t\u00e9, fruit and water, along with toothpaste, toothbrushes, sanitary pads and bath products.\n\nBut 31 of them were taken to a court in Silves on Saturday afternoon where a duty judge gave them 20 days to voluntarily return to their country of origin.\n\nThe judge ordered that if they failed to board flights back to Morocco, they faced being forcefully returned within 60 days.\n\nA separate court hearing in Lagos is due to decide the fate of the remaining seven migrants \u2013 a mother and father, along with their three children, a 14-year-old boy and a man with kidney problems.\n\nAll the migrants have since been moved to secure detention centres in Lisbon, Faro and Porto.\n\nThe speed with which they have been dealt with contrasts starkly with the treatment of migrants arriving in small boats in the UK who are often housed for months in four star hotels at the expense of British taxpayers and left free to come and go.\n\nNone of the group in the Algarve have tried to claim asylum and any application on the grounds of race, religion, nationality or political opinions is unlikely to succeed due to Portugal regarding Morocco as a safe country.\n\nAnt\u00f3nio Leit\u00e3o Amaro, the Minister of the Presidency in Portugal\u2019s centre-right minority Government, said: \u2018At the moment there is no request for asylum and it is not worth speculating on the subject.\u2019\n\nHe praised Portuguese officials for the speedy way they had dealt with the migrants, while treating them with \u2018dignity\u2019 and providing \u2018medical assistance\u2019, and taking them to court which had \u2018decided quickly and concluded the order of their removal from the national territory\u2019.\n\nOfficials suggested that the group had headed for Portugal for \u2018economic\u2019 reasons as they were unhappy with work opportunities in Morocco.\n\nRute Silva, the mayor of Vila do Bispo, told the Observador newspaper: \u2018We have a law, and it has to be complied with, because they entered our country illegally. But these people want a better life, they will not risk their own lives and those of their families for anything.\u2019\n\nThe Daily Mail revealed last weekend how another group of nine Moroccan men who jumped off a speedboat which landed them on a beach at Castell de Ferro near Malaga, Spain, were being treated in a similar way.\n\nThe arrival of the group in Spain made headlines after a video clip showed several of the men being rugby-tackled and detained by tourists on the beach, including off duty police officers.\n\nThey are all now being held in a secure purpose-built unit behind ten foot fences in the harbour of the nearby town of Motril before being deported, according to local officials.\n\nWhile a huge number of migrants try and get into Spain by setting off from west Africa to the Canary Islands, a far smaller number head north towards Portugal.\n\nAround 140 migrants in seven boats are reported to have landed on the Algarve coast in southern Portugal over the last six years with the majority setting off around 250 miles away from the city of El Jadida, south of Casablanca.\n\nPolice have not yet been able to establish where the latest boat originated from and the report of four people dying during the voyage remains unconfirmed.\n\nBut it has been stated that the oldest person on board the boat which arrived on Friday was 44-years-old.\n\nPaulo Louren\u00e7o who runs a local dolphin watching tourism business said he spotted the migrants\u2019 boat heading for the coast, and followed on his motorbike to film it landing beside the cliffs on Boca do Rio beach.\n\nHe told Observador how some of the migrants seemed relieved and happily yelled \u2018Portugal\u2019 when they realised where they were.\n\nMr Louren\u00e7o said: \u2018I spoke to a family that had a one-year-old child. They said they came from Morocco. They asked me for water and tobacco, and also food. There was a couple on the beach who gave them food.\n\n\u2018They expressed joy at that moment, some were very grateful, with their arms in the air, for having arrived.\u2019\n\nMr Lourne\u00e7o said the migrants had mobile phones, groceries, backpacks with some food and \u2018little else\u2019 with them, and one of women had told him that four people had died during the trip.\n\nHe added: \u2018They arrived at the beach parking lot, sat down and waited for help\u2019.\n\nMajor Il\u00eddio Barreiros, from the Coastal and Border Control Unit of Portugal\u2019s National Republican Guard, said the group had also brought money and had left some groceries, clothes and shoes on their boat.\n\nHe added that there state of health was \u2018representative of the hardship of the journey\u2019, saying: \u2018They were exposed to adverse weather conditions for a considerable period.\u2019\n\nMajor Barreiros appeared to dismiss the possibility that the group had paid a people smuggling network to carry them from Morocco, due to their boat being so small.\n\nHe said: \u2018This phenomenon exists but not in an organisation as informal as this and not in a five-metre vessel.\u2019\n\nMahor Barreiros said the 31 migrants in court on Saturday showed little reaction when they learned through an interpreter that they were being sent home.\n\nHe explained: \u2018When the translator spoke, we expected more emotional reactions. That was not the case. They accepted.\u2019",

      "text": "- Do YOU have a story? Email tips@dailymail.com\nWhen 13 Moroccan men jumped from a speedboat into the sea and ran onto Sotillo beach in the southern Spanish resort of Castell de Ferro, video footage of them arriving seemed pretty unremarkable.\nWhat happened next, however, was extraordinary.\nFor, as the unwelcome visitors from north Africa tried to make a run for it, they were rugby tackled to the ground by ordinary holidaymakers in swimming trunks \u2013 and held until police arrived to arrest them.\nNow the Daily Mail can reveal that the nine men who were detained by irate beach goers were immediately whisked off to a police station before being moved to a notoriously inhospitable secure unit.\nIn stark contrast to how migrants are welcomed to UK shores with four-star hotel stays at taxpayers' expense, the no-nonsense Spanish approach to illegal immigration means the men face being returned to Morocco within a matter of weeks.\nUnlike British arrivals who are free to come and go from their accommodation, the group in Spain are effectively being held behind ten-foot fences surrounded by floodlights and security cameras in the Centre for Migration and Repatriation, known as a CATE, which opened in April this year in the port of the nearby coastal city of Motril.\nThe Daily Mail has also been told that at least some of the bathers who were filmed detaining the men were off duty police officers who were enjoying a quiet Sunday on the beach with their families.\nThe CATE facility replaced an older one which had rows of tents to accommodate seized migrants when many more were crossing the Mediterranean and arriving in southern Spain.\nVideo footage shows 13 Moroccan men jumping from a speedboat into the sea before running onto Sotillo beach\nAs the unwelcome visitors from north Africa tried to make a run for it, they were rugby tackled to the ground by ordinary holidaymakers in swimming trunks\nThey were then held until police arrived to arrest them. The Daily Mail has revealed that the nine men who were detained were whisked off to a police station before being moved to a notoriously inhospitable secure unit\nThe Daily Mail has also been told that at least some of the bathers who were filmed detaining the men were off duty police officers who were enjoying a quiet Sunday on the beach\nPictured: Granada bathers hold back disembarked immigrants on Sotillo beach in Castell de Ferro\nThe no-nonsense Spainish approach to illegal immigration means the men face being returned to Morocco within a matter of weeks\nThe group in Spain are effectively being held behind ten-foot fences surrounded by floodlights and security cameras in the Centre for Migration and Repatriation, known as a CATE\nCATE opened in April this year in the port of the nearby coastal city of Motril\nBut Spain's tougher approach has paid off with the number making the perilous voyage to the Granada area slumping in recent years, meaning that so far only 29 migrants have been housed in the unit since it opened, including the most recent nine.\nThe boat which carried them on Sunday is only the second this year to have reached the 47-mile-long Costa Granadina, known as Costa Tropical, and famed for its glorious beaches.\nJos\u00e9 Antonio Montilla Martos, the Spanish Government's sub-delegate in Granada, confirmed the nine migrants would remain at the CATE 'while their expulsion order from the national territory is processed.'\nTheir return to Morocco means that they will potentially be left thousands of euros out of pocket after paying the people smugglers who transported them on their doomed trip to Europe.\nThe Spanish authorities are known to regard Morocco as a safe country, meaning any asylum applications made by the men are likely to fail unless they can prove they have suffered political persecution or discrimination on LGBT grounds.\nA port worker at Motril who asked not to be named said: 'They deserve to be locked up until theycan be sent home. They are men who we know nothing about, and they should not be allowed to walk around our streets.\nA port worker at Motril who asked not to be named said: 'They deserve to be locked up until they can be sent home. They are men who we know nothing about, and they should not be allowed to walk around our streets.\n'They are being well fed and looked after in the CATE. It is proper that they remain there until they get home. Hopefully, they will tell others that it is a waste of time and money trying to get into Spain illegally.'\nWhen told of the system in the UK where asylum seekers can walk freely around towns and cities while staying in hotels, the worker said: 'That is crazy. They should be kept in a secure place.'\nThe opinion was echoed by locals in Castell de Ferro who witnessed the high-powered boat bringing the migrants ashore at around 1.30pm last Sunday when the beach was full of mainly Spanish families sheltering under umbrellas from the fierce midday sun.\nThe CATE facility (pictured) replaced an older one which had rows of tents to accommodate seized migrants when many more were crossing the Mediterranean and arriving in southern Spain\nSo far only 29 migrants have been housed in the unit since it opened, including the most recent nine. Pictured: The guarded entrance to the port of Motril, Spain\nPictured: The office of the Red Cross next to the CATE secure migrant detention centre which the charity helps to run in the port of Motril, Spain\nShocked witnesses described a 'surreal' scene as the boat approach at high speed, and stopped just a few metres from the shore before the migrants jumped off and swam to dry land.\nAlberto Garcia, who owns the beachfront Mare Nostrum restaurant, told the Daily Mail: 'It was a normal day, and we were providing service as usual when we suddenly saw the smuggling boat arrive and people jumping into the sea.\n'The police arrived quickly on the beach and there were swimmers who helped to catch the people on the boat. I think it is right that they should be detained. My opinion is that they should be deported once they step on Spanish territory illegally.'\nDescribing the scene as the boat arrived, he added: 'We thought it was a recreational boat, but when we saw them starting to throw objects into the water and people getting out, we realised it wasn't normal.\n'What surprised us most was that the boat was moving very slowly, as if they weren't in a hurry or afraid. 'They went in where there were most people, as if nothing had happened, and stopped close to the shore. Then they jumped off one by one, and the four remaining on board, some of them hooded, calmly turned around and left.' Juan\nManuel Peragon, 20, who is a lifeguard on the beach, said: 'I have seen three migrant boats arrive in the four years I have worked here \u2013 but this was the first for a long time.\n'The boat had three big outboard engines so it could go really fast. It stopped around 20m from the shore and around a dozen people jumped off. The boat left again after just ten seconds and was never caught.\n'Unfortunately for the immigrants, they came ashore right beside the police station which is beside the beach.\n'As it was a Sunday, there were a lot of police on a day off who had gone down to the beach at that spot with their families. At least one of the guys who grabbed the men was an off-duty policeman.\n'We ran to help, but police in uniforms quickly arrived and detained everyone. It looks like the immigrants came here to work. They can get jobs on farms growing vegetables because they are prepared to work hard for less money.\n'But they are coming here illegally and there should be a tough system to deal with them and send them back. More needs to be done to tackle the Mafia gangs who operate the boats.'\nHuman resources student Fabiola Escolano, 20, from Granada who was also on the beach said: 'People were running after the men and trying to catch them when they arrived. They did not want them to disappear.\n'Those who were detained were all taken to the Red Cross and are being dealt with in the correct way. There have been boats arriving here before \u2013 but they are not so common now. There were three which arrived at the same time early in the morning on December 21, 2023.'\nPictured: Lifeguard Juan Manuel Peragon, 20, who witnessed migrants storming ashore from a boat at Castell de Ferro, Spain\nFabiola Escolano, 20, who was on the beach at Castell de Ferro when migrants came ashore in a boat\nOthers on the beach felt more pity for the migrants including one filmed lying face down in the sand as he was subdued by a man in orange swimming shorts kneeling on his back.\nOne video clip featured a woman shouting: 'Leave the kid alone! How shameless!' The left leaning El Pais newspaper also criticised members of the public who had tried to detain the men, describing their actions as playing into the hands of the far right who had demonised migrants and others living legitimately in Spain.\nOfficial figures reveal that more than 61,000 illegal migrants or asylum seekers entered Spain last year, slightly more than the previous year, with the majority heading by boat on the highly dangerous route from west Africa to the Canary Islands.\nBut the numbers leaving from Morocco for mainland Spain have fallen, in part due to the Moroccan authorities trying to keep would-be migrants away from coastal areas.\nThere has also been greater security around the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, on the northern coast of Morocco which migrants try and enter to get a foothold in Europe.\nA further deterrent has been a clampdown on people smuggling gangs intent on bringing migrants and drugs into Spain.\nEight Spanish and Moroccan citizens in a 'highly organised network' which had allegedly used children to skipper boats to transport migrants from Morocco were arrested in June this year in Algeciras near Cadiz, Ibiza and Ceuta.\nThe gang is suspected of making about 2.8 million euros from charging more than 200 people 14,000 euros each to make the journey, although other sources suggested that the going rate was closer to 2,000 euros.\nA statement by Europol, the EU's law enforcement agency, said: 'The network used minors as skippers in maritime smuggling operations, often recruited and trained by the organisation itself.\n'This fact not only highlights and amplifies the risk of accidents and fatalities, but also exposes vulnerable youngsters to exploitation and coercion. This practice illustrates the ruthlessness and dehumanising nature of criminal networks which priorities profits over human life.'\nThe gang is also suspected of simultaneously trafficking large amounts of cannabis into Spain.\nAs well as arresting the eight people, authorities seized 22kgs of cannabis, 50,000 euros in cash, five vehicles, two boats, weapons, electronic devices and navigation equipment.\nLast year Spanish police also smashed a ring taking Syrian migrants through Lebanon to Algeria where they crossed the Mediterranean in overcrowded boats before being taken to unsanitary safe houses in Spain.\nBut right wing politicians in Spain demanded even tougher action to protect Spain's borders following the beach landing this week.\nCarlos Rojas Garcia, a former mayor of Motril and a People's Party member of Spain's Congress of Deputies since 2016, called for greater surveillance and security measures 'to decisively combat the gangs that traffic in human beings'\nA view of boats and fishing equipment in the harbour in Motril, Spain, where migrants are held in a secure CATE detention centre\nThe part of the beach at Castell de Ferro where migrants stormed ashore after arriving in a boat from Morocco\nHe said: 'The Spanish government cannot continue to look the other way while mafias operate with impunity on our coasts. 'Images like those seen in Castell de Ferro are sad and worrying; they reflect how there are organisations that take advantage of desperate people who risk everything, even at the risk of losing their lives.'\nThe Granada MP called on the Spanish government to 'urgently strengthen border control, provide more human and material resources for the State Security Forces and Corps, and intensify cooperation with the European Union.'\nAn organisation called Caminando Fronteras said it had recorded the suspected deaths of 1,865 migrants in 38 boats, including 112 women and 342 children, trying to reach Spain by sea from Africa in the first five months of this year.\nThe vast majority of those who died were trying to cross the Atlantic to the Canary Islands although 52 allegedly died while trying to cross the Strait of Gibraltar."

      "text": "Costa del Crisis: Running on to Spanish beaches where Brits bask on holiday, these are just some of the 1,500 migrants who've poured through Europe's new gateway in just one week\n- So far in 2018 23,000 migrants have arrived in Spain hoping to make a new life\n- More than 1,500 have landed close to Algeciras on the Spanish coast in a week\n- The migrants from Africa are taking off from Morocco and paid \u00a31,300 each\nThe promenade lined with palm trees overlooking Campamento port is where Spanish families enjoy a stroll in the cool of evening. They can gaze across the sea at the Rock of Gibraltar and the street lights of Morocco 13 miles away.\nAbove them is the white-walled town of San Roque, where 5,000 Spanish sought sanctuary after Anglo-Dutch forces seized control of Gibraltar in 1704. They fled carrying priceless relics: church records and statuettes dating back to the early 16th century, which are on show to tourists visiting this quiet corner of the Costa Del Sol.\nYet the pace of life is changing fast here. This week at Campamento, not far from the coastal city of Algeciras, a giant camp with orange tents and wood cabins was being given its finishing touches. It is a new reception centre for the thousands of illegal migrants who have sailed from Morocco to Spain on perilous journeys in rickety boats.\nThe camp has come as a complete surprise to many Spanish people. One young man on the prom, watching the tents and cabins being filled with army-style beds, whispered to me: 'This looks like Guantanamo Bay.'\nAnother resident, a slim lady in her 50s, shook her head. 'We want to help these people, but hope they won't stay long.'\nMoroccan migrants disembark from a dinghy at 'Del Canuelo' beach after they crossed the Strait of Gibraltar sailing from the coast of Morocco\nA third, writing on a popular local website, wrote sarcastically: 'A new camp like Calais in France\u2026congratulations!'\nSpain is now the top destination for illegal migrants reaching Europe by sea. So far this year there have been 23,000 arrivals, almost four times more than at the same point last summer, according to the United Nations refugee agency.\nAnd the numbers reaching Spain grow daily. Sailings far outstrip those on the once-favoured route from Libya to Italy, which have fallen by 80 per cent since the interior minister of Italy's Right-wing government ordered a virtual halt to migrant boats entering Italian ports earlier this year.\nMore than 1,500 people have landed along the Spanish coast close to Algeciras since last Friday. In one amazing episode, dozens of migrants were filmed arriving on a beach by boat and racing up the sand a few miles south of the seaside city as shocked sunbathers \u2014 some of them naturists \u2014 looked on.\nEarlier this week, there were so few places for migrants to sleep in Algeciras that many lay wrapped in charity blankets or flattened cardboard boxes on the pavement. Pictures of their plight were beamed around the world as the mayor begged for help.\nJose Ignacio Landaluce said his city had become the 'new Lampedusa' in a reference to an Italian island south of Sicily which has been transformed from a holiday paradise by thousands of illegal migrants who live there in refugee camps after arriving by boat from North Africa.\nHe pleaded: 'I hope the EU is working on a global policy on this: it may be our [Spanish] problem now, but tomorrow, or in a week's time or a month's, it will be at the heart of Europe.'\nHis words ring true. For as I discovered this week in Algeciras, few of the new arrivals speak any Spanish, and they will find it hard to cope with life or find a job. They may simply use Spain as a stepping stone to travel north into France; already some have arrived and then simply disappeared.\nMost of them hail from the French-speaking countries of West Africa \u2014 Guinea, Mali, Niger, Cameroon and Chad. And the fact that Spain has high unemployment, with one young person in three out of work, means finding a job in the country will be a struggle at best.\nAll this does not bode well, for it is when large numbers of young men find themselves at a loose end for weeks that social problems can unfold.\nMembers of the NGO talking to rescued migrants aboard the French NGO's ship Aquarius, in the search and rescue zone in the Mediterranean sea.\nThe arriving migrants have been put in temporary accommodation: police stations, hostels and sports centres, where \u2014 as officials and charity workers struggle to cope \u2014 each one is given a bed, regular meals, free medical care and a foreigner's certificate allowing them to travel freely inside the country.\nNeedless to say, in the faraway tea-houses of impoverished West and North Africa, news of such largesse has got round fast. Spanish police this week estimated that 50,000 migrants from that part of the Third World now wait in Morocco, hoping to sail to Spain.\nThey are helped by people-trafficking gangs \u2014 often run by Moroccans \u2014 which charge migrants \u00a31,300 each for a place on a small boat, or sell a group of them a rubber dinghy with paddles for an extortionate \u00a3500.\nMigrants are seen on a dinghy as they cross the Strait of Gibraltar sailing from the coast of Morocco\nThey are pushed off by the traffickers at night, in flotillas, from beaches along a 250-mile stretch of the Moroccan coast between the cities of Tangier and Nador. It is risky for the migrants, and hundreds have drowned already this year.\nHowever, refugee charities in Morocco regularly tip off the Spanish coastguards when a flotilla is about to sail. This means there is a rescue boat waiting in international waters (12 miles off the coast) to take the migrants on board and bring them safely into a Spanish port.\nUnder controversial EU rules, Spain, as a nearby country, also has a duty to help any vessel leaving Morocco that sounds a distress SOS signal. Migrants even send directions on social media via their mobile phones to alert the coastguards to their exact location at sea.\nCaptain Miguel Parcha, skipper of a coastguard vessel operating on the Costa Del Sol, told me: 'The migrants know we will rescue them when they set off. That is a fact. We do our work because otherwise they will die.'\nThe crisis in Spain has been heightened by events in May when a French-run charity vessel, Aquarius, was prevented by the new Italian government from bringing 630 migrants ashore, amid accusations that such foreign-flagged ships were acting as a taxi service for migrants and helped fuel the wicked trade of the traffickers.\nMigrants entering Spain from Morocco are sent to the migration camps where they are registered\nThe orange tents are set up to house those who arrive in Spain as migrants. Many hope to gain asylum status\nNext, Malta also refused to take the migrants. But Spain's new Left-wing government stepped into the breach and welcomed the ship as an act of humanity.\nIt arrived in the port of Valencia four days later, while politicians in Madrid told European leaders to stop playing 'ostrich' politics over the huge issue of illegal arrivals in Europe.\nThis week, Spain had not changed its tune. Josep Borrell, the foreign minister, denied the country was experiencing 'mass' immigration and said Europe needed 'new blood' to compensate for a low birth rate.\nThe Government is aiming to invest \u00a326 million in an emergency plan for migrants, to reflect the fact that Spain is now the main destination for newcomers from Africa.\nAll this was good news for the migrants I met in Algeciras sitting outside the Casa Blanca cafe, near the port, before they took a walk on the city's beach.\nThe four, from Guinea, arrived in the tourist resort of Malaga, an hour's drive away, on the afternoon of Sunday, July 22, in a coastguard boat. They had been rescued from a flotilla of small craft that had set sail the night before from a beach in Nador, Morocco.\nOnce in Spain, they were driven by coach to Algeciras, where they were given a room each in the Pension Zagora in a narrow side street, paid for by the Spanish government.\nEvery day they can have three meals \u2014 also free \u2014 at the Casa Blanca cafe. Meanwhile, each has been given a registration document by the local social security office, certifying their arrival in Spain, their name, nationality and date of birth. It means they can travel anywhere in Spain while their rights to asylum are assessed.\nIt seems likely that Souleymane Diop, one of the quartet, will be lucky. The 20-year-old is a handsome boy with a wide smile and pearly teeth, dressed in a white charity T-shirt given to him by the Spanish Red Cross.\nHe says he is gay, which means he has a good chance of claiming asylum in Spain under EU human rights laws.\nHis claims his sexuality is why he left the home of his mother, a nurse, in Conakry, Guinea. 'They don't like men like me in my country. They kill us,' he says simply. 'My life was in danger and my family's, too. I have no father that I know of, so I could not do that to my mother.'\nSouleymane was in a small rubber boat for hours before he was rescued by the Spanish coastguard. It was another four hours before he reached Spain. 'I had been in Morocco for months waiting to get on a boat,' he explains. 'I had travelled from Guinea through Mali, Algeria and Morocco.\nMigrants Chief Souare, Souleymare Diop,Mohammed Keita, and Karim Kourama all from Guinea in West Africa\nFrom Morocco to Spain: This is the inside of the camps the migrants are sent to when they arrive - if they are caught\n'I was so relieved to arrive. Now, I want to stay in Spain because I am good at languages. I want to work in IT and get a training. The days are long here, but I am grateful to this country.'\nSouleymane is agnostic, unlike his Muslim friends Karim Kourama, 19, Souare Hadre, 25, and Mohammed Keita, 20. They spend their time playing on their mobile phones and sleeping. 'We can tell you where the best beach is,' laughs Souleymane.\nHe met Karim on the coastguard boat, and the two chatter together about what the future holds. Karim wants to go to England, where his uncle, Matiti Camara, has been living for eight years, working as a translator in Sunderland. Matiti arrived in Britain legally with a work visa, then returned to impoverished Guinea, where he married Marie and brought her back to live in the North-East, where they have four children.\nKarim, the son of a police officer, shows me pictures of Marie on Facebook and photos of three of the children on what he says was a trip to London.\n'I hope Spain will let me go to England. I hope England will have me,' he says, with Souleymane translating. 'I know it is cold there, but I have family so that is a start.'\nOf course, these young men are full of dreams. They are still very excited to get to Europe. They seem to have no inkling that there are many thousands like them with few qualifications and language problems who are already in Spain, with the same high hopes but a precarious future.\nBack at the newly built camp at Campamento port, a police officer showed me round, pointing out the bunk beds where 600 newly arrived migrants will sleep.\n'The first will be here by coach tonight or tomorrow,' he tells me. 'They will have a medical check first. We will also do DNA tests to make sure families are really families, and that there are no children or women being trafficked among them.\n'Those who claim to be children but look like adults will have tests on their bones to see if they are telling the truth. Only after several days will the migrants whose checks are clear be allowed to leave here to begin their life in Spain.'\nIt all sounds fine on paper. But what has this liberal country taken on?\nThe other day, the new leader of Spain's conservative opposition Popular Party, Pablo Casado, said the Left-wing government must change direction over its open-door policy, otherwise 'millions' more would arrive from Africa.\n(l to r) Mohammed Keita, Souleymare Diop , Chief Souare,and Karim Kourama in Spain where they hope to remain\nHe said it was not possible for every migrant to be allowed to live in Spain. 'Nor is it sustainable that a welfare state can absorb millions who want to come to Europe. We have to say it, even though it is politically incorrect.'\nYet his words are unlikely to be heeded by those who hold political sway in Spain. And the same goes for the concerns of ordinary Spaniards who fear trouble ahead.\nOn a local internet discussion forum discussing the influx to Algeciras, one man calling himself Miguel wrote this week: 'The other day I went to Tangier, where, near the central bullring, there are thousands and thousands of people waiting to be able to ride a boat [to Spain]. They even know they will be rescued by Spain and will then be Europeans.\n'Madness. This is only the beginning. It has to end.'\nThis week it was clear that many here in Spain believe the same.\nMost watched News videos\n- Moment passengers 'stop' man who pulled down trousers on tube\n- Shocking moment man is gored to death after charging at bull\n- Moment Cycling Mikey pushes bike into a car after furious row\n- Shocking moment woman strikes flight attendant before being removed\n- Chinese Navy ship collides with own vessel while chasing boat\n- Florida man knocks out kayakers while attempting a DAREDEVIL leap\n- Chinese navy vessel collides with one of its own chasing Philippine boat\n- Father of children mowed down in Oatlands tragedy confronts killer\n- Tragic British rider Sarah Yorke seen jumping fences during training\n- Hawaii ferry is tossed by strong waves before being run aground\n- Nat Barr's tough message to Albo after recognising Palestine state\n- Family-friendly restaurant Cracker Barrel unveils bold new look"

One woman walking into a restaurant said: 'People are struggling with their mortgage and they are complaining about having to stay rent free in a hotel. It really beggars belief.'\nA group of asylum seekers are camped outside the Comfort Inn in Westminster to protest about the conditions inside\nThis morning, around 20 people remained outside the hotel, with pictures showing suitcases and blankets strewn across the pavement\nA view of the scene outside the Comfort Inn hotel in Pimlico this afternoon\nToday, most of the group dozed in the afternoon sunshine or sat smoking or talking on their iPhones as four police officers kept watch.\nSuitcases and other possessions blocked the pavement just yards from \u00a32m homes in Pimlico, one of London's most fashionable areas\nHoteliers also expressed dismay at the protest with one saying he has had several cancellations. Hotels in the area are expecting to be full with tourists given the location to the main sights in London.\nThe protest began two days ago after the Home Office moved the migrants from a hotel in Ilford, Essex, to the Comfort Inn.\nWhile they were allocated a room each at their previous hotel the budget option in London meant they had to share four to room. They also complained that the hotel was 'smelly' and they had no privacy.\nA man in his 20s, was from the Sudan, said the conditions were 'not human.'\n'There are four of us in a room and we have to sleep on bunk beds. There isn't even room to turn around once our suitcases are in the room.\n'The toilet is smelly because there are four people using it and it does not get cleaned.'\nThe migrant, who said he has been in the UK for 18 months waiting for his asylum application to be reviewed, vowed that the pavement protest would continue until they are moved to a new hotel.\nHe said he had been smuggled into the UK hidden in a lorry while many others had crossed the Channel in a dinghy.\nAnother migrant, an Iranian, added:' The rooms are like a cage. It makes us feel like we are back in a prison. The previous hotel meant we had some privacy, but it is not right that we have to share four to a room and sleep on a bunk bed.'\nOther migrants refused to speak or claimed they did not speak English.\nThe men are from Sudan, Somalia, Eritrea, Afghanistan, Iran and Kurdistan.\nTwo people - one wearing a trans rights T-shirt \u2013 handed out wet wipes for the men to wash their faces.\nAnother who said he supported the migrants told them to hide their faces from a photographer.\nThe group had previously stacked their suitcases outside the entrance to the hotel to stop people leaving, but that had been removed to allow police and Home Office officials to come and go.\nRough sleeping teams have been supporting the asylum seekers, according to the council, which claimed the Home Office had not put forward any resolution to the matter\nBedsheets, clothes and holdalls on the pavement outside the central London hotel today\nPolice officers at the scene of the protest outside the hotel today\nThe Comfort Inn is currently closed to paying guests but usually charges around \u00a3150 a night for what it describes as 'good value accommodation'\nA bathroom inside the Comfort Inn. There have been complaints the toilets are 'smelly'\nA kitchen area inside the hotel, which has received mixed reviews on TripAdvisor\nOne of the protesters, a 27-year-old Iranian, told the Telegraph: 'Two square metres is not enough for sleeping four people. And when you go to the toilet, the smell damages you.'\nAnother Iranian, who is 21 and had also crossed the Channel, said the Comfort Inn had looked 'nice' on Google maps but 'when you get in, it's like a jail'... 'they treat you like an animal'.\nMeanwhile, a 26-year-old from east Africa who crossed the Channel in a small boat said they had been given private rooms at another hotel in Ilford, Essex. He said: 'We need a private room. How do you live with four men?'\nIn a letter to the Home Secretary, the leader of Westminster City Council expressed his 'deep concern' that around 40 refugees were placed in the borough on Wednesday night 'without appropriate accommodation or support available' and no prior communication with the local authority.\nAdam Hug complained that asking people who 'are likely to have been through significant and traumatic events' to share 'an inappropriately-sized room with multiple strangers defies common sense and basic decency'.\nHe said the Government's demand created 'safeguarding and health risks', and noted that 'leaving them on the street for multiple nights is not an alternative'.\nRough sleeping teams have been supporting the asylum seekers, according to the council, which claimed the Home Office had not put forward any resolution to the matter.\nThe asylum seekers, who are from Iraq, Iran, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and Bangladesh, have put up posters at the hotel entrance and on traffic lights reading 'help us' and 'this is a prison, not a hotel'.\nThe Comfort Inn is currently closed to paying guests but usually charges around \u00a3150 a night for what it describes as 'good value accommodation'.\nThe guesthouse is rated three stars on TripAdvisor but the last eight reviews have all been one star.\nThe asylum seekers, who are from Iraq, Iran, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and Bangladesh, have put up posters at the hotel entrance and on traffic lights reading 'help us' and 'this is a prison, not a hotel'\nThe Comfort Inn is currently closed to paying guests but usually charges around \u00a3150 a night for what it describes as 'good value accommodation'\nThe group complain that instead of the ensuite single rooms they had at a guesthouse in Essex they are now being forced into singles with two bunk beds and a 'smelly toilet'\nAnother reviewer, who stayed in March 2023, wrote: 'Just really really grim. One of the smallest rooms I have ever had the misfortune to stay in (literally 30cm wider than the double bed in it) with a bathroom literally in a cupboard (you have to admire the audacity to even try and fit a toilet and shower in that space).'\nA second called it a 'hotel from hell' and complained of the 'horrendous conditions' inside their room, while others called it a 'dump' and warned 'avoid at all costs'.\nThe Home Office is currently housing 50,000 asylum seekers in hotels and officials are desperate to find ways to reduce the estimated \u00a36million a day bill.\nMinisters are believed to be advocating the increased use of shared rooms over concerns smuggling gangs are trying to lure migrants with the promise of 'luxury' accommodation.\nAsylum seekers in hotels are allowed to come and go and receive \u00a39.10 a week to cover any costs beyond bed and board, which is already paid for.\nA Home Office spokesperson said: 'Despite the number of people arriving in the UK reaching record levels, we continue to provide accommodation - at a cost of \u00a36million a day - for asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute to meet our legal obligation.\n'The accommodation offered to asylum seekers by providers, on a no choice basis, is of a decent standard and meets all legal and contractual requirements.'\nMailOnline has contacted the hotel for comment.\nMost watched News videos\n- Moment passengers 'stop' man who pulled down trousers on tube\n- Shocking moment man is gored to death after charging at bull\n- Moment Cycling Mikey pushes bike into a car after furious row\n- Shocking moment woman strikes flight attendant before being removed\n- Chinese Navy ship collides with own vessel while chasing boat\n- Florida man knocks out kayakers while attempting a DAREDEVIL leap\n- Chinese navy vessel collides with one of its own chasing Philippine boat\n- Father of children mowed down in Oatlands tragedy confronts killer\n- Tragic British rider Sarah Yorke seen jumping fences during training\n- Hawaii ferry is tossed by strong waves before being run aground\n- Nat Barr's tough message to Albo after recognising Palestine state\n- Family-friendly restaurant Cracker Barrel unveils bold new look"

  "argos_summary": "A group of 38 migrants, including men, women, and children, arrived on a beach in the Algarve, Portugal, after a dangerous journey from Morocco. They were quickly apprehended by Portuguese authorities and face deportation back to Morocco within weeks, as Portugal enforces strict immigration policies. The migrants received temporary shelter and basic necessities but have not claimed asylum, as Portugal considers Morocco a safe country. This situation contrasts sharply with the treatment of migrants in the UK, where they often receive more lenient accommodations.",
