  "title": "Think Linux desktop market share isn't over 6%? This 15 million-system scan says otherwise",
  "description": "Lansweeper analyzed millions of consumer desktop OSes using both agentless and agent-based scanning techniques. Here's what it found.",
  "content": "In an interview, Lansweeper, an IT asset discovery and inventory company, revealed to ZDNET that, in its analysis of over 15 million identified consumer desktop operating systems, it found that Linux desktops currently account for just over 6% of PC market share.\n\nThis news comes after several other studies have shown the Linux desktop is right around the 6% mark. Indeed, according to the US Federal Government Website and App Analytics count, the Linux desktop market share over the last 90 days has reached 6.3%, a new high. In July, according to StatCounter, the Linux desktop also set a record high by its metrics with 5.24%.\n\nAlso: 5 Linux distros I recommend to help businesses cut costs and boost security\n\nLansweeper's data, according to CTO Guido Patanella, comes from its agents and scanning of 15 million consumer systems and 3.5 million corporate systems. The company defines consumer PCs as computers that are workgroup-based, standalone, or bring-your-own-device. Business computers are those managed by Windows Active Directory (AD). In other words, when you see \"consumer,\" don't think of the laptop in your bedroom that you use for gaming but work machines that aren't hooked into AD.\n\nInterestingly, business Linux usage currently stands at 1.9%, which is significantly lower than usage on consumer PCs. Contrary to popular belief, Linux desktops can be managed by AD. For example, Ubuntu 24.04 with Ubuntu Pro includes an AD Group Policy client.\n\nLinux usage on AD-managed networks is showing gradual but consistent growth, increasing from around 1.6% in January 2025 to 1.9% in June 2025. New devices, however -- defined as assets that appeared for the first time after March 1, 2025 -- have a greater tendency to run Linux. The research suggests 2.5% of these newer machines run Linux.\n\nAlso: 5 command line backup tools every Linux user should use for desktops and servers\n\nExamining the Linux desktop by business type revealed that industries such as business services, consumer and retail, and government show significantly higher Linux adoption in Europe compared to North America. Given the recent shift by European governments from Windows to Linux, this trend isn't surprising.\n\nIn North America, industries such as technology and telecommunications and finance and insurance show significantly higher Linux adoption compared to Europe. To sum up, in North America, technology is the top industry adopter of Linux, while business services leads the way in Europe.\n\nAlso: These 6 Linux apps are the secret sauce to my creative process\n\nWhen viewed through the lens of company size, Linux adoption is higher in small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in North America than in Europe. In contrast, Linux adoption is higher in European SMBs.\n\nThe company collects this data for its customers on PCs using a combination of agentless and agent-based techniques, plus active and passive network scanning. These methods are:\n\u2022 Agentless Scanning: Lansweeper utilizes protocols such as Windows Management Instrumentation, Secure Shell, and Simple Network Management Protocol to remotely gather hardware, software, and configuration details from PCs and servers on the network without requiring software agents on individual PCs.\n\u2022 Agent-Based Scanning: For devices not always connected to the network (such as roaming laptops or off-site devices), a lightweight agent, such as LsAgent, is installed. This agent scans the computer locally and then sends the results back to the Lansweeper server.\n\u2022 Active Scanning: Direct probes are sent to targets using an IP range, Active Directory, or specific credential sets to discover devices and extract detailed information such as hardware specs, installed software, OS versions, and network configuration.\n\u2022 Passive Scanning (Asset Radar and Credential-Free Recognition): Lansweeper can monitor network traffic to detect devices as they connect. With this method, Lansweeper can identify PCs that lack valid credentials or are unmanaged or unknown. This method -- Credential-Free Device Recognition -- collects basic metadata, including MAC and IP addresses, device type, and specific network characteristics.\n\u2022 Hybrid Approach: Best practices recommend combining passive discovery for coverage and real-time detection with credentialed active or agent-based scanning for enhanced information depth.\n\nThere are several reasons why Linux is finally gaining popularity. One I haven't looked at recently but deserves mention is the rise of AI programming. Linux has become the default operating system for AI and machine learning workloads due to the prevalence of leading AI open-source frameworks, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face Transformers, and OpenAI's new open-weight models.\n\nAlso: How to check for bad blocks on a Linux PC hard drive (and why you shouldn't wait to do it)\n\nWill the Linux desktop ever become as mainstream as, say, MacOS? Probably not. Has it become a significant desktop player for power users and developers? The numbers say yes.\n\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter.",

      "text": "Apple quietly makes running Linux containers easier on Macs\nWith so much news at 2025's Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, you might be excused for missing that Apple quietly revealed it was releasing and open-sourcing a new open-source containerization framework and a shell tool called Container. Both are designed to create and run Linux containers as lightweight virtual machines (VMs) directly on MacOS.\nAlso: ZDNET's WWDC 2025 recap with Sabrina Ortiz and Jason Hiner\nThis framework is optimized for Apple Silicon and will be natively integrated into the forthcoming MacOS 26 (Tahoe). You can, of course, already run Linux in containers with such third-party container tools as Docker, Podman, and Orbstack. You can also easily run Linux on your older Intel-powered Mac or, with more effort, run Asahi Linux on M-powered Macs.\nApple Container is written in Swift and licensed under Apache 2. Apple claims these \"Containers achieve sub-second start times using an optimized Linux kernel configuration and a minimal root filesystem with a lightweight init system.\" You'll need a minimum of any Mac with Apple Silicon inside, MacOS 15, and Xcode 26 beta. These containers are compliant with the Open Container Initiative.\nAlso: Why Denmark is dumping Microsoft Office and Windows for LibreOffice and Linux\nThe framework uses a custom init system called vminitd, also written in Swift, to manage process launching, filesystem mounting, and host-container communication.\nUnlike other container approaches, which run multiple containers in a single, often resource-heavy Linux VM, Apple's container framework spins up a separate lightweight VM for each container. These VMs are based on Kata Containers, a well-known and well-regarded OpenInfra Foundation project.\nEach container gets its own isolated Linux kernel environment, enhancing security and privacy. The minimal root filesystem excludes most core utilities and dynamic libraries, reducing the attack surface and maintenance overhead.\nEvery container can also be assigned a dedicated IP address, removing the need for port forwarding and improving network isolation. However, if you try running Container in the current MacOS 15, Sequoia, you can only create the container network with the first container that starts.\nAlso: How Red Hat just quietly, radically transformed enterprise server Linux\nSince the network XPC, Apple's basic interprocess communication helper, provides IP addresses to containers, and the helper has to start before the first container, the network helper and vmnet can disagree on the subnet address, resulting in containers that are completely cut off from the network. In short, this is bad news.\nHowever, this issue will be fixed by the time Tahoe, which is currently in developer beta, ships. For now, though, if you're trying to run the containers in MacOS 15, you can expect some problems.\nYou may be asking yourself, \"Why is Apple taking this approach?\" Well, the strategy will help developers working on Linux projects, so there must be a demand for it.\nAlso: Java at 30: How a language designed for a failed gadget became a global powerhouse\nApple's move tacitly acknowledges the central role of Linux containers in modern software development by providing a seamless, high-performance, and secure experience for Mac-using Linux developers. Which, come to think of it, is much like what Microsoft did for Windows-based Linux developers with its Windows Subsystem for Linux.\nBy offering native, open-source tools, Apple is positioning MacOS as a first-class platform for container-based development, optimized for its own hardware and developer ecosystem."

      "text": "Open source is actually the cradle of artificial intelligence. Here's why\nIn a way, open source and artificial intelligence were born together.\nBack in 1971, if you'd mentioned AI to most people, they might have thought of Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. However, AI was already a real subject that year at MIT, where Richard M. Stallman (RMS) joined MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab.\nYears later, as proprietary software sprang up, RMS developed the radical idea of Free Software. Decades later, this concept, transformed into open source, would become the birthplace of modern AI.\nIt wasn't a science-fiction writer but a computer scientist, Alan Turing, who started the modern AI movement. Turing's 1950 paper Computing Machine and Intelligence originated the Turing Test. The test, in brief, states that if a machine can fool you into thinking that you're talking with a human being, it's intelligent.\nAccording to some people, today's AIs can already do this. I don't agree, but we're clearly on our way.\nAlso: The best AI chatbots: ChatGPT and alternatives\nIn 1960, computer scientist John McCarthy coined the term \"artificial intelligence\" and, along the way, created the Lisp language. McCarthy's achievement, as computer scientist Paul Graham put it, \"did for programming something like what Euclid did for geometry. He showed how, given a handful of simple operators and a notation for functions, you can build a whole programming language.\"\nLisp, in which data and code are mixed, became AI's first language. It was also RMS's first programming love.\nSo, why didn't we have a GNU-ChatGPT in the 1980s? There are many theories. The one I prefer is that early AI had the right ideas in the wrong decade. The hardware wasn't up to the challenge. Other essential elements -- like Big Data -- weren't yet available to help real AI get underway. Open-source projects such as Hdoop, Spark, and Cassandra provided the tools that AI and machine learning needed for storing and processing large amounts of data on clusters of machines. Without this data and quick access to it, Large Language Models (LLMs) couldn't work.\nAlso: My two favorite ChatGPT Plus plugins and the remarkable things I can do with them\nToday, even Bill Gates -- no fan of open source -- admits that open-source-based AI is the biggest thing since he was introduced to the idea of a graphical user interface (GUI) in 1980. From that GUI idea, you may recall, Gates built a little program called Windows.\nIn particular, today's wildly popular AI generative models, such as ChatGPT and Llama 2, sprang from open-source origins. That's not to say ChatGPT, Llama 2, or DALL-E are open source. They're not.\nOh, they were supposed to be. As Elon Musk, an early OpenAI investor, said: \"OpenAI was created as an open source (which is why I named it \"Open\" AI), non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft. Not what I intended at all.\"\nAlso: The best AI image generators to try\nBe that as it may, OpenAI and all the other generative AI programs are built on open-source foundations. In particular, Hugging Face's Transformer is the top open-source library for building today's machine learning (ML) models. Funny name and all, it provides pre-trained models, architectures, and tools for natural language processing tasks. This enables developers to build upon existing models and fine-tune them for specific use cases. In particular, ChatGPT relies on Hugging Face's library for its GPT LLMs. Without Transformer, there's no ChatGPT.\nIn addition, TensorFlow and PyTorch, developed by Google and Facebook, respectively, fueled ChatGPT. These Python frameworks provide essential tools and libraries for building and training deep learning models. Needless to say, other open-source AI/ML programs are built on top of them. For example, Keras, a high-level TensorFlow API, is often used by developers without deep learning backgrounds to build neural networks.\nAlso: Want to build your own AI chatbot? Say hello to open-source HuggingChat\nYou can argue until you're blue in the face as to which one is better -- and AI programmers do -- but both TensorFlow and PyTorch are used in multiple projects. Behind the scenes of your favorite AI chatbot is a mix of different open-source projects.\nSome top-level programs, such as Meta's Llama-2, claim that they're open source. They're not. Although many open-source programmers have turned to Llama because it's about as open-source friendly as any of the large AI programs, when push comes to shove, Llama-2 isn't open source. True, you can download it and use it. With model weights and starting code for the pre-trained model and conversational fine-tuned versions, it's easy to build Llama-powered applications. There's only one tiny problem buried in the licensing: If your program is wildly successful and you have\ngreater than 700 million monthly active users in the preceding calendar month, you must request a license from Meta, which Meta may grant to you in its sole discretion, and you are not authorized to exercise any of the rights under this Agreement unless or until Meta otherwise expressly grants you such rights.\nYou can give up any dreams you might have of becoming a billionaire by writing Virtual Girl/Boy Friend based on Llama. Mark Zuckerberg will thank you for helping him to another few billion.\nAlso: AI is a lot like streaming. The add-ons add up fast\nNow, there do exist some true open-source LLMs -- such as Falcon180B. However, nearly all the major commercial LLMs aren't properly open source. Mind you, all the major LLMs were trained on open data. For instance, GPT-4 and most other large LLMs get some of their data from CommonCrawl, a text archive that contains petabytes of data crawled from the web. If you've written something on a public site -- a birthday wish on Facebook, a Reddit comment on Linux, a Wikipedia mention, or a book on Archives.org -- if it was written in HTML, chances are your data is in there somewhere.\nSo, is open source doomed to be always a bridesmaid, never a bride in the AI business? Not so fast.\nIn a leaked internal Google document, a Google AI engineer wrote, \"The uncomfortable truth is, we aren't positioned to win this [Generative AI] arms race, and neither is OpenAI. While we've been squabbling, a third faction has been quietly eating our lunch.\"\nThat third player? The open-source community.\nAs it turns out, you don't need hyperscale clouds or thousands of high-end GPUs to get useful answers out of generative AI. In fact, you can run LLMs on a smartphone: People are running foundation models on a Pixel 6 at five LLM tokens per second. You can also finetune a personalized AI on your laptop in an evening. When you can \"personalize a language model in a few hours on consumer hardware,\" the engineer noted, \"[it's] a big deal.\" That's for sure.\nAlso: The ethics of generative AI: How we can harness this powerful technology\nThanks to fine-tuning mechanisms, such as the Hugging Face open-source low-rank adaptation (LoRA), you can perform model fine-tuning for a fraction of the cost and time of other methods. How much of a fraction? How does personalizing a language model in a few hours on consumer hardware sound to you?\nThe Google developer added:\n\"Part of what makes LoRA so effective is that -- like other forms of fine-tuning -- it's stackable. Improvements like instruction tuning can be applied and then leveraged as other contributors add on dialogue, or reasoning, or tool use. While the individual fine tunings are low rank, their sum need not be, allowing full-rank updates to the model to accumulate over time. This means that as new and better datasets and tasks become available, the model can be cheaply kept up to date without ever having to pay the cost of a full run.\"\nOur mystery programmer concluded, \"Directly competing with open source is a losing proposition.\u2026 We should not expect to be able to catch up. The modern internet runs on open source for a reason. Open source has some significant advantages that we cannot replicate.\"\nAlso: Extending ChatGPT: Can AI chatbot plugins really change the game?\nThirty years ago, no one dreamed that an open-source operating system could ever usurp proprietary systems like Unix and Windows. Perhaps it will take a lot less than three decades for a truly open, soup-to-nuts AI program to overwhelm the semi-proprietary programs we're using today."

Back when drives consisted of spinning, magnetic platters, that dreaded \"tick\" was a sure sign a hard drive was failing. Once upon a nightmare scenario, I waited too late and wound up losing everything on my drive. Sure, I could have recovered that data, but at a pretty high monetary cost.\nAlso: The first 5 Linux commands every new user should learn\nSince then, I've always been vigilant about checking for bad blocks and sectors on hard drives.\nWhat is a bad block?\nSimply put, a bad block is one that cannot be read or written to. This can happen because of physical damage to the drive or failing transistors on flash memory (think SSDs). When a block goes bad, it's not usable. Too many bad blocks, and the drive will fail.\nYou don't want that.\nAlso: Thinking about switching to Linux? 10 things you need to know\nBefore the bad blocks take you down, you should check for them. If you don't, you could lose out. Let's check.\nHow to check for bad blocks on an older drive\nWhat you'll need: The only things you'll need for this are a running instance of Linux and a user with sudo privileges.\n1. Locate the name of your drive\nThe first thing to do is locate the name of your drive and partition. To do that, you'll need to use the fdisk utility with the command:\nsudo fdisk -l\nFrom the output of that, you should see the name of the drive you need to scan. The name will most likely be in the form of /dev/sda1.\n2. Scan for bad blocks\nNow it's time to scan for those blocks. The tool you'll use for this is aptly named badblocks and is installed on most Linux distributions (so you don't have to install anything). Let's say your drive name is /dev/sda1. To scan for bad blocks, the command would be:\nsudo badblocks -v /dev/sda1 > badblocks.txt\nThe above command outputs the results of the command to the file badblocks.txt. You'll also see the output of the command in the terminal window.\nAlso: There's a new coolest Linux distribution ready to wow you\n3. Mark bad blocks as unusable\nIf badblocks report that there are, in fact, bad blocks on your drive, you'll want to mark them as unusable. If your OS attempts to use a bad block or sector, it could cause problems, and this avoids that.\nAlso: The best Linux distros for beginners\nTo do that, we'll employ the file created by badblocks and use the e2fsck command. This only works on the ext2, ext3, and ext4 filesystem types. The command used for this (sticking with the example name we've been using) would be:\nsudo e2fsck -l badblocks.txt /dev/sda1\nIf your file system is of a different type, you'll use the fsck command like so:\nsudo fsck -l badblocks.txt /dev/sda1\nHow to check for bad blocks on a modern drive\nThe good news is that you don't have to mark bad blocks on an SSD, but it's good to regularly check the health of the drive.\nIf your system uses an SSD, you'll need to use a tool called smartmontools. Chances are that this application isn't installed on your system.\n1. Install smartmontools\nTo install smartmontools on a Debian/Ubuntu-based distribution, issue the command:\nsudo apt-get install smartmontools -y\nAlso: 6 reasons why I've stuck with Ubuntu-based Linux distros for the last 20 years\nOn Fedora-based distributions, that command would be:\nsudo dnf install smartmontools -y\n2.

      "text": "For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide\nWhen you set up a Windows PC for the first time, you're required to create a user account that allows you to act as the administrator for that computer. Depending on your Windows edition and network setup, you have a choice of up to four separate account types.\nAlso: How to upgrade your 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11\nThe key phrase there is \"up to four account types.\" Your actual choices might be more limited. You might have only two choices, and even then you might need to jump through some hoops to choose anything other than a Microsoft account. To get started, let's talk about your Windows edition.\nWhich Windows edition are you running?\nOn business editions of Windows (Pro, Pro for Workstations, Enterprise, and Education), the Windows Setup program asks you to choose whether you want to set the PC up for personal use or for use on a network managed by your organization, as shown below. If you choose the second option, you can set up the PC using an account that your organization set up for you, but you'll need the help of a network administrator to continue.\nOn Windows Home edition, the option to set up for an organization isn't available, and you're limited to only the two personal options: a local account or a Microsoft account. The exact same choices are available if you're running a business edition of Windows and choose the \"Set up for personal use\" option.\nAlso: How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and bypass Microsoft's restrictions)\nEven that choice isn't easy to exercise, at least not at first. The Setup program is extremely persistent about coaxing you into signing in with a Microsoft account. Current versions of Windows 11, in fact, offer only the option to use a Microsoft account, although you can work around this restriction with some tricks I explain later in this post. You can also install a Microsoft account as the primary account and then add a local account (or remove the connection to the Microsoft account) after you've signed in for the first time.\nLet's look at the pros and cons of each account type. Even if your natural instinct is to say no to an account managed by Microsoft, you should consider that option. You might even find that combining two account types is best of all.\nMicrosoft account\nThis is Microsoft's free online account for personal use, required for signing into the company's consumer services, including OneDrive, Xbox Live, Skype, and Microsoft 365 Family and Personal subscriptions.\nAlso: Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year\nIf you have an email account at Outlook.com or Hotmail.com (or, for old-timers, at live.com or msn.com), you already have a Microsoft account. You can also sign up for a new account anytime, choosing a new address at Outlook.com or Hotmail.com or using your own email address.\nSigning in to your Windows PC with a Microsoft account offers several distinct benefits:\n- On PCs designed for Windows 10 or Windows 11, signing in with a Microsoft account automatically enables full-disk encryption for the system drive, even on systems running Home edition. Your recovery key is stored in OneDrive, allowing you to access your data if you find yourself locked out. On Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions, you can turn on BitLocker encryption for secondary drives and removable storage devices like flash drives.\n- Signing in with a Microsoft account stores a record of your successful activation, allowing you to easily restore your activation (no product key required) if you have to reinstall Windows after making significant hardware changes.\n- Windows allows you to back up and sync settings between PCs where you sign in using the same Microsoft account. That includes personalization settings like your desktop background, saved passwords (including Wi-Fi profiles), language and regional settings, and more. (For a full list, see \"Windows 10 roaming settings reference.\")\n- You can sign in automatically to any Microsoft consumer service using your saved Microsoft Account credentials.\nOne objection I hear regularly to the use of Microsoft accounts involves privacy. However, the amount of data that's tied to a Microsoft account is extremely limited and is mainly associated with subscription services that aren't on unless you choose to use them. What about Windows telemetry data? That's tied to your device and isn't associated with your Windows account. (For more details on how telemetry works, see \"Windows 10 telemetry secrets: Where, when, and why Microsoft collects your data.\")\nAlso: The best Windows laptop models right now\nThe least invasive way to use a Microsoft account is to choose the option to create a new Microsoft account during setup and then use that account exclusively for signing in to Windows while keeping your email, cloud storage, and other services elsewhere. But if you do use a Microsoft account for services such as Microsoft 365 and OneDrive, it makes sense to sign in to Windows using the same account.\nLocal account\nA local account is about as old school as Windows gets. You don't need a network connection or an email address; instead, you create a username (up to 20 characters) and a password, both of which are stored on the PC where you create them. Those credentials grant access only to the device on which you created them.\nAlso: This hidden Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much more quickly\nThere's no particular security or privacy advantage to signing in with a local account (indeed, the lack of device encryption is a negative, in my book); but if that's your preference, you can do so when you set up Windows on a new PC.\nWindows 11 Home requires you to sign in with a Microsoft account during initial setup. Beginning with version 22H2, so does Windows 11 Pro when you choose the option to set it up for personal use. You can work around this restriction by entering the address no@thankyou.com as your Microsoft account. When you're asked for a password, enter anything. Windows will inform you that the account has been locked because of too many incorrect password attempts (you're not the first person to do this, after all), and you'll be given the option to create a local account instead.\nAlso: The ultimate Windows troubleshooting trick\nIf you've already created a new Windows account that's associated with a Microsoft account, you can easily convert it to a local account. After signing in for the first time, go to Settings > Accounts > Your Info. Under the Account Settings heading, choose \"Sign in with a local account instead\" and follow the prompts.\nOn Windows 10, make sure you're not connected to the internet when you run Setup; then, when you reach the Sign In With Microsoft screen shown here, click the \"Continue with limited setup\" option in the lower left corner.\nAfter you get past those speed bumps, you can enter your username and password.\nWith a Microsoft account, you have multiple options to recover if you forget your password. With local accounts, you've historically had no such option if you forget your password. Setting up a local account requires that you fill in answers to three security questions to help you recover in the event you forget your password.\nYou can't bypass those questions, nor can you choose alternatives other than the six predefined questions. If you're worried that a thief with a search engine can guess those answers, do as I do and ... be creative. For example, you can answer the three security questions with a three-word passphrase of your own, entered one word at a time. Or, if you'd prefer to bypass the whole feature, just mash the keyboard to create random \"answers\" that no one (including you) could possibly guess. If you choose either option, don't blame me if you forget your password.\nAlso: 7 password rules to live by in 2024, according to security experts\nYou can switch at will between a local account and a Microsoft account using options in Settings > Accounts > Your info.\nEven if you prefer a local account, consider signing in first with a Microsoft account. After you confirm that your system is properly activated and the activation status and encryption recovery key are saved with that Microsoft account, switch back to a local account and go on about your business.\nLikewise, if you're fussy about the name of your default user profile folder, consider signing in with a local account first and then attach your Microsoft account. If you follow that procedure, Windows uses the exact local username you specify as the folder name and retains that name when you switch; if you start with a Microsoft account, your user profile folder name is the first five characters of the portion of your email address to the left of the @ sign.\nActive Directory (domain join)\nIf your company has an enterprise network with a Windows server running as a domain controller, you can join a Windows 10 or Windows 11 PC to the domain. Creating that type of account requires that a domain administrator create an Active Directory account, after which you can sign in using those credentials in the format domain\\username (or username@domain, if the domain is associated with a fully qualified domain name).\nIronically, before you can join a PC to a domain and sign in with your Active Directory account, you have to first create a local account.\nMicrosoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory)\nThis is the newest option in the lineup of Windows account types. Like a domain account, an Entra ID account is managed by an organization's administrator, but it doesn't require a local server. Instead, the credentials are managed in Microsoft's Azure cloud.\n(A quick note here: Microsoft announced the change of name from Azure Active Directory to Microsoft Entra ID in July 2023, and as is always the case, it takes a long, long time for the change to ripple through every part of the system, which mean you will see occasional references to Azure AD in documentation and some management tools. The feature set remains the same, regardless of the name.)\nAlso: Windows security: How to protect your home and small business PCs\nIf your organization uses Microsoft 365 or has an Office 365 Business or Enterprise subscription, you already have a Microsoft Entra ID/Azure AD account. As with a Microsoft account, you sign in using an email address as your username (in this case, the address is assigned by your organization and managed by their IT staff); this account type gives you the ability to sync settings across devices where you're signed in with the same account. The big difference is that your access to the device is managed by your organization's administrator, who can apply security settings and restrict some options.\nTo manage Microsoft Entra ID accounts, administrators use the Microsoft Entra admin center, which also includes the option to synchronize the cloud-based directory with a local domain's Active Directory, an option called Microsoft Entra Connect.\nA basic Entra ID account is free, but like all Microsoft enterprise services, upsell options abound. Paying for a premium account (which is included with a Microsoft 365 E3 or E5 subscription) unlocks advanced security features.\nAlso: Windows 11: Do these six things right away after you finish setup\nAnd you can mix and match account types on the same device for the sake of flexibility. You might want a local account to handle routine administrative tasks, a Microsoft account for personal use, and an Entra ID account for connecting to your organization's servers. To set up additional accounts after the first one, go to Settings > Accounts > Other users and click \"Add account.\" Creating a local account here is relatively easy compared to the initial account setup process.\nOne final note: By default, the new account will be a Standard user with limited permissions. To make the additional account a local administrator, you'll need to change the account type after creating the account.\nThis article was originally published on July 23, 2019.

      "text": "Why Denmark is dumping Microsoft Office and Windows for LibreOffice and Linux\nDenmark's Minister of Digitalization, Caroline Stage, has announced that the Danish government will start moving away from Microsoft Office to LibreOffice. Why? It's not because open-source is better, although I would argue that it is, but because Denmark wants to claim \"digital sovereignty.\" In the States, you probably haven't heard that phrase, but in the European Union, digital sovereignty is a big deal and getting bigger.\nAlso: This city is dumping Microsoft Office and Windows for OnlyOffice and Linux - here's why\nA combination of security, economic, political, and societal imperatives is driving the EU's digital sovereignty moves. EU leaders are seeking to reduce Europe's dependence on foreign technology providers, primarily those from the United States, and to assert greater control over its digital infrastructure, data, and technological future.\nWhy? Because they're concerned about who controls European data, who sets the rules, and who can potentially cut off access to essential services in times of geopolitical tension.\nFor example, after the EU-based International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallan, for war crimes, President Donald Trump issued ICC sanctions. This order allegedly prompted Microsoft to lock the ICC's Chief Prosecutor, Karim Khan, out of his email accounts, according to reports.\nThis came after Microsoft chairman and general counsel, Brad Smith, had promised that the company would stand behind its EU customers against political pressure. Recently, however, Smith stated that Microsoft had not been \"in any way [involved in] the cessation of services to the ICC,\" according to Politico. When pressed, Microsoft failed to further explain how the email disconnection occurred.\nWhether or not Microsoft cut services to an organization in response to Trump's order, the fear that it could do so in the future remains. Before the Danish government announced its move, Denmark's largest cities, Copenhagen and Aarhus, had already announced plans to phase out Microsoft software and cloud services. As Henrik Appel Espersen, chairman of the Copenhagen Audit Committee, who spearheaded this move, said, \"If we suddenly can't send emails or communicate internally because of a political fallout, that's a huge problem.\"\nAlso: Want to save your old computer? Try one of these 8 Linux distros for free\nIn particular, the Danes are worried about Trump's policies and that US political decisions could put public IT services at risk. After all, Greenland, which Trump has said many times he wants to unilaterally take over, is a Danish territory.\nDenmark's Minister of Emergency Situations, Torsten Schack Pedersen, has warned Danish companies and agencies to reduce dependence on American-based cloud services. \"We recommend that companies and authorities create exit plans for the use of, for example, cloud services, and that they also ensure that they have strong ownership of the data.\"\nDenmark is not the only EU country with serious doubts about continuing to work with American tech giants. Bart Groothuis, a Dutch member of the European Parliament, recently said, the EU \"should go for a European cloud\" since \"Europe has a 'problem' with American cloud.\"\nIt's not all about politics, though. Money issues have also played a decisive role. Copenhagen's Microsoft software bill has soared from 313 million kroner in 2018 to 538 million kroner -- about $53 million in 2023, a 72% increase in just five years.\nAlso: Should you ever pay for Linux? 5 times I would - and why\nAll that said, no one expects this to be an easy transition. Making the jump from Azure, Office, and Windows to a third-party EU-based cloud system such as NextCloud, LibreOffice, and Linux will take time and effort.\nNor is everyone a believer in moving to open-source software. Mette Harbo, IT director in the Capital Region of Denmark, thinks it's impossible for Denmark to move off Microsoft software or achieve digital sovereignty.\nStill, as David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH), a Dane, inventor of Ruby on Rails, and co-owner of the software developer company 37Signals, has said, \"Denmark is one of the most highly digitalized countries in the world. It's also one of the most Microsoft-dependent. In fact, Microsoft is by far and away the single biggest dependency, so it makes perfect sense to start the quest for digital sovereignty there.\"\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

Luckily, we've gone hands-on with all of Apple's latest MacBooks, from the light and portable MacBook Air to the powerhouse MacBook Pro. Taking into account memory, portability, features and value, we broke down the pros, cons, and ideal use cases across Apple's laptops.\nInformed by a combination of benchmarking programs, performance testing, and everyday use, we tested Apple's latest MacBooks to measure battery life, visual quality, performance, and practical use in everyday settings.\nWhat's the best MacBook right now?\nThe 15-inch MacBook Air M4 is the best all-around laptop for the majority of users. The 15-inch display is just the right size, it's lightweight enough to commute with, and the upgraded M4 Air processor is fast and battery-efficient. The best part? The M4 MacBook Air comes with more memory for less, with a 10-core CPU on the low end and a 32GB configuration on the high end. This amount of memory was previously unavailable on a MacBook Air, but now, the laptop that set the standard for ultraportables is more powerful than ever.\nAlso: The best laptops you can buy\nBefore Apple announced the MacBook Air M4 in early 2025, rumors abounded on what new features it would come with. As the last of Apple's core line of devices to get the latest M4 chip, the MacBook Air is an incremental upgrade to the M3, more of a refinement and improvement than an earth-shattering new release.\nAnd that's a good thing. The 15-inch MacBook Air M4 is our pick for the best all-around MacBook for the majority of users for its versatility, lightweight form factor, and powerful suite of features. The 15-inch display is just the right size to be portable yet still feel premium and spacious, and now supports two external monitors while the lid is open.\nReview: Apple MacBook Air M4 (15-inch) review\nDuring my testing of the M4, I got over 14 hours of battery life with the device running a 4K video at half brightness, which is about where I expected it to be and about the same as last year's MacBook Air M3. That translates to a full day at the office, even with video calls. And speaking of, they look great with the crisp and clear 12MP Center Stage webcam with 1080p HD video recording.\nBasically, if you are unsure what kind of MacBook to get, we recommend this one. Unless you need to push the limits of performance with a premium processor, the MacBook Air M4 is a capable MacBook for everyone, especially since the upgraded unified memory makes it look a little more like a MacBook Pro.\nMacBook Air M4 (15-inch) specs: Display size: 15.3-inch | Display type: Liquid Retina XDR | Resolution: 2880 x 1864 pixels | Unified Memory: 16GB-32GB | Storage: Up to 2TB | CPU: 10-core M4 | Battery life: Up to 18 hours\nThe MacBook Pro M4 meets the needs of most users, but is particularly well-suited for creatives looking for a powerful laptop for photo and video editing. Yes, technically, the higher-tier M4 Pro and M4 Max chipsets have even more power under the hood for demanding workflows, but we want to call out the base-level MacBook Pro M4 because of how well balanced and capable it is for the vast majority of creative projects relative to price.\nWhether for photo editing, video work, or light gaming, the M4 handled everything smoothly in our testing, even outperforming the old M1 Pro chip. Additionally, starting with 16GB of unified memory and going up to 24GB, the MacBook Pro M4 still has the power behind it to push that performance to the next level.\nReview: MacBook Pro (M4)\nBesides the raw power, however, a handful of quality-of-life features go a long way toward its practicality. The M4 MacBook Pro has three USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports, with one on the right side of the laptop. Also, the new processor allows the computer to extend up to two monitors while the lid is open. Previously, you'd have to close the MacBook lid to power two external monitors.\nLastly, the display looks great as ever, with the new brightness rating -- 1,000 nits at SDR and 1,600 nits at HDR -- paired with the optional, expensive (but so satisfying) nano-texture coating makes this one of the best-looking laptop displays I've used. The matte-frosted layering significantly reduces glare, while the brighter panel just manages to beat out bright light sources.\nMacBook Pro M4 specs: Display size: 14-inch | Display type: Liquid Retina XDR with nano-texture glass | Resolution: 3024 x 1964 pixels | Unified Memory: 16GB-24GB | Storage: Up to 1TB | CPU: 10-core M4 | Battery life: Up to 24 hours\nIf you're looking for a MacBook designed with professional creators in mind and can handle top-tier gaming, the MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro chip brings a whole new level of performance to the series.\nWe're talking a 14-core CPU and 20-core GPU with up to 48GB of unified memory and a brilliant 16-inch Liquid Retina XDR display. When it comes to on-device AI, the M4 Pro features a 16-core neural engine for powering fast and efficient local AI tasks, which are plenty in the latest macOS.\nAlso: I swapped my Windows laptop for a MacBook Air M4, and finally understand the hype\nConnectivity is also a huge step up from the base MacBook Pro with three Thunderbolt 5 ports, an HDMI port, SDXC card slot, headphone jack, and MagSafe 3 port -- all quality of life features that creatives working across multiple mediums will appreciate.\nBut it's not just all about processor performance. Video and audio are studio-quality with the M4 Pro, with ProMotion technology for adaptive refresh rates up to 120Hz and a high-fidelity six-speaker sound system with woofers to elevate the gaming and entertainment experience.\nMacBook Pro with M4 Pro (16-inch) specs: Display size: 16-inch | Display type: Liquid Retina XDR Display | Resolution: 3456 x 2234 pixels (Full HD+) | Unified Memory: 24-48GB | Storage: Up to 4TB | CPU: 14-core M4 Pro | GPU: 20-core M4 Pro | Battery life: Up to 18 hours\nWith every new year of MacBook upgrades, it's easy to write off previous versions as obsolete. But the truth is that models from two, three, or more years ago are still highly competitive machines in 2025. Case in point: the MacBook Air M2 from 2022 is a powerful laptop in its own right, but quite a bit more affordable now that the M4 is on shelves.\nIf you're looking for a new MacBook but want to save some money, this is a great option. The configuration with 8GB of unified memory and 256GB of storage starts at $749 at Best Buy right now, which is half the cost of a new MacBook Air M4 while retaining many of the same features.\nReview: MacBook Air M2\nFor example, the 13-inch MacBook Air M2 is just as ultraportable and lightweight, with fantastic battery life and access to the latest Apple Intelligence features in macOS. Even though it doesn't have the Center Stage camera that automatically centers you in the screen, the webcam in the M2 still looks great. It's a 1080p FaceTime HD camera with a three-mic array and a four-speaker sound system with Spatial Audio for an enjoyable video calling experience.\nMacBook Air M2 (13-inch) specs: Display size: 13.6-inch | Display type: Retina Display | Resolution: 2560 x 1664 pixels | Unified Memory: 8GB | Storage: 256GB | CPU: 8-core M2 | Battery life: Up to 17 hours\nWhen it first came out in 2024, we called the MacBook Air M3 Apple's AI computer for the masses, noting it as the successful culmination of Apple's thin and light lineup, while still being pro enough for most users. Today, all of that remains true, even with the MacBook Air M4 in the game.\nThe 13-inch M3 is differentiated from the newer version by a few key features, namely the M4's ability to support two external monitors with the lid open, a 10-core CPU (as opposed to the 8-core on the M3), the option for more memory, and a slightly better webcam, but that's where most of the similarities end.\nReview: MacBook Air M3 (13-inch)\nThe M3 is comparable in power, performance, and battery life, with a price that often dips well below the $1,000 mark, especially when on sale. For a work laptop, the M3 MacBook Air is well-positioned to handle daily tasks with an all-day battery, 16-core neural engine, and best of all: the thin and light form factor that set the bar for ultraportables.\nIf the horsepower behind a $2,000+ MacBook Pro is overkill, we suggest springing for the M3 MacBook Air as a work laptop that's more than capable, especially for hybrid commuters who don't want to tote around a bulky device.\nMacBook Air M3 (13-inch) specs: Display size: 13.6-inch | Display type: Liquid Retina Display | Resolution: 2560 x 1664 pixels | Unified Memory: 8-24GB | Storage: 256GB | CPU: 8-core M3 | Battery life: Up to 18 hours\nWhat are the tariffs in the US?\nThe recent US tariffs on imports from countries like China, Vietnam, and India aim to boost domestic manufacturing but are likely to drive up prices on consumer electronics. Products like smartphones, laptops, and TVs may become more expensive as companies rethink global supply chains and weigh the cost of shifting production.\nAlso: Tariff war has tech buyers wondering what's next. Here's what we know\nLaptops and PCs are also hit hard by the new U.S. tariffs, with import duties potentially increasing prices by up to 35%. Many major brands still rely on Chinese and Vietnamese factories for assembly, meaning consumers could soon pay significantly more for everything from budget Chromebooks to high-end gaming rigs.\nThese tariffs may accelerate efforts to move production to regions like Mexico or India, but shoppers can expect higher costs and fewer discounts in the short term.\nRight now, it looks like some tech may be exempt from the issued tariffs, but since it's always changing and developing, we are keeping an eye on it and will update you on the latest.\nAlso: Tariff exemptions for electronics offer a break for tech - but not for long\nWhat is the best MacBook?\nZDNET's top pick for the best MacBook is the 15-inch Air M4, sporting the latest in Apple Silicon chip technology, a gorgeous display, great battery life, and more memory for a lower starting price. We think it's the best MacBook for most users, but there are both more powerful and more budget-friendly MacBooks out there.\nThis chart breaks down how the MacBooks stack up with the top features, from price to CPU/GPU, screen size, and display resolution.\nBest MacBook | Starting price | CPU/GPU | Memory/Storage |\nMacBook Air M4 (15-inch) | $1,169 | 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU | Up to 32GB, up to 2TB |\nMacBook Pro M4 (14-inch) | $1,449 | 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU | Up to 32GB, up to 2TB |\nMacBook Pro M4 Pro (16-inch) | $2,499 | 14-core CPU, 20-core GPU | Up to 48GB, up to 4TB |\nMacBook Air M2 (13-inch) | $889 | 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU | Up to 24GB, up to 1TB |\nMacBook Air M3 (13-inch) | $1,099 | 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU | Up to 24GB, up to 2TB |\nWhich is the right MacBook for you?\nWe get it, once you start looking at all the different MacBooks side by side, it can get a little confusing. If you're looking for an all-around solid MacBook that can do a bit of everything, we think the MacBook Air M4 (15-inch) is your best bet, but there are other options that might be better for you personally.\nHere's a well-researched (and tested) list of our favorite MacBooks for the most common use cases.\nChoose this MacBook\u2026 | If you want\u2026 |\nMacBook Air M4 (15-inch) | The newest MacBook Air that's powerful enough for work and play, with a middle-ground 15-inch size. |\nMacBook Pro M4 (14-inch) | A more powerful MacBook with the latest M4 processor with more memory, but don't want to spend $2,500 or more on the top-tier configuration. |\nMacBook Pro M4 Pro (16-inch) | One of the most powerful MacBooks you can buy, with powerful hardware and a large Liquid Retina XDR display that supports ray tracing. |\nMacBook Air M2 (13-inch) | A thin and light 13-inch MacBook without breaking the bank. |\nMacBook Air M3 (13-inch) | A powerful but ultraportable laptop for work. |\nHow we test laptops\nWe use a combination of methods to test laptops here at ZDNET. First, we acquire data from benchmarking software to analyze a system's metrics under the hood and compare those to advertised numbers. Then, we spend an extended amount of time with the laptop -- usually a week or two -- using it the same way a normal consumer would, to assess its portability, form factor, and how well the battery actually holds up. For an extensive breakdown, check out our comprehensive laptop testing methodology.\n- Benchmarking: First, we run a series of tests to put the computer's hardware through the wringer in order to see what it's capable of. Cinebench is one of the most commonly used hardware testing suites, which tests the laptop's rendering performance on single and multiple central processing unit (CPU) cores. PCMark 10 is another powerful program that covers a wide variety of tasks performed in the workplace, and there are many others that we use in tandem to gather as much data as we can. Some components we run tests on include:\n- Processor: The \"brain\" of the laptop and one of the most important factors that determines performance. The four biggest manufacturers that make most of the CPUs found in laptops today are Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple -- in Apple machines only. This is tested in benchmarking software.\n- The display: The size of the display -- measured diagonally from corner to corner -- is also what dictates the laptop's overall size and plays a big role in the device's cost. Brightness is measured in \"nits,\" and color spectrums are tested in benchmarking software.\n- The graphics processor (GPU): Whether it's integrated into the CPU or a dedicated graphics card, how well the machine handles graphics is a key factor when it comes to demanding tasks like video editing, rendering, and of course, gaming. We test the GPU with a combination of benchmarking software, gaming, and media playback.\n- Physical form factor: Finally, the laptop's overall appearance and physical form factor encompasses its weight, thickness, how the keyboard and trackpad feel, and whether it has a display that can be folded back to form a tablet. We carry the laptop around for at least a week and note how well it commutes.\n- Battery testing: We test a unit's battery in a few ways. A handful of benchmarking programs have their own battery testing components, but we will also just let the laptop run for as long as it can under a medium load. We ensure screensavers and hibernation mode are turned off, set the display's brightness and audio at 50%, load up a livestream on YouTube in Chrome, and wait 'til the end.\n- The human element: As we mentioned earlier, metrics and system data are important, but numbers alone don't give you the full picture. This is where we weave in our personal experience with the device and tap into the practical use cases that consumers actually care about.\nUltimately, our goal is to break down the capabilities of each and every laptop we test into digestible terms that real people find useful. There is a lot of noise and confusion when it comes to navigating the laptop and computer consumer market, so we hope to bring an intuitive element to the whole process by leveraging our team's decades of experience.\nWhat are some factors to consider when choosing the best MacBooks?\nEven though MacBooks might look pretty similar on the surface, there are some big differences between them. The best one for you depends on what you plan on using it for. Do you want something thin and light for traveling to work, or do you need substantial RAM and storage for demanding workloads? Here are some key considerations.\n- Portability: The MacBook Air lineup features the thinnest and lightest MacBooks. Obviously, the 13-inch MacBook Air is thinner and lighter than the 15-inch Air, but the small size might be too much of a trade-off. If you end up plugging the laptop into an external monitor anyway, the small-sized 13-inch laptop might make little difference.\n- Performance: Apple's Silicon processors start at the base level M2, M3, or M4, then move up to the Pro, then at the top of the performance chart are the Max chips. Each subsequent generation is slightly more powerful than the previous, but the differences between the M3 and M4, for example, are not earth-shattering.\n- Storage and RAM: The more unified memory your MacBook has, the better equipped it is at performing complex tasks. The MacBook Air M4 is now offered with 32GB of memory, an upgrade from previous versions, which capped out at 24GB. MacBook Pro devices scale to much higher memory options, but you will quickly see the price inflate.\n- Purpose: We broke down the five best MacBooks for the most common use-cases, and are confident one of them would be right for you. If you're unsure about which one applies, the 15-inch MacBook Air M4 is the best all-around MacBook that the majority of users will love.\n- Value: The best laptop can be a pricey investment, so we considered qualities that assure you'll get your money's worth. The older MacBooks, particularly M2 and earlier, are often heavily discounted, despite still being competitive machines in 2025.\nFAQs on laptops\nWhy should you buy a laptop, and not a desktop or a tablet?\nWhile Apple's iMac, Mac Mini, and Mac Studio desktops have their fair share of fans, MacBooks outsell all of those devices combined thanks to the broad selection of sizes, use cases, and just how enjoyable they are to use.\nWith the latest M4 MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, you can still connect to two external monitors with the laptop's display open, promoting a desktop-style user experience, anyway (earlier versions just require you to close the lid for two displays).\nWhat are the best MacBooks for gaming?\nWhile you can run less demanding games on a MacBook Air, we recommend opting for a MacBook Pro if you're into more serious titles. The additional processing power combined with more GPU cores, support for ray tracing, and better cooling mean you're going to have a much better experience. The M4 MacBook Pro is a surprisingly good gaming laptop in 2025, even though Apple computers have notoriously been second-choice machines for gamers.\nWhat are the best MacBooks for students?\nIt really depends on the student, but there are some common factors to consider when shopping for a laptop for school. You'll want something small and lightweight for easier commutes to and from school and between classes.\nAlso: The best laptops for college: Expert tested\nYou'll also want something with at least eight hours of battery life to get through a typical school day without needing to plug in. This is excellent for younger kids who may be forgetful and leave their charging cable at home. The MacBook Air M3 is one of the best all-around laptops for school, but the 13-inch MacBook Air M2 is a smart option as well for a very approachable price.\nWhat are the best MacBooks for business?\nWhether you're looking for a single laptop for yourself or a fleet for your business, the best MacBooks for work offer great performance, multiple connectivity options, and durable builds.\nYou'll probably want a MacBook with at least 16GB of RAM, a 512GB storage drive, and a display large enough to work on without being too bulky to travel with. You'll also want a model with at least eight hours of battery life to get through a typical day of work without needing to recharge constantly.\nThe MacBook Pro M4 is a fantastic device for work, but if you want something light and portable, we recommend the 13-inch MacBook Air M3, which is light and easy to carry, but performs well when connected to external monitors.\nWhat are the best MacBooks for video editing?\nWe strongly recommend getting an M4 MacBook and purchasing Final Cut Pro, an editing software exclusive to the Mac ecosystem. Buying the MacBook M3 Max is another good option if you want some serious raw power. It sports an M3 Max chip and offers great performance for content creators, while seeing a bit of a reduced price since the release of the M4. The machine can also handle 4TB of footage with ease, and sports additional I/O."

      "text": "OpenAI returns to its open-source roots with new open-weight AI models, and it's a big deal\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- OpenAI releases its first open-source LLMs in six years.\n- OpenAI's smallest AI model can run on a laptop.\n- Early reports indicate these new models may have trouble with hallucinations.\nWe all know AI relies on open-source software, but most of the big artificial intelligence (AI) companies avoid opening their code or large language model (LLM) weights. Now, things have changed. OpenAI, the AI titan behind ChatGPT, has announced a landmark return to its open-source origins.\nThe company has unveiled two new open-weight language models, gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, marking the firm's first public release of freely available AI model weights since GPT-2 in 2019, long before the AI hype took over the tech world.\nAlso: OpenAI could launch GPT-5 any minute now - what to expect\nOpen-weight models enable anyone to download, examine, run, or fine-tune the LLM. These models eliminate the need to rely on remote cloud APIs or expose in-house sensitive data to external services.\nOpenAI has not, however, released the training data used for these models because of legal and safety concerns. That situation will not please open-source AI purists, but developers worldwide are already testing the two models.\nAlso: Google embeds AI agents deep into its data stack - here's what they can do for you\nThis change contrasts with OpenAI's approach over the past five years. The business has prioritized proprietary releases fueled by massive Microsoft investments and lucrative API deals.\nAfter all, you can't hope to become a trillion-dollar AI company without maximizing your profits. On the other hand, open source has consistently demonstrated that when code is developed openly, everyone, including the company that releases the code, benefits.\nThe gpt-oss-120b model targets high-performance servers and desktops with beefed-up specifications, including 60 GB of VRAM and multiple GPUs, while the gpt-oss-20b version is compact enough for most laptops.\nYou can download the models from Hugging Face or GitHub. In both cases, your hardware must run MacOS or Linux specifically, with MacOS 11 Big Sur or later, or Linux with Ubuntu 18.04 or later to run the programs. The models could also run on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2.0 on high-powered Windows systems.\nAlso: People are using ChatGPT to write their text messages - here's how you can tell\nOpenAI said: \"The gpt-oss-120b model achieves near-parity with OpenAI o4-mini on core reasoning benchmarks, while running efficiently on a single 80 GB GPU. The gpt-oss-20b model delivers similar results to OpenAI o3\u2011mini on common benchmarks and can run on edge devices with just 16 GB of memory.\"\nSo, how good are the models? AI expert Nate Jones has kicked its tires and reports, \"This one is specifically aimed at retaking American dominance in open-source models now that Llama has dropped the ball. Early tests indicate a higher than usual risk of hallucination, but the power of the model is real and continues to underline how quickly AI is progressing. I'll be watching for how quickly these models get picked up on Hugging Face by developers (who are hard to spin).\"\nThe models are licensed under Apache 2.0, one of the most permissive open licenses. This enables enterprises and developers to use, modify, and monetize the technology without restrictive terms, unlike Meta's not-really open-source Llama LLMs.\nAlso: Anthropic's powerful Opus 4.1 model is here - how to access it (and why you'll want to)\nBoth models employ a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture, which has robust reasoning capabilities while being optimized for efficiency and tool usage.\nProgrammers will be interested in the code execution capabilities, while writers and researchers will find the inclusion of web search as part of the thought process interesting. On the other hand, early reports show very high levels of hallucinations. Additionally, both models are limited to processing text.\nAlso: My go-to LLM tool just dropped a super simple Mac and PC app for local AI\nWhy has OpenAI made this move? The company explicitly stated that these open releases aim to lower barriers in emerging markets and among smaller organizations.\nThe business has also noticed that the Chinese open-source model DeepSeek, which was released in January, made waves thanks to its speed, power, and the fact that it's open source. As Altman said shortly after DeepSeek caught everyone's attention in a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything,\" he believed OpenAI had been \"on the wrong side of history\" about not open-sourcing its software.\nNow, on the eve of the ChatGPT 5 release, OpenAI is on the right side again."

      "url": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-linux-distros-i-recommend-to-help-businesses-cut-costs-and-boost-security/",
      "text": "5 Linux distros I recommend to help businesses cut costs and boost security\nBusinesses around the world may not realize this, but they absolutely depend on Linux and open-source. Without those two pieces of technology, we wouldn't have nearly the services and sites we now enjoy.\nBut Linux isn't just a good option for servers and technology stacks. Linux is also viable as a desktop operating system. Why? It's not only one of the most reliable platforms available, it's also very secure\u2026 and cost-effective.\nAlso: 5 command line backup tools every Linux user should use for desktops and servers\nYeah, that ol' bottom line will grab your attention every time.\nBut which distributions should you consider? The choice can be a bit daunting, especially when you consider most Linux distributions will save you money and help protect your assets (think \"data\"). Let's take a look at the list I've put together.\n1. Ubuntu\nIf there's one Linux distribution I would recommend to small businesses over any other, it's Ubuntu. Why this distribution? It's simple: not only is Ubuntu free and secure, but it also offers some of the best hardware recognition of any operating system available.\nThat might sound like a bag of magic beans, but it's true. I've plugged all types of peripherals into a Ubuntu system, only to find it automatically detects them and works with them (no drivers needed). Sure, there are occasions when I have to search out a driver for a particular piece of technology, but I rarely have problems with this.\nEven better, I can use the Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel and get even more hardware support.\nAlso: The easiest way to try out Ubuntu Linux\nUbuntu also has a vast repository of software to install, both with apt and Snap, so chances are very good that you'll find the apps you'll need for your staff. The one thing I would recommend, however, is that you enable the built-in firewall (UFW), which is typically disabled by default.\nOnce enabled, UFW will not allow traffic into the machine (unless you specify it with a rule, such as sudo ufw allow ssh). There are also a lot of security-specific tools you can install, such as fail2ban (which blocks unwanted SSH connections). For me, Ubuntu sets the gold standard for open-source desktop distributions for individuals and businesses.\n2. Linux Mint\nThink of Linux Mint as Ubuntu with a more familiar desktop environment. Linux Mint is about as easy to use as it gets, without compromising security. Linux Mint also defaults to a secure configuration, such as an enabled firewall, HTTPS redirection, regular (and automatic) updates, minimal telemetry, and zero open ports to minimize the attack surface.\nI would say that Linux Mint is probably the best combination of user-friendliness and security you can find in an operating system.\nAlso: Linux laptop lagging? 5 simple ways to speed it up fast\nLinux Mint uses the Cinnamon desktop environment, which will be immediately familiar to your users, so there will be no training required. Any of your staff will be able to sit at a Linux Mint computer and know how it works. That's not only a time saver, but a cost saver.\nOf course, Linux Mint is free, so you won't be spending any of your budget on operating systems. Linux Mint is also really good at powering older hardware, so you'll be able to keep those machines around a lot longer.\n3. Debian\nThere are tons of distributions based on Ubuntu, but did you know that Ubuntu is based on Debian? Debian is often considered one of the most secure desktop distributions available. One reason for that is that the developers take extra time and care vetting and testing software (which is one of the reasons why it takes a bit longer for a new Debian version to be released). Debian does take the security of Ubuntu a bit further by not adding new users to sudo, which means only those with the root user password can do administrative tasks (such as installing software).\nUnlike other distributions, where every standard user is created as an admin, Debian goes in the opposite direction. This added layer of security means you don't have to worry that a user will do something they shouldn't with their computers. As with most Linux distributions, Debian is free to download and install on as many computers as you need.\n4. elementaryOS\nElementaryOS is a favorite of mine, partially because it's such an elegant desktop, but also because it has a few added security features. Not only does elementaryOS not collect any information about you, but it also gives users warnings when a device (such as a microphone) is being used. This OS also warns you when an app requests permissions to use a service or a piece of hardware.\nAlso: These 6 Linux apps are the secret sauce to my creative process\nThere's also the housekeeping app, which helps to automatically clean your temporary caches and your trash. Then there's the Secure Session feature, which ensures apps always respect your privacy and require your consent. Of course, all of this comes at no cost (although you can make a donation to the developers).\n5. Pop!_OS\nPop!_OS gets a nod here because it offers two versions: one for NVIDIA GPUs and one for AMD GPUs. This means you'll spend less time getting graphics to work as they should, because everything necessary is baked into the different versions. And because Pop!_OS is built on Ubuntu, it enjoys all of the security of that distribution.\nAnother reason why I include Pop!_OS here is that you can purchase hardware directly from System76 (the makers of Pop!_OS) that has Pop!_OS preinstalled. By doing that, you don't have to use your IT staff to install the OS, so they can spend their time doing more business-related tasks. That alone will save you money. Although you would have to purchase the System76 hardware, you can always download and install Pop!_OS for free on whatever desktop systems you have.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

      "text": "Ubuntu 24.04: This great new Linux distro isn't just fast - it's a fortress\nFirst things first. There really is such a thing as a numbat. It's a pocket-sized marsupial anteater (see above). And now, it's also the mascot for Canonical's latest Linux distro, Ubuntu 24.04.\nI've been running Noble Numbat on my 2020 vintage Dell Precision 3451. This PC originally came with Ubuntu 20.04 and is powered by an Intel 8-core 3GHz i7-9700 CPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD.\nAlso: The best Linux distributions for beginners: Expert tested and reviewed\nYou don't need anywhere near that much hardware to run the latest Ubuntu. You can install and run Ubuntu 24.04 on any system with a 2GHz, 2-core 64-bit processor, 4GB RAM, and 25GB storage. Any Windows 7 PC can run it. Heck, it will run just fine on a Raspberry Pi 5.\nLike installing any modern Linux, installing Ubuntu 24.04 is simple. The short version: Download Ubuntu 24.04, burn it to a USB stick, boot it from the stick, run it to see if it likes your hardware, and -- if it does -- press the install button. That's it.\nOh, it's a little fancier than that. The installer now has an accessibility page where you can customize Ubuntu to meet your particular needs. You can also choose between a Default or Full installation. The Default installation includes only the bare essentials, while the Full installation includes all the usual programs you expect from a desktop Linux distribution.\nTechnically, behind the scenes, the new installer is using the Subiquity back-end. The brand-new front end was written with Flutter. Not a developer or a system administrator? Don't worry about it. You'll never need to know.\nIf you are an IT professional, you'll be glad to know that you can now build customized Ubuntu Linux installations. With autoinstall, you can create a repeatable, automated installation flow using an autoinstall YAML file with Subiquity to set up specialized desktops over your network.\nAlso: Thinking about switching to Linux? 10 things you need to know\nBoth versions use GNOME 46 for their default desktop and Firefox 125.0.1 for the web browser. If GNOME isn't to your taste, you can also get Ubuntu 24.04 with Budgie, Ubuntu Budgie, KDE, Kubuntu, MATE, Ubuntu MATE, Cinnamon, Ubuntu Cinnamon -- and on and on. If there's a Linux desktop environment, there's a customized Ubuntu release for it.\nIn the Full version, you'll also find desktop applications such as LibreOffice 24.4.2 for the office suite, Thunderbird 115 for e-mail, Rhythmbox 3.4.7 to play music, and Snapshot for your webcam.\nProgrammers will find that Ubuntu 24.04 LTS now comes with Python 3.12, Ruby 3.2, PHP 8.3, and Go 1.22. It also includes .NET, Java, and Rust. Looking ahead, .NET 8 will be fully supported on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and 22.04 LTS for the entire lifecycle of both releases. That means developers can upgrade their applications to newer .NET versions without upgrading their Ubuntu release.\nWhen Canonical says the \"entire\" lifecycle, that's longer than any other company supports their operating systems. Canonical will support Ubuntu 24.04 until 2036. Yes, that's right. Unlike some operating systems I could name -- cough, Windows 10, cough -- Ubuntu Long-Term Support (LTS) releases now come with 12 years of support.\nAlso: How to add a GUI for your Ubuntu firewall (and why you should)\nIf you need more programs, the new Ubuntu App Center offers a wide variety. While it defaults to Snap-based applications, it still offers traditional DEB installs.\nThe heart of this release is performance, bolstered by the inclusion of the Linux 6.8 kernel. Oliver Smith, Ubuntu product manager, says this isn't just an incremental update. The kernel brings with it numerous performance enhancements that are optimized further by Canonical's low-latency tweaks. This commitment to speed and efficiency signals that Ubuntu is built for those who need a robust, high-performance operating system. While I didn't benchmark this edition, it did feel faster than its predecessor, Ubuntu 22.04, on the same PC.\nUbuntu 24.04 LTS isn't just fast; it's also a fortress. Canonical has layered this release with a slate of security upgrades that harden the system against the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats. The operating system now employs more stringent controls on unprivileged user namespaces -- a common attack vector -- significantly reducing vulnerabilities.\nAlso: Canonical turns 20: Shaping the Ubuntu Linux world\nAre you running both Linux and Windows? Ubuntu's Active Directory (AD) Group Policy client, available via Ubuntu Pro, now supports enterprise proxy configuration, privilege management, and remote script execution. It also continues to support AD Group Policy Objects. Ubuntu 24.04 is also available on Windows via Windows Subsystem for Linux.\nWhile I'm sticking with Linux Mint 21.3 for my default desktop, there's a lot to like about Ubuntu 24.04. If you're looking for a solid, secure, and fast Linux desktop, the newest Ubuntu is well worth your time."

      "text": "10 key reasons AI went mainstream overnight - and what happens next\nThis AI thing has taken off really fast, hasn't it? It's almost like we mined some crashed alien spacecraft for advanced technology, and this is what we got. I know, I've been watching too much *Stargate*.\nBut the hyper-speed crossing the chasm effects of generative AI are real. Generative AI, with tools like ChatGPT, hit the world hard in early 2023. All of a sudden, many vendors are incorporating AI features into their products, and our workflow patterns have changed considerably.\nAlso: The best AI for coding in 2025 (and what not to use - including DeepSeek R1)\nHow did this happen so quickly, essentially transforming the entire information technology industry overnight? What made this possible, and why is it moving so quickly?\nIn this article, I look at ten key factors that contributed to the overwhelmingly rapid advancement of generative AI and its adoption into our technology stacks and workday practices.\nAs I see it, the rapid rise of AI tools like ChatGPT and their widespread integration came in two main phases. Let's start with Phase I.\nPhase I: Fundamental innovations\nResearchers have been working with AI for decades. I did one of my thesis projects on AI more than 20 years ago, launched AI products in the 1990s, and have worked with AI languages for as long as I've been coding.\nAlso: 15 ways AI saved me time at work in 2024 - and how I plan to use it in 2025\nBut while all of that was AI, it was incredibly limited compared to what ChatGPT can do. As much as I've worked with AI throughout my educational and professional career, I was rocked back on my heels by ChatGPT and its brethren.\nThat's Phase I. The 2020s marked an era of fundamental AI innovation that took AI from solving specific problems with the ability to work in very narrow domains to the ability to work on almost anything. There are three key factors in this phase.\n1. Advancements in transformer models\nWhile AI has been researched and used for decades, for most of that time, it had some profound limitations. Most AIs had to be pre-trained with specific materials to create expertise.\nIn the early 1990s, for example, I shipped an expert system-based product called *House Plant Clinic* that had been specifically trained on house plant maladies and remedies. It was very helpful as long as the plant and its related malady were in the training data. Any situation that fell outside that data was a blank to the system.\nAlso: How to run DeepSeek AI locally to protect your privacy - 2 easy ways\nAIs also used neural networks that processed words one at a time, which made it hard for an AI to understand the difference between \"a bank of the river\" and \"a bank in the center of town.\"\nBut in 2017, Google posted a paper called \"Attention Is All You Need.\" In it, they proposed a model called \"self-attention\" that lets AIs focus on what they identify as important words, allowing AIs to process entire sentences and thoughts at once. This \"transformation of attention mechanisms\" enabled the AIs to understand context (like whether the \"bank\" in a sentence refers to the side of a river or a building that holds money).\n2. Widely-trained foundation models\nThe transformer approach gave researchers a way to train AIs on broad collections of information and determine context from the information itself.\nThat meant that AIs could scale to train on almost anything, which enabled models like OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to operate with knowledge bases that encompassed virtually the entire Internet and vast collections of printed books and materials.\nAlso: What is sparsity? DeepSeek AI's secret, revealed by Apple researchers\nThis makes them almost infinitely adaptable and able to pull on vast arrays of real-world information. That meant that AIs could be used for nearly any application, not ones specifically built to solve individual problems. While we spent months training *House Plant Clinic* on plant data, ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot can all diagnose house plant problems (and so much more) without specialized training.\nThe one gotcha has been the question of who owns all that training data? There are numerous lawsuits currently underway against the AI vendors for training (and using) data from copyrighted sources. This could restrict data available to large language models and reduce their usefulness.\nAnother issue with the sort of infinitely scaled training data being used is that much of that information isn't vetted. I know this comes as a surprise to all of you, but information published on the Internet isn't always accurate, appropriate, or even sane. Vendors are working to strengthen guardrails, but we humans aren't even sure what is considered appropriate. Just ask two people with wildly divergent perspectives what the truth is, and you'll see what I mean.\n3. Breakthroughs in hardware (GPUs and TPUs)\nBy the early 2020s, a number of companies and research teams developed software systems based on the transformer model and world-scale training datasets. But all of those sentence-wide transformation calculations required enormous computing capability.\nAlso: AI data centers are becoming 'mind-blowingly large'\nIt wasn't just the need to be able to perform massively parallel and matrix operations at high speed, it was also the need to do so while keeping power and cooling costs at a vaguely practical level.\nEarly on, it turned out that NVIDIA's gaming GPUs were capable of the matrix operations needed by AI (gaming rendering is also heavily matrix-based). But then, NVIDIA developed its Ampere and Hopper series chips, which substantially improved both performance and power utilization.\nAlso: 5 reasons why Google's Trillium could transform AI and cloud computing - and 2 obstacles\nLikewise, Google developed its TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), which were specifically designed to handle AI workflows. Microsoft and Amazon also developed custom chips (Maia and Graviton) to help them build out their AI data centers.\nThere were three major impacts from these huge AI-chip-driven data centers:\n- World-scale training became affordable, at least to the biggest players.\n- AI capabilities could be metered and sold via a SaaS model, making AI accessible to most businesses.\n- AI processing speeds increased rapidly, allowing for the beginning of real-time and near real-time AI analysis of data (which has proven to be mission-critical for self-driving cars).\nPhase II: Market forces drive adoption\nOkay, so now we have working technology. What of it? I mean, how many times has an engineering team produced a product or capability it thought was revolutionary, only to have their work output die due to lack of practicality or market acceptance?\nBut here, now, with generative AI, the market forces are what are driving the real change. Let's dig into seven more key factors.\n4. ChatGPT for everyone, and API access\nAnd then came ChatGPT. It's a funny name and took a while for most of us to learn it. ChatGPT literally means a chat program that's generative, pre-trained, and uses transformer technology. But despite a name that only a geek could love, in early 2023, ChatGPT became the fastest-growing app of all time.\nOpenAI made ChatGPT free for everyone to use. Sure, there were usage limitations in the free version. It was also as easy (or easier) to use than a Google search. All you had to do was open the site and type in your prompt. That's it. And because of the three innovations we discussed earlier, ChatGPT's quality of response was breathtaking. Everyone who tried it suddenly realized they were touching the future.\nAlso: Are ChatGPT Plus or Pro worth it? Here's how they compare to the free version\nThen, OpenAI opened the ChatGPT models to other programmers through an API. All any programmer needed was a weekend of learning and a credit card number in order to add world-changing AI into any application. Cost per API call wasn't much more than for any other commercial APIs, which suddenly meant that AI was a very high-profile, easy addition that could expand a company's product line with a super-hot new income-producing service.\nBarrier to entry? What barrier to entry?\n5. Open source acceleration\nWhile vendor-supported APIs like those from OpenAI can reduce time to market considerably, they also can lead to vendor lock-in. To prevent total reliance on proprietary technologies, the open-source community has embraced AI in a big way.\nOpen-source models (LLaMa, Stable Diffusion, Falcon, Bloom, T5, etc.) provide non-proprietary and self-hosted AI capabilities without relying on big technology monopolies. Open source also democratizes AI by allowing developers to create AI solutions for areas outside the guardrails the big model providers are required to keep in operation.\nAlso: The best open-source AI models: All your free-to-use options explained\nPlatforms like those from Hugging Face provide easy-to-use and easy-to-test tools that allow developers of varying skill levels to integrate AI into their projects quickly.\nThen, of course, there are the classic benefits of open source: large-scale collaboration, continuous improvements, community-generated and validated optimizations, and the introduction of new features, including some too obscure to be profitable for a big vendor but necessary for certain projects.\nAll of this gives businesses of all sizes, researchers, and even nights-and-weekends developers the opportunity to add AI into their projects, which, in turn, is accelerating AI adoption across a wide range of application uses.\n6. Consumer and enterprise demand\nThe thing was, generative AI wasn't just hype. It worked and provided value. Separate from help with writing (which ZDNET policy prohibits for its writers), I documented 15 different ways AI helped me tangibly in just 2024.\nAlso: The work tasks people use Claude AI for most, according to Anthropic\nThese uses ranged from programming and debugging help to fixing photos, to doing that sentiment analysis I mentioned above, to creating album covers, to generating monthly images for my wife's e-commerce store, to creating moving masks in video clips, to cleaning up bad audio, to tracking me during filming, to doing project research, to so much more.\nAnd I'm not alone. Small and large businesses alike, as well as students and individual contributors, all noticed that generative AI could help, for real. Not only were the valuations of the AI companies skyrocketing, but consumers actually bought -- and really used -- the AI tools that suddenly became available.\n7. Virality and network effects\nFor years, decades really, AI was far from mainstream. Sure, there were limited AIs in video games. Expert systems were built that helped solve specific problems for some companies. There was a lot of promise and research. But when it came to \"Show me the money,\" there was never the overwhelming return that vulture capitalists and their ilk required from tech investments.\nAlso: From zero to millions? How regular people are cashing in on AI\nThen, all of a sudden, Aunt Marge was talking about ChatGPT during family gatherings. AI was a thing, it was astonishing, and oh-my-gosh, the things it could do. Did you know you could make it talk like a pirate? Did you know you could get it to write a *Star Trek* story? Did you know it could analyze your siloed business data and give you sentiment analysis in minutes without a bit of programming? And did you know it could write code that worked?\nWithin a few months, ChatGPT became the fastest-growing app of all time, hitting 100 million active users. A year later, that doubled to 200 million active users.\n8. Competitive market pressure\nSuddenly, AI was a headliner rather than the personality mark of the geeky neighbor you ask over to fix your PC but really would prefer they went away once the PC was working again and they were paid in fresh baked cookies.\nOddly specific analogies about my geeky past aside, AI was clearly an opportunity. OpenAI was suddenly worth billions, and it seemed like Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Apple, and all the rest had been left behind.\nInvestment and licensing deals were everywhere, and AI was being baked into mainstream products either as a bonus feature or (far more prevalent) a very nice upsell to a monthly annuity. Microsoft had Copilot, Google had Gemini, Meta had Meta AI, Amazon had Q, and Apple\u2026 eventually had Apple Intelligence (for whatever that's worth).\n9. Legislative and regulatory lag\nThis new AI boom took on characteristics of the wild, wild west. Governments were just trying to get their heads around what it all was, and whether this was an enormous economic opportunity or an existential threat. Hint: it's both.\nThe US government set up some plans for AI oversight, but they were tepid at best. AI vendors warned of catastrophe if AI isn't regulated. Lawsuits over copyright issues complicated matters. Then, the new administration changed the game, with a focus on substantially reduced regulation.\nAll this opens the door for AI companies and businesses using AI to innovate and introduce new capabilities. This is great for rapid growth and innovation, but it also means the technology is running without guardrails. It definitely fuels the mainstreaming of AI technology, but it could also be very, very baaaaaad.\n10. Continuous innovation and investment\nSo, then we get to the rinse-wash-repeat phase of our discussion. AI isn't going anywhere. All of the self-fulfilling prophecies are fueling new innovation because they actually work. Major companies are continuing to not only make billion-dollar bets on the technology, but are also offering compelling products and services that can provide real value to their customers.\nMore and more companies and individuals are investing in AI startups and ongoing services. We're seeing breakthroughs like multimodal AI with text/images/video/audio, autonomous agents, and even AIs used to code AIs.\nAlso: What is Perplexity Deep Research, and how do you use it?\nThe closest example I can think of to this virtuous cycle was the app economy of the mid-2000s. Data speeds became fast enough and affordable enough for phones to always be connected to the Internet, startups offered app services that proved to be tangibly valuable, those companies grew huge and continued to offer services, and more and more investment into mobile-first computing paid off for both consumers and producers.\nIt's very likely that a virtuous cycle is also driving AI innovation and production, pushing generative AI and other AI-based services very much into the mainstream, where it's unlikely to ever go away.\nPhase III: The future\nWhen I went to college in the 1980s and majored in computer science, my mom said that all she wanted from me was a computer that would vacuum her floors. Now, we have a wide range of little robots that go forth and do just that. This morning, while having coffee, I taped \"Vac and mop bedroom,\" and Wally the Narwal did just that.\nMy dream is to be able to say, \"Alexa, bring me coffee,\" and have a device actually make me a cup of coffee and bring it to me while I'm sitting here writing. Don't laugh. Whether it's Tesla, Apple, or Meta, real work is being done right now on humanoid robots.\nGiven how many times my Alexa screws up and how many times ChatGPT makes up stuff to save face, I'm not exactly sure that having a romping, stomping robot in my living room or office is a good idea. But I do want my coffee.\nAlso: What is DeepSeek AI? Is it safe? Here's everything you need to know\nStay tuned. The past two years have been a wild ride, and I suspect we've only just seen the beginning.\nWhat do you think has been the most significant factor in AI's rapid adoption? Have you incorporated AI tools like ChatGPT into your daily workflow? If so, how have they changed the way you work or create?\nDo you see AI as a long-term game-changer, or do you think we're in the midst of a hype cycle that will eventually stabilize? And what about the ethical and regulatory concerns? Do you think AI development is moving too fast for proper oversight?

It wasn't until much later that I realized another side of my multifaceted artistic self needed to write words. At first, I used paper and pen, but eventually, I migrated to a word processor.\nAlso: My 6 must-have Linux apps for productivity, and why they make work easier\nIn those early days, that was StarOffice, and with it, I began another journey that would continue throughout my life. I was an actor. Then I was a writer and author. Then came podcasting and filmmaking. I wonder: What's next?\nRegardless, when I needed the right tools for the job, I was lucky enough to find them all on Linux. Here are the apps I find most important for artistic expression and creation.\n1. DaVinci Resolve\nDaVinci Resolve is my non-linear editor of choice.\nI've been using it for just over two years (after being a long-time Final Cut Pro user), and I've found it to be exactly what I needed. Resolve is not only a great editor, but its coloring tools are the best I've used. I mostly film in Log, and Resolve is brilliant with color science and includes baked-in data for several camera makers, including Red, Blackmagic, Sony, and Arri.\nAlso: I was a Final Cut Pro diehard until DaVinci Resolve won me over with these 3 features\nThere are two things I should caution you about. First, you need a machine with an Nvidia GPU to run Resolve on Linux. I've installed and tried using Resolve on AMD graphics chips; Resolve crashes so often that the frustration isn't worth it. Hopefully, Blackmagic will release Resolve for AMD GPUs to reach a much wider user base on Linux.\nSecond, with any professional-grade non-linear editor, there's a pretty steep learning curve. I thought I'd never understand the workflow the first time I used Resolve. I get it now, and I'm glad I stuck with it.\nYou can install DaVinci Resolve for free (using the community edition) or purchase the Studio version from the official site. I would highly recommend you start with the free version and then purchase Studio once you have the hang of it.\n2. Audacity\nIf you are a podcaster, book narrator, or musician, you need a multi-track audio recording app, and Audacity is one of the best for Linux. Sure, there are some with more power and flexibility, but you won't find an audio recorder with as many features as Audacity that matches the user-friendliness found in this app.\nAlso: 10 Linux apps I can't do without - and why\nAudacity makes creating multi-track recordings easy and includes all the plugins you'll need (such as background noise elimination, EQ, and so much more). I used Audacity for recording my Zombie Radio podcast, which survived a seven-year run. Using Audacity made it possible not only to record and edit the podcast, but also to make it sound incredibly professional. I honestly cannot imagine an app better suited for the task.\nYou can install Audacity on Linux (for free) from the standard repositories of your distribution.\n3. LibreOffice\nI've written almost 70 novels, and every one of them was either created or edited with LibreOffice. I honestly can't imagine how many words I've pounded out in that app. With LibreOffice, I can write my novels, go through the edits with my editor, and even format them before sending them to my publisher (because I'm nice and don't want to overburden the publisher with such busy work).\nAlso: How to make LibreOffice look more like Microsoft Office\nLibreOffice has never failed me. One of my favorite features of LibreOffice is the ability to create custom styles specific to my publisher's needs. After creating those styles, I can start writing, and LibreOffice knows which style comes next. For example, I select a style I call Chapter Heading and then I type the chapter number. After hitting Enter, LibreOffice knows the next style is Body Text. It's a small thing, but it makes writing full-length novels a bit easier.\nYou can install LibreOffice from the standard repository on your distribution, but I typically download the .deb version from the official site and install it manually (so I know I'm using the latest version).\n4. GIMP\nI also create a lot of my book covers (again, to be kind to my publisher) and to do that, I use GIMP.\nAlso: 4 GIMP 3.0 upgrades I'm loving as a power user - and how to try it for free\nGIMP is the open-source equivalent to Photoshop. It's powerful and includes tons of filters and layering tools\u2026 everything I need to create complex images. The biggest complaint some users have is the UI. Fortunately, with just a little work, you can customize the GIMP UI to look more like Photoshop. But don't let the interface stop you from giving GIMP a try. I will warn you that to really get the most out of this tool, you'll want to spend some time because there is a bit of a learning curve.\nYou can install GIMP for free from your distribution's standard repositories.\n5. Blender\nBlender is a 3D creation application that supports modeling, rigging, animation, rendering, simulation, and video editing. Blender has been used in film, television, architecture and product design, game development, advertisement, education, research, and other industries. Blender provides a wide range of tools, such as those for polygon modeling, subdivision surface modeling, fluids, particles, rigid body dynamics, soft body dynamics, and NURBS (non-uniform rational B-spline) modeling, realistic animations using physics simulations, and much more.\nAlso: The 6 Linux distros I recommend most for gaming in 2025 - including my favorite\nIn order to make use of Blender, you really need to have a solid understanding of 3D graphics and animation; otherwise, you'll have a tough road ahead. You can install Blender (for free) from most of the Linux standard repositories.\n6. OBS Studio\nOBS Studio (Open Broadcasting Software) is a free and open-source application designed for video recording and live streaming. OBS is primarily used by streamers, YouTubers, Twitch personalities, and other online content creators to broadcast their live streams. OBS Studio can record gameplay, screen captures, and camera footage directly to a file or to streaming services.\nAlso: The best software for Twitch streaming: Expert tested free and paid options\nWith this app, you can create multiple scenes with different settings (audio levels, video sources, transitions, etc.) and use sources from video capture devices, audio input, browser windows, and network streams. OBS Studio is flexible, easy to use, and has a large community for support.\nOBS Studio can be installed (for free) from the standard repositories or using Snap.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

This Linux distro is the best alternative for your Windows 10 PC\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- SDesk is available now, free of charge, and you can install it on as many computers as you need.\n- It's a fast and dependable Linux distribution with a user interface that anyone will be instantly familiar with.\n- I experienced some minor issues during my setup, which were simple to resolve.\nI wouldn't normally suggest an Arch-based Linux distribution for new users, but every so often, I come across one that challenges my perceptions. Recently, I discovered an Arch-based Linux distro called SDesk, and there couldn't be a clearer use case for it.\nFirstly, SDesk is fairly straightforward and doesn't do all that much to separate itself from the ever-growing list of Linux distributions. Sometimes, that's a good thing. I wasn't sure what to expect after installing and logging into this desktop distribution, but when I did, everything was immediately familiar.\nAlso: Why Denmark is dumping Microsoft Office and Windows for LibreOffice and Linux\nSDesk opts for the GNOME desktop, which is configured to resemble a \"standard\" desktop that would be familiar to both Windows and MacOS users. On the interface, you'll find a panel, a menu, a top bar, favorites, and desktop icons. On the top bar, there's the Workspaces button (far left), the time/date (which, when clicked, opens notifications and calendar), and the system tray.\nThe list of pre-installed applications is also fairly standard, including:\n- LibreOffice (office suite)\n- Geary (email)\n- GNOME Music (music player)\n- GNOME Video (video player)\n- Octopi (GUI package manager)\n- GNOME Maps\n- Swirl (web browser)\nOf course, if you don't find the app you need, you can always install it with Octopi or Flatpak.\nThe one curiosity I encountered was Swirl, which isn't based on either Chromium or Firefox. In fact, I haven't had much luck digging up any information about this web browser at all. I can tell you that Swirl is fairly minimal and has very little in the way of settings. It works fine, but I'm not ready to recommend a browser for which I can't find much information. You can always install Chromium or Firefox using Octopi. I installed Firefox and it runs quite well.\nWhat I like\nI really appreciate how the developers created a GNOME layout that should appeal to most users. It's clean, it's easy, and it looks quite good. It's also helpful that the distribution ships with most of the tools you'll need (the primary being a web browser and an office suite). I would, however, suggest you install Firefox or Chromium (as I mentioned earlier).\nThe performance is also quite good. I found applications responded instantly, nothing stalled, and apps installed quickly. This is fairly typical of Arch-based distributions, so I wasn't at all surprised.\nAlso: 5 most Windows-like Linux distros because old habits die hard\nThere's also window snapping, which SDesk does well. Most Linux desktops have this feature, but some limit the basic configuration to half of the display. SDesk takes this a step further and allows you to drag a window to any of the four quarters of the screen.\nWhat I don't like\nSDesk is a fairly new distribution, which means it can be a bit rough around the edges. Let me explain.\nAfter the usual round of testing (installing applications, tinkering with the settings, etc.), I ran an update and rebooted the machine. Upon reboot, I went to log in, and the desktop locked up. This happened after selecting the default user that popped up in the login window. I did a quick test (after a hard reboot) and clicked \"Not Listed.\" After typing my password, I was able to successfully log in. I'm sure this is a bug that the developers will soon fix.\nAlso: Can't upgrade your Windows 10 PC? You've got 5 months to act - here are your options\nAnother issue was multimedia playback. Out of the box, SDesk doesn't have the codecs to play MP3 or MP4 files. Fortunately, this issue was easily resolved by installing the VLC media player like so:\nsudo pacman -S vlc\nOnce I installed VLC, I could play whatever I needed.\nBottom line\nOther than those two caveats, I found SDesk to be a take on Arch Linux that is viable for just about any user. As with any Linux desktop OS, there really wasn't much I couldn't do. After installing a few simple apps, I found SDesk could serve just about any purpose.\nIt's a beautiful, simple, fast, and reliable OS. What more do you need from a desktop operating system? You might even find yourself preferring it over your Windows desktop. You can download an ISO for SDesk here.\nSince publishing this story, SDesk has released version 19.1. I'll be deep-diving into that in the near future, so stay tuned to ZDNET."

      "text": "5 command line backup tools every Linux user should use for desktops and servers\nI use Linux for both desktop and server. My preference for a server OS is one without a GUI, which means I have to turn to a lot of command-line tools. In some cases, I prefer to use the same command-line tools for both desktop and server, because it simplifies everything. After all, I don't want to have to learn two different tools for the same job. On top of that, the command-line tools I've included in this list are very powerful and flexible enough to meet all of my needs.\nWith a command-line backup tool, I can enjoy automated backups using either built-in features or cron, which makes them even more flexible. Plus, command-line tools tend to use fewer resources than their GUI counterparts.\nAlso: 8 things you can do with Linux that you can't do with MacOS or Windows\nWith that said, what are the best command-line backup tools available to Linux?\nHere are five of them for your consideration.\n1. Rsync\nThe rsync command-line backup tool is the easiest to use on the list and can be used to back up locally (to external-attached drives) or remotely. Rsync is also one of the more popular backup tools for Linux users. This backup tool includes features like incremental backups, whole directory tree and file system updates, file permission, links, and ownership preservation, and can be automated with the help of bash scripts and cron. Of course, rsync doesn't have to be set up for automatic backups, as you can run it manually whenever you need.\nAlso: I'm a command-line pro and this is the best terminal app I've ever used, thanks to AI\nThe best quality about rsync is that it's really easy to use (as long as you're okay with the Command Line Interface). Not only that, but it's also fast and can even work over SSH, so it's more secure. Rsync comes preinstalled on most Linux distributions, so you can start using it right out of the gate.\n2. Tar\nTar is a command-line archiving tool for Linux that can also be used for backups. One of the best parts of using tar for backups is that it's simple. Tar can be used in conjunction with cron to create automated backups and with Gzip to create compressed backups. You can even append a file to a tar backup and exclude files while creating your backup. Tar allows you to view the contents of a backup and easily extract the contents. Tar is preinstalled on all Linux distributions, so there's nothing to install, and it's free to use. You can even use tar to back up to a remote machine, with the help of SSH.\n3. Bacula\nUnlike rsync and tar, Bacula is hard to set up. Really hard. In fact, I would only recommend Bacula to those with plenty of Linux experience. Even so, Bacula is a powerhouse backup tool. With Bacula, you get data backup, recovery, and verification. This backup solution is also enterprise-ready, so you know it can do the job. The reason why Bacula is so challenging is that it is comprised of several parts: a directory, a console, a file, storage, a catalog, and a monitor.\nOne consideration is that the free version of Bacula is a community edition, but there is also an enterprise edition, which includes support. Unless you are super serious about your backups, I wouldn't suggest Bacula. If you are super serious, Bacula is one of the most powerful backup solutions you'll find for Linux.\n4. Backupninja\nBackupninja fits somewhere between rsync and Bacula in the difficulty category. Backupninja uses ini-style files for configuration, so you'll need to understand how those work before you set up your first backup. Backupninja includes features like scheduled backups, scripts to handle different types of backups, status report emails, backup action configurations (using the ninjahelper wizard), flexible storage options, monitoring, alerts, MySQL database backups, encrypted remote backups, and even backups of Subversion repositories. Backupninja can be installed from the standard repositories.\nAlso: Want to save your aging computer? Try these 5 Linux distributions\nSomething to keep in mind is that there is backupninja and Backup Ninja, and they are not the same thing. Where backupninja is a free, open-source software, Backup Ninja is not.\n5. Restic\nRestic is a modern command-line backup tool that can back up locally or remotely (remote backups are handled via SFTP). Restic uses cryptography for every step of the process, so your backups are safe, no matter where you back them up. One important feature of Restic is that it follows Semantic Versioning, which means your backups will always be compatible, no matter what version of the app you use. Restic is a single executable file, which makes it much easier than the likes of Bacula or backupninja. Restic is available in the Ubuntu standard repositories and the EPEL repository for Fedora.\nAlthough Restic is easier than the two more challenging backup solutions on the list, it is more difficult than rsync or tar. With this tool, you have to initialize a repository. Restic features file exclusion, snapshot listing, data restoration, deduplication, compression, cloning, and pruning. Restic is open-source and free to use.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

      "url": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-factors-steadily-fueling-linuxs-desktop-rise/",
      "text": "5 factors steadily fueling Linux's desktop rise\nYou can't blame the first prophecy of the \"Year of the Linux desktop\" on me. No, I've certainly been a true believer, but the credit -- or blame, if you must -- goes to Dirk Hohndel, Linux kernel developer and Verizon's senior director of the Open Source Program Office.\nHohndel confessed that \"in 1999 he was the first to predict the 'Year of the Linux desktop.' Predictions are hard,\" he continued wryly, \"especially about the future. But if I changed it from the year of Linux desktop and changed it to a decade and a half from now, client computing will be mostly Linux, which has happened.\"\nAlso: I found an independent Linux distro that's easy to install - and comes with everything I need\nNow, the year of the Linux desktop is finally happening. Yes, really.\nAs I've pointed out, if you say Linux is the top-end user operating system, you can make a good case for it. Do you have an Android phone? Congrats, you're a Linux user. Chromebook? Ditto. Does your work depend on Google Docs? Guess what it runs on? Yes, that's right, Linux.\nNumbers don't lie\nRecently, however, I was looking for web search engine popularity numbers. The usual sites people use for these numbers, such as Statcounter, as Ed Bott recently pointed out, have real problems. So, I went to the most reliable source I know of, the US federal government's Digital Analytics Program (DAP).\nThis site gives a running count of US government website visits and an analysis. On average, there are 1.6 billion sessions in the last 30 days, with millions of users daily. In short, DAP gives a detailed view of what people use without massaging the data.\nAccording to the source data, in 2025, Linux users made up 5.4% of visitors. That proportion is way above any other legitimate numbers I've ever seen.\nAlso: My Linux predictions for 2025: It's going to be a good year\nYeah, I know, 5.4% may not sound like much. But, if you add in Android (17.6%) and Chromebooks (2.1%), you're talking about 25.1% of visitors, which puts it above MacOS (10.1%), Windows 10 (14.1%), and Windows 11 (16.2%), which is downright impressive.\nLet's look at it another way. All Windows users combined, which included a smidgen of people still using Windows 8.1 and 0.3% using Windows 7, come to 31.7%. So, yes, to no one's surprise, Windows is the top desktop operating system.\nAlso: I found a minimal Linux distro that's fast and efficient for all experience levels\nBut, if we look at all operating systems, you'll see that Apple iOS is the top operating system with 33.1%. Indeed, as anyone who does web traffic analysis can tell you, just as many people use mobile operating systems (49.1%) these days as desktop operating systems (49.3%). In 2024, there were more smartphone users (53.2%) than desktop users (45.1%).\nWhen Linux users talk about the Linux desktop, most of them, like their Windows counterparts, are talking about just the desktop. Mobile phone users are primarily users, whereas desktop users of any operating system are workers and creators. It's a different world.\nThis Linux desktop's numbers don't appear to be a statistical anomaly. In 2024, the Linux desktop reached 4.5% of all end-user operating systems, or about 9% if you only look at desktops. While Statcounter isn't the most reliable source, it also shows the Linux desktop slowly growing in popularity. In 2025, Linux is up to 4.27%, which is higher than last year at about the same time.\nAlso: How to clear cache and temp files in Linux to speed up your system fast\nSo, why has Linux been gaining in popularity? Well, I'll give credit to all the usual reasons I recommend Linux to people. Let's dig in.\n1. Windows isn't Microsoft's priority\nMicrosoft's profits these days come from its Azure cloud and software-as-a-service offerings, particularly Microsoft 365. The company doesn't want you to buy Windows; it wants you to subscribe to Windows 365 Cloud PC.\nBy the way, you can run Windows 365 Cloud PC on Macs, Chromebooks, Android tablets, iPads, and, of course, Linux desktops. Or, if the folks from Redmond can't talk you into a full desktop-as-a-service, they'll be more than happy to lease you Microsoft 365 with AI for more money.\nAlso: Why this Linux distro is my new favorite Windows replacement\nA related issue is that there are soon going to be a lot of Windows 10 PCs that won't be able to run Windows 11. With the clock ticking on Windows 10, many people are looking at alternatives to buying new Windows machines. After all, while no one can predict what is happening with tariffs anymore, according to a report by Trade Partnership Worldwide (TPW), published by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), you can expect laptop prices to go up by 34%.\nMany people are giving their old computers new life with ChromeOS Flex, a Linux variant, or trying to shoehorn Windows 11 on theoretically incompatible Windows 10 machines. Others are putting a desktop Linux distro on their PCs. If you go this route, I recommend Linux Mint for out-of-date Windows 10 PCs. It's what I use.\n2. Linux gaming is viable now\nGaming has never been Linux's best point, but thanks to Steam, Linux is now a real gaming platform. While Linux remains a niche player in the broader PC gaming market, its share is higher than ever, and it's slowly growing.\n3. Linux is not hard to use\nYeah, I know what you've heard. Sure, Linux was harder to use a decade ago, but, spoiler alert, we're not in 2015 anymore. If you want to be a Linux power user, Linux will challenge you. But if all you want to do is work and play, many Linux distributions are suitable for beginners, and some of them, such as SDesk, look and feel an awful lot like Windows.\nAlso: My 5 go-to Linux commands for troubleshooting - and how I use them\nBesides, 13 years ago, I taught my mother-in-law, who was then 79, how to use the Linux desktop, and we didn't even share a common language. If she could learn Linux, so can you.\n4. Installing Linux desktop software is easy\nWhile some Linux purists dislike containerized application installation programs, such as Flatpak, Snap, and AppImage, developers love them. These programs make it simple to write applications for Linux that don't need to be tuned just right for all the numerous Linux distributions. For users, that means they get more programs to choose from and don't need to worry about finicky installation details.\nThese days, if you can install an app on your phone from an app store, you can install programs on Linux. It's that easy.\n5. Linux is much safer than Windows\nIt's not even close. Sure, Linux isn't perfectly safe. Nothing is. But you're not taking your PC's life in your hands if you don't have the latest updates. You also don't need to use anti-virus software on Linux. You'd be an idiot to run Windows without at least Microsoft Defender. Let me put it to you this way: Linux doesn't have, or need, a monthly Patch Tuesday to fix the latest zero-day security holes.\nMind you, the Linux desktop still has its problems. To quote Linus Torvalds, the man, the legend, and Tux the penguin's dad, \"fragmentation of the different vendors has held the desktop back.\" With over 270 current Linux desktop distros, choosing the right one can be a real pain. And let's not forget that even Canonical, Ubuntu Linux's parent company, doesn't make the Linux desktop its priority.\nAlso: The first 5 Linux commands every new user should learn\nStill, as people have been figuring it out, if you stick with one of the major distributions that I, and my brother-in-Linux, Jack Wallen, recommend, you'll do just fine.\nSo, enough with the waiting. Join the Linux desktop surge. I think you'll be glad you did. Hey, maybe there really will be an honest-to-goodness year of the Linux desktop if you join in.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

      "text": "5 MacOS-like Linux distros that can rescue your old Intel Mac before support ends\nYou might have heard that several iterations of Intel-based Macs will no longer be supported by Apple. Although when Tahoe is released and Intel-based Macs start losing support, Apple will continue providing critical security updates for those machines for roughly three more years, during which time they will not receive any new features.\nAfter that three-year period ends, those Intel-based Macs will receive nothing. But there's hope\u2026 in Linux.\nAlso: Want to save your old computer? Try one of these 8 Linux distros for free\nYes, you can install Linux on Macs. The process is very similar to how you install Linux on any laptop or desktop (as I showed you in I rescued my dying 2017 MacBook Pro with Ubuntu and it works like a charm (mostly)). Although not every feature worked for me (I had to use a Wi-Fi dongle to get wireless to work), you'll find that certain Mac devices fare better than others.\nIf that sounds appealing, you might want to consider a Linux distribution that resembles MacOS in some ways. No, you won't find a MacOS clone, but there are some distributions that, thanks to their desktop layouts, can get you up and running with a bit less stress.\n1. elementaryOS\nAlthough elementaryOS might not have quite the elegance found in MacOS (it could certainly use a bit of glass and blur, in my opinion), it's always one of the first Linux distributions I think of when someone mentions a MacOS-like OS. elementaryOS has the same layout (dock and top bar), a consistent UX throughout the desktop, runs like a champ, and is simple to use.\nThis distribution is designed and developed totally with the user experience in mind, and the developers have done a fabulous job following through on that. With every app blending into the theme, elementaryOS feels so similar to earlier versions of MacOS. The elementaryOS development team has even posted very strict guidelines that developers must follow to get their apps onto the desktop.\nAlso: 6 features I wish Linux would borrow from MacOS\nThe elementaryOS distribution is based on Ubuntu, so it includes a rock-solid foundation, the simplicity of the apt package manager, and Flatpak for the installation of all the apps you need. You can download and install elementaryOS for free (although a donation is helpful) from the official site.\n2. ZorinOS\nIf you use the free version of ZorinOS, you get four desktop layouts. If, however, you pay for the Pro version ($47.99), you get six other layouts, one of which looks very much like MacOS. On top of all that, ZorinOS mixes in a bit of transparency (but not background blur) to give it more panache.\nUnlike elementaryOS, ZorinOS also ships with several preinstalled applications, including LibreOffice, Brave browser, and Evolution groupware suite. ZorinOS also enjoys an Ubuntu foundation, so it will have solid hardware recognition, an outstanding package manager, and will run like a champ.\nAlso: I converted this Mini PC from Windows to Linux, and it came alive. Here's how\nJust remember, if you want the MacOS-like layout, you have to pay for the Pro version. Of course, you could also use the free version, choose the GNOME layout, and install the GNOME Dash To Dock extension to get a MacOS-like look.\n3. Ubuntu Budgie\nI've been a fan of Ubuntu Budgie for a long time. Ubuntu Budgie brings together two of my favorite Linux things -- the Ubuntu distribution and the Budgie desktop. What's not to love? One nice feature of Ubuntu Budgie is that you can easily switch between a MacOS-like dock or a Windows-esque panel, and several other layouts. Ubuntu Budgie also ships with several themes you can use, including those based on previous releases of MacOS (such as WhiteSur and Mojave).\nIf there were a Linux distribution that could make me switch from my current favorite, Pop!_OS, it would be Ubuntu Budgie. In fact, a few years ago, I did switch from Pop!_OS to Ubuntu Budgie. It wasn't until I purchased a new System76 Thelio desktop that I switched back to Pop!_OS.\nAlso: How to download files on Linux without a web browser - and why this way is faster\nYou can download and install Ubuntu Budgie for free. Just grab an ISO from the official download site, burn it to a USB flash drive, boot it, and install this fantastic OS.\n4. Pop!_OS\nPop!_OS might be an odd choice for a MacOS-like distribution, but the proof is hard to deny. The default Pop!_OS layout includes a dock and a top bar. How MacOS is that? Verily, I would say quite. But Pop!_OS isn't just about having a pretty MacOS-esque face. Pop!_OS is about power and the ability to download different versions for NVIDIA or AMD GPUs. That alone makes a huge difference, because you won't have to spend time locating the proper drivers for your hardware. It also makes Pop!_OS a great distribution for gaming, or other video-intensive tasks.\nAlso: The best Linux laptops you can buy: Expert tested for students, hobbyists, and pros\nI would recommend Pop!_OS for just about any use case, and if you like the look and feel of MacOS, this would be a great option to install on your no-longer-supported Mac. You can download and install Pop!_OS for free from the official download site.\n5. pearOS\npearOS is probably the closest thing to a MacOS-looking desktop you'll find on Linux. During installation, you also choose between NVIDIA or AMD GPUs. pearOS uses KDE Plasma and Latte Dock to achieve the MacOS look, and boy, does it achieve its goals. With plenty of blur and transparency, your PearIntosh will surprise you with how much it resembles MacOS. I will warn you, though, that pearOS can be a bit tricky to install. It's not the installation process that's challenging; it's that installing it as a virtual machine poses some issues. Because of that, your best bet is to give it the ol' college try on your Intel-based Mac and hope that it succeeds. If it does, you're in for a treat, because pearOS is gorgeous.\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that pearOS ships with a bare minimum of applications, so you'll need to open the app store immediately and start installing the apps you need.\nAlso: Ready to ditch Windows? 5 factors to help you decide between Linux or MacOS\nYou can download an ISO of pearOS from the official download site and install it for free."

I mean, I taught my then-mother-in-law at the age of 79 how to use Ubuntu Linux, and we didn't even speak the same language! If she could do it, you can do it.\nThe real problem is picking the best beginner Linux distribution for you. There are literally hundreds of desktop Linux distributions to choose from. Some, such as Gentoo and Linux From Scratch, are tough to use, but most of them are easy-peasy.\nAlso: The best Linux laptops: Expert tested\nWhat is the best Linux distribution for beginners right now?\nWith three decades of Linux experience, I'm here to help you choose the version of Linux that will get you started on the right foot, so your journey is not only as easy as possible but also fun, reliable, and safe. I've tested all these versions myself, and my pick for the best Linux distribution for beginners overall is Linux Mint because its interface is easy to use, and like all Linux distros it won't cost you a dime. Oh, and by the way, it also gives you everything you need from a desktop if you're a pro-Linux user as well.\nBest Linux distributions for beginners in 2025\nTired of Windows? Then consider turning to Linux Mint, in particular, the version using the Cinnamon interface. I'm a Linux power user, and my current favorite desktop operating system is Linux Mint 22.1, but I can highly recommend it to anyone, even beginners.\nMint, with several desktop environments such as Cinnamon 6.4, looks a lot like XP or Windows 7. It uses a Windows Icon, Menu, and Pointer (WIMP) interface, much like the one you probably already know and love. It's not a one-to-one match with XP or Windows 7, but most Windows users will find Cinnamon a comfortable fit. Linux users who grew up with the GNOME 2.x style interface will also love Cinnamon since it's based on that classic Linux desktop interface.\nAlso: 12 best Windows laptops\nLike all Linux desktop distros, Mint is more than just an operating system -- it also comes with all the software you need. LibreOffice 24.2.7 for office work and homework, Firefox 134 for web browsing, Thunderbird 128.5.2 for email and calendering, and GIMP 2.10.36 for graphics editing. If you're a gamer, Linux Mint supports Steam, which works the same way it does on Windows. All of this, including Mint, is free.\nLinux Mint features: Price: Free | Core code: Linux kernel 6.8 | Open source? Yes\nAlso: How to choose the right Linux desktop distribution\nDo you use the web for everything? Do you write with Google Docs, use NerdWallet for your personal finances, and check Gmail for your email? If that's you, then what you want is a Chromebook, or to just replace Windows or macOS with ChromeOS Flex.\nAlso: The 5 best Chromebooks\nChromeOS may not look like what you think of as Linux, but sure enough, underneath its Chrome web browser interface, ChromeOS is Linux. Chrome OS is the operating system that runs Chromebooks and is based on Gentoo, which is an experts-only Linux. The good news is that you don't need to know a darn thing about Gentoo to use it. While you can get to old-school Linux from ChromeOS, you'd never need to look under the hood.\nAnyone can use Chrome OS. I mean, if you're reading this article via a web browser, which you almost certainly are, you already know how to use \"Linux\" enough to work with a Chromebook.\nHeck, you don't even need to buy a Chromebook to use Chrome OS, Google's ChromeOS Flex. enables you to convert pretty much any PC or Mac that's been built since 2007 into a much safer and more usable Chromebook clone. No fuss, no muss, and much more useful than whatever you're currently running on an older PC.\nFinally, if you want to get deeper into Linux, you can run Linux apps from your Chromebook, which helps convert it to a more traditional OS.\nChrome OS features: Price: Free | Core code: Gentoo Linux | Open source? Yes\nUbuntu was long considered the best Linux distribution for new users, and while others may take that title these days, it's still a great distro for newbies. That's because it's simple, beginner- and user-friendly, and has a great deal of community support. If you have a question, someone out there has almost certainly had the same problem and found an answer to it.\nBy default, Ubuntu uses the GNOME 3.x interface. It takes some learning if all you've known before is Windows, but it's really not that hard. Once you get accustomed to the interface, you'll see that it makes perfect sense (and you might even wonder why other desktop operating systems don't follow suit).\nWhile the most recent version of this Linux is Ubuntu 24.10, I recommend you use the current long-term support (LTS) version, Ubuntu 24.04. That edition has support for a dozen (yes, 12) years.\nUbuntu features: Price: Free for individuals/Variable commercial pricing | Core code: Linux Kernel: 6.5.0 | Open source? Yes\nSo, you really, really don't like the idea of even learning a little bit of GNOME. In that case, give Zorin OS a try. It's based on Ubuntu, as is Mint. But you can use its custom Zorin Appearance app to provide the desktop with a Windows look and feel. Or, for that matter, it can give you a Chromebook or Mac look and feel. Zorin's very flexible.\nZorin's whole reason for being is to help you move over from Windows or macOS to Linux. It also comes with documentation that's specifically designed to help you move from Windows to Linux. Zorin comes in three different versions: Core and Lite, which are free, and Pro, which can duplicate the Chromebook, macOS, or Windows look and feel, and costs $39. The Core edition really gives you everything you need, while the Lite version gives older machines a new lease on life. The most recent version, which is available for both the Core and Pro editions, is Zorin OS 17.\nAlso: Want to save your aging computer? Try these Linux distributions\nIf you prefer a Linux-style interface, all versions come with free GNOME and KDE front-ends. They may not be what you're used to, but they're still attractive, easy-to-use, and powerful.\nZorin OS features: Price: Two of the three versions are free; Pro costs $39 | Core code: Ubuntu | Open source? Yes\nA few years back, one of my favorite Linux desktops was MEPIS Linux. This Debian Linux-based distribution worked well. Eventually, though, its founder and maintainer, Warren Woodford, had to turn his attention to other businesses. MEPIS's fans joined forces with the related antiX Linux communities and revived the project as MX Linux.\nToday, it's a good, solid lightweight desktop that uses Xfce as its interface. It works well, and it's very popular. What I like most about it is that it's beginner-friendly, easy to pick up, and you can run it on even ancient Pentium II gear. In short, it's ideal if you want to get your feet wet with Linux on a PC that would otherwise be collecting dust in your closet.\nBut you don't have to take my word for it. On Distrowatch, the one site that tracks all the Linux desktops, in recent years, MX Linux is almost always at the top of the list. They must be doing something right.\nThe most recent edition available today is MX-Linux 23.5.\nMX Linux features: Price: Free | Core code: Debian | Open source? Yes\nFor a stretch of about five years, elementary OS was my default Linux distribution. I initially adopted it because of the elegant Pantheon desktop, which made using Linux a real treat. I continued using elementary OS because it never failed me. It was rock solid, easy to use, and performed like a champ, no matter how much time had passed. Eventually, I gave up elementary OS because I started purchasing System76 hardware that shipped with Pop! OS. However, I do miss those days of elementary OS. It really is that good.\nThe only caveat to using elementary OS is that the app center doesn't have nearly the amount of software found in, say, the Pop! OS Pop Shop or the Ubuntu Software app. Fortunately, however, elementary OS does ship with both Flatpak and Snap pre-installed, so you can install a wealth of applications from the command line (as neither Flatpak or Snap support is built into the graphical user interface).\nI would recommend elementary OS to any user looking to either migrate from MacOS or to a Linux distribution that offers a simple-to-use, beautiful interface and doesn't mind installing apps from the command line. The latest version if elementary OS 8.0. Give it a try. I think you'll be glad you did.\nelementary OS Features: Price: Free option available (Price is pay what you can) | Core code: Ubuntu LTS | Open source? Yes\nZDNET contributor Jack Wallen contributed to this story.\nWhat is the best Linux distro for beginners?\nMy pick for the best Linux distribution for beginners is Linux Mint. It has a user interface that looks and feels very much like Windows for easier transitioning, as well as a free and open-source code for making your own tweaks. The best part is that Linux Mint doesn't collect your data at all, so you can use it with confidence that your personal info won't end up on a server somewhere to be sold to advertisers.\n| Linux distro | Price | Core code | Open source? |\n| Linux Mint | Free | GNOME 2.x | Yes |\n| Chrome OS | Free | Gentoo Linux | Yes |\n| Ubuntu | Free for individuals/Variable commercial pricing | GNOME 3.x | Yes |\n| Zorin OS | Free for individuals/$39 for commercial license | Ubuntu | Yes |\n| MX Linux | Free | Debian | Yes |\n| elementary OS | Free option available (pay what you can) | Ubuntu LTS | Yes |\nSo, ready to give Linux a try? It's worked well for me for over 30 years, and it can work well for you for the next 30. While most desktops seem to be heading to a DaaS model--including Windows -- I can guarantee you Linux will still be available for your PC decades from now.\nWhich Linux distro for beginners is right for you?\n| Choose this... | If you want... |\n| Linux Mint | Windows-like feel and operation |\n| Chrome OS | A pick-up-and-play operating system |\n| Ubuntu | A more in-depth OS for learning code |\n| Zorin OS | Support for ChromeOS, Mac, and Windows-style interfaces. |\n| MX Linux | A robust online community for open-source code tweaking |\n| elementary OS | A user-friendly distribution with a similar UI to macOS |\nIn the end, the best Linux distro for you is whichever one feels the most familiar. Some of the picks on our list have user interfaces that are very, very close to older versions of Windows to make it easier to learn something new. Others allow for dual-booting so you can swap back and forth between operating systems when you want to poke around in Linux for an afternoon or need to get some work done in Windows.\nYou also want to choose a version of Linux that is supported by a robust online community of coders, documentation teams, and regular users. That way, if you have any issues with installation, downloading programs, or just general questions, you can get the help you need.\nHow did we choose these Linux distros for beginners?\nWhile compiling these picks, we paid careful attention to each Linux distribution's ease of use, price, and core code.\nCheck out: The 3 tiers of Linux distribution difficulty\n- Ease of use: Since these systems are for beginners, we considered how a novice would interact with the user experience of an operating system that isn't Windows or macOS. These beginner systems should feel familiar but not overwhelming.\n- Price: If you are new to Linux, you probably don't want to invest a sum of money into it if you are unfamiliar with the system. That's why we included picks that had free options as well as paid options.\n- Core code: A core Linux distro contains a kernel that helps you install the operating system. However, beginners can find this confusing. We considered which distros' core code would be easiest to navigate.\nFAQs on Linux distributions\nIs it hard to install applications on Linux?\nIt used to be hard to install programs on Linux, but that's no longer the case. Under the hood, things can still be complex, but now almost all distros have application stores. These make installing new programs as simple as pick and click.\nCan you get more from Linux than Windows or MacOS?\nYes, you can get a lot more from Linux if you know how to do shell programming and the like. But that's also true of Windows and PowerShell. With both operating systems, you don't need to know the deep ins and outs of either one to get your work done.\nSo why would you move? Well, for starters, Linux is far more secure than its rivals. Looking ahead, as Ed Bott points out, many of you may end up facing a security disaster if you keep using Windows 10.\nAlso, Linux, unlike Windows 11, will run on pretty much any PC you've got lying around. Linux doesn't require much in the way of a computer to do just fine. For example, I have a 2007-vintage HP Pavilion Media Center TV m7360n PC with a 2.8GHz Pentium D 920 dual-core processor, 2GBs of RAM, and a 300GB SATA drive PC that's still running Linux to this day. Good luck running any modern version of Windows on that!\nSure, it used to be hard to install programs on Linux, but that's no longer the case. Under the hood, things can still be complex, but now almost all distros have application stores. These days, installing Linux programs is as easy as picking and clicking.\nIf you still need some Windows programs, you can always try Crossover Linux to run them on Linux. It won't run all Windows apps by any means, but it runs many of them surprisingly well.\nIn any event, since most such programs, even Adobe PhotoShop are now available as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), there's less need than ever for Windows-specific programs. Indeed, we're moving to a business world where all you really need is a web browser to enable you to use a Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS) platform.\nThe future of the desktop aside, unlike Windows, where your only real choices today are Windows 10 or 11, there are hundreds of Linux desktop distributions. On top of those are numerous Linux desktop interfaces, each with its own distinctive look and feel, such as KDE, GNOME, Cinnamon, Lxde, Xfce, and many more. Most distributions have a primary user interface, such as Fedora and GNOME and OpenSUSE and KDE, but also enable you to pick from one to three others. Since you're just starting with Linux, I recommend you stick with the distro's main interface.\nWhat's a would-be Linux desktop user to do? Luckily for you, you don't have to try them all out to find a good fit. The key question is: \"What do you want to use Linux for?\" For beginners, I look at what's the easiest to pick up, the best overall Linux desktop, the simplest Linux for Windows users, and the easiest Linux for users with older machines.\nCan you run Windows programs on Linux?\nIf you still need some Windows programs, you can always try Crossover Linux to run them on Linux. It won't run all Windows apps by any means, but it runs many of them surprisingly well. Some Microsoft programs are now available natively on Linux. These include the Edge browser and Teams.\nYou can also run Windows 365 Cloud PC, a full Windows 10 or 11 cloud-based desktop, from Linux. This subscription service costs a pretty penny. Or, for free, you can run Microsoft 365 for the web (formerly Office 365), which gives you access to a subset of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote's functionality.\nDo you need security software on desktop Linux?\nNo, not really. True, while Linux is much safer than Windows, it's not totally immune from attacks. But, those attacks tend to be much rarer than those that plague Windows or macOS.\nThat said, you should still run a firewall, which Linux has built-in, and for stopping malware in its tracks you might consider installing ESET Endpoint AntiVirus for Linux or ClamAV."

      "text": "Linux has over 6% of the desktop market? Yes, you read that right - here's how\nAt long last, after years of waiting for the \"Year of the Linux desktop,\" we're getting somewhere.\nAccording to the US Federal Government Website and App Analytics, which I trust far more than I do StatCounter, 6% of its visitors over the last month were using Linux operating systems.\nDownright impressive\nThis website keeps track of US government website visits and analyzes them. On average, there have been 1.6 billion sessions in the last 30 days, with millions of users participating daily.\nIf you add in Android (16.2%) and Chromebooks (0.8%), you're talking about 23% of visitors using Linux, which puts it above MacOS (11.7%), Windows 10 (15.7%), and Windows 11 (15.3%), which is downright impressive. Take that, Windows.\nAlso: Yet another European government is ditching Microsoft for Linux - here's why\nThese numbers are based on billions of visits to over 400 US executive branch government domains. That's about 5,000 total websites, and it includes every Cabinet department. DAP gets its raw data from a Google Analytics account. DAP has open-sourced the code, which displays the data on the web, and its data-collection code. Best of all, unlike the others, you can download its data in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, allowing you to analyze the raw numbers yourself.\nAn all-time high\nThe feds aren't the only ones showing that the Linux desktop has become a real player.\nAccording to the web analysis company StatCounter, the US Linux desktop market has stepped over the 5% mark. To be exact, in June 2025, the Linux desktop reached a new high of 5.03%. Indeed, if you add in ChromeOS, a Linux distro that uses the Chrome web browser as its interface, the Linux desktop has reached an all-time high of 7.74%, according to StatCounter.\nAlso: 7 things every Linux beginner should know before downloading their first distro\nBefore you break out the champagne, though, keep in mind that StatCounter's numbers should be taken with a mountain of salt. Both Ed Bott and I find StatCounter's statistics to be questionable. As Bott recently said: \"StatCounter's 'market share' reports are a great excuse for tech bloggers to crank out a story each month, but they bear only the most casual relation to the real world, and most of those month-to-month spikes are simply statistical noise.\"\nWhy? StatCounter's methodology doesn't count PCs or users. Instead, it counts web pages containing its tracking code from over 1.5 million websites. Every month, the company records about 5 billion page views. For each page view, it records the browser and operating system.\nAlso: Want to save your old computer? Try one of these 8 Linux distros for free\nThat sounds good, but when it comes to counting users and their operating systems, it's very fuzzy. In other words, StatCounter's numbers are good for general trends, but you shouldn't rely on them for specifics.\nLinux is growing\nWith that in mind, there is good news for the Linux desktop. Over the last few years, Linux's desktop share has been slowly climbing, but its rate of growth has been accelerating. By StatCounter's numbers, in 2020, the Linux desktop only had about a 1.5% market share. In 2021, it touched 2%, and the following year it reached 2.76%. By 2023, it reached a new high of 3.12%. In 2024, it jumped to over 4%. In the global market, it's not yet at 5%, but it's still well above 4%.\nAlso: 5 of the easiest, quickest Linux distros to install - and I've tried them all\nThis means that, although we can't be certain of the exact numbers, Linux is clearly growing. Let's look closer.\nWhile I've been using Linux on my desktop since almost the beginning, it took nearly 20 years for it to reach a 1% market share on desktops -- but you used to need to be a techie to get the most out of Linux. After getting to 1% in approximately 2011, it took about a decade to double that to 2%. The jump from 2% to 3% took just over two years, and 3% to 4% took less than a year.\nAlso: You can try Linux without ditching Windows first - here's how\nGet the picture? The Linux desktop is growing, and it's growing fast.\nWant to join in?\nIf you got a Windows 10 PC that can't jump to Windows 11, there are plenty of easy-to-use Linux desktops that resemble Windows with which you can get started.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."
