With support from Jamus Andrest, Jon Dianora, Haley Thomas, Alex Manasseri, Robert Mathers, Leni Steinhardt, Nichole Pesaru, and Lisa Namerow. Special thanks to Ben Tinker and Nadia Kounang of CNN Health and Wendy Brundige.\n\nWelcome to Paging Dr. Gupta. This is the place I get to answer your health questions. I love doing it. So if you've got something on your mind, you've come to the right place. On this program, we try and take your real life questions and then do some homework and try and answer them for you using science and facts. Kyra, who do we have first today?\n\n'So let me reiterate and be very clear about this. No, that is not me. And it's not my colleague Anderson Cooper either who you hear in the clip as well. What you just heard is fake, a deepfake AI. Now look, this is going to become an increasing concern. So it's something we're going to all need to be more mindful about. And at the same time when it comes to medical things, there are a lot of people who want answers. They want real solutions, especially when it comes to things like Alzheimer's, how to prevent it, treat it, maybe even cure it. But to be clear, that's not what this is about. This is a total scam designed to take away your money. I'll tell you, you're not the only one asking this question, I've gotten so many voicemails, so many emails, so many people reaching out about this. People who I think are legitimately suffering, legitimately looking for some sort of answers, and think that maybe they've stumbled upon it. These ads are designed to look very convincing so don't feel bad if you've been fooled or duped by this. There are a couple things I do want you to keep in mind especially when it comes to potentially fake medical breakthroughs. Look and listen carefully. If something seems too good to be true, then it probably is, meaning it's not true. If the voice or the recording sounds off, pay attention to that. Maybe it's just something that you can't quite put your finger on. It sounds flat. It sounds unnatural. Be very skeptical of that. Lip sync issues. Do the lip movements match the words? That's something else you can find. If the face appears to be too smooth or alternatively too asymmetrical or if the lighting and background are inconsistent that usually means they are pulling from several different clips and trying to mash it together to make it look like just one thing. So if any or all of those things are true then there's a really good chance that what you're listening to or watching is AI-generated. You gotta trust your gut a bit on this one. Now if you do see something that sort of piques your interest, look at the source. Who put the video out? Is it a reputable organization? Then double check it, triple check it. See if you can find evidence of the so-called breakthrough on other sources. Something that you know is reputable. Something that you definitely trust. If it's me, and I'm talking about Alzheimer's disease, and I am talking about a big breakthrough, it's not gonna be on some shadowy social media site. I'm gonna proclaim it loud and clear, hopefully with a lot of evidence and a lot of context so it can be most helpful to you. So again, I'm glad the question was asked. It's been asked a lot, thousands of times to me personally just over the last couple of weeks. That is not me. I hope more than anyone that we develop some good breakthroughs when it comes to things like Alzheimer's. Be sure, if that happens, I'll make sure you know about it. After the break, what it means when prostate cancer spreads to the bone, and what you should watch for.\n\nHey, good afternoon, Sanjay. My name is Joe and I'm 71 years old. I was diagnosed with cancer, prostate cancer, five years ago. I'm currently under active surveillance. My question to you is how does one know whether or not prostate cancer cells have metastasized to bones or anywhere else in the body? Question that I've been struggling with here since we heard the news about President Biden. Um, and I was just wondering if you could help me. Thank you, doctor.\n\n'Okay, great question. First of all, as anyone with cancer knows, it can be tricky. It can be a tricky adversary. What sometimes happens is that cancer cells will leave the primary location and then travel, travel throughout the body, through the blood, through the lymph tissue to one or more parts of the body and then take up residence there. The cancer is then said to have metastasized. And, as a general rule, that is gonna make it more complicated to treat. So, to this question specifically, prostate cancer in particular, when it spreads, does tend to spread or metastasize to the bones, especially the spine and the pelvis, but it can affect other bones as well, the ribs and I've even seen prostate cancer spread to the skull. It can go to the lymph nodes. That's part of an interconnected system that helps the body filter fluids and help fight infections. Prostate cancer can even spread sometimes to other organs, particularly the lungs and the liver. Now, it can be sometimes tough to know just based on your symptoms if your cancer has metastasized. You might feel fatigued or generally unwell. You might begin to experience unexplained weight loss, but you might not have any symptoms at all. Now depending on were your cancer has metastasized, you might have specific symptoms related to that. So for bone metastases, the most common symptoms are going to be, no surprise, bone pain. And that bone pain can be a dull ache or it can be sudden and stabbing. It might get worse, might wake you up at night, you might develop bone weakness, maybe even bone fractures. If it's spreading to the lymph nodes, you might feel swelling and pain or tenderness in the area where the cancer has spread. But again, I wanna reiterate, you might not know at all. You might not have any symptoms at all or at least no new symptoms. So Joe, I think it's important to see your doctor if you feel off or if you're developing unusual symptoms. You may be the first line of detection when it comes to something like that. Afterwards, they can do a scan to determine if your cancer has spread. And as a general rule, the earlier that a problem is caught, the easier it will be to treat. So pay attention to those signs, especially if you know you have cancer and now you're worried about potential spread. So, Joe, thank you for calling in with your concern. And I'm certainly wishing both Joes, you and former President Joe Biden, good luck with your health and your treatment. That's all the time we have for today. Thanks to everyone who has been sending in questions. I love hearing from you. Your curiosity, your stories, your voice. It's really bringing this show to life. So keep the great questions coming. If there's something health-related you've been wondering about, send to us and we might answer it, next week even. Record a voice memo, email it to asksanjay@cnn.com. Or give us a call 470-396-0832. Thanks for listening, I'll be back next Tuesday.",

Kyra, who do we have first today?\nKyra Dahring\n00:00:27\nHi, Sanjay. So today's first question is very personal. It's actually about you. Here, take a listen.\nCaller, Helena\n00:00:36\nHi, my name is Helena, and I'm curious to see whether you're behind a product called IQ Blast. I saw a video that looks like you were featured in that, but I'm not sure if that's the real you or someone else. And that really will make a determination as to whether I purchase this product or not. Thank you.\nDr. Sanjay Gupta\n00:01:05\nOkay, thank you very much for this question. This has been something that's been on my mind a lot. So first of all, the short answer is no. That is not me in the video. But I want to fill you in on what's really happening here, after this.\nDr. Sanjay Gupta\n00:01:23\n'Okay, so the question was whether I was hawking, promoting, selling any brain-boosting products on the internet. There's one ad in particular that's been making a lot of rounds.\nFAKE AI Audio\n00:01:33\nThe key isn't some new drug. It all comes down to a simple honey recipe and a powerful traditional Indian root developed by Dr. Sanjay Gupta himself. I want to say that this is truly a landmark...\nDr. Sanjay Gupta\n00:01:44\n'So let me reiterate and be very clear about this. No, that is not me.
