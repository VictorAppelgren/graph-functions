  "content": "All of Apple's communication apps received updates with iOS 26, including FaceTime. There's a redesigned interface that puts more emphasis on your contacts, new translation features, and more.\n\nAlong with the Phone and Messages apps, \u200cFaceTime\u200c supports Live Translation as long as you have a phone that works with Apple Intelligence.\n\n\n\nWith Live Translation, you can video chat with someone who speaks a different language than you do. The \u200cFaceTime\u200c app displays live captions that are translated into your language as the person speaks. Your response can also be translated back into their language as long as they also have a device that supports \u200cApple Intelligence\u200c and runs \u200ciOS 26\u200c, iPadOS 26, or macOS 26.\n\nYou'll need to download language packs to use Live Translation, and it works with a limited number of languages. \u200cFaceTime\u200c's Live Translation feature works with English, French, German, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish (Spain).\n\nTo use Live Translation on a \u200cFaceTime\u200c call, initiate the call and then tap on the button with three dots. From there, tap on the Live Translation option and select the to and from languages. Everything spoken will be translated and displayed in the same way Live Captions are displayed. To stop a translation, just tap on the Stop button.\n\nApple updated the \u200cFaceTime\u200c interface in \u200ciOS 26\u200c. Rather than a list of names of recent and suggested contacts, you'll see a card-style view that includes a full image of your contact that they've shared, if one is available. If they've sent you a video message, that will automatically play in the background as you scroll for an animated look. You can tap on one of the cards to place a \u200cFaceTime\u200c Audio or \u200cFaceTime\u200c Video call, depending on how you last contacted them.\n\n\n\nLong pressing on a card brings up an option to delete it.\n\nThe \"New Call\" button is at the bottom of the \u200cFaceTime\u200c app rather than at the top, and filtering options can be accessed by tapping on the menu button at the top right. When you're on a call, the buttons are now at the bottom right of the display.\n\n\n\nLike all of Apple's other apps, \u200cFaceTime\u200c adopts the Liquid Glass aesthetic. Contact cards feature rounded corners, buttons have a rounded design, and the New Call button and some of the other interface buttons have a glass-like design.\n\nLike the Phone app, \u200cFaceTime\u200c has new call filtering options. There's still a Silence Unknown Callers toggle, but missed calls and voicemails from unsaved numbers will now be sorted into an Unknown Callers list that's hidden from view unless you select it.\n\n\n\nCalls that are identified as spam will be silenced and automatically added to a new Spam list.\n\nCall filtering is opt-in, so if you often get calls from unknown numbers, you can turn it on. If you don't want to miss any calls, you can leave it off. The toggle for spam and unknown callers can be found in the \u200cFaceTime\u200c section of the Settings app under Call Filtering.\n\nIn the \u200cFaceTime\u200c app, you can get to the different filtered sections by tapping on the menu button in the upper right of the app. Sections include Calls, Missed, Video, Voicemail, Unknown Callers, and Spam.\n\nIn \u200ciOS 26\u200c, the Sensitive Content Warning and Communication Safety features are available for \u200cFaceTime\u200c video calls. When nudity is detected, the \u200cFaceTime\u200c video will pause and a warning about nude content will be displayed.\n\n\n\nCommunication Safety is a feature that is designed for the accounts of children and teens, and it provides warnings if images and videos of nudity are detected. Communication Safety is on by default for accounts created for children up to age 17.\n\nAdults can use Communication Safety features too, in the form of Sensitive Content Warnings. Sensitive Content Warnings are an opt-in feature that prevents users of all ages from being subject to unwanted nude photos and videos.\n\nBoth options blur nudity in the Messages app and pause video in \u200cFaceTime\u200c. There is no situation where an adult will see their \u200cFaceTime\u200c calls paused for nudity unless they have turned on the Sensitive Content Warning feature.\n\nSensitive Content Warnings can be turned on in the Privacy and Security section of the Settings app. Adults can also opt to turn on Communication Safety in the Screen Time section of the Settings app.\n\nSensitive Content Warnings and Communication Safety use on-device machine learning to analyze photos and videos. Apple does not receive an alert that nudity was detected, and does not have access to any photos or videos.\n\nWe have a dedicated iOS 26 roundup that goes into detail on all of the new features that are available in the update.",

      "text": "iPadOS 26\nApple's next-generation operating system for the iPad, coming in fall 2025.\niPadOS 26 - What's New\nContents\n- iPadOS 26 - What's New\n- iPadOS 18 to iPadOS 26\n- Design Changes\n- Multitasking and Windowing\n- Home Screen and Lock Screen\n- Messages\n- Phone\n- Apple Music\n- Shortcuts\n- Other New App Features\n- Battery Settings\n- Apple Intelligence Updates\n- New AirPods Features\n- Smaller Changes\n- Accessibility\n- Compatibility\n- iPadOS 26 Launch Date\n- iPadOS 26 Timeline\nApple unveiled the newest version of iPadOS, iPadOS 26, at the 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference in June. If you were expecting iPadOS 19, you might be a little surprised to see Apple jump to iPadOS 26, but the new number reflects the 2025\u20132026 release season for the software update. It lets Apple use the same number across all of its updates, so there's no more confusion since you're no longer downloading iOS, macOS, visionOS, and watchOS all with different numbers.\niPadOS 26 brings the first new major design change that Apple has brought to iOS since iOS 7. Liquid Glass reflects and refracts its surroundings, while putting more focus on content. Many interface elements are almost entirely translucent, and the design extends to controls, navigation, app icons, menus, buttons, and widgets.\nLiquid Glass transforms depending on content or context, and it behaves like glass in the real world, so color bleeds through from the background, and it is able to adapt well between light and dark elements. Liquid Glass uses real-time rendering and can dynamically react to movement to change the way that light reflects off of buttons, switches, sliders, side bars, tab bars, and more.\nYou'll see Liquid Glass throughout iPadOS 26, in all of Apple's apps, in notifications, on the Lock Screen, in Control Center, and on the Home Screen. Apple is also providing developers with tools to bring the new material to their own apps for a cohesive look. Liquid Glass extends to iOS 26, macOS Tahoe, visionOS 26, tvOS 26, and watchOS 26.\nThe Liquid Glass design overhaul isn't just a glossy finish, it also brings updates to the design of controls, toolbars, and navigation throughout iPadOS 26. App windows, menu bars, and other interface elements have more rounded corners, and controls feature a distinct functional layer designed to sit above apps. These kinds of menus can dynamically morph to provide users with more options in an app.\nThe Lock Screen features a spatial scene option for photo wallpapers, giving them a 3D look and a sense of movement. The Home Screen might look different with an option for translucent icons and widgets, but it is functionally the same.\nApple streamlined the Camera app layout with simpler navigation. It has Photo and Video toggles, with other options tucked away behind menus that expand out with a tap. You can swipe to get to more photo and video options. Apple also updated the Photos app to re-add separate tabs for the Library and Collections views. In Photos, you can also activate Spatial Scene for any image, getting a unique 3D view of the image.\nSafari has a new look, and Apple has updated navigation. By default, Safari adopts the more rounded Liquid Glass buttons and nixes the settings at the bottom of the app, but there's an option to bring them back with a floating tab bar if you prefer a more feature rich menu. Apple Music, News, and Podcasts all have a new tab bar that floats above the content in the app and dynamically shrinks when users are browsing, so the interface options take up less space on the display.\nApple has introduced a whole new multitasking and windowing system. The iPad is more like the Mac than ever, with the option to open multiple app windows and place and resize them as needed much like on the Mac. iPad apps now have menu bars and Mac-style window controls for closing, minimizing, resizing, and tiling windows.\nExpos\u00e9 is available on the iPad, so users can see all of the apps they have open with a tap. Apple removed Slide Over and Split View, but Stage Manager is still available for those who want to group their different windows together. External displays are supported for using even more apps at once. The iPad's cursor is now like the Mac cursor, and with the Magic Keyboard, the trackpad feels more like the Mac trackpad too.\nAlong with a new design and updated multitasking features, Apple is expanding the Apple Intelligence features that are available on the iPad. Messages, FaceTime, and a new Phone app for the iPad all support Live Translation for automatically translating conversations when you're conversing with someone who speaks another language.\nImage Playground supports ChatGPT image generation so you can create images in more styles. Genmoji has a new feature for mixing multiple emoji characters to make a new one, and adding descriptions to create an all-new emoji character.\nThe Shortcuts app supports intelligent actions that can summarize text, create images, or tap into Apple Intelligence models, making it easier than ever to create automations. Reminders is able to suggest tasks, grocery items and follow-ups based on emails, and it can automatically categorize related reminders into sections.\nFor developers, Apple is debuting a new Foundation Models framework that allows developers to tap into the AI model that's at the core of Apple Intelligence, so developers can add new AI features to their apps.\nApple brought the Phone app to the iPad for the first time, and it works through a connected iPhone with Wi-Fi calling. The Phone app has a whole slew of features that are new on both the iPhone and the iPad. There's a unified layout that combines Favorites, Recents, and Voicemails. A new Call Screening feature asks unknown callers for their name and reason for calling before sending the call to you, stopping unwanted calls. When you're stuck on hold, there's a Hold Assist option that stays on the line for you, so you don't have to listen to irritating hold music. It lets you know when a live agent is available.\nMessages can screen texts from unknown senders, sending them silently to a dedicated folder where users can ask for more information or delete them. Group texts now have typing indicators and support for sending and receiving Apple Cash, plus Messages adds customizable backgrounds for each conversation and polls.\nIn Apple Music, there's a Lyrics Translation feature that translates lyrics that aren't in your language, and Lyrics Pronunciation helps you pronounce those lyrics. A new AutoMix feature uses intelligence to transition from one song to another, using time stretching and beat matching for a seamless shift between songs.\nApple added a new Apple Games app that's an all-in-one destination for discovering and playing games. It supports recommendations, leaderboards, competitions with friends, and more.\nNote: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here.\niPadOS 18 to iPadOS 26\nIf you're wondering why Apple went from iPadOS 18 to iPadOS 26, it was to streamline operating system naming. Apple is numbering all of its operating systems with the year going forward, so the \"26\" in iPadOS 26 represents the release season between September 2025 and September 2026.\nEverything released this year uses the same number, so iOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, and so on. It's meant to help keep numbering more straightforward in the future, even if it seems strange to skip iPadOS 19 and go right to iPadOS 26.\nDesign Changes\nThe biggest single change in iPadOS 26 is the design overhaul. Apple is using a new Liquid Glass material throughout iOS and iPadOS, and it has transformed the look of the iPad's software.\nLiquid Glass is translucent, and like real glass, it allows light and color to shine through to put the focus on the content that's on your iPad's display. Apple designed Liquid Glass to behave like it does in the real world, so it can subtly reflect light when you move your iPad. It uses real-time rendering to dynamically react to movement with reflective highlights.\nApp icons are meant to look like several layers of glass, which gives them a subtle depth. Liquid Glass works well for the standard color icons, but Apple also added a translucent app icon option that makes your iPad look even more like a sheet of glass.\nPop Out Menus\nIn several places, Apple streamlined navigation and moved extra settings into pop out menus. In the Camera app, for example, Apple shows just the two main modes: photo and video. But if you tap on one of the buttons, you'll see a pop out menu with a range of quick access photo settings that you can activate.\nApple says it wanted controls, toolbars, and navigation to have a distinct functional layer that sits above apps, morphing and dynamically changing as users need to access more options.\nDisappearing Navigation\nIn several places, navigation elements disappear when they're not needed, and appear when they are. An example of this is in Safari at smaller window sizes. When you scroll down, the navigation bar with controls collapse down into a smaller bar to reveal more of the content on the page. Scrolling back up brings back the full Safari bar so you can use the interface buttons that you need.\nCorners and Spacing\nIn areas with a long list of options or categories, such as the Settings app, Apple has increased spacing and padding for a less cluttered look. You need to scroll longer to get through settings now, but there's more space to tap and it can be more readable with the additional spacing.\nApple shrunk navigation bars at the bottom of apps, so they take up less display space. A good example of this is in the Photos app, where the editing options have been condensed down into a smaller bar.\nNavigation bars, side bars, card-style menus, notifications, buttons, toggles, search bars, and other interface elements have a more rounded look. Single buttons are entirely circular, such as those in Control Center, while navigation bars are pill-shaped with distinctly round corners. Toggles and notifications have an elongated pill-shape too, and cards are also more rounded in appearance at the corners. The keyboard has round edges at the top.\nCross-Platform Cohesiveness\nLiquid Glass is not exclusive to iPadOS 26. The new design extends to all of Apple's operating systems, including iOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, and of course, visionOS 26, which is the OS that inspired the overhaul.\nWith the same design available across all of Apple's operating systems, everything feels more cohesive, which was one of Apple's main goals with Liquid Glass.\nDesign Summary\n- Everything looks different in iPadOS 26.\n- There's an emphasis on content, with Apple aiming to make everything else fade away.\n- Interface elements are made from Liquid Glass, which is translucent and designed to work like glass in the real world. Colors and content shine through, and everything has a more liquid feel.\n- Almost all interface elements are rounder.\n- Navigation elements and settings are meant to hide away when you don't need them. If you're missing a setting, it's likely you'll find it in a pop out menu when you tap on a single icon.\n- Liquid Glass is system wide. Apple's apps have been redesigned with it to varying degrees, and third-party apps will also adopt the design language.\nMultitasking and Windowing\nApple overhauled how multitasking and windowing work on the iPad, so now it offers a much more Mac-like experience.\nWindows\nYou can open multiple app windows at one time, and drag them anywhere on the display. They can overlap and move slightly offscreen, just like on the Mac. On some older iPads, you're limited to four open app windows, but on newer Apple silicon models, you can have far more.\nThere are multiple tiling options for open windows. You can arrange windows with a quick flick, and split your screen for two apps, three apps, or four apps. Tiling options can also be accessed from the menu bar.\nExternal displays increase the visual space for your open windows, and using an iPad with an external display makes much more sense with the updated organizational system.\nThe iPad remembers the sizing and placement of apps, so if you close an app and then open it again, it reappears in the same size and position.\nWith the new multitasking features, Apple eliminated the previous Split View and Slide Over options for window tiling and viewing multiple apps, but Stage Manager still exists for those who want to group their windows together.\nStage Manager\nWith iPadOS 26, Stage Manager is expanding to a larger number of iPad Models. All iPads that are compatible with iPadOS 26 have access to Stage Manager, so the feature is now available on the third-generation iPad Air and later, 5th-generation iPad mini and later, and 8th-generation iPad and later.\nStage Manager supports arranging multiple app windows in groups to improve multitasking. Stage Manager continues to be an opt-in feature, and it pairs with the iPadOS 26 multitasking features.\nMenu Bars\niPad apps now have Mac-style menu bars at the top of them, so you can get quick access to settings. There are Mac-style traffic light buttons for resizing, closing, and expanding iPad windows. Menu bars can be accessed with a swipe down from the top of the iPad's display.\nThird-party developers can also create custom menu bars for their iPad apps.\nExpos\u00e9\nThe Mac's Expos\u00e9 feature for showing you everything you have open is now available on the iPad. You can swipe up to see all of your windows spread out, and then tap on one to bring it to the front.\nDock\nFolders can go in the dock, which makes them quicker to access when you need something.\nFiles App\nThe Files app supports a new list view with resizable columns and collapsible folders for the first time, so you can better see what's in a folder without having to open the entire thing.\nYou can set default apps for opening different file types, and folders can be customized with colors and emoji to make them easier to find.\nBackground Tasks\niPadOS 26 supports background tasks, so you can download or export large files or run other system intensive tasks while using your iPad like normal. When a background task is in progress, it can be tracked with Live Activities.\nHome Screen and Lock Screen\nOn the Lock Screen, there are two key changes beyond design updates. The time can auto adjust to be larger when your wallpaper allows for more space, and there is an option to enable a 2D to 3D spatial photo effect that adds depth to your wallpaper images.\nThe size of the time adjusts automatically in some cases, but you can also drag the bar at the corner to resize it to make it bigger. Note that you need to use the first font in the font list, because it's the only one that can be resized.\nWhen choosing a photo for a wallpaper, there is an option to use a 2D image to generate a 3D \"Spatial Scene\" that uses depth information to separate the subject from the background. The Spatial Scene wallpaper features a little bit of motion when you move your iPad, enhancing the 3D effect.\nMost of the Home Screen is the same, aside from the Liquid Glass design changes. You can tap into Edit > Customize to select a new \"Clear\" option that gives all of your app icons a translucent, Liquid Glass look.\nMessages\nThe Messages app features customized backgrounds, an option to create polls, live translation, and enhanced spam filtering and blocking features.\n- Customizable backgrounds - In an individual or group conversation, you can tap on the name at the top and then choose the \"Backgrounds\" option to set a custom background for each conversation. There are options like sky, water, and aurora, or you can choose a color. You can also select photos or generate a background with Image Playground. Backgrounds that you set are changed for every participant in the conversation, unless they toggle off the feature in Messages settings.\n- Polls - Tap on the \"+\" button to get to a new option to create a poll in any chat. You can add up to 12 different options, then send it to allow people to vote. Others can also add options to the list. On devices with Apple Intelligence, polls may come up as a suggestion.\n- Group chats - Group chats support typing indicators and sending and receiving Apple Cash. There's also an option to add someone in a group chat who isn't in your contacts to your Contacts app with a tap.\n- Natural language search - Messages supports natural language search.\n- Copy/paste - You can now select just part of a text message to copy. Long press and tap on the new \"Select\" option to do so.\n- Spam messages - Spam messages and Unknown Senders are two separate categories in iPadOS 26. There's a new Filter box at the top right of the Messages app, and Unknown Senders go in one category, while Spam goes in another. A badge lets you know if you have messages in these categories, but you won't get notifications for them.\n- Unknown Senders - Messages from Unknown Senders won't send notifications if the option to filter them is on, but you still get alerts if it is a time sensitive notification, such as a notification from a ride share app or a delivery person.\n- Live Translation - Messages that aren't in your language can be automatically translated as you receive them in iPadOS 26. Apple Intelligence is required for this feature.\nPhone\nThe Phone app is new to the iPad, and it is designed to work through Wi-Fi calling. Calls are routed through your iPhone and can be answered and managed on your iPad. The Phone app includes multiple new features that are designed to cut down on unwanted calls and reduce the amount of time that you need to spend on the phone.\nCall Screening\nCall Screening is an extension of Live Voicemail. When you receive a call from an unknown number that is not in your list of contacts, your device asks the caller for their name and reason for calling. The information is relayed to you so you can decide if you want to accept the call or ignore it.\nCall Screening can be enabled in the Phone section of the Settings app.\nHold Assist\nIf you make a phone call and you're stuck on hold waiting to speak to a person, you can activate Hold Assist. Your iPad can wait for you while you do other things, and then let you know when a live agent is on the line. The agent is informed that you'll be on the call in just a moment.\nTo use Hold Assist, tap on the \"Hold\" button after placing a call.\nLive Translation\nWhen talking to someone who speaks another language, there is an option to turn on Live Translation to have the call automatically translated for each person on the line. Live Translation is an Apple Intelligence feature and requires an Apple silicon iPad or the A17 Pro iPad mini.\nOther Features\n- Contact Posters - Incoming calls feature large contact posters for improved personalization.\n- Unified Layout - The Phone app has an optional unified layout that combines Favorites, Recents, and Voicemails in one spot.\n- Spam calls - Calls identified as spam can be silenced and sent directly to voicemail.\n- Call History - Tapping on the info button next to a call in the recents list or on a name or number in the unified view shows a call history that lists every time you've spoken with someone.\n- Flag spam voicemails - If you tap into a voicemail from a person not in your contact list, you'll see an option to report the voicemail as spam.\n- Screen sharing - The Phone app supports screen sharing and SharePlay during phone calls.\nApple Music\nThere are several new Apple Music features, ranging from translation to new options for transitioning between songs.\nAutoMix\nApple Music includes AutoMix, a feature that transitions from one song to another as the song that's playing ends. It uses time stretching and beat mixing for a seamless shift, and Apple says that it's meant to work like a DJ.\nSongs transition at the \"perfect moment\" based on an analysis of the key and tempo of the music, with AutoMix serving as an alternative to Crossfade.\nOther New Features\n- Lyrics Translation - Songs that are in another language can be translated automatically with Lyrics Translation.\n- Lyrics Pronunciation - Lyrics Pronunciation helps you pronounce lyrics that are in another language.\n- Pinned playlists - Apple Music playlists can now be pinned to the top of the Music app, with pinned playlists accessible in a new Home Screen widget as well.\n- Playlist folders - Playlists can be organized into folders.\n- Lock Screen - On the Lock Screen, the Now Playing widget now provides full screen album artwork. Album art animates based on what you're listening to.\nShortcuts\nThe Shortcuts app now features Apple Intelligence, and the option to use Apple's AI models when creating shortcuts. Apple Intelligence models can be used for summarizing PDFs, generating recipes, answering questions, and more. Writing Tools and Image Playground are available for spellchecking, image generation, rewriting, tone changes, and more.\nApple offers several pre-programmed Shortcuts in the Gallery that use Apple Intelligence, such as options for getting a morning summary of the coming day, generating a haiku, or summarizing a PDF.\nWhen creating a shortcut, there is an Apple Intelligence section that includes options for an on-device model, a cloud model that uses Private Cloud Compute, or ChatGPT. Some pre-set options are available, such as generating an image with Image Playground or using Writing Tools, along with the option to use a model.\nSelecting one of the AI models provides an open-ended prompt where you can write in what you want it to do. You need to work in the confines of the model that Apple provides, pairing it with other functionality in Shortcuts.\nOther New App Features\nSafari\n- Tabs - Safari has a new look for the tab bar, with more rounded edges between the active tab and the tab next to it.\n- Liquid Glass - There is an option to hide the tab bar when scrolling.\n- Tracking Prevention - Advanced fingerprinting protection extends to all browsing by default. Advanced fingerprinting protection prevents websites from tracking your device usage across websites. Previously, this was limited to private browsing unless explicitly enabled.\n- Web apps - Every website added to the Home Screen through Safari opens a web app, even if it is not configured that way. In earlier versions of iOS, websites added to the Home Screen that were not properly configured would open in Safari.\n- HDR images - Safari supports HDR images in iPadOS 26.\n- SVG icons - Safari supports the SVG file format for icons in the bookmark bar and start page.\nCamera\n- Design - The Camera app has a simplified design with just Photo and Video tabs. Swiping up or down expands to other photo modes, and tapping on one of the buttons expands the available settings.\n- Lens - If the Camera lens is dirty, your iPad lets you know that it needs to be cleaned.\n- AirPods - The AirPods 4 or AirPods Pro 2 can be used to take a photo or start a video recording by pressing and holding on the stem.\nPhotos\n- Search - Video thumbnails show up in search results.\n- Spatial Scenes - You can use a new 3D feature to turn 2D photos into 3D images, adding subtle depth and motion that separates the subject from the background.\nNotes\n- Markdown - The Notes app supports exporting in Markdown.\n- Math Notes - Three variable equations can be used to create 3D graphs.\n- Call Recordings - Conversations from the Phone app can be saved as audio recordings with transcriptions in the Notes app. Transcriptions require Apple Intelligence.\nReminders\n- Categorization - Apple Intelligence can categorize reminders into different sections.\n- Suggestions - Apple Intelligence can suggest adding tasks, grocery items, and more to Reminders based on what's on your iPad.\nFaceTime\n- Live Translation - FaceTime supports Live Translation, displaying captions if you're talking to someone who speaks another language.\n- Call Screening - FaceTime has new screening features for unknown numbers. Calls from unknown numbers can be asked for more information like name and reason for calling, or they can be sent directly to voicemail. Missed calls from unknown numbers can be silenced and sent to an Unknown Callers list.\nPodcasts\n- Enhance Dialogue - An Enhance Dialogue option mutes background sounds to enhance speech.\n- Playback speed - There are more options for playback speeds, ranging from 0.5x to 3x.\nGames\niPadOS 26 includes a Games app that comes pre-installed on the iPad.

It can be used for creating, viewing, and editing PDFs. There are also tools for cropping, flipping, rotating, resizing, and editing images.\nThe Preview app on the iPad is compatible with the Apple Pencil, so you can mark up PDFs and images with Apple's stylus.\nJournal\nApple brought the Journal app to the iPad in iPadOS 26, and added new features.\n- Handwriting support - The Journal app on iPad supports handwriting with the Apple Pencil, as well as drawings.\n- Multiple Journals - You can now create more than one journal if you want to separate your entries by topic.\n- Maps - Journal entries can be viewed on a map.\n- Images - There's support for adding images inline with text.\nBattery Settings\nApple updated the Battery section of the Settings app to provide a more in-depth look at how iPad usage impacts battery life, and how much battery apps are draining.\nThe Battery section now displays a weekly view of battery usage along with a comparison of how much battery you're currently using compared to your typical average. You can see if you're using more, the same, or less battery life than you do on most days, with a readout of which apps are using the most battery, and by how much.\nApp battery usage includes specific details, such as letting you know if an app ran in the background longer, was on your screen longer, or sent more notifications than normal. You'll also see how much battery you've used since your last charge.\nOn the Lock Screen and in the Battery section, you'll see information on how long it's going to take your iPad to charge up to full when it's plugged in.\nApple Intelligence Updates\nThere are new Apple Intelligence features throughout iPadOS 26, such as the Live Translation options in Phone, Messages, and FaceTime, and the suggestions and sorting options in the Reminders app. Some existing Apple Intelligence features have also been updated.\nGenmoji\nGenmoji supports combining two or more emoji together to create a new character. You can also combine existing emoji with text-based descriptions to tweak them, which is a more convenient starting point for generating something new.\nImage Playground\nApple added support for ChatGPT image generation capabilities, which means you can use several ChatGPT image styles when generating images. Options include Anime, Oil Painting, Watercolor, Vector, and Print.\nThere's also an open-ended option where you can tell ChatGPT what style you want, and you can make realistic images with this option. The new ChatGPT styles join the existing Animation, Sketch, and Illustration styles.\nNote that generating images with ChatGPT is limited if you do not have a ChatGPT subscription, so you cannot freely use the ChatGPT styles.\nChatGPT\nWith iPadOS 26, the ChatGPT Siri integration will use OpenAI's new GPT-5 model rather than GPT-4.\nGPT-5 brings enhanced reasoning capabilities and coding tools, along with better voice interaction and video perception.\nNew AirPods Features\niPadOS 26 adds several new features to the AirPods Pro 2 and the AirPods 4 through an accompanying AirPods firmware update.\nImproved Audio Quality\nThe studio-quality recording feature with Voice Isolation brings more natural vocal texture and clarity to iPad calls, FaceTime calls, and all CallKit-enabled apps like Zoom.\nBoth studio-quality audio recording and improved call quality are available across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and support the Camera app, Voice Memos, Messages dictation, third-party camera apps, and video conferencing apps.\niPad users can choose different microphones for each app, and for different websites, too.\nSoftware Updates\nWith the latest software updates, Apple is finally adding a way to manually update the firmware on your AirPods. When your AirPods are connected, you can go to the Settings app to get to a new software update interface.\nPause for Sleep\nIf you're listening to music, a podcast, or a book while you're in bed and you're wearing AirPods, the AirPods can pause your audio when you fall asleep.\nSmaller Changes\nThere are dozens if not hundreds of smaller changes in iPadOS 26, and we've highlighted some of the more notable ones below.\n- Local Capture - Local capture lets users produce high-quality recordings from the iPad using any video conferencing app, with audio and video files able to be shared when a call is over.

The labels let users know if features like VoiceOver, Voice Control, Captions, Reduced Motion, and other accessibility options are supported in apps.\nAccessibility Reader\nAccessibility Reader is a systemwide reading mode that makes text easier to read for users with a range of disabilities. It includes multiple text customization features with options for adjusting font, color, spacing, and more. Accessibility Reader can be launched from any app and is built into the Magnifier app.\nBraille Access\nBraille Access turns an iPhone or iPad into a braille note taking device integrated in the Apple ecosystem. Users can open any app with Braille Screen Input or a connected braille device, for quick note taking in braille format. Braille Ready Format files can be opened from Braille Access, and an integrated form of Live Captions is supported.\n- Background Sounds - There are new Background Sounds options, including Babble, Steam, Airplane, Boat, Bus, Train, Rain on Roof, and Quiet Night.\n- Personal Voice - The Personal Voice feature that lets users preserve their voice is faster, easier, and more powerful. It takes advantage of advances in on-device machine learning to create a smoother, more natural-sounding voice in less than a minute. Apple is also adding support for Spanish.\n- Vehicle Motion Cues - Apple is adding new customization options for the animated onscreen dots used by Vehicle Motion Cues.\n- Eye Tracking - Eye Tracking lets users choose to use a switch or dwell for making selections. There's also a new keyboard dwell timer for typing and reduced steps when typing with switches.\n- Head Tracking - Users can more easily control iPhone and iPad with head movements.\n- Brain Computer Interfaces - For users that have Brain Computer Interface devices, Apple is adding a protocol that supports Switch Control, a technology that letsusers control their device without physical movement.\n- Assistive Access - This setting is getting a custom Apple TV app with a simplified media player.\n- Sound Recognition - Sound Recognition is gaining Name Recognition, so users who are deaf or hard of hearing can be alerted when their name is being called.\n- Live Captions - For Live Captions, Apple is adding support for English (India, Australia, UK, Singapore), Mandarin Chinese (Mainland China), Cantonese (Mainland China, Hong Kong), Spanish (Latin America, Spain), French (France, Canada), Japanese, German (Germany), and Korean.\n- Sharing - A Share Accessibility Settings option lets users quickly and temporarily share their accessibility settings with another iPhone or iPad, which Apple says is useful for borrowing a friend's device.\nCompatibility\nMost iPads able to run iPadOS 18 support iPadOS 26, with the exception of the 7th-generation low-cost iPad. A list of iPads compatible with iPadOS 26 is below.\n- iPad Pro (M4)\n- iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation and later)\n- iPad Pro 11-inch (1st generation and later)\n- iPad Air (M2 and later)\n- iPad Air (3rd generation and later)\n- iPad (A16)\n- iPad (8th generation and later)\n- iPad mini (A17 Pro)\n- iPad mini (5th generation and later)\nWhile these iPads support iPadOS 26, advanced features may be limited to newer iPads with faster processors, including the A17 Pro and the M1 and later.\niPadOS 26 Launch Date\nApple previewed iPadOS 26 at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June 2025, and made it available to developers for testing purposes.

      "text": "FaceTime is Apple's video and audio chatting platform that lets iPhone users communicate with one another through the standard FaceTime video protocol or using the FaceTime audio feature.\nAs a key iPhone, iPad, and Mac feature, FaceTime is widely known, but if you're new to FaceTime, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know. Even established FaceTime users may learn a trick or two.\nSetting Up FaceTime\nIf you have an iPhone, FaceTime, much like iMessage, is activated automatically using your phone number, but you can also choose to use it with an email address instead. Getting FaceTime up and running happens automatically after your iPhone is activated with a SIM card, but if for some reason it's not working or it's been turned off, you can follow the steps in the how to below.\nWhen you use an iPhone with FaceTime, your other devices can also use your phone number to place FaceTime calls so long as you are signed into the same iCloud account on all of them.\nIf you don't have an iPhone, FaceTime can be set up on an iPad, iPod touch, or Mac through the FaceTime app using an email address.\n- How to Set Up FaceTime on an iPhone\n- How to Set up FaceTime on an iPad\n- How to Set Up FaceTime on a Mac\n- How to Turn Off FaceTime\nThere is no option to entirely remove a phone number from FaceTime, though if you have an iPhone with dual-SIM capabilities, you can choose between two different numbers. You can choose to use an email address with FaceTime instead of a phone number, and there are also options to change the email address that you're using.\n- How to Use FaceTime With an Email Address Instead of a Phone Number\n- How to Change Your FaceTime Email Address\nFaceTime Video vs. FaceTime Audio\nThere are two ways to use FaceTime. You can use FaceTime video, which is the standard way to use FaceTime with a two-way video connection (or more, with Group FaceTime), or you can use FaceTime Audio, which, as the name suggests, is an audio-only option.\nFaceTime video is great for when you want to see the person on the other end of the call, while FaceTime Audio is basically akin to a voice-based phone call. FaceTime Audio often offers better call quality than a regular phone call because it's a VoIP service similar to something like Skype.\n- How to Make a FaceTime Call\n- How to Make a FaceTime Audio Call\n- How to Make a FaceTime Call With Siri\n- How to Switch From FaceTime Video to FaceTime Audio\n- How to Switch From FaceTime Audio to FaceTime Video\n- How to Switch from a Regular Phone Call to FaceTime\n- How to Mirror a FaceTime Call to Apple TV or an AirPlay 2-Compatible Smart TV\n- How to Record a FaceTime Call on Your Mac\nDevices Compatible With FaceTime\nFaceTime is an app that's available across Apple devices. FaceTime Video and FaceTime Audio work on the iPhone, iPod touch, iPad, and Mac.\nYou can answer and place FaceTime Audio calls on the HomePod and the Apple Watch, but video calls do not work on these devices.\nMaking a FaceTime Video Call\nMaking a FaceTime video call is as simple as opening up the FaceTime app on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, tapping the \"New FaceTime\" button, choosing a contact, and tapping on the \"FaceTime\" option for video, or the little phone icon for audio.\nFaceTime can also be initiated through the Contacts app by selecting a contact and choosing the FaceTime option, or through the Messages app by tapping on a person's name in an iMessage thread and then choosing the FaceTime option. You can also set up Favorites through the Contacts app and make a FaceTime call through the Phone app (iPhone) or through the Favorites widget in the Today section of the Notification Center (iPhone and iPad).\nNote that you can choose from FaceTime Audio or Video in the FaceTime app, but initiating FaceTime through Contacts or Messages initiates a video call right away.\nWhen you initiate a FaceTime call with someone, the front-facing camera on your Mac, iPad, or iPhone will activate so that the person on the other end can see you. Unlike with a phone call, FaceTime calls often reach the other person near instantaneously.\nAnswering an incoming FaceTime video call will also activate the front-facing camera on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac because FaceTime is primarily a video chatting platform.\nMaking a FaceTime Audio Call\nIf you want to initiate a call with someone but want to use voice chat instead of video, you can use FaceTime Audio. Unlike a traditional phone call, FaceTime Audio can be placed on the iPhone, iPad, or Mac, and it uses either a WiFi or cellular connection.\nFaceTime Audio can be preferable to a standard phone call because it's often higher quality because it uses a higher-quality codec that exceeds even HD voice services offered by carriers.\nA FaceTime Audio call is easiest to place in the FaceTime app by choosing a person to contact and then tapping the phone icon instead of the FaceTime option. The other option for FaceTime Audio is using Favorites set up in the Phone app or the Favorites Widget in the Notification Center.\nYou can also activate FaceTime Audio in Messages by tapping on a contact and then choosing the \"Audio\" option, or in the Contacts app by tapping on the phone icon under the FaceTime heading. FaceTime Audio is the only version of FaceTime that works on the Apple Watch.\nFaceTime on Android and PCs\nAs of iOS 15, FaceTime can be used across different platforms. Apple created FaceTime links because there's a new option to join FaceTime calls on the web, which means PC and Android users can participate in FaceTime for the first time.\nAn iPhone, Mac, or iPad user needs to create a FaceTime link, but once created, anyone can tap it to join. To join from the web, Chrome or Edge browsers are required. FaceTime from the web works on-on-one or in Group FaceTime calls.\nCreate a FaceTime Link\nApple changed how FaceTime works in iOS 15, so you can create something more akin to a Zoom link, but for FaceTime. You can make a FaceTime link that other people can tap to join your FaceTime call.\nLinks let you schedule FaceTime calls in advance and then share the links with others so everyone can join the meeting or group chat at the appropriate time. FaceTime integrates directly with the Apple Calendar app.\nTo create a link, just open up the FaceTime app and then tap the \"Create Link\" option next to \"New FaceTime.\" You can share the link in a text message, another messaging service, an email, or AirDrop it, and people can click it to join in.\nUsing FaceTime Over WiFi\nFaceTime works best when using WiFi, because a video connection between two parties can be data heavy. You're going to get the clearest picture when using a high-speed WiFi or cellular connection.\nFaceTime will use WiFi by default when connected to a WiFi network on iPhone, iPad, or Mac.\nIf your connection speeds aren't high enough, video will look pixelated and when connection speeds are very slow, the video feed will cut off entirely. FaceTime Audio requires less data than standard FaceTime, but with very poor connectivity, it can fail or sound distorted.\nUsing FaceTime Over LTE/5G\nOn devices with an LTE connection like an iPhone or iPad (or a Mac connected to a hotspot), FaceTime works over cellular as well.\nMost cellular phone plans no longer have limited minutes, but FaceTime Audio and the standard FaceTime video do not use up cell phone minutes. It's worth noting that FaceTime does eat up data, and how much data it uses will vary by device, connection quality, and other factors.\nYou can see how much data you've used in a FaceTime call by opening up the FaceTime app and tapping on the \"i\" next to a person in your recent call list. More detailed instructions are below:\nFaceTiming With Multiple People Using Group FaceTime\nWith Group FaceTime, you can video (or audio) chat with up to 32 people at one time.\nGroup FaceTime presents all of the participants in a tiled view, with the size of each person's tile varying based on the number of participants in the chat. The tile size for the person speaking at the moment will get larger to provide attention to that person, but you can also use Focus View to double tap on any participant that you want to see in the chat.\nNew people can be added to an existing Group FaceTime chat at any time, so you can start up a chat with a group of friends and then add other people as time goes on. Group FaceTime calls send a ringless notification to participants that can be tapped to join.\nYou can also set up a Group FaceTime call through the Messages app by tapping on the FaceTime option in a group chat.\nGroup FaceTime calls can be answered on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, or HomePod, but with the latter two options, users can only join chats with audio and no video.\nGroup FaceTime is available on all devices where FaceTime is available, but on older Apple devices, Group FaceTime is available in an audio-only capacity. This includes the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, iPad mini 2, iPad mini 3, and iPad Air.\nAutomatic Prominence in Group FaceTime\nApple in iOS 13.5 added a feature for Group FaceTime that lets you toggle off Automatic Prominence, aka the feature that makes people's tiles change size depending on who happens to be speaking.\nWith Automatic Prominence turned off, people's tiles won't get bigger when they speak, and will instead be displayed in a grid view with equal sizes. There's also an option to enable Automatic Prominence when someone who uses sign language is detected so you can see what's being signed.\n- How to Turn Off Moving Faces in Group FaceTime on Mac\n- How to Turn off Moving Faces in Group FaceTime\nFaceTime Compact UI\nAs of iOS and iPadOS 14, an incoming FaceTime call no longer takes over the entire display of the iPhone or the iPad, with the call instead showing up as a small banner.\nThe banner is interactive and can be tapped to accept or decline a FaceTime call, with more information available in our guide to the iOS 14 interface.\nPicture in Picture\nWith iOS 14, you can do other things on your iPhone while chatting with a FaceTime window open thanks to the new Picture in Picture mode that's available.\nSwiping out of FaceTime will now open up a Picture in Picture window that can be resized, so you can use apps without having FaceTime paused. More info on Picture in Picture and how to use it can be found in our Picture in Picture guide.\nEye Contact\nIf you enable the \"Eye Contact\" feature in FaceTime's settings, it tweaks the FaceTime video to make it look like you're making eye contact with the person you're talking to while you're looking at the iPhone or iPad's screen.\nUsing Memoji and Animoji When in FaceTime\nWhen using FaceTime for a video chat, you can choose to overlay an Animoji or Memoji character over your head, which is a fun way to chat with kids or to add a bit of whimsy to a conversation.\nYou can choose any of the emoji-like Animoji characters or any of the Memoji that you've created for use in the Messages app. Animoji and Memoji use the TrueDepth camera system to track your head and mouth movements for a very realistic interactive experience.\nBecause TrueDepth is required, this feature is limited to devices that have a TrueDepth camera and it will not work on older devices. Animoji and Memoji also only work on the iPhone and the iPad, with no Mac option available.\nAdding a Memoji or Animoji to cover your face in FaceTime is as simple as tapping on your picture when you're on a FaceTime call, then tapping the star icon, aka the \"Effects\" icon. From there, tap on the \"Memoji\" icon (face in a square) on the left side.\nUsing Effects in FaceTime\nAlong with Animoji and Memoji, you can apply filters, stickers, animated shapes, Memoji and Animoji stickers, and text to your FaceTime video to spice it up.\nThere are a range of filters to choose from, ranging from those that simply tweak colors to those that add effects like watercolor, comic book, aged film, ink, and more.\nAs for stickers, there are some animated shapes available by default along with Memoji and Amimoji stickers that are emoji-like still versions of Animoji/Memoji, plus you can use any sticker pack purchased from the App Store or made available through an app you already have installed.\nCapturing a Live Photo With FaceTime\nWhen using FaceTime for a video call, you can capture a Live Photo of a moment during a chat. All you need to do to take a Live Photo is to tap on the display to bring up the camera button and then tap the camera button.\nTapping on the camera button lets you know that you took a Live Photo, and it lets the person on the other end of the call know that you took a Live Photo. That prevents people from taking Live Photos of you during a chat without your knowledge.\nTo use this feature, the participants in the video call need to have Live Photos in FaceTime enabled, which can be found by opening up Settings, choosing FaceTime, and then toggling on FaceTime Live Photos.\nIf you disable this by toggling it off, no one will be able to take FaceTime Live Photos when chatting with you.\nUsing SharePlay\nSharePlay is a major FaceTime feature that was introduced in iOS 15, and it's basically a way for you to do more on FaceTime calls with your friends and family. You can watch TV together, listen to music, and share your screen. SharePlay is was introduced in iOS 15.1, iPadOS 15.1, tvOS 15.1, and macOS Monterey 12.1 after being delayed from the initial launch versions of the software.\nSharePlay makes the FaceTime experience a whole lot better because it can be used for screen sharing, watching movies and TV together, or listening to music with Apple Music. Third-party app developers can also build SharePlay into their apps, so there are a whole range of new FaceTime games and experiences.\n- iOS 15: How to Share Your Screen on a FaceTime Call\n- iOS 15: How to Watch Movies Together Using FaceTime\nFor a full rundown on SharePlay and other features introduced in the iOS 15 update, we have a dedicated guide.\nBlocking Unwanted FaceTime Calls\nIf you're getting unwanted FaceTime video and audio calls, there is an option to put a stop to them through the built-in blocking feature in the Contacts app. You can tap on the little \"i\" button next to name or number in the list of recent FaceTime calls in the FaceTime app or the Phone app to bring up a little contact card.\nThe contact card will have a \"Block this Caller\" option at the bottom, and if you tap it, that person will no longer be able to contact you.\n- How to Block Unwanted FaceTime Calls\n- How to Check the FaceTime Numbers you Have Blocked\n- How to Unblock People on FaceTime\nCountries Where FaceTime is Available\nFaceTime is available in almost all countries around the world, with the exception of the United Arab Emirates. To use FaceTime in Saudi Arabia, an iPhone or iPad must be running iOS 11.3 or later, and to use FaceTime in Pakistan, devices must run iOS 12.4 or later.\nDevices purchased in certain Middle Eastern countries will also block FaceTime if a SIM card from a non Middle Eastern country is inserted. FaceTime Audio is not available in China. All iPhones and iPads sold in China are limited to the standard FaceTime with video feature.\nNote that if you purchase an iPhone or iPad in China or the United Arab Emirates and then attempt to use it in another country, the FaceTime features listed above will be disabled. Purchasing an iPhone from China or the Middle East is not recommended unless you live in those places.\nGuide Feedback\nHave questions about FaceTime, know of something we left out, or want to offer feedback on this guide?

      "text": "Apple Intelligence is what Apple calls its artificial intelligence feature set, previewed at WWDC in June 2024. The first Apple Intelligence features launched with iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1, and additional features came in iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2. There's still more to come, though, and the rest of the Apple Intelligence features are set to come later in 2025.\nWriting Tools\n- Proofread text checks for spelling and grammar errors, including word choice and sentence structure. You can accept all suggestions with a tap or go through them one by one with explanations.\n- Rewrite cleans up what you've written and shifts the tone without impacting your content. Options include Friendly, Professional, and Concise.\n- You can select text and get a summary of it with Apple Intelligence. You can choose to create a paragraph, pull out key points, make a list, or create a table. Summaries are available in Mail, Messages, and more.\n- There is an open-ended Writing Tools option that lets you describe a change you want to make to something you've written. You can choose any mood or writing style that you want, with varying degrees of success. If you want something to be more flowery or elaborate, Writing Tools can make it happen. You can also ask for your text to be converted into a different format, like a poem.\n- Writing Tools has a \"Compose\" feature that uses Siri ChatGPT integration. With this option, Siri can leverage ChatGPT to compose writing from scratch rather than just rewriting text.\nYou can select any text on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac and use Apple Intelligence to access Writing Tools for summaries and other features.\nSiri\n- There's a glow around the edges of the display when Siri is activated, applicable to iPhone, iPad, and CarPlay. On Mac, the Siri window can be placed anywhere. The glow animates responsively to the sound of your voice so you can tell when Siri is listening without interrupting other things you're doing.\n- A double tap at the bottom of the display brings up the Type to Siri interface so you can type requests instead of speaking them. On Mac, you need to press the Command key twice to bring up Type to Siri. Type to Siri includes suggested requests so you can get your questions answered faster.\n- Siri can maintain context between requests so you can ask a question and then reference it in a second reply. If you ask about the temperature in Raleigh, for example, and then follow up with \"what's the humidity?\" Siri should know you mean in Raleigh.\n- If you stumble over your words when speaking to Siri, or change what you're saying mid-sentence, Siri will follow along.\n- Siri has Apple's product knowledge and support base for answering questions about your device's features and settings, and can even find settings when you don't know the exact name by using natural language search.\n- There is a summarize button for summarizing any of your incoming emails, plus you will see a brief summary of an email in your inbox list rather than the first few lines of the email.\n- Mail surfaces time sensitive messages first when applicable, putting them at the top of your inbox so you see what's important right away.\n- Smart Reply provides quick-tap responses to emails that you've been sent, with contextual options based on what's in the email.\n- Multiple notifications from Mail will be summarized on your Lock Screen so you can see what's in an email without opening the app.\nMessages\n- Messages has Smart Reply options for incoming texts, which analyze the content of messages to offer suggestions of what you might want to say.\n- Multiple Messages notifications are summarized on your Lock Screen.\n- You can use all of the Writing Tools features in the Messages app for proofreading and refining what you're planning to send.\nPhotos\n- You can create a Memory Movie with just a description, such as \"My cat in 2024,\" or \"Orlando in the summer.\" The feature automatically picks relevant photos and chooses songs, but you can tweak through the Memory Mixes feature or choose a mood to guide the direction of the audio. You can also add in specific scenes and images you want to see throughout the memory when you're creating the prompt.\n- Natural language search is available in Photos, so you can just describe what you're looking for, such as \"Eric rollerskating while wearing green.\"\n- Search can also find specific moments in video clips.\n- Search offers up smart complete suggestions for narrowing down what you might want to find.\nClean Up\nThe Photos app also includes \"Clean Up,\" a feature that lets you remove unwanted objects from your photos. The Clean Up tool in the Photos app is able to automatically detect objects in an image that might not be wanted, but you can also tap, circle, or brush over an unwanted object to remove it.\nZooming in on an image can help with using a finger as a brush to remove smaller blemishes and issues with an image, and it is intelligent enough not to remove part of a person even if a person or main subject is selected.\nClean Up works on all images in the Photos library, including older images and images captured by other devices like a point and shoot camera or a DSLR.\nTranscription Summaries\nIn Notes and other apps, you can record audio and get a transcript along with a summary of your transcript, which is useful for recording lectures and other audio. Transcription isn't an Apple Intelligence feature, but summaries are.\nFocus Modes\nThere is a dedicated Reduce Interruptions Focus Mode that only shows you important notifications that need attention while filtering out everything else.\nWhen customizing an existing Focus mode or creating a new one, there is a new toggle to turn on Intelligent Breakthrough and Silencing. This option allows important notifications to interrupt you, while muting notifications that are not important, which is the same thing that the Reduce Notifications Focus does. You can override the notification settings for specific apps and people, which is how it worked prior to iOS 18.1.\nNotification Summaries\nYour incoming notifications are summarized so you can see what's new for each app at a glance.\nPhone\nSummaries of transcriptions generated from your phone calls are supported. You can record a phone call and get a transcription in iOS 18, which is not an Apple Intelligence feature. What does require Apple Intelligence, though, is getting a summary from that transcription without reading through the entire thing.\nNote that you can start a recording by tapping on the record button in the upper left corner of the display when on a phone call. All participants are notified that the call is being recorded before the recording starts.\nRecorded phone calls are stored in the Notes app, where you can tap in to view a transcript and get a summary generated from that transcript.\nSafari\nWhen reading an article in Reader Mode, there is an option to have Apple Intelligence summarize the article for you.\nImage Playground\nImage Playground can be used to generate images in cartoon-like styles using a text-based prompt. Apple has built-in suggestions and concepts that you can choose from, like costumes, locations, items, and themes.\nWhile Image Playground is a standalone app, it is also integrated into the Messages and Notes app. In these apps, Apple can use context from what you've typed for image generation suggestions.\nFor inspiration, you can upload or take a photo, and then get a cartoon AI version of it, and you can also use images of friends and family members pulled from the People album in the Photos app.\nYou can start with a base suggestion or photo and then continue to add to it until you get what you want. You can remove suggestions at any time, and save your favorite creations for use in other apps. Anytime you create something with Image Playground, you'll get multiple options so you can choose the best one.\nThere are only Animation and Illustration styles for Image Playground, so there is no option for creating photorealistic images.\nImage Wand\nImage Wand is basically the same thing as Image Playground, but in the Notes app. When you have notes that you've taken, you can circle an empty spot or some text and Image Wand will add a contextually relevant image.\nSo if you have notes on photosynthesis, you can add in an image of a plant under the sun. Image Wand isn't able to generate complex images, so if you want a picture of the internal structure of mitochondria, you're out of luck, but it can make a stylized image featuring the organelle.\nOn an iPad, you can draw a rough sketch of what you want to add to your notes with an Apple Pencil, and then use Image Wand to generate something more polished.\nGenmoji\nGenmoji are custom emoji characters that you can create using a text-based description. If there's an emoji you can't find but need, like a duck eating a sandwich or an alligator skateboarding, Genmoji can make it for you.\nGenmoji aren't too far off from Image Playground images, but the generation system tends to want to add a person for a lot of requests. You can choose yourself or a friend or family member, or just use a generic emoji character as your base.\nIn Messages and other apps, Genmoji behave like emoji, but they're not going to display properly for anyone running an operating system earlier than iOS 18.1, or on an Android device.\nTo create a Genmoji character, tap into the Emoji keyboard and tap on the Emoji with a \"+\" button next to the search bar. From there, you can type in your idea.\nSiri ChatGPT Integration\nSiri ChatGPT integration lets Siri hand requests over to OpenAI's ChatGPT. ChatGPT is off by default, but you can turn it on in the Apple Intelligence and Siri section of the Settings app.\nIf ChatGPT integration is enabled, Siri will consult ChatGPT for complex requests. Complex requests might include creating an image, generating text from scratch, making recipe ideas based on what's in your refrigerator, describing what's in a photo, and more.\nSiri analyzes each request to see if it's something that needs to be answered by ChatGPT, but you can also automatically invoke ChatGPT for a request by using a request like \"Ask ChatGPT to give me a chocolate chip cookie recipe.\"\nSiri asks your permission before querying ChatGPT, but there is an option to turn off that extra permission step by toggling off \"Confirm ChatGPT Requests\" in the ChatGPT section of Settings.\nYou don't need an account to use ChatGPT, and it is free, but if you have a paid account, you can sign in. If you're not signed in, OpenAI does not store any of your ChatGPT requests, nor is your information used for training ChatGPT. If you sign in, ChatGPT can save a copy of your queries. Apple does not store ChatGPT queries.\nChatGPT can be used with Siri, but it is also integrated into Writing Tools and Visual Intelligence. With Writing Tools, ChatGPT can generate text, and with Visual Intelligence, ChatGPT can answer questions about what the Camera sees.\nVisual Intelligence\nVisual Intelligence is an iPhone 16 feature that uses the Camera Control button. If you long press it, you can get into Visual Intelligence mode, where the Camera app can be used to identify what's around you.\nIf you point the camera at a store, for example, you can see ratings, hours, and other information. If you take a photo of an object, you can get more information about the object from ChatGPT, or use it with Google Search to find similar images. The Google Search feature is a good way to search for products that you want to find.\nOther Visual Intelligence features include reading text out loud, detecting phone numbers and addresses to add them to the Contacts app, copying text, and summarizing long passages of text.\nApple Intelligence Features Coming Later\nAdditional Languages\nApple Intelligence currently supports localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland, and the UK in addition to U.S. English, but additional languages are coming in an update that's slated to be released in April. Languages that will be added include French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese.\nPriority Notifications\nPriority notifications will show up at the top of your notification stack, so you can get to what's most important first.\nSiri\nSome initial Siri updates are available now such as Siri's new glow that encompasses the edges of the display and ChatGPT integration, but more Siri capabilities will be added in an update later in 2025. Apple is working on onscreen awareness, personal context, and the ability to take more actions in and across apps.\nOnscreen awareness will let Siri take actions when you ask something about what's on your display. If you're looking at a photo and want to message it to your friend Eric, you'll be able to tell Siri to \"Send this picture to Eric,\" and Siri will understand and do it.\nPersonal context will let Siri do more with your personal data like emails and messages. This is an on-device feature, and it will let Siri learn more about you, who you're communicating with, and how you use your device. Personal context will let you do things like ask Siri to find a specific message, or remind you when you took a photo that you're looking for.\nThe Siri option to take more actions in and across apps will drastically improve what Siri is capable of. You'll be able to move files from one app to another and control app functions with Siri that you never could before. It'll work in third-party apps as well as Apple's own apps.\nWhen to Expect More Apple Intelligence Features\nAdditional Apple Intelligence features are set to come in future updates. Apple originally planned to add new Siri capabilities to iOS 18.4, but the functionality is not ready to go so we will be waiting a bit longer. Apple will likely hold the new Siri features until iOS 18.5.\nApple Intelligence Device Requirements\nApple Intelligence requires a device with one of Apple's newest chips and 8GB RAM. Eligible models are listed below.\n- All iPhone 16 models\n- iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max\n- All Apple silicon iPads\n- A17 Pro iPad mini\n- All Apple silicon Macs\nApple Intelligence Settings\nIn the Privacy and Security section of the Settings app you can access an Apple Intelligence Report that lets you export your Apple Intelligence data as part of Apple's promise for transparency around Apple Intelligence. Biometric authentication is required to access and export Apple Intelligence data.\nYou can also disable Apple Intelligence by toggling off the setting under the Apple Intelligence and Siri section in the Settings app.\nApple Intelligence Availability\nApple Intelligence is only available in U.S. English at this time, along with localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the UK is supported in addition to U.S. English.\nApple plans to add support for additional languages later in 2025, like Chinese, English (India), English (Singapore), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese. Apple Intelligence will launch on the iPhone and the iPad in the European Union in April 2025."

      "text": "iOS 26\nApple's next-generation operating system for the iPhone, coming in fall 2025.\niOS 26 - What's New\nContents\n- iOS 26 - What's New\n- iOS 18 to iOS 26\n- Design Changes\n- Home Screen and Lock Screen\n- Messages\n- Phone\n- Apple Music\n- Shortcuts\n- Other New App Features\n- CarPlay\n- Battery and Adaptive Power Mode\n- Apple Intelligence Updates\n- New AirPods Features\n- Smaller Changes\n- Accessibility\n- Compatibility\n- iOS 26 Launch Date\n- What's Next for iOS\n- iOS 26 Timeline\niOS 26 is the newest version of iOS, the operating system that runs on the iPhone, and it's coming this fall. If you were expecting iOS 19 after iOS 18, you might be a little surprised to see Apple jump to iOS 26, but the new number reflects the 2025-2026 release season for the software update. It also lets Apple use the same number across all of its updates, so there's no more confusion since you're no longer downloading iOS, macOS, visionOS, and watchOS all with different numbers.\niOS 26 brings the first new major design change that Apple has brought to iOS since iOS 7. Apple says that the new \"Liquid Glass\" look will be the basis of the next decade of iOS design. Liquid Glass reflects and refracts its surroundings, while putting more focus on content. Many interface elements are almost entirely translucent, and the design extends to controls, navigation, app icons, menus, buttons, and widgets.\nLiquid Glass is meant to transform depending on content or context, and it behaves like glass in the real world, so color is informed by its surroundings, and it is meant to adapt between light and dark elements. Liquid Glass uses real-time rendering and can dynamically react to movement to change the way that light reflects off of buttons, switches, sliders, side bars, tab bars, and more.\nYou'll see Liquid Glass throughout iOS 26, in all of Apple's apps, in notifications, on the Lock Screen, in Control Center, and on the Home Screen. Apple is also providing developers with tools to bring the new material to their own apps for a cohesive look. Liquid Glass also extends to iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe, visionOS 26, tvOS 26, and watchOS 26.\nThe Liquid Glass design overhaul isn't just a glossy finish, it also brings updates to the design of controls, toolbars, and navigation throughout iOS 26. App windows, menu bars, and other interface elements have more rounded corners, and controls feature a distinct functional layer designed to sit above apps. These kinds of menus can dynamically morph to provide users with more options in an app.\nWhen scrolling, tab bars shrink down to bring attention to content, but scrolling up brings them right back for fluid navigation. When tab bars are active, they refract the content around them. There are major Liquid Glass design updates for Camera, Photos, Safari, FaceTime, Apple Music, and Apple Podcasts. On the Lock Screen, the Liquid Glass time expands and shrinks to fit behind the subject of a wallpaper, and on the Home Screen, app icons and widgets are made from multiple layers of Liquid Glass that gives the appearance of depth.\nThe Lock Screen features a spatial scene option for photo wallpapers, giving them a 3D look and a sense of movement. The Home Screen might look different with an option for translucent icons and widgets, but it is functionally the same.\nApple streamlined the Camera app layout with simpler navigation. It has Photo and Video toggles, with other options tucked away behind menus that expand out with a tap. You can swipe to get to more photo and video options. Apple also updated the Photos app to re-add separate tabs for the Library and Collections views. In Photos, you can also activate Spatial Scene for any image, getting a unique 3D view of the image.\nSafari has a whole new look, and Apple has updated navigation. By default, Safari adopts the more rounded Liquid Glass buttons and nixes the settings at the bottom of the app, but there's an option to bring them back with a floating tab bar if you prefer a more feature rich menu. Apple Music, News, and Podcasts all have a new tab bar that floats above the content in the app and dynamically shrinks when users are browsing, so the interface options take up less space on the display.\nAlong with a new design, Apple is expanding the Apple Intelligence features that are available on the iPhone. Messages, FaceTime, and Phone all support Live Translation for automatically translating conversations when you're conversing with someone who speaks another language.\nVisual Intelligence now understands what's on your screen, and can answer questions about what you're looking at using ChatGPT integration. The feature can help you find products, add events to your calendar, and more. Image Playground supports ChatGPT image generation so you can create images in more styles. Genmoji has a new feature for mixing multiple emoji characters to make a new one, and adding descriptions to create an all-new emoji character.\nIn the Wallet app, there's a new Apple Intelligence feature that can scan your emails to summarize order tracking details from merchants, even if you didn't make the purchase with Apple Pay. It lets you see all your purchases and their tracking info in one spot. Wallet also now supports paying with installments in stores and getting rewards on in-store purchases. Boarding passes in Wallet support Live Activities for real-time flight tracking, and include access to Maps and Find My.\nThe Shortcuts app supports intelligent actions that can summarize text, create images, or tap into Apple Intelligence models, making it easier than ever to create automations. Reminders is able to suggest tasks, grocery items and follow-ups based on emails, and it can automatically categorize related reminders into sections.\nFor developers, Apple is debuting a new Foundation Models framework that allows developers to tap into the AI model that's at the core of Apple Intelligence, so developers can add new AI features to their apps.\nThe Phone app has a whole slew of new features. There's a unified layout that combines Favorites, Recents, and Voicemails. A new Call Screening feature asks unknown callers for their name and reason for calling before sending the call to you, stopping unwanted calls. When you're stuck on hold, there's a Hold Assist option that stays on the line for you, so you don't have to listen to irritating hold music. It lets you know when a live agent is available.\nMessages can screen texts from unknown senders, sending them silently to a dedicated folder where users can ask for more information or delete them. Group texts now have typing indicators and support for sending and receiving Apple Cash, plus Messages adds customizable backgrounds for each conversation and polls.\nIn Apple Music, there's a Lyrics Translation feature that translates lyrics that aren't in your language, and Lyrics Pronunciation helps you pronounce those lyrics. A new AutoMix feature uses intelligence to transition from one song to another, using time stretching and beat matching for a seamless shift between songs.\nApple Maps supports Visited Places so you can remember where you've been, and on-device intelligence can understand your daily route, popping up your preferred routes and letting you know about potential delays and alternate route options.\nApple added a new Apple Games app that's an all-in-one destination for discovering and playing games. It supports recommendations, leaderboards, competitions with friends, and more.\nCarPlay is getting the same Liquid Glass design overhaul, along with widgets and Live Activities that sync from the iPhone. There are Tapback options, important conversations can be pinned, and Apple added a new compact view for incoming calls so directions aren't blocked.\nIn iOS 26, AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 support studio-quality sound recording and improved sound for calls and videos. The AirPods can also be used to take a photo or record a video with a press on the stem. For battery management, there's a new Adaptive Power setting on the iPhone that intelligently determines when you're using more battery than normal and adjusts things like screen brightness to preserve battery life.\nNote: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here.\niOS 18 to iOS 26\nIf you're wondering why Apple went from iOS 18 to iOS 26, it was to streamline operating system naming. Apple is numbering all of its operating systems with the year going forward, so the \"26\" in iOS 26 represents the release season between September 2025 and September 2026.\nEverything released this year uses the same number, so iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, and so on. It will help keep numbering more straightforward in the future, even if it seems strange to skip iOS 19 to iOS 26.\nDesign Changes\nThe biggest single change in iOS 26 is the design overhaul. Apple is using a new Liquid Glass material throughout the operating system, and it has transformed the look of the iPhone's software.\nLiquid Glass is translucent, and like real glass, it allows light and color to shine through to put the focus on the content that's on your iPhone's display. Apple designed Liquid Glass to behave like it does in the real world, so it can subtly reflect light when you move your iPhone. It uses real-time rendering to dynamically react to movement with reflective highlights.\nApp icons are meant to look like several layers of glass, which gives them a subtle depth. Liquid Glass works well for the standard color icons, but Apple also added a translucent app icon option that makes your iPhone look even more like a sheet of glass.\nThere are actually two main aspects to the iOS 26 redesign: the Liquid Glass look, and simplified navigation that highlights the Liquid Glass material. There are too many cosmetic changes in iOS 26 to go through each one, but there is an overarching design language that Apple adopted.\nIt is worth noting that while iOS 26 looks different, it still feels like prior versions of iOS. Apple wanted it to be familiar to iOS users despite the changes, so menus, bars, and buttons look different and do have some different functions, but they are functions that iPhone users are already familiar with.\nPop Out Menus\nIn several places, Apple streamlined navigation and moved extra settings into pop out menus. In the Camera app, for example, Apple shows just the two main modes: photo and video. But if you tap on one of the buttons, you'll see a pop out menu with a range of photo settings that you can activate.\nApple says it wanted controls, toolbars, and navigation to have a distinct functional layer that sits above apps, morphing and dynamically changing as users need more options.\nThis kind of menu is common in iOS 26, so if there's something that you can't find, tap on one of the small icons on the screen, because chances are the menu expands out with more options.\nDisappearing Navigation\nIn several places, navigation elements disappear when they're not needed, and appear when they are. An example of this is in Safari. When you scroll down, the tab bar will collapse down into a small bar that shows just the name of the website. Scrolling back up brings back the full Safari tab bar so you can use the interface buttons that you need.\nIn Photos and Apple Music, there's an expanding search bar. Tapping it unfurls into a full search menu and collapses the other navigation bar menu options. Tapping out of search and on one of the other icons collapses search again and the menu bar returns to how it was. This is similar to the pop out menus, with an emphasis on putting things you don't need out of sight until you want to use them.\nThere are other examples of this, too. In the Health app, you won't see Health categories anymore until you tap on the search icon. That swaps to the search and categories interface, and a swap back is done by tapping on the heart to get back to your pinned items.\nCorners and Spacing\nIn areas with a long list of options or categories, such as the Settings app, Apple has increased spacing and padding for a less cluttered look. You will need to scroll longer to get through settings now, but there's more space to tap and it can be more readable with the additional spacing.\nApple shrunk navigation bars at the bottom of apps, so they take up less display space. A good example of this is in the Photos app, where the editing options have been condensed down into a smaller bar.\nNavigation bars, side bars, card-style menus, notifications, buttons, toggles, search bars, and other interface elements have a more rounded look. Single buttons are entirely circular, such as those in Control Center, while navigation bars are pill-shaped with distinctly round corners. Toggles and notifications have an elongated pill-shape too, and cards are also more rounded in appearance at the corners. The keyboard has round edges at the top.\niOS 18 had more of a squircle (rounded square) shape for much of the interface, but almost everything in iOS 26 is round. An exception is app icons, which have not changed in shape.\nCross-Platform Cohesiveness\nLiquid Glass is not exclusive to iOS 26. The new design extends to all of Apple's operating systems, including iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, and of course, visionOS 26, which is the OS that inspired the overhaul.\nWith the same design available across all of Apple's operating systems, everything feels more cohesive, which was one of Apple's main goals with Liquid Glass.\nDesign Summary\n- Everything looks different in iOS 26.\n- There's an emphasis on content, with Apple aiming to make everything else fade away.\n- Interface elements are made from Liquid Glass, which is translucent and designed to work like glass in the real world. Colors and content shine through, and everything has a more liquid feel.\n- Almost all interface elements are rounder.\n- Navigation elements and settings are meant to hide away when you don't need them. If you're missing a setting, it's likely you'll find it in a pop out menu when you tap on a single icon.\n- Liquid Glass is system wide. Apple's apps have been redesigned with it to varying degrees, and third-party apps will also adopt the design language.\nHome Screen and Lock Screen\nOn the Lock Screen, there are two key changes beyond design updates. The time can auto adjust to be larger when your wallpaper allows for more space, and there is an option to enable a 2D to 3D spatial photo effect that adds depth to your wallpaper images.\nThe size of the time adjusts automatically in some cases, but you can also drag the bar at the corner to resize it to make it bigger. Note that you need to use the first font in the font list, because it's the only one that can be resized.\nWhen choosing a photo for a wallpaper, there is an option to use a 2D image to generate a 3D \"Spatial Scene\" that uses depth information to separate the subject from the background. The Spatial Scene wallpaper will feature a little bit of motion when you move your iPhone, enhancing the 3D effect.\nMost of the Home Screen is the same, aside from the Liquid Glass design changes. You can tap into Edit > Customize to select a new \"Clear\" option that gives all of your app icons a translucent, Liquid Glass look.\nMessages\nThe Messages app features customized backgrounds, an option to create polls, and enhanced spam filtering and blocking features.\n- Customizable backgrounds - In an individual or group conversation, you can tap on the name at the top and then choose the \"Backgrounds\" option to set a custom background for each conversation. There are options like sky, water, and aurora, or you can choose a color. You can also select photos or generate a background with Image Playground. Backgrounds that you set are changed for every participant in the conversation, unless they toggle off the feature in Messages settings.\n- Polls - Tap on the \"+\" button to get to a new option to create a poll in any chat. You can add up to 12 different options, then send it to allow people to vote. Others can also add options to the list. On devices with Apple Intelligence, polls may come up as a suggestion.\n- Group chats - Group chats support typing indicators and sending and receiving Apple Cash. There's also an option to add someone in a group chat who isn't in your contacts to your Contacts app with a tap.\n- Natural language search - Messages supports natural language search.\n- Copy/paste - You can now select just part of a text message to copy. Long press and tap on the new \"Select\" option to do so.\n- Spam messages - Spam messages and Unknown Senders are two separate categories in iOS 26. There's a new Filter box at the top right of the Messages app, and Unknown Senders go in one category, while Spam goes in another. A badge lets you know if you have messages in these categories, but you won't get notifications for them.\n- Unknown Senders - Messages from Unknown Senders won't send notifications if the option to filter them is on, but you will get alerts if it is a time sensitive notification, such as a notification from a ride share app or a delivery person.\n- Live Translation - Messages that aren't in your language can be automatically translated as you receive them in iOS 26. Apple Intelligence is required for this feature.\nPhone\nThe Phone app includes multiple new features that are designed to cut down on unwanted calls and reduce the amount of time that you need to spend on the phone.\nCall Screening\nCall Screening is an extension of Live Voicemail. When you receive a call from an unknown number that is not in your list of contacts, your iPhone asks the caller for their name and reason for calling. The information is relayed to you so you can decide if you want to accept the call or ignore it.\nCall Screening can be enabled in the Phone section of the Settings app.\nHold Assist\nIf you make a phone call and you're stuck on hold waiting to speak to a person, you can activate Hold Assist. Your iPhone can wait for you while you do other things, and then let you know when a live agent is on the line. The agent is informed that you'll be on the call in just a moment.\nTo use Hold Assist, tap on the \"Hold\" button after placing a call.\nLive Translation\nWhen talking to someone that speaks another language, there is an option to turn on Live Translation to have the call automatically translated for each person on the line. Live Translation is an Apple Intelligence feature and requires an iPhone 15 Pro or later.\nOther Features\n- Unified Layout - The Phone app has an optional unified layout that combines Favorites, Recents, and Voicemails in one spot.\n- Spam calls - Calls identified as spam can be silenced and sent directly to voicemail.\n- Type to Siri - You can now use Type to Siri while on a phone call.\n- Call History - Tapping on the info button next to a call in the recents list or on a name or number in the unified view shows a call history that lists every time you've spoken with someone.\n- Flag spam voicemails - If you tap into a voicemail from a person not in your contact list, you'll see an option to report the voicemail as spam.\n- eSIM transfer - It's easier to transfer an eSIM to an Android device and vice versa with new integrated eSIM transfer capabilities.\n- Focus eSIM - There is a Focus mode for silencing a single eSIM, so you can disable a home number at work, or a work number at home.\n- Screen sharing - The Phone app supports screen sharing and SharePlay during phone calls.\nApple Music\nThere are several new Apple Music features, ranging from translation to new options for transitioning between songs.\nAutoMix\nApple Music includes AutoMix, a feature that transitions from one song to another as the song that's playing ends. It uses time stretching and beat mixing for a seamless shift, and Apple says that it's meant to work like a DJ.\nSongs transition at the \"perfect moment\" based on an analysis of the key and tempo of the music, with AutoMix serving as an alternative to Crossfade.\nOther New Features\n- Lyrics Translation - Songs that are in another language can be translated automatically with Lyrics Translation.\n- Lyrics Pronunciation - Lyrics Pronunciation helps you pronounce lyrics that are in another language.\n- Pinned playlists - Apple Music playlists can now be pinned to the top of the Music app, with pinned playlists available in a new Home Screen widget as well.\n- Playlist folders - Playlists can be organized into folders.\n- iPhone microphone - When using the Apple Music Sing karaoke feature on Apple TV, the iPhone can be used as a microphone.\n- Lock Screen - On the Lock Screen, the Now Playing widget now provides full screen album artwork. Album art animates based on what you're listening to.\nShortcuts\nThe Shortcuts app now features Apple Intelligence, and the option to use Apple's AI models when creating shortcuts. Apple Intelligence models can be used for summarizing PDFs, generating recipes, answering questions, and more. Writing Tools and Image Playground are available for spellchecking, image generation, rewriting, tone changes, and more.\nApple offers several pre-programmed Shortcuts in the Gallery that use Apple Intelligence, such as options for getting a morning summary of the coming day, generating a haiku, or summarizing a PDF.\nWhen creating a shortcut, there is an Apple Intelligence section that includes options for an on-device model, a cloud model that uses Private Cloud Compute, or ChatGPT. Some pre-set options are available, such as opening Visual Intelligence, generating an image with Image Playground, or using Writing Tools, along with the option to use a model.\nSelecting one of the AI models provides an open-ended prompt where you can write in what you want it to do. You need to work in the confines of the model that Apple provides, pairing it with other functionality in Shortcuts.\nOther New App Features\nSafari\n- Tab View - Safari has a new \"Compact\" view for the Tab bar that puts several settings out of sight. You can change back to the standard bottom bar or top bar in the Safari section of the Settings app.\n- Liquid Glass - When scrolling, the Tab bar collapses down. Scroll up to bring it back.\n- Tracking Prevention - Advanced fingerprinting protection extends to all browsing by default. Advanced fingerprinting protection prevents websites from tracking your device usage across websites. Previously, this was limited to private browsing unless explicitly enabled.\n- Web apps - Every website added to the Home Screen through Safari opens a web app, even if it is not configured that way. In earlier versions of iOS, websites added to the Home Screen that were not properly configured would open in Safari.\n- HDR images - Safari supports HDR images in iOS 26.\n- SVG icons - Safari supports the SVG file format for icons in the bookmark bar and start page.\nCamera\n- Design - The Camera app has a simplified design with just Photo and Video tabs. Swiping swaps to other photo modes, and tapping on one of the buttons expands the available settings.\n- Lens - If the Camera lens is dirty, your iPhone lets you know that it needs to be cleaned.\n- AirPods - The AirPods 4 or AirPods Pro 2 can be used to take a photo or start a video recording by pressing and holding on the stem.\nPhotos\n- Design - Apple reverted to a more pre-iOS 18 design for Photos, separating the Library and Collections into different tabs.\n- Search - Video thumbnails show up in search results.\n- Spatial Scenes - You can use a new 3D feature to turn 2D photos into 3D images, adding subtle depth and motion that separates the subject from the background.\nNotes\n- Markdown - The Notes app supports exporting in Markdown.\n- Math Notes - Three-variable equations can be used to create 3D graphs.\nReminders\n- Categorization - Apple Intelligence can categorize reminders into different sections.\n- Suggestions - Apple Intelligence can suggest adding tasks, grocery items, and more to Reminders based on what's on your iPhone.\nFaceTime\n- Live Translation - FaceTime supports Live Translation, displaying captions if you're talking to someone who speaks another language.\n- Call Screening - FaceTime has new screening features for unknown numbers. Calls from unknown numbers can be asked for more information like name and reason for calling, or they can be sent directly to voicemail. Missed calls from unknown numbers can be silenced and sent to an Unknown Callers list.\nPodcasts\n- Enhance Dialogue - An Enhance Dialogue option mutes background sounds to enhance speech.\n- Playback speed - There are more options for playback speeds, ranging from 0.5x to 3x.\nApple Maps\n- Preferred Routes - Apple Maps learns your frequent commutes and the Maps widget can let you know if there are any significant delays along your preferred route, offering an alternative if necessary.\n- Saved Places - Apple Maps can save the places that you visit and spend time in so you can look them up later.\n- Incidents - There are additional types of incidents to choose from when making a report in the Maps app.\nWallet\nThere is an option to add a passport to the Wallet app, which creates a \"Digital ID\" that can be used at select TSA checkpoints in the United States.\nA new \"Verify with Wallet on the Web\" option allows websites to use the license or ID you have stored in the Wallet app for age and identity verification purposes. The process involves scanning a QR code with the iPhone and then authenticating, so it works in Safari and all other web browsers, too. It also works on non-Apple devices.\n- Package tracking - Apple Intelligence can recognize order tracking details from emails, adding the information to the Wallet app. This works on all purchases, not just those that were made using Apple Pay.\n- Boarding Passes - Boarding passes in Wallet have been upgraded and now show relevant information below the boarding pass, like Apple Maps directions for the airport terminal, and a link to Find My for luggage tracking.\n- Live Activity - Boarding passes now show up as a Live Activity on iPhone, so you can keep track of relevant flight information without having to open the Wallet app. Flight Live Activities can be shared with friends and family.\n- AutoFill Credit Cards - You can add and remove credit cards and debit cards that work with AutoFill from the Wallet app.\n- Apple Pay - Apple Pay supports rewards and installments for in-store purchases.\nGames\niOS 26 includes a Games app that comes pre-installed on the iPhone. It has all of the games from the App Store, along with Apple Arcade titles.\nGames you have installed are shown in a Library section. A Play Together section lets you invite friends to \"Challenges,\" where you compete to win in a game-specific task like getting the highest score during a given week.\nPreview\nThe Mac Preview app is now available on the iPhone and the iPad. It can be used for creating, viewing, and annotating PDFs. There are also tools for cropping, flipping, rotating, resizing, and editing images.\nJournal\n- Multiple Journals - You can now create more than one journal if you want to separate your entries by topic.\n- Maps - Journal entries can be viewed on a map.\n- Images - There's support for adding images inline with text.\nCarPlay\nCarPlay has been updated with the same Liquid Glass design that Apple added to iOS 26. The look includes layered glass-like app icons and translucent user interface elements.\nNew Messages App Features\nStarting with iOS 26, you can respond to messages with standard Tapbacks like a heart, thumbs up, or exclamation marks directly through CarPlay.\nCarPlay also now displays pinned conversations in the Messages app.\nPhone Calls\nApple added a compact view for incoming phone calls, so that you can still see other information on the screen, such as turn-by-turn directions.\nLive Activities and Widgets\nCarPlay's Dashboard screen can now show Live Activities, letting you keep track of things like a flight's arrival time at a glance.\nThe regular version of CarPlay also now has a widgets screen, for things like calendar appointments and HomeKit accessory controls.\nOther New Features\n- Multi-Touch Maps - Starting with iOS 26, CarPlay users can interact with mapping apps using multi-touch gestures in supported vehicles. This allows users to zoom and pan on the map with their fingers, just like they can on an iPhone.\n- Watch Videos While Parked - iPhone users can wirelessly stream videos to the CarPlay screen using AirPlay, according to Apple. For safety reasons, video playback will only be available when the vehicle is parked, to prevent distracted driving. The connected iPhone will be able to detect when the vehicle is in motion and end playback. Automakers need to add support for this feature, so it might be limited to newer vehicles and take some time to roll out.\n- Smart Display Zoom - iOS 26 adds a new Smart Display Zoom setting to CarPlay. When the setting is enabled, CarPlay will be automatically resized to better fit the shape and size of your vehicle's dashboard screen, if possible.\nBattery and Adaptive Power Mode\nApple updated the Battery section of the Settings app to provide a more in-depth look at how iPhone usage impacts battery life, and how much battery apps are draining.\nThe Battery section now displays a weekly view of battery usage along with a comparison of how much battery you're currently using compared to your typical average. You can see if you're using more, the same, or less battery life than you do on most days, with a readout of which apps are using the most battery, and by how much.\nApp battery usage includes specific details, such as letting you know if an app ran in the background longer, was on your screen longer, or sent more notifications than normal. You'll also see how much battery you've used since your last charge.\nApple also added an Adaptive Power mode that detects when iPhone usage is higher than normal and makes small performance adjustments like lowering display brightness or allowing certain background activities to take longer to extend battery life. Adaptive Power Mode is only available on the iPhone 15 Pro models and newer because it uses Apple Intelligence.\nOn the Lock Screen and in the Battery section, you'll see information on how long it will take your iPhone to charge up to full when it's plugged in.\nApple Intelligence Updates\nThere are new Apple Intelligence features throughout iOS 26, such as the Live Translation options in Phone, Messages, and FaceTime, and the suggestions and sorting options in the Reminders app. Some existing Apple Intelligence features have also been updated.\nVisual Intelligence\nIn iOS 26, Visual Intelligence works with screenshots for the first time. You can capture a screenshot of what's on your screen and then use Visual Intelligence on it to identify what you're looking at, find images, and get more information through ChatGPT.\nThere's a Highlight to Search option that lets you conduct an image search for a specific object in a screenshot, even if there are multiple things in the picture. It works with the apps that you use most frequently, like Google Search, Etsy, and others, and the feature is useful for finding a product in an image.\nIf you don't need to isolate one object in your screenshot, you can simply tap on the Ask button to ask questions about what you're seeing. Questions will be relayed to ChatGPT, and ChatGPT will provide the information. The Search button queries Google Search for more information.\nAs with the standard Visual Search, if your screenshot includes dates, times, and related information for an event, it can be added directly to your calendar.\nVisual Intelligence also adds support for quick identification of new types of objects. It can now identify art, books, landmarks, natural landmarks, and sculptures, in addition to the animals and plants it was able to provide information on before.\nGenmoji\nGenmoji supports combining two or more emoji together to create a new character. You can also combine existing emoji with text-based descriptions to tweak them, which is a more convenient starting point for generating something new.\nImage Playground\nApple added support for ChatGPT image generation capabilities, which means you can use several ChatGPT image styles when generating images. Options include Anime, Oil Painting, Watercolor, Vector, and Print.\nThere's also an open-ended option where you can tell ChatGPT what style you want, and you can make realistic images with this option. The new ChatGPT styles join the existing Animation, Sketch, and Illustration styles.\nNote that generating images with ChatGPT is limited if you do not have a ChatGPT subscription, so you cannot freely use the ChatGPT styles.\nChatGPT\nWith iOS 26, the ChatGPT Siri integration will use OpenAI's new GPT-5 model rather than GPT-4.\nGPT-5 brings enhanced reasoning capabilities and coding tools, along with better voice interaction and video perception.\nNew AirPods Features\niOS 26 adds several new features to the AirPods Pro 2 and the AirPods 4 through an accompanying AirPods firmware update.\nImproved Call Quality\nThe studio-quality recording feature brings more natural vocal texture and clarity to iPhone calls, FaceTime calls, and all CallKit-enabled apps like Zoom.\nBoth studio-quality audio recording and improved call quality are available across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and support the Camera app, Voice Memos, Messages dictation, third-party camera apps, and video conferencing apps.\nCamera Remote\nThe AirPods can be used as a camera remote with the Camera app and third-party camera apps on iPhone or iPad. Just press and hold on the AirPods stem to take a photo or start a video recording.\nWhen the recording is finished, a press and hold gesture will stop the recording. Apple says that users who like to capture themselves singing and dancing for social networks like TikTok will be able to easily perform in sync with a soundtrack while simultaneously recording video.\nSoftware Updates\nWith the latest software updates, Apple is finally adding a way to manually update the firmware on your AirPods. When your AirPods are connected, you can go to the Settings app to get to a new software update interface.\nPause for Sleep\nIf you're listening to music, a podcast, or a book while you're in bed and you're wearing AirPods, the AirPods will pause your audio when you fall asleep.\nRead More\nSmaller Changes\nThere are dozens if not hundreds of smaller changes in iOS 26, and we've highlighted some of the more notable ones below.\n- Custom Ringtones - You can set custom ringtones in iOS 26 without using GarageBand.
