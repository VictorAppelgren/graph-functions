  "content": "If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Savaria (TSE:SIS) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Savaria, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.12 = CA$115m \u00f7 (CA$1.1b - CA$173m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025).\n\nTherefore, Savaria has an ROCE of 12%. That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 12%.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Savaria\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Savaria compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Savaria .\n\nWhat The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us\n\nWhile the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 12% and the business has deployed 149% more capital into its operations. 12% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Savaria has consistently earned this amount. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.\n\nOur Take On Savaria's ROCE\n\nThe main thing to remember is that Savaria has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. Therefore it's no surprise that shareholders have earned a respectable 61% return if they held over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.\n\nIf you want to continue researching Savaria, you might be interested to know about the 2 warning signs that our analysis has discovered.",

      "text": "Results\n27\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is set to transform healthcare by enhancing diagnostics, personalizing medicine, boosting operational efficiency, expanding remote care, and accelerating research. AI outperforms humans in detecting diseases like cancer from scans, tailors treatments using genetic and lifestyle data, and streamlines hospital workflows with tools like predictive analytics and automated transcription. It powers telemedicine, monitors chronic conditions in real-time, and speeds up drug discovery by analyzing vast datasets for insights into complex diseases. Despite challenges like data privacy, bias, and integration costs, AI\u2019s ability to improve accuracy, access, and affordability could save billions and extend lives, marking a seismic shift in
