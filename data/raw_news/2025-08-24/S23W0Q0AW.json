      "text": "Benzinga Money is a reader-supported publication. We may earn a commission from the advertisers associated with this article. Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nThree of the same VC firms that backed Uber, Venmo, and eBay, respectively, are all investing in another private company: Pacaso.\nVenture backing in companies like Pacaso is nothing new. After all, early-stage companies often have the potential to deliver the most outsized returns.\nBut, recent regulatory updates have opened the door for individual investors to invest alongside these venture capitalists. Normally, everyday investors have to wait for a company to go public before they can invest, missing out on that early gain potential. Now, some companies are opening up investment opportunities to the public.\nThis type of investing has already seen some great success stories. For example, in 2016, 433 people invested an average of $2,730 in a private startup named Revolut. Fast-forward to today, those $2,730 stakes are worth over $1 million, up 89,900%.\nToday, thousands of investors have joined big-name VCs in taking a chance on Pacaso. It's no surprise, considering Pacaso's resum\u00e9:\n- The company has made $110M in gross profits to date\n- Pacaso's co-founder sold his last company to Zillow for $120M\n- They operate in over 40 vacation destinations across the US, Mexico, UK, and France\n- The company reserved the Nasdaq ticker PCSO\nBut the growth potential is where the excitement is. Below we'll reveal more about how Pacaso has ramped up and built a competitive moat so quickly, and how you can share in their growth.\nNext-Generation Co-Ownership\nAfter his $120M exit and subsequent role as a Zillow executive, Austin Allison created Pacaso\u2019s game-changing co-ownership model. Powered by proprietary tech and an innovative structure that eliminates the headaches of traditional vacation home ownership, it\u2019s already leaving a mark. Here\u2019s how:\n- Seamless Transactions: Clients easily buy, finance, and resell, shares of luxury homes through Pacaso\u2019s intuitive platform\n- Turnkey Ownership: Pacaso handles maintenance, scheduling, and furnishing; owners simply enjoy their vacation homes\n- Maximized Value: Homes that once sat empty up to 90% of the year now stay occupied nearly year-round, benefiting owners and local economies\nThe demand for their services and expertise is real. In top destinations, co-ownership is growing 21% annually in the US, and Pacaso homes have appreciated nearly 10% since 2021 \u2013 roughly double the growth of the broader luxury market.\nScaling Into 10 New International Destinations\nPacaso is already leading the charge in the $1.3 trillion US vacation home market, combining real estate innovation with tech-driven efficiency to generate multiple revenue streams. These include transaction service fees on every sale, recurring property management fees, and exclusive financing options tailored to co-owners.\nNow, the platform\u2019s global reach is growing quickly, and they\u2019re already seeing strong returns in the $500B global market. In 2024, they set records in Paris and London. Meanwhile, Cabo (Mexico) is the #3-most-searched destination on their platform. No surprise Europe and Mexico have accounted for 22% of their revenue over the past two years.\nNow, they\u2019re taking international expansion to an entirely new level. They recently announced 10 new international destinations will be added to their platform, spread across Italy, the Caribbean, and Mexico. That means Pacaso\u2019s unique model is poised to dominate a combined $1.8T in vacation home markets.\nWhy Investors Are Paying Attention\nThere are many reasons why firms managing a combined $180B+ in assets, and 10,000+ individual investors have already backed Pacaso, including:\n- Proven Leadership: Allison is joined by executives with decades of real-estate and startup experience.\n- Strong Growth Metrics: Full-year 2024 financials showed a 21% YoY increase in gross real estate volume and a 24% improvement in adjusted EBITDA.\n- Surging Demand: 40% of Americans want to buy a vacation home in the next year (Coldwell Banker)\nAfter impressive full-year earnings showed gross profit grew 41%, and with continued growth and expansion ahead, Pacaso is really hitting their stride.\nPacaso is offering securities through the use of an Offering Statement that has been qualified by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Tier II of Regulation A. A copy of the Final Offering Circular that forms a part of the Offering Statement may be obtained from: invest.pacaso.com. Reserving the ticker symbol is not a guarantee that the company will go public. Listing on the Nasdaq is subject to approvals.\nDon\u2019t Miss Your Chance to Become an Early Investor in Pacaso:\nDisclaimers\nPlease be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.

Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nFirst-time real estate investors can face several hurdles when trying to get started: high upfront costs, dealing with tenants and maintenance, finding and closing on a suitable property, and the fear that your initial investment won\u2019t see a return, just to name a few.\nNow, there\u2019s a company that handles all the grunt work and provides a money-back guarantee on your initial investment.\nIntroducing mogul, the simplest way to own income-producing blue chip real estate.\nFounded by former Goldman Sachs executives who have closed more than $10 billion in deals, they handle the sourcing, underwriting, and day-to-day management of every property.\nTo remove first-time jitters, mogul gives new investors their First-$10k Protection Guarantee: If your initial investment of up to $10,000 loses value in the first year, mogul refunds every lost dollar.\nInvestors in mogul portfolios have earned an average annualized return of 18.8%, paid out as monthly rental income plus appreciation.\nStart building a diversified property portfolio in minutes while mogul absorbs the downside.\n\u2018If we ever brag about a 4% IRR, I will quit\u2019\nAlex Blackwood and Joey Gumataotao, mogul\u2019s co-founders, routinely surpassed 15-20% annual returns when closing deals at Goldman Sachs. When they looked at other real estate investment platforms at the time, they found those companies would often brag to those investors about 4% annual returns on billions of dollars.\nAs Alex says on mogul\u2019s website, \u201cIf we ever brag about a 4% IRR, I will quit immediately.\u201d\nTo date, properties in mogul\u2019s portfolio have generated an average 10-12% annual cash-on-cash yield that hit users\u2019 accounts as rent dividends each month. When long-term appreciation is included, historical performance rises to an 18.8% annualized returns, giving investors both regular income and capital growth\nPart of their success is due to the fact that mogul mogul approves fewer than one percent of properties reviewed. Each candidate asset must clear a 12% bear case hurdle rate before moving to the next level of diligence.\nYou can browse eligible properties on mogul\u2019s website and buy part or all of a house in under 30 seconds, or use the same data and tools available to top real estate firms to underwrite any property across the U.S.\nRent collections are aggregated and distributed to investors every month. At the same time, independent third-party valuations refresh inside your dashboard, letting you watch equity climb in real time while still enjoying depreciation and other pass-through tax advantages unique to real estate.\nMore than $1.2 million was invested on mogul last month.\nDisclaimers\nPlease be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.
