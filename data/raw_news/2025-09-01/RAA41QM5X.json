  "description": "Believe it or not, you can get a motorcycle on Amazon that is shipped right to your door. However, this method has its advantages and disadvantages.",
  "content": "Yes, You Can Buy A Motorcycle On Amazon, But Should You? Pros & Cons, Explained\n\nAmazon is a place you can turn to when you need to buy a variety of random things because it carries such an extensive selection of goods. These days, ordering whatever you need off your phone has become second nature for many \u2014 even though there are some types of tools and tech you should avoid buying on Amazon. Although buying a motorcycle may seem like a purchase that is best to do in-person, you can actually get your next motorcycle on Amazon, which also sells lots of gadgets for motorcycle riders. There are plenty of things to consider before buying your first motorcycle, especially if you decide to buy the bike on Amazon. Ultimately, it boils down to doing some research to make sure the purchase is going to be legit. You'll want to look into who the seller is, what their reputation is like, where the bike is being shipped from, and whether there are any hidden fees. It's also a good idea to check if the bike has warranties and what the seller's return policy is like, just in case the bike isn't what you thought it was going to be. Perhaps the most important question to ask is the simplest: Should you buy a motorcycle off of Amazon, purely in the name of convenience? Let's discuss the pros and cons before you pull the trigger on that shiny new Amazon bike.\n\nBuying a motorcycle from Amazon is more convenient For many Amazon customers, the ease of sourcing products from this seemingly endless online bazaar is more appealing than visiting local brick-and-mortar shops. Some people may enjoy the process of visiting various dealers to talk to representatives and test ride their bikes before buying. But for those who consider all that a hassle, buying on Amazon could be a good option. Either way, it would definitely save you time, which is one advantage over buying one in-person. Another pro is that you may be able to have more options and brands available to you if you buy online compared to what is available in your local market. Although Amazon's selections are limited, this could be advantageous if you live far away from a dealership or other places where you could buy a bike in-person. Some vendors even offer free shipping, so the price you're getting on an Amazon purchase is roughly the same as what you'd be paying in-person. That being said, it may be best to double-check that there are no hidden shipping fees when buying a bike on Amazon.\n\nYou can't test out a bike purchased online The most obvious disadvantage to buying a bike online is that there's no test drive option. That means you're going in blind without being able to assess the performance of the bike firsthand. You also cannot get a true sense of the bike's physicality and how it feels relative to your body. This might not be that big of a deal for experienced riders who know what bike they want and are already familiar with it, but it's probably a good idea for newer riders to visit a dealer and spend time test-driving a bike before sourcing one online. Another con is that, while delivery can be free in some instances, other vendors on Amazon charge exorbitant shipping fees to deliver bikes, running as high as $400.00. Additionally, you'll want to confirm that Amazon sends the Manufacturer Statement of Origin (MSO) and bill of sale with your purchase so that you can make your bike street legal. This information is usually included on the listing, but it's worth double-checking before buying as any delays here could slow down the process of getting insurance and getting on the road. Some bikes also require you to do some assembly on your own, so riders who don't feel comfortable with some installations might head to the dealership instead. Lastly, it might be more complicated to get something fixed on the bike if you buy online, whereas if you buy from a dealership you can simply ride your bike back for repairs. Sure, having the X-PRO 250 Roadster delivered to your door sounds great, but you should think twice before purchasing one on Amazon.",

      "text": "Everything You Need To Know Before Buying Your First Motorcycle\nSo you've decided to buy a motorcycle. Congratulations! Motorcycling is the beloved hobby of many riders, and for good reason. The open road, the sensation of speed, and the wind in your hair all add up to an experience that can be thrilling, zen, and terrifying all at once.\nHowever, buying your first motorcycle can be daunting. It's a Catch-22: You need the experience to know what you want in a motorcycle, but you need a motorcycle to gain that experience. Don't worry, we've got you covered. With decades of riding under our collective belts, SlashGear has the expertise and knowledge about what to consider when searching for your first love.\nRead on as we examine everything you need to know about buying your first motorcycle, including getting licensed, finding the right gear, determining your preferred riding style, and combing through the myriad engine and riding options on the market today.\nSafety first, last, and always\nIt goes without saying, but we'll say it anyway: motorcycling is a dangerous hobby. Unlike cars, there is no steel cage, no airbags, and no seatbelts. A motorcycle's slim profile doesn't catch attention the way a full-sized vehicle does, making it especially dangerous in this era of distracted driving. Even minor accidents can have devastating consequences.\nBefore you venture into the world of motorcycles, the first stop you should make is a motorcycle safety course. The Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF), a national not-for-profit organization, offers a unique environment for both novice and advanced riders to practice new skills in a safe setting.\nEach state has varying policies regarding motorcycle licensing. You can find details regarding your locality on the MSF website. The course usually provides a good beginner motorcycle along with classroom and practical instruction on the basics. Maybe you've grown up on dirt bikes or ATVs or are a previous rider returning to the saddle; the MSF course can still teach or refresh the skills you need to stay safe. It even offers options for advanced riders to continue their education.\nWhile it's possible in some areas to get licensed by riding with someone with a valid motorcycle license and passing a road test, this approach has risks. Even experienced riders can develop bad habits, which they might inadvertently pass on to you. For the safest learning experience, look to the professionals.\nDetermine what kind of riding you want to do\nBefore buying your first motorcycle, ask yourself what kind of riding you actually want to do.\nThere are two broad styles of motorcycle riding: on-road and off-road. Off-road bikes have suspensions with lots of play, resulting in taller motorcycles with knobby tires that help dig into the dirt. These may include street-legal dirtbikes, dual-sports, and adventure bikes.\nOn-road bikes tend to have smoother tires, lower clearance requirements, and a wider variety of engines. Street bikes range from ultra-comfortable cruisers with amenities on par with luxury cars to supersport bikes, which are essentially street-legal racing motorcycles.\nDeciding which type of riding you wish to do will inform every other aspect of your motorcycle buying experience. It might be hard to decide, but envision yourself riding. Are you going for long Sunday rides once per week? Commuting to and from work daily? Do you anticipate taking your motorcycle to the local track or drag strip once you have enough experience?\nIt is important to find the Goldilocks bike that is just right for you to learn and grow into. Rest assured, most manufacturers have a range of bikes, from those suitable for beginners to those best reserved for advanced riders.\nTypes of motorcycles\nOnce you've determined what type of riding you wish to do, parsing out which bike best suits that style is next. These are the main motorcycle types every rider should know:\n- Cruisers are heavier bikes with low saddles suitable for long rides. Picture the chrome Harley-Davidson in your neighbor's garage or one of the Japanese imitations.\n- Sportbikes are lightweight, usually high-revving, and have high power-to-weight ratios. They tend to sacrifice rider comfort for performance.\n- Tourers prioritize rider and passenger comfort over other considerations, unlike sportbikes. Nonetheless, they can be very powerful and fast and tend to be heavy.\n- Sport Tourers are sportbikes with nods to comfort like a more relaxed riding posture and optional luggage.\n- Dual Sports combine off-road equipment like high ground clearances and advanced suspensions with on-road requirements like brake lights, headlights, and turn signals.\n- Adventure bikes are sturdy, robust motorcycles equally comfortable on a rugged trail as a national highway. They can be rigged for everything from cross-continent adventure trips to daily commutes.\n- Standard/Naked commuter bikes are suitable for on-road use and short-to-medium length joyrides.\n- Scooters/Minis are small, light bikes with low displacement engines meant primarily for short-duration rides.\nWhile some advise against new riders beginning on types like supersport bikes, they can learn to ride any of the above categories depending on their maturity level. Prospective buyers would do well to consider the motorcycle's size, weight, and dimensions, and how it may work with their own body type.\nBike dimensions and body type\nUnlike cars, motorcycles require whole-body physical input for optimal operation. They become an extension of your body while you ride. The lightest motorcycles on the market weigh as little as 225 pounds, while the heaviest can weigh over 1,000 pounds.\nFinding an appropriate size and weight for your body type is paramount. A 5-foot, 1-inch rider who weighs 100 pounds will not be comfortable on a bike suited to someone who is 6 feet, 5 inches tall and weighs 300 pounds. The same goes in the opposite direction. A heavy rider on a light bike will negatively impact the performance. It's not just about acceleration; overloaded bikes suffer in all aspects of riding, including cornering and braking.\nCounterintuitively, it is low-speed maneuvering that challenges new riders. Bikes become more nimble and light-feeling at speed, but low speeds make them feel unwieldy and heavy. Ideally, a rider could plant both feet firmly on the ground at stop lights and maintain control over their machine in all situations.\nSaddle height is a critically overlooked specification when it comes to motorcycle shopping. It represents the height of the motorcycle's seat. Comparing it against your inseam will provide a helpful clue as to whether that bike is too tall (or too short) for you.\nWhile someone of the most diminutive stature could drive a large truck, a good motorcycle fits its rider-like clothing. An ill-fitting, underpowered bike can be just as dangerous as one that's too powerful.\nErgonomics\nMotorcycle riding can be uncomfortable, and much of that is dictated by the riding style you want. For instance, cruisers offer a relaxed, feet-forward riding position, while adventure bikes provide a more upright stance. Supersport bikes require hunched riding positions. Luxury tourers like the Honda Gold Wing or Harley Davidson Road Glide are essentially very expensive couches with wheels.\nAny part of the motorcycle you touch with your body can cause discomfort. Handle grips, footpegs, controls, and the seat are all common culprits. All have the potential for an aftermarket upgrade in case you find one wanting, but what's not as easily adjustable is the all-important rider triangle.\nThe rider triangle accounts for the distance and angles between the three primary contact points of a motorcycle: saddle, grips, and pegs. It is a crucial aspect of motorcycle comfort. It's important to understand that this space is occupied by your entire body. If you find yourself having to scrunch up or stretch out to engage with all three points, that may not be the right bike for you.\nWhat feels comfortable for 10 minutes while chatting with the salesman may feel very different after hours of hard riding.\nThe poster boy for performance over comfort is the supersport Yamaha YZF-R1 (absolutely not a beginner bike). It employs a paper-thin plastic pad for a saddle and has a very cramped rider triangle. More beginner-friendly sports bikes like the Kawasaki Ninja 400 and 650 are also guilty of this.\nEngine type and power delivery.\nThere is no hard and fast rule regarding what displacement is best for beginners. Engine type and how it delivers power are just as important.\nHere is a brief rundown of the main engine types and their primary characteristics:\n- Single cylinder engines are lightweight, small, and provide low-end torque over top speed power.\n- Parallel twin engines use a pair of side-by-side cylinders. They are versatile and provide more mid-range power than a single.\n- Flat-twin engines are a popular choice for adventure and cruising bikes. They feature a low center of gravity and a broad powerband.\n- Inline-three or -four engines prioritize horsepower over torque and can range in power delivery from stable to touchy. They are often found in sports and standard motorcycles.\n- V-configuration engines can have 2 to 8 cylinders. Most commonly arranged as twins, these motors produce torque across a wide power band.\nEngine type can matter just as much as the displacement. The 600cc inline-four in the high-revving Yamaha R6 sportbike will act, feel, and deliver power entirely differently from the 600cc V-twin in the iconic Honda Shadow cruiser. While a good rule of thumb is to start on a small or middleweight displacement bike, the perfect beginner bike will come down to a combination of riding type, ergonomics, rider and motorcycle dimensions, and power delivery. The best beginner bike is one you can start on comfortably and grow into along with your skills.\nDress for the slide, not the ride\nLet's talk gear. You'll never go awry by getting quality gear and wearing it every time you ride. Helmets are so crucial we'll examine them in a separate section, but riding jackets, gloves, pants, and footwear are all motorcycle accessories that will make any ride safer \u2014 you should get it all.\nOn most motorcycles, riders manipulate the rear brake and the shifter with their feet. Long laces can get caught on equipment at bad times, and simple sneakers will shred to nothing in an accident. Sturdy, ankle-supporting boots made from leather or synthetic armored material are best.\nAnything that survives prolonged, high-speed contact with the road will save you from the scourge of every rider: road rash. Many riders are satisfied with rugged denim jeans and leather jackets, but purpose-built riding clothing is best. Many manufacturers also make clothing with built-in Kevlar pads to protect from abrasions in an accident. The instinct to brace a fall with your hands means armored or leather gloves are also a must.\nEvery rider should get goggles or other purpose-built eyewear in lieu of a full-face helmet. Wind at high speeds causes eye irritation and can lead to dangerous situations. Non-motorcycle eyewear may not keep the wind at bay and could shatter on impact.\nAll clothing should be comfortable and fit correctly. Thinking about how cold you are or how tight your jacket is will only distract you from paying attention to the road.\nHelmets\nLet's not sugarcoat it: The helmet is the most critical gear a rider can get. Some states may not mandate helmets, but they are absolutely necessary. The consequences of not wearing one can be severe. Every time you mount your bike, remember: no excuses, wear your helmet.\nThe most common helmet certifications include the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), the Economic Commission of Europe (ECE), Snell (voluntary testing undertaken by the Snell Memorial Foundation), and FIM (a requirement for certain racing bodies). A helmet with one or more of these certifications has undergone testing to specific safety standards. Uncertified helmets not only won't provide the proper level of protection, but are illegal in many places where helmets are required.\nThe second consideration is fit. Not all heads are the same size. A too tight or loose helmet will not provide the same efficacy as a properly fitted one. The right helmet will feel a little tight while providing even pressure at contact points. Many manufacturers offer fitting guides for their products that compare sizes to the measurements of your head.\nHelmets come in many styles, but full-face options are best. In addition to providing a built-in visor that eliminates the need for goggles, a full-face helmet protects parts of your face that half-shell helmets do not. Some riders prefer half-shell options, but ideally, no part of your body will be exposed during a ride.\nCheck out our guide to every major motorcycle helmet brand to get started.\nAncillary costs\nMany automotive shoppers consider the price of the vehicle the most important consideration, and they're not wrong. But remember that motorcycling comes with several other costs, some one-time and others repeating.\nOne example of a one-time cost is the purchase of gear. A high-quality, complete set of riding equipment, may cost a significant amount, but it's an investment in your safety and comfort on the road. It's the item you should least want to scrimp on.\nInsurance costs will depend on the type of motorcycle, the rider's age, and other factors. A 19-year-old on a supersport will see higher rates than a 45-year-old on a parallel twin standard. A liability-only policy averages $68 per month or $816 annually, while a full-coverage policy averages $148 monthly or $1,776 yearly. The overall average is about $108 per month or $1,296 annually. Not having insurance can leave you vulnerable to significant financial risk in the event of an accident, making it a crucial aspect of ownership.\nMost of the time, if a car breaks down, you can pull safely to the side of the road. A malfunction on a motorcycle can have much harsher consequences. Keeping every facet of your bike in excellent operation is imperative.\nThe cost of motorcycle maintenance ranges from $800 to $1,500 annually, but it's a small price to pay for peace of mind. Regular maintenance is not just a cost but a responsibility to yourself and others on the road.\nThe round-up\nLearning to ride and buying a motorcycle may be the best thing you've ever done for yourself. There's little doubt that the freedom and thrill of the open road taps into the souls of people everywhere, but the whole endeavor can be a little overwhelming. Someone could probably do a doctoral dissertation on what you should know before buying your first motorcycle, but it shakes down to a few basic tenets.\nFirst, begin learning how to ride in a safe and controlled environment. You'll never regret taking a class before purchasing a bike. No one ever suffered from additional experience.\nNext, determine what type of riding you want to do. This will inform most of your needs surrounding engine type, motorcycle dimensions, and what kind of gear to get.\nThird, narrow down the bikes that meet your requirements. Explore the lineups, research power numbers, haunt forums, and ask questions. Knowledge is power.\nLastly, go riding! Start slow, avoid traffic, practice in parking lots, and have fun! Just remember, always keep your head on a swivel. Motorcycling is an activity you must actively participate in at every moment to stave off disaster. But, done well and with a bit of luck, it could be a lifelong passion. Happy riding!"

      "text": "5 Of The Best Gadgets For Motorcycle Riders\nSome riders take the approach that the best kind of ride is one that's free of distraction \u2013 the kind of ride where nothing gets in the way of the connection between the rider and the machine. No screens, no tech, no motorcycle accessories whatsoever. While there's certainly some appeal to embracing the purity of that kind of ride, there is also a case to be made for embracing a few modern gadgets that will increase comfort, improve safety, and maybe even keep you from getting lost along the way. After all, how much can you enjoy the ride if you've lost track of your friends and you don't know where you're going?\nWith this list, we go over several gadgets, ranging from simple mounting hardware to sleek communication systems that will improve your riding experience. We've put together this list of some of the best motorcycle gadgets by using them all in the real world, riding with them, and sometimes trading out old tech for new \u2014 fine-tuning the riding experience as a result. Everything listed below is tried and tested. As different kinds of riding will facilitate the use of unique gadgets, this list is put together with a wide range of riding styles in mind. From long highway cruises to back-road twisties, there's a gadget for everyone. A more in-depth explanation of our methodology is available at the end of this list.\nSatellite Communicator - Garmin inReach Mini 2\nRiding alone, especially in scenic areas, can be one of the most rewarding parts of owning a motorcycle. Being out in the mountains, breathing fresh air and soaking up the beautiful views is a major part of why I ride. However, more often than not, being out on the road in the middle of nowhere means I don't have cell service. Furthermore, being alone without cell service on a motorcycle is the optimal time and place for a minor problem to turn into a major one. A small crash that leaves you unable to ride, could become much worse if you're unable to call for help. That's where a device like the Garmin inReach Mini 2 comes into play.\nThe inReach, and other GPS devices like it, allow for SOS alerts, two-way messaging, and location sharing \u2014 all without cell signal. As an added bonus, these features are available in more than just riding scenarios. I often go on hikes in unfamiliar places, and it's always wise to have some sort of emergency lifeline. The discontinued inReach Mini (pictured above) and the latest, upgraded iteration of the gadget, the inReach Mini 2, is small enough and light enough to bring on any hiking or backpacking trip. When it's turned off, it holds a charge for up to a year. When it's being used for activity tracking, the inReach's battery can still last for several days \u2014 more than enough for most motorcycle trips. The convenient strap means you can clip it to the outside of a motorcycle jacket or along your belt loop and it'll be in a good spot for pressing the emergency SOS button should you need it.\nHelmet Communication/Speaker System - Cardo Packtalk Edge\nI've used multiple helmet communication systems throughout the years, along with many different audio systems. In my early moto days, there were even a number of times I just used regular headphones to keep the tunes going. The reality is that in-ear headphones can become dislodged when you put on your helmet, or they can easily shift in the middle of the ride, and the last thing you want is to pull over to fish an ear-bud out of your helmet on the side of the freeway. They also tend to drown out or block ambient noise. Fortunately, helmet-mounted speakers and bluetooth headsets provide audio, without drowning out all ambient noise, and if you've connected the system to your phone's GPS \u2014 you can get voice directions in your headset as you ride.\nIn the past, I've used systems like Sena's 20S Evo, which works well and is extremely easy to use when you've got gloves on. The large, tactile knob for controlling volume is a smart solution for thick gloves and the big singular button in the center helps too. Unfortunately, it causes real wind resistance at speed \u2014 especially on a bike with no windscreen. Slimmer systems like the Cardo Packtalk Edge tuck in nicely against the side of my helmet. Cardo's speaker quality is also pretty impressive for the price, providing enough volume to listen to music or podcasts at highway speeds.\nLighting - Light Mode Night Shift\nBeing seen is a top concern for riders \u2014 especially when riding at night. It might feel cool to dress up like Batman in all black and zoom through your local downtown area, but being harder to spot could increase the likelihood of an accident. Lighting kits like the LightMode Night Shift use sticker-mounted LEDs to make you much more visible \u2014 at the highest point possible, your helmet. The app used to connect to LightMode is easy to use, intuitive, and it provides all sorts of cool animations and color sequences for the helmet lights. Less expensive kits are available, with fewer features, but I like the customization levels that are built into the Night Shift model.\nOther lighting systems can be connected to your brakes, essentially providing a very high-mounted third brake light on the back of your helmet. I opted for LightMode because I wanted to be seen from the side and the rear. This particular system was optimized for my AGV helmet. LightMode also provided an impressive level of customer service \u2014 when one of the two LED strips on my helmet was damaged after a year of riding, they sold me just the replacement piece I needed \u2014 no requirement to purchase an entirely new kit. Don't expect the battery that powers the LED lights to last all night, but there's definitely enough battery life to provide side lighting for an evening commute.\nPhone Mount - RAM X-Grip\nIf you're not the type of rider that wants to hear directions pumped into your helmet, or if you want to see your text message, e-mail, and phone notifications while you ride, a phone mount is likely in order. Systems like Quad Lock and Ram Mounts are some of the best mounts for your ride. These mounts are typically attached to the handlebars, giving your smartphone screen a place front and center on your ride. That means you can look at maps, find lunch stops, even see important alerts, all without fiddling around in your pocket for your phone. And, if you've got smartphone-sensitive gloves, you can interact with your phone on the mount along the way (provided you've come to a stop and it's safe to do so, of course).\nI'm not a huge fan of the case required to use a quad-lock system, so on my motorcycles I've opted for RAM Mounts' X-Grip kit and it's never failed me. Even at highway speeds, the system is stable and my phone feels secure when it's strapped in properly. Regardless of which system you purchase be sure to invest in a vibration dampener as well. It absorbs some of the impact from your motorcycle going over bumpy roads and terrain, plus it can help protect some of the more sensitive parts of your smartphone.\nTire Repair Kit - BikeMaster Tire and Tube Flat Repair\nIt isn't exactly a high-tech gadget, but I never leave home without some sort of tire repair kit. Simple tire repair kits are available on sites like Revzilla and Amazon and they're reasonably priced. I opt for the compressed CO2 cartridges with my repair kit because they are small enough to store under your seat, or in a side bag or fanny pack. They generally inflate a flat tire pretty quickly too, making it easy to get back on the road in very little time.\nI keep a BikeMaster Tire and Tube Flat Repair Kit with me regardless of what kind of bike I'm riding. Some riders may prefer a battery-powered inflator for its convenience, but I find those to be a bit cumbersome and harder to fit in the tight spaces beneath my passenger seat. Some of the battery-powered systems also allow you to charge your cell phone from the battery pack, but be careful \u2014 if you've drained all the power to charge your phone, fixing a flat will be out of the question. One final note: adding a small pair of pliers to your flat repair kit is a wise move. You'll want the pliers for removing nails or screws that have embedded in your tire and caused the flat in the first place.\nMethodology\nHaving personally used all the items on this list, logging hundreds of miles on multiple motorcycles with them in my arsenal, I can say that they're all a benefit for the time I spend on my motorcycles. I chose this particular range of gadgets for the varied benefits they can offer a rider. They improve my peace of mind, make my riding experience better, and give me all sorts of options for the kinds of rides I want to go on. These specific products are tried and tested, plus all are favorably reviewed by a large group of consumers. Product drawbacks noted by customers were also taken into account in the selection process.\nCommunication systems that allow you to talk to other riders can help keep large group rides organized. Satellite devices can send a help signal when cell phone service isn't available. Bright lights can make you more visible at night and help prevent accidents (it doesn't hurt that they give things a Tron vibe too). A phone mount helps keep you connected when necessary. And a tire repair kit has helped me and my riding friends out of several sticky situations, negating the need for a tow truck or a tire change in a remote location. All of these benefits are possible through some modern, relatively affordable gadgets."

      "text": "10 Types Of Tools And Tech You Should Avoid Buying On Amazon\nWhen it comes to shopping on Amazon, the convenience and endless variety can be hard to resist. Unfortunately, not every deal is a steal. Some tools and tech gadgets are better left in your virtual cart to save you money, time, and a lot of headaches. Knowing which products to steer clear of can make your online shopping a whole lot smoother.\nAmazon's massive selection is a big part of its charm, but that's also where things get tricky. Not everything with a five star rating is actually a great buy. Sometimes those eye-catching prices and glowing reviews mask some pretty big disappointments. We have all been there \u2014 excited about a bargain that turns out to be a total dud. In some cases, these products aren't just frustrating \u2014 they can be downright dangerous, as indicated by a recent decision from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) that found Amazon responsible hazardous products sold by third party sellers.\nBeing a savvy shopper means knowing when to hit that Buy Now button and when to walk away. By being a bit more cautious and doing your homework, you can avoid the pitfalls of low quality purchases. This way, you are left with tools and tech that actually deliver on their promises and make your life easier and your shopping experience way more satisfying. Let's look at some specific types of tools and tech that deserve a second thought before you click Add to Cart.\nPressure washers\nBuying a pressure washer on Amazon may seem like a convenient place to snag one, but it is one of those tools you should avoid purchasing from this platform. Ever heard the phrase buyer beware? Well, it applies here.\nAccording to a 2021 report from KIRO 7 News Seattle, over one million pressure washer spray guns sold at Lowe's and Amazon were recalled due to a faulty connector. The recalled spray guns were reported to have connectors that could break under pressure, which could pose a great risk of injury. The recall followed 15 reported incidents, including 13 injuries that required medical treatment for post-concussion, broken bones, and injuries to the eyes and mouth \u2014 not exactly what you want from a cleaning tool, right?\nThe quality of pressure washers on Amazon can be inconsistent. Many brands you have never heard of offer cheaper models that seem like a bargain. These models often lack the power and durability needed for heavy duty cleaning tasks. You may end up with a machine that breaks down after a few uses. Counterfeit products are also a big concern. Pressure washers from brands that are well known are often targets for knockoffs. These counterfeit units look like the real thing but perform poorly and can be very unsafe.\nAlso consider the maintenance and parts availability. Pressure washers need regular maintenance and sometimes replacement parts. Buying from a local dealer usually means easier access to parts and service, which can be crucial for the longevity of your machine.\nRenewed or refurbished iPhones\nIf you are eyeing that shiny, pre-loved iPhone on Amazon, think twice. Snagging a renewed or refurbished iPhone on Amazon to save a few bucks sounds pretty good. But is it really worth it?\nFirst off, what does renewed or refurbished really mean? Well, it could be anything from a returned phone that has barely been touched to one that has had major repairs, which is where things get tricky. Amazon doesn't always have the strictest quality control on these things. There have been instances where customers received iPhones that were far from \"like new.\" We are talking dead batteries, glitchy software, and even missing parts \u2014 not exactly the bargain one hopes for.\nRemember, a phone isn't just about making calls and scrolling through social media. It is your camera, your wallet, and most importantly \u2014 your connection to the world. You don't want to trust that to a device with a questionable history.\nHere's another thing \u2014 warranties. With renewed iPhones, the warranty may be shorter or less comprehensive than with a brand new one. So, if something goes wrong, you may be out of luck. Of course, not every renewed iPhone on Amazon is a lemon. There are things that you can consider before buying a renewed iPhone, but the risk is there. Is it really worth it? You may save a few bucks upfront, but end up paying more in the long run with repairs \u2014 or another replacement.\nLarge appliances\nBuying large appliances is a big deal, right? They cost an arm and a leg, so you want to make sure you are getting something reliable that is going to last. While Amazon may seem convenient with all its choices, it is often not the best idea.\nTo begin with, there is the issue of shipping and handling. Large appliances are heavy yet delicate, which makes them prone to damage during transit. Unlike smaller items, these high-value purchases require careful handling, which isn't always guaranteed with Amazon's delivery services. And returning or replacing a bulky appliance? That is a whole other headache.\nThen there is the warranty issue. Sure, Amazon may offer some kind of warranty, but it is often not as comprehensive as what you would get from a dedicated appliance store. Let's not forget about installation. Many large appliances require professional installation to work properly and safely. Amazon may offer installation services, but they often come at an extra cost and may not be available in all areas.\nThere is no doubt that Amazon does have some good deals on appliances from time to time. However, before you click that Buy Now button, we recommend that you do your research. Check out local appliance stores, compare prices and warranties, and read reviews from other customers. Keep in mind the risk you take when buying certain large appliances online. When it comes to large appliances, the convenience of buying on Amazon may not be worth the potential headaches. Sometimes, the old-fashioned way of shopping is still the best way to go.\nNo-name phone chargers or chargers with dubious discounts\nWhen you are shopping for phone chargers on Amazon, it is tempting to grab one of those no-name brands or the ones with those crazy discounts that seem too good to be true. They are all over Amazon and promise fast charging for a fraction of the price of branded options.\nEveryone loves a good deal, but if a charger is being offered at a ridiculously low price, there is probably a reason for it. It is likely made with cheap materials and could even lack the necessary safety certifications. These chargers often cut corners on safety features and quality components. They may not have proper insulation or overcurrent protection. This lack of quality control means they can overheat, catch fire, or even cause electric shocks.\nIn some cases, Amazon has had to recall these products due to safety concerns. For example, in July of 2023, the CPSC reported that Amazon had to recall portable chargers that were exclusively sold on Amazon due to the risk of fire hazards. This alone should make you think twice about those tempting discounts.\nSo, what should you do instead? Stick with reputable brands or even the charger that came with your phone. They may cost a bit more, but they are designed to meet safety standards and won't fry your phone's internals. Your phone is an expensive investment, and risking it with a shady charger just isn't worth it.\nCheap rechargeable batteries and power banks\nRechargeable batteries are a lifesaver, especially when you are away in the wilderness. But those dirt-cheap ones on Amazon? Hard pass. I have personally learned my lesson the hard way with these things. Not only do they barely hold a charge, but they can also be downright dangerous. Cheap rechargeable batteries tend to have lower capacity and shorter lifespans compared to their more expensive counterparts. This means they will need to be charged more often and replaced sooner \u2014 this defeats the purpose of saving money in the first place.\nSafety is another big concern as many inexpensive rechargeable batteries are not manufactured to high safety standards. You have probably seen those horror stories of cheap batteries overheating or even exploding. If you need more convincing, just do a quick search online for \"Amazon recalls cheap batteries.\" You will find plenty of articles about dodgy batteries that have been pulled from the site due to safety concerns. In fact, it has happened before that Amazon has had to recall its own AmazonBasics portable power banks due to safety risks, per the CPSC.\nAnother major concern worth considering is the environmental impact. Batteries of poor quality tend to fail quickly and contribute to electronic waste. They end up in landfills sooner, which adds to the growing problem of e-waste. Investing in higher-quality batteries may seem more expensive upfront, but it is definitely better for the environment in the long run.\nDeWalt tools and accessories\nIt is not that DeWalt is bad. In fact, DeWalt is actually a top-notch brand. The issue is with Amazon. The risk with buying DeWalt tools and accessories on Amazon is that they have been known to have a lot of counterfeit DeWalt products floating around. You may think you are getting a sweet deal on that drill set, but it could be a knock-off that will break after a few uses. Once again, the CPSC reports that there have been cases of Amazon recalling DeWalt tools due to safety concerns \u2014 not exactly something you want to mess with.\nSo, what is the alternative? Honestly, your best bet is to head to a local hardware store or a specialized tool retailer. It may not be as convenient as clicking a button, but it is worth it. You will get to see the tools in person, hold them in your hands, and make sure you are getting the real deal. Plus, the staff at these places usually know their stuff and can give you some good advice.\nIf you really want to buy online, look at DeWalt's official website or a reputable tool retailer. They are more likely to have genuine products and better customer service. Sure, it may cost a bit more, but in the long run, you will be saving money and avoiding headaches. Remember, good tools are an investment, so don't cut corners.\nSolar panels\nSolar panels are another product you may want to think twice about buying on Amazon. Although it may seem convenient, it is not always the best idea. The risk with buying solar panels on Amazon is similar to other high-ticket purchase items \u2014 quality and authenticity issues.\nFirst off, there is the problem of counterfeit products. Fake solar panels may not provide the efficiency or durability that genuine ones do. This means you could end up with panels that don't produce enough energy, fail prematurely, or even pose safety risks. Another concern is the reliability of third-party sellers. On Amazon, it is often unclear who you are buying from. Many third-party sellers don't offer the same level of customer service or warranty support that you would get from a reputable solar company. If something goes wrong with your panels, getting help or a replacement can be quite a hassle.\nSolar panels also require proper installation to work efficiently and safely. When buying from Amazon, you don't get the professional installation services that many reputable solar companies offer. Poor installation can lead to inefficient energy production or even damage to the panels and your property. Improperly functioning solar panels can cause fire risks and electrical explosions \u2014 something that CNBC reports that Amazon itself had to deal with back in 2022.\nBaby toys and items\nWhen it comes to buying baby toys and items on Amazon, caution is essential. There is no doubt that it does seem convenient to order from Amazon in the comfort of your home. However, there are several reasons why you should think twice before adding those colorful rattles and plush toys to your cart.\nThe quality and safety of baby products sold on Amazon can be hit or miss. Amazon's marketplace is filled with third-party sellers from around the globe \u2014 very unlike the specialized baby stores that have stringent quality checks. On more than one occasion, there have been instances where Amazon had to recall baby products due to safety concerns. The CPSC reported one such case with the recall of Kids2 Rocking Sleepers in 2019, which posed serious risks to infants, highlighting the potential hazards of buying baby items from a platform where the quality control can vary greatly.\nAmazon has also been grappling with the problem of fake items being sold under well known brand names. The BBC reports that these counterfeits can be particularly dangerous when it comes to baby products, especially toys, as they may contain harmful materials or small parts that could be a choking hazard. The reviews on Amazon can sometimes be misleading, too. It is not uncommon for sellers to use fake reviews to boost their ratings. This makes it difficult for parents to gauge the true quality of a baby product.\nMilwaukee power tools\nMilwaukee makes great tools. Their reputation is solid, and you want that quality. However, when it comes to buying Milwaukee power tools on Amazon, you may want to think twice \u2014 it can be a bit of a gamble.\nFirst off, the authenticity issue is huge. There have been plenty of reports of counterfeit Milwaukee tools on Amazon, and the problem is so widespread that Milwaukee even has a website to report fraudulent sellers. You may think you are getting a sweet deal, but end up with a knock-off that breaks in a week. Not worth it. Plus, with power tools, you want expert advice. A good dealer can help you choose the right tool for the job and answer your questions. That is something you just won't get on Amazon.\nEven if you do get the real deal, there are other problems. Milwaukee has very strict rules about who can sell their products, and unauthorized sellers aren't covered. Amazon isn't an authorized marketplace for their products, so their retailers can't sell them there. This means if something goes wrong, you are out of luck and potentially a lot of money as well.\nCustomer support can also be a hassle. If you encounter a problem with a tool purchased from Amazon, dealing with the seller and resolving the issue can be more complicated than going through an authorized dealer. Amazon's return policies may not always be as straightforward when it comes to third-party sellers \u2014 adding more to the frustration.\nRyobi tools and batteries\nRyobi \u2014 known for its bright green power tools and affordable price point \u2014 may seem like a tempting bargain on Amazon. However, potential buyers should exercise caution. While Amazon offers convenience and competitive prices, buying Ryobi tools and batteries from unauthorized sellers on the platform can lead to issues with warranty claims and product authenticity.\nFirst, there have been reports of fake Ryobi tools and batteries being sold on Amazon. These knock-offs look nearly identical to the real thing, but they don't offer the same quality or durability. Buying a fake can mean wasted money and potential safety hazards. Issues with warranty and returns are also common. Many third-party sellers on Amazon may not honor Ryobi's warranty. If your tool breaks or doesn't perform as expected, you could be stuck with a dud.\nAnother concern is the condition of the products. Some users have reported receiving used or damaged Ryobi tools and batteries from Amazon. This is particularly troubling when you are expecting a brand new item. Tools and batteries that arrive in poor condition can be dangerous to use and may fail prematurely. So, do yourself a favor and head to a local authorized dealer such as Home Depot. You will get peace of mind and the support you need if anything goes wrong."

  "argos_summary": "Amazon offers a convenient way to buy motorcycles, providing a wide selection and often free shipping, which can be attractive for buyers in remote areas. However, the lack of test rides, potential high shipping costs, and the need to verify seller reputation, warranties, and delivery of essential documents (MSO, bill of sale) add significant risk. Assembly requirements and difficulty accessing repair services further complicate ownership compared to buying from a dealer. Overall, buyers should weigh the convenience against these logistical and quality concerns before purchasing a motorcycle on Amazon.",
