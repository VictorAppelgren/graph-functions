      "summary": "Defense stocks have surged this year as European governments raise military budgets, prompting analysts to predict a significant boost in industrial metals demand. Goldman Sachs estimates that EU defense spending could increase by 2.7% of GDP by 2027, adding roughly €167 billion, with about 40% directed toward metal‑heavy equipment. This rearmament is expected to raise Europe's overall industrial metal demand by 6%, adding 0.9% to copper, 1.3% to nickel, and 0.4% to steel consumption. Copper, integral to military systems and AI data centers, could see its global demand growth rise from 2% to 2.4% annually, potentially pushing prices toward $10,000–$10,750 per metric ton in 2026–2027.",
