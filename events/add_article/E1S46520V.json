      "summary": "The global non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment market is projected to grow rapidly through 2035, driven by advances in immunotherapies, targeted therapies, and combination regimens that improve survival and reduce side effects. Key innovations include immune checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab), EGFR/ALK/ROS1 inhibitors, and emerging CAR‑T and vaccine approaches, alongside liquid biopsy and companion diagnostics that broaden patient access. However, high drug costs, resistance, and limited awareness in low‑ and middle‑income regions remain significant barriers, prompting major pharma players to pursue collaborations and R&D to expand affordable options and early detection strategies.",
