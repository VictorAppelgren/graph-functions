      "title": "AI data centers made Americans' electricity bills 30% higher",
      "summary": "Electricity bills for Americans are projected to rise significantly due to the increasing energy demands of data centers owned by major tech companies, which consumed over 4% of the nation's electricity in 2023 and could rise to 12% by 2028. This surge is largely driven by the growth of artificial intelligence, with average electricity costs expected to increase by 8% nationwide and up to 25% in states with high data center concentrations. Despite tech companies' assurances that they will not pass costs onto consumers, their lobbying and investment strategies suggest otherwise, raising concerns about the impact on household bills and emissions.",
