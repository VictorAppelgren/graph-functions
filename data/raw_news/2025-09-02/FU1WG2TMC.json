  "title": "8 Mistakes First-Generation Family Offices Make (And How To Avoid Them)",
  "description": "By recognizing these potential issues early on, and taking practical steps to mitigate them, you can help your family office get off to a great start.",
  "content": "First\u2011generation wealth creators move fast. They build a practice or company, eventually sell it, accumulate real estate and other investments along the way and eventually realize they\u2019re managing an entire enterprise of capital. The instinct is to \u201ckeep doing what worked,\u201d but family capital behaves differently from operating\u2011company cash flow.\n\nA family office is not an extension of the company that was sold; it is a governance, tax and investment ecosystem designed to preserve, and eventually transfer, capital. Early decisions and growing pains can and do compound. I\u2019ve seen and discussed these exact issues with many family offices at length, as well as within our own. Here are the eight most common mistakes I see many first-generation family offices make and the practical ways to avoid them:\n\nLaunching informally, or without purposeful intent, invites confusion and ultimately, conflict. Starting with a one-page charter outlining purpose, investment objectives, risk tolerance, decision rights and reporting cadence can help mitigate a multitude of these potential issues. While it\u2019s not particularly exciting, a formal structure early on is well worth it to reduce friction down the road.\n\nNewly liquid families often retain an outsized position in the business they just sold or a single real estate market because it feels safe, it\u2019s \u201cwhat they know,\u201d and it\u2019s how they got here to begin with. The challenge is that establishing concentration limits can create significant risks. Just as most businesses target expansion, a family office should ideally build a core allocation across categories that might include cash, fixed income, diversified real estate and opportunistic sleeves. Diversification can buy time when cycles turn, and eventually, they always do.\n\nRelying on a generalist CPA to \u201cfigure it out\u201d may lead to missed depreciation, inefficient entities and rushed year-end maneuvers. This can significantly impact the return potential for your investments. I can\u2019t stress enough how important it is to assemble tax counsel to map entities, trusts, qualified small business stock (QSBS) or 1031 opportunities, philanthropic vehicles and succession objectives into an integrated plan within 90 days of standing up the family office. Trust me, this counsel can ultimately help you to maximize your outcomes.\n\n4. Hiring Too Fast (Or Not At All)\n\nI have a motto, which is fire fast and hire slow. Some families defer all hiring (\u201cwe\u2019ll outsource everything\u201d), which is fine and works for many of our family office partners. But others will choose to build a full-time staff before strategy exists. The better way to build out your family office is to phase in talent deliberately and appropriately. For example, a team comprising an outsourced CIO plus a fractional controller and administrative support to start will often function well for a first-time family office. Once assets, complexity and deal flow justify it, then begin to add in-house investment staff. Just as a business isn\u2019t built overnight, neither should a family office be.\n\nSpreadsheets stored across inboxes create major blind spots around liquidity, commitments and performance. Early on, I highly suggest standing up a basic technology stack, which should include portfolio accounting, secure document management, a dashboard tracking NAV, fee drag and liquidity runway. Recognizing that information is infrastructure will help maximize your oversight and leadership within the family office in a significant way.\n\nAvoiding conversations about roles, distributions and next-generation involvement leaves families disconnected and highly reactive when disagreements arise, and they will. Being proactive and officially forming an investment committee with a voting protocol, minutes and quarterly schedule is critical. In addition, be sure to document a distribution policy and mediation process before it is needed. While they might appear to be \u201coverkill,\u201d there is tremendous value in these steps, as they help to demonstrate to your family the gravity of the legacy you\u2019re creating and set the tone for how future generations will run it.\n\nShielding heirs from financial discussions and then expecting stewardship later rarely works. Create an education track by age, focusing on milestones like financial literacy, investment \u201cshadow\u201d meetings, participating in an acquisition and even participating in philanthropy committees. Offer observer seats so younger members learn without jeopardizing capital and are adequately prepared to take the reins when that time comes.\n\nAggressively deploying capital until cash is tight can force sales at unfavorable times to meet tax requirements or other unexpected liquidity needs. Maintaining a 12- to 24-month liquidity runway using a rolling cash forecast tied to obligations and commitments is extremely helpful. While opportunistic investments can offer very favorable returns, they should never compromise baseline stability.\n\nTaking note of the common mistakes first-time family offices tend to make, and learning from them, is an opportunity it's best not to overlook. By recognizing these potential issues early on, and taking practical steps to mitigate them, you can help your family office get off to a great start.\n\nThe information provided here is not investment, tax or financial advice. You should consult with a licensed professional for advice concerning your specific situation.\n\nis the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.",
