  "description": "The president has direct control over DC\u2019s National Guard, unlike every other unit, which is under the authority of state governors.",
  "content": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday detailed when Washington, DC residents can expect to see National Guard troops patrolling the nation\u2019s capital and what they\u2019ll be allowed to do to combat crime in the city.\n\nThe Pentagon chief said Guardsmen from DC and \u201cother states\u201d will be deployed to the district \u201cthis week and in coming weeks\u201d and act as \u201cforce multipliers\u201d for local and federal law enforcement, in an interview on Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Ingraham Angle.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder Title 32, which is the authorization they\u2019ll be using, they have broad latitude, but they\u2019re not going to be involved in law enforcement functions,\u201d Hegseth continued, likening the military\u2019s role in DC to the June deployment of National Guard and US Marine service members to Los Angeles to protect federal law enforcement from protesters during immigration raids.\n\n\u201cThey will be standing right alongside our federal agents, like they were in Los Angeles. They\u2019re going to be proactive. If you take an action or a shot at them, there will be a consequence,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked by host Laura Ingraham what National Guard troops will do if they see a crime in progress, Hegseth responded, \u201cThey can come alongside and assist law enforcement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if law enforcement isn\u2019t on that corner?\u201d Ingraham pressed.\n\n\u201cI will have their back to ensure they can take the necessary action to protect citizens of DC and to protect themselves,\u201d the defense secretary said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no rogue law enforcement going on from the National Guard,\u201d Hegseth insisted. \u201cBut there\u2019s also the application of common sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to have the National Guard just sitting there \u2026 seeing a crime committed [and] not do something about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can help somebody interdict, temporarily detain, like we did in Los Angeles, and hand over to law enforcement those types of things,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe National Guard can be trained to do that.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump activated 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marine service members to California in June amid violent anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles.\n\nBy July 1, nearly all of the National Guard members and Marines had been released, with around 300 still in the city.\n\nHegseth did not say how many Guardsmen would be activated in DC, or how long they will patrol the city.\n\n\u201cI would call this \u2018conditions-based,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI would say it\u2019s a situation where we\u2019re here to support law enforcement, and the more we can free them up to do their job, the more effective they can be.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know \u2013 weeks, months? What will it take? That\u2019s the president\u2019s call, but we\u2019re going to be there for him to execute as swiftly as possible.\u201d\n\nThe president has direct control over DC\u2019s National Guard, unlike every other unit, which is under the authority of state governors.\n\nTrump signed an executive order Monday mobilizing the DC National Guard as part of an effort aimed at \u201crestoring law and order in the District of Columbia.\u201d\n\n\u201cWashington, DC, should be one of the safest, cleanest and most beautiful cities anywhere in the world,\u201d Trump said of his plans, \u201cand we\u2019re going to make it that.\u201d",

      "text": "Trump, Newsom square off in court over deployment of troops to put down LA riots\nJustice Department lawyers were in federal court Monday to defend the Trump administration\u2019s deployment of Marines and California National Guard troops during violent anti-ICE demonstrations in Los Angeles in June.\nThe three-day trial kicked off in San Francisco, with attorneys for the state arguing the deployment \u2014 which California Gov. Gavin Newsom strenuously objected to \u2014 violated a federal law against using military forces for domestic law enforcement.\nThe protests began June 6 as lawful demonstrations stemming from a series of raids conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement that saw more than 100 illegal immigrants rounded up around the city.\nHundreds took to the streets, chanting in opposition and waving Mexican flags and anti-ICE signs while clashing with cops and federal immigration officers.\nBut the protests soon escalated into full-blown riots, with cars burned in the streets, public buildings vandalized and local businesses pillaged by looters.\nAs the violence dragged on, President Trump announced he was deploying some 4,000 Coast Guard members and around 700 active-duty Marines to the City of Angels to put an end to the anarchy.\nNewsom condemned the deployments, saying it amounted to using soldiers as \u201cprops in the federal government\u2019s propaganda machine.\u201d\nThe Trump administration fired back, arguing the state\u2019s sanctuary city laws preventing local law enforcement from upholding immigration laws made federal intervention necessary.\nNewsom sued the administration, and federal Judge Charles R. Breyer \u2014 a former President Clinton appointee who is overseeing the California bench trial \u2014 ruled the deployment was illegal.\nHowever, hours later an appeals court rejected Breyer\u2019s ruling which cleared the way for the mobilization to continue.\nBy July 1, nearly all of the National Guard members and Marines called to Los Angeles had been released, with around 300 still in the city.\nThose remaining on duty are \u201csupporting the request for assistance\u201d from federal law enforcement agencies, William Harrington, former deputy chief of staff for the Army task force in charge of the Guard troops said in court Monday, according to the New York Times.\nThe trial could set a legal precedent for the extent of a commander-in-chief\u2019s authority over the military on US soil.\nNewsom\u2019s lawyers are vehement that sending troops to Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 federal law prohibiting the president from using armed forces to engage in civil law enforcement.\nAttorneys for the state also argue that by deploying troops over the objections of the governor and other California officials, Trump violated the 10th Amendment of the Constitution, which delineates the balance of power between the federal government and US states.\nAlso being alleged is that Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth violated the Administrative Procedure Act, arguing they \u201clack authority to federalize members of the California National Guard without issuing such orders through Governor Newsom,\u201d the complaint reads.\nTrump\u2019s lawyers have staked their counter-argument on a little-known law \u2014 Section 12406(3) of the US Code \u2014 which permits the president to federalize the National Guard under certain circumstances.\nAmong them, if the US is in danger of being invaded or currently under invasion, if there is an ongoing rebellion or danger of one occurring, or if the president is unable \u201cwith the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\u201d\nNewsom and California are seeking a formal declaration from the court that Trump and Hegseth\u2019s orders were illegal, as well as injunctive relief, which would prohibit future deployments of the California National Guard without the governor\u2019s express approval.\nThe bench trial opened on the same day President Trump announced he was placing Washington, DC\u2019s police department under federal control and deploying the National Guard to patrol the streets amid a surge of violent crime in the US capital."

      "text": "US military preparing to surge National Guard troops to Washington, DC, to fight local crime and youth violence: report\nThe US military is preparing to activate hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington, DC, as a part of President Trump\u2019s sweeping federal crackdown on crime in the nation\u2019s capital, according to authorities.\nTrump has yet to make a final decision about the activation of federal troops, but the National Guard is readying to deploy them, two US officials with knowledge of the operation confirmed to Reuters.\nThe preparation comes as 120 FBI agents from across the country have already begun patrolling DC streets overnight and backing up area cops at carjacking hot spots, despite many lacking local patrol work training, the Washington Post reported.\n\u201cBe prepared! There will be no \u2018MR. NICE GUY.\u2019 We want our Capital BACK,\u201d Trump wrote in a post Sunday on Truth Social ahead of a planned White House press conference Monday morning about the city\u2019s cleanliness and general condition.\nThe possible order follows Trump\u2019s \u201cMaking the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful\u201d executive order signed on March 28, which established a task force dedicated to fighting crime and reducing illegal immigration in the city.\n\u201cThe Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY. We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don\u2019t have to move out. We\u2019re going to put you in jail where you belong,\u201d Trump wrote in the social media post \u2014 comparing the action to his illegal immigration crackdown at the border.\n\u201cThe Mayor of D.C., Muriel Bowser, is a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances, and the Crime Numbers get worse, and the City only gets dirtier and less attractive,\u201d Trump said in a different post Sunday.\nBowser has since fought back on Trump\u2019s characterization of the city.\n\u201cIf the priority is to show force in an American city, we know he can do that here,\u201d Bowser said on MSNBC Sunday morning. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be because there\u2019s a spike in crime.\u201d\nViolent crime is down 26% compared with this time in 2024, according to DC police data, and there have been roughly 20% fewer juvenile arrests this year, the Washington Post reported.\nHowever, the White House isn\u2019t backing down \u2014 noting that the city\u2019s \u201cbeen plagued by petty and violent crime for far too long,\u201d press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.\nUS Park Police arrested more than half a dozen perps in the capital on charges including possession of stolen firearms and illicit drugs as part of a federal crackdown launched by the Trump administration Thursday to clean up the nation\u2019s capital.\nEight culprits were arrested in the surge and two handguns were confiscated from offenders with prior felony convictions, Park Police Fraternal Order of Police chairman Kenneth Spencer told The Post Friday.\nAt least 30 \u201cfraudulent oxycodone pills\u201d \u2014 which appeared to be fentanyl \u2014 were also seized, along with 210 grams of crack cocaine, 600 grams of marijuana, 64 grams of hashish oil and cash with a total value of $3,600, Spencer added.\nThe show of force was in part sparked by the beating of a 19-year-old former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer who was bloodied by a mob of 10 minors last Sunday as he thwarted a carjacking attempt in the nation\u2019s capital, according to DC police.\nEdward Coristine, whose LinkedIn handle earned him the nickname \u201cBig Balls\u201d at DOGE, was with a woman near downtown DC when he saw the group of juveniles approach their car and \u201cmake a comment about taking the vehicle.\u201d\nTrump and Coristine\u2019s former boss Elon Musk shared a photograph of the aftermath of the assault on Coristine early Tuesday afternoon, showing the former DOGE staffer sitting on the ground, bloodied and with his ripped shirt barely hanging on his body.\nCritics and residents have fired back at Trump\u2019s sweeping crackdown and removal of the homeless as inhumane.\n\u201cThat money could be better spent getting folks housing and support,\u201d Jesse Rabinowitz, campaign and communications director at the National Homelessness Law Center, told the Washington Post.\nIt is not yet clear what exactly federal troops would do, but they could be deployed to protect federal agents or even carry out administrative tasks to free up law enforcement, officials said.\nWith Post wires"

We wish him well in his future endeavors,\u201d chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement.\nIn addition to advising Hegseth on personnel and policy, Fulcher played a role in several defense initiatives during his tenure, he told Fox News Digital.\nFulcher said he contributed to reviews of major acquisition programs aimed at strengthening lethality and the US industrial base, and helped streamline software procurement timelines \u201cfrom years to months,\u201d modernizing key IT systems across the department.\nHe also said he supported Hegseth in high-level meetings across the Indo-Pacific, including the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, and participated in efforts that redirected nearly $50 billion from non-lethal line items into readiness and more impactful defense programs.\nFulcher praised the \u201cdedicated men and women of the Department of Defense,\u201d cited progress in \u201crevitalizing the warrior ethos\u201d and \u201crebuilding the military,\u201d and thanked both Hegseth and Trump for their leadership. \u201cStill, this is just the beginning,\u201d Fulcher added.\nFulcher, who had served as a senior advisor to Hegseth since April, announced his departure Saturday afternoon in a message posted to X.\n\u201cAs planned, I\u2019ve completed 6 months of service in government to my country,\u201d he wrote, calling the experience \u201cincredibly inspiring.\u201d\n\u201cNone of this could have happened without Secretary Hegseth\u2019s decisive leadership or President Trump\u2019s continued confidence in our team,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI will continue to champion American warfighters in all future endeavors.\u201d\nFulcher joined the DoD earlier this year as part of Hegseth\u2019s inner circle, a cohort of loyal advisers appointed after Hegseth took the helm at the Pentagon in Trump\u2019s second term.\nHis departure comes amid a broader reshuffling of senior personnel inside Hegseth\u2019s office.\nAt least six aides have left since January, though defense officials have downplayed the moves as standard transitions.\nIt\u2019s unclear what Fulcher\u2019s next step will be, though his statement suggests he intends to remain active in national security circles.\nThe Pentagon has not yet named a replacement."

It was not a minor, though,\u201d she told Pirro, noting that \u201cit\u2019s happened to a lot of people in our building, sadly.\u201d\n\u201cHe was homeless and half-dressed \u2013 clearly wasn\u2019t in his clear mind,\u201d Phillips said of her attacker.\nThe former CNN journalist said she felt her best option was to fight back.\n\u201cIt was scary as hell, I\u2019m not going to lie, but I fought back. I didn\u2019t see any weapons in his hands. I felt like it was my only choice,\u201d Phillips recalled.\nTrump fumed Monday that DC has been \u201covertaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people.\u201d\nThe president vowed that his administration is \u201cnot going to let it happen anymore,\u201d and will remove homeless encampments from all public places, including in parks and underpasses.\nThe latest data from DC\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department shows violent crime has dropped 26% in the district so far this year, compared to 2024.\nOverall crime is down 7% so far, according to MPD.\nTrump claimed Monday that the numbers were \u201cphony\u201d and promised that Attorney General Pam Bondi will be \u201clooking into that.\u201d\nThe president noted that a DC police commander was suspended last month for allegedly falsifying crime data to make trends appear more positive.\nPirro, in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, described DC as an \u201cincredibly violent area\u201d with a crime problem that is so \u201chorrific\u201d that residents have stopped reporting some of it altogether.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve got here are people that are not even making complaints about the quality-of-life crimes, whether it\u2019s shoplifting or damaging property or an attempted carjacking,\u201d the DC US attorney said.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t even call the police,\u201d Pirro continued, arguing that \u201cwe\u2019re not even seeing most of the crime that\u2019s occurring.\u201d\nThe former New York district attorney and Fox News host also argued that the reason Trump\u2019s press conference announcing the DC crime crackdown was \u201cso packed\u201d is because many journalists, like Phillips, have been the victims of crime in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\u201cThose reporters in that room \u2013 and it was packed to the gills \u2013 experience crime themselves,\u201d Pirro said."

      "text": "At its best, Washington, DC, is a city of grandeur, of iconic monuments and world-historical centers of power.\nAt its worst, it\u2019s a harrowing place where a 14-year-old could steal your Hyundai.\nThe confluence of these two truths in the terrible early-morning beating of the DOGE employee Edward Coristine, known by his sobriquet \u201cBig Balls,\u201d has prompted President Donald Trump to federalize the DC police and deploy the National Guard.\nThe software engineer played a significant role in the frenetic push to reform the federal government that dominated the beginning of Trump\u2019s second term and, by virtue of being in the wrong place at the wrong time (and protecting a young woman), was violently attacked by teenagers within two miles of the White House.\nThe metropolitan government of Washington has never been worthy of the seat of government of the greatest and most powerful nation that has ever existed.\nIt\u2019s consistently been an embarrassment and, for decades now, has tolerated \u2014 and, worse, created the conditions for \u2014 disorderly and dangerous streets.\nThe late historian Fred Siegel wrote how \u201csocial license and economic restrictions,\u201d what he calls \u201cthe two halves of sixties liberalism,\u201d drained cities like Washington, DC, of their vitality.\nOver-regulated and inefficient, they were saddled by a \u201cstate-supported economy of social workers.\u201d\nOn top of this, in the 1970s, DC experienced \u201cblack nationalism in power,\u201d especially in the person of the catastrophic, long-time mayoralty of Marion Barry.\nThe federal government had to put a financial control board in charge in the 1990s to bring the District back from the brink of bankruptcy.\nIndeed, in the scheme of things, Trump\u2019s intervention is more the norm than the exception in DC\u2019s history.\nIn the 19th century, Congress governed the district via committees, before trying home rule in 1871 and quickly pulling back after the district was \u2014 yes \u2014 financially mismanaged.\nDC has had home rule since 1973, with the financial board exercising significant power from 1995 to 2001.\nThe district is better off now than in the bad old days of the 1990s, but remains beset by a soft-minded progressivism on matters of law and order that is an ongoing threat to public safety.\nAs usual, Trump is opting for the sledgehammer over the scalpel.\nStill, his indictment of DC for allowing lawless young people to blight the city is accurate.\nBut, the critics object, violent crime is falling in Washington!\nYes, it is, although from an unacceptably high level.\nAs of 2024, DC had the fourth-highest homicide rate of all major US cities and a higher homicide rate than all 50 states.\nAs Charles Lehman of the Manhattan Institute points out, its homicide rate for young black men has been above the national average for decades now.\nThe killings overwhelmingly involve young black men who have already been entangled in the criminal-justice system, with substantial rap sheets and often prison time.\nLehman cites a report by the National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform that found about \u201c500 identifiable people\u201d are in this category, and account for 60% to 70% of all the gun violence in the city.\nThe carjackings, meanwhile, tend to be carried out by minors.\nAccording to Lehman, DC needs more cops who are more active making stops and arrests, as well as more prosecutions.\nIt also should be targeting the relatively small group of people most prone to violence, and the city\u2019s gangs.\nAll of this, coupled with cleaning up homeless encampments, could continue the recent favorable crime trends and make the city feel like a better, safer place.\nIt\u2019s probably too much to ask Washington, DC\u2019s government to meet the soaring, implicit standard of its most famous buildings.\nBut not having to fear roving bands of young thugs would be a step in the right direction.\nTwitter: @RichLowry"

      "text": "US Marines temporarily detain a civilian \u2014 an Army veteran \u2014 for the first time in LA\nMarines deployed to Los Angeles temporarily detained a civilian on Friday, the U.S. military confirmed after being presented with Reuters images, in the first known detention by active-duty troops deployed there by President Donald Trump.\nThe incident took place at the Wilshire Federal Building in Los Angeles where Marines took charge of the mission to protect the building earlier on Friday, in a rare domestic use of U.S. troops after days of protests over immigration raids.\nReuters images showed Marines apprehending the man, restraining his hands with zip ties and then handing him over to civilians from the Department of Homeland Security.\nAsked about the incident, the U.S. military\u2019s Northern Command spokesperson said active duty forces \u201cmay temporarily detain an individual in specific circumstances.\u201d\n\u201cAny temporary detention ends immediately when the individual(s) can be safely transferred to the custody of appropriate civilian law enforcement personnel,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nSpeaking to reporters after he was released, the civilian identified himself as Marcos Leao, 27.\nLeao said he was an Army veteran on his way to an office of the Department of Veterans Affairs when he crossed a yellow tape boundary and was asked to stop.\nLeao, who gained his U.S. citizenship through military service, said he was treated \u201cvery fairly.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re just doing their job,\u201d said Leao, who is of Angolan and Portuguese descent.\nThe 200 Marines and more than 2,000 National Guard now deployed to Los Angeles are tasked with protecting federal property and federal personnel.\nThey will be joined by an additional 500 Marines and 2,000 more National Guard soldiers.\nThis means that they will accompany ICE agents on raids, officials have said.\nThe troops are authorized to detain people who pose a threat to federal personnel or property, but only until police can arrest them.\nMilitary officials are not allowed to carry out arrests themselves.\nThe Posse Comitatus Act generally forbids the U.S. military, including the National Guard, from taking part in civilian law enforcement.\nTrump could take a more far-reaching step by invoking the Insurrection Act, which would allow troops to directly participate in civilian law enforcement."

      "text": "Washington, DC\u2019s political class may scream in fury at Team Trump\u2019s takeover of policing, but we suspect most district residents will be relieved: Regular people put public safety first.\nThe city\u2019s politicians have failed to do that, and the feds have a duty to act when the nation\u2019s capital is unsafe.\nEven Democrats have been willing to stomp on DC\u2019s demands for \u201chome rule\u201d when it comes to fighting crime: By a vote of 81-14 in 2023, for example, the Dem-run Senate joined with the GOP-run House to override the City Council\u2019s bid to reduce maximum penalties for violent crime, including carjackings \u2014 and President Joe Biden signed the measure into law.\nCarjackings, for the record, are still triple the 2018 level, part of a grim wave of youth crime \u2014 yet city leaders have refused to get serious about stopping the violence.\nNor did President Donald Trump rush to do this: He warned Mayor Muriel Bowser last year that action was on the table; she\u2019s had six months to turn things around \u2014 but several high-profile recent crimes, including last month\u2019s shooting death of 3-year-old Honesty Cheadle, showed she needs help.\nIndeed, as Trump noted, the US capital has more murders per capita than notorious Mexico City and Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. The homicide rate is six times New York City\u2019s.\nTo drive crime down, this intervention will bring in new resources, including hundreds of National Guard and broader deployment of the federal Park Police.\nNote, too: The feds share blame for DC\u2019s high crime: The US Attorney for the District of Columbia is responsible for all felony prosecutions in the city \u2014 but Biden appointees to the job refused to prosecute over half of local crimes.\nWe hope neither the City Council nor Democrats (in Congress or neighboring Maryland and Virginia) try to sabotage this intervention. Everyone but the bad guys, and DC\u2019s citizens most of all, is a winner if it succeeds."

      "text": "Trump takes control of DC police, deploying National Guard in historic capital crime crackdown \u2014 and warns NYC could be next\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump announced a sweeping crime crackdown in DC on Monday, placing the city\u2019s police department under federal control and deploying the National Guard to patrol the streets \u2014 while warning New York City could be next.\n\u201cI\u2019m announcing a historic action to rescue our nation\u2019s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor \u2014 and worse. This is liberation day in DC and we\u2019re going to take our capital back,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\u201cOur capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore. We\u2019re not going to take it.\u201d\nTrump vowed to \u201cclean it up real quick,\u201d \u201clike we did on the southern border\u201d with illegal immigration.\nThe Home Rule Act, which granted DC self-governance in 1973, allows the president to assert emergency control of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) for 30 days. Congress can pass a joint resolution extending his control, which would require a bare majority in the Republican-held House and Senate.\nDocuments formalizing the takeover were transmitted to Congress Monday afternoon and DC police officials set up a meeting later in the day with White House officials to discuss the new arrangement.\nTerry Cole, the Senate-confirmed administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, will temporarily lead the 3,400-officer MPD under the supervision of Attorney General Pam Bondi, Trump said.\nIt was not immediately clear how the National Guard deployment will proceed \u2014 including numbers and neighborhoods where they will be sent \u2014 but members of that force historically assist law enforcement in a supporting role and do not have the ability to make arrests.\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in an interview on Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d Monday night, said Guardsmen from DC and \u201cother states\u201d would be deployed to the district \u201cthis week and in coming weeks\u201d to act as \u201cforce multipliers\u201d for local and federal law enforcement.\n\u201cThey will be standing right alongside our federal agents, like they were in Los Angeles. They\u2019re going to be proactive. If you take an action or a shot at them, there will be a consequence,\u201d Hegseth told host Laura Ingraham.\nThe Pentagon chief added that the troops will be allowed to \u201cinterdict\u201d and \u201ctemporarily detain\u201d individuals if they see a crime in progress and local law enforcement isn\u2019t nearby, \u201clike we did in Los Angeles.\u201d\nHegseth didn\u2019t say how many National Guard members would be activated in DC, or how long they would be patrolling the streets, describing the length of their mission as \u201cconditions-based.\u201d\nJustifying his action Monday morning, the president displayed a chart showing that DC has more murders per capita than the capital cities of cocaine-exporting Columbia, cartel-plagued Mexico, and terrorist hub Iraq.\n\u201cWe doubled up on Baghdad,\u201d Trump commented.\n\u201cYou people are victims of it too. You are reporters and I understand a lot of you tend to be on the liberal side. But you don\u2019t want to get mugged and raped and shot and killed. And you all know people, friends of yours, where that\u2019s happened.\u201d\nTrump cited many high-profile recent crimes in the capital, including the Aug. 3 attack on former Department of Government Efficiency staffer Edward Coristine, 19, during an alleged attempted carjacking and the June 30 murder of congressional intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, 21, in a drive-by shooting.\nTrump also mentioned the 2023 carjacking of Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), the near-fatal stabbing of an aide to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) the same year by a \u201cdemented lunatic\u201d and the shooting death of a three-year girl in July.\nThe president described criminals lawlessly cruising about town on unauthorized ATVs and motorbikes and said he planned to beautify the District by fixing road medians, broken marble and potholes.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting rid of the slums too\u2026I know it\u2019s not politically correct,\u201d Trump said, teasing apparent plans to get rid of public housing in high-property-value DC.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting rid of the slums where they live.\u201d\nHomeless encampments will also be removed from all public places, including in parks and underpasses, the president vowed, while the US Park Police \u2014 under the control of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum \u2014 will be responsible for the removal of graffiti.\nDC officials say they won\u2019t resist\nDistrict Mayor Muriel Bowser, an elected Democrat, confirmed Monday afternoon that she would comply with the federal takeover.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to work every day to make sure it\u2019s not a complete disaster, let me put it that way,\u201d Bowser said at her own press conference, at which she called Trump\u2019s move \u201cunsettling and unprecedented.\u201d\n\u201cThe main point is this: Everybody should follow the law, the police and the community. And that\u2019s the case now, it was the case last week and it was the case the week before,\u201d she said.\nThe mayor added that she was particularly concerned about making sure that \u201call law enforcement be identifiable by uniform, a badge, a jacket, so that people know that they are law enforcement.\u201d\nTrump first ordered federal officials, including members of the FBI, DEA and Border Patrol, onto the streets of DC the night of Aug. 7-8. Photos circulating on social media and in the press showed those agents wearing clearly identifying uniforms.\nMPD Chief Pamela Smith confirmed she had a meeting set for later Monday with two federal officials, whom she did not name, about next steps.\nSmith added she was interested in receiving help to enforce outstanding warrants for criminal suspects, saying there are \u201cthings that the federal government is also very useful for.\u201d\n\u201cThis will be an opportunity for us to come together and collaborate on being able to go out and execute warrants,\u201d the police chief said.\nAhead of Trump\u2019s announcement, Bowser told MSNBC on Sunday that \u201cwe do need the federal government\u2019s help\u201d and specifically requested assistance rebuilding the city jail.\nBowser recently invoked curfews in parts of the city in a bid to keep teens off the street as early as 7 p.m., but also has claimed crime rates are going down in the city, pointing to official data.\nTrump claimed Monday that the numbers were \u201cphony\u201d and promised that Bondi will be \u201clooking into that.\u201d\nThe president noted that DC police commander Michael Pulliam, whose district included the densely populated Adams Morgan and Columbia Heights neighborhoods, was suspended last month for allegedly falsifying crime data to make trends appear more positive.\nPulliam\u2019s police union defended him and accused MPD leadership of ordering subordinates to falsify violent crime data.\nDC Police Union chairman Gregg Pemberton endorsed Trump\u2019s takeover, saying in a Fox News interview: \u201cWe completely agree with the president that crime in the District of Columbia is out of control and something needs to be done with it.\u201d\nNew York, Chicago, LA in crosshairs\nTrump announced at his press conference that other cities may be next, saying at one point that \u201cI\u2019m going to look at New York in a little while\u201d \u2014 and also name-checking Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\u201cYou look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is. We have other cities that are very bad. New York has a problem,\u201d Trump said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting very strongly with DC, and we\u2019re going to clean it up real quick, very quickly as they say.\u201d\nTrump additionally announced plans for federal legislation that would override state laws barring judges from applying cash bail requirements to criminal defendants.\nIf necessary, Trump added, ordinary military members could be deployed to join the National Guard and the local cops.\nThe president has direct control over DC\u2019s National Guard, unlike every other unit, which is under the authority of state governors.\n\u201cWashington, DC, should be one of the safest, cleanest and most beautiful cities anywhere in the world,\u201d Trump summed up his plans, \u201cand we\u2019re going to make it that.\u201d"
